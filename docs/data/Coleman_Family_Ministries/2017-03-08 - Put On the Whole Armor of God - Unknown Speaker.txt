to be here today but uh so I'm here on a wing in a prayer cuz I'm quite tired amen quite worn out but I just felt that I couldn't with the meetings being Supernatural the way they were I didn't know how many messages I preached I got all I must have preached about four messages I was only trying to preach two amen I don't feel that I really said what I wanted to say on one of the inspiration the lord gave me you may be seated so about Tuesday I kept hearing put on the whole arm of God and it come to me Tuesday Wednesday I didn't know what I said well I did get into it it was my subject over there and Joanne had a song uh to take the sword of the spirit that was supposed to be sang with it but anyway uh I waited until last night and be sure I was just too tired and so he says no you finish up cuz I'm going to take a long rest so you're not going to see me for a while but I wanted to leave you with an understanding that you understand that you are on the third [Applause] phase and there's no more that I can do at this time only the dove can lead the eag so I can't do no more it's time for you to cause a Revival in your life in your home the ministers cannot do it amen so with that understanding a few words we have some visitors here all right just a few moments now and now here's where you're going to understand what took place amen so you thank God for the pen Harris meeting you know it was Supernatural the anointing is still with you okay I believe on June 7th I read this to you I feel led to reread it again and it came to me on May 6th this year but I read it on May June 7th and this is a quote that the Lord just told me to write the third pull was here as the original faith we had to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered and restored back by Malachi 4 through the first phase and the second phase and now as we reach our third phase place in Christ come and rejoice with us we actually connect with Malachi 4's thirdd pool catch it now which is the original Apostolic Faith with signs and wonders and miracles and outpouring of the Holy Ghost amen that what that's what lays on the third poor amen so the day that we strength that third phase ours and I believe it's today which was June 7th uh uh it immediately connects right into Malachi 43r poll the opening of the word amen and then watch we are back to the word and the spirit cuz the spirit comes on the third phas so you see all these years you've been waiting you had the way you come down to this amen reference the spoken word is Original Seed this will be pre Now watch how it's going to be preached this will be preached as the revelation of the son of man making you ready for the Rapture by the Perfection of the son of man which will make you ready unquote amen so I'll read it again today so you don't miss it and you come back and you know where you are I believe that June 7th started it with it because earnestly contending for the faith restored back by Malachi 4 and we actually hit it on June 14th the voice of the Archangel amen for when omnipotent speaks the miraculous does take place so you see how this must tie in amen and we got evidence right in the bank Nelly Brisbane of the miraculous vindicating what I'm telling you amen so I don't I can take me a rest now cuz the holy spirit is here to take you on Amen now you remember September 22nd 1991 I stepped out

seated Amen brother hun yes sir now I'm not Bishop Johnson now amen praise God so but we have got to understand that we're living by the evidence of the new land amen the son of man that was revealed through the prophet that's how we living on all these promises here's the son of man we read it we eat we [Applause] live but there's certain promises come to a time for you to take it and that's now amen may be seated and the son of man that was revealed through the prophet is a land of bible promises to be taken by Caleb by faith amen Caleb amen okay brother Bram himself said hallelujah it's on quote I think I have it here somewhere Hall I'm trying to nail it down I'm going to see it for a while and I want you to know what what the faith is here provens word page 22 watch what a perfect what a real perfect evidence it is how God does that just as he does today he said now God the land is great now before you go over I want you to see the land is great so bring me back some evidence of the land see before you get baptized and go over and die finally to the world and everything else to yourself he wants you to know that the land is great amen so he he brings some witnesses back for you to look at it and you see them shouting and singing and praising God and preaching and preaching with faith and you're looking right at it that's the land you see him living holy that's the land You Don't See with mind battles that's the land you don't see them wanting to go back for some leaks onions and garlic why because they in the [Applause] land huh amen maybe City to God so go bring me back some evidence of the land and show it to the people see so they got up there and now always when you come to bring back an Evidence there's an enemy lays in the road some old unbelief yes sir when some of them Fells looked over and seen those great Giants of Canaan oh my they said we can't do it but they brought back the evidence that the land was there they had not been falsely LED God was proven to them his word even before they enter the land God always does that he came himself and prove that there's a holy ghost before he told his disciples to go in the upper room he did the science and ones Miracles and told him that they can do the same thing is that correct then he came back again himself in the profit and did the same thing all over again so what are we hanging around for this a good land I'm not hanging around here no more praise God I'm going over I'm me I I want my Mountain amen can't now okay let's bring it down can't you see today that if you'll drive a th000 miles to hear the word and watch it being proved and confirmed it's the evidence that it's a great land you can see a shadow of a man laying dying with cancer we saw Canada dying we saw galz dying what's wrong with the people today here's a prophet using the same thing for himself nothing greater no wings and angels flying around somewhere so what are you looking for it's happening right in front of you amen maybe see a man laying down with cancer I remember when Canada called me at Friday night he asked the mother could I call Brother Coleman she said well you feel L he called me he said brother call me Canada said oh I says now you in the hospital I didn't know anything about the Wednesday prayer and I said oh you're in the hospital says yeah and uh I want you to pray for me I said what road are you on boy I said there's two roads amen now and which then whichever Road you on depends how I'm going to pray amen I said now are you on the road to the world or you on the road to Heaven amen he said brother K I'm on the road to heaven [Applause] he you know what he told me he says if I never get healed I want the Holy Ghost yes sir that's what he told me I saw all right Canal may be seated bow your head we're going to pray brother and we prayed and he finished praying his mother told me I said what happened after I prayed he laid back in the bed and smiled put his hand back like so so I said yeah she says uh everything is all right he said oh yeah he's a brother com and praise it's all right amen and his brother come in said Dudley go get me two pieces of pizza and a can of cold soda huh he had cancer in the stomach but he had Faith he was laying down and God healing it's evidence Nelly's back there is evidence oh the Holy Spirit should pour out here today oh let me hurry here may be seated be made whole we see that the word of God that he spoke would happen the day being confirmed it's the evidence that he keeps his word there's a great land if my life is just about gone and God comes down and Spares it again brother uh brother Ortiz and uh sister Nelly Here that shows that there's an Evidence of eternal life hallelujah praise God where you once wouldn't have darken the door of that church now you stand in line to get into it is an Evidence God keeps his word and proves it to you amen now he said now how does he prove his word amen you see he says uh he uh he says it's by True Believers that he proves his word not by those who who say they believe but by those who really believe it's by his believing children that he proves his word so on this third phase I'm looking for the the believing children the calebs that he's going to prove his word by those that really believe amen so we thank God for all things here did you get that now amen praise God so we see the evidence of the land now before you go over he said he want to give you the evidence and we see is by True Believers and not those who say they are believers now he'll do the same thing again yes sir in the promises of today he proves his word regardless he proves his word this was my inspiration from September the 8th through November 17th and God has proven his word with the evidence can you say amen he told me to get out there nothing and prove my word and my grace is sufficient whether you're sick whether you're worry whether the people don't want to praise God you tell them prove my word and the word of God has been proven and you are here as Witnesses so there's no nothing else on me and I'll say it again may be seated and God has proven his word with the evidence five times November 3rd 1991 brother Ortiz raised from the dead January 1992 uh uh brother galz dying brother fiori went to the hospital and prayed they wouldn't even give him no blood next morning gave a transfusion Brother Canada disease and brother bomman the church prayed and then he phoned me Friday and I pray with him and now June 16th sister Nelly brisban Brisbane raised from the dead sitting Among Us right here five evidences of the good land so we must be ready to me it's ready for an outpouring today it's but it got to come from you if you finally believe it regardless of what you have done just ask God to forgive you that's all Hallelujah don't sit there with all mind battles and stuff amen you may be seated what is a church is the evidence that is a great land he proves he proves his word by his believing children and what are you driving here from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania and Upstate New York and New Jersey you driveing here cuz you see the evidence you know that the message is being preached and you know it's being proven Hallelujah that's why you're driving here may be seated remember place in Christ and now as we reach our third phase we actually connect with Malachi 4's third pull which is the original Apostolic Faith which signs wers and miracles and outpouring of the Holy Spirit did we have it did the Holy Spirit pour out June uh December 29th did you see the dead raised the miracles happen well then we have entered into to the third pool the opening of the word oh Hallelujah for when omnipotent speaks the miraculous does take place you may be seated and Malachi 4 third pull is the opening of the word and then that means from this day on back to the Bible why we in another Ephesians we are here hallelujah that's how you know did you get it I'll tell it to you again and what another Ephesians does may be seated One Faith one Lord one baptism one God one father a perfect man a perfect church is that correct now your face should be nailed down that's what I'm doing now for the rest of this summer she have no more mind battles you should know you're on the third phase and I don't have to be here the the dove is here the same one that's down at Pin Harris he's here amen you may be seated and here's how it happened June 7th earnestly contending for the faith restored back by Malachi 4 the Holy Spirit told me that he said in all these years he said you've been preaching the faith since 1963 your brother hun right here the devil was raised twice you see brother oiki dead was raised a long time ago signs and wonders and miracles was done here long time ago he told me but I wouldn't let you say it cuz then they would think you point to yourself so I never said it until June 7th 1992 what is that patience [Applause] H so now he tolds he told me so now when you bring it back to the faith he said then that will open up the word cuz it'll put it into Ephesians then the faith is the opening of the word amen and to prove back to you one more time to put on this tape so to be here you go back to it uh the tape was uh 53 6148 earnestly for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints this is what was my inspiration in pen Harris I didn't use it here on June 7th because here I had to tie the faith into the intelligence into the mind of Christ the last moving faculty but I couldn't do that in pin Harris they might get funny so who who who is he what's he talking about the the intelligence so I did that here I don't do everything out there that I do here here like the voice of the Archangel that's that's not for them that's for [Music] him amen see that there now so I just you know a little form here and there and hit it you know it's okay about 5 minutes here the book of Jud was written ad 66 33 years after Pentecost he was the fcer brother of Jesus Christ Jew was a prophet he was foretelling here and connecting the church and was written to all the churches throughout the age and I believe specifically to this church of this age now the church is always the called out Born Again people regardless of denomination is the call out of God and Jude is addressing this letter to the called Sanctified church not the world now he is addressing to the church telling them so that's why I'm telling some brothers in here if you going with a girl in this message and and she's going all the way well she's in the call Sanctified church and if you don't have the same thing that she's got and you going with her and you in the world where you in the world and you're not going where she's going tell you right now so either you make up your mind today buddy praise God you're not going with her praise God because she is called out and her life shows it amen what does your life show playing ball and stuff huh going out in the sun looking like a lobster or something or other or what huh praise God and you saw what just happened with the laws pass here on these beaches you ain't got no business down there at all is that right you know I'm right what business do you have on a New York Beach when they just passed the law for the women to strip themselves to be topless now what Son of God going to go is going to go on the beach now well I you know if I come flying over my the helicopter and look what you doing down here boy where brother com I my feet was stinging you I was trying to get some salt water get out of there what are you doing down there praise God hallelujah amen PR come on his feet was stinging brother more than your feet will sting praise God I tell you that you need a 2x4 of the word of God next to your backside amen hallelujah praise God amen amen okay you got tell like it is huh glory amen yes sir Okay this not for South Africa amen for New York amen you may be seated it's New York tape here amen I'm sry to say anything here praise God Amen yes sir Hallelujah now just for those who are that are Sanctified in God preserved in Christ and called he says you are the people that I'm telling to that I'm telling to that you will earnestly only these people will earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now not a faith that was delivered but the faith that was once delivered did you notice there the faith that was once delivered to the Saints not just a faith some people say well now that's against my Faith Baptist Presbyterian all they all have a faith but they ain't the faith in the Bible so you don't want to embarrass them or you say yes brother you delivering you see some good Baptist with a big long cigar and yellow nicotine fingers he's bless God I'm contending for the faith what faith is he talking about praise God he means at uh 2:00 uh cocktail hour on Sunday afternoon he's contending and struggling to get in there and is jammed all the way out to the door you got to fight your way in there praise God to get a seat at the bar amen contending struggling amen debating and arguing with people in there well amen hallelujah Glory my God which one huh yes sir now you you that are here as strangers don't pay me no mind cuz uh this is a wild man here amen but these people they know what I'm talking about amen glory yes sir thank you amen okay now uh uh the faith did you notice that the faith that was once lived to the Saint not just a faith some people say well now that's against my faith there's only one Faith One Faith one Lord one God God one baptism One Faith one Doctrine see you're nailed down amen people say I have a faith and I go to my own church well that's not what Jude is speaking about here he's talking to the people that is to contend for the faith not to contend for your denomination he talking about what happened on the day of Pentecost when Mary come stagging down drunk under the power content for that amen [Applause] Hallelujah you know what a brother told me you may be seated we talking about I said well brother hope the people don't bother you down here they get up and they stand there you got to sit behind them all like that no brother he said I was born and raised an Irish Catholic he says in somewhere down south there he says and that that don't bother me cuz I was raised uh getting down and getting up so when I came here I said oh this is the real thing here I said that you got it brother this is the real one here amen what they call it a Jenna flon or something like that amen praise God here is an anointing Glory down amen praise the Lord so now it now okay he's talking to the on that had to contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints if we can only find out what the faith is see then we can earnestly contend for that faith is that right now go across the message this interpretation that interpretation this idea that idea what are they contending for they don't even know but if we can find what the faith is and you found it and you know what it is so let's contend for it that's what pen half was all about the faith Hallelujah may be seated the fa we can only find out what the faith is what is it what is it now you know what it is young people you know what it is then we can earnestly Shu everything else away from us get out of here sincere Earnest contend for that faith is that right what's the faith now the faith that was once to the Saints if we go back to where they were called Saints and find out what kind of Faith they had then we'll we will know more or less what to contend for Saints Sanctified clean pure holy that was the beginning of the church when it was inaugurated the day of Pentecost now let's look at what they had back there what the church contended for what they had lost now just 33 years at the beginning of the church and brother I had them guys pin down those guys that came down down from heaven I was going to nail them and pin Harris I and the Lord said have mercy on them and pull back on them so I pulled back on them but brother I had them supernatural beings up there sons of God where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy your spirit shouted up there then your spirits kicked those guys out 2/3 came down on the earth beings religious Holy Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Buddha Hindu amen see they come down to earth and Noah's time Christ in Noah It Will Rain Revelation denying the power Revelation see where second Timothy 3 come from he highminded truth Breakers false accusers in Noah's time amen you may be seated so I started to nail them then you CLD book 21 brother BR said they rotated off to the spirit of God but Satan uh rebelled and they fell for his lie and they were deceived by Satan and they are his men today in the message and those silly women are his sisters in the message waiting to hear something else huh oh glory to God I know where I'm standing at you may be seated then them supernatural beings came all the way through jam and jamri you find them all the way through the Bible fundamental uh baem and all of them amen they fundamentalists they can lay down to uh preach the second coming of Christ tell you all about Elijah Malachi for the Catholic church and this and that in the message and brother BR pin their HIDs down false anointed ones second Timothy 3 almost deceive the very elected but brother B would have some but God would have some spiritual joshuas here that would bust their eyes praise God yes sir amen so I had them nailed but I said I let them go let those foxes go and try to get to the rabbits amen praise God Amen those Sly foxes huh and now we will notice what kind of a faith that they had they had a Faith watch in a resurrected living Christ not some dead Church sitting there all dead but God moving among them hallelujah praise the Lord and know dead intellectuals don't feel nothing and they sit there dead cuz they don't feel nothing amen you may be seated someone who had rose from the dead and was living among them just the same as he was before he ever died now see they wasn't contending for some historical Affair but they was continuing for a living Christ a resurrected one who was in their midst when Christ was here through the prophet and I seen that God turn that Prophet over to brother Hunt say you praying for your sister her name is mil she has asthma amen and I stood up cuz a living God was there not a some man with some intellectual words you're praying for your sister but I felt a living moving being he said that's Mr Coman your friend you're praying for your father that's thus sayeth the Lord said glory to cut Hallelujah brother John heard me the four beasts around the throne heard me thousand time thousand thousand thousand heard I Joe Coleman shouting and praising and blessing God's name you tell me you don't want to praise the Lord you ain't got nothing to praise God for huh amen Amen brother Del yes sir praise the Lord see what kind of God I'm talking about now may be seated and when that Prophet went to heaven what was I contending for that same God that same anointing the Shadow the king is in the camp 1966 and I've been contended ever [Applause] since you may be seated but 1974 the holy spirit let me see what it was seven Thunders then I knew the faith was restored back then I really begin to earnestly contend for the phas first pull first phase second phase now June July pin Harris 92 third phase and now more than ever earnestly contending for the faith restored B by Malachi 4 you may be seated so that you don't ever forget this here when Malachi for's third pool came and them seven seal seven thund opened that word that was the faith get what they say that was the faith and that's what you earnestly contend for amen I'm taking this time to nail it down to you amen for you looking for a resurrected one in your midst now when he rose from the dead he done the same things after he rose from the dead through the apostles that he did before he died even greater more of it yet he said a little while the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me the church the the believer for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and how you going to do that then now and on God call man he said a little while the world see won't won't see me no more well then how would we see him we'd have to see his Spirit we'd have to see his Spirit rais brother arti from the dead we'd have to see a spirit raised Nelly from the dead that's the only way you going to see him then if you see that then you know that the living resurrected Christ is in your midst now now amen you may be seated amen we have to see a spirit if he's in us and that Spirit would have to do the same thing that he did then or it wouldn't be the same spirit I am the vine ye are the branches and if we the branches in the the vine the branch will bear the same kind of fruit that the vine produces to it when the first Vine come forth the first branch that come out of the vine was a Pentecostal Branch Visions Powers healings baptism of the Holy Spirit great signs and wonders the next branch will have to be the same kind of a branch on down to the end it'll have to be the same that's what Jesus said and that's what you're going to see and you're already beginning to see it yes sir amen okay let me hurry up and finish up right here now now now you know how you're going to see them and you're already seeing him then you know he's here then the faith is here the resurrection faith is him amen now that was what the apostles believe and they believe that what he was in the flesh he was also and more in the spirit and that's what they taught that's what they believe and that's what they practiced and that's what God confirmed and on June 7 I put this into my church here you remember that I said I'm placing signs and wonders and miracles in this church how many remember that Apostolic time I put it in here positionally put it in here and it happened yes amen yes sir that's what they practice that's what God confirmed and that's what was Malachi for restored back to this bride but during this time it's 33 years lapse that uh there became many false Brethren that was raised up and gone into heresies same thing happened again since 1965 and brought people into Theology and different things like that and Paul I think him laying I'm cutting a little bit short here let's contend for the faith the true faith that once was delivered to the Saints the Saints believe in the death Buri and Resurrection they believe in the baptism of the spirit the early Church believe it you you believe it then let's contend for it now they believed in signs and wonders following the believer now as they begin to Fall Away Jews said men of old was foreordained to do this now God is soling God knows who would do this and he's speaking back with Pharaoh Moses Jans and jamri it comes on down how marvelous earnestly continue forth the faith that was once delivered to the Saints all back in the age now the very faith that they had at to beginning supposed to be today this gospel is preached then Jesus shall return St Matthew 24:14 act8 1 Corinthians 4:20 that's why he gave me those scriptures amen demonstrate the power of God to every creature in now watch in order to preach the gospel before you could make it a gospel preached remember in pin Harris then You' have got to have the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel now how many have preached the gospel how many ministers in this mess have preached the gospel amen before they can preach it they got to have demonstration of spirit and power raising of the dead and signs and wers and miracles so have they preached it yet that's why it says there's a third phase the third phase will vindicate the first Faith amen hallelujah and they laughed and they mocked and they SC said what's he talking about I know what I'm talking about the faith praise God you may be seated in order to preach the gospel before you can make it a gospel preacher you can't call the this the gospel if there's nothing happening you just quoting some quotes but where's the gospel the gospel is to demonstrate the power of God that's the gospel oh let me hurry up here in order to preach the gospel before you can make it a gospel preach you got to have the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel the letter killer the spirit make it Al liive so it's not just so ralistic a a r ritualistic Affair was it's absolutely a real living reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ living among men and that's the faith I'm trying my best to contend for today and the prophet was sent out with three pulls to contend for this faith and he brought it back to that faith and he started listen he didn't come out with just reading the Bible he came out with signs and wonders and miracles he came out with gift he could turn his head and say what's behind him he demonstrated the Holy Spirit then he come down to that third pull and He restored back the faith amen may be seated that he said I'm trying my best to contend for today that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and his power is unlimited so I do not limit the power of God to high you feel today I preach the word of God half you come in here some come in here sleepy some come in here mad some come in here mean I don't limit to God limit God the way you feel or what happened in your house no no way preach the word of God Amen amen power is unlimited how marvelous how that God has done this for this today oh I ain't going to go a whole hour all right I'll finish it you must have a living faith Born Again faith I found a people with a living faith talking about Pentecostals where they have absolutely caught a hold of something God out there gives him a new birth that puts God into the person makes him believe in the Supernatural now if you're not born again you do not believe in the Supernatural if you do not believe in the Supernatural you have not been born again because you were born again you become a Son of God when you are and being a Son of God you are a nature of God and you take on the things and you want to see the moving of God and you want to see God move because you are his son and you are made in His image and you are born of his spirit you a part of him then you got faith for anything Hallelujah may be seated notice from the beginning Satan has been so close is religious people back to the Garden of Eden continued baac fundamental Believers 2 Timothy 13 1-8 quote having a form of God but they deny the power thereof then brother Brown's getting anointed Hallelujah he said there is any beginning there's in the Middle Ages and there's that same group of fundamental Believers that put Jesus on the cross and killed him because he had signs and wonders they didn't believe it that same Spirit lives among the churches today and it lives in this message today a religious people not a bunch of infidels fundamentalists place it right out there exactly and they have the form of godliness fundamentally right but denying the power there of the power of God the power of healing the power of shouting the power speaking in tongues the power interpretation the power of God moving just like in the beginning and brother sister We are continuing for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints Hallelujah you believe it continue for the faith and about that time the people started shouting and he said you think this is a noisy Bunch if there ain't no noise there ain't no God there Hallelujah there you are well there you are Church oh hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus amen did you get it that's the faith that's where you are I'm going to take a rest do you need me you don't need me I can rest now you know what it is it's laying on the tapes low ha is seed for you you may be seated hallu low hair is seed for you June 3rd 1988 1/5 for Pharaoh 1/5th for your food and you ate from 888 to 92 and 1/5 to sew and now it's time for you to seow them same seeds into your soul patience virtue knowledge godliness brotherly kindness amen same tapes same ones and there one5 for your children same baptism of the Holy Ghost glory to God Amen so there's no excuse for nobody in here amen it's on video it's live it's whatever you want it's up to [Music] you it's according to your faith be it unto you amen may be seated you got it so the two messages are June 7th earnestly intended for the faith restored back by Malachi 4 June 7th bring in the intelligence July 4th bring in the faith and nobody there had it cuz come off of a tape from 1953 I think and the book was somewhere else the book come out later so hallelujah [Music] amen so the faith is the opening of the word amen and then uh uh no noise no God and uh then July 3rd the Seven Seals of redemption is Ephesians that Ephesians made made manifest and that closes it out once we get back to Ephesians then it's over we're here we're back to the Bible then we can read from Ephesians and all scripture is given by inspiration for reproof for instruction for correction then that means that I can correct you by the word [Applause] huh sister brother I can sit you down in the room say now according to the word you're not walking right I couldn't do that for the last 5 years that's why I didn't bother amen but we're here now okay praise the Lord I'm still uh I don't know whether I should maybe just finish off right here why not amen praise God I'm trying to nail this thing down here okay on a a paradox and I was reading there from page 19 and's speaking about all scriptures got to be fulfilled and now friends I believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever I believe he just is able this afternoon to cause in this building of paradox because that he promised it would happen how much more has he promised how much more is it uh leaning in the Bible to this very age that we're living in Ephesians again of the church ages we got seven Church ages and we promis that at the layout of cing church age are we here well at that time not Philadelphia saw this no le out AA we promis when that strikes then there would be another Ephesians oh we're here another Ephesians amen amen that's right and what may be seated and we are here I believe with all my heart the Jesus Christ who made the promise oh brother go what what what can you say brother we in Ephesians man yes sir I'm just bringing this back so you get it amen page 26 here amen uh page 26 here it says here uh now if he'll uh uh oh yeah he he was getting ready to do the discernment then he says Paradox now if he'll do that for you between you and I talking about discernment see uh uh see so that uh so that the audience not for show but that they might see the Ephesus is here so brother Bram call discernment Ephesus he called the healing Ephesus yes do you understand oh Hallelujah that Ephesus is here when he would say John Jones then they all would know as [Applause] Ephesus Ephesians see that this is the thing that Bridges between denomination lead AA and the glory land he promises that they might be assured that what we telling is the truth how many believe it to be the truth the congregation says amen sure he know every time he bad an eye he's infinite God just think by his grace he has presented with his gospel the same thing he promised to do then there's a heaven and we're going to it and we're in this Ephesus right now we in this coming out of one and into another Hallelujah do you believe it so I conclude that another emphasis is here I say our third phase has hooked into Malachi for third pull the opening of the word which is Ephesus and in Ephesus the faith will be preached signs wonders Miracles adoption prophetic my my Hallelujah may be seated the Seven Seals of redemption is that Ephesians made manifest for when omnipotence speaks the miraculous does take place now how many of them can figure that one out the third you mean the Seven Seals seven THS is is that is uh is that that's the Ephesians they don't understand that they never will amen well praise God I'll try to go a little bit okay it won't be long amen shall We [Applause] Stand brother blma give me a key over here for I would not be tonight brother blma I'm kind of lost my voice here I got too much strength but

years to get to this spot and we're here yes sir glory to God we don't know what's going to happen but we know anything to happen I mean anything yes sir I'm reading from Ephesians 1 Ephesians 3 and Ephesians uh 6 Ephesians 13 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world uh that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen over to the 6th chapter verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole arm of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we rest not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rules of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole arm of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins GED about with truth and having on the Blessed breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and to take the helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit which is the word of God may God a blessing the read of his word hallelujah shall we bow our heads our heavenly father you told me to take time to nail down the faith Amen on the third phase I believe it's been done I don't have much strength Lord he told me to say for a few moments uh Ephesian that I must start it here on the third phase in Ephesians almighty God they're a little weary and tired now so sweep their tiess off of them ignite their souls with fire amen and open the visitors understanding and Lord while I'm speaking English May the Spanish speaking people understand English or Spanish amen father anything can happen you can cause a paradox in this room this morning this afternoon Lord God pour out the Holy Spirit

the Dynamics are here and Pen Harris meeting proved this along with the five evidences correct then let's earnestly contend for the faith that rest restored back by Malachi 4 and let's put on the whole arm of god let's stop playing around praise God and put it on because it's here now couple of questions you may be seated what is the whole arm of God and what is the arm of God made out of Amen

I don't care what happened in your home what's going on there whether you don't have the Holy Ghost now I'm talking about today [Music] today amen what the situation is God will perform another paradx to keep his word God gave his word to Abraham take your son up there and and and he said slay him amen that correct and then Abraham got there was ready to slay him and God calls a paradox because Abraham has said I in the land will return and it was nothing so Abraham said God can do it hold your hand Abraham there's a ram in the bush so God caused a paradox put a lamb in a bush to keep his word that Abraham and his son would return I lose none and God can cause a paradox to here and baptize you with the Holy Ghost in fire Hallelujah I don't care what you what happened to you amen you may be seated what about Joshua page 17 here's Joshua we speaking of how that that man amen just an ordinary man that just come through a group of Creeds that the man had formed laws and ceremonies
