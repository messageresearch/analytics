TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Revelation the first chapter in revelation 22 just thought I'd talk to you a little bit tonight amen didn't know I was going to be here didn't even know I was going to have a prayer meeting amen but the Holy Spirit kind of worked it around so I had three meetings that I didn't think I was going to have right when you you are the tiredest it's when the Lord test you to stretch out amen so I know amen so praise the Lord Revelation 1 first verse the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy just to read it you're blessed just to herit your blessing and then now the third thing and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand in Revelation 22: 10 and he saith unto me seal not the Saints of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be amen may God add a blessing to the

Shu lot the penny is finished God separated the p amen they gone finished end time evangelism amen glory is finished praise God now you can see what in evening time evangelism is going to be what is it the ones that carry it is going to be called crazy the prophet the ones that bring on the Thunders is going to be called crazy amen they'll be so different I'm reading it they won't be like the other guys they only left over from the Pentecostal age trying to be sweet for them TI they was in Noah's time they was in every time put out of their churches because they believe in Jesus anybody listened to him had to be excommunicated from their Church see but he had that dispensation that was his time the son's dispensation now you know if God didn't start this church in my home and they had brought me in I've been put out a long time [Applause] ago but nobody here can put me out Hallelujah that's why it started in my house you mean you get out praise God hallelujah [Applause] glory to God God knows what he's doing ain't no church demon going to put me out of anywhere hallelujah praise God Amen here we are you may be seated now we find also that the great Holy Spirit prophesied of that you want to put some of these scriptures down Matthew 24 and then put 2 Timothy 3:1 the Holy Spirit speaks of a great intellectual age at the end time did you know that why is it do youall finally understand what I'm talking about this age was prophesied to be here in [Music] [Applause] 1946 they would be waiting for God judged Pentecost but World War II and these leftover Pentecostal Spirits would be here in 1946 then God would send the seed that's hid in the Shu the Seven Seals then that seed would have three pulls healing then that second pull I'm identified with the prophet my second pull is identified with his second pull for he blasted pain to face Jezebel's he blasted bullheaded women he blasted lazy preachers he blasted filth and Bunko Gams and card parties and TVs and ungodliness fornication adulterers he bless and so did I ask him I'm identified praise God therefore that's the anointing that's the spirit Hallelujah that's my spirit I hate sin praise God see you don't know the word praise God then when that third pull come in was God failed so humble and simple it went right by hope I don't go by you praise God may be seated amen praise God there we are the prophecy amen page 122 well the same thing to day if a man preaches these things and doesn't happen then it's wrong because the scripture said yes sir friends I'm building here amen now they're church members having a form of God uh but what denying the power thereof having a form of God but say God doesn't do these things see there's no power to it you just accept and do this see no change of life no nothing they come in here and still they're still homosexuals they're still fornicators do you finally understand what I'm talking about they're still carnal still worldly they never got changed and that's been the trouble in this church they want to come in here with their filth from the street and expect me to believe it and accept it praise God [Applause] amen amen oh I started to say something forget about the negative stuff they didn't finish anyway amen having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away I turn away from them they lie brother when they begin to lie on you turn your back and walk away from them praise God for this is a s that go from house to house and leads silly women Laden with sins divers lust for this and Lust For That amen and these kind of guys come along that's exactly what the Bible said now we're living exactly in that age but do thou the work of evangelist make full proof of proof of your ministry here we are now by these Messengers and witnesses that we see we find out what crop we in amen look what crop you're in this morning look what crop we in why he said on this side these signs will be falling them that believe they'll be mocked and scof that like in the days of Noah and here will come this other group back here making fun of them heady and high-m minded and having a form of godliness now which group are you in are you with Noah or the other group what group you think I'm in praise God hey mind having a form of godliness and denying the very thing that you're professing they deny the very seven Thunders and sit right here and they went out they say they beli it but they went out how can somebody be in Elohim and go out praise God oh my denying of everything you're possessing professing and you can see what CPP you in these two messages of the day Jesus foretold that that would be Satan with his message and then Christ messenger would have this point these signs should follow them that believe and Satan's Messengers would be having a form of godliness is that clear you mean that these people nice men and women were Satan's Messengers right in here and eat the same food you eat and praise the Lord and sang and paid the ties but Satan's Messengers from Heaven they were deceived way back there and their bodies The Same Spirit uh uh the the bodies leave the Earth in the seven Church ages but the same Spirits stay here in the church then they anoint people they come in sweet crying and praying and they look like Christians but when it comes down to the end they anointed Satan's Messengers and God's Messengers stand against him praise God and His messenger would have would be having a form of godliness his Messengers would have these signs taking up serpents drinking deadly things casting out Devils laying hands on the sick receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost signs and wonders now we in one of the crops and we at the end time oh praise God so where we at do you know what I'm saying Michael dropped down praise God and Sunday morning Sunday night and Wednesday night separated Church caral from church [Applause] spiritual church cinal is separated amen that David Michael dropped down he chopped the enemy the ribbons The Headstone and the pride Cried Out Grace Grace To The Headstone amen and Sunday night the people shouted amen as commanded by Joshua that

January 12th 1979 amen seemed like it was out of season but the hours here now amen dream started with brother Joe and myself sitting talking to brother Coleman and brother Coleman told brother Joe you look very tired do you uh want to rest from leading songs he said no I'm I'm fine he looked at me and said uh do do you want Joel to stop leading songs for a while asked the wife so he could be

the Lord will bless you is what I said for having the right attitude my my all at once I felt myself speaking with others encouraging others and the Lord was blessing for I had found my place but I noticed uh it was no more brother keman it was Jesus placing us 1979 and now Joshua you think it's me placing elders and Deacon no no the dream said it was [Applause] Jesus oh that's what happened in the music section in the tape room and there [Applause] Jesus praise God it was Jesus placing us he left us and went to others and started to place each person in his own place or position what an hour did you catch the revelation right attitude there's the Revelation Oh My My My but they're thinking now so what had happened when brother n had said there's many here need to repent I felt a kind of flatness and the Holy Spirit they come back in here and tell them that the pyramid is rebuilt I said brother Nino I say you you cannot take those Church Spirits they are finished so when you uh put them back and tell them to repent then you're taking us back two or three years then I got to start all over again repent come on please and do this here no we're [Applause] finished you don't want to take me back there to you we do you know what I'm saying we are finished no more no more NOA NOA never again do we have to go back to that it's gone it's finished it's over with the church spirit is dead carnality is dead God Michael busted the thing and ask them to repent tell them straighten up in 30 days or God will pack you out of hell I ain't ask him to come to the altar to repent praise God wake up is finished [Applause] with my ask nobody to sing don't ask them to sing brother Joel sing they don't want to sing the pews will cry out amen Smur Church age page 189 may be seated God never intended a church to be run by man God runs his church he runs it through gifts of the Spirit you understand now the gift is a word the Bible says Pastor then that's a word here that's in the Bible then the Holy Spirit can get a hold of a man who has the gift of the pastor in him then the Holy Spirit Will Minister according to that gift not the man it is the gift in a man and the Holy Spirit getting a hold that man if he's right then God can use him not a compromiser afraid of the church or the deacons of somebody Glory the gift of spirit in the church WIll to correct the spirit see he put the past here to correct the [Applause] bullheads you understand now to correct these unruly Brothers running all over the place to put the paste to Cor cor them say line up here brother amen the gift of spirit in the church is to correct the spirit he's got five ministerial offices in his church first of them is Apostles or missionaries and missionaries is the highest calling there is is hired then a prophet in the 5f ministry Paul said so Corinthians he said first apostles then prophets then teachers then miracle workers so one of you Brothers here can be a miracle worker for I know I don't know we're going to find out soon when he places you my brother Nelson like that one there praise God brother Nelson might be a miracle worker I don't know praise God brother Nelson amen trying to encourage you amen see missionar is the highest calling there is Apostle the word a missionary means one sent sent with a message sent with a revelation to do something and speak something and the whole world hate you hated the apostles praise God oh praise the Lord Apostle means one sent why they ever chose to be called a missionary I don't know but they are Apostles all right Apostles prophets teachers evangelist and pastors now that's the elected officers of God to his church then there Elders of course and and and they ordained by the pastor whoever but nobody ordains theine for Ministry God does so nobody can put their hand on the pastor then in each local church there's nine spiritual gifts that come from the people that come among the people that is knowledge and wisdom and Gifts of healing and working on Miracles and speaking with tongues and interpretation of tongues and all these things go in each local church and every person in the church has an individual Ministry and that individual Ministry goes together with the rest of the ministry to edify the body of Christ amen so there we are you believe that see what the five for Ministry is the anointed word in the church your life proves um proves Messiah is here by the word anointed in you amen and God confirms it to be his word that's the Messiah you are a messiah the anointed word in you is a messiah for this thing Messiah means anointed anointed one and you are Messiah s the anointed ones of the word that's the wife of Messiah and God places in the pride of five-fold ministry to keep that messiahship or the headship straight now the Messiah is here the prophet revealed Messiah the prophet left and left Messiah here then God call some a fire for Ministry to keep Messiah straight in the church otherwise after the prophet left you seen what happened until seven Thunders thundered then it kept it straight around the world [Applause] straight everybody was doing fine until Messiah be to place somebody somebody's oh praise God glory they said white horses tense anything they want to say any Doctrine did what they want to do but when it thundered shut up get in there keep quiet you Bullhead you you sonite must keeping Messiah straight glory to God it keeps it straight make sure it don't mix with nothing and it chops the weeds out and the Shu Spirits chops it right out of there and keeps the thing pure and on adulterated to Christ in his word you may be seated see the words in the church in the person to anoint the message of Malachi 4 amen the Seven Seals with the messiahship or the headship the prop message the Seven Seals but therefore then he the words in the person and that person can walk out and anoint Messiah can anoint it anoint means to Quicken it the prophet laid de dead laid the Messiah he told me in St Martin 1975 he says anoint charity and bring it down so I call it down right here in New York City for this saying I anointed it seven Thunder of Faith anoints charity and brought it down February 23rd 1975 it's been here ever since then I had to keep it straight in here Messiah was here but I had to keep his Messiah ship or his headship stength and what a ble that was like to wipe me out to keep it straight oh my keep the headship The Headstone straight and not take it back to the lips of Pentecost keep the head Glory keep it straight see the fire for ministry will rightly divide the word and God will confirm you by signs wonders and miracles oh praise God book of symbols praise God page 11 let me finish up here just want to kind of put the thing in order amen that's what I'm doing you know putting it in order amen praise God Amen page 11 Revelation book of symbols page paragraph 58 your pastor when he stands here on the platform ministering the word of God he is God's angel to the church Messenger to the church therefore pastor should never leave that word but stay straight with the word because he's feeding the Sheep straight because that the word pastor means Shepherd look it up amen and find out if that ain't right a pastor is a shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him over say over his church and flock to feed them what with the word of God Amen now page 14 here we are let get ready to close out here now try it down for climax blessed is he that readeth Revelation 13 page 14 paragraph 77 Revelation book of symbols and they that hear the word of the prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand oh my if we could just go into it right now look when is the time at
