[4:11] many in in in the message running up and
[4:14] down with all kind of uh ideas of what
[4:17] they supposed to do for the
[4:18] Lord but if brother Bram told a brother

[4:25] somewhere and he says well that's fine
[4:27] Brother go ahead the Lord be with you
[4:30] no he said when I get to thinking about
[4:32] my wife and children he said well now if
[4:34] you want to wait on the Lord God will do
[4:37] more with you in 5
[4:40] minutes than what you can do in a
[4:43] lifetime now we're speaking to those
[4:45] people who are willing from this day on
[4:47] to wait on the
[4:48] [Music]
[4:50] Lord he showed you already Sunday what
[4:53] he can
[4:54] do in 5 minutes he shows you he Save
[4:58] Somebody and heal a in 5 minutes
[5:03] and we didn't have anything to do with
[5:04] that at all he did it himself but we
[5:06] have the joy that the word goes out in
[5:08] New York City this was done so we stand
[5:11] there praise the Lord amen there we are
[5:14] see he give us the credit for doing
[5:18] it amen see that's that's Christ
[5:21] directed
[5:22] service that's what we're trying to
[5:24] separate today this this is of what you
[5:26] want to do and what he wants to wait to
[5:28] do that he do through you God wants to
[5:31] do a work through Sanctified
[5:33] vessel he wants to do it himself see and
[5:37] then turn around and give you a reward
[5:40] for what he
[5:42] did but if you only
[5:45] wait but they can't wait all these years
[5:47] since' 65 they the men had to run out
[5:50] couldn't wait and now God is
[5:54] moving amen see now what was Christ
[5:57] doing in St John 21
[6:00] he he was uh uh um um here he was in P
[6:03] John 20 faith and virtue knowledge and
[6:06] now he's bringing in Temperance now
[6:07] praise God now what do you do for God
[6:10] with the first three virtues see now
[6:14] right now he wants us to die out to our
[6:16] self will or we stop going fishing what
[6:19] because we're asking him first about
[6:22] it or we stop doing what you want to do
[6:24] before praying about it that's what
[6:27] we're talking about this morning see now
