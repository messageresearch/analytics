========================================
on the breach page 112 brother Brown said these words and I caught this years ago and if I call it the revelation time he page 112 breach that's now in the time of the revelation of these things these things being made manifest I mean being made known did you catch that he called himself the time of the revelation page 112 then if that be so then the ellingham revelation watch starts the jubilee by liberating you that's why you worship because you liberated you're liberated from where you come from you're liberated from Caribbean from this place and from that place where everywhere be liberated well act like you're free where is God amen how are you liberated how are you liberated one you know who God is - you know who you are three you know who Satan News so you liberated [Applause] now

manifestation are you worshiping because your name is in the book and then it because number two to seven thunders then this Holy Spirit seals those who know who they are because you can only be sealed or reborn if he was there in the back part of elohim's mind so if you know that then it's time for you to be sealed [Applause] amen okay now watch this I'm almost finished here revelation he sent me here to do this I said he sent me here to do this [Applause] [Music] now relevant five a through fourteen relates to Saint Luke 24:49 through 53 so what happened here revelation of who you are and so forth come and a revelation of worship come then what happened then on the tenth day that won't come the Holy Spirit so one sticks it happened here now what's fixing to happen now the Holy Spirit but she was not in condition so God in His grace August 7th told me to play back where was dojo and then he opened your understanding up with a revelation of worship so now comes the outpouring of the Holy Spirit [Applause] which we could not have because the people had no revelation of worship [Applause] I tried all I could but it took God to do it himself amen so now revelation five day through 14 watch now what what's going on here now Berlocq Holman the silence that was put over revelation that I mean put over the seventh seal revelation 8:1 that silence is broken it's broken no more silence no more silence praise glory hallelujah [Applause] this is worship time for king lamb hallelujah the salars is broken no more silence worst room [Applause] amen now this is worship time for king lamb number one this is the time angels worship God everything hushed up silence but now we're coming to Revelation come now Mel ahem now just a worship time yes sir number two the elders worship Him number three living creatures worship Him and John representing a bride worshiped him now is the manifestation of the jubilee worship to King Lamb the Jubilee is on there be another day of Jubilee now notice Ole Miss said revelation 5 1814 a manifestation worship precedes the baptism of the Holy Ghost no worship no holy ghost [Applause] they are okay in the manifestation of revelation 5 religion 5 1 through 7 is mechanics in revelation relation 5 1814 manifestation now you worship because of the Elohim inspiration allows you because of the of the revelation of being attributed allows you to be reborn so you worship because God is your God and you know who you are and therefore you enter into the manifestation of revelation 5 8 through 14 and it took God to do it he did it August 7 and he did it back there in Saint Luke 24 45:49 he had to open up their understanding he had to open up your understanding August the 7th so if you're worshiping then you are ready for the dynamics of revelation 5 8 through 14 now catch me in here now catch me and the middle part of the seventh seal [Applause] okay I believe all you know that the Seventh Seal is a three-fold mystery and he looked under the 7c when it opened he saw he heard rather a banging seven times seven thunders he looked to see a way to win and went into unknown tones so I asked you a question could these three full seventh seal could that tie in to one two three four sixteen [Applause] shall force Trump Jesus does all three justice blowing here now are we connecting now in the middle part okay here we go number one shout seven seals seven thunders what is that that represents your soul but there's a seed in the soul my my number two voice of the Archangel this represents your spirit [Applause] I should put it this way the Seventh Seal maybe understand this way is the claiming seal say they got it done it claims you it claims your soul they might claim your spirit I'm going to claim your body [Applause] okay Brian amen say you got it now shout seven seven thunders the word seed in your soul and it claims that attribute in there it calls you calls you out a layout of Cielo call you out everywhere now we entered into part two voice of the Archangel and now we have our spirits imagination and memory affection conscience of reasoning so what happens now Ellingham comes back down to horizontal rainbow and the set LEM has said made up of seven spirits seven spirits coming from your theophany this law seven spirits coming from your theophany because your theophany is sending messages to you come on now come on it's time it's time I want to meet you in the resurrection come on you're theophany [Applause] so the theophany is the nature of the spirit and it has seven spirits to it so elohim comes back as dynamic in the form of seven spirits and seven rainbows coming from your theophany to form you into the word image to be ready for the third part top of God your body [Applause] you got it now the Seventh Seal is the claiming seal claims your soul the seed in your soul spirit and body and 1 Thessalonians 5:23 and I'm closing now and a very God of peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be watch listen be preserved blameless you never did it in the first place he whom he called he pressed a predestinated he called him justified you glorified you you're already glorified and he himself come down as a seventh seal to claim you so he's doing the work of redemption now through the word and now he's coming down to claim your body with a fire baptism for the resurrection [Applause] so watch this and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless watch until the unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ well what is 110 stories 4:16 we are in the coming of the Lord Jesus plan and we are blameless you're already there so that all you gotta do now is begin the worship amen [Applause]
