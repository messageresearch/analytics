[0:00] So now um we know that we're going
[0:03] through trials and tribulations and
[0:07] adversities but by the help of God we
[0:10] want to show you that these are actually
[0:12] good
[0:14] but we got to do it in the word. Amen.
[0:17] Praise the Lord. Now the message is in
[0:19] found in Philippians the 3rd chapter the
[0:22] 7th verse through the 15th verse and
[0:25] Hebrews
[0:28] the 12th chapter verses 1 and 2
[0:40] reading from Philippians first
[0:46] the third chapter.
[0:49] Seventh verse.
[0:51] But what things were gained to me? Those
[0:55] I counted loss for Christ. Yay.
[0:58] Doubtless. And I count all things but
[1:00] loss for the excellency see of the
[1:03] knowledge of Jesus of Christ Jesus my
[1:06] Lord.
[1:08] For whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:11] things. and do count them but dong, that
[1:14] I may win Christ, and be found in him,
[1:17] not having mine own righteousness, which
[1:20] is of the law, but that which is through
[1:22] the faith of Christ. See, the
[1:26] righteousness which is of God by faith,
[1:31] that I may know him,
[1:33] this is one thing that we want to
[1:35] strike. and the power of his
[1:37] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:39] sufferings, being made conformable unto
[1:42] his death, if by any means I might
[1:44] attain unto the resurrection of the
[1:46] dead. We understand this to mean out
[1:49] from the dead in the first resurrection
[1:51] the bride. Not as though I have I had
[1:54] already attained, either were already
[1:56] perfect, but I follow after, if that I
[1:59] may apprehend, that for which also I am
[2:02] apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I
[2:05] count not myself to have apprehended,
[2:07] but this one thing I do, forgetting
[2:10] those things which are behind, and
[2:13] reaching forth unto those things which
[2:14] are before,
[2:16] I press toward the mark for the prize of
[2:20] the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[2:23] Let us therefore, as many as be perfect,
[2:27] this means as many as be mature, grown
[2:30] up, full grown, be thus minded, have
[2:33] this mind.
[2:34] And if in anything you be otherwise
[2:37] minded, God shall reveal even this unto
[2:39] you. If you have any other purpose for
[2:42] following Jesus Christ and not the
[2:44] purpose of being perfected, God, he'll
[2:46] reveal to you that this is the message.
[2:48] Wherefore, seeing
[2:51] we also are compassed about with so
[2:54] great a cloud of witnesses those gone on
[2:56] before us, let us lay aside every weight
[3:00] and the sin which not so easy beset us.
[3:02] And let us run with patience the race
[3:05] that is set before us. looking unto
[3:07] Jesus, the author and finisher of our
[3:10] faith, who for the joy that was set
[3:13] before him, endured the cross, despising
[3:16] the shame, and is sat down at the right
[3:18] hand of the throne of God. May God a
[3:21] blessing to reading of his word.
[3:25] Um, I like to title this the way of the
[3:27] cross.
[3:29] And, uh, it may be in two parts. I don't
[3:31] know. I have some things that the Lord's
[3:33] saying this morning. It'll just be one.
[3:35] Uh to me I like to get another part out
[3:37] of this fellowship of his sufferings.
[3:40] But you can't say everything at once.
[3:41] See? So I want to show is my purpose
[3:45] this morning to show you what you're
[3:47] doing now. See? And then let you know
[3:50] what you're getting ready to do. See?
[3:52] And then when you know the will of God,
[3:53] then you got faith in what you're doing.
[3:55] But if you're all jangled up, then you
[3:57] don't know where you're going. Then you
[3:58] add his mercy, Satan's mercy. Then he
[4:00] got you. See you. And he sort of buffing
[4:02] you around then. Okay. But we want to
[4:04] know the word of God. Now, um
[4:09] um the message, the way of the cross.
[4:12] Now, um
[4:15] Paul is saying here in in the book of
[4:17] Hebrews, get a little drink of water.
[4:20] Thank you.
[4:27] He says, "Looking unto Jesus."
[4:30] Now, that's the starting point. Excuse
[4:32] me. Right there.
[4:35] Looking unto Jesus. One of the the
[4:37] message that that brother Brandon
[4:38] preached when he was about to go away in
[4:40] ' 63. Look away to Jesus. Make sure of
[4:44] what you're looking for. What is your
[4:46] aim in life? What is your desire? See,
[4:49] is it Jesus
[4:51] or is it mixed? Part of the world and
[4:54] part of Jesus. See, do you want to live
[4:57] at the source of all things? See,
[5:00] because things that are made was made by
[5:03] that which is unseen, which is the word.
[5:06] So some people can only live a
[5:08] Christians out on the circumference
[5:11] where they can see things. But the real
[5:14] source is at the core. Other words, if
[5:18] you have gold out here, see? Well, you
[5:20] don't have to go out there and pay for
[5:22] it out there. Go to the source where it
[5:24] come from because he made it. Amen. Is
[5:27] that right? and he's able to make
[5:29] anything else. Amen. Amen. So then when
[5:32] you can get to the core from where it
[5:34] come from, see then you can live by
[5:37] faith and ask God by faith. Now so
[5:42] therefore we are looking unto Jesus. He
[5:44] is the author and the finisher. He is
[5:48] the perfector of our faith.
[5:52] He is the author being he is the leader
[5:55] and the source sir of our faith it is
[5:59] only by him given the first incentive
[6:04] amen for our belief if he don't come and
[6:08] put it there you can't believe he must
[6:10] put it there and so he begins with a
[6:14] little seed and that little seed comes
[6:16] into light strikes it it comes alive
[6:20] unto God. Amen. But he is also the
[6:24] finisher. Yes, sir. He's the one, nobody
[6:27] else, that can bring that seed of faith,
[6:30] Amen. into maturity, into perfection.
[6:34] Amen. See, now Christ has already
[6:39] conquered
[6:40] and he lives in us as a conqueror. Yes,
[6:45] sir. So, we can put it straight. We want
[6:47] Satan to know that we know this.
[6:50] Amen. So we know where we're standing
[6:52] at. Amen. Now Christ lives in us
[6:56] and works by his promises for us. Amen.
[7:02] Get it? Now he lives in us. See? Then
[7:06] when he goes to work, he can't go
[7:08] through our flesh works. He can only go
[7:10] through the promise lay out in the
[7:12] Bible. Then if we can believe these
[7:14] promises, see, like in prayer, you come
[7:17] together in prayer, you begin to
[7:19] meditate and and find the will of God
[7:22] and then you check out what you're
[7:24] asking for to see if it's in the Bible
[7:27] to see if your situation happened to
[7:28] somebody back there in the Bible. It's
[7:30] four types examples. When you see your
[7:33] child cuz it's in the Bible, you say,
[7:36] "Well, Lord, God is there." Amen. Now I
[7:39] come in prayer for it and I ask in faith
[7:42] because it's there in the Bible. Amen.
[7:44] See, it's a Bible prayer there and you
[7:47] ask for it and he'll do it. It's in the
[7:50] word. Amen. Praise the Lord. So now
[7:53] God's purpose today.
[7:56] God is trying to find someone, an
[7:58] individual, anybody that he can confirm
[8:02] himself through. Hallelujah. See, that
[8:06] others might see that he lives.
[8:10] The resurrected corn of wheat is living
[8:13] somewhere.
[8:15] See, and he can only live by
[8:18] resurrection power for in weakness
[8:21] because he was crucified. See, and then
[8:24] Christ, now think of it, is only living
[8:28] by the power of God. Mhm. See, the only
[8:32] way he can live exists today, Jesus
[8:34] Christ, is to live by God's power. See,
[8:37] and that's the power that he wants to
[8:40] pour through you. But it can't come in
[8:42] until you die.
[8:45] That's the law of the spiritual harvest.
[8:47] Something must die for you to live. See,
[8:50] it's got to be that way. So, you got to
[8:52] die to yourself here. Then you can live
[8:55] by the power of his resurrection.
[8:58] Hallelujah. No, that is the only way. So
[9:01] now the trouble today that there is a
[9:04] lack of authority of faith. There's a
[9:07] lack of God's people to step out boldly
[9:10] and say Christ is in me. Get back Satan.
[9:14] They're afraid to say that for some
[9:16] reason. They believe that they are
[9:18] joined by one spirit. They say so is in
[9:21] the Bible.
[9:23] A God's prophet has come and preached a
[9:25] mighty message, spiritual union of the
[9:27] bride. Amen. And yet they still don't
[9:30] because appropriate that for themselves.
[9:32] See? Amen. Because the devil has told
[9:36] them that by a strong illusion that
[9:39] you're separated from him in a state of
[9:42] separation. Yes. Uh uh you are in
[9:45] heavenly places sometime in church.
[9:48] Or maybe when you get a spirit of
[9:50] prayer. Amen. See amen. He tells you,
[9:52] "Oh, sure. You're in heavenly places
[9:53] there." But not when you're outside
[9:55] walking up down. Because in the carnal
[9:57] you're not there no more. He separated.
[9:59] He's alive. For Christ is in you. Amen.
[10:03] Paul said it is not I but Christ liveth
[10:05] in me. Hallelujah. So does he stop
[10:07] living when you go out in the world for
[10:09] a while? Does he go away somewhere? No.
[10:12] He abides right there. Amen. See, God
[10:17] has a way he works. He don't change. The
[10:19] father thinks the thoughts. The son
[10:23] speaks the thoughts by faith. Jesus. And
[10:25] the Holy Spirit brings it to pass. Amen.
[10:28] Amen. Jesus Christ could walk. The
[10:31] father thought it. And whatever it was,
[10:34] blindness or death or whatever it was,
[10:37] the son know it's got to be done. So he
[10:40] gives thanks to the father. I thank you,
[10:42] heavenly father. Then he speaks the word
[10:44] by faith. Amen. Amen. That same Jesus
[10:48] Christ is abiding in you right now.
[10:51] Amen. He is the one Joshua. Amen. That
[10:55] that steps forward. That's the faith.
[10:59] When you see a person moving forward,
[11:00] it's not is Joshua in him moving
[11:03] forward. Amen. Cuz the son is the one
[11:06] who speaks the word. He said, "Let there
[11:08] be." Amen. The son says, "Let there be."
[11:11] Amen. Amen. Holy Spirit bring it to
[11:13] pass. So therefore we see then that our
[11:17] spiritual vitality
[11:19] is sapped at the roots through failure
[11:23] to boldly grasp this fact this truth.
[11:27] Christ is in you when now we look back
[11:30] to his atoning work. We say well yes
[11:32] because we were saved in 19 so and so
[11:34] and so see and we know I'll be caught up
[11:37] to meet him. That's at the end. But what
[11:40] is he doing now? That's it. You see amen
[11:43] now. But right now, you just fall down
[11:45] then. But you got faith enough to look
[11:47] back and faith to look forward. But what
[11:50] about right now?
[11:52] See, he want now. Are you the sons of
[11:55] God? Not going to be, but now.
[11:59] Now possess the possessions in the land.
[12:02] Jesus, do it now. Right now. He has a
[12:05] spiritual law. Your feet must stand on
[12:08] the spot. Amen. The souls of your feet
[12:11] must stand there. Well, then you got to
[12:13] do something. Not your own works, but he
[12:16] must be leading. He is the one who leads
[12:18] the victory. Is that right? Now, he's
[12:21] here now. Joshua and them were there.
[12:24] And when they get ready to move forward,
[12:26] there was somebody standing there, the
[12:28] unseen captain. Right. Of the host.
[12:31] Nay, are you for us or you against us?
[12:34] Nay, I'm the captain of the host. I'm
[12:36] right here with you, but you won't see
[12:37] me. Amen. Amen. It's the Holy Spirit.
[12:40] He's right there. He's here now. But for
[12:43] this time and season where you must have
[12:45] faith, you don't see him right now, but
[12:48] he's doing something mighty and
[12:49] powerful. Amen. He is the son. Now, the
[12:51] prophet said, "So, lay in the sun."
[12:54] Therefore, he's got to be here. He's
[12:55] here. Amen. So, now our spiritual
[13:00] vitality is sapped at the root. See,
[13:03] through failure to grasp that he's in us
[13:06] now. Amen.
[13:08] Now we drive that home. See, we have
[13:11] this spiritual union now. See, because
[13:15] it was uh snapped way back there because
[13:18] through Adam. See, because Adam died in
[13:21] the spirit to God. See, and then he was
[13:25] resurrected in the flesh to Satan. Is
[13:27] that right? Somebody has has got to come
[13:30] forth and he did Christ to die in the
[13:32] flesh and Satan and be resurrected back
[13:35] to God. Amen. And we do the same thing.
[13:38] Praise the Lord. See, now now watch.
[13:41] Now, um, here is the era, the era. Satan
[13:47] makes it appear by a strong delusion
[13:51] that we are separated right now. So, we
[13:54] say we are sitting in heavenly places up
[13:57] there. That right? See, but he keeps us
[14:00] in a state of separation from Christ
[14:02] here on the earth. But if we up there,
[14:05] he's also down here. He's in us right
[14:07] now. Amen. See, therefore, if we listen
[14:11] to Satan, we are at Satan's mercy. Amen.
[14:15] See, then when a crisis he's come, we
[14:17] are weak because we think he's up there,
[14:20] but he's in you. Amen. And the devil got
[14:23] you. He smiles then. He got you running
[14:25] around. Amen. Because Elder pray for me.
[14:28] Help me. Uh, see, he's right in you.
[14:30] Amen. See, call it upon the name of the
[14:33] Lord. I'm a help, a present help in the
[14:37] time of need. Look to him from which
[14:39] cometh your strength. He's in you.
[14:42] Christ is in you. So when a decision is
[14:44] to be made, you waver because we waver.
[14:48] See, but not realizing. But see, it's
[14:51] through knowledge that we get to know
[14:53] him. Then we know where we're standing
[14:56] at. That's why the word had to come. The
[14:58] Pentecost was all shook up. When a
[15:00] prophet brought that word and brought
[15:03] faith down to us, we know where we're
[15:05] standing at now. Amen. See, so we see
[15:09] our weaknesses and we cry. See, we ask
[15:12] for help from the outside. Now, he says
[15:15] he is the author on the inside, not
[15:19] outside. He's on the inside,
[15:22] not outside. All the power that he has
[15:25] is in you now.
[15:28] Yeah, he said so. That's right. All the
[15:30] power in God's throne is in you now.
[15:33] Right now, but all you have to do is to
[15:36] realize that. See amen now. So now, so
[15:40] therefore, we cast aside our faith. We
[15:43] listen to Satan's suggestions. See, he
[15:46] said, "Well, you know, see, and strong
[15:48] delusion." He said, "Well, because look
[15:50] how you feel." He said, "Well, yeah,
[15:51] that's right, big. I don't feel good,
[15:53] tired." Yeah. See, that's right. See,
[15:56] and he tell you all these things and
[15:57] then you look at the flesh, you look at
[15:59] the uh because your own carnal state.
[16:01] See, so therefore, in a time like this
[16:04] when these strong leaders move in, we
[16:07] are to draw the sword of the spirit and
[16:10] step out boldly and possess our
[16:13] possessions.
[16:15] See, the word is here, the promise, and
[16:18] we come into it. But once we get in
[16:21] there, you got to move forward and take
[16:24] every promise by faith. Joshua and them
[16:28] the type had to take every battle. Now
[16:30] you will fail because they fail and
[16:33] type. You fall down. Satan, he will
[16:37] assault you a thousand times. Yes, sir.
[16:41] Just just remember that now, brother.
[16:43] He's going to come against you. He's not
[16:45] going to believe it cuz he know because
[16:46] you don't believe it yet.
[16:49] So he going to bluff you. Amen. He going
[16:51] to make you prove every every inch of
[16:53] ground you stand on. You won't have to
[16:54] prove it. Yes sir. Praise God. See, so
[16:58] then when we can catch the revelation,
[17:00] we can say we are one with God.
[17:02] Hallelujah. He is divine. I am the
[17:04] branch. His life is flowing through me
[17:07] and I'm strong by faith because he has
[17:09] given me his strength, virtue. Amen.
[17:12] He's given me knowledge and through
[17:14] knowledge, Satan, I know where you at
[17:15] now. The prophet has taught me. Amen.
[17:18] Through knowledge, I know where I'm
[17:20] standing at. Satan, I know that God has
[17:23] called me, has elected me, to come to
[17:27] that place, to get to where I can stand
[17:30] there and know that God is going to add
[17:33] to my faith, virtue, and knowledge and
[17:36] temperance and patience, and godliness,
[17:39] and brotherly kindness, and then the
[17:41] love of God. God said so, Satan. Amen.
[17:44] And he's going to do it. Yes, sir. But
[17:46] Satan said, "Well, you don't feel
[17:47] anything now." That's all right. I also
[17:49] have knowledge that uh the faith is to
[17:51] grow. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise
[17:55] God. That's all right, Satan. Therefore,
[17:57] I'm strong by faith. And Satan, I'm wise
[18:01] because I have his wisdom.
[18:04] Amen. I'm redeemed. I have his
[18:06] redemption. I'm sanctified. I have his
[18:09] sanctification.
[18:10] Get back, Satan. You see him back up. I
[18:14] have love. I have peace. I have joy. I
[18:19] have meekness. Humility. The seed is in
[18:22] me, Satan. I have it now. All I got to
[18:26] do, Sat, is to go forward and put the
[18:28] sword of of the spirit out there. As
[18:31] right now, having now and possessing
[18:34] now. Yes, sir. Amen. Is that right,
[18:36] friends? Yes, sir. Amen.
[18:39] Then when we do that right now now see
[18:43] in the faith works in the spiritual
[18:45] realm. So when faith Christ in you says
[18:49] let that be a minute now in the
[18:51] spiritual realm it begins to happen.
[18:54] Keep on doing it. Keep on doing it. Keep
[18:56] on doing it. Pretty soon it begins to
[18:59] manifest itself out here in the senses.
[19:02] Praise God. Pretty soon love begins to
[19:06] take over emotion. Amen. take over
[19:09] affection. Praise God. Faith begins to
[19:12] take over reason. Amen. The the
[19:15] characters of God take over your own
[19:17] character. Hallelujah. Takes it
[19:18] completely over. Brings every thought,
[19:22] every high thought that exalt against
[19:24] God. Bring it to captivity to the word.
[19:27] Bring all those crazy doctrines, bring
[19:29] it into the word of God. Overpower the
[19:31] thing and choke it to death. Amen.
[19:33] Praise God. That's right. Amen. Cast
[19:36] down all imagination. Amen. Through the
[19:40] word. Who does it? Christ the author,
[19:42] the finisher of our faith. Praise God.
[19:45] Whether it be power, love, joy,
[19:49] knowledge, we possess it. We say, "I got
[19:52] it now." Amen. See, then when we begin
[19:56] to act on it, Christ the head becomes
[19:59] manifest in and through the body.
[20:02] Hallelujah. Then you see him living. I
[20:04] didn't say so. The people have come here
[20:06] and said so. I hope he got there. You
[20:10] maybe you don't see it. They see it. And
[20:13] the Lord knows that you don't see it
[20:15] yet, but he sent a witness. Amen.
[20:19] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Satan is a
[20:22] liar.
[20:24] Amen. And the father of it. Amen. Christ
[20:28] has conquered. Amen. For he said he is
[20:31] the author and the finisher of the
[20:32] faith. Amen.
[20:34] But faith must possess its possessions.
[20:38] My possessions is to be love, peace, and
[20:42] joy and all these things. I have to
[20:44] possess it. See now he says a strong
[20:46] delusion through unbelief.
[20:49] He says that we are carnal right now. He
[20:51] said you're carnal. Satan says so. Now
[20:55] either I can believe through unbelief in
[20:59] the power of evil or I can believe by
[21:02] faith and the power of God. See the
[21:06] power evil
[21:08] then he's stronger than Christ cuz
[21:10] Christ is a strong man that's supposed
[21:12] to come into the house and bind him up.
[21:14] So which power is working? Which which
[21:16] has the strength? Excuse me. So thus
[21:20] Satan say you're carnal. Thus, in actual
[21:23] experience, we feel and we see carnality
[21:28] until we turn our unbelief around. See,
[21:32] and begin to say boldly, be it unto me
[21:36] according to thy word. Amen. Be it unto
[21:40] me according to thy word. Amen. Think of
[21:42] Mary. Now, Gabriel, stand there so that
[21:45] you, Mary, are highly favored. me among
[21:49] all women you Mary Satan said you must
[21:53] be crazy Mary right at the same time see
[21:56] at the same time there's Gabriel
[21:58] speaking a prophetic message you're
[22:01] going to bring forth the Christ his name
[22:02] shall be called wonderful counselor
[22:04] mighty God everlasting father Amen she
[22:08] knew of the scripture she'd read it many
[22:10] times but I'm going to appropriate it to
[22:14] myself I'm going to because apply it to
[22:16] my life seed. Amen. Can I apply it here?
[22:20] Gabbel says yes. Satan says no. So
[22:24] somebody had to move forward. That was
[22:27] the hour. Amen. That was the
[22:30] predestinated second of God that that
[22:33] seed Mary had to speak boldly. Amen. And
[22:36] she said, "Be it unto me according to
[22:38] thy word, God." Amen. When she said
[22:41] that, something unseen
[22:44] be to happen. Amen. Amen. Unseen.
[22:48] God created a blood cell in her womb. At
[22:52] the moment she said, "Be it unto me
[22:54] according to thy word." Holy Spirit, a
[22:56] captain of the host, unseen, begin to
[22:59] brew. Hallelujah. Over in her body,
[23:02] begin to add cell on cell. Amen. Cell to
[23:06] cell, cell until it begin to grow and
[23:08] formed into Jesus Christ. Mary has spoke
[23:12] it boldly by faith. And the bride stands
[23:15] in the same spot. A prophetic message by
[23:18] an angel says, "You are the one. Come
[23:21] out, little eagles. God has called you
[23:23] to bring forth Jesus Christ." Me? Yes.
[23:27] You out of all the Pentecostals. Yes.
[23:29] Baptic message. Yes. God's called you.
[23:31] But my mother was a Pentecost. That's
[23:32] all. He's called you. Amen. Call you as
[23:35] an individual called you up. Amen. So
[23:38] you've got to say, "Be it unto me
[23:40] according to thy word." Sometime before
[23:43] the Holy Spirit can't do one thing until
[23:46] you speak it out. Amen. Be it unto me.
[23:48] Amen. So then we say, "Well, then we are
[23:52] dead." Amen. And our lives is hid with
[23:55] Christ in God. You got to say it now.
[23:58] Yes, sir. See this? Now, this is the
[24:01] dying out on the cross. Of course, this
[24:03] is the law of new life. death, life,
[24:07] death, life. Now you go through your
[24:09] sufferings now, the trials and purges
[24:12] and so forth. See, but now we believe
[24:14] that we are now, now Moses is a type,
[24:17] you know, of this here because one type
[24:20] all believers say God is almighty.
[24:25] God can do this, God can do that, God
[24:28] can do so and so. But how many say God
[24:31] is almighty in me?
[24:35] How many say God can do so and so, God
[24:39] can do this and God can do that in me?
[24:41] How many can say that? How many can say
[24:44] such as I have, I give unto thee, rise
[24:46] up in the name of Jesus Christ? How many
[24:49] can say it? See? Amen. See,
[24:52] there lies the essence
[24:55] of Moses controversy with God at the
[24:58] burning bush. God was saying, "Come now.
[25:02] I will send you down to deliver my
[25:04] people. See, Moses was replying, I
[25:08] believe that you can and that you will
[25:12] do it, but me, I can't do that. Amen.
[25:16] That was Moses. See, now God's power was
[25:19] not in question. For Moses knew that God
[25:22] could do it.
[25:24] But what was in question was whether God
[25:27] would do it through him.
[25:30] Amen. So it is today. What is in
[25:32] question? We know that God can do it
[25:34] because he did it through his prophet.
[25:37] Amen. We seen him do it through his
[25:40] prophet.
[25:42] He believed it. Amen. He had the faith
[25:44] to believe that. You know, many people
[25:46] say, "Well, brother has visions." So for
[25:47] that man had more faith and all was put
[25:49] together. Do you realize in 1962 that he
[25:53] had to go and tell everybody that he was
[25:55] going to open the seven seals? That's
[25:57] exactly right. didn't even have that
[25:59] vision yet because December by faith he
[26:02] said that I'm going to preach on the
[26:04] seven seals way 62 that right by faith
[26:07] he said so then in December he had that
[26:10] great visitation to go out west but by
[26:12] faith he said that there's the key note
[26:16] by faith amen see now it was Moses
[26:21] appropriation and his obedience see of
[26:25] faith that hung in the balance So it is
[26:28] today obedience and whether we will
[26:31] because appropriate what God has said.
[26:35] See? Amen. Now when Moses did go forth.
[26:39] Amen. The scripture says his obituary by
[26:42] faith. Moses crossed the Red Sea. Amen.
[26:46] He did it by faith. By faith. Rahab. By
[26:49] faith. Noah. Everybody did it by faith.
[26:52] Then we must do it by faith. Amen.
[26:56] Because if they would write a little bit
[26:57] longer longer then it would say you was
[27:01] called out by faith. By faith you
[27:05] recognize Christ in his prophet. Amen.
[27:07] By faith you moved out
[27:10] in 63 and four back there cuz the
[27:12] prophet spoke it. You said that is the
[27:15] will of God. I don't know how it going
[27:16] to be. It's going to be amen. The
[27:18] prophet spoke many things. You by faith
[27:21] believed it. Amen. By faith you moved
[27:25] under that anointing. That anointing
[27:27] struck the seed. Deceased. I don't
[27:29] understand it, but I'll stand with him.
[27:32] Be unto me according to thy word, Lord.
[27:35] Amen. You have already moved out. Don't
[27:37] even know it. Anointing come down. Pull
[27:41] thee out of there. Says, "Come on. Come
[27:44] along with me. I'm the unseen captain.
[27:45] You just moving along." Amen. All kind
[27:47] of things happen. You're moving along
[27:48] anyway.
[27:50] and by faith. If they were to add to
[27:52] Hebrews 11, it would say the bride in
[27:55] the end time by faith in the word of God
[27:58] delivered to the prophet move out by
[28:01] faith
[28:03] received a man like because Rebecca back
[28:05] there didn't even know the man but they
[28:07] heard his words. Amen. And they said I
[28:10] will go without even questioning it.
[28:13] Amen. Told her pastor and the church lay
[28:17] banning them. Say, "I will go." Is that
[28:19] right? That's what she did by faith. She
[28:21] did it. See? Amen. So Moses by faith
[28:26] went on down to Israel. He was baptized
[28:29] into the burning bush first, of course,
[28:31] and he met the word of God. Amen. Praise
[28:35] the Lord. So therefore, Moses had all
[28:37] the qualities in him, and then God
[28:40] anointed those qualities at the burning
[28:42] bush. He knew he was supposed to do it.
[28:45] You know, he tried to do it before in
[28:47] the flesh. We've done many flesh works.
[28:51] I'm trying to do it, Lord. That's all
[28:53] right, son. Go ahead. I'm trying to do
[28:55] it, Lord. Go ahead. Amen. See, but one
[28:57] day that anointing strikes it. Then it
[29:00] just falls back. Amen. It knows who it
[29:04] is. I was back there when the sons of
[29:06] God shouted for joy. Praise God. It's
[29:09] being how it's being revealed to you.
[29:11] Wisdom comes to you. See, and wisdom
[29:13] brings understanding. Amen. See,
[29:15] understanding brings you knowledge. And
[29:18] then uh cuz first thing come to your
[29:20] faith is virtue, strength. The next one
[29:22] is knowledge. See, then through
[29:24] knowledge, you say, "Well, all this is
[29:26] for me. You call me God." See, he says,
[29:29] "Yes." And you say, "Well, for the joy."
[29:32] Amen. That's set before me. He's the
[29:35] prophet said that this the future home
[29:37] of the bride, the bride, all these
[29:38] that's joy. That's it. It's set right
[29:40] before you. Amen. Amen. by vision. Amen.
[29:43] It gives you understanding. Then no
[29:45] matter what happens to you, sufferings,
[29:48] trials, persecutions, for the joy that
[29:51] was set before me by the seven seals, I
[29:54] got a vision. Get back, Satan. Get back.
[29:56] Amen. Getting the breath stroke. Amen.
[30:00] Praise the Lord. Amen. You have to swim
[30:02] this breast stroke for a while. Float
[30:04] for a while. We floating right now.
[30:05] Amen. He will quicken the pace soon and
[30:08] you begin to swim. Move on out. Amen.
[30:11] That's now he has anointed your eyes.
[30:15] Eyes is the faith of the under of the
[30:17] understanding. Understanding is the
[30:18] heart. That right. When he brings you
[30:20] through all of these trials like
[30:22] Shadrach and them and Daniel, the first
[30:24] thing you get is wisdom. Understanding.
[30:27] Is that right? See, gives you wisdom
[30:29] first. Wisdom is a revelation of God.
[30:31] And Paul said, "How beat I speak wisdom
[30:33] unto mature people." Is that right? Not
[30:36] to babes. Mature people. Cuz babes take
[30:39] the wisdom and get in the house and get
[30:40] all puffed up. Amen. But mature people
[30:43] sit right there and say, "Glory to God."
[30:47] Just drink it in. Amen. They're growing.
[30:49] They're adding. You add by knowledge.
[30:52] That's why Paul said that I may know
[30:54] him.
[30:55] To know him is eternal life. St. John
[30:59] 17:3. To know him is eternal life. Amen.
[31:04] And then when you know him, you begin to
[31:06] know. You begin to partake of his divine
[31:08] nature. So say Peter. That right? And
[31:11] how? By adding him in. He's the word
[31:14] coming in now. So you don't see it. But
[31:16] Mary didn't see nobody stand there
[31:17] either. But it it was growing. Amen. So
[31:20] therefore from the time by faith Moses
[31:24] spoke the word of God with authority and
[31:27] was unconquerable. Couldn't conquer him.
[31:29] He knew. Amen. So therefore Mary did the
[31:32] same thing. And what about the bride
[31:34] today? We say by faith we do it. See,
[31:38] now remember,
[31:40] okay, I want to hurry up because I want
[31:41] to keep it too long. I want to drive
[31:42] that thought home to you. Now remember,
[31:45] faith, so you understand right now. See,
[31:48] faith begins by being a laborer. Let me
[31:52] get the scripture for that. Hebrews
[31:53] 4:11.
[31:55] I want to give you the word for that.
[31:58] Let us labor therefore to enter into
[32:00] that rest, lest any man fall after the
[32:04] same example of unbelief.
[32:06] So now labor, let us be eager to know
[32:10] this rest to know him. See, he is the
[32:13] rest. See, let us make every effort to
[32:16] enter in.
[32:18] Excuse me. Let us be zealous and exert
[32:20] ourselves to strive. See amen now. It's
[32:24] also is also called a fight. See, 1
[32:28] Timothy 6:12, he calls it a fight.
[32:32] Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold.
[32:36] Put your hands on it. Amen. It's
[32:38] substance, you know. Lay hold on it.
[32:41] See, you got to lay hold of it. See, lay
[32:43] hold
[32:45] on eternal life where to thou art called
[32:47] and hast professed a good profession
[32:48] before many witnesses. So now our faith,
[32:52] the author Christ begins seed form as a
[32:56] labor, as a fight. Now everybody in the
[32:59] in the Old Testament, they fought and
[33:02] never received the promise. That's
[33:03] right. But think of you. Oh, you have
[33:07] been ordained to fight and receive the
[33:10] promise in the flesh in the last days.
[33:15] The sons of God shall be made manifest.
[33:18] He shall reveal unto the sons of God the
[33:20] glories of God now. That's our charge.
[33:24] We're called for that. That's right. You
[33:26] You're fighting now. Right now. You're
[33:29] laboring now. But you're coming into
[33:31] something that caps don't you cease.
[33:35] See, but so therefore you'll be happy
[33:39] when it actually happens. You said,
[33:40] "Thank God. I labored and I fought
[33:43] through 62, three, four, five. I was
[33:47] assaulted by the enemy, but I got up. I
[33:50] pressed forward. I persisted." Like all
[33:53] the other heroes back there in the
[33:55] Bible, they fought on. Barack and all of
[33:58] them back because Gideon, all of them,
[33:59] Samson, all of them. Amen. Amen. They
[34:01] never received the promise. It's for the
[34:04] end time for you, the bride. Is that
[34:07] something friends? Amen. Think on it
[34:09] now. Amen.
[34:10] And it is consummated in a rest.
[34:14] Philippians 2:16.
[34:17] Praise our God. Holding forth the word
[34:20] of life that I may rejoice when in the
[34:23] day, hey, capstone day, in the day of
[34:26] Christ that I have not run in vain,
[34:28] neither labored in vain. Amen. See, and
[34:33] now watch. Then this is to say that our
[34:36] I call it the first stage from say 63 up
[34:39] to now. It's the first stage of your
[34:41] faith. See there's a finisher also. The
[34:43] there's because because beginning and a
[34:46] finish and you going to partake of both
[34:48] of them. Amen. That's right. These signs
[34:51] shall follow them that believe. The joy
[34:54] of the harvest shall be with you. Oh,
[34:57] that's coming. That's the power of God
[34:58] is coming. The fruit ripens in the top
[35:00] of the tree is going to be in you.
[35:02] Praise God. See now the faith the first
[35:05] stage of your faith is always the
[35:08] battle. It's a battle always through
[35:10] your Bible is a battle. See of taking
[35:12] hold by the will by the heart and the
[35:15] knowledge of God's promise. Now brother
[35:18] Brham brought us knowledge of the
[35:20] promises of God. And we see it first
[35:24] wisdom because comes down because
[35:26] revelation wisdom wisdom strikes the
[35:29] heart and gets understanding. The wise
[35:32] shall know their God. That's why it's
[35:33] called the wise virgins. The wise shall
[35:36] know know that God, he's the word. Amen.
[35:40] And do mighty exploits when they know
[35:43] who he is first. But they want do the
[35:45] exploit because without knowing him
[35:47] first. You got to know his will, how he
[35:49] works first. See now. So the battle is
[35:53] taking hold now. See of God's promises
[35:56] right now. Now watch. See, which is not
[36:00] listen to these very words. The uh the
[36:02] promise is not real to you now in
[36:05] experience.
[36:06] It's not real. That's the whole idea.
[36:09] And that's where Satan traps you at. He
[36:11] said, "Well, you don't have this love."
[36:13] Now, you heard that before, right? Right
[36:14] around here. You ain't got it. Where's
[36:17] your power at? You ain't got nothing.
[36:18] They don't even know the will of God.
[36:20] They don't even know that they are to uh
[36:22] uh apprehend this. see that they are to
[36:25] move on and show this fight this faith
[36:27] first, not expect God soon as the the
[36:30] prophet go up to seem to be in the flesh
[36:32] and pour out his holy spirit upon top of
[36:33] it. No sir, you got a fight. Now, he
[36:36] didn't say that there. He said him that
[36:38] endureth to the end. Amen. That right
[36:40] him that presses on. So people they
[36:42] don't want to press on. They ain't got
[36:44] nothing. Ain't nobody got nothing.
[36:45] There's that unbelieving devil right
[36:46] there. Get away from me, Satan. I don't
[36:49] want to even see him nowhere. Amen.
[36:50] Amen. Because God has given us faith to
[36:53] press on. He's given us an understanding
[36:56] heart to know the knowledge of God to
[36:59] know who we are and and what we're
[37:01] doing. They don't know what they're
[37:02] doing. Therefore, they want power to do.
[37:05] Hallelujah. Glory to God. No, sir.
[37:07] Power's in you. See, it's a seed. It's
[37:10] growing. They don't know that. See, but
[37:12] we moved on anyway now. Okay.
[37:16] So therefore, this this truth promise is
[37:19] not real to us now in experience. See,
[37:21] but we declare it to be ours in spite of
[37:25] all appearances. That's right. Is that
[37:28] right? All right. The former farmer says
[37:31] that he's got a wheat field. He sees a
[37:34] blade. He said, "I don't care what you
[37:36] say. I have a wheat field. In spite of
[37:38] all appearances,
[37:40] he's got a wheat field." Is that right?
[37:43] Next thing you know, he's got a little
[37:44] tsle. He said, "In spite of all
[37:46] appearances,
[37:48] in spite of this carnal state, I have a
[37:51] wheat field ahead coming up." Amen. Then
[37:54] the shock comes. He said, "That's not it
[37:55] there. It's on the inside." Amen. It's
[37:58] still coming. Then when it finally gets
[38:00] to that stage after the latter rain pour
[38:02] up on top of it, it's green yet. It's
[38:06] milky. Needs to be dried out.
[38:09] But in spite of that green appearance in
[38:12] 65 and so forth 66 in spite of that
[38:16] green appearance being sticky and milky.
[38:19] See that was still a wheat field. God
[38:22] says touch not my anointed. Do my
[38:23] prophets no harm. My anointed ones the
[38:25] little ones out there. That is my wheat
[38:27] there. And if anybody comes against it
[38:30] there be like touching because 10
[38:32] million votes. That's right. See that's
[38:35] his wheat. His little one. See? So now
[38:38] the author of the faith by faith planted
[38:41] a seed in your hearts for the foundation
[38:44] of the world. He knows where they are.
[38:46] He throws a water upon it and he's going
[38:48] to bring that seed to maturity at the
[38:51] end.
[38:53] So it grows right on down. See, but
[38:55] while it's growing is growing through
[38:57] something experiences. It has many
[39:00] adventures.
[39:02] Let's call them because adventures. That
[39:04] right? Adventures. That's what it has.
[39:06] plenty of them experiences and so forth.
[39:09] Now, so therefore, we do not appear to
[39:13] be dead, but see, but and because unto
[39:17] sin and alive unto God, but we are
[39:20] because we don't appear, but we are told
[39:21] to believe it. The prophet said,
[39:23] "Believe it." He said, "In order for you
[39:26] to get the the token, you it must be
[39:29] total because obedience to every word,
[39:32] right? In order for you to receive the
[39:34] token." Now, so therefore, when we dare
[39:37] to believe it, and you got to because uh
[39:40] declare it like Mary did. She said, "Be
[39:42] unto me." You got to say it. See, they
[39:44] think you're nuts. Like right now,
[39:47] I hope you got that. Right now, we have
[39:50] the audacity to declare that we have the
[39:53] Holy Ghost in us and all around us that
[39:56] say, "You have got nothing." Amen. Do
[39:59] you hope you see it now? Amen. You see
[40:01] an unbelieving devil that rather believe
[40:03] that you have in God than than believe
[40:05] because you have it. Now, where's the
[40:07] faith at? See what you're facing now?
[40:09] That's unbelief that comes into your
[40:10] midst. Ain't nobody got this. Ain't
[40:12] nobody got this overhead. That's
[40:13] unbelief. When he has come and quickened
[40:16] every word through the Bible, he's
[40:18] poured his blood into every word. And if
[40:21] you break one word, you don't see it
[40:24] then, but you're dead while you're
[40:25] living.
[40:27] You because you'll be judged later on.
[40:30] But you're already dead. You have judge
[40:31] your own self right there. For you broke
[40:33] one word. You broke the prophet's
[40:36] message.
[40:37] See what I mean? Now you break it there.
[40:40] Nothing happens to you. Go on. You get
[40:42] blessed in in his permissive will. Sure.
[40:44] Because you feel the Holy Spirit. Sure.
[40:46] It's all right. But when that seed that
[40:48] does believe it comes out into maturity,
[40:51] then when you begin to look for that
[40:53] over there, that's judgment over there.
[40:55] See, believe it now. Amen. See, praise
[40:58] the Lord. So therefore, Satan, like he's
[41:02] doing now, will assault you. Oh, he'll
[41:05] assault your faith. And sometimes you
[41:07] fall down cuz Joshua did. See, cuz
[41:11] aching, unbelief in the camp. That's
[41:13] right. Don't believe it. Don't believe
[41:15] the promises of God. God said it. It
[41:17] belongs to me. They don't believe it.
[41:19] They got to see with their eyes. They
[41:22] got to be in a whole lot of hallelujah
[41:24] and got to feel it and see it when
[41:26] they're not realizing that it is by
[41:28] faith. You get it because Hebrews 11 by
[41:32] faith because you're apprehended because
[41:34] appropriated to yourself you're standing
[41:35] on that ground each piece of ground by
[41:37] faith they don't understand that now.
[41:39] See there's another spirit spirit of the
[41:42] church Eve spirit looking for new life.
[41:45] See now unbelief will say it is not so.
[41:49] Mhm. And belief will say, "Shut up,
[41:52] unbelief. It is so." And do you know,
[41:54] they don't get mad at you. Oh, sure they
[41:57] will. They will actually get mad at you
[41:59] for saying because it is so. Because
[42:02] they don't believe it is so. And they'll
[42:04] they will exert employ.
[42:09] And then you come right back and employ
[42:11] and exert and strive every effort to
[42:13] prove that it is so. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[42:16] Praise God. By the sword of the spirit.
[42:18] Amen. Amen. Do you see you in a death
[42:20] struggle? See, right now, spiritual
[42:23] wickedness right here on the earth here.
[42:26] See? Amen. So, therefore, Joshua and
[42:29] Israel, they got uh he says, "Don't
[42:32] pray, Joshua. Get up. Sin in the camp.
[42:34] Get up from there. Don't pray." Might as
[42:37] well stop right there and get the s out.
[42:39] See, when you get the s out, then you
[42:40] can see something happen then. See now
[42:43] as we follow in the footsteps of those
[42:47] who by faith and patience waited because
[42:50] to inherit the promise. See something
[42:52] begins to happen within. You don't see
[42:55] it. See but it begins to happen within.
[42:58] Now right now the son his presence is
[43:01] doing something within. First is inward
[43:04] then it's outward. I I hope you can see
[43:06] that first the baby grows in the mother.
[43:09] You don't see but you see the form of
[43:10] it. That's what the prophet's son and
[43:13] wife sees the form of it inside. I hope
[43:18] you got that. Paul said, "I labor and
[43:20] travail that Christ be formed in you." A
[43:24] prophet brings on labor pains. He labors
[43:28] travails with the bride to and that
[43:31] until Christ is formed. And when a seed
[43:33] is taken hold, profit goes off the
[43:35] scene. And let that seed begin to fight
[43:38] the good fight of faith. Begin to labor.
[43:41] Amen. Labor to bring forth that job.
[43:44] Jesus Christ. I hope you get it,
[43:46] friends. Amen. Is it getting through to
[43:47] you? Amen. Amen. Praise God. See,
[43:50] therefore, the spirit
[43:53] will cooperate. He's waiting to do it.
[43:56] The son said, "It is so." And down it
[43:59] comes. A refreshing breeze comes down.
[44:01] Amen. And begins to cooperate with the
[44:03] word. The word said it. The Holy Spirit
[44:06] brings it to pass. His presence is doing
[44:08] it right now. shaping and molding a
[44:11] bride through trials and also
[44:13] adversities and persecutions. See now
[44:17] then to our faith is added because
[44:20] assurance blessed assurance and
[44:22] assurance is when you have it and then
[44:25] you it begins to add to your faith and
[44:27] uh because knowledge and so forth all is
[44:29] added. See now then as it's being added
[44:33] as you're laboring as you're fighting in
[44:36] the first stage of your faith. See as
[44:38] you're doing these things here it comes
[44:40] on you unconsciously is an unconscious
[44:43] growth. You're just going every day but
[44:46] you're fighting a good fight of faith
[44:47] and you're laboring the good fight of
[44:48] faith. See and you're laboring and
[44:50] fighting every day. See now then before
[44:52] you know it the consummation comes the
[44:54] capstone before you even know it. The
[44:57] consummation the finisher. He's the
[44:59] author and the finisher, the perfector.
[45:02] Amen. He comes down. I'mma prove it to
[45:04] you because uh by Apollo 9, he comes
[45:07] down, see, and comes in love and says,
[45:10] "Here is the finished product." And out
[45:13] it goes. See, but first he did a work on
[45:16] the inside that nobody else knew what he
[45:18] was doing. Amen. See, then the
[45:22] consummation of faith has been reached.
[45:25] this summit, the thing because you're
[45:27] because looking for you got there at top
[45:30] the mountain and the prophet said when
[45:32] you climb up the mountain and get to the
[45:33] top by faith then you break into powers,
[45:37] visions, glories of God up at the top of
[45:39] the mountain. You're up on the top then.
[45:41] Amen. But you you know you got up there
[45:44] by experience. Now when he's there with
[45:46] you, oh brother, Satan has got to get
[45:48] back mountain be thou removed. Go into
[45:51] the sea like Adam. Go over there. Go
[45:53] over there. So for a spoken word of God
[45:55] see but when you get there you'll know
[45:58] that you stayed with that word no matter
[46:00] how many devils said that it is not so
[46:02] you say it is so amen see then the love
[46:05] the capstone is the flesh and he comes
[46:07] down now then what once 63 4 5 6 7 8 and
[46:13] 9 was a effort to maintain also labor
[46:17] for now comes easy as breathing just
[46:21] walking the prophet said so there goes
[46:23] is a statue of a perfect man. Love is in
[46:26] him. Faith, joy is all in him. Yes,
[46:30] father. What would you have me to do? Go
[46:32] on that corner over stand over thus
[46:33] sayith the Lord. He goes stands right
[46:35] there. See, he's be because obedience
[46:38] and there he stands. He has all of the
[46:41] faith, the rapturing faith is just in
[46:43] him now. All he needs is a a trumpet
[46:45] blast because it's the word. Amen. He
[46:49] hears that dead in Christ raised up and
[46:51] so forth and then and whatever it has to
[46:53] be happens and away you go. But the
[46:56] thing is he's got to have perfect love
[46:57] and love is a capstone. Amen. So
[47:00] therefore that is the law. See there's a
[47:03] faith. There's a law of faith. It's got
[47:06] to be fought labored out then finished
[47:09] off. And the finishing touch is Jesus
[47:14] Christ himself. The love of God is the
[47:15] finishing touch. Then he shows you the
[47:18] product. Yeah. Dresses it all up nice.
[47:20] Here it is. See? And it is what it says
[47:23] it is too. Not in a false box. You know
[47:26] what I mean? See, all dress up become on
[47:28] the outside of me. See, now all of the
[47:32] equalities is in the second stage right
[47:34] now. And they must be in there. See when
[47:37] he anoints it. Now quickly the way of
[47:39] the cross there's because three aspects
[47:42] of the way of the cross. the the atoning
[47:44] work which we have which we have all
[47:46] been through the identification with
[47:48] Jesus Christ the word which is right now
[47:51] see dying on the cross we are now
[47:53] identifying oursel with the word he has
[47:55] come and said here's my word and we say
[47:57] that's the word and we do it see and in
[48:00] doing so we're dying on the cross on the
[48:03] cross see okay because quickly then when
[48:06] we realize through knowledge that we are
[48:09] because crucified with him then you can
[48:11] start adding something to that Then the
[48:13] token is added then when you go on the
[48:16] cross and die daily. See? And then the
[48:18] token is added. The life of Christ comes
[48:20] in as you die out be like your own life.
[48:22] Then his life comes in. See now there's
[48:25] there's another stage. See the dying of
[48:28] the old man. This is the same second
[48:30] stage. And the rising by power of God of
[48:34] the new man is an actual permanent
[48:37] inward experience that you never forget
[48:41] because God did it. See me now it's got
[48:44] to be done on the inside first because
[48:46] the third stage see is more trials but
[48:50] that's for the outside
[48:52] and the third stage is to die out for
[48:54] others that was Jesus Christ that was
[48:57] the early church the corn of wheat that
[48:59] was Paul that was William Brandham he
[49:01] told his son Paul it's not for me it's
[49:04] for you is that right see because Paul
[49:08] said that death workketh in me but life
[49:11] for you I die in this body every day for
[49:14] you. See, if Paul died, then the people
[49:17] could feed on the resurrected life of
[49:20] Christ in Paul. Amen. See, we fed on the
[49:24] resurrected life in brother Brandham. As
[49:26] he died daily, well, God has ordained a
[49:31] few, a bride to come forth soon and to
[49:34] die daily and to go out and that life
[49:37] might be seen out there. The life of
[49:39] Jesus Christ. Therefore, that is what we
[49:42] are believing here and that is what we
[49:44] are coming to now. That's why Paul said,
[49:46] "As many as are perfect, mature and have
[49:49] this understanding, let us walk by the
[49:52] same rule here." See? Amen. See now, so
[49:55] now because in closing, the first and
[49:58] second stage is for us as individuals.
[50:03] The third stage is for others. See, he's
[50:07] preparing you for something. He's going
[50:08] to show himself through you. But right
[50:10] now in the second stage now we identify
[50:12] ourself with every word. Then every word
[50:15] can come down and identify itself with
[50:17] you and work right for you. Amen. See
[50:20] which is the anointing. See now um well
[50:24] I'll skip this here. Maybe I can because
[50:26] pick it up later. I want to get to
[50:29] something here now. Um yes. Now we want
[50:33] to all overcome. Are you tired? No. Oh
[50:36] my god. With 10 minutes more. Amen.
[50:38] Amen. Go ahead. I want to strike this
[50:40] here. Amen. I see some getting tired
[50:42] there. So now watch uh to overcome. We
[50:45] all want to overcome, but we've got to
[50:47] have knowledge. Paul said to know him.
[50:50] See, therefore the early disciples
[50:52] before they even become received the
[50:54] Holy Ghost, he opened the scriptures to
[50:56] them. Is that right? In St. Luke 24:45,
[51:00] he opened up the entire word to them. He
[51:02] spoke things pertaining to the kingdom
[51:04] of God to them. All they need now was
[51:06] anointing and striking. That's all. See,
[51:08] so Christ has slipped down now and
[51:11] opened the scriptures to us through the
[51:14] seven seals. Is that right? And we add
[51:16] we or we appropriate this because to
[51:18] ourselves. See amen now. Now
[51:22] we have to have the mind that was in
[51:23] Christ. See the early disciples had it.
[51:26] Paul had it. Brother Brandham had it
[51:28] because many others had it. See, now we
[51:30] want the same mind. See, now watch.
[51:32] Well, that mind we read, "Count it joy
[51:35] when you fall into diver temptations,
[51:37] but can we do it?" See, rejoice in your
[51:41] tribulation because can we do it? See,
[51:44] but they did. We say, "Well, how could
[51:46] they rejoice?" It's a revelation.
[51:49] It's a revelation.
[51:51] Now, you got to have revelation. When
[51:53] the early church got a revelation to
[51:55] sell their goods, get it now? Somebody
[51:58] else didn't get that revelation. Yeah.
[52:00] Therefore, they only sold part of it
[52:02] because they were handing part the
[52:03] money. But those who sold it turned all
[52:06] the money. It was a revelation. Amen.
[52:09] Hiccup and safer. So what they did
[52:12] imitating is what we because we'll keep
[52:14] back part of it. No, no revelation.
[52:17] Trying to do it. See, and what happened?
[52:19] The Holy Spirit called right out. I hope
[52:22] you're reading me. Amen. Amen. Praise
[52:24] the Lord. So it's a revelation.
[52:26] So can it joy and these things is a
[52:29] revelation.
[52:30] They had this revelation and that's what
[52:33] God is bringing us up to now. You right
[52:35] here, he's bringing you to a revelation
[52:38] that you counted joy to fall into
[52:41] diamonds temptations for we show you
[52:43] because by the word this morning. Amen.
[52:44] Now see, we want to know him and the
[52:47] power of his resurrection and the
[52:49] fellowship of his suffering. Now, do you
[52:52] want to know those things? Amen. Then if
[52:54] you really want to know it, then it's a
[52:55] joyful thing to know. Amen. Cuz it's a
[52:57] joy. Amen. The fellowship of his
[53:00] sufferings is a joy. Amen. That's
[53:02] exactly right. See, but we got to come
[53:05] to that. Our our minds got to understand
[53:07] that there. We have to get over these
[53:08] little petty things here. Amen. See, so
[53:12] now we got to know the true method of
[53:14] facing, handling, and using for good.
[53:19] See, all forms of adversity.
[53:23] Let's sink in now. We got to know the
[53:26] true method. how to handle, how to face,
[53:29] and how to use every evil thing. My God.
[53:32] Amen. Hope you get it this morning,
[53:34] friends. Then you can enter into another
[53:36] realm. Yes. They was in that realm. And
[53:39] so was your brother Brandon. They they
[53:41] walk in in a spirit of faith. I mean, is
[53:44] uh up higher. But God said, "You're
[53:47] going to come up there through the word
[53:49] of God." He gonna show it to you. See?
[53:51] And watch what I'm saying. We got to
[53:53] know the true method of facing,
[53:56] handling, and using for good. Now, it
[54:00] says on the word Romans 8:28, all things
[54:04] that right, evil or good works together
[54:07] for good. To them that love God. Amen.
[54:12] I'm trying to see if you get it. See?
[54:13] Amen. Praise the Lord. See now okay all
[54:17] experiences of what we call evil
[54:21] like you know shocks
[54:24] suffering difficulty disaster unjust
[54:28] treatments if you were to get a shock at
[54:30] the service this morning see me now you
[54:32] would know if you're spiritual that it
[54:34] works together for goodmen if somebody
[54:36] was to shock you with some bad news or
[54:38] something like that you say well praise
[54:40] God just heard the because preachers say
[54:42] that it works together for goodmen Amen.
[54:44] So it'll happen to you this morning.
[54:46] See? Amen. Now the key, see our evils,
[54:51] watch this. Now our evils are never
[54:54] happenings happenings in themselves.
[54:58] See, but the effect that we allow them
[55:02] to have on us,
[55:04] there is the trouble. Amen. The thing in
[55:07] itself can't harm you. But the fear that
[55:10] we get against it, it tears you to
[55:12] pieces. Can't sleep, can't eat, can't
[55:16] praise God, can't sing, can't sit down,
[55:18] can't read the Bible, can't pray. The
[55:20] effect on you of evil.
[55:24] Amen.
[55:27] Sink it in. Now I'm I'm driving it home
[55:29] now. So you get the idea here. See me?
[55:31] Now like when you start out, we have
[55:33] unity here. Unity itself is delubricated
[55:36] because of the machine. The machine is
[55:38] the word of God. You got to have that
[55:40] because to begin with and unity become
[55:42] lubricates it. And having unity you got
[55:45] to die.
[55:47] People have all kind of odd habits,
[55:49] strange behaviors, you know, things like
[55:52] that there. and because of joy in the
[55:54] beginning. See, but you got to look at
[55:58] what little stature of Christ is in them
[56:01] and say, "Well, praise God for that
[56:02] little bit I see there." And don't look
[56:05] at the moat that is a beam in your own
[56:07] eye. You got to think that Christ in his
[56:10] love takes care of yours. Glory to God.
[56:15] So therefore, Lord, let me love him like
[56:18] you love me. Amen.
[56:21] See, see me now. No matter how fleshy it
[56:24] looks, no matter if it if it's old or
[56:26] whatever it is, see me now. No matter
[56:28] what it is, he brings us all together.
[56:29] Different tongues and dialects and so
[56:31] forth, different strange mannerisms. I
[56:34] myself used to be a person used to watch
[56:36] every little thing because you do.
[56:37] Before I was saved, I had I couldn't
[56:39] understand certain things. See amen now.
[56:41] So there God had to beat all it out of
[56:42] me. I watch everything. I got to have it
[56:45] with me. I got to see what's in there.
[56:46] What's over there? What's over there?
[56:47] See, I watch everything. But now he uses
[56:49] that. Praise the Lord. See, but that's
[56:51] the way I was. I used to drive my poor
[56:54] wife crazy. What's his head? What's this
[56:56] over there? So forth so see. See? Amen.
[56:57] See, but now see, but see God use that.
[57:00] It's that's in the nature. Amen. See,
[57:02] but then you begin to overcome. No
[57:04] matter what he does or what he does,
[57:06] what about what I'm doing? It's because
[57:09] I because because
[57:11] and offense also. But God in his love
[57:15] takes away mine in his own time. Amen.
[57:18] Amen. In his own time. See, when he
[57:21] wants to, so we got to say, well, Lord
[57:24] God, let thy will be done. See, so
[57:27] therefore, in a place like that, there
[57:29] he begin to mold you together. And you
[57:32] said, but there so I can't understand
[57:33] this person keep on doing this thing.
[57:35] Great sin, grace does more abound.
[57:40] Amen. When he said there a whole lot of
[57:42] unbelief in here, there's more grace in
[57:44] praise God.
[57:46] It'll take care of it. It'll mold it and
[57:48] shape it into a unit, lubricate it by
[57:51] unity, and they'll come and see it.
[57:54] Amen. There'll still be those who are
[57:56] raised up. It's all right. Love them.
[57:58] Right? They can't do nothing cuz it's
[58:01] established.
[58:03] God has set the thing there. He put the
[58:05] oil in there, right? Delubricating oil.
[58:08] The unity is moving all through every
[58:09] part of the machine, every part of the
[58:12] word. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. See,
[58:14] so now um therefore, see, we allow the
[58:19] effect to tear us to pieces. This person
[58:23] speaks this way or has a fleshy behavior
[58:25] or whatever it is. See, because it kills
[58:27] you. See, now that's for purpose. It is
[58:30] to kill you to die on the cross. That's
[58:33] what it's for. Amen. Amen. See, that's
[58:36] what it's for. And then after a while,
[58:38] it keep on coming. It keep on coming.
[58:40] Why don't they stop doing that? Why'
[58:41] they stop saying that there? See, he
[58:44] will keep sending it until you say,
[58:46] "Lord, I love my brother and my sister."
[58:50] He'll keep on till you say that. Keep on
[58:53] doing it. I love you. Praise God. It's
[58:55] all right. Then he does it. You don't
[58:57] even see it. All you see is Jesus on the
[59:01] cross. Amen. Now you're being perfected.
[59:06] Now you're growing up. Christ saw all
[59:08] kind of things. Father him. Brother
[59:10] Brandham, what did he say?
[59:13] brother. See, but he went on. Amen.
[59:16] Praise the Lord. See, now
[59:19] see the the evil in itself because the
[59:22] happenings that's not the trouble is
[59:24] what we allow it to because the effect
[59:26] on us. See, now every experience is good
[59:30] or evil. See, that's right. See, now
[59:34] fear and doubt makes it evil, but trust
[59:39] says it's good because you trust in God.
[59:41] That's all right. Cuz Rom 8:28 says,
[59:44] "It'll work together for me, for my
[59:46] good." Therefore, if it's evil, it's
[59:48] going to be for my good. Amen. Amen.
[59:52] Amen. All right. One example, Calvary.
[59:56] Let it sink in. There was Jesus Christ,
[59:59] the savior. He faced the most evil thing
[1:00:03] that could be done. That right? It was
[1:00:05] an outward experience. That right? It
[1:00:08] was Satan's scheme. It was an evil
[1:00:10] thing.
[1:00:11] But Christ, did he waver? No. Uhuh.
[1:00:14] Uhuh. See, he had an inward attitude of
[1:00:17] faith. Amen. Praise God. See, which
[1:00:21] declared that that evil was good.
[1:00:25] See, he rejected the temptation to call
[1:00:29] that evil evil. Said it's good. He said
[1:00:32] because he said it's not my will. It's
[1:00:34] his will. Then if it's God's will,
[1:00:36] everything God does is good. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:39] Is that right for us? Amen. So
[1:00:41] therefore, now watch Christ then when if
[1:00:45] you read through St. John 12:13, 144 all
[1:00:48] through there, he don't even mention
[1:00:49] Satan hardly.
[1:00:51] In St. John 14 30, he says, "The prince
[1:00:54] of this world cometh has nothing in me."
[1:00:58] Amen. Oh, praise God. He has no claim on
[1:01:02] me, no power over me. That right? He has
[1:01:06] nothing to do with me. Amen. Nothing in
[1:01:09] me. Is that right? The prince of this
[1:01:12] world cometh here. So he spoke to his
[1:01:14] disciples with joy, with love, and told
[1:01:17] them all these wonderful promises. That
[1:01:19] right? And knowing he going to face this
[1:01:21] evil. But he turned the evil around for
[1:01:25] good. Who's good? Our good. For it saved
[1:01:28] us.
[1:01:30] Let us sing. Amen. That evil was good
[1:01:33] because it brought us salvation. Right?
[1:01:36] So that trial, suffering for Christ,
[1:01:39] adversity was to our good that evil.
[1:01:43] Hope you get it. Do you understand that
[1:01:44] friends? Amen. Praise God. Well, then
[1:01:48] there's no evil that God can't turn
[1:01:51] around and make it good.
[1:01:53] That right? Satan made a fierce attack
[1:01:56] on his body outside. See, but faith, his
[1:02:00] faith made it impossible for Satan to
[1:02:03] touch inside. God was in there. Amen.
[1:02:06] The body had to go through those things
[1:02:08] there. See, Peter come along and said
[1:02:10] that it was God's determined counsel
[1:02:12] beforehand, his fornowledge that this
[1:02:14] had to be. See me now. Now,
[1:02:18] adversities
[1:02:19] and sufferings, see, are instruments of
[1:02:22] Satan.
[1:02:24] But now watch today, right now we are we
[1:02:27] understand that. But if by faith we can
[1:02:30] turn it around, Amen.
[1:02:33] turn into blessings.
[1:02:35] Amen. I'm trying to show you the early
[1:02:38] church. I'm trying to show you, brother
[1:02:40] Brandham. And we have, I believe, come
[1:02:43] to that point. Now,
[1:02:46] we're facing something. And we're going
[1:02:48] to have to and that what is that's
[1:02:50] that's what it means to be fully matured
[1:02:52] and grown up, to have the mind of Jesus
[1:02:55] Christ, to know him, to know that
[1:02:58] nothing cuz God said it was good. Amen.
[1:03:02] Everything is good. See, so therefore,
[1:03:04] because God because God create evil to
[1:03:07] turn it back around to work for you.
[1:03:09] That's his way. So when you know him
[1:03:11] through knowledge, then you understand
[1:03:13] then you don't have any qualms. Then see
[1:03:15] you know you understand God. You you
[1:03:17] because you know him right now.
[1:03:20] Then we see that we turn it around is
[1:03:22] something to be used in in faith to turn
[1:03:27] it against Satan. See now then if we
[1:03:31] have the understanding then this
[1:03:33] revelation that evil is good because of
[1:03:37] our benefit then we count it joy. To
[1:03:40] fall into diverse temptation we rejoice
[1:03:42] in our tribulations. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:46] This sure got be revelation. Praise the
[1:03:49] Lord. Amen.
[1:03:52] We use them as special opportunities
[1:03:55] to see the manifestation of God's power.
[1:03:59] It's only when you can become weak that
[1:04:02] he's strong. Amen. It's only you have to
[1:04:05] you have to become weak. Christ has to
[1:04:07] become weak then the strength come the
[1:04:10] power of God. So when we become in our
[1:04:12] weakening condition can't do nothing
[1:04:13] then he shows forth his power. Amen. and
[1:04:17] his disciples and went out. Trials,
[1:04:19] adversities, the power of God rested
[1:04:22] upon them. Amen. See, we are facing that
[1:04:24] now. See now, so therefore, if we
[1:04:28] understand this here, we face it not to
[1:04:31] merely because endure it as a judgment
[1:04:34] or trial. Then it's like weary, another
[1:04:37] trial.
[1:04:39] Oh Lord, help me Lord. Pray for me,
[1:04:41] brother. I'm going through. I'm going
[1:04:44] through.
[1:04:45] I'm going through. See me now. Another
[1:04:49] one. The early church boy that says,
[1:04:52] "Thank God we were beaten." Amen. This
[1:04:55] is the word now. You want the word? They
[1:04:58] rejoiced cuz they was whipped. Amen.
[1:05:02] They was bowed.
[1:05:04] Amen. And think of it. Rejoiced in being
[1:05:07] beaten for the Lord. Counted it worthy.
[1:05:10] I'm trying to show you there's ordained
[1:05:13] elected few who walks on that third
[1:05:15] stage.
[1:05:16] Oh yeah. Many say I am identified with
[1:05:19] you on the cross Lord. Then the next day
[1:05:21] something happened. Then the next day
[1:05:22] I'm identified you on the cross Lord.
[1:05:24] But this stage died daily
[1:05:27] every day. I live in you dying. The
[1:05:31] brother Brand died every day. Paul every
[1:05:33] day. Those early disciples. You know
[1:05:35] why? There's a reason for that. There's
[1:05:38] a spiritual law of harvest. A corn and
[1:05:41] wheat must die and it brings forth
[1:05:43] 100fold fruit. That's why see now the
[1:05:47] early church which was a corn and wheat
[1:05:49] had to die to bring forth us. Therefore,
[1:05:52] you see it now. They had to die every
[1:05:54] day. And then people outside saw the
[1:05:56] life of Christ and they come to Christ.
[1:05:58] See it now. See? So therefore, that's
[1:06:01] what is going on now. Now then
[1:06:04] knowledge, the truth will change a weak
[1:06:07] spot in our armor, our fear to face
[1:06:11] trials and sufferings. When the truth
[1:06:13] comes, it'll turn that around. And you
[1:06:15] said, "Wait a minute. You mean that to
[1:06:17] know him, this is the mind of Christ,
[1:06:19] that this is the will of God?" The
[1:06:21] witness says, "Yes. Yes, this is the
[1:06:24] will of God." You say, "Well, wait a
[1:06:25] minute. Get back, Satan.
[1:06:27] I'll rejoice in every trial. I'll
[1:06:30] rejoice because every judgment, every
[1:06:32] test from this day on cuz I have
[1:06:34] received the knowledge of God this
[1:06:36] morning that I can turn this around.
[1:06:40] See, by faith turn it back up on Satan
[1:06:43] and swallow him up just like Moses
[1:06:46] because stick did. Amen. Moses because
[1:06:48] he threw out his stick as a serpent. He
[1:06:50] threw out his because Jambre's serpent
[1:06:52] also but Moses he didn't run. Amen. And
[1:06:55] he stood there and he waited by faith
[1:06:58] cuz he know God sent him. He is
[1:07:01] something going to happen cuz God sent
[1:07:02] me here. Then pretty soon it begin to
[1:07:04] swallow him up. Amen. And you swallow
[1:07:07] every trial. Amen. Amen. But think what
[1:07:11] happens to you. Some more weight come
[1:07:13] off.
[1:07:15] Amen.
[1:07:17] Lay aside every weight. Some more weight
[1:07:19] comes off. It comes off here. God knows
[1:07:23] it's on there. So he prunes it off.
[1:07:25] Amen. Through a trial which works out. I
[1:07:29] hope you see you the light affliction
[1:07:31] works for far more exceeding great way
[1:07:33] of glory for you. Is that right friends?
[1:07:36] Then the when I get the uh because truth
[1:07:39] of it then it becomes an adventure of
[1:07:43] adversity. What's the next one? Lord got
[1:07:45] the sword of the spirit drawn out the
[1:07:47] helmet on breastplate the armor feet
[1:07:50] shower with the gospel preparation of
[1:07:51] peace. Now ready. Amen. ready for the
[1:07:54] next battle. Yes, sir. So, put the sword
[1:07:57] out there. It's a an adventure with the
[1:08:01] Lord. He's already conquered everything
[1:08:03] out there. Every trial, he's conquered
[1:08:04] it already. He wants you to go into it.
[1:08:07] Possess it. Amen. Praise God. See, it's
[1:08:10] the adverse condition that ripens the
[1:08:13] wheat. Come on. Amen. Therefore, if you

[1:08:18] wheat just lays in it. Just lays in the

[1:08:42] sir. Praise God. Why? We are following
[1:08:45] in his steps. We're turning the trials
[1:08:48] into victory.
[1:08:50] Amen. We turn the suffering into
[1:08:52] victory. Victory. Victory shall be mine.
[1:08:56] Yes, sir. That's why. Why? How? Through
[1:08:58] knowledge of the son of the living God.
[1:09:01] He's dropped down and brought some
[1:09:03] wisdom in there. Revelation,
[1:09:05] understanding comes into the heart.

[1:09:33] see the glorious purpose of God. I hope
[1:09:35] you see it this morning. The apostles
[1:09:37] saw it. Brother Brandham saw it. Paul
[1:09:40] saw it is a revelation. Then you can say
[1:09:43] uh to know him account everything lost
[1:09:46] and the power of his resurrection and
[1:09:48] also the fellowship of his sufferings is
[1:09:51] revelation friends. It's got to come to

[1:10:02] and the endurance of every thing becomes
[1:10:06] your victory. Amen. Now watch. If God's

[1:10:41] can separate me from the love of God?
[1:10:43] Trials, persecutions, atonements, evil

[1:10:56] that right, friends? So therefore, we
[1:10:58] rejoice always. We give thanks always.
[1:11:02] Amen. When the trial comes, I thank
[1:11:04] thee, oh heavenly father, for turning

[1:11:09] go on through it then. Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:11:12] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Yes, sir.
[1:11:15] See now, all right, then if good is

[1:11:25] good to the enlightened
[1:11:28] to those whose eyes has been anointed.
[1:11:31] Well, I said have to see this.
[1:11:32] Understand this here. See, then there's
[1:11:34] a realm of life that I must live in.
[1:11:38] Now, another one then that's the one
[1:11:41] that Christ lived in, that the early
[1:11:43] apostles lived in, that the one all the
[1:11:46] heroes of faith live that faith up
[1:11:48] there. that brother Brandham live it
[1:11:50] himself.
[1:11:52] See amen now. See, hope you get it. It's
[1:11:54] another realm of life. Then if this is
[1:11:57] being spoken to me this morning, this
[1:11:59] must be soon ready to come to pass
[1:12:03] cuz God will tell you what you're

[1:12:07] get down the spirit. You want to pick
[1:12:08] that up now. See that now? He's showing
[1:12:10] you that no matter what's going to
[1:12:12] happen now is yours. The evil, no matter

[1:12:35] love, you reach down to the weak ones.

[1:12:39] love. Edify them. Say something good to
[1:12:41] them. See, now that's all right. Stay

[1:12:53] weak ones. Amen. See now, therefore, we
[1:12:57] uh rejoice always. Give thanks all the
[1:13:00] time. Thank God. Thank God. Amen. When
[1:13:04] you say thank God, the devil gets so
[1:13:05] mad. Because he can't bring in his
[1:13:08] delusion.
[1:13:10] See, bring those spirits around and make
[1:13:11] you all weary and depressed looking.
[1:13:13] That's the devil. See me now. But if you
[1:13:16] are rejoicing always for every trial, I
[1:13:20] don't mean to go around laughing now.
[1:13:21] You know what I mean? See
[1:13:24] amen. See,
[1:13:26] but see to me it means that we are just
[1:13:30] about ready for Christ to move us up the
[1:13:35] the the ordained ones into another
[1:13:37] sphere. See, and to me uh that is the
[1:13:41] way of the cross. I just tried to bring
[1:13:43] to you what has been going on now to
[1:13:47] bring you up to the point the third
[1:13:49] stage where you die daily live for
[1:13:51] others bring forth 100fold fruit right
[1:13:55] then possession of you got it right
[1:13:57] there see amen now because the early
[1:13:59] disciples
[1:14:01] excuse me they enjoy the fruit of
[1:14:04] Christ's death
[1:14:06] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:14:10] that right yes sir Now in closing, then
[1:14:13] death workketh in me. See, but life in
[1:14:17] you. Paul said so. See all the things
[1:14:19] are hidden in the Bible. If therefore as
[1:14:21] many as be perfect, you see because full
[1:14:24] grown now have this mind. Understand
[1:14:27] this here and move forward from here.
[1:14:30] Look, every trial that we have had to
[1:14:32] be. God knew before the foundation of
[1:14:35] the world that somebody would be could
[1:14:37] lie against you, talk against you. He
[1:14:39] knew it. But he want to see if you could
[1:14:41] take it
[1:14:43] and still love that person. See, he want
[1:14:46] to see that if you can hear something
[1:14:48] that will shock you that you won't see
[1:14:50] the good in it. Say amen now. So now uh
[1:14:55] uh if you can understand these things
[1:14:57] we've come to another realm and he's
[1:15:00] showing you in the natural the wheat he
[1:15:02] shows you because because by the wheat
[1:15:04] he shows you by the astronauts all these
[1:15:07] things there that we're coming we've
[1:15:09] come now to another place he said when
[1:15:12] the bride brother said when the bride
[1:15:13] can get to that place oh what he said
[1:15:16] when she can finally laboring and
[1:15:20] fighting to get there and you're here
[1:15:22] you're here by the grace of God you're
[1:15:25] here. When she can get there, he said,
[1:15:27] "Then watch her go." Yes, sir. Then
[1:15:29] watch her go. Then watch something come
[1:15:30] among her. The power of the living God.
[1:15:33] He said, "While there'll be such a
[1:15:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost, it'll take
[1:15:36] her into the clouds." That's right. But
[1:15:39] now, is she is all her parts working?
[1:15:42] Amen. Is the love, the faith, the
[1:15:46] knowledge, the patience, the temperance,
[1:15:49] the godliness of brotherly, is it
[1:15:50] working? Is it in working order like
[1:15:52] because Apollo 9 here? See, it's been
[1:15:54] because they even took Apollo 9 this and
[1:15:57] shook it all around. Shook it five three
[1:15:59] times and to make sure. But it held she
[1:16:02] hell. Amen. She's been through a whole
[1:16:04] lot. But she's there. Amen. I believe
[1:16:07] with all within me the bride is at the
[1:16:09] door for Christ the capstone in his
[1:16:13] dynamics. Cuz he had already slipped in
[1:16:15] already with the word capstone for his
[1:16:19] dynamics. the fruit in the top of the
[1:16:21] tree having faith in the beginning as
[1:16:24] having and possessing finally realizing
[1:16:27] it the reality of it and when that
[1:16:29] happens it comes as natural as breathing
[1:16:33] it's walking around a living temple of
[1:16:36] God amen that's what you've come to
[1:16:38] friend that's what I'm trying to show
[1:16:39] you this morning you have a little trial
[1:16:41] a little suffering whatever it is

[1:16:52] Praise God. I hate to take up so much
[1:16:54] time, but I just want because I'm heart
[1:16:57] to get this to you so that you have
[1:16:59] faith to look for it now. It's coming.
[1:17:02] See, brother Brand said that stay in the
[1:17:06] word, the right word, the right thing is
[1:17:08] to be done. It's going to happen. We
[1:17:10] don't know how it going to happen, but
[1:17:10] it's going to happen. Somebody God is
[1:17:13] preparing somewhere in this world. There
[1:17:17] is some vessels that's been prepared by
[1:17:20] the word to receive something. Amen. I'm
[1:17:23] believing this right here. That's why
[1:17:25] I'm here. That's why I'm laboring and
[1:17:27] fighting along with here. I'm believing
[1:17:29] that it is you. There's others, of
[1:17:30] course. Sure. But I got because to
[1:17:32] believe here because this is where I'm
[1:17:33] at. See? Amen. And so therefore, these
[1:17:36] little letters and things are tokens is
[1:17:38] God's tokens to you to let you know that
[1:17:41] he went and and got his prophet's son
[1:17:43] and and wife and family and sent them
[1:17:45] here for a sign. I hope you understand
[1:17:48] that. See, they just wouldn't come here
[1:17:49] now cuz Billy Paul told me that the
[1:17:52] there's many places that could sit brand
[1:17:54] because she hadn't gone nowhere to come
[1:17:55] here. See, the Lord sent them here cuz
[1:17:58] they wouldn't come otherwise. Now,
[1:18:00] people, they don't want to hear me say
[1:18:02] this, but I can't help that. I have to
[1:18:03] say that. See that now? So therefore,
[1:18:06] the thing to do now is to no matter what
[1:18:09] you hear, no matter what shocks you
[1:18:10] hear, don't question anything. Grow up
[1:18:14] and say, "Well, okay, fine." No matter
[1:18:16] what they tell you, whatever it what you
[1:18:18] hear or whatever it is, see, be mature
[1:18:20] now. Paul says, see, and receive all
[1:18:22] these things like Jesus Christ did it
[1:18:25] because brother Bram did it didn't phase
[1:18:27] them at all. They had an inward faith.
[1:18:29] See, and our inward faith has come
[1:18:31] through these six years here now. See,
[1:18:34] and brother Brandham Elijah brought on
[1:18:36] the countdown. The countdown is here
[1:18:38] now. Zero hour. We're now ready to enter
[1:18:41] in April, the seventh year of the zero
[1:18:44] hour. Is this the year after laboring
[1:18:47] six years? Amen. That we can walk into
[1:18:51] that rest and then just stop laboring
[1:18:54] and fighting and just walk. Amen. I
[1:18:56] don't know. I don't say it is, but I'm
[1:18:58] saying is this the the seventh year
[1:19:00] coming up? I don't know. See, but it's
[1:19:01] been since 63. See, but I'm praying to
[1:19:04] God with all might in me that because it
[1:19:06] is cuz we're tired. We're weary. Amen.
[1:19:10] But nevertheless, if we have to go to
[1:19:12] 77, whatever it is, we'll still march on
[1:19:14] by the grace of God. But I just believe
[1:19:17] firmly in my heart that something is
[1:19:19] fixing to happen. I believe it's going
[1:19:21] to happen right in this assembly with
[1:19:23] people right in here. I believe that
[1:19:26] according to thy faith, according to the
[1:19:28] word being unto you. Yes, sir. Friends,
[1:19:31] I believe that otherwise I would not
[1:19:33] stand up here and sweat and preach. Yes,
[1:19:35] sir. And I've seen I thank God for the I
[1:19:38] thank the Lord for every trial, every
[1:19:40] suffering that I had to go through. I
[1:19:42] thank him down at the end. He come and
[1:19:43] give me the revelation why it is because
[1:19:45] he because you're called to it. See,
[1:19:48] everybody is not called to that, you
[1:19:50] know. So therefore, if you are called to
[1:19:52] it, thank God for it. See, it's a it's a
[1:19:55] very high calling. So then you realize
[1:19:57] it is a high calling. Then you press see
[1:20:00] toward the mark, the goal of it. See
[1:20:03] now, and we come right down to the goal.
[1:20:05] The capstone is the goal. See? And and
[1:20:07] he lines it up by the cross. So stay at
[1:20:10] that cross. Stay there. So the capstone
[1:20:13] come right in there. See now the
[1:20:16] prophet's message because tonight the
[1:20:17] restoration of the bridey I will restore
[1:20:20] saith the Lord. There's nobody going to
[1:20:23] stop me. And I'm even going to show it
[1:20:24] out here in the natural. The fruit is
[1:20:26] going to live in the top of that tree.
[1:20:28] The fourth stage is going to live. Amen.
[1:20:31] Do you love them? Praise be to God.
[1:20:33] Let's bow our heads. Brother Kirk.
