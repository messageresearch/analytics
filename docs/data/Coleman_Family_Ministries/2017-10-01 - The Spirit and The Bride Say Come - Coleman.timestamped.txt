[3:27] the people beginning to get a revelation
[3:29] of consecration in prayer as in dreams

[3:36] realize that role Pierre was it the same
[3:40] dream that I read and in Harrisburg and
[3:43] he got in early in the morning and said
[3:46] how to intend to enter revelation south
[3:49] sister sister Church Griffin was how to
[3:51] enter into the third pool which is the
[3:54] same thing
[3:57] because on the third pole is the
[4:00] revelation of Malachi for the opening of
[4:02] the word amen it's the same didn't know
[4:06] where it opens to you
[4:08] everything seems to be a long line of
[4:10] Prayer there's a there's many many
[4:13] testimonies and I could think of brother
[4:15] recording right here falling me 3:30
[4:18] quarter to 4:00 that he was on his way
[4:20] down
[4:21] how's the morning wait he must have the
[4:22] tape but he say he's coming down then
[4:24] I've and I checked later that he lives
[4:27] about an hour and a half away from the
[4:28] group in Massachusetts so we're gonna
[4:30] rectify it make sure you get some tapes
[4:32] amen but he drove down with his two
[4:35] sisters sister Sandra and Sonya and they
[4:37] were here Wednesday from Massachusetts
[4:40] to two and a half or three hours away
[4:42] but he was there and he gave a praise
[4:45] that his mind open Saint Luke 24 45 many
[4:51] more Minds opened that's what happened

[7:59] want to give a testimony for the glory
[8:01] of the Lord
[8:02] last week you hit it right on the nail
[8:04] thank you brother
[8:05] that was a gospel meal you were telling
[8:08] us how to enter into prayer by first
[8:11] giving praises to our Lord
[8:14] and then talking to him I knew in my
[8:16] heart there was something about praising
[8:18] and worshipping the Lord that I was
[8:20] missing On February 3rd as I was walking
[8:23] on my mail route I was talking to the
[8:26] Lord asking him how I could get his ear
[8:29] before I knew I was not coming to the
[8:32] Lord in the right way all of a sudden
[8:34] something inside of me said our Father
[8:37] who art in heaven hallowed be thy name
[8:40] they are all Lord I'll worship you I
[8:43] love you my father before you ever pray
[8:46] you worship Him and that he taught you
[8:48] how to pray he said here's how you pray
[8:52] amen the Lord's Prayer everything is in
[8:58] there for giving you enemies your
[9:00] debtors everything everything is in
[9:02] there amen
[9:04] and all of a sudden some inside me said
[9:08] our Father who art in heaven hallowed be
[9:09] thy name I see yes that's it praises be
[9:13] to his holy name that is part of our
[9:15] prayer is praising and worshiping his
[9:18] holy name as I went further down in the
[9:21] Lord's Prayer it says thy will be done
[9:23] we have to pray for his will not our
[9:26] will in our life also thinking thanking
[9:30] God for our daily bread for the food
[9:33] clothing shelter our good health and
[9:36] everything all the good carnal things
[9:39] and spiritual that he has given us jobs
[9:43] and homes or whatever he's given us and
[9:45] not take everything for granted like
[9:48] Americans do
[9:50] amen forgive us our trespasses Lord if I
[9:56] have done any one wrong in intentional
[10:00] or unintentional to anyone may they
[10:03] forgive me for if they don't it will
[10:06] hurt their their soul as we forgive
[10:09] those who trespass against us may we
[10:11] have believed kindness in prayer for
[10:14] anyone that has done us no harm for
[10:18] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[10:21] glory we may we worship the Lord Jesus
[10:25] who gets all the glory and honor I
[10:27] believe this is a secret place of
[10:30] Thunder it is for you hear the Thunder
[10:33] God's voice is Thunder for if we get
[10:36] into prayer by pour by praising and
[10:39] talking to the Lord all negative things

[10:47] figure out anything just be simple
[10:50] before God because the more you tried to
[10:53] figure it out the farther you get away
[10:55] from him just simply believe him thank
[10:59] you for your god-given ministry and

[23:12] head John the Baptist said you bunch of
[23:14] vipers and snakes Oh what are you
[23:19] talking about anybody may be seated
[23:23] they got all off on the nice quotes and
[23:26] then they build himself a little thing
[23:27] around that and leave that other stuff
[23:29] there that's for the Pentecostals or
[23:31] somebody and that's what you who brother
[23:34] that's what me him amen
[23:38] so anyway oh yeah what does I have here
[23:42] visitation that's right
[23:43] remember when I was reading about elder
[23:46] at last week I think yeah my elder at
[23:50] Kenya where where brother Bram had
[23:53] visited there into the African brother
[23:55] there
[23:56] on August 13 94 and brother bran was in
[24:00] the presence of the Lord he had been
[24:02] hearing all over elder ed and that's the
[24:05] stronghold of the the polygamists and
[24:07] nobody could get in and do anything
[24:11] immediately when angel was still there
[24:13] brother Branham in grey suit appeared
[24:15] and greeted the brother of us god bless
[24:17] you my precious brother he proceeded to
[24:20] say this in the presence of the angel of
[24:22] the Lord
[24:23] number one he did not expect a message
[24:25] to go the way it is now going and if I
[24:29] was going
[24:30] the preachers of the message have
[24:32] changed the message itself
[24:33] and they in that area did they change it
[24:35] and I know who did it
[24:37] and he came down and told the poor
[24:39] Africans with several wives that they
[24:42] can bring them into the message and just
[24:44] this Minister come from Europe and
[24:46] that's how they got all messed up in his
[24:48] eye and all down through there the Lord
[24:50] told me stay out of there for seventeen
[24:52] years ago to the right time amen so they
[24:57] changed the message itself number three
[25:00] the preachers and believers are quoting
[25:02] the message more than believing what he
[25:04] preached you can find it everywhere
[25:05] they're quote everything but forgiveness
[25:08] and brotherly kindness they'll quote
[25:10] everything but seven thunders
[25:12] they're quoting everything except that
[25:14] the saying the Seventh Seal is open but
[25:16] they're quoting quote and quote unquote
[25:17] they in the message so now you see
[25:20] waiting around up amen
[25:22] so the preachers are quoting the message
[25:24] more than believing what he preached
[25:26] many people have gone astray in the
[25:30] message backsliders they are they just
[25:34] look around all those will come through
[25:36] here where they are now back slidden
[25:38] and it's supposed to be in the message
[25:41] amen
[25:42] the only thing that the preacher the
[25:44] preachers have done is to bring people
[25:46] to the church and not to Christ that's
[25:50] why I preach as hard as I can to drive
[25:52] church members out of here praise God
[25:55] yes that's why I do it I don't want no
[25:57] church members say I could have 1500
[25:59] people around here I don't want them I
[26:01] want the elected predestinated seeds of
[26:05] God that can take that word and I nail
[26:08] it down
[26:09] a man may be seated
[26:13] so now you know why I do what saying do
[26:16] it what I'm doing but I know what I was
[26:18] doing I know all the impersonations I
[26:21] was gonna go through and down to the
[26:22] time for him to pour out the water I
[26:25] know what I was doing the time would
[26:27] come when the star day would be up in
[26:28] the heavens my god and be just a few
[26:31] short days praise God I know there be of
[26:34] people ready full of seed in their souls
[26:37] for the water-bearer to pour upon him
[26:41] hey man maybe a seeded the only thing
[26:45] the preachers have done is bringing
[26:46] people to church and not to Christ when
[26:49] we had time we wasted it rather than get
[26:53] on fire and come closer to God these
[26:57] people don't know that God has come down
[27:00] now he's quoting from 1 Thessalonians 4
[27:03] the Lord himself shall descend from
[27:06] heaven with a shout and a voices and
[27:07] Trump and I'm the raptured tape he said
[27:10] Jesus does all three and brother
[27:12] parameters telling the man here these
[27:13] people don't know that God has come down
[27:16] Elohim
[27:20] they'd up The ministers don't know it so
[27:24] here's a wonderful report from elder
[27:26] rent her brother John this fax me have
[27:30] just come back from elder Edda we're all
[27:32] this we're brother Ram appeared in 1994
[27:35] and the message was all messed up there
[27:37] now and the thunders is in there now
[27:39] just come back from elder ed and I had
[27:42] four wonderful service that have
[27:45] characterized or great outpouring of the
[27:47] Spirit the Brethren who were very happy
[27:50] we came up with an idea everybody's
[27:53] grabbing four tapes and everything so we
[27:55] had to come up with 90 or forming a
[27:57] Central Library and elder ed town that
[27:59] will serve over 30 churches in the
[28:03] vicinity of this town
[28:04] this was after hearing of the great
[28:06] demand and thirsty that the people have
[28:10] for your audio and videotapes because
[28:12] the need is so great it will really it
[28:15] will be really very hard to equipped
[28:18] everybody so I suggest you to talk to
[28:21] you to help in this matter to the
[28:23] provide elder aunt town with videotapes
[28:26] and to give them permission to give give
[28:29] and to get permission to give them audio
[28:32] tapes duplicated which he does by me
[28:35] three families in Ella read have the V
[28:37] CRM system and sister there open up her
[28:41] home for the Brethren and watching your
[28:44] videos she haven't been going to 400
[28:47] kilometres away to get the videos so
[28:50] therefore he says she told me that she
[28:54] has written
[28:55] several times anyway they are demanding
[28:59] now this is Ella read where brother
[29:01] branham visited this African brother and
[29:03] now what's going on in town a seventh on
[29:05] the revival the message that was changed
[29:09] was changed right back seven thunders

[29:18] end and here's a man you may be seated
[29:22] so now you know and we're gonna have a
[29:24] brother they already fires all over the

[29:30] jungle they just say seven thunders and
[29:32] fire falls and so it's all over the
[29:35] place in the east
[29:36] they cannot stop and put it out so
[29:40] [Applause]
[29:42] forget about it and one minister from
[29:46] Canada who poles the seven thunders for
[29:49] twenty years and came right next to us
[29:51] in Arusha two challenges and God emptied
[29:55] his meeting and they came in on me the

[32:01] in Wednesday night something happened
[32:03] tremendous of Pennsylvania they were
[32:05] gathered it was snowing and then while
[32:07] it was snowing
[32:08] they were sitting there and it couldn't
[32:10] hear the tape too good so the Holy
[32:12] Spirit led brother Dave Mac to cut off
[32:14] toward the end by the Holy Spirit and he
[32:17] had a book printed up and he and he read
[32:20] from there and a supernatural anointing
[32:23] came in behind him while he was reading
[32:26] brother Brown's words and anointing just
[32:29] it went out to the people and he hit
[32:31] those points in Saint Luke 24 and so
[32:34] your understanding is open and the
[32:36] people jump to the feet there was no
[32:38] song leader in the pulpit in
[32:39] Pennsylvania and they praise gone for 45
[32:42] minutes to an hour with the snow outside
[32:45] and they had to drive 11:30 at night in
[32:48] the snow but the anointing hit the place
[32:51] and they have not and they were not here
[32:54] last Sunday so God supernaturally come
[32:58] in to bring them together and they are
[33:00] seeing less on his tape today

[37:22] the Holy Ghost
[37:23] why because why we we have a revelation
[37:27] now because we are now on the third
[37:29] phase where the dynamics will strike the

[38:18] gonna say what I'm supposed to say
[38:19] anything
[38:20] I just don't know and that's why I like
[38:23] it let my mind go away that the mind of
[38:25] Christ move across so I'm looking for
[38:28] the mind of Christ to come in here today
[38:30] praise God amen now we know st. Luke's
[38:35] 1730 was L M and then coming down into
[38:39] profit in Genesis 18 and Sophie you know
[38:41] the whole story and we know that on
[38:44] Christ to reveal his own word that he
[38:46] called that the I time and he said
[38:49] there's nothing left one more moving one
[38:52] more faculty left that would be the
[38:54] intelligence and that's where I'm laying
[38:57] that my message today on the
[38:59] intelligence the mind of Christ amen so
[39:03] now we're here now now we know that what
[39:06] let me see what time is it here okay
[39:09] now we know that 1 Thessalonians 4:16
[39:13] the Lord himself shall descend from
[39:16] heaven with a shout and voice it in a
[39:19] trunk and we know that the shout now we
[39:22] know was the I time to seeing time to
[39:25] take us through 30 years of darkness to
[39:28] see where we was at is that correct and
[39:30] we had a guide the word to take us all
[39:34] the way the last 30 years many have fell
[39:37] in ditches and everywhere else but by
[39:39] the grace of God because your
[39:41] predestinated my god has led you all the
[39:44] way
[39:45] you could not go into a ditch you
[39:48] couldn't fall in there because your
[39:50] predestinated a man for purpose you're
[39:55] going to receive something hallelujah so
[40:01] alright you may be seated

[40:08] remember jesus said as it wasn't an age
[40:10] of Sodom what happened just before Sodom

[40:26] typical you'll see that and I was
[40:28] bringing in the King language lamb
[40:29] worship for now any man so what happened
[40:36] just before Sodom God came down with
[40:39] some angels and then I watch they had an
[40:42] investigation judgment see was been
[40:46] going on for 30 years

[40:55] great so I come down the final weather
[40:58] is all together the truth or not and I'm
[41:01] gonna come down through my prophet for
[41:03] about three years and I'm going to lay

[41:10] the world

[41:21] whether it's all together the truth or
[41:23] not is that right

[44:09] once on this third phase in part one you
[44:13] add to your faith the seven virtues
[44:14] there then when you get up to charity
[44:17] him himself steps into your statue of a
[44:20] perfect man

[46:15] own as his we have no sign of her own
[46:18] how can a man for see these things he
[46:20] can't do it it's God himself he's
[46:22] becoming to a place he's governed the
[46:24] body all the way through then a complete
[46:26] party of Christ is revealing a form of a
[46:28] bride that was taken out of his side
[46:30] like Adam did at the beginning and Adam
[46:33] was rather at the at the beginning and
[46:36] then he said on page 39 notice now

[46:59] time Malachi for the seein see now there
[47:04] is a one moving faculty beyond the eye

[1:26:25] brotherly love holy decency placing the
[1:26:27] Christ here in there your soul yes sir
[1:26:33] and you say page 34 a really thought
[1:26:37] upon the Bible in the Bible's got to be
[1:26:39] in you that's why every mystery was in
[1:26:42] the parable the seven thunders open it
[1:26:44] up and we preached it here and now is in
[1:26:47] you the Bible is in you you're walking
[1:26:50] Bible all you need is water to pour the
[1:26:56] water on you
[1:26:58] hey Mon the word is a seed as long as
[1:27:02] this lane here won't do nothing amen
[1:27:05] but when it comes in here when it comes
[1:27:07] into the heart then it begins to
[1:27:09] manifest by the Holy Spirit the works of
[1:27:11] God then visions come power comes
[1:27:13] humility comes all you know it all is
[1:27:16] gone you become nothing Christ becomes
[1:27:18] the line you die he lives there it is
[1:27:20] because he died I live when I die he
[1:27:24] lives again when I die he promised me
[1:27:26] lying and I died out to myself so all I
[1:27:28] could have his life and how do I do it
[1:27:30] by taking his word his seed put his seed
[1:27:33] in here by faith and believe him then it
[1:27:36] produces exactly what the Bible said and
[1:27:38] the season in the time and we end the
[1:27:41] time and we end the season now I
[1:27:42] declared to be soul
[1:27:44] yes sir read page 42 it's all right so
[1:27:49] all so believers of the word and spirits
[1:27:53] who back to word and spirit we actually
[1:27:55] now took all these year 30 years to get
[1:27:58] back to what brother branmer originally
[1:28:00] preached the spoken words original see
[1:28:02] we finally come back to it back to the
[1:28:06] Bible back to the Bible principles laid
[1:28:09] down on the day of Pentecost we're
[1:28:11] finally out here oh my alright so
[1:28:16] believers that of the word and spirit
[1:28:18] must be one you get it believe it's the
[1:28:20] word and the spirit absolutely one you
[1:28:23] don't do your own thinking now and I'm
[1:28:24] gonna strike my text here now you don't
[1:28:26] do your own thinking you don't use your
[1:28:28] own mind
[1:28:29] isn't that wonderful the - in Christ is
[1:28:32] in you see I might not intelligence huh
[1:28:35] the mine is in Christ and you will take
[1:28:37] the word just like he did because he was
[1:28:40] the word and the mind of Christ in you
[1:28:43] you are the word you that you a God's
[1:28:45] living worried representatives of him on
[1:28:47] earth here on earth continuing the work
[1:28:51] then right the church should be that way
[1:28:54] and when so the Bible is manifested

[1:28:59] disciples just like the disciples the
[1:29:01] Bible does living again in you

[1:29:28] so the Bible's manifested again like in
[1:29:30] early days of Christ because you are a
[1:29:33] predestinated seed just like Christ was
[1:29:36] and when the rain falls on the seed the
[1:29:39] life produces itself when the Holy
[1:29:41] Spirit falls when it fell on those seed
[1:29:43] that Jesus said he chose them when
[1:29:45] before the foundation of the world then

[1:29:59] the understanding to joelle to 28
[1:30:01] you mean that that's what Jowell meant
[1:30:04] in the last day they pour out the Spirit
[1:30:06] on us and Jesus said yes what a
[1:30:08] revelation my god the understanding was
[1:30:12] open and it went up into the upper room
[1:30:14] with praising God with joy returned to
[1:30:18] Jerusalem with joy without the Holy
[1:30:20] Ghost
[1:30:21] because they knew that they knew it was
[1:30:23] coming down and we're here we got the
[1:30:26] sign into heaven oh my god you know it's

[1:52:19] church and all that God was reporting
[1:52:22] the crimes and all the crimes was he
[1:52:24] poured in the church so the church has
[1:52:26] the power to crimes head crimes had the
[1:52:29] power that God had and he said at that
[1:52:32] day you know that I'm in the father the

[2:00:47] on the road that when the church would
[2:00:49] be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit
[2:00:52] mankind slowed away from themselves that
[2:00:54] they don't see their themselves they
[2:00:57] don't have no motives and but serve God
[2:01:01] when their thoughts move on when they
[2:01:04] refuse the things of the world they just
[2:01:07] move in the spirit they just live in the
[2:01:09] spirit moving the spirit walk in the
[2:01:12] spirit so fulfill the law of Christ then

[2:07:07] snapshots this is a true meaning of the
[2:07:09] double triangle it models the critical

[2:07:55] 8:24 54 I'm looking for the council one
[2:07:58] day to lead the Gentile people return to
[2:08:00] the Jew I've seen the picture of the
[2:08:01] night a very dear friend of mine on the
[2:08:04] west coast a Christian businessman mr.
[2:08:06] organ bright and he had a picture called
[2:08:08] three minutes at midnight I've never
[2:08:10] been the same since then after seeing
[2:08:12] this wonderful picture it showed the
[2:08:14] answers of all the prophecies pertained
[2:08:16] to the Jews how they believed return
[2:08:18] back and how they'd be an ensign at
[2:08:21] their return the six point star David
[2:08:26] over Jerusalem
[2:08:28] this is 1954 in New York huh and he said
[2:08:35] there would be a 6-point star of david'
[2:08:39] over jerusalem but it also appeared over
[2:08:42] New York City at the same time I tell
[2:08:46] you look friends I don't know whether to
[2:08:49] run down the aisle and shout what to do
[2:08:52] amen Sixpoint star over jerusalem how
[2:08:57] that the water that comes from the
[2:08:59] country to blossom as a role see the
[2:09:03] water again the desert wood in the Jews
[2:09:05] returning Bank it was just a picture
[2:09:08] threw it on the screen but here was the
[2:09:10] alarming part Christian the ships were
[2:09:12] coming in the airplanes coming in they
[2:09:14] were bringing the old blind and hall
[2:09:16] with her packed the younger people
[2:09:18] packed them so they interviewed a few of
[2:09:21] them and they said are you coming back
[2:09:23] to your homeland to dine in homeland no
[2:09:25] we're coming back to see the Messiah you
[2:09:28] know what are you looking for in this
[2:09:29] third phase Messiah the outpouring of
[2:09:32] the Holy Ghost Messiah is on the earth
[2:09:35] now hallelujah oh you Bible readers know
[2:09:41] what that means
[2:09:42] yeah God's just drives it from all parts
[2:09:46] of the world right bang just what he
[2:09:47] said he would do now what what they need
[2:09:49] now the next thing I can see I don't
[2:09:51] claim it to know much about prophecy at
[2:09:54] that time only thing I can see left is a
[2:09:56] spiritual awakening Hmong seduced and
[2:09:59] Gentiles are finished in church will be
[2:10:01] caught up the gospel goes to the Jews
[2:10:03] amen and where we were staying in on the
[2:10:07] same message right here in New York but
[2:10:09] what I think the law is gonna make his
[2:10:11] message so quick to the world is this
[2:10:14] that he's gonna send out the power and
[2:10:16] the demonstration of the holy spirit
[2:10:18] that this illuminate the whole world in
[2:10:20] just a few days time
[2:10:23] I believe he's calling a church pulling
[2:10:26] up people getting them together for this
[2:10:27] great event that's coming to pass across
[2:10:30] the answer number six 1954
[2:10:32] page 41 oh brother give me a church full
[2:10:35] of the Holy Ghost God will do in one

[2:10:43] anointing of the church really strikes
