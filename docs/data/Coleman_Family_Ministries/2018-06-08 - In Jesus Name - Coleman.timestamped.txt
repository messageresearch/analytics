[0:00] I'm reading from st. John the 14th
[0:02] chapter verse 16 through to 26 verse and
[0:08] a sixteenth chapter verse 23 through the
[0:11] 31st verse a neuromas 8 26 and 27 I'm
[0:19] reading from Saint John the 14th chapter
[0:22] 16 verse and I will pray the father and
[0:27] he shall give you another comforter that
[0:29] he may abide with you forever
[0:31] even the Spirit of Truth whom the world
[0:33] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[0:35] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[0:37] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[0:40] I will not leave you comfortless I will
[0:43] come to you yet a little while in the
[0:45] world seeth me no more because the world
[0:48] wasn't going to see Jesus Christ in the
[0:49] flesh anymore
[0:50] he was going to ascend up into heaven
[0:52] and take his seat at the right hand of
[0:54] God the seat of power and authority but
[0:57] ye shall see me but we have a promise
[1:00] that we're going to see him in the form
[1:01] of the comforter the Holy Ghost because
[1:04] I live ye shall live also at that day he
[1:08] shall know that I am in my father ye and
[1:11] me and I in you he did hath my
[1:13] Commandments and keepeth them he it is
[1:15] that loveth me he that loveth me shall
[1:18] be loved of my father and I will love
[1:20] him and will manifest myself to him
[1:23] Judas saith unto him not Iscariot Lord
[1:26] how is it that thou will manifest
[1:28] thyself into US and other unto the world
[1:31] and jesus answered said unto him if a
[1:35] man love me he will keep my words and my
[1:37] father will love him and we will come
[1:39] unto him and make our abode with him he
[1:42] that loveth me not keeping not my
[1:44] sayings and the word which he hear is
[1:47] not mine but the fathers which sent me
[1:49] these things have I spoken unto you
[1:51] being yet present with you but the
[1:54] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[1:56] the father will send in my name he shall
[1:58] teach you all things and bring all
[2:01] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[2:04] have said unto you in sixteenth chapter
[2:08] verse 23
[2:11] and in that day you shall ask me nothing
[2:14] verily verily I say unto you whatsoever
[2:18] ye shall ask the Father in my name he
[2:21] will give it he will give it you a
[2:25] hitter to have you ants nothing my name
[2:28] ask and you shall receive
[2:30] that you join me before these things
[2:33] have I spoken unto you in Proverbs but
[2:35] the time cometh when I shall no more
[2:37] speaking to you in Proverbs but I shall
[2:39] show you plainly of the father at that
[2:42] day you shall ask in my name and I say
[2:45] not unto you that I will pray the Father
[2:48] for you for the father himself love with
[2:51] you because ye have loved me and have
[2:53] believed that I came out from God I came
[2:58] forth from the father and am come into
[3:01] the world again I leave the world and go
[3:04] to the father his disciples said unto
[3:06] Him lo now speaketh now plainly and
[3:09] speakers no proverb now are we sure that
[3:13] thou knowest all things and needeth not
[3:15] that any man should ask thee by this we
[3:19] believe that thou Kamath forth from God
[3:20] and Jesus said unto them answer them do
[3:23] you now believe in Romans 8 chapter 26
[3:29] verse likewise the spirit also helpeth
[3:33] our infirmities for we know not what we
[3:35] should pray for as we ought but the
[3:38] Spirit itself make it intercession for
[3:40] us with groanings which cannot be
[3:42] uttered and he that searches the heart
[3:45] knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit
[3:47] because he maketh intercession for the
[3:50] Saints according to the will of God may
[3:54] the Lord a blessing to the reading of
[3:56] his word you may be seated we like to
[3:59] take a title on it this tonight in Jesus
[4:02] name what a beautiful name
[4:05] what our all-powerful name what an
[4:08] all-conquering name in the name of Jesus
[4:12] and so now tonight's little thought just
[4:16] a little Bible teaching for the little
[4:19] class that has come out tonight and just
[4:22] something to drop in a horse
[4:25] thought this a couple of hours ago got
[4:27] it together so much is going on I'm
[4:29] trying to get myself ready to go family
[4:31] and I and as you know I'm going to
[4:33] Arizona Saturday and so and coming by
[4:38] here Sunday was brother younger from
[4:39] England and his wife and brother Hank
[4:42] and brother hunt and I sure we should
[4:44] enjoy him one day he stayed over Monday
[4:46] and we had a wonderful time with brother
[4:48] Hank and he's a fine brother and the
[4:51] brother younger the lower lip is hard to
[4:55] give us a message about prayer and we
[5:00] thank the Lord for all things and
[5:01] therefore we realized that it was the
[5:04] Lord speaking for the abundance of the
[5:07] revelation which has come forth to this
[5:10] assembly in particular and it didn't
[5:13] come in so much just coming up on top of
[5:15] us we Harley which is stager from one to
[5:18] another and I been screaming out to you
[5:21] in between that you got to pray you see
[5:24] and otherwise it's just sits there and
[5:26] doesn't go nowhere and in just from the
[5:29] right season I feel myself that the Holy
[5:31] Spirit sent this brother alone and of
[5:34] course him have a net ministry for 20
[5:37] years that was his message maybe
[5:41] somewhere America wouldn't have preached
[5:42] that if he followed what I mean see and
[5:44] they might want to give a bone or
[5:46] something you know but that was his
[5:48] message so him coming into the message
[5:50] well that's what he knows he doesn't
[5:51] know the bones yet thank God it doesn't
[5:53] and so therefore a simple message on
[5:57] prayer and the Lord used what was in his
[6:00] heart which that's what his message and
[6:02] gave it out to us Sunday night and I
[6:05] think it was right on the button as we
[6:08] would say and so I feel that that's just
[6:12] what is needed a prayer and so then I
[6:15] thought I was just followed up a little
[6:16] bit and come back around and speak about
[6:19] praying in Jesus name with all their
[6:21] power and authority that we have you see
[6:24] rather than letting it lay maybe that
[6:26] something we can do to bring down on the
[6:29] blessings know is this that we like to
[6:32] is according to the will of God and then
[6:34] you got it lined up right see so we
[6:36] don't want to
[6:37] leaving in Lucien's so to speak so
[6:40] therefore tonight I just wanted to talk
[6:42] a little bit about the Holy Spirit I
[6:44] love to talk about the Holy Spirit
[6:45] because when I talk about the Holy
[6:47] Spirit I get blessed and he comes around
[6:50] me stronger and stronger did you ever
[6:53] notice that there we begin to praise Him
[6:55] and talk about him the president God
[6:57] just sweeps down like a dove around you
[6:59] amen and you begin to get caught up into
[7:01] heaven II places Amen all the things of
[7:05] this world begin to leave you and you
[7:07] begin to be getting out of yourself
[7:09] amen then then all the all things look
[7:12] real to you everything that other things
[7:15] the the things that don't mean anything
[7:18] is just just leave you and fade away the
[7:21] Bible becomes real amen
[7:24] then the word just begins to move and
[7:26] jump out at you he said that's right and
[7:28] begin to get blessed in your heart well
[7:30] that's the Holy Spirit that is the
[7:32] comforter that's why he was sent he was
[7:35] to ascend and I think the word comes out
[7:37] of studying somewhere that where
[7:39] comforter has to do it fort you know
[7:42] like a fortress you see it comes out of
[7:44] that word there in the Greek there
[7:46] somewhere and so we know that the
[7:48] comforter is a for to us it guards us
[7:50] you know and keeps the enemy away from
[7:52] us praise God and those of us that have
[7:55] received the the the comforter in the
[7:58] soul well then we're on our way to
[8:00] heaven amen and we have it in our soul
[8:03] and we know that we can receive diseases
[8:09] in our bodies and whatnot the body isn't
[8:11] a Redeem yet but we have a promise of
[8:14] earnest in our souls that is going to be
[8:16] redeemed amen and we on our way to the
[8:19] full adoption and before we come to the
[8:22] full adoption at the resurrection Speirs
[8:25] of Vail drops down over our human
[8:28] spirits and then we sort of get a rap
[8:31] chin faith that we know that we know
[8:33] that we know
[8:35] amen and then we go on into the
[8:36] reservation to the full adoption so the
[8:39] adoption of course is the Holy Spirit
[8:41] I'd say in three pulls a pole for our
[8:44] soul where we in heavenly places and
[8:47] then a prophet of God come along and
[8:49] begin to teach us and restore the word
[8:51] back and then he gives us another pole
[8:53] that's the the pull the the capstone in
[8:57] love coming down where it's the Holy
[9:00] Ghost and we know it and that's what
[9:02] happened to the early church and then
[9:03] that's when not only is your soul
[9:05] quicken your mechanics your body is
[9:08] quick and also that's when you can lay
[9:10] hands upon a sick and a sick recover
[9:12] just like that that's when the Holy
[9:14] Spirit overshadowed Peter and they were
[9:16] even healing Peters shadow there was a
[9:18] shadow of the Holy Spirit so talking
[9:21] about the Holy Spirit tonight not to
[9:23] hold you too long the Holy Spirit had a
[9:26] certain job to do on the earth here and
[9:29] it was that the administration of the
[9:31] Spirit now to the Holy Spirit has been
[9:34] committed the administration of the
[9:36] church until the Lord returns and glory
[9:39] Jesus Christ in the flesh itself the
[9:42] Lord Himself was going to leave us and
[9:45] he couldn't trust anybody else but
[9:48] himself so he went all up into high aim
[9:52] and he is sending all up high and he
[9:54] gave gifts unto men and descended as the
[9:58] Holy Ghost and end of on that the
[10:01] fortieth day when he he himself a
[10:03] present tense
[10:04] corporal body was ascending he told him
[10:08] to wait on him and at the end he went on
[10:11] up and he would descend in the form of
[10:12] the Holy Ghost and he would give gifts
[10:14] unto men now he was the one who was
[10:17] going to give the gifts the Holy Spirit
[10:20] and then they would have to wait before
[10:22] it did anything the only thing that they
[10:24] were allowed to do was to pray and bless
[10:26] his name and thank him for the Holy
[10:28] Ghost for it was just as well as they
[10:30] had at them because he he breathed upon
[10:33] him and said receive ye the Holy Ghost
[10:35] and therefore all they had to do was a
[10:37] thank him and to bless him and praise
[10:39] him for it they didn't have the Holy
[10:41] Ghost they didn't have any doubts in
[10:42] their mind they
[10:43] on one Accord it was 120 agreeing with
[10:48] one Accord as touching one thing that he
[10:52] was going to fill him with the Holy
[10:53] Ghost amen now this was a Courtin to the
[10:57] will of God so how could they lose how
[11:00] could they miss out when they were
[11:02] praying according to the will of God for
[11:04] God Himself stood there and gave out his
[11:06] will that they would wait for the Holy
[11:09] Ghost so as if any two would agree
[11:11] touching any one thing is fine for you
[11:13] know you can be agreed like in a night
[11:15] and his wife was agreed touching one
[11:17] thing also amen but see it but as well
[11:20] as agreed is touching something by the
[11:22] will of God is altogether different now
[11:25] so then that the Holy Spirit has been
[11:27] committed to administration of the
[11:29] church and his oversight extends to the
[11:33] slightest detail in the ordering of
[11:36] God's house if that's why you see the
[11:39] Holy Spirit working down through the
[11:41] pasture associate pastor the elders the
[11:43] deacon the song leader that helps to
[11:46] government right down to the tapes and
[11:48] into the mothers in the nursery that's
[11:50] the Holy Spirit over the whole thing and
[11:51] he's he watches the details now because
[11:55] it's got to be according to the Word of
[11:56] God that's why we don't like to see
[11:58] nobody's loving walking around a neocon
[12:00] a slip slide way for the Holy Spirit is
[12:03] diligent about these things you see to
[12:05] me now and so his uh his oversee he
[12:08] takes the oversight and it extends to
[12:10] the slightest detail in the ordering of
[12:13] God's house and holding all in
[12:15] subjection to the will of the head
[12:17] si and directing all in harmony with
[12:20] God's divine plan and he doesn't speak
[12:22] anything or on his own he will not bring
[12:25] a new revelation on his own is only what
[12:27] he hears
[12:28] amen what he has heard from the head
[12:31] which is Jesus Christ the word you'll
[12:34] only bring the word now so when you have
[12:36] a new revelation that's not here they
[12:38] see I mean they're only what he hears he
[12:39] gives to you see because jesus said he
[12:41] will take of mine the word and show it
[12:44] unto you
[12:44] and then he'll bring it back to your
[12:47] remembrance and show you things that
[12:49] come which is still the word you see
[12:50] like he did in the seven seals that's
[12:52] things to come and he showed us that but
[12:54] that wasn't a word
[12:55] praise the Lord now whether the
[12:57] authority of this one ruling sovereign
[13:00] Holy Ghost listen now be recognized or
[13:04] ignored determines whether the church
[13:07] shall be in Anarchy or a unity you see
[13:11] in other words if you're going to give
[13:14] respect to the Holy Spirit and I
[13:16] recognize the sovereign Holy Spirit in
[13:18] your church and you want to give respect
[13:21] to it then you're going to have a Church
[13:23] of unity but then if you want to feel to
[13:26] your free soul and your group in this
[13:27] message and you don't you and the
[13:29] message between in the word and then if
[13:32] the Word of God is saying the head is
[13:34] saying that he has a apostles and
[13:36] prophets pastors banners and teachers
[13:37] just as an illustration and you would
[13:39] have a group somewhere you said well we
[13:41] don't have to have that because the
[13:42] 7-day jizz all over it and so forth and
[13:44] so on
[13:44] we'll see that's anarchy because he
[13:47] didn't say that that's not in the Word
[13:48] of God that's your owner had thereby to
[13:50] see to me now and the Holy Spirit is
[13:52] there to order these things then if you
[13:56] won't listen to him then you are being
[13:58] lawless you won't take the word of the
[14:00] Lord see and then are instead of having
[14:03] a temple of the Holy Ghost you have a
[14:06] synagogue of lawless ones and in hina
[14:09] world can you be blessed but we thank
[14:11] God that we have Liberty here tonight a
[14:13] man with a spear the Lord is there's
[14:15] Liberty Liberty for what look we have
[14:18] Liberty in New York City for God to
[14:20] speak and act his will this will right
[14:24] here through us which begets loyalty
[14:28] then you become more loyal to him not to
[14:31] me and not to the ministers but to him
[14:34] see and now it doesn't give you a
[14:37] Liberty to for us to act as we will see
[14:40] then that begets lawlessness amen now as
[14:45] you notice in each stage of the seven
[14:47] church age Bank sliding each time of
[14:49] voice was heard from heaven through one
[14:51] of the seven angels saying he did hath
[14:53] an ear let him hear what the who the
[14:55] Spirit the comforter the administrator
[14:58] says unto the church
[15:00] amen each time they slide away a little
[15:02] bit and lawlessness and what anarchy and
[15:04] so forth then a messenger would come on
[15:07] the scene and rebuke it and bring it
[15:09] back but it would be the Holy Spirit
[15:11] through the messenger rebuking the
[15:13] church age amen and bringing it back to
[15:15] what the head who's sitting down at the
[15:17] throne
[15:18] praise God he's the head of all things
[15:21] he's the head stone the color stone the
[15:23] capstone is sitting there and he sent
[15:25] himself the Holy Spirit praise the Lord
[15:28] amen and the Spirit of God would speak
[15:31] he'd a half an ear let him hear what the
[15:33] spirit saith unto the church to the
[15:35] churches see the spirit always calling
[15:38] the people back from false doctrine to
[15:40] listen to the voice of the true
[15:42] counselor the mighty God the everlasting
[15:44] father praise God now the Holy Spirit
[15:47] gave some apostles and passes Evangeline
[15:50] teaches Ephesians 4:11 and in the one
[15:53] event now when Christ descended I mean
[15:57] ascended up into heaven Christ and his
[16:00] corporal body he took his seat in heaven
[16:03] as the head over all things to his
[16:06] church now as he went up the Holy Spirit
[16:10] came down ten days later he went up took
[16:13] his seat at the right hand which is the
[16:14] authority to power then 10 days later he
[16:17] sent down the comforter amen and when
[16:20] the comforter in the other event the
[16:22] Holy Spirit came down to begin the work
[16:25] of building up the body of Christ amen
[16:28] and in between that appeared on what was
[16:31] supposed to anything at all but they
[16:34] went in here and he voted through
[16:36] man-made system Matthias to be to be an
[16:40] apostle now if the head himself had just
[16:44] he had just a point of them Apostles
[16:46] himself how could they appoint a pasta
[16:48] when the Holy Ghost is the Ministry of
[16:50] the church and he has a divine order
[16:53] apostles and prophets pastors vendors
[16:55] and teachers then how can a Pope come
[16:57] along talk about a cardinal you follow
[17:00] me now are these our Pope's and
[17:02] Cardinals and potentates and whatnot
[17:04] that's not in the divine order that's
[17:06] anarchy it's impossible for God to even
[17:09] bless that because not in the original
[17:11] Bible here
[17:12] amen so and the Holy Spirit didn't say
[17:15] it you see so now of course it is the
[17:18] head who directs the construction of the
[17:21] body as being fitly framed together it
[17:25] groweth and into a holy temple in the
[17:27] Lord now back in Joel 38 the thirtieth
[17:31] chapter I'll get it this is what it says
[17:33] here Joel that had been having a
[17:36] wonderful time with his church friends
[17:38] and enemies and so forth and they've
[17:40] been they were because rebuking him and
[17:42] whatnot the long about the 38th chapter
[17:44] God come on the scene hit in a whirlwind
[17:47] amen and then the Lord answered job out
[17:50] the whirlwind and said who is just at
[17:52] darkness counsel by words without
[17:54] knowledge gird up now die Lawrence like
[17:57] a man for I will demand of thee in
[17:59] Amsterdam eat where was I when I laid
[18:01] the foundations of the earth declared
[18:04] thou hath understanding who had laid the
[18:06] measures thereof if thou know'st it or
[18:09] who has stretched the line upon it
[18:11] whereupon or the foundations there are
[18:13] fastened or who laid the cornerstone
[18:16] there o when the morning stars sang
[18:18] together and all the sons of God shouted
[18:21] for joy here was God the whirlwind the
[18:25] great I am who who always is Amen who
[18:29] always existed the eternal one ask in
[18:32] Joel where were you
[18:33] praise God he says where was I when I
[18:35] laid the foundations of the earth now
[18:37] job knew over in job 26 the seventh
[18:40] verse here just want to drop this into
[18:42] you here he knew himself that in the
[18:45] sixth verse Hill is naked before him
[18:48] destruction had no covering he stretches
[18:51] out the north over the empty place and
[18:53] hangeth the earth upon nothing so a job
[18:57] knew that the earth was hanging as a
[18:58] ball on nothing just in space and here's
[19:01] God asking him about the weary you at
[19:04] when the foundation the foundations was
[19:06] laid and as I'm persuaded tonight that
[19:10] Joel God knew that Joel when he was back
[19:13] with him even Jobe could see their
[19:15] pyramid itself because brother the
[19:17] prophet of God told her enoch built it
[19:19] so it must have been there when he was
[19:20] there
[19:21] and therefore in but I'm persuaded here
[19:24] that of God and the world was talking
[19:27] about a pyramid as we've been taught the
[19:30] first Bible the stars in the pyramid and
[19:32] in the written Bible amen so therefore
[19:34] here is God I believe before the
[19:37] foundation of the world talking to job
[19:39] here
[19:39] Amen honking about a pyramid and Joel
[19:42] was familiar with it it had four
[19:44] foundation stones and also here it says
[19:47] because it had a cornerstone also
[19:50] cornerstone or a capstone or a headstone
[19:53] now if you notice in the sixth verse
[19:56] foundations is distinct from the
[19:58] cornerstone and it was not until the
[20:00] building was completed by lane of the
[20:03] chief Cornerstone or T or the capstone
[20:05] that the sons of God must have been all
[20:08] around God and glory and when he was
[20:10] building his church back there you
[20:12] follow me now and then when he saw the
[20:14] caps don't cap it the sons of God
[20:16] shouted for joy and the morning stars
[20:18] sang together before the foundation of
[20:20] the world praise God when he saw it and
[20:22] then they saw the great pyramid and we
[20:25] know as according to scripture here the
[20:28] great pyramid is the only form of
[20:30] building that conforms to the symbolic
[20:33] description of the spiritual building
[20:35] over in Ephesians 2 as Paul speaks over
[20:38] there a spoken of in Scripture or which
[20:40] Christ is said to be the chief
[20:42] Cornerstone just to give you the
[20:43] scripture itself now therefore ye are no
[20:47] more strangers and foreigners but
[20:48] fellow-citizens of the saints you know
[20:50] the household of God and are built upon
[20:53] the foundation of the apostles and
[20:55] prophets and Jesus Christ Himself being
[20:58] the chief Cornerstone so we see our
[21:00] foundation the apostles and prophets
[21:02] amen and we see our cornerstone and we
[21:06] know it from the teaching of the hour
[21:07] that the foundation back in the Old
[21:10] Testament was Abraham faith amen and
[21:13] Isaac love and Jacob Grace and Joseph
[21:16] perfection and there was a four corner
[21:20] foundation there and up on top of that
[21:22] God built a body of prophets prophetic
[21:25] body that was the body the word is the
[21:27] body amen and then John the Baptist
[21:30] being at the top of the head up there
[21:31] near
[21:32] and he come forth in the didn't they the
[21:34] capstone at that time Jesus Christ come
[21:37] forward to camp off the old testament
[21:39] pyramid as we understand it symbolically
[21:43] of course and then Christ with the
[21:46] foundation of faith in love and grace
[21:50] and faith pour that into his disciples
[21:53] and they took that message of the Holy
[21:56] Ghost or the justification rather
[21:58] sanctification he sent down the Holy
[22:00] Ghost which was the baptism of the Holy
[22:03] Ghost plus the perfection in all in one
[22:06] for a Philly horse with the Holy Ghost
[22:08] and quickened their mechanics into
[22:11] perfection a many headed one shot and
[22:14] but God had to restore it back through
[22:16] four different stages that time it took
[22:18] three stages and that's why he had the
[22:21] funny doctrines today you know there's
[22:23] nobody got the Holy Ghost sanctified see
[22:25] because it was three then but it's four
[22:26] now because he said it was four Amen so
[22:29] it's got to come back out that way see
[22:30] so therefore we see then that there is
[22:34] no chief Cornerstone in any
[22:36] architectural construction but in a
[22:38] building a pyramidal foam and in the
[22:41] shape it is exactly like the building it
[22:44] tops out so a pyramid building come up
[22:46] like is here the capstone got to be flat
[22:48] to fit up on top of it and it has four
[22:50] corners and and also five sides to it
[22:52] see now it is the angles
[22:54] therefore the pyramid must be angled to
[22:57] the capstone that's why I said a
[22:59] building fitly framed together and it's
[23:02] a five-sided building there is no place
[23:04] for it in the building see now they
[23:07] would have any need for a capstone if
[23:09] it's going to be on the top it would
[23:11] just get in the way so therefore there's
[23:14] no place for a capstone or the headstone
[23:16] in the building until the finishing
[23:18] touch is given and therefore the
[23:20] builders rejected it until needed so we
[23:23] a read of christ in psalms 118 about
[23:28] being a rejected want to read it to you
[23:31] psalm 118 22 to stone which the builders
[23:35] refused has become the head stone of the
[23:39] corner and so we see now that Christ is
[23:42] the head stone the stone which to
[23:45] disallowed refuse in Psalms 118 the same
[23:50] as made to hit at a corner and he was a
[23:52] stone of stumbling and a rock of offense
[23:55] to the Jews and the Scriptures first
[23:58] Peter - I'll just skip through to give
[23:59] the scriptures and Romans 9 32 and 33
[24:02] the capstone of a pyramid until needed
[24:04] would be in a way and a stone of
[24:07] stumbling and a rock of offence to the
[24:09] workmen so what Christ in Paul said that
[24:12] we preach Jesus crucified unto the Jews
[24:15] a stumbling-block until the Greeks
[24:17] foolishness and also Raqqa offense in
[24:20] Christ crucified is the rock and to the
[24:25] church he is the foundation and a chief
[24:28] Cornerstone to the Jews at his first
[24:30] coming they stumble over Jesus Christ he
[24:33] was a stumbling stone to Israel his
[24:35] second coming he's going to be the
[24:37] headstone of the corner according to
[24:39] Zechariah 4 he said that the headstone
[24:42] come forth with shoutings grace grace
[24:43] unto the headstone as at his second
[24:46] coming and to the Gentile world powers
[24:49] at the smiting he's a stone cut out
[24:51] without hands and Daniels 2nd chapter
[24:54] xxxiv verse 2 the unbelievers the same
[24:56] Matthew 21 44 he is the crushing stone
[25:00] of judgment and from the Scriptures I
[25:02] believe at the Great Pyramid is symbolic
[25:04] of the spiritual building of which
[25:06] Christ is the chief capstone who then is
[25:09] the head the chief architect and he
[25:13] directs the construction of the body of
[25:16] Jesus Christ it is the heavenly Christ
[25:19] who's sittin in he sitting now as we
[25:22] understand it he's already descending he
[25:26] just send it with a shout with a with
[25:29] the voice of the Archangel and with the
[25:31] Trump of God and just I'm gonna get you
[25:35] out on term tonight a minute I didn't
[25:37] want I didn't go into nowhere could have
[25:39] going here and going there there brother

[25:42] myself no more 9:30 quarter to 10:00 in
[25:44] Tenafly only get you home tonight and
[25:46] the chief architect and he directs the
[25:48] construction of the body and it is the
[25:51] heavenly Christ waiting for the earthly
[25:53] Christ a Holy Spirit
[25:56] now Jesus Christ said that we want to
[25:59] come dis down I'm only directedness
[26:01] to a prayer I'm going away o family now
[26:05] and we need you to pray but I want you
[26:07] to know the power in prayer so when you

[26:24] night just keep it simple and drive down

[26:30] God
[26:30] now the earthly Christ is the holy
[26:34] spirit and he come down on the fiftieth
[26:38] day we understand it now the heavenly
[26:40] Christ is Jesus Christ Himself the
[26:42] corporal buddy he's at the right hand of
[26:44] power he's there waiting for our prayers
[26:46] to come up to stand before the father a
[26:49] man he's waiting see and then the
[26:52] earthly Christ is down here on the earth
[26:55] that's why the prophet of God it doesn't
[26:56] mean anything if you have the Holy Ghost
[26:58] baptism you got to be a seed because
[27:01] false knowing to have the Holy Ghost
[27:03] baptism in their spirit and do all kind
[27:05] of signs wonders and miracles and that's
[27:07] why the world gets full when they say
[27:09] well look at this man's life and whatnot
[27:10] and he's healing the sick and cast out
[27:12] devils and been looking at that man but
[27:14] they never see it at all they never see
[27:16] the real dollar bill they always want to
[27:18] look at the false the D Conniff it but
[27:21] before you can have a confident so I'm
[27:24] talking about the real one tonight amen

[41:33] Spirit Holy Spirit mediatorial office
[41:36] within us intercession inner see that
[41:40] gives us this high privilege of praying
[41:44] in Jesus name
[41:46] he's standing there and the Holy Ghost
[41:48] is it he's in us here
[41:50] so we have a privileged in his in his
[41:52] name see and that's why he says that any
[41:56] of all of us who named the name of
[41:58] Christ depart from iniquity how you
[42:00] wanted didn't you know to do his will
[42:02] and don't do it that's iniquity well in
[42:05] our network can you ask anything in his
[42:07] name it's impossible so then he want to
[42:12] give it to you so he tells you through
[42:14] the word his will that's all have
[42:17] something over here I didn't have a
[42:18] chance to write down I got over here
[42:20] the will of God does God change his mind
[42:23] God will give you your desires of your
[42:26] heart our heart now has the word in the
[42:29] heart to seed right excuse me the word
[42:33] in the heart has the perfect will of God
[42:36] my own heart has certain earthly desires
[42:40] natural see now it can be blessed and
[42:44] you can even prosper in these things you
[42:47] see but I would I go to pray I consult
[42:51] the Lord for his will which is in my
[42:54] heart
[42:55] in the word so I'm not worried about the
[42:57] earthly desires in my heart also because
[42:59] there's two in there you know things of
[43:01] this world here that people want and
[43:04] they ask for those things that's not
[43:06] according to his will cuz you don't need
[43:08] those things so therefore he don't give
[43:11] it to you and some he'll even give it to
[43:12] him and bless him in it then ifs I heard
[43:14] from the Lord no you heard from the Lord
[43:16] in you in his permissive will that in
[43:18] his perfect well you're sitting me down
[43:20] so but then that's gonna be a bad for
[43:22] you though okay when you get blessed in
[43:24] those things it's gonna get you puffed
[43:26] up and you're gonna swear that you in
[43:27] God's will and you're not then it's
[43:29] gonna come a day of reckoning you see to
[43:32] me I'm so they're always better to be
[43:33] poor you don't know me now and then
[43:35] answer cording to his will and when he
[43:38] give you somebody knows the coordinate a
[43:39] will of God and he you happy then say
[43:41] praise the Lord say so then if we
[43:44] consult the law for as well he gives me
[43:47] his will but my own desire see wants to
[43:50] do something else
[43:51] then sometimes if you don't catch it see
[43:54] if you're real spiritual you'll know
[43:55] what the will of God is and if you're
[43:56] not see he had to throw up a roadblock
[43:59] sometimes sometime a jackass because
[44:02] like Balaam
[44:03] he said don't go bail him and bail been
[44:05] in bears on Hart he wanted to curse
[44:08] those Jews he didn't like him that was
[44:11] his heart in his heart he was prejudiced
[44:13] and he liked those Jews you finally know
[44:16] Moses them down there those mud dobbers
[44:18] so he himself in his own rot wanted to
[44:22] curse them
[44:23] but God's will was not to curse him so
[44:26] God said don't go but he went anyway
[44:28] and the jack has had to speak to them
[44:30] praise the Lord now we don't the horse
[44:33] but he don't want that he wants you to
[44:35] do his will amen see so here we are now
[44:39] mister Romans 8 27 26 likewise the
[44:44] spirit also helpeth our infirmities for
[44:46] we know not what we should pray for as
[44:49] we ought but the Spirit itself maketh
[44:52] intercession for us with groanings which
[44:54] cannot be uttered and he has searches
[44:56] the heart knoweth what is the mind of
[44:59] the Spirit because he maketh
[45:00] intercession for the Saints according to
[45:04] the will of God and that's what the Holy
[45:07] Spirit does according to the will of God
[45:10] so we see clearly that the Ministry of
[45:11] the comforter consists of his
[45:15] effectuating in us that which Christ is
[45:19] accomplishing on the throne what God
[45:23] Jesus Christ rather standing at the
[45:25] father at the throne what he is asking
[45:28] for you there the Holy Spirit is praying
[45:31] it through you here you understand when
[45:35] you go down in their prayer and you can
[45:36] really get into a real prayer and the
[45:38] Holy Spirit takes you over and if you
[45:41] ever get into which is you know very few
[45:43] can make that I don't know but it comes
[45:45] just the groanings out of you and
[45:47] utterings and so forth you need to
[45:49] understand what is the spirit knows what
[45:51] you need he's the administrator over
[45:55] god's church he knows what the pastor
[45:58] needs what the Deacons need the elders
[46:00] everybody there women the men he know
[46:02] every person needs he's the one who
[46:04] prays he's the one who makes
[46:06] intercession amen and then Jesus Christ
[46:09] stands at the right hand and asked the
[46:11] father for them and he said I know the
[46:13] father always hears me
[46:15] and then his spirit is in you praying
[46:17] for what he's asking for up there how
[46:19] you want to miss him I mean how can you
[46:21] miss it
[46:22] praise the Lord see so now Rome 8:27 is
[46:26] asking according to the will of God the
[46:29] Scriptures clearly show the Spirit is
[46:32] doing something in us which Christ in
[46:34] heaven is doing for us
[46:36] the spirits working through us here and
[46:39] Christ is doing something for us there
[46:42] we got it now now the key note of all
[46:47] true prayer is the will of God and
[46:50] that's the only point I'm trying to
[46:52] drive down tonight is the will of God
[46:55] disciples prayer notice even in that
[46:58] prayer before they were asking his name
[47:00] was thy will be done on earth as is in
[47:03] heaven
[47:04] then Jesus when he prayed in the garden
[47:06] he said not my will but thine be done is
[47:10] that right
[47:11] jesus said I know that always hears me
[47:13] ask accordionist will he hear us us now
[47:16] see it is the spirits deepest work in
[47:19] the believer now watch it to attune his
[47:23] mind to the exalted key like the organ
[47:26] is a certain key it's got to be pitched
[47:28] to and the piano see then you got to get
[47:32] in tune with that key we're in it maketh
[47:34] intercession for the Saints according to
[47:36] the will of God and the key is the will
[47:38] of God and in the spirit working through
[47:41] you and your prayers gets you in tune
[47:44] with the word amen and then it begins to
[47:48] Bible prayer in here and while it's
[47:52] working through you see the effectual
[47:54] prayer of the saints of the earth much
[47:57] amen when it's Bible prayers here you
[48:00] understand and then he's up already
[48:02] asking your father for it
[48:05] praise the Lord like Joshua there he
[48:09] needed some sunlight because the demons
[48:12] were closing in on him and he asks and
[48:15] for he even is in his heart spirit knew
[48:18] what he needed amen and down it called
[48:21] me give him some sunlight son stand
[48:24] still he needed some more time to
[48:25] to kill the enemy he had to see where to
[48:28] head sometimes I'll be here and I'll be
[48:31] stuck sometimes and he'd be moving
[48:33] around and he know what I need and he
[48:35] sends a more powerful anointing to drive
[48:39] out some unbelief amen I got a little
[48:42] lamb that needs to be delivered sitting
[48:44] down over here somewhere
[48:45] powerful spirit moving in the back
[48:47] throne awesome room you know and but
[48:49] this one over here needs to be delivered
[48:50] their point the minister spirits will
[48:53] just sweep in and while the Holy Spirit
[48:56] catches everybody with a sweet anointing
[48:58] the world strikes the little one the
[49:01] little one got his little weird and gone
[49:02] phrase the last way it goes you
[49:05] understand what I mean
[49:06] sure so now Saint Matthew 18:19
[49:10] I'm gonna close out on you now praise
[49:13] the Lord
[49:14] I made it hey men 1819 again I'm saying
[49:21] to you that if two of you shall agree on
[49:24] earth as touching anything that they
[49:26] shall ask it shall be done for them of
[49:29] my father which is in heaven now this is
[49:32] wonderful we hear repeated all the time
[49:35] if any two of us can agree touched any
[49:36] one thing we'll have it that's wonderful
[49:38] see now this word is the same word that
[49:41] we get our word symphony from C and it
[49:44] means that if any two shall accord or
[49:47] symfon eyes in what they ask they have
[49:51] the promise of being heard
[49:53] see same like I was peeking out organ
[49:55] see all the notes must be keyed to the
[49:59] standard pitch else harmony is
[50:02] impassible now you know where I'm going
[50:04] there Amen to stand it pitch to stand it
[50:08] for the hour when you're praying you
[50:11] understand so our prayer is not enough
[50:13] that two disciples agree with each with
[50:17] each other
[50:18] notice now it's not enough that I said
[50:20] we're brother to none unless you and I
[50:22] agree on this one thing here because
[50:24] brother song so it needs a certain thing
[50:25] so that's fine but there's got to be a
[50:27] third party in that that's him
[50:31] here's the key note the will of God now
[50:34] if both 29 will agree we agree and both
[50:37] of us agree together to the will of God
[50:39] amen
[50:40] we had the assurance that we're going to
[50:44] hear from heaven because while we agree
[50:46] in here and as his team is in accord
[50:49] with the third party the will of God the
[50:52] Word of God he's already asked it for us
[50:55] in heaven at the right hand of God we
[50:57] can't lose it
[50:58] amen praise God so they must be both
[51:02] this must be in accord with the third
[51:04] the righteous and the holy Lord
[51:06] therefore before in a scriptural sense
[51:09] they can agree in intercession we must
[51:12] be in symphony I mean because in harmony
[51:16] rather with Jesus Christ and I was
[51:19] speaking about the symphony you to
[51:21] Cynthia you to church the composer's
[51:24] Jesus Christ and the director is the
[51:26] ministers and denominations are trying
[51:29] to make a note hit back in the days of
[51:32] Luther trying to strike a note with the
[51:35] congregation some Baptist minister of
[51:38] Presbyterian something there sitting out
[51:40] there dead the music is dead because
[51:42] it's striking a note from way back
[51:43] somewhere and Guardian doing that now so
[51:46] that's not in tune with the compose that
[51:48] the music sheet don't say that amen
[51:51] here's a director in some great big
[51:54] cemetery talking about the days of
[51:56] miracles is past daddy in the sheet
[51:58] music the by of the sheet music says
[52:01] that these signs shall follow them that
[52:02] believe therefore that director better
[52:05] get in tune with the composer he's way
[52:07] off and he got this the symphony the
[52:09] people have playing to to thwart our
[52:11] making all around or all wrong noises
[52:15] uncertain sounds the old praise God if
[52:18] ever get in tune with the composer
[52:20] they'll make a certain sound Jesus
[52:23] Christ the same yesterday today and
[52:25] forever and when they strike Hebrews
[52:28] 13:8 praise God with E they will get in
[52:31] tune with the original composer and have
[52:33] the original power
[52:35] and when two pieces go together praise
[52:38] God you gonna have her a church like it
[52:40] was on the day of Pentecost amen and
[52:43] faith in what God has done in this hour
[52:46] he's got this symphony the New York
[52:49] Philharmonic symphony of Forest Hills
[52:52] amen
[52:54] he's got us in tune with the composer
[52:56] praise God and give us some directors
[52:59] that know what to talking about they
[53:01] know it's the word of the Lord they got
[53:04] the sheet music lay out in front of them
[53:06] and they even got tapes and books to
[53:09] tell them how to what the sheet music is
[53:11] all about if they can't read it right
[53:12] amen
[53:13] all they are do is stay with the sheet
[53:16] music and we got helps everything else
[53:19] to help us a stay there and when it hits
[53:22] the day of miracles is passing no more
[53:24] passes and no more that's it no more
[53:25] that it hits the wrong no better go back
[53:29] and look at the sheet music again praise
[53:31] God
[53:31] hey man isn't he wonderful then we'll
[53:34] see the original compulsive spirit amen
[53:37] and if we can come in Jesus name asking
[53:42] according to the will of God please
[53:45] Connie we have got to hear from the
[53:48] composer for the composer will sin down
[53:51] his spirit and you'll see those two
[53:53] Chinese tickets go together then we'll
[53:56] hear the same music oh don't you want to
[53:59] hear that rushing mighty wind that music
[54:03] that was played on the day of Pentecost

[54:15] compulsive played any on the day of
[54:18] Pentecost I want to hear the same sound
[54:20] that's why I has a director I'm trying
[54:23] to read the sheet music with eager eyes

[54:54] same spirit as a sheet music if the
[54:58] director is there in goddess of

[55:02] way amen and almost all of the entire
