[0:37] chapter now a certain man was sick named
[0:40] Lazareth of Bethany the town of Mary and
[0:43] her sister Martha it was that Mary which
[0:47] anointed the Lord with ointment and
[0:50] wiped his feet with her hair whose
[0:53] brother Lazareth was sick therefore his
[0:56] sisters sent unto him saying Lord behold
[1:00] he whom thou lovest is sick when Jesus
[1:04] heard that he said this sickness is not
[1:08] unto death but for the glory of God that
[1:11] the Son of God might be glorified
[1:13] thereby now Jesus love Marthur and and
[1:16] her sister and also Lazareth when he had

[1:22] Abode two days still in the same place
[1:25] where he
[1:26] was in St John 5:19
[1:33] then answered Jesus and said unto them
[1:35] verily verily I say unto you the son the
[1:38] son can do nothing of himself but what

[3:50] give a little light Lord and shine upon
[3:52] the people father we ask that th bless
[3:55] Thy word for we ask it in Jesus Christ
[3:58] name and for his glory
[4:00] amen praise the lord well excuse me my
[4:04] voice is a little husky I preached about
[4:06] 2 hours it's so Sunday morning and so
[4:10] but I just because I kept my promise
[4:12] that I was supposed to preach twice and
[4:14] that's all I preached over there and
[4:16] they want to preach more but that's I
[4:18] said I'd preach twice see so now um
[4:21] reading from the scripture here and
[4:23] hearing how so many things are going on
[4:27] many are moving about and a baby's
[4:30] coming forth and everything is happening
[4:32] here well that's wonderful see and the
[4:35] Bible says that there's a time for
[4:37] everything see and there's a time and
[4:41] things uh because that happened that
[4:44] changed the whole course of our lives
[4:47] and and speaking about natural lives
[4:50] here and Solomon speaking back here he
[4:52] says there's a time to be born a time to
[4:55] die a time to plant a time to pluck up
[4:58] that which is planted a time to be
[5:00] sorrowful a time to mourn a time because
[5:03] to be joyful and so forth and and we
[5:06] know now that in this hour now it seems
[5:10] like that we just can't get to the spot
[5:13] where we know actually what is going on
[5:17] and we know that something is going on
[5:20] we know that God has given us these
[5:23] promises we know that God cannot lie
[5:26] that he's going to do what he said he
[5:28] would do amen and but yet see we got to
[5:31] find get in that right Channel and find
[5:34] the time and the season when he's going
[5:36] to do it and then when we can find the
[5:39] time in the season and know exactly his
[5:42] will then we got that Faith amen and
[5:44] then when you can get that nothing can
[5:46] move you from that for you know where
[5:48] you're going amen and so many people now
[5:51] they're being tossed because to and fro
[5:54] and also back and forth for they don't
[5:56] know exactly what is is now transpiring
[6:00] they aren't sure which age are they in
[6:03] so God's Prophet told us make sure of of
[6:07] of the age you're in not to misplace the
[6:09] word don't because dislocate the word
[6:12] see make sure that you know the promise
[6:15] of your season and just take a note in
[6:17] the Bible here checking through the
[6:19] seven Church ages because I I have noted
[6:22] that is only in the seventh age that uh
[6:26] uh because these eyes are are to be
[6:28] anointed M just in that age of because
[6:31] all and then I say that if the seventh
[6:34] age if there was to be a predestinate
[6:37] ordained people for their eyes to be
[6:39] anointed to see then God for that age
[6:42] must have light for that age amen and I
[6:45] finding in the scripture that it dob
[6:47] tals that God said in the evening time
[6:49] that there would be light and in the
[6:51] seventh age that there would be eyes to
[6:54] see the light amen and we find that it
[6:56] dob Tails because right together and so
[6:59] therefore um there's a time and and
[7:02] because spiritual things because with
[7:04] God and there's a a time and also a
[7:07] season that God had for us to be born
[7:09] again and then excuse me um when
[7:13] spiritual things happen to his people he
[7:16] has a time and a place for them to
[7:19] happen and just like Israel's our type
[7:21] we know that God has ordered our steps
[7:24] here in the evening time he's ordered
[7:27] each step that we are going to take
[7:29] that's but we must find out let the
[7:32] light shine on the step so we know where
[7:35] we are going because as we stand here
[7:37] tonight we look into this Unseen World
[7:40] out here the spiritual world we can't
[7:42] see with these eyes into it see and it's
[7:45] because Dangerous Waters out there so
[7:47] therefore there's because two forces out
[7:50] there Satan and also God but if we are
[7:53] his people then we can step forward and
[7:57] look into this unseen see and here's
[7:59] where the faith comes in at amen
[8:02] something in you see you mean that it
[8:04] cannot be impersonated something in you
[8:06] tells you to take the step take it don't
[8:09] be afraid of it should I or shouldn't do
[8:12] it no something must tell you to take
[8:14] that step and I keep standing there and
[8:16] figuring one and may or make mistake so
[8:18] you make a mistake but all things work
[8:22] together so what you make a mistake see
[8:24] but therefore when you start to halt in
[8:27] between because of because two of
[8:29] because to opinion then Satan he
[8:31] confuses your mind see man now so so
[8:34] therefore to me God has given us the
[8:38] authority in Christ he has the power is
[8:42] that right then if we have his authority
[8:45] to walk and he give us light and anoint
[8:48] our eyes to see then walk amen is that
[8:52] right friends and then then when you
[8:54] take that step you just step out into
[8:57] the Unseen amen but when you your foot
[8:59] gets there by faith he sends the power
[9:03] amen he sends the power and you get out
[9:05] there in the Unseen you can't see out
[9:07] there but he can in you yes for he has
[9:09] anointed your inner man inside to see
[9:13] all around he's got a SW out in this
[9:16] Unseen World out is that right it's the
[9:18] word of God and then you speak it out
[9:20] there is that right friends and Satan
[9:22] must move amen praise our God because
[9:27] Israel there was a time and Al a purpose
[9:30] because for Israel there was a time for
[9:33] them to be down in Egypt is that right
[9:35] God had them down there and they were
[9:37] because crying out to God then there was
[9:39] a time when he should send forth a a
[9:42] prophet with a pill of fire to bring him
[9:44] into the Wilderness and there there was
[9:46] the church and then it was a time that
[9:49] they should come into this Promised Land
[9:52] into their heritance but Joshua had to
[9:55] wait for the time and the season to move
[9:58] amen see because God said I have given
[10:00] you the land but when the time and the
[10:03] season see you must meditate day and
[10:06] night in the word right and even now in
[10:09] this hour if you're reading your the
[10:11] newspapers and magazines the latest
[10:14] Spirit going around is to meditation
[10:17] thinking trying to contact that one
[10:19] source yes they're trying every way
[10:23] because these hippies cuz they were the
[10:25] shock troopers now they have because of
[10:28] because of abandoned that now now it is
[10:31] meditation by this Indian over here
[10:33] therefore what are they doing they are
[10:35] impersonating what we are supposed to be
[10:37] doing we are we have this God at there
[10:41] seeking we have him inside but all he's
[10:45] trying to do is to get a people that
[10:46] will sit still s down in into their
[10:50] prayer closet and let him talk to them
[10:52] yes and then when they are finished
[10:55] meditating on the Lord he tells them
[10:57] what to do and they stay on the word
[10:59] read the word and so forth and then walk
[11:01] out with faith for they have been in his
[11:03] presence these people in because right
[11:06] in the natural say that when they finish
[11:08] meditating they feel better and they do
[11:10] things better well then what about us if
[11:13] we have the word of God God in the end
[11:15] time with a message to tell us what to
[11:16] do and why are we always worrying and
[11:19] falling down we have a god telling us
[11:21] what to do and the word of God and they
[11:23] don't even go by the word of God Amen
[11:26] see so therefore for Footprints is
[11:30] possession amen you must take that step
[11:33] you cannot Halt and think because
[11:35] because shall I take it but take it and
[11:38] when you take it then you possess it so
[11:41] The Souls of your feet must stand there
[11:43] in that promised word land there and
[11:45] possess it amen praise God so we have
[11:49] this Authority but he has the power and
[11:52] Christ must send the power but we must
[11:55] step out on faith and believe what we
[11:57] are talking about so now we see in
[12:00] friends in this last hour now as far as
[12:03] we can move by faith see that much we
[12:07] have now possessed so now we here up
[12:10] here we cuz here in New York we're just
[12:13] moving by the spirit we are waiting and
[12:16] we are watching each day to see what is
[12:18] going on and this we know that every
[12:22] demon power must move aside if we walk
[12:26] in the word for that's where he told is
[12:29] to go at then if anybody is there
[12:31] brocking they must move aside for he
[12:32] told you to go there amen praise God
[12:36] praise the Lord so now God he himself he
[12:39] is in charge now we must know God's
[12:42] season and God's time to move cuz even
[12:46] right now in our lives right now many
[12:47] are moving about and so forth as God
[12:49] season it's his time for you to move
[12:51] around he is moving you himself he knows
[12:54] what is down the road what's going to
[12:56] happen so therefore he just moves you
[12:58] out and always so simple praise God so
[13:02] now we must understand God's will in
[13:05] this hour now just like brother br's
[13:08] Ministry speaking about it tonight just
[13:11] wanted to because be short tonight and
[13:13] drive something home to you see now
[13:16] speaking about his ministry I was over
[13:17] in because Jamaica there and got a
[13:19] chance to to just sit down and also
[13:22] listen and because to some old tapes and
[13:25] so forth and then I picked up a old tape
[13:27] and it's astounding here and this is a
[13:30] quote those Visions you see at the the
[13:33] platform are merely they are really they
[13:37] are Visions but not the real
[13:40] Visions they are that's you doing that
[13:44] that's not me it's you you are doing it
[13:46] yourself you are not conscious but you
[13:49] are doing you can't explain God so I
[13:52] thought about that there the Visions at
[13:54] the platform because they aren't the
[13:56] real ones you see and then he began to
[13:58] speak about the gift of God excuse me
[14:02] which is because of Jesus Christ and
[14:04] then he began explaining because that
[14:06] all because a as all of us know that God
[14:11] the Father uses his gift and he allows
[14:14] us to use the gift is that right and all
[14:17] of us wondered about that what was he
[14:19] talking about for over Hebrews 6:4 it is
[14:22] impossible for those who were once
[14:24] enlightened and have tasted of this
[14:27] heavenly gift one gift see and we're
[14:30] made partakers of the Holy Ghost so then
[14:34] begin to because just thinking on that
[14:37] and how God operates well in this very
[14:41] hour right now all of us are waiting for
[14:43] this promise to be made manifest many
[14:46] are wondering what is the promise what's
[14:48] going to happen here if we should
[14:50] because move from here where will I go
[14:52] and so forth see that hasn't got one
[14:55] thing to do with it God is only trying
[14:58] to get a people in contact with him to
[15:01] meditate on because on him the word he
[15:04] will move you about himself am not in
[15:07] this because of because a physical place
[15:10] here but where he wants to move you
[15:12] himself see so now just thinking over
[15:15] here in St John the the 11th chapter
[15:18] here Lazarus he was
[15:20] sick and just before Lazar took
[15:25] sick God took Jesus Christ off to the
[15:29] side and showed him that Lazarus had to
[15:33] die see now he saw that already then in
[15:36] St John 11 here when he was there with
[15:39] his because disciples and had gone past
[15:42] uh because according to St John 10:40 it
[15:45] says he had gone past the River Jordan
[15:48] where John had baptized first and there
[15:50] they were Abiding and then a messenger
[15:52] comes and tells him that Lazar because
[15:55] he was sick so from because these
[15:58] experts say it's about 18 miles or so
[16:00] from where he was at over to Jerusalem
[16:02] and also Bethany so
[16:04] therefore that would just about take a
[16:06] whole Day's Journey because walking and
[16:08] so forth that's one day when the
[16:10] messenger cuz when he got there and told
[16:13] Christ that lar was sick now Jesus
[16:16] Christ had been in God's presence
[16:19] meditating see and the Lord had showed
[16:22] him what he wanted him to do amen and
[16:25] what was supposed to come to pass amen
[16:28] so he knew where he was going and what
[16:31] he had to do so when the messenger come
[16:33] that because Lazar was sick Jesus Christ
[16:37] in himself because he could have healed
[16:39] him that's right but the father had
[16:41] already told me he had to die so he just
[16:44] ignored them that's right you follow me
[16:46] now and a lot of times when we try to
[16:48] contact God we don't get no answer but
[16:50] God already knows what he wants to do in
[16:53] your situation that's right is that
[16:55] right am so he just ignored him and the
[16:57] messenger because went on back and I
[17:00] don't know whether Jesus Christ told him
[17:02] this here in in in the fourth verse but
[17:05] Jesus heard that he said this sickness
[17:07] is not unto death but for of of of the
[17:11] glory of God that the Son of God might
[17:13] be glorified thereby now this messenger
[17:15] could have taken this message back to
[17:17] Mary and Martha I don't know see now but
[17:20] but that's what he said see so therefore
[17:23] the message because went on back and
[17:25] therefore Lazareth was sick and Christ
[17:28] could have healed him see but the father
[17:31] said that he had to die and by his death
[17:35] he would glorify God and all of us know
[17:37] also that when brother Brandon was
[17:39] killed in his car was found the same
[17:41] scripture is that right the sickness is
[17:44] not unto because corruption death see
[17:46] because he's not dead but sleeping
[17:48] that's right see now but God was going
[17:50] to raise up Lazarus for a greater glory
[17:54] amen if he had healed him because that
[17:56] was one Glory but how much more Glory
[17:59] was it for him to because resurrect him
[18:02] from the dead amen you see now you got
[18:05] to understand the way God works that's
[18:07] right so this little short message
[18:09] tonight is to get us in this season and
[18:13] in this time for what is getting ready
[18:16] to take place which I believe in my
[18:18] heart something is fixing to happen but
[18:22] we ourselves must change our way of
[18:25] thinking see me now and come in tune
[18:27] with the word
[18:29] that's why we ought to read the word and
[18:30] meditate on the word amen then we see
[18:33] here that because the average person
[18:35] would say well why did he go heal him
[18:37] but the father had already told him that
[18:39] he had to die amen we just trying to
[18:42] drive home the point now see so
[18:45] therefore uh he knew what was going to
[18:48] happen so therefore then the son of man
[18:51] he had to be glorified by his death so
[18:54] now then God had showed him that he was
[18:57] going to die now notice because he Abode
[19:00] there two days see now he was not
[19:04] neglecting his love but waiting for the
[19:07] right time and season to demonstrate
[19:10] greater love and more power amen so when
[19:14] we seek the Lord he is not because
[19:17] neglecting you he's waiting for what he
[19:19] has ordained for you to happen and when
[19:21] it happens then you'll see it more
[19:23] perfectly amen praise God so therefore
[19:28] he could have healed brother brandham if
[19:30] he wanted to amen are you follow me
[19:32] friends that's right you see I mean now
[19:35] but uh is a greater glory for his
[19:38] Prophet to come forth in the
[19:41] resurrection amen as a sign a signal to
[19:45] the bride that the res the Rapture is at
[19:48] hand it's a greater glory for God in the
[19:51] resurrection for him to do that amen so
[19:54] we should never question what is God
[19:56] doing but get the mind of God to see
[19:59] what how God works and he's the same
[20:01] yesterday today and forever he changes
[20:04] not so whenever we get in a little
[20:05] trials and so forth and get all because
[20:08] worked up and everything he know what
[20:10] he's doing he's on the way he here
[20:12] two days then he had to walk over there
[20:15] because four days the messenger come one
[20:18] day he stayed there because because two
[20:20] extra days then he had to go over there
[20:22] it was 4 days is that right but he was
[20:24] on the way is that right when Martha she
[20:28] says Lord even now God is able to do
[20:32] what he wants to do amen cuz one time it
[20:35] took because Daniel when because because
[20:38] when he had prayed to the Lord that
[20:39] right took the angel of the Lord 21 days
[20:42] to get there the king all right the the
[20:45] prin of Persia had because detained him
[20:48] but it took him 21 days to get there but
[20:51] in the meantime he was seeking God God
[20:55] was working his will through him amen
[20:58] amen so therefore even if you're sick
[21:01] because get prayed for believe it one
[21:03] day soon he'll pass through your
[21:05] neighborhood and heal you that's all
[21:08] amen the word has been spoken amen so
[21:11] therefore he sent the word is not unto
[21:14] death and he passed by 4 days later and
[21:18] therefore the word spoke raised not un
[21:20] death and he come by and raised Lazarus
[21:22] from the dead amen see praise God so
[21:26] therefore now we see then that
[21:28] if we can get the mind of God see
[21:30] there's a purpose a time a season for
[21:34] every move we make and God is trying to
[21:36] get us to see that there's a purpose in
[21:39] a time what God is doing right now he is
[21:42] wening his bride right now for the life
[21:46] that passed through the blade and
[21:48] detasseling the shark passed through
[21:50] there has come out out in the open to

[24:11] himen behold is there anything any one
[24:15] little thing too hard for me any big
[24:18] thing too hard for me I'm the God of All
[24:21] Flesh amen he's only trying to get a
[24:24] people to believe that God is going to
[24:27] move with him people in the season in
[24:29] the time but he can only get that
[24:31] elected group who will believe that and
[24:34] hang out there and make footprints in
[24:37] the word of God and possess this
[24:39] inheritance he's looking for that
[24:41] friends and he's going to find them he's
[24:43] got them now being prepared and ripen
[24:46] and ready for the hour when he sends
[24:48] down the water upon him make sure of the

[24:55] soon amen he's on his way he's on his he
[24:59] is descending he's coming down right now
[25:01] but he sends down a shout first amen
[25:04] then a voice then a trumpet amen he's on
[25:08] his way down friends yes sir so
[25:10] therefore hold to that Jesus because he
[25:13] AB boed there too he knew what he was
[25:14] doing and they was all excited and
[25:16] everything but he knew exactly what he
[25:18] was doing the father told him he wanted
[25:20] to make sure he was dead because 4 days
[25:24] and he want to show the glory of God
[25:26] Amen when he said that this sickness is
[25:28] not unto death that's when they should
[25:30] have sought the Lord right there what
[25:31] did he mean by that you follow me now
[25:34] and he would answer them we got believe
[25:36] amen see so therefore now we see uh this
[25:41] call come for help and if a call ever
[25:43] comes to him because for help he will
[25:46] answer that call he can be touched by
[25:49] the feeling of infirmities amen all
[25:53] right now so therefore we see then uh
[25:57] turn to St John because of 11 please we
[26:00] want to show you something here
[26:02] tonight and and then when you can see
[26:04] God season and God's time it gives you
[26:06] much more faith to know what God is
[26:09] doing amen see so
[26:12] therefore now he got to Mary Martha and
[26:15] and I wouldn't try to because preach
[26:17] through there for he has already
[26:18] preached because because Believers out
[26:20] this amen he has preached that already
[26:23] see so I'll come over here to because
[26:24] verse
[26:25] 41 and so now we see over here now
[26:29] speaking about cuz Jesus Christ when he
[26:31] came up to the uh the the grave here
[26:34] then he told them to take away the stone
[26:37] first we must do something first move
[26:41] back all the clouds of unbelief and
[26:44] watch the sunshine shine out it cuz the
[26:46] sunshine is there but press back all the
[26:49] clouds he's been there all the time he
[26:50] doesn't change that right he's right
[26:52] there all the time see amen then they
[26:54] took away the Stone from the place where
[26:57] the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up
[27:00] his eyes and said father I thank thee
[27:03] that thou has heard me and I knew that
[27:05] thou hearest me
[27:07] always but because of the people which
[27:10] stand by I said it that they may believe
[27:13] that thou Hast sent me see
[27:16] now if you notice here he prayed for an
[27:22] example cuz he said here that I say it
[27:25] for these that stand by
[27:28] is that right see so therefore when he
[27:32] had prayed here and also called because
[27:35] called forth because Lazar because from
[27:37] deg grave here he did not get weak that
[27:41] right but yet when a woman with this
[27:44] because a blood issue touched him
[27:47] because him of His Garment he said
[27:49] virtue has left me so now something's
[27:51] wrong somewhere that right but brother
[27:53] Bram told us that it would a time would
[27:56] come in because his ministry that he
[27:59] would not get weak is that right so
[28:02] therefore the time would come when he'd
[28:05] pray and he wouldn't get weak so now we
[28:08] see here as we watch because Jesus
[28:10] Christ Ministry here
[28:12] now when God showed Christ that Lazarus
[28:18] because was going to die that was God
[28:21] using the
[28:23] gift there's no weakness there you see
[28:27] he saw it and then he just because he
[28:29] knew exactly what was going to happen he
[28:32] just went ahead to the spot and acted
[28:34] out the drama now I'm laying this for a
[28:37] purpose so you'll see the ministry of
[28:39] the Bride coming up See it'll be just
[28:42] the same way amen praise our god it
[28:46] won't it won't change for he's the same
[28:49] yesterday today and forever but if we
[28:51] can find it in the word then we know
[28:53] where it's at amen see so therefore he
[28:57] God showed him God used the gift by
[29:01] vision for St John 5:19 says verily
[29:06] verily I say unto
[29:08] thee the son can do nothing of himself
[29:12] see it mean now but what he seeth by
[29:16] Vision what he seeth the father do is
[29:20] that right so he saw the father call
[29:23] Lazarus from the grave because using him
[29:27] he saw that in a vision that did not
[29:29] make him weak at
[29:31] all but if somebody would touch him from
[29:34] out in the audience virtue would leave
[29:36] him cuz you are pulling on the gift
[29:40] that's right from the other end of it
[29:42] amen see okay now brother Bram gave a
[29:47] wonderful example on the old tape he
[29:49] said it's like um two people at a circus
[29:53] one is is a little short fellow and with
[29:57] because little short legs and another
[29:59] one is like a tall fellow and there's a
[30:01] wall because by the circus and in the
[30:03] walls a hole the tall fell is God's
[30:07] prophet and the little fell is all the
[30:10] people so the tall fell he hops up and
[30:13] can look through the hole the little
[30:15] fell say what do you see he said I see
[30:17] an elephant then his arms is tiring so
[30:20] therefore he has to because come down he
[30:23] goes up again he gets tired I see a
[30:26] because a j
[30:28] and so forth and because so on that's
[30:30] you pulling on the vision but each time
[30:34] he goes up to see it makes him tired and
[30:37] virtue goes out of him are you foll me
[30:40] now okay that goes on and on till he
[30:42] gets just war and they have to because
[30:44] carry them out but the ring Master comes
[30:48] along and picks up this little fell like
[30:51] this and shows him the whole
[30:54] thing does this little fell get tired
[30:56] never he's sees everything and he's in
[30:59] the ring Mass his arms well that's God
[31:02] using the gift amen amen praise be to
[31:06] our
[31:07] God is that simple the ring Master who's
[31:11] in charge picks up the little fell us
[31:14] the people and shows them all things
[31:18] that's just what he meant God using the
[31:20] gift amen see now so therefore the woman
[31:23] with the because because blood issue she
[31:27] on him and virtue went out but when God
[31:29] showed him anything virtue never went
[31:31] out it was just a natural thing and
[31:34] brother BR says someday it will come to
[31:36] that see amen okay now praise the Lord
[31:41] so now that's God using his own gift so
[31:44] now brother Bram third pull if you
[31:47] remember in in that tent
[31:50] Vision uh that we all that everybody's
[31:53] all talking about um excuse me this is
[31:56] just part of it here it says this this
[31:59] Angel of the Lord spoke to him said this
[32:01] will not be a public show mhm is it not
[32:04] written in the
[32:06] scripture of our Lord's words when thou
[32:10] prayest enter into thy closet and when
[32:12] thou has shut thy door pray to thy
[32:16] father which is in secret and thy father
[32:19] which seeth in secret shall reward thee
[32:23] openly be not like the Hypocrites that
[32:27] make their public show of
[32:30] things but go into thy into your secret
[32:33] closet well Jesus Christ is the same
[32:37] yesterday today and forever then if
[32:41] Christ standing there St John 5:19 that
[32:45] he would do nothing except he would show
[32:48] Jesus Christ first amen he cannot do it
[32:52] of himself but the father doeth all
[32:54] things well then the same Christ was in
[32:57] William Brandon could he change that no
[33:00] he could not do except the father would
[33:02] show him first where at in the closet so
[33:05] he said in his third pull that he
[33:07] wouldn't get tired no more he said I'm
[33:09] sure you call it with because Collins
[33:12] boy also because lukim and so forth amen
[33:15] right he called me on the phone to pray
[33:18] for sister Lawson yes and then he prayed
[33:21] and then all this time we always
[33:22] wondering when he going to speak the
[33:24] word like th sayth the Lord see but he
[33:27] prayed so did he pray here in St John 11
[33:31] is that right father thou H has heard me
[33:35] already we in secret in the closet but
[33:38] I'm only praying with because of brother
[33:40] Coleman here so he might believe that
[33:43] you sent me yeah are you following me
[33:45] friends are you following me now so he
[33:48] slipped out in a STD pool he prayed for
[33:50] the people as an example he have to do
[33:53] that the father had already showed him
[33:55] already in the secret closet what he
[33:57] going to do out in the open he just
[33:59] walked out in the open he could have
[34:00] said come forth whatever it was but he
[34:02] prayed heavenly father as we stand so
[34:04] humble and simple he prayed spoke the
[34:06] word and went pass right through us and
[34:08] everybody stood waiting for him to
[34:10] because come out with a public show and
[34:12] thus and so and so forth and so on when
[34:14] he has already done in the secret walked
[34:16] out as an example he prayed didn't have
[34:19] to do it right but for thou has already
[34:22] heard me in secret amen for he do
[34:26] nothing except help the father show him
[34:28] so that therefore if Christ had come in
[34:30] a shout you follow me now he couldn't do
[34:34] nothing in the third pull except the
[34:37] father had showed him already in secret
[34:39] amen amen well praise be to our God so
[34:43] therefore could can Christ change his
[34:46] pattern he cannot change his pattern
[34:49] amen so now friends then um um in the
[34:53] spoken word book it just come today and
[34:56] this just made me feel so good and uh I
[35:00] thought I would just read a portion of

[36:27] himself she fell see that's what the
[36:30] bride was giving uh to produce himself
[36:33] again another Son of God but she fell by
[36:35] high breeding SC produced himself but
[36:38] she fell caused him to Die the Second
[36:41] Son of spoken seed word of God was given
[36:44] a bride like Adam but before he could
[36:46] marry her she had fallen also for she
[36:49] was put to a free moral agency like
[36:52] Adam's wife was to believe God's word

[50:50] he don't want your mind the mind of
[50:52] Christ amen just the mind of Jesus J
[50:57] Christ they do only his will amen
[51:00] because I believe that no one can
[51:02] persuade them different they have thus
[51:04] saith the Lord or they keep
[51:07] still because because so just prove it
[51:09] to you then they will do the works of
[51:11] God for it is himself in them watch this
[51:16] now continuing his word to fulfill as he
[51:20] did because complete in his days all
[51:23] things when he was here he did not
[51:26] complete all when he was here for it was
[51:29] not time yet second coming now let us
[51:33] stand like Joshua and Caleb now watch
[51:35] close this is going to have a spiritual
[51:37] background now let us stand like Joshua
[51:40] and Caleb as we see the the promised
[51:42] land coming in sight it's nearing the
[51:44] time to be given Joshua in Hebrew means
[51:47] Savior and represents the promis end
[51:49] time leader to take the the church over
[51:53] which was William brandom mhm with
[51:55] because of the shout message but many
[51:58] men today think they are Joshua when
[52:00] Joshua the Le has already taken us over
[52:03] we're sitting in the promised word
[52:06] waiting for the captain of the host to
[52:08] come down and they think I'm Joshua and
[52:11] I'm so so you ain't nothing now for the
[52:14] prophet has already taken us over
[52:16] already for God gave him the Joshua
[52:19] commission and they don't even know it
[52:21] see praise our God Caleb represents the
[52:25] True Believer who stayed with Joshua
[52:28] stay with the word amen God started
[52:32] Israel as a virgin with his word but
[52:33] they wanted something different so did
[52:36] the last day church and so do they right
[52:38] now he started us all in 63 with the
[52:41] word is that right 65 he went off the
[52:44] scene 66 up this that this thing go over
[52:47] there this and that see but those True
[52:49] Believers of that word that stays with
[52:52] it because trials persecutions despair
[52:55] knocked down dragged out that's all
[52:57] right stay with it Just Keep On
[52:59] Believing the word of God stay with it
[53:02] see to me now for he's going to come to
[53:04] the word this one thing we know the Holy
[53:08] Spirit which is the word can only come
[53:10] to the word nothing else so he can't
[53:13] come to men's ideas of what they think
[53:16] the word is amen it'll be it's thus
[53:18] sayth the word that's all it is amen so
[53:23] cuz notice how God did not move Israel
[53:25] until his own appointed time now listen
[53:27] this is this is going to mean something
[53:29] Joshua waited for that time oh how no
[53:33] matter how much people might have said
[53:35] God gave us a land because of the
[53:36] promise Let's us go now and take it they
[53:38] might have said Joshua CU you lost your
[53:40] commission because y all washed up why
[53:42] are you not doing something amen do
[53:45] something do what I'm waiting on the
[53:48] Lord Brother Brandon waited 5 years amen
[53:52] five years he prayed he cried he felt
[53:55] convicted it was only God drawing him
[53:57] closer when you feel all funny and feel
[54:00] like you did something wrong or took
[54:02] candy because I'm a baby or something
[54:04] it's God pulling you closer and closer
[54:07] and closer you feel wrong he wants you
[54:10] to feel that way so you can get closer
[54:12] and closer he's drawing you into prayer
[54:14] into because intercession with him
[54:17] that's how he draws you in so therefore
[54:20] an enemy say something wrong with you no
[54:22] it's God wooing you drawing you in yes
[54:25] amen he only wants you to contact him
[54:28] that's all he's doing see man
[54:31] now because you lost your commission you
[54:33] all watched up You Used To Know thus
[54:36] said the Lord in a moment and what was
[54:37] the will of God but this wise godsent
[54:40] Prophet knew the promise of God but also
[54:43] knew to wait for that promise a clearcut
[54:48] decision from God for his time nothing
[54:51] can be more clear-cut than a power
[54:53] Vision break before you you'll know
[54:55] friends how will I you know cuz it'll
[54:58] have to be according to St John 5:19
[55:00] he'll you'll do nothing except he show
[55:02] you that's right they can run up and
[55:04] down now but unless God show they won't
[55:06] do nothing amen so we'll just wait on
[55:09] the Lord praise
[55:11] God for his time these Parables now
[55:14] watch and when the time come God gave it
[55:17] to Joshua who had stayed with him by the
[55:20] word for he could not trust others he
[55:23] could trust him so will it
[55:26] repeat now don't ever forget that now
[55:28] friends and so much for that because
[55:31] here tonight so therefore God could
[55:33] trust William Brandon with the word he
[55:36] gave him 30 years with that word and he
[55:38] held to it no matter what happened his
[55:40] wife because children died this happened
[55:43] that happened but he stayed with the
[55:44] word we've only had to do this since' 63
[55:47] MH that right that's right staying with
[55:49] the word our only test was that he give
[55:52] us the word and 66 false Christ would
[55:55] arise in in the message sweet humble
[55:58] brothers who we know had fellowship with
[56:00] ate with slept with but they come up not
[56:03] ordained to be in The Bride come up with
[56:05] a false teaching now now watch this
[56:09] Satan see God doesn't have to because to
[56:12] beautify his word he keeps it plain and
[56:15] simple but Satan when the thing sounds
[56:18] good that ain't God cuz God just is
[56:21] playing with God see me now it's a
[56:23] simple promise soul Temple is hid but
[56:26] Satan makes it sound exciting amen uh
[56:30] this is going to happen over there
[56:32] Hallelujah glory to God he must do that
[56:34] to because because because of track
[56:36] certain people and they say well glory
[56:38] to God that's what he going to do see
[56:40] but God just keeps his word plain and
[56:42] simple so therefore those who are now
[56:45] right now staying with the word just
[56:48] staying right with that word see he then
[56:50] allows false Christ and all these things
[56:53] to come to sh shake you off of the word
[56:56] yeah other words heresies must come to
[57:00] pass to because those because which you
[57:02] are approved might be made manifest that
[57:04] right so therefore these things must be
[57:06] to see who is approved of God and then
[57:10] they are made manifest then there is
[57:12] faith in the word and that hour made
[57:16] manifest that right Jesus Christ was the
[57:20] because Abraham seed that right well
[57:22] Abraham seed Christ because he parted
[57:25] himself down Through the Ages because
[57:27] justification sanctification because the
[57:29] gifts and now the message that right
[57:32] well the message right now is the faith
[57:34] seed that's right that's all it is the
[57:36] faith seed right now you are the faith
[57:38] seed right now this is the message of
[57:40] the hour and therefore Christ will come
[57:42] right because right to that amen can we
[57:46] say Amen do we have understanding so
[57:49] what is going on right now is a time and
[57:51] a season and a purpose for what is going
[57:54] on now some of us because because we're
[57:57] moving here there this is going on there
[57:58] a time and also a purpose of God for
[58:01] that and everything that's happened to
[58:03] you right now is God's purpose he he is
[58:06] moving his people around and put them
[58:08] over here and so forth and so on he's
[58:09] doing it himself friend so therefore let
[58:12] us understand God and also understand
[58:16] what the Lord has ino for us and I
[58:18] myself believe cuz it's late already I
[58:21] myself believe that the the we right at
[58:25] the glory of God we're going to see it
