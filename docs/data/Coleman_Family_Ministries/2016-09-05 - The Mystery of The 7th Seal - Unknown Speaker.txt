seen how they are responding to the gospel while brother Valia and sister Raina David are testifying to them this is a parallel with what you told me a couple of years ago quote brother Val they are seed of God and we will claim them and I believe this is the season of harvest for the kingdom of God also please pray for brother B and his family and brother Wanita and family and uh sister tari fell in the bathtub full of water just by the by God's grace she was able to pull herself up we really have to keep praying for her and um I believe that is all let us go to the the throne of grace this morning our gracious Lord as we approach the throne of grace we're conscious that we are standing in the presence of God we are conscious dear God that thou has B us to come to make our requests known unto thee and Lord thou knowest the request which has been spoken out so now Heavenly Father May the blood of Jesus Christ sprinkle us from an evil conscience and all sin and transgressions God

how the enemy trapped them in the world and Lord uh seeing brother Valia who's who was bound by the enemy and then seeing him set free and seeing David and also rain are going back and giving their testimonies and setting those people on fire and then seeing that fire going from brother and sister David and uh ruie dear God and then going to brother Valia and brother wanito and then they in turn coming back to see lloy and common and setting them on fire so Heavenly Father we know something is already activated so Lord God we ask you now to to continue to stir up their hearts Lord and bring them to a full conviction of the hour and God May their eyes be anointed and come open and and may the world be washed off heavenly father in the knowledge that you saved them and you're coming down

come down come down down in a special way and confirm your word God we pray heavenly father and we ask it in Jesus name and his sake amen you may be seated so quite a few requests all the time when we come in I don't know we're going to have to do something soon to cut it off because it just takes up too much time and we're going to have to just lay it up here and pray on them cuz you know what they are and cuz it takes about so much time to do it and uh cuz you want to just strike those things that the spirit of God I pray will give you inspiration to know just what to write and what to praise for we got to come to a time when we praise for certain things you see not the little things or well that's wonderful we can we thank the Lord for that and the little and the great but coming up here uh we trust that we'll come to a maturity where we can just lay it here and you know what it is you know what I mean and not each one have to hear it to be satisfied you know so cuz we want to get right to the word of the Lord so uh there's a praise here just a well actually was I was looking for this was a prayer and had Praise on the top I thank the Lord for all he's done for me and all that he's uh all that he's about to do please pray that God would touch my sister Avon I think what it is who has to take an operation for ad noise a second time pray that God touches her before the doctor's knife does and this sister Leon let us bow ah head in a word of prayer our heavenly father we was trying to remember where this was at and here is buried here with a praise so dear God thou

hospital in color with the same thing he's bleeding from the kidneys and is in very serious condition because of a clotting factor in the blood upon test they have found that her one daughter has the

be healed we pray God and we ask this in Jesus name and his sake amen well praise God every one of these mean something now you understand what I'm saying is nothing nothing wrong with sending them up here no see but we just got to come to a point where we can just lay them here you can still bring them up see but we're not going to read them out like that anymore unless you have it into the song leader at least 5 minutes before but anything that because comes after brother Hunter myself or we just laid here see I hope he understand cuz we can't go through this here it takes uh it takes your mind away from from what you right when you come out that room there you got your mind on the word and then you're looking for a prayer request cuz I just walked in it was about several papers here I'm trying to get them all lined out because in a hurry so cuz we up in the word amen so I I know you understand see God knows these things and just a matter of making it known and you bring it up here is made known he knows it and so we just lay our hands up all of them at one time and ask God to take care of so I hope nobody we would be mature to understand that it wouldn't be slighting any one person so we thank the Lord to be here this morning after the wonderful outpouring that we had Wednesday night amen and so um we're looking for more of the same I am and um I have a message this morning well it might be a little lengthy uh because um I feel that maybe this message would cap off this morning all that I have tried to preach down through the years and bring it to a point to where that's it you know and so maybe uh a little over hour I trust because that all that will all that that's the length of the time it will be I I'm wanting to say now uh I ask you to read as a scripture lesson the uh Christ is the mystery of God reveal and I'm going to quote from here because you understand as I'm doing it why I'm doing this here there's a secret laziness here and when I read it to you you'll understand why so then if there's a secret laying here and all of you are straining and pulling to uh uh know what it is well then if you will make it easier for me when I read it that I don't feel a tenseness you know then I can I start stammering and studing I can feel that uh what's he trying to say what's what's he trying to get at but if we mature and sit back I told Brother uh the little brother Craig I told him he'd come in he'd strained and strained and strain now he's just sitting back relaxing he got the secret last week he sat back he was straining and straining and he told me he's testifying about it he sat back he relaxed boom he was hit right in the head you ask him about it if each one of you who are straining and all twisted up if you could just sit back in your seats amen and just sit back and you're going to get it now I realize that my praise the lord we had a wonderful time Wednesday didn't we amen you know why you was relaxed so you relaxed this morning that's it I was talking to one person in particular and the person finally sat back and relaxed they was up on toping like that see and and so I know what I'm talking about see you got it wonderful just and I was talking to this person just the other day day and telling that particular person to relax cuz you're going to get it cuz your mind go out and try to know what I'm going to say before I even say it and I don't know what I'm going to say cuz I preach by inspiration so how can I tell you how can you figure out what I'm going to say if I'm waiting for him to reveal it to me in the Pulpit so when you get ahead you miss it amen praise God now we relaxing now we we all tensed up in here praise God so now um sister naen would you come please we have have a dedication now we'll start the service wonderful Jesus amen so now um we have a um brother Garcia and sister Garcia are going back to Puerto Rico and I mention it Wednesday and to those of you who that were not here Wednesday they are to leave and they feel they feel inspired of God to go back to Pastor the little flock down in Guama we want to pray for them brother Hunt and I cu the elders will pray for brother Garcia after and so therefore let us pray for them as they go out into the season of harvest that the that God would Grant him the the powers of the Holy Spirit to sew and reap in this year amen so now uh we have a dedication here I understand sister lyia Bermudas uh her um I don't girl or boy here bring them in I found what I was looking for a couple of Praises here and I got to had it all mixed up with something else cuz I didn't want to miss this and I know because uh because the enemy wanted me to miss it took it completely out of of my mind but uh it's a wonderful praise that's why I say now bring your Praises in there certain ones that God once read so I'm not tell you not to do it now see here's one here sister MC Murray several weeks ago I asked the church to pray for a girl named Mana Walsh who had a nervous breakdown due to parents pressure for education I heard on Friday she's pulling out of this uh depression and opening up for the first time praise be to our God for his love and compassion please continue to pray for her soul sister McMurray now here's the one I wanted to our brother Gonzaga from Ecuador and brother uh West saan had testify to him on his job about God and this message here in the end time what God is doing and he's been searching God for a long time and he understands a little English he can speak a little English and he was baptized here I believe it was about two weeks ago I think and then um he had a problem of smoking and and we prayed for him in the back and here's this wonderful testimony I thank the Lord for the blessings he is bestowing on me before I was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I had not felt what I have felt recently amen a strange feeling inside of my body in other words something like pains anguish inside of me to such extent that I wanted to scream while I was uh working on my job I felt like running out my hands were not strong enough to to do my work in my mind there were two voices one saying you have to be light l i g HT uh wherever you go you must test ify with yourself in other words a new birth the other voice saying why to leave the things of the world because you enjoyed before like that so sudden the devil speaking and God speaking see why leave the world in the things of the world smoke a cigarette you will quit with the time the voice told him that if you're smoking you'll get rid of it it's all right there something uh lie that's nothing no sin this is amazing no wonder he didn't want me to read this this morning huh then I also had a bad temper that I could not control but the the prayer uh in my mouth always asking the Lord do not faint the love in me amen and that I'll be and I'll be triumphant over the devil because God himself say I can do all things in Christ who strengtheneth me he also say he will that will permit temptations that your body can resist I thank the Lord because peace and calm has come to me I have more desire and thirst of God's word and love and like Paul said From Grace to Grace I will reach Perfection he does all in me I can do nothing I quit smoking 5 days ago something I could never do every 10 minutes I had to light a cigarette I quit before on on my own but a little while after I went back to smoking I thought I had no hope so I thanked the Lord because while I was walking and smoking a voice said you have to testify I threw it I threw away the pack of cigarettes and said Lord I am in your hands Brother Carlos Gonzaga It's a Wonderful testimony uh to the grace and the sanctifying power of the word the Lord Jesus Christ so now he's showing you this man hardly understands English and he's showing what Christ can do in you if you will let him do it amen blessed be the name of the Lord now we um another little sister called me last night from over here friend to brother Paul Griffins and uh she called me up last night and told me this almost the same thing that she saw she had a dream where there was a ladder a Jacob's Ladder she was singing that song I'm climbing the cuz Jacob's letter and then uh there was Satan on the left side and God on the right side and it was a pull and I understand sister Elizabeth and brother Thomas and Andrew went over to the Griffin's house last night and they listened to a tape and she got stirred up and she called me last night said she just wanted to talk with me and didn't know what to say so I knew that God was dealing with a heart and her mother was outside trying to listen and whatnot and there we led her to the Lord amen so I so you pray for her name is Trish that God will because Grant her the time that she be able to come to service and another little one that was over here with sister Elizabeth she was supposed to be baptized today but because her mother won't let her come and I told the little sister I saids isn't it strange your mother doesn't mind if you put on a minis skirt and have drugs and also go out with boys and also wild party she said that's absolutely right but she Rebels for you to come to this church can you imagine how a mother could have that kind of of a Insanity not to want her daughter to be a a handmaiden of the Lord so but we can pray that God will break that power amen so now we thank the Lord for these good things it's 10 minutes to 12 I want to get straight to the word of the Lord and I want to ask you to stand with me for the reading of the word and one one other uh thing I have here um Brother Gary the brother with one leg he's in St Vincent's Hospital and the visiting hours is from 2:00 to 8:00 p.m. and the room is 469 and he wants to thank you all for your prayers so those of you that because can visit him it would be it would be wonderful to go and see him and it'll be uh on the bulletin board downstairs let's turn to the word of the Lord I'm reading from um a text this morning I asked brother Joey to read that cuz that was the spoken word book that was the message to set a background this morning and I want to read now from Amos 3 the 3r chapter verse 7 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets Revelation 81 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour of half an hour and Deuteronomy 2929 the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of the Lord now let's catch the text and the subject this morning is laying right here in the 29th verse the secret things that God is going to reveal to us and also has revealed to us see belongs unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed the Seven Seals and all these things belong unto us and to our children forever and here's the purpose that we may do all the words of the law this law may God a blessing to reading of his word just uh bow our heads in a moment of Prayer Lord Jesus I pray this morning God that uh this morning as you took us up into Heavenly places Wednesday Lord God this morning may you uh uh relax the people this morning Lord and makes me a little nervous and that I won't feel a tenseness from them and let each one know like you did here Wednesday that nobody's going to miss anything Lord Jesus they can only understand that they think they're going to miss something that because I'm saying they can always get the tape and go back and study it but oh God may they relax so the enemy don't tense them up and then they will really miss it so now Lord Jesus uh we know uh oh God this morning I just feel that we could come to a climax this morning Lord and in this message here in New York City that we were that we have been trying to Proclaim by by Revelation and may there be one great Revelation this morning to Every Soul in here and may everyone know what has been going on here in New York City and may it all be to the glory of God lord Jesus come down now in fellowship with us breathe upon the word of the Lord and May the angels move to their post now God to cut off all unbelief and uh uh uh AC quiet my spirit Lord and the nervousness upon me and weariness dear God and I I committed unto thy hand hands I pray heavenly father and we ask it in Jesus name and his sake amen you may be seated i' like to title this message uh the mystery of the seventh seal I just been lingering just waiting cuz uh it just wasn't right to start you see and I know um I don't want to be too long with you but I do feel that this message on my heart that um that well let me put it this way on page one in Christ is a mystery of God revealed brother Bram he was praying and he said Lord may this message that it would cap it all off he's speaking about storing up food and he was praying that this particular message would be a cap to storing to the the food stored up that it would show that you're God and that this is your word and your truth and on page 94 as he was singing and worshiping God in because in the end here he says not knowing of of course being spiritual you watch spiritual things not knowing this God knows it but if you turn and look at the clock it's on the dot 2:00 the end of the second pull the third pull is at hand I know very few knew what he was even talking about then about the we thought we was in the third pole when the Seven Seals open up and now uh we read here that uh the second pool was ending up and later on I begin by Revelation to understand what he was talking about cuz as more messages come out you have to wait you see other words you couldn't know what he meant then until he had finished in 65 then you could know so you're not going to know what I'm saying until the message is finished amen here we go then if you realize that you're not going to know then you'll just sit back you see and and you'll just relax praise the Lord I feel I just keep saying it over and over again because I know that God gave such a wonderful Victory last Sunday and then I come back here here I see the same thing trying to move in again see I thought it was just finish with you know just sit back and relax so you're not going to miss nothing because I can't show you anything only is a revelation and the Hol whatever the Holy Spirit wants you to get this morning he'll give it to you if you could only settle on that you know just what he's going to get that's what you're going to get and be satisfied if it's just one spoonful this morning well take your Spoonful and sit back and take that you see that's it see me now he'll show you more later don't you feel him quickening that to you now so you're not going to miss anything you ain't going to lose nothing nothing you're going to lose you're not going to the tapes are here it's all here you're way ahead of the entire world already be satisfied you let me say it again you're already ahead of the rest of the entire world in the message now please yeah you're already ahead they got to catch up to you hey so aren't you satisfied right now well my praise God I mean um amen now just relax see praise the Lord now um I'm I'm praying that a message this morning would just cap off all that I've tried to preach concerning the revelation of this message I want God to show it to you what he showed me Peace by peace over the years and I didn't know what I was doing he got it see he he show you what he he took 8 years to show me 10 years he'll show you in one message this morning that's all I'm praying for see and then you got it you see and then you'll know but you'll understand when you get it so you'll know why this is I'm going to preach it right to you and you're going to know what it is so right now amen see now when we went out to Tucson not knowing see just going feeling in the will of the Lord to go for a a little vacation and then preaching out there under great strain you see cuz this is nothing wow Amen brother it was a battle there see and cuz you're you got a background but there was no background whatsoever for nothing and you ask sister colan she'll tell you see there was no kind of background at all and that's what the strain I had to preach under I was getting about 3 hours sleep every night for for 18 days that's all the sleep I got and I was already tired you understand now and that was the strain see and then I just one of them things that's all see so now you don't know the strain when uh people with intellect trying to figure out what you're talking about that almost kills a spiritual person they're trying to catch your words and through the senses figure out what you're saying it's a revelation so don't touch it leave it alone amen see so now um so therefore with that thought there um and going out there and then um excuse me uh the message that was preached and thinking about I know the the middle Sunday was a rough time you know and then getting the the messages back fry and listening to them brother Hunt uh uh listened to them also and I saw what God had done and first I said well now how could I get these tapes to each person in here take 6 to S months and by by time each each one of you got those tapes it take about 6 to seven months and there's no kind of way you could even set it up so brother Hunt he s suggestion that could we just play him here so therefore um Wednesday we're going to play the first tape Wonder and after you hear this morning's message and the title to the first tape is but now I see so after this morning's message I think Wednesday all of you will see now there's something going on spiritual now see and then the next one was uh every place every day and I wrote something down here I see my brother Vincent here I wrote it down and left my mind but I got you brother happy to see him back in the house of the Lord after having a operation we happy to see brother Vincent back here this morning and so now um then the next message being um every place every day and that was the one where the enemy fought with all he was worth and it's one that because brother green had to send out because he uh that's his Sunday morning message which he sends out and that was a message I preached pure word the promises of God and they didn't know what I was talking about it was the heart straining and pushing and whatnot then that night I preached the who can but prophesy and then on that message there that ran into the the devil with all Force came at me because I mentioned because the intelligence the Holy Spirit the promise and he tried to cut off that promise you see and but you'll hear the tape when I heard it back boy the power of God just went right straight on through there I didn't even know it cuz when you're under that string you don't know what you're saying really because your mind goes away from you and the mind of the Lord moves in and before even went out the Lord said I'll give you a mouth and I'll give you wisdom and when I heard back each t I saw the wisdom of God and the wisdom of God is going to be is going to be a revealed to you this morning I said it's going to be every one of you going to understand it this morning see so I know that so therefore there's nothing to get tense and excited about amen and then the the last message and then uh brother Perry twice not understanding what I said and he came behind me two times trying to correct and make it everything are all right but he missed missed what I said so and so I said nothing and on that middle Sunday there in the morning and night and it was about the interpretation of the I said the lion roars I says and we have the trouble is in the message that men are trying to uh defend a line with their interpretation of the message I said just open up the cage and let that line Roar out his own interpretation everybody called it but brother Perry missed that you see so he thought I was saying that you don't have to defend the word I didn't say that I said defend the word with your interpretation that's all together different and then I was speaking about being numb and then an elder brother came and told me the following Saturday about the the remark the intelligence and Sh and types and shadows and when I put those four in a row numbness where the enemy tries to move with a shiver and a sensation I said there what's right there and the interpret ation of the message there it is right there second point and types and shadows which is the word see and then the the last one the promise for now the intelligence Jesus Christ the enemy hit those four points with a full blast and now you know what I was on and then tried to kill us and run us off the road Sunday even before I could bring it to a climax but God uh intermingled all things for good and then that night to me it was a masterpiece having all these books and what not trying to explain what I meant and brother Perry saying we'll be here till midnight with all those spoken word books and then not touching one of them Holy Spirit came back and hit those four points himself and said everything that I wanted to say I didn't even know it until after so I tell you it runs from the morning Unity of the faith to that night who can but prophesy and then every promise then who can but could prophesy but now I see rather and then running to the last message there is a river that was the last one and showing them that the intelligence is the holy spirit is here and so God got the Victory and realizing that the message was preached on those five tapes everything that's been preached here for 10 years was preaching five tapes that's what I'm trying to explain to you this morning so I'm praising God for that it wasn't me it was Jesus Christ now we are reading here now um we are uh speaking as to uh mature people that can receive the word by spiritual Revelation now uh this mystery which we were predestinated to the adoption of sons and daughters so let me read here from page 17 I'm just going to take my time because uh took about 10 years to get to this spot so will take my time this morning amen praise God and so now um if you want to mark down these Pages where now I can't I cannot preach this tape it's impossible you know that so I can only sat down this morning it was very hard to put this together cuz I had to sit and wait for the Holy Spirit to go over all these pages and put a message out and take what he was saying here and then last night uh because the Holy Spirit showed me a lot of things what brother Bram had said here and I want to bring it out to you this morning now um I want to read from page 17 now God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery and that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning now I'm teaching this morning and I might get some start eating some big grapes amen so therefore don't pay me no mind see when I get the inspiration strikes me but you got to teach it so you can get it and that's what I want to speak on to this church this morning the the hidden Mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living see and then you will understand clearly then see on I believe what is being done now watch God's great mystery of how is a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it excuse me that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of a half an hour and seven Thunders uttered their voices and John was even forbidden to write it the coming of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet this is in 63 now of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't no he has showed or revealed that it in every type that's in the Bible now here we go here this right here now this is what the Holy Spirit showed me I was rejoicing here therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ see now now here it is now just the point the holy spirit will strike to you sitting here the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible now here it is and all the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been en tyed and expressing what God's Great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed heeld it and CH us and God's help we'll see it right here this morning what the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it therefore you can see the great meaning of what has been to know this he speaking about his own self and then try to bring it to the people see that's like me this morning amen and then you don't cuz you haven't went into details and tried to explain as God has revealed it to me now he's saying here I'm coming back up this quote just we're teaching and everything everybody settled down the entire Bible I'm just now the holy spirit's coming back and striking the different points that he showed me this morning the the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ every word of it the entire Bible the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God has had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been in type and expressing what God's goal is and when I got that one I says my one goal one purpose Jesus said search the scriptures the scriptures they testify of me then then Herod is right here testifying oh I know you're getting it everyone from Abel amen all the way down to John were testifying of Jesus Christ praise God Christ is a principal theme of the entire Bible St Luke 24 wrote to emus the 6-hour sermon when he had when he come back in the resurrection and they not knowing the scriptures they testify of him they said what he would do and how he would do it and Christ comes back around and his old fools and slow of heart Amen Let me uh read the scripture here if as long as you got time I don't have to rush do you mind stay here to 5:00 wonderful a now let's go praise the Lord I feel felt Shackled you know now if you get hungry and you have to go it's all right you just get up and leave that's all right you can pick up the tape after but if I know I not being rushed then it' be all right see so now um St Luke 24 uh 24 um and then uh then he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe to believe see all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and here it is beginning at Moses which is Genesis you understand and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself amen himself amen then he is the principal theme of the entire Bible amen there he is then he he come back in St Luke 24:45 and after he came in the room and showed himself then he opened their understanding to all of the scriptures to the principal theme of the entire Old Testament he opened their understanding to himself in every point other words he was in Moses he was in Abraham Isaac and Jacob and all Gideon and Barack and he was that was him and then when brother Brown was speaking here and I saw what he was talking about amen the word this word is the revelation of Jesus Christ if you want to know the secret of what brother Bram was talking about read the word there's the secret amen Christ being revealed in his word through these little people who didn't know what they were doing they were just living like you are every day they didn't know they didn't have no Revelation as to what they were doing but without knowing it they were typing out Jesus Christ in their day that's what the Holy Spirit struck me with last night oh you get it now everybody got it and then the inspiration coming I said my that's what brother BR was talking about it's the word it's not going to this place and that place it is the word of God from Abel all Adam all the way through think of it those women and those men in Hebrews 11 that's Christ that was the spirit of the Living God and them people moving them and making them take the word against everything he lived in caves and dens they was s of Thunder beaten in everything else what was it it was the word those women like Sarah them it was the word word in those sisters amen not like those old MB women praise God with the hair hanging down all straggling and all because corns on their hands were working hey those were Daughters of God that was the word the spirit of Christ in those women in those men but they didn't know it they didn't have the Holy Ghost praise God amen amen but they was doing what comes naturally they were children of God they love the word they put it on the ears and the head and everywhere that's all it is there's your secret under the seventh seal the sword the word coming to a bride to live for8 years God praise the Lord God hallelu take off my coat we home this morning amen praise God Christ is the theme now we got it am now do you understand the man of God don't know what he's doing each child and each age don't they just they living naturally it's natural for us to get saved and baptized it's natural for the women want to clean up it's natural for the seed now I hope you got that the seed therefore if if the Min got to plead with you to look like Christ something's wrong with you but not like the olden time ones they didn't have the Holy Ghost but something in the heart was making them live right righteousness and God revealed the word that they The Secret Of God that they might do all the things in the law well what about Malachi 4 reveal the secret of God that he'd have a bride on the word to do every a word in the Bible without being told a a revelation a inspiration striking that you want to do it amen now we got it amen now I know what I was stagging around here for 10 years couldn't help it right amen something was driving me on and the Revelation kept coming and kept coming and kept coming every day something that else was happening I was living naturally going to work and doing like what you're doing but there was something pulsating Spirit of Christ amen in all of us something pulsating yes amen you got it that's why we're here amen I didn't know what I was doing no more than what you knew I didn't know what this secret was but I know one thing the word came and had come yeah now I know what was going on I'm looking back amen praise God Christ is the theme the entire Bible my praise praise the Lord God now this great mystery as he spoke as you read this morning here so I'm I got a lot of notes but letting the Holy Spirit lead amen even the mystery which have been hidden from ages and from Generations but now is being made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory my now you going to know who come into you in the form of seven Thunders to live the word we're going to get into it now amen so now the threefold purpose of God and brother Bram saying here now um notice now God has had a threefold purpose here's a mystery here now in this in this great mystery secret God in this great mystery secret that he had before the world began he's got a threefold purpose in it and now what we want to go on upon this morning is what is that three-fold purpose see now I Believe by the help of God he's present and he'll show it to us now if he had this threefold purpose we want to find out what is this threefold purpose the first thing that was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people amen he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God who who covered all Space and Time and Eternity he could not he's too great to be revealed to people excuse me and he speaks about fatherhood and so forth now he wanted to express himself that was one of his three that was one of his great three-fold purposes was to express himself this is number one identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in Christ that's number one second to have the preeminence in his body of Believers that is his bride that he might live in his people and get them back cuz as they was lost like like Adam and Eve amen and and the only way to get him back now if doubt took the entire race away how can doubt how can you get back by doubt I don't understand it how can you come back to God with doubting unbelief that's why brother Brown preached the way he preached it's impossible to come back by doubting unbelief in the word when that was the very thing that because they had lost their salvation through doubting one word how where you going to get by doubting one word it's impossible amen see and um brother B goes on saying here God's Great purpose revealing himself in heaven first to to reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the godhead body then bring that fullness of godhead Bly into a people that he could have the om to his rightly position that fell by sin by the first Adam my God moving through able to have the preeminence amen God moving through every son Before the Flood to have the preeminence moving through Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and uh Joseph and Moses and all through them and the prophets to have the preeminence amen just so Christ could get out amen and then those people acting normally and naturally cuz they were part of the word in their generation and they were just doing what comes naturally that's why brother Bram said if you have the spirit of bethoven because bethoven then you do what he did amen praise the Lord if you have the spirit of Christ you do what he did if you're a seed of God you do what they did here in the Bible which is our types and shadows it's natural it's not no a chomping down and trying to make you see it no it's is a revelation upon the rock of this Revelation I'll build my church as to who what as to who Christ is the word amen and the word is the revelation of Jesus Christ now he so there there was now there's his great mystery that's how he got Christ into the people through the word amen that's his great three-fold purpose to get Christ the word into you the hope of glory amen see get the people to Christ not to the church and I want to lay something down here page 64 if you're taking it down and 65 this one struck me last night make it his mystery to known to his bride his bride tree the Redeemed by Christ going back home to be restored back list listen so many people's got the wrong conception to convert people to to Christianity and to its government government is not God's thought at all you say or we make a converts to Christianity by its government that's not it well they they're not supposed to drink and they're not supposed to lie he's speaking about the muhammadans and also Africa and African tribes the Shi they put us to shame what he said now notice god making himself known we're not supposed to make converts to Christianity by a government Jesus said at that day at that day the Revelation made known you'll know that I'm in the father and the father in me and I in you so therefore that struck me I said that's it it's not Church order it's not uh smoking and drinking and colleting down your dress and also paying your ties that's government that's the government of the church you see what you got in this message now paying their ties and the women stop cutting their hair and letting down their dresses and also obeying their husband what is that many women do it and and they're Sinners and do it better do it better is knowing Christ it's not government God praise God it's not the church order it's not doing this just right because not because coming here Sunday morning also Wednesday and getting a tape and a book and whatnot that's intellectual conception that God slayed Sunday morning on the battlefield so Revelation between you and Christ that he's come into you and you and knew him and having a love affair that's what it is you love the word of God you got to have it praise God let me get something over here amen blessed be the name of the Lord Praise there a love of here this right here I'm going all over this book here

morning of the believer that is the body of Christ what was God's what was God's once great Secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest think of it oh I'm sure we don't get it I can't see it the way I ought to but I'm sure you don't see it but God's great mystery here it is now men and women now see what the the Eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ then was given out down to his church of what was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ can you imagine the the the Thunders that was in God's that nobody know is it is in [Applause] US it thundered but I'm going explain to you worry praise God Jesus here it is Jesus making love to his because to the church his bride Whispering secrets to her amen you know how you tell your wife things you know the little girl you're going to marry because you love her so much you just tell her the secrets and get her up next to you and love you and everything you know how it is that's what God Christ is doing to the church see he's letting her know the secrets just the secrets not these flirters I mean his wife all right now amen you got it not the ones that you cuz they walk in here you got to tell them stop this and stop that that's a flirt with the world but I mean the man and woman that's that has met God and the world they have renounced the world they don't even want the world Amen then to them he whispers Secrets not to the ones who come in here through the government [Applause] MH not to the government not to paying TI and offerings and because because not cutting your hair letting down your dresses not to that many women in the world do that not to that but to those with a revelation and they so they love God and they so see that he is her lover and he is trying to get the preeminence the oversight the leading to the word of God in her and then she just lives and acts and walks and talks and you don't have to explain everything to them they don't come to you in the back asking all kind of silly questions they are doing it doing it yes they do it from the heart they want to do it oh praise His name see it's a revelation converts are coming into the the church government by intellectual Conception Church ought to pay your ti believe and whatnot and they are preaching in this message that this message is the Holy Ghost see oh that's the Baptist Doctrine when you believe the message because you got the Holy Ghost that's Baptist Doctrine every one of you know it when you believe you got it the prophet has said it over and over again it's a something a new birth it's a birth you die and God comes in and shakes you and says move over here I'm in here now amen all old things have passed away I'm living in here now that's it amen that's is a revelation praise God the church is the blood of Christ we're his blood by the spirit this you are the blood atonement here amen right here the blood atonement is here this morning amen well who is the atonement Christ is the atonement the sacrifice that's in you and me that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptizes us into his body that recognizes only his word prisoners to the word of God amen amen praise the Lord the secret amen here page 29 speaking about Heavenly places Ephesians 1 15 I was preaching this out there they didn't know I was talking about amen predestinate us until the the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will predestinated there's the mystery see before Christ or anything else was ever on Earth you see this great mystery that he chose the bride knowing Eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to that word they were predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by Jesus Christ predestinated the church to that glorious stand and you're standing that's a a predestinated stand amen I have other Pages at which I'll just skip them I think you understand what is now page 55 56 57 the preeminence of Christ let me uh pick it up I don't want to miss something here so I want to make sure what it is it's the secret of the mystery because to the bride and 5556 well here's a a good one here page 56 and in there there be a Time come forth when he can express himself in fullness of his godhead deity uh oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people you anointed oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed but why accepting what Eve turned down coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see Anointed with the word what Eve turn down amen uh why he has the the premises God fully manifested in Jesus Christ God's Great secret of his Revelation this great light of Revelation has always blinded the wisdom of the world praise our God page 67 excuse me declare him actions page 70 I'm just going to skip a lot of this here I had it down here marked before now we see then see this great Revelation here God's great mystery being unfolded that's been hid since the foundation of the world but here it is now but uh because a prefigured it all the way down through down Through the Ages it was pre figured by God in tight now I'm going to pick up where he where I'm reading from here now God's great mystery here down Through the Ages yes he has been slowly unfolding this mystery praise God now do we get the point here now God all the way down from Abel not the way God is he don't want to show his secret all at once so he slowly unfolds his secret yes and in 1965 they tried to get it e did all at once MH and he took all all that time through the Bible to unfold it generation after generation after generation then he come back when from ad33 and he begin to because unfolded again amen through the seven churches and they probed at it trying to get the quick answer looking for a lucky goal strike but I've sank my chef down into the vein of Jesus Christ and I'm not moving I don't care about a strike over there or a strike over there I have struck at rich and I shall not be moved amen I struck at rich brother so now down Through the Ages God typing himself out through Moses and Joseph and also all the prophets amen all of those things type him just in type but yet the mystery was hid let me strike uh page 32 here now now all those things type him David and Joseph and all these things here doing actions not knowing what they were doing you understand now just doing what came naturally to them and they were didn't know it in their generation they were typing out Jesus Christ think on it now now you know what you've been doing for the past 8 years of Soul amen you've been typing out Jesus Christ the word on the earth praise what a what a Ministry anointed Messiah is on the earth just walking in living oh that's what he wanted and and look when he did it against a time when it's almost humanly impossible to live right yeah amen is that right look at the anointing out here on the Devils out here the a good person can hardly stay good anymore the love of many has waxed cold and against all of that God anointing a people a bride by the now you know why it takes the word suppose you didn't have the word and you had a feeling last night brother you gone the next day with that feeling but the word anointing Lord I'll be with you always to the end not a feeling a shiver it's the word the Pentecostal one that's shivering that feeling that good feeling is speaking in tongues but the word word has brought you through praise God all those things type him just in type but yet the mystery was hid them man didn't know what they were doing they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do something oh how I love Jesus amen that's all they know that's what you're doing you feel led to do that that's Christ if it's in the word where you worried about should I should I not should I you know what's in the word you read the word of God you hear a prophet why should I sh T night and doing a little dance do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's in the word it's God in you doing it and you take a step in did did the devil kick your foot back but take that step in the light stepping in the light of the word of God Don't Be All Shook Up they did it they didn't care if somebody criticized so you're going to be criticized so [Applause] what so what you criticized they ain't got one thing to do with it you're saved what's they going to do with it supp to amen so they criticize only Growing Pains it shows that you're different from them that's all it means you're want to do right and they want to do evil so when you do right they criticize I mean the church also you know amen got that one in praise the Lord now you see we could teach each one of those prophets and bring their lives out to show it express Jesus Christ perfectly amen exactly you uh yet here it is never given his secret in full now that's why I say this one don't try to know anything I'm saying he not going to give it to you in full he's going to reveal it to you as he wants to amen see never knowing the secret and for waiting for to make it known in the land last days our days amen as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehended before he could express it if he told the whole thing because the Bible's written in Mysteries Jesus thanked the father for it see it was wrote in Mysteries amen all those things type him yet the mystery was hid then no man didn't they didn't know what they were doing I'm bringing I'm laying it down and they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do something something they are led by the spirit to do something and we are led by the spirit to do what we're doing here today that's why we here this morning see now uh since ad33 led by the spirit in every age to do something not knowing fully what you're doing but Faith makes you do it see you I don't know what I'm doing all the time but I do I feel led to do it then I find out it turns out right that ain't me cuz if I would figure out through my five C said I'd never do it now if I do this here because this is going to happen there I thought reasoning the whole thing out when you finish with ain't nothing left you done figured the whole thing out prepaid it and figure this one out and so on so he'll be there no I better not because uh because he won't have his car but if we take so and so's car that's foolishness amen and you know you go through these things that's not Faith just do it amen should I ask brother keman no well maybe I should no ask Jesus Christ in you not to ask me I'm asking the same person in me I'm praying and every day Lord lead me I can't lead you amen praise the Lord let him Le it it led them and without the Holy Ghost I just read it to you their actions without the Holy Ghost it led them they didn't even have the Bible in the tapes they had to go to the temple and some were scattered all around they only went up to that great Temple because three times a year the the males went up there and yet they had something amen and we got books tapes uh we we got preaching Church everything oh my I don't know amen see led by the spirit see but something in you pulsating and you're trying to get the preeminence now there's the mystery of your Seven Seals now CU now here we go now the coming I'm on page 33 now the coming of the Lord is a mystery we don't know when he's coming but he's coming but we know he's coming see and so was all the mysteries of God waiting for this last day after it's already been completed then he reveals he shows what he's done om my never gave his mystery in full now remember this here he never changes from this statement here he hides it in a mystery and he drops a revelation upon those who are elected to see it amen even because all of those different Angels never had it in full Paul caught it and out he went because Reus also polycarp they never had it in full they called a revelation it left a lot of loose ends but Along Comes A little humble prophet and gathers up all the Loose Ends and tells us so that we could comprehend we have all of that for us to to begin to walk in 1966 my God how can we fall knowing the Seven Seals of God the entire Bible there's no excuse for us friends no uh-uh those people didn't even have no Bibles they had a revelation and they went with it now you see my amen see it's the truth it's the scripture and here it is right on this tape here and then this week here Holy Spirit bringing us back here do you get it if you fail in trying to figure it out come back here and you find that it's just the word of God in you living out a life how humble how simple that's all it is now there's nothing you cuz you read the book or you heard to take and I I I went through there and I telling my wife I asked God to show me I know with something simple in here and the other one is perfect weakness perfect strength there Simple Thing laying right in here see and and then I saw what he was doing here and I began about maybe 12 14 pages just on one theme Revelation because like identification [Music] that it should be scattered he comes back and picks up those things those doctrines they started and brought it on out and revealed the whole thing same thing he's doing now in revealing the mystery of Christ same thing he's doing now in revealing the mystery of Christ how he was God's three-fold purpose for the church oh my let it out reveal now brother Braham reveal the mystery of the seal yeah the seal itself had been broken long time ago you understanding there he revealed the mystery and the Mystery on the first seal was Jesus Christ in a message to the church coming into the people and living themselves out Jesus Christ under the second seal the mystery of that seal was Christ in that church and the Antichrist coming against it all the time that's all he ever was in there and then other men coming with with their own ideas Church government dogmas and Creeds and leaving a lot of scattered and loose ends amen and then the seventh angel comes along and opens up six Mysteries six seals here I have a book on that proving this word the last page page 56 do do you believe the truth they are the truth and you accept it not because I said it because God said it do you believe that we're living in the last days when a son of man was to be manifested that would be all the word that is gathered up through Luther Wesley Baptist and all that and the Pentecostal all gathered up to the revelation of what it has been the seventh seal the seventh angel here it is was to open the six seal mystery is gathered up in the son of man his fullness of time has come to the full of his word word to manifest the full of his body that is the word that is the spoken word made manifest by the word reveals the word the spoken word made manifest by the word itself coming down reveals the word spoken word made manifest by the pill ofier the word coming down and he revealed all what it was very simple it revealed the word and the word is the Revel of Jesus Christ the entire Bible my heart God put it over on the devil and they thought it was some great thing it is the word so humble and simple oh my God my God I just love it like this cuz I know what I've been doing for 10 years what a faith came into me yesterday when I knew what I was doing and all the time against the word word and all the time it was God trying to get the preeminence in New York City that's all he was trying to do get the preeminence in our lives to manifest the word to get the promises to us praise God see how God's great three-fold mystery because his great purpose rather the mystery hidden which is Christ in you the hope of glory it ties right into the Seven Seals the mysteries of them the mystery of this entire Bible how God wanted to have the preeminence in all of because of his people in the in the Old Testament here then it it come right out here on the day of Pentecost and went into seven Church ages and sealed with Seven Seals and the prophet of God comes along and and he reveals the Mysteries under each seal the seal itself broke then if the prophet was to reveal the entire Bible the mystery of this Bible here being Christ on this message capped off the second poll you got it he Reve on this tape right here he he said let me cap it off to show it's the word and he capped it off and show it this Bible even this mystery which was hid amen it is the mystery of it is Christ in you the hope of glory so he revealed The Mystery of the Bible then went on and into seven seal Mysteries amen because he first he had the six seal mystery and then he revealed this then he went waiting for that seventh seal mystery The Mystery of the seal then we found out that the mystery under uh this entire Bible was Christ and the Mystery under those six seals was Christ redeeming his people amen and the word living in them then what is is the mystery under the seven seal you got the answer Christ coming down present tense day by day and redeeming us every day by the word to make sure other words suppose the M age moved in and all we had was those gifts and we were still Pentecostal babies everyone would be in the insane institution and you know it cuz you would know what to do but he came down himself as the word and reveal himself as the word to take us through and all we had to do was just because just read the word also hear the tapes and Obey it then he would be getting the preeminence in us and that preeminence itself on the Earth would show that you saw your name in the Lamb's Book of Life because you walk in the Earth as a predestinated word of God on the earth your actions typing out Jesus Christ the word of God wise love your husband I mean husband love your wives and so forth and love one another right here on the earth doing that and that's all he asked for that's all see now it's the mystery of it see so now we see then that um the Old Testament Christ getting the the preeminence each type expressing Jesus Christ exactly yet never given his secret in full waiting for it to be made known in the last days waiting for it to be fully comprehended amen see search the scriptures they testify of me they tell you what I am see now then comes the mystery praise God the mystery of the seventh seal then if God has always uh broken a seal and revealed a revelation under that seal and those and those people serve God under each seal and because when they die he seals them away a a temporary judgment Falls up on the earth and then he drops a another Revelation a messenger Goes Forth and also calls out God's people a temporary judgment Falls and those people are sealed away all the way down never yet fully revealing his secret but in the last days making it known to William brandom to what he was doing all the time and then brother Bram telling us that he that seventh seal open but it's a total secret it's the end times a seal and when it goes forth it's connected with seven Thunders to the coming of the Lord how he comes and when he comes and we know that he has already come well then how do we know well how did he come he himself set on the seven seal I won't even get it now because you know what it is he said the sword in sainia Canyon see bring on his holy vesture it's the word he said see the secret the word see the mystery the word this was the portion that he had blocked off of that tape you remember that there it's in that portion right there it's the word then the word then the seven Thunder mystery would bring back The Headstone is that right then The Headstone has come back in the form of a a shout and he's here all the time he's here this morning in the form of a message but he said it be a total secret see amen now he says you're not going to be able to know it through your senses amen praise God oh my yeah I got it right in here yes sir I caught that one also in here praise God yes sir just take your time here here it is Page 44 now you see so therefore there's no school no Theologian no teachers in the Bible among any school that knows anything about it they cannot know nothing about it it's impossible for them to know anything about it here it is God has hid the senses of knowing God has hid the senses of of knowing it from the very elected teachers and everything else it's a personal all the little illiterate ones Oh my he loves them oh I just love to say this here Amen brother Tony God has hid the senses of knowing what sense imagination memory affection conscience and reasoning power so sit back and relax you will never know it straining and straining and straining it's a revelation sit back and let God crack you in the forehead and then you got it I hope this morning you finally got it let me read it again now God has hid the sensus of knowing it from the very elected teachers and everything else it's a personal individual affair with the person that Christ has revealed to them amen there you are there's your church two or three of those gather he's in the midst there he is oh praise God and if you say he has been revealed to me then the life that Christ produced here in the Bible all the way through now amen types and so forth you know like that all the way through is a life following the word of God not dos and don't also Church government that forget about that talking about life amen then the life that Christ has produced here in the Bible that same life is in him does not produce itself in you then you got the wrong Revelation amen see now here it is God is known by Simplicity and a revelation of Jesus Christ excuse me in the most illiterate person let that one sink now God is known by simplicity and of Revelation in the most illiterate person now you know what kind of ministers he got in the last days and you ran after those teachers see not your theology it's a revelation of Jesus Christ Upon This Rock I'll build my church this is page 45 here no other rocks Revelations except it no other things accept it no other Roman Rock no other Protestant Rock no other school no other nothing but on exactly the revelation of Jesus Christ in a new birth he is born in there and injects his own life and your life is gone and the life of Christ is is is projecting itself through you with the [Applause] at all my now you see why we need those Dynamics amen see Watch God's Great Revelation unfolding now here it is but by lack of this Revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us and so much mockery so much division Among Us is because the people lack that Revelation see they lack that Revelation the teachers he said there you are see so now my think on it now the most illiterate person is not who you think it should be it's not your genealogies oh God sure did it amen he sure did it see is the eagle gets it the eagle Revelation gets it well I can tell yall some things and sister Coman can tell you all around they look for the high ones the high and mighty ones and they block up their church with unbelief you try to I said Lane I said when we was out a certain place out here I said can you imagine me preaching when I preach to these people here these men here long Cadillacs and all kind of things like this here campers and trailers and whatnot and come and sitting down in your church all starch you better not say one word that they don't understand through the senses you hear what I said you better not you better not say by Revelation one word that they don't understand through their senses Amen brother Ben Oh How I Love Jesus but God give me some humble people in New York City [Applause] amen praise the Lord they believe they don't understand it amen they believe it amen now you see there's something special about New York he put all of us together here amen I went out there the other place there wow when I try to preach through there forget about it senses you understand and so here is a revelation of Jesus Christ the eagle and the ministers bringing over the old ecclesiastical way of doing it in the Pentecostal age through study in the intellect bring it over here and a little old Eagle don't know his ABCs blessed out of Revelation I didn't heard from my theophany there a't no what he even talking about amen there you are praise God so now what happens uh this this the seven seal Seven Seals left a lot of loose ends Malachi 4 comes back around and reveals the mystery what happened under those seals amen then comes and brings The Headstone the sword the word and releases The Headstone and God takes him away and then The Headstone is himself he's on the earth he's a blood atonement he wants to come into some hearts some Eagles and no matter who you are what you look like he wants to come in right at the same time he's bringing in a word anointing there's a powerful s Matthew 2 24 24 anointing the censes you understand and they coming right together the intellectual conception of the message is coming right down with the message I'm going to show you why this morning amen then comes the revelation of the mystery now if God has always broke a seal and let the people go by inspiration let's say here in New York here now I told my wife I said I don't want to speak no more I the last day I want to refer back to anything going on here feel we should be past it after this day but this is brought out to that you would know what has transpired here amen so we don't have to uh I feel I don't want to even say no more about it because when this message here amen goes out if he would send it out then Christ is on the spot proven that on the spot but this here is to be proven to you that is the word amen that's what's going on this morning praise the Lord see and after this is finished then see then if you should go here there he's on the spot in Dynamics he proves it himself out there and you don't have to refer back to this cuz it's all finished with amen oh praise the Lord see now he opens the seal up the people catch a revelation and they live it out in their hearts in their lives by by by Revelation then the the messenger is gone then God has always come back as he showed his because his Prophet what was under those seals then shouldn't God come back again as the voice of the Archangel and show his bride what's under the seventh seal the Loose Ends that the false anointed took these loose ends and Scattered it around the world abstinence this here and that there and all kind of foolishness Loose Ends under the seventh seal you got me now shouldn't a voice return turn back for one more ride I'll ride this Trail once more where they have polluted my heavenly places where the word is is Heavenly places and they have brought in pollution of some man's eye there in church government and and and also his opinions and the ground is polluted I got sheep in there and I'll get my Sheep amen I'll come and tell them what the Revelation is I'll tell them what's under the seventh seal like I'm telling you this morning I'll tell them later I'm telling you this morning you get me oh praise the Lord amen I'm telling you this morning so you'll know what has been here yes but I'll ride this Trail once more around and then all of my ministers will say the same thing preach the same Revelation by [Applause] inspiration God oh praise God and I'll show what I did through Malachi 4 amen praise God the seventh angel reveals amen The Mystery of the Lord praise God this end time seed Goes Forth let me I'll just skip all this here now we see this great Secret The Headstone has come forth the seventh angel to reveal the mystery of the Seven Seals amen should not he also revealed the seventh seal and the word is the revelation of Jesus Christ then the third pull was the opening of the word the word to open up to come into our hearts now he has revealed God's hidden Mystery the three-fold purpose then he then he reveals the Seven Seals and Christ is the mystery of the seventh seal the sword the word there'll be no mimics to this no impersonations amen now number seven is complete finished number eth is a a new order of things now on the Statue of a perfect man in 2 Peter 1 5-7 the bride under the seventh seal mystery like all the others under the six seals and all the Bible types in obedience expressing Christ by becoming part of the word in obedience this morning and letting Christ get deeper Eminence in her life like all the rest of the seals by her identifying herself with every word making herself weak perfect weakness he's bringing it on through the word amen and when we get perfectly weak then he's able to bring his perfect strength amen now in this very a deceiving age now Satan can impersonate Seven Virtues we driving at home now took a long time getting here he can impersonate Seven Virtues Satan can impersonate any gift the prophet told us he can also impersonate Faith that's right he can also because impersonate virtue Temperance godliness knowledge oh yeah maybe you don't believe me huh I'll read it to you we got it right here in the word praise God let me see [Applause] amen 20 yeah yeah this is Blasphemous names the the Tabernacle now you say brother Brandon did should we speak with tongues absolutely that's gifts of God but those gifts of God without these virtues in them makes a stumble block to the unbeliever it's not accepted by God this has to be first and and when you have faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness and brotherly love then the Holy Ghost comes down and seals you as a unit as the same as he seals the church age as a unit the way he makes his bride is the way he makes his his individual made out of the same material like Eve was made out of Adam a rib from the side here is the things that you have to have first you can't impersonate them you can't imitate them they've got to be God sent and God born imitation only causes confusion and he speaks about a buzz and also a black bird you see now now get this lesson here is what's wrong with the Tabernacle I ought to turn it on for this here's what's wrong with the Bram Tabernacle you see there is two different kinds of Faith two different kinds of virtue are you following me now as I had the other day two different kinds of knowledge two different kinds of of temperance one thinks is prohibition and they ain't got that kind of temperance because God's talking about it's that ungodly uncontrollable temper that you got in things of that type flashback and fuss patience and so forth there's a mockery of it a pretending to be a nature giving Faith a nature giv virtue there's a nature given Temperance and all these things are nature given is the point made amen now don't get quiet on me now amen no please don't do that now no don't don't freeze up now see so now uh we uh we are head to maturity amen amen I'm trying to show you how the devil can deceive you see now here we are see now the bride in obedience expressing Christ by becoming part of the word in obedience now the devil can impersonate we just found out s Seven Virtues now you know where I'm going yes number eight is a new order he can impersonate every gift he can impersonate Seven Virtues these are human virtues the Christian Scientist will outs Smothers on these virtues and you know that and and brother B he's told us that a Christian Science amen you see a light glowing around them because went as a mailman once I went into a Christian sence Church everybody was bright looking just sweet and everything with th with with these human virtues in there by their mind by the thought over other words thought over the matter they just overpower it with the human Minds that can be done those a nature given and you see people who are sweet de kind old priests in the Bible sweet Temperance never fuss and get mad and knowledge of God stand up to him without the mind of Christ see what happens to you you just stand up to their knowledge and their patience and their virtue we getting it now amen so he can impersonate those things but charity never faileth so God Amen Let The Devil come into the Third and HD it and didn't say what it was just a word amen and in those that's catching the word they got it and then they don't know what it's all about but like the old types in the old Bible they acted it out under silence sh silence silence the devil might get a hold of it he can impersonate it so therefore brother BR said there's a great secret lays on here the sword the word amen and and so simple is coming to you this morning wait till it goes out and around the world is going to bust up and blast up all kind of men's opinions and he will vindicate it on the spot amen Christ the third pull speaking out behind it but youve had it for 10 years thank you Lord my we have had it for 10 years what wasn't an action not knowing what it was doing but preaching it by Revelation what Perfection Perfection Perfection just pulsating I must have the prance in New York City I didn't spoke it in 52 through my Prophet there's something about New York City and I got to have the pr in New York City cuz I'm going to do something in New York City I'm going to fill some people with the power of almighty God they're going to shake New York City and turn upside down and it won't be through their Seven Virtues it'll be through charity charity never faileth praise God Satan under the seventh seal coming to Eve you know that is this it's that and while it was spoken to Eve I'm going to multiply and replenish God never revealed it it was the word and under the seventh seal he says he's going to multiply the bride like it was on the de on the day P cost and replenish her and never revealed it amen but it was a spoken word and long as she didn't tamper with that promise it was an oncoming thing and in the season of the Dynamics God was going to bring it to pass and in our season of the Dynamics this message here is C it off the hours upon us for the Dynamics to strike it and bring death oncoming promise to pass amen but Eve got sticky and reached for some wisdom and he impersonated the knowledge of God to her and she ate off the wrong tree amen and so therefore under the seven seal many Eaves concubines false anointed went forth impersonating they they brother BR said that they couldn't mimic it they couldn't even know it because they now now here it is these men are not the elected ones there's no faith seed there therefore they can only use their five human senses how can they know it the teachers how can they know it and then the concubines that ran after absolum and the sight up on the roof of all Israel while David was in rejection the word what happens to them they were wasted used up you understand but the bride went with David in rejection his wife she's humble now bearing a reproach for his name blessed be the name of the Lord for the what's his name we found the other day his person his nature his personality him who's that the word the sword I don't know what else to tell you brother pray is God God reveal it to you it's the word of God Amen however it's a revelation He Goes Forth on the with the intellectual conception of the word Goliath got them pinned down amen we went out to battle Sunday morning and slay them and hit him in the head with the rock of the Salvation stone that Christ is present test right now redeeming you Revelation upon Revelation that is your present tense Redemption am it's going on this morning that's why don't jump ahead just take it one at a time thank you Heavenly Father for let this little seed just now thank you Lord he'll pile more up on top of it but don't get ahead of me don't try to figure out do I have those seven natural virtue I caught it all over the place I know the devil told you that's me my that's not you I I was only bringing out to you how he has ruined the church that's what what what the holy spirit is bringing out to you this morning that's all he's doing so if you can't stand a revelation and you fall down how you going to take the full blast of the word under the Dynamics well you melt if you can't take this little Revelation here amen now I don't know what but how you going take the word be impossible to take the word see now it's a a revelation he almost deceives a very elected under The Greening period that's the only time he could work with the sea when it's green he can't work when it's a mature gold because golden brown cuz the Dynamics is there with it amen see so by Revelation the bride catches the the revelation of the seven seal and all she ever gets that I should I should do thus and so in the word so she does it she don't understand anything else she don't run here and go there and go over there she just tries to Faithfully stay where she at her post and do the word and then she keeps getting this and God blesses her in the word and she's happy she having a love affair and he's given her Secrets Revelation a top of Revelation and not knowing exactly what she's doing but she loves the she loves the word not a church government Satan he can impersonate that see but he cannot impersonate Divine love amen he can come all the way through those Seven Virtues now under the silence period he said he might give away the secret and he didn't want to give away the secret see so now we got two different kinds of Virtues and and one faith is under same Matthew 24:24 a religious spirit and to that is added six virtues man what because number six are what we can do and under this one they'll speak in tongu shout and preach and do everything else in the message amen there's another one coming right alongside of it the Bri amen they're coming along together right here coming along together one is based on acts 238 Faith see now humanly speaking we're adding six virtues during this Greening period And there's Loose Ends everywhere all over the message see and the impersonators don't know where they going at therefore they have to watch it to figure out what you're going to say and what you going to do then they try to do that because my own wife sitting right here at this funeral service saw this poor sister writing down what this man said a wife should do writing it down when it should be in here she was writing it down she saw that out there you see now they take all these strange odd things now Christ is the mystery of God revealed is hid from the senses of knowing and from the very elected teachers can you imagine that God hid it from the very elected teachers so that you wouldn't run after them amen see they wouldn't run after those teachers he sent them out he says go you false anointed ones go ahead I'm going wait but you won't touch my bride she's having a love of fear with me she loves me she that little second cousin I can hear the old Buck board coming down the road she's lived true and a cousins left turned as shame she said but he promised amen praise God up here on Mount Camelback I was up there praying last August and the Holy Spirit spoke in my heart and I was thinking about what would happen after and he gave me a scripture for the Church of God I put it that way 1 Corinthians 26 uh because 1-8 and then I would I said well that I I know what that is and uh I thought about it and that's uh the scripture here 1 Corinthians 2 1-8 because I just read could read it to you spoke to uh to Sister Coman about it and Brethren when I come to you came not with easy of speech or wisdom declar to you the testimony of God for I determin not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the prin of this world that that come to knowth but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory and I got that so I says now I wonder what that means well I know that if you would go if you or would be sent anywhere You' have to go in the power and demonstration of the spirit of the Living God and then I thought back here said well year here in New York City uh God has healed the people raised the dead that your faith wouldn't stand in human wisdom here that he would stand in the power of God to bring Revelation and heal the sick and so forth and then thinking if I would go anywhere this is what he give me and not known anymore until last night and I really got the shouting last night page 46 as brother man's reading here and he said my speech was not uh and my and my speech and my my beseeching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit Power of the power there see there's the gospel see Jesus said go ye in all the world and preach the gospel didn't say go teach he said go preach in other words demonstrate the power and these signs shall follow them just teaching doesn't do it it takes the actual Spirit itself demonstrating these signs listen because to this that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God oh my see to change the man now uh how be it in weakness among you that are perfect and then uh the Lord showed me this this what that meant there full grown perfect and I begin to say well now what does that mean perfect and then brother brandham here on page 46 he said here but we speak the wisdom of God in mystery see the threefold mystery of of God then I begin to shout then I realized that the wisdom that had been spoken here for 10 years and all of it was always pointing to Christ to have the preeminence which is the threefold mystery of God has already been spoken here and then he's telling me here in the sixth verse when this goes out it goes to those that are mature ready to receive it now go back to because about two weeks ago when I was when I was preaching Unity of the faith to those of us that are mature have have come to this spot hold it right there amen amen hold it right there to those that of us that are mature and then to the mature ones you can bring this Revelation as to what God was doing under the seventh seal amen amen and then when this this Revelation strikes as to what he has been doing under the seventh seal then you'll find out that it's been wisdom all the time that's been here bringing you the three-fold mystery of God see that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God and demonstra in the power of God not giving all the exercise of his power but adding to the promises as you chop it out by faith amen see now and we speak this wisdom among them that are perfect oh I hope you can get what I'm trying to say other words the wisdom was spoken out of season maybe I can explain it that way it other hasn't even gone nowhere yet maybe that's better but it was spoken here this wisdom out of SE out of season as to what God was doing by this work word under the seven seal right amen and this is what is to come back upon the bride as he returns back and shows the bride to loose things how this one because went off here and this one because went off there but all the time what was it the word coming in amen and the bride being green and and and a ripe green full of life of this world blind wretched miserable poor and naked and didn't know it because full of of ability and also knowhow education and then for about 10 years in New York the word coming in by Revelation and stripping you absolutely making us weak absolutely making us weak and then the word came into Seven Virtues Faith through brotherly kindness and seven is God's number then if seven is God's number we have become perfectly weak amen then if we are perfectly weak through seven virtues we can't do nothing because it's human it's human you get it now that's why it's human we can't do nothing because we're still human and we got faith and virtue and patience and Temperance but we are still human and we can't do it but in New York he stripped us through these Seven Virtues he brought the word and it wouldn't let us move in this church here here anyway but according to the word I hope you got it it took the starch out of us it took the skin off our hands but he made us perfectly weak could nobody get up and raise up and uh with their own might and power and what call who they are and what not that was stripped out of here amen therefore we're all a weak laying around here amen we can't do nothing the closer we have gotten to him the weaker we have become cuz the more comes forth that you want you can't do it so now being speaking this wisdom this morning of the threefold Revelation God's one purpose amen was to to get his people uh get his word into his people the hope of glory that was his purpose to have the preeminence in his people and here it is this morning praise God to full grown seeds that have rapen and have finally ready my God for the wisdom of God to come in and God coming I hope you get what I'm trying to say God purposely stripping us down by the word many are waiting for thus in Soul nothing is being done just saying playing the tape and whatnot but no Revelation on what he said when you hear those tapes from out there that you understand what I'm talking about and everything I'd say was something new I thought I could understand it everything I'd speak is all new intelligence was a thing that tore up everybody it's on the tapes I said well that that is the Holy Ghost right then when I begin to preach like uh uh New York's a rough place you better have the word they didn't like it so I didn't know what I said he had e and Zion so I saw that the people are blanket it down with the intellectual conception of the message that they believe the message and that's it that's down in the West Indies South America it's in Europe New Zealand Africa all over the world in this country every one of them believe all they have to do is to get baptized acts 238 and that's it and they end the message and here we are you ask them down in the hours and so forth and ask them their condition right now also when you ask them that and you find out what's been here here it's been God I say I'm not going to say it no more now it's been God coming in here with the word to purposely make us perfectly weak through the Seven Virtues to bring on the perfect strength the charity which is the strength of every one of those virtues that's what he's been doing he has done it in New York City by the word of the Lord amen I hope you got it praise God that was my thought this morning amen so therefore it's a revelation to the elected ones that their father right now is revealing he loves him by the mere fact you're sitting in here he collected us here together amen and beat down our intellect amen by bringing forth a revelation and vindicating it yes amen amen beat it down brother that's right see no wonder the devil is howling against it see we was told right there that we all all right and the brother said unless you get out of the word we have the blood we all right we're waiting for the resurrection and the devil don't bother you say my see now that's his way of doing it the bride living the word and expressing Christ by let him have the preeminence is in her and then uh Wednesday night as we were speaking here about the lame man and having a purpose in his heart one day I'm going to be made whole for 38 years straggling around there and finally Jesus Christ saying rise up take up your bed and walk and not even really knowing who Christ was under the seventh seal what it was all about amen you getting it now and then Jesus Christ finding them in the temple assembled together there and coming back and saying behold Thou Art made whole praise God and then says sin no more don't miss the mark with your thoughts and ideas and so forth it's only the word it's not a church government it's the word amen praise God so relax and hit the bullseye every time amen see now after he's already been already been completed which it has now for eight years he returns back and shows the bride what he's done he reveals it is that what this voice is all about is ready to come back here and pick up these loose sins here and show it out now we are nothing we can't do it because it's not by our power nor our might see but by his Spirit now the word itself has made us weak as I said seven complete virtues human and the closer you get to God the weaker you are now now we have perfect weakness Seven Virtues now God's strength number eight Divine love can be made perfect is complete finished human weakness now charity is ready to do it now we can be kind to one another this is human and you know that but now can we love the unlovable can we love the worst white racist or the worst black extremist can we love the filthiest sodomite the dirtiest prostitute through our human virtues this morning can we do that come forward if you can you know you can't but charity will never fail Malachi for had charity and that's the word and he poured it into a bride do you know what he poured into his bride upon our faith he poured a blood atonement into us and this Blood atonement brings down his presence around the blood he sees the blood the blood is here let's say right here in New York City the blood Aton is here listen oh praise God here it comes fresh amen the blood of to is here through Revelation it's the word then if there's a people that's special to God for a purpose and it has received a blood atonement though they don't even understand it but one morning wisdom will come to them and explain it to them and then the blood atonement is there then he can descend the pillar of fire can come down in our midst because the blood atonement is already there by revelation he can't go there because they think it's one Minister many virgins can't go over here cuz it's abstinence do you get it can't go up here in New England because because no more pastors oh get it but here the word the sword the blood [Applause] atonement now you know what has been for 10 years God has put a blood atonement here in New York City the word of God and they say it's uh I'll just say it now I'm not going to say it no more they say it's the white horse rider they say it's the tent and all these things and you yall know that and it and all in the islands and all them places there I just I was sick to find out uh to find out you should get to see because these letters that are written here poor sister s a sister down here in in Trinidad writing she's pregnant and she don't know what to do should she fast and pray because she wants the Holy Ghost and don't know what to do and those kind of letters make you sick you don't know what to do with those kind of letters and all around the world they're doing all kind of crazy inan things and all the time it's the word if some Minister would only preach the word to them then otherwise then if they here's what the devil has done he's come and brought the tapes and the books and tell them everybody's all right just believe the message and and you got the Holy Ghost then those poor people without the Holy Ghost go out and the devil slays them but if they only knew that they had a promise they say back up Satan I got a promise god promise Satan and I'm going to receive the Holy Ghost now one the man to tell them that they're afraid to cuz if they tell them that then they're going to split up the church those these big intellectual dignitaries are sitting there they ain't looking for the Holy Ghost they they in the message now you know I'm telling you the truth I ain't going to say this no more I'm telling you this morning so you'll know what has happened in the message but God that come fresh to me brother charity never faileth human virtues all seven will fail without charity if someone has the Holy Ghost they have added added added added added now catch what I mean if there's been a now there are Holy Ghost people around but if they didn't have the Revelation under the seventh seal actually what it is like in a church but if that you can find a place where that has the Revelation and has people there with the Holy Ghost then they have added the god-given virtues amen you got it then what they have done they have actually brought in his life his blood his Spirit through the sword the word yeah cuz it's been preached to them then Divine love is the outer garment which is to come to unite all and bind it all as one this is True Perfection giving you seven living virtues the secret brings the bride to the end of herself the word shows her how to get herself out of the way by washing her from dead forms ideas ability works of the flesh Commandments of men Church government the whole thing do you realize that God has given us this great secret Malachi for that he had a secret how to get out of the way he got himself out of the way that's right then here by Revelation the sword cut everyone of ourselves the ribbons King AAG yes I preached it out there and but I preached here it was like sh a little softer amen but I there like that see but here one here and one over there see do you understand what I'm saying you have received the Revelation how to get yourself out of the way by the word slinging you the word I see sling bodies laying all over here but then if you're slain amen he can Quicken you and raise you up by the Holy Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord dead in Christ World Gone amen and slain out before the Lord can you slain bodies live prophesy amen praise God I can feel the spirit coming from the Four Winds to come up on these bones sitting up here with sen you on them but God gave you a revelation how to put on sen you how to put on flesh through the word the word the word has done it amen so therefore God has given us the the the secret amen how to get out of the way and it's the word under the seventh seal and many are waiting for all these things that they waiting for and is sitting in flesh and you don't dare preach on no flesh not in this message you better have the seventh seal on the spot with you outside of here yes sir now uh God is wanting to descend this morning because he sees the blood nature which has been which has brought us into his presence Now 1 Corinthians 13 I'm finishing up here now sister naine I Paul said that with all the Mysteries and all I could do it myself I'm nothing without charity therefore the blood word sword sacrifice has been added to our faith the seed and brings us into God's presence and this is that great mystery upon that seven seal and charity controls Seven Virtues and gives strength to it Perfection partial knowledge Three Graces and the the loose hands are gathered up in the six seals and superseded by the seventh seal and revealed and given out as a message to be poured into the Bride As the word of God knowledge of the Son of God bringing a completeness of communication is Christ himself love no more tongues no more gifts and no more knowing in part amen if we know in part Baptist Methodist and so forth Pentecostal that's in part amen but he which is perfect is come a perfect knowledge of the perfect word is here with a revelation imperfection adding to our faith amen then Christ in the fullness in Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost they had spoken tongues for themselves amen but when it come to preaching and laying down the word that there was no tongues then Christ was there in the fullness in Peter communicating to his people through one language Galilean amen now the Mexican girl here in brother br's meeting here she spoke Spanish no English and while brother brandham quoted from the vision she understood everything he said for Christ was there communicating he which is perfect was there from the vision so t and knowledge in part shall be superseded by the more complete perfect knowledge by means by means of divine love communication praise God Divine love there'll be no mimics to that there'll be no impersonation to the third pull going forth in the bride it'll be Christ in the bride do you love him do you understand friends what I trust and pray to God to do understand what was preach to you this morning maybe you didn't get it all that's all right but let me say this to you that uh the mystery of what God was trying to do he was just to break it down to you simply he was trying to get the preeminence in his people now the devil hates this Revelation you see man I knew that for for even coming here see all week long see but therefore if I could say it to you this way God has given us here a revelation here Jacob Grace Joseph Perfection and I don't even want to say it no more cuz I feel that we have reached the time and went out here to Tucson and preaching on the absolute on the Sunday morning January 20th brother Perry Green's father he's a dreamer and he's the one that because dream because about brother brandom going back to Jack Moore's Church in shreport ' 65 he came out told me said brother Coman that shuck was completely dry and he says 2/3 walked out and I said my then there was a sign to me that the seed if the shuck is dry then the last life has left the Shook and is in the seed then if the last life has left the Shook and is in the seed then the last bit of greenness has left the seed and has turned golden Brown I hope you got that that was the dream that was spoken to me after a hard message I had to preach and the other was brother Fred Barker brother brand told him because he's paralyzed down the side and he's the song leader and brother Bram told him in 65 I don't have a word of the Lord for you he said but one day you'll speak the right word and say the right thing and you'll be healed and that night I told the two son tabernac I said my God you got a blessing of God sitting right here you got a sign of the third pole and I spoke about because because sister com's eye also I says right here I says the the mighty intelligence the Dynamics of God is wanting to come down and give us the mind of Christ what to say the right thing and do the right thing and if we have already received the Revelation this morning we've been doing the right thing by the word amen I hope you get now other words this is doing other words the secret is knowing what to do and what to say so he moved the mind of Christ into the bride the word which tells us what to do and tells us what to say and how to walk and how to live and how to talk amen and we've been doing it on inspiration for the last 10 years just doing the right thing keep on doing it keep on doing it then one day like sister hady right you'll say the right thing that's nothing but the truth and if you can speak that this morning that this message is nothing but the truth then the inspiration can move around oh God this morning is wanting to move upon his people he's looking for a people that believes the word in it Simplicity that won't tense up and and try to figure it out just believe the word as it has been spoken the wisdom of it being this mystery and a three-fold purpose of God then the mighty Dynamics can move in and drop in on his people and make us speak the right things praise our God and then you'll see a perfect communication go forth it'll be perfect I believe it with all my heart amen I believe that it'll come on the wings of a snow white dove you believe that friends I want to read something to you as she picks up that key there wings of a snow white DB i w let you go I told you that brother brand preached this message events made clear by by prophecy he said friends this is Def fulfillment that's page 41 this is the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 St Luke 17:30 St John Revelation 10 prophecies then he went on he made him stand he said pledged by the the brandom Tabernacle now with one Accord let's stand and say I now accept Jesus Christ as Savior and and Al healer and by his grace from this hour henceforth oh God let no unbelief ever into my heart for I have seen the prophecy of this day fulfilled I believe that Jesus Christ is alive and here now confirming his word of this hour the prophecies that was written of him has now been fulfilled in our midst he is my savior my god king my all and all dear God hear our testimony and give to us day by day the bread of life and we will offer thee Praise of God from the depth of our heart we praise thee the mighty one the god of the prophets in Jesus Christ's name amen then he made him sing now I believe I wonder is that your testimony this this morning I wonder if you believe this Revelation that has gone forth in New York City I I wonder if you believe it's been from God cuz I myself feel it's all over with I feel it's finished with it's done and it's been spoken and I do not intend I hope not to have to come back to refer back to my person or anything like that there for that's to me it's over with it's finished with all I'm waiting for now is a sign on the wings of a snow white do so all I'm waiting for now and I know that a message like of this timee is a rough one to bring because God's got to reveal it and so therefore though you try to tell the people don't strain and don't try to press see if you could only be thanking God for what has been revealed this morning I don't know praise God but uh nevertheless God has spoken and so therefore that is the message of God and what he his purpose purp was Wednesday night the previous Wednesday it was God overpowering whenever that Catholic Church just mentioned the Holy Spirit comes down and just overpowers every Spirit out here and not even being in my mind that that just like this you see and then on the battlefield Sunday morning then coming back Wednesday the you were coming into it you entered into it see so you got blessed is as you enter into it you will get blessed this morning trying to teach you what it has been and in doing this here many always compare what they were doing then the the self uh uh judgment comes in and that's where he goes just like it's here and you feel it drop the bottom Fallout and see but nevertheless um the hour has come and I believe with all my heart the shook is just about dry the seeds are mature according what he gave me on Mount Camelback I know you don't understand it it has to do with finally accepting the will of God that's all it means you mature you're ready for the principles of the kingdom of God to flow through you the principles the word here in New York City has cleaned out every Spirit moved it out of you that's what it's been for moved it out of you wash it cleanse it that's finished with now now the mind of Christ coming on the wings of a snow white dove can move into you now I trust and pray God we've had some phenomenal out uh out you can't even uh know what to call last year you know that so what could you call last year just the Holy Spirit coming down and and raking right on through here and going out here to Tucson and seeing the mind of Christ and seeing what God did and coming here this morning not even knowing and then having that first tape but now I see and I told him in two song I said after 8 years what is your condition tonight I said but now I see do you see now then I realized what was happening and people don't even know they don't even know they never got to job 42:6 I hate myself I hate myself and that was the secret that God brought the word into us to strip us of self that's the secret that we and Bram had for all those years so simple and so humble I hope you got it self was stripped in New York through the revelation of the word self was killed by the Divine Undertaker amen amen that's what it's been that's all it is sister that's all that is brother that's that's the great Revelation this morning God has come in through the word and stripped us and now brother BR what we need on perfect weakness is empty vessels God give us empty vessels that have emptied out themselves no ability no mind no reasoning no imagination no nothing just sitting not trying to strain and push and feel what I'm what am I talking about this morning should go out of here the happiest people in the world this morning should go out of here under the power of God realizing what God has revealed to you this morning I tell you but I know one thing on the wings of a snow why D God s his pure Sweet Love A sa from above on the wings of shall we stand [Music] no on the floods many [Music] days he search for in barious [Music] way trou he had some but not from above God gave him a s on the wings of on the wings of a snow why God send his pure Sweet Love F from above on the wings of Jesus I say think on him came to Earth one day he was born in a St on the manger of him though here rejected but not from above gave us a son on the wings of a this was God's Prophet though I have suffered in many a way I cry for healing both night and day Faith was in [Applause] forgot by the father of he gave me a son on the wings of the D let's worship him on the wings of a snow God send his pure Sweet Love A S from [Applause] above on the wings of as our sister keeps playing just think amen God gave Noah a sign gave Christ a sign gave William brandom a sign the message this morning meaning that he's going to send us a sign on the wings of a dove what's that sign brother Coleman that's all over with it's finished all over with return back that second time said behold Thou Art made whole just relaxing praise God moving into a feeling and knowing that is finished with and realizing that present tense salvation under the seventh seal the mystery hidden from the ages the word the secret made known just a plain word God knowing that the human Great Mighty intellect second Timothy 3 hey High minded could impersonate those seven virtues so he hid it and just said it's the word and knowing that those seven those senses those five senses couldn't know that it's just the word so they had to to like come out with all kind of strange ideas and doctrines and then when that bride has held to the word then God comes back around and drops the Holy Ghost upon those Lambs that have added to their nature the blood sacrifice the word of God we are here and I I know we are oh praise God on the wings of a snow let's take one another's hands God send his pure Sweet Love A same [Applause] from on the wings of a that's it all on the wings of a snow [Music] why God sends his pure Sweet Love A S from above on the wings of praise His name every head bowed on the wings of a snow white dove the message has gone forth I know it's the truth the enemies howling and scowling but God's going to vindicate it on the sign on the wings of a dove he's going to send it I know that for the word of God has been preached here and he'll vindicate his word but just had to bring this thought to you this morning tying it into to you bring it out my simple thought was that them people typing out Christ in the Old Testament under them Seven Seals didn't know exactly what they were doing they were being led by the spirit of God and that's all it was under the seventh seal being led by the spirit word anointing and doing it and letting God come in and have the preeminence to clean us up through the washing of the Water by the word and now we stand here different dreams and things happening and manifestations and realizing that the mechanics has gone forth and to perfectly prove it to you Christ is revealing his own Jesus Christ on our hands he says you are not supposed to know the mechanics then he comes back around and says you're only supposed to know the Dynamics the pul ating of it so I understand what's going on this morning but praise God there been a revelation to bring out these mechanics and to explain it to you and the devil hates that but it's it has is finished to me it's over with and I'm looking for Jesus Christ the dove to come and prove it on the spot to smash the individuals in the forehead it'll never be a group it'll be is an individual love affair with Jesus Christ so don't look for a group but there was a place in New York City by the grace of God that this Revelation was preached in and so I trust and pray it's been wonderful the past years it's been wonderful knowing that God has put uh to me some of the cream of the crop together that we could come in here and fellowship like this here and take this word of God and let me exalt you here this morning if you love God and you are predestinated unto the adoption you're going to receive the Holy Ghost you're going to know what it's all about only want you to believe it and to relax you come back wsy come back relaxed God's going to fulfill every bit of his word is already moving and I'm just looking for it to come anytime when the prophet of God spoke this message message here he says the second pull was finished the third pull was at hand and so I'm trying to by faith step forward and I feel that this portion is finished and I feel that what we're looking for is at hand the manifestation of Christ in the bride so here we are praise the Lord so the Lord bless you the Lord be with you it's long but uh I felt it's up on my heart to get it off and so therefore it's the children's bread and let us come back now uh Wednesday night and but now I see and I'm looking for the five God to fall and oh that's what he meant praise the Lord Brother Kurt may the Lord bless you
