[3:39] today but uh so I'm here on a wing in a
[3:43] prayer cuz I'm quite tired amen quite
[3:47] worn
[3:49] out but I just felt that I couldn't with
[3:53] the meetings being Supernatural the way
[3:56] they
[3:57] were I didn't know how many messages I
[4:01] preached I got all I must have preached
[4:04] about four messages I was only trying to
[4:06] preach two amen I don't feel that I
[4:10] really said what I wanted to say on one
[4:13] of the inspiration the lord gave me you
[4:14] may be seated so about Tuesday I kept
[4:19] hearing put on the whole arm of God and
[4:23] it come to me Tuesday Wednesday I didn't
[4:25] know what I said well I did get into it
[4:27] it was my subject over there
[4:30] and Joanne had a song uh to take the
[4:32] sword of the spirit that was supposed to
[4:35] be sang with it but anyway uh I waited
[4:40] until last night and be sure I was just
[4:42] too tired and so he says no you finish
[4:45] up cuz I'm going to take a long rest so
[4:48] you're not going to see me for a while
[4:51] but I wanted to leave you with an
[4:55] understanding that you understand that
[4:58] you are on the third
[5:01] [Applause]
[5:03] phase and there's no more that I can do
[5:06] at this time only the dove can lead the
[5:12] eag so I can't do no
[5:15] more it's time for you to cause a
[5:20] Revival in your life in your home the
[5:23] ministers cannot do
[5:26] it
[5:28] amen so with that understanding a few
[5:31] words we have some visitors here all
[5:34] right just a few moments now and now
[5:37] here's where you're going
[5:38] to understand what took place amen so
[5:42] you thank God for the pen Harris meeting
[5:45] you know it was
[5:47] Supernatural the anointing is still with
[5:51] you okay I believe on June 7th I read
[5:56] this to you I feel led to reread it
[5:59] again and it came to me on May 6th this
[6:02] year but I read it on May June 7th and
[6:05] this is a quote that the Lord just told
[6:07] me to write the third pull was here as
[6:11] the original faith we had to contend
[6:16] earnestly for the faith once delivered
[6:20] and restored back by Malachi 4 through
[6:24] the first phase and the second phase and
[6:29] now
[6:30] as we reach our third phase place in
[6:34] Christ come and rejoice with
[6:37] us we actually
[6:40] connect with Malachi 4's thirdd
[6:45] pool catch it now which is the original
[6:48] Apostolic Faith with signs and wonders
[6:52] and miracles and outpouring of the Holy
[6:54] Ghost amen that what that's what lays on
[6:57] the third poor amen so the day that we
[7:01] strength that third phase ours and I
[7:05] believe it's today which was June 7th uh
[7:09] uh it immediately connects right into
[7:12] Malachi 43r poll the opening of the word
[7:17] amen and then watch we are back to the
[7:22] word and the
[7:24] spirit cuz the spirit comes on the third
[7:27] phas
[7:31] so you see all these years you've been
[7:32] waiting you had the way you come down to
[7:36] this
[7:38] amen reference the spoken word is
[7:42] Original
[7:43] Seed this will be pre Now watch how it's
[7:46] going to be preached this will be
[7:48] preached as the revelation of the son of
[7:52] man making you ready for the
[7:56] Rapture by the Perfection of the son of
[7:59] man
[8:00] which will make you ready
[8:03] unquote amen so I'll read it again today
[8:07] so you don't miss it and you come back
[8:09] and you know where you are I believe
[8:11] that June 7th started it with it because
[8:15] earnestly contending for the faith
[8:17] restored back by Malachi 4 and we
[8:21] actually hit it on June 14th the voice
[8:25] of the
[8:26] Archangel amen for when omnipotent
[8:29] speaks the miraculous does take
[8:33] place so you see how this must tie
[8:37] in amen and we got evidence right in the

[26:06] phase we actually connect with Malachi
[26:09] 4's third pull which is the original
[26:11] Apostolic Faith which signs wers and
[26:14] miracles and outpouring of the Holy
[26:16] Spirit did we have it did the Holy
[26:19] Spirit pour out June uh December 29th
[26:22] did you see the dead raised the miracles
[26:26] happen well then we have entered into to
[26:28] the third pool the opening of the
[26:31] word oh
[26:34] Hallelujah for when omnipotent speaks
[26:37] the miraculous does take
[26:39] place you may be seated and Malachi 4
[26:43] third pull is the opening of the word
[26:45] and then that means from this day on
[26:48] back to the Bible why we in another
[26:53] Ephesians we are
[26:55] here hallelujah that's how you know
[27:00] did you get it I'll tell it to you again
[27:03] and what another Ephesians does may be
[27:05] seated One Faith one Lord one baptism
[27:10] one God one father a perfect man a
[27:14] perfect
[27:16] church is that
[27:18] correct now your face should be nailed
[27:21] down that's what I'm doing now for the
[27:23] rest of this summer she have no more
[27:24] mind battles you should know you're on
[27:26] the third phase
[27:30] and I don't have to be here the the dove
[27:31] is here the same one that's down at Pin
[27:34] Harris he's
[27:36] here amen you may be
[27:39] seated and here's how it happened June
[27:42] 7th earnestly contending for the faith
[27:44] restored back by Malachi 4 the Holy
[27:48] Spirit told me that he said in all these
[27:51] years he said you've been preaching the
[27:53] faith since 1963 your brother hun right
[27:56] here the devil was raised twice you see
[28:00] brother oiki dead was raised a long time
[28:02] ago signs and wonders and miracles was
[28:04] done here long time
[28:08] ago he told me but I wouldn't let you
[28:11] say it cuz then they would think you
[28:14] point to
[28:16] yourself so I never said it until June
[28:20] 7th
[28:22] 1992 what is that patience
[28:25] [Applause]
[28:30] H so now he tolds he told me so now when
[28:34] you bring it back to the faith he said
[28:36] then that will open up the word cuz
[28:39] it'll put it into Ephesians then the
[28:42] faith is the opening of the
[28:45] word amen and to prove back to you one
[28:48] more time to put on this tape so to be
[28:51] here you go back to it uh the tape was
[28:54] uh 53
[28:56] 6148 earnestly for the faith that was
[28:59] once delivered to the Saints this is
[29:01] what was my inspiration in pen Harris I
[29:03] didn't use it here on June 7th because
[29:05] here I had to tie the faith into the
[29:09] intelligence into the mind of Christ the
[29:13] last moving
[29:15] faculty but I couldn't do that in pin
[29:18] Harris they might get funny so who who
[29:21] who is he what's he talking about the
[29:23] the intelligence so I did that here I
[29:26] don't do everything out there that I do
[29:27] here here like the voice of the
[29:30] Archangel that's that's not for them
[29:32] that's for
[29:34] [Music]
[29:35] him amen see that there
[29:39] now so I just you know a little form
[29:42] here and there and hit it you know it's
[29:45] okay about 5 minutes here the book of
[29:46] Jud was written ad 66 33 years after
[29:49] Pentecost he was the fcer brother of
[29:51] Jesus Christ Jew was a prophet he was
[29:54] foretelling here and connecting the
[29:56] church and was written to all the
[29:57] churches throughout the age and I

[43:20] done the same things after he rose from
[43:22] the dead through the apostles that he
[43:24] did before he died even greater more of
[43:27] it yet he said a little while the world
[43:30] seeth me no more yet ye shall see me the
[43:32] church the the believer for I'll be with
[43:35] you even in you to the end of the
[43:40] world and how you going to do that then

[44:33] vine ye are the branches and if we the
[44:35] branches in the the vine the branch will
[44:38] bear the same kind of fruit that the
[44:40] vine produces to it when the first Vine
[44:43] come forth the first branch that come
[44:45] out of the vine was a Pentecostal Branch
[44:48] Visions Powers healings baptism of the
[44:52] Holy Spirit great signs and wonders the
[44:55] next branch will have to be the same
[44:58] kind of a branch on down to the end
[45:01] it'll have to be the same that's what
[45:03] Jesus said and that's what you're going
[45:06] to see and you're already beginning to
[45:09] see
[45:12] it yes sir amen okay let me hurry up and
[45:17] finish up right here now now now you
[45:20] know how you're going to see them and
[45:21] you're already seeing him then you know
[45:24] he's here then the faith is here
[45:28] the resurrection faith is
[45:32] him amen now that was what the apostles
[45:36] believe and they believe that what he
[45:38] was in the flesh he was also and more in
[45:41] the spirit and that's what they taught
[45:43] that's what they believe and that's what
[45:45] they practiced and that's what God
[45:47] confirmed and on June 7 I put this into
[45:50] my church here you remember that I said
[45:53] I'm placing signs and wonders and
[45:55] miracles in this church
[45:57] how many remember that Apostolic time I
[46:00] put it in here positionally put it in
[46:03] here and it
[46:06] happened yes
[46:09] amen yes
[46:12] sir that's what they practice that's
[46:14] what God confirmed and that's what was
[46:17] Malachi for restored back to this
[46:19] bride but during this time it's 33 years
[46:22] lapse that uh there became many false
[46:24] Brethren that was raised up and gone
[46:26] into heresies same thing happened again
[46:28] since 1965 and brought people into
[46:31] Theology and different things like that
[46:34] and Paul I think him laying I'm cutting
[46:35] a little bit short here let's contend
[46:37] for the faith the true faith that once
[46:39] was delivered to the Saints the Saints
[46:41] believe in the death Buri and
[46:42] Resurrection they believe in the baptism
[46:44] of the spirit the early Church believe
[46:46] it you you believe it then let's contend
[46:48] for it now they believed in signs and
[46:50] wonders following the believer now as
[46:52] they begin to Fall Away Jews said men of
[46:54] old was foreordained to do this now God
[46:57] is
[46:58] soling God knows who would do this and
[47:01] he's speaking back with Pharaoh Moses
[47:02] Jans and jamri it comes on down how
[47:04] marvelous earnestly continue forth the
[47:07] faith that was once delivered to the
[47:09] Saints all back in the age now the very
[47:11] faith that they had at to beginning
[47:13] supposed to be
[47:14] today this gospel is preached then Jesus
[47:17] shall return St Matthew 24:14 act8 1
[47:21] Corinthians 4:20 that's why he gave me
[47:23] those scriptures amen demonstrate the
[47:26] power of God to every creature in now
[47:29] watch in order to preach the gospel
[47:31] before you could make it a gospel
[47:34] preached remember in pin Harris then
[47:37] You' have got to have the power and
[47:40] demonstration of the Holy Spirit to
[47:41] prove the gospel now how many have
[47:44] preached the
[47:46] gospel how many ministers in this mess
[47:48] have preached the gospel amen before
[47:50] they can preach it they got to have
[47:51] demonstration of spirit and power
[47:55] raising of the dead and signs and wers
[47:57] and miracles so have they preached it
[47:58] yet that's why it says there's a third
[48:02] phase the third phase will vindicate the
[48:05] first
[48:06] Faith
[48:08] amen hallelujah and they laughed and
[48:12] they mocked and they SC said what's he
[48:14] talking about I know what I'm talking
[48:16] about the faith praise
[48:20] God you may be
[48:22] seated in order to preach the gospel
[48:25] before you can make it a gospel preacher
[48:27] you can't call the this the gospel if
[48:29] there's nothing happening you just
[48:31] quoting some
[48:33] quotes but where's the gospel the gospel
[48:36] is to demonstrate the power of God
[48:39] that's the
[48:42] gospel oh let me hurry up here in order
[48:46] to preach the gospel before you can make
[48:47] it a gospel preach you got to have the
[48:48] power and demonstration of the Holy
[48:50] Spirit to prove the gospel the letter
[48:52] killer the spirit make it Al liive so
[48:54] it's not just so ralistic
[48:57] a a r ritualistic Affair was it's
[49:01] absolutely a real living reality of the
[49:03] resurrection of Jesus Christ living
[49:05] among men and that's the faith I'm
[49:09] trying my best to contend for today and
[49:12] the prophet was sent out with three
[49:14] pulls to contend for this faith and he
[49:17] brought it back to that faith and he
[49:19] started listen he didn't come out with
[49:22] just reading the Bible he came out with
[49:24] signs and wonders and miracles he came
[49:26] out with gift he could turn his head and
[49:29] say what's behind him he demonstrated
[49:31] the Holy
[49:33] Spirit then he come down to that third
[49:36] pull and He restored back the
[49:41] faith amen may be
[49:45] seated that he said I'm trying my best
[49:48] to contend for today that Jesus Christ
[49:50] is the same yesterday today and forever
[49:52] and his power is unlimited so I do not
[49:55] limit the power of God to high you feel
[49:59] today I preach the word of
[50:03] God half you come in here some come in
[50:06] here sleepy some come in here mad some
[50:09] come in here mean I don't limit to God
[50:12] limit God the way you feel or what
[50:15] happened in your
[50:16] house
[50:18] no no way preach the word of
[50:24] God Amen
[50:29] amen power is unlimited how marvelous
[50:33] how that God has done this for this
[50:35] today oh I ain't going to go a whole
[50:37] hour all right I'll finish it you must
[50:40] have a living faith Born Again faith I
[50:44] found a people with a living faith
[50:46] talking about Pentecostals where they
[50:47] have absolutely caught a hold of
[50:49] something God out there gives him a new
[50:51] birth that puts God into the person
[50:53] makes him believe in the Supernatural
[50:56] now if you're not born again you do not
[50:58] believe in the Supernatural if you do
[51:00] not believe in the Supernatural you have
[51:02] not been born again because you were
[51:05] born again you become a Son of God when
[51:07] you are and being a Son of God you are a
[51:10] nature of God and you take on the things
[51:14] and you want to see the moving of God
[51:17] and you want to see God move because you
[51:19] are his son and you are made in His
[51:22] image and you are born of his spirit
[51:26] you a part of him then you got faith for
[51:34] anything
[51:37] Hallelujah may be seated notice from the
[51:40] beginning Satan has been so close is
[51:42] religious people back to the Garden of
[51:44] Eden continued baac fundamental
[51:46] Believers 2 Timothy 13 1-8 quote having
[51:50] a form of God but they deny the power
[51:52] thereof then brother Brown's getting
[51:53] anointed Hallelujah he said there is any
[51:56] beginning there's in the Middle Ages and
[51:58] there's that same group of fundamental
[52:00] Believers that put Jesus on the cross
[52:01] and killed him because he had signs and
[52:03] wonders they didn't believe it that same
[52:05] Spirit lives among the churches today
[52:08] and it lives in this message today a
[52:10] religious people not a bunch of infidels
[52:12] fundamentalists place it right out there
[52:15] exactly and they have the form of
[52:17] godliness fundamentally right but
[52:19] denying the power there of the power of
[52:21] God the power of healing the power of
[52:23] shouting the power speaking in tongues
[52:25] the power interpretation the power of
[52:27] God
[52:28] moving just like in the beginning and
[52:31] brother sister We are continuing for the
[52:33] faith that was once delivered to the
[52:35] Saints Hallelujah you believe it
[52:37] continue for the faith and about that
[52:39] time the people started shouting and he
[52:41] said you think this is a noisy Bunch if
[52:43] there ain't no noise there ain't no God

[54:41] the book come out later so
[54:45] hallelujah
[54:46] [Music]
[54:48] amen so the faith is the opening of the
[54:51] word amen and then uh uh no noise no God
[54:57] and uh then July 3rd the Seven Seals of
[55:00] redemption is Ephesians that Ephesians
[55:02] made made manifest and that closes it
[55:05] out once we get back to Ephesians then
[55:08] it's over we're here we're back to the
[55:11] Bible then we can read from Ephesians
[55:14] and all scripture is given by
[55:16] inspiration for reproof for instruction
[55:19] for correction then that means that I
[55:22] can correct you by the word
[55:27] [Applause]
[55:29] huh sister brother I can sit you down in
[55:32] the room say now according to the word
[55:35] you're not walking
[55:38] right I couldn't do that for the last 5
[55:41] years that's why I didn't
[55:44] bother amen but we're here now okay
[55:48] praise the
[55:50] Lord I'm still uh I don't know whether I
[55:53] should maybe just finish off right
[55:55] here why not amen praise God I'm trying
[55:59] to nail this thing down here okay on a a
[56:03] paradox and I was reading there from
[56:04] page 19 and's speaking about all
[56:07] scriptures got to be fulfilled and now
[56:09] friends I believe that he's the same
[56:10] yesterday today and forever I believe he
[56:12] just is able this afternoon to cause in
[56:15] this building of paradox because that he
[56:17] promised it would happen how much more
[56:20] has he promised how much more is it uh
[56:23] leaning in the Bible to this very age
[56:26] that we're living in Ephesians again of
[56:29] the church ages we got seven Church ages
[56:32] and we promis that at the layout of cing
[56:34] church age are we here well at that time
[56:38] not Philadelphia saw this no le out AA
[56:42] we promis when that strikes then there
[56:45] would be another
[56:47] Ephesians
[56:49] oh we're here another
[56:54] Ephesians amen amen that's right and
[56:58] what may be seated and we are here I
[57:02] believe with all my heart the Jesus
[57:05] Christ who made the promise oh brother
[57:08] go what what what can you say
[57:11] brother we in Ephesians man yes sir I'm
[57:15] just bringing this back so you get it
[57:17] amen page 26 here
[57:21] amen uh page 26 here it says here uh now
[57:26] if he'll uh uh oh yeah he he was getting
[57:29] ready to do the discernment then he says
[57:32] Paradox now if he'll do that for you
[57:35] between you and I talking about
[57:37] discernment see uh uh see so that uh so
[57:41] that the audience not for show but that
[57:44] they might see the Ephesus is here so
[57:47] brother Bram call discernment
[57:51] Ephesus he called the healing Ephesus
[57:57] yes do you
[58:00] understand
[58:03] oh Hallelujah that Ephesus is here when
[58:07] he would say John Jones then they all
[58:09] would know as
[58:11] [Applause]
[58:14] Ephesus
[58:17] Ephesians
[58:19] see that this is the thing that Bridges
[58:22] between denomination lead AA and the
[58:25] glory land he promises that they might
[58:28] be assured that what we telling is the
[58:31] truth how many believe it to be the
[58:33] truth the congregation says amen sure he
[58:36] know every time he bad an eye he's
[58:38] infinite God just think by his grace he
[58:40] has presented with his gospel the same
[58:42] thing he promised to do then there's a
[58:44] heaven and we're going to it and we're
[58:46] in this Ephesus right now we in this
[58:50] coming out of one and into
[58:52] another Hallelujah do you believe it
[58:58] so I conclude that another emphasis is
[59:04] here I say our third phase has hooked
[59:09] into Malachi for third pull the opening
[59:13] of the word which is
[59:15] Ephesus and in Ephesus the faith will be
[59:20] preached signs wonders Miracles adoption
[59:25] prophetic
[59:30] my
[59:33] my
[59:35] Hallelujah may be seated the Seven Seals
[59:38] of redemption is that Ephesians made
[59:41] manifest for when omnipotence speaks the
[59:43] miraculous does take place now how many
[59:45] of them can figure that one out the
[59:48] third you mean the Seven Seals seven THS
[59:50] is is that is uh is that that's the
[59:53] Ephesians they don't understand that
[59:55] they never will amen well praise God
[59:59] I'll try to go a little bit okay it
[1:00:02] won't be long

[1:03:51] of the world uh that we should be holy
[1:03:55] and without blame before him in love
[1:03:58] having predestinated us unto the
[1:03:59] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to

[1:04:20] flesh and blood but against

[1:05:00] may God a blessing the read of his word
[1:05:02] hallelujah shall we bow our heads our
[1:05:03] heavenly father you told me to take time
[1:05:06] to nail down the faith Amen on the third
[1:05:08] phase I believe it's been done I don't
[1:05:10] have much strength Lord he told me to
[1:05:13] say for a few moments uh Ephesian that I
[1:05:15] must start it here on the third phase in
[1:05:19] Ephesians almighty God they're a little
[1:05:21] weary and tired now so sweep their tiess
[1:05:24] off of them ignite their souls with
[1:05:27] fire amen and open the visitors

[1:06:30] Ephesians 3:20 now unto him that's able
[1:06:32] to do exceeding abundantly above all
[1:06:36] that we ask or think according to the
[1:06:40] power that worketh in us hallelujah in
[1:06:44] Ephesians
[1:06:46] amen now if we are on the third face
[1:06:50] Hallelujah glory to
[1:06:54] God praise praise God if we are on the
[1:06:58] third phase uh uh if we are on the third
[1:07:03] phase place in Christ and the Dynamics
[1:07:06] are
[1:07:07] here and Pen Harris meeting proved this
[1:07:10] along with the five evidences correct
[1:07:14] then let's earnestly contend for the
[1:07:17] faith that rest restored back by Malachi
[1:07:20] 4 and let's put on the whole arm of god
[1:07:23] let's stop playing around praise God and
[1:07:26] put it on because it's
[1:07:29] here now couple of questions you may be
[1:07:32] seated what is the whole arm of God and
[1:07:34] what is the arm of God made out of Amen
[1:07:39] now uh uh What uh we are what a blessed
[1:07:43] privilege we have as ministers and
[1:07:47] Believers to stand as Caleb's and
[1:07:52] joshuas until we claim our inheritance
[1:07:56] from here
[1:07:57] on hallelujah we're blessed oh we
[1:08:01] blessed we're blessed we blessed we're
[1:08:03] blessed yes
[1:08:05] sir now on Paradox amen 19665 page 16
[1:08:10] and if any man had believes God and
[1:08:12] takes him at his word that's anyone of
[1:08:14] you in here no matter what the situation
[1:08:17] is I don't care what happened in your
[1:08:19] home what's going on there whether you
[1:08:22] don't have the Holy Ghost now I'm
[1:08:24] talking about today
[1:08:25] [Music]
[1:08:27] today amen what the situation is God
[1:08:31] will perform another paradx to keep his
[1:08:37] word God gave his word to Abraham take
[1:08:41] your son up there and and and he said
[1:08:44] slay him amen that correct and then
[1:08:47] Abraham got there was ready to slay him
[1:08:49] and God calls a
[1:08:51] paradox because Abraham has said I in
[1:08:54] the land will
[1:08:57] return and it was nothing so Abraham
[1:09:00] said God can do it hold your hand
[1:09:04] Abraham there's a ram in the bush so God
[1:09:08] caused a paradox put a lamb in a bush to
[1:09:11] keep his word that Abraham and his son
[1:09:14] would
[1:09:17] return I lose none and God can cause a
[1:09:21] paradox to here and baptize you with the
[1:09:24] Holy Ghost in fire
[1:09:27] Hallelujah I don't care what you what
[1:09:29] happened to you
[1:09:31] amen you may be seated what about Joshua
[1:09:35] page 17 here's Joshua we speaking of how
[1:09:38] that that man amen just an ordinary man
[1:09:41] that just come through a group of Creeds
[1:09:43] that the man had formed laws and
[1:09:45] ceremonies with nothing in them that
[1:09:47] said nothing anything about man power to
[1:09:50] stop the Sun but here with a commission
[1:09:52] from God and we do have a commission St
[1:09:55] Mark
[1:09:56] 16 amen praise
[1:09:59] amen amen commission from God uh I'll
[1:10:04] give you uh uh I'll give you every place
[1:10:06] at the sound of the soul of your feet
[1:10:08] sets upon I'll be there and the enemy
[1:10:10] was rounded the sun was going down if
[1:10:13] them Kings had time to get themselves
[1:10:15] together again the next day and what
[1:10:17] about our day the sunlit message is
[1:10:20] going down 28 years is up and these
[1:10:24] false anointed can
[1:10:26] regroup huh they'll get the people all
[1:10:29] over again so the Hours come Sun stand
[1:10:34] still Moon hang over angelon until we
[1:10:38] kill the rest of them praise God with
[1:10:41] the word of God Amen you may be seated
[1:10:46] he looked up to the Sun and said stand
[1:10:47] over gibon and the moon standing over
[1:10:50] angelon for the space of a whole day
[1:10:52] that was all night long the sun Stood
[1:10:54] Still the moon stood there that's a
[1:10:56] paradox now watch a man walking in the
[1:11:00] will of God could do such a thing for he
[1:11:03] was watch he was again in an
[1:11:08] Ephesus hallelujah praise God and
[1:11:12] Ephesians
[1:11:14] Amen in and Ephesians watch with the
[1:11:21] gospel oh my you get
