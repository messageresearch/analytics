[2:00] april 2 april 6th
[2:02] i've been very strange season been sick
[2:05] and weary and
[2:06] then uh remodeling my house and my wife
[2:09] and i have been staying over to
[2:10] jonathan's house for almost two months
[2:12] now
[2:13] just back and forth and so much stress
[2:15] and everything and remodeling and going
[2:17] back and forth and very tired and no
[2:19] time to study or whatever and didn't
[2:22] exactly know what i was going to do and
[2:24] but uh on april 4th the lord spoke to me
[2:28] and um
[2:29] and told me gave me the message then
[2:31] came jesus after easter
[2:34] and then i still didn't know what i was
[2:36] doing just moving by faith
[2:38] in april the sixth on saturday uh he
[2:40] spoke to me twice in the morning
[2:43] the seven thunders are the seven virtues
[2:45] of the seven church ages
[2:47] and then it came in my heart i said well
[2:49] now i know that i said well what uh
[2:51] does that does it mean something else
[2:54] and then he says
[2:55] and to brotherly kindness add charity
[2:58] for june 9th
[3:00] and i said well that's what he told me
[3:03] so i didn't know what it meant
[3:05] so
[3:06] uh
[3:07] i believe on one of the messages to know
[3:09] him from the beginning i just said those
[3:11] words
[3:12] i say i'm saying for purpose i was still
[3:14] looking for the inspiration myself
[3:18] amen
[3:19] sitting on june 9th 1974
[3:23] uh brotherly kindness
[3:25] was birthed
[3:26] into us
[3:28] or from the message and of some have
[3:29] compassion
[3:31] and from june 9 1974
[3:33] to june 9th today 1991 to 17 years
[3:37] and on june 1st
[3:40] just a week or so ago
[3:42] um
[3:44] i was wondering um
[3:46] what was i supposed to do oh
[3:48] i know what i left something out on may
[3:51] was it may 11th
[3:53] i just still didn't know what i was well
[3:56] supposed to preach
[3:57] and saturday morning
[3:59] he told me
[4:00] temperance and he showed me i had some
[4:02] notes there and immediately i knew i had
[4:05] to preach
[4:06] patience
[4:07] and godliness
[4:09] but i couldn't figure out where was i
[4:10] supposed to preach godliness at because
[4:12] he had already told me from the 28th of
[4:15] april to june 16th that brother of blade
[4:18] and i was supposed to share eight
[4:20] sundays to set the captive free
[4:23] be a jubilee for 50 days
[4:27] so i'm hoping that some are going free
[4:30] that's what he told me amen
[4:32] that people would go free
[4:34] and so then he did that then he later he
[4:38] tells me on june 1st
[4:40] uh
[4:41] um
[4:42] you know he told me that uh uh
[4:45] that i had to speak on
[4:46] temperance and patience i couldn't
[4:48] figure out where godliness then he told
[4:50] me on wednesday june 5th
[4:53] so then on june 1st
[4:56] i was just
[4:58] meditating like and
[5:00] the holy spirit spoke to me
[5:02] and told me to add
[5:04] another message
[5:06] i said add another message
[5:09] and then uh i said well i didn't think i
[5:11] had to go any further than faith on
[5:13] easter and then came jesus virtue and
[5:15] then april 28 knowledge to know him from
[5:18] the beginning so i thought i was
[5:20] finished preaching on the virtues with
[5:22] faith virtue and knowledge
[5:23] and then on may 11th and that's what he
[5:25] told me preaching on temperance come and
[5:27] dying
[5:29] so instantly i knew i had to preach on
[5:31] patience and godliness
[5:33] and june 9th he'd already told me on
[5:35] april the 6th to believe kindness their
[5:37] charity
[5:38] so
[5:39] june 1st he spoke again and said add
[5:42] another message
[5:44] i said add another message now i can
[5:47] hardly preach on wednesday and then he
[5:49] spoke back and says from the scripture
[5:51] into godliness brotherly kindness
[5:55] he says separated
[5:57] you always preach the to brotherly
[5:59] kindness at charity two or three times
[6:02] maybe and he says but that's to be
[6:04] separate so preach on broadly kindness
[6:07] friday
[6:10] and i did amen
[6:13] how i got in here i don't know but uh i
[6:15] made it then i had to
[6:17] to today get inspiration for the day
[6:20] which he'd already told me and he said
[6:22] just change a little bit into belly
[6:24] kindness
[6:25] charity just the way it says in the
[6:27] scripture
[6:29] so that's what i'm doing this morning
[6:32] amen
[6:34] soul
[6:35] and to brother uh into godliness brother
[6:37] kindness and to bloody kindness
[6:40] charity
[6:41] so he says separated and make these two
[6:43] messages thus making me preach eight
[6:46] virtues
[6:47] amen and then going from april to seven
[6:49] virtue to charity today
[6:53] so
[6:54] here we are
[6:56] so i had to preach wednesday and friday
[6:58] night to finish my course on june 7th
[7:02] amen i was finished brotherly kindness
[7:05] well praise god it's been a tremendous
[7:08] 17 years
[7:10] trying to
[7:12] take these promises praise god and
[7:15] so dave today is june 9th and i'm just
[7:18] supposed to preach on charity and you
[7:20] don't have to get all stiff and wonder
[7:22] what's going to happen because it never
[7:23] comes that way
[7:25] so you might as well enter in like you
[7:27] did wednesday and friday don't sit and
[7:29] try to squeeze and wonder what's going
[7:32] to happen how is it going to happen and
[7:34] when is it going to happen and will it
[7:35] happen to me and how will i get it and
[7:37] on and on and on and on and on just
[7:40] a time
[7:42] and enter into the anointing
[7:45] say thank you lord
[7:47] praise god but don't go there stay away
[7:50] from here
[7:51] because i don't even know myself
[7:54] so
[7:55] amen so amen
[7:57] i do not know
[7:59] i've been going by inspiration
[8:03] amen
[8:04] so i preached the seventh virtue june 7.

[8:15] seven church ages seven virtues
[8:17] brotherly kindness adoption perfection
[8:19] promises etc etc etc all promises that
[8:23] uh were supposed to keep you alive
[8:27] amen 25 years of soul praise god and
[8:30] then mainly the last 17 years
[8:33] and then the april inspiration speaking
[8:36] two times the seven thunders are the
[8:37] seven virtues of the seven church
[8:39] he did not explain this statement to me
[8:42] and i still don't quite know what he
[8:43] mean because i know what it means but
[8:44] what does he mean for it now i don't
[8:47] know
[8:48] hey i hope he'll show me today

[8:54] so maybe i will find out today why that
[8:57] was spoken to me praise god the seven
[8:59] thunders are the seven virtues of the
[9:01] seven church ages

[9:13] favored my sign here and just totally

[9:41] but i made it
[9:42] to
[9:43] june 7 amen

[16:28] we can have everything uh uh uh listed
[16:31] in the first three verses here of
[16:34] corinthians have everything in there
[16:35] praise god and though we speak with
[16:38] tongue and men and angels have not
[16:39] charity praise god i am becoming a
[16:41] sounding branch of tinkling symbol
[16:43] though i have the gift of prophecy and
[16:45] understand all mysteries though you
[16:48] understand the mystery of the rapture
[16:50] and you don't have charity it don't mean
[16:52] a thing to you
[16:53] though you understand all thunders and
[16:55] all these things it means nothing to you
[16:58] unless you have charity
[17:00] praise god
[17:02] amen
[17:04] amen do you have all faith seventh under
[17:07] faith rapture in faith and have not
[17:09] charity i am nothing
[17:11] oh praise god and though i before my
[17:14] gospel feed the poor and do i give my
[17:16] body to be burned and have not charity
[17:18] it profit me nothing
[17:20] well what we're going to do we're going
[17:22] to now therefore give me this mountain
[17:26] we're going to die out we're going to be
[17:28] born again we're going to add to our
[17:30] faith hallelujah we got no more time to
[17:33] hang around here we know what this
[17:36] message is now we have knowledge to
[17:38] understand it now praise god
[17:41] oh my would you like to have charity
[17:44] how many like to have charity in here
[17:46] praise god amen well you can it's your
[17:49] promise for this age
[17:51] is already vindicated by malachi 4
[17:55] the rapture's already vindicated
[17:57] the new city is vindicated it's not
[17:59] maybe will it be what is it the future
[18:02] home of the brand is already vindicated
[18:04] it's in your heart already it's on the
[18:06] tape spoken word books is already
[18:08] vindicated
[18:09] this promise of charity is vindicated
[18:11] already
[18:14] may be seated now remember the seven
[18:16] virtues must absolutely be birthed in
[18:18] you before charity will ever seal them
[18:22] up in you for service
[18:25] and you can you can't even get virtue
[18:27] without first being born again
[18:29] so we have seven human virtues we ain't
[18:32] talking about those now see
[18:34] and number two these seven virtues must
[18:36] be a scripturally
[18:39] proven
[18:40] to be in you they must be tested
[18:43] you know your temperaments must be
[18:45] tested your patience and so forth must
[18:47] be tested
[18:48] amen and your knowledge must be tested
[18:50] to understand who's in the message and
[18:52] what is the message
[18:54] hallelujah praise god
[18:57] amen see
[18:58] and you know one thing you know that god
[19:00] cannot fail god cannot lie
[19:02] god heals god seals
[19:04] knowledge
[19:06] amen
[19:07] now there must be birth in you before
[19:09] the holy spirit as charity can come upon
[19:12] you and seal you up
[19:14] see you add these seven virtues until
[19:17] the complete statue of christ is made
[19:19] manifest
[19:20] then the holy spirit comes upon it and
[19:23] seals it as one body
[19:25] praise god
[19:28] amen
[19:29] well hallelujah
[19:31] on the guide page 16 uh brother man say
[19:34] what about the holy ghost in the church
[19:36] he was speaking about the instinct of
[19:37] the ducks to go south and when the time
[19:40] uh uh when the cold comes they go south
[19:42] of louisiana and texas for the rights
[19:44] and so forth he said what about the holy
[19:46] ghost in the church the instinct you
[19:48] know and all the leaders from old
[19:50] formalities and creeds and things into a
[19:53] glorious
[19:54] wonderful baptism of the holy ghost
[19:58] where there is virtue knowledge patience
[20:00] and godliness in the holy spirit
[20:02] now what he's telling you
[20:04] the holy spirit himself descended from
[20:05] heaven with a shout out
[20:08] and he came in the form of mechanics and
[20:10] dynamics as promises together
[20:12] and then that was the guy
[20:14] and the prophet released that
[20:17] then that should have led us from 1966
[20:23] to virtue into knowledge and to
[20:24] temperance and to patience that god is
[20:26] in brotherly kindness and maybe today
[20:28] the holy ghost
[20:35] all 25 years and maybe today the charity
[20:38] will pour out
[20:44] because the uh the holy ghost is inside
[20:46] of the holy ghost
[20:52] he understands so his patience and all
[20:54] the rest of his inside old church that's
[20:56] what we need today that's what i am
[20:58] dedicated to on this third phase
[21:00] starting from june 9th today
[21:02] praise god
[21:05] amen so therefore the minister's
[21:07] commission and all of us is
[21:09] my commission anyway and the rest of
[21:11] them are supposed to be
[21:13] statue of a perfect man page
[21:15] and he quoting back to the second peter
[21:18] 1 whereby given to us exceeding and
[21:20] great precious promises do you now
[21:22] understand the promises
[21:24] they were given by malachi 4 and he left
[21:28] what did he leave here the promises

[27:47] anointing
[27:49] amen like sister
[27:50] a pharaoh saying for us this morning the
[27:52] anointing
[27:54] amen now let's go to my subject
[27:57] amen let's get to my subject here
[27:58] charity anointed seven virtues for a
[28:01] manifestation of the seven thunders
[28:03] wouldn't that be wonderful
[28:06] three questions i want to ask amen i
[28:08] want to answer number one what is the
[28:10] anointing
[28:11] number two how do we receive the
[28:13] anointing
[28:15] and number three after we receive the
[28:17] anointing what do we become
[28:23] amen
[28:28] [Applause]
[28:34] i'll pause let you think on that now
[28:37] sila
[28:38] means pause and think on this
[28:44] all right now
[28:47] questions uh
[28:49] cod book but i have the the old one book
[28:51] two questions and answers the old green
[28:53] series but you pick up your cod book i
[28:55] think it's the same page anyway
[28:57] well before we do it now let's nail down
[28:59] the firefox ministry because a lot of
[29:00] people say that there is no fire for
[29:02] ministry
[29:04] in the message
[29:05] let's nail down the bride the church and
[29:08] charity as that which is perfect has
[29:10] come
[29:11] okay and brother brahma answered the
[29:12] questions i don't know what is the
[29:14] question
[29:14] what's the
[29:15] confusion amen
[29:17] on page 87 i've done this before but i
[29:19] think today maybe it'll strike home
[29:21] amen now there's many questions here
[29:24] well will the pride will this the church
[29:26] see you can't divine what they are the
[29:28] bride is the elected of god
[29:31] the church goes through
[29:35] that's the ones it says whosoever will
[29:37] let him come but the bride is elected of
[29:40] god
[29:42] so now you want to get off get in before
[29:45] the spirit comes upon the bride and the
[29:47] spirit and the bride say come
[29:51] you want to get in before that because
[29:52] whosoever will let him come and that's a
[29:55] church
[29:57] that goes through a tribulation period
[30:01] so we ain't just coming here for nothing
[30:06] we're trying to get in and be
[30:07] positionally placed
[30:09] but you can see what's happening there
[30:10] over in europe the uh brother and tony
[30:12] was telling me his father told him that
[30:14] july i believe that they're getting
[30:16] together on the money and the whole
[30:17] thing uniting and letting russia come
[30:19] into it
[30:20] in europe over there so brother thinks
[30:22] the clock is ticking amen praise god now
[30:25] see that's the one that says whosoever
[30:27] will let him come but the bride is the
[30:29] elected of god selected for the bride to
[30:32] be in here predestinated they're happy
[30:34] to be here they know they're going to be
[30:36] sealed they're not funny and walking
[30:37] around all strange
[30:40] not the bride no they're elected
[30:42] predestinated of god
[30:45] they're always the same
[30:46] yes so they're in and out up and down
[30:48] they they're there
[30:50] once that light strikes that seed
[30:54] they're not going nowhere
[30:57] praise god
[30:59] amen husband and wife sit together stand
[31:02] together praise god and they stay
[31:04] together
[31:05] amen praise god
[31:07] now no are there's five there is these
[31:10] are right in a row here there is five
[31:12] offices elected of god for god has said
[31:15] in the church apostles prophets
[31:16] teachings past and evangelism god did
[31:18] that man has deacons and so forth and
[31:21] everything else but you see
[31:23] but god said in the church for the
[31:25] perfecting of the church can't divide it
[31:28] a lot of people that message get mixed
[31:29] up with a elder app to teach and a real
[31:32] five four minutes to pastor they don't
[31:34] know the difference
[31:36] and that's where all the problems come
[31:37] in and see well that man is a past and
[31:39] the fire for ministry that's christ in
[31:41] there the ministry of christ
[31:45] not just somebody in the message running
[31:46] around because there's so much knowledge
[31:48] to spout out
[31:50] anybody could preach in this message
[31:52] here amen but anointing
[31:55] where's anointing
[31:58] hallelujah breaks the yolk
[32:02] upon the people
[32:03] [Applause]
[32:04] it doesn't bind them it breaks it
[32:06] hallelujah
[32:11] sets them free
[32:13] because it's christ in them setting the
[32:15] people free by the word
[32:18] hallelujah
[32:20] may be seated
[32:21] glory to god can't define it so if we
[32:24] understand it now there is a fight for
[32:25] ministry
[32:26] well then i can i start my my commission
[32:30] pouring into virtues
[32:33] do you see me as a pastor
[32:35] after all 17 years laboring
[32:38] do you believe it's the truth
[32:40] then stay with it praise god
[32:42] amen
[32:44] okay now the holy spirit i'm speaking
[32:46] about today now the holy spirit when it
[32:48] comes it it it is a witness unto you
[32:52] that this word is right now you had this
[32:55] word for 25 years
[32:56] and we're looking for this holy spirit
[32:58] this anointing to come down here today
[33:00] to witness
[33:03] to you that this word is right
[33:07] and god confirms his word with signs and
[33:10] wonders and miracles and gifts of the
[33:12] holy ghost
[33:14] hallelujah the holy ghost will testify
[33:18] and you will testify
[33:20] hallelujah praise god
[33:25] amen
[33:26] now you got it the prophet brought the
[33:28] word with the promise of the holy spirit
[33:31] to follow the word
[33:33] and where you preach that word by
[33:35] revelation the holy spirit follows that
[33:38] word zing zing zing wherever it goes at
[33:41] somebody block it off it goes right over
[33:43] top of you praise god it goes right
[33:45] behind you in the seat behind you
[33:49] goes right through you praise god you
[33:51] have no receptacle to hold it amen
[33:54] yay
[33:58] amen
[34:00] you may be seated
[34:01] now the holy spirit when it comes it is
[34:03] a witness unto you see that this word is
[34:06] right the word for today not the word
[34:08] for luther the word not for moses we
[34:11] witness it's the truth
[34:13] see it's another day that's why we are
[34:15] preaching this here i'm looking for the
[34:16] holy spirit to confirm
[34:18] it hallelujah
[34:22] now first corinthians 13 says this
[34:25] when that which is perfect is come and i
[34:26] read the scripture that which
[34:29] which is in part shall be done away with
[34:31] so all these little things are jumping
[34:33] up and down like a kid and turn to
[34:35] talking tongues and all these other
[34:37] things
[34:37] when that which is perfect i hear what
[34:39] he says and
[34:41] we do have today by god's help the
[34:44] perfect interpretation of the word with
[34:46] divine vindication
[34:50] that's charity
[34:51] that's the word but it comes in dynamics
[34:53] and mechanics
[34:55] and the dynamics is supposed to confirm
[34:58] to you that the mechanics is right
[35:01] then it's charity
[35:03] that's christ
[35:04] hallelujah
[35:06] praise god
[35:08] then that which is in part is done away
[35:10] with all these little interpretations
[35:12] besides this pentecostal stuff
[35:14] all these interpretations is done away
[35:16] with
[35:18] in the message
[35:20] listen i think this i think get done
[35:22] away
[35:23] pray finish
[35:25] praise god
[35:26] amen
[35:28] yes siree praise god
[35:30] amen
[35:32] when i was a child i speak of the child
[35:34] i understood as a child but when i
[35:35] become a man i put away childish things
[35:37] amen i go to preaching and then don't
[35:38] get through these things yes sir okay
[35:40] now now what question number one praise
[35:43] god uh
[35:44] what is the anointing
[35:46] what is it amen
[35:48] okay um
[35:50] but you see the church where am i at
[35:51] here uh okay here we are
[35:54] um what is the anointing page 101
[35:57] amen
[35:59] 101
[36:00] in the book here
[36:02] okay now
[36:03] and now
[36:04] what was that other question i get so
[36:06] wound up in these i forget the things uh
[36:09] what the things were one of them was was
[36:12] i they asked brother brown was he the
[36:13] son of man
[36:15] here it is i believe the son of man said
[36:18] they can't understand that god could be
[36:19] veiled in that prophet they don't get it
[36:21] you know and not jesus skin but the skin
[36:24] from genesis 18.
[36:26] human skin
[36:28] see they don't get it you see that so
[36:30] they say he is the son of man or the son
[36:32] of man was revealed in him
[36:34] that's what the scripture said so man
[36:36] would be revealed
[36:38] well the holy spirit the word he's gonna
[36:40] have a body to come into
[36:43] can't come into that piano over there
[36:45] praise god
[36:46] amen
[36:48] so it came in malachi for his body amen
[36:52] okay uh forget what the uh here it is i
[36:54] believe the son of man or was the pillow
[36:57] fire the son of man no
[36:58] now watch the pill of fire is the
[37:01] anointing
[37:03] you got it now
[37:04] and christ is anointed
[37:08] amen
[37:09] now now that pill of fire is the logos
[37:12] that went out of god the logos which is
[37:15] actually the attribute or the fullness
[37:17] of god
[37:19] you see this is now we're preaching it
[37:21] people are going and coming see but what
[37:24] they're doing they don't know see
[37:26] they're rejecting the fullness of the
[37:28] atonement
[37:31] now many in the message will take the
[37:32] atonement in part
[37:35] and you wonder why don't they do this
[37:36] they want to do that well they're only
[37:37] taking it apart
[37:39] but a bride is going to take it in his
[37:41] fullness
[37:46] so it's a big difference amen see
[37:49] so yeah
[37:52] and see the attribute other way you're
[37:55] taking all of the logos
[37:57] amen the answer to the fullness of god
[38:00] when god be coming to a form to where it
[38:04] could be seen
[38:06] it was the anointing of the great spirit
[38:09] that went forth
[38:11] amen coming down like seven rainbows
[38:14] condescending
[38:15] yes sir coming down god the father the
[38:18] locals that was up over
[38:20] israel he was holy could not bear sin
[38:24] there had to be a blood over right in
[38:26] eden then that locals become flesh and
[38:29] dwelt among us
[38:30] and where the locals dwelt in the human
[38:32] body which was the sacrifice
[38:35] amen
[38:37] oh praise god
[38:39] yes sir
[38:41] the pillar fires the longest did you
[38:43] pick that up now
[38:45] now jesus said i come from god and i go
[38:48] to god
[38:49] is that right after his death burial and
[38:51] resurrection and ascension when the body
[38:54] was taken up to sit at the right hand of
[38:56] god now i don't mean god's got a right
[38:58] hand god's a spirit but at the right
[39:01] hand means in power and authority of god
[39:04] that in that name everything in heaven
[39:07] is named after it and subject to it
[39:11] everything in the earth is named
[39:13] after it and subject to it a name above
[39:16] all names jesus christ
[39:20] amen
[39:22] now this logos
[39:25] this logos that was in him which was the
[39:28] spirit of god the anointing
[39:31] yes sir through the sanctifying grace of
[39:33] the blood
[39:35] brought many sons of god which is
[39:37] anointed with the same
[39:40] logos you anointed if you have the holy
[39:43] spirit with that same logos apart that
[39:47] locals come into your being his being
[39:50] come in you praise god you change you
[39:53] can never be the same anymore
[39:55] oh
[39:56] hallelujah praise god
[40:00] yes siree
[40:01] now on the day of pentecost they come
[40:03] down that pill of fire and broke apart
[40:05] like that and tongues of fire set up on
[40:07] each other
[40:08] not their tongues but tongues of fire
[40:11] set upon them elected selected group
[40:14] identified by this pill of fire
[40:17] showing that god has separated himself
[40:19] into man do you get it god the logos
[40:22] separating himself into man
[40:25] god not in one person he's in the church
[40:27] universal
[40:29] amen that's the reason jesus said the
[40:32] works that i do shall you do more also
[40:34] more now i know the king james version
[40:36] says greater but the right translation
[40:39] there is more than this shall you do

[40:46] god was bottled and confined in one man
[40:49] jesus christ but now he's bottled and
[40:52] confined in the whole universal church
[40:54] of the living god
[40:57] i got god in this bottle
[41:00] praise god you got god in your bottles

[46:15] apostolic age in the seven church ages
[46:17] and come right back in his fullness

[46:40] anoint
[46:41] sons of man to bring back a ministry now
[46:45] you understand the mercy of jesus christ
[46:46] now
[46:47] this charity that's to be loose
[46:50] is loose for what to bring back a
[46:52] ministry
[46:56] his ministry
[46:58] oh hallelujah bring back emergency just
[47:01] exactly like he said it would be
[47:03] in order for the head
[47:05] lovee
[47:07] and the rest of the body to connect
[47:08] together
[47:10] you got it
[47:13] now he ties into the pyramid just like
[47:15] the pyramid as enoch built and we find
[47:17] that in the pyramid they never did get
[47:19] the headstone on and why the headstone
[47:21] yet to come the headstones yet to come
[47:24] the seven steps in the pyramid now watch
[47:27] we'll go through that someday
[47:29] and i'd just like to show you how it
[47:31] really is perfectly with the scripture
[47:35] all these guys that come against the
[47:36] thunders and virtues of the world he
[47:38] said he'd go through it one day the holy
[47:40] ghost would and he'd show you this
[47:42] perfectly with the scriptures
[47:44] but it's a revelation until he goes
[47:46] through it
[47:48] not to everybody amen
[47:50] praise god so they don't understand it
[47:53] amen so now that now that great diamond
[47:55] see lovee could not settle down there in
[47:59] luther because it was luther was too
[48:01] wide
[48:02] and then as they come in the west bay is
[48:03] still too wide and brotherly kindness
[48:05] was still too are you looking at it
[48:07] so then he had to drop a ministry called
[48:10] the holy spirit
[48:12] and love will only fit into the holy
[48:14] spirit
[48:16] [Applause]
[48:18] it won't fit into the kind of only in
[48:20] the holy spirit but the kindness with
[48:22] all the virtues in it must pick up the
[48:24] holy spirit
[48:26] it must catch the capstone
[48:31] on the seventh step
[48:34] now it's death to go in there
[48:36] but mordecai like i said the other night
[48:38] told you how to dress esther
[48:41] if i perish i'll perish
[48:43] but my people haman the world council is
[48:46] after them so what am i going to do and
[48:50] mordecai told me what to wear
[48:52] and how to dress
[48:53] and it was the law of the king
[48:56] then at that time in persia that you
[48:58] could not come in to see him unless he
[49:00] sent for you
[49:03] even though you were one of his wives
[49:06] so esther knew she didn't have any
[49:07] command to come in there maybe seated so
[49:10] therefore she said
[49:12] and mordecai told her well you have to
[49:13] do it
[49:14] or they're going heyman's going to kill
[49:16] these jews here all your people
[49:19] so she put on all that a mordecai
[49:21] totally put on
[49:22] and then she walked and she was
[49:23] beautiful the king was he was gone
[49:27] he looked
[49:28] and he says
[49:29] what do you want esther under half of my
[49:31] kingdom and he put the scepter forward
[49:38] hallelujah can you imagine that charity
[49:41] drops down here maybe in 1991 and a lot
[49:44] of these people in this message try to
[49:46] approach
[49:47] charity the king
[49:50] without these uh virtues here
[49:53] with some little interpretation and mean
[49:56] and mad
[49:57] and putting people out of the message
[49:59] and how they gonna approach charity when
[50:02] i just went through the things that he
[50:03] is not puffed up and beareth all things
[50:06] hope with all things praise god
[50:08] and all these guys gonna approach
[50:10] charity
[50:12] huh
[50:13] with their strange revelations
[50:15] saying the virtues is not there it was a
[50:17] way back there somewhere because they
[50:19] don't have a life that's why they can't
[50:21] preach it they don't have it how can you
[50:24] preach what you are you can't be what
[50:26] you hate
[50:27] praise god
[50:29] you can't produce it they cannot produce
[50:31] it
[50:32] they don't understand that you you are
[50:35] it is a battle it's a revelation you
[50:37] fall down a thousand times but you get
[50:40] up i'm going to have it i'm going to

[58:22] so he come down as a shout
[58:24] to the prophet
[58:26] with the message
[58:27] and that message the word was to be the
[58:30] head
[58:31] of the church
[58:34] and if you find a pastor or man of god
[58:36] who will preach the handship
[58:40] a lot of people won't like it
[58:42] a lot of women won't like it i'll tell
[58:43] you that amen they'll get mad
[58:46] say you're mean and hard but that is the
