[0:00] Yeah.
[0:00] Amen.
[0:01] Let us turn to Malachi 3 16-18.
[0:06] Malachi 3
[0:08] 16
[0:10] through 18. You pray for me this morning
[0:13] that I don't know what exactly what to
[0:16] say, but he does.
[0:18] He knows what you need this morning. And
[0:21] the gift here must be operated by him.
[0:24] Amen. From God to your souls.
[0:26] Amen.
[0:27] Amen. A royal priesthood. from God to
[0:29] your souls.
[0:30] But he must operate the gift, not me.
[0:33] If I operate, it'll be flesh.
[0:34] Amen.
[0:35] Letter. But if Christ operates this gift
[0:38] this morning,
[0:40] Amen. You got it. If Christ operates it,
[0:43] and he will,
[0:44] for I'm confident that he's here now.
[0:47] He's in his word.
[0:48] Amen.
[0:50] Then they notice now who we talking
[0:54] about. Then they that feared the Lord
[0:57] spake often,
[1:00] coming together, as they see that day
[1:03] approaching, spake often one to another.
[1:06] Not the sinners, not the world, but they
[1:10] spake often one to another. Amen.
[1:14] Amen.
[1:15] My my
[1:17] Let me read it again now. They that
[1:20] feared the Lord spake often one to
[1:23] another. Those that don't fear God live
[1:26] in the world. Believe the message. But
[1:30] those that fear God speak often one with
[1:34] another.
[1:35] Amen.
[1:36] Same mind, same heart, same soul, same
[1:40] desire, same everything.
[1:43] Their bodies show who they are.
[1:45] You don't have to worry about tell you
[1:47] got to believe it. You got to you don't
[1:48] have to do anything. They that fear the
[1:50] Lord, they'll come. Amen.
[1:53] That's right. And they'll come by the
[1:55] spirit of the Lord. If they don't come,
[1:56] the spirit of God didn't send them. Got
[1:58] to believe it just that way.
[1:59] Amen.
[2:01] And the Lord hearkened and heard it. And
[2:04] a book of remembrance was written before
[2:06] him for them that feared the Lord. See,
[2:11] and that thought upon his name. Isn't
[2:15] that wonderful?
[2:17] Now notice this. Now, now these people
[2:19] that are doing this, see, they shall be
[2:22] mine, saith the Lord of hosts.
[2:26] Amen.
[2:27] In that day, this day now, see, when I
[2:30] make up my jewels.
[2:32] Amen.
[2:34] My my He's making up his jewels, saints.
[2:38] Amen.
[2:39] And I will spare them as a man spareth
[2:42] his own son that serveth him. Then shall
[2:45] ye return.
[2:47] Malachi will turn your heart back then.
[2:49] Amen. Then shall ye return back to the
[2:53] word of God and fear coming together
[2:55] with the saints of God and so forth.
[2:58] Then shall ye return and discern. See,
[3:01] be able to judge with anointed eyes.
[3:04] Amen. I right now we don't know who who
[3:07] is a believer. Many believe the message.
[3:10] Hey, that's it. Many say, "Lord, I Lord,
[3:13] I love you, Lord." That don't mean
[3:15] nothing. Amen. But when this word comes,
[3:18] then you can discern who loves God,
[3:21] who's a liar, who is a a a makeeliever.
[3:25] Amen. You can discern. You don't say
[3:27] that. You just go on. See, then shall
[3:30] you return and discern between the
[3:32] righteous and the wicked, between him
[3:34] that serveth God and him that serveth
[3:38] him. Now, how can you serve him? Present
[3:40] your body.
[3:40] A living sacrifice.
[3:42] Where at? To Christ. Not in the world.
[3:44] Amen.
[3:45] Amen.
[3:46] He that is joined with a harlot, Amen,
[3:49] is one flesh.
[3:51] You join out in the world, you are a
[3:53] fleshy one flesh with the world. The
[3:55] lera,
[3:56] the Philistines, they all over top of
[3:59] you.
[3:59] Amen. And you're bound. You because you
[4:02] can't get up. See,
[4:04] so we find also friends over in in first
[4:09] Peter. I want to go to
[4:12] first Peter the 4th chapter.
[4:15] the 12th verse.
[4:20] I'll read this because I could hardly
[4:23] read it for speaking on these verses.
[4:26] They're just right there. Beloved, think
[4:28] it not strange concerning the fiery
[4:31] trial, which is to try you as though
[4:34] some strange thing happened to you. What
[4:37] you getting excited about?
[4:39] Huh? Getting all worked up and
[4:40] everything. Why is this happening to me?
[4:42] Huh? Let me read again. See, beloved,
[4:45] he's talking to the bride here. See,
[4:47] beloved, think it not strange concerning
[4:50] the fiery trial, which is to try you as
[4:54] though some strange thing happened to
[4:55] you. But rejoice in as much as ye are
[4:59] partakers of Christ's sufferings. See
[5:03] that when his glory shall be revealed in
[5:05] the resurrection, Amen. Ye shall be glad
[5:10] also with exceeding joy. If God permits
[5:15] you, see, if ye be reproached, and you
[5:17] can only be reproached if he allows it.
[5:20] Amen. Try and drive his own. See, only
[5:22] if he allow you to be reproached, then
[5:25] you must be a special person to be able
[5:29] to have a trial.
[5:31] Amen.
[5:32] Only special people does God allow to
[5:35] have a trial. He don't bother the rest
[5:36] of them.
[5:37] Amen.
[5:37] Amen. Only his people, a peculiar
[5:40] people. Amen. a holy people.
[5:43] He lets the He just lets them have a a
[5:46] trial for him.
[5:48] Amen.
[5:49] Think on that now.
[5:51] That's That is wonderful, isn't it?
[5:53] Amen.
[5:54] My my You can see all the gloom leaving
[5:56] now.
[5:57] Cuz everybody here by faith says that
[5:59] they are these people.
[6:02] Amen. Then we must have trials.
[6:04] Amen.
[6:05] Wonderful. Praise God. If ye be
[6:09] reproached for the name of Christ,
[6:12] holiness and sincerity and truth and so
[6:14] forth as to why you're doing this. See,
[6:17] happy are ye for the spirit of glory and
[6:20] of God rested upon you. On their part,
[6:24] he's evil spoken of, but on your part he
[6:26] is glorified.
[6:28] Amen. Amen.
[6:29] But now notice now, let none of you
[6:32] suffer as a murderer, as a thief, or as
[6:34] a evildoer,
[6:35] or as a busy body
[6:38] in other men's matters.
[6:40] Amen.
[6:42] Yet, if any man suffer as a Christian,
[6:44] let him not be ashamed. Now, going into
[6:47] the world having trials is not suffering
[6:48] as a Christian. You went there yourself.
[6:51] Amen.
[6:51] God didn't send you out there by your
[6:53] own choice. There you went. If you want
[6:55] idols and gods in your heart, that's
[6:57] what you want. Therefore, you ain't
[6:58] suffering because because for his sake
[7:01] is when the evildoers come against you
[7:03] for serving the go because for doing his
[7:05] will. That's when you're suffering. And
[7:07] that's when you're being buffeted about
[7:09] not because not not for your own faults.
[7:12] That's wonderful because with him. But
[7:14] if you get buffeted about and you did
[7:17] it, that ain't nothing.
[7:19] So if you're in the world getting buffed
[7:21] about now, that ain't nothing. You asked
[7:23] for it. Amen.
[7:25] Think on that now. See,
[7:27] so yet if any man suffer as a Christian,
[7:31] let him not be ashamed, but let him
[7:33] glorify God on this behalf. Glorify him
[7:35] for it. If you're suffering, Bible says
[7:38] so. Amen. For the time has come that
[7:40] judgment must begin at at the house of
[7:43] God. And if it if it begin at us, what
[7:46] shall the end be of them that obey not
[7:50] this word? What is therein? See, and if
[7:54] the righteous scarcely be saved, where
[7:56] shall the ungodly and the sin appear?
[7:58] Wherefore let them that suffer according
[8:01] to the will of God commit the keeping of
[8:04] their souls to him. Other words, deposit
[8:06] your soul into his hands. And when he
[8:09] shall appear, you shall see it. Amen.
[8:11] It's in the bank.
[8:13] Amen.
[8:13] Amen.
[8:14] Put your soul in his bank and let him
[8:16] add to it.
[8:17] Amen.
[8:18] Amen. Let him work on on your soul in
[8:21] his bank.
[8:22] Is that right? And when he shall appear,
[8:24] you will see that you have much
[8:25] interest.
[8:26] Amen.
[8:27] Praise the Lord.
[8:29] And wherefore let them that suffer
[8:31] according to the will of God. That's
[8:33] what I I just said. If you going into
[8:35] the world, that's not his will.
[8:37] Amen.
[8:37] Amen.
[8:38] Therefore, you're not in God's will. If
[8:40] you're out there suffering, it's only
[8:42] when you come into God's house. commit
[8:44] the keeping of their souls to him in
[8:47] welloing. Keep on doing well. Some get
[8:50] weary. Don't faint. There's a crown
[8:52] waiting for you.
[8:53] Amen.
[8:54] The psalm, the song this morning, armed
[8:57] Christian soldiers, take up your cross,
[8:59] all fits together this morning. Amen.
[9:01] You see it now.
[9:02] As unto a faithful creator, may God a
[9:04] blessing to to the reading of his word.
[9:06] Well, friends, uh that has already laid
[9:09] out a background this morning for what I
[9:11] want to say. The Holy Spirit has already
[9:13] done it already. See, because through
[9:14] the word. So now for a few moments as
[9:17] the Holy Spirit would strike it just
[9:19] right.
[9:20] The Lord has descended from heaven with
[9:23] a shout.
[9:24] Do you believe that?
[9:25] Amen.
[9:26] I mean, he has already come with a
[9:28] shout.
[9:28] This is the seven seal message. This is
[9:31] a revelation to the bride of Jesus
[9:34] Christ. God has revealed this to her.
[9:37] This revelation gives her a super faith.
[9:41] For as she sees this word made manifest,
[9:46] it renews her faith in the word.
[9:48] Amen.
[9:49] Amen. But she waits on the word. She
[9:53] waits. And as she waits and the word is
[9:56] made manifest, she mounts up with
[9:58] strength. Amen. She sees it happening.
[10:01] Therefore, this is going on right now.
[10:04] Now the Lord has descended down to this
[10:07] earth which is a type of hell on the
[10:10] earth here. All the signs are here. The
[10:12] sodomites and all these different signs.
[10:14] They all here. And cuz Jesus said over
[10:16] in St. John 10, I am come that you might
[10:20] have life.
[10:20] Amen.
[10:21] And more abundantly. Amen.
[10:24] So therefore, he has come.
[10:26] Not come, he has come.
[10:28] The word of God has descended on earth
[10:31] with a shout.
[10:32] Amen. And in the Greek this shout means
[10:35] that there is a special significance
[10:38] between the one who gives out this
[10:40] command and those who are the the
[10:43] command is for something holds them
[10:45] together. Spirit of the Lord. Amen.
[10:48] Through Malachi 4 calling in his seeds
[10:50] of God. So we find friends that the life
[10:55] which is to be more abundantly has come
[10:58] through this shout. Seven seals, the
[11:00] full word of God being made manifest to
[11:03] his people. Amen.
[11:05] Then we see then that this has been
[11:07] revealed through Malachi 4, St. Luke
[11:10] 17:30, and Revelation 10:7. Is that
[11:13] right? This has come. Then we've seen a
[11:17] little humble prophet with the
[11:19] crucified, resurrected life of Christ in
[11:23] him. It wasn't the signs, wonders, and
[11:25] miracles, but it was the life that we
[11:28] saw that sets us free from bondage.
[11:31] Amen.
[11:32] Amen.
[11:32] The false anointed ones can have all
[11:34] kind of signs,
[11:35] but that don't set you free.
[11:37] Is when you see a life
[11:39] of Christ
[11:41] walking on the earth, that's what sets
[11:43] you free.
[11:44] Then you know you have a hope that you
[11:46] can do it. Amen.
[11:48] For God said that you would do it. See,
[11:51] but there's a certain way it must come.
[11:53] Amen.
[11:54] Amen.
[11:55] As Jesus was speaking over in in the
[11:57] parables over there, what man would go
[11:59] out and also build a house and don't sit
[12:01] down and count up the cost?
[12:03] Amen.
[12:04] So when the house is to be finished and
[12:06] he won't have enough money for it.
[12:08] Amen.
[12:09] Well, therefore, what person would come
[12:11] to Christ in this hour and think that he
[12:15] wouldn't have to die in the flesh? M
[12:18] what person would because come to this
[12:20] message now a flesh pot he'll come think
[12:23] he can live in the world live out think
[12:26] can you see the audacity of somebody
[12:30] that God would reveal his word to then
[12:33] take it and just because walk over on
[12:35] top of it as if as it was nothing and go
[12:38] out live in the world and think he's
[12:40] going in the rapture something's wrong
[12:42] with him you see me now so therefore we
[12:45] find friends that This is a revelation
[12:49] to want to live holy for Christ. It's a
[12:52] revelation. See, and we find that Paul
[12:55] said
[12:56] it pleased God who separated him from
[12:59] his mother's womb and called him by his
[13:02] grace. See, it pleased God to reveal his
[13:06] son in me.
[13:07] Amen.
[13:09] It pleased God to reveal Christ in Paul.
[13:14] Galatians 1:16. Amen. Amen.
[13:16] Do you hear what I said?
[13:18] It pleased God to reveal Christ the son
[13:22] through Paul.
[13:23] Amen.
[13:24] When Paul got that revelation
[13:27] immediately, he conferred not with flesh
[13:29] and blood.
[13:30] Amen.
[13:31] Amen.
[13:31] Amen.
[13:32] No, he didn't.
[13:34] And he didn't go up to Jerusalem with
[13:37] the bishops. He went to the wilderness
[13:39] with Christ.
[13:40] Amen. And every person that comes to
[13:43] this message must go to the wilderness
[13:46] with Christ.
[13:47] Amen.
[13:48] Not sit around in the flesh and with
[13:51] flesh and blood. Now, what do you think
[13:52] he means over here on the tape over
[13:53] here? Uh-uh. That's not it. That is and
[13:55] go to a man. Now, what's this mean over
[13:57] here? God must reveal his son in you.
[14:01] Amen.
[14:01] And through you.
[14:03] This is a personal revelation.
[14:05] Amen.
[14:06] Don't confer with flesh and blood, but
[14:10] coming together with the revelation,
[14:12] speaking often of the things of God as
[14:15] as a holy priesthood, praising and
[14:18] blessing his name, and going forth as a
[14:21] royal priesthood. Royal means that that
[14:24] you're somebody.
[14:25] Amen. Royal blood.
[14:27] We're royal seeds of God. Christ is the
[14:29] royal seed. But he said, "I will
[14:32] restore, saith the Lord. For in the
[14:35] resurrection will I find many royal
[14:37] seeds like unto myself."
[14:39] Amen.
[14:39] Amen.
[14:40] But these royal seeds must be purified
[14:43] first.
[14:44] Amen. Washed by the what of the word.
[14:47] Amen.
[14:48] Sanctified, ready and meat for the
[14:50] master's use
[14:52] only through the word.
[14:53] Amen.
[14:54] Amen.
[14:55] So we find friends then that why is this
[14:58] going on? Why has this washing come to
[15:01] make up his jewels?
[15:02] Amen.
[15:03] Is that right?
[15:04] He said, "I'm making up my jewels."
[15:06] Amen.
[15:08] So therefore, we find when he make up
[15:10] his jewels,
[15:11] the people by a revelation who know that
[15:15] they're one of his jewels don't mind
[15:18] being cut.
[15:18] Amen.
[15:19] And also polished.
[15:20] Amen.
[15:21] Amen.
[15:21] For they're being fit into his crown.
[15:24] They don't mind at all.
[15:26] They don't think it's strange. It's hard
[15:28] for anything to come.
[15:30] Amen.
[15:30] Lord God, let thy will be done.
[15:33] Amen.
[15:34] Amen.
[15:34] Yes, sir.
[15:35] They think on his name. They walk in
[15:38] holiness,
[15:39] sincerity,
[15:40] in truth.
[15:42] They don't worry about the evildoers who
[15:44] talk against you all the time. They
[15:47] don't worry about those who God would
[15:51] reveal to him that what you do as unto
[15:54] the Lord. See, like in here, if he's
[15:57] over here on his tape recorder, that's
[16:00] between you and God. If it's a deacon,
[16:02] L, that's between you and God. You ain't
[16:04] doing that for me, friends. You're doing
[16:06] it for the Lord.
[16:07] But when somebody would complain,
[16:10] maybe if Brother Hun or Brother Come if
[16:12] if they give out an order for the tapes
[16:15] for anything in here and you don't like
[16:16] it, you don't like the Lord for you're
[16:19] doing unto the Lord, not unto me.
[16:22] Amen.
[16:22] Amen. So therefore what happens you find
[16:25] that communication breakdown. So amen
[16:28] mean now that there's nothing there's no
[16:30] bond between you.
[16:32] Amen. That's why when the when Christ
[16:35] over in St. Luke 24 when the
[16:38] resurrection had come to pass when the
[16:40] word of God said he would raise the
[16:43] third day. Even the unbelievers knew he
[16:46] was raised for they went and got a stone
[16:49] and seal his tomb.
[16:50] Amen.
[16:51] Amen. But the believers didn't know it.
[16:54] Amen. Here was these women coming to his
[16:57] grave to because dress him with odors
[17:00] and perfume. They were coming for a dead
[17:02] god. Amen.
[17:04] And they were already worrying, who's
[17:06] going to move the stone? Who's going to
[17:08] do this here before they even got there?
[17:10] Just like people come here to service
[17:12] this morning. I don't feel good. This
[17:14] happened here. coming to God's service
[17:17] where he's at in his word, in his
[17:19] presence, and they're worrying who going
[17:21] to move the stone. And when they get
[17:23] there, the angel of the Lord had already
[17:25] moved the stone.
[17:27] Amen.
[17:28] God has already done it. He has already
[17:31] paid because paved the way for you. But
[17:34] if thou can't believe, take it.
[17:36] Amen.
[17:37] And don't stagger. Amen.
[17:39] I walk into the hospital and see it
[17:40] laying there. I don't look at anything
[17:42] laying there. I look at the word of God.
[17:43] Amen. Amen.
[17:45] This if you are to see to Abraham you
[17:47] have that faith where you stag or not
[17:50] and either you going to show it now or
[17:52] you never going to show it.
[17:54] It's got to be shown now.
[17:55] Amen.
[17:56] Amen.
[17:57] So we find then that just like those two
[18:00] disciples walking down that gloomy road
[18:04] to Emmas that was a sad road to walk.
[18:07] Amen.
[18:08] Amen. He said, "What kind of
[18:10] communications because are you having
[18:12] you're sad as you walking down this
[18:14] road? What is this all about? I gave you
[18:17] my word. I came and showed the way." And
[18:20] yet before because of their unbelief, he
[18:24] walked right beside them. Amen. Right
[18:27] beside them. See? And they didn't know
[18:29] it. But as he moved up and began to
[18:34] exalt him in the word, keep and step,
[18:37] keeping step, keeping step. See, and
[18:39] unbeliever because because then it
[18:41] leaves. See, he brought the word to them
[18:43] as they break bread. Their eyes were
[18:46] open.
[18:47] Amen.
[18:48] The eyes were open.
[18:50] Well, we are Christ has already come
[18:53] with a shout.
[18:54] Amen. Then he said through his prophet,
[18:57] I will ride the same trail with the
[19:00] bride all over again.
[19:01] Amen. In the resurrection.
[19:04] Well, then what kind of communication
[19:05] are you carrying on now?
[19:08] Sad and down and gloomy, worrying about
[19:10] this and looking at this and looking at
[19:12] look at the word.
[19:14] Amen.
[19:14] For when those disciples get off of that
[19:16] road to Emmus. Amen. And get on it when
[19:20] Christ breaks that word. For then those
[19:23] same two disciples, when that word began
[19:26] to come in, they said, "Then our hearts
[19:28] burn within us as we thought on the
[19:32] word."
[19:32] Amen.
[19:33] As a prophet preached, "Think on your
[19:35] way and turn your feet to his
[19:38] testimonies. Oh fools, and slow of heart
[19:41] to believe all that the prophets have
[19:44] said, they are they which testify of me.
[19:47] Christ could not come unless he came by
[19:51] the word.
[19:52] Amen.
[19:53] Now watch this. Now before 6,000 years
[19:56] ago, nobody would know anything about
[19:58] Christ at all. Is that right? Then down
[20:00] through all the age with all the
[20:02] prophets, they said he would come. Then
[20:05] he only came because they said so.
[20:08] Did you understand then? Now
[20:10] they came because the word said so.
[20:12] Well, then the same word said he would
[20:14] raise the third day.
[20:15] Amen. But they just couldn't believe all
[20:18] that the prophets had said.
[20:20] Believe every word.
[20:21] Amen.
[20:22] So therefore, then if Christ came by the
[20:25] word, the bride must come the same way.
[20:28] She comes by the word of God. Amen.
[20:31] Those two disciples, St. Luke 24:33,
[20:35] went into a wonderful service. Is that
[20:38] right?
[20:39] There was the 11 gathered there and the
[20:41] rest of them there and they ran in
[20:42] there. They had doubt in there. They was
[20:45] afraid. The women had come and said
[20:47] because he's risen and Peter because he
[20:49] had ran off. Notice there there's a type
[20:51] of your ministry meeting Christ and God
[20:55] and nobody knows anything what Christ
[20:57] told Peter. Is that right?
[20:59] Amen.
[20:59] For the ministry now should be in
[21:01] seclusion with Christ.
[21:03] Did you get that?
[21:04] It must be a love affair. Something he
[21:07] reveals something that that he spoke to
[21:09] Peter gave him restoration gave him
[21:11] faith gave him courage. Amen. to go and
[21:14] wait on God. You see me now. Then these
[21:17] two disciples with their hearts stirred
[21:20] and turned to the word busted into that
[21:23] gloomy meeting. Amen.
[21:25] And they say he's risen. He's the same
[21:28] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. As
[21:30] they exalted and they exalted for they
[21:33] met Christ on the road. Amen. And he's
[21:36] here today with his spirit, with his
[21:40] word. But if you'll only fake on him and
[21:44] turn your feet to the testimonies, fake
[21:46] on him, then you can go into any two or
[21:49] three gathering where they're sitting
[21:50] around all gloomy and afraid that he
[21:53] won't do it. You follow me now? That he
[21:55] ain't the same yesterday, today, and
[21:56] forever. Walk in there with faith,
[21:58] friends, and exhort one another. Think
[22:01] on his name, on his holiness, and so
[22:03] forth, and walk in the light. Amen.
[22:06] Amen. So we find then that as he did
[22:09] that as they did that the testimony of
[22:11] two witnesses always testify of the
[22:13] things in the last days he accept the
[22:16] Holy Ghost it shall testify of him.
[22:18] Amen.
[22:19] By a revelation faith you see. So
[22:22] therefore that that's why we exhort you
[22:24] when you're around your groups. If you
[22:25] talk negative like they were talking
[22:28] there's no Holy Ghost there whatsoever.
[22:32] You just die. The this tongue has the
[22:35] power of death and life. Amen. Says so
[22:38] in Proverbs. What you say, you bring a
[22:40] spirit of death all around you. Well,
[22:42] the Lord Satan said this and the devil
[22:45] did this to me. You follow me now? The
[22:47] Bible says, "Count it joy when you fall
[22:48] into doubless temptations."
[22:50] Amen. Think on these things, friends.
[22:53] You yourself must do it. You should be
[22:56] joyful praising God.
[22:58] When you would fall into one temptation,
[23:01] should thank God for it. We'll find out
[23:03] why. Amen.
[23:04] Amen.
[23:05] So, we find then that as they see these
[23:08] things happening, they fell into this
[23:10] meeting, notice now these two disciples
[23:14] come in there and there they were
[23:16] exorting. You don't have to be a
[23:17] minister. Two disciples. Amen.
[23:20] They were exalting. They were believing.
[23:23] Amen.
[23:24] And also was Mary. She was believing.
[23:26] They all were believing. Now with that
[23:28] atmosphere, Christ suddenly appeared
[23:31] through the wall. Amen.
[23:33] Amen.
[23:33] Amen.
[23:34] And if God can get up a group like that
[23:37] here, Amen.
[23:38] he will certainly come to his temple.
[23:41] Amen.
[23:42] Amen.
[23:43] But let everybody, minister, deacon,
[23:46] elder, woman, man, exhort one another on
[23:50] the word. Think on these things. Speak
[23:52] often one another on the word of God.
[23:55] Think on his holiness,
[23:57] not bank accounts and things in the
[23:59] world. Think on God. Amen. Amen.
[24:02] Amen.
[24:03] We find friends that but today
[24:05] everybody's self style. You got to beg
[24:07] them to do everything. Well, do you want
[24:09] me to do that?
[24:11] Can you imagine that? People say, "Well,
[24:14] do you want me to do that?" They call
[24:16] you on the phone say, "Well, should I do
[24:17] that? Do you want to do it?" Then if
[24:20] you're doing do it unto the Lord,
[24:22] but they got to call you up. Do you want
[24:24] me to do that? No. Christ between you
[24:28] and him. Every man should know what he
[24:30] wants to do.
[24:32] You don't have to ask me because should
[24:33] I do that? Do it as unto the Lord.
[24:36] Amen.
[24:36] Amen.
[24:37] So we find friends that on a tape heard
[24:40] the other day here, brother Brandon
[24:41] doing God's service against his will
[24:44] because at the end of it, he says, "Our
[24:46] money, property, things of the world
[24:48] have no meaning. Just so temporal." And
[24:51] I was wondering why the Holy Spirit has
[24:52] kept crying out through hell for a whole
[24:54] month now against all these things. And
[24:56] I pick up that tape and there it was
[24:58] right there. Bring what you're saying to
[25:00] the message. Bring it to what has
[25:02] already been said. Amen. Exhort you,
[25:05] remind you of these things. That's all
[25:06] I'm doing. Amen.
[25:08] Amen.
[25:08] He said, he said, just so temporal, all
[25:12] of them must go. Our jobs, places,
[25:14] friends of the world, everything must
[25:17] go. Relatives, you know what I mean? No
[25:20] matter how rich, how poor, how popular
[25:22] we are, there is only one thing for our
[25:25] being here. Christ.
[25:27] Amen. Praise God.
[25:30] Only one thing for us being here. Christ
[25:34] expressed us here.
[25:36] A seed of God was in our hearts in this
[25:40] 63. From from there on, that seed opened
[25:43] up when it met Malachi 4. Amen. And this
[25:46] age said that that seed would do certain
[25:49] things. It would have faith. It would
[25:52] exalt one another. It would have love.
[25:54] Therefore, the seed opens under the hot
[25:56] presence of the sun and declares itself
[25:59] in that age.
[26:00] Amen.
[26:01] Then that's why they return and they
[26:04] discern.
[26:05] For it declares itself.
[26:06] You don't have to beg it. It's not a
[26:08] because a hot bed plant. Is that right?
[26:11] No. Because a hot house plant. Amen.
[26:14] You don't have to beg it and water it.
[26:16] Amen. It source itself. It Listen, you
[26:20] are a holy priesthood. Do you realize
[26:23] what you are? You are continually to be
[26:26] given up spiritual sacrifices to Christ,
[26:29] thanksgiving and praise and present in
[26:32] your body. That's all. You follow me?
[26:34] Now when you do that there, then you
[26:36] know how to walk with God. So we said
[26:38] also,
[26:40] let us lay aside everything as secondary
[26:43] and hold to him. He is the word. And
[26:46] that's exactly what we was preaching
[26:48] here. lay aside because you can have it,
[26:51] but don't put nothing over Christ. Don't
[26:56] trust in anything in the world. Hold to
[26:58] God's unchanging hand. Amen. Don't
[27:01] coveret nothing here, friends.
[27:03] For there's something fixing to happen.
[27:05] Amen.
[27:06] Don't let the Lord, your Lord, come and
[27:09] find another secret love in your hearts.
[27:11] Amen.
[27:12] Come and let him come and find you
[27:14] clean. Hold on. Nothing in this world
[27:16] having it. Praying. If you have
[27:18] anything, we'll go to Christ and say,
[27:19] "Lord, what would you have me to do with
[27:21] it?" That's all. He'll show you in due
[27:23] time.
[27:23] Amen.
[27:24] It might take a year. It might take two
[27:25] months. I don't know. But he'll show
[27:27] you. But you don't have to get
[27:28] panicstricken and uh say, "Here, like
[27:31] here, wait on God." Amen. And then then
[27:33] you know it's Christ.
[27:35] It may take two months, three months,
[27:37] but you know it's God.
[27:38] Amen.
[27:38] Amen.
[27:40] So we find now the shout has come. Is
[27:43] that right? Then if you understand that
[27:45] the seven seals, the resurrected life of
[27:49] Christ is here.
[27:51] Amen. It's here.
[27:53] Where is it at? In the word.
[27:55] In the word. For every royal holy
[27:59] priesthood. Amen. You are a royal
[28:02] priesthood. A holy priesthood. You are
[28:04] every man, child, and woman. That's you.
[28:08] Therefore, you have something to do. You
[28:09] don't have to feel left out because you
[28:11] ain't preaching.
[28:12] That's right. Well, a royal priesthood.
[28:14] And now understand this. Now, Melzdc can
[28:17] be touched. Is that right?
[28:19] Well, then if you are Melzdic's body and
[28:23] he's touched, then you'll find out what
[28:26] he wants to do in prayer.
[28:28] Is that right?
[28:29] Then you go to where you have to go. You
[28:32] might have to go to the hospital. You
[28:33] might have to go over there to pray for
[28:34] a sister. I might have to give him an
[28:35] offering. You I don't know.
[28:37] Can you understand this now?
[28:38] Amen.
[28:39] But where will you find this out? Not
[28:41] running around with sinners, not flat
[28:43] jabing around in the street somewhere
[28:45] standing around because of because being
[28:47] a busy body or not sitting around in the
[28:49] flesh but on your knees.
[28:52] That's where you find out if you are a
[28:54] holy priesthood. I don't know. But you
[28:57] know. Amen.
[28:58] Amen.
[28:59] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[29:01] So we find friends that the resurrected
[29:04] life is now here in the word. Amen.
[29:08] That's why Paul said, "Always bearing
[29:11] about in the body the dying of the
[29:15] Lord."
[29:16] Is that right?
[29:18] Always. Not tomorrow or right now in
[29:21] service when you walk downstairs there.
[29:24] Amen. Take the same word with you all
[29:26] day.
[29:27] You follow me now? Well, come back here
[29:29] tonight lifted up to God and ready to
[29:32] praise him again.
[29:33] You follow me now? Whatever happens, a a
[29:35] slur, a dart, buried about in your body.
[29:39] Don't say a mumbling word. He didn't say
[29:41] anything. Arm yourselves with the mind
[29:43] that Christ suffered because for us, arm
[29:46] yourself with the same mind that we will
[29:48] suffer for him.
[29:50] Amen.
[29:50] Amen.
[29:51] Amen.
[29:51] If you don't deny, you must deny
[29:54] everything here or he shall deny you.
[29:56] Amen. Amen.
[29:57] So therefore we find then that
[30:00] always bearing about in our body the
[30:02] dying of the Lord Jesus. Why? That the
[30:06] life may be made manifest through you.
[30:09] Amen.
[30:10] What life? The resurrected life that you
[30:12] saved because you have now
[30:14] the word of God is here.
[30:16] Is that right?
[30:17] Amen.
[30:18] Then we all have a cross to bear. Is
[30:21] that right? We all got a cross. You see?
[30:24] Then our cross is to have our bodies
[30:26] walk among our friends, relatives, jobs
[30:29] in the street, bearing about the dying
[30:32] of the Lord. Amen.
[30:34] Shame and reproach. Not fighting back,
[30:37] not getting mad, washed, sanctified,
[30:40] clean, praying, watching, ready, looking
[30:43] for your master. Amen. Not holding
[30:45] nothing down here.
[30:46] If one gets sick, we all all of us
[30:49] gather around. These signs shall follow
[30:52] them that believe. Amen.
[30:53] Amen. What happened here? Sister See
[30:55] with a sacrifice. There she lays. There
[30:58] she's in God's hand. But one thing we
[31:00] know, she as Paul was was because blind
[31:04] for because three days. Amen. He was
[31:06] near. There he was blinded out to the
[31:08] world. There he because he was in God's
[31:10] hand. But when he came from that
[31:12] blindness, rise up, wash your sins away.
[31:16] Amen. Calling upon the name of the Lord.
[31:18] Sister to see Brooke as she is coming
[31:20] out of the fog now. She's calling upon
[31:22] the name of the Lord for she was he was
[31:25] there with her in that trial. He was
[31:28] right there with her. Now she knows that
[31:31] he brought her through.
[31:32] Can't nobody take that from her.
[31:35] She had a personal experience with God
[31:38] and it purified her. And now her heart
[31:41] is giving out spiritual praises to God.
[31:43] Thanksgiving and praise Jesus. Jesus all
[31:46] the time. Amen. That's the reason why
[31:49] friends think on that. Amen. You
[31:52] understand this now?
[31:54] But some of you get what happened to
[31:55] her? Did she sin or what happened there?
[31:57] Forget about it. It's in God's hands.
[31:59] Amen.
[32:00] Speak often one to another on the word
[32:03] with faith. Don't walk down be gloomy
[32:05] road. What? Amen.
[32:07] Let always be in faith.
[32:09] Do all things in the name of the Lord
[32:11] Jesus Christ.
[32:12] Amen.
[32:13] So we find friends that as we do this
[32:17] see Malachi 4 came the same way he died
[32:20] out to everything. We saw that
[32:23] resurrected life of Christ in him. Many
[32:26] of the signs and wonders and miracles
[32:28] you didn't even see them. You know that
[32:29] he could do them.
[32:30] Amen.
[32:31] But you saw him the life for many of
[32:34] them were done in secret. You didn't see
[32:35] them cuz he wouldn't even tell you about
[32:37] them. But you saw life a resurrected
[32:41] life of Christ. And that's what has set
[32:43] you free. For you know that there is a
[32:46] God. You saw him. You felt him. You
[32:48] touched his hand. He walked among you.
[32:51] Amen.
[32:51] Amen.
[32:52] Yes, sir. So now, as we go on the cross,
[32:57] excuse me, die out in his flesh. See,
[33:00] the anointing gets stronger and
[33:03] stronger.
[33:03] That's right.
[33:05] If you won't take the word, there's no
[33:07] anointing.
[33:09] But it seems so simple and so easy. But
[33:12] that's just the way it is. It won't come
[33:15] no other way. Now, so you may understand
[33:18] it, God, may he send his Holy Ghost and
[33:20] open up your minds when you fight the
[33:23] deacons, when you get mad at the sisters
[33:27] or or because of brothers or or want to
[33:30] question what we're doing here or if we
[33:32] tell you to do a certain thing or are
[33:34] you dying?
[33:36] What kind of anointing is up on you?
[33:39] Amen. Think on it now.
[33:42] When you spat and fight with one another
[33:44] and devour one another, what kind of
[33:46] anointing is that?
[33:47] But when we are dying armed with the
[33:50] mind of Christ, humbling ourselves
[33:52] through the word of God, Lord, not my
[33:55] stinking will, but thy will be done.
[33:57] Amen.
[33:58] Amen. Amen. Is that right?
[34:00] Not my will.
[34:02] Yes, my Lord.
[34:02] David said in Psalm 39, "Though I burn
[34:05] with fire within me, I held my peace."
[34:07] Amen.
[34:09] Yes, sir.
[34:10] David held his peace
[34:12] from good.
[34:14] Amen.
[34:15] Though he would want to correct somebody
[34:17] living in the world,
[34:19] did you get that?
[34:20] He held his peace.
[34:22] For they must do what they are doing.
[34:25] Amen.
[34:26] And you leave them alone.
[34:27] Pray for them.
[34:28] Amen.
[34:29] Amen.
[34:30] David held his peace from good. For it's
[34:32] a revelation. By this time, it should be
[34:37] realized by this time that seed should
[34:40] have opened up sometimes 63 and shown
[34:44] you something, not gone back into the
[34:46] world.
[34:47] Amen.
[34:48] Amen.
[34:49] Well, then be spiritual. Leave it alone.
[34:52] Pray for them. Try to pull them out of
[34:54] the fire as best you can. See, but God
[34:57] must reveal it. And the best way you can
[35:00] do it is to live that life. They know it
[35:03] is real.
[35:05] Amen. You don't have to beg nobody.
[35:07] Persuade them. They know you're living.
[35:09] You come to church here. You love the
[35:11] brethren. You give up your substance.
[35:13] They know. They know it. God will make
[35:16] them know it. Amen.
[35:18] Now we find then that
[35:21] then we by faith reckon ourselves dead.
[35:26] Amen. our own lives is finished with for
[35:29] it's only in the evening time cuz back
[35:31] in Exodus they kept the lamb up the lamb
[35:34] was alive in the house that right for 14
[35:38] days that right he was alive he walked
[35:40] the earth manner and so forth humbled
[35:42] himself amen but in the evening time the
[35:45] lamb had to be slain amen
[35:48] and the people in the house had to
[35:50] identify themselves with that slain lamb
[35:54] then they must die is that
[35:56] The only way you can be identified with
[35:58] the death.
[36:00] I hope you get it.
[36:01] We die to be identified with his death
[36:06] to what? To the world and things around
[36:08] us. Then if we die and suffer, we shall
[36:12] reign with him. We shall be glorified.
[36:15] Amen. For our lives are hid with Christ
[36:18] in God.
[36:20] And when Christ appears in the
[36:22] resurrection, we shall appear also.
[36:24] Amen. Amen. But the glory of God will
[36:27] hide you from everything around and hide
[36:31] you from the world and she'll go out
[36:32] ahead and won't even see you.
[36:34] Amen.
[36:35] He'll come as a thief in the night,
[36:36] friends.
[36:38] He's coming all the time getting the
[36:39] anointing is getting stronger and
[36:41] stronger as he purges out his people. He
[36:44] knows how to do it.
[36:45] He knows how to do. He's purging right
[36:47] now
[36:48] through trials, fiery trials. Amen.
[36:52] Are you Are you following me this
[36:54] morning?
[36:54] Amen.
[36:55] Are you with me?
[36:56] Amen.
[36:57] Now, friends, this is the word in its
[37:00] season. See, we ain't preaching no great
[37:03] signs and wonders right now. Uh-uh. See,
[37:06] the word dying out, bearing about always
[37:09] the dying of the Lord in the body.
[37:11] That's the season now. That's the season
[37:13] now. When the when his glory shall
[37:15] appear, then you'll see that. See the
[37:17] bride is to be kept in step exhorted
[37:21] fear and and because they on his name
[37:23] and all these things always have an
[37:26] atmosphere of faith around you. See what
[37:28] I mean now? Now now this revelation see
[37:32] of Malachi 4 is a revelation. Revelation
[37:36] is faith. See faith is the revelation of
[37:41] God's will.
[37:42] Amen.
[37:42] Well what is God's will? that there is
[37:44] going to be a resurrection.
[37:47] There's going to be a rapture when all
[37:50] around you by their lies profess is not
[37:53] though they say it is.
[37:55] They don't live like it.
[37:56] Amen. Therefore, that's how you can
[37:58] discern. As we have returned to this
[38:02] revelation, we can discern those around
[38:05] us who fear God, who are wicked, who are
[38:08] make believers, who are false anointed
[38:10] ones, who are flesh pots in the world.
[38:12] Amen. Hey, we can discern now. Amen. As
[38:15] we we return, we can see all those
[38:17] devils running around. Amen.
[38:19] Amen.
[38:19] Are you following me now?
[38:21] Why can you see? Because God revealed it
[38:23] to you.
[38:24] That's why you can see it.
[38:26] Now, that gives you faith to live the
[38:29] word
[38:30] to do it. How can you do it other than
[38:33] faith from God?
[38:35] Therefore, you renounce the things of
[38:37] the world.
[38:37] Amen.
[38:38] You renounce them. You're pilgrim and
[38:40] strangers, holy nation, royal
[38:42] priesthood. You come from your father
[38:45] and you go back to your father. Amen.
[38:47] Amen.
[38:48] Praise God. Then the rapture is at hand.
[38:51] This is a revelation to the bride. She's
[38:53] making ready.
[38:54] Amen. She's making ready, friends. The
[38:56] bride is making ready right now. She's
[38:58] making ready. See now, this faith is a
[39:01] revelation because it has been been
[39:03] revealed to us. And like Abraham, we
[39:06] call all things contrary.
[39:08] Amen.
[39:08] Amen. For we have faith. Now, see, okay,
[39:11] the bride of this hour is built on this
[39:15] revelation. Is that right? I'm just
[39:17] reminding you now. She's built on the
[39:19] revelation that there's going to be a
[39:21] rapture, that there's going to be a
[39:23] resurrection. She knows that. She's
[39:26] making herself ready. Amen. She's
[39:29] thinking on the name of the Lord. She's
[39:31] coming together in fear of God, spakeing
[39:34] often one to another. She's because
[39:37] dying out to the world bearing about in
[39:40] her body the dying of the Lord. Amen.
[39:43] What the seed must rot.
[39:45] Amen.
[39:46] Amen.
[39:47] And bring forth life.
[39:49] Amen.
[39:50] Okay. The word must go into you sink in
[39:53] your heart
[39:55] and it will come forth life. Amen. See?
[39:58] Okay. We find then that the bride is
[40:01] built on the revelation that there is
[40:04] going to be a rapture. That was the
[40:06] whole thing. See? Okay. The seed in your
[40:10] heart open up in 63. Declare all around
[40:13] you a testimony. You follow that you
[40:16] believe the prophet's message. That's
[40:18] all you're supposed to do. You declare
[40:20] it. And he said, "Love one another.
[40:22] Therefore, you love one another." He
[40:23] said, "Come out of the world." You come
[40:24] out of the world. Amen.
[40:26] If you live in the world, come to church
[40:28] and back and forth, you prove that you
[40:31] don't have the revelation.
[40:33] There's nothing because of fight about.
[40:35] You don't have to fight over that. You
[40:36] prove it yourself. You have no desire.
[40:39] There's no seed in you there. There is
[40:42] nothing there. The seed never got a
[40:44] chance of this message to fall into your
[40:46] heart. It hit the top side of it. See
[40:48] now, but those furs didn't dig deep down
[40:51] in there. Amen. They get it planted down
[40:53] there good. See? So we find then that
[40:56] the bride then knows that judgment
[40:59] begins in God's house. That right?
[41:02] Amen.
[41:03] God said he is going to judge the
[41:05] gentile nations.
[41:07] But he cannot judge him unless he judges
[41:10] those in his own house.
[41:12] Amen. Amen.
[41:13] Well, who's in his house? Tears. The
[41:15] kingdom of heaven is like unto tears and
[41:19] wheat. Is that right? They're in God's
[41:21] house. That's who's there. So he brings
[41:23] the word on the earth through a shout in
[41:25] 63 judges all the tears, the makeel
[41:28] believers, the chaff and the bride.
[41:30] Judges everybody, but this whole thing
[41:32] is secret and nobody really knows what's
[41:35] going on since ' 63 but the bride and
[41:38] she's making herself ready. Are you
[41:40] understanding? She's making herself
[41:42] ready, friends. But it's such a humble
[41:45] simple thing that the others they don't
[41:47] know what's going on. They just other
[41:49] words some people think it's the same
[41:51] Pentecostal church. Maybe you come out
[41:53] of a Pentecostal church and maybe
[41:55] because all y'all come up together and
[41:57] you might say uh uh Joe and Hunt and
[41:59] this and that. That's in your
[42:01] Pentecostal church. You think it's the
[42:02] same thing right now cuz you don't know
[42:03] what's going on.
[42:04] You don't even understand. You might say
[42:06] Frank Nino this one that one is never
[42:09] brother and humble and thinking about
[42:12] the needs of one another. The bride is
[42:14] doing that right now.
[42:16] Amen. She's going to Christ for her
[42:18] brother. And then when she sees her
[42:19] brother delivered from the fire, she
[42:21] praises God, brother. She bring up that
[42:24] phone telling you all about it. She
[42:26] ain't cool and blas. Yeah. Praise the
[42:29] Lord. You know, uh-uh. She's fervent in
[42:31] her spirit. Amen. I mean, she shows that
[42:35] uh there's something there, life there,
[42:37] something. She's not dead. And when
[42:39] Christ comes down week after week after
[42:42] week, she's praising God the more, the
[42:43] more, the more, the more. Amen. with
[42:46] that atmosphere. He suddenly comes to
[42:48] his temple
[42:49] is building up now. Amen.
[42:51] Yes, it is, friends. Maybe you don't
[42:53] know, but I know it.
[42:54] I'm persuaded that he's doing that.
[42:56] Amen.
[42:57] Is coming, friends. Yes, sir. So, we
[42:59] find then that the bride is taking up
[43:02] her cross daily. Just Just taking my
[43:04] time. A little tired. Amen. Why she's
[43:07] taking her cross? For she knows. She's
[43:10] got a revelation that he's making up his
[43:12] jewels now.
[43:14] Amen. She knows that. She's not. Nothing
[43:17] persuades her against that. She calls
[43:20] everything else contrary. She said, "I
[43:22] am the bride."
[43:23] Amen.
[43:24] I am. And I'll show by life.
[43:26] I'll love the brethren.
[43:28] I'll pray for the needs in the assembly.
[43:31] I don't have to be called on the phone
[43:32] and say, "Well, do you want me to do
[43:35] that?"
[43:36] I mean, if God has put you in this
[43:38] assembly here to do a certain thing, no
[43:41] matter secretary, treasurer, tape,
[43:44] deacon, whatever God has given you,
[43:47] don't you wait for me to come around and
[43:49] ask you to do it. You better do it
[43:50] yourself. You better call up and find
[43:53] out how can I best do this thing myself.
[43:56] Amen.
[43:57] For if you just sitting around and
[43:58] waiting for somebody or certain brother
[44:00] to explain it to you or you can't ask
[44:03] this little humble brother because that
[44:05] would be because beneath you because
[44:07] your pride.
[44:08] Well, we have to see about that. You
[44:11] better come friends and you better not
[44:13] keep on waiting. You better come and
[44:14] find out and ask on these things.
[44:17] Somebody understands that. Amen.
[44:19] Amen.
[44:20] It's all for purpose. I hope that thing
[44:22] is driven home. So many people lack a
[44:25] dasical. Well, I don't know how I have
[44:28] to work, you know, and I haven't got
[44:30] time to do God's service. You see? So,
[44:35] let us wake up, friends. Thomas missed
[44:37] the service. Amen. There'll be many like
[44:41] Thomas as a type. The prophet of the
[44:43] Lord said that Thomas missed the
[44:44] service. He said, "But he's just
[44:46] planting seed. We're just planting
[44:48] seed." See, for he says that when these
[44:51] things which he has prophesied when they
[44:53] happen, then they come and say, "Give me
[44:55] the oil now. Now I want to do as service
[44:58] unto the Lord now." Oh, it's too late.
[45:00] Do it now. You follow me now? Do it now.
[45:03] And break that hard spirit pride. Break
[45:07] it. Let the word of God crush that thing
[45:09] and be humble and mellow and meek. The
[45:12] lowest brother, sister in your midst,
[45:15] who you think is low, serve that one.
[45:17] Amen.
[45:18] And you serve God.
[45:19] Amen.
[45:20] Amen.
[45:20] Serve that one. Don't do it for flesh
[45:23] works to glorify yourself. Many people
[45:25] like to say uh uh so many this I saved
[45:28] so many souls. I got so many prayed for
[45:30] and all that is here. Put their names up
[45:32] and everything. That's flesh works,
[45:34] friends.
[45:34] Amen.
[45:35] Humble people, they don't do that.
[45:37] Brother man said the first mark of the
[45:39] Holy Ghost is humility.
[45:42] So when I see a person on p that ain't
[45:44] God, I know it ain't God. It's not in
[45:45] the word. Yes sir. When I see somebody
[45:48] hard, cut them down. Give them see right
[45:52] now. That ain't Christ. That's a
[45:53] legalistic spirit.
[45:56] When I see husband and wives that are
[45:58] hard and this and that and they can't
[45:59] bend, something wrong with them. They
[46:01] got to come together in the fear of God
[46:03] and love one another. Illustrating
[46:06] Christ and the bride. Husband hard, wife
[46:09] hard. Something is wrong somewhere in
[46:12] this late hour 1966.
[46:15] Something is wrong. Repent
[46:18] and come to God. The word. The word.
[46:22] What shall I do in the word? Husbands
[46:23] and wives. Examine the whole word.
[46:24] Examine 1 Corinthians 7. Find out what
[46:27] you're supposed to do over there.
[46:28] Examine that over. It's right there. You
[46:30] don't have to figure it out. You It's in
[46:33] the word. Amen.
[46:34] Examine that. See, God is chastising
[46:36] right now
[46:38] because he loves you. There ain't much
[46:40] time friends for to sit around selfstyle
[46:43] way know everything and been in in this
[46:46] message a long time. God hates that is
[46:49] going to Europe to the islands to Africa
[46:52] Australia we are being judged there by
[46:55] the word. They haven't even heard it
[46:57] yet. But when one seed falls into their
[47:00] heart my God look at them run. The
[47:02] Germans right now want to put all the
[47:04] books out. They got a zeal for God.
[47:06] That's why. That's why started with
[47:08] Luther
[47:10] cuz who knows?
[47:12] Amen.
[47:12] We don't know these things. Amen. See
[47:15] so therefore we find friends that right
[47:18] now the Holy Spirit is chastising and
[47:21] rebuking because he loves you.
[47:23] He's trying to wake you up. And then you
[47:26] find that oh so and so got a burden for
[47:28] the Lord. She loves her father. She
[47:32] loves her mother. this one. Nobody else
[47:33] does because but her that's flesh.
[47:36] Amen.
[47:37] That's flesh. Do you understand that?
[47:39] Oh, no. You say she loves the Lord and
[47:41] she she does what? Mary and them loved
[47:43] the Lord also and they thought he was
[47:45] dead. Is that right? They went to they
[47:48] they thought he was dead worshiping
[47:50] Christ. A dead Christ. Amen. That was
[47:53] works worship to come to worship. See
[47:56] thought he was dead. Who going to move
[47:58] away to stone? Say amen.
[48:01] type of the church. You understand?
[48:04] I hope you get this now. Type of the
[48:05] church. Say
[48:06] amen.
[48:08] So we find then friends that
[48:10] the bride today, are you with me?
[48:12] Amen.
[48:13] She is like Rebecca.
[48:15] Genesis 18 over I think is I mean
[48:17] Genesis 24. All right.
[48:19] Okay.
[48:20] Eliza came from his father's house.
[48:23] Amen.
[48:24] Came from Isaac's father's house. He was
[48:26] a servant. All right. He came with gifts
[48:28] because to find a bride, we all know the
[48:30] story. But Eloza went to hunt that
[48:32] bride. And that bride said, "I will
[48:35] leave this world and never come back
[48:36] here again."
[48:38] Mother, father, I I'm leaving here.
[48:39] Amen.
[48:40] Amen. Now, now notice this. Now, she had
[48:44] uh because jewels of gold, jewels of
[48:46] silver, and a special raignment that she
[48:48] had to put on. That right? She put it
[48:51] on. So, she was going to meet Isaac whom
[48:54] she never saw. But yet she believed and
[48:57] rejoiced. Amen. For she knew that
[48:59] because she was going to see him. Well,
[49:01] Elozer, as he took her on that camel,
[49:04] the Holy Ghost, over the desert waste
[49:07] place through all kind of trials and so
[49:10] forth, he told her all about Isaac.
[49:13] Amen.
[49:14] Eloa told Rebecca about Isaac.
[49:18] As the prophet of the Lord has taken us,
[49:20] he's telling us all about Christ.
[49:23] Amen.
[49:24] Why? before he knows him.
[49:26] Elisa watched Isaac grow up.
[49:30] Amen.
[49:30] Amen.
[49:31] The prophet watched Christ grow up from
[49:34] 33. He knows all about it.
[49:37] Amen. He's a prophet. Amen.
[49:39] And when they got there, Amen. When they
[49:43] got there, Isaac lighted off. It was in
[49:46] the evening time. That right? The Bible
[49:48] says so. But one thing Isaac recognized
[49:53] on Rebecca and she dropped down the
[49:56] veil. Amen. Just before she saw Isaac,
[49:59] she dropped the veil. But Isaac
[50:02] recognized what did he recognize on her?
[50:04] He didn't know her. Jews of gold,
[50:07] jewels of silver, and the dress that his
[50:09] father gave her.
[50:11] Amen.
[50:13] Let it sink.
[50:14] Amen.
[50:15] Amen.
[50:16] Well, Christ said, "Shall I return? When
[50:18] I return, shall I find faith on earth?
[50:21] It'll be there. It won't be many. But
[50:24] when he returns, he will recognize
[50:27] Malachi for message
[50:29] dialed out to the world. Gold faith,
[50:33] silver redemption, and a white robe.
[50:35] Amen.
[50:36] For Eloza took that reignment that she
[50:40] might be adorned with that
[50:43] as she met Isaac. And the gold and the
[50:45] silver. Amen. When Christ comes to see
[50:48] us, we are his jewels, polished up by
[50:51] Malachi 4, cut and fit in the right
[50:54] place. Amen. All right. We put the robe
[50:57] on. Put it on. Put that robe on. Amen.
[51:01] And stay there with that faith.
[51:04] And realizing that the Holy Spirit, the
[51:07] presence of the son has wrought a work
[51:08] in you.
[51:09] Amen.
[51:11] Amen.
[51:12] Other words, and this thing was was in
[51:14] the sculpture's house. It was veiled.
[51:17] Amen. But when he took it off for the
[51:20] public showing, it was beautiful. Speak
[51:23] bride. Amen.
[51:25] Sewing on it. So because enthusiastic
[51:29] that he said speak and the bride will
[51:31] speak. Did you get that?
[51:33] Amen.
[51:33] You understand that?
[51:35] Amen. Praise God. So we find then that
[51:38] Christ will recognize the faith that his
[51:41] prophet restored
[51:43] in the bride for it's a revelation. It's
[51:46] a revelation. Amen. And she's doing it
[51:49] in the fear of God. So now we find in
[51:51] friends that the message to shout has
[51:54] called the bride together. The next
[51:58] thing to happen a loud voice is to wake
[52:00] up the dead in Christ. Anything else to
[52:02] do? If you ain't doing it now, it'd be
[52:05] too late over there. So you can sit
[52:08] around self-style and wait for somebody
[52:10] to ask you to do your own duties that
[52:13] you supposed to be doing unto the Lord.
[52:15] You can criticize it. You can don't
[52:18] think, well, brother Cole, brother
[52:19] Hunter said that I should do it this
[52:20] way, but I don't think so. God know what
[52:23] you said in your heart. I don't have to
[52:25] hear you say it. You can talk to so and
[52:27] so about me or this one that way cuz it
[52:29] doesn't bother me. You follow me now?
[52:31] But he knows what you said in your heart
[52:34] to the other person, what you think
[52:36] about it.
[52:37] He knows whether you are thick and just
[52:40] won't bend your own weight when
[52:42] somebody's trying to tell you something
[52:43] nice and soft to you. He understands
[52:45] that. Amen.
[52:47] Christ understands that. He understands
[52:49] also if you're so uh cool and uh you
[52:53] just well yeah. Hallelujah. Praise the
[52:54] Lord. You know, so cool and blas. He
[52:57] understand that also. Fervent praise to
[52:59] him. a holy priesthood off up from the
[53:04] soul to God, not the spirit's anointed.
[53:07] Hallelujah. Flesh works and scream and
[53:08] shout and dance and go downstairs and
[53:10] talk about the pastor and also your
[53:11] sister and brother and get in the car.
[53:13] You ain't fooling nobody. You ain't
[53:15] fooling cuz nobody at all. That's flesh
[53:17] works. Amen.
[53:18] Amen.
[53:19] That gets home. You know that just sinks
[53:21] deep down in there. Yes, sir. Christ the
[53:24] word chastises. You understand? See? So
[53:28] therefore the next voice, a loud voice
[53:31] that you hear will be the dead in
[53:35] Christ. A loud voice to awaken the dead
[53:37] in Christ. Then they with those who are
[53:39] alive on the earth, whatever trial is to
[53:42] come, whatever press is to be, it'll be
[53:44] here. But you better be ready. Yes, sir.
[53:47] You better be ready. But we finding that
[53:49] this message that Malachi as a testimony
[53:52] to Elijah as many are running all over
[53:55] and said, "Dear Joshua, no, you're not.
[53:57] this message. Christ Jehovah savior the
[54:01] word has prepared the bride is now doing
[54:03] it until the last one comes in. It may
[54:06] be in New Zealand. I don't know where
[54:07] it's at. I don't know where she's at.
[54:09] But when that last one comes in, that's
[54:11] when he's coming. That's when he's
[54:13] coming. Well, it could happen tomorrow.
[54:16] You follow me now? Well, God knows
[54:18] whether your heart is right. I said your
[54:20] heart is right. We all stumble and fall.
[54:23] Amen. But a perfect man bridles his
[54:25] tongue. That's what James said. A
[54:29] perfect man bridles his tongue for he
[54:31] knows that that tongue is like a fire
[54:34] and a fire has licks a flame. Jealousy
[54:37] and hate and so forth from that fire
[54:39] that tongue. Amen. It licks out of
[54:42] everybody. Amen. But the bride, she's
[54:45] humble, coming together in the fear of
[54:47] God, loving the brethren, respecting the
[54:51] ministry and one another, submitting her
[54:54] submitting herself. You may have known
[54:56] somebody all your life and said, "Well,
[54:59] see, I can't really humble myself to
[55:00] that person because because I grew up
[55:02] with them." You can't. God is no
[55:05] respective person's friends.
[55:06] Amen.
[55:07] Think on that one. Draw on that filter
[55:09] right now.
[55:10] Draw on that filter. Draw on that. Now,
[55:13] if you cannot do it, you prove what's in
[55:15] your heart. If you're laughing and
[55:18] jesting and fooling around, God knows
[55:20] what it is. I'm preaching the word of
[55:22] God to you this morning that you may
[55:23] make yourself ready. I'm preaching like
[55:26] there is no tomorrow and it's not. This
[55:29] is the day he's making up his jewels
[55:31] right now.
[55:32] Amen. So we find then friends that for
[55:35] about another 5 10 minutes or so
[55:38] Jesus said oh fools and slow of heart to
[55:41] believe all that the prophets have said
[55:44] then if we can receive that we receiving
[55:47] the message. For if we believe all, then
[55:50] the Bible says we are called to suffer.
[55:54] Is that right?
[55:55] We are called to suffer. I mean, you're
[55:58] called to that. That's your holy
[56:01] calling, your heavenly calling.
[56:04] Isn't that wonderful?
[56:04] Amen.
[56:05] That's our calling.
[56:06] Amen.
[56:06] We're called to that. We have to suffer
[56:09] in this flesh. And God knows what thing
[56:11] is in your heart to keep you from
[56:13] suffering. Some just don't want to
[56:14] suffer. They ain't going to suffer.
[56:16] They're not going to humble themselves.
[56:17] No, they refuse to do it. See, but we're
[56:20] called to it. See, so now first Peter 4,
[56:23] turn over with with me, please. First
[56:26] Peter,
[56:27] um, the fourth chapter, cuz you can get
[56:29] it. So therefore, Peter said,
[56:34] um, Paul said, if we suffer, we shall
[56:36] also reign with him. Is that right?
[56:40] Peter said over in the first chapter
[56:42] rather, of first Peter 7, the sixth
[56:44] verse.
[56:46] Now from verse 1 through verse 6,
[56:50] see Peter has the people in this epistle
[56:54] up in heaven telling about the wonderful
[56:56] things of God. Amen. Tell them that we
[56:59] have an inheritance reserved stored up
[57:03] in heaven for us. Amen. They up in
[57:05] heaven. But now when he comes down to
[57:08] the sixth verse because you have it. See
[57:12] he says speaking about the things up in
[57:14] heaven. Now wherein ye greatly rejoice,
[57:18] though now for a season if need be.
[57:21] Well, watch this. Now you see in verse
[57:24] six, he says, "Ye greatly rejoice and we
[57:28] rejoice over Malachi 4, seven seals, the
[57:31] bride, all these wonderful things."
[57:34] Amen.
[57:34] We rejoice over these things. Do you
[57:37] understand this now?
[57:38] Amen.
[57:39] We know that we're on the way to heaven.
[57:41] But listen here as Peter's saying here.
[57:44] See, though now, though you greatly
[57:47] rejoice. See, though now for a season,
[57:51] if need be, if need be, ye are in
[57:55] heaviness through manifold temptations.
[57:57] Now, let that word sink in. Now, see a
[58:00] little teaching right here. If need be.
[58:03] By who, God? Are you?
[58:05] Are you getting it now? I mean, if there
[58:08] is a need for you to have a temptation,
[58:11] I'll give it to you.
[58:13] I'll allow you to have it if need be.
[58:15] That's what he said here. Is that right?
[58:17] So, he's got him up in heaven as we all
[58:20] like to stay up there. Amen. But we have
[58:22] to come down to earth sometime
[58:24] and sort of cut a little bit. Amen. We
[58:27] have to do that. See, cuz your faith is
[58:30] on the earth.
[58:32] Amen. You got to display it down here.
[58:34] Amen. See? So therefore he says, "So
[58:36] though now for a season," see, other
[58:39] words, for our light afflictions, which
[58:41] is but for a moment, that's all for a
[58:44] season. See me now, it workketh a far
[58:47] more exceeding and eternal weight of
[58:49] glory. But if need be, you are in
[58:52] heaviness through manifold temptations.
[58:54] You see, he drops on the earth. He said,
[58:57] you may be put to various trials and
[59:01] tribulation. That That's what he's
[59:02] saying. See me now. And he says that
[59:05] this heaviness here which he's speaking
[59:07] about here is the soul your soul being
[59:11] under pressure. Amen. From things in
[59:14] this world. See this heaviness is here.
[59:17] It's got to be here friends. It's is for
[59:19] these trials which every day they come
[59:22] against you. Amen. These trials are
[59:24] here. Well then if they're here there is
[59:28] a needs be
[59:30] and God has sent it.
[59:31] Is that right? Why is he so Christ wants
[59:34] to draw out to develop what's in your
[59:38] heart. See, by these trials, for these
[59:41] trials, they purify you.
[59:44] They get you ready. Amen.
[59:46] Amen.
[59:46] So, he's making up his jewels. He's
[59:49] polishing them. He's cutting them. See
[59:51] what I mean? Now, through these trials,
[59:53] the fiery trials. Amen. So therefore God
[59:57] sees thee need be though only for a
[1:00:00] season a moment of time. This light
[1:00:03] affliction is a light affliction. That's
[1:00:04] all it is. See this tribulation works
[1:00:07] patience. Patience works experience.
[1:00:11] Experience works is hope. Is that right?
[1:00:14] Hope make it not ashamed. All right.
[1:00:18] You're a child of faith. The faith
[1:00:20] sphere is on the earth. See, God gives
[1:00:24] you a revelation of the resurrection and
[1:00:27] the rapture, right? We all have this
[1:00:29] faith. All right? Faith is a revelation
[1:00:31] of God's will. All right? He never gives
[1:00:34] faith without proving it.
[1:00:38] Amen.
[1:00:38] Amen.
[1:00:39] He never once gives faith without
[1:00:42] proving that faith.
[1:00:43] Amen.
[1:00:44] God always proves that faith.
[1:00:46] I'm trying to drive this home.
[1:00:48] Psalms 105:19 says, "Until the time that
[1:00:52] his word came, the word of the Lord
[1:00:54] tried him." Until the time that Christ
[1:00:57] came, his word which he left there tried
[1:01:00] the people. Amen.
[1:01:02] Amen.
[1:01:02] Tries you. See, and it brings forth the
[1:01:05] fruit. James 5:7, the husband has long
[1:01:09] patience waiting for his word through
[1:01:13] trials to bring forth the fruit. When it
[1:01:15] comes forth, he comes for it. Amen.
[1:01:18] You see it? And therefore, that's when
[1:01:21] everything is made manifest at his
[1:01:24] appearing. He appears as all made.
[1:01:26] There's the tears, the makeel believers,
[1:01:28] the bride. They're all standing there.
[1:01:29] It's all made manifest, friends. That's
[1:01:32] why this morning chastisement. You
[1:01:35] better receive it as a son of God. See,
[1:01:38] therefore, our type of this fiery trial
[1:01:42] is over in Daniel 3. Turn over there,
[1:01:43] please. Daniel 3. Are you still with me?
[1:01:47] Kind of quiet right now.
[1:01:49] Amen.
[1:01:51] My my But stay with me now. Amen.
[1:01:54] This is the word of God. See, if I ain't
[1:01:56] preaching the word, then something else.
[1:01:59] But I'm preaching the word. See,
[1:02:01] and only the bride receives the word.
[1:02:03] Amen.
[1:02:04] She knows he's make up his jewels.
[1:02:06] She knows that.
[1:02:07] And she has fear of God and she wants to
[1:02:09] hear these things. See?
[1:02:11] Amen. So therefore, now we have a tight
[1:02:14] for about five minutes here. The three
[1:02:16] Hebrew boys, Shadrach, Abednego, what's
[1:02:19] the other one? Khach. That's right.
[1:02:22] Well, just quickly, they had a great
[1:02:25] trial coming up, a fiery furnace. Peter
[1:02:28] says, "Think and not strange." Amen.
[1:02:30] Don't get all excited. Don't be amazed.
[1:02:33] Don't be because bewildered. You follow
[1:02:36] me now? Don't get all, "What? What?
[1:02:38] What's going on? Thinking not strange,
[1:02:40] friends. These trials must be if needs
[1:02:42] be. Amen. If needs be. Well, if you
[1:02:46] don't believe it, just look at God's
[1:02:47] prophet. Are you the same?
[1:02:51] If needs be then.
[1:02:53] Amen.
[1:02:54] Just look at that corner of wheat
[1:02:55] walking the earth. Are you like that?
[1:02:58] Well, then it it needs be.
[1:03:00] Amen.
[1:03:01] And God has his way to purify us as he's
[1:03:04] doing sit brook as he's doing all of us.
[1:03:06] He's got his way to do it in the He does
[1:03:08] it in the fiery furnace. He's our type.
[1:03:11] But before as they go into the fiery
[1:03:14] furnace, the three Hebrew boys would not
[1:03:17] defile themselves with the king's
[1:03:19] doctrine and his wine. Amen. They had a
[1:03:21] 10-day trial of waiting on the Lord.
[1:03:24] They waited on God. That right? They
[1:03:27] took pulse seed, the word, and also
[1:03:29] water. And they prayed. Is that right?
[1:03:32] Now, they had an all night prayer
[1:03:34] meeting. They were ready for the trial.
[1:03:36] Is that right?
[1:03:37] Okay. This is a type and also everyday
[1:03:39] life also. Then Nebuchadnezzar, he had a
[1:03:43] great feast and he set up an image the
[1:03:46] council you know and everybody had to
[1:03:48] fall down at the blowing of all these
[1:03:51] different instruments. All these s
[1:03:53] seducing spirits blow all kind of
[1:03:55] because doctrines out there they all
[1:03:57] fell down for them. That right. But
[1:03:59] these three Hebrew boys would not serve
[1:04:01] their gods, their idols. Amen.
[1:04:04] They were they all were because prayed
[1:04:06] up. Amen. Faith, believing God's word,
[1:04:10] knowing and ready for a trial. They were
[1:04:12] counting it joy. Amen. To go into that
[1:04:16] trial for Christ. Count it joy to suffer
[1:04:19] for him. For they were spiritual. They
[1:04:21] knew that if they suffer with him, they
[1:04:23] shall also reign with him.
[1:04:24] That they knew that. See amen now.
[1:04:26] Therefore, they were ready for a trial.
[1:04:28] They were ready to be purified.
[1:04:30] So here they were. They had the right
[1:04:32] attitude then. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:34] All according to your attitude. Amen. Do
[1:04:37] you have the right attitude this
[1:04:38] morning? Now, after you have received
[1:04:40] that because chastisement,
[1:04:42] if you have the right attitude, you'll
[1:04:44] see what happens. Many had trials back
[1:04:47] in ' 64, 65, and this year, and some
[1:04:51] would not go through that trial.
[1:04:53] Therefore, they're just wretched right
[1:04:55] now. You see? But if you can go right
[1:04:57] back to where it started at and repent
[1:04:59] right there to that spot where where you
[1:05:01] miss God, repent right there, you'll see
[1:05:04] the glory of God. Yes. In your life,
[1:05:06] it'll see your heart. You're so hard and
[1:05:08] bound. See, but Christ will soften you.
[1:05:12] Sweet. Cuz he is your husband with love.
[1:05:15] He woos you. You understand? Husband and
[1:05:17] wife illustrates it. I hope you get
[1:05:20] that. So, we find that this 10-day
[1:05:23] trial, they had this trial. Now they
[1:05:26] were ready for the trial, right? They
[1:05:28] counted joy to fall into the trial.
[1:05:30] Amen. Okay. Daniel 3:17.
[1:05:36] Shadrach, Mach, and Abednego answered
[1:05:39] and said to the king, "Oh
[1:05:40] Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to
[1:05:42] answer thee in this matter."
[1:05:45] They're telling the king, "It's not
[1:05:47] necessary for us to give you an answer
[1:05:48] at this point." It ain't necessary. You
[1:05:51] know, back there that we took the word.
[1:05:53] Amen.
[1:05:54] Is that right? and also the water. You
[1:05:56] know that we never because bow down to
[1:05:58] your gods. So you think I'm scared to go
[1:06:00] into this trial now? I'm I'm not going
[1:06:02] to serve your gods. It's not necessary
[1:06:04] for me to give you the answer.
[1:06:05] Is that right?
[1:06:06] Amen.
[1:06:07] Amen. See, he says, um, if it if it be
[1:06:11] so, our God, now get the the mind of
[1:06:15] Christ here. If it be so, is that right?
[1:06:19] Amen.
[1:06:19] I mean, God willing, what the Lord
[1:06:21] wants. Amen.
[1:06:22] This ain't no three men running up. They
[1:06:24] all puffed up. Glory to God. All gone
[1:06:27] down to the end. Hallelujah. That's all
[1:06:29] Pentecost.
[1:06:30] Amen.
[1:06:31] If it need be so.
[1:06:32] Is that right?
[1:06:34] Get that little point. If you don't get
[1:06:36] nothing this morning, get that point
[1:06:37] right there. When you face your trials,
[1:06:40] if it need be so. See, our God whom we
[1:06:44] serve is able. Now comes the faith. See,
[1:06:47] first the broken and contrite spirit of
[1:06:49] God's will. And now it's faith out. See,
[1:06:53] our God whom we serve is able to deliver
[1:06:55] us from the burning fire from it. Put it
[1:06:57] in God's hands. If God want to do it,
[1:07:00] he's able to do it. If he he may want to
[1:07:02] leave us in there
[1:07:03] and we'll stay in there.
[1:07:05] Brother Brand said, "If he send me to
[1:07:06] hell, I'll go to hell."
[1:07:08] Amen.
[1:07:08] It's a revelation.
[1:07:10] If we get that kind of revelation, we'll
[1:07:12] fear God.
[1:07:14] Amen.
[1:07:15] And he will deliver us out of thine
[1:07:17] hand, oh king. But if not, be it known
[1:07:21] unto thee, oh king, that we will not
[1:07:23] serve thy gods, nor worship the golden
[1:07:25] image which thou hast set up. Amen.
[1:07:28] That's the same thing today. Say, I will
[1:07:29] not go back into the world.
[1:07:32] I won't serve your gods, Delilah. Amen.
[1:07:36] Sams and the Philistines upon you. Is
[1:07:39] that right? All bound up hair shaven off
[1:07:41] the Nazarite covenant. Amen. But thanks
[1:07:44] be to God, there was a new crop growing
[1:07:46] up.
[1:07:47] Amen. God has a new crop growing out
[1:07:50] right now. I'll not serve your God of
[1:07:52] the world. I'll not serve the filth.
[1:07:55] I'll not serve the flesh. I'll serve
[1:07:57] Christ.
[1:07:57] Amen.
[1:07:58] Amen. If needs be, he want me to go
[1:08:01] through this trial. If needs be, Sister
[1:08:04] Sebrook must come to death's door. Let
[1:08:07] it be done.
[1:08:09] You understand this now? If needs be, if
[1:08:13] God is pleased to do it that way, if God
[1:08:17] wants to reveal Christ through her in
[1:08:19] the hospital, let God do it.
[1:08:22] How do you know there's a doctor up
[1:08:24] there that didn't see the glory of God?
[1:08:26] Amen.
[1:08:26] What do we know about that? Amen.
[1:08:28] If needs be. When we approach her trial
[1:08:32] this way, we have understanding.
[1:08:34] And our old trials, we have,
[1:08:37] excuse me. Amen.
[1:08:38] Amen. So we find then friends that as we
[1:08:41] see see if God is pleased if it's his
[1:08:45] will. See always find God's will first.
[1:08:49] See then the three Hebrew boys took up
[1:08:52] their cross suffered and followed
[1:08:55] Christ. Amen. Into that fire furnace
[1:08:58] they went. But now look what happened in
[1:09:01] the furnace.
[1:09:03] They had to go through a great
[1:09:04] suffering.
[1:09:06] Great suffering. Great grace,
[1:09:09] great grace, great power. Amen.
[1:09:13] Amen. Noah,
[1:09:16] Moses, the prophets, Christ, Peter,
[1:09:20] Paul, Arinius, Polycarp, those millions
[1:09:24] of Christians would cross up on their
[1:09:26] backs going into the lion's den. Amen.
[1:09:29] Great suffering for Christ. Took up
[1:09:31] their cross and followed Christ. They
[1:09:34] didn't complain, moan, and I can't do
[1:09:36] this. I can't do that. There. They took
[1:09:37] up their cross and they followed Christ.
[1:09:39] Amen. On down through the ages. And
[1:09:42] God's prophet 33 years he suffered.
[1:09:45] Amen.
[1:09:46] For the Lord. But I will be healed. I
[1:09:49] will ride a trail one more time. I will
[1:09:51] be well. I will walk into a perfect
[1:09:53] church. Amen. So we find out then that
[1:09:56] everybody has suffered
[1:09:59] except the Leodysian church
[1:10:01] where we come out of. Well, God has
[1:10:04] washed our minds from that kind of
[1:10:05] spirit. We're ready now. Amen.
[1:10:08] To speak often one to another to have
[1:10:11] the in the fear of God. Amen. To think
[1:10:14] on his name, to think on his goodness.
[1:10:16] We worship God. We are rather worship
[1:10:20] God in this way called heresy today.
[1:10:23] Amen.
[1:10:24] We appear them. Thought it was
[1:10:26] tremendous to be beaten for the Lord.
[1:10:29] Is that right? Amen.
[1:10:30] Paul was in jail. Paul sat there with
[1:10:33] his friend. And there he exercised his
[1:10:36] holy priesthood. He praised God. He sang
[1:10:40] songs of Zion. He was a holy priesthood
[1:10:43] from the soul to God. Lord, if needs be,
[1:10:47] and it was
[1:10:48] for he want to save the Philippian
[1:10:50] jailer.
[1:10:51] If needs be. Amen. It was. Paul had to
[1:10:55] go through that trial for God put him
[1:10:57] there. Lord, let thy will be done. And
[1:11:00] his back was beaten with stripes. Amen.
[1:11:02] But he praised God.
[1:11:04] When the Philippian, there was an
[1:11:05] earthquake. The Philippian jailer come
[1:11:07] running. He said, it's all right. We're
[1:11:09] here. Royal priesthood.
[1:11:11] Amen. We here.
[1:11:13] Now, Christ through this mercy will give
[1:11:15] you because eternal life.
[1:11:17] Royal priesthood. I have I come from my
[1:11:19] father. I have life for you.
[1:11:21] Amen. Come on.
[1:11:23] And he repented. Thou cast believe thy
[1:11:25] thy whole household shall be saved
[1:11:28] if needs be.
[1:11:29] Amen.
[1:11:30] Amen.
[1:11:30] Amen.
[1:11:31] See, find out God's will. When you get
[1:11:34] into that trial, rejoice. Not just
[1:11:36] running there without understanding now.
[1:11:38] But I pray this morning. We have
[1:11:39] understanding when when we leave here.
[1:11:42] We know why the trial is if needs be.
[1:11:44] See? So great suffering, great grace,
[1:11:49] great power, they all go together. That
[1:11:52] right? You see? Okay. Now, quickly, the
[1:11:56] fire was heated seven times hotter. Why?
[1:11:59] To magnify God.
[1:12:02] Your trial magnifies God.
[1:12:05] The hotter it is, the more it magnifies
[1:12:07] Christ.
[1:12:08] The more grace you'll have, the more
[1:12:10] power you'll have, the weaker you get
[1:12:12] and the more strength you'll have. Amen.
[1:12:14] It mag it don't magnify you cuz you
[1:12:16] can't get out of there.
[1:12:18] Amen.
[1:12:19] How could they get out of that fire?
[1:12:21] Heated seven times hotter. They couldn't
[1:12:23] get her out of there. So who did the
[1:12:25] magnifying Christ?
[1:12:27] Who is Sus Cbrooks trial magnifying
[1:12:29] Christ? She can't get out of there
[1:12:30] unless he bring her out of there.
[1:12:32] But she's there as a holy priesthood
[1:12:34] sending her praises to God. Thank you,
[1:12:36] Lord.
[1:12:37] What do you think those three Hebrew
[1:12:38] boys did in that fire, brother? They
[1:12:40] blessed God's name in there.
[1:12:42] Exactly right. They sang praises of God.
[1:12:45] Yes, sir. And notice now they put on
[1:12:47] robes. They put everything on them and
[1:12:49] they bound them. That right? They bound
[1:12:51] them up. cords. Amen.
[1:12:53] But they put on all the clothes because
[1:12:55] knowing that soon as all the robe was
[1:12:57] on, they would catch fire immediately.
[1:12:59] Is that right? You see?
[1:13:01] And then they went into their trial. Now
[1:13:03] notice now let's get the effect of this
[1:13:07] trial and maybe we'll have understand
[1:13:09] this morning. Now what was the effect of
[1:13:12] the fire? It burned off the cords. That
[1:13:17] right? And set them free.
[1:13:19] Amen.
[1:13:21] Amen.
[1:13:22] Hey, it's very simple.
[1:13:24] It burn off the chords. How many of us
[1:13:26] this morning are bound by something?
[1:13:29] I know the word is a trial this morning
[1:13:31] to you.

[1:13:33] He's there. His presence in that word.
[1:13:35] Going into it. See, going into it. Going
[1:13:37] into it.
[1:13:38] He's there. See, enter into that fiery
[1:13:42] trial.
[1:13:43] He ain't on the outside in the flesh.
[1:13:45] He's in there.
[1:13:47] That's his secret way of purging us out.
[1:13:49] All of us. That's how he does it,
[1:13:51] friends. So, what was the effect of the
[1:13:53] fire? It only burn off the cords. Bound
[1:13:57] them up. You follow me now? And set them
[1:13:59] free. All right. God lets us get into
[1:14:02] the fire. The effect is to burn off of
[1:14:06] your bindings, whatever you're in. Some
[1:14:09] of us get into our own selves. You
[1:14:11] follow me now? But he loves you. I He
[1:14:14] loves you. We do it stubbornly. Amen.
[1:14:18] Amen. But he loves you. But he can only
[1:14:21] get you to go into it, he can set you
[1:14:24] free.
[1:14:25] Amen. And the hotter that trial gets,
[1:14:28] brother, I save some of our people right
[1:14:30] here. One right here. He's in a hot
[1:14:32] trial right now. He's there with you.
[1:14:34] Amen. He's right there with you. I saw
[1:14:36] brother Nino back here for he was barely
[1:14:38] for a whole seven, eight months there
[1:14:40] because from last year up to now, he was
[1:14:42] with him all the time purifying him. And
[1:14:43] also his wife, others sitting all around
[1:14:45] here. Brother Kurt saw him going through
[1:14:47] a tremendous trial. God brought him
[1:14:49] through it. Amen. Brother Diet, all the
[1:14:51] people and all the sisters here with the
[1:14:54] unsaved husbands, he's there in your
[1:14:56] trial, sister. Amen. And the harder it
[1:14:58] gets, he's going to magnify himself so
[1:15:02] you can't get out of it. Amen.
[1:15:04] You may think cuz your husband won't
[1:15:06] never serve God. Well, God will make
[1:15:08] that fire hotter and hotter and hotter
[1:15:10] and higher. Amen. He is in that fire
[1:15:14] with you. Amen.
[1:15:15] See, the Bible says, "So, they looked in
[1:15:18] there and they saw one like the son of
[1:15:21] God."
[1:15:22] That's what the Bible says.
[1:15:23] One like the son of God was in the
[1:15:26] midst. And those dirty devils that push
[1:15:29] them in there, God kill them.
[1:15:34] So, though they hurl slurs at you,
[1:15:38] though they talk against you, all manner
[1:15:40] of evil up against you, God will kill
[1:15:43] them. Let them alone.
[1:15:44] Did you get that?
[1:15:46] Amen.
[1:15:48] Those who woe into those that would harm
[1:15:51] the least of mine. Better that a
[1:15:54] millstone hung around his neck. Those
[1:15:56] that push you into a trial. Don't fret
[1:15:59] over those evil workers. They pushed
[1:16:02] them into the fire, didn't they? The
[1:16:03] fire burned them up. Is that right?
[1:16:06] I hope you got that now.
[1:16:08] Amen.
[1:16:09] Amen.
[1:16:11] Praise the Lord. So we find in that one
[1:16:14] more thing in that fire.
[1:16:17] What did they have in that fire? One
[1:16:20] like the son of God. Amen. Well, what do
[1:16:23] we have? A sense of the presence and the
[1:16:25] company of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:27] Amen.
[1:16:29] Amen.
[1:16:31] Hallelujah.
[1:16:32] His presence is in that trial with you.
[1:16:35] He's right there. His company is there.
[1:16:38] He's with you. He's a present help in
[1:16:41] the time of your trial
[1:16:43] if needs be
[1:16:44] and it needs be. Therefore, he did it.
[1:16:46] He allowed it to happen. He's there
[1:16:49] for he wants to fellowship with you.
[1:16:51] Is that right?
[1:16:53] Fellowship. Paul said that I might know
[1:16:55] him and the fellowship of his
[1:16:57] sufferings.
[1:16:59] Only in your trials can you fellowship
[1:17:01] with Christ.
[1:17:03] Amen.
[1:17:04] Amen.
[1:17:05] Amen.
[1:17:06] always bearing about the dying of the
[1:17:08] Lord in your body. For the world don't
[1:17:11] know what's going on. There's a secret
[1:17:13] work going inside of your heart. Don't
[1:17:16] you realize, friends, that back in
[1:17:17] Israel's day at the tabernacle, a
[1:17:20] witness had no windows.
[1:17:22] Did you get that there? Israel couldn't
[1:17:24] look in there, but inside the high
[1:17:28] priest was offering up praises to God.
[1:17:30] Amen. There was a worship going on
[1:17:32] inside. in Israel out in the flesh never
[1:17:35] saw it.
[1:17:37] Well, they cannot see what's going on in
[1:17:39] your heart right now between you and
[1:17:40] God.
[1:17:42] There's a line there, a communication
[1:17:43] setup. Amen.
[1:17:45] As long as you praise him and thank him
[1:17:47] and bless his wonderful name, they can't
[1:17:49] see it. They may push you into a fire,
[1:17:52] they'll burn up, he's with you.
[1:17:55] So, all things work together to the good
[1:17:59] of them that love the Lord.
[1:18:01] He makes it all work together. Amen.
[1:18:03] Amen.
[1:18:04] Praise his name.
[1:18:06] So, we finding that Christ walked with
[1:18:09] them in their trial and they had a
[1:18:12] fellowship of his sufferings like they
[1:18:13] never had before. I've seen my own wife
[1:18:16] here and Sister Lawson, Sister Phyllis
[1:18:18] go through trials and I've seen them
[1:18:20] come out pure being purified. Purified.
[1:18:23] They're getting to know Christ more. A
[1:18:25] personal affair. Sister Sebrook is
[1:18:28] laying there. She met God in her trial.
[1:18:32] She was fellowshipping with Christ in
[1:18:34] her sufferings. Still is, but he's
[1:18:36] bringing her through. She may shake. She
[1:18:38] may tremble. What is that to thee?
[1:18:41] Follow thou me. Amen.
[1:18:44] Amen.
[1:18:45] What is that to you? I'm with her. I was
[1:18:48] with them in the fiery furnace. I was
[1:18:50] with Daniel in the lion's den. Amen. I
[1:18:53] was with Israel when they crossed over.
[1:18:55] I fought the enemies. Amen. I'll do it
[1:18:57] myself. Don't you worry about it. Don't
[1:19:00] look at no trembling and shaking. I'm
[1:19:02] purifying you.
[1:19:04] Don't you know that they put gold in a
[1:19:06] fire? The gold never loses its weight,
[1:19:09] nor his color, nor his properties.
[1:19:13] Amen.
[1:19:14] It's pure. Well, I put those three
[1:19:17] Hebrew boys in the fire. Their clothes
[1:19:19] was still there. They didn't lose one
[1:19:21] bit of their clothes. Their hair wasn't
[1:19:23] even singed. And their clothes didn't
[1:19:25] even smell of fire. Amen.
[1:19:28] Then what have you lost in your trial?
[1:19:31] You come closer and closer to God.
[1:19:33] That's what happens.
[1:19:35] Amen.
[1:19:35] Amen.
[1:19:36] You're closer and closer with Christ.
[1:19:40] Always bearing about in your body.
[1:19:42] Beloved, think it not strange. Amen.
[1:19:44] Don't think it's strange. Don't be
[1:19:46] amazed and be all scared. Walk down that
[1:19:49] Emmas road. What happened here? You have
[1:19:52] a communication. The word of God.
[1:19:54] Amen. There's your communications.
[1:19:56] Therefore, let us be like those that
[1:19:58] remnant back there, brother, when they
[1:20:00] caught that revelation. They feared God.
[1:20:02] They thought on his holiness, his name,
[1:20:04] and they walked, is that right? And they
[1:20:06] spake often one to another. I've seen
[1:20:08] the sisters calling one another talking
[1:20:10] about Christ. God bless be on both ends.
[1:20:13] Amen.
[1:20:14] Brethren coming together in the fear of
[1:20:16] God. The deacons, the elders coming
[1:20:17] together in Christ. If a brother get out
[1:20:20] of the way, we want to know about it. We
[1:20:22] want to hear the praise about it when
[1:20:24] something happens. Somebody repents
[1:20:25] glorify God. Somebody pull out of the
[1:20:27] fire.
[1:20:28] The other fire. Amen. Glorify God on
[1:20:31] that friends. So we find in that we
[1:20:33] don't stag around with unbelief. Peter
[1:20:35] said over here because in closing
[1:20:39] uh 1 Peter 4, he said over here in
[1:20:41] closing, beloved strange 13th verse, but
[1:20:45] rejoice in so much as you are partakers
[1:20:48] of Christ's sufferings. You follow me?
[1:20:50] Now Jesus said, "I am come that you
[1:20:51] might have life more abundantly." Where
[1:20:53] you going to get it at? I triumph over
[1:20:56] powers and principalities on the cross.
[1:20:59] That's where you going to get it at.
[1:21:00] Amen. So we find is only on the cross
[1:21:03] can you know the victory of Jesus Christ
[1:21:05] on the cross. That's where you know the
[1:21:08] victory over powers and principles out
[1:21:11] here. You follow me now? And therefore
[1:21:14] our bodies they are now hanging out here
[1:21:15] in the world. They're just hanging out
[1:21:17] here. Put to a slow death. Crucifixion
[1:21:19] means slow death. We are slowly dying
[1:21:21] day by day. Amen. It's a slow death
[1:21:24] friends. And sometimes it got to come
[1:21:26] hard sometimes. Amen. Sometimes you see.
[1:21:29] But you must die. You must die for to
[1:21:32] live as Christ. That's that's what
[1:21:34] Paul's saying, you see. So, as we on the
[1:21:37] cross this morning, seated in heavenly
[1:21:41] places with Christ, we drop down on the
[1:21:43] earth with faith. As we move through the
[1:21:46] earth, you see it now, we're up there
[1:21:47] with him. See, in heavenly places, our
[1:21:50] bodies are here. Our spirit is there.
[1:21:52] See, mind affection is on things above.
[1:21:55] But as we walk in this body is dying,
[1:21:58] bearing about the dying of the Lord. And
[1:22:00] by faith, we do this.
[1:22:02] Amen. We overcome by faith. Lord, if
[1:22:05] needs be, if I have to have a trial, if
[1:22:06] it's your will, okay, Lord,
[1:22:09] go on. Amen. Sacrifice like sheep led to
[1:22:12] the sword all the day long.
[1:22:14] That's what That's what the Bible says.
[1:22:16] Amen. You see, for it pleased God to
[1:22:20] reveal, see, the dying of his son in
[1:22:24] you, the bride. He wanted the world to
[1:22:27] see Malachi 4, a message, the word all
[1:22:31] over again. And as you die, the world
[1:22:33] sees that the dying of the Lord in your
[1:22:36] body. He said, I will have a bride, she
[1:22:38] got to die that she might have life. If
[1:22:41] she suffer with me, she shall reign with
[1:22:43] me. Amen. So if Paul, Peter said over
[1:22:46] here, if you be reproached, I mean, if
[1:22:49] God would allow you to go into the fire,
[1:22:53] bless his wonderful name. counted joy
[1:22:56] for God thought it fit for you to suffer
[1:22:59] for him to be a fellowship with his
[1:23:02] sufferings. Think on that. Purify you.
[1:23:05] Amen.
[1:23:06] Amen.
[1:23:06] Yes, sir. Think on it. It pleased God
[1:23:09] for you to be here this morning.
[1:23:11] Amen.
[1:23:11] To hear how you can be glorified with
[1:23:14] him if you die with him first. Amen.
[1:23:18] We reckon ourselves then. We don't have
[1:23:20] to die physically. I understand because
[1:23:22] you spiritually. Amen.
[1:23:24] So we find friends that when we are
[1:23:26] dying, Paul said, why? That the life
[1:23:29] might be made manifest in our body.
[1:23:32] Well, Peter says the same thing right
[1:23:33] here. If you be reproached for the name
[1:23:35] of Christ, what's the name of Christ?
[1:23:37] Goodness and mercy and truth and
[1:23:39] sincerity. If you do that, if you are
[1:23:41] reproached because you're that and they
[1:23:42] think you're silly or something. You
[1:23:44] follow me now? Cuz you're stupid.
[1:23:46] Because you love people and you're on a
[1:23:48] con man. You follow me now? If you are
[1:23:50] reproached for that, see, always trying
[1:23:52] to do right, always busy all the time.
[1:23:55] If you sit around think it's funny
[1:23:56] because somebody's busy all the time,
[1:23:58] then you are being reproached for that.
[1:24:00] See, they don't understand the thing.
[1:24:01] See, happy are ye for the spirit of
[1:24:05] glory. Amen. Rest upon you. You see me
[1:24:09] now. God is what's the spirit of glory?
[1:24:11] The anointing of Christ is on you.
[1:24:14] You're walking in the fear of God. Lord,
[1:24:16] thy will be done. You're anointed. with
[1:24:19] the Holy Ghost. The more you die, more
[1:24:22] anointing. That's right.
[1:24:25] Brother Ram Prod, he walked with such a
[1:24:27] tremendous anointing. He was here, you
[1:24:29] could feel him when you come in that
[1:24:30] door there. It's all over here.
[1:24:31] Anointing of God all over the man. Well,
[1:24:33] he was dead to this world. Build your
[1:24:36] hopes on things eternal. Amen. Hold to
[1:24:39] God's unchanging hand. You see me now?
[1:24:41] Amen.
[1:24:42] That's what it is. Build your hopes on
[1:24:43] things because eternal. See? So
[1:24:44] therefore we find then friends that
[1:24:46] Christ is revealing his life through us
[1:24:50] in this season and in this time. It's a
[1:24:52] dying in the body as we do this dying
[1:24:54] out to the world. Pilgrims and strangers
[1:24:57] following Christ. The prophet said we
[1:24:59] are the gates are about to be open in
[1:25:01] the millennial kingdom. They're almost
[1:25:03] open. So we almost we go into the land.
[1:25:06] That's our land over there for a
[1:25:08] thousand years to sit down with Christ.
[1:25:11] Fellowship in his glory this time.
[1:25:14] Amen.
[1:25:15] Fellowship with his glory. Reign with
[1:25:18] him. Amen. If we deny the lust of the
[1:25:21] flesh, we reign with him. In the
[1:25:24] millennial kingdom, when the prophet
[1:25:25] said the gates are about to be opened,
[1:25:27] so say Moses, so say I.
[1:25:29] Amen.
[1:25:30] That's what he said.
[1:25:31] Amen.
[1:25:33] So we find friends then that when the
[1:25:35] glory of God appears on the earth, it'll
[1:25:38] break every feeder. Amen. every shackle.
[1:25:41] Amen. It'll kick Satan out of the
[1:25:44] heavens. Amen. And when he comes on the
[1:25:46] earth, you're like little David.
[1:25:49] Amen. No condemnation to them or in
[1:25:52] Christ Jesus who are led by the spirit
[1:25:54] of God. You don't feel nothing. You feel
[1:25:57] clean through the word of God. You come
[1:25:59] in his name. No other gods hanging up on
[1:26:01] you.
[1:26:02] You step out there purified and clean.
[1:26:04] Amen. And then whatever he has ordained
[1:26:07] for that hour, I don't know. Whatever
[1:26:09] trial it is, there'll be one like the
[1:26:11] son of God in the midst. Amen.
[1:26:14] Though it be seven times higher,
[1:26:17] you understand this now? Though that
[1:26:19] press, whatever that press is, it'll
[1:26:21] magnify God for only he can bring us
[1:26:23] through it.
[1:26:24] Amen.
[1:26:25] Praise God.
[1:26:26] Praise our God. So therefore, friends,
[1:26:28] let us rejoice in our fiery trials, for
[1:26:32] it workketh in us a weight and also
[1:26:34] glory far more exceedingly and also joy
[1:26:37] for us. So therefore, friend, let us be
[1:26:40] mindful of these things, lest we let it
[1:26:43] slip. You see, let us come together in
[1:26:45] the fear of God. Remember, we are holy
[1:26:48] priests, royal priesthood, a holy
[1:26:50] priest. That's why we ask you to sing in
[1:26:52] here. for you exercising your own right
[1:26:55] as a holy priest from your soul up to
[1:26:57] God. Right now, there's a ministry going
[1:27:00] forth which Christ is doing it himself
[1:27:02] to you to to your souls. He's feeding
[1:27:04] your souls through a ministry. I ain't
[1:27:06] got anything to do with it at all. It's
[1:27:07] a gift of God and he operates it. You
[1:27:10] follow me now? Malachi 4, which we are
[1:27:14] exhorting you about right now. His
[1:27:16] message, that's all I'm doing. bringing
[1:27:18] reminding you of these things, trying to
[1:27:19] keep in step. This little flock right
[1:27:21] here, keep you in step cuz you're
[1:27:23] already justified already. Did you get
[1:27:25] that? You're already clean already. See,
[1:27:28] in his mind, but when he comes, he wants
[1:27:30] to see that Malachi 4 faith which is
[1:27:32] gold, silver, and also Raymond. See, he
[1:27:35] recognized that only. That's why it's
[1:27:37] the prophet's message. You see it now?
[1:27:39] So therefore, we know this, friends.
[1:27:42] Whatever has been said this morning,
[1:27:44] take it, receive it.
[1:27:47] Now remember that now take it and
[1:27:48] receive it. There's no big U's little
[1:27:50] eyes is Christ.
[1:27:54] Listen, excuse me. Christ didn't give a
[1:27:56] greater portion of his spirit to sister
[1:27:58] so and so because in the other one cuz
[1:28:00] if he did then he would because be
[1:28:01] divided. He gave the same amount to all
[1:28:04] of you. You follow me now? The same
[1:28:06] amount. If if there's a ministry then he
[1:28:08] anoints that ministry to bring forth
[1:28:10] something from him to your soul. But
[1:28:13] women and men and children all have the
[1:28:15] same portion. One God. See, you
[1:28:18] understand this now? All right, friends.
[1:28:19] No matter what trial we go into, let's
[1:28:22] turn to page 276. Let us remember
[1:28:26] where he leads us, we will follow. Amen.
[1:28:30] Let us worship God now as a holy
[1:28:34] priesthood. Amen. A royal nation. Do you
[1:28:36] love him?
[1:28:37] Praise his name.
[1:28:40] Where he leads me, I will follow. Now
[1:28:43] you understand why you should follow
[1:28:44] him. for he'll be with you in your
[1:28:46] trial.
[1:28:49] Let us praise God.
[1:28:51] I can hear
[1:28:55] my savior
[1:28:58] call.
[1:29:02] I can hear
[1:29:04] myior
[1:29:08] call.
[1:29:11] I can hear
[1:29:14] my savior
[1:29:17] calling.
[1:29:19] [Music]
[1:29:21] Take thy cross
[1:29:24] and
[1:29:31] open up your hearts and sing to God.
