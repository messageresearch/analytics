[1:02] Simon Peter. a servant and an apostle of
[1:04] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[1:06] like precious faith with us through the
[1:08] righteousness of God and our Savior
[1:10] Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be
[1:12] multiplied unto you through the
[1:14] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,
[1:16] according as his divine power hath given
[1:18] unto us all things that pertain unto
[1:21] life and godliness, through the
[1:23] knowledge of him that hath called us to
[1:24] glory and virtue. whereby are given unto
[1:28] us exceeding great and precious
[1:29] promises, that by these ye might be
[1:32] partakers of the divine nature, having
[1:34] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:37] world through lust.
[1:39] And beside this, giving all diligence,
[1:42] add to your faith virtue, and to virtue
[1:46] knowledge, and to knowledge, temperance,
[1:49] and to temperance patience, and to
[1:52] patience godliness, and to godliness
[1:55] brotherly kindness, and to brotherly
[1:57] kindness charity.
[2:00] For if these things be in you and
[2:03] abound, they make you that ye shall
[2:05] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[2:08] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:23] Upon brother Co,
[2:25] we also lay our hands. Hallelujah. As
[2:28] witnesses, Lord, to give sanction to his
[2:31] call that we, this church, this group of
[2:33] people believe in him as a servant of
[2:36] Christ. And we ask that you bless him
[2:39] and give him a great mighty ministry
[2:42] that he will win souls to the Lord and
[2:44] deliver the captives and break the
[2:48] powers of Satan down the lives of the
[2:50] people that he associates with. Give to
[2:53] him a fruitful life.
[2:56] And two, when he comes to the end of the
[2:58] road, God grant that he can look down a
[3:01] long trail and see where by the grace of
[3:03] Jesus Christ, he's been able to break
[3:05] every letter of the enemy to honor God.
[3:14] He wants gallant man won't pay no
[3:16] attention to nothing what the Lord says.
[3:19] That's the kind he has to move with. If
[3:22] he said seven thunders, well, say it.
[3:24] Don't be a coward.
[3:27] the whole world.
[3:29] So what God said so my word shall not
[3:33] return to me void.
[3:37] [Music]
[3:40] I tell you one thing, brother. And
[3:42] brother Brandham stood for brother Hunt
[3:44] N after the third exodus. And some of
[3:47] you old times remember how the country
[3:48] was in ' 63 with Martin Luther King. And
[3:51] that prophet stood up there and ordained
[3:53] Brother Hunt N. And I turned around and
[3:55] he said, "Turn around, face the people."
[3:57] I had to put my head down. I said, "My
[3:59] God, if the prophet would do this here
[4:00] against the current thinking and I
[4:03] didn't know that he had just preached
[4:04] the third exodus and things he said
[4:05] there cuz the tape it was a week later."
[4:08] Amen. And there was such a hatred and I
[4:11] don't know what they I couldn't even
[4:12] look. Amen. And I vowed in my heart if
[4:16] that prophet would ordain brother Hunt
[4:18] and I in front of all these people here,
[4:21] Lord, give me the opportunity.
[4:24] Give me the chance to face him right in
[4:27] their face to tell them thus sayeth the
[4:30] Lord what that prophet said. He stood
[4:32] for me and I'm standing for him today
[4:36] with his message.
[4:39] I don't care who they are.
[4:44] God said so.
[5:02] gracious. Good afternoon to one and all
[5:04] the
[5:06] certainly good to be back up once again
[5:10] to see all the sweet people of God. And
[5:12] uh as we were coming up in the car, I
[5:14] was just sitting there thinking how we
[5:18] are blessed by God today to be called
[5:22] into this end time message. Amen.
[5:24] Through no goodness of ours, God has
[5:27] called us his election. We cannot do
[5:30] anything about it at all. We have been
[5:31] elected by God to come into this
[5:35] message. And through this message, we
[5:37] come into the bride. Amen. But there's
[5:40] only one thing that we have to do. We
[5:41] have to believe this is faith. Amen.
[5:44] Because faith is a substance of things
[5:48] hoped for. So therefore, the substance
[5:51] is something that you have that is
[5:53] tangible. You already have it. Amen.
[5:55] Well, therefore, all the promises of God
[5:57] which you because because what you're
[5:59] hoping for, you already have them if
[6:02] thou can't believe. Amen. Amen. And also
[6:05] is the evidence of things not seen. So
[6:08] therefore, you don't have to see it cuz
[6:10] you already have it. Amen. And that's
[6:12] what we have to believe in this message
[6:15] otherwise. But this message is faith,
[6:18] deliverance, and healing. That's the
[6:21] message which God's prophet William
[6:23] Brandon is bringing to us in this end
[6:25] time. Faith, deliverance, and healing.
[6:29] And it really is a blessed privilege to
[6:31] be able to be in this message and
[6:34] walking in this life. Amen. And I like
[6:36] to give my personal little testimony to
[6:39] the Lord. I love the Lord with all my
[6:41] heart, soul, mind, and body. And I thank
[6:44] the Lord how in the short space of time
[6:46] what he has done through my life in my
[6:49] life. And I thank him how he brought me
[6:52] out of what we what we call Pentecost
[6:54] and brought me into this marvelous
[6:56] light. And I believe as we were talking
[6:59] in the car that he that receiveth a
[7:01] prophet in the name of a prophet shall
[7:05] receive a prophet's reward.
[7:08] Thank you. I didn't question anything. I
[7:10] didn't doubt it. I didn't reason.
[7:12] Brother Hunt and I, Sister, we believed
[7:15] it. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[7:18] today. Hallelujah. I don't believe that,
[7:20] but I do. I don't know what it was. It's
[7:22] something in me. It was the gift of God.
[7:24] Amen. Cuz every good and perfect gift
[7:26] come from above. So therefore,
[7:28] everything, every grace comes from God.
[7:31] It's uh something that is already in
[7:33] you. You cannot reach out and grab it
[7:35] and stick it in. It comes from the
[7:37] inside out. And that is the essence of
[7:40] my message this morning. And I like to
[7:43] thank the Lord how he led us by his
[7:46] spirit and took us down to Indiana cuz
[7:50] there we met God's prophet and he spoke
[7:53] to us. He took us into his home into his
[7:55] den and he also there he prayed for us
[7:58] and he prayed that we would have the
[8:01] dictates of our heart. Now I claimed it
[8:04] right then and there. I have not been
[8:06] the same sex. Amen. Hallelujah.
[8:08] Hallelujah. Our Lord is all over me.
[8:15] Then at a specified time, he breaks the
[8:18] seventh seal. The anointing comes down.
[8:20] It runs down all over his body all over.
[8:23] That is the Catholic stone. Amen. Amen.
[8:26] It caps the pyramid. Amen. And how or
[8:30] when Christ with that same anointing
[8:32] went to heaven and told his disciple,
[8:35] I'll send it back to you. Is that right?
[8:36] Amen. And then one day in the upper room
[8:39] came a sound like a rushing mighty the
[8:42] pillar of fire, the dove, the anointing
[8:44] came into that room and I and ped itself
[8:48] in tong.
[8:49] Then then he did it then. He said at
[8:52] Malachi 4, I will restore, sayeth the
[8:55] Lord. And I'll do the very same thing
[8:58] again
[8:59] yesterday, today, and forever. Lord,
[9:01] I'll do the same thing again. Therefore,
[9:03] I'll send my prophet. He'll be according
[9:06] to Malachi 4 and5. I'll send the
[9:08] anointing. It'll pour all over him, all
[9:10] over you, every all over everybody.
[9:12] It'll be the fire, the dove, the
[9:13] anointing, the burning bush. It'll be
[9:16] Jesus Christ himself. Amen. That's what
[9:19] it'll be. Amen. What is it? Alpha and
[9:22] Omega. The same in the beginning and in
[9:24] the end. Same thing. Same thing. Can you
[9:27] see it? Well, then that is Malachi 4
[9:29] being made manifest. Amen. to the bride
[9:32] of Jesus Christ. That is perfection.
[9:35] Amen. Amen.
[9:40] See, force
[9:43] comes from man's spirit. See, man's
[9:47] force is man's human spirit putting
[9:51] forth its little energies.
[9:54] Amen. Amen. Here's man's spirit right
[9:56] here. It puts forth its own attributes,
[10:00] little energies such as mental, verbal,
[10:04] physical. You understand it now? To
[10:06] attain its own end, what it thinks. See
[10:11] now meekness is God's spirit reigning in
[10:16] the man. Amen. See, now this man, if
[10:21] meekness is in you, the man first dies
[10:24] to self. Amen. to verbal, mental,
[10:29] physical. He dies to that. You're
[10:31] already a Christian. The cross. Amen.
[10:34] You've been to the cross. You say you're
[10:36] a Christian. You say that you have ally
[10:39] meekness in you. Amen. Well, then you
[10:42] have died to self.
[10:44] Amen. Amen. Either Christ is reigning on
[10:47] the throne of your heart or he's not.
[10:49] Amen. Who's reigning there? Amen. I know
[10:52] it's kind of cutting, but it's supposed
[10:54] to be. Amen. Amen. Praise God. Amen.
[10:57] Then we must die to self and self's
[11:02] attitude.
[11:04] Amen. Amen. How's your attitude in here?
[11:13] Thy word, oh Lord, is settled forever in
[11:16] heaven. Thy word shall not return void.
[11:19] While this is a great hour, though we
[11:22] have sorrow now, it shall be turned into
[11:24] joy. I believe
[11:27] now Lord that scene even now great is
[11:30] the shout of the king and the king.
[11:33] Do you believe that? Amen. That's going
[11:35] on now. Thank you Lord. So now I like to
[11:40] title this the shout of the king. It's
[11:42] going to be a shout and we want to and
[11:44] we notice here that that three things
[11:47] are here that is said here that there's
[11:49] a shout that there's a voice of the
[11:51] archangel and there's a trump of God.
[11:54] That right? So then a great power came
[11:57] and changed Abraham and Sarah's body and
[12:00] they went back. They were resurrected
[12:03] back to the way they were young people
[12:05] and Abraham lived on also have because
[12:08] he had more children. Amen. Way after
[12:10] that. All right. Amen. Amen. So we find
[12:13] then that if we ought to see the
[12:14] Abraham, we look for the same promise.
[12:16] We ought to look for God appear in human
[12:19] skin. We ought to look for a great power
[12:22] that shall descend from heaven with a
[12:24] shout to change our minds, transform our
[12:29] bodies, everything. quicken us, make us
[12:31] alive, make us seeds of God that will
[12:34] live on the earth as a witness out here
[12:38] that he's the same yesterday, today, and
[12:40] forever.
[12:41] Bless, glory, power be unto him that
[12:45] sitth on the throne. I say the same
[12:47] thing. I got something to sh about. For
[12:50] the lamb opened the book. Amen. My name
[12:54] was in there. Amen.
[12:56] So therefore uh he preached there and
[12:59] now uh brother K West I'm saying her
[13:03] name he happened to because go to
[13:05] Phoenix and there he met a brother who
[13:07] was at the meetings and he gave the
[13:09] bombs. Amen. So this is what he said. He
[13:12] said three things to happen before the
[13:14] Lord appears. See now go back to go back
[13:19] to Abraham now. Certain things had to
[13:21] happen before Isaac appeared. Amen. God
[13:24] of human flesh. Is that right? But a
[13:26] power had to come and change their dead
[13:28] bodies back. Is that right? Okay. And
[13:31] now let's turn to first Thessalonians
[13:34] 4:14 so we can see a scripture.
[13:37] I'm tired. Amen.
[13:40] Praise God.
[13:44] The 16th verse.
[13:47] For the Lord himself shall descend from
[13:49] heaven with a shout, with the voice of
[13:51] the archangel, and with the trump of
[13:53] God. and the dead in Christ shall rise
[13:55] first. Now, I'm going to say what
[13:57] brother Brandham said is on the tape.
[13:59] And this was this brother's notes and
[14:01] this was given to me. So, I'm going to
[14:03] give it to you. And I didn't say this.
[14:05] Now, Brother Brandham said it. He said,
[14:07] he said, "Now, there's three things that
[14:09] must happen here. It's the shout, the
[14:12] voice of the archangel, and the trump of
[14:13] God." He said, "Now, the shout, the
[14:16] shout, the first thing that happened is
[14:17] the shout." Now, hear what the shout is.
[14:20] That's the message through Malachi 4.
[14:24] What are you shouting about? You have
[14:26] anything to shout about?
[14:29] Great is the Holy One of Israel in your
[14:31] midst. Is that something to shout about?
[14:34] The word of God.
[14:40] First Peter 4, for as much then as
[14:43] Christ has suffered for us in the flesh,
[14:47] see in the flesh. Arm yourselves
[14:49] likewise with the same mind. For he that
[14:52] has suffered in the flesh has ceased
[14:55] from sin. Amen. That he no longer should
[14:59] live in the rest of his time in the
[15:00] flesh to the lust of men but to the will
[15:03] of God. So here Peter tells to arm
[15:06] ourselves. See put on the armor that
[15:08] Christ had. His armor was forgiveness,
[15:11] meekness, gentleness, complete
[15:13] self-control that Christ had. That's
[15:15] what he had. See, he mortified the
[15:18] flesh. Paul tell us to mortify, kill all
[15:20] the day long the deeds of this body.
[15:22] Kill it by the word on your cross.
[15:25] Exactly right. You see? So then we find
[15:28] then that this is a hard way.
[15:31] Oh boy. Nobody wants this way, but many
[15:35] can run down in the air in the flesh,
[15:37] see to look for a man to raise up. I
[15:40] would love to see William Brown raise
[15:42] up. If he raised up, what would that
[15:45] mean to them? For for Paul said, "The
[15:48] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[15:50] dead. If that spirit be in you, it shall
[15:54] also quicken your mortal body." Amen.
[15:56] Well, then let let us make sure that the
[15:58] spirit as in brother Bram is in us.
[16:01] Amen. Before we go run anywhere, make
[16:04] sure that the spirit is in you.
[16:07] See, man, they don't understand that.
[16:09] But, however, that's God's way. Here's
[16:17] the trouble tonight in this message all
[16:19] over the world. There's Goliath walking
[16:21] up and down 40 days with a test. There's
[16:25] the ministry. Saul tied down. There's uh
[16:28] David's seven brothers running up and
[16:30] down. They passed seven years, eighth
[16:32] year now. Praise God. But David was
[16:34] number eight in the eighth year. He come
[16:36] on the scene then, brother. Number
[16:37] eight. Amen. Are you listening what I'm
[16:39] saying now? Praise. And I'm talking
[16:41] about not one person, please. I'm
[16:43] talking about the real true prophetic
[16:45] bride. Oh, there's there's apostles and
[16:47] prophets, pastors, evangelists, and
[16:49] teachers yet. God's going to show them.
[16:50] He's going to manifest them through the
[16:52] dynamics. Amen. David walked out there,
[16:56] took one little stone, and he wound it
[16:59] up. And Goliath looked at him and
[17:00] laughed him to scorn. Yes, they'll laugh
[17:02] us to scorn, but that stone is being
[17:05] wound tonight. While they're laughing,
[17:08] I'm winding a stone up. Praise God.
[17:10] They're still laughing. I'm whining.
[17:12] They're laughing. I'm whining. You keep
[17:14] laughing, I keep whining, cuz I know
[17:15] what I got, but you don't know what you
[17:17] got. Praise God. What I got has been
[17:19] tested and proven by Jesus Christ
[17:21] himself. Praise God. Not one time, many
[17:24] times. Praise the Lord. So, I'm ready to
[17:27] take this revelation and wound it up.
[17:29] Wind it up. Praise God. Now, watch what
[17:31] it happened. Goliath stood up there.
[17:35] Where did that rock go at? You know
[17:37] where it went? and went straight to the
[17:39] forehead. What is that? Intellectual
[17:42] powers.
[17:45] David's ministry is finally going to
[17:48] come on the scene and slay Goliath in
[17:50] the forehead. The re when the revelation
[17:53] of Jesus Christ goes to Connecticut,
[17:56] Indiana, and Tucson, and Georgia, and
[17:59] South America, and all the different
[18:01] places, it'll slay Goliath, lay him out
[18:03] flat, and you see the sheep of God come
[18:06] screaming forth. Praise God. When the
[18:08] real David take that stone or that rock
[18:10] of the revelation of Jesus Christ, when
[18:12] that David stand out there with that
[18:14] confession of what the seventh seal is
[18:16] and what the power of God is so we can
[18:18] prove it on the spot and and smash it
[18:22] into Goliath's forehead and all the
[18:24] intellectual horses, tents, white
[18:26] horses, intellectual powers of the
[18:28] message will be scattered and the true
[18:32] message shall go forth. There'll be one
[18:35] more ride.
[18:36] Oh, praise God. I feel good tonight.
[18:39] Praise. It's going to happen. Starting
[18:41] right here in New York tonight. Blessed
[18:44] be the name of the Lord.
[18:55] So now we are exalting one another to
[18:58] good works and provoking unto love. And
[19:02] I'm here to exhort you. Praise God. the
[19:05] people to enjoy their bloodwash redeemed
[19:07] rights unto love and unity of the faith.
[19:12] But now watch here. There are many weak
[19:13] ones and those who don't understand
[19:15] God's will. And so therefore, there's a
[19:18] scripture here and of some have
[19:21] compassion.
[19:22] Oh, what a revelation, brothers. There
[19:26] are weak ones. They're ignorant ones who
[19:28] don't don't have the same revelation
[19:30] that you have. And here is now we're in
[19:33] the word now. back to the word. Every
[19:36] word man shall not live by bread alone,
[19:38] but by every word that proceedth forth
[19:40] from the mouth of God. Therefore, I'm
[19:43] not interested in what that brother
[19:44] believes. Does he believe in Malachi 4?
[19:47] That's the be the beginning there. Does
[19:49] he believe that? Well, it may be all uh
[19:51] this way and that way. That's all right.
[19:53] See, uh temperance. Amen. Longsuffering.
[19:57] Longsuffering.
[20:00] Stretching way out. Amen. Praise God.
[20:04] See, and I'm persuaded God's able to
[20:06] take care of his own now. See,
[20:08] therefore, the I feel that there's
[20:10] coming forth a true revelation on
[20:12] brotherly kindness that'll just sweep
[20:15] the sweep over us and something will
[20:17] happen to us. Brother Ram said on the
[20:19] throne of mercy and judgment. Oh, what
[20:21] Jeffersonville, Indiana needs tonight,
[20:23] what the world needs tonight is
[20:25] thousands of lived voices. Amen.
[20:29] Did you hear what I said? A lived voice.
[20:32] Then the voice of God come down through
[20:35] Malachi 4 as a shout and we were we just
[20:39] supposed to walk around Jericho as it
[20:41] was. He and he said when I bid you to
[20:44] shout shout.
[20:48] Maybe tonight we can begin to shout.
[20:52] Amen. The Holy Spirit anoint our mouths
[20:54] to shout the real message out. Not some
[20:57] interpretation for what he said. Shout
[21:00] it out. But it takes a live voice first.
[21:03] You must live the word first. Add add.
[21:07] Oh my. And the devil's getting madder
[21:10] and matter as you add. And when you hit
[21:12] that brotherly kindness, oh brother, I
[21:15] see him go out the door tonight. He
[21:18] said, "Don't let them add that." Please,
[21:20] Philistines. Please, demons, don't let
[21:23] them add brotherly kinds for we are
[21:25] gone.
[21:27] We are finished. If they ever get the
[21:30] revelation to forgive their brothers, we
[21:34] are finished.
[21:41] Praise God.
[21:44] So they they're getting close. They're
[21:47] getting close. They're laying word.
[21:50] They're going to find the secret is
[21:52] laying forgiveness. Amen.
[21:55] That's a condition that man's sins are
[21:57] forgiven on. Forgiveness of man.
[22:01] Praise God. When you stand praying
[22:04] before you can receive the spoken word
[22:07] promises, forgive your brother.
[22:11] Oh my. If you don't forgive him, if you
[22:14] have an ought, you got a grievance. If
[22:17] you were right, he did something to you,
[22:20] you forgive him. Amen.
[22:23] Otherwise, your heavenly father cannot
[22:25] forgive you in the bride age, in the
[22:27] word age.
[22:29] And the devil want to keep that away
[22:30] from you now. So he won't let because
[22:32] nobody preached that now. Screw all
[22:34] around it. But I feel maybe tonight the
[22:38] secret is out.
[22:42] God, you talking about healings, the
[22:44] faith bank will sweep all over this
[22:46] place here. It'll blow up the camp up
[22:49] there. Amen. Praise God. What a
[22:53] revelation. And of some have compassion.
[22:57] But you don't understand, brother. He
[22:58] did the terriblest thing to me. Talked
[23:01] about me in a dirty way. Told lies on
[23:03] me. And of some have compassion.
[23:10] But you understand. I mean, he uh did
[23:13] this, he did that. Shimm kicked dirt on
[23:16] David. Should I cut that dog's head off?
[23:20] Let him alone. God has bid him to do it.
[23:22] Amen. Amen.
[23:43] I wonder this morning is that mechanic
[23:46] body temple tabernacle
[23:50] uh spiritually manifested in here this
[23:52] morning. Amen. I wonder if it is he will
[23:58] show himself alive.
[24:01] [Music]
[24:03] He'll speak things pertaining to the
[24:06] kingdom of God.
[24:08] Wouldn't it be wonderful if we can from
[24:10] this day enter into a little ministry
[24:12] like this here
[24:15] for about 30 40 days maybe it would just
[24:19] cap off everything I have preached from
[24:21] the pulpit.
[24:23] Oh I said Lord if I could just enter
[24:25] into a vindication of the thing that has
[24:27] been preached.
[24:31] My my purpose for the next month or so,
[24:35] I'm trying to bring to you the reality
[24:38] of the presence of Christ
[24:42] that you might see him
[24:45] that you might know that it is him
[24:51] by his identified promise for this day.
[24:58] Identified promise word. Well, he
[24:59] promised Malachi 4, Revelation 10:7, and
[25:02] St. Luke 17:30, Hebrews 4:12, Hebrews
[25:05] 13:8, and William, Mary, and Brandon
[25:08] identified that
[25:10] that brought the the presence from the
[25:12] throne on the earth.
[25:15] Then as he gave us a promise,
[25:18] St. Mark 16, the true church in action,
[25:22] the spirit and the life of it. 2 Peter 1
[25:26] 5-7.
[25:29] Now, if the light is here,
[25:32] seven adds
[25:36] the spirit's got to follow it. St. Mark
[25:39] 16.
[25:42] If that is so, then the presence, the
[25:45] reality of it is here.
[25:50] And then we are set in the temple. And
[25:53] in Jesus the capstone spirit, Holy
[25:57] Spirit rapture in faith, rapture in
[25:59] grace can come suddenly to his temple.
[26:05] I mean if the people are sanctified,
[26:07] [Music]
[26:11] consecrated temples
[26:14] under expectation.
[26:18] Amen. Oh, praise God. We're here.
[26:26] Now the promises, the truth that we have
[26:30] experienced from Malachi 4 are to become
[26:33] part of our nature. We all experience
[26:36] Malachi 4 himself.
[26:38] We went into that. We know, we believe
[26:40] it, we handle it. But what he said,
[26:44] have we added?
[26:48] Amen.
[26:50] Oh, what did he say? What did he come
[26:53] for? He come to restore back.
[26:56] Restore back what? Faith,
[27:00] virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience,
[27:04] godliness. And when they find the
[27:06] world's coin,
[27:12] I'll come suddenly to my temple.
[27:15] [Music]
[27:20] Amen. Now, in his promised word, he he
[27:23] won't have to uh you won't have to
[27:25] interpret it. He will interpret it
[27:26] through you. What you are doing, what he
[27:29] promised to do, the church that follows
[27:31] him, here it is, will be so much like
[27:34] him until the people will know.
[27:37] You won't have to say nothing. There
[27:39] goes a Christian.
[27:42] Wow. Amen. Dripping a Christian with
[27:46] charity.
[27:48] Amen. See,
[27:50] Peter and John, they were crushing after
[27:52] healing a man at the gate called
[27:53] beautiful. They said that they perceive
[27:55] the priesthood that they were both
[27:56] ignorant, unlearned man. But they take
[27:59] notice that they had been with Jesus
[28:00] getting them seven steps because what?
[28:04] They were doing the things he did.
[28:07] And we're only divine with our seven
[28:09] steps. Amen. Without him, we can do
[28:11] nothing without charity. Amen.
[28:14] Amen. Peter has so much virtue they will
[28:17] heal in his shadow.
[28:21] How you going to get temperance without
[28:23] virtue?
[28:27] If you got virtue, stand up and let
[28:29] somebody be healed in your shadow.
[28:32] Oh, now let's come to get some faith in
[28:35] this morning. Amen. Before we go way
[28:37] over there up the ladder somewhere.
[28:39] Amen.
[28:41] Let's get the faith first.
[28:43] Amen. Cuz you say you got uh temperance
[28:45] or patience. Where's the virtue? Virtue
[28:49] is dynamics. Healing power. The woman
[28:52] touched Jesus clothes and virtue. He
[28:54] turned.
[28:56] Virtue went out of him. Healing power.
[28:58] Dynamics went out.
[29:00] [Music]
[29:02] What a revelation. And he and he had a
[29:04] sign to prove it was him in there, too.
[29:07] He told the sickness of the heart and
[29:08] prophesied things to happen and healed
[29:10] the sick and uh spoke and created even
[29:13] created a jawbone and sent the lost his
[29:14] jaw so we in New York City would know
[29:17] that he was creating and not to look for
[29:20] something way down the road. He was
[29:21] already doing it in New York. What a
[29:24] sign came to brother Hunt and I so in 65
[29:26] they could go west, east, south, north.
[29:29] I didn't care. I knew he was here.
[29:32] What a sign. He waved up and waved
[29:34] goodbye in New York. But I've already
[29:36] created a blood cell and hit the lost
[29:38] jawbone. So don't look for all these
[29:40] funny things. They're flying everywhere.
[29:42] Amen. I even give you a picture that
[29:45] Malachi 4 is going up in in with three
[29:48] horses. He's leaving. There's a mantle
[29:50] to fall behind. Catch the mantle. The
[29:52] mantle is faith, uh, virtue, knowledge,
[29:55] or temperance. Amen. Patience. God of
[29:59] his brotherly kind. That's the mantle.
[30:01] Then wrap it around you. Come on down to
[30:02] the Jordan. Stand there.
[30:05] Where is the live God of Elijah?
[30:12] With your virtue and faith, you judge
[30:15] whether the word is right or wrong.
[30:19] There you are. Other words, I don't
[30:21] think I'm going to get the Holy Ghost.
[30:23] Can God lie the word? Amen. Is the word
[30:25] wrong? Then if you said you cannot get
[30:27] the Holy Ghost or you can't be healed,
[30:29] you saying God's a liar. Then you don't
[30:31] have any knowledge of God at all. Amen.
[30:34] If you say that God cannot do anything
[30:35] in your life, I don't care what it is.
[30:38] God is a liar. You have no knowledge of
[30:41] God at all. You don't even know who God
[30:43] is. Amen. For he that cometh to God must
[30:46] believe that God is.
[30:49] And
[30:50] he is a rewarder of them that seek him
[30:54] diligently.
[30:56] Not 15 minutes, but diligently.
[31:00] There you are.
[31:02] Brother, we getting some knowledge
[31:03] tonight, aren't we?
[31:06] And if you lay aside all your creeds and
[31:08] all your unbelief, everything that you
[31:10] claim you have done, then you have
[31:12] knowledge to believe that God cannot
[31:14] lie.
[31:17] Boy, that early church was something,
[31:19] wasn't they?
[31:21] They knew where they were standing,
[31:22] didn't they? Let every man's word be a
[31:24] lie, but mine be true. See, now you get
[31:27] knowledge. That's supreme knowledge. You
[31:29] don't have to have four degrees in some
[31:31] college or something like that to have
[31:33] it because all these virtues are are
[31:35] given to you by God to place upon the
[31:37] foundation of your faith.
[31:40] That you might come to the full stature
[31:42] of the real living man of God. Yes sir.
[31:48] But now after we got our first three
[31:50] steps which come from God, God gave the
[31:53] faith,
[31:54] God gave, he heals and he gives
[31:57] spiritual knowledge. Now what are we
[32:00] going to do with it?
[32:02] We know he's here and and he give us
[32:05] these things to a special group and we
[32:08] got it vindicated
[32:11] by the miraculous. Now, but what are we
[32:13] going to do with it? Well, here we are
[32:16] this morning. We're going to find out.
[32:18] Now these next four things is what we do
[32:22] with what we got.
[32:24] If other words now temperance, patience,
[32:28] godliness, and brotherly kindness are
[32:29] what we can do now.
[32:33] There you are. That's what we can do in
[32:36] appreciation back. Oh my God, you did
[32:38] this for me. That Lord, I I'm coming out
[32:41] of the world. That that's it.
[32:43] I'm going to live for you. I'm going to
[32:45] breathe for you. I want to walk for you,
[32:47] talk for you. Amen. I want to sleep and
[32:50] die for you.
[32:53] Amen.
[32:55] Now, we understand what is self-control.
[32:58] And we need it, don't we? See, now it's
[33:00] not just the mere external restraint. I
[33:04] don't drink no more. I don't smoke. No,
[33:07] it's past that.
[33:09] I got a long dress and I stop cutting my
[33:11] hair. No, it's past that. Uh-uh. Wait.
[33:14] on the inside. See, that's only on the
[33:16] outside. Amen. See, and I fast and I
[33:19] pray. No, past that, too. See, way on
[33:22] the inside. Amen. That's illegal. It's
[33:24] there. See? So, we ain't talking about
[33:25] any legalism now. See, now, but we
[33:29] talking about the cultivation of the
[33:31] inward history of the soul day by day.
[33:34] Governing ourselves, keeping ourselves
[33:36] in order. And know this here, if we
[33:39] cannot keep ourselves in order, we
[33:41] cannot keep anyone else in order.
[33:45] temperance that quiet a gravity of
[33:48] gravity of spirit that is uh equal in
[33:51] every circumstance.
[33:53] See like Christ was never upset by any
[33:56] trial or anything that provokes.
[33:59] You see now temperance is active is
[34:02] self-control. Temperance will keep me
[34:04] from saying or doing a thing that will
[34:06] wound you.
[34:11] Patience is endurance. Don't faint and
[34:14] say, "I'm tired and fall down." No. See,
[34:17] let endurance patience have full play
[34:20] and do a thorough work so that you may
[34:22] be perfectly and fully developed with no
[34:25] defects,
[34:27] lacking in nothing. You know I'm talking
[34:29] about that statue of a perfect man,
[34:31] don't you?
[34:35] My the fruit of of the trial is
[34:37] patience. Third pull lacking nothing in
[34:42] the statue of a perfect man. Amen.
[34:45] Oh my. Sure. You're getting it now. See,
[34:50] therefore the test see trials test faith
[34:53] and the man who stands true in them
[34:55] proves his faith genuine.
[34:58] Yes, sir. Test work patience. Patient
[35:00] works perfection. Perfect patience is a
[35:03] virtue of the third pull. Personal
[35:06] perfection in the knowledge of the
[35:07] gospel and the will of God and personal
[35:10] completeness in all gifts and graces in
[35:13] them seven steps. Amen. See patience
[35:16] with what? What kind of patience? First
[35:18] thing is have patience with God. If you
[35:20] got real genuine faith, you have real
[35:22] genuine patience. There you are. See,
[35:25] because faith workketh patience. When
[35:26] God says anything, you believe it.
[35:28] That's all. You got patience. understand
[35:34] Joshua commission was a two-fold
[35:35] commission. Take them over and then
[35:38] divide the land, the inheritance years
[35:41] later. So, William Brandham took us in,
[35:44] gave us the message, put it on tapes and
[35:46] book, and God took them away. And now
[35:49] we're in the land. Amen. And that's why
[35:53] there's nobody here in front of me. Oh,
[35:55] what wonderful odds.
[35:58] What odds? I looked around this entire
[36:01] country in 1965. The prophet was gone. I
[36:04] said, "Well, there's nobody tell me
[36:06] because what I can do and I'm going to
[36:08] take the land for myself."
[36:11] Brother, get out of my way. You can't
[36:13] tell me. I said, I know what it is. Yes,
[36:16] sir. Every place where the soul of your
[36:19] foot, my soul of my foot stepped down
[36:21] into virtue, he said, you can have it.
[36:23] Soul of my foot stepped down into
[36:26] knowledge. She said, "You can have it."
[36:28] Yes, sir. The soul of my foot went down
[36:31] into temperance. You can have it. Into
[36:33] patience, you can have it. Amen. Into
[36:36] God, you can have it.
[36:42] Have you been having a house cleaning
[36:43] time?
[36:45] Now you begin to know what happened in
[36:46] Georgia for the people settled down in
[36:48] this message for nine years, got all
[36:51] puffed up and know everything. The only
[36:54] interpretation is this, is that, and
[36:56] whatnot. And then God come around
[36:58] through Georgia and thundered out to
[36:59] them. Said, "You better get busy. Have a
[37:01] bring back the holy decency." Oh yes,
[37:04] sir. Bring back the tenderness. And
[37:07] that's why those ministers down there in
[37:08] Georgia, they knew what that meant.
[37:10] Brother Lee Bell and all, they all
[37:12] testified. They wept and they confessed
[37:14] to one another. Georgia Saturday night,
[37:17] that never happened before in this
[37:18] message since Brother Brandham left. Ask
[37:21] the ministers. They know what happened.
[37:23] They testified all around God. A brother
[37:25] from North Carolina said, "Brother
[37:27] Coleman, I don't know you." He said,
[37:28] "But that was God." He now I'm not I'm
[37:30] bragging on Jesus now. I'm talking I
[37:33] need the same thing myself. See? So
[37:36] therefore, he said, "Brother Coleman,
[37:38] that's that's fair." He said, "All these
[37:40] years, he says, God permitted us to chop
[37:43] up one another in the message with our
[37:44] own interpretations, then come back
[37:47] around here in Georgia and reveal to us
[37:50] the lost coin."
[37:51] He said, "That's that's God. That's
[37:54] fear. Now, we must go and humble
[37:56] ourselves to one another and say, "I'm
[37:58] sorry." And that happened June 29th in
[38:01] Georgia.
[38:03] Amen. When the power of this church
[38:07] rises, it'll bring its brethren, lift
[38:09] them up into the capstone of the seven
[38:12] thunders. It'll bring you, raise you up
[38:14] in the power of God into them seven
[38:16] angels.
[38:20] Oh
[38:22] yes, sir. When the power of Jeffville
[38:26] rises, it'll bring lift them up.
[38:28] Connecticut and Georgia and all around
[38:30] the world, it'll lift them up. When they
[38:32] find the lost coin,
[38:37] I said when they find the lost coin. But
[38:40] if they're not looking for the lost coin
[38:43] before the resurrection,
[38:45] [Applause]
[38:46] Praise God. Somebody's got to preach the
[38:50] lost coin before. Somebody must preach
[38:53] adoption before the resurrection.
[38:56] [Applause]
[38:59] Praise God.
[39:01] Amen. I feel like I'm in Georgia this
[39:03] morning. I feel like I'm in Trinidad and
[39:07] Puerto Rico.
[39:09] I feel a faith I've never felt before in
[39:12] here.
[39:18] The revelation of the seven thunders as
[39:20] mechanics adds to our faith to bring
[39:22] down the capstone as dynamics to seal up
[39:26] the bride and vindicator.
[39:28] Oh, how do we know? Yes, sat of a
[39:31] perfect man. How do we know that? They
[39:34] without us are not made perfect. Who is
[39:36] they? Hebrews 11. All of these people,
[39:39] Wesley, all the way down way down to
[39:42] Adam, all back down through there, they
[39:44] without us are not made perfect. Even
[39:46] the 1906 to 1946 Pentecostals, even
[39:50] those in the first pull, second pull,
[39:52] even in the third pull are not made
[39:54] perfect without you and me.
[39:57] What a revelation.
[39:59] You know why? Because they we have not
[40:02] seen the brotherly kindness manifested
[40:04] yet
[40:06] which is the seventh step. So they only
[40:10] have six steps.
[40:12] So they cannot come forth in the
[40:14] resurrection with six steps. They cannot
[40:18] be made perfect complete without you and
[40:21] me.
[40:23] Oh my.
[40:25] When the capstone comes down,
[40:28] it'll complete us. It'll pour the honey
[40:31] in. We'll have our testimony. These
[40:34] signs shall follow them that believe.
[40:38] And we shall go forth conquerors.
[40:41] Amen. Oh my. Yes, si. We're the stones.
[40:45] Yes, s.
[40:50] I say by the faith in the word of God,
[40:55] there's some new skin sitting here this
[40:57] morning.
[41:00] Amen. There's some being delivered every
[41:02] day by the word by this seventh thunder
[41:07] revelation.
[41:09] You are redeemed now.
[41:14] Praise God. Amen.
[41:16] [Applause]
[41:18] We're sitting in heavenly places. Oh my.
[41:21] Those new skins with new wine, new life
[41:25] begin to expand. There wasn't enough
[41:28] room in the upper room to hold them.
[41:31] Too tight. They needed some room.
[41:35] Out. They come down the steps out into
[41:37] the street of Jerusalem. They expanded.
[41:40] They give. They stretched out. Oh,
[41:43] praise God. until all Jerusalem begin to
[41:46] wonder. What meanth this? And then Peter
[41:50] stood up there with a seven thunder
[41:52] revelation. This is that that the
[41:56] prophet Joel Speaker of I pour out my
[41:59] new wife to into some new skins.
[42:03] And this morning I'm persuaded that I
[42:05] can stand. He said this is that the
[42:08] prophet Malachi for spake up.
[42:12] The new wine is coming into you now.
[42:16] If you want the Holy Ghost, you can have
[42:18] it now.
[42:21] Just say, "Lord God, give me the Holy
[42:23] Ghost." If you want a healing, you can
[42:25] have the healing right now.
[42:28] The new wine is here now.
[42:32] He's pouring the new wine up on you.
[42:36] [Music]
[42:37] [Applause]
[42:38] We're here. the dynamics and the
[42:41] mechanics is going forth together.
[42:46] Oh, praise God. Praise our God. Praise
[42:49] our God. Praise God. Amen. Thank you,
[42:53] Lord.
[43:06] He come down to take us out.
[43:09] Thank God. Thank God. I'm going to leave
[43:12] here. You young children, if you got a
[43:15] year left or a few months left, you have
[43:17] nothing. And oh, how you going to answer
[43:20] for this message if you over 12 years
[43:23] old? I'm talking about you and you and
[43:24] you and the rest of you. Don't you think
[43:26] you're smart to sneak around here in
[43:28] this church here, be all tithe, and go
[43:31] back outside and put on your minis, run
[43:33] around with boys, and your little
[43:34] hypocrites.
[43:36] Don't you do that. You think God ain't
[43:38] watching you?
[43:42] Repent.
[43:45] Repent.
[43:49] Get out of the world. Come back to God.
[43:52] Who you think you're fooling? There's a
[43:54] eye watching you. That eye is on the
[43:58] earth in the capstone. You don't believe
[44:00] me? Take out your dollar bill. Look on
[44:02] your dollar bill. You'll see a eye in
[44:04] the cap. That eye is here now.
[44:08] He is a word quicker, more powerful,
[44:11] sharper than a two-edged sword. He knows
[44:13] what's in your heart, brother. You
[44:15] better get back to God before he cut you
[44:17] off.
[44:23] Praise God. Praise God. Everyone, I'm up
[44:27] in the family too. All of you over 12
[44:29] years old, this day the Lord thy God
[44:31] speaks to you today. Repent, children.
[44:34] Get back to pot. God's speaking to pour
[44:37] out a devastation upon America. And
[44:40] don't be for your mommy and your father
[44:42] laying there day and night for you with
[44:43] kids
[44:45] crying out for you. Glory to God.
[44:51] Praise God. Praise God. Children want
[44:54] you to know God is speaking this morning
[44:56] the same God that spoke in church.
[45:00] That same God is making intercession for
[45:02] you here this morning. That's not me.
[45:05] God speaking.
[45:17] Serve God, children. Serve God. Serve
[45:20] God. Serve God. He loves you.
[45:24] Give your heart to God today, children.
[45:32] Brother Bam on my guy.
[45:35] He prophesied
[45:37] now the coming of those seals.
[45:41] He said at the finishing
[45:44] of the seventh seal,
[45:46] then we would know God's the great
[45:48] mystery of God.
[45:50] at the finishing of the seventh seal
[45:54] and there's seven thunders to it.
[45:57] Then we would know who God is,
[46:00] his nature, his being, how he lives, it
[46:04] be a bride washed in the blood of Jesus
[46:07] Christ.
[46:09] She'll be way up there at that time.
[46:12] She will have added to her fame
[46:15] gratuitous temperance of brotherly
[46:18] kindness.
[46:20] Do you remember blasphemous names?
[46:23] Said the shepherd's dream up on a
[46:26] pyramid mountain.
[46:28] There was a rock box up there,
[46:31] a great big workman.
[46:33] He had a bucket of clear blue water.
[46:37] He said that was the Holy Spirit.
[46:40] It was pouring into the rocks.
[46:43] He was boiling out roaches,
[46:47] rocks and sticks and dirt.
[46:50] That's the seven seal message.
[46:53] That's Ephesians 5:26.
[46:56] The washing of the sacrifice,
[46:59] the washing of the water by the word.
[47:04] Can old church hold that?
[47:07] Can no man hold all those quotes?
[47:10] can't hold all the words.
[47:13] You'll bust open.
[47:15] You can't hold the Holy Spirit.
[47:17] That's a ball of trash out of you.
[47:21] Amen. That's for perfection.
[47:23] That's the word to ripen you and the
[47:26] sunshine.
[47:28] But then the word comes back again.
[47:31] And he dumps in a bucket of honey.
[47:35] But you can't hold the honey.
[47:38] brotherly kindness.
[47:40] You can get up on your seventh step.
[47:44] You We can forgive our brothers.
[47:48] We can forgive our sisters.
[47:52] We can manifest our requirement tonight.
[47:58] Amen. Perfect faith. Page four.
[48:01] Faith is based on forgiveness.
[48:05] Seven tongues gives faith.
[48:08] brotherly kindness and a revelation
[48:12] that we are nothing.
[48:14] Amen. Amen. When you stand praying,
[48:18] if you have ought forgive, if you cannot
[48:23] forgive,
[48:24] heavenly father cannot forgive you. If
[48:28] you cannot forgive,
[48:30] you cannot have the seventh thunders.
[48:33] For the seventh is faith,
[48:36] but it's based on forgiveness.
[48:39] No condemnation.
[48:41] All the blood of Jesus Christ.
[48:45] The entire Bible in you.
[48:48] Your faith anointed
[48:50] as to who Jesus Christ is today.
[48:54] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[48:56] forever.
[48:58] Then your faith is anointed.
[49:00] Amen. Amen.
[49:06] Malachi 4's message
[49:08] gave us a word in season. Amen. The
[49:11] seventh thunder revelation
[49:14] was wilt thou be made whole.
[49:17] That was a question or wilt thou be made
[49:20] whole if you please.
[49:23] If you would be perfect.
[49:26] Amen. It was a revelation
[49:28] straight from the invisible Jesus.
[49:32] He was standing at the pool of Beth of
[49:34] of Betha,
[49:37] excuse me. He was standing there
[49:41] making himself visible.
[49:43] All the important people laid around in
[49:45] the message
[49:48] for nine years.
[49:50] The the water had moved in 1963 and
[49:54] through 65.
[49:57] I Jesus the angel stirred the water for
[50:02] this season through the prophet the
[50:05] seventh angel. The water was moving
[50:09] and and important folk
[50:12] blind spiritually physically halt
[50:18] spiritually with her. They would turn to
[50:20] get in the water.
[50:22] But there was a predestinated lame man
[50:24] standing there.
[50:27] All those people,
[50:29] fine people, wonderful people here in
[50:33] America, nicel looking people. But he
[50:36] come to one person, a lame man.
[50:40] Amen. Jesus about 1974.
[50:44] The seven thunders came to the lame man.
[50:50] Amen.
[50:52] Since 1965,
[50:55] he had purpose in his heart.
[50:58] One day I'll get to that pool. He was
[51:02] walking. One day, next year, one day,
[51:06] 1968, one day, 1969, one day, 1971 day,
[51:13] the Holy Spirit was watching him.
[51:17] God knew down in his subconscious. He
[51:19] had a desire for God. One day I'll make
[51:23] it. One day I'll be healed. One day I'll
[51:28] be sealed. One day, Hallelujah. Amen.
[51:32] 1974.
[51:35] 1975.
[51:37] Here come Jesus. Here I am. The seven
[51:41] thunders. Glory to God. Amen.
[51:49] What's the attraction on the mountain?
[51:51] Page 19, paragraph 114. But it shall be
[51:55] like when she grows past denomination,
[51:58] when she gets past organization and
[52:00] blooms out again, she'll put forth
[52:02] oranges like she was when she went into
[52:04] the ground. And then when when she puts
[52:07] forth oranges and then it shall be
[52:10] light.
[52:12] And they don't know what the power what
[52:14] Malachi 4 is yet. But when we grow past
[52:17] these 16 years, all these false Christ
[52:20] interpretations and man-made creeds and
[52:23] I did when we grow past all this here,
[52:25] like that lily down in the muck in the m
[52:28] press his way up. Praise God. And then
[52:32] there shall be light. And then we shall
[52:34] walk in the light. Walking in the light.
[52:37] People sing the song, but but walking in
[52:40] the light mean that the life of the Lord
[52:42] Jesus in his season, in his time is
[52:44] being manifested in your flesh. That's
[52:47] what it means to walk in the light. It's
[52:50] being manifested. And then you can sing,
[52:52] "All you saints of light, proclaim,
[52:55] Jesus, the light of the world." It'll
[52:59] emanate out of you.
[53:01] Not only will they hear the thunders of
[53:03] God, but they'll see the very expression
[53:07] of inward parts of you manifesting Jesus
[53:11] Christ. You'll see God on two feet.
[53:14] You'll hear God speaking the thunder of
[53:16] God.
[53:18] Praise God. Amen.
[53:21] Amen. You'll sing the amens. Do you love
[53:24] them? Amen. Will you serve them? Amen.
[53:27] Will you believe them? Amen. Amen. Amen.
[53:33] God created Lucifer in the beginning,
[53:36] but you was before the beginning.
[53:41] Amen. You was a thought in his mind.
[53:46] The angels, they all were created and
[53:49] you was in his mind and you was pride.
[53:51] If you ever going to be pride, you were
[53:53] bride then.
[53:57] He was bride then not male. He was bride
[54:01] then
[54:03] he called. He love he called. Then he
[54:06] call he justified.
[54:08] Then he justified. He already glorified.
[54:17] So when you step out and say seven
[54:20] thunders, you're saying Lord give me the
[54:23] glory I had with you before the
[54:24] foundation.
[54:28] Amen. That's your glory. Can't nobody
[54:33] take it away.
[54:35] God give it to you. God said so. God
[54:38] said so.
[54:41] Give me my mountain.
[54:43] Praise God.
[54:46] Each church age produced a mystery.
[54:48] Well, the seventh church age produced a
[54:50] mystery. Charity Jesus Christ.
[54:55] And now charity has come down on top of
[54:58] the seven thunders. And these seven
[55:01] thunders, the seventh thunder has all
[55:04] the other thunders in it is scooped up
[55:07] into it. And charity sits with a flaming
[55:10] sword over your head. Praise God. And
[55:14] the seventh seal is Christ
[55:18] who we preach warning every man to be
[55:22] perfect in Christ Jesus.
[55:24] The seven thunders was the mystery hid
[55:26] under the seventh seal. And the seventh
[55:30] thunder is the thunder of love. Glory.
[55:34] The seven spirits of seven thunders
[55:36] brings back Christ to the church.
[55:40] He's here. Oh my cherry. The seventh
[55:44] thunder of love. What is the seventh
[55:47] thunder? The great eternal thunder of
[55:50] God's love poured out into his adopted
[55:52] sons.
[55:54] My my brother Ben, there's something
[55:56] within me. Who's the rain?
[56:00] Nothing can separate you from the love
[56:02] of God.
[56:03] Don't you see the authority of the
[56:05] living God in the living church? The
[56:07] bride, the cripples walk, the dead are
[56:10] raised up, the blinds see. The gospel
[56:14] goes forth in his power for the message
[56:17] and the messenger is one.
[56:21] Amen. The message.
[56:23] Amen. The message, the purifier is the
[56:26] message and you are the messenger. And
[56:28] when charity come, you become one. The
[56:32] sick is healed with a spoken word.
[56:35] Rise up and take up your bed and walk.
[56:38] The word is in the church. Then comes
[56:40] forgiveness. Then true brotherly
[56:43] kindness. And if some have compassion,
[56:45] how many times shall I forgive? 70* 7.
[56:48] Beloved, the end of all things is here.
[56:52] When you stand praying, if you have art
[56:55] trumpet,
[56:57] if you do not drop your heart, your
[56:58] heavenly father cannot forgive you.
[57:02] That's a thunder of love. When that
[57:05] happens in the church, amen, in New York
[57:07] and Trinidad and all around the world,
[57:09] rest of the places, the devil is trying
[57:11] to get the people not to forgive one
[57:13] another. But the charity is the seventh
[57:16] thunder love that will thunder
[57:18] forgiveness,
[57:20] thunder
[57:22] down through. So therefore, beloved,
[57:25] tonight above all things, have fervent
[57:29] charity among yourselves.
[57:32] And it is here tonight by God's grace.
[57:47] [Music]
[57:49] They know all the seven thunder boys.
[57:52] Paul, I know William Brandham, I know
[57:54] you. I know
[57:59] the demons know who you are
[58:02] because you kicked them out of heaven
[58:06] and they're mad at you. They will use
[58:10] physical bodies today to curse you, to
[58:14] revile you, to spit on you. But praise
[58:18] God, so what?
[58:21] What a weak here. Hallelujah. We have
[58:25] salvation.
[58:27] It means nothing if they spit on my
[58:30] Lord. How much more me?
[58:36] Praise God. Amen. You never seen me.
[58:42] Shalom. Page one. Brother Bram said,
[58:44] "You only see the body.
[58:47] You do not see me tonight.
[58:51] The only way you can see me is to
[58:55] understand
[58:56] who I am and who you are.
[59:00] Otherwise, you'll never see me.
[59:04] You see some flesh.
[59:06] Praise God.
[59:09] But we're going to get into the flesh
[59:10] down in PE.
[59:12] Get plumbing to that book of life.
[59:16] Amen.
[59:17] The father of the flesh is not your real
[59:19] father.
[59:24] [Music]
[59:29] God
[59:31] only chose to put that attribute in some
[59:34] white skins, some black skins, some
[59:38] yellow skin, some colored skin.
[59:47] You don't know me.
[59:50] I come from God and I go back to God.
[59:54] [Music]
[59:58] And if God made me a colored man, I'm a
[1:00:01] happy colored man.
[1:00:06] [Music]
[1:00:10] I'm not ashamed of what I am.
[1:00:14] God made me this way. I'm happy this
[1:00:18] way.
[1:00:21] Don't you ever be ashamed of who you
[1:00:23] are.
[1:00:25] It's not you. It's God in you.
[1:00:30] [Music]
[1:00:32] Praise God. Amen. You the word of God.
[1:00:39] This is only a worldly system that shall
[1:00:42] be done away with.
[1:00:45] It's finished. The prophet uncursed it.
[1:00:49] The kingdom of God is coming into view.
[1:00:53] [Music]
[1:00:55] Amen.
[1:00:57] Glory adios.
[1:00:59] Brother Bram said, "I can't brag on
[1:01:01] Charlie and Ella Brandom,
[1:01:04] gunfighters and bootleggers and so
[1:01:06] forth. But whose son am I now?
[1:01:14] Then whosoever son I am now, that's who
[1:01:17] I'm going to brag on.
[1:01:20] [Music]
[1:01:22] And I'm a son of Elohim.
[1:01:28] So I'm bragging on Elohim.
[1:01:31] And Elohim is a seven thunders.
[1:01:34] That's why I brag on the seven thunders.
[1:01:37] That's my father.
[1:01:41] My father in heaven reveal to me who I
[1:01:44] am. Now speak it, express it, say it.
[1:01:53] I'm not afraid to say it. I never have
[1:01:56] been and never will be afraid to say one
[1:01:59] word in this Bible or here.
[1:02:04] Who is man
[1:02:06] that we should be mindful of flesh?
[1:02:10] Who is man? He's nothing.
[1:02:14] God can blow him away.
[1:02:20] Amen.
[1:02:23] Praise God. Well, this might help
[1:02:25] somebody here tonight.
[1:02:28] So, I say shalom to you. Peace.
[1:02:37] shouting for joy. Praise God. When they
[1:02:40] seen that someday there was a tabernacle
[1:02:43] here on earth and King Mel Melzdc would
[1:02:46] come in righteousness of God.
[1:02:52] That's why you were shouting
[1:02:54] you my Amen.
[1:02:58] Hallelujah.
[1:03:01] That's why you shout now.
[1:03:05] Amen. You was in Melzdc
[1:03:09] and Melzdic told you in the logos
[1:03:16] that he was going to go down and take on
[1:03:19] flesh
[1:03:20] and die for you because you had to
[1:03:23] bypass that the
[1:03:26] glory to God. Amen.
[1:03:29] And there's not enough devils in hell to
[1:03:32] stop you from going back to God.
[1:03:36] You come from God and you're going back
[1:03:38] to God.
[1:03:40] Gloriosia.
[1:03:45] Praise God.
[1:03:47] They were shouting. They were dancing.
[1:03:50] They were singing.
[1:03:54] Glory.
[1:03:57] Praise God. Amen.
[1:03:59] When they had a revelation
[1:04:01] that King Mechazedc
[1:04:04] would come in the righteousness of God
[1:04:06] and give his life to redeem us
[1:04:10] took God back again in that challenge
[1:04:13] forever and ever. Where was you when I
[1:04:15] laid the foundation of the world? Tell
[1:04:17] me what you stand upon.
[1:04:20] Praise God. Amen. Yes, sir. Job fell
[1:04:25] down on his face. That's what we are
[1:04:28] supposed to do. When the revelations
[1:04:30] break like this, we should lay prostrate
[1:04:36] and people sit around. That was a nice
[1:04:38] sermon.
[1:04:54] Heat.
[1:05:02] Heat.
[1:05:18] Fire.
[1:05:25] You can't stop this fire.
[1:05:34] The fire is here.
[1:05:36] [Applause]
[1:05:39] Heat.
[1:05:46] Heat.
[1:06:07] Heat
[1:06:08] up
[1:06:11] here.
[1:06:29] Heat.
[1:06:42] Heat.
[1:06:46] Fire
[1:07:29] Heat up
[1:07:33] here.
[1:07:45] Heat.
[1:07:59] Heat.
[1:08:07] Thank you Jesus.
[1:08:10] Thank you Lord.
[1:08:25] Yeah.
[1:08:28] Heat.
[1:08:44] Heat.
[1:08:57] Heat.
[1:09:04] This is that.
[1:09:08] Hallelujah. Praise God. Glory.
[1:09:14] This is that spoken by the prophet
[1:09:18] Malachi 4.
[1:09:20] Receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:24] Hallelujah.
[1:09:39] Uh we have this is this particular
[1:09:41] service is the first service to be on
[1:09:43] videotape. Amen. So the back of your
[1:09:46] heads is being taped.
[1:09:49] [Applause]
[1:09:51] Amen.
[1:09:54] So I'll be able I believe I know all of
[1:09:56] you. Y'all be able to look at the tapes
[1:09:57] and see who's praised and who's not.
[1:10:01] Amen.
[1:10:04] Praise God. Amen.
[1:10:07] We got a chance to see all the stiff
[1:10:09] spirits.
[1:10:13] Chance to see all the fakers.
[1:10:18] Amen.
[1:10:22] He waited. He made you aspire
[1:10:26] something within you to press on.
[1:10:31] 66 67 with a promise. Thunders thunders
[1:10:36] thunders. Come over here. Shut up.
[1:10:38] Thunders come over there. Shut up. 10th
[1:10:41] white horse. Shut up. Thunders. The
[1:10:43] thunders of the bride revival. It'll
[1:10:45] gather her together. Hallelujah. It'll
[1:10:47] give a faint. It'll show how to prepare.
[1:10:49] Shut up. Thunders.
[1:10:51] 67 68 9 70 1 2 3 4 Praise God. The seven
[1:10:57] thunders of the seven voices of the
[1:11:00] seven church ages.
[1:11:06] But what has happened by 1974?
[1:11:10] You have added virtue, knowledge,
[1:11:12] temperance, patience. God is brotherly
[1:11:15] kindness. Going down to Georgia
[1:11:19] full of the virtues, full of the
[1:11:21] thunders
[1:11:23] that went out like a thunder.
[1:11:31] And here you stand.
[1:11:34] It thundered in New York City
[1:11:39] right under your nose.
[1:11:44] Oh my
[1:11:47] glory.
[1:11:49] Just remember the seventh seal. The
[1:11:50] reason it was not open, the reason he
[1:11:52] did not reveal it, no one should know
[1:11:53] about it. But I want you to know before
[1:11:55] I even knew any word about it, that
[1:11:57] vision come here. It goes now. That
[1:11:59] vision come years ago. You remember
[1:12:01] that? the vision of the tent. And here
[1:12:06] it is.
[1:12:08] Just as this other has
[1:12:11] slides straight into the word,
[1:12:14] the prophet slid it in there, the tent
[1:12:17] vision with the thunders, and gave us
[1:12:20] the open part.
[1:12:27] Gave us the seven thunders. We'll give
[1:12:29] him the open part. We'll let him preach
[1:12:31] the seven thunders, but when he hits
[1:12:33] that middle part, don't worry, brother.
[1:12:36] Amen. We'll be there.
[1:12:40] Oh my, what a faith to know you have the
[1:12:44] right revelation.
[1:12:46] You can call down Elohim this morning.
[1:12:50] Where is the Lord God of Elijah?
[1:12:54] Where is Jehovah Elohim?
[1:12:56] Let the God that wrote the word come
[1:12:59] forth and prove to these people.
[1:13:06] Glory.
[1:13:09] Let that God come forth.
[1:13:13] Hallelujah.
[1:13:16] Praise God. Amen.
[1:13:19] Here he is.
[1:13:24] Hallelujah. Praise God. Thank you Jesus.

[1:21:50] I've seen meetings where the power of
[1:21:53] God was revealed to the people
[1:21:56] that they were free from the world and
[1:21:57] the things of the world.
[1:22:01] And the joy of the Lord filled the

[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:39] Let me speak to these young people in a
[1:24:41] minute here. You young people here are
[1:24:43] special something to you. Amen.
[1:24:45] The proof of this truth is that the fact
[1:24:47] that the Lord Jesus was tempted in all
[1:24:49] things as we are. But he was without
[1:24:52] sin.
[1:24:54] Sin is what? Unbelief.
[1:24:57] Even if you don't have the Holy Ghost,
[1:24:58] you're a seed of God. So be without sin.
[1:25:02] Don't feel that you have committed that
[1:25:04] mortal sin that you're finished. Uh-uh.
[1:25:07] That's the devil trying to make you
[1:25:08] finish. Think you're finished, but you
[1:25:11] hang in there. Oh, you hold the C's
[1:25:13] unchanging hand. Don't you stop. You
[1:25:17] keep moving on. You keep walking up God
[1:25:19] C's Hill. Glory to God. Don't look to
[1:25:22] the left and don't look to the right.
[1:25:24] God's going to seal you. God's going to
[1:25:26] use you. God's going to fill you. Glory.
[1:25:29] Come on, you young people. Praise God.
[1:25:32] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:25:34] Satan, he comes after the young people
[1:25:37] and strikes at them because they have
[1:25:40] experienced temptation. And he know that
[1:25:42] they don't know how to handle the
[1:25:43] temptation. And notice he suggests to
[1:25:46] the young people that because they have
[1:25:48] found themselves in a situation or
[1:25:50] because these thoughts and ideas have
[1:25:53] come to their minds that they are guilty
[1:25:55] by association.
[1:25:58] See the devil, we're not ignorant
[1:26:00] Satan's devices. That's a Greek word
[1:26:02] thoughts. So you young people, the devil
[1:26:05] will think his thoughts that you're
[1:26:06] filthy, you're dirty, you had lustful
[1:26:09] thoughts in your mind, sexual thoughts.
[1:26:11] That's a lie from the pit of hell.
[1:26:14] Glory.
[1:26:16] You are God's children.
[1:26:19] You hold on to God. Change your hand.
[1:26:22] Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Your mom and
[1:26:24] your daddies are praying for you. Your
[1:26:26] pastor's praying for you. Come on. Hold
[1:26:29] on. Hold on. Hold on. Praise God. God's
[1:26:33] going to seal you, young people.
[1:26:36] Oh, hallelujah. So I say to young
[1:26:38] people, take the word of God. You tell
[1:26:41] that devil when he tell you you thought
[1:26:43] this here, you had a dirty thought,
[1:26:45] young lady, young man, you say, "I'm a
[1:26:47] seed of God."
[1:26:49] Talk back to that devil. Praise God.
[1:26:51] Look ahead, Satan. Let me give you my
[1:26:54] testimony. Way back before the
[1:26:56] foundation of the world, God loved me.
[1:27:00] Hallelujah. Glory. Amen for his spot.
[1:27:04] Glory.
[1:27:05] Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:27:08] Hallelujah.
[1:27:11] [Applause]
[1:27:14] You young people tell Satan, "Satan,
[1:27:17] take your filthy thoughts off of my
[1:27:19] battlefield."
[1:27:21] [Applause]
[1:27:23] Praise God.
[1:27:25] Hallelujah. Fight those devils off. Pull
[1:27:27] your sword out.
[1:27:29] [Applause]
[1:27:31] Shout your devils to hell.
[1:27:35] this stuff. I'm a child of the king. My
[1:27:38] mommy and my daddy are praying for me. I
[1:27:40] know who I am. I know where I come from.
[1:27:42] I know where I'm going.
[1:27:47] [Applause]
[1:27:50] God.
[1:27:52] Hallelujah.
[1:27:54] Glory. You young people overcome by
[1:27:58] recognizing Satan and every one of his
[1:28:00] dirty tricks.
[1:28:03] Hallelujah. You must realize that this
[1:28:07] message has overcome every devil.
[1:28:11] And you can overcome by knowing greater
[1:28:15] is he that is in you than he the devil
[1:28:20] that's trying to stop.
[1:28:22] The whole thing of it is the devil is
[1:28:25] jealous because you're sons and
[1:28:26] daughters of God.
[1:28:31] Amen. What a revelation.
[1:28:35] He jealous demons.
[1:28:38] Greed poison eye jealousy.
[1:28:41] Glory. See there. He knows who you are.
[1:28:46] That's why he comes to you.
[1:28:48] Get out of here, Satan. Get back, Satan.
[1:28:52] Glory to God.
[1:28:55] Hallelujah.
[1:28:57] So I say young people, old people,

[1:29:16] omnipotent conqueror,
[1:29:19] ready to take dominion through his
[1:29:21] bride.
[1:29:27] will be the ones who truly manifest the
[1:29:29] Lord
[1:29:32] and be his body and be his voice
[1:29:37] and perform his works.
[1:29:39] Hallelujah. Do you see it?
[1:29:42] God raised up others.
[1:29:44] And so it has gone on through the years
[1:29:48] until in this last day.
[1:29:51] There is again another people in the
[1:29:52] land
[1:29:54] who under their messenger
[1:29:57] will be the final voice to the final
[1:30:00] aid.
[1:30:02] Is that where you're coming from,
[1:30:03] brother Coleman? I sure am. This is the
[1:30:07] final voice to the final aid.
[1:30:12] Amen.

[1:32:09] Oh, hallelujah. Here we are. Glory to
[1:32:13] God.
[1:32:19] Then I'm finished then. That's my burden
[1:32:23] to get that to you.
[1:32:27] So these demons
[1:32:29] with two capstones,
[1:32:31] they are busted.
[1:32:34] Busted.
[1:32:36] That David
[1:32:38] is here tonight.

[1:32:47] It's finished.
[1:32:49] You are redeemed.

[1:32:57] Ruth, you are now going to be rewarded
[1:33:02] by receiving Boaz,
[1:33:05] the person of Jesus.
[1:33:09] My God.
[1:33:11] Good thing you stayed with it, Ruth.
[1:33:15] Good thing you stayed with Naomi
[1:33:19] in the Old Testament.
[1:33:21] Good thing you told Naomi
[1:33:24] everywhere.

[1:33:39] Ruth rewarded
[1:33:41] the person,
[1:33:43] Christ, his spirit, his life, his
[1:33:48] ministry, minister, his person. And let
[1:33:51] the redeemed say so. We are redeemed,
[1:33:55] the coming of the headstone,
[1:33:57] a turn cornerstone,
[1:33:59] a precious cornerstone,
[1:34:01] a living stone. What does redeem mean
[1:34:05] in the dictionary? Redeem means to buy
[1:34:09] back
[1:34:11] means to repurchase
[1:34:14] to liberate by payment.

[1:34:35] redeemed.
[1:34:38] I come down myself.

[1:34:43] no minister.
[1:34:45] This will be my minister.
[1:34:47] My people, they'll know it's me. The
[1:34:51] same one that was in the prophet,
[1:34:53] they'll recognize.
[1:35:01] Glory to God. My God. What's going on?
[1:35:06] What's going on? Another manifestation.
[1:35:10] Another manifestation of the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:13] The devil couldn't stop it. Hallelujah.
[1:35:16] Hallelujah. This is a manifestation.
[1:35:19] The devil or demon can stop this
[1:35:23] manifestation.

[1:36:31] How can I wind up my message this
[1:36:33] morning? What can I say to what has
[1:36:35] already been said before I go out of
[1:36:37] here? Cuz I know the Holy Ghost is here.
[1:36:40] I know you can be sealed. No devil tell
[1:36:43] me you cannot be sealed today. Praise
[1:36:46] God. You're free to be sealed and healed
[1:36:49] and delivered and restored. Oh, glory to
[1:36:52] God.
[1:36:54] What can I say? Church, let me finish up
[1:36:57] on this here. A deceived church at page
[1:37:00] 81. The church, here's the only hope I
[1:37:02] have for this morning to wind up my
[1:37:04] message is this. While Samson was bound,
[1:37:08] A a new shock of hair grow out.
[1:37:12] Bound bound bound and the latter rain
[1:37:16] comes in the spring to make that new
[1:37:19] crop. Glory to God. God sends another
[1:37:23] church just before the end time that the
[1:37:27] power of the Holy Ghost can come into
[1:37:28] her and the demonstration of the spirit.
[1:37:31] And St. Mark 16, follow the church. Acts
[1:37:34] 2:4, Acts 2:38. All of it will be
[1:37:37] following right along with the church.
[1:37:39] Signs, wonders accompanying his
[1:37:41] apostles. Great signs of his
[1:37:43] resurrection accompany them. While we're
[1:37:45] in prison, surely,
[1:37:49] surely,
[1:37:51] while we're in the famine, surely God's
[1:37:54] got a crop somewhere.
[1:37:57] While the world is dead, surely there's
[1:38:00] a place that will start in January,
[1:38:04] February, March, April, May, June, July.
[1:38:08] She's in the harvest. Then the world can
[1:38:11] come and see the harvest. Oh, surely the
[1:38:15] Lord God has got a crop somewhere.
[1:38:18] He's got a people somewhere that can
[1:38:21] receive seed.
[1:38:28] Surely God's growing a crop somewhere
[1:38:33] for the last great kill. Surely he's got
[1:38:37] a place
[1:38:40] before the time before the door shuts.
[1:38:43] [Music]
[1:38:50] It cannot fail.
[1:38:53] Okay.
[1:38:55] The children of the kingdom is to become
[1:38:57] the seed maybe seated seed of God for
[1:39:00] their age. Then they must be the word of
[1:39:02] God manifested
[1:39:05] in the age that they are living in and
[1:39:08] the manifestation just like Luther had
[1:39:10] his, Wesley had theirs, the Pentecostal
[1:39:13] had theirs with the Holy Ghost and the
[1:39:14] birth and the gifts and so forth. And we
[1:39:17] ought to go right into the perfection of
[1:39:19] the son of man when we will be the same
[1:39:22] self person.
[1:39:24] That's the manifestation I'm looking
[1:39:26] for. That will be manifested reality,
[1:39:30] whole voice, word, abiding glory.
[1:39:36] Yes sir.
[1:39:39] Amen.
[1:39:40] Glory. You may be seated. In order to be
[1:39:43] the promised seed of that age, we have
[1:39:46] lived through three stages. Luther,
[1:39:47] Westy, Pentecostals. Now, we come down
[1:39:50] to a reflection of Jesus Christ on this
[1:39:53] earth. And we have to be a reflection.
[1:39:55] I'll prove it to you this morning.
[1:39:58] There's no other way out. We lived it
[1:40:00] out in order to have a church age.
[1:40:04] Brother Bram said, you had to have age
[1:40:07] and history, a word, the message. We
[1:40:10] come down then all the other ages lived
[1:40:12] out. Come down to our age and the seven
[1:40:16] seals brought it on 1963 through 65 and
[1:40:20] brother Brown said that our age is
[1:40:22] coming on now. He said our age the seven
[1:40:25] seal opens up. There's nothing there.
[1:40:28] It'll be a prophetic gift that will
[1:40:30] reveal what's to be in the bride age.
[1:40:36] Are you hearing me? and all who will be
[1:40:39] under the seventh seal.
[1:40:42] May be seated. Amen. Prophetic gift.
[1:40:46] Now, now remember, there was no history
[1:40:49] of the bride age yet in 1963, four and
[1:40:52] five. Now in 1966,
[1:40:55] the shadow of the king coming to camp.
[1:40:58] The history is on.
[1:41:00] Hallelujah.
[1:41:02] Glory to God. Do you understand? How
[1:41:05] many understand what I'm talking about?
[1:41:07] You are living out the bride age now.
[1:41:12] Now are you the sons of God. It does not
[1:41:14] appear what you shall be. But when he
[1:41:17] shall appear the shakina, you shall be
[1:41:19] like him. He'll dip down in the bucket
[1:41:22] of love and smear you all over to make
[1:41:26] sure to make sure
[1:41:29] that you'll be like him. Praise God. is
[1:41:32] going to be. There's not enough devils
[1:41:34] in in the universe that can stop it.
[1:41:39] 200,000,000 devils is not enough.
[1:41:42] There's going to be a bride. There's
[1:41:44] going to be a rapture. There's going to
[1:41:46] be a resurrection. It's a vindicated
[1:41:49] voice word. It's already vindicated.
[1:41:56] Glory to God.
[1:42:00] Hallelujah.
[1:42:02] Do you get it? Hallelujah.
[1:42:06] A history, a age. The seven seal message
[1:42:11] is going on now.
[1:42:14] Our age now. Page 32 and 33. Christ is
[1:42:18] the mis of God revealed. All the all the
[1:42:21] the bride types in the B in the Bible.
[1:42:23] They were Christ was being revealed in
[1:42:26] them. All the prophets, Joseph and
[1:42:30] Daniel and David, he was bringing out
[1:42:32] something. His first coming
[1:42:35] was being revealed through the prophets
[1:42:37] and all the characters in Hebrews. They
[1:42:39] were coming into his first coming. Then
[1:42:42] he came.
[1:42:44] Oh hallelujah.
[1:42:46] Now the seven church ages was bringing
[1:42:48] out something coming on. Then Luther, he
[1:42:52] began to reveal something. Justification
[1:42:55] and then Wesley sanctification. Then the
[1:42:58] Pentecostals the open door. No man can
[1:43:01] shut the door. No man can open it. I the
[1:43:04] Lord have set that door. Catch that
[1:43:07] door. The resurrection is at hand.
[1:43:10] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:43:14] Coming on to something. Then if Luther
[1:43:16] Wesley the Pentecostals was revealing
[1:43:19] their age
[1:43:22] page 33 took them thunders threw them in
[1:43:25] the sky to let the whole world know
[1:43:28] there's a bride being called out and
[1:43:31] they are going to reveal the bride age.
[1:43:37] Hallelujah.
[1:43:39] You are revealing the bride age and God
[1:43:43] has brought you together to pour out the
[1:43:45] Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[1:43:53] Here he brought you together today.
[1:43:56] Hallelujah. From Connecticut, Long
[1:43:59] Island, Jersey, Baltimore. Praise Scott.
[1:44:03] Fort Wayne, Indiana, Tulsa, Europe is
[1:44:06] being poured out. South Africa is being
[1:44:09] poured out. It's here. You are the
[1:44:13] bride.
[1:44:16] You are revealing Christ. There's nobody
[1:44:18] else.
[1:44:21] The denominations is revealing the world
[1:44:24] council.
[1:44:25] Rome is revealing Rome. But praise God,
[1:44:29] you are the word. You are revealing the
[1:44:31] word.
[1:44:36] Here's
[1:44:43] a Bible.
[1:44:46] It has seven straps on it. Can you see
[1:44:49] it?
[1:44:51] I just read a quote. Seven straps.
[1:44:53] There's the seven straps. Now, the lamb.
[1:44:57] Hallelujah.
[1:45:00] He came forth.
[1:45:02] He took that first seal and ripped it
[1:45:04] open.
[1:45:08] Did he do it?
[1:45:10] Can I say, can you say amen?
[1:45:14] Hallelujah.
[1:45:15] He took that second seal and ripped it
[1:45:18] open. The third, the fourth, the fifth,
[1:45:22] the sixth.
[1:45:25] There they are today in the message
[1:45:27] preaching six seals.
[1:45:30] The book is closed of them. Isaiah 28,
[1:45:33] it's closed. Six seals. That's all they
[1:45:36] can preach. But to you,
[1:45:40] all seven seals, praise God, is open.
[1:45:45] Jubilee time. Where was thou when the
[1:45:48] sons of God shouted for joy and the
[1:45:50] morning stars sang together, preached
[1:45:53] them seven seals. Hallelujah. Glory to
[1:45:57] God.
[1:46:01] Do you see it now?
[1:46:03] Do you see what they're doing to you?
[1:46:05] You ministers
[1:46:13] the Did the lamb break it? Did the lamb
[1:46:16] open it? Hallelujah.
[1:46:19] Glory. Hallelujah. Everybody heard that.
[1:46:22] John,

[1:46:31] Glory.
[1:46:39] and reveal the three-fold mystery of God
[1:46:41] to take the bride by and by a third
[1:46:45] exodus back to Eden again.
[1:46:49] You're going home, but you have to be in
[1:46:52] the same condition.
[1:46:58] You can't go in the resurrection without
[1:47:00] the Eden condition.
[1:47:02] the spoken word. That's why he brought
[1:47:04] it out.
[1:47:06] Oh, praise God.
[1:47:10] Amen. Amen.
[1:47:13] Glorio.

[1:47:33] to Eden again. The revelation of the
[1:47:35] seven seals, seven thunder mysteries are
[1:47:38] your
[1:47:40] redemptive rights. And there's no
[1:47:43] minister,
[1:47:45] no bishop potentate, no minister in this
[1:47:49] message or any message is going to take
[1:47:51] my seven se redemptive rights.
[1:47:54] That's mine.
[1:47:56] I come from God and I go back to God.
[1:48:00] I'm traveling like a thought. Get a good
[1:48:02] look at me cuz I won't be here long.
[1:48:06] I'll see you in the resurrection,
[1:48:07] brother. I'll see you in the rapture.
[1:48:10] Hallelujah.
[1:48:12] We're going out of here on the rapture

[1:48:36] anybody take your redemptive rights.

[1:48:45] man got anything to do with you. You're
[1:48:47] God's bride and you're free. Free at
[1:48:51] last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty.
[1:48:55] Free at last.

[1:49:34] seventh un revelation, seventh on the
[1:49:35] mysteries are your redemptive rights.
[1:49:40] And you now have the authority to take
[1:49:43] back from Satan what is rightfully
[1:49:46] yours.
[1:49:50] Satan,
[1:49:51] give it back. That's mine. Get your
[1:49:55] dirty hands off of my title D.
[1:49:59] You filthy devil. You get out of hell.
[1:50:02] Praise God. Back up, devil.
[1:50:07] Back those devils up. Praise God. Don't
[1:50:10] you be afraid.
[1:50:17] Amen, Elizabeth.
[1:50:22] Praise God.
[1:50:34] Hallelujah.
[1:50:36] Oh man.
[1:50:39] Take me to the water.
[1:50:42] Take me to the water.
[1:50:45] Take me to the water to be baptized.
[1:50:50] There's power in the water.
[1:50:53] Oh, hallelujah. I feel good tonight. I
[1:50:56] feel like I'm going to be healed
[1:50:57] tonight.
[1:51:01] Hallelujah. The devil can't Satan, get
[1:51:05] out of here, you diabetic devil.
[1:51:08] The prophet done prayed for me. I have
[1:51:10] my strength, my health.
[1:51:13] My wife blind eye come open. Sh.
[1:51:19] You're healed. You can receive the Holy
[1:51:21] Ghost
[1:51:31] here because that's where he told me to
[1:51:34] go take the book from the angel's hand.
[1:51:38] And when I asked the angel for the book
[1:51:40] in prayer, he said, "I'll give you
[1:51:42] specially designed messages between
[1:51:45] September 8th and November 17th to bring
[1:51:48] down
[1:51:50] the power of God in your church."
[1:51:55] So what has happened for 24 years?
[1:51:59] The foundation was laid.
[1:52:02] The age was identified. Brotherly
[1:52:05] kindness went to the angel, asked for
[1:52:08] the book, eat the book, sweet in the
[1:52:11] mouth. I didn't know, but there was
[1:52:13] coming forth a revelation that was going
[1:52:15] to be sweet in the mouth, but bitter in
[1:52:17] the belly. And November 11th, he said,
[1:52:20] "Now, you can't you can't stay here. You
[1:52:22] have to go out." I said, "Go out there
[1:52:24] and preach this." And he told me, "Just
[1:52:28] call them builders, caretakers, and
[1:52:30] dignitaries. That's all. and preach the
[1:52:32] word for 24 years. And that's what I've
[1:52:35] done. What was I doing?
[1:52:39] Building the body work on top of the
[1:52:42] foundation.
[1:52:50] What am I doing? October 18, 1998.
[1:52:55] laying in the capstone
[1:52:58] on top of the bodywork on top of the
[1:53:01] foundation.
[1:53:03] Hallelujah.
[1:53:04] This day these scriptures are fulfilled
[1:53:08] in your sight. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:53:12] Where is the Lord God of Elijah? Let the
[1:53:15] God that wrote the word, praise God,
[1:53:18] come forth and prove the word from here
[1:53:20] on out. Hallelujah. as Elisha. Follow
[1:53:25] Elijah. That's He said you follow me and
[1:53:28] he give you the same thing and the same
[1:53:31] power to rest on him. Rest on Elisha.
[1:53:34] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:53:36] forever. The capstone of love is here to
[1:53:40] seal you up. Seal up the pyramids of
[1:53:42] your lives. This here is already in you
[1:53:46] already in mechanics. All we waiting for
[1:53:48] now is the dynamics. Hallelujah. Are you
[1:53:52] ready? Glory. Do you understand the
[1:53:56] revelation now? Joseph perfection.
[1:54:00] Here's the body work. The seven thunders
[1:54:02] are the seven voices. Here they are of
[1:54:05] the seven church ages. And now and
[1:54:08] brotherly kindness had to be identified
[1:54:10] and it was. And today I have identified
[1:54:14] capstone, headstone, chief cornerstone,
[1:54:16] cornerstone
[1:54:18] for what? for the manifestation of the
[1:54:21] sons of God right here.
[1:54:26] Did the others come to pass?
[1:54:29] Well, so shall this come to pass.
[1:54:32] Well, hallelujah.
[1:54:41] But when your joy becomes the Lord,
[1:54:46] everything else finished God
[1:54:50] finish with the world finish with this
[1:54:53] finish with that. It doesn't satisfy
[1:54:56] God satisfied.
[1:54:58] Then he becomes your joy
[1:55:02] because you was his joy. Hebrews 12 for
[1:55:06] the joy that set before me. He saw you
[1:55:10] on that cross and for the joy of having
[1:55:13] you with him, he died for us.
[1:55:17] Can't you die in your flesh? Praise God.
[1:55:20] Know that God has commissioned New York
[1:55:22] City to come forward sanctified. Praise
[1:55:26] God. And bring on this mighty explosion.
[1:55:30] Praise God. Back to the Bible. Back to
[1:55:33] the principles laid down on the day of
[1:55:35] Pentecost. Hallelujah. There's going to
[1:55:37] be somebody that'll come out of here.
[1:55:40] Hallelujah.
[1:55:44] Praise God. God be praised. God be
[1:55:47] praised. You know he dropped down here
[1:55:51] just now. You know it's not a man
[1:55:53] speaking. Praise God. You know that
[1:56:00] for the joy.
[1:56:06] Praise God.
[1:56:09] Despise the shame.
[1:56:12] For the joy of the Lord, I go on my job
[1:56:15] and despise the shame. The critics and
[1:56:19] the rest on my job, among my friends,
[1:56:22] among my family. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:56:27] Worrying about Uncle Tutu and daddy,
[1:56:29] this one and that one. Praise God.
[1:56:32] Forget about it. Praise God. Uncle Tutu
[1:56:35] can't save you. He wouldn't give you a
[1:56:37] dime if he had it.
[1:56:48] Brother, I feel strange. Hallelujah.
[1:56:51] Hallelujah. Praise. Somebody in here is
[1:56:53] going to come out of here. Somebody's
[1:56:55] going to come out of here. Praise God.
[1:56:58] Somebody going to serve God. Somebody.
[1:57:04] Amen, brothers. God bless you.
[1:57:07] Hallelujah. Praise God. God heal me.
[1:57:10] Praise Lord heal me. Hallelujah.
[1:57:14] Can preach the word of God again.
[1:57:18] Glory.
[1:57:20] Amen.
[1:57:25] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:57:27] [Music]
[1:57:31] Hallelujah.
[1:57:33] Glory to God. He's here
[1:57:42] and we're getting ready to start it. And
[1:57:45] that can only be done by the dynamics
[1:57:49] because he said at the finishing of the
[1:57:51] seventh seal, you should be way up there
[1:57:54] to know who God is, how he lives,
[1:57:58] who he is. Huh? And the only way you can
[1:58:01] know be way up there is faith, virtue,
[1:58:04] knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:58:05] kindness, brother, kindness, charity.
[1:58:07] Then you be way up there to know who he
[1:58:09] is, where it comes from, what what is he
[1:58:12] doing? Praise God.
[1:58:17] Amen. That's the finishing of the seven
[1:58:20] seal. God is so anxious to to uh uh uh
[1:58:24] put you out to the to this uh uh uh
[1:58:27] professing church age. That's right. In
[1:58:30] this message, he wants to unveil you out
[1:58:33] here. He wants to finish you up though.
[1:58:35] Put the finishing touches on you. Fresh
[1:58:38] you up in a rainbow coat. Oh, praise
[1:58:40] God. Hallelujah.
[1:58:43] Yes, sir. Oh my.
[1:58:49] Amen.
[1:58:51] Okay, you may be seated. It will be
[1:58:52] Christ finishing up the seventh seal,
[1:58:54] doing the final work of redemption. The
[1:58:58] word is doing the work of redemption in
[1:59:00] you now. But he wants to come forth as a
[1:59:03] dynamics to do the final work. Finishing
[1:59:07] touch. Huh? You be dressed with the
[1:59:10] right coat on.
[1:59:14] Yes sir.
[1:59:16] By the Holy Spirit itself even the
[1:59:18] dynamic to your mechanics. Jesus said be
[1:59:20] one as the father and I are one. Then
[1:59:22] how will it be? The word in us would be
[1:59:24] the anointed word. That is the oneness
[1:59:27] of God. See the oneness of God is the
[1:59:29] word anointed in you. See, and then you
[1:59:31] become a son, a messiah for the age of
[1:59:35] messenger of the resurrection.
[1:59:40] How do I become a messenger? Show you
[1:59:42] though the the the resurrection is in
[1:59:44] you.
[1:59:47] So you know where you going.
[1:59:50] You know you're going to the
[1:59:52] resurrection cuz you adopted. You get on
[1:59:54] the seven color rainbow coat, signs and
[1:59:57] wonders and miracles. You're speaking
[1:59:59] the word of God. You're creating.
[2:00:02] Huh? So then you become a messenger of
[2:00:05] the oncoming resurrection.
[2:00:08] Great power, lightning and thunderbolts
[2:00:11] of lightning flashing here, flashing
[2:00:13] there, and you become a direct witness.
[2:00:20] Amen. Can't you live for that?
[2:00:24] Now watch. When the mysteries that's
[2:00:26] been hid since the foundation of the
[2:00:29] world is to be made known by the
[2:00:32] manifested sons of God. Now hardly
[2:00:35] anybody in this message even understand
[2:00:36] that.
[2:00:38] Why? According to Malachi 4, now watch.
[2:00:42] According to Malachi 4 5 and 6, the
[2:00:45] faith has been restored back. Can we say
[2:00:48] amen?
[2:00:50] Number two, according to St. Luke 17:30,
[2:00:54] the Messiah has been introduced. Can we
[2:00:57] say amen?
[2:01:00] Three, according to Revelation 10:1-7,
[2:01:04] all of the hidden mysteries in the
[2:01:06] Bible, including the thunders, has been
[2:01:08] revealed. Can we say amen?
[2:01:12] Well, there's your three scriptures.
[2:01:14] It's all done.
[2:01:20] I'm trying to give you a little parable
[2:01:21] not to fall into these four groups. You
[2:01:25] know, everybody, somebody, anybody,
[2:01:27] nobody. But don't be ashamed of, you
[2:01:30] know, of the gospel. Step out there. So,
[2:01:32] everybody and somebody and anybody and
[2:01:36] nobody. There was an important job to do
[2:01:40] and a service to be done. And Malachi 4
[2:01:43] left and we had about give us about the
[2:01:46] space of a half an hour. Now number one
[2:01:49] now it was there right? Seven thunders
[2:01:53] gathers the bride together gives faith
[2:01:55] show you how to prepare. It's there.
[2:01:58] Amen.
[2:02:00] Anybody could pick it up. It's just
[2:02:03] there for everybody. Didn't matter any
[2:02:07] race,
[2:02:09] any creed, color. It doesn't matter. The
[2:02:13] prophet left anybody in Africa or Europe
[2:02:17] or anywhere could pick it up. That's
[2:02:20] what it's for. It's for the seeds of God
[2:02:22] from heaven, not from this earth. So
[2:02:26] therefore, he left the job to be done.
[2:02:28] Number one, and everybody was asked to
[2:02:31] do it. Everybody was included, all races
[2:02:34] and kinds. Number two, everybody was
[2:02:37] sure somebody would do it. Number three,
[2:02:41] anybody could have done it. Amen.
[2:02:43] Anybody, any minister, any person, any
[2:02:46] brother could have uh said what the
[2:02:49] prophet said. Anybody could have said
[2:02:51] it. Huh?
[2:02:56] Number four, but nobody did it. My
[2:03:01] somebody got angry about that because it
[2:03:05] was everybody's job. Everybody thought
[2:03:09] anybody could do it, but nobody realized
[2:03:12] that everybody would not do it. Oh,
[2:03:16] hallelujah. Thine the glory.
[2:03:19] I started singing that.
[2:03:23] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:03:26] Yes, sir.
[2:03:29] Praise God. And now the climax. It ended
[2:03:32] up that everybody blamed somebody. Don't
[2:03:37] you worry when the dynamic strikes the
[2:03:39] churches in the message then everybody
[2:03:43] is going to blame somebody when actually
[2:03:46] nobody asked anybody.
[2:03:51] So there we are. So Lord
[2:03:56] don't let me be everybody somebody
[2:03:59] anybody nobody. I thank God for an
[2:04:01] elected predestinated bride. Praise God.
[2:04:04] way back in Elohim's mind. That's not a
[2:04:07] shame of the gospel. That's not a shame
[2:04:09] of what the prophet declared. Why?
[2:04:13] Because you come from the back part of
[2:04:16] Elohim's mind.
[2:04:20] They didn't know what he was talking
[2:04:21] about.
[2:04:23] They didn't have a clue.
[2:04:26] He spoke to you. You become part of the
[2:04:29] logos. Lo, I come in the volume of the
[2:04:32] book. Praise God. So, we are not
[2:04:35] everybody, somebody, nobody, anybody.
[2:04:37] Brother, we're part of Elohim. We We
[2:04:40] rotated off of the mind of God. We can't
[2:04:44] help it. We have to speak. And my word
[2:04:47] should not return to me void.
[2:04:49] Hallelujah. Praise God. Well, praise the
[2:04:53] Lord. God bless you.
[2:05:00] [Music]
[2:07:03] And the great shepherd was smitten. The
[2:07:05] great sheep prophet when he is
[2:07:07] smitten back there. said, "It is
[2:07:09] finished."
[2:07:11] And that minute, as soon as this
[2:07:13] shepherd was smitten,
[2:07:17] sin is settled. There was no more sin.
[2:07:19] They were clean. The penalty was paid.
[2:07:22] The believers whose names were written
[2:07:24] in the book of life, predestinated from
[2:07:26] the foundation of the world, it was
[2:07:28] finished. That very minute that Jesus
[2:07:30] said it was finished, he the great
[2:07:31] shepherd had come for his sheep. It was
[2:07:33] finished. God's right hand was pulled
[2:07:36] from his bosom, smitten. Then on Easter,
[2:07:39] he returned it. Amen. Raised it up again
[2:07:43] to his bosom and extended it down to you
[2:07:46] and I in the form of his word to redeem
[2:07:50] us back to the original garden from
[2:07:53] which
[2:07:54] from the hidden secret of his great
[2:07:58] heart was revealed by a prophet
[2:08:01] shepherd.
[2:08:03] It was revealed by a shepherd, prophet
[2:08:06] shepherd. No wonder the mountain jumped
[2:08:09] and shouted on that day. No wonder the
[2:08:12] sun hit his face and screamed for joy.
[2:08:16] No wonder all nature broke loose. The
[2:08:18] wind shook the trees until they shook
[2:08:20] and shook and joyed and jumped.
[2:08:25] They seen the prophet shepherd on the
[2:08:28] mountain redeem every name on the book
[2:08:31] of life. happened. They seen that their
[2:08:33] own nature was redeemed.
[2:08:35] They screamed and jumped and the world
[2:08:38] went into an earthquake and the
[2:08:40] mountains rent and the rocks fell out
[2:08:42] and the sun went down and and everything
[2:08:45] taking place like any meeting
[2:08:49] when the shepherd reveals to you that
[2:08:52] it's finished.
[2:08:54] They're asking jumping spells and joy
[2:08:57] spells, but there was nobody hurt.
[2:09:00] The mountains rung out and the the sun
[2:09:03] went down and everything took place, but
[2:09:05] there was nobody hurt. Now, I've seen
[2:09:08] meetings where the power of God was
[2:09:10] revealed to the people that they were
[2:09:11] free from the world and the things of
[2:09:13] the world. And the joy of the Lord
[2:09:15] killed the congregation. They stood and
[2:09:17] screamed and cried and shouted to the
[2:09:20] top of their voice for the glory of God.
[2:09:21] I never did see anything disorderly.
[2:09:25] It was always right and order. because
[2:09:28] they had recognized that their name that
[2:09:30] had been written on the lamb's book of
[2:09:32] life before the foundation of the world,
[2:09:34] the great prophet shepherd had brought
[2:09:37] them the message and they were
[2:09:38] delivered. The prophet shepherd, no
[2:09:40] matter what the other ecclesiastical rim
[2:09:43] said about it, they knew what had
[2:09:44] happened just as them shepherds did back
[2:09:46] there. They knew what took place.
[2:09:50] No man has a right to enter the sacred
[2:09:52] desk to preach the word until he has did
[2:09:55] as Moses did. meet God himself upon
[2:09:59] ground
[2:10:00] where that there's no theologian can
[2:10:03] explain it away.
