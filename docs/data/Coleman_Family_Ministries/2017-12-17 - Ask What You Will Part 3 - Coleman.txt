well praise God so well friends I'm here tonight amen glorious right Amen glory audio amen praise God I like to invite your attention to st. the Gospel of st. John 15 in Ephesians 1 in Ephesians 4 I'm reading from st. John 15 for verse first seven eight if he invited me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will shall be done unto you I'm hearing it's my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples and st. Ephesians one over in the promised land in the land of the son of man amen glory first Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ and that's what but Nathanael told this morning he already did he hath already blessed us according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself to himself according to the good pleasure of his will Ephesians 4 verse 11 and if some apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ so we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God into a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ they gather blessed and read him his word so there's nobody gonna slip out first because we have to wait until we all come amen so you don't have to worry as it in this place or as a nap it's not till we all come into the unity of the faith amen wonderful where you may be seated praise God well friends brother Norman I believe a lot of my friends here have some of the tapes and from back in the the new warning a man and way back in 73 a preach asked what you will part one then I've reached 75 1975 asked what you will part two so we want to finish it up tonight ask what you will part three amen well glory a man may be seated [Applause] my subject is the manifestation of the sons of God on the Bryant's third phase so by faith I'm stepping out and saying there will be a manifestation of the sons of God on the third phase where the spirit meets the sons a man this is our promise so is speaking my inspiration is first Corinthians 4 20 for the king of God is not in word but in power amen well praise God so I like the kind of thought that people are new and they come son been here for years and different degrees and whatever well like to kind of kind of nail it down in a couple of paragraphs what the message is and this is from a message I preached it's a long time ago now we what we here for now we're starting out so we can positionally find our place to be ready for the out of the great battle I saw is winding down now at World Council of Churches and all these things is going to come into view and the bride is coming along also hey man [Applause] amen Jason praise God it's okay and read something to you it's my own thoughts here positionally finding your place to be ready for the hour of battle though word is in the church in the person this is all prophesied see in other words the seed germ is in the body like it was in the Apostolic pride like it was a malachi for him and you believed that what was spoken by Jesus Christ was confirmed back amen unto the people by them that heard him is that correct God also bearing witness both with signs wonders miracles divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost to his a according to his own will but holy ghost says here did some speaking this about faith now and this was a long time ago here so I'm saying the Holy Ghost is here on the third phase to perform this very thing with the Omega bride as he did with the Alpha bride amen now what is it may be seated the placing of the gifts and callings in Ephesians by the voice angel of revelation 10 8 through 11 which all these years was a manifestation to us of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is that angel tryna get us back to the Bible so we ever cross the world he had an anointing he had a revelation to get the people back to the Bible and that's what the thunders is all about a song no arguments no nothing we don't argue with anybody may be seated a lot of people say the Seventh Seal is closed and they're ready to fight and argue we say is open and we're praising God's name amen we don't have any quarrels on anybody it's opened a god said soul through the Prophet so I'm not going with these people amen praise the Lord okay oh and that was the angel now that angel has crossed over to Ephesians 4 the voicings you all these years by a manifestation of the Holy Spirit in the different churches that picked up the inspiration and the revelation that was the angel in your church trying to get you back to the Bible back to the Bible back to the Bible amen it was a it was an angel by the guidry a man now they ain't just crossed over and he may be seen he wants to come through the body but the CJ comes through the body we are here the season is right the time is right I believe Elana thanyou said soul said nothing left before cherry to come down because the word is in the people and a people has come along praise God hallelujah to let God prove that he's in the people amen everything is right the hours come may be seated and the time is at hand for the bride to have these vindicated promises the manifestations of fivefold ministry as messengers of the Resurrection Christ shall come into them from revelation 10 move old Ephesians 4 amen and then the people will begin to see the reflection of the on coming Sun the resurrection at hand Run For Your Lives praise God hallelujah amen the manifestation of the fivefold ministry as messengers of the Resurrection what they're going to be here for they here specifically to call you to the resurrection a man by imparting eternal life unto you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then honing you into the perfect image of Jesus Christ and then God pulling you aside and visit you with an angel the voice of the Archangel and there the true baptism of the Holy Ghost comes upon you and then you're in the Covenant Hey then at the spirit that brought in Jesus Christ also telling you he shall quicken your mortal bodies praise God but he prays father let the fire fall amen okay you may be seated you might pull me off the platform amen okay everybody feeling fine if I'm feeling all right North the messages now I just read it to you for what it is [Applause] amen brother gnat toy you this morning okay you were born for purpose amen and all the things and the mistakes that you will make between now and the resurrection God knew it before the foundation of the world they put a brother Tom in there for you so you cannot fail you cannot fall [Applause] amen David praise God you may be seated there hey man hey man hey amen amen is that wonderful okay all right so now so friends after all these years we have finally arrived at the position and time we were born full brother Nathanael a buddy this morning even the manifestation of sons of god and daughters of God and Ephesians 1:5 have one 5 having predestinated on this unto us unto the adoption of children in Malachi 4 todos and adoption messages in May 1960 adoption part 3 page 89 there was a dispensation of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost Laodicea to come through there now is the dispensation of adoption what the world's waiting for what the world's groaning for what the world needs what the world needs is some manifested sons of God Hey well they're gonna pull me out of this pulpit here amen brother Ben so praise God it's okay and try to kind of you know I'll be in and out here cuz I don't have no strength so I can't you know get over there and stand on the edge of being gone no but maybe when I'm healed amen so praise God Saul Caine may be seated May 7 1946 Malachi 4 the angel visited him and he went out as a sent one into the harvest he was to have three poles he went out in a place of trying that's what he was in and he brought on the adoption season himself so I don't understand why the ministers don't preach it can't figure it out at all I mean the God has a provided way prophecy and now we're moving right on into another great age coming on for the rapture of the church it's 1954 prophecy but just the same God's moving right on bringing in the ranch and faith for his church that's right now watch what he said here so tonight I represent that faith the faith [Applause] that was delivered to the Saints in the way of a divine gift so you understand that now so when he went out for two pulls may be seated he went out for two pools and then God gave him divine gift to represent that faith and brother Brown said that Peter and the Apostles they had the same thing the same giving but then the Prophet was to go on further he was to come to a third Pole where he was open up all the mysteries in the Bible and that would bring us back to the faith and that was the third pull the opening of the word amen so he restored back to faith by the seven seals seven Thunder message which revealed the original Word the Apostolic Faith that was in the Alpha Church amen and so therefore on obey the voice of God may be seated and so therefore friends as your brother that's all I am what God's gift is the Spirit of God that came down in the form of an angel amen so the angel comes down in the form the Holy Spirit rather comes down the form of an angel and that is the divine gift so you mean that there'll be ministers come forth and the Holy Spirit will come down to them in the form of an angel ministering spirits firebrand amen you may be seated therefore angelic beings is ordained ministers of God to come to the earth to bear record of God and they work through mortal beings some of them are heavenly messengers did the supernatural angels themselves and some of them are earthly messengers such as the prophets in the Old Testament apostles and all of them and Malachi for a man that God dwells in to bring his earthly message and now you can begin to see who will be dwelling in the manifested sons of God [Applause] it'll be gifts in the form of angel a man adoption time manifested sons time God's waiting on you and me a man he waiting on the church amen an adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that's what he's waiting for until Christ becomes visible among us and raises the dead can you imagine Christ's coming into England they're taking you people brother Shephard Prince you become a prince with God God there will be discipline you praise God walking around London walking around Germany hallelujah walking around tick amen Hey pray walking around America Canada down in the islands visible tangible substance [Applause] hallelujah Amen Lord let it be do you see your our church st. John 1578 is made flesh in you you may be seated we are here Church the hour has come for place in Christ adoption time I told you this morning about the three phases brotherly love first phase Holy

Puerto Rico no rain for a long time do you need some rain Victor praise God speak to the rain hallelujah for your crops speak and whatever you say what you say st. mark 11:23 through 26 praise not [Applause] amen hallelujah praise God so you may be seated so now we on the third faith - getting ready to go into place of trying amen Malachi 4 went through this first and second poll and on adoption time page 57 he said this here the church is supposed to be predestinated unto the adoption of children where God can take a man and adopt him into the family and give him something now here it is he's ready to give you something right but he said he drops back first try that and see if it's right ha oh yeah he did it to you license he flung the robe on Elijah Elisha grabbing snatched it back try Elisha to see if he go all the way to see if he'll stay with Elisha to see if he will see him go up um going up in the first resurrection glory to God he lashes stay with him all the way then he could have it and when he seen that he did it he crossed over praise God that Jordan and then he dropped the rope down so first try you amen see if you can take it see if you can handle the power god amen see if it's right the Bible say try the spirits this man claims a certain thing you may be seated try and see if this right if it's right move right with it man got a revelation God's blessing it will move with his prayers garland they say Lord then say large tent or something else keep moving just keep moving safe every fella takes his place and then you want to see the Church of God begin to get to his place that's when the fiddles times will go to backing up the shorts will go all that here will grow down faces will be washed slips and dresses will be missing cigars what they miss it kind of sip that would in here praise God hey hallelujah glory slipping right in there mmm praise God yes sir they could be baby seated you'll see that a holy church stands together in power here it is at brother NASA this morning positionally placed as sons of God adopted into the family of God powerful church standing in this glory oh that's what he's coming for hallelujah page 89 is that right weaning God trying to place his church and position put him in a position on the way on the third phase third pull now you're in position hallelujah put him in positions to manifest himself amen all right getting one that he can work through like this is said there's my spirit flowing freely just my spirit over there and Belgium flowing freely in Holland flowing freely I have some sons their praise God they've stayed with it it came all the way down through the years and they hit that third phase that I come right down praise God amen hallelujah is the word opening up to you tonight hallelujah there's my spirit flowing freely there it is I can work here get another one over there and place him I could play some adoption placing manifesting take him out here put a ceremony on him visiting with an angel tell him something now if he's told the truth if you're not making up something it won't work no no that won't work we had a lot of that you see but I mean manifestation of sons of God when God manifests himself and he sends them out and then he goes forth and what he says is true what does he do or what he does is the truth what is he what he does the man of he manifests Christ how do you judge him by the way it combs it here no a meant for his God by the way stayed with the word amen that's all this if you stay with the word you you got no more the same amen if they speak not according to this word there's no life in them says the Bible well praise God feel like you're ready on the third phase amen okay now may be seated this ministry can only come to pass by Saint John 15:7 if he abide in me and my words upon you you shall ask what you will and shall be done unto you if the word abides in you amen then you an anointed person with the word so the word is already anointed malecon for knowing every Bible promise he had nine all these things that we speak about that's already anointed he anointed the resurrection he had known at the rapture the wedding supper hallelujah the Millennium it's already vindicated promises and anointed Amen we we could not have you may be seated we could not have these promises back in Laodicean age and Pentecost because it was not anointed for us but a prophet came along and revealed these mysteries amen and now it's anointed his mine is mine mine mine mine Jesus is mine who is Jesus the word the promises praise God hallelujah then you have authority hallelujah you're biting me my word and you then you shall ask what you will it'll be done for you amen now what it is may be seated that's Christ in you anointing the word for this age see and God divided his word into different ages now what is it Christ coming to his body and Christ is the word and the word is already in you so when the the Holy Spirit drops down that would be Christ the the anointing spirit amen he came to you in the form of mechanics the same Christ that goes into spirit and comes back to you in the form of dynamics you got it now then Christ come into his body Christ is the word we all know the knowing is Christ that comes on the word that makes the word live we have the promises in us we want to do the sand soul well he's got to come to make all that live amen is that right that is that that is the anointing Christ is the anointing the Spirit that comes upon the word that quickens the word it makes it live now the church has got to get to the Ministry of Jesus Christ until the church in Christ become one he can anoint you for every blessing that's in the Bible you buy them heed my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and that's when the pillow find Jesus Christ can slip down praise God and begin to dwell and some sons for the last days Jesus said that that day you shall know Saint John 14:23 is God that day you shall know I'm a my father my father meaning you and me and I on you what day is that this day when the seven seals seven thunders will Amen little brother praise God hallelujah just a little guy down here praise God amen that's when you know praise God the seals all the mysteries has been opened and that's this day praise God when the sons of God are to be made manifest oh Jesus may be seated Jesus veiled himself in the shout in Malachi 4:2 why to identify the shout I believed it was warning then judgment 1963 well ransom we way up here with the seven seals has been identified I believed in this paraphrase in it there's nothing left with them seven last mysteries right on the coming of the Lord and then uh in November I believe it was I wish I would do it Jesus calling to Christ page 43 he said this the book is open he says just waiting for the seventh seal to know to be identified to the coming of the Lord then around about June 14th 1964 to come to the unveiling of God was the seventh seal identified to the coming of the Lord you answer it hallelujah now remembered maybe see that Jesus does all three the shalt divorce the temple of God in this adoption time Jesus will veil himself in the bride as the voice of the Archangel to identify the voice of the Archangel in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 it must be identified by somebody and that somebody is the bride of Jesus Christ God's gonna soap fail himself into us praise God it won't be us no more Christ will become visible move and walk and praise God hallelujah Oh will this be denoted word Christ in the bride there by connecting the seven thunders to the coming of the Lord it's already connected they are ready as a shower so whether you believe it doesn't make any difference because brother Graham already connected it to the shower so it would be Christ finishing up the seventh seal doing the final work of redemption by the Holy Spirit itself even a dynamic to your mechanics he's been doing the work of redemption in you amen during this silence period Amen about thirty-eight years now whatever it is there the silence a man nobody know what's going on praise God Christ the word in the form of the word Amen son of man coming to you hallelujah doing the Ministry of the word glory to God God be praised hey hallelujah praise not now the hours come for the Ministry of the Spirit praise God hallelujah yes praise God the Holy Spirit Himself even a dynamics to your mechanics Jesus says be one as I am the father one and how will it be the word in us would be the anointed word that is the one is that God see the wonders of God is the word anointed in you see and then you become a messiah of the age [Applause] hallelujah will you say this is old give me a church that's so completely so anointed with God to live a reaction hallelujah and the move is thus saith the Lord walking at Shekinah glory and I'll show you a messiah knowing it standing on earth this is your promise in the adoption age Malachi 4 said soul yes my promise I'm gonna take it hallelujah what would it be it be reflection amen we at the end time this is a this adoption day now the Holy Spirit by the restoration is very person being in here amen forming signs and wonders like it did at the beginning what will the very person in the brine manifests the manifestation the sons of God oh very person a man the instant church what our desist is the bride age adoption time see times hoping word prize this is a distillation of adoption amen this is the day of the manifestation the sons of God when the mistress has been hit since the foundation of the world has been to be made known by the manifested sons of God hallelujah why Amen according to Malachi 4 the faith has been restored back you believe that Accord the st. Luke's 1730 the Messiah has been introduced do you believe that corner revelation 10 1 through 7 all of the hidden mysteries in the Bible including the seven thunders has been revealed do you believe that you really do well praise God a shout as in the camp who shout Malachi 4 a shout is in the camp some people don't know that they got interpretations but you got the Living Word of God just been spoken by a prophet into you praise God no devil can stop you nobody can stop you praise God you were born for this state is him impossible impossible impossible for anything else to happen other than the Word of God living in you praise God as a manifested son of God oh I wish it wasn't sick I praise God I wish I was strong enough to breathe hallelu all alone my hallelujah okay you may be seated everybody feeling fine alright I'm gonna share something with you okay maybe seated yes sir the Holy Spirit open my mind understanding one as to what and how the manifested sons would come forth in the last days always wanted to what would it be you know and the to Malachi for reveal all the mysteries and he left a void or a gap that's been here for 38 years and and they all try to step in there but didn't have no authority to do it and there was some sons and daughters of God coming on coming on take it outward praise God they can't miss it praise God coming on they're coming on they're coming on and when they hit that third face hey Dori praise God God be praised amen may be seated the bride has been confused by the many interpretations may be seated one concerning what is to take place - who is the conform in this adoption season in this void or again example three question says thoughts one will Malachi 4 have a return ministry 2 is there to be a white horse rider come forward 3 is there to be a tent for Malachi 4:2 preach the seven thunders those are all questions I'm a date on my questions but just the questions in the message but not mine I know who this hallelujah praise God so however may be seated last March of 19 2002 just you know meditating on adoption and back and forth it exploded in my heart as a Holy Spirit spoke to me and said the following the manifestations be dropped in my heart of sons of God will step into this void or gamete you got me now there's a void or a gap since the prophet left and nobody can go in there they've tried for 38 years but he told me that last March 19th the manifested sons of God they will step in there [Applause] amen yes sir and what are they gonna do they will bring up the mysteries left by Malachi 4 5 & 6 the manifest his sons will reveal listen what I'm saying now we reveal the mysteries left by Malik on 4 wits are already revealed and God's got to come along and reveal it to each member but it's already revealed prophet Lee revealer amen so ephesians 4 11 through 13 is this ministry amen the manifested son shall speak by prophecy in revelation the testimony of jesus the spirit of prophecy and they will rightly divide the word of god amen to the brian according to ephesians 4 11 through 16 they will reveal the secret things and place them in the word hallelujah this manifested Suns ministry was left on purpose for all of these past 38 years because they had to wait just waiting for the dynamics to manifest the fivefold ministry a man so high in the world could the five four minutes to do anything unless price had to leave revelation ten come over because this is supposed to be the ministry Jesus Christ what you going through 38 years if you don't have that ministry you can only preach the word amen amen maryska he will call them forth and they will go after the lost sheep getting on the revelation 22:17 and revelations the spirit capital s that's the D Dynamis that's the voice of the Archangel that's the spirit there amen praise God and hidden under there is your family hid under there the thirsty people in the message and they all under there waiting waiting for somebody to

the Spirit to quicken the word to the bride very simple as a brother amen first God this fire for the fire for manifested sons ministry must come through is worthy ministers number one if you must absolutely born again by the baptism of the Holy Spirit nothing intellectual at all to you must go into a place of trying where you add the life of 2nd Peter 1 4 through 7 Galatians 5:22 2:23 and then you will speak the truth in love hallelujah finally you know who it is could it be Christ 3 then charity coming down after they are seized and out the to set the fire for mercy into the kingdom of God
