world order and it's united nations army not no more the u.s army is a coalition are you reading the weather i come as a thief between you know the river euphrates dries up to prepare the way of the kings of the east and you're sitting in that you're right in it hey my my my brother well maybe uh i'll read a few quotes and coast amen on some harvest quotes amen i don't feel anything here yet amen and here's a message from uh chicago uh 1953 it's a prophecy uh brother bran why i am a holy roller glory let me read that one again why i am a holy roller the prophet said he was a holy roller in 1953 amen that's a good one now watch king and abel now let's move it on out you could move it down through the bible everywhere them two vines that started back here in eden they're growing right on on they're growing right on up right on up and finally watch we're almost in the sea time the harvest i don't think you've understood what i've been saying last summer the seed time seed time that's harvest time that's the season when you don't know what's going on unconsciously down through the air you're going on and you're just going on but suddenly it comes up suddenly you see what you are that's called harvest that's called seed time because you can't change so you can't change oh hallelujah amen yes sir you see uh they asked a question uh to the president and it said the other day and it's on video something quite a few heard it and it's on videotape and so forth but brother paul griffin has it he happened to tape it he didn't get him yet so i was going to read it but anyway it's there and they said well now what's going to happen after we defeat iraqi or where's this effect and uh what's going to be the condition of that country and what will what what we do with the saddam hussein and so forth etc etc so the president said oh no that will be under the new world order he said i'll take care of that and then today's news day in business a week or whatever they call it a business section therefore they said the you know these cds they call them these are short-term notes and so forth you make a profit on it they said well now the uh uh the cd note says just in time they have an international cds and it's just in time for the new world order you can invest in the world companies because it's one in one world anyway it's only one world is that no more united states [Applause] you sit looking at me huh and the holy spirit said you better read the seven seals or hear it or something praise god amen the message did you get that you mean the war could have possibly been brought on like world war like all the other wars back in europe and you know the rothschilds and illuminati all that stuff and cfr and you know trilateral and all that huh and all those wars was triggered by the rich guys like the prophet told you and they start all the wars and each one they thought they would bring in the new world order and how rosa luxemburg was killed in the socialists in germany on january 15th and then martin luther king happened to be born on that day 10 years later he and they do it and his wife wanna know well why would he pick that day for january 15 to start a war no that was in honor of rosa luxemburg nothing to do with martin luther king oh praise god they picked that day on purpose to honor the socialists coming in i mean it's here and you're looking at me that's what i could understand this morning oh you better wake up you better run for your lives praise god don't look at me no more praise god and people going out here having cottage meetings and all all out of order my god praise god god be praised well hallelujah new world order oh yeah well they got to pick a certain uh uh you know a certain guy so what better one to pick than the one who's anointed with nebuchadnezzar's spirit all right what better one to pick where the the river euphrates ran down to the garden to meet around that time you know what better place huh the garden of eden and uh where they built the ark praise god and floated up into mount aryan praise god wake up praise god where they built the towel babel where god's enemies was always in iran and iraq where daniel had to wait for the the son of god himself to come he was detained by the prince of persia iran praise god ayatollah foreign don't you understand what's going on these are devils praise god used by satan those two places there especially come on you may be seated you wake up oh hallelujah praise god it's a uh isaac's older brother ishmael they never he's wild wild man praise god don't you understand that he's wild in his nature they could hate one another but don't let israel come in there then they forget about that and they go against israel oh hallelujah well well i know about the same spirit because in the message all the church spirits hate one another but soon as somebody come preaching these thunders they all gang together and bless them praise god oh ishmael isaac in the message they could say anything to one another and hate them and and be friends with them and it and overlook what each other's doing but let somebody talk about some thunders and brother kindness and forgiveness they all come together and hate that thing praise god glory to god amen i don't know which way to go here because uh what's that saying amen brother garcia they don't know that's what that's the place so that's where god's enemy is that's iraq is the land of assyrians iraq is the land of babylonians iraq is the land of chaldeans always coming against israel don't you remember when jonah went down the uh uh the uh uh down to nineveh well he went down to euphrates river where you think he went amen praise god don't remember episode and the jews was taken away back

get the holy ghost oh praise god he may be seated is brother coming right is he wrong amen well you wait and find out amen hallelujah you'll find that brother cohen proceeds from the message that's why i'm a holy roller maybe see the strange message today i don't know praise god amen well where we had second handed robe justinville 1956 and now during the reign of elijah of the pilgrimage of elijah here on earth which was a god prophet for the hour and god has never left himself on earth without a witness god has always somewhere someplace had a person that he could put his hands on and would stand for witness so if he did that down since genesis the the beginning surely somewhere god has a man that he can lay his hand or collate his hand now now watch uh for he's more now for he he's more than one man now there it is amen it says he may talk about himself he said no he's more than one man now he has many men that he can lay his hand on because we're coming down to the down to the gathering these six thousand years the gathering time put these glasses on here coming down to the gathering time gathering together a place called armageddon never been a war like this before such fire power from the air and there you see they see it on television people going out to the movies to get away from the water getting groggy that's the idea of it to get your brain your mind nothing but war and then here come the terrorists and here come they don't care they blow themselves up over manila the bomb went on before they even got it in there they don't care because they go into paradise but you don't have that faith you don't have it you worry you have mind battles this one didn't shake my hand and this one did that to me i'm gonna speak to her no more that's that's you but that that's not the arabs praise god allah they go into paradise they will come back they will die for it or will you die spiritually for it praise god except the corner we fall on the ground and die oh you ain't going nowhere you maybe see the praise of god americans in this message forget it praise god these people walk on hot coals and everything else praise god and you touched somebody the wrong way here brother ready to knock you out yes sir one of these americans in the message oh hallelujah i didn't already appreciate it brother gloria this this skins is sentient amen praise god not me but the word is showing you up amen see these six thousand years has been the maturing of the harvest and now let me see the harvest time here it is the gathering uh so much has happened i can't like put it together here the holy spirit got to do it for me the gathering time i want to go here i want to go off over there on one word i'm ready to go over there because it's here i can say anything by the holy spirit amen but you ain't ready to receive it yet some of you don't even have a new spirit yet oh hallelujah so he said drop back and preach the next six months or so until they get a new spirit get the holy spirit so god's giving you this time i hope you don't let it go further away i hope you're on your face praying and crying out to god for the holy ghost he dropped back for you i can't go no further on the third phase because you're sitting here like this morning you don't know what's going on amen it's happening right in front of you i mean prophecy going on in the new world order the man speaking around your face now you know what it is it's seed time revelation 13 8 from there on the whole thing the image time do you understand let's make an image like unto the beast will you end it now because when the war is over you'll be in the new world order which is socialism one bank and the whole thing praise god whoa amen the gathering time the harvest time genesis was the planting of the seed and these six thousand years has been the maturing of the harvest now what did god do he sent elijah to the preacher the message now to gather up all the seeds from jesus all the way through down to revelation the prophet and recycle them back and sow that seed from jesus through revelation to pull out a bread so she don't take the punishment oh hallelujah praise god and you said look at me hallelujah praise god pull up brian out a pull because you can't get out the world's got you in his clutches so i gotta pull you you young people the world has you the women in the whole thing you know that say amen somebody i'm telling the truth i'm speaking to god's honest truth these young people you know what you feel in your flesh and what you see with your eyeballs that's from the devil and you cannot get out brother brother nathaniel goyko escaped because god pulled him out there'd be a few more i hope hallelujah just god's grace oh it may be seated [Applause] so malachi 4 brought it from genesis to revelation to a seed a seed and painted that seed to take a brine out [Music] and then some men come behind well i'll get to it amen hallelujah now i praise god i'm planting them seeds there then water them sit back now waiting for the thing to come up he said before you do that but drop back i got some more seeds in there and they don't know what they're sleeping but the seven sons will wake him up still sleeping this morning looking at me all dumbfolded dumbfounded maybe seated six thousand years has been the maturing of the harvest and now now the seed here has become a seed itself this seed has become a seed itself in you [Applause] and now all needed some water the latter rain this is in you hope so amen brother ain't no more time anything else right i think they got that one huh this the seed has become a seed itself it went back to to the blossom and from the blossom to the fruit and it's gathering time now harvest time all the great things have started the true church has started and jesus has come down to the fruit time the fruits of the spirit and the antichrist is starting to jesus has come down to its fruit headed high mind and mean everything else second timothy three there's the fruit praise no forgive and grudging hallelujah yes sir come on give me some amens there i want a sounding board praise god i want

true church of starting genesis has come down to the fruit time the fruits of the spirit antichrist is starting jesus come down to its fruit and we're just in the closing time of this world's entire dispensation of of of the mortal being yeah it's the greatest time that anyone or at any age ever live is this time it's a shaken time it's a troublesome time for sinners but it's a marvelous time for christians that's why i don't understand why you sit like that this is a marvelous time a glorious time it's it's a bright time you're going home how can you sit quiet why aren't you shouting and singing in the holy roller praise god may be seated cheaper see intellectuals sit and listen maybe i said something huh intellectual they don't worship they listen but they're trying to get it up there before they say amen before they shout because they don't know what the word is they don't read the bible they don't pray and do nothing praise god they don't know they come here hear a sermon if it sounds right through the reasoning then they say oh amen amen but a seed has it in there it strikes it praise god you may be seated as a marvelous time for the christmas because we know that we are packing up [Music] we're packing our bags hallelujah we're packing up cedars are gathering the last little efforts together to go home and i'm in here sick and weary my last effort five or six months to pull you out because i know it's hard as time the middle east is right there oh church why do we sit like this how can you sit like this break yourselves down bust open or do something don't just sit and sit and sit oh hallelujah i'm this is my infant i'm sick i'm tired i'm wary i'm exhausted maybe maybe seated praise god but it's my effort i'm packing up i'm going home i'm going we're going home to meet the lord glory oh hallelujah maybe see the now the people today as you look around see the great trouble and distress facing the nation look around you see what's going on amen oh praise god why little bethlehem 1958 so we find that she began to long to go back because they heard that a great revival had broke out if you notice naomi returned in barley season remember naomi ruth that was barley season you got it in your minds now you know ruth designing luther huh ruth working away sanctification getting all the things out the tv and everything else ruth working then ruth resting at boaz feet baptized with the holy ghost waiting to be rewarded with the rich seven seals of redemption haven't you heard these things huh maybe it's heated but when did it happen in barley season oh barley season the bible said just at the time of the harvest in other words when there was a great revival going on spiritually applying it she returned just in that season nothing left she had nothing and this is barley season oh hallelujah praise god christianity versus idolatry amen and we realize that we are not without 1961 the presence of the enemy see we realize that even though i'm in this little six seven month period here if the lord the lord teres i realize i'm not without the presence of the enemy because he's always near to hinder and to stop and to do anything that he can see yes he's standing here this morning hey man talk to people amen walk into a dungeon or something i know what it was this morning so that's that's the enemy because he knows all world shaky events are going on he want to numb you numb down praise god but god got some men that he could put his hands on some witnesses he can bust that numbness praise god you're paralyzed hallelujah amen maybe city but oh lord give thy children faith this morning and this is actually coming alive you better be praying this this morning power to rise above the enemy that's in your mind to open their hearts and make their soul a field of fertile ground oh well that word of life may be sold and bring forth great joy and a wide harvest oh my last little effort i'm finished brother my god yes sir perseverance thank you brother neville 1962. lord bless you thank you morning friends it's a privilege to be here this morning in the presence of the lord and the tabernacle of the people and it's a a a rainy day outside i just drove up just now and the way you were singing and clapping hands they must have showers or blessings on the inside well how about this morning i don't know see but that's where it was there so that's very good so we are very thankful for this day see uh uh we got to have the rain if we don't have the rain then the master cannot gather his fruits [Applause] see so we have a rain inside spiritual or there won't be any fruits for the harvest we have to have a rain on the outside or we won't have a natural office and we got to have the rain on the inside i won't have a spiritual harvest oh hallelujah glory second kings 1929 and in the third year soviet reap and planned venues and eat the fruits there are hallelujah questions there's a fruit fixing to come forth in the bright time and ripen green number two then the harvest has come if the fruit is fixing to come forth then the harvest is here because it's fruit it's in the top of the tree mature green number four i'm talking about now the word amen the message the germ hallelujah glory then the harvesters come and my my message is but when the fruit is brought forth the harvest is come so i'm prophesying [Music] amen malachi 4 has sold every seed in the bible from genesis to revelation can you say amen [Applause] amen did you receive the new book seven church changes and uh uh the invasion of the usa amen praise god everything right on time seven church ages page three so you know what i'm talking about paragraph 17 and preaching now you can jot it down there are some people that are preachers they can pick up the word with inspiration amen see and sway it out there in places that's that's watering the seeds that the teacher has taught so you know like a seven thunder inspiration brother ralph will fall upon here and there not everybody in the message just here and there and then they can preach it out there and sway them in those places you know 700 revival prayers swam praise god see but they are wait he said here now these men are not bringing anything new now no honestly the teacher already taught it's in books and forms is everywhere that's why these men say uh get the seven church changes get the servants here so you know what i'm talking about i'll take the tapes of the prophet see because these men know that unless you have these seeds well they can fall a water on top of you you get a blessing in here and you go outside your blank and money you're dead again amen praise god see these men know that now they can pick up the word with inspiration and sway it out then places that's watering the seeds that the teacher has taught now you got to put some seed in first and then water it hallelujah and the watering comes from the preaching of the word let us go and preach the word amen so now if the prophet ordained me to do what to preach the word to water the seeds anybody around but they get mad at me amen i'm ordained to do this here now don't get mad at me i'm only watering the seeds well you don't believe me open bible one corinthians three amen and uh paul said here's a three and i brethren cannot speak unto you as something spiritual but that's unto carnal fleshly fleshy even as unto babes and crimes i have fed you with milk and not with me for hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet now or you're able for you're not for ye yet carnal for whereas there's among your indian strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men for while one said i'm a paul i'm a apollos are you not carnal see who then is paul who is apollos see but ministers by whom he believed even as the lord gave to every man i have planted paul said apollo is wanted but god gave the increase malachi 4 planted we watered but god will give the increase god will bring forth the fruit so don't look at me brother coleman's no brother copeland didn't say that he said what the what the prophet said say brother branham said here brother brown said they don't say brother cohen said i'm saying what he said but see babes want to grab a man with skin on because the other man's going to heaven they don't see him they see you there so they say brother coleman said they even say sister coleman said or somebody that they can see that's official from headquarters or something the headquarters is in heaven brother lord you got the wrong headquarters amen you better start saying malachi 4 said god said you better start saying it today then you got a seed you got a revelation but you keep saying brother coleman said here and brother coleman said well you ain't got no revelation you're saying what he said amen now is it getting in i'm trying to help you i know for no glory i already have my glory wave back before the foundation or where were we using something the guy trying to enjoy the morning started staying together i was in my glory i don't need your praises of man i don't need your money i don't need you uh say oh you're you're great brother cooper i don't need that from you buddy praise god i was already adopted praise god before the foundation of the world hallelujah glory to god you may be seated amen see i don't need that i need to praise a man praise god i'm here to preach the word a lot of people get mad at me and look at me sometimes where to bust them in i stand over there i said yeah that's i said it yeah and then they go on now and see what their heads down they're going downstairs say how can they go down says mumbling almost tip over the stairs say how can he say those things see i can feel all that come floating up the stairs just like walking on the steps see man little spirits come floating back up again amen praise god the feet of the shoes on amen spirits with shoes on praise god hallelujah praise god i have planted in apollo's water but god give the increase so then neither is he that plant anything neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase now he the planet and he that wareth are one i'm one with malachi 4 praise god brother branham i preach what you preach ascent brother and said our preacher paul preached hallelujah praise god don't you understand come on be spiritual be carnal they be seated now he did plan that he that war of the one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor thank god you get your own thing called what you do amen so all these 17 years has not been for north i'm getting ready to get my fruit uh inside this way in that way curse and revile brother brother around i'm getting my fruit hallelujah you gonna put that germ in there and camp them seven virtues and out will go the water [Applause] oh hallelujah amen every man shall receive his own reward according his own labor amen the holy spirit laid the malachi 4 seeds in my heart to sow by inspiration in spite everything going on i don't regard the clowns and what's going what they're saying uh who you think he is he's mean i don't regard those clowns to sow a seed [Applause] praise amen glory i had my baptism fine pentecost praise god amen hallelujah amen amen what am i saying amen that's right glory the holy spirit laid the seeds the man like four in my heart that's right the soul by inspiration despite everything going on all kinds of opposition unbelief sickness weariness and afflictions and but something that's keeping me at this last little effort though exhausted i must press on and not give up see because in ecclesiastics 11 4 he then observeth the wind shall not sow every wind all all kind of accusations and cursings every violence but you won't sow nothing the seven seals not open and god tells you shows you the seventh seal is open now if you listen to the winds of the ministry it's not open not open not open but the holy spirit said it is open then what has happened then you sowed that seed back and you watered it praise god and you swayed it out to your hand then there there until it's around the world down to new zealand put your shoulders back brother coleman put your chest up praise god lift your head up high the thunders all over here in new zealand and i'll stay everywhere else never mind no sitting in front of you praise god but it's here hallelujah oh you may be seated here observing the wind shall not sow and he had regarded the clouds now wait a minute he regarded the clown shall not

had sown the seed in the woman and had already wages of gratification of saving her soul see he had sown and reaped fruit until life eternal the same day but the woman at the well and she got all excited and she ran into the town meanwhile she ran into town to tell the samaritans and they got all excited about this man of god that told her who she was and how many husbands she had meanwhile while they were on their way to the word the disciples around the world didn't catch it [Applause] so let's pick them up uh then let's pick up these men what the woman said verse 29 a little backdrop come see a man which told me all things that i ever did it's not this the christ then they went out of the city and came unto him now they're on the way i mean picture the whole town coming out to christ all the men amen here verse 31 in the meanwhile his disciples prayed him saying master eat from the hell that they look to the natural master eve but he said unto them i have meat to eat that you know not have therefore said the disciples once another hath any man brought him or to eat see the minds in the natural they're not looking at the spiritual the revelation army getting and what's going on to the world new order they look at nothing they're sitting here this morning to come to church pay the tithes natural amen i know it the holy spirit's picking the spirits up here and next

both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together and hearing is that saying true one soul with another reaper i sent you to reap that where on you bestowed no labor other men labored and ye are entered into their labors amen and many of the marriages that that city believed on him watch for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all he ever did then when he spoke to them they said now we believe because you said it they heard the testament of the woman here but when that word spoke to them praise god it now we believe because the word said it praise god well
