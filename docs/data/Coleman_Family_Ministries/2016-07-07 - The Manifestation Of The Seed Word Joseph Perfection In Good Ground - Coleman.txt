TRANSCRIPT
========================================
be the name of the Lord [Music] what can we say oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord my did you enjoy that singing Sister Lisa and the Restorations all the glory of Jesus I'm quite sure everybody wants to see the glory of Jesus here I know that's what uh I feel like Moses I beseech thee show me thy glory amen cuz Moses told the Lord he was not going to go up the second time unless the glory went with him and I believe we feel the same way we cannot go any further praise God unless God's glory comes and takes us praise God so we certainly thank God for that and what can I say about Brother Ray burfield what a a a testimony back to me and encouragement the Lord knows when to encourage you at the right time all these years and I and it comes at this time so there's so many things to say but I'll talk to the brother myself but I certainly thank God for him and the ones that are standing down there and it makes me feel good I was never there but that's brother Brown's message got nothing to do with me at all and I keep telling them and thank God for the people in New Zealand they know it you see how humbl the brother was he said these are brother brandom's quotes from Harvest Time and whatever see does people like get around the world and the Holy Spirit sent this tape here that you might know that there's others of likeminded Faith precious like Faith around the world they are seeds of God and so they don't they don't have no leader or somebody they got to follow amen and he showed you when they get off the word where they all wind up at so we thank God that we stay in that word and so may God richly bless if this tape you get to my brother Ray burfield his wife and family and the Believers down there God bless you what a testimony to me and encouragement amen and I feel like I can preach this morning's message then amen praise God so I thank the Lord for that and uh um I just wanted to say this while you're standing you were sitting down there for a while uh I wanted to say um you know the Hours come friends and this is uh this is a finish time here and I believe we all know it and um my inspiration is the time in this time of the Harvest see the the tals are gathered out in the time of the Harvest you see and we in that time now with the Gathering of the tears and the Shu going Dr dry and actually the Chuck is dry amen and everything is died down is dead and there's something going on this is seed time amen and negative and positive the seeds are taking life amen and and spirit and they become in flesh and you when you say it it's like say Paul spoke in the Bible a seed what would be befall Us in the last days then when that thing begins to happen that means that that that seed has taking life amen and the spirits got a hold of it whether it's negative like over Europe and what's happening there in in the Book of Revelation and Rome and all those things that's the seeds and they're taking life those are negative seeds of course but then what about the positive I mean brother Marcel a seed taking life sister Alexander a seed taking life do you see what it's not many but there are some and these seats down there or are you understand what I'm saying cuz if you otherwise you're dull you don't know amen oh praise God give us a key for I love him cuz there something is not there amen I don't know amen praise God it's just not there so may you just sing to the Lord and get your mind off a man and whatever you're going through get your mind on the holy spirit amen praise God I love him I love him because he first love me [Music] and P just my [Music] S [Music] [Applause] oh let's play it real soft friends it's my last message for a while God is looking for a bride love slaves to be prisoners to Jesus Christ the word to pull this Malachi for a message in the presence of this last generation and on Paul a prisoner I was going to speak on it the 17th but uh I never got to it I read this quote I want to read it again just kind of set the tone for the message cuz it just wasn't right there page 13 and let the love of God come in his presence praise God and ENT into the spirit Paul knew what it was on page 13 Paul prisoner he found out that he was harnessed to something like a horse in harness it is to pull something Hallelujah and Paul knew after this experience and 3 years and a half of typing this experience he had with the Bible he realized that God had chosen him that's the first thing did he choose you Hallelujah if he chose you then nothing else matters and then he chose and he harnessed him by the Holy Spirit am the experience that he had to pull the gospel in the presence of the Gentiles now watch the spirit itself self harnessed him now what is the message that I've been driving and trying to get to you the Holy Spirit itself is here then if he's here what is he going to do he's going to harness you those that go here and go there and they can't make it well he's here to make it for you amen today as Servants of Christ we be come harnessed hooked up we can't go without it being with us harnessed to the word no matter what anyone else says you're harnessed to it yes there's something about it that you just can't get away from it you've been yolked up with it by the Holy Ghost and it it yoked you to the word no matter what anyone else says it is the word that is following you see you're pulling the word and you're harnessed by the Holy Spirit and you're pulling this word and that's what I've been doing seven Thunders give faith I'm pulling it all the critics is standing on the side but we're pulling it Hallelujah adoption Perfection pulling it Malachi 4 pulling it regardless of how many critics of what they say we yolked oh Hallelujah you won't you won't worry about the world you won't worry about the things of the world if you ever get yolked the trouble is you haven't been yolked up with the word thank you Jesus his presence is here now Hallelujah you're being yolked up with the Holy Ghost right now and it yoke you to the word it is the word that is Fallen you harness up with put in the Yoke with it to the word by the spirit he was harnessed yes Glory now we must come back to the Bible times for this day the priest was harnessed too but you see they never they came over into another dispensation and they failed to strip off their old harness now I can say a lot of things here I preach a whole message here I could that old harness that you didn't take off that old nature and we can go on and on Old Doctrine or whatever it was amen you see but you see they never they came over to another dispensation and they failed to strip off the old harness and put on a new harness and the same thing we find today we did come through a denominational age as we prove through the church ages the Bible and so forth but we come now to a free age where the Holy Spirit himself comes down vindicates himself and makes himself known see what's going on here now and makes every promise that he promised come to pass oh Church praise God page 17 God is looking for prisoners he's always done it see I have to say these words before I preach this message it'll tie right back into Brother Ray bur's testimony cuz he had my message right on on that tape there and God sent it to me as a witness to go ahead and preach us here amen yes God is looking for prisoners he's always done it you might search it through the scripture a man has to be a prisoner to Christ against anything therefore you cannot be connected with anything but Christ amen watch even your father your mother your brother your sister your husband your wife anybody God is above your wife above your husband and when your husbands and wives understand that each one has got to take that word they are Yol each woman is is a prisoner unto the Lord and her Covenant husband might be all unspiritual and whatever but she's yolked she cannot deny her master praise God and the husband is yolked to the word of God that's the way it is friends that's why if both are Yol then there's no problem CU when one is Yol and one is not Yol then there's problem in the home but it both filled with the Holy Ghost oh praise God as brother burfield said those colors are flying everywhere praise God yes sir Glory Glory Glory to God Amen with anybody you're only connected with Christ and him only then God can use you don't even ask God to use you for nothing until you've been stripped of all your old harness and then yolked up with the message itself not your idea of it then you're ready to do something for God not before that's why you see them all running up and down these past 20 years they fail they they heaps along the roadside but brother bery said brother cman we are standing praise God why because he stayed connected with Christ and him only then God can use you until then you can't amen oh praise God hallelujah hallelujah page 24 he said um yes sir excuse me speaking about Joseph amen yes sir remember he was sold by his brothers to an Egyptian when he was in prison and they sold him to pipar and pipar gave him a little bit of Liberty and the first thing you know that was taken from him and there he sat in prison crying crying God had to strip him now notice this but all the time I believe in that prison he could remember that the vision said that he was going to sit on a throne and his brothers were going to bow to him because he knew that his gift came from God and he knew that it had to come to pass oh my oh how you could think back and by inspiration struck you and what God Said and you know even though you can be in some prison to somebody amen they put you in a prison but you're not in prison the message put you in prison for for what you preach but you yourself are not in prison I'm in nobody's prison even though they put me there but I'm free amen he whom the son of man set free is free I am not in prison to their ideas to their lives to what they feel to what they say that's what they say let every man's word be a lie praise God let God's word be true so I am free I'm a free man amen hallelujah praise God and he knew it had to come to pass and I know Joseph Perfection got to come to pass though it was spoken in 1964 amen it'll come to pass praise God if we can only keep that in our minds that according to the word of God in these last days he's going to have a church going to have a people and these things that he promised he's going to do them he said he would and we're living in the time with the word he's just trying to get us to be real prisoners now locked in with him so are we combing through here now to lock you in throughout this summer here for this great Revival that's going to sweep through here oh hallelujah praise God lord lock me in there Lord make me ready page 25 Pharaoh made Joseph his son uh his son Christ makes his pris of love his sons and he gives them power the same thing he St John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also even more than this shall he do amen now the prisoner of the love of Christ becomes empowered by his King who is Christ amen and verily I say unto you if you say into this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you say what you said will come come to pass you have what you said if you AB in me my word in you you yoke to me because him and his word is the same in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God made fresh and dwell Among Us the same yesterday today and forever if you abide in me not here abiding there and over there and here and there abide in me and my word in you you shall ask what you will or say what you will it'll be done he has Power Glory Glory to God GL GL this is exaltation to you now notice before he came out he had to be taken out and shaved a few things had to be shaved off before he can meet his king so I'm trying to tell you the Holy Ghost itself you got to die out a few things you have to do to meet him he's here the person of Christ and he wants to come in you but you got to do some shaving you got to do some stripping amen see uh oh God uh some sometimes takes his people out like that and shaves a few of their own Wills off he shows them that they can't do just what they wanted to do see you know what I mean they are not at Liberty to do what they want to do before they can come into full power and be a l slave to Christ not not following the word but a love slave to the word Hallelujah I mean you in the world and you laughing at us because we taking the word no I'm a love slave to Christ to the word I'm very happy I don't know about you praise God you have your parties and things and wake up with a big head amen pray a headache amen but not me brother I wake up shouting praise God glory before they come into full power and be a love Savi to Christ they have to be shaved off then presented sometimes he takes them to the deserts to do that to shave them off and then bring them out the anointed ones to fulfill the purpose that he's ordained them to be see what I mean brother we at the end time yes sir praise God now if now now then if you're following God and have submitted yourself to God then you become a prisoner to that God to that word to that will am no matter what anybody else says we become a prisoner to it listen we at the end time and I would say this with reverence and respect as the last couple of minutes is floating by look what God in my to my opinion will do must do and will do in his last days is to find a tool for the Harvest he's got to find a tool to thresh the floor any fer when he goes to his Harvest he has to have a tool to do it with certainly he's got to have a sharp sickle or something some instrument to thresh out the Grain and the Harvest is right God take us in your hands make us bonder Servants of Your Love use us for tools to bring to to the realization bring the realization to this sinful cursed Earth that we Liv in today that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever for myself God let me be a prisoner if all my brethren turn me down all my friends turn me down I want to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ to and his word that I might be harnessed to his word by the Holy Spirit to see the Holy Spirit make the word of God be confirmed by the things that he said would be done I want to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ let us pray how many want to be a prisoner of Christ and he speaks to the young people I wonder if some young boy here tonight this morning will look around and say I'm uh when I get big I'm going to be a certain thing I wonder if you could feel the will of God move in your life and say no no my ambitions are lost now the last few days the Holy Spirit has been speaking to me I want to yield myself to God to be a threshing instrument for this last day some young girl that might have Ambitions of her fine lady character maybe be a pretty little miss or maybe someday they make Hollywood your career I wonder if you're not willing to now to submit your am your Ambitions in the presence of God and his word and hear the call of God in your own life God knows who you are oh one more time I love him glory I love him because he first love me and her just my Sal oh yeah everyhead bow oh God as we been singing this song I love him I love you Lord and how we thank you for that testimony and greatly encourag me Lord and being a witness to the message you give me this morning and Lord how a brother told me to put my shoulders back and chest out and head up in the air I didn't fail and way down New Zealand near the International Date Line there's Believers just the last 2 years coming forth on their own Lord I often wondering how would it be would somebody have to go there and here the brother says that another group and notice he is not running over there to be the leader of it he's just letting it go by itself by the Holy Ghost that's what I like amen oh God may this be a new day Lord for many in here hallelujah those that are wrestling with themselves Lord may they take that old harness Lord and throw it down and may you drop a new harness down from heaven the baptism of the Holy Ghost father and harness them to that word for this season and pull them and then may they pull the gospel Lord oh hallelujah praise God go through here like fire lord strengthen my body now Lord bless the visitors in the gates Lord open their minds to what's going on and Lord bless these young people and make them tools for the Harvest and bless Leon and Unice as they get ready to go take them all the way in the airplane and where they have to go and give them a safe journey home Lord now now I pray you bless the musicians Lord and the singers and sister Lisa and how they sang that all the glory of Jesus May the glory of Jesus fill this place here now Lord bless the reading of the word and the hearing of it and confirm the word with outpouring of the Holy Ghost in Jesus name we pray and ask a blessing amen amen and amen okay quickly to the word uh Genesis 1 St Luke 8 St John 15 amen Genesis 1:1 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so and and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit who SE was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good in St Luke 8 one of The Parables where the brother Berfield was speaking about and I felt to take it from St Luke it's in in three different places and I felt it was a little shorter here the reading of the scriptures Amen on fourth verse and when much people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city he he spake by a terrible a soul went out to seow his seed and as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was triing down and the fouls the air devoured it and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it it withered away because it lacked moisture and some fell upon thorns and the Thorns sprang up up with it and choked it and others fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit 100 fold and when he had said these things he cried he he that hath an ear let him hear amen and his disciples asked him saying what might this Parable be and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in Parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they they might not understand and he hasn't changed I mean the same son of man amen came and took all the mysteries of the Old Testament and revealed them to his disciples and spoke to many in Parables so that they would hear it and see it and yet not believe it but he revealed the Mysteries to his disciples in the same son of man not another came back in Malachi 4 and took all the mysteries of the last seven Church ages praise God and gathered his disciples and spoke uh in Parables to many the seven sealers open the seven sealers close it's AAR but the se but the disciples know it's open and the others it say it's closed then they argue about it then they go away oh my see the Mysteries so he hasn't changed cuz it's a son of man praise God and 100f let him here and disciples answer him saying what might this Parable be and I I read that there now the parable is this the seed is the word word of God those by the way side are they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their mouth of their hearts L they should believe and be saved they on the Rock are they which when they hear receive a word with joy and these have no root and you seen many of them shouting here brother they here for a season and then they gone you see them in the meetings and and uh pen Harris and they did more Shou than anybody then we got criticized for their shouting and we don't even see them gone see and we was blamed for all that I don't even see half of those people but but you're here amen praise God cuz you shouting with a life amen amen praise God see but but yet I'm blam for all that though see those by the weights side amen they on the Rock are they which when they hear it receive the word with joy and they have no root and which for a while believe and the time of Temptation you following Brother Coman they gone Temptation they can't stand here and there you following Brother Coman Thunders gone see to me now I ain't following no man then they Pride themselves not following a man but the man is the word Jesus Christ but they have no Revelation and that which fell among the Thorns of they which when they have heard go forth and a choke with carides and riches and Pleasures this life and bring no fruit to Perfection but that on the good ground are they which in honest and good heart have heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience may God is a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated now you can sit down for a while you're tired now amen well praise God certainly happy amen so I won't be with you too long the man my title is the manifestation of the seed word Joseph perfection in good ground amen are you f what I'm saying now okay so you had a whole hour with a man speaking about these things here and now you know where I'm coming from amen a subject this is a parable here cuz it's in this in the Bible so he told me to put it just this way sew ye and reap plant Vineyards and eat the fruit thereof now you read the Bible and find it it's just like that that's a scripture Glory praise God my inspiration let every seed come forth after its own kind amen well friends has the hour come amen where the seed is gone back to seed amen and after passing through the three stages of the blade and the tooms and the shuck Luther Wesley and the Pentecostals and where are we at now praise God on the seege not the air with the sh check my time amen [Applause] glory amen page 16 yes sir well praise the Lord where am I at here 16 okay but now uh C should not be able to shut but Pentecost represented Mary Mary the last stage of it now she was not the seed yet the the the the the the life of the seed was in her but it had matured yet amen amen and then he goes on speaking about the word and so forth I'm trying to skip around Luther went to husk with his first word the just shall live by faith Wesley had two words sanctification second definite work of Grace Pentecost had the third word the restoration of the gifts but the entire seed has to come forth that's what I'm talking about amen see how they denominate one word and another word and another word and there's got to be something cannot be denominated it is the entirety of the life that's been in there has to reproduced itself again in a bride there cannot be any more Church agents after this we at the end brothers and sisters we're here we have arrived thanks be to God Amen now remember this was a prophecy in ' 65 and we're still here living off of this prophecy amen we we live off of until the shuck is completely dry all the time it was drying drying out dying out glory to God now page 20 amen these three women carriers see and uh which must die and dry up just like the Shu does and so forth to to give room for the seed other words the the the the Justified ones got to dry out too also got to dry up the sanctifying ones got to dry up also and these Pentecostal got to dry up completely dry these Shucks amen totally dry you see CU if they got any life in there then that seed which is supposed to be golden brown cannot be golden brown if there's one piece of life in some Justified or Sanctified church somewhere or in this message that seed cannot get right cuz it must have all of the life every seed maybe one down in Africa over in India has got to have it it's got to be in a real message amen not the message message but the real message amen glory to God thank you Jesus the SE can I get R can I get R rather until the the the stalk and the and the Shu and the leaves all dry that's right it saps every bit of the life in them out amen all of it was in there plus can I do it now is seed time or bride time amen the Shucks are dead the Shucks are dried up the Virgin word time not touch is a virgin remember the Virgin word time other words virgin word time is the prophet said seven funds give Faith that's virgin now if you don't touch that and explain it away it'll be virgin today and I'm

born word of God made manifest Jesus Christ is same yesterday today and forever hallelujah how wonderful I love it I believe it I know that it's the truth it'll not be touched there'll be no denomination of manhandling in the Virgin birth of the Bride no sir she's commanded by God to come out of such touch not their unclean Things become and become a vulture amen you imagine a bride with a revelation then here come some brother with some Revelation and then makes her a vulture praise God with his uh uh Doctrine amen page 24 but she has a revelation God promised rabbits in the days of Luther he promised other things in the days of others but now he's promised us a full Square meal amen now Jesus and brother brandom spoke this to those who had ears to hear and eyes to see and seeing they would not [Music] see right here in the book and they they heard it yet they didn't understand it see he was spoken a parable to them he promised us a full Square meal the full seven course meal They say six yet he's saying seven but it's not for them they have eyes to see and see not [Applause] amen the word is opening up to you the full seven course menu for all the Seven Seals are

and be judged according to what she's heard if you're here tonight and just a church member what's your judgment going to be when we all have to stand there and witness you heard the truth when I got to stand and tell you to your face that you heard the truth come forward Joseph keman did this person and that person to hear you preach this here they sure did Lord I said them the tape or they got a hold of themselves and so forth and they heard it but in hearing they hear not in seeing they see not praise God oh this is serious times yes sir friends my God page 26 and now he's moved right on out in uh moved right on out of the Pentecostals he's left them into the seed because it has to be the seed you can't beat nature there's no nothing else for there is to happen but the seed so the seed will produce itself he's the same yesterday today and forever the same Pillar of Fire showing the same signs same power same God same Miracle same things Vindicated the word in the Bible just exactly

shook because to the shu is no more there's nothing left by then but just the grain is that right got to be the grain it's got to be the same kind of wi in the ground Jesus Christ is say yesterday today and forever a Spirit come upon the bride to do the same things that he did see is the reproducing of the grain Glory you mean the Holy Ghost itself is ready to come upon a seed word in this church [Music] huh then it will reproduce another grain like it was in an early bride be the same life same signs same wonders same everything oh strive for that brother yes let everything else go so now here we go you may be seated so after passing through the three stages of Blade toss and Shu Luther West in the Pentecostals and now it's in the seed word amen which is Joseph Perfection now the Pentecostals released the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and now the seed word Joseph Perfection at the top of the foundation is ready to release the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection

the life and the spirit will strike it and the clothes will go out that gown will be formed around you oh how praise God Amen so many says if the Lord will take this this evil spirit from me see that's what they're waiting for me to do in here now see about 3,000 waiting for me to take away 3,000 evil spirits amen so they can be sealed see I said no not going to happen sister Alexander and brother Marcel and sister Esther they did it themselves so you might as well start now praise God if the Lord will take where this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing I'll serve him but that's up to you you got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things and they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down yes sir she has made herself ready I like that word you see God could not push us through a little pipe and pull us out on the other on the other end and then say blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to do to overcome he just push you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself I've got to make decision for myself and doing that we show our faith and respects to God then you won't see so many coming to the elders because they coming to the elders for a [Applause] decision but if you pray through Lord should I do this should I do that then you won't be standing in front of me nail no more you've got to do it yourself without the Holy Ghost and with the Holy Ghost you got to do it because Abraham did it without the Holy Ghost so you have got to stop being a baby

stay right there but be barely put your shoulders back put your chest out throw your head up praise God come on get out of there amen stop being babies make your decision if you're wrong you're wrong but you made a decision make a decision for Christ today I'm going to stop being cranky and mean and nasty I'm going to stop it praise I'm going to love my wife and my children I'm going to do it I'm going ask brother Ruben to make me a cockpit praise God with a stick in there I can get in there and pull that stick praise God oh hallelujah praise God God be praised yes sir you may be seated amen bless he that overcome it you had nothing to do to overcome he just pushed you through but you got to make decision for yourself I've got to make decision for myself and doing that watch we show our faith and respects to God but you only shown it to the Elder that you have faith in him but where's your faith in God when you come tramping down here defeated to the elders you showing that you yeah I believe you brother Garcia I believe you brother B brother fiori but do you believe [Applause] [Music] [Applause] him see what I mean maybe see that Abraham was promised a child but he must maintain This Promise for 25 years your promise the Holy Ghost but you must maintain This Promise for 25 years you promis a healing you must maintain your healing your promised Deliverance you must maintain your deliverance Hallelujah the ups and downs that he had Temptations in those 25 years but he held to the word of the promise praise God you got it now so then the head ship the intelligent will step right into it and shall be shall speak and so now by the close from Malachi 4's message the bride forms herself into the word image for the intelligence to step right into it then it is smitten a [Music] masterpiece yes sir see it's a call to perfection in this seed time or Pride time which is Harvest Time you ain't got much more time to go praise God on marriage and divorce page 14 thank you brother Bram said on page 14 usually a Revival only lasts about 3 years but this has been going on for over 15 years and not one denomination has sprung up from it for this is seed time you see what he's saying in 1946 it was the time of the Harvest and the angel of the Lord came and gave brother brandom the word which was seeds and it couldn't form no denomination because it was the word of God that's why he said 15 years there hasn't been a denomination you cannot denominate the word how can you denominate Jesus [Applause] Christ I don't may you could take justification and go around that sanctification and the in the gift and speaking in tongues you can denominate that but you cannot denominate this whole Bible here no way and brother Brown preached this Bible and they were seeds and they were four types of hearts that they were going to go into or good or grounds yes hey in all these years Malachi for's words were word seeds now there's no more shu after the shuck is gone is seed God is ready if he isn't doing it now he's going to call a church to Perfection by his word Jesus Christ see then then uh brother the son of man's words became brother bram's words brother Bram spoke them and put them here these were still his words which was the son of man's words then we take from this or to take and it's our words then amen but then it still remains there unless we speak it and once we speak it for our churches and family it becomes ours so what I took from the prophet became ours in this church whatever it was you understand I had the faith to do it and the anointing is here to prove it God is here praise God that's the way it will be done in the message and there is no other way is going to be done that's the way it was always done so brother I'm glad I saw it a long time ago you may be seated so his words become your words if you speak them back by faith amen by Revelation amen do you see the circumstances surrounding our coming to Perfection then see a Perfection amen it cannot come per infection cannot come from the Wayside now I'm going drive it home now the man already spoke it already it cannot come from the Wayside Hearts it cannot come from Stony Rocky Hearts it cannot come from Thorns which is still here by the way the other two gone amen but the Thorns are still hanging around yes sir see it can only come from the heart of good ground yes sir the parable of the Soul pictures the whole course of this age of Grace portraying reception of the word of God in different hearts and the results that follow yes sir and the Wayside Hearts those are like hard paths like right outside of a field and the farmer may have the field enclosed then there's some uh ground right outside of his enclosed field that's by the way side and when the se s the seeds the wind blew it right through the fence and it landed on the outside here well he didn't cultivate it outside there just laid right [Applause] there amen so therefore those hard paths with unenclosed fields or unplowed and unprepared ground and which could not receive seed to grow it and where the birds remember them birds flying through the the mines those dirty birds those birds fly right through there and pluck it right out of there praise God Amen and devour it oh Hallelujah and the Stony ground of Rocky Hearts partially prep now that ground was partially prepared ground but the stones that was not taken out they didn't take the time to pull them stones out those hard rocks in there mad of hoing grudges and stuff they didn't pull it out amen amen see they left it in there they in the message amen and we not taken out so the seed could grow and fully develop and they and they're gone among Thorns Hearts you see parly prepared ground but the Thorns were not all taken out so the seed could germinate and grow normally Glory understand now the way side Stony Thorns Thorns the craving passionate desire for other things creep in and choke and suffocate the word yes sir and lust for other things and becometh unfruitful Glory see these thorny hearts in St Luke 8:14 amen uh I was shouting and the Lord showed me this here last Sunday there I was reading that there I got a real blessing before that tape came that's when I got the inspiration here I was reading it there 8:14 and that which fell among Thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life I was reading and bring no fruit to Perfection I said wait a minute let me read this again I said well then the tears will I mean the thorns will never be perfected then why should I fool with [Applause] them the Bible says they will never be perfected they're full of lust and things for the world and cravings and this and that and yet is full of thorns and they didn't pull these thorns out and they're sitting right here in the church this morning full of thorns and they choke the word when the word comes in back up on the word see them things in the heart and right here said the word says I never saw it before the word says and bring no fruit to Perfection I said there you are so therefore Lord in it's seed time only one ground left that's the good ground oh we're here seed time PR time Harvest Time all the rest are finished glory to God oh Hallelujah ah yes sir may be seated there uh there is only one prepared ground and that can bring forth and that's a a good ground and that's uh uh St Matthew 13:23 you can read it it's so bring forth 100f amen and some bring forth 60 and 30 amen but we asking for 100f now the now you understand the manifestation of the seed word Joseph of affection in good ground amen that's my title that's why there's a revelation cuz it ain't it's not going to do nothing in the Thorns the Wayside are the Stony places ain't going to bring no Perfection at all and in the Bible said it'll not bring it amongst the Thorns which is the Pentecostal Spirits we know it the scriptures itself are seeds amen you believe that Satan's Eden page 14 praise God amen notice here here's a thought don't forget it I'll get this some other time or some other message but but you know God said let every seed bring forth of his kind is that God's commandment now what good is any preacher or anybody else to uh to try to make that word say something else now I can stay here about 20 minutes see that's what they've been doing in the message he said the uh the seed let it bring forth of his kind and the prophet said every word is a seed so these ministers takes these seeds and these books and tapes and changes them are you follow what I'm trying to give you illustration they try to change it to say something else but then he then you mess with it then it's hybrid but if you leave it alone it'll bring forth of his kind so you see so if it says seven Thunders will leave it it'll it'll gather the Bri together there you signed down in New Zealand the brother Beria wasn't looking for nobody but these people begin to gathered in the last two years themselves nobody went down there to get them God got them oh praise God my God glory glory so what good is any preacher anybody else to try to make that word say something else like the serpent did it shall you shall not surely die he changed the word put one word in there and it was hybrid and and he died you see every word of God is a seed Jesus said so the seed a soul a soul so if Mark 16 is God's word it will bring forth of its kind if Malachi 4 is God's word it'll bring forth of his kind and every other promise must bring forth of his kind if Ephesians 4 amen amen five-fold Ministry it'll bring forth of his kind a perfect man I mean can't nobody in this message throughout the fivefold ministry no way cuz it's a seed oh there will be Apostles and Prophets and teachers and evangelists and pastors that will be might be five but it'll be cuz it's a [Applause] seed may not be who they want it to be but it'll be anyway every seed will bring forth of its kind if you're a seed of God and attribute a Son of God you may be seated and then the word of God is sown in you see and then you hear the word of God my sheep hear my voice a stranger they won't follow you get it then every seed comes forth at his own kind and we only preach one kind in here brother praise God a word image kind in Here We Don't Preach no other kind of soft soaping stuff around here amen so every word of God is a seed and these are positive scriptures that's taking on life in spirit and every word of God's a seed and the Thunders and Perfection adoption and the Holy Ghost itself is seeds so is the negative seeds also end time uh end time seed sign quote Jesus said there would be a a a fearful signs and sights in the heavens and men's Hearts failing them for fear perplexity of time distress between the Nations don't you see that seed time is here now the Harvest time is a prophet when you see distress when you see all these filthy things and on Time Square all up and these demons com out of hell this is seed time those were the word of God spoken it was only a word then hidden but now it's taking life and walking around the street and some demons are taking straws and they call the dart man and shooting and things like this here and these demons are going wounding and all kind of things that's taking life that's negative but what about a positive PR hallelujah it's time for you to receive the Holy Ghost amen [Applause] glory glory to God do you see it distress between nations and perplexity of times don't you see maybe seated that se time is here now the Harvest Time the things the Bible said will come to pass that seed that's been planted don't you see it's taking life and living that's what's the matter the Shucks are dead the life has passed through her leaving her yellow straw amen yes sir and now the seed or bride is dead right for a manifestation oh hallelujah praise God see what it is now it is Christ the anointing coming to the seed word Hallelujah on Tampa of paradise see quote see it's Christ coming to his body now what is it Christ coming to his body Christ is the word we all know that Christ is the anointing that comes on the word that makes the word live is that right Christ is anointing Spirit comes upon the word it quickens the word to make it live now the word is in your heart see that's good ground amen you believe in Divine Healing whatever more see and Christ the anointing come into the body see the connection there just like husband and wife to be one this is a quote now the church has got to get to the ministry until the church and Christ become one he can anoint you for every blessing that's in the Bible all of it is yours Oh Come Alive Church everything as promised for this age is yours unquote everything your husband your wife the Holy Ghost Deliverance is yours we are here [Applause] now do you see why you may be seated see why it must be seed word time what is Promised for this age by Malachi 4 Malachi 4 also said this word is God the word is allotted here on or this day for this day yes there's got to be somebody come by that that word can be quickened to and make that word live oh do you know what I'm saying after the prophet left he left the word but the the word was anointed and then the elected seeds of God that would get in the spirit it's got to be somebody picked up for the word to come to and Quicken that thing to him and then way they go that's the way it goes you may be seated Jesus did this the early did this the seven Church ages did this Malachi 4 did this so what's so strange about somebody today doing this what the what I mean they did it down in New Zealand and was nobody even there see what I mean they were elected to do it then what they fighting me for what did I do is it not a cause I mean can I take the anointed word also and preach it [Applause] [Music] hallelujah what about the seed word may be seed I'm almost finished what about the seed word Joseph Perfection Bride for this day Hallelujah quote Paradox what is the word for This Day quote look at those four Patriarchs Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph Abraham election Isaac calling Jacob Grace Joseph Perfection nothing against him him that's God working his way out and you keep telling them and telling them and telling them there's nothing against you I told them Minister I told them all you can't hurt me you can't curse me there's nothing against me because Joseph Perfection came in my heart in 1964 and God worked his way out of my heart right through the 60s the 7s the ' 80s right down the 1990 God has worked his way out and you also so who what if God be for you who can be against you huh if God is your judge God is your lawyer and the judge says not guilty are you going to argue against that not guilty Glory hey hallelujah praise God [Music] Glory Hallelujah [Music] Glory thank you [Applause] Lord amen amen you may be seated nothing against him that's God God working his way out Abraham knew there was nothing against him so he kept on going regardless of what they said he had a revelation no one knew there was nothing against him see you have a revelation you don't care what the 400 says doesn't matter if it's 1,000 doesn't matter cuz you have a revelation now nothing against him that's God working his way out see because it came to the word if it was the Pentecostal Jacob Grace didn't I don't know you see but when they came down to Joseph off a masterpiece then it hit the word then and he said now watch Luther West the Pentecost and the campstone now he's changing Joseph we just said Abraham Isaac uh and the other one there Abraham Isaac uh um Jacob and Joseph and he laid it out now he come in here nothing against him nothing against Joseph watch Luther Wesley Pentecost and the Capstone now Joseph becomes the Capstone now we got the word now you understand my message praise God now I'm bringing it home now and the Capstone when the church and the word becomes the same thing exactly perfectly amen he's still I am not I was I am present tense the pillow fire is identified scientifically and by the re

praise God the the clothes will be [Applause] soon yay the clothes will be actually put on you [Applause] yes sir see the discrepancy page five he said the seed of God the word of God Jesus said in a certain place that the word is a seed and every seed will bring forth of his kind and now if the Christian the children of God the children of the Kingdom has become the seed of God then they must be the word of God and we become the word of God praise God through Joseph Perfection the Capstone Jesus Christ yes sir now we are the word of God from this day on out you the word of God say brother I'm

his word at the beginning and each age has had its seed his time its promises the word is a seed every seed will bring forth of his kind now if the children of the Kingdom has become the seed of God and this is seed time Bri time Hallelujah then they must be the word of God and the word of God manifested in the age that they are living in for the promised seed of that age and each age has had its seed as time as promises praise God and praise God Malachi 4 time was to restore back the word to the end time bride who puts the seeds into good ground for the manifestation of the seed word Joseph Perfection Capstone word Promises of husband and wife being self same person with the same life same power same sign same wonders same Miracle same everything else don't you worry it's going to be see the people of that age that manifest that promised word Joseph affection is the seed of that age and the good ground is going to prove it and all these people did thony grounds and in the world in and out that they going you going to see they bring no Perfection praise God they are the children of the Kingdom that's right the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating through his children is those seed of the Kingdom at that age so when now we talking about a manifestation will be the seed not because you say it or I have the books and the tapes no the manifestation that'll be it praise God Amen the manifestation of the spirit operating through his children is the seed of the age the seed amen shall not be able to Shu as I said before seed time briad time Shucks are dead time for the seed to ripen in good ground and honors and good heart having heard the word from Malachi 4 keep it and bring forth 100 fold fruit to glorify the father with patience oh praise God see the entire seed comes forth on the top of the seed word Joseph Perfection campstone Foundation amen amen the very person the seven color rainbows is on the top of that Foundation comes forth on the top of that Foundation Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that person amen and the and the Bible exactly the word of God and we become Tabernacles of that Holy Spirit which is Christ see that's the real seed then if that real Holy Spirit gets into that real seed of the word you have got to take it all every word cuz Satan uses uh 99 and 910 he can't take the full word see to me now if the real seed you a word seed you don't have the Holy Ghost yet you're the word seed but when you get the Holy Ghost you become a real seed Hallelujah then he said here if that real Holy Ghost gets into that real seed my God spontaneous combustion yes sir St John 1578 you bind me my words are bind you you shall ask what you will and shall be done unto you let every seed come forth of his kind amen now remember every spoken word of God is the Original Seed as long as you stay with the Original Seed it will breed itself right back and reproduce itself again that's why Malachi 4 St Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 was sent to restore us back to the original word amen here's the reason why on the spoken word Original Seed Amen on part one uh page 22 I'm finishing up now musicians amen page 21 finish now oh what a parable how I could use a preach a text on this here and he says and other seed fell on good ground sprang up and bear fruit 100 fold and when he had said these things he screamed out something maybe like this when he said bring forth a 100 fold he that have an ear let him hear in other words if your ear is tomb with God let him hear and disciples asked him saying what might the parable be he said unto you is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom unto you is given to know the seven Thunders unto you is given to know all the Mysteries praise God because the Mysteries themselves come down from God to the prophet on the earth as the word of God yes sir and the true word of God was hid in the Seven Seals but it came to the prophet when the prophet spoke it it became a word seed that was swn into you Hallelujah if you don't tamper with it leave it alone praise God it'll come to fructation it will perform exactly what it said it would do yes sir praise God unto you may be seated is given know the mysteries of the Kingdom the Mysteries see what he's talking about here now watch what is the mysteries of the Kingdom watch here a minute Mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in Parables uh see that they seeing might not see and hearing they might not understand now this not me now it's Malachi 4 talking here see but God's word comes right on down to the judgment to judge them because they did see it it was [Applause] there 25 years it was there seven Thunders gathers of bride together it was there seven thunders of bride Revival it was there seven Thunders show you how to prepare for great translation faith it was there oh hallelujah praise God but in hearing and see they might not see they wasn't ordained to see it but you ordained to see it praise God and you ordained to go and bring forth fruit unto a hundredfold to glorify the father whether your mother your father your sister your brother your husband your wife don't see it praise God you see it amen amen maybe SE now the parable is this the seed is the word of God what is the seed of life the word of God God therefore for life you can't come through a Creed you can't come through a denomination you got to come back to the word now the seed of life all right his word is his seed and his spirit is the water right now St John 3:14 Jesus is the word of God and he would burst it open that life the life that's inside the seed are you oh man all these years cold on top of quot on top of is becoming a seed and all of a sudden you get a tape from New Zealand and you already have a thought to bring it to the seed amen and you get a witness from down in New Zealand totally impossible 13 years ago it should have been uh not forwarded amen praise God and you get on down and you know you're coming right to that word then if we are becoming that Joseph perfection Capstone word then the germ is in the [Applause] seed and the germ is going to burst open because in the germ is the [Applause] water in the germ is the [Applause] spirit but but you got to have the seed in you it's got to be in good ground otherwise the the the the Thorns choke it suffocated it am I speaking to you amen you may be seated so make up your mind what kind of ground you want to be when before you go out of this church the life inside the seed that life which is Spirit water flowing over the spirit over the seed of God will bring forth the life of the seed and it brings forth something else then there's some other kind of seed there then do you understand yes sir you're in this message butless you got the real message in there when that water flows over there it'll bring something else if the spirit of God comes forth to water the seed if it's the seed that's watering it will produce the life of the seed yes seed water will produce Seed Life God Amen yes sir praise God praise God and uh you can't expect to have a seed in you of some mixed hybrid thing in this message then when the Dynamics come floating over the spirit and you expect to be a seed when you're already highbrid and many are hbrd in this message and don't know it yes sir and it brings forth something else and some other kind of seed is is there then amen do you understand if the spirit of God come forth the water the seed if it's the seed that's watering it'll produce the life of the seed is that clear produce the life of the seed for that what it is give for I believe the Bible is the word and the whole truth and Jesus is the word made manifest in his word word is one and the same amen yes sir now Jesus is the word made manifest he and the word is one the same that's why made manifest him so perfectly that's the reason God manifest himself so perfectly in Jesus because he was the seed word The Germ word itself the germs that's the germ that's inside the seed you get it now is the word and the word is a seed and the seed is a germ Glory and the word has come to seed after all these years first of just a word in the last days this this shall happen many things shall take place that's the word but then when it when life begin to strike it and the spirit hit it it begin to go to [Applause] seed praise God then if that seed if is a positive and the message of Joseph Perfection and Strikes and life hits Joseph Perfection oh praise God then that goes that word Joseph affection begins to go to seed and the seed is the [Applause] Capstone then when that germ in the campstone bur open oh we're getting close somewhere for this season coming up what a seven Thunder Revival is going to be I know where I'm at glory to God you may be seated because it was a seed word The Germ word itself The Germ that's inside the seed that's the life in the seed you get it see he was a germ word of God the germ is the spirit The Germ is the water and Jesus had to be broken open there in order for that seed to let forth his life toward other seed that was coming like0 in El room and so forth do you see it even he said other sheep I have that not even of this fold they're going to see that they're going to they're going to get that word and stay right with it and I'm sending forth the spirit to water it and it will produce just exactly it will produce Miracles it will it will produce the power of God it will not deny anything because it's a kindred seed and let every seed bring forth of its kind it's kind let Joseph Perfection campstone bring forth of his kind in the [Music] message yes y yes sir it will produce Miracles it produce the power of God and it will not deny anything because it's a kindred seed with the seed oh my tell you here's a seed the Bible is the word of God and then what's in here is Kindred with that amen this says Don't Lie No More it doesn't [Applause] lie don't cheat no more don't cheat hallu don't be no wher don't be no wher don't backbite evil surise that doesn't do it because it's Kindred now do you understand church back to the Bible back to the word you see where we at now now where are they at in the message oh when we back to the word the message was to bring us back to the Bible then we are supposed to live the Bible the message showed us all the popular sins to stay away [Applause] from and what not to do and say something nice speak nice but now it's got to come and I'm stepping forward to say it's here we got to come back to this Bible where we will live this Bible we will be written Epistles R of all man the Bible any argument in the church will be settled by the Bible amen settled by the Bible amen you may be seated see and it will not deny anything because the Kindred seed with the seed it can say Mr cber you can come live with me no sir no no no it won't do it no indeed it just won't mix you can't mix death and life you can't be dead and alive at the same time you can't mix up a a lot with Abraham praise God I hope you got me got to separate now brother yes sir so now you got it the germ is a water germ is a spirit my do you see it Church Church Jesus is the word Malachi 4 Jesus is the word St Luke 17:30 Jesus is the word revelation 10 and he loosed water to make us grow in this message yes sir now Jesus the Capstone restored is the seed word Joseph affection and now it's time for The Germ which is the spirit which is the water to flow over the word SE Joseph Perfection and it comes through the body it came through Jesus body it came through the early bride body came through Malachi 4's body down Through the Ages and now it's coming through our body other words a man will stand up and say while this man he yet spake these words through the [Applause] body oh hallelujah praise God my God page 29 The Works that Jesus did if a man had has the seed of God in him with the spirit of God watering that seed the same works of Jesus manifest in Jesus him being the Original Seed of God his death brings you back to the original seed of God and if the same spirit that was within him is in you then the same Works will be manifested you don't believe that then turn over St John 14:12 then the works will be manifested in him are the same for it's the same seed word of God God's son was his example seed and what is like life was when the spirit poured upon him after his baptism and the Holy Ghost come upon him that very life that he produce will that same watering Spirit of the Holy Ghost and I'm looking for it to be the Holy Ghost itself to be the watering spirit in this [Applause] church then he'll come upon you down at the River St Matthew 3:16 And1 17 the dove will come upon you and water you then that life that he Liv you'll live that life after his baptism and that's before St Matthew 17 amen oh praise God the watering spirit will bring forth the same kind of a life doing the same thing and he did if it's the same seed Son of God would bring forth the son of God's seed then he says here now shame on you women with bobbed hair shame on you preachers denying the truth that's right hair has nothing to do with it see and he begin to all that baby stuff there amen oh I'm finished now [Music] tired praise God the shuck is dead seed time bride time germ water and spirit time bursting from The Germ of the seed of the word of Joseph affection sew ye and reap and plant Vineyards and eat the fruit thereof oh what a time I believe that he's the hours here now for the manifestation the seed word Joseph Perfection uh Capstone in good ground and how will the water come the seed plant the seed must have water seed water before it can grow it must have water to fall before the seed that's been planted can grow then every seed will bring forth of his own kind and remember the Earth is full of seeds and the rain makes it bring forth of it after its kind so therefore the J that's inside of the seed that's the life in the seed Jesus was German of the word of God the German is the spirit The Germ is the water now how was that done in the apostolic times okay here we are two quotes and finish page 54 part two the spoken word he that Hearth you heareth me and he that despises you despises me he that despises me despise him that sent me that proves that God speaks his message through his servants always has that's right now the power of the believing Church Christ has all power in heavens and earth you believe that then what if he is in you has Christ got all power Matthew 2018 all right he is the seed word in his body and he in US becomes a seed word in us do you understand what we're lacking from the early bride Christ himself son of man gave them the word amen they had the word they received all the words and they had the seeds and they went in the upper room and the water began to gush down am seeall so then he came back through Malachi 4 to give us the word but it's been a process of time over 20 some years so many false anointed ones got among it and and and then and everything and so forth but it came right down anyway praise God it had to come back to that seed word my God and that seed word is Joseph Perfection the Capstone that fourth line the top of the foundation cuz every thing every promise is down in there so when that water hits it comes up GL yes sir it's already in you brother Roman it's going to be like a Roman Candle brother it's going to burst and burst and burst and burst my God yes sir he is a sea word in the body and he in US becomes a seaw word in us all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church that's the power now watch remember God's law of reproduction now remember at this kind the seed of Christ the word must come through his body oh are you getting tired all right just a minute now let's just hold quiet and pray I want to get this in real good I want this to grind down the seed of Christ must must come through the body his body not through the nomination but through a born again seed of the word must come through now the man must be born again amen the man must have the Holy Ghost before any uh life come through there at all so that's been the problem in this message many ministers without the Holy Ghost they can't bring
