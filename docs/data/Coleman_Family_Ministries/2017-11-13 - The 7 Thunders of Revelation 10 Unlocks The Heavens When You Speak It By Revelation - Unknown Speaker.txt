John 14 toil verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do and greater works than these shall he do because I go into my father and twentieth verse a man in it at that day you shall know that I'm in my father and you and me ye and me and I in you and sin st. John 15:7 you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you amen in Revelation 10 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his hand and his face was was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on on the earth and cry with a loud voice that's when a lion roaring and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had other their voices I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven other and write them not mercy and the voice which I heard from heaven speaking to me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and I went into the ain t and said unto him give me the little book you said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweetest honey and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten in my belly was bitter and he said unto me then thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings so now made a lot of a blessing read numbers word and we see here in Revelation 10 8 through 11 it was a prophecy that was to go forth after the Prophet left amen I promise II had to go forth after 1966 you may be seated and that prophecy was a testimony of Jesus which is a spirit of prophecy so praise God [Applause] so praise God well I got a little thought this morning amen and also I can stand up here on this my legs this arthritis brother no I got a title amen the seven thunders of Revelation 10 unlocks the heavens when you speak it by revelation [Applause] kind of go back and pick it up and bring it to a point bring it to a spot to where you can see it amen okay and my subject is the thing may be seated the faint manifested that's what I'm saying now D faith manifested Raziel the names in the Lamb's Book of Redemption and we have a Amen and it had another testimony here brother powerful testimony here amen so praise God so friends things are really really moving fast and well here it is all kind of things are happening and we thank God to be in the inspiration of the hour to know where we are going where we come from and what we're doing amen so here's a testimony from brother Tyrion brother Joshua uh what happened in India at the last convention precious brother home and God bless you I have just received this test point from India after the convention which was held last week which has inspired me tremendously I feel like shouting aloud blessed be the name of the Lord glory hallelujah I thank and and praise the Lord for proof in his word again and again it was a sister by the name of Shama living in northern India who while traveling on a road through a forest encountered a wild elephant within a distance about 2 to 3 meters from her panic had gripped her and she was virtually paralyzed as the result she felt her strength leaving her and she collapsed down the elephant moved toward her and lifted its leg and attempted to trample her it was then a voice spoke from within her tell her to speak to the animal she commanded the beast in the name of Jesus Christ stand still the elephant stopped advancing toward her and stood there art saved her about three to four days after the incident a woman who had seen her commanding the elephant stopped he was still there like that you tell Mike the wording is not powerful we need little for frogs and flies we're looking for the Word of God have sets you free from whatever bondage whatever you're in the spoken word of God sent touch people free hallelujah amen this is reality here praise God amen they be seated but three or four days after the incident a woman who had seen her commanding the elephant saw the animal unmoved it was bound by the spirit in the same place she had heard the sister uttering something but thought it was some chance she came back to this as it would not move from that place brother stop the demons my god yes sir I mean he might as well stop praising God because that third phase is here in a more turn to come any all saddened down praise God hallelujah amen get on fire for God and written the skies send down a Holy Ghost and fire praise his wonderful name a may may be seated Amen we not look for no quiet third phase [Applause] amen look for fire a man may be seated this sister then prayed and the elephant moved away from that place the sister had to come back and pray for the elephant become unbound loosen and let him go amen see much power you have sisters huh glory to God's with you God loves you praise God he'll never leave her he'll never forsake you stay with that word the sister had attended the convention in her testimony has begun a tremendous revival among the Saints just like brother Branham said he said on Israel in the homeland 1953 the Indians like the natives of Africa has got to see the power of God and demonstration we would see Jesus saskatoon 57 but just one of the supernatural of the supernatural America over over and India why my just one time that's all it needs and everything that will raise up I don't care what condition they're in there make an effort Oh now will you make an effort today I don't care what condition you're in will you make an

revival did you huh you traveled here with the revival in you amen I'm only trying to preach the bring down the Holy Ghost to strike those seeds as in you're ready to revive you then that brings on revival it may be seated there's no preacher can bring a revival he doesn't pack it with him and the only thing he can do is just to be loyal to God in His Word and revival has to come by the people in your home in your life now revival isn't adding new members to the church is reviving that what we've already got to revive means to bring back a revival revive them seven seals seeds that's in you bring it back until a manifestation praise God amen now if God has promised a revival here may be seated we're going to have it if God is promised revival here we're going to have it seven thunders give faith amen then every gonna have it and he certainly has promised it then we're gonna have it then let's make ready for it Amen if God promised to heal let's make ready for it if Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also let's make it ready for it move on everything getting ready to be right in time amen move all the unbelief I'll move everything out I'm expecting the Holy Ghost to come down and set in order a church that'll go to meet him praise God amen amen I've got to go to meet him fill with the power and the resurrection of Jesus Christ brother Imran said I'm expecting that I believe it God promises that there be a church there without spot or wrinkle on it I'm expecting because God said it so God said so he said he would heal you he said he would fill you he said he would bring your family and God said soul they'd be expecting that on his third phase don't come in and no more down and sad coming in look for fire like think about that Indian woman stop in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah my anticipations and expectations is built way up high I felt led to come out to California may be seated and he's gonna do something for somebody that's the one thing

times or I wouldn't do it I felt led led by the Holy Ghost praise God him hey man yes I want to be led of it and then I'll be expecting something to happen just like Simeon praise God the hold it goes I told he would see the Christ amen that spoke the word that was in him they went on in one day Simeon still sitting at devour praise God sanctified pulled away from everything else hallelujah waiting on the coming of the Lord then the Holy Ghost come upon Simeon said Simeon stand up this is the day maybe this is your day praise God hallelujah and Simeon led by the Holy Spirit went into the temple there were many young women in there with babies praise God but each home not just one not that one not just one not this one this one here praise God hallelujah and you picked the baby up it prophesied oh my come on praise God hallelujah Laura we we under great expectation are you for an outpouring of the dynamics in your mechanics that correct may be seated we are an expectation for the faith to return back to the Omega bride as it was with the Alpha bride you expecting that the faith manifestation will bring on another theevans even the ministry of the spirit that quickeneth a bride believe us on this the manifested lands book of redemption will be the Word made flesh what what God does among us amen the seventh under revelation is a revelation of life the understand is from the Bible it's a revelation of life what life your life in the last book of Redemption that's the revelation for 27 years seven thunders get faint whole hallelujah is in an episodic Church with the faith manifested our life and our life will burn as manifested will be his land his science his spirit his wonders his miracles that's what the seventh under inspiration is crying out for a seventh under Revelation in you is crying out for the life and second Peter one four through seven the book of Ephesians and the entire Bible is crying out for that Lord send down the Holy Ghost poured his faith into me that I might live what that word says hallelujah glory to God Lord I want to live the life of 2nd Peter 1 Ephesians back to the Bible you all don't want to be a dump in a position in police sons and daughters of God that's why I'm here that's why I drove all the way from Pennsylvania Massachusetts New York state from all the downside Jersey all the way from Ohio in the end up in Canada I drove there for that there's something pulsating in me I want that life I gotta have that light amen brother Nigel he came all the way from Florida he wants that life hallelujah the full green abides in you hallelujah and the ship cannot impersonate the word in you they cannot take the word they pull away they go out amen Saint John 15:7 yield by day me and my words about you should I ask what you will and this shall be done unto you [Applause] brother I wish it wasn't tie and worn I feel let praise right in here about 15 minutes is over Gloria everything is right hallelujah my God my God hallelujah at the last convention you may be seated I spoke about Elijah amen and I spoke and it kind of blew the ministers Minds out since seven thunders Lochte's the heavens until you speak it so I knew one day I would have to come back on the other side brother Dave and speak the seven thunders unlocks the heavens when you're speaking yes sir so I took the first King 17:1 as the Lord God of Israel livid before whom I stand this should not be do nor rain these years but according to my word this was spoken to Ahab then you know back in Israel's time and this was the largest three-and-a-half year prophecy to Israel of judgment and amen and famine and everything else this was his first public act was to lock to heavens by his prophecy so that no rain fell for three and a half years he locked two heavens by his word neither rain nor dude shall come out of heaven except I save soul hallelujah seven thunders locks the heavens until you speak it amen and doing the trail a woman a widow woman who received Elijah was speared just like you have been could you receive them thunders praise God this has not been locked to you it's been showering down showers of blessings upon you glory to God amen praise God a aim a man Laurita cut [Applause] yes sir and then first King 1711 a prophecy may be seated for thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not always neither shall the cruse of the oil fail until the day NAT the Lord scented the rain upon the earth and until he sends it rejoice worship praise God because you got meal in the barrel oil in the Cruze every Sun in wizzy you have a cake you have something to eat during the famine during the drought well why can't we thank God for that praise God all around the world if famishing yes sir first Kings 18:21 Elisha unlock the heavens you may be seated and you lied to send a name get the up eat and drink for there's a sound of abundance of rain oh praise God in the time of the latter rain asks you for rain back to the Bible amen first Kings 1844 he told his servant praise God Elisha got up God spoke to him he unlocked the heavens and then they told his servant in the message go look for rain and he come back with a burden of there is nothing nothing very nothing and they all are bales of I mean all the profits of Bale was killed in Jezebel nothing and their Fire come down from heaven with no a with no help on the sacrifice and burn up the seven seal seven Thunder prophecy consumed it and they say there's nothing they say the seven seals closed only six seals nothing there it rained it there's nothing and Elijah said you go again seven times praise God and he went on the seventh time I see a cloud like a man's hand [Applause] what's that mean at the first supernatural thing you see move praise God begin to praise God begin to think him for it that's God you saw the cloud like a man's hand and he told him praise God and in the next verse and it came to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and it was a great rain you believe that he was 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever and may be seated so now we see the manifestation of the seven thunders unlocks to heaven when you speak it by revelation that correct Amen the seven thunders unlocks the heaven when you speak it now I've done this how many times but I'm gonna do it again a lot of new people a man on the third seal page 242 in the beginning was a were in a worry but with God in a word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt with us God talked with us in flesh he was the word before word it's a thought and a thought has to be created alright so God's thoughts become creation when it spoke by our word hey man yeah I say what I'm saying God has created in here for the last 27 years thunders is God's thoughts and then spoken by a word and now is in you just wait to that dynamics strikes that seed in you praise God when that seed gets ripe and that God sends down the fire and lick up praise God just like it did Elijah sacrifice Oh hallelujah you can tell the world about this you can tell the nations about that but you go tell them that there's a seven thunder manifestation then broke out here in New York City Pennsylvania hallelujah flying in from everywhere Laurita God glory to God yes sir okay may be seated and the thought has to be created all right so God's thoughts become creation when they spoke power word that's when he presents it to you as a thought his thoughts and he's revealing you then there's still a fall until you speak it you know and I usually break this down into four things there amen let us know to you as a thorn amen then number two his thoughts seven sealed message seven thunders his thoughts number three and is revealed to you and it has been a man since 74 here number four even always revealed to you this morning you sitting here and from Ojai in the air cannon everywhere else puerto rico wherever it's still a thought until you speak it it's not going nowhere amen it's still a thought then your church you must speak it and you must may be seated now you cannot speak it with condemnation that's why many cannot speak it come the nation see okay the third seal amen page three or four now we've had them coming last night with his great sword to kill we find out he gets killed with the sword to the sword of the word gods were a sharp two-edged sword slaves and puts them down right down come on Satan you know wait till them seven thunders uttered their voices of that group who can really take the Word of God and hand it there with no condemnation that's the group with no condemnation praising God no gossip no nothing but devout sanctifying a memorial up in heaven for your prayers like Cornelius that's the group praise God how many do we have here this morning why you can bring down the fire from the ramparts of glory praise God amen hallelujah hand it there it'll slice and cut make it close the heaven thick and shut there's a do that whatever they want to believe us out of this hallelujah well glory to God you got your mind on the Lord you're not worrying about what's in this world you're not worrying about the things of the world Amen but your single eye single motive single purpose [Applause] just God devout hallelujah everything else and faded away you see heaven coming into view you're walking around like Abraham seeking a city whose builder and maker is God praise God I'm only a pilgrim here and it's proving the ground I'm not from here I come from God I'm going backed up God praise God there's no devil there's no nothing there's no money there's nothing that can stop praise God I've been predestinated hallelujah praise God to

[Applause] hallelujah okay you speak it and because it is the largest three-year seventh seal seventh under prophecy you may be seated hallelujah you've been called out that's why you're here you've been elected and you've been set in the book of life you see your name there you shouting and praising God you have an adju Polly this morning hallelujah you feel like the larger of old prophecy of you know that there will be an abundance of rain it will not fail my words shall not return to me void it shall prosper in the thing I've sent it into hallelujah cannot fail aren't you happy this morning know that there's a God in you that cannot fail there's a god in you that can make a way when there is no way there's a God that can keep you can keep your husband and your wife and your children there's a god that can stop elephants from stopping you can stop demons praise God can push their the heavens and let the Holy Ghost fall down upon you and baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire [Applause] Laura whoa hallelujah then if they're the largest prophecy was able to bring down rain praise God what about this Elijah's prophecy what about his seventh seal seventh under prophecy huh praise God amen you'll send down the dynamics to your mechanics they become a sound from heaven it'll take such a baptism of the Holy Ghost into you let it take you up off of this earth into a wrap chant grace hah amen talk on the word Chicago amen you may be seated go in a car hallelujah ho hallo Chuck Lorre Chicago Illinois in 1953 and I believe that the age has come now the the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the Spirit and power and signs and wonders this great outpouring of God's Spirit in the last days now why it's just outpouring of the spirit and that's the thing that'll bring faith into the people do you understand what I'm saying we got to this third phase for the spirit to bring the faith because you have the word you got the Gunpowder but you don't have the faith to ignite the power oh that's leaning you praise God do you see that the spirit must bring this faith that's the thing that it brings faith into the people that'll take our rapt in faith that'll take the church into glory I believe it how can the church be wrapped in when we have a gun when we haven't even got faith for healing we got to have wrapped in faith first we got to have somebody come back and bring a message to give us faith to restore back the faith faith now faith is hollow now faith is not will be shall be now now now faith is [Applause] yes sir [Applause] ah you know Lauren a man we got to have wrapped in faith first that's right how that God moves by his Spirit signs and wonders begin to follow everywhere God begins to move signs and wonders follows God if it's here if it's there wherever you are with the revelation seven thunders God moves there Amen hallelujah glory just great amen you may be seated this way pouring out of God's Spirit in the last days hallelujah and that's the thing that are bringing into the people see how the word must come forth first amens then the promise of the Spirit to bring the faith into the people in brother brain matter seven seals seven Thunder prophecy the word back to the Bible back to the word and we've been out here about thirty-eight years waiting for the spirit what is coming cannot fail because of prophecy not one word is failed the first seal page 128 amen he says the funds will be revealed right away and when it does it will gather the people together for raps and faint page 142 the seven thunders will give faith for wrapped in grace first seal page 155 the seventh tons of revelation they showed up show to Brian how to prepare for a great translation faint amen these are problems I'm bringing them back why because God's fix him to anoint him praise God on his third phase yes sir third seal page 253 the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to stir the Brian yet see we're looking forward it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it did you get it ex I'm trying to create expectation we're looking for it are you he will send it he promised it hey man promise what tom was a manifestation of the seven thunders a starter Brian Amen you believe that all this was worried worried worried worried worried but now his his here's a quote for the promise for the manifestation the manifestation of the seventh tongues of Revelation 10 influence Phoenix 1963 what we've seen happens should make every should put every soul in action are you in action may be seated it should make a church that would make a revival here in Phoenix what about here you do it I cannot do it the people do it you make this revival Pennsylvania New York you do it it's about time for you to do it amen hearing thing is that the people would be flying in from Europe to see what's taking place there it's safe there's a place in Arizona call the Maricopa Valley City call Phoenix there's something broke out there until here it is the seven thunders of Revelation ten it's not even wrote in the Bible that's being manifested there's your quote for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit the dynamics to your mechanic this is the one praise God amen to power God the end time is here the angel has gathered up the loose ends were here he was about to write those done he said don't write them seal them up and that day at the sounding of the dis layer this last seventh angel seventh church age the Laodicean Church age the mystery of God all about God how God's not a big bunch of gods but one and all these other things that all should be fission that time and then that they took the six seals and did all and explained God huh then he went into that seventh seal silence prayer Scott he took the seven thunders from revelation 10 he took the seven thunders on the backside of the Bible and he slid it in there hallelujah and there it leaves oh it's about time that half an hour just about up it's about time for the God to ring the skies Oh hallelujah my my my glory so you say 2/7 under revelation 10 unlocks the heavens when you speak it that's right exactly yes sir maybe you see that God said so God said so would then be expecting it God said soul sister Carol you'd be expecting God to bring your husband in here look for it this is the hour this is a time praise God Lena seven thunders seventh seal manifested is another seasons the promised land Holy Spirit but if you know what you're in praise God the seven thunders is a key may be seen it is the key that unlocks the heavens when you speak it by revelation amen the faith manifested reveals the names in the Lamb's Book of Redemption now what is faith praise God what is faith anyway I mean what is the faith okay the faith earnestly continue for the faith amen Indiana Connersville Indiana 1953 okay what do I have here praise God deep faith and one hey man so praise God and the faith it in here at the beginning a man [Applause] okay here we are okay now how marvelous earnestly contend to me cozy a little bit Amen hallelujah I don't know where I'm doing this brother if I had my strength young strong praise God not the team is left and right praise God send son of Thunder bolts of lightning in there a man earnestly continue for the faith may be seated that was once delivered to the Saints and now the very faith that they had at the beginning it supposed to be today yet a man and in order to preach the gospel before you can make it a gospel to be preached then you got to have the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel the letter killeth the word to let it kill it the spirit make it a line so it's not just a ritualistic affair but it's absolutely a real living reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ living among men hallelujah and the and that's the faith that I'm trying my best to contend for today that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and his power is unlimited don't limit God by your reasoning or God wouldn't do that for me don't limit God with your imagination all things are possible God said soul hallelujah the hardest thing that you think that God cannot do those are the things he would love to do yes so that very things that you think he cannot do that's what he wants to do don't limit God that is seated and that's the faith that's the faith that I have been contending for since December 6 26 1965 myself me Amen shout of the king praise god I've been contended for ever since I don't care who come in here who left who did this don't matter to me as child of the king is in the camp and I've been here all these years and I was standing in my luck I'll prophesy in a clear day the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy no demon no devil no nothing can take me out of here hallelujah [Applause] Laurey [Applause] a man okay maybe see continue for the faith Zurich Switzerland 1955 okay now Jesus brought this faith who introduced the faith huh John the Baptist introduced it he introduced Jesus to the world and Jesus and introduced the faint a man sitting right here now when the faith was first introduced to the world the faith that we we are to earnestly contend for John the Baptist introduced it he introduced Jesus to the world and Jesus introduced the faith now let's go back and see what faith he introduced to the world and he went on speak about the faith and that's when he said it's not me but the father do it the works you got it now that's why I read st. John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also the fame and that that day you shall know the father to me and I am the father you and me and I on you at that day you shall know about the faith [Applause] yes sir okay may be seated the Apostles had that faith you believe that yes sir continue earnestly continue for the face Chicago 1955 the Apostles had it amen the faith that was once live to the Saints what is it the Spirit of Christ in the Apostle is that right the Spirit of Christ in the Apostles we have often called the book the Acts of the Apostles that was wrong it's the Acts of Christ in the Apostles which is the faith because they were men but they have the same faith now the Spirit of Christ in the Apostles which what what is what that was doing that 33 years later Jude said continually contend for that faith I will give all dealings to write unto you to exhort you to stir you up in other words that you would earnestly contend earnestly are you doing that earnestly keep holding out for the same thing have you done that I'll have you give up huh God's only testing you yes sir that was delivered to the Saints does your church believe that if it does its contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints earnestly contend for the faith does your church plead the Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Spirit here today if we believe the Holy Spirit is here then the Bible said Jesus was the same yesterday today and forever then the same Holy Spirit was upon the apostles has got to be the same Holy Spirit that's here today amen yes sir so amen and the spirit and impulses amen okay praise God then there's one other parcel here that wasn't around in then he came later and that's the Paul aim and it they let him Jesus Christ the same Macon Georgia in 1955 they let him down into the streets and he laid there praying and fast and way down in the city was a man contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints by the name of Ananias one day while he was praying of vision came before him and said go up there in the street called straight and ask for certain place and go in and lay your hands upon Saul that he might receive his sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost brother Saul even the Lord had a pair to you on the road knocked you down off your high horse gave you a Damascus Road experience knocking off the high horse before you get the Holy Ghost hallelujah glory to God amen Oh sent me that then I might lay my hands on you and you might receive your sight and B watch this here now and be filled with the Holy Ghost the faith that was delivered to the Saints that's the faith yes who is the faith the person of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost itself huh you got it now not just a band I'm telling you when you get up and be adopted that is the faith you see now you see what I'm contending for I will not stop that's the faith anyway what about a day huh okay may be seated God has a provider way Oh Louisville Kentucky in 1954 and now we're moving right into another great age coming for the rapture of the church and in this we live in the same in the time of restoration of the gifts that's back in Pentecost in the 50s amen and in this we live in a time the restoration he gives its tumble many of the big fine churches it sent Nazarene backwards and made fanatics I did a lot of Pentecost but just the same God's moving right on bringing in the wrapped in faith for his church that's right now watch so tonight I represent that faith the faith that was once delivered to the Saints in the way of a divine gift you got it so he had in the first a second pole and then seven angels come from the West to bring the faith the faith Jesus Christ son of man went in profit and then he led out the faith in Word form you mean I have these faith in myself in Word form yes and that's what God wants to revive by sending down the Holy Ghost do y'all understand this thing huh anybody look you had enough 35 minutes huh shall I go on hey you my boss okay praise the Lord Oh King so you got it now what the amount may be seated what the amount like how for doing his third pole with his seven seal seventh on the message Malachi for number one restored back the original faith he faith in other words restore back the resurrection faith that they had to see Jesus after he was death burial resurrection come back among them for forty days huh up here moving in and moving out praise God that's the faith Lord our resurrection faith number to introduce a messiah defame Malachi 4 st. Luke's 1730 revelation 10 1 through 7 revealing every mystery to the Brian as a reveal word in the Eagle aged 2 : age that's why the shout reveal message had to be quoted back by divine revelation as a seventh on the word see that's all you understand the quotes now had to quote back to faith as a word see a man okay to bring wine to bring the bride in New York and Pennsylvania anyway back to the word then bring down the ministry of the spirit to creating a word to the bride and that's what I'm doing it is more I'm laying a platform praise God I don't know what can happen today I don't know but I know one thing I'm laying a platform there's one standing among ya John the Baptist he wasn't even stand-in there he come the next day for there's one standing among you hey man you gotta speak by faith man doesn't matter how sick you are how tired you are how where you are preach the word by faith faith is the victory okay Amen Stephen yes sir stand there brother you saved the whole thing your fame and Lauren hey Lord blessed brother Steve there amen okay may be seated an echo had to prophesy Malachi for a seventh seal message back to the people do you understand what it what's been going on here revelation 19:10 it says the worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy the testimony of Jesus is a seven seals seven Thunder message and that is the spirit of prophecy that's been here in New York City show the king praise God they take it out of here they couldn't do it okay now the word prophecy does not mean to teach okay you may be seated number one the promise that means either tell and experience on the inspiration number two or foretells something that's fixing to take place that's very easy to do all the things that's happening here was i foretold it in the testimony of Jesus brother Bram already foretold the whole thing all our way to the new city so all that's vindicated prophecy word so revelation 10 8 to 11 prophesy again Oh open up can't give glory to God understand what this ministry is your sons and daughters shall prophesy when the Holy Spirit pour out here they're gonna prophesy it means that they shall either foretell or testify amen what you want to know is on why are we not a denomination on page 34 paragraph 170 that's where you may be seated yes sir since December 26 1965 and echo has prophesied from Malachi forst message the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy Oh hallelujah prophesy okay I think no brother Ruben finish me yes my god ahead okay what's the traction on the mountain let's think about prophecy page 8 paragraph 46 God then what was he doing what is that attraction up there on the hill is God making history and God fulfilling prophecy wasn't it prophesied in the Old Testament the prophets that Christ would come he would die and everything else prophecy it was fulfilled [Applause] God fulfilling prophecy and then always causing an attraction that's why I have all these 27 years has been a traction they don't know what's going on who is he all the critics come up I'm I'm gonna read it to you ain't man you'll see it you understand what I've been through amen pray yeah if you could only understand what the ministry is all about her own mind and that always causing attraction it brings all the critics up the vultures of this morning's message and the Eagles also they come together to find out what's going on some coming in to the thunders for curiosity some come coming to find fault others coming to criticize hallelujah there's all kinds gathered I told you that three kinds are gathered in New York PA praise God I know what they're here for but you stay with that word Psalms one ungodly and scornful mockers praise God but you stay with that word hallelujah some coming to find fault others coming to criticize there's all kinds gathered and we said this morning believers make believers and unbelievers what's on the mountain prophecy being fulfilled and I'm winding up this morning that's what I'm doing I'm lining up this seven Thunder prophecy not God in the skies it's been spoken and so shall it be page 13 I can hear John answer back another prophecy may be seated have not you ready to scripture what Daniel the prophet said the daily sacrifice will be done away and that hour has arrived have you not read what Isaiah said in the fortieth chapter the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord there's two prophecies for me and another thing did you not recognize our prophet 400 years ago Malachi when he spoke on the 3rd chapter and said behold I send my messenger before my face to prepare the way don't you know this fulfills prophecy prophecy was being fulfilled don't you know what's going on here today prophecy praise God what is going on for 27 years prophecy the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy no man could touch it no mega do anything about it they couldn't stop it they couldn't pull it out they couldn't run it out they couldn't stop it out because it's prophecy may be seated amen perhaps it being fulfilled and about that time the Prophet Turner said behold there comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world now what's the attraction it's changed from the Prophet to his prophecy it changed from John the Baptist prophets of him being a prophet and then looking at John and John speaking about behold the lamb of God there's the prophecy it changes from the prophethood of prophecy Malachi 4 left it changed from the Prophet to his prophecy don't you understand he introduced Messiah Messiah prophesied good okay amen Oh glory okay did you get it let me say Amen they come to read something to you that's why I want to know you got it you got it you got it now father let the fire fall cuz they understand what has transpired for the last 36 years of soul you understands open hey hey hey hey you may be seated now what's the attraction and maybe see it's changed from the Prophet to his prophecy page 24 and the God of heaven promised the evening time would have evening light now watch three years ago 63 7 angels this mystery was a prophecy what time is it sir but now is history is past the promise is fulfilled what time is it serves and what's this attraction God fulfilling his word three years ago was a mystery but now is history it's been fulfilled and it changed from the Prophet in 65 and went over to his prophecy and the prophecy is Jesus I'm gonna get to it you're gonna find out what's been going on with this prophecy if you have received it now I want you to notice here so everything is hidden in here notice when the light really strikes home page 19 but it shall be light now when shall it be light but it shall be light when she grows beyond organization when she gets out of a past organization and blooms out again she'll put forth oranges like she was when she went into the ground now watch when the oranges come back

you may be seated praise God [Applause] okay now okay you keep praying for me I am just about worn out I got to get this message to you so you can get sealed up otherwise you only know what to even looking for you got to have a clay understanding what you're looking for doing pretty good here now there's two things connected with the prophecy to understand one redeeming time in the time of the revelation of these things being made known let's sing okay number two claiming time by fire in the time appointed by God the time of the revelation of these things being made known is in the time of the ministry of the word you got there now the word and in there from 1966 was a revelation to make known these things the claiming time is in the time of the ministry of the spirit and that's why I'm doing I'm doing because the Spirit is this raised up but you got to know this that's why he brought you together anything that happened hallelujah oh my long as you are devout and sanctifying anything happen okay let's prove these points I don't want to linger here doing good pretty good here amen the breach 1963 page 89 so you see Jesus was God he was not no third person fourth person second person he was the person he was God he was God Emmanuel God came down from his glory revealed himself grace produced the person of Jesus Christ and we find this book God stretched his tent came from God to become a man he changed his stream from the Almighty to be a man to take on the form of man so he could die to redeem man oh wait till we see him when there's a when there's nobody worthy there it is there's a redeemer Christ has redeemed us now we are now in redeemed but he has not claimed this possession yet you might differ with that but just hold on a minute we'll see he hasn't claimed it see if he took the book of Redemption everything Adam had everything and he lost Christ redeems bang now he's already redeemed us but he hasn't took the possession yet are you understanding this though he cannot until the time appointed and then will come the resurrection and then the earth will be renewed again and then you take possession his possession which he got when he redeemed us but he would do it at the appointed time all mine this is described in this seventh seal book are we talking of now all right the book of redemption is all described in there all what Christ would do at the end will be revealed to us this week in the seven seals if God will let us see all right it'll be revealed now we got that now and we got Clementine is that correct we have that now all right and he's art now you already redeemed he's redeemed but he hasn't claimed and he cannot claim until the time appointed of God other words God has a time for the spirit to pour out because he had to send his word to go out and call him from left and right praise God Oh hallelujah glory to God he had to call you first sanctify you do don't work a Redemption in you then at the time appointed send down a spirit don't think okay page 112 may be seated he then said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also o mine he that promised these things in the last day he that said these things he theirs now in the time of the revelation of these things being made known come and dine 27 years come and dine on the thunders and you have hot bishop Jimmy Rita Rita the Holy Spirit will come upon

inspiration given to me 9 1699 we have come through 35 years plus of the Ministry of the word I read it last week and bring it back I'm winding down now did you get that see I'm trying to break it away from three phases because when you go out there on this third phase you can't tell what third feet were you talking about so you got to bring the Ministry of the word which you can prove I said what have you had the dynamics well no okay then it's the Ministry of the word okay then when you produce a dynamic this is the mercy of the Spirit you show it to UM praise God and it cannot refute it you don't have to say three phases no more because we almost there we hook here you're a three phase was a vision to me that I can see and I can speak it and keep pressing on pressing on pressing on

the seven seals this is after the seven seals when the lamb come forth acclaim is redemption what he had redeemed time was finished in and now I was he's in the work now doing the work of redemption so while under the ministry of a word he was in the work doing the work of redeeming you for let's say spirits gossiping and this and that he had somebody who was not afraid of you to tell you like it

clean what he has redeemed Oh he's redeemed you [Applause] aren't you happy to be redeemed [Applause] you got it down those two things one the work of redemption and two claiming time by fire okay oh right hit the end if he's seated let me hurry up here I didn't know how this was gonna be I said Lord what do I do I don't know and so but I know it's got to be done Psalms 47 said then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written to me Jesus Christ came in the volume of the book the word revelation 5:1 that little book of redemption and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on a throne of a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals now we come from revelation 10 1 through 4 a through 11 a seventh under revelation to an Ephesians inspiration narrow ready to come by the faith and Ephesians manifestation did you get it from a seventh under revelation to an Ephesians inspiration for nine months in L huh cold and ready to come by the faith pouring out for another Ephesians origin manifestation what's that do put you on expectation okay the book a Redemption okay let me maybe I can finish this here all right maybe I can finish it crisis the mystery of God revealed now your stamina I'm gonna just drop in here just you know nowhere to sleep on now me yeah now now you see the seals when he was in his Minotaur oh right back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him and you will be him and he will be you hey man Reuben that's right Reuben got a revelation brother see see what

dog not thank you lord oh praise God amen yes amen well he's having a time there praise God and all that's in this book will be him and you in the book for that's the believer the words in the book you are the words in the book go believe on I'm gonna drive it into you praise God when you go out of here you have faith all the way back to Ohio in the end and up to Canada my god you know who you are you know where you come from you know what purpose got puts you down in this proving again for you here to manifest the glory of God in your season in your time in your home in your state in your locale and amen rubra keep shouting man and that's the believe of the words in the book and the word is him and all that's in it he come forth you may be seated for this book of redemption whose names are written in a book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb and here he is today in his word manifests the same thing he did there she can't recognize another headship no sir no Bishop no nothing she recognizes one hand ship that's Christ and Christ is the word okay desperation may be seated see Jesus come to save those who was in the book of Redemption before the foundation of the world he only come to save those who they are I don't know see but nobody can have faith unless you say it's for whosoever it is who's ever and it is nobody can come unless God's call them that's true hallelujah and amen and the devil can impersonate this is desperation 1963 any of those things but it cannot be the Holy Ghost see he cannot impress even a person hate the gifts but he can't be the Holy Ghost and Holy Ghost is the token that the Bloods been applied because no watch watch this here because it follows the blood all the way from the book Redemption you mean the Holy Spirit you mean God himself you mean the Holy Ghost itself follows the blood from the book of redemption huh your name is in the blood section and the token follows that and every age and made sure that they come form an appalled arrhenius Martin Columba a loosely Luther Wesley now not kind for and the blood is and of token is here today to follow the blood that's in you in word seed form or real seed Oh hallelujah talk about a hallelujah talk about a shout you shouting off the word now brother yes brother praise God may be seated that was the purpose of him coming that's what he fathered in every age every age he thought let to see that is brought for and they could not be made perfect without us and now the entire Holy Spirit this is the church making God in human fresh as it did before Sodom the burning there was a time amen Oh hallelujah my god influence New York 63 now if you want your example to lay aside your pattern you see what the scripture goes together just just lay Jesus over here and go to watching him and place it in the Bible you got the whole thing come right because it's the revelation of Jesus Christ the New Testament and Oh both all stick of Jesus see Jesus the Son of God because he is this book redemption he is it and your names is in it it must be Jesus because you're not to believe what the word is the believer the word is that believed in every age if there was no word seeing you would be nothing but that word was placed in you before the foundation of the world and that is a believer that's how you could come here and believe different measures of faith sure amen but the sooner the word is of believe in you my and okay he is this book of redemption may be seated he he he was a word and he is the word that's bound to be him you see so this is the whole book of redemption which is Jesus Christ fittingly put together by God with the promises of Redemption and healing and everything for the human being do you get that now this book is Jesus Christ put together by God and he come as a human being and redeemed us and every promise is in him and for you for he is the Redeemer oh who do you say this is [Applause] [Music] my [Music] already you already okay go wake Jesus Shreveport Louisiana 63 oh my okay that last churches predestinated Church every name that was ever put on that book Jesus came to redeem and when the last name is redeemed the book is closed I'm trying to get you to understand that before that fire claiming turn my and when the last name is redeemed the book is closed and he didn't intend that no one be lost but his foreknowledge let him know who would be lost therefore he could predestinate and then their names were put on the book and then when that book of redemption is closed and sealed with seven seals why was being raked out like I told you being worked out by the mysterious powers of God and some day when the book of redemption is finished the lamb takes it and then the last name is called off of that the lamb comes down to call for what he has redeemed by a fire baptism yes sir that's his church and I believe that time is close at hand did we get it okay my very identification Tulare California 64 now there was nothing in heaven that could have done it you know John it's looked in the book there the Bible no listen to this very carefully the Holy Spirit's about blew my mind out back in April we find that he saw there was no one upon the earth that was worthy to take the book the book of Redemption and there was nobody in heaven worried that nobody it was beneath the earth nowhere was able or worthy to take the book to loose the seals or even look at it and he went because in this book was the book of redemption oh I wonder if you got it [Applause] in the book was the book of redemption you know the one that Adam had that could bring sons and daughters he fell in sin and God took it back their names that would have been spoken [Applause] Oh who do you say this is amen brother Luke the names that would have been spoken by Adam was in that pump title deed to the earth that's why John when John had the Holy Ghost a person that Apostle everything else and I was on how the pettiness but he could have come back to the iron because of the title deed was in them seven seals that's why he was shouting and screaming and when that lamb broke them seals down to our prophet and you don't know what it's all about praise God you don't know what brother Reuben was shouting about over him and he went because the in this book was a book of redemption his own name was in there and nobody was worthy and he was already had the Holy Ghost he was Apostle it did signs and wonders and miracles just correct but his name was in that book of redemption [Applause] amen Pete okay all right may be seated let me finish off here now well my John looked in the book there revelation 5:1 the Bible that's what it says revelation 5:1 says the Bible the book of redemption it was closed over there is open over here amen then the Bible is the book of redemption Jesus Christ and he wept because in this book was the book of redemption his own name was in there and nobody was worthy to even look upon the book let alone a pull his name out of there sinking I'm finished you know just about here did you now come back for you did you catch that Church in this book in the book was the book of redemption huh testimony to help you Monday April 23rd after April 22nd when the Lord told me I had to go in the pulpit now all the pain and misery everything else but what a blessing that Sunday the 22nd you know so the next day I was reading this very quote Monday I was as I was just this is my testimony as I was reading this quote in an identification to Larry speaking about John and he went because in this book was the book of redemption this his own name was in there and nobody was worthy the Holy Spirit revealed the following revelation to me revelation 10 8 through 11 the book of redemption with the names in the book in the blood section of the book of life was transferred from revelation 10 8 through 11 to ephesians 4 11 through 13 to the five for mercy the week of September 10 through the 17th last year okay so on the 22nd was give us see now but the Fergus is not here brother Fergus inspiration he asked the angel for the he got it on that Wednesday for the book the angel continued up into the pulpit maybe he went to in the pulpit was one angel to dress in black and this one had a white that's the mark an angel that's marking here I mean that's this is the one with a death just one here for life and that's been going on in New York City all these years I hope you understand what I'm saying it just goes right on because they missed their day of visitation and God never says nothing they just go right on they walk out and they're gone whether they missed it their visitation you see it was very plain so that third agent was the one in revelation 10 yeah the wings here at the book and brother Ferguson ran after him and asked for the book he wouldn't give it to him he came up in the pulpit correct and come up behind me and stepped into my 16 elements is that correct and my Bible was sitting there and the angel took the book of redemption and he put it in there [Applause] right that was well the Ferguson's experience amen okay may be seated I'm almost finished here I'm trying to get right here okay he asked angel for the book the ancient continuing up into the pulpit we stepped into me and passed place the book that was in his hand right into my Bible it was laying on the pulp on the top of the pulpit then I understood that the book of redemption in the Angels hand was the names in the prize in the book of Redemption April 22nd the book of redemption of the bride's names was placed in my Bible and now when I preach the word the name is in the word and the five fullness it will call out a bride by the word revealed by Malachi 4 and now placed in the spoken word along with the names from the book of redemption revelation 10 and 1 through 4 8 through 11 this will be back to the
