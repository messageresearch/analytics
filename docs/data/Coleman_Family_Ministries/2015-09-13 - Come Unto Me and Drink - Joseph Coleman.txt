bring on the seven Thunders it started June 20th 1973 it was the inspiration to slay the intellectual conception of the message and it was on a message ask what you will I was praying for my wife's ey remember the old many of the old times remember the message and it was a prophecy that broke in and it uh was predicting what has happened the spirit of the Lord dropping down and uh uh that night there were several situations and circumstances surrounding the church number one was praying for my wife's uh the disease in the eye glucoma and of course the eye is blind which would take a miracle to open it so if you understand I'm praying for that disease that's there because it's behind the eyes she can go uh uh it could go into the brain any time so sister k h on all these years and she gets these attacks and still still there but she's trusting God Amen then I just said spirit I didn't say nobody's name amen but number three uh on this I'm going play the tape for you a little bit of it uh on the inspiration I said the seven Thunders is in me amen and on the inspiration said there'll become for a fivefold Ministry it'll come forth in the Dynamics and and they'll go after the Lost then there was the prophecy itself which which was in two parts and so which I didn't know it was two parts until about three years ago so about 15 minutes or so you can hear the inspiration when it dropped down cuz the night is finished amen there's a new season is here a new time so may the Lord bless you as maybe open your understanding tonight to know uh I had a standing as every Spirit alone with the Revelation no vision cuz the word is greater than the vision no feeling cuz the great anointing didn't come until 1975 but I had to stand on the word amen God said so God said so and you got to stand the same way tonight if you're ever going to go into Rapture Lord bless you brother BR said check your vision with the word he said no he said check the voice with the word that voice said

Ministry speaking to the last Church age to call the bride to the resurrection that she might escape the lay out of seaing church now this leene church is a church spirit that covers many individuals in the message Same Spirit but individual people in the message and therefore there's a call by fire forall Ministry the very ones that they rejected will be sent to call them out otherwise they won Happ in Tribulation Amen in St Matthew 12 uh the parable says there the word of God says then make the the tree good and his fruit good that's Matthew 12 33-37 I just paraphrase it to you make the tree good and his fruit good and after having a good tree the next thing to expect is good fruit amen from that tree the good fruit follows as a result of the tree being made good he said make your tree good you catch me you are the tree or make your tree good how can you make your tree good strive with all within you to stay in the life that you might be fruit bearing it's a press it's an overcoming then the tree Christian is made good by the New Birth the Tree of Life the new bir comes into your tree amen you a tree and a new birth the Tree of Life comes into your soul and that makes the tree good amen the Tree of Life the new birth is Born Into You to make you a good tree because the Harvest is here and every tree my heavenly father has not planted shall be rooted up so make that tree good tonight the last call amen then after you make the tree good make the fruit good after adding the Sevenfold nature of God to that because to that new birth in you add the Sevenfold nature of God which is a person of Jesus Christ and he'll come then charity will come upon you in the true baptism to make the good tree bear good fruit ninefold fruit amen you understand now the good tree is a new birth and the new birth is number eight a new creation a holy convocation and the good fruit number nine ninefold fruit and as number nine follows number eight so the good fruit follows as a result of a new birth so tonight May there come forth tonight from this audience fruits meet unto repentance may they come a group out of here tonight may they come a group out of here to commemorate
