TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now subject tonight is Wil thou be made whole amen this was an invitation asked about 2,000 years ago by Jesus to the this lame man here as he walked upon on him now note the difference here in St John 56 he's asking a question W Thou made whole he's asking a question of Faith now he's saying do you really want to be made whole to this lame man now he's speaking about a a resurrection power to make him whole now there was potent folk laying here waiting for healing because because for their bodies and their souls they were weak and sickly and also helpless and they were blind and halt other words because lame had to stop and then sit down rest and then get up and walk again and they were with it paralyzed or shrunk and so forth and they were waiting for the moving of the water and God had always sent a a an angel down to move the water and when the angel dipped in and moved that water they could step in there and they could be healed and and God has done the same thing through the seven Church ages he sent angels to move the water amen arenus and polycarp and St Martin they moved the water and those who stepped in they were healed spiritually and also physically amen and God sent a seventh angel to a lame Hulk blind miserable with it paralyzed church and that seventh angel move the water and praise God uh we come down there a little lame amen not necessarily uh because as worse off as a as many people but we came anyway so what was it it was the heavenly father sending the word in perfect obedience to get one predestinated seed that's all it was and here he comes on down there to this sheep gate and so now the angel come at a certain season and and whosoever first after the water was troubled stepped in he was made whole you had to step into it now you had to get in the water see amen you had to get in the word not half out and half in get in amen see don't hang outside hang inside but get in the word praise the Lord see now um as the word as the word approaches the man in perfect Obedience of the father and the helpless man he says to him wil thou be made whole and the helpless man said I have no man to put me in I'm not strong enough always got some excuse you follow me now it wasn't because too much wrong with him brother BR said because he may have because he may have had a prostrate or something see now but God sent Jesus to him nevertheless he was predestinated he was the one amen praise God you are the ones you're the ones I don't care what you feel like but you're the ones amen it's you it's nobody else if if if they if it was them they would they would be here tonight and you'd be outside so therefore the fact that you're here you must be the one amen I mean God knows what he's doing doesn't he I mean he wouldn't get the wrong one he knows who you are praise the Lord Brother have some faith and believe in what you're talking about glory to God Amen so many were worse off you were the one Tony he wouldn't got you and brought you in here at the End Amen you and your family praise the Lord so now this lame man I don't care if he was lame and coming there he been coming about 30 years he been dragging he know that there was something there and he would drag his way down there and I can picture him coming down to Beth Sada it was the Gate of mercy and Harry comes down there for some mercy cuz he knows that something's going to happen if he can only get there and he would get there praise God and even if it was 38 years I feel that because he was an elected seed of God there was something in the control room amen there was something inside saying go on down there this is the day so therefore no doubt he purpose in his heart one day amen no doubt he said over and over one day I'll get there I haven't been able to get there for 38 years but one day I will get there so I don't care if you haven't attained that stature that you want one day you will get there amen when you get this purpose in your heart one day I will overcome one day I'll do the things I want to do to please you this man didn't stop one year 2 years 10 years 15 years 20 years 38 years he laid in that condition but one day praise God he had something in his heart pressing on pressing on pressing on one day something is going to happen pray with faith like that God knew his faith he kept coming he kept coming he kept coming well keep on coming don't stay home praise God keep coming tonight he may fill you with the Holy Ghost or Sunday or next Wednesday but one day he's going to fill you with the Holy Ghost one day he's going to heal you and you're stronger than what you was when you first believed it amen praise God he believed that he would be made whole and he didn't stagger through unbelief he was Str giving praise to God Amen so praise God tonight that Mercy pool may be in your seat in your heart tonight Jesus can come to your pool in your seat in your home on your job on the subway the bus wherever you are he can come to your pool but just believe one day he will come to your personal pool amen praise the Lord he's coming for the elected one oh tonight saints of God I don't care what condition you are in tonight it makes no difference to God he's able to come to your pool of at Beth Sor amen praise God many time maybe many services here you didn't step in the water when the angel troubled the water here maybe others got anointing next to you we'll come back the next time that's all right get in amen the water is moving tonight if you don't get in tonight get in Sunday night Sunday morning
