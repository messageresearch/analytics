TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so now this morning would you turn with me to the Word of God we always love to turn to his word st. Luke the second chapter the 25th verse want to read down through that the 35th verse you write it down I'm wanna I want to read from second Corinthians the fourth chapter the 13th verse through the 18th verse reading from st. Luke 2nd chapter 25th verse and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon it and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took him up in his arms and blessed God and said Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to that word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared other words made already before the face of all people a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel and Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him and Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and the rising of again of many in Israel and for sign which shall be spoken against now this is a private to Mary here EA a sword shall pierce through that old so also and this rest of the follows of what he said about a sign shall be spoken against science shall be spoken against that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed ii corinthians for the thirteenth verse we we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believe and therefore have i spoken we also believe in therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but through our outward man but though out the man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the thing which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal they got a blessing to read on this word I like the title just a little thought spirit of faith for we find here a pole in a thirteenth verse saying we have in the same spirit of faith a corner is written I believe and therefore have I spoken we also believe therefore speak so it is very dry let's bow our heads again Heavenly Father God we're can only open the book the Lord we feel thy sweet presence here this morning movin up on the word and now God maybe you just come down and Lord and take this word out to that people Lord well we are nothing Lord we are thy children and perchance this morning the Holy Spirit has just single out me Lord to stand here God to bring forth these words tonight people but follow me the people hear the words and believe the words of God that you might all God be implanted in their souls and our souls together Lord that we might arise in the rapture well we are waiting for it it has been spoken so shall it be we asked it in Jesus Christ statement for his glory amen so now this morning my message is about the spirit of faith and Paul speaking here I'm trying to let the Holy Spirit tie-in Simeon with the words that Paul spoke over here tied in together and the spirit of faith ties it in together and now we know that the many great tremendous messages preached on faith and but we cannot because preach it enough think because faith is what we have to have for if we don't have faith it is impossible to please God we must come to God believing that he is in all things outside of it means nothing is just temporal it's just going to because pass away so therefore faith as we've heard many definitions of it we understand that it is the revelation of the will of God it is what some supernatural on-scene force by a choice by grace perchance would reveal to our hearts a certain something a certain message his thoughts comes into our hearts by spirit and the spirit Paul calls it the spirit of faith amen then others they don't see what has been revealed to you you know it you can't explain it it's hard to express it but you just do it hey man because our supernatural unseen man reveals it to you and the others around buddy won't know what makes it tick I mean how do you know that you know I just know I know I can't explain it there's just something that's there what is it the spirit of face setting up on you same Edward because Simeon they disappear if they set up on him rested up on him can't see it see but it's there amen so we see faith means putting our full confidence in the things that we hope for in it all right just put all our trust our belief our confidence and whatever are we hoping for we're hoping for a resurrection and also rapture amen because of because fine heritance well then this then faith is the full confidence then confidence is substance amen that is the substance of things hoped for that right it means faith means to be certain of the things that we cannot see then right we are certain then certain means to have evidence of things not seen we have the evidence we are certain we don't see it but we got it where is unseen there's supernatural is hanging right there amen yes sir and then see this supernatural unseen faith God uses that to water every seat Amen by Adam with a seat in God's garden and as long as he believed what God said by the spirit of faith rested upon him and that spirit of faith wanted Adam day by day he was a seed in the garden being ordered by faith amen and in the will of God was the was the revelation of God's will and God's Will was don't touch the tree of knowledge of good and evil as long as he didn't touch it he was being worried by the faith not to touch it amen he kept all milk in and God kept on blessing amen we all understand the story how because Eve she went she got away from the spirit of faith and she went out for knowledge for a new way to do it faith was too simple because we Eve that was silly just because don't touch it that'll mean nothing but God spoke it it meant something it meant life and death eternity that's what it meant but it was too simple and every message is always simple and so we see there that God water nor by faith is that right faith was the will of God so therefore one day God's will picked out nor nor being warned the co Hebrews says of things not seen that right he was warned of things not seen and then when he was warned God said it a supernatural God spoken said it's going to rain on there he does see the rain it never had rain before but he had confidence he was certain that it was going to rain for God said it amen so therefore when he was certain when the spirit of faith arrested there he moved there amen and every child of God right now is moving with fear for this certain that God has come down goddess and their cars positive indicators word yes sir Gaza has probably let it be done we are going to be in a resurrection Helen we're going to be in the rapture this has been spoken it's supernatural I feel it I'm confident that's gonna be amen what is it is a spirit of faith that you can't see but it's there nevertheless amen so no move with fear to the saving of his house by the which which what the faith this Ark that he believed that condemned the world and the Ark is a type of Jesus Christ the Word of God hey man praise be to God yes sir Abraham was told to go out into the land he had never been before and he would receive an inheritance is that right he's soldiering out there looking for a city out there Amen he had seen a vision of a sparrow feet rested up on him he kept looking for he fell down he got up but he stayed with the word giving praise to God yes sir he stayed with that word he's sojourned it was only a little short while temporarily we only sojourning here now with passing through this muck and mire God is just bring us right off there yeah we're not going to stay here we come amen let the redeemed say so is that right friend speak it out speaks it our faith speaks it out praise be talca amen so he's tagging now he was strong giving praise to come yes sir what was his sacred there's always a sacred his secret was that he looked for a city there's a secret a man which had foundations whose builder and maker was God all the way he looked for he was expecting something amen expectation can get some by which a resurrection expecting a pail got to fall out expecting a rapture expecting for Christ to come and maracle his word [Applause] he moves in difference yes sir and so therefore because Abraham was there expecting waiting expecting like a woman is waiting with an expectant child to come forth she's waiting and she's wished she'd know was gonna be what is there she feels every day every night she's waiting she's expecting a child to come for more than there's a seat of God in the back is there for God has spoken it he must speak it by the seat of the way first first is the seat of the way you don't see that then to see the word before you can have the real seat the see the word must be spoken supernaturally first it's out there then when you believe it then the sphere of the word begins to roll and shake the word of God the word the word was freeing my thing which is not seen which is the wire to see the car got stuck it don't see it out there but it's there well he said is there Amen praise God that right friends yes sir all of these old heroes of faith pinnacle / Hebrews 11 they all died into faith amen not heaven received these promises but they saw a fire amen then look the eyes with an order when I say the words head so straight ahead just like a horse head Brides on the side it couldn't see the lip normally it looks straight in here amen they were thoroughbred horses amen straight ahead they saw the promises we passed across this song by feet this song it's like Joe say I know my redeemer living no matter what happened to this flesh no matter what my wife says the church says well this is what I know I know I shall raise one day I know he lives yes he did and invite a quickening spirit in a mill kensic body with our creeks two souls in prison it says here I am Joe but Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the other patriarch is Ruth also we have it all over here I am you believed on me Peter turning up on high amen well they believe the promises of God they embrace the Word of God they embraced it Pyrus have soul we must embrace you care see if they embrace it friends are small gods noah's ark the ark was a sign that the judgment was coming yes they saw the ark with the eyes that right and then left and this content and they mocked it what was it Christ and type they left Jesus for Simeon front side and he'll be a sign a standard that they reject his coffin in type and also reality and they did it but their art was a sin that Ark was the sign of this judgment coming up to that right friends therefore that Ark was the evidence of faith that know ahead he built it in their loss tell my friends what today merica for Saint Luke 17 30 really should tell what the said is this evidence yeah you don't see it what is Christ you see me now supernatural is there it is the evidence of things not seen and today they laugh at it and they market and they scoff at it it is Jesus Christ Himself come down on earth with people's spirit move it up on earth one more time and he's now calling out a bride [Music] curl them out of talking because Cales down here praise God so what happened the old the old heroes was certain of the thing which they could not sing that certain of it praise God they had covered this and what they were hoping for that right friends they embraced these promises we must believe that God is the faith in God's Word creates an atmosphere and then God can move into that atmosphere amen now when you expect anything see just like John he come on the scene preach like a mighty power then write such a powerful preaching such a powerful faith there's once telling me he wasn't even in yet but he's telling among you there's one standing behold the lamb of God amen he was so positive he would be there and he just pushed it and he was there and we do the same and and so great such a peril that he put in their hearts it was great expectation was he the Christ was he because one of these prophets of what was it but the thing was the message created expectation and then a little humble Christ walked on the city what is people praise be to Allah and it'll be the same way in the resurrection so Grizz our expectation a little lamb will come on the scene once again amen praise be to our gun and catches waiting bright away way from all this muck down here that's what I'm looking for that's what I'm a kid on that Living Word of God made manifest yes sir so expectation looking forward to the promises embracing them praise God so we see now that guards are planting the word from Genesis clean through the book of Revelation in our spiritual wounds the word is coming in through the wound America coming down into the heart and their card sends the spiritual faith into that heart and if spiritual faith holds that promise and don't let it go it's cut it hey man I started yet put it right there any other say well what are you so happy about why are you four excited yeah praise be to our God peps what is going on right now fritz let the promise of God coming how does God transform he plants the seed first and then sends the Spirit of God to transform it there's a life in the seat and there's a life of the Spirit and when the life in the spirit meets the life in the seat something happens transformation my eyes are renewed praise God we should be expecting this morning we should come back here and I looking for God the plot itself here looking for Christ looking for Jesus walking not looking down but looking up for our Redemption draweth now tell you was expecting he knew that God was able for he heard about Joel Vanel he knew the Word of God he was able to deliver from any affliction from anything any trouble any distress car could deliver and Daniel was looking for him he prayed all night long prayer and really in there today I even so come Lord Jesus and one like the son of God come down in there there it was the safety Hebrew boys was expecting they didn't even care if they would even care that matter not crowds able to raise him they didn't even care if he gave him a chance see me now because he gave him a chance if they was resurrected then they had the same trouble but they look for a better resurrection ami look for a better life than whatever was there for kills cut our heads off heads off they watch into that depth they look for a better resolution to a life eternal clarified pie hey man praise God you have to expect friends Josh away met God and God said it march around the city and expect those walls to fall down so he began to march the first day the second day the third the fourth the third in the seventh but he was expecting them amen and in god season god's ten the walls coming amen so it'll show that the word stands the word shall not be shaken shall not pass away Amen praise God one day at the gate called beautiful capito and John full of the spirit of faith Holy Ghost resting up on him the prophetic vision restored to the brown head and they were they were walking down and they could just move and the Holy Spirit a voice spoke and say yes Lord go over there over there it was the unseen go to the gate called beautiful over there a lay man leave from his birthday laying out there asking for alms all right spoke to them Peter passing his eyes we've seen God's prophets fast his eyes on somebody right brother there was God hanging back there they fastened the eyes up on him and it is said look on us that right look on us the man gave heed expecting the word says to receive something and they received some for his mental faith was stirred yeah amen when he heard what was going on he was turn amen and in that mental faith was in the right channel and when the mental faith was expecting a seat the coming to his room you found in our friends spiritual faith hurt you strip invited and it stand up on your legs on your feet so we go home such as I have Reza in the name of Jesus Christ and the lame man stood up and he walked away okay praise the God what he was expecting there was a secret what are we doing are we expecting something today friends are we expecting Jesus Christ are we looking for are you looking for watermelon you may get a pumpkin if you're looking for Christ you'll get Christ amen amen for God was sinless if you believed his promise and have the right mental attitude toward the premise more than likely you shall receive the prompt because God says so amen see now Simeon he was led by the Spirit of God now see the word seed is there first see God speaks it first in the real seat is formed by the spirit of the word it forms it out see he made the world's out of things not seen he speaks these things into existence friends yes sir now he plants his seed he throws his spirit on the word see and then to bring forth his product now because example 1933 a pillar of fire swept down into on the banks of the Ohio River there a humble prophet was there baptizing the seventeenth person above because three or four thousand people standing because there by the shores then right all of a sudden on a hot June day Brasi the pillar of fire angel the Lord swung down and a voice spoke and planted a seed and where Bram's heart he heard the voice just like Paul he alone heard the voice they heard a sound of thunder right but he heard the voice audible words it was spoken to him then he took that seat of planet in his heart and faith in what that voice said water William Brennan seat or you found new friends the horse said Malecha for as john the baptists forerun the first coming so shall your mess go around the world in form of my second coming he believed that he embraced that spoken by an angel of war he receive it into his heart then the spirit of faith in his heart water deceit day by Dan yeah took him through all kind of Charles of tribulations getting his family everything false christs against him fast everything against him but what happened they were the spirit of faith there was water in the sea he staggered not at God's promise he was trying given praise to yo you found mean our friends the more trouble comes the more de-stresses Paul says over here for all of these things is for us do you mean now that God might give us His grace so therefore the grace comes when we have trouble then when the the grace comes we praise God then more Thanksgiving a praise go up to God you found in them if if you in trouble and also you in trouble there's more trouble more grace more grace more praise people amen as this message comes down trouble comes right away grace comes after spreads around the world trouble grace praise Amen it comes right down the line amen is cut the conference great grace poet because PA said shall be revealed to you at the end time hope for this grace it has been revealed to us here in the end time is that right friends yes sir pasta for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving a mini redound to the glory of God so therefore all these little troubles we have these light of frictions we have is for us see let me now then he can give you his grace and your weakness he is your strength when we're weak in the world and the outward man is perishing can't do anything that in with men that Christ on the inside is strengthened water day by day is renewed day by there by faith in the way no matter what happens you go through the Word of God because you put on a tape and so forth and there you hear something said that's it so what happens the inward man swatters the outward man is perishing away he can't do it he falls faint faint means at that your spirit because passes out all right but we have not been given a spirit of fear yeah put a spirit of power it was hell man a spirit of faith when unnatural spirits Minds giving to everything on here I can't do it no more something holes in the heart absolutely hos on to the Word of God but by the spirit of faith it holds right there to the word amen he said none shall be plucked from my hands it's the unseen string tire wrapped around you you can't go he's got your hook you can't go you can't see he's got it there got your heart jumped around your neck aiming you up to Christ the Word of God amen great is that right friends yes sir so therefore indeed all of these things are ordered for us that he might give us more grace then thank God for your trial counted joy when you fall into divers temptations for earlier troubles are your chance glory outweighs all of them at the end of it amen praise God Jesus said I'll never leave you our never forsake you so that we might boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man can do I don't care what they say against it the Bible Simeon prophesied that they would speak against a sign and then not talking against you their tongue against that pillar of fire hey amen let's turn it standard that spirit of faith raised it up to look him in the face and speak the Word of God holy and therefore they look past and looking at that in the heart did they don't see that that's a spirit of faith in their right they don't understand it but you pray for them you don't faint when they look at hard looks and get in got a spirit of faith and hanging in there I can't faint faints not as strong just praise to God amen spirit of crisis in there is Howard made he waste away praise be to God no matter what happens friends so Paul tells us this light affliction that's all it is just a light affliction slight because this dress is just gonna pass a way to solve this thing all our troubles are short-lived they are short-lived troubles we understand now therefore Paul says here because our eyes is fixed on the things not seen Sudheer now it's fixed there then it does not look at the things seen all these things happening around here that we don't look at that we look pacifier and we embraced a parameter that is coming to us you're finding our friends therefore we have the same spirit of faith hid because David had open sound 116 he said I have believed and therefore have I spoken and Paul is saying right here in 2nd Corinthians 4 that we believe also and we speak you must say it say you speak it out and when you say it you create an atmosphere right now the word is being spoken by a spirit of faith and an atmosphere is here now any devil would walk in ahead now he would be challenged by the Almighty he cannot stand in the presence of Almighty God he have to go what is sickness whatever it is they don't have to go in a spirit of faith atmosphere right amen and then that word can go out the store can pierce right on out praise be to God amen but if a Paul knew that the spirit of faith has been because of deal to us we know that we are the bride because it because humble not puffed up we are the bride by faith in it because the Spirit says coming up bride says come but they say the same thing and the Spirit come down through Malachi 4 and spoke all these wonderful things we embrace them in our hearts we don't understand them all but we embrace them and we save what is said for is in the Bible amen praise God so now we are are expecting Christ to come on the scene the right frames can we say Amen we are because we are hoping that he will come and take us away from here and that's one for you're looking for your promise see now faith is unseen force see power but faith has been restored army is here see how you can't see it that this evidence is here this curve is hit from Malachi force pocket what is unseen what is there nevertheless now faith has been restored just spirit of faith this prophetic vision that was see love according to Daniel where the word would come by vision pop out right before you you found in our friends the prophetic vision has been restored sixth vision opened the six seals then the word came to William Branham by a vision and any what he saw he spoke by faith amen so now that it has been restored back now the great Holy Ghost with this word coming into your hearts are you feeding on the word the right mental attitude in the right channel the words coming through the wound into the heart spirit of faith at war deceit a part day amen yes sir Derek moves down now to that he'll which we are all looking for then that Great Spirit of Christ kill a fire the voice can rest up on you and then break out the word in what you see you speak it just like those apostles did they saw what they saw they spoke and it was direct inspiration yeah direct inspiration that will smash every sect every thought every man's idea brother you let jesus christ almighty come down in here and rest in his pulpit here and speak directly what's in the heart what expose it out they can't say anything that is surely the Lord God is in on this amen they'll help L said so they have to scream it cry out when the spirit of prophecy rest in your mess well first it was the tongues up in the upper room the term spoke but it was pious prophetic message that connected them that convinced him it was the word spoken directly it was Stephen speaking of Stephen Christ speaking directly by inspiration from God there was never a more perfect message word by word in the Greek than with Stephen spoke when it was Christ their voice uses vocal cords speaking out convicted in a heart and that is coming again God's prophet says what the Bible says it will come and purge out the church yes freeze I'm waiting for I'm looking for it I'm looking for it from it's gonna be just write a fiction here this is nothing praise pizza hot dog it just spirits coming against the word beggar foot I don't mean nothing there see I see that that don't mean anything but what's unseen the promises mean something to me I don't care what they say what they do well what he says counts to me he is no respecter of person hey hey man what God says that God will do and he'll use whomsoever he will do it you don't need man's ideas glory to come that's what I believe that's what I'm looking for that's spirit of prophecy that pill of fire as the Lord descends he sends down the Shelf the pillow fire he sends down the voice pillow fire sends it down of more powerful anointing when that press comes down watch the head pull in yes and his voice coming here now friends don't you know that Eve in the Garden of Eden also Adam as long as they walk with that spirit of anointing upon them on their merits that day with them knives was failed by the God's Holy Ghost they didn't know that they was naked they didn't know it why for our lack was over their merit a lot was over what there was a very old imagination conscience action could imagine anything they couldn't reason anything as a bail hanging over there and he has the same hair for the back he said there will follow your reason all of your imagination one of your affection part of everything and then the Spirit of Christ will take the word that you have receive in the heart now receive the word let God panting your heart that spirit of Christ was top of your minds rock out the world you see nothing but Jesus Christ and then take the way that he's spoken to merica for and speak on my air water every promise [Applause] he'll plant the seed of the word from Genesis clean through revelation he didn't say anything else then heal the spirit of faith with water every seat there's a time of life friends the seed comes in takes nine months you understand that next audience was a time of life for God also in spiritual he plans to see the seed must grow we're honest growing the woman knows is there a men for a form is there and you taking shape now there's a form of Christ in your midst no the birth pace is coming yes for the prophet brings on the birth page with a message to quicken quicken the body amen he brings a non-french therefore the life of the Spirit which is coming meets the life of the seat to produce every seat of his own kind amen and faith is the evidence is the substance malacara for is the evidence I saw it it wasn't known a chiral thing either it was something spiritual and real you probably know it was the unseen Word of God that's what he spoke about but they want something else it comes not with observation so say it the word Amen praise God the ark said that the flood was coming it's assigned to the malachi aforesaid it is judgment coming jesus is coming he said it now we wait for it and they were put into the ark by God and he shut the door all right inside with all those animals and smells and sounds mama it must have been something in there for seven days that's right but they had patience they waited amen any birth these because surroundings is not pleasant alright so God is having a birth here so the surroundings won't be because pleasant to the eye you found me friends now this would be sin and that a half and this one that's all right it'll be unpleasant but there's a birth coming for me somebody's going to be here amen and by faith we stay so it's us even so come Lord Jesus praise God it's a sign we've seen the sign amen now because in closing the sign has always mocked laughed at because belittled and see excuse me why is it always criticized mocked and laughed at and a brother brahmanna tape : time advantage Liberty said that those who carry the entire message will be called crazy it's on the tape 1962 endtime evangelism those who believe and carry the entire message will be called absolutely crazy that's right because you're out of your mind you don't say things that they want to hear you say what he said and as they called you creating what that does doesn't mean that they say but he spoke it let it be done I don't want to stand it but it's going to be praise be to our God yes I'm out of my mind I'll worship God in a way call here just like Paul saw say it the word Amen now cost D Connell man he wants a new cart see he wants because be suboxone tube because carry the car that's the corner believer won't change a little bit see so what God said is to be carried on the

king son I don't have to bow down like that here though you slay me though you flogged me the way you don't even feed me I'm still a king son what happens what I'm a king sir yes sir and I'm bearing a message look for the messages coming through the shout is on and I'm shouting the message where are you doing it cuz he told me to do it the spare of faith is it to anoint it yes sir what makes you so different I'm the King son I'm expecting him to come yes sir I'll have birth pains now the Prophet blow on the birth pains yes it is sharp Amen praise God the seed has been planted its nourished by faith during the time of light are you following me now this is the waiting period frames the expectation period and every woman knows that she's expecting a mass cha so we are expecting expectation

every black may may be ugly name what you got Jesus amen praise be to Allah he was expecting see now um God plan because in closing here God planted a seed in simians heart he was a just and devout man because he was waiting for expecting the constellation they comfort the restoration of Israel and right he was expecting them then he had a right mental attitude see the right mental attitude mental faith because first is your mental faith first because you hear and men of faith turns to it see and then God sends down the spiritual faith in Nexen hi that's the way it goes see but first you must hear and mental fate catches that deer what is that see and if it's a a true sound you know what it is it's a certain sound and if something happens to you amen and you're never the same no more Amen for spiritual faith that's called elemental faith yes sir so he was expecting see for God had told him that he would not see death till he would see the Lord's Christ then he read the word Isaiah 9:6 unto us Judith a son is given child is born shall be called wonderful counselor if Emmanuel Simeon knew that he read it every day then the Holy Ghost spirit of faith set up on her one day and say you personally not the rest of you personally shall not taste death until you at your eyes see the Lord's Christ amen that promise was in his heart he couldn't tell him look I'm gonna see because anything Amen cuz they wouldn't believe right and right but then he he was blameless see now he was not still this see but for his sins he offered the prescribed sacrifice amen and we blame his also justified then if we sin we offer the prescribed sacrifice the blood he offered it so he knew he was standing at because he had a promise and God's Holy Ghost revealed to him that this promise and it was according to the Word of God he had to seat his friends now you can see he was really expecting then when the season in a time come see that in his heart he was waiting looking for it then before he could find it for the Bible says the Spirit of the Lord let him Amen the Spirit of the Lord let him he couldn't find it himself go all of those babies in there all right the whole lot of babies in here but the Spirit of the Lord let him not this one not this one here this one this one over here hey walking no no no no right here yes here it is picked up the baby this is and also because prophesied out there and spoke those words up tonight amen now notice now see as God the spear Christ let him to the right baby amen soul will the spirit of faith today lead us pass all other false christs and right to the right children and will lead us straight to the Christ the word for it has been spoken to your heart it has been revealed by the Holy Ghost and a spirit faded in your heart now and you could walk right past a false crisis and when you meet a true Christ this is a man just you can't explain how can you explain that never you just know that a man so therefore by the spirit we move led by the spirit amen 4 therefore God will lead us all so friends now because notice how do you know unseen force now he prophesied that Jesus Christ would be a light to the Gentiles all right for revelation to the Gentiles to reveal these hidden things to them and a glory to Israel now he blessed Mary and Joseph and said to Mary he said that this child is destined to make many fall and many rise in Israel and a sign which shall be spoken against this child shall set up a stand he'll be a standard see which many shall attack a stone of stumbling they shall reject it see and he was prophesying here see and he says for he will expose the secrets thoughts of many hearts in other words when this word comes into your midst it's a siren it's a standard that it will expose the thoughts in somebody's hearts in the midst read this word is spoken by you follow me our friends now he told Mary awful because her very soul would be pierced she would be in anguish when she would see the Sun up on the cross and she will her heart was the Pierce cousin John 1925 my heart was Pierce but what was it it was a sign a standard to be rejected he was because rejected but God over knives there 50 said gave him the tongue of the learned he know how to speak a word to the D weary in season and here we are weary he's come down with the tongue of the learn the words of god of wisdom and opened our hearts we were weary and finish it all and sent us down the spirit of faith amen praise God he gave us back to the spider's and his cheek to those who because pluck out the beers he hid his face not from those who spit at him and smote him he denied his facing so therefore he was despised and rejected now but he set his face like flint for the course that his father laid out before in amen and so he could say I have finished the course I have kept the faith I have fought a good fight amen Paul said that every true sir know Christ was able to say that but knows it was the course that he laid out there is the way of the Cross there is deed because work of the Cross all of us except the cross is work in our hearts but that cross lays out a way for us that is despised rejected amen and you will walk that straight line there if you will walk in the way of the cross that's all it is friends because rejection said because we know it so we see then that why were they all persecuted because it was a sign of standeth that had to be spoken against so when you stay with the message today they speak against not you the sign in you I see that must be spoken against is the less it's just straight and true see so therefore there must be heresies among you here and all around a brother say what is this know is that the heresies must be their souls that all hang on by the spirit of faith amen the genuine one those who are proved those we came down from glory fear they might be made manifest you might see them and you won't be dry so well this truly is the Word of God something tells me that no matter what they say it'll be here you missed right here and many others around you will say all kind of heresies but it won't ring true there'd be many trumpets but it won't ring true amen so therefore Peter said over here and first Peter 3 I believe is before what glory is it when he be buffeted because for your faults and you take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable unto God see when it's not your fault and it speak against you say all kind of things against you if you take that because patiently that's what God that's all he receives back for Christ suffered and each of them amen but we shall also reign with them praise be to our God so therefore all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution there's no other way around for peace that we are because here until all we call to be suffering because for Christ now in closing now friends we know that God has given us a great message because the bear now that's women and men see the message is in woman and man say not this ministers see for you live the message there's the message see it's in your heart and you live what was spoken by God and you like Mary because you worship Him at the feet and you won't be because coming about serving the tables and so forth see but Mary knew D because she has desired the because better things see so those who because truly worship the Lord is your ship the word see and you stay at the feet of Jesus now true many people talk against you they don't understand you that's all right see that's good for you because the only molds you and shape see them in now for the word if you say well why is that law the word yeah all they lived God Christ shall suffer persecution there's the word don't spit it out receive it in the heart amen and they got a communist that's the will of God then by faith you receive as well and you keep moving see and it is spirit of faith anoint you now we know because it because here in the natural all famous pictures before they can be home in a Hall of Fame they have to go through the Hall of critics first amen now you see where I'm going right they at pictures must go through the Hall of critics windows critics finish walking up and down and sizing up this way that way across the nose this way the head is that way this is this way that's that we're critics cinema now when it goes through that see if it passes that then it can be home amen and a Hall of Fame all right well I believe God Himself one day soon is going to take you his bride that's right now you all know what is happening now brother Coleman I'll tell you what God says you're passing through the Hall of critics that's right on every scientist speak up mother father sister brother who is your friend is your mother your father Jesus Christ heat up do it the will of God hey man so we are now right now March the 3rd 68 passing through the Hall of critics how do I know brother Coleman just stand around and just because I pick up your phone you hear get on the phone and begin to criticize then you know you're passing through the Hall of critics who is it anybody says that speaks against for love shall cover multitude of sins the brothers wrong so forth love will cover that but is God with it don't look at that criticize what that must be the Lord since the picture must pass through that right friends Amen because it's a sign to be rejected and therefore the bride must be called every ugly name every black in name every kind of crazy thing must be called and we look for it Amen for they call it to Jesus calling Beelzebub call Paul crazy call brother brand all kind of false prophets and everything else and I'm dung in the mail we look for it what is it the critics is having a field day Shem is kicking dirt on David and it's that sir that shall I cut off that dog's head the age of the Lord he said let him alone God has bitten him to kick dirt on me before I'm passing through but I'm coming back one day in power manifests so now Lord let me pass through the horrible critics I don't care what they say on the phones up in there around or whatever it is last night we just found out that when we built the church here because fix it over we've built a golden altar it have Bulls up here the sacrifice last night on the phone we just told that we've built we fix it over and put a goalless on they go an altar right here and we're sacrificing the New York bulls and goats and people work to believe that have an itching ears want to hear something nice so therefore I say let it come praise be to God for we're passing through a hole of critics glory to God how do you got this morning yes siree one bright in early morning praise be to God Jesus shall appear and take the other pictures the former in picture early church the lutheran picture the leslie pictured those 1906 because Pentecostal picture of christ when he worked that generation and this generation the seventh seal picture untouched by human ideas who are taken listen taking the thunder out of the message for it was seven thunders and they say it don't meet him outcomes of thunder wet it down perverted but I'm holding to what he said just like he said it said preach the word in season out of season in buchen resulted all long-suffering I'm a stayed in to a finish the course I'm a keep the faith amen imma fight a good for him by the help of God well he said I shall never leave you I shall never forsake you then then I can boldly said what I care what man's gonna do for man left I must run right through him now but because both side he must criticize well I don't think he should have said this and I think this is them so forth look go on and criticize every one of us we must go through that for Jesus went through it he said it'd be a time that right then who a standard that would be rejected and therefore it is not me or you is Christ in you being rejected to myth they want to turn it and say is this or that but it's not as what he said amen so therefore thanks be to God this picture message shows just what Christ is how he looks don't change it don't put a little dot over here if he got up because a lot of sorrow there don't put joy over there leave it right there is just what he said leave it just like that see then one morning he'll come and take all the pictures and gather them up and in his quarters up into glory and have a feast first then hang the pictures in his Hall of Fame in that eternal city has a foundation was built and make us God I want to hang in that Hall of Fame amen so therefore if they love me here they love my picture here now that's man amen raring to you when man speak well of you
