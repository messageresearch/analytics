TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so this morning let us turn to st. John 17 and want to read the 23 verses there in the 17th chapter you pray for me and let us pray one for the other and let us pray for this precious brother here that the Holy Spirit would just touch that dumb spirit he is he can't hear that that because hearing devil there that has blocked up his hearing and and that that he could hear the Word of God Saint John 17 these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou has given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him that's all and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent and this God is the word I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished at work which thou has which thou gave us me to do and now father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gave us me out of the world 9 they were and thou gave us their mean and they have kept thy work that's the testimony there they have kept the word if we can only say that amen now they have known that all things whatsoever thou has given me are of thee for they checked it in the worst hey man the seventy went away though but they stayed with that word amen for I have given unto them the words they were just right there the words which thou gave us me and they have received them like we are doing right now the whole message and have known Shirley and the only way that we know is when a false Christ comes against it and it doesn't sound just right yeah then we know that that wasn't a words that God's prophet gave out it's a little bit different amen surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou did it send me and I pray for them I pray not for the world for these people out in the world see you me and it's world system out here in this world church system you know what I mean because the nominations and so forth see but for them which thou has given me his people in the system see for they are thine and all minor burn and dying are mine and I am glorified and them and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gave us me I have kept in none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now come I to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfill in themselves I have given them thy word and the world hath hated them excuse me because they are not of the world now you see why you have your trials you're not of this world here the world hates you even as I am NOT of the world I pray not that that thou should has taken out of the world but that thou sure does keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as I am NOT of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth sanctify me to set you apart for God only set you apart from everything here and as thou has sent me into the world even so I also sent them into the world who sent us here amen he sent us in free zone we are not from here friends he sent us here and if we come from him we must have the Word of God man we must show the word of God amen by living the Word of God Danny we know that we come from him amen and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth Christ could have had a wife and all of these things but he set himself apart from these things that he might set himself apart for us then how much more can we set ourselves apart from this filthy world out here amen to set ourselves apart from the world and everything out here every ungodly thing on here and put ourselves right here on God's altar and Lord thy will be done amen and then they said that you're crazy because you have that oneness with God that that desire to be one with our maker Amen praise our God neither pray I for these alone there it is this is us right here but for them also which shall believe on me through their word Peter's worried Paul's word John's word we're here because we believed on the word here that they wrote and they say man wrote the Bible he sure did because he said that man would write the Bible but we are for those who will believe what these mineral and they were moved by the Holy Ghost amen he's come for us praise God that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me there's a reason and the glory which thou gave us me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one I am them now in me that they may be made perfect in one that the world may know that thou has sent me and and has loved them as thou hast loved me and I want to read Hebrews the tenth chapter the 24th and 25th verse I've already friends so preaching already and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is some who do not want to come together wear this for live preaching maybe just old dead tape amen some don't even show up because it was only a tape see as the manner of some is amen let it sink in there now praise God but exhorting one another and so much the more much more each day as we see that Day approaching may God a blessing to the reading of his word I like to take a little a thought here perfect in one made a lot of blessing the reading of his word and I have a little a prayer request here since the freedom on roll a request at the congregation pray that the Lord will strengthen her she is weak due to her condition she also desires fellowship you know and another one please pray to continue please continue to pray for brother Ted Beulah it it is condition his condition has has improved greatly however he has excessive fluid in his body and needs the deliverance from this condition so let us continue to pray for these precious people and also pray for brother Shepherd he's to see the doctor Monday and also next Thursday for another operation well friends here we are today and we all are wondering what is going on amen and we see the world's conditions and it's not getting any better they're getting worse day by day and yet in all of this it seems mighty strange it seems like the Lord is just not going to come see but he has a purpose and what he's doing and he is never late and he's always on time well see he has to work out of us his will and also his purpose and so doing and just like this place here God I believe God has not given us this place of worship here in vain I mean you would have to be stupid to understand that he would give you a place then let it be like the collide they're gonna take it away from you their countdown positively and give it to you again what for just to come here any old kind of slips a lot away or what or is it for or an eternal purpose of God that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world no matter whether nobody believed it at all it makes no difference for with their unbelief it does not make the word of that of none effect that is gone and we without God we are nothing amen it's just two people sitting here on God's crown of fellowship you know it with the make of heaven fellowship with God God will meet that person on the grounds of his word Amen that's right and we ought to so live this life it is to mix sinners and all who are weary out they Tamarians exploding on them make them jealous make them water because thirst after God but they got to see something from us and if you only come through the Word of God to being consecrated one with the Lord Amen so I believe that I believe that he has a purpose because for us here in New York City here as as individuals for he deals with us as individuals but also I believe that he has a purpose for us as a group also I believe that for I see his signs all around and he has anointed my eyes to see them and that black amen now I can see praise God before I was blind now I can see amen so therefore we see then that we should know what we are doing why we are coming here we're not just Connie are we just come in to come every Sunday to sit here and wimzie just full form and fashion but do we have a revelation do we have understanding or do we have uh some kind of a slip slide away what is a tape tonight well maybe this is a cupboard Joe he's gonna preach tonight or do we have something constraint is in our hearts to want to be with one another whether we just say one word and just go home or not if we just have prayer if we can just shake one another's hands do we have that inside of us what are we coming for tea amen praise our God yes sir so we see what is God doing we have to know what he's doing so we can be blessed so we can understand what he's doing then we when we can see the hand of the Lord revealed amen then we can shout and also praise God before we see it but you just can't stay up the body you just see it and you just can't say anything at all you just know that is something amen but that's at faith before he drops his supernatural faith into our hearts to let us know something is going on I believe therefore just what is God doing here I believe that he is preparing of people to bear his name his name is his person I'm Joseph Coleman you know by my own character and also by my own ways Who I am then we know Christ's character is laid out in the Bible here who is he has called us to this calling to bear his name Amen to speak his words to live his life God has called us here for that and if so dude he has blessed us giving us a place here with his anointing settles down in here where the word is preached his tapes of play whatever it is makes no difference still the Word of God therefore when we can see that why is he doing that he's going to hell if his - he's going to have a people who will bear his name who will be after that priestly order Amen sons of God who they are whoever it is standing at a man he's going to have that friends yes he is praise God he's going to have these people to be united with Christ to be perfect in one with God and Christ now he is perfecting right now a virgin church and soon as the scripture of first Corinthians 13 when he was just perfect just come that which which is in part shall be done away with immediately when the prophet left has seen the false Christ come he was just perfect is here we don't have to pray no more we don't have to worship no more we'll need because there are no more ministers will need no more anything when he which is perfect is the way to bring the whole word he'll deceive daddy how deceit are you can you imagine that the perfect way to God to bring the whole Bible here now and when it comes then some rise up and say that you don't need this unit and you don't need that there are disease when the word come himself to anoint every word anoint every word from Genesis clean through the Bible don't you take one word don't you add one word to what he has already spoken and yet they go on adding and taking away right before your eyes going out what is it the deaf angel coming down take it out the uncircumcised right before you Wow for there's no blood over the door they don't even know what the word is for they take away from the Word of God and the Death Angel comes right down and just takes them away and but you deal licked at once you keep right on going when the pillar of fire goes up you move out we are places we are make mistakes show me will we will keep on making mistakes until that perfect one that cell up on God's prophet tell us on you amen that's different in but right now we still make mistakes well as long as we're in God's ladder duty he will bless us for any others who will curse you he'll like Balaam to see that blood atonement hang in their graves outcome they fail to see it they say well that person in he ain't caught for this and he caught and she's this and also because she's that but there's a blood atonement hanging there for each elected seat of God there's a bathroom in heaven now if the seed of God remains and you cannot commit Salem amen any woman any man any child that has taken their portion of the Word of God though you make mistakes God will bless you you just try God I don't see if he won't bless you yes he will Prince he's sure will amen so what are we doing now he's a perfecting a bride that knows nothing of man thanks be to God for he gave our ministry he gave up the Spirit of Christ for the work of one ministry just one ministry missed Christ and God's prophet had that Ministry of Christ then there because there are also others who bring the word that word not them the word does perfect the breath maybe one here one over there but is got to be for a witness for this is the word age it must be somewhere in the world it's got to be somewhere in the world so we see then that he is perfecting a bride who knows nothing of man those who have not listened to the scribes Pharisees under shepherds the conniving Shepherds those who have not listened to their foolishness see because when the serpent beguiled Eve he gave her wisdom and because she went off because the serpent presented it that way she was deceived see now this church here the prophet of God brought the message we just listened to him amen he were not the same then here they come presenting it that way in that light then if you go to it God has God's probably have already spoken five things you must not do we misplaced aware that got pretty over there put over there that right don't do it so say Moses so say I that right it's all on tapes there then along come the false Christ anointing with the Serpent's spirit upon him and say well he a God has said hey brother Brennan means this here yeah he means this here so when is presenting that light that person hangs between death and life right there and if that anointing gets up on them then if they will yeah well maybe that is right that's wisdom there's a better way than what has already been laid out are you following friends therefore then they're going for a better way than what has already been spoken now what happened in spoken will always be very simple it would be too simple they'll stumble right on top of it it'll be so humble so simple and it was so simple to coverage on his own samples didn't know him Jesus said so all right when heaven kissed earth and Jesus took up the three which is up front pick up on the mountain up there and they saw Moses and also allowed you the resurrections living and also dead DiPaola God they hate him so forth manifested son and then there was still some disciples hanging there who said what but wait a minute resurrection is going on but why say it the scribes then he last his first got to come he's already come and you didn't know it see so therefore I am being diligent that what has transpired from 63 through 65 that I will not deny it that's it what I've seen is it no matter how many Devils come against it I've seen God in fish he's made Malachi 4 live already God in fishes the third Pole is God speaking through human lips I've have already seen it already seeing it yes I know he said when he says when that press comes down watch that third pole but who is it for he died for who he died for you he poured his seed in you but it might be because maturity rapping so when that press come down what's that bride that's that supernatural bride moved in with God speaking right through their lips right there this is his promises friend we've seen all of these things and yet man goes on and these false Christ's and so forth feeding these poor people or the the chaff of weak and conflicting because foolishness because of me and so therefore may human opinions man's ideas which means nothing yay let every man be a liar in God's Word be trophies amen then these perfected ones will be a supernatural bride designed only by the word that's all nothing else Moses went up to the Mount there right friends to get the pattern there was nobody else there then nobody else knew what Moses what God said to Moses nobody else knew what Moses meant but God is that right and he whom he shall reveal it to that's all then he brought that pattern down and it's laid out here back in old Bible here another prophet of God went up and got a sword also and come down with it amen and laid it out for us that right friends and nobody else was there but him and God and then nobody else knows what God said to him only what is on the tape that's all you know and then only what God shall reveal was on there to you and then when it's revealed it better end up with the Word of God it better be out of context miss yes it shall be the word what is it in season is it in season that's the thing see so therefore this perfected bride she will be a supernatural bride designed by God she'll have a pure spirit pure blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God just pure even as we appear and all over impregnate with the Holy Ghost and there's something friends the spoken word church of God it must be an anointed church to bear the name of Jesus Christ must be anointed now watch this the election and preparation of this bride is to be after a secret and also hidden manner the Bible says so because when you open the Seventh Seal silence nothing so you won't know the third plane you won't know it you won't know what it is it won't be explained and God told the Prophet he says don't tell nobody now this is what he said nobody knows nothing about the third Pole take the secret of it in your bosom to the grave cetera then first I can see that nobody knows nothing about it only what God shall reveal as you keep moving day by day then nobody can run off nowhere with nothing because he hasn't terrible buddy nothing amen I mean a few scribes and also Pharisees who think they know what it is but they don't c4 is our revelation straight from the throne now watch what he does in the early stage in the secret and also hidden manner David is to type amen and David was a little ruddy boy God found him out on the desert that right with the Sheep but then God called him and all selected him and annoying him by who by the prophet of the Lord and God also called you elect a Jew and also anointed you with the word by whom by God's prophets amen and then with that once that happens you got to go through not come up to and say I don't want to go through it but go through fiery trials amen and then when we see the ferry Charles coming rejects for God has deliberately put it there for you so he can go through with you standing in the fire he's in there but take the step in there and when you go down up into the child the fire burns off the cords and you're set free amen not one hair on your hair even even smell the fire all right D clothes was even touched nothing on you can you lose how he is in every trial he's there he said so amen so then why God was doing a secret work a hidden work see just like David he does that until you're fully grown yeah amen then he presented David to the outside because a professing Church and he met them out there and it was afraid because Saul in a month did that right and now he come and he also met the church there he met because because Goliath and Philistines amen and so are we to meet Satan and these two hundred thousand thousand demons out there and the professing church but after God has done a secret and hidden work which is doing right now in our hearts that's what he's doing right now but it seemed like it because I guess nothing he said to be a strange work the restrooms are short quick powerful work is strange we won't understand code we have not been this way before so if we have not been this way before as in tape how could anybody run out of here that this is it here when we haven't been there way before the Bible says so amen so we see their friends that when the seventh seal was broke see there had to be silenced because he had to do this work hidden because away from all prying eyes to look in to see what he's doing yeah when because Aaron went behind that veil nobody went back there with him that all right see nobody see okay God is doing his work now he's perfecting his bride into his image to be one with him this is a total and full redemption being done by price it is to see total Redemption total blood a man not just part of the way I mean I feel good today and don't feel good tomorrow it's total it's already done hey man praise God so ever so now God has opened the seven seals to reveal the work that he did back in paul's age and also right on down and what he opened the seven see is open to seal broke that right and that therefore then when he opened don't miss it when he opened the sixth seal he showed what he done back there but the seal actually broke back there but he only revealed in 63 what he did back there so then the seal also broke the seventh seal broke also and he will reveal any day soon what he has been doing in sixty three four five six any day soon it shall reveal for we have this written word amen but the revealed words like wit Malachi for has revealed the word Malachi for spoke it out all God wanted our people to do was to receive my words that's all don't change it don't say what you think it is don't go over here don't do it don't say nothing just receive the words then make you sleep they have kept that word that's all then we enhance them then he can anoint him and reveal the word then that is the revelation of the word going forth like it was with because Malachi 4 amen then friends then as he began open seal by seal the Ark of testimony up in heaven sea was open up and that Ark of testimony up in heaven there was a living testimony contained in there this living testimony a witness come on there and went into Malachi 4 and said this is it this is Christ that's that living witness that living testimony and that could just speak the word out there and something happened amen praise our God well then that living testimony was a presence of the Almighty God it was the token that God's prophet said had to come no not in 1906 in the even time you slay the lamb is slain and even time and the token is all over the house the body of Christ amen but everybody in the house must have the token amen but see is then the other words in 1906 you won't understand because what it is back there but in the evening time you see it it was the blood there and this evening time here you'll see it it was that living testimony that come down from the Ark in heaven and camp on earth it was humble it was meek it was Cara it was the Word of God amen friends praise our God then this token life the presence has unknown it the house of God the bride and the Bloods hanging over it now and the death angels come but because you are in the land of duty the Death Angel can not take you who says what if you fall down he'll pick you pick you up and we can where we can be so learn with Christ how does man his word his spirit then we can be in oneness with him that's what he wants to do friends amen so we see then that the bride is now actually being sealed by the divine presence the live intestine when I was contained in the ark up in heaven sealing them since 63 serum enough for hits the mine of Christ and I'll knock their bodies to do it and they'll do it and I'll let two hundred thousand thousand demons I'll let the put and the world come for all of these things because come against me I'll let these plagues the race rise and all these things be up on top of them but fear not little flock it is the Father's will to give you the kingdom then if it's his will of do it who can't stop him I'm doing it nothing can harm you be of good courage God shall preserve you he shall he said so thank you then just like Paul and them were sealed back there and the Prophet revealed what happened we're being sealed now by the Word of God every word then Jesus Christ will be soon be able to say father they have received thy works send down the voice of the resurrection no orator God senator it'll come like the voice of a rushing mighty wind and breathe upon us then the Holy Ghost shall be upon you and also in you like it is now but he said that the Holy Ghost went with them the Lord went with them that right working with them with them amen it seems good to the Holy Ghost and us see your friends we have on the inside of the heart he's there but he's gonna come down pill a fire and then when he goes he says go out you move out staying here you stand there you say nothing except he says it amen see these are God's promises are another true there in the Bible and God's prophet has revealed us and therefore we are to take these promises and walk into and cut our way in there because it's there gonna be some false Christ who says no it's not there yet God has said over here it a prophet sit over here see just keep moving love them and just keep walking it's all right brother get out of my way cuz I'm going to the promised land amen if you want to believe that go right ahead that's alright but I'm staying with the word Amen so the bride is being sealed now why to distinguish her from all the other Babylonian that out here that's all amen David was sealed amen bye anoint by God's prophet he was distinguished between Saul in the church amen in David it was a distinction there there's a difference there for David have what faith what do you have the faith has been restored in that doorway but always right and your season here now we have faith in what the word can speak when it wants to but right now is now speaking it right now but I know it can Weiss or speak through the Prophet so therefore brother I know it because I won't be here that's all right I can be healed in his season in his town I know that the word pull is that word to speak through lips human lips in season in the season I know that then God sent David out there to Goliath he was in the line of duty amen now always may show you in the line of duty see me now so when David walked out there he's a hard there you are circumcised Philistine a man to differ the living army of God how dare you I'll cut your head off amen well then you we here can say the same thing how dare these uncircumcised philistine even this place here as an outward place here God put us here there's not a one person in this whole world who can tear down this building or disrupt this world because I am persuaded that what we have committed to him is able to keep any day when any uncircumcised philistine comes against this work here for God put it here and he showed us things in the natural he showed you because you lose it did not give it back to you you keep on walking hey amen he shows you that to build up your faith to break up let you know where you're standing in we're standing on cops ground or this fellowship and no one is with Christ that's where we're standing at amen so with this word token the bride is and passed through these little fiery trials which is only a light affliction that's all it is a light affliction so that we could say yes we stayed with the word amen yes Father we kept we did the work that you Jesus he sent us here for that all right so we have finished the work we finished our work but I work is right now still going on what is it a testimony a witness whether it's a housewife or whoever it is it's other testimony that's all he wanted you to do just stand in that there and he'll bless you right in that for you in the line of God's work amen so we see then that we pass through these fiery trials then we whole thing so that which has is good prove all things hey man well see he's already giving first he gives us a word first they lets the devil come against it and the true one stand up with the word like Micah stood against a four hundred Amen see Micah was the true bride stand against and messengers went out brother Freddie messengers went out from because Derek I knew say look here Mike O'Brien you say what we think it is you not a minister messengers now look here brother look here brother Micah Zedekiah and in the four hundred said this right here you better do it he said gather my way I'll see what God says what you mean Micah you're not right you ain't a fellowship Micah yes I'll say what God said then right but Nastya when he saw all the big fellows excuse me hey having him said he's a crank he's always saying what the word says all the time he's mean so therefore he says what do you think Micah about us going out here to because because to the place out here he said because go ahead he knew that Micah didn't mean that is it how many times have I told you to tell me the truth you know you don't believe that so but tell me what it is so I can know what it is so they come with the questions the question is the questions amen so then Micah said well I had a vision seven sealed vision I saw the Lord High lifted up amen amen and in that seven steel vision of the end time he said false Christ lion spear shall go out and get up on a big group out there and just seize them amen and end the thing there'll be because of Jehoshaphat he'll be in there awesome but God knows how to deliver the godly out of a trial he knows how to do it perhaps they need some more Persian no no see me now but he'll get him out but the lion Devils has got to get the whole group out somewhere see me now then let those serious because something because come against it and then watch old Jehoshaphat finally cry out to God and all these things will deliver hey yes he will he said he will deliver there's got to be some kind of well something that looks just like the word ramoth-gilead it belongs to us but but it wasn't a season wasn't a season he had already passed it blind to it though see but then that's the way it's gotta be then just also got to be Jeremiah and also Hina he not a true prophet of God sanctified our prophet of Israel believe the message for Jeremiah said clear an apparel I he and I say Quran of Babylon that's the message there are what Jeremiah said 70 years paint I said two years one word off how can you tell who's right no prophets of God check the word all right check the word pour the season and the turn then the other one which always look for Balaam he's very sweet here he comes you got his hand stuck out always looking for money here he comes and will curse you talk about you you ain't no good Guardian call them people there so forth so they can know with him come out of there see fail to look at the blood God is God does not discriminate in essence they don't understand that they think that only a certain kinds over here and so forth that's Balaam and he teaches that also and says that to see what he's blind he cannot see the blood atonement hanging God is no respecter of persons I can't do anything he wanted to unto Abraham but Balaam goes right on so don't bother leave bailing right there let's get his money get the money it's all right God's gonna judge him footing anyway but what he did with it see just go ahead and if you want to get because give it out to him but when God says stop stop then when he says give it to give it to him say Amen those three things I look for day and night and then I'll stay with their way where am I see those three things that a great big group thing they're positively no intellectual there'll be no gatherings only an intellectual gathering what the mind thinks it is but the word has already laid it out Amen friends so we've seen in we hold fast to that which is good amen we pull their things no matter what happens see and that we have already received already not going to receive have already received see and we wait together in unity there's a thing in unity alone see you me an elephant but that's where the trouble comes right there the groups cannot wait together in unity of love because each one thinks it means this it means that but here's a little secret for you the disciples with out the Holy Ghost was on one Accord yeah now you tell me something all right they received the words from the Lord Jesus they didn't try to change it though no man said nothing and a Bible says in acts 1:14 that they were on one Accord and with the women also continue in prayer supplications then right Mary being there letting these Catholics know because she had to get the same thing Mary being there hey man and all the brethren that my friends see me now and acts 2:4 says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were with one Accord in one place well oh the Holy Ghost yeah see so here today what are they doing then and who has the word without the Holy Ghost here we are preaching the word the tapes is played do you know why we play the tapes we plan so you can check us out Sunday morning I preach so the night is a tape mm-hmm so you can come right back here to see what's going on yourself that's why we play the tapes then if I feel bad when you stay away cuz you ain't checking me on amen praise the Lord well praise our God amen so we see it in friends that we are to wait together in unity of love for that day to approach now there's gonna be all kind of little things because rise up in your myths to test you on your love that's all it is how else can you be perfected uh I'm right where God put you amen praise our God and also in the world and so forth see so now excuse me Paul says here and here in the book of Hebrews 10:24 25 let me read that there you saw with me praise our God hmm and let us consider one another let us consider one another amen not just ourselves now don't be all burdened down with your own self Oh Lord I'm in this trial if I can only understand this over here and then you come to church legacy and because then you go home like that then you're going back and forth oh my self see then hiring at work you help anybody how can you help anybody when you are burdened down with what you're doing oh hey man just didn't happen here that didn't happen nobody loves me nobody took my hand and see oh lord help me Lord help me Lord see nobody loves me God loves you sure he does but you don't know that because you never gave him a chance to love you through his people so he wants to

our heads in prayer and going home and then you met the Lord somebody was edified somebody was comforted somebody was encouraged amen see let us consider and give continuous care watching over one another let us study how we may stir up stimulate insight one to love Amen Prince now not forsaken or neglecting to assemble ourselves together as believers what does God give us just place here for you tell me two similar selves here everybody did just brother ain't got nowhere to go right here and the man's death can't even hear and can't hear and you got nowhere to go and came to talk nobody see and here we are right here right in the middle of all three boroughs look at these poor because a deluded black people out here the what they call deep the poor people stick because thing on here resurrection city because down in Washington DC nobody won't care nothing about it all down there and they walk off Mississippi all over and let me go wags everything else to come near for purpose when God has given just place here for a purpose all we gotta do is get on a subway or get on the bus or drive a car to come here some can't make it one night Wednesday and I can't make it Sunday night can't make it see I ain't thinking about those because wives and so forth we have to go way out the long island so forth because on the Whitaker sitting here I marvel I have to because take off my hat and sister Kerry and his family here I Drive out there because a couple of times as I always drive going out there they come here Wednesday Sunday morning Sunday night and go back home to eat and come back here and never says one word all they want is more fellowship God's gonna bless him for it that's exactly right your blessing for that they don't complain save it now well if I could only uh this here you know see but God knows what he's doing they're sitting up timber up here hey man praise God so we see it in not forsaken or neglecting to assemble ourselves together as believers see as is the habit of some who won't do it they'll curse you and so forth that's all right they went out froda they was not others but exhorting admonishing amen warning one another a man as we see that day approaching with faith though not yeah I think the Lord's coming praise the Lord yeah brother I know God is gonna do it glory to God amen yes sir amen that's fear to walk into not you know hallelujah one little finger be cut to little hands or so shaking your hair like milk you know see me now so we have all the signs of his coming amen praise God the Prophet Elisha has come on the scene our eyes have been blessed annoying to see Elijah think of it the mortal Elijah despair I was up on him was up on William Brennan yeah resting on God's prophet nine and Malachi for revelation ten seven these scriptures came to life that was the written word but that living testimony contained in the are come down and got on that written word and took that written word inter William branham's heart and made it live amen then there's a written word here that there's gonna be a bride she's gonna be because in the resurrection and in the rapture that same pilla fire will come down again and get into your heart and make this written word live then when it lives that will be the revealed word out in that they'll see it there is your reveal word out there - they'll see that there and we see the Pope and image sodomites all building into a one world system Amen friends there is going to be one moral system it is later than what you think of it amen Wars rumors of wars earthquakes and all of these things we see it go on we friends excuse me we see all of these people these poor people because pressing for our promise living for a little handout which they're never going to get and they got faith - Frank falling down for that what about us we know is true his word heaven and earth shall pass away but his word shall never pass away these people live it down there in mud city down there Devil's tantamount both ways tear them up and it's still gonna singing and also believe that they're going to get something from somebody who don't even know them but he loves us he died for us to prove it and greater love hath no man than to lay down his life for his friends and we are his friends we're his children we're his sons and daughters with his back we aware of his word hello this bone cutter this pleasure spirit of a spirit we amen so now therefore if there are a supernatural people united to the word to this word here see Christ principles history because doctrine not some what somebody said but with the word says here then the world will know that Christ was sent of God that's his purpose so this early church found a secret they kept the word there was a secret Hey they was already on women porn you know they didn't say nothing they didn't say well you know they said nothing they just kept the words and went into the upper room on that promise mm-hmm and he only told us don't misplace the word don't because take out a season those five things don't if you're not a called don't don't handle the arc all right he told this just don't do those things he'd be alright and so say Moses so say yeah but some got to do it see well therefore we just just do that what he said now God deliberately spoke it the way he spoken see me now to see if we would just take it just that way and wouldn't go for wisdom a better way and some must go for that what because put is better way so we see friends in that the world will know just like Malachi for was united with the word all right and the world knew that Christ was sent because he backed up because Jesus Christ therefore we here in our fellowship here if we are united with this word here so much that we are one see that's one then also with God we won and with our brethren because because we are one see one with our brethren with the word and our worship in the church here one see me now then the world here will know that Christ was sent from God well that's what he said and then the world see somebody doing it then they know that he died because 2,000 years ago and here here's a dead word here living amen by the living testimony from God you see guess what he wants to do now we can only do this because because by becoming one with Christ in Christ and God as Christ and Ava's one see now this is the secret of the whole thing for the early church they had that because here's why they took note that Peter had been with Jesus then right so amen so therefore when that comes they'll take note that you had been with those words that were spoken by Elijah you didn't change it just said what it said and stayed right with it amen French see and so therefore we know as we said before that we can be on one mind and one heart through the Word of God just do the work without that uniting spirit yet had even come in they was on one Accord the Bible says so amen okay and jesus said father they have received our words and they have kept our amen praise God all right friends because in closing why do we stress because this word so much we must receive every word of God and also hold on to it and into the into every word as a promise because of God see and so therefore jesus prayed that we would be one see and with this Union because of oneness then when he went when crises that then this prayer can be answered then you can come for his bride when that count and that's coming - well he'll send his spirit it'll be so it's going to be so a man he only sent a word for us to tell us what to do and we're doing it now told how to get ready and we're doing it right now see therefore that's the church that Jesus Christ is coming for then will his prayer be answered and how will it be answered it'll be revealed amen then Jesus written word shall be revealed through the bride amen and father they have kept the words they have received that word hey man did all that's written for the bride that he failed to do back there and also because because to his prophet they shall do it whatever it is I don't know whatever it is they shall do it and it won't be there it'll be his words and them doing it amen friends praise our God because see that then if we have this very own spirit how should we be here in love exhorting one another and so father we say we have your spirit amen get him in our friends one mister word kind of quiet Amen praise our god but God planned that we should be him by a union of his spirit but first it give his word for us to know what it's like and you say want to be like God and you ain't then why was that because Peter because it was the seat inside something in there because compelled him to do it saying then he sent down His Holy Ghost and they were just one people and then he come down himself like we say evany was and spoke what lip to hear amen and we're now in either time ready again for God to calm down is lip to ear purse with the word of God every man every woman every child see and know what God is about to do Lana just like because Joshua he had the Word of God they knew that God was too because cut down the enemy said all right there you know how God was going to do it so after they were circumcised and so forth the captain of the host come down and revealed to walk around jericho there the revealed word come down so we know what we're supposed to do see but we don't know how to do it so he'll send down the voice of the Resurrection and the voice the Kepler the holes will stand there and we and we're standing on holy ground in the back in here and here all holy ground horses here march around Jericho yes the General Orders and out and no explanation what no more false Christ's would what do you think hey ya know what you think the voice speaks it and it's done okay I think no there's no I think nothing about it it's that holy God fear and assembly in God's people amen no scribe can say anything then because Christ is in the myths himself hey when that happens in the line of duty no matter what happens Josh your way in the lower duty he was laying into me it was getting dark amen there right friends he said God I need some more time David Matas hear me that's why and he spoke son standstill the spoken word of God come out of his mouth and he stopped the son that right son standstill this breath when she's in the land of duty every man every limited child I love with the wittekop he will come down in the evening time and speak once again look to him I said my son my daughter do this here do that in the line of duty no matter what is this peak to worry watch the third poll man when that press comes down God is gonna move in his people friends I believe that what is he is now making us perfect in one and that's how he does it he makes us perfect in one to do it so then we say then that all the Lord want us to do is to be humble be humble be humble so yeah that's all and then when you hear a person no matter where they are I don't think I think see that mean Christ finally now friends you see a person just walking God fighting their battles God speaking for them so forth and so on sometimes here because because you hear us cry out here the reason why I'll cry out and let you know that what God is doing other than that I think I don't want to say now sometimes if if a person don't understand what God is doing I gotta tell them cuz I must tell them oh hi I can't because I cannot deny God no I mean I see what he's doing here so therefore I'll tell you look what he's doing seen well never become once anything at all see so then as we see no matter what we think what we do wife and husband and also children minister deacon and so forth the matters not God has blessed us here he's give us this place here for purpose and you must know it you must know it then what are we coming here for are we coming here to see if we don't make a mistake trauma now to see what we're going to say to write it down and send out a letter somewhere probably all friends to get on the phone and say well this happened this morning I mean that didn't happen because I went through because disciples in Christ they wasn't they was together they think it was outside they was here 920 there was a nobody running out of there when Peter stood up and spoke and wrote it down and got on the phone he calls them out over there one man put me here I'll ask her what Indiana or Tucson anywhere he put me here with you we're going in here and are we dying to get back here we're slayed down there spirits and so forth we want to be here with the people God put and we love it and we try to love everybody out there we try to have a testimony out there also but here's where you put us right here when we here are going to be together in the Millennial Kingdom if we here are gonna be together for eternity amen and therefore so prove that we are his family he has given us his eternal spirit we are eternal beings right now in fresh not in fresh snow this fresh hair was made to sin but he says as we take this word in sent up the timber we've build another house amen to be clothed with in the resurrection that right friends so therefore keep on sending up the Timbers don't stop there amen and all you know if it's a man and a woman whenever you do one word of God got a bless you so much just one word Charmy these because Mormons they tithe and they're rich that's right and also the Catholics they tied on one Word of God and God bless them many outside because they are healed and not even saved one word of God how much more his people here hey man how much more we do for us we are here amen word of his word spiritus parrot image of his image we are Christ Wow to convict the world of sin to prove that he was sin well how am i keeping this word hmm and then in perfect harmony with the word then he sends down that uniting spirit that overpowers you that goes with you that works with you just because up over you amen and goes with you and if you have need of anything just speak the word it's gonna be amen and right now if I pray for the sick here they don't get here I'll pray tonight for the same sake I'll pray next wizzy I'll just keep on praying I don't mean anything if I make mistakes I'm here in the line of duty God called me therefore I'm right here make I make my mistakes I'm in line of duty but they feel recognized determine hang in there for the mistakes and so anyone they God's call here God called you here for purpose for any Turner purpose he give us his pace with his hands all around he's sure he could take it down and he could also start up again he can pull down and also pick up he can do it himself oh he was a people to believe that come in here praise God whether it is her if this poor body miss and prayer rivers be humble be reverent if you're in the back there talk on the things of God not what happened this dress not the thing all the dance on for you follow me amen that's what God wants in his house friends I'm not a fanatic hey hey man I know we're talking about a wheelchair I know how many best well he has no other ground fellowship all of there no word of God he proved it amen praise Alcock do you believe it friends yeah I don't know Noel because way to tell you and I know that we are right on the threshold of something just it's unspeakable as a prophet of God said you can't even talk about it it's so great as a fact that if we can comprehend his love that he died for us there's a supernatural God with what because create flesh and come down and flesh and die for us and we see the world's conditions even in reading this thing to you later than what you think and some people today they are in the world trouble and it's the mind age they're going out of their minds they don't know what's going on because this LSD and hippies and all this there's just plagues of God and how we thank God how we love him that we have the mind of Christ the word and that's what takes us through and let us pray for those that are weak for there will be those weak ones the Bible says to bear up to week that aright you see if we are strong we don't look down on the weak we stick out a hand also there mo pray for them amen see and I was endeavoring to tell you this morning that God is perfecting us and the the Brethren ministers deacons and so forth everybody in order in line with the Word of God see line up with the word and and also sisters mothers and everybody here line up the word and then you see God's blessing upon you and then when you see that he sends a sign a token that he's with you because he compass you and so forth when you see a person being blessed that's a sign that God is with that person you follow me now friends he's with that person say otherwise because the person wouldn't be blessed and then because I don't get jealous you just say Lord make me a blessing to him that bless more brother and watch God open up the floodgates upon you see me now but so much jealousy and so forth you say they want that don't want that just want what he want to give me see and then you'll be blessed also amen and then sometimes when you say certain things like last Sunday just feeling led as we wait for the Holy Spirit and right behind brother hunt now time is say asleep and then in saying that somebody say what we're talking about me what I say that day I dear friends he comes to reprove than receive it and then receive it with a meek and humble spirit if it's not you then you don't have anything to say Amen other words if something is said and it's not you you have no condemnation walking with Christ love of God in your heart but then if this is you and you say what at me and so for someone say to me now then there are also these things for understanding then there's there are those because because the one who comes in because look brother just happened that happened in because we pray for that and that's good see there others who want to fight that see me now don't fight it friends if it issue so you come like some do come and say whoa because brother : this happened that happened you could brother hunt and so forth will get out and pray over things see and get rid of it see other words friends I'm trying to get to you God has sent this word here right now tendinitis up to get us in the line of duty then when we get in the line out there he presses us there then we make mistakes here now we will make mistakes every day see but because we've learned up with that word see he obligated to pleasure and he'll do it see me and I'm friends whether it's men women or whoever it is he'll bless you and that's all we're trying to do and in stay with the word exalt one another and assemble yourselves here together whether it's prayer whatever it is okay we don't think nobody to come of course you think if you want to come you can come see because we have a bit of different problems and so forth some have their own ministries no that's alright see but we just have one minute Ministry of the word amen to lay up with that word see dummy now because just just like his brother said he's a brother branham hallelujah he says glory to God he says since I seat because because you're Elijah I just want to go run and tell the whole world he's a whole still brother God's fixing to speak out of his amen chisaem or I'm in one time a precious brother up here saw brother friend downtown 1965 and said brother Brad I have a desire to you know call out with come with a message and so forth and he said well brother Cole and he called he said well you know but my wife and family know I'll just warming and I'm sort of
