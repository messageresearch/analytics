TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so now we know that we've gone through trials and tribulations and adversities but by the help of God we want to show you that these are actually good but we got doing the word amen praise the Lord now the message is in found in Philippians the third chapter the seventh verse through the fifteenth verse and Hebrews the twelfth chapter verses one and two reading from Philippians first the third chapter seventh verse well what things were gain to me those I counted loss for Christ ei doubtless and I count all things but loss for the excellency C of the knowledge of Jesus of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ see the righteousness which is of God by faith that I made know him this is one thing that the one strength and the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead we understand this to beam out from the dead in the first resurrection the bride not as though I have all I had already attained either we're already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect this means as many as be mature grown-up full-grown be the smyrna and have this mind saying and if in anything you be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you if you have any other purpose for following jesus christ and not the purpose of being perfected god he revealed to you that this is the message wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses those going on before us let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God may God a blessing the reading of his word I like the title list the way of the Cross and it may be in two parts I don't know I have some things that the Lord saying this morning will just be one to me I like to give another part of this Fellowship of his sufferings but you can't say everything at once see so I want to show is my purpose this morning to show you what you're doing now see and then let you know what you're getting ready to do see and then when you know the will of God then you got faith in what you're doing but you're all tangled up then you know where you're going then you add His mercy Satan's mercy then he got you saying yeah and he saw the buffing around it see but we want to know the Word of God now the message the way of the Cross now Paul is seen here in in the book of Hebrews your little breakwater thank you he says looking unto Jesus yeah that's the starting point excuse me right there looking unto Jesus one of the message that their brother Brandon preached when he was about to go away in 63 look away to Jesus make sure of what you're looking for what is your aim in life what is your desire is it Jesus or is it mixed part of the world and part of Jesus see do you want to live at the source of all things see because things that are made was made by that which is unseen which is the word so some people can only live a Christians out on the UH circumference where they can see things but the real source is at the core other words if you have gold out here see well you don't have to go out there Bigfoot out there go to the source where I come from because he made it there right and he's able to make anything else amen so then when you can get to the core from where it come from see then you can live my faith and ask God by faith now for therefore we are looking unto Jesus he is the author and the finisher he is the perfecter of our faith he is the author being he is the leader in the source of our faith it is only by him given the first incentive amen for our belief if he don't come and put it there you can't believe he must put it there and so he begins with a little seed and that little seed comes into light light strikes it it comes alive unto God Amen but he is also the finisher he's the one nobody else that can bring that seed of faith and to maturity and to perfection see now Christ has already conquered and he lives in us as a conqueror so we could put it straight we want Satan to know that we know this amen so we know where he's standing at now Christ lives in us and works by his promises for us get it now he lives in us see then when he goes to work he can't go through our flesh works he can only go through the prompted Leon the Bible then if we can believe these promises see like in prayer you come together in prayer you begin to meditate and find the will of God and then you a check out what you're asking for deceive us in the Bible to see if your situation happened to somebody back there in the Bible it's four types examples when you see your child because it's in the Bible you say well Lord God is there amen now I come in prayer for it and I ask in faith because it's there in the Bible amen see it's a Bible prayer and you ask for it he'll do it it's in the word amen praise the Lord so now God's purpose today God is trying to find someone and individual anybody that he can confirm himself through see that others might see that he lives the resurrected corn of wheat is living somewhere see and he can only live by resurrection power for in weakness because he was crucified see and then Christ now think of it it is only living by the power of God see the only way he can live to exist to think Jesus Christ is to live by God's power see and that's the power that he wants to pull through you but it can't come in until you die that's the law of the spiritual harvest something must die for you to live see it's got to be that way so you got to die to yourself then you can live by the power of his resurrection that is the only way so now the trouble today that there's a lack of authority faith you're the lack of God's people to step up fully and say Christ is in me get back Satan they're afraid to say that some reason they believe that they are joined by one spirit they say souls in the Bible are God's prophet has come and preached almighty message spiritual union of the bride and yet they still don't because appropriate there for themselves see hey man because the devil has told them that by a strong illusion that you are separated from him in a state of separation yes are you are in heavenly places sometime in church or maybe when you get a spirit of Prayer see them in there oh he tells you I'm sure you don't have the place is there but not when you I saw walking I've done because in the carnal you're not there no more he separate he's alive for Christ is in you Paul say it is not i but Christ liveth in me so does he stop living when you go out in the world for why does he go away somewhere no he abides right there amen see God has away he worse he don't change the father thinks two thoughts the son speaks the thoughts by faith and the Holy Spirit brings it to pass hey men Jesus Christ could walk the father thought it and whatever was blindness or death or whatever was the son know is got to be done so he gives thanks to the Father I thank you Heavenly Father then he speaks the word barfy amen that same Jesus Christ is abiding in you right now he is the one Joshua hey men that that steps forward that's the face when you see a person moving forward is not is Joshua in him moving forward amen because the Sun is the one who speaks to worry he said let there be the Sun says let there be amen Holy Spirit bring it to pass so therefore we see them that our spiritual vitality is cept at the roots through failure to boldly grafts this fact this truth Christ is in you win now we live back to his atoning work we said well yes because we were saved the 19 song song song see and we know I'll be caught up to meet him that's at the end but what is he doing now well right now you just fall down in what you got faint enough to look back and say to look forward but what about right now see he won't know are you the sons of God not going to be but now now possess the positions in the lane do it now right now he has a spiritual law your feet must stand on the spot the soles of your feet must stand there well then you got to do something not your own words but he must be leading he is the one who leads to victory that right now he's here there joshua number there and when they were getting ready to move forward there was somebody stand-in there that one seen captain head right over the holes they are you for us or against us nay I'm the captain of the host I'm right here with you but you won't see me amen it's the Holy Spirit he's right there he's here now but for this time is season where you must have faith you don't see him right now but he's doing something mighty powerful he is discern now the Prophet says don't lay in the Sun if we've got to be here he's here amen so now our spiritual vitality is set at the root see through failure to grasp that he's in us now amen now we drive that home saying we have this spiritual union now see because it was snapped way back there because through Adam see because Adam died in the spirit to God see and then he was resurrected in the flesh to Satan that right somebody had has got to come forth and he did Christ to die in the flesh and Satan and be resurrected back to God amen and we do the same thing praise the Lord see now watch now here is the era de Carrera Satan makes it appear by a strong delusion that we are separated right now so we say we are sitting in heavenly places up there alright see but he keeps us in a state of separation from Christ here on earth but if we up there he's also down here he's in us right now amen see therefore if we listen to Satan we are at Satan's mercy Amen see then when a crises come we're weak because we think he's up there but he's in You amen and it never got he smiles then he got you running around because I'll to pray for me help me Oh see he's right in you mm see calling upon the name of the Lord I'm a help a present help at a time of need look to there from which cometh your skirt he's in you crisis in you so when a decision is to be made you waver because we waver see but not realize but see is through knowledge that we get to know him hidden we know where we're standing here that's why the word had to come the Pentecostals all shook up when a prophet brought that word and brought paint down to us we know what we're standing up now amen see so we see our weaknesses and we cry see we ask from help from the outside now he says he is the author on the inside outside he's on the inside and outside oh the power that he has is hidden you now yeah he says that's right oh the parent God's troll is in you now right now but all you have to do is to realize that see you mean though so now so therefore we can't aside our faith we listen to Satan's or suggestions see he said well you don't see and strong delusions it will because look how you feel you say well yeah that's right big I don't feel good ty yeah see that's right see and he tell you all these things and then you look at the flesh you look at because your own carnal state see so therefore in a time like this when you strongly you move in we are to draw the sort of spirit and step out boldly and possess our positions see the word is here the promise and we come into it but once we get in there you gotta move forward and take every promise by faith Joshua in the tape had to take every belt that you will fail because they fail in tight you fall down Satan he will assault you a thousand times yes sir yes just remember that now brother he's gonna come against you he's not gonna bleed okay he know because you don't believe it yet so you don't Bluff you hey man I'll make you proud every every it's a grin you stand all you wanted to prove it yes sir praise God see so then when we could catch the revelation we could say we are one with God he is the vine I'm the branch his life is flowing through me and I'm strong by faith because he has given me his strength virtue amen he's giving me knowledge and through knowledge state now I know where yet now the prophet has taught me amen through knowledge I know where I'm standing at Satan I know that God has carved me has elected me come to that place to get the Wreckers tan there and know that God is going to add to my faith hurt you in knowledge and temperance and patience and kindness and brotherly kindness and then the love of God God let's all say he's gonna do it but Steve said well you don't feel a thing now that's all right I also have noticed that the faith is to grow amen amen praise God it's all right Satan live where I'm strong by faith and said I lies because I had his wisdom amen I'm redeemed I had his Redemption I'm sanctified I have this sanctification get back Satan you see them back up I have love I have peace I have joy I have meekness humility the seat is in me Satan I have it now all i gotta do seconds to go forward and put this sort of the spirit out there as right now having now and possessing now amen is that right brain yes sir amen then when we do that right now now see in the faith works in the spiritual realm so when faith Christ in you said let there be see you me now in the spiritual realm it begins to happen people are doing it keep on doing it keep on doing it pretty soon it begins to manifest itself out here in the census praise God pretty soon love begins to take all the emotion take over fection praise God faith begins to take over reason amen the characters of God take over your own character takes it completely over brings every heart every high thought that exalted gifts caught bring it to captivity the word bring all those crazy doctors bring into the Word of God ever powers their children today Amen praise God that's right can't dare our imagination to the word who does it Christ the author the finisher of our faith praise God whether it be power love joy knowledge we possess it we say I got it now Amen see then when we begin to act on it Christ ahead becomes manifest in and through the body then you see him living I didn't say solder people have come here and said so I hope you got there you maybe you don't see it they see it and the Lord knows that you don't see it here but he sent a witness amen praise the Lord amen Satan is a liar and the powder of it amen Christ has conquered for he said he is the author and the finisher of the faith but faith must possess its positions my positions is to be loved peace and joy and all these thing about I have to possess it see now he says a strong illusion through unbelief he says that we are carnal right now he said your carnal see it says so now either I can believe through unbelief in the power of evil or I can believe by faith in the power of God see the power evil that he's strong it in Christ because Christ is a strong man it's for coming to the house and buying him up so which pile is working which which had the strength excuse me so thus saint seiya carnal thus in actual experience we feel and we see carnality until we turn our unbelief around see and begin to say bowling be it unto me according to thy word amen be it unto me according ah that word take a merry now Gabriel staying after that you Mary are highly favored me Oh women you Mary say you said you must be crazy Mary right at the same time zoom in at same time this gave you a speaking of prophetic message you want to bring forth the Christ his name shall be called wonderful counselor mighty God everlasting father a man she knew of the scripture she'd read it many times but I'm going to a puppet to myself I'm going to because a prior to my life seed can I plant here gable says yes Satan says no so somebody had to move forward that was the our payment that was the Podesta nated second of god that that seed Mary had to speak only and she said unto me according to thy word God amen when she said that something unseen begin to happen unseen come created a blood telling her you don't know what she said being on to me according to thy word Holy Spirit a camera the hosts unseen begin to brood over in her body begin to ask tell on sale amen sell the cell sell until the beginning to grow informed into Jesus Christ Mary has spoken Boni by faith and the bride stands in the same spot a prophetic message by the angel says you are the one come out little Eagles God has called you to bring forth Jesus Christ me yes you out of all the Pentecostals yes Beth that's me yes God calls you but my mother was a pentacle thats all he calls you Carl you as an individual calls you up so you've got to say be done to me according to thy word before has the horse break here do one thing until you speak it up be it under me hey men so then we say well then we are dead he meant and our lives is hid with Christ in God you gotta say it now yes sir see this now this is the diner on the cross of course this is the law of new life death life death life now you go through your sufferance now the trials and purges and so forth see but now we believe that we are now now Moses a type you know of this here because one type all believers say God is Almighty God can do this God can do that God can do so so but how many say god is almighty and me haha how many say God can do so or so God could do this God could do that in me how many can say that how many can say such as I have I'll give unto the you rise up in the name of Jesus Christ how many of you say it see Amen see their lives the essence of Moses controversy with God at the burning bush God was saying come now I will send you down to deliver my people see Moses was replying I believe that you can and that you will do it for me I can't do that amen that was molten see now God's power was not in question for Moses knew that God could do it but what wasn't question was where the guy would do it through him amen soy is a day what is in question we know that God can do because he did it he was prophet hey man we've seen him do it to his prophet he believed it he had the faith to believe that you know many people say what brother Prem has vision so for that may had more faith and all to put together do you realize in 1962 there he had the goat and tell everybody that he was gonna open to seven singles that's exactly right didn't even have that vision yet because in December by faith he said that I'm going to preach one of seven seals way 62n right by faith he said so then in December he had that great visitation to go out west but by faith he said that there's deer the Cochino by faith Amen see now it was Moses appropriation and his obedience see on faith that hung in the balance so it is today obedience and whether we will because appropriate what God has sent see amen now when Moses did go forth amen the scripture says his obituary by faith Moses cross the Red Sea amen he did it by faith by faith Rahab by faith law everybody did it by faith then we must do it by faith because if they would write a little bit longer longer then it would say you what's faith by faith you recognize Christ in His Prophet by faith you move that sixty three or four back there because the Prophet spoke it you said that is the will of God I don't know how it won't be authority that have a spoke many things you by faith believe it amen by faith you moved under that anointed that annoying stuff to see you see that I understand it but I'll stand with him being on the Mia coordinate our Lord amen you have already moved out don't even know it an anointing come down pulled you out of there just come on come along with me I'm the unseen captain you just moved along all confidence haven't you moving along anyway hey by faith if they were to add to be brutal living it would say the bride in the end time fine hey in the Word of God to live it to the prime mover Hey received a man like because Rebecca back you didn't even know the man but they heard his words amen and they said I will go without even question it told a pastor and a church Bigley banning them see I will go that right that's what she did by faith she did it see Amy so Moses by faith went all down Israel he was baptized into the burning bush first of course and he met the Word of God amen praise the Lord so therefore most had all the qualities in him and then God annoyed those qualities at the burning bush he knew he was supposed to do it you know he tried to do it before in the flesh we've done many flesh works I'm trying to do it Lord that's alright so go ahead I'm trying too hard go ahead and say but one day that anointing strikes it then it just falls back hey man it knows who it is I was back there when the sons of God shouted for joy praise God it's being how it's being revealed to you wisdom comes to you see and wisdom brings understanding amen see understanding brings your knowledge and then because first they come to your faith is rate to strength the next one is knowledge see then through knowledge you say well all this is for me you call me God see he says yeah and you say well for the joy amen that's it before me it's the promise that just the future home of the Brian - Brian all this joy it's it right before you Amen by vision amen it gives you understanding then no matter what happens to you saffron's child persecutions for the joy that was set before me by the seven seals I got a vision get back Satan get back amen you get the breaststroke amen hey hey you have to swim this Bristol for look for are we floating right now amen he will quicken the pace soon and you begin to swim there move on out amen that's now here's a knowledge your eyes eyes is the faith of the unknown understand I said it's a heart all right when he brings you through all of these trials like Shadrach and Emma Daniel the first thing you get is wisdom understanding that right see gives you wisdom first wisdom is a revelation of God and Paul said how big I'll speak wisdom on to mature people all right not to babes mature people because babes take the wisdom and get no hard and get all puffed up amen but mature people sit right there and see or read a car just drink it in a man they're growing they're adding you add by knowledge that's why Paul said that I made know him yet to know him as eternal life st. John 17:3 to know him is eternal amen and then when you know him you begin to know his you begin to partake of his divine nature so st. Peter and right now by adding him in he's the word coming in now so you don't see it but Mary didn't see nobody standing either play it was growing hey man so therefore from the time by faith Moses spoke nowhere to got with Authority and was uncomfortable couldn't conquer him he knew amen so therefore Mary did the same thing and what about the bride today we say bye hey we do it see now remember I want to hurry up I won't keep it too long I want to drive that thought home to you now remember fate so you understand right now see faith begins by being a laborer and we get the scripture for that Hebrews 4:11 I want to give you the word for that let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief so now labor let us be eager to know this rest to know him see he is the rest see let us make every effort to enter in excuse me let us be stillness and exert ourselves to strive see to me now it's also it's also called a fight sing of first Timothy 6:12 he calls it a fight fight the good fight of faith lay hold put your hands on it hey man it's substance you know lay hold on it see you got a whole other thing lay hold on eternal life we're into the our call and has professed a good profession before many witnesses so now our faith the author Christ begins seed form as a laborer as a faint now everybody in there any Old Testament they fought and never receive the promise well think of you oh you have been ordained to fight and receive the promise in the flesh in the last days the sons of God shall be made manifest he shall reveal unto the sons of God the glories of God now that's our charge we call for that that's right you you're fighting now right now you're leaving now but you're coming into something like capstone you would see stem c4 so therefore you'll be happy when it actually happens you said thank God labor our fourth through sixty two three four five I was assaulted by the enemy but I cut up a press for I persisted like we are the heroes back there in the Bible they pour it on berrak and all the make it because getting on all of samson all of them amen they never received the promise it's for the end time for you the bride and there's something frames for take on it now and it is consummated in a rest philippians 2 16 praise our God hey the word of life that I may rejoice when in the day and hey capstone day in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain amen see and now watch then this is to say that off I'll call it the first stage from say 63 up to now is the first stage of your faith see there's a finish also this because because beginning and a finish and you won't partake of both of them Amen that's right these signs shall follow them that believe the Jawa of the harvest shall be with you oh yeah that's coming that's the power of God it's coming the fruit ripens in the top of the tree it's gonna be in you praise God see now the faith the first stage of your faith is always the battle so Beryl all the way through your Bibles of valency of taking hold by the will by the heart in the knowledge of God's promise now brother Branham brought us knowledge of the promises of God and we see it first a wisdom because comes down because revelation wisdom wisdom strikes the heart and gets understanding the wise shall know their God that's what's called the wise virgins the wise shall know know that God he's the word a hey man and do mighty exploits when they know who he is first but they want to do that exploit they can without knowing him first you gotta know his will hi he works first see now so the battle is taking hold now see of God's promises right now now watch see which is not listen to these very words the the promise is not real to you now in experience it's not real that's the whole idea and that's where satan captcha where he's away you don't have this love now you heard that before right right around here you ain't got it where's your power you ain't got none even know the will of God they don't even know that they are to apprehend this see that they are to move on and show this fight this faith first not expect God soon as the prophet go off the seemed to be in the flesh and pour out his Holy Spirit upon top of it no sir you could had a fight he didn't say that there he's to him that endure to the end better write him to press us on so a lot of people didn't want to press on they ain't got nothin ain't nobody got enough there's that unbelieving devil right there get away from me Satan I don't want to even see him nowhere because God has given us faith to pass on he's give us an understanding heart to know the knowledge of God to know who we are and what we're doing they don't know what they're doing therefore they want power to do how to do your glory of God no sir powers in you see it's a sea is growing they don't know that see but we move on anyway now okay so therefore just it this truth promise is not real to us now in experienced sea but we declare it to be ours in spite of all our appearances then right all right the farmer farmer says that he's got a wheat field he sees a bleed he said I don't care what you say I have a wheat field in spite of all appearances he's got a wheat field all right next thing you know he's got a little tussle he said in spite of all all appearances in spite of this Carlos state I have a wheat field I hit coming up amen didn't the shuck comps he said that's not it there it's on the inside damn it it's still coming then when it finally gets to that stage after the latter report on top of it gets green yeah yeah it's milky needs to be dried out but in spite of that green appearance in 65 and so forth 56 in spite of that green appearance being sticky and milky see that was still a weak field God says touch not mine do my prophets no longer my anointed ones the little ones out there that is my week they're all right and anybody comes against it there'll be like touching because ten million volts that's right that's his wheat his little wart see so now the author of the faith by faith plant a seed in your hearts for the foundation of work he knows where they are he throws the water upon it and he's gonna bring that seed to maturity at the end so it grows right on down see a lot is growing is going through something experiences it has many adventures let's calm because adventures alright adventures that's what it has plenty of experiences and so forth now so therefore we do not appear to be dead but see but and because we come unto sin and live unto God but we are because we appear but we are told to believe it the Prophet said believe it he said in order for you to get the D talking you it must be told because obedience to every word in all of you to receive a token now so therefore when we dare to believe it and you got to because of declaring like Mary did she said be done to me you gotta say it see they think you're nuts like right now I hope you got there right now we have the audacity to declare that we have the Holy Ghost in us and all around us they said you have got nothing Amy do you hope you see it now you see it unbelieving devil that rather bleed at you have a guy then then believe because you have it now where's the faith that see what you're facing now that's unbelief that comes into your midst ain't nobody got to save became about I got this over here says unbelief when he has come and quicken every word through the Bible life he's pours Brun into every word and you break one word you don't see it then what you did while you liver yeah because you'll be judged later on but you already did you have judgy homes all right thing for you broke one word your books are prophets message see them in them you break it there nothing happens to you go on you get blessed in his permissive will sure because you feel the holy fish sure it's all right but when that seed that does believe it comes out into maturity then when you begin to look for that over there yes judgment over there see it believe it now amen see praise the Lord so therefore Slayton like he's doing now will assault you oh he'll sort your faith and sometimes you fall down good Joshua did see because because akin unbelief in the camp don't believe it don't believe the promises of God God said it it belongs to me they don't believe it they got to see with their eyes they got to be in a holdout of hallelujah and got to feel it and see it when they're not realizing that it is by faith you get it because Hebrews 11 by faith because you apprehend it because of probated to yourself you're staying on that ground each piece of ground you my face they don't understand that now see it's another spirit spirit of Church Eve spirit looking for new life see no unbelief will say it is not so and belief will say shut up unbelief it is so and do not they'll get mad at you oh they will actually get mad at you for saying because it is so because they don't believe it is so and then they will exert employ every effort to go and prove to your people that isn't that so and then you come right back and employ and exert and strive every effort to prove it is all amen praise God by the sword of the Spirit amen do you see you in a death struggle see right now spiritual wickedness right here on earth here see amen so therefore Joshua in Israel they got up he says don't pray Josh we get up sit in the camp get up from there Oh pray models top right and get the center see when you get the sin out then you see something happened then see now as we follow in the footsteps of those who by faith and patience waited because to inherit the promised see something begins to happen within you don't see you see but it begins to happen with him now right now the son his presence is doing something within horses in what then is outlet I hope you can see baby grows in the mother you don't see but see the form of it that's what the prophets son and wife sees the form of it inside I hope you got there posted our labour and travail then Christ be formed in you our prophet brings on labor pains he Labor's travails with the bracket to edit until crisis form and when a seed is taken whole practicals off the scene and let that seed begin to fight the good fight of faith begin to labor hey men labor to bring forth that job Jesus Christ I hope you get it fresh is he getting through to you amen praise God see there for the spirit will cooperate he's waiting to do it the son said it is so and down he comes a refreshing breeze comes down a man and begins to cooperate with the word the word said it the holy spread brings it to pass his presence is doing it right now shaping and molding a bride through trials and also adversities and because persecutions see now then to our faith is added because assurance blessed assurance and assurance is when you head it and then you it begins to add to your faith and uh because knowledge and so for all this added seeing now then as it's being added as you're laboring as you're fighting in the first stage of your faith see as you're doing these things here it comes on you unconsciously it's an unconscious growth you're just going everyday but you're fighting the good fight of faith and your labor in the good fight of faith see and your labor and fighting every day see now then before you know it the constellation comes the capstone before you even know it the consummation to finish her he's the author and the finisher the Perfector a man he comes down I'm a prove it to you because by apolinaria he comes down see and comes in love and says here is the finished product and it out it goes see but first he did a work on the inside that nobody else knew what he was doing amen see then the consummation of faith has been reached this summit does the thing because you're because looking for you can't do it left I'm on top the mountain and the Prophet said when you climb up their mountain and get to the top by faith then you're break-in to powers visions glories of God up at the top of the mountain you up on the top 10 amen but you you know you got up there by experience now when he's there with you the whole brother Satan has got to get back mountain be thou removed go into the sea like Adam go over there go over there self for spoken word of God see but when you get there you'll know that you stayed with that word no matter how many Devils said that it is not so you say it is so amen see then the law of the capstone is the finish that he comes down now then what once sixty three four five six and seven eight and there it was a effort to maintain also labor for now comes easy as breathing just walking the Prophet says so there goes the statue of a perfect man loves inner faith joy is all in him yes follow what would you have me to do go on a corner with stand over at the foot thus saith the Lord if he goes stands right there he's big of it because obedience and there he stands he has all of the faith the wrapped in faith it is just in him now all I need is a trumpet blasts because it's the word pay man he hears that deadly crash raised up and so forth and in and whatever has to be happens and away you go but the thing is he's got to have perfect love and love as the capstone amen so therefore that is the law see if there's a faith there's a law of faith it's got to be fought Leoben out then finished off and then the finishing touch is Jesus Christ himself the love of God is the finishing touch then he shows you their product their dresses it all up nice here it is see and it is what it says it is to not in a false box you know that me see all just will be currently outside of me see now all the equalities is in the second stage right now and they must be in there see when he anoints it now quickly the way of the Cross this because three aspects of the way of the Cross did the atoning work which we had to which we all been through the identification with Jesus Christ the word which is right now see it died on the cross we are now identifying ourselves with the word he has come and said here's my word and we said that's the word and we do it see and in doing so we're dying on the cross on the cross see okay go quickly then when we realize through knowledge that we are because crucified with him then you could start to add something to that then the token is added then when you go on the cross and die daily see and then the token is add the life of Christ comes in as you die and because I can your own life in his life comes here see now there's an another stage see the dying of the old man this is the same second stage and the rising by power of god of the new man is an actual permit and with experience that you never forget because God did it see me now it's gotta be done on the inside first because the third stage C is more trials but that's for the outside and the third stage is to die out for others that was Jesus Christ that was the early church the okona wheat that was Paul that was william branham he told his son Paul it's not for me it's for you it ever season it because Paul said that death worketh in me but life for you I die in this body every day we if Paul died then the people could feed on the resurrected life of Christ in pause amen see we fit on the resurrected life in brother Branham as he died daily well God has ordained a few a bride to come forth soon and to die daily and to go out and that life might be seen out there the life of Jesus Christ therefore that is what we are believing here and that is what we are coming to now that's why Paul says as many as are perfect mature and have this understanding let us walk by the same rule here see amen see me now so now because in closing the first and second stage is for us as individuals the third stage is for others see he's preparing you for something he's going to show himself through you but right now in the second stage now we identify yourself with every word then every word can come down and identify itself with you and we're practically amen see which is the anointing see no oh well I'll skip this here maybe I can because pick it up later I want to get to something here now yes now we want to all overcome are you tired well 10 minutes more amen come want to strike this here I see something getting tired there so now watch to overcome we all want to overcome but we've got to have knowledge Paul said to know him see therefore dear disciples before they even become a sieve the Holy Ghost he opened the scriptures to them that right and st. Luke 24 45 he opened up the entire word to them he spoke things pertaining to the kingdom of God to them all the need now was annoying a striking song see so Christ has slipped down now and open the scriptures to us through the seven seals that right and we ant we are we appropriate that's been cut to ourselves see me now now we have to have the Murnau's in Christ see the early disciples had it I had a brother branham had it because many others had it see now we want the same I see now watch well that mine we read count of joy when you fall into divers temptations what can we do it see rejoice in your tribulation because can we do it see but they did we said well how could they rejoice is a revelation it's a revelation now you got to have revelation when the early church got a revelation to sell their goods get now somebody else didn't get that revelation therefore they only so part of it because I handed pot the money but those who sold it turn all the money in the revelation hey man pick up a nasa sapphire so what they did imitate it is what will because we'll keep back part of it no no revelation trying to do it see and what have the holy spirit out i hope you read me hey man prays along please a revelation so can enjoy and these things is a revelation they had this revelation and that's what god is bringing us up to now you right here he's bringing to a revelation that you counted joy to fall into divers temptations for we assure you because by the word this morning now see we want to know him and the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his suffering now do you want to know those things and if you really want to know there's a joyful thing to know because it's a joy amen the Fellowship of his sufferings it's a joke that's exactly right see but we got to come to that our minds got understand out there we have to get over these little petty things here a man thing so now we got to know the true method of facing handling me and using for good see all forms of it adversity that's thinking we've got to know the truth method how to handle how to face and how to use every evil thing hey hope he gets more than friends then you can enter into another realm yesterday was in and around and so would you could brother branham they were they walk in a spirit of faith to me is up higher but God said you want to come up there do the Word of God he will show it to you see what I'm saying we gotta know the true method of facing handling and using for good now it says on the word Romans 8:28 all things that write evil or good works together for good to them that love God amen on the try see if you get it say Amen praise the Lord see now okay all experiences of what we call evil like you know shocks suffering difficulty disaster unjust because treatments if you were to get a shock at the service this morning say man now you would know if your spiritual that it works together for good it's my was the shock e with some bad news or something like that you said well praise God just heard the because preachers say that it works together for good so they don't happen to you this morning they say Amen now the key see our evils watch this now our evils are never happenings happenings in themselves see but the effect that we allowed them to have on us there is the trouble the thing it is subacute harm you but their fear that we get against them it tears you to pieces can't sleep can't eat can't praise god can't sing can't sit down I can't read the Bible can't pray their back Tonya of evil amen take it in now I'm driving home now so you get died there you see me now I like when you start out we have unity here you to yourself is the lubricated because of the machine the machine was the Word of God you gotta have that because to begin with and you want to become lubricates it and in having unity you got to die people have all kind of odd habits strange behaviors you know things like that there and because of Georgia in the beginning see but you got to look and what little statue of Christ is in them and say well praise God for that little bit I see there and don't look at the remote that is a be manana you got to think that Christ and His love takes care of yours more waiter come so therefore the Lord let me love you like you love me see see me now no matter how flesh he looks no matter if it it was old or whatever it is do you mean now no matter what it is he brings us all together different tongues and dialects and so forth different strange mannerisms I myself used to be a person used to watch every little thing because you do before I would say I had I couldn't stand certain things see them in now so there God had to beat all it out of me I'll watch everything I because I have it with me I got to see what's in there what's over there what's over there i watch everything but now he uses that praise the Lord see well that's we are wise you guys are driving my poor wife crazy what's this here what's this over there so forth on see see see but now see but see God used that as that's in the nature Amen see but then you begin to overcome no matter what he does or what he does what about what I'm doing this because up because up because that because an office also what God in His love takes away mind it is old time a man in his own time see when he wants to so we guys say well Lord God let thy will be done see so therefore in a place like that there you begin to mold you together and he said but this so how can you understand this person keep on doing this thing great sin grace does more about we said so whole I don't believe in here there's more grace than race car it'll take care of it it'll mold it and shape it into a unit lubricated by unity and they'll come and see it amen there still be those who are raised up sorry I love them I can't do nothing because it's established and God has set the thing there he put the oil in there the lubricating on the unity it's moving on through every part of machine every part of worried amen praise the Lord see so now therefore see we allowed the effect to tear the pieces this person speaks this way or as a fleshie behavior whatever it is see because it kills you see me now that's for purpose it is to kill you the die on the cross swears for amen see squares for and then thereafter why it keep all coming to keep all coming well it stopped doing they want to stop saying that there see he will keep sitting it until you say Lord I love my brother and my sister he'll keep order do you say that keep on doing I love you priest guy it's all right then he does it you even see it all you see Jesus on the cross amen now you're being perfected now are you growing up Christ all kind of things bother him brother branham what did he see brother see but he went on hey man praise the Lord see now see the evil in itself because the happenings that's not the trouble is what we allow it to because the effect on us see now every experience is good or evil see that's right see now fear and doubt makes it evil but trusts such as good pitch trusting God it's alright because Romain 8:28 says so it'll work together for me am I good therefore if it's evil it's gonna be for my good hey man hey hey man all right one example Calvary let's take him there was Jesus Christ as Savior he faced the most evil thing that could be done there right it was an outward experience that right it was Satan's scheme it was an evil thing what Christ did he waver do see he had a in what attitude of faith amen praise God see which declared that that evil was good see he rejected the temptation to call that evil evil said it's good he said because he said is not my will is his will then if it's God's book everything God does is good then right for us so therefore now watch Christ didn't it when if you read through st. John 12 13 14 all through there you don't even mention Satan Harley and st. John 14:30 he says the prince of this world cometh hath nothing there me a man oh praise God he has no claim on me no power over me all right he has nothing to do with me nothing in me the prince of this world cometh here so he spoke to his disciples with joy with love and told all these wonderful promises all right and knowing he's gonna face this evil but he turned the evil around for good who's good out good for save this hello say that evil was good because it brought us salvation so that trial suffering for Christ adversity was to our good that evil hope you get it the other star friends say Amen praise God well then there's no evil that God can't turn around make it good then rent Satan made a fierce attack on his body outside see but faith his faith make it impossible for Satan to touch inside God was in there hey the body had to go through those things there see Peter come along and said that it was God's determinate counsel beforehand his foreknowledge that this had to be she let me know now adversities and sufferings see our instruments of Satan but now watch today right now we are we understand that but if my faith we can turn it around hey men turn into blessings amen I'm trying to show you the early church I'm trying to show you brother brother and we I believe come to that point now we're facing something and we're gonna have to end that what is that's that's what it means to be fully matured and grown up to have the mind of Jesus Christ to know him to know that nothing because God said it was good everything is good see so therefore because God because God create evil to turn it back around to work for you that's his way so when you know him through knowledge didn't you understand then you don't have any qualms then see you know you understand God because you know him right now then we see that we turn it around is something to be used in in faith to turn it against Satan see now then if we have the understanding then this revelation that evil is good because of our benefit then we count a joy to pour into divers temptations we rejoice in our tribulations amen this show Gaby revelation praise the Lord Amen we use them as special opportunities to see the manifestation of God's power is only when you can become weak that he's strong it's only but you have to you have to become weak Christ had to become weak then the strength come the power of God so when we become in our we can condition can't do nothing then he shows forth his power amen and his disciples and went out trials adversities the power of God rested upon them amen see we are facing that now see now so therefore if we understand this here we face it not to merely it because endure it as a judgment or trial then it's like weary heart another trial all the help me Lord pray for my brother going through I'm going through I'm going through see me now another one the early church what it says hey God we were beaten this is the word now you want the word they read just because they was whipped they were bullwhipped amen and think of it we just in being beaten for the Lord telling it worthy I'm trying to show you that our Dane elected few who walks on that third stage oh yeah many say I am identified with you on the cross Lord then the next day something happened in the next day I'm identified you lacrosse Lord but this stage diet daily every day I live in your diet the brother brand died every day Paul every day don't early disciples you know why there's a reason for there there's a spiritual law of harvest a corner wheat must die and it brings forth 100 folk fruit that's why cinnamon now the early church which was a corner wheat had to die to bring forth us if we you see it not they had to die every day and people outside saw the life of Christ and they come to Christ see it now see so therefore that's what is going on now now their knowledge the truth will change a weak spot in our armor our fare to face trials and sufferings when the truth comes you know turn that around and you say wait a minute you mean that to know him this is the mind of Christ and this is the will of God now with the sister yes yes this is the will of God you said well wait a minute back Satan hey I'll rejoice in every trial I'll rejoice it because every judgment every test from this day on because I received the knowledge of God this morning that I can turn this around see by faith turn it back up on Satan and swallow him up just like Moses because stick did amen Moses because he threw Hannah Snickers a surfing throughout his because yes damn breeze serpent also the mold he didn't run and then he stood there and he waited by faith because you know God sent him something what happened the guy sent me here then pretty soon they begin to swallow them up amen and you swallow up every trial amen but think what happens to you some more weight come off amen lay aside every weight some more weight comes off it comes off here God knows it's on there so he prunes it off to a trial which works out I hope you seen you the light afflictions works were far more exceeding great wave glory for you there reference then that when I get the because truth of it then it becomes an adventure of adversity what's the next one Laurie got the sword spear drawing out the helmet on this plate armor teach I with the gospel coefficient of peace now ready I'm ready for the next battle yes sir so put the sword out there it's a an adventure with the law he's already conquered everything up there every trial he's conquered already he want you to go into it possess it hey men praise God see it's the adverse condition that ripens the wheat come on a man therefore if you don't you ain't no wheat then do we just lays in it it's lays and in the hot Sun don't say back a word just lay right on him say go on into his trials now don't be cold because don't utter nothing amen now we won't see your powerful church here brother yeah for this morning amen amen yes hey man Satan will move back some more yes sir praise God wow we are firing it is steps we turning the child into victory amen return a separate of victory victory victory shall be mine yes sir that's why why how through marriage of the son of the Living God he's dropped down and brought some wisdom in their revelation understanding comfort to the heart Lord now I see I once was black now I understand heart yes I'm pair with the Spirit of God and away you go a child of suffering that's working to my good praise be to our God God turn Satan's scheme evil into our good what if you did it for Jesus he'll do it for you praise God amen to the knowledge of God we see the glorious purpose of God hope you see this morning the Apostle saw it brother Branham saw it Paul saw it is a revelation then you can say to know him account everything loss and a palace resurrection and also the Fellowship of his sufferings his revelation trips we've got to come to you God must reveal it to your heart see then the acceptance all right now watch see the acceptance and and the endurance of every thing becomes your victory amen now watch if God's gifts are our blessings and the devil's of salt also our blessings all right think right now then what remains amen to harmless or to because depresses up never left his gifts is blessings Satan's of thirst he turns him around by faith interpreter II amen praise God then what can happen what can separated from the love of God trials persecution Thomas evil-speaking they touched me nothing no I'm never been a conqueror through all these things here Amen praise God though right friends so therefore we rejoice always we give thanks always when the trial comes off paint the only Heavenly Father to turn this into it a victory and to my good then go on through it then yes sir amen praise the Lord yes sir see now all right then if good is good amen and if if Eagle if evil is equally good to the enlightened to those whose eyes has been anointed when I said to see this understand this here see then there's a realm of life that I must live in now another one then that's the one that Christ lived in that the early apostles lived in that they want all the heroes of faith live that faint up there that brother branham living in himself see me now see hope you get is another realm of life then if this is being spoken to me this morning this must be soon ready to come to pass because God will tell you waking ready to do a man hoping it now the spirit wants pick it up now you know he's showing you that no matter what's happening now is yours the evil no matter what Satan can do is going to work to your good good is good and evil is good amen praise Aloha to the enlightened now the babes I'm going through I'm going through see me not dig one still stagger down there but Dan with love you reach down to the weak ones come on up brother build him up in love edifying there's something good to him semen no that's all right stay with it praise God a man up because you cannot pray for your brother amen see give him a word of exhortation fill them up in the faint there are weak ones amen No therefore we rejoice always give thanks all the time thank God when you say thank God the delegate for man because he can't bring in his delusion yeah see me bring no spirits or I'll make you all weary and depressed look at that's the devil tell me now but if you are rejoicing always for every trial I don't mean go around laughing now you don't me see a man see but see to me it means that we are just about ready for Christ to move us up doc did the ordained ones into another sphere see and to me that is the way of the Cross I just tried to bring to you what has been going on now to bring up to the point the third stage where you die daily live for others bring forth 100 fold fruit right then possession of you got it right there see me now because dear disciples excuse me they enjoy the fruit of Christ's death and the Fellowship of his sufferings all right yes sir now in closing then death work it in me see but life and you concept so the only thing in the hit right in the Bible if therefore as many as be perfect you see because full-grown now have this mind understand this here and move forward from here look every trial that we've had had to be God knew before the foundation of the world that somebody would be cholai against you top against you he know it well he won't see if you could take it and still love that person see he want to see that if you can hear something that will shock you that you won't see the good in it see me now so now if you can understand these things we've come to another realm and he's shown you in the natural the wheat he shows you it because because by the wheat he shows you by the astronauts and all these things here that we've come in we've come now to another place he said win the bribe brother man when the bride can't get to that place Oh what he said when she can finally labor it and hide him to get there and you here you're here by the grace of god you're here when she can get there we sit in and watch it go yes sir then watch your go didn't watch something come on longer now pal the Living God is why there'll be such a baptism of the Holy Ghost you're taking into the clouds that's right but now is she is all her parts working amen is the love the faith the knowledge the patience the temperance the godliness of brotherly is it working is it working all alike because of Paula nine here see it's been because they even took her Paula nine this and shook it all around shook it five three times in to make sure but it helped she helped a man she's been to a whole lot but she's there I believe with all of them either bride is at the door for Christ the capstone and his dynamics because he had already slipped in already with the word capstone but his dynamics the fruit in the top of the tree having faith in the beginning as heaven and possessing finally realizing it the reality of it and when that happens it comes as natural as breathing walking around a living temple of God amen that's what you have come to a friend that's what I'm trying to show you this morning you have a little trial a little suffering whatever it is somebody speak against your speed that doesn't mean nothing at all what means do I know him amen shall we stand praise I've got the gate to take up so much time but I just want the Coloma heart to get this to you so that you should have faith to look for it now it's coming see brother Branson that stayed in the word the right word the right thing is to be done it's going to have we don't know how to help what's going to happen somebody God is preparing somewhere in this world there's some vessels that's been prepared by the word to receive something amen I'm believing this right here that's why I'm here that's why I'm laboring and fighting along with you I'm believing that it is you this all is of course your well I got because they believe here because this is where Maxine and so therefore these little letters and things tokens is God's tokens to you let you know that he went and got his a prophet son and wife and family and sent them here for saying I hope you understand that see they just wouldn't come here now because Billy Paul told me that the this many places because sit there Brad because she hadn't gone away to come here see the Lord symptom here and they wouldn't come otherwise now people they don't want to hear me say this but I can't help that I have to say that CNN Oh so therefore the thing to do now is to no matter what you hear no matter what shocks you here don't question anything grow up and say well okay fine no matter what they tell you whatever they what you hear or whatever it is see be mature now Paul says see and receive all these things like the Jesus Christ did it become brother Ram did it's it's been in a phase meant oh they had a in with faith see and I in with faith has come to these six years in now see and brother Brown Elisha brought on the countdown the countdown is here now zero hour we are now ready to enter in April the seven year of the zero hour is this the year after labor in six years hey man then we can walk into that rest and then just stop laboring and frightened and just walk amen I don't know I don't see it is but I'm saying is this the the seventh year coming up I don't know see buddy's been since 63 see but I'm praying to God with all my in me that because it is to retire we're weary hey man but nevertheless if we have to go to 77 whatever it is and we all still march on by the grace of God but I just believe firmly in my heart that something is fixing to happen I'm believes gonna happen right in this assembly with people right in here I believe that according to our faith according to the word be it unto you yes sir friends I believe that otherwise I wouldn't have stand up here and sweat and preach yes sir and I've seen I thank God for them I thank the Lord for every trial every suffering that I had to go through I thank him down at the end he come and give me the revelation why it is because he because you call to it see everybody's not call to that you know so therefore if you are called to it paint God for it see is a it's a very high calling so then you realize it is a high quality press toward the mark the goal of it see me now and we come right down to the goal the capstone is the goal see and he lines it up by the cross so stay at that cross stay there so the capstone coming right in there see you now the prophets message because tonight the restoration of the bride sheet I will restore staying for more you nobody gonna stop me and I'm even gonna show it out in the natural the fruit is doing a little bit in the top of that tree the fourth stage nor Lynn amen the 11 praise be to God let's bow at brother crew
