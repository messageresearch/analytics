is the faith Jude Jude three beloved when I give all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was not needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly it was needful rather for me to write unto you and exhort you in my eyes I can't see too good that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints now when was the faith and what is it and when was it delivered okay we'll find out amen kind of give a background here I don't know what the Lord won't have me do contending for the faith in Zurich Switzerland 1955 6:20 now when the faith was first introduced to the world the faith that were earnest to earnestly contend for John the Baptist introduce it now preach on this 1992 some of you may remember it contending for the faith restored back by Malachi 4 may be remembered in June maybe you don't a man he to earth to contend for John the Baptist introduced it he introduced Jesus to the world and Jesus introduced the faith now let's go back and see what faith he introduced to the world and then we'll see what we're talking about now he did not claim to be a healer if Jesus did not claim to be a healer then how can some man claim to be a healer when Jesus was questioned he said it's not me to do it the works but my father that dwelleth in me the man that the healer is garnet wells in the man hey man praise God God just healed Brotherhood sure hey man [Applause] it's not me and do it the works but my father told them me may be seated so he has nothing to do with it it was God the Father in him that did the work when he was baptized with water by John they bear record that God coming like a dove and going in him then when Jesus went forth to preach great crowds come to him he began to work miracles among them his fame went way abroad that's when he said it's not me but the Father that doeth the works so they are so therefore John the Baptist introduced it then Jesus did the works of his father and then he introduced Jesus to the world and Jesus introduced the faith the faith amen now what faith did he introduce to the world signs wonders miracles the works of the father and the life of God the same spirit the same from the Father that's what he introduced it was the logos in him hallelujah it was same Elihu same God yes siree that Jonathan spoke about last Sunday night that great mighty God same one is here this morning say won't touch you same I want to see you want to heal you praise God glory to God a man may be seated and Jesus Christ was the first administrator of the faith that we should get 10 for amen now could write on the same day continuing for the faith 55 same same one again let me go back here page 8 here okay earnestly contend for the faith Chicago that's what on 1955 12 or 123 January now the faith that was once delivered to the Saints what was it the Spirit of Christ in the Apostle is that right the Spirit of Christ in the Apostles we have often called the book they're excellent apostles that was wrong it's the acts of Christ in the Apostles because they were men but they had the same faith now the Spirit of Christ in the Apostles which was was which what was doing that 33 years later Jude said continually and his saying is more hold on don't stop earnestly continually contend for the faith may be seated I will give all diligence to write unto you to exhort you to stir you up in other words brother Branham said that you would earnestly earnestly contend persist holding on God said soul there's going to be an Apostolic Church that this identity raised up I shall be sealed and a bunch of wimps praise God ready to run one mind bound they gon contend persist what do you think I'm doing I'm an example in front of you sick wearing I'm contending

is God people in other words that you would earnestly earnestly contend keep holding out keep holding on for the same faith that was delivered to the Saints does your church believe that this one does since 1963 this church has been continuing for that faith praise God him and let the well know you can tell the world about this you can tell the nation's about that but you tell on that this church believes that we that deep faith has been restored back by Malachi 4 and that's what we are contending for and seven thunders gives us faith to contend for the faith [Applause] hallelujah does your church believe that yes if it does is continuing for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now now do you understand what I'm doing up here do you understand you you in the basement do you

apostles amen glory to God hallelujah praise his wonderful name Oh hallelujah Laury Laury yes sir oh man believe from the heart believe from the heart just Villa 1957 page 16 now I have begin to think this that it is possible they went a man like the Apostles and when you can live so close to God and God through His grace operates through you that the more God you get the more godly you become the more eternal life comes in the more of the intellection it pushes out don't more consecrated the more praying a man the more preparation the more God comes in praise God and watch I've seen the work and to think that if you get in contact with God it becomes too it isn't your voice anymore it's not your thought anymore it becomes God's thought and God's voice you're just a vane just a pretty severe and it's his spirit that goes in and energizes as long as you can get yourself out of the way he will fill it up and then you will be a witness like Noah's Ark was a witness Jesus was a witness the very expression he becomes so full of God till God him and God was one amen Jonathan yes sir God taught in Christ reconciling the world to himself the very expression a man's work declares his character Christ was God's work and Christ now it's character his feeling for the sick he's longing to save souls until he gave his own life God's work God's character was declared in Christ and I'm telling you today that God's life amen God's work will be declared in this church here hallelujah somebody's gonna come for somebody's gonna be sealed sometimes gonna be healed hallelujah glory to God amen once more the world will hear direct from God's voice in you the brand why it is not your thought anymore it becomes God's thought amen and God's voice then you become a witness amen acts 1:8 after the Holy Ghost on the third phase has come upon you then you shall receive power hallelujah glory didn't become my witness seventh under charity anointed paint to anoint your faith to move out and go forward to all of God's promises amen for the bride in this hour a man you may be seated yes sir church say Amen hallelujah and I you know you're gonna be a witness a man may be seated you shall be witness for God in this ungodly wicked and adulterous generation a man Revelation chapter 4 part 3 1961 January page 713 what am I saying they're closing I'll just have to let the rest of it go but in closing I want to say this because I kept you so long what's he saying here there will come a day that a wicked and a generation adulterous now remember we'll seek a sign and this is a wicked and adulterous generation and he said that generation which is this one will receive a sign and what burn binds the rest of the Bible the sign of Jonah Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days the ninth soul must the Son of Man be in the belly the earth three days and nights now what will it be the sign of the resurrection the sign of resurrection now watch we'll be done in a wicked and adulterous generation which is this one and it was done to Malachi 4 and the bride will come right back and it was done in the book of Acts Jesus raised from the dead come in 2 Peter James and John and apostles and they did this book of ax it wasn't the Acts of the Apostles it was the acts of the Holy Ghost working in the apostles and this will be done again on a third phase every demon

the Saints see but there's only one faith now Jude says we speak here primarily of course the church in that day we should arrange to contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints could you think

don't deliver us we are still not going in the world can you understand that we're still not going in the world we will not bow down to your worldly fancies of the world you're cutting the hair your makeup your this is the neck we will not bow down to that our God is able to deliver us O God is able to see this on the third phase [Applause] [Applause] Lauren [Applause] you understand it now maybe it's seen it Moses born then it was afterwards he was brought to the place forty years on the backside of running from God he couldn't give a from God there was a seed in him neither can you forty years he wasted God's time running away feeling sorry for himself praise God I didn't get that job at that position I'm not going to take any other position I know I'm scorching some hands in here I mean to me not burn the world no the fourth of the world out of you praise God until you become nothing empty yourself out you need to knock it off your high horse on a road to Damascus God knocked Paul off his high horse and we need to knock it off on a high horses and hit the dust and the moment you raise your hand above your head about that dust you're raising above God so eat the dust brother hit the sand [Music] yes sir glory to God hey man well accompany something a wild man I am a while man spiritually being a crazy praise cut there man when I worship God in a way called heresy against a bunch of church members oh okay maybe see that seem to say a man oh man oh man oh man oh man our men rekon okay Moses after he was brought to the place where he was anointed I'm trying to get you to now and notice the seal in there with the intellectual conception with all the faith that he was born to deliver the people and he had never come to life until that light from the burning bush flashed across until he's seen not something he read about but something he's seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it oh how that did bring things to laugh oh you mean if something happens when it speaks to me and I can speak back to him then that's when I get the anointing oh I see whatever the Prophet said I think any man woman boy or girl and I think in the intellectual conception of what they think the word is that's what my interesting what you think give me Bible give me a Bible give me a quote not what you feel in your mind I'm not interesting that at all I don't even listen to it well brother come on I feel it and then I'm gone right there when you feel I'm gone I know who the devil's talking right through your mind praise God yes sir brother amen I feel I feel it brother I want something to talk back to me amen and what they think the word is and so forth never can have a full foundation stand until they have met that light that brings that word to a reality so stay there until you meet that light I think no church in its practice no matter how intellectual and fundamental it might be in this message or whatever that church cannot thrive until the supernatural is made known among that people and they see it something that they can talk to that a talk back to them that have indicates this written word oh he goes on say just as we know now a man asks for a few moments about coming of the rapture and we know we lived him and we know amen then we would we live the time out the time of the ranch's at hand and we're looking for a rapt in faith that can pull the churches together and give us some supernatural strength that could change these bodies that we live in we see a God that raised the dead off the floor and he did brother Perez and brother Ortiz off the floor are out in the yard little LV Douglas from Jeffersonville 1969 both of these things were done and this church [Music] and Nellie Brisbane in the emergency room clinically dead for two and a half minutes or five minutes after she died a mother call then smoke the word and then she'd come popped up within dr.

front of me and I ran in here I did was the police and there was it had the stretcher and now because Albie was already ramped up an old gray blanket and the family was standing around and then I walked up and the Holy Spirit says pray for him and then I said sir officer would you mind if I pray for him she said well go ahead some relative or uncles they want that fool preacher from New York let them take that dead boy out here family uncle yes sir but God says pray for him women and he come back to life he had already expired [Applause] and it all Jeff Saville knows about it because the

place now what are you some unbelievable come in here and tell me something that they got some kind of feeling I just feel oh well where we ever hunt hey man we're on the firing line brother Jesus on a mainline tell them what you want hey man okay maybe see the read off the floor out in the yard life again take a cancer eat a man is shell and raise up to healthy strong man ought to give Rampton faith to the people then when that light flashes from the sky the trumpet sounds the body of Christ they quickly gather together and change in a moment taken into the heavens yes just got to be something like that amen any our schools theology can ever produce that yet they intelligent election all right you got to meet that light you got to find that something and trying to hold it down and hear Moses based on his great call upon the word and it was great until one day he met that light and the very word itself spoke back to him then he got his anointing that anointing holy spirit spoke to me a man nobody my 10 1964 Jacob graves Joseph perfection then I got the anointing not before December 26 1965 everything dead prophet gone Holy Spirit spoke back to me the shout of the king then I got the anointing to preach till to perfection under the shot of the king in the message the Holy Spirit spoke to me and somehow compassion then I got the anointing it would and went down to Georgia and around the world they don't come until you speaks to you again seven thousand seven boys have a Czech agent then I got the anointing and you can't stop it hallelujah but I got a speak and then you know when it come cuz it's God not bragging that the man don't look to the man he's he's only a chump --it not the man is a mute and she blow it this microphone as I said here is a microphone stays here but what speaks through here you take it with you you don't take me with you I'm going home and since the Coleman a man you take what I've set with you praise God hey man you maybe see Gloria had a word speaks back hey man that anointed what he had in him that on the inside the intellectuals that believed it you're doing fine you believe it but God's way to them seven thunders as your promise alters his voices then you'll get to know eighteen [Applause] yes sir a basement of faith upon his belief in him that's separate from his mother and now you need strikes in the presence of the light you know near that what he believed and you believe seven tons give faith and when charity strikes it and then it will anoint what you believe interruption Greece Oh hallelujah Moses got the anoint I am man oh brother they are you get it now friends praise God the seven thousand seven voices then you get your anointing to go forth for with the faith that's what the world needs today amen someone noted messiahs page forty s what the world needs today that's what the church needs to say that's why everyone needs a sons and their sons and daughters of God in order to be that you need a personal contact see something you know the words true all you do you know it's right but then when it contacts and then you see the thing done then you know you're on the right Road I'm traveling on the right road huh the Bible is God's roadmap Bobby pass the devil here keep going straight bypass 51 amen keep by passing by passes Amen sister Coleman that car right there with our friend swirl the car around my pants I said what was he doing here turn around no otherwise my hair forget it what a car right that was my god it must have been about ten bypasses and we were shuffling back and forth in the car I guess he was a brother hunt remember Kentucky he was driving and he stopped and was jerked back and forth by the car back and forth with he was a chiropractor I need a chiropractor what is he doing amen what it was do you know what it was he was killing a snake he saw on the road we didn't see it sure sure I said what my god amen brother all right oh my god brother hun I look up to and Kentucky

and it's a man well praise the Lord my God and brother hung come back as he thank God he got back a man yes sir okay now what do we need the church that's right that's what everyone needs I just took a little time to kind of praise God you get keyed up and relax and praise God that's why everyone needs the sons and daughters of God in order to to be that you need a personal contact that's what I'm saying you know the word is true okay whenever in any context that's right and watch it always will be scriptural you'll stand right with the scripture because the this did so praise God so seven seals seven thunders message a Malachi 4 should anoint our faith to speak and move forward it should yes sir [Applause] so this message here today it had only the faith that was in Moses and anoints us when we see that we live in the land deniz we see it to find out that all these signs that we see being taking place there spoke of in the scripture would take place in the last days all the way from heaven to the political powers to nature the people the Demark the demodulation the demoralization of the world and among the the women in hande were doing the last days in Harland a man would do and how the churches would do and how the nations would do how God would do and we see it or laying right here on us although you know it and why would you go in the world amen oh it annoys our faith it moves us out of the great cycles on a third phase we dedicate consecrate it moves us out Chuck Lorre to cut it separates us from the things of the world no matter how little we are how much of minority we are how much we laugh that made fun oh don't make a bit of difference that's all we see it there's something within us as brother been saying we were predestined needed to see this hour and there's nothing going to stop us from seeing it amen sure God has spoken it's already happened we see it or how we thank God for this Oh then it brings out your faith when you see when we see these things happening oh my speak to the people that move forward oh we could let the Holy Spirit charity it maybe see the anoint that seven thunders see within us aiming at faith see the faith see to a godly life consecrated dedicated to Christ in all things so completely surrender to God yes I speak it because it's a promise of the Brian dynamic tower mechanics gives us seventh on the charity of knowing the faith to move forward do you see it friends let me see it let me get off of here praise God okay you see it well praise God okay okay now I page 30 I hope this goes in faith doesn't look at the present time faith doesn't see this here faith does not look at your condition I don't have the Holy Ghost I need to get healed that faith don't look at that so it does not dwell in present conditions not faith now faith is the things that the evidence in substance amen our faith doesn't look at the present tense present time faith doesn't see this here faith looks to see what God wants and works accordingly that's what faith does it sees what God wants and what God wants done and faith operates through that so I had to preach through Jacob grants Joseph's affection that's how operated shouted the King I operated through them some have compassion operated through them seven thunders heaven voice that's where I buried it not what you think what this minister says but I see what God wants done my faith my revelation otherwise we will where we would you be in worrying about what someone else is saying may be seated faith look to see what God wants it and it works accordingly that's what faith does it sees what God wants and what God wants done and faith operates through that faith is a long-range vision do you understand it doesn't lose lower in sight I think it's sealed today well it don't lower in sight I get seal next Wednesday or tomorrow keep coming to church I think it healed no no no no any good shooter knows that it's long range it's a telescope it's a binocular that you don't look around here will you take binoculars you take binocular look off over there oh I see a squirrel if you don't say it'll be there I see my healing down the line speaking I'm being sealed down there not down here hey man you could tell you just look around the pews see the sad faces he you know where they looking and they're looking down you're not looking ahead other grindin appeals there see you I know who y'all hey man praise God may be seen it you don't use binoculars and look to see what time it is see you don't use it for that you look use binoculars and look away off and faith does that faith takes up God's binoculars both of them both sides and that knew in the Old Testament and sees every promise and preaches promises for 22 years [Applause] that's faith and every promise he made in faith sees it out yonder now watch and faith chooses them regardless of what the present tense says here he looks to the end so they are he don't jump his sights down to look this way he looks out yonder he keeps the crossbar I did Center on the word that's what faith does that's the faith that's in a man that does these things oh praise God thank you Jesus you see your friends how many really see it Laura all right my god therefore the seven seals seven thunders and the faith sees it out a yawn and faith chooses that with other words faith here seven you know the same time to give faith but what for for Rampton grace so what I'm doing I'm choosing wrap two degrees then just stop in here so I don't how many years 22 years now but I'm choosing raps and grapes I'm looking down there perhaps and grapes I'm not stopping here I'm not backslide not getting sad weary tired holding on holding on hold on hold on [Applause] regards are what the present tense here says seventh son of faith looks to the word for to the end for revenue in Greece you may be seated so I am looking to the end for Rampton grapes I don't know what you're doing but that's what I'm doing if I have to appreciate appeals I'm gonna preach it appeals seven thunders give you faith for raps and grapes amen so your minds won't know it so faith look to see what God wants done and works accordingly there are many heroes of faith but I want to close out with David yeah finally got him glory hey man now David is that his older brother Iliad whatever his name is what are you doing a pee naughty boy Dave's Oh what have I done what have I done I see the Philistines this great big Goliath giant challenging the Living God and you my eldest brother ask me whatever what am i doing up here I left for keeper with the Sheep I left some elders there they got the Sheep and I come in brotherly kindness to bring you some cheese and something to eat huh what do you mean what am i doing up here come on maybe it's edik come on my older brother you know when Samuel looked at you said no not God said not you next elders a brother you know that God didn't choose you either and the next one the next one guy didn't choose you you know my older brother God chose me he chose me so of course you got unbelief you wonder what am i doing it you know I'm anointed [Applause] so why are you asking me you know that God annoying me for this job but you can't do it Saul can't do it Israel you scamp shaking in your boots nothing you can do it I'm not afraid of this uncircumcised Philistine how dare challenge the army of the Living God how dare any demon of lust or filth or whatever how dare you challenge God's people praise God we shall cast out Devils Loreena cart hallelujah hallelujah glory to God what have I done is it not a cause huh why are you coming against the thunders what have I done they all did interpretations what have I done isn't that a cause if somebody should step out here and challenge these intellectual Giants and the Phyllis and demon powers in the people hallelujah glory so that situation that David faced Goliath represented intellectual head knowledge we're tall above everybody huge giant big powerful in the word in the quotes know everything praise God a man in the Phyllis and was a demon powers second Timothy three binding the people church members got them all engineers demons Philistines hallelujah Oh lovely for this and lesson for that the Philistines are pouring you Samson hallelujah come on now the full signs are your personal demons in your closet the class is in the heart hallelujah but I tell you there's one here today my god I reach into your closet and pulled every Philistine out of there hey man and there was Goliath binding Israel God's people their king their army will bound it seemed like they was not convinced look like Saul and the Army in Israel were not convinced by present tense revelation that God was with them well why was he shaking if they knew that God was there they knew that God across the Red Sea open a seal they know what Moses did down in Egypt they do that and it had all the promise of what God was going to do huh amen well then why couldn't God the same when they open the Red Sea up same one that's gonna put him over here in New Jerusalem I like this here all these promises here why couldn't he a killer with a lightning Thunderbolt and kill the Giant why didn't they pray what why don't you pray huh why don't you talk to God huh what are you running for what are you fearful for huh all same thing today the bride is not sure or convinced that Malachi 4 has revealed all seven seals seven Thunder mysteries therefore not being convinced then they cannot be concerned because if they ever really be convinced that Malacca has restored back the faith then you become concerned about getting yourself in order and getting your family safe knowing that he's the same yesterday today and forever so when you see somebody backsliding around here they are not convinced that God even sent a prophet they're not convinced of the message or nothing that's what I do what they're doing amen if we are convinced that Jesus is coming soon we'll be concerned about getting desperate to receive the Holy Ghost then go after the lost sheep and our families will get out of this swamp amen if we are convinced that malachi for have to store back deep-v faith then we will become concerned to follow Malachi 4 and say what he said every promise the reveal word now listen God will be concerned to take care of you with his word that is in you in the season end of time but you're not good you're not sure you're not convinced that he's really in you that's your problem amen well then who brought you here who made you who created you and what are you doing here anyway how you get in here alright so you're not sure where the guy will keep us word but my words shall not return to me boy God keeps his word every word that he said he will keep it God cannot lie on some one thing about it he cannot do it and there's where David stood for God he was convinced that the God of Israel that could defeat the Philistines then he became concerned he was then concerned about his brethren and Israel though he stood alone with his revelation on Hebrews 13:8 if you believed in the God that could deliver before and after but David believed in the present tense God the Hebrews 13:8 god of now faith is that revelation was the difference between David and Saul in Israel and so is it today in this message that is that is what separates us is seven thunders gift faint separates us in the message because they're looking for something else to come back because Malachi Ford didn't do the job but we say he did the job hey man oh my so God has his David ministry who still believe his Hebrews 13:8 and have proved it for last 22 years amen David was concerned about getting this revelation out to the rest of Israel so therefore when David before he got to he said what's going on here and they began to rehearse the David it said now David Saul whoever will fight this man he'll give you riches and he'll give you his daughter amen and he'll give you a great big white house up on a hill make you very popular your family I don't want money I don't want women I don't want popularity I'm here for the honor and glory of God [Applause] there's your three things leaning in the David ministry Amy soul excuse me he was concerned about getting it out so therefore David beginning to preach my god he had a revelation and they got all excited he got anointed brother fury and I ran and told Saul and Saul say what somebody gonna face it praise God let's go forward speak and let's go forward we're not here to defend anything God don't need no defense from you and me hallelujah but he wants you to attack attack the promises [Applause] not sit around moping around a man Omaha and Goliath presented himself every morning every evening laughing great big fella you wouldn't do to people the same size oh yeah five guys will jump on one guy and they bad it tough look one on one no you can see that oh that's right that's right so he presented himself morning and night Here I am what dog is gonna come in and fight me huh and they're gonna live resent himself there what a testing time for Israel here comes David so he gave his revelation out and song got a hold of him he said he's I can't use your helmet sir Majesty sir he said oh how you gonna do this hear what David had a secret and he comes up there may be seated and because of they and all them in Israel many just said be sure but she received three things but in Davis said the King will Richard so for Davis said for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the arms the Living God then his brothers chided him why come here with you left sheet and so forth I'm not a pride nor dienes and so forth so then Davis says what have I done is another cause then David began to preach my revelation to the people that God is the same yesterday today and forever it began a piece of about 22 years preaching away others has joined him Amen he was preaching away praise God he's the same he'll give me the Holy Ghost you shall be sealed you should happy he'll and same God yes the same one that with Malik had for saying I want to be here today same one the cancer Devils out and discerned behind them your name I see your name held a light went over there mr. hunt you pray for your sister Asma amen as your friend brother Coleman that same guys coming back him he's praying for his father there's dust saith the Lord now what's going to change me from that huh God speaking through the prophet dust at the Lord and I should knuckle down to some spirits in here awesome ministers hope god forbid praise God not without some unbelief no way Jose I mean praise God a man no way yes sir hallelujah Amen Alleluia praise God oh my and David's revelation cut back to saw or Canaan David knew he was anointed he but his head the thing he knew there was Annie and that's why he went anybody back in 74 you knew it was a need with nothing going on no where there was a need he knew he was already anointed he knew that the supernatural of God was with him and his church so he related to solve the many supernatural things God did for him David was convinced that God was with him so he was very concerned about his brethren he heard Malachi fourth message of I will restore saith the Lord David heard that a man he knew that he was predestinated to stand because he was convinced and concern amen and Davis heart was concerned with God's honor rather than the announcement amen rather than the advancement his own riches and money and so forth so on trying to get to us about here and now Davis thought was who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of living God and that's my thought for all these years who are these devils come into this God's church and sitting there won't praise God are these uncircumcised philistine doing in the house of God what are you doing here I'm concerned about God's house God seeks worship and those that all worship God what are you doing here you uncircumcised philistine don't wanna praise God and you see your name in that book you praise God everything in heaven on earth Pernod john prescott hallelujah glory to god Oh hallelujah glory to God now hey man that's why I challenge these spirits in here hey who are you anyway now watch may be seated when his ability was questioned when they questioned Saul questions ability is it worth he was able to tell of his supernatural experience of his first and second phase you get it huh now a great secret comes out of his life interview naman he said what so the Lord that they let me out of the paw of the lion hmmm and my second phase and took me out of the paw of the bear that's two twice now here's the third phase he will deliver me out of the hand of this uncircumcised philistine on the third phase his head knowledge that has me bound down that God is able to deliver a minosa yes sir his confidence was in a supernatural God and not in his own ability there's your Davis today is another cause Saul in Israel frozen with fear Goliath head knowledge and intellectual conception of the message holding down the bride with six seals the seven seals not open Philistines second Timothy demons members in the church message frighten against the revelation but be convinced like David was Amen so David by revelation challenge to Goliath he didn't wait now comes to me in with a sword of spear and with a shield when I come to thee in the name of the Lord of Hosts the army look the god of the armies of Israel whom thou has defy who are these devils that come in and sit down in here and define the outpouring of the holy spirit define this and they fire then who are you anyway praise God this day I will cut your head off you dog praise cut hallelujah look going who are you anyway will you come from this Satan scour cross the city and bring you in here or will you protest lately elected from the foundation were to be in here well that's who I'm talking to those are the elected those that God foreknew color when there was nothing no air no atoms no nothing just the Great Spirit in his mind those are the seeds that I'm speaking to and not to these uncircumcised philistine yes sir so therefore David 1746 had to put to predict his third phase are you picking me up February 9th February 16 there were 23 I had you picked me up on the third phase what am i doing predicting you and you're living right under it great right under the prediction of it so David predicted his third phase this day is spoken well I don't shut up this day well I don't feel shut up I don't see shut up this day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand that's why I can speak for my family this thing you philistine give me back my family the law will deliver them to my hand and I will smite thee and take learn hid from thee and give carcasses of the host of the fiddle signs this day and to the fowls of the air and the wild beasts of the earth and that all the or why why the stern face here at all on earth may know that these that there is a God in Israel why the third face that all the message might know that indeed malachi aforesaid seven thunders give faith four wraps and grace indeed will charity pour out upon you my god praise God to let the world know that this is what the prophets said and God's gonna pour out and vindicated Oh hallelujah let me get out of here praise God glory to God and all the message shall know that the Lord save it not with sword and spear and quotes and quotes in the quotes hallelujah for the battle is the Lord's on the third phase I did my fighting I did my pressing but Lord gave me some power down that those that are yet to come huh that they may know so lord send the power just now all lots and the power just now Oh Lord send power just now Oh lots in the palace now and baptize everyone that is a reality don't you ever forget it hallelujah so here we go it's the Lord's battle on the 35th we believe that now who is the Lord Jesus Christ okay so David thought it he expressed it he predicted it before it happened by revelation and it became his words God's thoughts came into his heart he spoke it I predict you don't disdain so I predict today this is the third face [Applause] hallelujah thought it pressed it he predicted it before it happened by revelation and became his words and David spoke the word that it would be just like his first and second phase and he went forward on his third phase to make it fulfill David Haye stood and ran toward the arm in to meet Goliath and glad looking around don't worry but I here I come brother I'm not afraid of you praise God so today I say speak to the people and let's move forward stop hanging around here praise God when you are convinced that this is a word of God then God's concern to take care of you with his word David by revelation killed Goliath had knowledge by a slingshot and a stone or rock of Revelation and took Goliath's sword and chopped off the intellectual conception of the message of Malachi for pull your swords brides of Bride of Christ and possess the gates of the enemy everyone we're gonna pick them up praise God Malachi 4 said what we need is David today amen Nicole's out here yes sir [Music] [Applause] yes sir oh god right in front of me a man you may be seated okay I'm a closeout here Malakai for said we need Davis and a real David ministry today to follow Malachi for as an echo of every promise he revealed so on perfect strength probably weakness it says whoa let me tell it this way December 7 1971 I was home I was a mailman had to get up early in the morning so I had my devotion 5 to 5:30 a.m. and I shared this with their officers December February 1st and I read this is the court I read I was reading a quote in 5 lakh in the morning pages turning one perfect strength by perfect weakness that's what's the matter today God's got a lot of sheep that's going astray the organization of things has stole them out brought them out into psychology God give us David's plural with the Word of God in the power God to direct it it when we go to meet these intellectual Giants right with all the PhD DeLeo and key us T's or whatever they might be give me the Word of God in the power of the Holy Ghost and I'll tell you we can slay a vagina on the field right we need men that can now brother branham himself said so you might have heard him when he went on the field he preached to his church what we need is a David to go out that's what he said so he went out cuz he was concerned and convinced that God was God that there would be a healing revival because the angel spoke to him so something like a talk back talk to him he talked to the ancient a need to talk to him lurid then he got his anointing then he was gifted with a divine gift to go out hey man it changed the whole world Hey and we predict in today there will be a bride paragraph 213 and we today we know we need a revival we know we are needing or need of stirring amongst the people you'll not take a dock of divinity you take a weekly hallelujah take the Word of God and power in the resurrection the power of resurrection of Christ and Slater's thing it'll bring cranks to the country let them see that he still can open the eyes of the blind heal the sick raise the dead he's God conquer a man we need a David I'm training the theological schools we need a man who knows nothing about that some little plough boy or something some little guy with his Duke show and not much to look at will come walking down the road with the power of God that's what the world needs today amen so then it and what that morning may be seated I was reading that also in the Holy Spirit spoke back to me rock I revelation stones stones Word of God with the power for the resurrection God to direct the stone to the intellectual Giants the rock a road confession revelation revelation of Christ is directed to the intellectual giant stone in the forehead and Iraq revelation will slay every one of them slay the church intellectual conception of the message this was 1971 in 1973 Junior I remember Brian being down here and I take my wife to the doctor's because I had failed her and in the doctor on Park Avenue say well of course this is or cosmetically he says we can take it out and we place it but now this man's on Park Avenue and he said but of course the Lord could work a miracle so I knew it was God speaking back through the doctor ophthalmologist so I came here to prepare the people that pray for sister coma and this is the message I preached ask what you will and then all of a sudden while I was preaching here comes the inspiration drops right in there's not another place on the face of the earth that this revelation there was a church town I don't know where it comes from amen and now he told me this in 1971 is 1973 and they are just that way tonight here's the trouble tonight and all over the world there's a 5-4 minute zn4 head Davis man is finally gonna come on the scene that stone is being wound tonight Goliath where did that go in you know it went it went straight to the forehead what is that intellectual powers David's plural ministry it's finally gonna come on the scene and slay Goliath in the forehead what was it seven thunders give Fame for 22 years Goliath is slain all over the world predicted didn't even know it [Applause] amen you may be seated then I don't know anything might know thunders that's the Holy Spirit speaking when the revelation of Jesus Christ goes to Connecticut Indiana and Tucson and Georgia and so forth speaking a year before I even went to Georgia amen America and all the different places South America and all different places it will slay Goliath and lay them out flat and in laying out flat today their slain so for years I didn't know and one day the Lord told me what do you would you what else did you say there and you will see the Sheep of God come screaming out come screaming forth praise God he said when do they come screaming out and screaming forth praise God then I had the rest of it I said oh here it is when the real David now the David's plural have gone for for twenty-two years with the seventh on inspiration slain Goliath they laying out yes right and all the the second the church members are Chamberlain the Philistines they don't always get ready to happen now we and we are predicting today God said so I'm not afraid to say it it will be hey man you'll see the sheep of God that's tied down now I've got a phone call the other night their way back her brother said brother may be seated with a colon you know

not really in the met but you know really serving on so but I couldn't think anybody to call but you that you could pray for her so I said I certainly do understand he's because she's gonna have a nervous breakdown or she may have to tell the church that he's a phony so anyway praise God these things go on continually and God that Dave is gonna expose all the phonies you won't have a rock to hide under yes sir okay my my glory [Applause] I'm finished and you see the sheep of God comes screaming floor praise God when the real David takes the same revelation that stone of that rock of the revelation of Jesus Christ when that David stands out there with that confession of what the Seventh Seal is and that's what the message needs they need that David the anointed to stand out there and prove to the nation and the world this is what my prophet said I'm the same one that spoke it through him and the son of man cometh shall find faith well I'm in a that David is me not the man I will come into my apostles and prophets and so forth Oh hallelujah when that David stands out there with the confession of what the Seventh Seal is and what the power of God is watch so he can prove it on the spot silver go have I done such as I have rise up and prove it on the spot Lyonne open up on the spot walk on the spot that's that david hallelujah on the spot so you can prove it on the spot and smash it into Goliath's forehead and all the intellectual forces tints white horses intellectual powers of the message will be scattered and the true message shall go for there will be one more ride

you the router confession the revelation laying my flat and that's what happened at night now as we enter this third phase the Holy Spirit further spoke amen yes sir Goliath Elena our flat but the people have not moved so speak to the people say let's go fall on this third phase we have an an objective I'm very tired friends sent me two out of my nose sleep we have an objective and that's glory adoption profession let's move to it we're headed to the promised land we're not hanging around here all things are possible to them that believe on his third phase and you'll see the sheep of God comes screaming forth when all this takes place that David will come forth now I say to you and closing there's your third phase into into intelligence mind of Christ dropping down as dynamics to your mechanics the shout - shout the real message and chase every Philistine out of your life - that you might be adopted he will drop down so I say to you is there not a cause for Christ that David to come forth on a third phase what was he for seventh under charity anointed faith to bring on the faith that Malachi 4head so speak to the people let's move forward Isaiah 49 - and he have he hath my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of his hand hath he hit me and made me a polished shaft and his quiver had to hit me Psalms 27 5/5 for in a time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle which is a tent amen Shelly hide me he shall set me upon a rock if there was a time for somebody to come out and speak us now amen speak that what Malachi for set echo it back so seventh on the charity knowing it faith is here to go forward on the third phase then go forward I am convinced that God is here are you convinced I'm convinced that that was a six-point star David on January 23rd over New York City and jululu at the same time Joseph over New York and Benjamin over Jerusalem ha I'm convinced hallelujah I'm convinced praise God the seven rainbows flashed on the wall hallelujah I'm convinced that last sunny a sword [Applause] top of a billionaire are you convinced huh are you convinced that today the Holy Spirit pour out are you convinced that this is the message you can be sealed you can be healed then God is concerned about you to take care of his word so why cry speak and move forward strike the arrow of deliverance not one to treats strike it strike it strike it for your family for everything praise God the intelligence of mind of Christ the dynamic is here on the third faith speak to the people let's move forward it's come from a negative shadow a negative shadow negative shadow to our actual perfect shadow of Christ hallelujah a fivefold ministry fusions for 11:13 of apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers to bring them for the work of the ministry to bring that to edify the book the Bride of Christ and remember the fivefold ministry which is that minister of currents will only be for the bride nobody else can hear them because it's Christ in them on the third phase and the people to perfection and bring them to the foot of the statue of Jesus Christ bring him to a faith oh it won't be the man it beats the Spirit of Christ like it did an apostle coming into the man and then there's Peter walk that people were healing his shadow what shadow Jesus Christ was in Peter reflecting a shadow out power and they could just get in the shadow the sick and everyone were healed in the shadow that was over Peter it had come from a negative negative negative perfect shadow when out of Peter with healing signs and wonders and miracles oh my god the supernatural hand of God Christ in his commanding officers not in front of him not on the side not behind not over but inside hallelujah glory to cut speak to the people let's go forward David spoke and took over the situation that day Peter spoke one day in acts 3 I was made a prayer meet with charm here was a man he took he the man looked on him hey man is that silver going have I none but such as I have I have a revelation that the mind of Christ is in me I have a revelation st. mark 16:20 the Lord went with them everywhere confirming away that Lord was

Archangel brother branham put that as part of the Commission well they don't get it I just preached it last week they'll understand the voice of the Archangel the intelligence is part of the last commission they'll meet Alpha and Omega is that what you mean brother home oh oh that's that David no that's that's not you know it's not me see I read to to you it was not the access of the apostle
