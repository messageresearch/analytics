TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we want to read from Saint Matthew the eighth chapter verse 5 through verses 13 inclusive I'm reading from Saint Matthew the fifth the eighth chapter rather a verse five and when Jesus was entered in took a camper gnam they came unto him asa Torian beseeching him and saying Lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy palsy grievously tormented and jesus said unto him i will come in helium the Centurion answered and said lord I am not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but Speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say this to man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he do with it when Jesus heard it he marvelled I said to them that followed verily I say unto you I've not found so great faith no not in Israel and I say unto you had many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the children of the kingdom thank you shall be cast out into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth and jesus said unto the Centurion go thy way and as thou hast believed so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour and I like to take a thought out of this as thou hast believed made a lord at a blessing to the reading of his word now let us get on with the message praise God so now we have those here that realize that the Word of God is soul amen and God will because vindicate his word he said he would do it and he's and he's going to do it and we believe that now um it's our brother spoke here in 65 I believe it was they were praying there when he was first struck down by the enemy and then uh the Holy Spirit spoke through his own wife these words they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and the devil try to make them go against that but God has spoken through his wife and they laid hands and here he's still here amen and so he had a promise that he was to live and the doctors didn't give him no time to live but they laid hands in it and because he recovered and believing that then a prophet of God came down the road with a commanded blessing and he had a little spoonful oil amen and the Prophet poured some supernatural faith into his little spoonful and he's had a whole barrel full ever since hey man it hasn't run dry in Haven brother friend and brother Fred told me I'll narrow zone he said brother Coleman I like that I never thought about it can you nurse he said I like that so he's nursing amen so now we see then at this hour in as speaking here as brother Branham has spoke to our brother here and about the right attitude and the syrophoenician woman and how we know so well as Jesus Christ say for this saying you're healed and go your way I mean because your daughter's heal rather and she went on her way in the daughters heal and then I had a note here and his brother Bram told we got a brother here someday you will say the right thing and it will all be over and then just this year here he spoke it will go no further it will be over and then uh so all of this is pointing into the right attitude now in night in Spokane Washington 1962 on a tape call hear ye him adoption in his prayer he said these words he says wait for the right thing to be done or the right word to be spoken for that great faith that we might dash into the blessings of God see it's the right attitude now this morning we might as well relax because I haven't got nothing to say to make anything happen so there's no ancient gonna fly around in through here I'm just gonna preach the Word of God we're gonna be blessed and whatever God wants to do is already ordained before the financial world to do it so they I'm not gonna restrain to hope something happens that I might see it this morning not even worrying about it I'm saved the greatest miracle has already happened I'm in the house of God I'm enjoying the blessings of God I'm not hoping and wondering his brother Barbara is it gonna be healed today it's none of my business I can't heal him I can't preach anything that's gonna heal him for the end God himself must give him the right words so sit back and relax and hear the word of the Lord and this and I cannot give brother Gary a leg I can't heal him can't do nothing so we might as well sit back and don't try to hope that he'll be healed today you you we all would like to see that God knows that but what we wanted would just be calm and this lip just let's just hear the word amen praise the Lord now it's that right attitude and you must come with the right attitude to God to receive anything from God and on the the unveiling of the of the mighty God as brother bark and I was a rejoicing over it on page 11 the the news for word book here and he says this here you have to know these words and these things look at handy right at that time when the third pole you could you remember it all of us of all the everything that the woman said the right thing you got to say that right word the right thing to God see now therefore ain't nothing now what could have you right how does she know what she was going to say she didn't even know anything about the third pole in that sense but when brother Brown related it back to her the Holy Spirit fell upon her and she said that's nothing but the truth and in the God from heaven fell in the room and she scream you could hear a city block away I hate anointing hit them so hard their faces hit the take God was all older and brother Ram jumped up and says ask what you will say anything sister Hedda you got it as four million dollars it's yours anything you want and she said the right word I knows what she said the salvation of my two sons there's the greatest miracle I hope that ties it down this morning that you won't look for the limbs and things that you'll look for the salvation of your families that's what I don't want the third pull for that come fresh didn't even all you more sayeth Amen praise got an inspiration not even knowing what she asked for and that was the fifth thing that he told him in the hospital he put it in that order number five to him that's exactly what I said happened down in Puerto Rico revelation 22:17 salvation God speaking with mercy and love to your families and tell them come to the house of God there is the greatest miracle amen and brother Browne said these words here what's this revival belong for now how could it prosper how could it be blessed I don't care how many impersonations is God or anything else that's all when Moses went out there was a mixed multitude went with him amen brother and the last night amen but um what's it done for its Jehovah himself taking a veil off of God to show the difference between right and wrong which is Methodist Baptist Presbyterian or who's right God's Word is right well every man be a lie and mind the truth and God needs no interpreter he does his own interpretation he manifested and made he gives interpretation God unveiling himself oh my right in the midst of us we see his great hand telling us these things see and he goes on down he says and he's done the same thing today putting his word right out in front what he promised not here it is every promise in the word laying right before us in plain view my what a thought can you imagine malachi for left every promise that's what I told you quicken every promise and gave it to us and it's laying here this morning in plain view what do you want we have the authority this morning to speak it salvation we can give out eternal life this morning healing or whatever that we can give it out this morning it's in plain view as thou hast believed anything you want this morning is here hey here's brother Ronnie towles letter the man come in as sick with a fever everything else in pain but the word the Lord went forth nobody knew he was sick but Jesus did amen so Jesus knows all about it this morning down in the basement mothers up in the balcony young people and where you are Jesus knows everything in your heart this morning he knows exactly what you're going for all he wants this morning is that every promise is laying right before us it's in plain view and all he want us this morning let's look at the right attitude of faith as a word stood before the Gentiles Centurion now I'm here and I'll scripture lesson this morning Jesus Christ coming down from off because from off the mountain he had been up there chapter 5 6 and 7 st. Matthew he had been up there expounding on the principles of the kingdom of God he had been up there declaring the mechanics of the kingdom of God he had been up there about eight years instructing the people in the mechanics in the principles he even preached about false anointed ones over there and met the Chimera through seven false teachers told you about the two ways to come to straight gate and wired gate and also don't have no faith he even preached in the commands over here I think of the sixth chapter fits the fifth chapter on marriage and divorce everything is in the fifth and sixth and seventh chapters on righteousness in the kingdom amen and after he had finished explaining the learning of himself instructing he come off that mountain now in Chapter eight in Chapter nine he was ready to prove what he was talking about Amen so if you reach health 8 in chapter 9 come to dynamics to prove it but a chapter five six and seven was the mechanics of what he was talking about amen and brother he told him all about everything marriage he divorced everything now the principle studied in the three chapters here in st. Luke six are those which should be operating in the entire bride of Jesus Christ the things that we have heard Jesus Christ himself speak through Malachi 4 on those tapes up on a mountain with us all these years are the principles that should be operating this morning in the bride of Jesus Christ amen see so therefore for that reason God ordained he sent Malachi for with a message a seven seal message and this message was ordained to bring a deliverance to his blood wash predestinated seeds of God that was in Laodicea all messed up all entangled in marriage and divorce and false and Noah and everything else and he sent a prophet with a message to bring us a deliverance from every spirit that would keep the principles of Jesus Christ from operating in you amen see now well when we were in a Pentecostal church we'd read the Bible and wish we could do these things and go right back out and fail but when Malachi 4 come forth he proved that you can do these things for his word wash you from the spirits that was holding back the word of the Lord from operating in you and that was a Ephesians 5:26 the washing of the water by the word amen and then the next thing he was this message was supposed to do a message of faith and deliverance deliverance from every known Spirit amen every one of them and when we finally delivered an armature to praise God then he was to restore the church to the righteousness holiness nature authority and power of Christ and I feel you on a verge of this dismal by the dynamics coming down to bring the foot to bring to pass the mechanics that Malachi 4 has released every promise in the word it lays right before us this morning in plain view but we must come with the right attitude to receive these things now the mechanics has gone forth and then come the dynamics after Jesus come off the hill and as Jesus Christ come down and he entered into Capernaum here and a Gentile a Centurion because he approached him and as he came up on him here's what he said I just read it again you'll have to get it and when Jesus was entered into Capernaum there came unto him a Satori and beseeching him and saying Lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented because he had paralyzed and jesus said unto him I will come and heal him the Centurion answered and said lord I am not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but Speak the word only and my servant shall be healed what a attitude what the right attitude of Gentile approaching the word amen and here was a man that was under Authority but this man had heard about Jesus Christ and what he was doing and he believed it he was a Roman and here was the Jews who the revelation was for of God coming through their own prophets and they were fighting him with unbelief hey I mean what a contrast here was a Gentile dog who just saw a few things I heard about he believed here he come for his own servant and he approaches him in the right editor he says I am not worthy praise God he some a man on the authority in other words the meaning being that if this minor officer could issue orders to his of subordinates go and they go and coming to come and do this and they do it you understand the Centurion recognized that just as he had authority invested in him by Rome was his headquarters amen so Jesus had authority from God that enabled him to exercise power over disease so therefore this Roman centurion know that his headquarters was Rome and in Rome told him to do certain things there in Israel he'd do it because Rome gave him that authority he had authority from Rome Jesus Christ had authority from heaven praise got over every disease Amen and this Roman centurion recognized praise God and then he realized he wasn't saved but he realized he had a reverence for God so he come to God with the right attitude brother he has to receive something he come with the right attitude he didn't come like I ain't got nothing I don't understand this was what his brother como talking about now no he come with the right attitude every Wednesday and every Sunday maybe this is the day Lord God I'm gonna get something this morning happy rejoicing in his salvation present tense salvation a pearl of great price soul all you had and bought this pearl of great price and you got it now now are you the sons of God and it does not appear what you shall be amen and this man's men obeyed him to the letter now this Centurion was expressing absolute faith in the power of Christ amen scene and he was saying here you have authority over demons and one word from you will be enough to heal my servant yes I know you can do all things I've heard about it I've seen it so therefore you don't have to come to my house amen praise God I'll need a minister to come to lay hands upon me praise God I need God to come down from heaven with a white horse I need God to set up a tent for me to go into a little room to be he'll praise God you're a god of distance you don't have to come to my house I got a revelation Lord that you can heal a million miles away Oh Lord you got to do I must come with the right attitude I know who you are your God amen so therefore I'm not worthy to even stand in your presence like the saphenous woman she says that he said you're a dog she said a dog's licked the crumbs under the master's table what an attitude and another Gentile Amen what faith what a right attitude praise God coming to God with the right attitude humility reverence faith and there was and Jesus stood there and marveled and I believe in the Bible I think you'll find only twice way because wit he marvels he marvels had a Gentiles faith I think a st. mark six I believe it it's where he marvels at the unbelief of his own people huh so he's human he could marvel Hey and he got a human Saheb amen and so that's why I get very happy when I see those with great faith too and I marvel at the unbelief also Amen praise the Lord I see my why can't they understand it well praise the Lord so we are human you know amen and we marvel and he marveled at faith and unbelief also praise God it's kind of hardly understand why people come in here dejected all the time when we have the greatest oh I mean what can I tell you what is there to be dejected about you are richer than every millionaire in the world put together you're over top of the king of England and the Queen of England we are kings and priests of eternity this little meager world's not our world this is man stuff here our world I hasn't seen ear hasn't heard what God has in store for the kings and priests who love him and who come with the right attitude now we are the sons of Almighty God thought you can do anything for your daughter in your son this morning praise God he marvel at this great faith Jesus saw the great faith of the Centurion in recognizing here it is and I recognized that he had a power to speak merely as a word where he was see and his servant would be healed that's what Jesus Christ marvel at that this Centurion had the faith and the understanding to know that Jesus Christ could stand right there and don't even go to his house and just speak a word and be healed oh I wonder we have this faith this morning amen and how the holy spirit would come down and just marvel and just come all around you amen the angel of the Lord now who do you think he'll this poor tricking brother oh because Spanish brother over here in Puerto Rico as he's as I was preaching up here nobody knew he was sick the angel the law will not didn't heal them the angel Lord is moving all through here now the angels and medicine spirits are here but the angel of the Lord he can touch you amen I remember old tapey I think sister Wolman had and she gave it to us there and brought round starting to preach and before he went into it he said oh my something just happened but I won't say anything about it yes I will and he saw a woman be touched by the angel of the Lord and he thought it was bank's word son David he thought it was David stand over but it was angel the Lord so he told the woman that she was just healed she didn't even know it and if this is the season for the spoken word the angel Lord can come up on you sitting here [Applause] amen see unseen to the naked eye but just touch you just walk all through and touch you Amy praise God as you believe the man believed that Jesus could heal at a distance he believed it and so jesus healed him at a distance and there was there your church Jesus can heal at a distance this morning praise God you don't have to have a man's hand laid upon you though that's in the scriptures and most of the Gentiles just believe the word and like Peter as he priesthoods Gentiles as he yet spake the words the Holy Ghost fell upon him and but he had to go down to some air of mixed Jews down there with the could be cams people and the Jews they had to lay hands upon them but the Gentiles you don't have to have that it's not necessary and I tell you one thing pretty soon it's not going to be here men without hands being laid on in divine love God will take a church into such a control of divine love and the sick will be healed the blind will see and the lame of walk praise God old brother in this season of the Resurrection next week I mean the death bear and revelation of Jesus Christ Easter as it's a commemorated here next week here and just a thought on my heart brother I'm speaking next week but I can see Jesus Christ on the cross and all of those that great unbelief coming against him the ones that he marvel at but all I could see some of the people that he also Marvel and even the Centurion I can see that Centurion walking up there in front of his own Roman officers and saying what did he do He healed my servant one of us all I could see blind bartimaeus standing up for him and said he healed my eyes I can see the man in st. John nine saying this is a marvelous thing you don't know that this is our God here my eye can see they D a Mary and the different ones that he had cast out Seven Devils and all the ones he healed I can see them walk in there in front of that cross trying to break through the Roman soldiers saying that he did this and he did nothing but good and what are you crucifying him this morning for can't you see those witnesses standing up there all praise God my eye can see I'm breaking trying to break through I can see the one with the blood issue that touch the hem of His garment I can see it trying to slide under those Roman boots and things trying to get there and scream out and tell him he touched me praise I touched to him of His garment and virtue in a heart he's that same God that hung on the cross is here this morning he's here to save us to heal us this morning but just the right attitude this morning o blessed be the name Z without hands being laid on just be one great unity this morning and when Jesus Christ saw this great the faith of this Gentile satori in' he said go thy way and as our house believes so it be unto thy servant all praise God we could just hear the beautiful words coming back this morning go thy way as thou has believed so may it be done and if certain was healed itself say my heart amen praise God we can see oh I can hear in the spirit now I can hear the Holy Spirit telling our brother Gary go that way as our house believe your leg is healed this morning amen I can see our God speaking to our brother over here the intelligence of God sweeping over in the season and droppin a wisdom in a mouth into anointing up on his lips that that scripture you know cuz the words from Moses mouth hid Aaron's lips Aaron spoke with God's sake as most of us as a god to Aaron amen praise God so I'll pillow files come down and put his worries on Malachi for his mouth even formed his mouth his teeth in a in a small pyramid shaped and formed to speak the name of God amen don't you see all these things here friend I can see God coming up on our brother Parker here and give him the right word forming his mouth by an anointing and saying the right word he's already spoke words already it'll be over amen he's going to say the right words you don't have to fret over try to figure out the words is this is gonna be pure Holy Ghost words amen praise our God as thou has believed be it unto thee amen old church the Living God not to keep it too long here but I see the great mother Eagle that's wanting to a stir her nest once more amen and we are Eagles here this morning and I can see the great Jehovah mother Eagle screaming out one more ride I could see the great Jehovah Eagle that has been preparing his eaglets here in a nest for eight years he comes screaming down into the other depending Castle barnyards and knew he had planted some Eagles down in here amen he come down with his shout to get us out hey man he called us from left and right and from Baptist and Methodist colors from hippies and drug addicts prostitutes and everything else call his Eagles and screamed out a shout message that did from in the heart and took us way up in a nest up in the cleft of the rock of the revelation as who Jesus Christ is in this season amen and why does the Eagle build an S upon her for Colossians 3 to set your affections way up high

renewed their strength and a molted in the old feathers come out of new ones come in and I can see Malachi 4 and after each revival they get a lot of loose feathers so then the mother Eagle screams up blasts and shakes loose - loose feathers amen and how we had our Pentecostal loose feathers and a great Jehovah Eagle through the shout shook loose - loose feathers oh and here we are and in mother

nice and cozy and comfortable and then the great Jehovah ego a man shall not live by bread alone but man should live by the Word of God from God's mouth by every word which proceeded forth from the mouth of God so the great Jehovah eagle takes the slain meat dripping with blood amen and feeds the baby eaters from her mouth and we've been fed from the mouth of God through a Prophet Malachi 4 with a message amen praise God and here we are eating and eating and then praise God before it gets too cozy like your Pentecostal church now to cozy after about three months or so he ripped takes that
