TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let us turn to the word this morning as we settle down st. John the 14th chapter and 16th verse through the 26 first Ephesians the 3rd chapter 16 verse through the 19th and Galatians fifth chapter fifth and sixth verse now I'm going to take my time this morning because I am unfamiliar with the pulpit have been here quite a while but the Holy Spirit he knows so I'll just take my time so I like to teach this morning sometimes you like to come back and teach the word to the people that's what we're here for Sunday School this morning so people might know which way to grow up him I'm reading from Saint John the 14th chapter xvi verse and I pray the father he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in my father ye and me and I anew he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me he allows me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him Judas saith unto Him not Iscariot Lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world jesus answered said unto him if a man love me he will keep my word and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which ye hear is not mine but the father which sent me these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you Ephesians the 3rd chapter 16 verse that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passes all knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God Galatians 5 5 6 for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love and God a blessing the reading of this word take a title from this faith worketh by love yeah Paul here and this great book of Ephesians the book that I was reading in the 7th church age book there the other day the chapter about the visions said that was a holy people Ephesians was the spiritual church now naturally that the message from the angel went to the Ephesians Church and the Corinthian was in the Friesians church age there's all types in in a church age but this particular Ephesians church itself Paul could teach all the great doctrines to them see and he could tell them being Gentiles most of them because after those original ones that explained to them the workings of the nature he explained to them by nature because you Gentiles and war and strife and always think that was what you did when you was before you were saved but he could explain to them that you're washed by the water of the word he could tell them that they was predestinated on to adoption and all of the great doctrines they're in here to me this is one of the greatest prayers in the Bible for there's a prayer for inner fullness and knowledge see and the thing that strikes me here the 16th verse that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man so we see that there's supposed to be another person a new man a different one a new spiritual self that's supposed to be inside and this only way that this person can get in there it's true a baptism of the Holy Ghost and then that's a scene see god is love but he comes so he's the word but he starts out with a seed plants to see then it's the seed of love and it's a spirit in spirit and then it is to produce at the end love joy peace temperance long-suffering meekness gentleness and all of the fruits of the Spirit amen and sold in we see them that Paul here with praying that for the theater they would be strengthened in the inner man that though the inner man would be in there in seed form that he wants to be strengthened by the word see the early church they just didn't come to suddenly because come on suddenly because they hear a sermon on Wednesday they were spirit-filled everyday words fed word filled every day they had powers visions all kind of signs follow wherever they were but when they come together it was an explosion the prophets could get up and prophesied by the Holy Ghost one by one amen there was no written Bible for them that they'd had a few Scrolls if they hadn't because money because they buy them the message had them because no doubt of the Old Testament but the Holy Spirit was there to take the Old Testament and reveal it out through servants prophets Aryans of what the Old Testament men in the New Testament the Bible was written two years later are you beginning to follow me now friends they were a spirit-filled and because more baptisms that's right they would because baptized they again once again they all come together and they were filled with the Holy Ghost again not just once again they will fill with the Word of God see so to really see God working you must have all the word and you must have the full of the Spirit and here was Paul praying that they would have be filled with the fullness and we know that he was saying that if you've grounded and rooted in love love is the soil amen see if that's soil that ground is love then you can grow out of that love to be able to comprehend the breadth the height the depth of God that you may be able to do that but you got to be rooted and grounded in love and love is Jesus he was a great big bundle of love that God so loved the world he sent him to us that's what so now we may understand and his breath was boundless the breath of him the lent was endless amen endless no way to measure that the depth was because fathomless exhaustless amen praise the Lord amen the height measureless can't mention praise God I'm talking about my lord Amen when you begin to talk about how great God is the devil's got to leave he's got to leave amen it come passes the universe time and eternity the love of God I heard one story that a man went insane on the the of koala dee crazy house trying to talk about the love of God can the - snapped to the eighth to measure God's love can I do it praise our God how He loves us today if we only get a revelation that we've got a God that loves his Rock and you wouldn't fear peace be still he can still all the fears calm all the waves amen he can stop all the worries that build up pressure cause pressure explodes just come into him the word coming instead in there and stay in there don't want to go outside don't want something else no other desires just hid the desire of Jesus Christ on the inside in seed form pulsating in there amen inside I feel them all the time does a mother-to-be feel a seat on the inside our mother-to-be I got the seat of God filled inside of me and more is coming all the time praying for the fullness of God somebody else do you feel they sure I feel something pulsating yeah but it better compare what the Word of God I better dot every word with amen amen the spirit that is because he let me deceit seed in there imma prove it this morning by the Word of God praise our God it reaches the love of God it reaches down to the depth of sin and filth and the pottery whatever else he reached down to because to come and get us amen test the love of God reach continents set himself to come down here to pluck us out of the miry clay he didn't have to do it but he loved us so loved the work prese I'm trying to fill you up to a point I'm trying to let the Holy Spirit take hold of the word and let you see why we should serve God why wish you walk through fire why we should obey every word why we should love the bread not talk about him and slandered him but loved him because he wouldn't do that amen praise the Lord it passes all knowledge amen praise the Lord the Pharisees was smart with knowledge and wisdom but love come on the scene passed him and their knowledge passed away the fullness of love is standing there he wasn't much to look at yeah praise got no beauty in him to beat his hair but it was God's love the arm of God being revealed the love of God but somebody saw it and they caught hold of it Peter James and John a woman after well different one Mary Magdalene they thought Jesus Christ they saw the love of God reaching down for them and it took hold of it they walk with him where he's got the word keep my Commandments if you love me then the father and I will come in and make our board with you we will man effect I sell to you your knowing that day somebody said what do you feel anything they fell something brother yeah well they like a tarp the roof up there yeah oh where do you win hell with the supreme of God sure they fell something they were pulsating screaming and holic drunken people but watch what the head in them came to this is that word this spirit that is pulse it is that word at the Prophet Joel speaker in the last days our plot my spirit for my sons and daughters these are still the last days he's still calling why for his he hasn't left in judgment yet is mercy here there was a living testimony that was

slipped on earth the cornerstone come down with strength hurt you patience the word praise good blood take it just fills me up when I think about it Amen it passes all knowledge and wisdom God's gifted man is the measure of his love think right now God's gift a man is a measure of his love for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son and whosoever anyone Jew Gentile black white yellow red whosoever will let him come for his car he'll know he won't turn your way man will you can't come in here because you can't be safe but God so loved the world yeah amen put some seats down there amen just like in the beginning the earth was seated but there was darkness there is a void Spirit of God moved up on the earth just move it could do nothing because the worry wasn't spoken

taking away the third step bring you back to the second step I'm preaching this morning that when the love of God the seed of me balls over the think man would take his filthy hands and put it on the Word of God in the end time after the prophets gone sneaky wait till he's gone and then come out try to beguile the sheep begotten to God what is he gonna do to them then people go into that presence

you love God for the word what he did for you you will fill a ship with the serpent what it says it's the Word of God praise our God we who are called to be his bride have experienced the measure of the love of God the author they don't know what it is but we know what it is God is working in our lives not because we are circumcised on circumstance because He loves us not because we could do all have faith to move all mountains nor prophecies have all no because he so loved the world he sent His only begotten Son raise Alka yes sir so he's working our last because he loves us may that stink haunting the Creator the almighty cut through all my weakness continents him to come down to these filthy cockle burrs cleaners up washes by the water of the word the blood of bleeding work dripping bleeding work wash our sins away think on a wheel justified now we all blame this now right now we can come boldly to the throne of grace Paul frees and when we get this God is willing he is more woman than what we think he is the scripture saith Ephesians 3:20 that God is able to do all violently [Applause] then we can even think up I would even dream up a me he'll do it by his love about that all that you can ask for all that you could ask for he will do Cooper upon it there for super church with super love with the super word with super faint praise out car he knows what you need David had understanding of it he desired a drink of water praise God amen his type of Christ his servants cut their way through 15 miles of Philistines to get him some water when he got back he wasn't worthy poured it on the ground drink off in the god we are not worthy for nothing amen we're not worthy my design caught your desire your will be done not my will I had a will here to take a vacation God he put up a roadblock I remembered the word so I took heed to the roadblock because soon he would have a jackass speak to me yeah praise God I caught it the first time by His grace so I stayed what - and I know it was the love of God that's what he wanted and that's where I wanted to be here in his will praise God I could be in his permissive will and get blessed sure Balaam was arrested why but he wants somebody who's in that perfect world that that his desire is their command Amen come and he said if you love me keep my Commandments keep my sayings keep my word then when you've done it for a while we'll take up a boat and manifest ourselves to you the sea that's in you that you have the love in a minor form but you know it's there you get married sometime see you confess but something in you makes you go back and repent I'm sorry brother it's our sister that's the God in the seed form what there's coming a day when that love will break at you the outer garment find it all together like you saw the Prophet SAW a loved one amen hey you saw love walking on two feet charity come down he put it on we're growing into it Amen praise our God God is working in our lives if I stop preaching now because He loves us not because he's supposed to not because we were good or we were righteous there was none righteous all had on filthy ranks all like sheep had going astray but with tender love with his raw the word he brings you back into the way you are already sheep you just didn't become a sheep now you were sheep before the foundation of the world to prove it you heard the Shepherd's voice and you came into the fold praise our God he said if you love me see if you love me keep my word keep my Commandments then all that we could ever do for God must come by love that's what I'm trying to get you to see this morning then if it's obedience it won't be because I told you to obey is that because you can't wait to obey for the love of God you're just pulsating yes Father this morning what is your worry what shall I do what is your come what is your desires my coming that's the bride she's waiting this morning to hear the word of God to obey full obedience she don't have to be herded into like goats say she just loved it in a heart welled up in there to obey the word of God amen praise God in all that we can do for God it must not be because brother hunter I ask you to do it hope you get that don't sit here now because you say because we your pastor sit here the I mean be righteous sit here because you believe we preaching the truth and you love the Brethren the sisters that's why you sit here but don't sit because doesn't because no place to go in there's plenty of places to go faith worketh by love on a token message it says full obedience to the whole Word of God will entitle you to the token full obedience not part of it as far as your denomination goes but all of it full of beans to the word which is Christ brings you into Christ he's loved so you walk right into the love of God in the end time here we were walking right into it we in it the are come down and in the art was a testimony in design was the person of the Son of Man he was in the ark standing outside Laodicea come on come on come on when you got in there it was love because you realize you see these people are here going insane alright insane and natural in the church their spirits are going insane also demand their conscience is seared with a hot iron and a Pentecostals and so forth don't even know because right from wrong all right types in natural spiritual then you realize that he clothed you in your right mind by putting on the new man amen put on the new man put on the garment put it on that's another person amen Paul told us that everything will do outside of this love will fail amen haiman let it sink in now octa karina team what he said everything you could do fries are gone outside of the love in your heart for God it means nothing for he said though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become sounding brass aiming or taking symbol and though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all seven seal mysteries come on there though I understand all mysteries well who won veil of mysteries prophet of God and there's those in the message now understand all the mysteries know all about the Pope and all these things here in future home and I Brian serpent now all the mysteries amen that don't mean nothing Digga have 1033 tapes because things to be about that memo that still doesn't mean anything without charity without being rooted ground it in the love of God Paul Pearson loving one another fervently perfectly Amen being born again by not by corruptible incorruptible seed what is the seed don't worry of God when is it in you in the third stage the shucks team not the fourth the fourth the whole thing isn't is the word Amen watch it the outside body becomes the word because the word lives in the flesh hey man the lens test will be hit now in the shock stage to see this way a little small like weighing hard yes ma'am but he's growing out that the word is taking over the whole body the body the flesh is becoming the word walking in love the bells around the outer garment clean or sweet melody and love obey down with perfume of the roles of Shaq and lily of the valley yes my lord walking in love and the bells of clean praise God the Urim and Thummim is lit up all over the devil flags against the cuts out he sees it sparkling in wet on your breast the breast is beating out the love of God amen praise the Lord so he says he and though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith see all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing so I get my goods to the poor they'll give my body to be burned and have not charity it probably nothing now much faith faith there's a gift of thing amen and then there's faith to receive amen let us take into you we see a lot of bulldozers out there Odegard Jesus man with faith out there do all kind of things out there get the faith gifts and corner guys around repentance so right now there's plenty of people right now say well you know buddy got nothing there because I don't see no signs of one is a miracle I don't see the powers of God moving I don't see that faith what you can have that still be wrong what if he planted because of love or see in your heart a seed of love in there that seed of love is right now growing brightening maturing into our Galatians 5:22 and in the fruit of the Spirit is faith so the little person sitting down here will know and they want to have pain too because it's a fruit of the Spirit the man may stay out there with a gift of faith to preach to them or like to tear but you got to see groaning you that's gonna produce faith and that'll be your wrapped in faith you want to have it and can't nobody taking away from you it can't know Paul's devil come up to you with some kind of crazy doctrine I'm looking here brother get away from you okay you serpent you see that's right cuz you will you'll know he was just perfect is come you know all things you know now see and you're growing right on into it knows it's coming every day you see but there's still some fun is hanging out there that he's going to reveal to you you're gonna do it amen see so now we see then that faith cometh by hearing Luther Wesley they heard they come by here again was saved amen see and faith is also planted though but now you cannot get this ratchet faith unless that is planning it by a seat holy spare to see and the Spirit of God must bring that fruit of the Spirit the faith of the Spirit the Spirit of God must do it and see it must be an in seed form to do it with you can have a give and don't have it in there that'll pass away amen see Paul said so you can have such a faith because could become move a mountain but they grounded in love amen pass away don't mean a thing Amen so we see them that love is the soil which we must grow in speaking the truth in love in love grow up into him in love speaking the truth living the truth because one to another for God is able I think here again Ephesians over here it says 3:20 now in Tim that's able to do exceedingly abundantly ask or think according to the power that worketh in US now he can only do all these things according to within you the power that is working in you what many would come in the last days denying the power from such turn away the power the revelation in you as to who Jesus Christ is who is the prophet and all this thing that power is there that power strengthens you in a revelation comes but they don't have the revelation there it is so if they don't have it you down there you surely can't have if I haven't got it we've heard that before you give it a meeting now if me with all my great ministry the only thing if I don't understand it how in the world can you understand I'm the one that's called and also ordained with a great ministry you don't talk about how can they understand anything there Oh God's able of these stones to raise children Abraham all right he told the church today he said the South is mixed up on the seed of the serpent they thought about it they know what he said he talked about the South natural down there because they're not even saved who listen to his message you find out we talking to so they all waiting with this message n who got the notes so we can see praise Allah now what is this power that Paul says is in in us that's God's love in seed form and the word is a seed and a word is part of God therefore there's a part of God in you in seed form all right well that that word in there is power all it needs is some water amen it'll begin to work it'll begin to bring forth what he said it'll do he planted it I have a load planner a large shell water it it'll bring four four is God now a couple of scriptures you want if you want to write it now Asians 424 I just want to lay out a background here and then finish up and that's you put on the new man if you want to write it down which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness so if you want to see a person who's a doing righteousness and also holiness well there's a new creation in them see that is because uh because created after holiness and so forth and righteousness also Colossians 3:10 if you wanna write it down and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him so this new man to seed in your little sea like this here is renewed day by day and so Paul said I travail in birth again because because the labor that Christ might be formed in you so God's prophet brings on birth pains amen what is that our prophet brings on birth pains so therefore he's laboring there Christ will be formed in you bringing forth the seed word coming into your spiritual wolves and then Christ is being formed at sea is growing through the shop body amen praise the Lord praise God so this new man is another nature another person a new man a new creation Peter says being born again by the Word of God the seed of God amen then our faith will work by the love of God that He shed aboard in our hearts he put a love in there for the word if only now by the holy spirit and the holy spirit in your heart loves God the word and it wants do all that it can for the love of God is in the heart so therefore it has faith because it loves the word it has faith because it loves his Saints love the tapes love their and don't want to break nothing it don't want to be seen nowhere with anybody who's funny there to pray for and if they had to run into him well praise the Lord stay on top round you can long enough and then this move way see but you want to stand around nikka their unbelief and unbelief kills you you go home you feel for you next day you know I'm talking about if you ever been inside my unbelief you fellowship there the next day you got a headache and everything else praise the Lord Abraham Oh a games wrote that works without faith his day so therefore Abraham worked his faith by his love for God because Abraham loved God more than Isaac then right because he loved God he gave up Isaac but he had a revelation didn't matter if you kill them coming back again anyway alright so no matter what we do we go to death that's why Peter wanted to be because Marlin upside down he'll raise in the last days wanted to identify himself with Jesus on the cross hold all of them Paul was bound to it couldn't keep him away from it amen my course is finished he says Charles made up for me he's on his way to it so he knew he is something in the heart that's pulsating in here and canto by stopping player for Abraham's faith worked by the by the love of God in his heart he loved go see the lamb for what about us and also our desires what should it be we don't have to come here because we supposed to come here well we call me because we love God amen we love the Brethren together and we can't make nobody do anything with anybody I'm so happy to see these people in here to see y'all going around to the sick the old ones and so forth that makes us feel wonderful because we know that we sow that seed and many before say well so-and-so don't visit me and but we can't do anything about it we kind of wait on God until the love of God gets in that person's heart amen for that they themselves will go out for the love of God in their heart for the Brethren sisters then this is not brother hunt brother Coleman tell and you get over the soy sauce house and you go over there and you go over there it's a my friend well then you come to see me well okay just call me a minute and we get because long could I go to see you send me now the people here there's people in here God sees that God sees that going to these ones here God sees everything you're a labor of love that's what Paul says is that right work of faith in a labor of love and God's right at all down on the board amen what is it gold silver precious stone laying on a foundation of love building up to the statue of a perfect man the love of God it's your love for these people here one for the other Paul appear to do that Paul said put on that love put it on so now work of live I was living faith at they had their and a living faith is fruit you see it amen praise God you love him amen praise the Lord how are we strengthened by his spirit in the inner man seated me now the Spirit of Truth the Holy Spirit people that can't understand that many are confused about the message well if he didn't 320 according to the power working in us according to the power against God is able to mold sons and daughters into God now how does he do it God does it by the spirit of his word he plants his seed the Roses spared upon it and brings plot the product brings it forward see his holy spirit transforms the seed word to be vindicated of its character now whatever kind of seed is in the heart the holy spirit was to come the latter rain and throw up on it in the same field weeds and tears the champion wheat and whatever's in the heart that's the only thing that can come out on the outside so therefore the life in the seat meets the life of the Spirit but if the life in the seat is love you can seed fall and when it meets this full token amen full token life that have come down here now to apply it you apply them to it what's in their heart that you'll transform it into a sudden daughter of God you won't have to ask the system to accept because top cutting they had all these things here the love of God brother it'll be in a man and her heart is beating in there because you want to please her Lord amen you won't have to ask them to Lord their dresses now aunty Maggie said they'll do it for the love of God you won't have to ask the Brethren to be real brothers one to another they'll do it for the love of God that's a real church that's what a gospel wife that she is because she sees a fear and has the best spirit she says in a whole message if she said drop the play see and so we pray stop it because not us but I'm happy to be associated with you I'm happy to unite paint with paint and staying in this rotgut city here as a testimony amen I stood here for the love of God in my heart I wouldn't move know where they can go to the east can go to the west you go to the south go to the north but the love of God constrains me to hold on he says I got a work for a little while longer there hold still down there amen praise the Lord so we'll hold still the Philistines is ravaging the people up and down the byways amen but we got things we got a ops code amen and by faith we have beat him off of the byways in the highway amen calling cheetahs on the scene he's there me man he was it right there in the boat they had a swarm though amen ask for Jesus and he'll come on the scene he was back there taking a nap he's right here right now his presence is over us right now is in us moving through it brooding up over bringing us full why his love for people so the Holy Spirit transforms the life in your heart and to a seat of God seat itself see they can only get that bit the seed word drain itself we were shocked when the Cabal lay out see you but now the grains opening up and you begin to see this whole grain that grain itself is you the grain itself amen praise God imma prove it to you have a little something right here enclosing praise the Lord so now Holy Spirit transforms a seat that's on the inside of it the man of what current he will transform it so God to recede I was worried there's only one thing I can quick in the word that is the Holy Spirit nothing else won't do it see me now it is the life giver to the word and when the life and the sea meets the life in the word there you see something happen spontaneous combustion amen now the spirit green gives life to the weed to tear shucks all of it see so God took before he could get the real green lines out into the harvest he took it through three steps three stages three processes the world passed through three same steps on a woman passes through three bringing full of life the wheat goes through three and we're gonna come to three but yet there are men around this area and across who says no you're not going to come through three because you're in the second one right now they took you out of the third wouldn't put you back in the second one because you guys hang to the Keysha now and you have the spirit in a measure and you're waiting for the fullness dang what God's prophet said Sheree so therefore I have something here to read for you future home and a bride this is after 63 so I said well that was before you know cuz you don't wanna say it's the word now what we say well we have to we'll see what you say about the word now after 63 I missing page 17 do you love them prove all things Amen by the message dovetail with the word see this is what I'm reading from page 17 now well I pick it up here he says them and now and notice just exactly how that comes know a man can repent of sin he's still thinking of well maybe he's in because immoral man every moral looking woman he finds is still there maybe he's a drunkard every time he smells the drink is still there see but then he gets sanctified that cleanses that desire out of him see it takes the warmth of it away he can still be tempted but it takes to warn of it away still he's not right then he is baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire this was in 64 cleansed burnt out cleaned up and then put in to service of God sanctification only test aside for service and notice just exactly how there comes the message is coming Luther justification West identification Pentecostals the baptism of the Holy Ghost the messages that's so where they can't be no more ages of it see we at the end time three stages baptism cleanses the heart with the Holy Ghost how striking now he takes the place where we are to dwell and through the same process and it's called a church through justification called to sanctification then filled it with the Holy Ghost and fire and he took himself through a prostate he himself the Holy Spirit they can't get there he himself is the Holy Spirit the love but he baptized your heart with his spirit to burn it out then he could come down what is in seed form in there then he comes down with the word then let's see didn't it takes on the word takes on the word he s himself a man's word he is as good as his word so what is G he sends his word down by only one personal profit he says I want you and the Prophet speaks it out that's his word then he himself comes down in manifest himself to you personally he said he would do it what you said here hey man praise the Lord his old very life self-serious wondrous powers he'll do it himself in season a man see so now um page 23 yes Satan was will be taken from the earth just exactly like Satan was taken from you Hittner Amy let us take him now Satan will be taken from the earth just exactly like Satan was taken from you Satan cannot bother he contempt but he can't get a born-again Christian for God from the foundation of the world Paul saw him and sent Jesus to redeem him and the blood speaks for him how can he say when he can't even be seen by God and today they'll come and tell you that you don't have that they've said it well they told me on the phone you haven't got that well maybe he hasn't got it but I know what I have praise the Lord I'm for sweetie nobody fighting away from either okay men against that day that's right and but you see now here is again I just want to say these things that you understand it the baptism of fire watch now on it only is to cleanse it or begin that now he says a baptism of fire to cleanse out the heart to take Satan out cuz thanks avocation Satan still in there now he told you that but when he says the fire had the tub comes in and a little seed in the third stage this is what the Prophet taught see the baptism of fire on it only is to cleanse it and make it a fifth place for his meek to live in see oh like he did us so therefore he takes Satan offered the new millennium kingdom takes it away binds him up then the meat can live there as long as he's there because to influence them plate takes him away and everything is righteousness so then therefore the Christians tumble around he the elected one he takes him out of your heart he can't get in there he's out burned out amen come see before he could become in he had to give us the baptism of fire then the Holy Ghost come in and live dwells in there let Kruk a Christ dwell in your heart by faith amen praise the Lord do you love them well one more restoration of the bradstreet made 76 the fourth light is to come that will bring forth the same science person told me well right now if you have the Holy Ghost why don't you have discerns while I'm in the third stage and I'm going into the fourth day but he said the fourth stage is to bring them the fourth stage concede the a pentecostal with the baptism was the Leaves wasn't the fruit yet and the fruit up on a top of the tree and his shall be lying about the even time to ripen the top of the tree but the fruit in the top is four stages and they all gone up they're trying to figure the early church with this church and they can't they can't get it and they want signs and ones America imma sure you buy this here why you cannot have it right now is against God's nature to have it right now how can you have it when the full light is not there yet the full nature is not to you how do I have it but they want anyway and they blast anybody who say because he got the Holy Ghost see okay watch justification brought back to pulp sanctification brought back the bar doctrine of holiness what brought back the lees Pentecostal or what is the Pentecostal of leaves to clap their hands your rejoicing Pentecost of what the fourth was the word itself the Word made flesh fruits of the fruits of the Resurrection sign that Christ has finally after justification been planted sanctification then the cook planted that does the Holy Ghost all nations died out see Laodicea Christ has again scented himself like to camp on the earth the capstone had come down love hope you get that and you walking into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and in there is all the mechanics of what he really is take a car and because take it apart why the Prophet has taken apart the word for you to let you see every part of the Holy Ghost it'll do this a me it'll do that it just won't shout will speak and telling us do everything else amen love and peace and joy everything from Genesis all the way through revelation so the master mechanic of prompted has taken apart the Holy Ghost to show you what it really is what he's doing the mechanics of it all you see it right now you follow me frames first line justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost then coming of the camp what is it that Holy Ghost four-inch prophets words don't don't take away from it now holy ghost bunch being holed out by horn virtue patience holding it out temperance who is it stones is being cut glory to cut the stones is being cut here in New York Puerto Rico Europe Africa by what Holy Spirit tutor the word the message holding out that bunch because at the top each stone must fit for the castle there just to blend right in angel same ministry same size same power not now then when different love caps at all see but they all gone up there Harley Harley Harley will sign ones Americas well Sager and 6:14 said they followed him for the marathons but the woman at the well follow him she said comes to young man who told me all things amen he has different spirit to spirits right there Warren spheres working right now for signs one of the miracles glory to God and we got love here we love everybody had love about the spirit you said because you were sanctified without the spirit say you still in the heart get in the word Saint is still in the heart and they claim the Hamel oh how can you when love is in seed fall working through a bride now and vindicating it everybody knows about it not me you Travis wife there so some different ones they all give testimony to it but they curse it no we got it here well praise the Lord what is it the Holy Ghost wants me at home I love this I love God's Word praise God you're good now amen I'm trying to explain to you God soul locked up there for alright love God I'm going to keep his Commandments keep his sayings he spoke it to a proper ground this is not God because prophets worse it is his words his sayings his commandments the Scheldt message and this isn't 64 then I'm reading here from 162 relevance because 64 see being hold out the Holy Ghost boys being home now can fit with the same kind of Miss that he had when he went away then when he comes it'll catch the whole thing in a rapture when they are justified sanctified in baptism of the Holy Ghost that parent will stand again the house of God will live again it doesn't live now when the sign is coming on to it it'll is when when the wind comes upon it don't forget that mouth to sign you in the flesh coming on now amen is adding now but he gonna say prophesy wind speak to the wind tell it and it'll blow up on it and you'll see those things you're looking for you'll see this Jesus living in you you'll see living faith amen living fruits living you've seen it now day by day right here and you miss amen praise the Lord well about five minutes more amen you're tired you're weary well okay I can because cut it off here we don't understand about natural birth the earth the Prophet he preached it if you just read the book seek spiritual birth amen okay now because remember the fourth light I will restore say the Lord in the fourth stage not the morning of the third day when life appears baptism Holy Ghost but at the end when the science comes see this when he walks in when they finally get together after all the rumors up and down a whole day hey man and they got together an even time and Thomas was neither and they was together and they was on one Accord in there and he walked through the wall he slipped in there and spoke to them and then he talked to them and the thing that he did because he honed them out the living resurrected word open their understanding to the scriptures that right showed mighty committee because infallible proofs to them so did because he dried them out he added to them many things on the scriptures then for about ten days they just dried right out then he sent down the Spirit amen they were just completely dry but the thing about it he himself told them to go to that place so they was in one place but he told me go there they was on one Accord because he told them all that I'll send you the Holy Ghost I'll baptize you with fire so brother they're harvester waiting for that are you wait my bus amen glory to God they were had to every day there was nobody peeping around in prayer they always praying out privately they look nobody off you can feel a spirit when you praying to God and somebody is listening it happened to me all the time before here our brother Kennedy says the brother you were praying and your prayer but brother that's own soul I said what what come on know about him don't know what happened to him I couldn't believe it this is a brother walk up to me because we had a print me know about six years ago and I'm praying it out for this brother different ones my brother asked me what is wrong with him I thought if he was praying pretty lucky he wouldn't hear me amen so I'm only trying to show you they was on one of course they had love they had a dis die in there they wanted that baptism of fire and if we'll then you see nobody amen praise God therefore God said he'll get a bride into one place Christ amen and they'll be on one Accord every word they won't break the word note that way one could be in Europe want to be in Africa on one Accord by the revelation of Jesus Christ and he don't have to pick no certain time he can come down in and come up on those who are in one Accord on the word dot in heavy word amen amen amen all across the world no funny doctrine Amen but in one place Christ amen on one Accord with the word that's why he sent the word back because every man will the Lord Himself because Begley I see an age I'm a possum of profit I'm sore so and so that right but he sent a product with the word to get us back on one Accord those who are elected and they are in it right now being dried up amen praise the Lord the original life is the word see now that life that was in the in closing in the blade toss woman husk comes out of it the latter rain brings it out then when it comes out where's it going got to go somewhere it goes into the green in the green the Warriors on earth a message and it walks right into it so therefore part of the full life was in Luther Wesley Pentecostals part of that life was in there and that part of eternal life Paul prayed for you that you would get the fullness of it but you got to walk into the word first because he can only move by his word and his spirit and you got to apprehend it for yourself when the angel came because came to Mary and told her that God loves you marry you highly favored me yes sir just like you but you couldn't believe it so therefore she knew about Isaiah 9:6 now she knew all about it but when that spark of faith because it was told her you she applied that word to her life when she surrendered her will to cook and applied it to herself then the Holy Spirit that was right there brewed it over created God in her womb right there the same prophetic message spoken by an angel Gabriel we had a prophetic message the light come out of the ark up in him come down told us that you gonna have the same Bulls of God amen so surrender to it and the Holy Spirit is right now I can prove it brooding over you bringing forth its life as it cuz well when I read this to you amen but now I'm closing justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism made a way for the Holy Ghost Christ himself love charity Rose of Sharon where you walk home come down and get into that word all the word and then bring it in manifest himself in the fourth page signs following it see it now friend praise the Lord
