have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will I want to say something I keep forgetting about it sometimes I have a habit of what I'm talking about Martin Luther how invariably say Martin Luther King something so therefore I'm not talking about Martin Luther King I'm Luther whatever you hear me say that

he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying the body of Christ so we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God now you see why seven thunders gives all in the message faith see that's why it is fought amen they fight in the scripture event for their to find the body of Christ so we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God into a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness Christ may God bless and read
