god be praised sha a man it may be seated oh praise God Amy we have a fellowship sure we have a nitwit with the Lord with the Holy Spirit with the presence of the Almighty with hello him what does L am doing in the evening time come down to have fellowship with his attributes mine he's having it the same way he talked to Adam and Eve in the garden praise connie's heaven now waited all these years to have it all down through six thousand years and God elected predestinated you and I to have fellowship with Ella him as his attributes that's why I'm singing and shouting that's why we gathered here amen praise God you may be seated well praise God we announced that we wanted to have this time as a special tribute to our brothers and sisters from the continent of Africa we happen to be brothers and sisters from the continent of Europe and America and so forth and Canada in different places amen but we brothers and sisters they just happen to be from that particular part of the world and they happen to their the seeds I picked up that particular color well in the European up their colors over there but this we all get back to heaven we want to have that one rainbow color Oh hallelujah so we're not really having a salute to Africans praise God we haven't salute to brothers and sisters that we knew before the foundation where we happen to be born in Africa hema praise God so we deem it a blessing and a privilege at this time too to just steal away from maybe we would be in the restaurant talking about something or maybe I run up and down the hallway somewhere so we steal away from that this to come and have a little fellowship with our brothers and sisters and salute them praise God Oh blessed be the name of the Lord and the song that New York saying here step out on faith [Applause] that song was saying for my brothers and sisters from Africa so you step out on faith they they they write me some of them over the years that brother Coleman I will be in pen Harris my fame as well praise the God a brother a man and God will make it soul soul Temari may be seated to our brothers sisters the song was sang for you amen as a tribute to your faith stepping out on faith amen praise God so we certainly are happy to be able to do this you know and they have a responsibility our brothers and that here from Nigeria and representing the rest you know they have a great responsibility and we all do amen and so and running from the presence of the Lord and we don't want to go down to the old dishrag going down to Tarsus you know we are how we're responsible for a message and we have to deliver that message straight to Nineveh amen sometimes we go this way Annette way to get there and may have to be swallowed by a big fish or something amen and God I take it right to it you're supposed to go and dump you out on the beach reap in there if you miss that like to say repent hey man see but that's the responsibility and we accepted him and praise God my brother Brown speaking about a man the woman for wife and page 14 you see the files young young man looking for where I have to be married here's to the girl I've met every qualification I thought it would to make a woman why morally she was a queen and lovely and firing purse personality a real Christian everything that I could think of to make me a good wife no matter how much I think she's perfect she's exactly right she isn't mine to accept her and responsibility of her being my wife so when we accept this message and responsibility of being in this message and part of it then you have really accepted the message Baima and all and it goes with it the reproach and everything else the Baron is the whole thing aim that's the same thing the messages you might say is right of this that or the other and say I sympathize with it I believe it's the truth but you got to accept it it's got to become a part of you and you a part of it you you got then it's yours oh my praise God aren't you happy that you accepted hey man no we just noticed in the meatman said is getting you ready for what's going on because the enemy is gonna come in there man page 16 I wish you wash you speaking by going down at Tarsus too many Christians today are so soft soap and everything until they think all they do is join a church and go in somewhere put their name on a book I'll do a little something jump up and down and shout out or something like that and call it Christianity no he says Christianity is a every everyday rugged living for God in this present world a constant burning of the fire and the love of God in the heart that sets you afire and put you out yonder with the people and makin converts to Christ Amy and the responsibility that God has given us in this day to bring this message and as I did get over as I got as I get old and I know my days are short enough I feel a responsibility greater than I ever felt press it on we must do it just seal is open press it on dynamics and mechanics together seven thunders gives faith press that message on adoption time perfection time the rapture is here the resurrection is at hand press it on responsibility Amen president we must do we must get down we must get down to it in everywhere we go and tell the message and tell the people that Jesus is coming that he's God and he's coming soon and there's not a hope left in the world but the coming of the Lord now when we can identify with that then we will be beginning to become formed into real Christians that's not a shame to say I'm not identified with this world I'm identified with that message from Malachi 4 and our brothers from Africa they are responsible amen to go back and tell the nation about this message here that's what they're doing and also of course brother Joseph Branham you see the pushes on with with the voice of God into spoken word publications to get the voice out with the messages praise God and even they they have the free tape library down into Africa in different places and if anybody any Americans are Canadian anybody ever want to do anything for God to me I would push get behind that and helped establish free tape libraries where the voice of Malachi 4 can be heard along praise God with the spoken word publication to dovetail to know what that prophet said amen so you can rain Jeffersonville and find out how you can go about establishing the free tape library now nobody asked me to say this now I'm just I swear I feel amen praise the guys and don't worry if any ministers come behind the tape in the book from alpha Monday at 7:00 still they'll be speaking the same thing yes sir also we're so happy here and knowing what we're doing here praise God amen by the u-19 time is on even all the clouds must unite so you can have some rain praise God the Ducks unite to go down in the Louisiana Texas to get some rains a man and we're uniting Oh what do you know what are you a you you're uniting for amen I mean yeah you're for the resurrection brother 19 time and sign page 21 22 then I'm gonna bring up the speakers God u19 time yes sir all mine now remember there's nothing of the word you don't need back again bringing back the faith that was once delivered to the Saints bringing back that this could only be done in this day the only time it could be done is right now I it never attacked anywhere else they went off on denominational sprees but now it don't belong to no denominational spray because it's time for the uniting of men and women of every race every color creed everything under Christ by what by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and after you baptize with the Holy Spirit back to the word to prove that you're baptized with the Holy Ghost amen is that one of them will be knighted him for another outpouring another reef Dylan of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and back to the Bible back to the principles laid down on the day of Pentecost back to the word amen praise God so now I want to read a little something that brother hunt my friend from five years old and are mean everywhere praise God and we were had the privilege in the blessing to visit just Billy Indiana in 1961 we started going down and then 1962 we were there and I believe it was blasphemous names and that's when we went to see brother Bremen it's Saturday I remember well we were hunting myself and sister Coleman sister hunt brother bin and sister Alma Gomez a man went down retired and where he had gone to friend of ours by the Shepherd's house we pulled up in there I walked into room two to refresh myself and Holy Spirit says go over to my prophets house my prophets house we just got to so we got in we went over drove we could come driving down the front and all sudden brother BAM ran out to his garage door we just stopped a car and went jumped out and went ran up to the walkway there to meet brother Branham and he took off his head says how to do sir my mind was totally blown hey man how to do sir amen so then we all gathered around and begin to speak with us and so forth any tolls but the old college sister Leah now in Tennessee how the plane was stopped you know and so then I you speak in there and I said why God we stopped the plane praise God catch what I'm saying hey man so she could do we we did it also and then go over to my prophets house him and he was in the kitchen you ran out and I looked I looked down at his feet he held his house slippers and no socks on so I know we have stopped the plane a man crazy you gotta watch these things they just only look ha yeah well praise the Lord brother brain of a man but look around see what's going on see why you're there amen all praise God so then we went on inside he invited us in and he saw brother Ben he's oh why brother why mr. Smith god bless you and we went on inside and he talks you got a you don't know what's going on you know and then the first thing is oak and he he looked to brother hunt and I he I asked brother hunt to remember what happened cuz he has a mind like an elephant he remembers everything heaven it don't get tangle up him with him in the old Bible I tell you he knows all the scriptures even praise God and brother branham took out a beautiful ebony statue of a male African from a shelf where many other trophies were on display and he began to minister to us using this statue as a point of reference he said you see this African he loves his God he really loves his God notice his hands are tied behind his back securely he cannot defend himself he has had a bone driven through his lips clamping his mouth shut he cannot cry out he cannot eat he is going to be put out in the jungle alone with all the wall animals for sacrifice unto his God he loves his God so much he loves his God so much that he is willing to die for him through the Prophet Owens brother Rams also stated there is a tribe in Africa their sacrifice is children to crocodiles to think on this for a little while they love their God so much that they are willing to die for him then after brief pause he said aren't you glad our God only wants us to live for him humming my glee that all god only wants us to live for him and to walk in the bloody footprints on the sins of time now the footprints that brother Frank spoke about this morning is already laid out straight to the resurrection and can no devil keep you out of there and he only wants you to live for him because our age we have to live and stand no death but staying in a resurrection alive praise God and He will give us the Holy Ghost to hone the word in the South praise God and then we will live for him what else can I tell you it is my blessing and my privilege amen as we asked our brethren my brother Enoch or Kiki from oneisha Nigeria you come up my brother amen praise God you appreciate brother Enoch or Kiki amen yes sir God Bishop brother you know I always say Enoch is building that pyramid amen now he isn't the only one feeling that pair of it I don't want the brother to think that I think he's the only one he's not at all this building a pyramid amen brother who's those building a favorite down there - brother who's all amen from cartoon I'm a man praise gone god bless you brother boos all he was a colonel in the Army he's retired now he's in the Lord's army full-time praise God amen and now next up brother a new do a man a brother new do Emma

don't know how they make all these meetings say man it's just gone but they want to be here amen and so therefore we took this time out we know that brother branham's heart was went out to Africa he said I'm called to Africa do you know what was he talking about amen but that was God in the prophets I'm call a man many minds are blown out trying to figure it out and then praise God but all I know is that I just want to take this little time out to salute my brother's here and there's the others on down it is not here they're representing them and I appreciate that we should had little bit more time amen praise God or really say what I feel in this sincerity in their faith and they don't care come what may they come to New York it's snowing is cold ain't got no coats overcoats and things on they don't care that they kept warm by the fire okay it doesn't bother them see we might we go and make sure it's going to Europe I better have on all the things necessary for cold weather a man even brother Tommy heaven praise God gotta make sure we have on a furs and things a man if you're gonna go over there or whatever so I certainly appreciate them and knowing what brother Joseph random and spoken word and voice of God knowing they make an all-out push to get the message out to Africa and Indian all the different places so what little we could do is just to give the kind of solution Amen praise to God and so now I've introduced them and so I'm not gonna come behind each one because we don't have the time and so we're going to ask the New York group to come up and salute them with a little song specially our brother Enoch she'll be coming behind as a single little something back to brother Enoch a menace and the people there and they know the song I believe so they're gonna sing
