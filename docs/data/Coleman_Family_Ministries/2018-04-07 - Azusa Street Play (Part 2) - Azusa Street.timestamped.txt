[0:00] I just want to give you a few pertinent
[0:02] facts about 1906 there were 76 million
[0:05] Americans living in 46 states during
[0:09] those time and 1.5 billion people which
[0:12] means the world has more than quadrupled
[0:13] since 1906 New York City had only one
[0:17] subway line ice cream cones had just
[0:21] been invented two years before but Henry
[0:24] Ford had not yet introduced his Model T
[0:27] to the world in fact there are only
[0:29] eight thousand cars in his country and
[0:31] ten miles of paved roads perhaps that's
[0:35] why 15 states had speed limits of 20
[0:37] miles an hour
[0:38] makkena pulled over for going 30 on a
[0:45] more disturbing level there were 96 auto
[0:49] deaths in the u.s. in total which was
[0:53] less than 115 lynchings which took place
[0:55] with sort of a telling time at a sign a
[0:59] sign of the times an allow you know
[1:03] police could in those days arrest a
[1:06] woman for smoking in the streets the
[1:11] average wage was $12.98 a week and the
[1:18] most popular song of 1906 the big hit
[1:23] take me out to the ballgame anyway back
[1:30] to Azusa Street as you can see the
[1:33] revival had fully started and it was
[1:37] time for the Saints to move on the gods
[1:39] provided place there Zeus's Street
[1:42] mission you'll see in the next scene
[1:45] titled Jesus loves that from the very
[1:48] beginning there was a special anointing
[1:50] in this mission
[2:00] you
[2:13] you know even though I'm so excited
[2:17] about this new place of worship I sure
[2:20] I'm gonna miss those days at your house
[2:21] but that would I know what you're
[2:24] talking about brother Seymour him some
[2:26] good services this place don't look like
[2:30] much for that would know and I would
[2:32] told that it was used for an old African
[2:35] Methodist Church and then round about
[2:38] the neighborhood started to change
[2:40] becoming industrial yeah
[2:42] they said that after that church left
[2:45] they tried to turn into some apartment
[2:48] buildings but fire came and destroyed a
[2:52] portion of destruction then it just went

[44:57] knew it was he and as he drew nearer he
[45:00] was in the form of a beautiful white dog
[45:04] in his presence
[45:06] I was slain upon the floor it was then
[45:09] that he began to work in need I had died
[45:14] out to all I knew and believed oh how I
[45:17] was shaking under the power of time in
[45:21] vain a stillness as quiet as death came
[45:26] upon me and I heard the Lord whisper
[45:30] clay in the Potters hand oh how I was
[45:36] shaking I had read that many times in
[45:40] the scriptures but never until now did I
[45:44] know its true meaning I knew now that I
[45:48] could receive him and then it happened
[45:51] the dog descended into my heart oh how
[45:57] can I ever praise him from what he has
[45:59] done

[53:50] I had a vision and it has left me very
[53:55] troubled and I wanted to tell you about
[53:57] it in this vision I saw the devil and
[54:03] many of his demons and they were
[54:05] gathered at this large table and at the
[54:08] table they were discussing the problems
[54:11] they were having with the Pentecostal
[54:14] people and what they were planning to do
[54:16] about it
[54:16] and they're all discussing the giving
[54:19] suggestions and finally this one demon
[54:22] he stood up and said huh what if we take
[54:26] away the Pentecostal people's joy and
[54:29] peace well some of the demon saw was a
[54:32] good idea and they said yeah yeah sounds
[54:34] good but the devil the devil said no
[54:38] because they would still have the
[54:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:44] so those demons they went back to
[54:46] thinking and pondering and finally
[54:49] another team instead of me said huh I've
[54:50] got it what if we give them the baptism
[54:55] of the unsanctified laughs well all
[54:59] those demons they were born they would
[55:01] share they're clapping but it seemed or
[55:04] this vision has left me very troubled
[55:09] [Music]
[55:10] that's quite something

[1:24:30] sing the song the love of God because it
[1:24:36] was only the grace and love of God that
[1:24:39] had allowed me to live through that
[1:24:42] tremendous time of outpouring of the
[1:24:44] Holy Ghost
[1:24:51] I can't even describe it was two minutes
[1:24:57] we should have been there that revival
[1:25:01] lasted three years and all those
[1:25:05] troubles started happening and now as
[1:25:10] you know we still worship at that church
[1:25:12] you know I used to your Aunt Jenny
[1:25:15] Maddie
[1:25:16] Oh Richard uncle a and you all worship
[1:25:22] at the same
[1:25:42] like a small group we have here 20
[1:25:46] sometimes we have so seven days a week
[1:25:54] three times a day and sometimes the
[1:26:00] services were just so powerful they'd
[1:26:06] run right into the other one we'd be
[1:26:08] there just praising the law and the
[1:26:11] people in the building - it couldn't
[1:26:16] take no more and then they'd hang around
[1:26:18] the windows just trying to hear the word
[1:26:21] of God and see me with God amongst them
[1:26:23] to the Spirit of God not sure I could
[1:26:30] have been there uncle Seymour well I
[1:26:32] wish you good luck but you know the Lord
[1:26:44] is good the Lord is guy you know
[1:26:53] powerful service for me though we go
[1:27:01] just like you see now move back to where
[1:27:05] we got started just a few books but we
[1:27:11] still stuck it through we're still here
[1:27:13] we're still having Holy Ghost meetings
[1:27:15] praise the Lord
[1:27:18] many years have gone by but the love of
[1:27:23] God still remains the same yesterday
[1:27:27] today and will be forever
[1:27:32] praise the Lord Somali I want you go to
[1:27:38] help you home
[1:27:39] are you around there buddy no I'm all
[1:27:43] right Mama's gonna stay with you watch
[1:27:46] statement in the right and I'll just
[1:27:47] start in here right okay all right well
[1:27:54] sisters aren't so happy to have you once
[1:27:57] again as I was saying and I tell you the
[1:28:01] Lord has been good to us he has kept us
[1:28:08] down through all of these years all of
[1:28:15] the strife and the leavings and all the
[1:28:19] unbelief and he's just been preparing
[1:28:24] our souls yes for that city
[1:28:26] amen and I just love it when we can get
[1:28:30] together like this and encourage each
[1:28:33] other and sing and praise and our
[1:28:36] encouraging is so important because we
[1:28:39] know that when we do that every obstacle
[1:28:44] that that old devil puts in our past
[1:28:47] just it's like nothing because our faith
[1:28:52] just gets old
[1:28:54] yes
[1:28:59] but you know the Lord has been preparing
[1:29:02] us for this journey all the trials
[1:29:07] because this is not the place that we're
[1:29:09] supposed to be staying he's done
[1:29:12] prepared us for another place and that
[1:29:16] place is called Canaan
