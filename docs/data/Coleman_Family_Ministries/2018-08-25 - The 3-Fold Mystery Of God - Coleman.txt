again tonight Lord as we gather tonight father we are certainly acknowledged in the presence of the God that has been here with his Lord and we rejoiced and know that our names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life and I pray Heavenly Father tonight that you would come down in a mighty way again and bless the Lambs of God tonight and inspire the ministers Lord realize there's only a short time left on this earth may you make your ministers of flames of fire amen inspire all of them with a a real revelation of Jesus Christ and he's the same yesterday today and forever amen Lord God anoint the word of God tonight amen and made go out like under bolts of lightning may the people have a true revelation amen as we gather here tonight Lester the word that's the reading of the word Amen and our Lord confirmed the word with a mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit tonight and we'll be careful to give you all the praise honor and glory for we acid for your honor amen and for your glory we asked it in Jesus name and for his sake a man would remain standing for any other word I'd like to read from Ephesians the third chapter in 1st Corinthians the second chapter in Revelation 10 sin Ephesians the third chapter first corinthians the second chapter verse in Revelation 10 7 reading from Ephesians the 3rd chapter for this cause I applaud the person of jesus christ for you gentiles if he have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which has given me to you-ward how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote afore in few words so we see the mystery comes by revelation and you cannot explain it to anybody anything that you can explain is no more faith so faith is a revelation of what God said and God is free to reveal it to whomsoever he will so I cannot explain how the 7th seal is open it's a revelation I cannot explain the seven thunders is a revelation I know one thing I'm part of Helen heal me any man whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto us unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles should be fellow ears and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel where I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me Who am less than the least of All Saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ and to make known to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers and heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord first Corinthians second chapter verse six howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to know it but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even a hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory and today if they had known that the seven thunders really was revealed they would not have said all those harde mean things which they have to give an account for because the seven thunders has been revealed and the seventh seal has been pulled back on tape after tape after tape revelation ten seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets may God the blessing to read of his words you may be seated well amen we're happy to be back here tonight and greet all the ministers of one that haven't seen Lord bless you amen I like to take a title tonight the threefold mystery of God and my subject is the hidden wisdom of God ordained before the world unto our glory well we certainly speaking on behalf of the Coleman family and our sister letter we certainly like to thank by the twine Amanda Church here for making our stay here or very comfortable and we certainly enjoyed our time here thus far and this is my last night to be speaking so I just want to say officially from the platform we thank you and it was wonderful to be here to have fellowship with you if I don't get to shake everybody's hand amen we trust in the sea and glory praise the Lord and it's been wonderful being here with you thus far and we know that it will be even it'll get even greater as we go on in the meetings and all these wonderful ministers will begin to administer you the words of life so I just just given my little testimony about my name being in the book of life amen and so I'm so happy so may the Lord bless the rest the rest of the convention and all the other ministers and rejoicing what our names written under that seventh seal there's so much controversy but is the seal open the seal is not open and I don't know why it should be because I believe we can all read English amen he says it's open on so many tapes so why should there be a dispute about it but yet it has been and it's just been the enemy stirring up good brothers and it's got to be revealed by Jesus Christ and just a couple of quotes God hid and simplicity in your seal book page 59 brother Brown speaking says Amen see there it is see just way it's already past you didn't know it he had been previously speaking about he lies one day you want to hear that he's already come amen and many don't know that and don't understand that in his own John's own disciples a man his own disciples right didn't know he was there amen and so he said oh there it is just where it's already past you didn't know it see if it is if the angel of the Lord will break them seals to us seals forth to us remember his seal with them seven mysterious thunders now how in the world could we know anything unless this thunders open the seals because the whole book was sealed with seven thunders and the thunders here it says right here it had the mr. seven seals are sealed there was seal with the seven thunders now I can't people believe the simple simplicity of a humble bunch of people and the voice of the silence why can't they believe it see and there is you can believe it Amen but nevertheless it is open and maybe somebody's sitting here warned it in here and there still wandering around about the seals and we way up into hell ahem my name's weeds preach this morning everybody sitting nice real quiet hey isn't that nice hey man praise God my my my we in Revelation 5 the breach question number 4 amen question answers book 4 page 243 question 129 have the seven thunders which equals seven mysteries already been revealed now oh now mind you the Seventh Seal opened but not to the public and that's was throwing off the brothers it wasn't open to the public but it opened he took the seven funnest on the backside and placed it in Revelation 8 1 because your Bible says there was silence nothing is there but on the seventh seal you can read two or three pages here where he says they open that 7 ceiling under there was seven thunders banging one two three four five six seven well who put that there Malachi 4 put it there one full of the threefold 7th seal amen and there it is but it was a secret amen praise God and he's not to be made known to the public but it broke but not to the public in 1963 March 24th but later on amen praise God later on on anointing once at the end time - can't you get it straight now I'm not the son of man a man for his God the Son of man is being revealed to the public it was closed to the public March 24 1963 but then it was a secret he wasn't supposed to tell you he's getting ready to go away he said that the son of man who is the seventh seal is being revealed to the public amen no he says the were they revealed in the seven seals but are yet not known to us as a thunders yet no they were revealed in the seven seals now how did the thunders get into seven seals unless the prophet put it there that's what the thunders was about they was to reveal they come to reveal the book was closed sealed in the seven thunders had uttered their voices and no one can make out what it was John knew what it wasn't John as a type of the brand so the bride down through the seven Church ages knew what it was but John did not know what the seven written seals was that's what a prophet to reveal as a message praise God Eman something moving in here somewhere [Music] I come down seven years of preaching the seven thunders and you come down to real quiet audience [Music] well that's the way it's got to be I suppose John knew what it was but he was forbidden erotic it's about the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven mysteries of the seven thunders would be revealed the mysteries of the thunders the mysteries of it is Jesus Christ the Christ is the word the word is a seed at the son of man so can't you get a straight rather an amen but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven mysteries of the seven thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh church age he made sure he nailed that down so you can't say he got a comeback in some other sort of thunders was revealed in the seventh church age a man he's gone praise God but the thunders is here page 246 a question about if the natural birth requires water blood and spirit does not spiritual birth require all three stages of grace before the person is truly born again absolutely I just explained this morning the same on the same thing you got to have all stages you begotten of the spirit just like a baby is begotten in the womb of a mother we're not born until they receive the Holy Ghost that's right you're born then you're not converted you're in a procession of being converted until that time that's the reason that all these great mysteries could not be given to Luther could not be given to Wesley could not be given to the age that has just passed biased or Pentecostals now the Pentecostals could not get the Misses because they were babies why it wasn't time now watch they were began you mean the Pentecostals what the baptism the Holy Ghost will only be gotten but faith and charity hadn't even come yet the true baptism of the holy ghost it can only come on a person which is the thunders amen so I'll be gotten I got the Holy Ghost that's only a claiming sign you got to walk in the light and rot and dying through you got it I'd better get over there huh praise God I'm just trying to show you that the Pentecost age was only begotten now if a person himself who's he Gilliam seven spirits seven thunders illa illa illa illa Hume the person of Christ himself the son of man you understand revealing himself in human flesh it could not have come till now and he reveals the true baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God now Malachi 4 prophesied about the threefold mystery of God and connected it to the seven thunders in 1962 I was sharing with some of the administer brethren this quote and the quote is found on super sang June 24 1962 Southgate California quote seven voices to be made known let us work Lord for we know we have a much more time to work we see time closing in soon we're looking for the angel that will set his foot on the land and on the sea and raise up his hand and swore by him that lives for ever and ever times shall be no more you said at that time the mystery of God should be finished we understand now father that God's three full mystery has been made known to us 1962 the threefold mystery of God had been made known amen and we understand and are looking now for those mysterious thunders that come out from heaven in the book of Revelation that were sealing up back at a book revealed to us O Lord the things that we need for the battle ahead of us unquote so we see Malachi 4 in 1962 connecting together the mystery of God three fold mystery seven Thunder mystery what is the mystery of God I want to be on the ending beginning and ending of a Gentile dispensation one 1955 in the end this is a xerox pope's you know at that time Michael shall stand the great Prince Michael was Christ of course who fought to angelic wars in heaven with the devil Satan Michael fought together for against each other rather and now at at that time he said as many as were found written in the book was delivered and those who had done righteous watch it close and that in the wise mfer reason on the wrong page here here we are a man now without Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end for many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall increase then I Daniel beheld and look and behold there stood mother to one on this side of the bank of the river and the one on the other side of the bank of the river and then once said to the man clothed in linen the Holy Spirit which was upon the waters people's multitudes holy ghosts upon the people let there be a separation upon the waters separate the bride waters from the church waters and the Holy Spirit is standing upon the water amen people's and multitudes and Holy Ghost upon the people the Spirit of God moved upon the water oh how to live the Holy Ghost revelations says that the thickness and multitude the waters means thickness multitudes of people and here's one in white linen wagon himself up bend down upon the waters with his hands to heaven walking on top of you swearing that time shall be no more Lord walk on me a bit on and nobody else want you to walk on them put them thunders on me and swear [Applause] [Music] amen I said the Son of man has walked on a pride and swore that time shall be no more when I was almost up and it's still trying to figure out is the Seventh Seal open the Elias has already come they know of a message this is the message a man when his hands up to heaven swam by him that lives forever and ever when these things happen time shall be no more hallelujah time shall be no more swore that when we see these nations breaking and things taking place like that the mystery of God is already accomplished the threefold mystery of God has already been made playing what is this great mystery of God God in you the hope of glory amen shining forth that gives you the Holy Ghost when these things take place times shall be no more when you get a revelation that your name is in that book and they are not Devils inhale the stop it amen when you get a revelation that illa illa illa whom is your father when that takes place time shall be no more and that is now taking place now now are we the sons of God it does not appear what we shall be No we know we know when he shall appear we shall be why because Gila L ahem is now ready to step into 16 elements hallelujah you and we now have the last prayer in the Bible quick into us even so come now Lord Jesus [Applause] we are ready if the tan shall be no war amen they didn't know their God whose God Elohim they that noella him in the last days many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall
