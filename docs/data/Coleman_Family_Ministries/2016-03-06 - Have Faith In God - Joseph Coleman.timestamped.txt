[0:00] so uh would you turn with me to the word
[0:02] of God St John 5 the 5th chapter I want
[0:06] to read from there and um don't even
[0:10] have all my scriptures together we've
[0:12] been rushing all day we were to have
[0:15] some of the Kentucky Colonel's chicken
[0:17] today but he closed up on
[0:19] us the only one in New York and we got
[0:22] all thrown off there but we finally
[0:25] found a delicatess to go to and rush
[0:28] back so you pray for us
[0:31] tonight uh I'm want to read from St Mark
[0:34] 11th chapter the 22nd verse and the 23rd
[0:40] verse I'm reading from St John the 5th
[0:45] chapter after this there was a feast of
[0:50] the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
[0:54] now there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep
[0:57] Market a pool which is called in the
[1:00] Hebrew tongue
[1:03] basa having five
[1:05] porches in these lay a great multitude
[1:08] of importent folk of blind halt withered
[1:11] waiting for the moving of the water for
[1:15] an angel went down at a certain season
[1:18] into the pool and troubled the water
[1:21] whosoever then first after the troubling
[1:23] of the water stepped in was made whole
[1:26] of whatsoever disease he had and a
[1:30] certain man was there which had an
[1:31] infirmity 3 and8 years when Jesus saw
[1:35] him lie and knew that he had been now a
[1:38] long time in that case he saith unto him
[1:41] wilt thou be made whole the important
[1:44] man answered him sir I have no man when
[1:48] the waters trouble to put me into the
[1:50] pool but while I'm coming another steth
[1:54] down before me Jesus saith unto him rise
[1:57] take up thy bed and walk
[2:00] and now St Mark 11th chapter
[2:03] 22 and Jesus answered and saith unto
[2:06] them have faith in God for verily I say
[2:10] unto you that whosoever shall say unto
[2:14] this mountain be thou removed be thou
[2:16] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[2:19] his heart but shall believe that those
[2:21] things which he saith shall come to pass
[2:24] he shall have whatsoever he saith may
[2:27] God a blessing to the reading of his
[2:28] word I take a thought from here a a
[2:31] title here I'd like to take a little
[2:34] subtitle here um have faith in
[2:38] God uh let us uh go to the author of the
[2:42] book for a word of prayer our heavenly
[2:45] father we truly thank you dear God to be
[2:49] found alive in Jesus Christ tonight
[2:52] Hallelujah and God as we feel the moving
[2:56] of the water sprinkling up over us
[2:58] tonight Lord we want to thank you God
[3:01] for the blessings for the word of the
[3:04] Lord and father we thank you for eternal
[3:07] life God we thank you for the blood that
[3:11] we know we can come here tonight Lord
[3:13] and we can be washed clean of our sins
[3:18] Lord what a confidence to have in this
[3:21] hour to know that there is one that
[3:24] loves us hallelujah God there's one that
[3:27] will take care of us that that knows us
[3:30] all about us just like this lame man
[3:33] here was laying at the pool that knew
[3:35] all about him you knew all about him
[3:37] Lord all those 38 years he laid there
[3:40] and God you know every one of us here
[3:42] tonight father you knew us from the
[3:44] foundation of the world you made us Lord
[3:47] thusly as we are now Heavenly Father
[3:50] tonight we pray that you'd bless the
[3:52] reading of the word bless the hearing of
[3:54] it and God uh bring us to a Faith Lord
[3:58] that we could accept everything written
[4:01] in this word as it is our word for you
[4:04] said if we say Lord that that thought
[4:08] keeps striking my heart if ye say God we
[4:11] would pray that you would make the word
[4:13] in us as one one thought one Mind One
[4:18] Faith and God by your grace and your
[4:22] mercy you could bring us to that place
[4:25] that we know we must stand at yes that
[4:28] position and and then we'll see the Fire
[4:31] Fall Heavenly Father we are looking for
[4:34] it God we desire it in our hearts so we
[4:37] pray that you bless this little message
[4:39] tonight I don't know what to say Lord I
[4:41] ask for Grace to give me strength Lord
[4:43] and may the Holy Spirit my God come down
[4:46] tonight and pour out his Spirit upon the
[4:48] people well we pray and we ask it in
[4:51] jesus' name and for his sake
[4:55] amen well um the little thought I have
[4:58] tonight have faith in
[5:01] God um I believe all of us here take off
[5:05] my coat a little
[5:06] warm are are looking for Apostolic times
[5:10] moving Among Us can we say amen amen
[5:13] amen amen we're not dead no we are alive
[5:17] Amen in Jesus Christ Hallelujah and we
[5:20] are moving now the holy spirit is moving
[5:23] through US Amen to Quicken us to the
[5:25] word of God his promises and but we know
[5:29] how that perfect faith has to bring it
[5:33] see because like we said the the uh we
[5:37] have to be in position to have that
[5:40] Faith see now his
[5:44] disciples they they had the power but
[5:47] not the faith see just perfect faith I'm
[5:50] speaking about Jesus gave them power and
[5:53] sent them out see the word gave them the
[5:56] power cast out Devils heal the sick rais
[6:00] the dead see and the same word right
[6:03] here this written word right here
[6:06] written form has given us power in this
[6:08] day raise the Dead cast out devils and
[6:12] also heal the sick and so forth these
[6:14] signs shall follow them that believe see
[6:17] but it takes that perfect Faith to move
[6:20] the power in the word see and so
[6:23] therefore we are growing into that
[6:27] excuse me and we know that the prophet
[6:30] of God has taught us away from that all
[6:33] that emotion I got it and you don't have
[6:36] it that's only emotion you think you got
[6:39] it cuz he's taught us well he's taught
[6:42] us that real faith is
[6:44] substance and when you see a man with
[6:47] real Faith you know that he knows he's
[6:49] got it for he stands there and the thing
[6:51] happens amen well that's what we want
[6:55] that's that real
[6:56] faith and then to me and and us looking
[7:00] for that
[7:01] faith we actually have faith coming into
[7:04] us for the thing that God is wanting us
[7:07] to do we're doing it while looking at
[7:10] that perfect Faith you follow me now so
[7:14] uh therefore that's what the Lord that's
[7:15] why the word is to be preached that's
[7:18] why you are to be exalted for the
[7:20] promise of God and and is to bring you
[7:23] to a place for that and meanwhile the
[7:26] little simple things they begin to take
[7:28] care of themselves because Without You
[7:30] realizing it you begin to move in the
[7:33] spirit amen and then in looking for this
[7:36] perfect thing you know the things that
[7:38] easily beset you amen you begin to lay
[7:41] them aside just by something inward that
[7:44] little seed of God that's in there
[7:46] that's pushing up like that little Lily
[7:48] amen it's just pushing up it sees that
[7:50] perfect Faith up there and begin to push
[7:52] for it push forward and pretty soon
[7:54] unconsciously it pushes right on out of
[7:56] the shell amen right on through the mud
[7:59] right through all those dirty Waters
[8:01] amen glory to God it gets out in the sun
[8:04] in the sunshine amen then it blossoms
[8:07] out and it begins to reflect Jesus
[8:09] Christ that's exactly what God has been
[8:11] doing with his people here these past
[8:13] years so now we know that they could not
[8:17] cast out that epileptic devil because of
[8:20] the lack of faith and so now we know
[8:23] that um Jesus said whatsoever you desire
[8:26] When you pray believe that you have it
[8:28] and you shall have it so therefore that
[8:32] is his way see and it's it's it's always
[8:35] been his way not to force it on you just
[8:37] to if thou Wilt wil thou be made whole
[8:41] see is this that you have to uh yourself
[8:44] have a desire to want that see and so
[8:48] some want to have a desire to camp on
[8:50] lesser ground see but the real Overcomer
[8:53] the real elected one they have a desire
[8:56] to Camp up on the mountain amen up on
[9:00] the top of the mountain where the sun is
[9:01] shining up there where the Eagles go in
[9:04] amen see so therefore but desire must be
[9:07] there see uh just like um Joshua there
[9:11] he had God's will he knew exactly what
[9:14] God told him you're going to inherit
[9:16] this land he had been on probation
[9:18] because 40 years and he knew God's
[9:21] promise he knew his mind and then when
[9:23] he was given the word go there he went
[9:26] and he was in the line of duty and he
[9:28] didn't even have have to pray he just he
[9:31] knew he had need of it and he just said
[9:33] Son stand still Moon you go to hang over
[9:36] there see he was right in the line of
[9:38] duty he had reached that
[9:41] position amen he had reached that place
[9:44] that he was predestinated to be at in
[9:46] the right time for God had said where
[9:50] the souls of your feet stand that that
[9:52] is your land is that right I will be
[9:55] with you don't turn the left or the
[9:57] right look straight ahead and that's
[10:00] exactly he looked the way to Jesus and
[10:02] he just called and spoke the word see so
[10:05] therefore now Jesus was the word amen
[10:09] and Jesus had faith in what he said
[10:12] would happen see now how did he do it
[10:14] Jesus said I can do nothing in myself
[10:18] the father he doeth The Works see me now
[10:21] so he relied on what he was and he was
[10:28] the word now well he had Faith then in
[10:31] knowing that he himself was the word
[10:34] amen see and he had faith in knowing
[10:36] that God had made him the word so
[10:39] therefore therefore then he by faith he
[10:42] understood that he was the word and
[10:45] that's exactly where God is trying to
[10:48] get this bride to that place where she
[10:52] positively after coming through that's
[10:55] why he had us add to our faith the word
[10:59] M that's why so when you get to that
[11:02] spot when that press comes down see if
[11:05] you just laid around in 63 4 and five
[11:08] waiting you know for the Holy Spirit to
[11:10] fall upon you and never taking the word
[11:12] itself never having trials and tests and
[11:14] so forth never going through these
[11:16] things here when the Press come down you
[11:17] would know what the word was because
[11:20] there's a spirit out here that would
[11:21] deceive the very elected if possible
[11:23] therefore how could you know see but
[11:25] when you know at the word works at this
[11:28] power of God works in me amen and the
[11:31] power of God has worked in your life day
[11:34] in day out you've seen the allmighty
[11:37] power of God working in your life you
[11:40] seen God moving in here moving in there
[11:42] healing in here doing this over here
[11:44] doing that over there you know it works
[11:46] by experience is that right and then all
[11:50] the time God is moving you to that place
[11:53] amen see so therefore Jesus Christ knew
[11:57] because the scriptures said that he was
[11:59] the word he knew that he had perfect
[12:01] faith in the word amen well therefore
[12:05] the Paul said that we are written
[12:06] Epistles we are the scriptures and God
[12:09] has ordained for this age a certain
[12:12] things to happen see and therefore then
[12:15] we should rely on what God said we are
[12:18] as Believers and if he can only get a
[12:21] few Overcomers to really believe it see
[12:25] to really know that that's what I am
[12:28] just like Joseph until his word came
[12:30] true see he was tested and tried and we
[12:33] are tested and tried but that word is
[12:36] going to come true Jesus said it is
[12:39] written of me see so therefore God's
[12:41] trying to get us to a place where we'll
[12:42] say he said if ye say and then one day
[12:46] you'll just hit that spot amen you'll
[12:49] strike that position where then you'll
[12:52] just say it yourself and it'll be so and
[12:55] and the thing about it God is wanting to
[12:58] do that amen
[12:59] he's waiting wanting for somebody to
[13:02] come on and get to that spot there his
[13:04] prophet got there he showed us the way
[13:07] amen and we saw it we know it works amen
[13:09] we know it's true amen praise the Lord
[13:12] see now if we truly believe then the
[13:15] signs will automatically follow for they
[13:18] have got to follow see now you become
[13:22] the word as you receive the word if he
[13:25] abide in me and I abide in you then ask
[13:28] what you will see now we have got to
[13:32] recognize our position as the bride see
[13:35] as he recognized the position his
[13:37] position as the Savior the Redeemer as
[13:40] the word of God as God himself he
[13:42] recognized his position see and the only
[13:44] way you can do that is to walk in the
[13:46] spirit to walk with this word see and
[13:49] therefore and that is our test today
[13:52] before uh uh this is is the way of the
[13:56] Cross and many church people with uh
[13:59] great swelling natural words try to
[14:02] steer you off the course that your
[14:04] father has laid out for you why it'll
[14:07] seem so right in the natural it'll just
[14:09] be so fine and close see but something
[14:13] that seed that Jean amen down inside
[14:17] said that ain't right yeah see I mean
[14:20] now you just know as we say you know
[14:23] that you know that you know amen praise
[14:25] the Lord see me now so therefore you say
[14:27] well that ain't right then somehow You'
[14:30] be burdened down and then maybe you
[14:32] might pick up a tape or you read the
[14:33] word somewhere there it is see and you
[14:36] walking in the spirit then you know
[14:38] you're right and all around you think
[14:40] you're wrong but you know you're right
[14:43] then you see Faith being expressed and
[14:47] that's then God is pleased for them that
[14:49] come to God must believe that he is see
[14:52] to me now friends so therefore this
[14:55] Faith Works by love because you love
[14:57] this word so much the word of God Jesus
[15:00] Christ you want to do all that he is
[15:02] commanding us to do until you can get to
[15:04] the spot like Elijah got to a place to a
[15:07] position I have done all these
[15:09] Commandments at Thy word amen see when
[15:12] the bride comes to that spot she can say
[15:15] that with no condemnation at all she has
[15:19] added all these things according to his
[15:22] word hallelujah you follow me friends
[15:23] see so therefore we are being built now
[15:26] up to a perfect faith and by the perfect
[15:30] word of God to bring on the perfect
[15:32] Jesus Christ who is perfect Faith amen
[15:34] see now uh therefore this is God's
[15:38] challenge to us see now watch I want to
[15:41] say a few things here see what is God
[15:43] doing he's trying to get the Overcomers
[15:47] see to be focused in on the word he's
[15:51] trying to get the Overcomers to come
[15:53] right to that spot and seem like the the
[15:56] holy spirit is just laying in my heart
[15:59] see to uh keep saying this that we've
[16:02] got to focus in on the word I call A A
[16:06] Min brother the other day excuse me and
[16:09] he began to give me a rundown on Tucson
[16:12] and this place and that place when you
[16:14] hear those things you want it if you
[16:17] ain't crazy or something because it
[16:18] sound like you're wrong and all that's
[16:20] right see talk about now so that's when
[16:22] the Holy Spirit spoke me with this
[16:24] thought never mind that what is that to
[16:27] thee follow thou me amen focus in on
[16:31] this
[16:31] word see and when you do you become a
[16:35] Mystic they think you're a nut that
[16:38] right Y is that right odd boy amen see
[16:41] me now but nevertheless you know that
[16:44] the word is the anointing oh my God
[16:47] that's the anointing the word see now
[16:49] and then when you abide in this word you
[16:51] are in the anointing and then you are
[16:54] anointed Jesus's walking around the word
[16:58] that's what you are you abiding right in
[17:00] it see me now and then when that just
[17:02] gets like one then you can ask what you
[17:05] will see that me now friends now because
[17:08] you and him have become the same thing
[17:10] see me now and you can only become that
[17:12] by taking this word see it is Christ in
[17:15] you and you in Christ see and now and
[17:18] the mind that was in Christ that same
[17:20] mind is working in you through this
[17:23] anointed word You Follow Me Now other
[17:26] words Paul said over in Romans 12 he he
[17:28] said be not uh I besee you therefore
[17:31] Brethren not to be conformed to this
[17:32] world but be ye watch that he's speaking
[17:34] about persons who already were they had
[17:38] the holy spirit in the soul that right
[17:40] so he was tell them how to be because
[17:42] transformed by the renewing of what the
[17:44] mind the spirit that right by bringing
[17:47] in the word and have their Spirits
[17:49] renewed that's exactly what we're doing
[17:51] now our spirit is being renewed being
[17:54] transfigured because transformed see me
[17:56] now so therefore the mind that was in
[17:59] Christ see was to fulfill the father's
[18:03] word that was the mind that was in Jesus
[18:05] Christ see he was the word then when you
[18:09] us and the word can get focused together
[18:12] see talking about now see the Holy
[18:14] Spirit himself he is this great
[18:18] anointing here now the sun right in the
[18:20] sea well the Holy Spirit see he takes
[18:23] that word and we sitting here and he
[18:26] takes the word and brings it into our
[18:28] focus and we begin to Blink a little bit
[18:31] see me now and then he you like you go
[18:33] blurry like you here see and then all of
[18:34] a sudden boom there it is he got to
[18:37] bring it there yeah you say oh I see
[18:39] that see me Bo that's him bringing it in
[18:41] there like that see because your ey is a
[18:43] camera and the Holy Spirit just brings
[18:45] that word and what's supposed to be
[18:47] right to its spot he focus it in for you
[18:51] when you see it then your eyes is washed
[18:53] with PTI amen See Me Now other words
[18:57] just like a camera you have a camera you
[18:59] take the camera and you take your little
[19:01] finder on there the site finder there
[19:04] and you begin to focus in your picture
[19:06] you want to get the picture sent it
[19:08] right and so forth and you know because
[19:09] balance off just right if if you're
[19:11] doing because it's a photography see so
[19:14] therefore before you snap the picture
[19:16] you want to have a perfect picture is
[19:18] that right therefore you must focus it
[19:20] in so therefore by taking the sight of
[19:23] your camera see and bring it to the
[19:25] place to where you can just see that all
[19:30] things is possible you follow me now if
[19:33] you could take the camera of the word of
[19:34] God and bring it to what what these
[19:36] because Apostles saw you follow me now
[19:39] Look through this camera and see the
[19:41] same picture that they saw look through
[19:44] the camera and see the same gospel that
[19:47] they preached see me it will produce the
[19:49] same results are you follow me friends
[19:52] see therefore if you take the camera the
[19:55] word and focus it in on that word see it
[19:58] will hit the target amen that's right
[20:01] now no matter what the church critics
[20:04] say now you got the camera the church
[20:08] critics don't see what you're seeing
[20:10] because the Holy Spirit has focused in
[20:12] for
[20:13] you and they're trying to look and see
[20:15] what you're see and you looking right at
[20:16] it and you seeing that these signs shall
[20:19] follow them that believe and how do you
[20:22] know it already hit the target already
[20:24] 2,000 years ago you know it's right it's
[20:26] right here then you seem to same God
[20:29] come down and confirm it and do it all
[20:32] over again amen and then your eyes is
[20:35] focused in on that the church because
[20:37] critics they don't see that well only

[20:41] is supposed to happen over here and
[20:42] that's supposed to happen over there you
[20:43] say shut up I got the because I have it
[20:46] focused I see I know what I'm talking
[20:48] about I was blind and now I see I can
[20:51] see now amen praise the Lord see and it
[20:54] is exactly in focus with the word I know
[20:57] it will work cuz they had already hit
[21:00] the target amen praise the Lord see then
[21:03] if we see the vision that they saw see
[21:05] same thing then you will cast out Devils
[21:08] you will heal the sick you will raise
[21:09] the dead for it already hit the same
[21:12] Target amen praise the Lord see now it
[21:15] will bring forth a glorious Church see

[21:23] off and get a little blurred up we see
[21:25] man's Z day over here that ain't right
[21:27] so just because keep f away from there
[21:29] ideas over here opinions over there what
[21:31] he said over there that ain't right but
[21:33] get it focused right on that word you

[27:32] can look at it sure but I want it to be
[27:34] here right now living amen I want the

[27:49] want to see a picture right here in New
[27:50] York do you want to see the same thing
[27:53] well let's get zeroed in on the word and
[27:55] you'll see it happen amen praise be to
[27:58] God Amen see so therefore now watch but
[28:02] when you are snapping your picture you
[28:04] got to focus out all doubt all unbelief
[28:08] Abraham did that right God gave him a
[28:10] picture there he got the picture just
[28:12] right and his picture was all Faith
[28:15] that's right no and when it got a little
[28:16] blur it was doubt over there and he
[28:18] scooted in around like his said and got
[28:19] it just right amen Focus out all
[28:23] unbelief Focus out all doubt all sin
[28:27] amen am just focus in zero in on faith
[28:31] and it'll strike the target every time
[28:34] praise be to God see me now and now when
[28:37] you're really
[28:38] focused in on the target you'll know
[28:42] your position and the Winds of Doctrine
[28:44] can't bother you you won't even worry
[28:47] about the
[28:48] goats you find that goats will come and
[28:50] say you know is sure nice over there
[28:52] shut your mouth keep moving you f the
[28:55] prophet said so shut your mouth what he
[28:57] said didn't he amen praise the Lord amen
[29:00] praise the Lord see so therefore you
[29:02] know why because you have an original
[29:06] picture that right I mean it's not like
[29:09] you didn't see the picture you see it
[29:11] right here and it's made so plainly on
[29:13] the tapes and you saw it living so
[29:16] therefore when the Holy Spirit Focus
[29:18] your eyes on that picture you say that's
[29:21] what I want you follow me now and then
[29:24] you know how they live then Focus your
[29:26] life into their life
[29:28] how they walked because how they lived
[29:30] what they did and you begin to do the
[29:32] same thing then the Holy Spirit Will
[29:35] snap that picture of you doing that amen
[29:38] praise the Lord see then you'll see the
[29:41] same life hitting that same Target see
[29:45] so therefore then you won't care what
[29:46] anybody says see now only the Holy
[29:50] Spirit can take the camera of your eyes
[29:53] see and let you see listen to to what
[29:57] I'm going to say now only the Holy
[29:59] Spirit can take the camera of your own
[30:01] natural eyes and let you see what is his
[30:05] purpose and what he is amen right amen
[30:09] and when you once see what he is and
[30:12] what his purpose is what he did back
[30:14] there when you see it he is the same
[30:17] yesterday today and forever only he can
[30:20] do that now and watch see me now you see
[30:24] because Moses let the Holy Spirit take
[30:27] the camera his eyes one day and look out
[30:30] to see his purpose and God's purpose was
[30:33] that Israel was a covenant people is
[30:37] that right so Moses looked out there and
[30:39] got it and got it focused just right and
[30:41] here was Israel beat down slave that
[30:44] right he said no let me Focus out the
[30:47] slave part focus in promised people part
[30:51] amen when he got that picture just right
[30:53] now Pharaoh looked without the holy
[30:55] spirit amen he saw slaves mud doers amen
[30:59] is that right so therefore therefore he
[31:01] had doubt so therefore he focusing all
[31:03] the doubt out there and said because
[31:04] there ain't nothing out there let's kill
[31:06] him and so forth see but therefore Moses
[31:08] he looked and he saw God's people out
[31:11] there and then he got his eyes focused
[31:13] just right and he saw who he was and he
[31:16] knew who he was and then the
[31:18] supernatural God began to move see so
[31:20] there therefore let us have faith in God
[31:23] see and look to his promise now now I
[31:26] want to say something here notice this
[31:28] now striking
[31:29] statement Faith about five more minutes
[31:33] see faith is designed to see what God
[31:38] wills and
[31:40] wants is it sing in now Faith is
[31:43] designed to see what God Wills what God
[31:48] wills and what God wants now watch there
[31:52] is no human
[31:55] knowledge wisdom
[31:57] scientific nothing F out that can do
[32:01] that I let it s see faith is designed to
[32:05] see what God wills and what God wants
[32:08] there's no knowledge that can do that
[32:11] faith alone is designed by God to give
[32:14] to the human race to find out what the
[32:17] will of God is MH get it only Faith
[32:22] therefore without faith it is impossible
[32:24] to please
[32:25] God now if your faith doesn't focus with
[32:30] the word but leave it alone today I'm
[32:33] speaking about now many I say I got
[32:36] faith I got faith I got faith but if a
[32:38] with that word you better get away from
[32:40] it I don't care what they're doing in
[32:42] the flesh making a great show in the
[32:44] that don't mean nothing there but if
[32:45] it's not on that word you better leave
[32:47] it alone see therefore faith is designed
[32:50] to see what God wants because how do you
[32:52] see it through the camera of his
[32:54] promised
[32:55] word that's how you see it see me now
[32:58] through the camera of his promised word
[32:59] see this word here is the full
[33:02] revelation of God see now all it needs
[33:05] is a little fire to set it off see now
[33:09] um when you focusing on the word you
[33:12] don't care what happens see you don't
[33:14] care what they say you just keep walking
[33:16] and this hour now see why see you're
[33:19] looking at the Target you saw the target
[33:22] through the cam of your eyes and the
[33:23] target was this early church that right
[33:26] and God struck the tget once before and
[33:29] he promised to do it again you know that
[33:32] positively you know he is the same
[33:35] yesterday today and forever he's the
[33:37] same today therefore God watch is
[33:39] wanting us tonight I'm talking about to
[33:42] watch for the supernatural moving see me
[33:46] now see God backs up his word with signs
[33:49] it right he vindicates his word he
[33:51] Vindicated his Prophet with signs
[33:53] wonders Miracles gifts of the Holy Ghost
[33:57] and we are his bride so I'm trying to
[33:59] get to show you we're coming to a spot
[34:01] but we got to be watching and looking
[34:04] and waiting for it are you follow me
[34:07] friends come on now amen see like this
[34:10] lame man here wil thou be made whole the
[34:13] man had laid in this condition because
[34:15] for about 38 years and when Christ come
[34:18] ask him this little question there see
[34:21] he said I have no
[34:23] man to put me in there and that's the
[34:27] trouble tonight
[34:28] there are people the minister the
[34:30] minister the minister see they they
[34:33] can't get that out of their mind for 38
[34:36] years he got no man to do it see don't
[34:39] wait on man right see because God has
[34:42] called he that overcome it
[34:46] individuals God is making it that each
[34:48] one of you are having experiences your
[34:50] own selves God has made it that we even
[34:54] pulled
[34:55] away not by choice by the will of God in
[34:59] 65 the Holy Spirit say pull away from
[35:02] them let them have their own experiences
[35:05] so we pulled away and some didn't like
[35:08] it some didn't understand it see talking
[35:09] about now but had to go on anyway you
[35:12] have got to have an experience with God
[35:14] or you'll never know God you'll never
[35:17] know him for yourself and you have got
[35:19] to know God for yourself in this hour or
[35:22] you cannot stand you perish you must
[35:24] know God you follow me friends amen each
[35:27] individual must know God and this man
[35:30] here he met God he said I have no man to
[35:33] put me in the water and the Lord Jesus
[35:35] stand and the Lord Jesus knew all about
[35:37] him just like he knows about you and I
[35:39] see and so what happened here the
[35:41] situation here it was God's will they
[35:43] knew God's will you know and they was
[35:45] watching for it see it was God's will to
[35:48] have a supernatural sign at a certain
[35:51] time of a season the water would be
[35:53] troubled the water would because begin
[35:56] to move is that right friends therefore
[35:59] they waited and they watched and they
[36:02] looked for that Supernatural sign and
[36:06] when they saw it they all tried to get
[36:08] in there and this fell here because he
[36:10] wasn't the worst there but it was the
[36:12] father's will to heal that man it was
[36:15] God's Will and the word went right to
[36:16] him I was just listening now watch Jesus
[36:20] Christ walked by let's say a whole
[36:23] Hospital full of people laying there is
[36:26] that right m and yet today we here oh we
[36:29] got to clean out the hospitals glory to
[36:32] God I'll walk into the hospital and I'll
[36:34] clean them out I just heard a tape this
[36:36] week brother BR said let me drop
[36:38] something to you my Pentecostal Brothers
[36:40] he said I know what you're thinking
[36:41] you're thinking you're waiting for some
[36:43] men to rise up on the earth that's going
[36:45] to go in the hospitals and because clean
[36:47] them out he said that is a lie he said
[36:50] Jesus Christ moved by the spirit he
[36:53] moved to one man here wil thou be made
[36:56] whole left the rest in a worse condition
[37:00] and what that that man could get up over
[37:02] there could get up over there lame see
[37:04] him in now but he left them there halt
[37:06] laying blind laying down there and walk
[37:09] right by them it was the father's will
[37:11] led by the spirit of God to go to one
[37:14] person so you thinking this bride's
[37:16] going to go into and clean out the
[37:17] hospital you got another thing coming
[37:18] the prophet said that is a lie and yet
[37:21] there are those that day who believe
[37:22] that believe they got all kind of great
[37:23] ministry to go into hospitals could
[37:25] clean them out the prophy that is a lie
[37:28] this bride she'll move and walk in the
[37:31] spirit of the Living God hallelujah
[37:32] she'll say nothing except her father
[37:35] show it to her he'll show her his word
[37:38] and she's obedient to the to her husband
[37:41] and she walks right at whatever it is
[37:42] but when she gets there perfect Faith
[37:44] whatever it is it happens just like that
[37:47] see mean now so therefore these PE uh
[37:50] they move with faith therefore have
[37:54] faith in God for I believe right at this
[37:56] very hour we are now in the time of life
[38:00] right in here now this in the spring and
[38:02] so forth through here this season in
[38:03] here where everybody expecting something
[38:05] to happen is that right they all looking
[38:07] for something to happen there but
[38:08] therefore we pointed you to the word
[38:11] pointed you to the word each message is
[38:14] coming down if you if you've been
[38:15] noticing all day if you say you got to
[38:18] ask for it you follow me that your words

[38:25] your faith up to a
[38:28] where you could just say uh speak you
[38:31] follow me now see me now because it's
[38:33] got to be that way for God to move in
[38:36] other words it's got to be under
[38:38] expectation looking for Anna was looking
[38:40] to see because the Messiah and so was
[38:43] Simeon and right the Holy Spirit had
[38:45] said that they would see it and they was
[38:47] expecting under expectation and when it
[38:50] happened then the thing went see now
[38:53] wilt thou be because made whole now to
[38:57] me today in this hour in closing the
[39:00] seventh angel has troubled the
[39:03] water it's the supernatural sign that we
[39:06] was waiting for the seventh angel
[39:08] troubled the water amen the water that
[39:11] was still laid still in the Book of
[39:14] Revelation for 2,000 years yeah amen
[39:16] that water began to move in ' 63 amen
[39:20] and therefore we didn't say uh no man

[39:51] you looking for the supernatural sign of
[39:53] God see then uh therefore this sign of
[39:57] God moved in a certain season now God
[40:00] vindicates his word right now Noah had
[40:02] preached 120 years Noah that right he
[40:06] preached and he watched and he waited
[40:10] finally the ark was built but Noah was
[40:12] still after preaching looking for a
[40:15] supernatural sign the rains and the
[40:18] Reigns come and then he knew that was a
[40:21] confirmation the evidence the answer to
[40:24] his prayer amen amen amen see it come
[40:28] see God shows it to you then when he saw
[40:30] the rain he knew he was all
[40:32] right amen see me now he saw the PCT he

[40:37] he was safe there was a sign because
[40:40] answered prayer and he was all Let The
[40:42] Rains come now you follow me now friends
[40:44] praise the Lord all right then we are
[40:47] not dead sitting around here watching
[40:49] see come on now we alive see and
[40:51] therefore we we've been watching for the
[40:53] supernatural sign he said I'll ride the
[40:56] trail one more time
[40:57] amen now that's Supernatural and he's
[41:00] going to do it and I'm watching and I'm
[41:02] waiting for it are you waiting for it
[41:05] I'm looking for it yes sir now watch
[41:07] because in closing because Elijah looked
[41:10] for rain to bring help to the people now
[41:13] it was about the fourth year that Elijah
[41:16] walked out there see after shutting up
[41:18] the Heavens could could neither do or
[41:21] rain then in the third year God said go
[41:23] on down and show yourself the word
[41:25] showed itself because in the third year
[41:27] you know last year everything come up
[41:29] last year you understand that right sold
[41:31] de seed and so forth Elijah walked out
[41:33] there and we all know the story because
[41:35] about because because how he challenged
[41:36] those false prophets and so forth the
[41:38] fire come down but the thing I'm trying
[41:40] to strike here is the last part of the
[41:42] 18th chapter there now watch he told his
[41:46] servant uh uh he told because servant
[41:49] the servant had looked one time for rain
[41:51] he didn't see nothing come back all
[41:53] disgusted I didn't see
[41:55] nothing so me now you know like like
[41:57] some people like uh something going to
[41:59] happen Easter you know and you preach
[42:02] and you sing and so forth I didn't see
[42:04] nothing follow me now see and down goes
[42:08] the faith nobody told anybody that you
[42:11] follow me now so you stay with the word
[42:13] amen amen amen praise the Lord see so
[42:16] Elijah said no no no no he said go back
[42:19] and look seven times MH is that right so
[42:22] therefore when he looked the seventh
[42:24] time in the fourth year thing happened
[42:26] amen see therefore now watch though see
[42:29] Elijah had already heard by faith before
