TRANSCRIPT
========================================
And oh my, what a promise. My now God trying to place his church in position to manifest himself. God trying to get New York City, Lindrove, Tucson, different places in position. What position? Our position, justification, sanctification, the gifts and the Holy Ghost. No way past there. the word adoption, the spoken word, the resurrection power in this position. Oh, what a what a position so that he can manifest himself. The word. Yes, sir. Getting one that he can work through like this. There's my spirit flowing freely. I can work there. Oh, would it be wonderful tonight that he could work through New York City in the third pool? He could point around this country and around the world. There's New York City. There's something about New York City. I'm working through there. Oh, I've already started already. Amen. See, but then some people pressed on in the Holy Ghost since 1906 and they went on over. See, but that was only the fruit. See, that was only a foretaste to earnest the down payment. But in 1906, my God says, Joshua, take over the people into the land. Amen. So Malachi 4 goes out with a little gift and here like I was saying Sunday cuz he had a thing on his arm here a little sign there and the Holy Spirit hung right here and says it's it's cancer it's a tumor it's this is that and it and they looked at that you know and the voice spoke over here see they didn't know what was going on and all those years in 1963 seven angels appeared and told William Brandham take the church over into the pillow fire land amen take them on over Joshua commission was a two-fold commission. Take them over and then divide the land, the inheritance years later. So William Brandham took us in, gave us the message, put it on tapes and book and God took them away and now we're in the land. Amen. And that's why there's nobody here in front of me. Oh, what wonderful odds. What odds? I looked around this entire country in 1965. The prophet was gone. I said, "Well, there's nobody tell me because what I can do and I'm going to take the land for myself, brother, get out of my way. You can't tell me." I said, "I know what it is." Yes, sir. He said, "Every place where the soul of your foot, my soul of my foot stepped down into virtue." He said, "You can have it." Soul of my foot stepped down into knowledge. He said, "You can have it." Yes, sir. The soul of my foot went down into temperance. You can have it into patience. You can have it. Amen. Into godness. You can have it into brotherly kindness. Yes, you can have it. Don't you remember down there in Georgia, I was hearing back the tape. Oh, if you hear it back, it's right on there. What I'm saying tonight, it's right there on the tape. I said, "Oh, church and the Holy Spirit swept in." I said, "Oh, Georgia, tonight." I said the Philistines is crying out. They saying don't let them get the revelation of brotherly kindness. If they ever get it, we are finished. We devils are finished. We can't wreck the church no more. If the people can only have a forgiven spirit. That's in Georgia. It's funnier in Georgia. And woke up the entire America. I hope you get it, New York. Come on. Wake up New York. Already happened in Georgia already. Come back in. Give them holy decency. Position them in Christ. Now send down a capstone. Brother, she's coming down in here. You better get ready for it. The Philistines only back up in the adoption. Yeah. They won't back up. All their sin and the unbelief won't go out. See? Yes, sir. Joshua was fighting those Philistines and whatn not there and the sun was going down. He needed some more light to to see those devils so he could could kill some more demons for the glory of the Lord. And I'm asking for some more light tonight to kill those devils. Those Philistines upon the people that's keeping them back from the promise of God. Yes sir. And you know one thing, he has sent it. He has sent it. Amen. Yes sir. Oh, praise God. Praise God.
