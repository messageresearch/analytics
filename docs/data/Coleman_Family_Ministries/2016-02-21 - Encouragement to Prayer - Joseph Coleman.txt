========================================
Amen Let Us bow our heads in a word of prayer as we approach the message this morning our heavenly father we truly praise you and thank you for your goodness and God we bless thy Wonderful Name than for we know that there's not another name given whereby under heaven where we shall be saved and Lord we praise you and thank you for all your goodness and for what has done for us God only through your grace and your love it has been thy will this day that we should be gathered here and you in your mercy and love thou has come down God and call us out of these Troublesome times and Lord we thank you Lord God for the hope that thou has put within us Lord as we see these things here in the world today we can walk God the streets of this Sodom a condition here Lord with our shoulders back heads up looking up for we know that our Redemption draweth nigh we know God that we have purchased the field we know God that the deed has been open the backside of it and we know and we have understood your terms and your condition that was sealed up and Lord God we are trying with all within us Lord to meet these conditions but we're so happy Lord that thou is making it possible for you yourself are has come down the seed of God the spirit of the Lord and is in us working out your own conditions conditions molding and shaping us into the form of the Son of God we praise you and thank you for this Lord and now God may you come down this morning and bless thy people Lord may you comfort those God that have need of it heal the sick Lord and go out to New Jersey to Sister Francis Lord God that hospital there touch her body there Lord and God may she be every withhold bless all of those that have not been able to gather here this morning in the Lord father we pray that thy blessings be upon them this morning now father bless your word and come down and fellowship with us this day but we ask it in Jesus name amen well we certainly praise the Lord amen to be here amen and it's good to see the people in God's house once again uh tonight's message is the Easter seal and to me is uh this is the appropriate time to be playing such a tremendous message as the Easter seal and next week would be the rising of the Sun and after we don't know praise the Lord so um we're certainly happy to hear about sister Francis Whitaker uh in the hospital and how God touched her body and so forth and how he is mending her and in that uh Wednesday um feeling a letter Wednesday when we got the call from Brother Richmond last Tuesday and uh things happened here in the church what with the somebody broke in here last Tuesday into the church there and tried to steal but there was nothing to steal and we just believe that the presence of God because convicted them for from taking anything in here because God is here see and so we thank the Lord for that and so these things being then the call coming from Brother Richmond and sister Francis being in the hospital there and then because immediately it took us to prayer and then Wednesday afternoon I was asking the Lord for a sign that if he would had me to go out to see our sister or whether to come down here and to have prayer and I got home and the sign came because she said that she was feeling better because we had prayed people had prayed and there was my sign to come here and in that coming here we had a little special prayer here if you remember it seemed like hardly the people could be able to pray 12 minutes seemed to be so weak you know you couldn't hear nothing coming forth you begin to wonder that wasn't anything coming forth you see so just noting that and a sister uh last week asking me last Sunday night telling me about her condition about because hard to pray which we all know it is you see so that sort of struck up on my heart and began to think about it and so the lord gave me a little message this morning because about prayer and and I I trust that it it'll be a blessing to everyone this morning because if there's one thing that we have to do that is to exercise our ministry as believer priest and as believer priest no matter where you are no matter where your home on the job on the subway in jail wherever is at that's one Ministry that you can exercise is that right amen you can exercise that Ministry anytime and the other part of it giving thanks unto God with the fruit of our lips that's all it requires a lot of people they don't want to do a work for the Lord there is right there amen that's the greatest work that you could do for the Lord is to lay on your face in this hour and pray one for the other you couldn't do a greater work see because in that you have entered into your secret closet and there all the little things that annoy you that you can't overcome you ask the father in secret he removes them in secret so when you come here the others don't see those things you follow me now but if you'll never go in there those things stay with you out in the open then the other see these things you see I mean now so therefore you go in secret into your prayer closet then there are those say that they can't pray well we want to exalt you with love this morning that you've got to pray you just must pray you see so uh because um James said the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous veth much am for uh it is through prayer prayer is asking so God has all of his blessings laying there if you never ask for the blessings through prayer how can you get themen we can walk around say well I'm tired I'm worried but if you have the strength to say I'm tired brother I'm weary sister Well you certainly can have the strength to fall down on the ground and fall out and say Lord God Almighty help me same strength amen amen and even in in a better position on the floor where you don't have to use because you stay on the floor that's all amen amen praise the Lord just trying to exalt you to come to the place that we could approach the message this morning now um so I believe that we all are standing in a need of prayer I know there one Ministry because I lack in for time and everything else I I just wish that I could have a a a Ministry where I had time but with working and all these things you just don't have the time but I believe that we that we have some people here that are praying for us that is the greatest need that we pray one for the other cuz if you can only understand it see it is the the blessings of God you ask for them and the father knows what you need amen but you got to come and ask for it if if my little children there if they want something because I we'll give it to them but they don't ask for it how do you know what they they want so is that right see so our father he tells us to ask for it so in this hour now you or we are wary and we're tired but uh God has a way to uh encourage us to prayer and I like to be encouraged to Prayer by the word that's the Bible Way see uh you know see and because this is what he's going to honor is the word of God so therefore we want to turn to the word of God this morning now the the lesson is found in Ephesians the 1 chapter the 15th verse through the 20th verse you're writing it down St Matthew the 7th chapter verse 7 and 8 Jeremiah the 33rd chapter verse three now you be praying as we bringing forth the message this morning [Music] this seems that we're in the book of Ephesians in and out you know I thought about it it was just odd this year how see like the Lord has been dealing in threes since January I think it was just January that the lord gave the messages to me here the Christ all astronaut the the crucified ones and forsaken then crown and then reflecting back and thinking about those messages right in threes uh it was uh uh the Holy Spirit telling us the type of ministry what we must do because uh be crucified in Christ is the As and all these things they shown us all of these types and G and coming down by Revelation and giving us understanding of the Apollo 8 and 7 and 9 and all these things here see God is doing something see and then not preaching at all in February and coming back in March the first three messages uh coming Faith worketh by love if I if that's correct and then um The Way of the Cross and then the following one which I knew I had to preach something else about love not knowing just what it was then forgiving see that was in in the Times paper they I saw it and just tied in together Holy Spirit then it was finished it's it's three so now it seems like come right back to again to Faith again see and and seem like God has tied in with this prayer seeking knocking see so perhaps the Lord will give another series of three see leading right up to Easter I don't know but it's I just feel moving into that vein see I just feel that we are in the season I feel that we in the time Hallelujah where God has been leading by his spirit and he's doing a work which is beautiful to see we're just following see but he's just moving and then you stop and reflect back and see what he's doing see and then you give praise to God when you see what he's doing so I feel at this Junction of time it is time to encourage the people to pray and to seek the Lord amen see because I want to show you this morning that it is while in this state see this condition that the holy spirit moves on the scene you follow me now see but he must himself not through emotion get you all worked up hallelujah we're going to oh the holy spirit because because come down and glory to God no by the word it must come by the word thank you Lord so we don't try to work you up and tell you we all be in one place and hallelujah we're going to be baptized no sir see just going along preaching day by day and when the hour comes with the right message and then strike it see me now and then he reveals to his people what his will is then those that know it's the will of God by experience not by head knowledge but sitting here God has revealed to their hearts with a revelation is an experience is a birth into the word that's right see each step each way of the word must be a birth as brother Kurt and I were talking about the Adams and think all is a birth and then brother BR himself said on the uh Blasphemous names he said you have been birthed into virtue you have been birthed amen into knowledge you have been birthed into patience birthed into godliness birthed into brotherly kindness and birthed into love then that has come by experience not because brother brandham said so or the Bible says so well we must have love no God has come down and and come in the heart and and come in there and you know that word becomes flesh in you and then you walk in and you live it amen amen see so now I pray this morning that that the the the the hour that we're living in that you will be birthed into the knowledge by Revelation that this is the season the time that these blessings must come I will restore sayith the Lord hallelujah amen we've talked about it we sang about it we have worship God about it but I believe with all this me that we have we are entering into the season I don't know what day Jesus there no special day but just you got to be cuz I check through the Bible and I find that when the time comes for a thing to happen he begins to prepare the heart that's what that's in the Bible that I can say so therefore it's not if the holy spirit is coming because it is coming amen amen the Holy Spirit himself the word is here the mechanics but the dyamics is coming that is thus sayith the Lord see and it's coming to you God will suddenly come to his Temple but that Temple must be prepared the right way Hallelujah even Solomon they when that Temple was built it was built with certain Stones everything was all fixed the right way and when they begin to praise God and when everything begin to get together amen then the fire come down and fill the whole house amen and when we by our Bible promise by the word of God in season birth into it amen in that condition of a pregnant woman you understand am amen praise God Amen that sweetness comes around and then that Earth comes forward he it's coming because it's in you now you're being formed and shapen by the power of God the power of God is the word of God hallelujah all it needs is fire to strength it hadn't even started preach yet amen praise the Lord so now I want to turn to Ephesians 1 15 through 20 I'm inspired this morning am amen I mean say I know is going to happen amen and I know that God has channeled this group here I'm talking about you amen see he has his Prophet has espoused you to Jesus Christ he's given certain promises that are going to happen and giving you faith faith is the Revelation that this is going to happen yes but it must be tested first on the promise whether it will or whether it won't happen then it must be the conviction give witness to it for a while six years so far no matter who says what but stay right with it God said so and it's going to be I look not at Lon vanities what what what s so is doing who fell who didn't fall what because who said so uhuh I look at the word Jonah looked back at the word if you'll look to this Temple if you're in trouble God you'll hear from God and then he saw the whales belly count all Lon vanities amen and we see all this sin is lon vanities God says his hand is on us amen and it's it's all amen I want to read say Matthew 7 7 and 8 Jeremiah 333 Ephesians the 1st chapter the 15th verse wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you make it mention of you in my prayers there's two great prayers here in Ephesians this one the one which we preached about and Faith worketh by love because Ephesians 313 through 21 these two are these great prayers here in Ephesians if you check them out boy you begin to shout and praise God this is for you these prayers right here see cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers now here's what he's praying that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge now catch it there not knowledge head knowledge no sir Revelation in the knowledge birth experience in the knowledge then you know you got it then Satan can say what he want to say Satan I've been birth into heart dare you defy the living Army of God I mean I didn't just because here because God's Prophet say so I didn't read in the Bible is in my heart it's there and when the enemy comes hidden power comes out and bless that devil see to me now amen then you know you got it amen well these are the kind of people that's going to overcome that know they got it amen and you won't have to ask well can I pray can you pray brother praise our God amen the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints Amen in that land of the Saints see and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us W who believe according to the working of his mighty power St Matthew 7 seven and 8 ask and it shall be given you that's positive there I mean he said so Jesus Christ himself said so seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be open unto you for everyone that ask it receive it amen see if you ask you've got to get it amen amen praise God and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be open Jeremiah 33:3 call unto me his positive again I will answer not maybe hope so oh no I'm going to answer amen but just get on your knees and call to me amen amen praise God call unto me I will answer thee and show thee Great and Mighty things which thou knowest not amen am I believe that this morning the Holy Spirit picked these scriptures out we knowing that there's something that we want to know amen there's seven Thunders laying back there but he's got a prescribed way to approach that you must approach it through the word not through hysterics not through uh men running up and down and telling you well I believe it means this no that's that's all right but that's not what we're talking about amen you talking about now see and not with everybody trying to make a great show in the flesh not with all the scribes preaching deiling Shepherds and so because the under Shepherds and so forth no sir that who is giving you the bible promises what God Said So now Jesus Christ in this hour feeling LED this week that uh we would give you an encouragement to pray so I like to title this little thought encourage M to prayer see cuz I believe at this Junction that we should be encouraged the blessings are laying there and I believe we're in that very season where it's going to happen so then if God he could only move through his word so he's got to get his people in a condition you follow me now to have the heart to receive that but if they just walking along yeah well he's supposed to do so and so and so but that he can't move there you see you got to be waiting for that you got to be looking for that you got to be seeking for That Knocking asking for that so therefore uh his disciples seeing him when they walk there there they noticed that he prayed a l and he knows that he had overcome they knows he had power they knows he had peace and they said Lord teach us to pray see to me now they know that that was the secret amen and he taught him this uh a great New Testament prayer here see then he went on tell them other things here over in uh because Matthew 6:7 there s on the mountain all these things but the thing that struck me is when he said ask and you shall receive amen seek and you shall find knock and the door shall be open so therefore Jesus Christ himself encouraged us to pray amen by telling us to ask and to seek and to knock well then he said then that must be his way to find it cuz he said so amen so we go through the Bible but now it's got to be God's way amen see you just don't do it any kind of way you got to know how to approach God and that's why we had a prophet cuz many Pentecostals Hallelujah glory to God they had all kind of zal prayed prayed all night long prayed six hours up on the roof and all the all kind of things but it wasn't directed in the right channel you follow me now you can't pray and have sin expect to get anything follow me now see it's got to be the right way you can't pray and and don't have love in your heart because for your brother amen you can't knock down your brother and go home oh Lord give me the kingdom yeah no you won't get that way see me now no sir it's a condition to be met and and now I'll just you write down the scriptures because don't look for them cuz keep your head looking this way amen amen don't miss nothing say Amen you look down I say something then you missed it missed the thought amen but look this way you want right that's okay St John 15:7 now we want to find a condition amen praise the Lord St John 15:7 now here is his condition for answered prayer if ye abide in me amen and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples so we find that it is God's will for us to Bear much fruit but his words must abide in us first amen I was just thinking when the Holy Spirit the pillow fire P out on the the day of Pentecost and he began to speak in tongues and prophesy and Shout Scream and holler all those devout Jews who knew the scriptures were standing there now if somebody didn't stand up there and put that in the word it would have gone off into fanaticism no matter how much fire so all those Dynamics without the mechanics wouldn't meant nothing but Peter stood up and said these Dynamics is that at the prophet Joel spake of now those Jews begin to thumb through the scripture in their mind well Joel did say in the last days I shall pour out my spirit amen well he put those old Jews in Bible order then then they had to give respect for the word of God was going for amen then right away it was established the apostles Doctrine and they contined steadfast in what in the apostles Doctrine so we have today we have the doctrine back but there's no Authority one says it's a a horse amen one say you have to go over to cus sign somewhere and one say you got to do this here there's got to come some Authority Amen to say this at the prophet Bram spake of it here it is this is what it means that's what it mean on the word of God Amen that's got to come forth then that brings you into the unity of the one Faith one Lord one baptism see that me now see so God does everything in order now so therefore the condition we have to abide in his word present tense and he has sent us a message which we shall abide in now I want to skip through this just mention these things to you now after we abiding in his word another secret of having answered prayer if you want to write it down James the first chapter it's another little secret see now we now we have received his words but you got to believe them just receive you have to believe them see them in not the B and live in you then ask what you will now James 1 the 5th chapter fifth verse rather I'm sorry if any of you lack wisdom let them ask God uh that giveth to all men liberally and idth not and it shall be given him see asking given all the time see but let him ask in faith nothing wavering see for he that wave like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways so we see then that when the promise comes and it has 63 then you tested on that promise the things that God said he's going to do you have to you have to have a test for it see me now and therefore James says now don't come here asking if you're not sure what this third pull is if you ain't sure that Christ has come down through his prophet and give out this message if you ain't sure whether there's been a baptism or there not a baptism or whether you ain't sure of these things don't even come here asking that's right cuz you don't know what you're asking foren you don't know the season you don't know the time you don't know anything you follow me now you see you see why the god of prayers not answered see so therefore don't come here wavering see don't come here doubting and staggering around I ain't sure in this group in that group maybe they got it over here just tramping around back and forth trying to figure out who's got it and picking up all kind of strange ideas and coming back and forth there unbelief don't even know where you're stand at but if you ever find it and get with some who's got it you can't help but stay there amen see praise God he that doubts is like a wave up on the Sea The Wave Rises up one big white caps glory to God Amen down it goes can't hear nothing amen it went down you don't hear that glory to God the great big white cap wave that'll toss a ship and knock it around amen you don't hear it no more see one minute he believes I believe it bless God go outside right and somebody say one little thing I ain't so sure about that now I heard so so wrote well he said this what does that mean see me now he says yes I believe brother brandom bless God brother BR go off the scene well I ain't so sure about that now why did God do that now what's he going to get in prayer are you following me friends amen see he can't make up his mind which way he believes see he staggers then helpless in prayer wavering like this wave up and down and God sit there waiting God says because Hebrews 116 he that cometh to God must believe that he is for without faith is impossible to please God Amen you've got to come to God not like a drunken man tossed to and fro up and down but this promise has been birthed into you this is the will of God for this age to come out of this layout of sea and filth to walk with my God for his hand is the arm of the Lord been revealed and we catch all of that tender handu nail SC hand we walk with it we want to walk with him we want to come out of this filth and mess my wife and I were just talking this morning we see all the hippie all things around here we thank God she was saying if we if we would only because reflect on what God has done not what they're doing out there but what he has done for us amen then we begin to praise God then we begin to shout then we begin to leap for Joy amen praise the Lord see we must believe a brother just wrote me here because from Tucson yesterday and told me that the hippies are invading Tucson coming in by the hundreds they have opened up a church a Pentecostal hippie Church where they wear shorts and all kind of things beards and everything in the church can you imagine if they asking God for something in there like that what they going to get in there that's right they are leaving California for they have prophesied that there's to be an earthquake the first eight days of April so they're getting out of California in droves the hippies they Inon invading it you and you feel spirit because you know what what that means now two signs being turned over praise God and I think about the word um asking seek knock did you ever notice the word ask a seek s knock k a ask amen amen praise the Lord see me now asking seeking knocking a am ask and you shall receive amen amen see God is trying to get you a point where you will ask amen you've got to ask for it don't be bashful and W in here is scared to pray somebody might hear me if it's a sister she's scared she might speak out loud somebody because might look at her and and scared PR pray you believe it no matter what day Daniel wasn't scared and he was with unbelievers Hallelujah when the hour come he threw open that door there and walked out on his Veranda right there amen amen raise up his hands and them demons down there got man say Old King he's bowing down his knees now is that right well then what are you afraid you among your own people here why Wednesday the the light should have fell out in here amen the billing should have shook yes that's right because the Bible says so is that right acts four when they come back rejoicing that right am they prayed Lord God stretch forth your Mighty hand the place shook amen praise the Lord that's coming oh yes yes sir is it is a Bible uh pray is is it's a Bible because promise here see now if it's God's will to ask for what we want see then what we supposed to do now is to find out see just uh what we supposed to do and how are we supposed to do it in the season so we need to know what to pray for see me now and that's why I picked out Ephesians this morning cuz he there he tells we are in Ephesians you see and there Paul tells you exactly what to pray for therefore then is no doubt no staggering you say with me pray that I'll be filled with the spirit of wisdom me pray that the inner man will be filled me pray that uh uh the resurrection power shall rest on me yes amen he said he he pray that's what he prayed amen so therefore what would we pray in this church here a Bible prayer one for the other pray one for the other Lord God name them fill every one of them amen with your power amen go to your knees begin to pray one for another in here therefore don't pray for yourself in that sense cuz they're praying for you amen see he's praying for you and you praying for him and when that begins the spirit of God the word begins to get among the people amen do you see something happen friends amen so we in that season now don't forget that we in that season so God has given us many encouragements to pray seek ye the Lord while he may be found call upon him while he's near amen cast your your burdens upon the Lord he because he will sustain you draw an iron to God He will draw an iron these this what God Said these things said he and especially for this hour now when the devil's trying to separate you from God the word amen see therefore in the same hour we have many discouragements not to pray see and it's to get the bride off the track see or just come to this place and you forget about it just go around in the flesh we waiting for a certain thing that happen see there's no need to pray there what are you praying for when it's cuz they said this is going to happen see follow me now that's another trick then the unspiritual ones fleshy want to talk and eat all the time they don't want to pray so it there's another discouragement tell you like it is friend and then there's hosts of demon powers 200,000,000 demons trying to stop you from praying that's what you feel you want to pray we all want to the phone rings this happens the baby this all kind of things see me I know that and he knows that amen but he is watching the desire the earnest attempt to get there am if it's just one word Lord you know I try are you follow me now friends just an attempt if thou Wilt come on Peter he he got out there didn't he he made an attempt to get there and bless God he was out there too amen he was there he was walking at water if God come on see if you will come if you will be made perfect come on See Me Now so therefore we need to in this time listen to the Bible encouragements to pray Bible encouragement so I'm going to speak just a word this morning just to pray see and then there's those who don't want to seek the Lord they don't uh you heard brother BR go through it many times about the this person want to get it this way and they don't want to do this here they don't want to die out you heard them make all the different remarks about it and so forth they don't believe that but that's the way it games C the way to come sure did see now but they don't believe it nevertheless so we find Jesus Paul and Jeremiah with uh because encouragements to pray I'm just taking my time this morning see just s teaching it to you and so now um uh Ephesians that's right 1 here 15- 20 now we see uh Paul I want to speak about there two points that I want to bring up see and the first thing that we note the 15th verse wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus praise God Paul heard about their faith in Jesus Christ he heard something else too their love for all the Brethren so he commended them for that see me now we ought to exalt one another for which he heard of it so these Ephesians had love for the Brethren they didn't go about tearing them down see me now if they they love their enemies MH are you following me amen and by loving your enemies you keep the presence of the Lord around you otherwise that evil spirit on Saul comes upon you jealousy mad hatred see that moves upon you but David just Ducks it God bless you brother praise the Lord see and then David stands there and talks now they might say well what is David hinting around about all the time insinuating all these things here the Lord did it brother brandham did it you're supposed to do that see cuz it must be revealed and others don't get it at all so you leave them alone they don't know what's going on they getting mad In the Flesh well what is going on anyway tell me word by word see so just like right now they different ones are wanting to brother H myself bring us out they want to know what are we preaching all of a sudden we've been there seven years nobody bothered all of a sudden this year letters come and uh give me a tape this and that and so forth we just going along like we always was praise the Lord amen we're just sailing along feeling fine leaping for Joy when the Trials Come turning them into Victory amen amen amen going along being formed into into His Image maybe you don't think so but I know so oh praise God there it is it matters not what you think don't you look at at my don't worry about God look on my heart amen see long as I try to do right do righteousness God is looking down upon on itall Amen just moving along so because we did this here A brother wrote me and said I heard your tape uh a more excellent a more excellent sacrifice I believe it was and your tape is just like is the word so and brother a certain brother so and so is because he's only the word too so I want to take your tape and his tape and sent them out to the bride along with brother bram's tapes now I really wanted to tear to that other person see in the doctrine I mean see me know to divorce him from me cuz what he preach I don't believe that at all see but I couldn't say anything so I wrote back brother I don't think it's right that I should even be mentioned in the same breath with the prophet my tapes is the message here is for the local Right Here Local see it's not for out there it's for him here cuz they won't understand out there there may be a situation in here brother H myself might be falling it maybe 5 months we following it Peck at it here PE at it there Peck at it here and Peck at it there then all of a sudden two intellectuals walk in on the day we're going to nail it down on that very day we nail that thing down they go out there what's wrong with them they wasn't here the other times you follow me now so when that tape Goes Out Boy what are they screaming H about up there in New York what they so mean about man about up there we following the devil they watching the trail that serpent just moving in here moving over there and we cut that thing to Ribbons at the right time it may take a year sometimes we keep keep pecking at it keep it down amen get in your way amen amen amen praise we know what we're doing he told us to do that we're in the line of duty if you're in the line of duty I believe right this morning if I'm in the line of duty if somebody fell out here dead and it's God's will we could pray and bring him back to life I believe that in the line of duty for Joshua Way was in the line of duty God says I give you the land kill them demons out there well he was killing them and the sun went down lord God send us some more Sunshine out here moon go back over there sun come out and shine here while we kill these demons amen we can only kill them in the sunlight the word so we got to preach the sunlight to kill the demons amen then the demons they begin to fly and if it's a strong Wheat Field the weeds die the heads go down they didn't make a sound no more amen that's a strong weed feel but if it's a weak weed feel those weed run over your church tear you down amen by the grace of almighty God it's been his will to stand here and it's his will that you should believe it's every every word that's been preached I'll stand for it in the day of judgment am everything I've said there are those who sit here with you then take words out of here to others who are waiting to hear it and the others swear you're talking about them all you doing is pining down the spirit in the Bible if they go back and tell a person well brother com said you was a so and soul you didn't even mention the prince's name but you tore that Spirit up in the Bible and they see that person what you're preaching and they run right out and say well brother K spoke about you not even knowing what they're doing I hope you see that amen amen one time we were preaching about balam here and we tore into balum and how he does hallelujah and come around the sistered and sweet like was the next Wednesday he stood right right in the door there and greet all the people abson Absalon right in the door PO is here and stood up there sweet and smile like w are

about you spoke about that spirit amen not them amen right you watch your spirit working in that person you follow me now if it don't come to love forgiveness humility kindness peace and joy and temper that ain't the spirit of God I know that you you all should know that if he call you on the phone and talk against because your because your p and so forth here that ain't God's spirit that's right it's of the devil amen so well you say well all right see then you use wisdom see you're trying to separate to send from that person with love with wisdom see so you you go on you pray for them amen how do we get over here praise the Lord now amen so therefore we find then that Paul said he heard of their faith in Christ their love for all the saints See Me Now friends see that's a wonderful Church isn't it am amen see now we want to examine the character number one in the contents of this tremendous prayer see now four things because I mention quickly that because we note here Paul was an intercessor he prayed for others amen that's the first thing see then Paul gave up Thanksgiving while right here in Ephesians 1:3 blessed be God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha present tense blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places that's how he approach God and Jesus Christ he taught us to pray Our Father the first thing come out of your mouth you're giving glory to God Who Art in Heaven if you say that your father's in heaven Satan got to tremble yes cuz you telling the devil that your father is in heaven amen amen see me now so that's a a prayer of faith and then before you ask for anything thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven then ask for your daily he know what you need but he wants you to ask for it there's your prayer amen then ask for because forgiveness and you go on down the line keep us because lead us not into to temptation but Deliver Us from Evil and all these things see me now you pray in a Bible prayer amen and just Branch off as the spirit of God leads you but when you but Thanksgiving is very important because Hebrews said so a Believer priest with the fruit of his lips he's giving Thanksgiving to God giving praise to God Amen amen so Paul goes into prayer he begin to thank God for their election amen thank God for their because predestination amen thank God for their calling for their regeneration thanking God for they were predestinated onto adoption thanking God that they would have been half been translated from the power of the devil into the kingdom of God what you going to pray you ask me what can you pray you got all kind of things to pray amen amen am see pray they can't do it what see so therefore they're thanking God for all kind of things so what is he doing he's teaching us what we are to pray see and he's teaching what are the real blessings not those material things out there that don't mean nothing the real blessings of God is what I just called to you your calling your election your predestination your adoption which is coming amen that's what the spiritual blessings are he'll give any any other things if you seek Him First amen what you have now is what he ordained for you to have not another thing you better believe that amen your bed or living room whatever it is that's what you're supposed to have amen you follow me now your condition call whatever it is I'm talking about material things now but this other I'm talking about the spiritual thing this morning see what we pray for he gives you he he knows need he knows your need he knows what you have need of so but you got to come and praise and thanksgiving to God praise him see and people they don't want to praise God see here scripture comes to my mind here if you want to take it down 1st Samuel 1st Samuel 12 I I hope I don't be long this morning cuz I haven't got started yet amen am can you stay with me for a while praise the Lord I'm I'm trying to get over thought is just burning in my heart about prayer now you got to be taught we have to be taught not you we see now uh uh uh 1st Samuel 12:16 this was right after Israel wanted a king a vain desire in their heart they didn't want God because through his prophet Samuel they wanted a king okay God gave them the king see now just after that they had had asked for these things because their own Desir they don't want to ask for see why you have to be taught see me now so they asked for the king because they saw the other people have it same in the church today brother gets blessed Lord because let me do that there you don't know what God want for you you follow me now friends so they saw that the Nations had Kings out there they want same thing that's right that's caral see now if they have been seeking the things of God that would have been different see now the odd thing here it was right in the harest season when Samuel come out here see now therefore stand and see this great thing which the Lord will do before your eyes is it not wheat Harvest today I will call unto the Lord he shall send thunder and rain that you may perceive and see understand see that your wickedness is great which you have done in the sight of the Lord and asking you for because a king So Samuel called to the Lord and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day and all the people greatly fear the lord in Samuel and all people said unto Samuel pray for thy servants unto the Lord now they ask them to pray see to the Lord God that we die not for we have added unto all our sins this evil to ask us a king see and Samuel said unto the people fear not ye have done all this wickedness yet turn not aside from following the Lord see because stay right with it there see follow the Lord but serve the Lord with all your heart and turn you not aside for then should you go after vain things see which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain for the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake can you know all about the story about because because because Moses and so forth and Sarah see he can't do it see and also today his bride is in him you see the man now and there's a blood atonement for her sins you see because it has pleased the Lord to make you his people praise our god it pleases God to make us his people Samuel's here now teaching see to me now now here's Samuel just like Paul saying intercessor moreover as for me God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you see but now watch but I will teach you the good and the right way and that's what by God's grace we're trying to do this morning teach you the good and the right way see me now the the Pentecost move come on it was intercessor because the Holy Spirit they were supposed to lay out and pray to God that God would bring on this entire ministry that's what they were to pray for for Wigglesworth Smith over in England over here God told him to pray for Israel's Deliverance a mighty healing campaign and the coming of the Lord he was told to pray for that by God himself 1937 he had a whole bible college and had everybody on their knees praying throughout the every day of of the year the month and so forth and then now that now they didn't get anything out of that in that sense but in 1946 here it come oh my God you follow me now here it come see so therefore what was it it was time for God to bring something on the scene but somebody had to be praying for it and I believe that God has called you today the Lord thy God calls you today to begin to pray to begin to seek to begin to knock for this something fixing to happen that's exactly right friends so therefore for uh uh uh we must be taught and then in teaching and set things in this prop because uh a perspective see now we don't always pray for material things we know that we pray for salvation we pray to go into Rapture yes sir see me now and when we see and when we see the results we see God's results here this morning so we can say blessed be the Lord God father Jesus Christ who have blessed us here with all spiritual blessings has he done it well then thank him for it then praise Him continually for it yes sir praise God the third thing is to be specific what you're talking about mention so and so into prayer say the name be specific what you're saying Lord bless uh those people down there and Lord bless that's nothing me get on in pray see me now and number four be constant fervent in season out of season pray always become a skip over this right here see me now because you understand this here Paul said always praying for you all all the time praying all the time see and I want to get to the second Point here cuz it's getting late now now uh the the first part was the character of his prayer see intercessor and then uh uh because constant because of a specific and so forth see and now uh this part of it here is the part that we want to get to see here he prayed that they would have in Ephesians um 1 I think is 17 here he prayed here that um that's right yeah see that the Lord God that that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom that's right and Revelation in the knowledge of him see so he's praying that that these Ephesians would be filled with the spirit of wisdom that that they would have the Revelation in the knowledge not just head knowledge all the tapes in the books no see Revelation in the knowledge are you following now friends see me now that's a big difference you know see and and knowing that in the heart and then because are knowing by the head so therefore you have to be birthed into it because second Peter 1 says so because as you add to your faith these Seven Virtues then you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in what in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ But first you were birth into hear into hear and here and here and here and then love come down and kep the whole thing and then you were fruitful not Barren you produce the child amen amen produce that Jesus Christ see and then you then you know you when he's produced that day you know even as you known you know all things the veils lifted up see and God has allowed us to come in there and lift it up now to show us all of these things here there's something else to happen to you don't see and we know that it's going to give us Rapture in faith amen see now so he so therefore he's praying here for knowledge and power see but personal experimental knowledge see if I read about it like brother Bram said because him and his friend Jim po Jim po loves to read about hunting and fishing brother I want to read but I want to do it amen that's a difference I want to fish I want a hunt amen but Jim PO he read about it he sat there chuckled and and read and he knew all about hunting by knowledge amen he knew all about fishing by knowledge but brother Brandon brother he went out in the woods and he knew all about hunting and fishing by experience so much so he even saw a fish raised back to life amen so much so even so a squirrel amen he knew by experience amen that's what we want well Paul said to pray for that one for the other that's what he said this morning here you pray for that amen see now every Christian must have a personal revelation of in the knowledge of Jesus Christ there are people uh I have to say this now to a personal standers here they they're they don't quite get it see they in another age we've been trying for the past seven years to get the people here not to lean on the minister you follow me now and there's some that don't understand it they keep saying the minister it's not the minister you have got to have a personal experience with God I hope you can see that but some people say well get them anything happen get the minister call them no don't call call God he is the one that will minister to you not me or him Jesus Christ you pray to him and now suppose you laying over in the bed somewhere and you call on the Lord and God come in there with the power of God brother you hop about it glory to God you can't wait to tell your experience that you had but if you sit there and here come to minister well praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah see me now thank you praise the Lord H see me now what is that that ain't nothing that's foolishness in one sense you understand I'm talking about now because you did cuz that's only a secondhand Revelation that's why because you're living off of his prayer you follow me now but God trying to get the people as individual to know him in what in the power of his resurrection amen amen how do he do it ask and it shall be given seek and you shall find knock and the door shall be open we got to grow up and mature to that then when you can get a church one over here two over here can't wait to get home from work eat their dinner brother hit hit those knees something's going to happen you tell me that yes sir exactly right on the lunch hour slip aside Lord God blessed be the because God of Jesus Christ and so forth has G us all spiritual blessings here Lord I know that you are keeping me here on this job from the all these old demons around here and so forth Lord God don't you give me the grace of God to walk here with my head up no matter the filthy conversation all these things here I can look at them with Lord amen praise God you know you know where you're standing at going on to Subway all the filthy Spirits you know what I'm talking me about sitting all across in front of you and so forth all kind of demons and things pray close your eyes and Nod you ain't nodding amen you're just with him amen amen see when you come out of refresh they come out of like see come out and refresh praise the Lord amen see but you got to do it yes you got to got to be an experience it's got to be or a mother knows she had a baby that's right just ask them if you don't believe that they'll tell you cuz one right now is having all kind of trouble and we feel sorry for her but she she's got to go through that if it wasn't God's will that she wouldn't have to go through that said but it's just the will of God so we can only pray Lord ease her burden ease ease it comfort her by prayer see amen now and when she feel that strength coming in by prayer she said well God brought me through again Hallelujah she knows that God brought her through again amen see that's the way it's got to be see we can have the best teachers we can have the best group best Spirit best life whatever you have best Revelation best building whatever it is amen but we have got to know that the holy spirit is working through each and every one am cuz you sit right here and you just run that's all see they just right right in your midst cuz Israel rotted in the wilderness that right 40 years they was rotten they had all they had the best Spirit signs wonders and miracles Man From Heaven their shoes didn't wear out but they rot it but a two didn't rot they just got aged cheer it out Joshua and K 11 amen because they ask God God is able to take the land he give us the promise let God Almighty come down here and steal these people here tell them to shut up CU you give this promise here Lord amen amen we are preaching this way because we are facing the greatest promise ever the the the the creation himself is coming down is coming on these unworthy temples of clay amen we've got to enter into an atmosphere where we absolutely believe that oh he can because he can't come there you that's what I'm trying to bring you this morning amen that's what the holy spirit is trying to do this morning see cuz this is the time there's a season in a time a time to plant time to pluck up a time to seek the Lord amen a time to pray a time for God to come forth amen I believe we in the hour blessed be the name of the Lord you must seek it see but unless the holy spirit is not working through through you you will never arrive to the knowledge of God you'll never you won't know what happened these past 6 years amen but you had that do you know what God brought you I know what he brought us through these six years brother he brought us from way out in left field somewhere that's right every step of the way we could not have made it without him right that's ex absolutely absolutely there is no way possible that we could have made it here in New York without the grace of almighty God Amen and I I praise him for every day I said my God I think of this here Jesus Christ he went on the cross and as he stood there be before pontis pilot and he brought all these accusations against him he stood still and pontis pilot marveled I mean he was amazed then he knew he was something he was somebody he knew that see now I said Lord I said well why was that cuz he was absolutely absolutely sure positive that he was the word amen he was positive that that was the will of God Amen but then he said not a muming word cuz that had that was written that was the words written that they had to Smite him and do all those things that he had to be because to live it up then if I could come to that place oh if we could come to that place see me now and and and know when the things come just stand there kind to be Lord praise be to God then the spirit of the Lord Peter says doth rest up on you amen oh the holy spirit is resting right there and you saying forgive them Father for they know not what to do standing there yes brother you did so and so and so yeah well pray for me brother forgive me see Spirit of Christ is right there great praise him blessed be the name of the Lord that's the way friends God says so so these eight virtues brings us into the knowledge of God by Revelation Faith experience whatever you want to call it but it's got to be an experience you got to be birthed into it amen see otherwise it's nothing you just uh hear somebody shout about it and talk about it I want it I want it I want what God's profet had I want that that's right he was to come to prick us to jealousy right amen you understand to desire Joseph craved the body of the Lord oh yes to take care of the Lord's body he craved it the Bible say so he he went and asked for that body he craved for it because had a know him about asking a craving and begging and so forth but we don't have time to because because break it down but you can see the word ask means the Crave and the Begg and also because the desire but the right because the right desires of course you see so therefore brother Brown come to show us Jesus the father we saw it see me we were to be pricked into jealousy spiritual jealousy that we want that that we saw amen amen and that's what I want I saw it I mean they can blame me I saw it I don't care what happened I saw that I want that for that was the fullness and God from the foundation of the world predestinated us unto that onto the adoption he adopted his Prophet his Prophet did the work of an evangelist that right 1963 he took him out on the mountain and visit him with seven angels lifted him up in the spirit of God adoped him into the body in his proper place as Elijah amen you got it well then you have been predestinated this is the hour when God is going to adopt that bride she's going to come to that place when she hits that spot after coming through the test and the trials Believing by faith overcoming to the Overcomer and each of those seven blessings over there as they come down the line the the new name in The Hidden manner the last one gets all seven exactly right each one that come that line the last the last group you you get all seven of them see a new name Tree of Life the thing amen amen to the Overcomer overcome what by the word you cannot overcome except by the word amen when 63 4 5 6 7 8 9 now we into the seventh year Lord is this the year we've been laboring for six years amen see is this seventh year to we just cease M drop our arms down and that Dynamics r amen the Capstone these signs shall follow them the confirmation of the Resurrection I claim this body here this one over here that one over there they've been faithful they labored they stayed with it they prayed they sought God they kept a knocking because I told him to do so I'll visit them with an Angel have to be in here be at your sink washing your punts and pants changing your baby in the room in there come can do anything amen praise God With God nothing is impossible there's no set form no kind of way brother Kirk he can be down there at his engineering desk there power of God strike him he got to excuse himself in there get out of there amen or he might mess up up a building in there or something there praise the Lord praise God his hand Won't Be steady no more amen yes sir the maid can't make the beds no more that's what God's Prophet said you'll know you in something in brother it be all over you the resurrection power of Jesus Christ it's coming up the road but you got to get to seeking God get to asking knocking in the door shall be open unto you blessed be the name of the Lord he have now present tense blessed us with all spiritual blessing it's not been us here it's been himself leading you controlling you bringing you up to this place here where he's got a group of people that believes the word of God Amen and they ain't look at no man and they believe that word he said now you see whenever there God overlaps and whenever there something because to happen in secret he's preparing somebody to come forth all the time when the hour came in 46 he had prepared a little humble Prophet down in the air is that right he had prepared him already 13 years prepared so when the hour come after Wigglesworth them have been praying for that hour somebody and one individual was prepared for that but this time is to be a bride so he must be preparing somebody somewhere some people men and women somewhere amen amen for their hour it's got to be by the very word at this Prophet brought preparing them don't you understand that the life come up from the stem it meets the sun and the soil it comes together that that wheat don't take on that life until the very end then when the sun strikes it the shook pulls back it begins to take on the very nature of God the very virtue patience and Temperance and so forth that's when it takes it on in the top of the tree that's what's going on now life is coming into you listen excuse me it's um the body is made up of chemicals that right Christ body is made up because of of of of chemicals also water blood and spirit is chemicals in his body but when he walked forth that was a life you follow me now that was what was on the inside of the heart he showed that was the word see but three components went to make up that bodies see these major three I'm speaking about see me now so but when he walked that was the life and that's what they can't understand see the spirit was in moving but you had to see the spirit made manifest a life and we have now entered the life age where the wheat takes on the form of the original wheat and it must be perfected first then when the wheat is dried out powdery ready for the grain not wet and and because of Milky you're almost dry just about dry now you can do nothing without him you are the vine even though you're dried wheat with the spirit of Christ in your heart you are still the branch he is the vine he is the Dynamics amen oh let me lay it in there see so here Lord I'm dry I'm matured I'm ready still can't do nothing amen for he is the works he must come inside and do the works amen he must claim you for the resurrection yeah so when that happens Peter and them they went out they didn't care about nothing they were claimed their bodies was claimed with the power the resurrection power of God just right here let me put this in here I'm taking too much time to you but I just love this amen uh Jesus uh what shall we do with Jesus called the Christ 63 here's something a promise for you that fits in with I'm talking about this morning he's speaking about uh Satan here the denomination and so forth see and the marking of the Beast and so forth how can two walk together except they be agreed there you are that's the hour that we have arrived at and that's and that's the big machine that's set up now they got the mechanics the only thing they have to have is Satan in there with the Dynamics to force the marking of the beast when she's forced down then the Dynamics is working see the mechanics is there is here now they already got them let me say something too this uniting time you see churches uniting like Nations uniting it's a uniting time of God and his bride too and I say this with reverence and respect I believe that the bride of Christ is called I believe she's sealed in the kingdom of God I believe the mechanics is there they're waiting for the Dynamics that'll take her off the earth into glory in the Rapture I believe it with all my heart yes sir now watch we don't know how he's going to do it but he will do it he is the Dynamics he's the he is the vine yeah we the branch I don't care how much Spirits move in you you are a branch that's it and he is the Vine see amen see so he is the Dynamics now watch we just become members of the machine see of his body forming ourself Into His Image by the word see now watch and see him uniting himself with us in his works that's how he comes in with his works then you know it see that's it with watch here a beautiful thing with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper that's when he gives him just before the wedding supper he shows his hand once more I'll ride a trail one more time speak and move forward amen amen praise the Lord just before the wedding supper and we wa now watch we are waiting watching for that therefore I'm in Bible order to preach what I'm preaching this morning cuz we are waiting and we are watching for those Dynamics amen see their big church is too being united the Dynamics of this church watch will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost praise be to God there it is see me now it the Dynamics are you hearing me will be a refilling they can say what they want around the country but he said amen it will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost a refilling amen and they got many fings in that early church yes sir are refilling amen see that we have worked in a small measure now while a headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost will raise just exactly like even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years will raise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight into the skies the Dynamics is the holy spirit is it clear now do you know what you are to pray for the fullness of God the spirit of wisdom amen praise be to God friends we should get to seeking the Lord amen not that we don't have to be in this place see they were natural they didn't have the spirit of Christ in them yet see now so therefore the word himself at the right time just at the end it came a time to seek the Lord are you following me am before they were fishing and doing different things they believe the word but it come the last 10 days come right down I hope you're getting this now this morning see it come right down to the very last 10 days of three and A2 years or so almost a praise God Amen he said now the word spoke it Bible Bible promise hallelujah amen he said go into the upper room and carry you there and wait until you be indued with the Dynamics amen see so when they did it acts 1:14 says here blessed be the name of the Lord this is is the word amen said these all continue with one Accord in prayer what put them on one Accord a Bible promise by spoken by the word himself the word stood there and gave them bible promises go up there and wait till youve been do power they were all with one Accord on that amen so they went to one place but we are in one place Christ Our astronaut we don't have to be gathered in here you up in the Bronx or Jersey wherever you are you are in Christ the one place there is no other place where you can worship Him is other than Christ and this age the Gentile age that they had to have the spirit the Jews were already saved hope you got that they were his children already they were Sanctified already by being Jews we were gentille that had to be cleaned up by his Spirit the same God that was in flesh had to come in the form of the holy spirit in us to do a work sanctifies and so forth now he is in us so we stand here he's right here like he was there in in his own body there he he's here now another form in inside of us amen so all he does now Bible promise time to ask and it shall be given seek amen and you shall find knock and it shall be open who said it the same Jesus Christ that stood there and told him to go into the upper room same one it's telling you this morning to seek to knock and to ask see now they didn't how many days they didn't know I don't know that they were all up there and stay there all the time because they had children and so forth babies and so forth the women that right they still had to go on normal I imagine I don't know that they met there every day and the old Jews had certain times to pray the the thir hour the the 6th hour the nth hour those were because Bible prayer times because for them cuz it was at the third hour of the day when it come amen praise the Lord see so therefore they were all in one Accord see a Bible promise what to do in one place in the upper room we are in one place Christ and we are on one Accord the message of Malachi 4 puts us on We Are Baptist Methodist Presbyterian but now a shout come come out and get on one Accord with the word of God now we're on one Accord but at the very end comes a time when you go to seeking the Lord for something is fixing to happen oh praise God you follow me now friend it's the season it's the time now when these things are to be praise our God Amen well I have a lot of notes here I'll just skip them about the eyes of of uh uh Paul says here about the eyes of our understanding here I believe so here well let me just hit this here cuz it's almost 12:25 and I haven't even started here praise a lot big I don't want to hold you too long though but I want to be led to put this in here Ephesians one the eyes of our understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints see now what the eye is to the Natural Body see the eye now this understanding is the heart see now this eye is the spirit of the Lord for what uh uh a man know the things of the Lord except the spirit that's in him see because who knowe the things except the spirit in him because 1 Corinthians 2:11 see so the spirit in you knows so therefore the eye the spirit of the inner man see he's the one who knows the hope of the calling amen see me now it's by the spirit and if it's by the spirit then it's a revelation amen you've been birthed into it see me now and so therefore These Eyes of your understanding in the last days These Eyes this little Spirit In You Christ was stagging around he and lay out of sea amen one day a Prophet come said anoint your eyes with isai that you may see where you're going amen amen praise be to God and and that little Spirit was there that seat of God was hanging in there it was way back in the shook but it come right into the sunlight and brother it raised up with new life and it knew where it was going then why it knew the hope of his calling amen hope of his calling it knew what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints was for the prophet taught us amen amen and with that Revelation praise be to God we got wisdom amen we have understanding amen and we have Revelation and we know where we walking amen and then when the Holy Spirit comes around and tells you it's time to seek the Lord time to seek the Lord amen you know each now this must be revealed to you this morning see I would never try to get everybody in here get all worked up no sir God's got has got to reveal to each and every person here this morning amen see so therefore one thing here in closing I was thinking about uh because of how we need Paul is saying here we got to know the exceeding greatness of his power to usw who believe according to the working of his mighty power Christ knew that Mighty power when he died and so forth you understand that res resurrection power well we must know that power to overcome and so I was thinking about because the Apollo 8 and how what was the meaning behind that now the word here's the power see this is the power see the powder the gunpowder has power in it but the gunpowder with the power in it needs fire so here's the word with all the power this word can crush this world can paralyze it it can heal the sick raise that do anything a the word can see but it's laying here so it needs some fire amen amen I need somebody Faith the his words abiding in somebody not wavering amen amen who who believeth the mountain shall be moved and stands there amen that takes it amen who knows it see me now that's fire that's Faith well that was in this that was in you in seed form when you staggered out of these different churches you follow me that that that's the faith MH when that Faith which is Spirit Holy Spirit seed dagged out of these different churches the word which is power came into the church in 1946 you follow me now the Pentecost they have the word they were Hallelujah gifts and so forth see but the word come in in 46 with a gift of healing begin to preach the word amen second pull the word there was the power but they didn't get it they thought they had to go and pray somewhere and see no he was bringing the word and power the power right in

brought the power the word back to the church he brought the thing that can raise her up the power of God the word of God but it needs Faith that's why his disciples he stood there the word came to the Jewish church that was weak like we were that right the word himself and said I give you power to to cast out Devils heal the sick and raise the dead that right he the word gave him his authority so Peter they they went out and did these things cuz they had faith in it but they come down the line and they reached this child here with the a demon in it and they couldn't cast out out their Spirit he said ye of little faith he he was all of the faith see me now so then on the day of Pentecost he poured that faith into them they already had the word he said but when that Faith Comes it'll bring the word the power to your remembrance they just walked out such as I have rise up in the name of Jesus Christ amen well what happened it's been there all the time the same Peter That Couldn't

delivered to the saints of God Amen see so now because of because of paollo now see do you understand the word is the power amen we have faith now that's growing like a mustard sea growing out amen and it's been apprehending possessing by Revelation he step of way birthed into it all along the way and they still don't of course you don't see the baby until it comes out what's wrong with them they can't understand that there it's very simple am nine months they got to wait they won't wait brother Bram said they wouldn't wait Antichrist would come forward and get them off in the 9mon period spiritually amen but there is some Eagles amen that shall wait upon the Lord glory to God they're waiting they shall M up with wings as Eagles Hallelujah and while they're waiting they're molting God is pulling the old feathers out amen and the new ones are growing inside out amen and the strength is ready to come into them Wings the Dynamics ready to strike it amen and when in God's season and God tells that eagle just about when he's ready amen he knows when to raise up his wings he know he'll feel the power of God then won't be no he ain't going to Little Flap out there no you going to

you must wait for the 9 months you don't want a seven Monon Pentecostal baby amen want a 9mon baby see praise the Lord you get it now amen the word is the power see me now the power but we must have faith to use the power and he give us the word look what he did brought the word the Seven Seals dropped it on the tapes and went away Lord whosoever will let him come and pick it up no denomination no idea go ahead no pick up the power of God and walk with me individuals I love that amen yeah no certain kind of people any kind of people yeah oh you don't have to be so and so be in message because for 15 years no whosoever will let him come to pick up the power of the word of God in 63 and walk with it nobody's IDE there you had to be with the private h no no sir you got to be with Jesus Christ am you got to have a seat in you spirit of God that that that that shouts and Praises God when he hears the word and moves out with it then he sits back and waits and sees who will take that word and step out and face uh because uh because criticism everything else and to preach what he said and live what said and he waits and that's their test though but they've been birthed into that and they know what happened and there's not the 200,000,000 demons can't take it away from them amen praise God cuz is placed in there before the foundation of the world Amen so therefore Faith to use the power in closing like I said now Apollo 8 proved that the power was stor to the church I like to change it a little different type with that see now Christ because he's Apollo he came and went around the Moon because of poo8 right and went in orbit into the moon's orbit see went all around the moon now the great thing a crucial Point came would that rocket with the power in it see would it fire when the asut by faith would hit the button amen see the rocket had the power but they had certain buttons and things there they got to strike that button see by faith in that rocket that it would boost them up see and get them out of that moon orbit if they that rocket don't work that power amen they would stay and be trapped in the moon's orbit amen now now just think on it see amen now the almighty God look down into the moon the church amen covered with because lay are to se blind the moon wretched miserable now you know you know where I'm going now miserable poor naked and did know it the moon amen so when it got to that condition the pope moved in in ' 64 and blacked it out amen blacked it completely out nothing so then Christ began he he came down in secret and did a work around the moon and is that right but it come down to thec 68 by In the Flesh like so to speak in the natural I mean he had to show by sign what he's done he had to show that that message had the power amen had somebody in that church had faith in that word Apollo Christ the message which he dropped down here amen so therefore when those answer us my faith hit the button it went up amen that's it cuz if it didn't go up we he'll be trapped in the church forever but this message went into orbit and boost us up and around we went amen are you following me why because God created some Eagles down there that was in that Moon the church amen so he come himself apolla and circle it amen to get them Eagles amen amen now that Moon we wasn't born to live in that Moon there see he created to live with him another orbit but we was in the moon's orbit amen see and that orbit is controlled by demon powers and Satan so you're in his orbit the spiritual Wicked Powers see in the moon Pope he blacked it out and try struggle see me now but he gave a sign in December 68th amen that that message that power is ready now and it this message itself this word this power is ready he did it in the natural can at the right time by faith amen Dynamics will hit the button one day very soon and throw you out of the moon's orbit amen throw you out into wild blue yonder out there into the vacuum of space that right and one thing when those as when they were going around the Moon they say it was desolate that right nothing lifeless dead that's the church amen they was just see and they looked out and they gave glory for they saw a light the Earth in space amen here we were on desolate Moon feeling don't even know how you feel I don't know what's wrong a light come in the evening

prophesied the charans had overrun Israel America demon spirits and so forth see and they were besieging Jerusalem and he was inside because they in a prison and then the word of God spoke to him and of all things he knew that they had to go into captivity at that time God told him to go out there and get his cousin and buy the field amen amen told him to buy a field that right it had two parts unseal and seal to it put it in Earth and vessel all in tight amen what would I be doing this for now when they going to take the whole thing here do it by faith amen so he went through the whole
