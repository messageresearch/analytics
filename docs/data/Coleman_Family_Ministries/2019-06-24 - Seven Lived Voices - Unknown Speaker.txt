Galatians 5:22 st. John 14:12 go holy spear and do it and walk it in the word listen to that still small horns oh my jewels of God ten man I'll show you a city on the hill that the world on to Beaumont bore my what's

market in here praise God omigod show us how to bring down his love tonight let the mainspring that tennis button people will begin to destroy every motion by every desire into the Bible and will be Ripley chipper walking in the world of them oh is that your desire and I think well please done well let's turn to the Word of God now we talked a little bit and I want to strike the word Amen we feel settled down tonight as always that suggests the continuation of these Georgia meetings right here tonight raise the world we stop off holding him in my Freeport we many and now we're here tonight now tonight have a Sussex I imagine it which that's very controversial to many people what is not to me and I don't believe it to you because something as your pastor has preached here for all these years here which isn't heaven from the voices and so therefore home raptured Saints lays in the seven thunders and this message itself is the seventh from the mystic and the Prophet was to reveal all mysteries for wraps and faith and he revealed it he put on the tape and in the right season already have evil pastor or they are to fly like Eagles and go up into the funders and not be afraid he's able to put people from falling and bring it right over back up an egg anything and get those traumas and bring them down to the shoes now that's viable amen but therefore like I'm saying this is something that we've been doing in New York and I've been doing here for all these years but tonight I just want to speak on it clinging tonight the things that we preach in the off the year because we are we were supposed to take those parameters of God and screeching teeth and so our hope is not strain'd to anybody but that's why tonight in approaching this subject and I realized that he's in a statement finish the third role and seven thunders and Malachi Floyd's poking at it for cooking these potion or this was the devil should get a hold of it he could do great damage people impersonators please but he can't know him well it is the woman count me and he cannot impersonate the word you can because imperfectly dismount but not the word and that's why I'm so happy that God did it this way but then I know who I am Amen think for now I want to read from second Peter warrant to first chapter verse 1 through 12 and brother Jack and brother Barney has given me a complete Liberty and he tells me they what's on your heart the only thing that I can say is a seventh from the Methodist nota let me tell you if I have to creep up on my hunt 2nd Peter the first chapter verse 1 through 12 and revelation the tenth chapter verse 1 through 11 well tonight we just want to you says you have the time yes buzz that I once hit my time and want to lay in from the book of Revelation here and see what little Holy Spirit has for us tonight second Peter the first campus Simon Peters his servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have a obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and I'll save his either strength Grace has peace be multiplied unto you to the knowledge of God and of the our Lord according and His divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath call us to glory and riches what a poem of calling the glory and to purchase stress all the time whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by deed he might be partakers of the divine nature through these promises we ought to partake of his divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world who loves and besides if given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity also and for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lack of these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from the gold pen wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election shore or if you do these things needs they'll never fall for foreign insurance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus strength wherefore I will not cease never gift to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established ends of present truth and also chapter not another mighty angel

his right foot on up under please and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Lord and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders

sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swore upon him that liveth for ever and ever he's created heaven in the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as

they steal it away they met everybody at all since he was about this imagine now I will come and go right back to it and fight off what did you put in there maybe he comes down tonight to reveal it himself and all I have to do is to hand it out to you hey man it's not my message his message it's what he said amen praise along so now we'll just some main place to delete from but I'm putting on the paint here about the seven of funding this year and the message here and the Seventh Seal Beach 33 about five minutes before of reasons from the Seventh Seal book here let's all settle down the night pull up the teens are your pants that has tested it on rating you could go here and go brother Barney's church was the guinea thing and you go ah all right here we are please gotten it here tonight but this is all right ladies on page 33 and now it is certain as I'm standing in the press room tonight I had the revelation that reveal is in a playful manner that I will speak to you by God he'll follow full of it and then let's go over here first hands the revelations to begin I want to begin what I want to tell you what it is what happens is that those seven thunders that a very summit and what for been the right that's what the mystery is laying behind those seven consecutive Sun is rolling out now why let's prove it why it is the secret that no one knows about John was forbidden to write about it even write a similar but it why this is why there was no activity in heaven it might give way to secret do you see it now in his home great they must be included because it's got to happen but when the seven thunders noticed when the seven angels come forth the soundness Champa there was one Sunday in Israel began it it was across it from time shall be no more the last jump at once under the Harris reven seven seven straight thunders right in the hole one two three four five six seven jinx now why if Satan should get a hold of it you might do great damage there's one thing you don't know Meghan turn anything walk through and imperfect any kind of a give uh I hope you're learning but he can't know this it's not even written in the word is a total secret angel everything's cut up just be made one move might give away something you're putting away rather so they just shut up Chris Hoffman everything stopped now here's something that we have got to understand we try to understand about the thunders k35 notice it was only one great burst of thunders and seven angels appear that right one burst of thunder seven angels appeared and I saw the land winning here opened the first few I heard that every wise a voice of thunder and one of the four beasts it coming see notice one Thunder seven messages that's been sealed up and cannot be reveal until the last day at this age see what I mean well there was one thunders of thunder went off in December 1962 it in from out of town for home and it was seven angels and then he went to Arizona a month or two later and then he was picked up into the concrete from seven or angels but one blast went off there was the one blast off in the rooms there was a one blast off in Arizona there was the one blast in the Bible one son of seven angels seven messages a man just put it in the Bible is his right amen and then the D seventh angel himself the one with the swept-back wings very notable he comes down on the earth and sun is out seven thunders this well there was one thunder seven angels seven messages in these seven message of the seventh angel he himself is on the earth and he thunders out seven thunders all my Western Aero days 37 36 I'll stop there the bottom of the page and did you know that one angel I sit in there for the strange angel look more like to me than any of the rest of them do you remember that we read a constellation three on one side a long top and the one right next to me here counting from left to right would have been the 17 so he was brighter meant more to me than the rest of them you remember I said he had his chest out like that and with flying East would remember that I said it picked me up lifting me up remember that well there it is the one with the Seventh Seal the thing that I wanted all my life amen them other seals meant a lot to me of course but you don't know what just has meant well one time in life I prayed I cried out to God after that Phoenix meeting any of the people they ripped me no I laid in the mound one morning got up and went up and interred in the canyon great rugged high mountain and I went up there and there with a little foot trail after that and you go along speaking about how you delve into this mountain up there and cannot wanna a distance there's seven thunders here where he mentions these seven thunders on page 40 days 40 paragraph 2 is in Sabine you came he said this is the third hole and there's three great things that goes with it and one on for today or yesterday the other one for today and there's one thing that I can't in Curtin says it's in an unknown language as I stand right hit there and you look right edit and then this is the third hole coming up and the Holy Spirit of God oh my there's a reason without it now I better stop right here see I just feel sick not to think no more about it thief we'll just remember that Seventh Seal the reason it was not open the reason he did not reveal it no one should know about it and I want you to know before I even know any word about that that that vision come years ago do you remember that and here it is just as the other hand slide straight slides right straight into the word exactly where it was and God knows my heart I never one time whatever thing is that and here it was just later than we think oh my just children from God with these it fits exactly in the promises of God from the end of the message you notice from the end of from the end of time message this seal after all he's reveal all the sick seals what it don't say nothing about the seven and the in time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret and remember al eight to ten one seven all the mysteries of God would be known we at the end time the opening of the Senate field Mainichi here on page 43 here now notice will help me by god I'll tell the truth that these are 30 designed the knees you learn by the Holy Spirit and by every one of them has identified a place in the Bible now what did great secret is that releases this seal I do not know I don't know it I couldn't make it out I couldn't tell it just what it said but I know he was that it was them seven sudden autumn himself right close together banging seven different times and it unfolded into something else that I had changed wouldn't use me now mind you he's already on Vail I'll reveal six seals so now here is the seventh seal in waiting around here that if you did not reveal the seven thunders but he had revealed sixteen years but we understand what we're talking about then when I've seen that I look for the interpretation that flew across there and I couldn't make it out that's exactly right see the hour isn't quite quite yet for it but it's moving into that cycle T is coming up close for the thing for you to do is is remember I stick you in the name of the Lord beat up here well you don't know that something can happen amen page just about five minutes more and we move on but I have to lay in this background here and one on the tape especially page 24 when will it be brother branham how can I tell you I don't know open one of these things if we never meet again on this earth we're gonna meet me Anya at the judgment seat of Christ and you find out that in that room the revelation coming from God just like all the rest of them has that them one of the misses of that field the reason it wasn't revealed it was seven thunders and all the damn points and there it is perfectly because nothing knows anything about it it wasn't even written so we have been in time in 45 he's display high he was walking back and forth and then I thought well what is it Lord I walked up and down the floor awhile I kneeled down and prayed go back and pick up the Bible sit down and read walk back and forth and all of a sudden when I got quiet there it just unfolded like that then grab a pin right quick and go writing it down like that whatever I was seeing or doing watching it like that till I got it wrote down and then I take the rest of the day then go down and trace this out and see it as it tied all the way down to the scripture then it proves all things now there's many people have visions it may have been in Revelations but it is contrary to the worse you leave it alone Amen it's got to be in the Word of God now I just want to a drop the same thing here in the page 50 now did you notice no one know that the people these days still live in the hangover like it was some serious form of things because they just seeped into the ecclesiastic way of looking at it and they see it in a way that they attend there's have caught it that was God's Way at one time but we lived past that the we in the eagle time now so you had the spirit of man coming from Luther and Wesley and a Pentecostal and coming on with the ie that same spirit of man Mindy had Malakoff for bringing the diesel annoying him down and then going off the scene and then the bride coming in with the spare the eagle in between it's bitter man and for nine years now both Spears have come along together great illegal weirdo man leaving clean mrs. Amen but the eagle gets the revelation and during the man's tried to sing it out inside the robe at it but he can't dig it out because God reveals itself in forever he will amen to the Pope to the potentate to the bishop to the dignitaries know the whom to heaven he will for the most illiterate person the home forever he will amen oh thank god tonight and he did it that way to whomsoever he will no paint I noticed it look great public air but I no way I'm standing that's him Amen see so therefore I'm only saying what's written down here now because we have to understand what we're talking about things otherwise we never want had any reputation we got no what we're looking for also day 51 now the another note of the Seventh Seal and 3/4 mystery and I will he can have spoke that is the mystery of the seven thunders the seven thunders inhibitor will unfold this mystery how many he understand tonight that's deep seventh sea with its price unfolded or ordered out seven thunder voices through Malachi fourth mount I don't want to keep reading he understand that live I wanted to play it for you know what I'm talking about and the Seventh Seal he to me was the mystery of the seven thunders is also the mystery of it's coming and therefore the two were tied together deeply different I hope is not well amen there we go hey 52 now here now we fired the six seal has been opened for us we see it and we know it this seventh seal cannot be brought to the public until the hour I now there was some reason God left this human seven voices be funded because it must come think we find that Christ the Lamb took the book in his hand and he opened that seventh seal but you see if a hidden history no one knows it right along with what he said no one would know it's coming they also would not know about this seventh under mysteries for you see is connect it together and there's many people that are fun to open a seal for he didn't say them he said that the sixtieth open and the Son of Man which is the 70th come down on the Earth and Sun is out seven thunders and he he he comes down all those loose in the six seals open them up and it was vindicated gathers all blue pens of the six filled up into himself dating he's a seventh seal the infirmary's Frank in orders out seven thunder voices in Malachi for that is his ministry to reveal those thunders and they've got to be on the tape Oh a man Leah threat kept administrating and he said now and would not know about this seventh on the mystery so you see is connected together that must be have an understanding of the day because the rest of it it all unfolded but this is not important but Tiffany myeloma hers is not hers rather what P on hold to this seven thunders that's as far as you can go right there and now I struck for each eight at East and every one of you were third God into it which is right and loving all your life and serve him and God will take care of the rest now he has said here that it could not be broken to the public but all the false for knowing toothpaste he said don't you get it I'm not the son of man it is the seventh angel revealing a son of man to the public now he could not be revealed but there it was being revealed just a tiny announcing for what it hasn't happened here yet had happened sometime between 64 and 65 that somebody it's up for being a deal then as he summed it out seven thunders then the seven thunders itself pumps is a bright as the Word of God but not reveal as each Thunder is because if Satan could get ahold of it he could do great damage but he cannot impersonate this but it's not going to be poking there's only ones to be spoken into a who will receive it as the word and then she has that revival in her and she's walking in breeze got into the still small boy walking in spirit porkin words all around and another atmosphere she's an easel she knows who she is she is the prize she knows her calling amen yes sir ish you don't have to hang around somewhere ask this brother that that's what this is do you know engine which an inner shell teacher the teacher breathe gosh you'll need any man any anything while the anointing of Holy Ghost

interpretation of the thunders tonight we've got to have it because we see would happen in a Californian raised a single flat in Isreal and the airs all of these things is ready and Malachi for said when they see the things for a ticket to happen things fluff saith the Lord they say mmm you're right there go somewhere and people are worried about recession amen and also depression and all these

see friends visions don't fail they always perfect they are just exactly true now the vision plus the word plus the history plus the trusteeship all blend together you got to have a vision you got to have the order you got to have history and you gotta have a tracing now how could we know the seven thunders when we didn't have history if we didn't have our Friday's Eagle aegis we just started Amen praise the Lord see they must all blend together now after nine years we have a eglise a bride a the little short age in there we have history then right and Satan has never changed the spirit of man four years old and the Seventh Seal trying to sing it out all the great minds locking in missing him for one day Pro it throws it Roman stuck then a little praise God of kentuckians amen come along for free education they have to prove anything he was God's a doctor not a path for scientists amen and he went from Gentiles through the book of Revelation for the material was laid out in the Bible by revelation God open it up to him what a world fair we had in 1963 Indiana they're all what God had done what to believe with that bull he's heard all through the Bible he showed it to us he told it to us and we're Josh spiritual scientists are nice the material is laying on it tasting in the Bible are we gonna sit around here or we want to probe and get in the spirit and find out what his aura we're tired of here interpretations and this one says it there I'll shoot the horn and I'll do this now - that is this is that is the word of God amen now I believe friends that we have a vision this of prophetic Seventh Seal message of divisions amen and we have a word of God is open revealed and we have history 1963 1975 is history and we have an ace the Eagle age and all blend together and variant minute has never changed as freedom man says 1966 have strolled at the seven thunders Amen he throws at it and you try to figure it out driving personated and all the time I'll have something here on the brief let's read over here is the inspiration strikes me this is the way God does it page eight well now hate is a book a mysterious book is a book of redemption and there we know that this book over Jensen will not be thoroughly understood this prose had through six church ages well at the end when the seven danger begins a sound has Miss Lee he winds up all of the loose ends and that these fellows hold that and the mysteries come down from God as the Word of God and reveals the entire revelation of God then the Godhead and everything else is settled all the mysteries / conceit of whatever morning is to be revealed now we understand that in 1933 and March there we were all sitting in there and then each day there God sent down the mystery to his prophet he says here as the word of God the Misses come down from heaven as the winner amen and the prophet the angel brings him the word 106 angels it rains in the horrors and then he goes into study and traces the mystery and the worst and with it locked then you walked out that night each night and preach the word the Missy wasn't veal as the word nothing strange about it is the word Amen all right now go further I'm gonna stand up there now now you see I'm I'm just not making it up Neff what is not saith the Lord our ready to out of the book the founding of the seven angels message the mystery of God should be finished that's been declared by his holy prophet that's the prophets who have wrote the words at the founding of the seventh church age the last turkey all the loose ends that through these procedures have been cold at the offense we're told that it will be wound up together and when the seals are broken and the Missis every meal down comes the angel the message of Christ setting its foot upon the land upon the sea with a rain of all his head relation 10 that's right and now remember this seventh angel is on the earth at the time of this coming now just as John was giving his message the same time that Messiah came in two days John knew he would see him because he were going to introduce him and we realize that in the typical of Malachi 4 there's the one like John and Elijah to whom the Word of God can come to and he is to reveal by the Holy Spirit all mystery and restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the Apostolic fathers to restore back all these mysteries that's been told that to these denominational years now that's what the word said I'm just responsible for what it says please now we see that this Seventh Seal book is done mystery of redemption the pulse of a Testament God now although misses at this time should be finished at the sounding of this message and now this now here here's the aim on earth and another angel mighty messenger come down see this angel was the earthly angel messenger but here comes one down from heaven a rainbow covets the only Christ it could be just exactly like it was in Revelation chapter one salmon and here he returns back in the tenth chapter see after the coming time that all the mysteries ought to be finished and the steel ought to be books and proclaiming at time is no more the 70 of these seven seals has the book filled the book is absolutely filled the adhere the book is absolutely a steel book until the seven seals are broken the seal up at seven seals now that's different from the seven thunders this is seven seals on the book and a book will not the seals will not be released until the message of the seventh angel alright it's like to say now we see then that the mysteries come down to the angel in water to drink as the word of God and then we have the God who was in heaven sending down the mysteries as the word what we got him overhead revelation 10 himself coming down with rainbow covenant the seventh seal now he's on the earth as long as the seventh birthday angel at the same time and then he's saying that when he's on the earth he thunders out seven thunders on the earth but over here corner Malachi 4 he was in heaven sending down the misses from heaven in mark 63 to those six angels there and they brought into the room and it popped it on the prophet who stood for the word the white horse rider red horse rider and so on and so on and then but now he himself is on there thundering out seven thunders on the earth so we're gonna set it free all praise God I hope you do because then he's on the earth himself give out a seven Thunder message and for many get nervous and uptight we against it honk about it there's mallet at four and the entire everybody from Adam all the way down and waiting for us to talk about it wait for us to get into it wait for us to get us our third full Plaza and begin to ask God for wisdom amen God reveals to me if

to speak the same thing and say the same thing as we should edify and exhort with spirit one another amen by way of remembrance of the prophetic message of malapascua which is seven seals and the six filled water here many complete six seals but the seven seals was Christ behind human in giving out the holes of the atonement all my was dripping with drugs it was it was aligned it was a token he

had the to vote for the sins and one was plain and the blood was sprinkled by the high priest seven times and with his linen garments on and then when he had some finished when he had come out then and then he had took the other scapegoat and confessed his sins and all the Congress intends on a head of the scapegoat and then sent this goat borrowing with the people spend and he changed his garments amen it went inside us put all his priestly garments and it all Israel waited with a bated breath once the year would he forgive us was Jehovah but gives us this here they didn't know he

bit of it Amen yes the reason God seven thunders but already enough amen now Isaiah 59 nineteen any kind of like a flood the nine years - excuse me God raising us standing up his own words how does he do it by making the same spirit spoken word more positive by what how can he make the same word in Malachi 4 more possible by 1935 by revealing the seven thunders of Malachi 4:2 the people oh then what Malachi so understood a new of the seven thunders when I get it I have the same thing amen that makes the word more positive then if this whole church Ezard has what Malachi 4 knew it was then you have that thing in here the same thing as early church head where he restored his back to it then the word has made more positive quicker more sharpen a two-edged sword then the bride has he revealed sunders in her and then God has raised up his standards sniffing excuse me the entire don't get one read something do you put on the whole armor of God Tenten Maria it takes the hidden power of the Spirit of God that word in there to break the whole like Peter keep the cut off the term is here with its poor but when it comes to real Christian and courage he didn't have it but after

yes God provided armor he had the baptism filled with the Holy Ghost quote now see what is it God makes himself ever-present his own army God on the day of Pentecost sent down the form of God for his army that was himself among you amen yet a little while in the world hit me no more yet ye shall see me because I will be with you even in you until the end of where he brews 12 matter 28 he is with you he is with us and in earth that is the arm of the word and he is the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is in US which is the word making the promise manifest the spirit quickens the word other words he's the power that tends to pull it out there with him like David when he met Goliath there was only one place for the rock to hit everything else was army but God got into that spirit rock he had five stone facing Jesus something fixing to help because there is the word that promising the power of flinging amen now that's God's army his word of fire his army all dressed with the ever President himself I'll go with you being you not me to speak at the father-daughter venue he do it the word now he's presents his army in the form of five officers Apostles process teachers pastors evangelists

here amen sitting with blood yeah [Music] yes I may be a little startled at the subpoena place but the voice of God the last thing how can we know the voice of God what can we tell the voice of Hollywood the voice of this the voices that how do I know Malik asked for he wouldn't leave us like that without telling a man who would do that please I want to finish it off right here and tell you what he said the voice of God painting and the voice of God they say how will we know is the voice of God because of the day long you look at all further off there are so many voices in the earth today that is absolutely a hard thing because it judges the voice of the supernatural if so many intellectual voices great voice a mighty man for intellectuals that in their selection condition even takes an ancient they're just our overnight people but they shake nation of bringing great organizations together great campaigns flowering and a person would be a bit confused it's enough to confuse them of how that these things go on and prosper and there's voices and raise up and do these things but it causes the voice of God the place way back somewhere the two boys we got and the voice of God it's a how will we know what the voice of God because for the day then it was in a vindicated prophet now today how we know if the voice of God because it is the manifestation of the prophets words and we that weekend this is God's prophet it's the Bible and a true voice of God only brings back at real living supernatural God with this supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the truer then we know that it is the voice of God because that super there's so much other in the other realm that just almost did it out but remember it will glisten it will come forth it'll do it and I believe it for it has done it down in through the other seven ages always [Music]
