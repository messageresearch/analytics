[8:15] rock to slay the enemy in the
[8:19] forehead standing right here December uh
[8:23] June 20
[8:26] 1973 when inspiration dropped down from
[8:28] heaven
[8:31] to send it out and bring on the seven
[8:34] Thunders it started June
[8:37] 20th
[8:40] 1973 it was the inspiration to slay the
[8:42] intellectual conception of the
[8:47] message and it was on a message ask what
[8:49] you
[8:51] will I was praying for my wife's
[8:54] ey remember the old many of the old
[8:56] times remember the
[8:58] message
[9:00] and it was a prophecy that broke
[9:03] in and it uh was predicting what has
[9:07] happened the spirit of the Lord dropping
[9:12] down and uh uh that night there were
[9:16] several
[9:18] situations and
[9:20] circumstances surrounding the
[9:23] church number one was praying for my
[9:26] wife's uh the disease in the eye
[9:31] glucoma and of course the eye is
[9:34] blind which would take a miracle to open
[9:38] it so if you understand I'm praying for
[9:41] that disease that's
[9:44] there because it's behind the eyes she
[9:46] can go uh uh it could go into the brain
[9:49] any
[9:52] time so sister k h on all these
[9:56] years and she gets these attacks and
[9:58] still still
[10:00] there but she's trusting
[10:03] God Amen then I just said spirit I
[10:07] didn't say nobody's
[10:10] name amen but number three uh on this
[10:14] I'm going play the tape for you a little
[10:15] bit of
[10:17] it uh on the
[10:19] inspiration I said the seven Thunders is
[10:21] in
[10:23] me
[10:25] amen and on the
[10:27] inspiration said there'll become for a
[10:29] fivefold
[10:31] Ministry it'll come forth in the
[10:34] Dynamics and and they'll go after the
[10:38] Lost then there was the prophecy
[10:42] itself which which was in two
[10:44] parts and so which I didn't know it was
[10:47] two
[10:48] parts until about three years
[10:51] ago so about 15 minutes or
[10:54] so you can hear the
[10:56] inspiration when it dropped down cuz the
[10:59] night is
[11:01] finished amen there's a new season is
[11:04] here a new
[11:06] time so may the Lord bless you as maybe
[11:08] open your understanding
[11:11] tonight to know uh I had a standing as
[11:14] every
[11:17] Spirit
[11:18] alone with the
[11:20] Revelation no vision cuz the word is
[11:24] greater than the
[11:26] vision no feeling
[11:29] cuz the great anointing didn't come
[11:31] until
[11:34] 1975 but I had to stand on the
[11:37] word amen God said so God said
[11:42] so and you got to stand the same way
[11:46] tonight if you're ever going to go into
[11:49] Rapture Lord bless
[11:51] you brother BR said check your vision
[11:54] with the word he said no he said check
[11:56] the voice with the word that voice said
[11:58] Joseph Grace I mean uh Jacob Grace
[12:00] Joseph affection the word said the same
[12:02] thing and the prophet said the same
[12:04] thing also therefore it's got to be
[12:05] right praise the Lord and then David
