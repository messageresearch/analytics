then you have no more confidence you may be seated thank you so my purpose is to pray for the sick today oh and the old Micah's here and some specials amen and brother Robledo preach the masterpiece in between the prayer lines greater is He that is in you the heat is in their flesh trying to stop you a man greater more powerful sharper than any two-edged sword amen so that message was ordained to encourage the ones that was pray for on the twelve and to remember that God can heal you while you at the kitchen sink after you pass through the prayer line he could heal you out in the field pitching hay milking the cows Bray has got a kick over the spray it's got to have a shouting time in the chickens be shouting hallelujah cows be kicking my County my brother s happy sometime huh he know what I'm talking about praise God yes siree he imagine getting the hill are you trying to melt the cows I mean getting sealed yes sir we're not there wonderful and ground to see the pigs and fall in there praise God happy something else again huh well god knows hundred you know he knows that he knows where to seal you amen well I see the people understand what I'm talking about must understand my lingo a man praise God now let's remember that great message from last week and build your faith on the word amen and today as you approach the prayer line and just recap in st. John 20 and 21 as a god up in 221 there was three appearances about Jesus to his disciples to teach them a man and he had two appearances the first Sunday 2nd Sunday and then he appeared in st. John 21 to his disciple and they have gone on fishing I preached this in 1974 as the thunders and faith virtue and knowledge and now we know by knowledge when our nipa that speaks the miraculous does take place regards what anybody says amen I mean God can live with your fool away your foolish man God does not like I don't care if it takes a thousand years praise God it'll happen because God said soul may take 120 years maybe seventy years down at Babylon may take seven days in the upper room or ten days you may be seated but it's going to happen because God said so so that was the end of the first climax faith virgin now is in the second one come in and in st. John 21 now is this third appearance and that's where we are right now on temperance May 12th and today is the 26 patients for is God so now I'm nipa tense is speaking in your lives doing these meetings messages it's very simple it's this word speaking like it did in 1974 1984 you come back around again to third time speaking again and some going fishing again amen they don't know well see John said it is the law John recognizes it and John recognized it's not the whole church let them do what they want to do but John himself is haven't remindful individual revival some may want to go here and there if you look the eyes and look at the church well then well yeah I don't see everybody doing everything well if they're not going to everything because the individual is individual it is the Lord from John oh yes that's right I'll sit the shaking her head she's saying my god that's right sister the shaking isn't it a man see and so I'm nipa to speaking in your Lara's omnipotence is this word that I'm speaking and from the Prophet tying it in together amen temperance and for Christ directed service but temperance and patience and God isn't probably carrying this and then the token is displayed through brother kindness the dog lead a needle Oh wouldn't it be wonderful because all these questions about this man seems so may 12 a temperance self-control and the holy spirit had a real good message I mean a real good quotes for self-control the token you know by kicking out the trash and the TVs and stuff like that that ties directly into self-control on that button that little black button as you gotta turn Oh hallelujah breathe that's why I was stuck right on there omnipotence put it right there to teach some temperance saint man so we got into and on May 12th there and read directly from Malachi 4 his message to talk him how to apply and then the question was hard to apply the talking for the house amen so I made a show for the house see and so then it didn't was read what's in the house all met magazines in the house newspapers and stuff like that and TV and trash is in the house now of course you got things in your heart but we were a speaking it on the house and how to prior to token for the whole house let's sing it in the day a man and hai-yah told hi it had to be done had to kick on the television all these things here some people got upset well brother Coleman say 1980 to get a monitor you ain't getting upset at me I know that and anybody that would ever come to your question about down what do i do I got this as a gift well that's your problem not the ministry problem you don't have to manage your problem this is a gear and I only consecrated the this TV to the news suggest just the news now should I keep it that is your business it's not my business and not their business so don't bring those nonsensical questions to the ministry we got nothing to do with it the token said kick the TV out or get a shotgun and blast it out now if you don't want to stand image maybe we'll speak it and Zulu or something praise God and get a translation for you no American has any business coming to any member of the of the of the ministry to ask about the TV because brother Bram has made it very clear so you don't have to ask us should take up the tumor out of the VCR we can undo it that go to the man who takes care the tumors in there let electronics you go there don't ask us see it's a question between you and God it's not between you the Ministry of God because brother frame already spoke it we don't anything to do with it we pray for the sick you know you confess your simple TV questions that's why I was put on temperance I paid $1,000 for anything to do with that what should I do FC is done to make you pray make you talk to God y'all got this is a beautiful one talk to God about it amen oh I know what's on here is filthy ungodly God is just a thing pretty scarred amen even though commercials and everything else so hope is settled today amen don't come asking me if I got to do with him you see and there was a testimony went along on may 5th and then I just mentioned a dream so I thought since the menu here maybe didn't hear the dream my sister had a dream and here's a dream and his way the dream wind it tied it into the token and the people now we get ready pray for the sick me twelve the May 26 and dog brought this on May 5th now these spirits I'm gonna read it again now we can try to pray for the sick and everybody's wondering why is mystic heel is there nope almond Gilead why are the doors of my children not healed of my people not healed is it no balm in Gilead is there no TVs in Gilead huh praise God the people in church were praying and and the prayers were mighty and glorious mighty prayers went up brother maybe someone up like Cornelius Prince and a memorial was written in heaven for you I don't know maybe many in here they have memorials in heaven for themselves for their prayers well god bless you Justin just include me in your memorial Prince yes sir clued me in there amen and the prayers were mighty and glorious the scene change and again that people were praying now remember I'm gonna pray for the sick twice keep it in your mind hey man yo be spiritual how could God drop this in there on the main thing just before I pray for the sick the twelve 426 if I already pass through the prayer lines some people coming through with TVs on their mind how you don't get healed amen yeah all kind of questions about television I gotta quit my no television I know it's wrong it's wrong there's no question about it it's wrong amen so there's no question the prayers of my name glory is the scene change again the people were praying this time they were praying for brother but he could not be healed could this be May 12th and May 26 and something is stumping it up amen the question arose what is the matter why Cannot he be healed well the word is it no balm in Gilead why are the people why are the children are people not heal that's a Bible question deserves an answer amen suddenly we turn and the answer was given a voice said television how can you expect to have strength till my strength like Samson little stands up on you on it sit and watch television little signs up on you higher get up from the TV and then go in the room say once more Lord how do you do that you hypocrite you what are you talking about praise God though once the ball Lord ah mother ran in there when they had a commercial amen praise God Amen well hallelujah diner glory should I send this tape out brother I don't know they said just man crazy see sister LaRon she walked right into this video a man see a man suddenly turn in the answer was given how are you gonna build faith brother Coleman how I'm gonna build faith oh the faithful ones are gonna receive it they don't get healed but this is the word I'm taking things away from them amen praise God return the answer was given a voice said television how can you expect to have strength when you have a core it going to Hollywood inhale when you should have a chord going to heaven that's all what it is everybody how can I apply the token to my house well take the court out of there and plug it to heaven then the total would be applied to your house very simple quiet you know come on any hit of motors they put it in third in amen so amen so you got to quit you got it now uh a dream was had a few years ago when the voice said my yes sir but while preaching temperance sees person makes their own decision amen how can you have strength I don't know amen it's messed up on the word and the message amen but while preaching temperance the Holy Spirit gave the answer from the message to Tolkien now the real issue is television itself not the sports and all the rest of the things and all the good things that maybe you could put on there and the museum's and things like that you know that's okay in itself but that's not what the prophets talking about the Prophet was talking about the TV nothing to do with sports don't do anything and you talked about getting rid of the TV here's a get rid of sports or get rid of good things or nothing set the television now you take it up with God if you want to put on the news or whatever it is I don't know I'm gonna do with that amen praise God and they do have monitors they'll cost a bit more of course amen now the real issue is that's what it is and Malachi enforce it to get rid of it why for we in the 3rd Exodus we're going to heaven that's what do you understand now I'm not preaching against your television I'm preaching to those who want to get free to go to heaven I mean how long do you think we won't be here another 75 years or one huh you won't find me here praise God so on and my bones won't be bleached either God I'll tell you that the last time out now brother Cornell with us now I'm liked a little testimony I don't know whether sister Lawrence was there not in 1976 and mount Royale I don't know whether she was there in 1976 with brother Tommy Dillard we're down to brother Jeff songs and Freddie a pair of shoe and his little place there and would have a move revival 1976 little testimony relax a man TVs all praise God a mess you nervous time my god hey man so a little testimony and five groups from I think annecy of some way up there and the part of France near of Switzerland and they all come down I think we started on Thursday and Friday and we struck a little revival and then they called back up to the other churches they all come down then the bishop man named says can you get brother Coleman to come up here and like that said no I'm preaching down here so they had to come down there hey man I'll never leave where he sends me so they come down Thursday Friday and mind you the lot of the sisters had on pants and and the brothers you know beards and things and look like John the Baptist amen maybe I come out of woods amen so praise God but they but they love Christ and they love the Lord so all we had a wonderful time Thursday and two times Friday and Saturday morning the Holy Spirit pouring out it was my turn to preach 39 just like here you know I'll be going on fine when revelation all sudden always first it now narrow he said they can't go no further you have to get them sanctifying they cannot go from those pants and show it dresses and stuff over into the Holy Ghost you say and you know that so it lays your life to preach Saturday night to these lovely people thought we was angels preaching all these wonderful things about brother Branham and now I gotta walk out with that sword like I do here all the time then I mean then see you think I'm talking about them see I have to me all the time man I said Lord do I have to do that and he told me it's a Saturday night you have to bring them to the word for sanctification because I want to pour out the third work of grapes holy goes you say you can't bypass sanctification see now talking in France now I'm not talking anybody here I mean it might help somebody here and so there he says take the token and read how to apply the blood to the house so I had to take the very same quotes in order to have the Holy Spirit pour out and I haven't done anything different than what I did on temperance God be my witness so if you want what they had there well then hear what I had to say that time same God Amen ain't changed same message so I I saw okay yeah when I spoke to them and if I was a clap like this you know and then and I hit those quotes and they said it was praising God they were wanting to know what to do say and I was flabbergasted I hit brother Courtney that I had some people that really want me to tell them what to do how to get rid of their self I mean how to help them without arguing back at me and say I'm doing something them oh I tell I could have stayed there in France at the lorentz I could have stayed right there Perez got with those people there so the Holy Spirit poured out that night sanctify them I think brother preach Sunday morning then Sunday night brother Dilek was preaching when he finished up you want the pulpit and brother Daniel Jeff song came in to climax with remarks and I'm standing watching I've seen the Holy Spirit hovering over the people so then I try to tell I couldn't tell the brother what to do paint man but I couldn't go and tell brother tell me I said could we came together I said by the time I mean that I said the Holy Spirit was here maybe you can you you preach you get back in the pulpit again amen and so both Tommy came back in again and then begin to speak and then the people rush forward down come the Holy Ghost and begin to baptize them all night long some slept in it I didn't sleep they stayed in there until the next morning the the closing service was Monday morning and the Holy Spirit pour out again now that's my testimony concerning the coast on TV hope you receive it amen that's what happened they were that's the first time on the field and I actually have seen the people baptized with the Holy Ghost right in front of me I could hardly believe it I hope to see it again assault in 83 and manbo hope to see it again France gone well anyway oh can you imagine being in there all day long and the next people coming in so I can't move but sister I'm sorry the Holy Spirit's up on me praise God amen would you like to have that brace gone that can happen again I read the same quotes again for the same reasons to get the people rated by sanctification for outpouring of charity what I've been doing and then hope you get through Laurie let's strike our subject now love us down me patients v Thunder in Saint John 21 15 through 17 what is patience amen praise God and so we had read the scripture there st. John 21 now I'm only talking to you but I ain't got no strength to preach amen too tired a man so and so when they add down a if you won't read again Jesus said to Peter Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas Lausanne me more than these you sittin on da Lord I know is that I love thee you sit on him feed my lambs I'll hold it right there now see if you have not knowledge you get that say Amen you will not know how to meet the mind of God see you all know what guys doing you think guys against you or something you think that God would just take 600 people's time to take up their time to have me only say something rebuking to you or mean to you because you come in here then you don't know anything about not knowledge at all I mean the knowledge will tell you first thing at four this is you're coming in here for instruction and correction and for reproof so anybody of things like that they're they don't even know anything about God at all they don't even know the mind of God they come in here is the house of correction praise God so all those little babies that you know so you will not know how to meet the mind of God when it comes out you back away your fries do draw amen see now if you don't have if you don't have any temperance if you have no temperance you will do something that will hurt someone else no tampers say anything and do things and no temperance you see hurt people now patience if you have not patience you will be upset by what someone else may be doing to you see so many cannot get in this message will never get past tempers and patience so I know where you ever going to receive charity this is you got a dying see you have to die you got temperance you do something that will hurt somebody else and that's those these two is it's caused all the problem in the church somebody's hurting somebody else or somebody's getting hurt by what somebody else get to them right there those two tempers and patience tempers and patience you hurt me you hurt me amen something Absalon a prey chill had is beautiful here I'll pull down and standing right in the gate there and David was bloody with that sword yes sir hair stood Absalom's a pray tell me sister did David hurt you today told me oh here's my telephone number and I'll preach for you praise God I hold a little meat in your home praise the Lord and you won't have to worry about that bloody mean David he's just mad because he ain't got no hair to pull c/s wise man amen praise God well did you get it I had to make it so you can get it man so see you know if you have no patience you'll be upset by what someone else may be doing to you I don't want be too long with this now like God not giving you a healing when I give you a job or something the apartment or the bettors of the Holy Ghost when you think you should receive it you know some people get mad at God you know yes sir but you know when they get mad at God I don't know why because if you read your Bible see you meet the mind of God it tell you in James 1 3 knowing this that's a trying of your faith worketh patience so what would you get mad at God for he's only trying your faith to work patience out of you amen see it declares Oh is it kind of joy when you fall into divers temptations count it joy give me a Bible preacher Paul and Silas fell into temptation in jail and they sang praise God and God was so pleased it caused an earthquake and it shook the walls and everything else praise God that's what I'm talking about Bible back to the Bible see puts he got these little babies around him you can't get nowhere maybe seen it declares there is a work of patience and God ain't gonna move you off that ash heap until you can get some patients out of you cry all you want to but God ain't moving you praise God hallelujah praise God till you stop getting mad at somebody for saying something about you because if you accost child he's going to work or work our patients through you whether your flesh likes it or not cuz he ain't worried about your flesh he's trying to get to that see Amen yes you may be seated so James declared there's a work of patience knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience be assured understand at the trial and the proving of your seventh under faith brings out patience and endurance and he didn't do it to the end back to the pieman I mean 25 years on waiting he didn't do it to the end and now what what's all these trials for the trials test your seventh under faith you said you believed seven thunders well you send you Charles to test it and the man who stands true in them proves his seventh on the faith to be sound in genuine yes sorry so the test works patience and patience works perfection that correct a man we're just talking to you by the wayside praise the Lord I think Emile won't appreciate just kind of talk to you just talk about Jesus amen alright let's talk about Jesus praise God and Romans five that says there yes sir he measures here and not only soul amen but we glory in tribulations also he imagined a local Pacific glory and tribulations and brother Bob we'll be back you're trying to get all these praises together about brother Bob I'm glory and in my chip elation brother praise God I haven't heard those kind of praise to come to you praise the Lord glory and in it praise God that's what it says here Amen not only saw the weak glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience I'm getting them today huh getting everybody see guys doing something through here and somebody want to go free and the Jubilee he's coming right off through here praise God then came Jesus he's here that's right the same way wasn't 74 he's right back here again the same way it's by the word by the word by the word may be seated so tests works patience and patience works a perfection and amen and it says here in the fourth verse and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us we are not ashamed of the gospel is the power of God and the salvation amen we glory in tribulations like Paul did and solid they were glory in it praise singing and shouting it please go oh my yes sir think on the word that I'm bringing bringing the word amen Bible back to the Bible see if we could talk about now maybe when we get past making mine what kind of meat this all is gonna be huh just a Bible shake it would have a phrase God don't cry sister this is a valuable yes sir 1st Peter 1:7 oh my this is beautiful here on the first for 4th 4th verse to an inheritance incorruptible oh my by the resurrection Jesus Christ the inheritance is incorruptible undefiled your inheritance that book it was in

hallelujah see the difference and those people didn't even have the Holy Ghost they even had the Holy Ghost you got people in a mess of all the mysteries revealed everything else and crying and blaming and complaining and I don't know what else you may be seen here God's trying to get an it the need speed well sister Allen was sitting over here she saw it a long time ago anyway my 1980 she saw brother Bram's hand pouring out from the revelation 8 then the Poirot remember someone remembered and it was a plate coming down thunder and lightning and in her dream 1980 and said she said that she was understanding the thunders and the whole church was when was the understanding the thorns when the hand was born out of play in bowels and things you know like the Gulf War all the plays like hell on earth the fires and things over there and Kuwaiti and the oil burning there's a little sign of Hell praise God and right in this time the people's minds would have come open to the seven thunders they would see that there was a needs being in line from God and nothing brother comb and then they were stopped blaming the troubles on the pastor and on since the soul and soul but they would quit themselves like men like soldiers I'm a soldier in the army of the Lord how many are soldiers in the army of the Lord praise God away with these babies praise God where's the soldiers at amen you may be seen blessed be the name of the Lord well hallelujah can we say Amen Oh amen I can't get off of this strip just a Bible then all these manifold temptations you read the Bible number seven verse seven why why why Lord that the trial of your faith being much more precious enough gold that perishes they would be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ the trial of my faith yes your faith is worth more than gold and silver because I gave you that that's you can't even count the put money to it that's the faith of God that's the faith that can stand then say squirrels that faith must be trap yes 25 years yes hallelujah well there it is a charlie your faith Oh accepted well there we go the child your faith being more precious than gold that perishes though it be tried by fire see the charring of faith worketh patience James 1 for a man what's in James here well the James say praise are we right in the Bible here If any man let patience knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience yeah ok my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let watch patience now that we preach it on let patience have her perfect worry that you may be perfect and entire warning nothing so you mean there's a patient that's got to work through the bride for all these years yeah that's the virtue of the third pole patient like the Prophet had like Noah had like Moses had Daniel the Lions Den had like all the Hebrews of fate had patients because they had the mind of God they knew how to meet the mind of God without a Bible without a video without a cassette without the written scriptures hmm what kind of little babies do we have today little hot houseplants got to be patted and praised and everything else hallelujah Laurie hey you may be seated let patients have a perfect right that you made being perfect and mature and completing the entire one nothing see let patients have full play and do a thorough work so that you may be believers and fully develop with no defects and lacking in nothing praise God notice the Christian is to be joyful and trial in trial not because of trial until you do that sound like an idiot laughing because it's another trial but when the trial comes a needs becomes be patient joyful knowing that your child but then knowing that only God could send his trial cousin of the church name I wouldn't be having no trials I'll be out in the world having a good time but because I am a Christian I will have trials then I'll count of joy I'll be joyful in my trial not because of trial nobody wants child I don't want none either I'm just like you for is God may be seated but when they come a man I'll have to receive him because I have to look at the one who went before me Jesus Christ father remove this cup and his speche you wanted either but the will of God praise God father let thy will be done in my life and my family let it be done Lord the fruit of the trial is patience or endurance the stain panel of life this endurance or patience must be allowed to have his perfect worry don't get all upset the first day and we're on up because here you get the Holy Ghost well you get he'll May 12 patients be like John Ryan it is a process that goes on in the life of a Christian its goal is perfection or maturity that's the goal got one quote to read to you that you have a perfect man just pick up what he said there on patience amen then after that fourthly the Prophet picking it up set your perfect man you'll want to add patience to your faith if you got faith it worketh patience the Bible said so that this is patience now that's the next thing that's going to build this statue see what we're doing through here now we build that statue again amen that's the next thing we won't build a statue you know God's got real material in his building see how short we are brethren see where we add see we have glory we have shouts and things because we have faith but when we come down to these things here God can't build us into that statue he can't make us up to that kind of a place not all these other things we fall and slide off with it he can't build his church business say after all the prop has been ain't gone you still can't build a church ministers fighting the virtues and fighting thunders and how can you build a church amen patience with one what kind of patience first thing is half patient with God that's the first thing if you got a real genuine one on faith you have real genuine patience because faith worketh patience when God says anything you believe it Amen that's all you got patience then well I asked him last night to heal me or will say may 12 and I'm just as sick this morning or today oh my what patients God tool Abraham and 25 years later there wasn't even one sign and he still believed it he was patient with God Amen church put them always before you let him be the next crossing thing you can't cross him so just keep him before you he said now is going to happen keep him before you that's right Oh hallelujah God gives patience amen then God tries your patience find your faith in his word he tries you and patience will keep you from being uh from being upset by anything that someone someone else may do that's likely to wound you then I mean that patience is passive patient just lays back and lays down and then the blows come at you then patience you just you know you you get on a rope fall back on the rope and you bob and weave you know and they throwing left's and rights of patience patience you know it's coming to down to charity and you just wait praise God and all of a sudden why praise God and the devil will be flatten right out so you won't anything else to play the roads later ropes amen amen brother charity is coming thus saith the Lord just have patience it'll be all right amen okay now we right get ready close here now st. John 21 15 through 17 lovest thou me the Lord was teaching Peter patience and love for service gotta use you what you understand up there get people out there how's it gonna use you Jesus to Peter love us down me a couple love is spoken meaning now Christ is speaking you really if you got Greek you can read it in there Christ is speaking to Peter love us down me he's teaching Peter here to help you look paint you don't get impatient let me know see this way he's doing it that's what he likes to do it I can't tell him how to do it amen so you can open up if you want to see love us down me if you have a emphatically see this isn't green now you see the this is it says example lovers on me more than these you sittin here ya a Yale or and don't know how I love thee he said unto Him feed my lambs now a gap of love is speaking meaning he said do you really love me more than the rest of disciples as you post it did he post he posted in Matthew 26 33 through 35 it's what he said in also st. John 13 36 to 38 we just pick up what Peter said praise God he thought the hole he goes up on him yeah it was powerful praise God Peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of the yet will I never be offended see a spirit of man speaking out in a spirit of man that was the Holy Ghost amen see Jesus said them verily I say unto thee that this night before the crow thou shalt deny me thrice my my yes siree see these flesh parts to get up in prophesy and say all kinds of things you know what they gonna do and what this is and so forth I don't pay it no attention because I know at the end charity's gonna speak a man well bless God by the Tony Cooper god bless you my brother you push it but Tony Cooper see you back along the wall you down in Atlanta Georgia holding forth in Atlanta amen we're coming down there you know we're going over to make it amen Fred guys come on over to the meeting praise you gotta meet you over there and if you miss me from shouting I'll be shouting over there if you miss me from praying I'll be praying over there I'll be praying over there are hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah just come on over and I'll be shouting over there I'll be shouting over there praise God Tony now Tony I'm gonna stay off that Stone Mountain brother I ain't going out there I don't like I'm on Stone Mountain Frisco yes sir okay amen everybody feeling good yes sir praise God now the law was teaching Peter patience and love for service and Jesus said to Peter love is down me and a couple of has spoken meaning do you really love me more than the rest this high but as you posted Peter and he had all sort of greater love than the rest yet no one treated him more basely than Peter did and Peter replies now repeat his words come back and fill your love because he don't have no couple he did receive it all he goes yet so he answers back yes Lord you know that I love you that I have a deep instinctive personal affection for you as a close friend yes Lord I'm a Christian hate my times you know I love you I gave mine to the pill and fun when check was around do I love you oh you know I love you lord getting mad with God's angry cranky Bray is gone well a my brother yes see if we talk about here now see Jesus a hymn to Peter that didn't shake Jesus he just beat up he said feed my lambs my in the second time love is on me he's picking the gospel love again though and Peter answered the second time he's a plan replying back in filial love love us on me more important than love for men is love for Christ more than these and the only acceptable motive is love and service and the motive his love and the object is Christ anything else you've missed the mark Jesus was broken he just loved in the presence of his brethren he does not want to entrust his lambs to one who does not love him so you find out in the message how many love God you see how many ministers you got yes siree I'm gonna put his lambs in their hands they got all kind of crazy interpretations and everything else hallelujah so they don't love a word you love these interpretations more then the word amen amen yes Peter needed love to assume his pastoral office and Peter denied the Lord three times before the crowed now what is Jesus doing Jesus is making him make a triple confession because he loves Peter he's not busting Peter [Music] brother Coleman busted me he's proven Peter because he loves you so he makes me turn around up on you and probe in there Oh hallelujah Ray's cut you get a revelation today nobody's busting you yes hallelujah it may be seen Peter spacious was wearing thin with God and these messages all these years the last 17 years especially trying has been trying to probe your love for the word and then you get annoyed and walking out I'll speak against the pastor he did this to me did that to me this to me and all Jesus in the pastor is trying to prove you love us down me love has found me love us down me well who's me me is the word then the pastor preaches the word to prove your wealth can you say hallelujah sister do you like Jesus how long would that last do you sure your sweet sister how I'll do you sky and that got him no sword belongs in his hand for his gun a man sold in many get annoyed because of trying to prove she just speaks in filial love the third time now Jesus dropped from a gospel to filial he said Peter are you fond of me Peter and do you like me I mean uh do we have a nice friendship and Peter knew what he was doing there Peter knew he was had Peter knew he was being busted and sweetness and by the word Amen Peter was grieved the third time he was uneasy he was in sadness because his human sphere was exposed and he couldn't ruin it couldn't have and what was Christ doing Christ was breaking that will stay with you and all the rest leave busted our he broke it because he had failed Jesus and denied him and yet had boasted of his great love for the Lord yet he denied him for jesus knows now Peter saying I could jesus knows something about me that maybe I don't know that's when you see him coming here to back up preaching see the back up the Gordon balcony go down the basement see because they think maybe that morning they just did something to Jesus and they show you that I might call it out so they get away praise God even praise God see you think I don't know huh oh come on now I'm your pants I love you trying to help you praise God but Jesus know some about me that maybe I don't know which might lead to another fall does brother Coleman know that I almost missed the Lord when i holler at my husband you know he made me mad and then you know does he know that this morning maybe I shouldn't go sunny morning you know may I stay home maryska he might know something I don't know what he might preach amen see Peter was humbled Lord thou knowest all things now when you get like that you're gonna get the Holy Ghost now know is that I only love thee in filial love Lord you know that I can only love you in my human love I don't have the Holy Ghost Loren but I'm trying I ain't going nowhere though I fail so many times I'm staying where would I go Joanne going out in the world and don't have the Holy Ghost and I fail you all the time now all I got is filial love I know what I love thee and I know I denied you many times Lord I

fire is burning praise God nothing can stop you with a couple love but filly a lot to stay home backslide and you know think about it they still love the Lord amen so Jesus may be seated was exposing filial love this third time so the seventh under word see says this morning and tonight to you number one are you fond of Jesus do you like him do you trust him in like a fellowship or friendship or is there a seed in your soul that really wants to love God in a couple love with a burning desperate love in answer to the question love us now me this morning honey had this burning desire I'm asking

Navas down in Puerto Rico taking on - rest April 1970 and I'll threaten the house and I'll keep walking out and look up on the mountain just flat top mountain up there I didn't know what it was so I asked this next-door neighbor was one witness the house name was Naomi I said Naomi what what is that up there and she's oh that's junkie junkie I said what's that mean she's a whoa the great Indian chief L junkie you know the Indians that was here before the Spanish from and he was a great chief because he had patience with all the people's problems he had patience and so they likened him to a blacksmith in the anvil that's the way the mountain was shaped like flat a blacksmith would take and put the thing in and hammer away and make it hot and shape and fashion it you see and I said oh I just put that man Son and Holy Spirit says go up there I'll meet you up there 1970 now you have to be around for a while to remember that a lot of people thought the 1977 was the end of the world and America was be destroyed and it was put that away just that way and God does things he put things a certain way you don't like to profit be up on a mountain and then the Holy Spirit says leave this in and take that out you send it type it up publish it but there be many will come in down their profits wrong here because it says over here that's for them not for you amen yes sir praise God he know that they would leave like the 70 what eats your blood drink your blood and eat your fresh what are you a vampire your false prophet it didn't happen 1977 see so anyway to go up there and I made arrangements to go up there and then have this being in the rain forests all the people from Puerto Rico know that in the rain forest there is a tourist attraction and then but they know what the

recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise now mama ran was totally blown out he happens serving God in 1961 in the message and the Prophet had gone and preaching and preaching and here in 1970 I'm looking for the rapture or something and here he told me that that I had neither patience that I have to do the will

God Amen so one day a 1975 talking brother candelario so yeah brother Coleman he said you know the Puerto Rican ministers did it it was you know kind of shake up why he says well you know brother

there born right here in Puerto Rico hallelujah well praise God a lot of things you might tell me to do that they don't know anything about yes sir the will of God but what is the will of God one day seven hundreds are those seven voices of the seven churches after you you had neither patience you must do the will of God about seventeen years against all spirits preaching in season out of season to everybody every spirit amen and then he that will tarry will not tarry well I believe that he has not tarry that he has come in dynamics trying to finance the people who are ready oh yes sir so he told me you have neither patience after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise so mindful yet a little while he does shall come will come and will not tarry Oh church cast not away

condition I don't how many times you tried to storm the best deal praise God one day you want to break through one day you're gonna break through praise God but we are of them that believe to the saving of the soul God will keep his promise don't be guilty of shrinking back press forward by faith for the promise cast not away therefore your confidence have patience with God through all these rebuking messages and all this pressure of the times of this hour brought to bear upon you because God sees a needs be and it's very hours you're going through it's a need speed temptation trials everything else manifold temptations almost wipe you out but don't shrink back cast not away therefore your confidence he's only trying to work patience in you for the promise of charity because after you have done the will of God you might inherit the promise of charity it's enough to give you a charge in your battery recharge it praise God saw the words do God's will first be born again and then add those seven virtues and then charity you shall in here the power don't cancel your confidence and what God has already done for you after you have done the will of God receive these seven Thunder promise seeds and stagger not through unbelief aim your might during this present visitation of the Holy Spirit receive the promise he that will come is here now I believe appearing among us to seal us and heal us God will do it for you love us now me may you like Peter patiently wait for that example love Peter needed example love to assume his office but he had to be humbled first Jesus could not let Peter or anyone go into service with filial love why not because because you will fail and this day you'll fail the filial love anointing of the seven seals over you and enough brother and many ministers and believers have failed because of Noah gap alone but a revelation has come to you many of us were serving him in filial love like Peter with a seventh under revelation and Peter had revelation also thought to Christ without the Holy Ghost and he failed when Jesus on that night and denied him three times they don't believe and in many of us fail Ehrman carnal worldly filial love so patiently except the words that they add to your temperance patience to see the patience to do well church lovest thou me love us now me without charity your service cannot be accepted you are useless you are nobody but if you were believeth Yves is one fine that you are predestinated unto adoption then he will heal you and seal you and bring on another Ephesians for the journey for the third Exodus so praise God cast not away therefore your confidence I say rise and shine your Spears I save press forward on to the mark of the high calling of God hallelujah God tries your patience on the spoken word he tried Noah and Abraham and Moses remember he speaks the word to you for promise seven thunders give faith and all rest of him and he tries your faith on what he spoke to you remember that what did he speak to you in a couple of through the Prophet seven thunders and etc and all give you faith and seven gather people together all the promises and he told you through the Prophet I will send the dynamics to your mechanics he told you through the profit which is vindicated there will be a resurrection there will be a rapture there will be a wedding supper there will be a millennium there will be a new city so I say today as we get ready for this prayer line cast not away therefore your confidence you have to do the will of God what is it will look down your life being pouring in and and pouring them seven virtues into your life to form the image of Jesus Christ that caught my habit praise God with charity Oh hallelujah the quick physician [Music] sweet
