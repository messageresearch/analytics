[0:07] the coming of the Lord is so close at
[0:10] hand until the spirit from way down in
[0:13] here just barely
[0:15] justification
[0:17] sanctification the work of the Holy
[0:19] Spirit bapm of the Holy Spirit and now
[0:24] right into the
[0:25] time of the coming of The
[0:28] Headstone the church has got to be so
[0:30] perfectly like
[0:33] Christ until Christ and the church can
[0:35] unite
[0:37] together the same
[0:39] spirit and if the spirit of Christ is in
[0:43] you it makes you live the life of
[0:46] Christ act the Life of
[0:48] Christ do the works of Christ he that
[0:51] believeth on
[0:53] me the works I do shall I do
[0:56] also Jesus said that see now now we're
[1:00] going to have to
[1:02] have we got a Ministry
[1:05] coming that's just exactly
[1:09] like the Life of
[1:12] Christ what does that Ministry
[1:17] identify the coming of the
[1:19] Lord is that why the headstone is
[1:25] here to be identified in the coming of
[1:28] the Lord
[1:31] you mean that g the prophet said that
[1:35] Gabriel will blow the seventh
[1:38] trumpet and out of the seven
[1:41] trumpets will come Moses and
[1:43] Elijah back to the
[1:46] Jews and the bride and everybody will be
[1:51] identified in the coming of the
[1:55] Lord is that why he has
[1:58] appeared a shout
[2:00] a revelation of seven
[2:03] Thunders to get you in the
[2:06] resurrection and what were you
[2:09] told there'll be another
[2:12] call at a later
[2:14] date is this the date the token
[2:19] displayed is the
[2:21] resurrection is that what it's all
[2:24] about if God before

[2:54] pick it up some other
[2:55] time now I want you to notice one thing

[3:00] that might encourage you
[3:03] immediately after that prophet's
[3:06] message is you fell in
[3:08] sin seven years midianites malachit
[3:14] isites and this was a very uh
[3:18] inspiration that the lord gave me nine
[3:20] years
[3:22] ago to going down to
[3:24] Georgia and take the barley
[3:27] cake and flatten the midianites
[3:31] Abraham's
[3:32] children through
[3:38] kentor they would flatten their
[3:43] tent
[3:45] W and what's the next one bring them
[3:49] down to the
[3:50] water take me to the
[3:54] water take me to the water why separate
[3:59] them

[5:07] dignitaries they were watching their
[5:08] friends they were looking for tents
[5:11] looking for white horses and they
[5:13] wouldn't drink the water on their
[5:17] bellies but God found 300 belly
