righteousness I will go into them and I will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter so notice now the gates of righteousness is called the Gate of the Lord amen there's only one gate where he put his name at and only there will you sacrifice to him amen praise God I will praise him for thou H has heard me see it positive faith believeing that God is am amen knowing that God heard you amen settle in there overshadow with his presence that promise verberate in your heart knowing God's going to answer it amen I will praise thee for thou Hast heard me and art become present tense my salvation the stone which he which the builders refuse is become the head stone of the corner is it right now is he your head praise in secret it's going to come out soon

and grant us thy salvation I will hear what God the Lord will speak see all age now listening to the word for he will speak peace unto his people and to his Saints but let them not turn again to Folly you know what Folly is lack of understanding you know what I mean the revealed word went forth first and 65 was finished then comes Folly see it the Folly is all these crazy ideas it says here don't turn again to that that you had back in the Pentecostal age he come in 6 3 and 65 and showed you the way and turn around again and say and Heap to yourselves teachers have knit your [Music] ears surely his salvation is n them that fear Him That Glory May dwell in our land that's our promise you understand that mercy and Truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other truth shall spring out of the earth and righteousness shall shall look down from heaven ye the Lord shall give that which is good and our land shall yield her Increase righteousness shall go before him and Shall Set us in the way of his steps God's going to do it am amen Isaiah 54:14 in righteousness shalt thou be established imagine established confirmed in righteousness Vindicated in righteousness Thou shalt be far from oppression all those old thoughts amen amen amen are the devil and no faith and see falling down oppression the devil's because he's oppressing you see but in righteousness far from those things for Thou shalt not fear amen and from Terror these things upon the Earth here you know the the world constantly far from them for it shall not come near thee am may the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word I believe I can sit down now God has spoken through his Psalms and already made it live in our hearts just reading the word the anointed word this is Anointed because this is for the day and we can just read that word and just get up and and walk the floor filled with the Holy Ghost for he is the word amen amen praise our God i' like to take a text out of here Gates of righteousness and the gates of righteousness is the Gate of the Lord and straight is the gate amen praise our God and God you can't Worship in just any gate any Baptist Church Methodist Church Pentecostal church or Catholic Church not any one of them Episcopalian Church but you will worship in the street gate amen the word that's where I put my name at the others has got Baptist name Methodist piscop Alan names but my name is in the word amen and it is Jesus Christ now if you want to marry me then you'll take my name you will repent and be baptized in my name amen praise God and here's David here crying out in Psalms 18:19 open to me the gates of righteousness he's praying there amen he's asking of the Lord something here and then he States what he will do positively he tells the Lord what he will do here he says here in Psalms 118 here he says uh uh uh I will praise thee for thou H has heard me and art become uh my salvation see and so therefore um we can think about the gates about the 12 gates in the temple of the Lord he's saying open up this Temple unto me and there's 12 different Gates there and all of them is the Gate of the Lord 12 different because Apostles 12 ways to go because 12 is the Eternal Perfection that's what it means Eternal Perfection 12 see so now Christ has has been calling and this called out age his bride to walk through the Straight Gate the gates of righteousness in this called out age here and since 63 when the Lord himself descended with a shout he's been calling out the bride and it's been a separation time since that that time separation time see and what has been transpiring God has has been calling a bride and Satan has been calling a church and the sodomites has been calling all the rest of them to the filth of Sodom amen he's been calling the women to take off their clothes and put on micro minis yeah is that right amen he's been calling the so-called manhood to be a perverted amen and have long ha yeah see amen and walk around with because eminates sodomites there's a spirit a deep calling to the Deep that's in their hearts those women are lusting for the things of the world and the devil is there right there with a designers and so forth to give them what they want amen amen and yet back in in the Lord's day when the when the the the the Holy Spirit walked the Earth in the became a body see there was a man who was naked he was called cravy well what about today the whole world has gone crazy amen but thanks be to God we are clothed in our right Minds Hallelujah we have our being about us the word amen we are established in the word of godah think of it now this is the age where uh God is allowing people to have what they want do their thing yes amen and then he also extends out the word if you want salvation you can have that also amen the greatest thing in your heart I don't know it it could be anything a person around the world like a lot of people they just want to come to America that's their great desire other in America want a long vacation somewhere or something or might be a woman she want a fair coat or whatever I don't know some desire of the heart God will give it to you I mean he because he allow you to have that but at the same time and his call out age he's also calling a bride amen with Mercy extended the call out age and while he's been doing this the past seven years see the word the word itself resurrected back in the bride sence following it through his Prophet the resurrected word has been back and come back and give the bride authority to walk through the gates of righteousness hallelujah amen how do you know before the foundation of the world I predestinated that you would uh you have been because predestinated unto adoption as sons and I'm going to do it myself I'm going to come down and child train you I'm going to take my nail scarred hands and lovingly chastise you amen mold you shape you GL into Sons and Daughters of God I'm going to wash the world off of you when a man goes looking for a bride as God's Prophet taught us on choosing a bride he's first to look for character and then for the rest of the things then if he loves her then marry her but first find character and God come to get a bride also and he's looking for character he doesn't want same in the natural if a man is looking for physical Beauty and things of the world where he go out and get a sex Queen all decked out because of the Min skirt and that same spirit is in the church lay out ofia with a with a minis skirt on naked blind wretched miserable poor and don't know they're blind trying to walk before God with a miniskirt on a micro on because here cutting everything else and say Here I Am Lord didn't you call me he didn't call her he looking for character amen and what is character the word for the age amen amen amen the word for the age is character then when he finds that word those seeds he planted for this age he'll mold it and shape it into Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah amen praise God so we see then that what an age at this very time when God is calling up right where all the promise of God is here a promise we are to walk through the gates of righteousness everything in there the works that I do shall you do also raise the dead heal the sick cast out Devils of whatever it is you'll do it amen because that's in the gates of righteousness Hallelujah but I have given you the authority to walk in there I don't have no power just like the uh policeman out here cuz on the corner over here by Macy's here he hold up his hand that's Authority amen how can he stop A Great Big Mac Truck but he hold up his hand they got to stop amen a little man with his hand held up Authority amen well God has put a bride here with authority stop Satan in the name of the Lord praise our God hallelujah amen we have authority to raise the dead to heal a sick and to cast out devil amen with this holy ghost in us why for Christ has resurrected himself back in the bride amen and his word is true amen amen he's made it true to us and we sitting and we weigh that Resurrection you say Lord I know you call me and I know that these things belong to me I know we're supposed to do this here I know this is the called out age where you said that uh you would come and call a bride but Satan is saying you don't do that no more you don't do this no more you giveing too much praise for man this is too much over there that's Satan yet you weighing the promise and the promise say he's the same yesterday today and forever amen so something stirs in you say that going out there and say stop Satan I have authority from God amen amen praise God so then we see the enemy trying to stop the bride from believing all of the promises and they'll come in real smooth like to try to throw away your faith tell you don't praise God too much or if God is working through a group don't give too much praise there that's praise to man it is not praise to man how in the world can man do anything what is man God should be mindful of man he is nothing but when I work through man that ain't man that's God working through there well then you praise God then don't you go repent for for not praising for praising don't ever repent for praising God too much amen don't ever repent for praising God to me I don't care where

that right he got in there and he saw the glories never failed let us pray for him what is it friends it's a sign that God is in his word that's the word and God Vindicated it just like I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living same word same God because confirmed that word he confirmed this word with this boy salvation last week is that right amen amen isn't that on God's hand salvation on his hand raising the dead on his hand isn't it is that right am it's the hand of the lord well he just showed you salvation showed you the other one let show you the rest amen but it's got to believe that you believe in the word you got to believe that word well then if you believe that now you'll know what's been transpiring since Esther the word has been presented to you amen everywhere all notice now all thing that that's been preached here it's got to be said first you got to receive it amen and don't faint see and watch watch God God himself confirmed that praise God that's I hope you get that it's got to be spoken which it has and still is this morning and tonight and Wednesday it'll be spoken that all of a sudden he'll come suddenly to his Temple he's laid the word out now everybody don't believe these things you know tell take that boy to some of these groups somewhere now well you know you could make it as a foolish virgin oh yeah that's right absolutely they'll tell you at the door in the groups in the message absolutely but he can find a place where they believe all of the word amen now you understand what words of promises being planted it's got to be spoken out now see the prophet spoke it out over the whole world but you got to find individuals who will take that now amen or maybe a church somewhere that will take it as a body amen and you watch you'll see just like you saw that boy ra this boy right here you'll see it everything he said praise our God so it's a sign praise God these are words of promise now I want to hurry I don't want to hold you too long this morning but uh I want to get into something here I know God is here this morning amen am he's speaking through his word amen hallelujah and have spoken and will continue to speak amen but I want to bring out four attributes of God that bring Salvation to those who fear God see and uh and the these attributes of God have been at work down through all the ages bringing people to Salvation which is excuse me um Psalm 85 you can open to it because I'm going to speak out of there right now the Lord willing Psalm 85 which is Mercy and Truth righteousness and peace these four attributes have been working down through the ages to bring people to Salvation to those who fear Him fear Him means to really believe this word nowen that there is a God then you fear Him see so now but what I want to say this morning God has been doing a special since 1963 with these same four attributes mercy and truth and righteousness and peace it's been over the long age other words over the overall picture has always been this air because coming to people to bring them to salvation but this age is the bride age the call out age and this has been present tense the fullness of Mercy the fullness of Truth the fullness of righteousness and the fullness of peace now down Through the Ages uh people have uh tasted of this here are you follow me my friends but look at our glorious age where God himself has come down and become our righteousness Our Truth our peace and our Mercy right in our age here now you understand it what I'm talking about right now amen now watch because let us hit this here because for about 5 minutes or so truth now the first one is truth truth is sent forth to make known the revealed word will of God now notice what I said the revealed word will of God truth had to come forward because in the Pentecostal age Le out of seia everybody did what was right in their own mind as to what they thought was the will of God Amen see it now so therefore God said well that's all right the blood is going around the world see but now I'll come down myself and I'll make known my reveal will though they'll read the Bible and swear that's right but I bringing forth in season it'll be contrary to their thinking always is amen see so therefore now like balam there'll be many who because who anointed see and they preach prophesy gifts and so forth see now I will give of that type in 63 and through 65 my perfect will amen see now I told balam don't go see but balam's own heart desire his heart what he wanted to do he had a Lust For Gold and popularity and so forth that was in his heart and God knew it so God told him what to do and he didn't want to do he want to do what he wanted to do so God blessed him and let him go now now you think amen external blessings manifestations right now see but the revealed will of God has been made known the true word Goes Forth first then after that lust desires from their own heart they shall heal to themselves teachers for what they want for what they think it should be are you following me but the perfect will of God then the perfect will of God gives way to the permissive will of God and many are walking in God's permissive will right now and don't know it see and God actually said go ahead yeah ministers they want to preach go ahead he anoint anybody and let him preach if you got an honest heart show go ahead that's wonderful do work for the Lord wonderful go all over the world well that doesn't mean nothing don't mean a thing but if God could find a a vessel somewhere that will hold steady according to the word wait on the LA that's a little different now now when then when the season comes well how do you know what God's going to do they've been laying still whole and still amen laying being overshadow by the presence of God waiting on the Lord many have a running up and down the country all around the world and the Lord sent me here and there and all kind of ideas but they've been laying still God has got a portion here brother just about this much here for this age right here just before 73 he's got something hang hanging hanging right in there but only intelligence wisdom knows what it is amen amen it's got to come by Revelation but he only Wars you to believe that and then when he comes forward you'll see you'll see what he's got HD HD right in here for the bride he's got a certain portion which he did not fulfill on the Earth but he laid it here for this age in the bride and he's going to bring that word through a virgin womb the one that believes all that word and he'll bring it to pass amen praise our God so now abam had his oldal design what he wanted so God gave him of time for it to come out and yet while the time for it to come out a space of time God preached to them through a donkey now it wasn't any donkey don't say that word I mean God can use a donkey I can preach I can say anything no don't you say that that was an ordained Dunkey that that particular Dunkey that particular Dunkey was predestinated before the foundation of of the the word of the priest of bam amen so it's not just any old Jones's donkey come on it's got to be a god inspired donkey praise our God blessed be the name of the Lord with big old ears and everything but it's still God's donkey amen be careful amen man that donkey the finally the donkey had to throw him the donkey saw the angel of the Lord am that right donkey hell still over B ain't seen the word yet because it was given to him but he turned it down what he had in his own heart oh though they prophesy speak in tongues do all manner of things have faith and move all mountains amen see don't mean things yes come into the resurrection and sit down about 30 days will be on the earth morning come on the resurrection shall be on this Mortal Earth at least 30 days and they will come into it looking for rooms and Tents and things and sit down is that right but the bride will have already become the word she's got the robe on when she goes and say down in there the ERS come in the back door trying to get the RO once they in there and he said you don't have a roll get out in the Resurrection on the earth for at least 30 days Amen Let it sink let it dig down deep praise our God the donkeys is still speaking sure amen not just any donkey or just other words can't any man just walk up here and say these things got to be ordained right here to say these things here not just anybody see predestinated the the right person in the right calling am each one in in their own calling amen can rebuke and do all these things not everybody can do that can't do that see God's got an order don't don't get out of his order like I say not any donkey a certain donkey it had to be amen praise all God so now we see them that uh uh um they against the reveal word rule of God the BM type you know well brother the Lord yeah okay well well see now the Lord said here brother yeah but I know but I feel well I stopped I Clos the book up I said well sure God want there for you glory to God sure well now you're all right now you get the the Praises of man now here come well brother Coleman's all right see now stay with that word all over see cover to cover you don't hear that that's the blessing of God there am in here Bo outside back around there well brother a more perfect way of life see well now you know I feel well close it up you ask what what do you think well I think well sure the because God's Prophet did so well you go right ahead brother Bob one time said brother I feel like um oh this message I want to take it around the world brother B go ahead brother Bobby he said go right ahead Lord's with you he said but you know brother when I get to thinking about my wife and um my family I think I should wait on the Lord he saids now if you want to wait amen he said God can do more with you in 5 minutes than what you can do for 100 years in 100 years let that sink now 5 minutes it won't be many that will be in the bride so wherever whatever God wants to be done it can sure be done in a short time cuz there not many only be a few amen amen see so now anyway now it says here in Psalms here 85 praise our God come be hurry now the message got home now the 10th verse praise the Lord amen a mercy and Truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other isn't that beautiful amen now watch truth comes forward to make known the reveal will word of God see now righteousness demands obedience to this truth oh yeah see the righteousness of God spoke out through the prophet every word amen oh Eve take every word demanding it only in this age now did you get it now righteousness the Holy Ghost Christ in the form of the shout come down and demanded obedience to every word to the truth you follow it now see and see so now now righteousness is the character of quality of being right or just see now I have a little note here it was formerly spelled right wiseness they spell that years ago you know right wiseness righteousness other words you was wise see and you was right and you was always wise but they changed the word over to righteousness amen amen praise the Lord so now um the right rightousness of God means essentially the same as his faithfulness or his truthfulness other words that which is constant with his nature and his promises that's why he's the same yesterday today and forever am amen so therefore when his righteousness you say that righteousness that you have that that must be constantly the same with his own nature if you got it and his promises it can't vary cuz he doesn't vary see now see so now there's the bride see cuz she'll have his righteousness see other words righteousness is the quality or or condition of being righteous or just then therefore God has got to bring this bride into a condition into a place where she's always constantly righteous amen amen every word she speaks is the word amen everything she done is by the power of God who can condemn her of sinah the works of God shall prove it have don't I do the very works that

minutes yet um 1 Corinthians 1:30 if you writing it down in scripture because because I'll just read it um but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption he's made unto us this way see so now uh Christ himself he fully met in our place in our stad so to speak because in our behalf every law that mount siai demanded he made it for us praise God we didn't do it he did it for us so he was made unto us righteousness and his righteousness was in Conformity with his nature yeah and he met the Lord demanded at Mount Si the truth he met it and then overshadowed us so completely overshadowed with his blood and his righteousness and that Satan can find no fault in you not one fault brother Kurt take that now not a spot not a nothing can Satan find in you though he will you brother amen but you got to know that Christ is my righteousness the moment you say well I fasted that ain't Christ that's self-righteousness I'm so

deal with those Souls he's doing it some sometimes takes a year I've seen it happen right here but he'll do it amen for he is our righteousness that's what God wants to get home this morning and and and therefore that is the way the church has come all through ages by faith by grace understanding that he was made our righteous he died for us in him by faith was we judged we died at Calvary we were burried in the grave we Rose his justification with him amen and we are now set in Heavenly places amen do you believe it praise our God that's why you're here this morning but now I'm talking

our sanctification see praise our God the believer in Christ Now by Grace is overshadowed with the canopy of Life overshadowed The Mercy Seat there there was two terim because cherubims and their wings was tipped and there because a tip Wings because cast a shadow Over The Mercy Seat a shadow of the presence of God over the mercy seat and the mercy seat is in us and the Heavenly Wings is tipped over us in the shadow of his presence we're walking in the shadow of his presence amen nothing can get near you unless he steps back and let something into to you and that's where you needs be Amen to chastise you amen oh praise our God amen amen so therefore knowing that that I will shall rejoice in my trials amen KN that is for me amen and Lord whatever is for me let me have it amen amen praise our God don't uh sink down now could maybe God bring out some things in the natural man that maybe this morning he was doing wrong but he's because if you see it this morning he's chastising you amen take it that way maybe you might have done something wrong you made a mistake he loves you amen praise God Amen he's here tell them to you this morning what is the gifts and give for to bring people to repentance and surrender to God not for my own Glory that you might surrender to the Lord all of you and come to repentance see amen now see this is what is called the righteousness of God by faith which we have right now see now all the Christians down Through the Ages they had because they because they had this see but I'm talking about today now do you follow me now see now our day we have this righteousness by faith we believe these things amen but somehow we want to be clothed over that right and we know it's a season cuz it's our day all right this is our day here this is the day when he and we're going to show forth his Praises so we know that and we believe that we have his righteousness every day we believe though the enemy because give us doubt that we dirty and like this we you're not dirty how can you be dirty he doesn't see you he only sees the blood he doesn't he don't see you because you're flesh he hears the voice of his son they're standing for me father I'm standing for them amen praise God isn't he wonderful amen I'm bragging on Jesus Christ this morning amen praise the Lord now there's got to come a time Revelation 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him to who to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready how by taking that word amen now and to her was granted that she should be array in fine linen clean white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints amen and Jesus Christ told us in Revelation three 18 that we should buy gold and he give us white rment that right and we got to overcome and have our eyes anointed but we're going to sit down with him in our day so therefore it is granted to you he gave it to you you are going to wear this righteousness where it can be seen that's right I got a because of uh something here let me hurry up now cuz I don't want to drag out um on a communion trying to by the Holy Spirit bring this body of people here this morning into a sphere see where we believe this and you got to keep you got to move in here now like I say think of the signs that God has dropped along the way which was just believing the word now if we believe this what I'm going to say is going to take place and let God let it be here amen amen that's that's my prayer open to me the gate right here and pour out in here don't you want that friends we've got to believe this word and it shall come to pass now communion page8 brother Bram speaking we believe that we are in the closing time we believe that God has given us a message it has been ordained of God it has been proven of God it has been shown of God now we must come to him with reverence that's what I'm crying out for this morning see and with love and purity of heart and mind and soul you know that the hour will still arise when right Among Us the holy spirit will speak out as with anas and saf that hour is arriving that's what I'm speaking about this morning you just remember that God's going to dwell among his people that is what he wants to do now so now I'm speaking about this God holy ghost that is to come by the Bible and by God private message and dwell among his people but he's got to find a group that's sold out on that word and waiting and looking for them on expectation see me now knowing what he just did everybody waiting is a public offering of himself the world know it keep still boy God fing to speak out of Heaven am they don't know about it brother see public to the public it's been hidden to us now you know those 40 days there with Peter and them that was hidden the world didn't see that there and neither have they seen what God's been doing with us these past seven years amen see but they're fixing this see it God's going to show he going to manifest it outside while the world be slipping in here to be prayed for when the power of God strikes here amen so therefore the hour is arriving now who is God God is righteousness I'm trying to show you this morning is David said The Headstone is to be United with the bride he said that the headstone is come see now the stone which the builders refuse is become The Headstone of the corner this is the great intelligence this is the Dynamics this is the presence of the son of man Jesus said you pray that you be counted worthy to stand in the presence of the son of man amen now this presence of the son of man is the righteousness I'm speaking about this morning this righteousness I just told you demands that right amen demands obedience to the truth to what truth the seven seal message the word so when he comes into your midst I hope you follow me now he demands it if he don't get he calls it out amen so I'm trying to show you by grace and by love this morning so we know what we're going into hear me this morning this is going to be in New York City the righteousness of God is coming down in the form of the voice of the Resurrection The Holy Ghost himself that's going to dwell among his people as just as he said God wants to dwell among his people now but he couldn't until until he until He restored back the word first the sacrifice in that gate where he put his name at there you'll sacrifice me in the gate of the Lord that has come back already by God's Prophet now cuz Daniel over Day N he had to seal up the the vision and prophecy so therefore the vision the prophetic Vision was hid from the whole world the Seven Seals and the prophet brought out the a prophetic vision and he himself was Vindicated the prophetic vision is a picture of the end time then God is like going into a movies and it's dark in the movies the screen comes on and there you see the movie you follow me now so here we are and this whole thing is a movie out here but there's most of them they don't see the picture cuz they're blind I hope you see this I'm trying to make it plain but you sitting there God has anointed your eyes to see the picture of the end time oh praise God we see the picture we see all the characters the hippies and the and the women in the picture we see it praise God Amen we see all those devils in there everything in the picture as God's Prophet drew it and P across the sky and the Seven Angels come down and show the up there amen we see it our eyes are sitting in the movie watching it Hallelujah and we coming down to the climax in the picture where the hero comes forward and conquers the bad man amen the world has always had that ending but never seem right cuz when you go out in the world that don't happen like that all the time most of the bad guys they always overcome you know that but somehow you want to believe that cuz that's Christ in your heart don't even know it but the good man is coming to throw out the bad man praise our God Amen that's going to happen when that happens and you saw the picture when Christ you see Christ come in there with your eyes you see it then you can go outside in the street of the movie and tell what you saw amen amen now you had to watch the whole movie don't get up and run out sit there and listen and watch the movie is still going on up to this day it's still calling the movie is still going on amen he proved it last week didn't he the movie is still going on see he proved it last week but when the movie is over then you get up you go outside to the world and by wisdom remember what you saw in the movie cuz you can't remember so much you can't remember it so you call back on your spirit to bring it out the holy spirit amen the Holy Spirit the spirit of Prophecy the vision the prophetic Vision has been restored back amen but he also said and afterward I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh in the last days when Christ would come in the first event and down to now and he poured out his Spirit up on the Pentecostal church is that right the Jews but it's still to continue on down to our day amen therefore we see the prophetic Vision the picture and we sitting there watching it but he must pour out his Spirit upon you the spirit that rested on the apostles on the day of Pentecost that set up on them the spirit that could call take the scriptures and put them into place and throw it out like Steven they couldn't stand the wisdom in the spirit by which he spoke praise our God didn't need no notes what for the spirit was there and he knows the word it says here truth has shall spring out of the Earth the seed is up is rip and is mature and righteous and looks down from heaven the voice of the Resurrection looking down waiting for truth to Spring out and when it's up it's righten then righteous comes down and demands obedience to every word praise our God and then it says here righteousness shall go before him and Shall Set us in the way of his steps righteousness shall make steps to walk in for the bride and the bride will walk in every step she won't be out of it the prophet said so she'll say what he said she'll do what he did amen praise our God she'll raise up she'll heal her sick she'll cast out she'll do everything he did she'll be temped by every Point by obedience he overcome to the word to the truth and it was constant in his nature Glory praise God in righteousness shall ye be established Isaiah 54 no oppression listen it is Goan get it we are being separated head now but when that sign strikes March 7 it's showing light from dark you follow me now in Goan there was light for three days Perfection that right and there was Darkness over here see me now so therefore how can you know it there's got to come a time when righteousness must come down and be up you and then when that happens you will know that salvation is come present tense because they those in darkness s a light in Goan and they'll see the light in you and then you'll know and you'll walk in the steps walk in the light it'll be upon you friend it'll be righteousness then righteousness will call out in assembly the bride got because truth has sprung up in the bride she's got it de seed is there amen what a promise see that promise friends praise our God thank you do you see righteousness now amen listen it says that truth and mercy met in the soul that right Christ come forward and when by Mercy through the prophet we receive the truth it met here amen right see it met there then uh because it met it gives us peace we have peace to know that he called us hallelujah and that right see truth come for Seven Seals amen righteousness come forth to bring it and demand it see and then truth Mercy I mean see now truth in the heart and also peace in the heart and mercy in the heart then it says here that uh uh uh peace in the heart knowing that God has called you Malachi for all these things there kisses righteousness amen Psalms 212 kiss the son lest he be angry and tear your part kiss him because embrac the son because pay homage to him and then he said I I'm the son of man I got a message amen the son and it was a bride waiting to kiss the son with peace in her heart praise our God when that light shines on that bride there'll be no more thoughts of Oppression you know why he'll drop the veil over your mind amen no more imagination no more reasoning no more memory no more affection no more conscience the word has become the word the righteousness of God is up on the bride it has been granted for her the time is ready to made herself ready to put on the robe and wear it and then walk in every word that he's laid out we don't know what it is but she going to take a walk and trip it bold Fearless courageous they took a 4H hour walk didn't they up on the moon it's time in trepid to take a 4-Hour walk four is is perfection a walk of perfection amen amen it says here and here as she nears The Headstone becoming more like him through the word who's the word righteousness truth is in the heart righteousness the Holy Spirit up over you the mind of God intelligence demands truth demands obedience to every word now do you see why you can do it cuz it'll be the Holy Ghost amen we today we're being conformed chastised in love because being rain right now but when that light from Goan falls upon you brother BR said there's a son and daughters of God full of the Holy Ghost the token is there oh praise God no more weary no more tired the Holy Ghost is up on you now the dove righteousness the dove has met the lamb truth amen and they walking together kiss the son L he be angry amen see pay harmness to him every day if he raises the dead pay harage to him amen the boy coming here thank God for it amen pay harage to the son thank for every little thing heal people so thank him for it don't let this morning's message pass over your head praise our God so now we see then that pray that you be counter worthy to stand in the presence of the son of man do you know what it is righteousness and do you know what it will do it will demand obedience ience to the truth and it says right here in Psalm 18 yes yes the Lord shall give that which is good and our land our because Malachi for promised that we have received amen uh because shall yield her increase her increase amen praise our God Amen just I'm a teil off now but some I got some promises here that's just too beautiful because to Passover shall yield her increase Isaiah 9:6 see what it says There For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no End Amen so the land the promise is finally going to yield this peace and the government The Authority up on the shoulder and the shoulder is the body and brother Brown told because brother per green he said brother per I'm up on his shoulder and the top of it is the C stor the seventh Peak amen amen so we up on the shoulders friend right with the neck just right in there the head comes right down into and it fits in there like a Capstone and then David says that the headstone is come salvation is come Goan is here and what is Goan for Goan was assigned to Israel that he was with them they I mean they they was in the light they looked out and it was dark out there and they was walking in the light working in the light they was for three whole days perfection in the light amen you see it friends so therefore this spiritual light is coming up on the bride scripture just come to my mind just now Joel uh 2 Joel 2 it says uh this bride here a fire um devour because before them and behind them a flame burneth the land is as a garden of e because before them and behind them a desolate Wilderness that's exactly right right before us is the millennial Kingdom behind us Wilderness amen praise God the appearance of them is as appearance of horses and Horsemen so shall they run like a noise of Chariots on the tops of mountain because shall they leap leap like the noise of a flame of fire that Devour the stubble as a strong people in Bay before their face the people shall be much pain all faces Shall Gather Blackness there it is all the faces out here and doomed out here and there will be the bride radiant light shining forth that something friends they won't break ranks this one that one you know they'll be right in God's order amen they won't thrust one another either they won't they'll stop that you know what I mean well I think and you did see all finished with and they'll fall upon the word every word of righteousness which demands obedience to the truth amen the bride will fall upon the spirit of the word for Hebrews 4:2 will be in the assembling calling out Discerning the thoughts of the heart amen praise are and the bride with that ripen word truth in her she'll fall upon it for this purpose like Ester was she born amen praise our God she can walk in there and the King hold out the scepter pray that you be count worthy to walk in and take the scepter even to half of my kingdom but come in come in open the gate praise our god of righteousness and walk in amen think on our promise this morning friends I got many other things to say here but I'm going close out now you love them praise our God so we see watch the order of the day just in closing here Malachi 4 truth was sent through him to make known the revealed will of God and righteousness the holy spirit that come down see when a message demands obedience to the truth and the prophet told to take every word but Antichrist would come to get you off on one word when Christ demanded every word and that's why we scream out tell you don't listen to these men telling you about nobody can be saved that's against the truth see it now I hope you see it see and Mercy Mercy forgives man of all sin and the prophet had the mercy seat with him to forgive you of all sin which was his message the word see and in that it gives peace and peace kisses righteousness peace with peace in your heart you want God because you're not afraid to come in here to wor that's what you want you want to because Embrace that amen you want to kiss it see then who are those who are fearful to come in what's he going to say this morning now what's is he going to preach on me this morning see fearful ones just moving around little Spirits put the light over it and they run and they fly away that's not the bride no she comes in Humble you know a wheat head you know the bride is humble it's a wheat head that stands up like his here and just sways back and forth bless God you know nothing in there but but if it's got a full ripened head it bends over that right now there's many uh wheat fields and some of them there's no heads in the wheat no because corns in there rather it's just because a Shar there that's all it is nothing inside of it so it stands up straight and it blows in the wind see but the full head of wheat bow humble amen amen so now if you want to see God look at a wheat because among you humble referring a brother never say anything out of turn God bless you Sister because God bless you brother there that's a week bless God I think it's wrong now what they preaching nothing in there it's empty if it knew anything it would know the will of God wouldn't it am it would be humble it would be is shooting his mouth off and so forth see praise our God kiss the son let he be angry amen so now this is our hour here friends I something is in my mind here yeah Hosea that's right because in closing Hosea the 2 chapter I know it was something I want to read to you second chapter now uh uh we have been a betro to the Lord this way now you know at the scriptures is to restore Israel but it's also a spiritual application because to the bride in the scriptures but they didn't know that the old prophets they didn't know that see but God gave this mystery to Paul he knew it so Paul went back and took the Old Testament and pour over here in the new cuz it was for the bride but that was hi see amen so he went to the Old Testament which was the word by Revelation Paul put out the because Doctrine from the Old Testament all a word see but it needs the Holy Ghost wisdom to tell you what it is amen now you got it now now this here is to you the bride Hosea 2:19 and I will betro thee unto me forever yay I will betro thee unto me in righteousness amen and in judgment First Corinthians 4:5 judge nothing until the day he comes which is coming do you see this friends I hope you see this here the Judgment see you will be a patrol to the Lord in judgment and that's coming in righteousness that's coming see where it'll be here in assembly it'll be judgment here it'll be righteousness here but there'll be loving kindness and there'll be mercies here also amen you see it's right here see amen see I will betro thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in loving kindness and in mercies I will even betro thee unto me in faithfulness amen no because no variableness every step faithful to the word amen see and thou shalt know the Lord amen praise our God Thou shalt know the Lord the two will be one now don't miss this now Christ without the bride is not the body somebody GRE to you it's not because see uh Eve come out of Adam's Body so therefore the Lord must be back with his body to be one amen see it's got to be back together again and she's coming in see man she's coming and the spirit of God the righteous will United all they be United together see and it shall come to pass in that day I will hear sayith the Lord I will hear the heavens the heavens now is asking the Lord for rain amen cuz see God controls everything so there therefore because the heavens must ask for rain and they shall hear the Earth and the Earth because they as in the heavens because for the rain Amen brother Ben praise the Lord and the Earth sh because shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil and they shall hear jez which means because restored Israel now therefore the corn the word in his fullness see and the oil the fullness of the Holy Spirit and the stimulation of the Revelation the wine

which is you Thou Art my people and they shall say thou art my God Thou Art my God open to me the gates of righteousness Ephesians 5:25 26 and 27 the Lord watch that loved us and died for us he's going to because because present us to him a glorious Church in righteousness in judgment in Mercy and love and kindness to himself when he comes he doing all himself the word of God do you love him well the whole thought this morning is to get us to come to the Lord to surrender I mean Sinners and God's people alike he's looking for us to repent and to surrender all the way to his word that's been spoken this morning amen so friends I say to you this morning in this day of the Lord's supper tonight that no matter what's in our hearts what we think our thinking see just repent to the Lord and surrender to every word that God has laid out here for us to walk in because just as I sure as I stand in this PP and we sit in these seats here righteousness see what it does in Hosea I think is 10:12 so to yourself in righteousness then it'll come and rain down on because become up on top of you so it's been sown therefore those who have sown righteousness all down through the seven Church ages they have reaped Mercy you understand but there comes a time when he will upon you forming latter R coming over together and teach you which he's been doing amen see and then truth will spring up the seed is right now when truth has sprung up righteousness is looking down the voice of the resurrect looking down now righteousness can come into the assembly because truth is there amen I hope you get it the fullness of the spirit of the Lord couldn't move until the truth was up it couldn't move over to there only gifts but he himself the word is in the bride now he can come and move over the bride and then his righteousness will become steps to walk in she won't move unless she has thust sayith the Lord so therefore she's got to know can no oppression come how can it when she's dwelling in Goan or Redemption sign on the way to the promised land on the way to our day on our way to the Resurrection yes a Prophet come with a message in a pillar of fire is that right and then the next
