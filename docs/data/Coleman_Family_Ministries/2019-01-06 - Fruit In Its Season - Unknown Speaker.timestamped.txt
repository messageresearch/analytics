[0:00] reading from Psalm 1 I'm going to read
[0:05] from the first verse through the third
[0:07] I'm going to read jeremiah 17:7 and
[0:11] eight verses st. Matthew 7 17 through 20
[0:18] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[0:22] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[0:26] in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the
[0:28] seat of the scornful but his delight is
[0:33] in the law of the Lord and in his law
[0:36] doth he meditate day and night and he
[0:40] shall be like a tree planted by the
[0:43] rivers of order that bringing forth his
[0:48] fruit in his season his leaf also shall
[0:53] not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[0:56] prosper Jeremiah 17 chapter the seventh
[1:03] verse will take my time is normal time
[1:07] blessed is the man that trusted in the
[1:10] Lord it's not a blessing we see one
[1:13] blessing is to not to walk in the way of
[1:17] the ungodly and here's another blessing
[1:20] here blessed is the man who trusted in
[1:22] the Lord and whose hope the Lord is
[1:25] faith in God for this man that doesn't
[1:31] stand in the way of the sinners and and
[1:34] also taketh a counsel from the ungodly
[1:36] and who trusts in the Word of God for he
[1:39] shall be like a tree he shall be as a
[1:43] tree planted by the waters that spread
[1:46] it out that spread out her roots by the
[1:48] river and shall not see when he'd come
[1:51] in but her leaf shall be green and shall
[1:56] not be be careful in the air drought
[1:58] neither shall cease from yielding fruit
[2:02] we see that though there's no joy around
[2:05] there's always somebody who will be
[2:07] yielding fruit
[2:08] joy in their souls that's what the
[2:11] scripture says so we just stay with the
[2:15] word amen
[2:17] Matthew seventh chapter 17 verse even so
[2:24] every good tree bringeth forth fruit
[2:29] those that are planted by the rivers of
[2:31] living order that's a good tree bringeth
[2:34] forth fruit neither can a corrupt tree
[2:37] bring forth no I'm reading - but - fancy
[2:41] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[2:43] good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth
[2:46] forth evil fruit a good tree cannot
[2:50] bring forth evil fruit neither can a
[2:53] corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
[2:56] every tree that bringeth not forth good
[3:00] fruit is hewn down and cast into the
[3:04] fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall
[3:08] know them may a loyal blessing to the
[3:10] reading of this word so we can see from
[3:14] the choice of scriptures no matter what
[3:16] man says today no matter what man is
[3:19] doing because how hard it is and the
[3:22] devil said this and the devil said that
[3:23] and I ain't got no joy and the law don't
[3:26] bless me
[3:26] the Bible says our good fruit I mean a
[3:29] good tree will bring forth good fruit a
[3:33] good tree will just bear the fruit well
[3:37] he hasn't got anything because to do
[3:40] with it for his coming from the inside
[3:43] out it's in the roots it's the life and
[3:47] the roots and the Word of God declares
[3:51] that my word shall go out and it shall
[3:54] not return to me void but it will it
[3:57] shall accomplish that in the thing that
[4:00] I sent it into it will prosper when I
[4:03] send my word that see that tree that
[4:07] person will prosper so we find out that
[4:11] what we are looking for in this hour is
[4:14] a life you must see a life and the life
[4:18] is the fruit flavors the apple tree
[4:21] is life down in that apple tree that's
[4:24] going to produce apples so if you see
[4:27] the trees and well what kind is it when
[4:29] you see the Apple he said that's the
[4:31] apple tree and if we are lacking on two
[4:35] trees and we're supposed to be
[4:37] Christians loving one another and by
[4:41] their fruits you shall know them see if
[4:45] they are complain us evil speaking and
[4:49] so forth by their fruits you shall know
[4:52] them
[4:53] Amon that's God's Word and God just
[4:58] doesn't because because put is worried
[5:00] out here and just leave it no sir for
[5:03] Jeremiah says great in council mighty in
[5:07] work for then our eyes are open upon all
[5:10] the ways of the sons of men to everyone
[5:14] according to his ways and according to
[5:17] the fruit of his doings so they all
[5:21] mighty God in your secret councils over
[5:25] in your homes where you gather with the
[5:29] friends that finest level around you
[5:32] seem to me now all the trees gather
[5:35] together it does apple trees is all
[5:37] apple trees if there's bramble bushes
[5:40] and figs and so forth that's the kind of
[5:42] trees there is so therefore you can't
[5:45] get grapes because because I'm a victory
[5:47] and if certain kinds of trees are
[5:50] gathered together if if they are getting
[5:54] together when if they have love that
[5:57] love will be evident in their myths but
[6:00] if they gather together with jealousy
[6:03] evil speaking about their brothers and
[6:06] the passes and so forth that's the kind
[6:09] of tree it is it's a corrupt tree
[6:12] nothing good can come from it
[6:15] for its roots or Christ it's nothing in
[6:19] it so therefore no matter what they say
[6:22] they believe the message that doesn't
[6:25] mean one thing no siree by their fruits
[6:28] you shall know the Bible says amen
[6:33] so we see God is watching over us to
[6:38] give every man according to his ways and
[6:42] according to the fruit the length the
[6:46] effect of his doings amen of his works
[6:51] so therefore whatever works you have
[6:53] whatever comes out of your mouth your
[6:54] heart or whatever it is God will
[6:56] recompense you for that
[6:58] that's your fruit you can't bring forth
[7:01] anything else
[7:01] see so because Solomon said in the book
[7:06] of progress he said the fruit of the
[7:10] righteous is a tree of life amen hey
[7:16] Solomon said the fruit the doings of the
[7:21] righteous is a tree of life John the
[7:25] Baptist said when when he come on a
[7:27] scene with a message anointing with the
[7:30] spirit Elijah and we're looking for the
[7:32] spirit of Elijah to come on the scene
[7:34] once more and bring up methods also John
[7:38] came with a powerful message to all the
[7:41] pharisees sadducees and so forth and
[7:43] they all they were supposed to be sweet
[7:46] and kind old priests but he told them
[7:49] that he told them to bring forth fruits
[7:52] meet for repentance no matter if you
[7:57] have Abraham - father that's all right
[7:59] but when you hear the word now see when
[8:04] you hear the word for this age then if
[8:07] you receive that word believe on him
[8:10] that is sent that will be the fruit by
[8:13] their fruits you shall know them then
[8:16] when the word comes for that age it is
[8:19] going to produce the effects for that
[8:21] age the fruitful adage then if these
[8:23] apheresis
[8:25] also Sadducees no matter how sweet they
[8:28] were if they had received John the
[8:30] Baptist message they would have produced
[8:33] brought forth bring forth other words if
[8:37] the seed of God is in you you will bring
[8:41] forth out of you for if you see if you
[8:44] see a tree because in the winter time
[8:47] all you see is that Trina limbs but if
[8:50] there's a seat of an apple plant it deep
[8:53] down in the roots in the springtime it
[8:56] will bring forth and you'll see them
[8:59] amen
[9:00] so when the word came with John the
[9:03] Baptist if they had the seed of God down
[9:07] in the roots in there when the word was
[9:10] spoken it would have brought forth the
[9:13] life
[9:13] that was supposed to be in that tree
[9:16] amen in that man so we find bring forth
[9:21] fruits meat for a pet because because
[9:24] for repentance other words John the
[9:27] Bethel was saying bring forth fruit that
[9:31] is consistent with repentance it's a
[9:35] little different
[9:36] amen other words he's saying let your
[9:40] lives prove your change of heart
[9:43] prove it see me now you say I repent
[9:47] prove it
[9:48] let your life prove it by the fruits you
[9:51] shall know them you could come up here
[9:54] so I repent brother but if you still go
[9:56] I won't shake my hand are you still
[9:59] talking against me sitting in there if
[10:01] you still speak in railing accusations
[10:04] against me by the fruits you shall know
[10:07] them bringing forth fruits meat on to
[10:11] repentance then you have not repented
[10:14] it's very plain so we find in that if
[10:18] it's a good tree see a good tree cannot
[10:22] impassable less God is alive but God
[10:26] said our good tree cannot bring forth
[10:29] evil fruit can saltwater and sweet water
[10:34] come from the same fountain no Serena
[10:37] can you curse somebody this assembly
[10:40] here and say sweet things about him also
[10:42] no sir
[10:44] if you do it you a hypocrite right I
[10:48] make it plain this morning by their
[10:50] fruits you shall know for this is the
[10:54] age when God is shining the light into
[10:58] the dark corners into the dark hole we
[11:01] don't worry about it if we see mumbling
[11:04] over there and also burning over there
[11:06] in the darkness shining upon it expose
[11:10] that thing bring it out bring out those
[11:13] secret things back there coracles names
[11:16] and put them out in the front so Aramaic
[11:18] is he look at what comes in the heart
[11:19] there put them right up on it the light
[11:22] of God's Word amen he's put no matter
[11:25] what they say put the light of God up on
[11:28] those trees amen so we find them that by
[11:35] their fruits you shall know them
[11:37] a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[11:39] fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring
[11:43] forth good fruit but they'll all grove
[11:45] together but he's coming now to separate
[11:48] them see so we find in that what is
[11:53] fruit there's D D fruit of faith if you
[11:57] believe this message you will produce
[11:59] certain things it's the fruit of
[12:02] repentance if you really and truly
[12:04] repent if we'll go back and read David
[12:08] and you want to yeah I think I saw
[12:10] because I'm 51 you read when somebody if
[12:14] they really repent what they do they
[12:16] just don't say I repent brother oh no
[12:19] that's no repentance that's what you
[12:21] what you call because Pentecostal
[12:23] repentance but that's not true rugged
[12:26] Christian repentance
[12:28] No so therefore the day all we can do is
[12:31] just receive that's all we can do we
[12:32] can't just nobody if you say that you
[12:35] have repented fine with me
[12:37] he is watching your doings a man he's
[12:40] watching your doings he's watching the
[12:43] fruit of your doings
[12:45] he's watch it has a search another seven
[12:49] spirit all over the earth they're
[12:50] watching you watching it - not when you
[12:52] hear when you go downstairs what you say
[12:55] down there when you go home to the Bronx
[12:58] Jersey Brooklyn whether you go it in
[13:01] your dark secret corners that's where
[13:04] the eyes search out and mark it down for
[13:07] you mark it down for you you'll be
[13:09] recompense when he comes up on earth you
[13:12] get it all back so all we can do here is
[13:15] to preach the word to stretch you out in
[13:17] here to smooth that's all we can do
[13:19] Amen so the fruit we are speaking about
[13:22] of the spirit love and peace and joy and
[13:25] temperance if we have passed from death
[13:28] unto life we have fruit to prove it
[13:30] that's in the Bible no matter how much
[13:34] the palm ornament and locusts have eaten
[13:35] off of God's tree there is still
[13:38] something about those that are the
[13:41] prettiest native seeds of God they have
[13:43] something there for one for the other
[13:45] imma prove this one about scriptures
[13:47] there is something there so how can we
[13:51] prosper and also have fruit in our
[13:54] season this most difficult time this is
[13:57] the hardest time they have fruit because
[14:00] Satan is right in here this is the way
[14:04] it comes in see if you wanna know if
[14:06] it's a work of God you find a devil
[14:09] Satan it with all his fury raging all
[14:12] through this assembly here but we know
[14:15] that and therefore we rejoice in that
[14:18] then we fall into divers temptations
[14:20] well we know that God is with us he's
[14:24] I'll help you in that day amen
[14:26] so we'd says we just go on and let God
[14:29] search him out and do the work that's
[14:32] all we can do
[14:32] so how can we bring forth this fruit
[14:36] here's how blessed is the man that
[14:39] walketh not in the counsel of the
[14:41] ungodly
[14:42] now walk is your manner of life see
[14:47] that's your man of life if you don't
[14:49] stand around with the ungodly because in
[14:53] their counsel if you stand there with
[14:55] them pretty soon you shall sit down
[14:57] amen and the seat of the scornful you
[15:00] stand around long enough with the
[15:01] ungodly you'll sit down with him amen
[15:04] and next thing we find then that he said
[15:10] blessed is a man that trusted in the
[15:12] Lord so we find that we have to have
[15:16] faith in this word though all around us
[15:20] we don't feel anything and there's a
[15:22] spirit against you with is trying to
[15:25] make you not love your brother and it's
[15:28] a spirit that is trying to make you talk
[15:30] against your brother see me now but just
[15:34] for this age God knows what he's doing
[15:37] he has put his word right here for this
[15:41] age right now the mechanics of the word
[15:44] see so in for as believe us has fake
[15:48] faint thoughts that's all you can do
[15:51] therefore if you want to prove it in the
[15:54] Old Testament they didn't not have the
[15:57] Holy Ghost yet they have a testimony in
[16:00] the book of Hebrews 11 amen they have a
[16:04] testimony there they was sauna Thunder
[16:06] hunting caves and Den's and so forth but
[16:09] they held on they were seized of God
[16:11] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[16:13] amen they have a testimony so don't tell
[16:18] me I don't have the Holy Spirit if you
[16:20] are the seed of God you
[16:23] we do what is recorded in you if you are
[16:26] a good tree you bring forth the fruit
[16:28] that God has ordained for you to bring
[16:30] forth in his proper season in this
[16:34] season right now he knows that many
[16:37] don't had the better than Holy Ghost
[16:38] neither did Peter know they were
[16:40] persecuted but they were together before
[16:43] they received the Holy Ghost and they
[16:46] loved one another they were friends one
[16:48] to the other they did not have the Holy
[16:51] Ghost but they had received the words of
[16:53] God amen
[16:55] so therefore this morning if you feel
[16:58] that evil be spread upon you if you will
[17:02] receive the word and resist the devil
[17:04] for it's written he will flee from you
[17:07] cuz God can I if you give in to it it
[17:11] proves what kind of seed is there see
[17:14] sure look how she does it so we find
[17:18] that Jesus Christ said and Saint John 15
[17:21] uh okay you don't have to get it I just
[17:25] thought it because block you off from
[17:26] well trying to say I'll just read it out
[17:28] we just just take our time this morning
[17:31] amen we want to find out a few things
[17:34] this morning st. John 13:34 a new
[17:39] commandment I give unto you that ye love
[17:41] one another as I have loved you that ye
[17:46] also love one another notice now by this
[17:49] love see by this shall all men know that
[17:52] ye are my disciples if you have love one
[17:56] for the other
[17:56] amen there's a test see so what is it
[18:01] and love is God
[18:04] Jesus Christ the word is a great big
[18:07] bundle of love that's what he is
[18:10] he is the word so then we find with all
[18:14] the storms of doubt see all around us if
[18:17] we can reach out and grab hold of at
[18:19] apples the word and tie ourselves to
[18:23] that word in no matter what happens God
[18:27] he'll hold on to you
[18:29] he will take though you stumble and
[18:31] you're walking here reached out and
[18:32] cup your hands he'll eat you the way his
[18:35] word is the lamp unto your feet in this
[18:37] darkness now he'll help you when you
[18:40] don't have any strength at all he'll
[18:41] help you so therefore we find in Saint
[18:45] John 15 he's speaking here these things
[18:49] have I spoken unto you in the eleventh
[18:53] verse that my joy might remain in you
[18:56] you don't have any joy my joy might
[19:01] remain in you what he said no these
[19:04] things have I spoken unto you they did
[19:07] not have the Holy Ghost that my joy
[19:10] might remain in you then your joy it
[19:13] might be full amen you should be so
[19:17] happy this morning knowing that we're
[19:20] seem to take a flight
[19:22] so you believe this ungodly word you
[19:25] don't have no joy this morning what kind
[19:29] of tree are you this morning
[19:30] huh look around tree are you what are
[19:33] you looking down for look up for your
[19:35] redemption I'm full of joy this morning
[19:38] to know that by the grace of Almighty
[19:41] God he reached down to pluck me up from
[19:44] all this filth and sin and unbelief out
[19:46] here he chose me amen hey you don't have
[19:51] no joy man about this man about that
[19:54] evil about this speaking really
[19:56] accusations all the time what kind of
[19:59] tree are you what kind of tree are you
[20:02] amen praise God
[20:04] amen brother so we find this is my
[20:10] commandment that you love one another as
[20:13] I have loved you greater love hath no
[20:16] man than this that a man lay down his
[20:19] life for his friends
[20:21] ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I
[20:26] command you now notice the love of God
[20:30] he laid down his life he stripped
[20:35] himself of his royal roles he stripped
[20:39] himself and made himself of no
[20:41] reputation
[20:43] and laid down his life for us he wants
[20:48] the same word in us that we may lay down
[20:52] our lives for our friends see he said
[20:56] you are my friends if you do if you do
[20:59] what sort of our mention henceforth I
[21:02] call you now servants for the servant
[21:04] knoweth not what is Lord do it but I
[21:08] have called you friends for all things
[21:10] that I've heard of my father I have made
[21:13] known unto you can you imagine every all
[21:16] the thoughts in God's mind the things
[21:19] his nature Christ revealed his nature to
[21:23] his disciples and was ready at this time
[21:27] getting ready to lay down his life for
[21:29] them to prove it amen
[21:31] say bring forth fruits meat he was ready
[21:35] to prove it to bring it forth see at
[21:38] this time ye have not chosen me but I
[21:43] have chosen you and ordained you that
[21:46] you should go and bring forth it's bring
[21:48] forth fruit and that your fruit should
[21:50] remain that whatsoever ye shall ask the
[21:53] Father in my name he may give it to you
[21:56] these things I command you that you love
[21:59] one another now how should we be in here
[22:03] all the little seeds of God loving one
[22:06] another amen
[22:08] the Bible says by this you'll know that
[22:13] you are my disciples by the fruits you
[22:16] shall know them that's exactly what it
[22:19] says no Bible so we find that love one
[22:23] another as Jesus loves us he loved us so
[22:27] much and he laid down his life for us
[22:29] can we say the same thing one for the
[22:33] other in here can we say that see well
[22:37] the bride is gonna say that the bride
[22:39] will say that whoever she is even now
[22:43] for the bride will do that some will
[22:46] have to do that then we want to see a
[22:48] great separation we'll see the bride
[22:51] bring forth fruits meat unto unto
[22:54] repentance when the Elijah says repent
[22:57] the bride will bring that forth for she
[22:59] have an inner to come forth it's there
[23:02] it's a good tree it'll bring forth the
[23:04] good fruit amen
[23:07] so he laid down his life for us and
[23:09] revealed his nature to his disciples as
[23:12] his friends Jesus right now is he is now
[23:17] revealing his nature to us through the
[23:19] seven seals through all the mysteries
[23:22] amen he's revealed it to us given us and
[23:26] he revealed to us and he's soon coming
[23:28] now to open our understanding to this
[23:31] that we may do the work of God
[23:34] see he's revealing it now this is that
[23:37] over there and that's that over there
[23:39] and we say my I was tagging around right
[23:42] now trying to understand this these
[23:43] things but he's coming to give you the
[23:45] understanding upon it in the
[23:47] resurrection power of the dynamics of
[23:50] Christ will open up I understand to all
[23:53] these things so we see that not many had
[23:56] been called the Friends of God Abraham
[23:59] John was and also disciples will call
[24:02] the Friends of Jesus Christ so therefore
[24:05] we are striving today to be called his
[24:08] friend for he has revealed his nature to
[24:11] us how we should be all disciples have
[24:15] loved one for the other so we find them
[24:18] that today the love of many has next
[24:21] and where there is a spark of love
[24:24] that's where you find the enemy trying
[24:28] to tear down all right wear it because
[24:31] writing this out right now is the inter
[24:33] let chill message going forth now God's
[24:37] prophet is cool as a cucumber
[24:40] he's walking among all the confusion
[24:42] smiling not saying a word knowing that
[24:45] they have to do what they have to do
[24:47] what have you do do quickly see if they
[24:51] stay with the word they are staying with
[24:53] the word they have been blessed that's
[24:55] that's a good tree so therefore Benny
[24:59] now all around God's prophet he can't do
[25:03] anything for it's a predestination he
[25:06] know that if the seed is laying there
[25:08] the Holy Spirit is soon coming to pick
[25:11] up these seats and also put him together
[25:12] in a strong chain know which is the word
[25:16] he knows that so he can't do anything he
[25:18] just goes hit preaches a message if the
[25:21] man is called of God he'll preach what
[25:23] the word says what it says in the Bible
[25:26] that's all he can do so we find that we
[25:30] can only have love then through the tap
[25:34] holes the word for sin here we can only
[25:38] have it through this it that's all we
[25:40] hear we on a certain level here because
[25:42] we come here for the word we have the
[25:45] word in common here amen we are supposed
[25:48] to be seeds of God and if we have the
[25:52] word we are supposed to be bringing
[25:54] forth fruits meat on to repentance John
[25:57] the Baptist told him to change their
[25:59] lives before they received the Holy
[26:01] Ghost amen oh yes he said bring forth
[26:06] now fruits meat unto repentance repent
[26:09] and turn around from the works of
[26:12] darkness so we find them that we can
[26:16] only have love because through god's
[26:19] word the word ties us together let us
[26:22] have a little example of love in the
[26:24] Bible turn to 1st Samuel the eighteenth
[26:26] chapter we have an example of the love
[26:29] of God in the Bible here to me is a
[26:32] beautiful example it's one of the
[26:34] greatest friendships in the Bible
[26:36] Jonathan and David beautiful true
[26:40] friendship so we like to look at this
[26:45] little example of love for about five
[26:46] ten minutes
[26:47] amen please go first samuel to 18th
[26:51] chapter and it came to pass when he had
[26:54] made an end of speaking unto Saul that
[26:57] the soul of Jonathan notice now the soul
[27:00] of Jonathan was knit knit knit with the
[27:06] soul of David and Jonathan loved him as
[27:10] his own soul then we have a type of the
[27:15] love that I'm trying to express to you
[27:17] this morning through the Word of God
[27:19] that's what I'm trying to talk about
[27:21] this morning so we find then from this
[27:23] beautiful friendship here
[27:26] what was this friendship based on what
[27:30] was Jesus Christ friendship with Abraham
[27:33] John the Baptist his disciples what was
[27:35] that based on you find that Jonathan and
[27:38] David frigate was based on the same
[27:41] thing so we see it now so we find out
[27:45] the first thing zette the friendship
[27:48] must be based on his trust that's the
[27:51] first thing faith in one another
[27:55] confidence in one another if you come at
[27:59] this and send me here and you don't have
[28:00] faith and trust and Brotherhood myself
[28:03] as these two pastors here then there is
[28:06] no friendship there is no faith
[28:08] whatsoever so you don't trust us you
[28:11] have no faith in us you have no
[28:13] confidence in us amen
[28:15] then you know how to be in common see so
[28:19] we find in that true friendship is
[28:22] founded on faith is the fact is the
[28:26] foundation there now notice now David
[28:30] could not trust Saul ah Saul was a child
[28:36] of God slept with his father's he was
[28:39] annoyed of the Lord but David could not
[28:42] trust Saul why we find out but David
[28:47] could trust you
[28:48] the Bible says that their souls was knit
[28:51] together so we find in the first thing
[28:56] that you must have is trust faith in one
[28:59] another that's your foundation the next
[29:02] thing you have is sacrifice Christ did
[29:05] it he sacrificed himself for his friends
[29:07] he laid down his life amen
[29:10] well because look at Jonathan he was
[29:13] heir apparent to the throne of Saul
[29:16] he was a mighty warrior Jonathan was all
[29:19] right he was a fine handsome man but
[29:23] something happened when he met David
[29:26] here was a king son a warrior of great
[29:30] renown heir to the throne of God see
[29:34] well when he met David something in the
[29:37] heart went out to him just like oh just
[29:41] like Mary Elizabeth sons amen but
[29:44] because of an amen a witness went out
[29:46] see it's something that you can't
[29:48] explain but it's there something that
[29:51] won't be knit together because I because
[29:54] invisible you won't see it but it's
[29:55] there it's right there just like you
[29:58] can't see the life in that tree it's
[30:01] waiting on the roofs but it'll produce a
[30:03] certain kind of fruit so Jonathan was
[30:09] heir to the throne mighty warrior but
[30:12] when he met David when he met David and
[30:16] saw Davis courage against the great
[30:19] Goliath and his modesty see in his love
[30:23] and his faith in the word of God how
[30:27] dare uncircumcised philistine did find a
[30:30] living honors of God for God way back in
[30:33] Deuteronomy he had declared when you go
[30:35] into warfare
[30:36] I will fight your battles David was the
[30:38] only one who remembered them therefore
[30:43] he trusted in the Word of God
[30:46] David meditated day and night God said I
[30:50] will be with you I will fight your
[30:52] battles so there David went to fight the
[30:56] bellows and so Jonathan saw them
[31:00] Jonathan was a mighty preacher warrior
[31:03] for the Lord but he saw David and he saw
[31:07] something in David what did he see
[31:10] he saw that David was called of God see
[31:14] David was a sheep herder he was called
[31:17] as a sheep herder David was anointed to
[31:21] fight the battles and then David was
[31:23] placed as a king in the throne sea so
[31:27] you have to go through all that just let
[31:29] just let God's prophet he was called as
[31:31] a pastor and ship it then he's been
[31:34] annoying all these years he's getting
[31:37] ready to be placed as Elijah
[31:39] Eamon he's been through all the battles
[31:41] now God's gonna place him out there so
[31:44] we find in that when Jonathan saw David
[31:48] the first thing that Jonathan did he
[31:51] stripped himself
[31:54] let's read it right here and the second
[31:59] verse and Saul took him that day and
[32:01] wouldn't let him go no more home because
[32:04] his father's house then Jonathan David
[32:06] made a covenant because he loved him as
[32:09] his own soul and Jonathan stripped
[32:11] himself of the robe that because upon
[32:15] him and gave it to David and his
[32:17] garments even to his sword and also to
[32:20] his bone and also because to his girdle
[32:23] so we find in that Christ stripped
[32:26] himself of all that he had for his
[32:29] friends amen
[32:31] Jonathan stripped himself of all that he
[32:34] had he was a great warrior king son but
[32:37] he stripped himself for his friend he
[32:40] brought forth fruits meet you saw that
[32:43] he did it you saw him and you knew it
[32:45] see so we find in Jonathan was ready to
[32:49] lay down his life for David and he did
[32:52] it too because he fought in the battles
[32:54] and so forth so we find that he was
[32:57] ready to lay down his life at the risk
[33:00] of his own life
[33:01] lay it down for him so then we find out
[33:04] what is the true meaning of a friend a
[33:06] friend seeks his friends welfare
[33:10] see if we are the same seed here you are
[33:13] continually praying for me seeking my
[33:15] welfare not your own because self-will
[33:19] is unbelief seek my welfare I will seek
[33:22] your welfare that's what you're supposed
[33:25] to be doing seeking my welfare not
[33:28] talking against me save me now seeking
[33:32] my welfare all the time but why could he
[33:35] seek Davis welfare because they had a
[33:38] foundation the Word of God this holes
[33:41] was knit together therefore they had a
[33:44] spiritual quality about their friendship
[33:47] then they had a meeting of the mind to
[33:50] mine they meant soul the soul spirit the
[33:53] spirit they had a mutual Amite
[33:57] relationship every seat at his own kind
[34:01] see their relationship was not it was
[34:04] not caught no siree here was a king's
[34:07] son and a shepherd boy there was no
[34:10] walls between them a king's son and a
[34:14] shepherd boy at the picture now and
[34:17] Christ
[34:18] bar no free Jew nor Greek doesn't matter
[34:23] Christ in Christ now cry because David
[34:26] and also Jonathan was together they was
[34:29] in Christ same spirit whether he was a
[34:32] king's son or whether he was a shepherd
[34:33] boy had made no difference to Jonathan
[34:36] and today if we are supposed to be in
[34:40] Christ it should make no difference what
[34:43] a man looks like or where he comes from
[34:45] it should make no difference whatsoever
[34:49] for if we are the trees of God we all
[34:53] clap my hands when we all receive the
[34:55] ring we all bring forth the same kind of
[34:58] fruit after its kind Amen if we need
[35:02] some Jonathan Davis today so we find him
[35:06] that how was this possible it's possible
[35:09] because the Bible says that the soul of
[35:12] Jonathan was knit with the soul of David
[35:15] that time it was joined together it was
[35:18] worn mine heart sold one see and we had
[35:23] here to come
[35:24] or seeking each other's welfare the Holy
[35:28] Spirit because a charity sneaking out at
[35:31] home does not bought itself no uh-uh
[35:34] it doesn't secrets on see it's looking
[35:37] out one for the other
[35:38] because Christ did then that's Christ so
[35:41] we find in that we can only have this
[35:45] beautiful fellowship define with crimes
[35:49] only as we are knit together
[35:52] our souls are knit together now just a
[35:55] minute now
[35:56] God spoke back there don't put wallet
[35:59] linen together
[36:00] don't mix it together no surgery you
[36:03] cannot knit together one minute
[36:05] separated see only after its current
[36:08] mush you knit together so you find in
[36:11] that that you knit things together that
[36:14] are the same kind things that are the
[36:17] same substance and also fiber and
[36:19] texture strength and endurance you knit
[36:22] those together so we find then that you
[36:26] will knit a thread to a kindred thread
[36:29] they three full thread two or three four
[36:32] three amen a chain of iron two chain of
[36:35] mine a chain of gold to a chain of gold
[36:39] you don't mix it see you knit those
[36:41] things together and it'll be the same
[36:44] size and strength and beauty and also
[36:47] purity this goal will be so then
[36:50] Jonathan's soul was a chain of gold of
[36:53] the same size and also Beauty as David
[36:57] soul was then that was knit together and
[37:00] that was one they will one see and so
[37:05] and also how could you know Jonathan he
[37:10] humbled himself to a shepherd boy he was
[37:14] a king son that's how you knew he was
[37:16] humble he was a great warrior he was a
[37:19] mighty preacher too and also he had
[37:21] proved himself but he humbled himself
[37:23] down because of David in other words he
[37:27] had mutual esteem see if a man think
[37:31] himself something and thinks that he's a
[37:33] great preacher and all those brothers
[37:35] nothing there's nothing new to
[37:37] but at all if you don't think I'm
[37:40] anything at all then can any two walk
[37:42] together except they be agreed you can't
[37:45] walk together no siree so we find it
[37:49] must be are in one another
[37:52] goodwill affection and most of all
[37:54] loyalty now a loyalty fine
[37:58] loyalty today plus almost the curse way
[38:02] if somebody here want to be loyal right
[38:05] here to the pastor's you'll get blasted
[38:07] for it today is something right surely
[38:11] will any assembly any awareness message
[38:14] if you try to be loyal loyalty no right
[38:18] there and Tucson alone is about nine
[38:20] different variations of the message
[38:22] that's right so we find in that in this
[38:27] mutual friendship here esteem one for
[38:30] the other the basis of it Jonathan kept
[38:34] back no secrets from David Heyman even
[38:40] David kept back no secrets because from
[38:44] because from Jonathan
[38:47] in other words David because he was a
[38:50] shepherd Jonathan let him know what was
[38:53] going on sing so he told David of Saul's
[38:59] plans to kill him Amen Jesus told his
[39:04] friends of Satan's plans to kill them
[39:09] they shall deliver up to the synagogue's
[39:12] they shall persecute you from Sega's
[39:14] city house can you know if you have a
[39:16] friend he'll tell you amen he'll let you
[39:20] know what the enemy is speaking trying
[39:22] to kill you but words all the day long
[39:25] does a friend don't ever feel convicted
[39:28] if you hear somebody speaking evil
[39:30] against somebody if you have person's
[39:32] friend because you let them know and you
[39:34] pray for that evil person see you now
[39:36] don't ever feel convicted about that
[39:39] don't let the devil tell you that your
[39:42] snitches cuz today if Jonathan was in
[39:45] this church today he would be called a
[39:48] snitch
[39:50] call her and so going back and
[39:53] telling past two days it
[39:54] what evils saw his brother was trying to
[39:57] do to him
[39:58] come on you know talking about and hope
[40:01] is planing you know exactly what I'm
[40:04] talking about
[40:05] amen so we find Jonathan would be called
[40:11] a rat you rat Jonathan why did you go
[40:13] and tell David what Saul said about him
[40:17] why he's trying to kill him today James
[40:20] said you had told to rose and Delta rest
[40:22] instead right you kill them with your
[40:24] words that's right
[40:27] you kill them with your words see what
[40:30] kind of friend is that what a fellowship
[40:32] with a friend Devine what a friend what
[40:35] a fellowship divine amen
[40:37] so we find that is impossible for that
[40:42] to come forth from a good tree see cuz
[40:46] Jesus said a good tree cannot bring
[40:49] forth that kind of fruit it is
[40:51] impossible for my word I predict my
[40:55] where to go into good soil and it'll
[40:57] bring forth fruit thirty sixty a hundred
[41:00] and his season it will come forth but
[41:03] evil speaking and railing accusation
[41:06] come from corrupt trees amen from
[41:11] corrupt trees their evil man jealous
[41:16] envious of what God is doing is cut to
[41:19] be legal spirits and moon-goddess bid
[41:22] him to curse you why he has a law Saint
[41:26] John 15 I'll purge you by an evil
[41:29] spirits they'll keep on pressing you
[41:31] down in prayer ho God why they keep
[41:32] doing that don't they know the word
[41:35] they're supposed to do that because let
[41:37] him alone let go and do it
[41:39] the day is coming the lifetime a shine
[41:41] upon call them out there the guardia
[41:43] feet first that's right so I'm speaking
[41:47] to the good trees this morning the
[41:49] Warriors who love to hear the word
[41:51] flowing from the throne of God the war
[41:54] is that a predestinated to take that
[41:56] word of God and bring forth fruit me
[41:59] repentance I'm sticking to you this
[42:01] morning the rest of you sit there I'm
[42:04] speaking to the seeds of God why am i
[42:06] speaking this way for Elijah is soon to
[42:09] come forth and I want a testimony Lord
[42:11] God I want them I told them when Elijah
[42:14] comes forth and speaks clean see told
[42:17] you thank you
[42:18] so therefore we find that a poor old
[42:22] loyal Jonathan knit to the soul of David
[42:25] whether you call a rap today a snitcher
[42:28] because he would tell his friend what
[42:31] the enemy was gonna do to him Saul
[42:34] anoint of God if you notice Saul before
[42:36] he could even be used by God God gave
[42:39] him a new heart before he had anybody to
[42:42] even follow him he had to change their
[42:44] hearts also let you know something right
[42:47] there that whoever want to follow who
[42:49] God's got to put them together God had
[42:51] to give Saul a new heart it's in the
[42:53] word and I'll show it to you maybe
[42:55] something we couldn't believe that there
[42:57] but it's right here amen
[43:01] praise the Lord so we find Saul anointed
[43:11] king oh and first time you attend the
[43:18] ninth verse and it was sold that when he
[43:21] had turned his back to go from Samuel
[43:23] God gave him another heart and all those
[43:26] signs came to pass that day 26 verse and
[43:30] Saul also went home to Gilbert and then
[43:33] went with him
[43:34] a band of men whose hearts God had
[43:37] touched amen God must touch your heart
[43:41] to go with anybody it's got to do that
[43:44] it's got Revere to you Jimmy now then
[43:48] when after that was one age of God Saul
[43:51] was that was one time but when God moved
[43:54] on on down to David fewer men because
[43:58] women David God had to gather together
[44:01] 400 there who was distressed and
[44:04] dissatisfied with their lot in the land
[44:06] they follow David but God had to touch
[44:08] them that they may follow David for
[44:11] doing that time
[44:12] he was anointed Saul his brother
[44:15] and notice how David loves song touch
[44:19] not mine anointed and do my prophet no
[44:22] harm when Saul was evil when the
[44:25] presence of God would when the evil
[44:27] spirit would move up on Saul he took a
[44:30] jabber and threw it at him three times
[44:33] try to kill him so we have Saul's today
[44:37] they have gentleman's darts and they're
[44:40] throwing at you but your signs to them
[44:43] just by faith which they alternate
[44:49] behind your backs
[44:50] talking about you dig it into you it
[44:52] because javelins it's the girl into you
[44:54] see but God the hand of God is up on you
[44:58] you just move on alone but Saul feared
[45:01] David wise for the card it was with
[45:03] David nothing that they could see
[45:06] nothing that they could do against David
[45:09] God was still with him
[45:11] why was that because they couldn't
[45:14] understand God because God doesn't calm
[45:19] in a card demands way see but the Lord
[45:22] said unto Samuel look not a look at his
[45:24] countenance on the height of a statue
[45:27] because I had refused and for the Lord
[45:29] see if not as a man cr4 man look at on
[45:32] an outward appearance but the Lord look
[45:35] at on heart sing so therefore no matter
[45:38] how powerful and big and smart you may
[45:41] think somebody is or who should do what
[45:43] in here seeing me now God looketh on the
[45:46] heart and that's where God looks in that
[45:49] heart you see me now so we find today in
[45:53] this hour now that Brad is all torn up
[45:57] there's many souls
[45:59] there's many Davis they all have eternal
[46:02] life we don't we don't go into that will
[46:05] either with God but you find when this
[46:08] book of the seven tears come out you're
[46:10] gonna find a lot of people who followed
[46:12] the message now here's one that God's
[46:15] prophet has preached and their mystic
[46:17] the Pentecostals is a type of Israel
[46:21] Kannada wilderness and and dying on the
[46:23] ones because about forty years
[46:26] 1906 to 1946 is 40 years Sarah but now
[46:32] after that God's animals is also william
[46:35] branham
[46:36] amen and he took out some people out in
[46:39] the wilderness - and it's still out
[46:41] there
[46:42] so he's talking to them but they don't
[46:44] know it they saw the pillar of fire they
[46:47] others didn't see it because when the
[46:49] Holy Spirit fell back in 1906 in about
[46:52] three years it was all dried up through
[46:54] that because the nomination and they had
[46:56] tomes and so forth that's all he saw but
[46:59] who saw the pillar of fire after 46 come
[47:03] on now
[47:04] where was the dead in the message who
[47:08] saw the great signs wonders and miracles
[47:10] the dead raised again the blind seen the
[47:14] lame walking who saw that those that
[47:16] followed the pillow fire since 1947 they
[47:20] saw that but to adjust to Joseph Mikayla
[47:26] went passed over crossed over what
[47:29] happened to mighty Aaron and Miriam what
[47:32] happened to them dead
[47:33] the Bible says did on the Aaron now he
[47:38] was a prophet all right
[47:40] he had many wonderful works did all kind
[47:43] of things was Darren in Egypt but he
[47:46] come against God's prophet I guess that
[47:48] worried
[47:48] Miriam because because she'd prejudiced
[47:51] against Moses dark wife hey amen
[47:55] Bible says so what happened to Miriam
[47:58] leprosy come up on where she had now
[48:01] dead where's Aaron dead David so I
[48:08] believe the message you do bring forth
[48:11] fruits meat unto repentance I believe
[48:14] the message hey man now I'll make the
[48:16] plane this morning maybe you don't
[48:18] understand these things but who saw the
[48:21] pillar fire the pillow fire came down in
[48:23] about two because 1950 with God's
[48:26] prophet they saw the pillar fire even
[48:29] right now brother Brown is sweet-talking
[48:31] certain people there's sheep locked up
[48:33] in there if you heard these telephone
[48:35] message you have heard him say over and
[48:37] over
[48:37] this is a fact now I know where I
[48:39] wouldn't say it if I didn't know that
[48:41] that is true I know exactly what I'm
[48:43] saying
[48:44] he's sweet-talking certain people
[48:46] they're sheep
[48:47] locked up in certain cults and he's
[48:49] gonna that's right they're sheep there
[48:51] and one woman up in Chicago her son is
[48:53] locked up there and she went to brother
[48:56] Branham and he assured her in God's
[48:58] season in God's time he'll come out see
[49:01] you come out see so during this time
[49:04] love ye one another what am I to do here
[49:08] preach the word in season out of season
[49:10] reprove cuz it prove at all
[49:13] long-suffering why am i preached this
[49:16] way this morning I'm preaching to you
[49:18] that those of you who are going to wrong
[49:20] with me turn around that's why if not
[49:24] because they these things they I could
[49:25] preach a nice message and you shout and
[49:27] go home see me now it's hard to preach
[49:30] this way but then we may understand
[49:32] these things and repent not keep on
[49:35] doing the same thing every Wednesday
[49:38] Sunday Wednesday Sunday that's no
[49:41] repentance no well a lot understand
[49:43] anyway he does did he understand about
[49:46] Aaron Miriam 3 million of his own people
[49:50] dead the Bible says dead means eternally
[49:54] separated from God so we find it and
[49:58] this is our now Paul said to cast off
[50:02] the works of darkness amen
[50:04] cast him off in this hour an hour in
[50:07] Romans 13 I just want to read it to you
[50:09] and and that knowing the time then now
[50:13] is high time to awake out of sleep for
[50:16] now is our salvation nearer then when we
[50:19] believe is it is it nearer amen
[50:22] the night is far spent the day is at
[50:25] hand the day of Christ let us therefore
[50:27] cast off the works of darkness let us
[50:30] put on the armor of light let us walk
[50:32] honestly as in the day not in rioting
[50:34] and also drunkenness and Chairman and
[50:37] wantonness and strength and envy
[50:38] now either strength and envy is the Word
[50:42] of God is the works of God or it's not
[50:44] that's up to you touch because
[50:45] understand it either
[50:47] a jealous pair like soul against David
[50:51] is the work of God or is not up to you
[50:53] to understand it see but put you on the
[50:55] Lord Jesus Christ to work and make not
[50:58] provision for the flesh to fulfill the
[51:00] lusts thereof that's the message of the
[51:03] hour
[51:03] paul also said overhead ephesians the
[51:07] fifth chapter 4 and 8 verse 4 ye were
[51:11] sometimes darkness ye were sometimes
[51:14] darkness see but now are ye light in the
[51:18] Lord walk as children of light for the
[51:21] fruit the fruit of the Spirit is all
[51:25] goodness and righteousness and truth
[51:28] proving what is acceptable unto the Lord
[51:31] now notice now have no fellowship with
[51:33] the unfruitful works of darkness but
[51:36] rather reprove them
[51:38] somebody wants their own else up you got
[51:41] talk about somebody reprove that thing
[51:42] there let them know how because your
[51:45] walk at you not want to stand in the way
[51:47] with the sinners you're not gonna listen
[51:49] to the ungodly filth come out their
[51:51] mouths their hearts so reprove them
[51:53] that's exactly what the Bible says when
[51:56] in this hour now don't it's a shame to
[52:00] even hear that filth Paul sessile right
[52:02] here for it's a shame even to speak of
[52:05] those things which are done of them in
[52:07] secret say in secret they do it in
[52:11] secret and if anybody they want to be a
[52:13] Jonathan linked together the chain one
[52:16] soul all of us around the evil ones to
[52:18] get mad at you see they may now think
[52:20] you say oh why you got to tell all
[52:22] because Dave everything saw because
[52:23] Jonathan why see say the same thing
[52:27] today why tell because a ship is
[52:30] everything why tell them you ain't tell
[52:32] me that you are reproving that filth
[52:34] that's what you're doing it have no
[52:36] fellowship with the unfruitful works of
[52:38] darkness is that unfruitful on earth
[52:40] will that bring forth anything bring
[52:43] forth death so but rather reprove them
[52:47] like Jonathan told David of Saul's
[52:50] jealousy and unfruitful works
[52:51] that's what he did Jonathan told David
[52:55] of Saul's jealousy his plan his talking
[52:59] about him in blasting him insult
[53:00] cause his friend Jesus Christ he told
[53:03] his disciples his friends what the enemy
[53:05] was getting ready to do to their butt
[53:07] because trans knew all things amen
[53:10] so we find them that let our lives
[53:13] reprove by listen by being in contrast
[53:18] to all darkness all evil speaking and
[53:21] lying in jealousy is darkness
[53:23] they say ye are the children late then
[53:26] walk as children of the light then when
[53:29] you begin to walk as children the light
[53:31] in you all autumn your life is automatic
[53:34] because we proven their lives for you
[53:38] are bringing forth good fruit in your
[53:39] season amen God's Word so we find then
[53:45] that when our lives will begin to bear
[53:49] fruit on the word it'll no no clicks
[53:52] it'll no no color lines no nothing see
[53:57] it'll just be linked knit it together
[54:00] soul the soul and then the Holy Spirit
[54:03] can move up on that and come down up on
[54:06] it so we're finding that when it's all
[54:09] murmuring and mumbling in a dark corner
[54:11] put the light up on and sharing up on it
[54:13] what's that over there over there and
[54:14] pull out an openness a you find out what
[54:16] it is and watch them run like roaches
[54:17] that's character they go that's right
[54:20] they can't face you with that stuff they
[54:23] could because talking behind your back
[54:25] all day long but they can't face you
[54:27] with it never will they face you with it
[54:28] they can't face you with they can't
[54:30] stand against that truth can't do it see
[54:34] so they call hard preaching because
[54:37] you're mad and no love and clicks and so
[54:39] forth that's what they say they gotta
[54:41] say that that's what's in their heart
[54:42] see so don't ever look back no other
[54:47] words if we have a look back and think
[54:49] that we did something here then we have
[54:51] left gone I haven't done nothing God has
[54:56] built a work here himself
[54:58] but me I'm not anything I'm standing
[55:00] here by the grace of Almighty got it and
[55:02] pray that God will speak for me to his
[55:04] because to his sheep but I ain't done
[55:07] anything here don't ever look back
[55:09] because if you look back there's nothing
[55:11] there because Aaron because he could
[55:12] look back
[55:13] he's dead though Aaron was a prophet
[55:16] wasn't he
[55:16] well could he look back he's dead that's
[55:20] right don't ever look back see go all on
[55:23] my lord
[55:23] pause that press forward the one to mark
[55:25] up the hack hole press forward not that
[55:28] I have attained because to the out
[55:30] resurrection that's what he said but
[55:33] he's seeking to but he knew that he had
[55:36] to earnest though a man he had the
[55:38] earnest of the resurrection in him so we
[55:42] find therefore that in this island now
[55:46] is a time for us to examine ourselves to
[55:50] see if we be in the faith - well we know
[55:53] one thing that Jesus Christ that he has
[55:56] ordained and chosen us to bring forth
[55:58] fruit he said so in Saint John 15 I have
[56:01] ordained and chosen you to bring forth
[56:04] fruit so we know that we have some
[56:08] Jonathas here this morning and Davis
[56:09] whose souls are knitted together loving
[56:13] the Brethren hating the works of
[56:15] darkness they hate that and when they
[56:17] hear people talking about this one
[56:18] talking over their jealousy they can't
[56:20] stand that see it grieves them and they
[56:22] said well listen sister if you don't if
[56:24] you don't leave it just don't come here
[56:25] no more
[56:26] that's between you and God say somebody
[56:28] wants because of my total between them
[56:30] and God say and move on leave that alone
[56:33] upsie don't be staring on no evil
[56:35] darkness like that leaving people alone
[56:37] because they are evil is corrupt as
[56:40] filthy in God's sight the eyes of God is
[56:43] searching out looking for the good trees
[56:45] he's blessing them and the corrupt trees
[56:48] are standing around man and even talking
[56:51] about you right let us the budge and so
[56:52] forth corrupt tree bring forth corrupt
[56:55] fruit you cannot get any good fruit from
[56:58] those trees can't get it so we find then
[57:02] that if we're Jonathan and David have a
[57:05] beautiful friendship like that
[57:06] Jonathan strengthen Davis hand amen in
[57:10] his battles Christ strengthened his
[57:13] disciples hand amen if I'm your brother
[57:17] strengthen my hand
[57:18] with prayers and so forth strengthen my
[57:21] hand
[57:22] pray for me help me I need your help we
[57:26] have one soul don't talk about me and
[57:29] down me there and knock me down strength
[57:31] in my hands if you are my brother see so
[57:36] we find then that these friends who will
[57:38] strengthen one another's hands they will
[57:41] bring forth fruit we have those who love
[57:45] to know what's going on down at Tucson
[57:47] and those who want to play on the Jeff
[57:49] go down there we hear we're do what we
[57:55] God put us here together if you want to
[57:57] go they go there it's alright if you say
[57:59] well brother songs a soul pressures over
[58:01] there don't know but if you want to
[58:04] strengthen our hands here what stand do
[58:06] it
[58:07] sing it bring it forth let it be seen
[58:09] we'll do it together amen
[58:12] now how can we know that we're gonna
[58:15] bring forth this fruit amen how can we
[58:17] know well Davis said here we shall be
[58:21] like trees as planet by a rivers of
[58:22] living water that right I'm gonna show
[58:24] you something so we will be positive
[58:27] amen he said that notice now God Davis
[58:31] said that we all like trees as planet
[58:33] not just growing there some I had a plan
[58:36] him husband man right there for car has
[58:39] planted us by the rivers of living water
[58:42] he took us from here and put us there by
[58:46] where by the river of living water
[58:48] Romans 6:5 says that we have been
[58:51] planted together in here in the light of
[58:54] his death amen
[58:55] then we shall also be in the likeness of
[58:58] his resurrection we've been praying
[59:01] there you have anything to do with God
[59:03] he puts you there he plants you where he
[59:06] wants you to be at stay there and bear
[59:08] fruit
[59:09] Saniya now stay right when he plants you
[59:11] it and bear fruit right there
[59:14] excuse me and he says that we shall be
[59:18] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[59:20] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[59:23] his season and his leaf shall not wither
[59:27] we know this that his fruit in his
[59:30] season
[59:32] Luther had to bring forth his fruit in
[59:34] his season and right Wesley had to bring
[59:36] forth his fruit in his season d90 no
[59:39] says Pentecost had to bring forth their
[59:41] fruit in their season this is a
[59:43] different season see this is an entire
[59:46] different season now we're going to
[59:49] bring forth the fruit for we're seeds of
[59:52] God that has come out of the husk it's
[59:55] laying out here now the Sun is coming to
[59:58] shine up on these seeds to bring forth
[1:00:01] that fruit then when that when the Sun
[1:00:03] shines you can't do anything about it
[1:00:04] then you can run you can hide you can
[1:00:06] jump you can stump but you can't bring
[1:00:08] forth the fruit that linemate did you
[1:00:10] can't do it see and then you were crying
[1:00:13] your said give me the oil
[1:00:14] so depend up but it's not there but

[1:00:23] knitted together you see me now right
[1:00:25] now bringing air forth now in spite of
[1:00:28] the devil st. now resist you I love my
[1:00:31] brother I hate the rights of darkness
[1:00:34] evil speaking of so up because I hate
[1:00:36] that I'll prove it by my life my life
[1:00:39] will convict those who do that now
[1:00:41] that's how you know how you bring forth
[1:00:43] fruit and the spirit gotta fall upon
[1:00:46] that kind of tree yes it will it's leaf
[1:00:48] won't wither no siree the leaf then the
[1:00:52] fruit amen
[1:00:53] so we find then that how will we be if
[1:00:57] we want to be because I trees that's
[1:00:59] planet then we will be standing by
[1:01:02] rivers of truth amen drinking and the
[1:01:08] truth of the word of God amen and
[1:01:11] bringing forth the proper fruit of the
[1:01:16] Spirit see the proper fruit of the
[1:01:19] Spirit and we want to find out about
[1:01:21] that now if we a tree we're gonna stand
[1:01:23] God he put he put you here you were
[1:01:26] Baptist Methodist Pentecostal but he

[1:01:43] walk outside downstairs over your home
[1:01:45] and you bring forth corruptness no man
[1:01:49] you come here not see yes that's kind of
[1:01:51] treatise by the fruits you shall know
[1:01:53] them so we find them that turn with me
[1:01:57] to Ezekiel about five more minutes we
[1:02:02] want to see what the Lord has done here
[1:02:04] Ezekiel 47 amen for you Scott we want to
[1:02:14] know David said that we are planted by
[1:02:17] rivers of living water amen
[1:02:20] where is the rivers of this living water
[1:02:23] located at amen praise God
[1:02:27] after what he brought me again unto the
[1:02:30] door of the house and behold waters
[1:02:33] issued out from under the threshold of
[1:02:36] the house eastward for the forefront of
[1:02:38] the house - toward the east and the
[1:02:41] waters came down from under from the
[1:02:44] right side of the house and at the south
[1:02:46] side of the altar
[1:02:47] now hold your place right there and turn
[1:02:51] to revelation 22 it's the same house the
[1:02:55] same throne the same altar and we find
[1:02:58] out where it said a whole list but right
[1:03:02] there revelation 22 and he showed me a
[1:03:05] pure river of water of life clear as
[1:03:08] crystal proceeding out of the throne of
[1:03:10] God and of the lamb in the midst of the
[1:03:13] street of it and on either side of the
[1:03:15] river or was there's D D Tree of Life
[1:03:18] which bare twelve manner of fruits and
[1:03:20] yielded her fruit every month and the
[1:03:23] leaves of the tree were four but they
[1:03:25] were they were a healing of the nation's
[1:03:27] so we fired back over here in the second
[1:03:29] verse a colon third verse we see that
[1:03:32] the river of water comes from the throne
[1:03:34] now here's over in the Old Testament
[1:03:36] here Ezekiel prophesied is right here
[1:03:39] and when the man but they had the line
[1:03:43] in his hand went forth east would he
[1:03:45] measured a thousand cubits and he
[1:03:48] brought me through
[1:03:49] look the man brought him through the
[1:03:51] waters amen
[1:03:53] through the waters the waters were to
[1:03:55] the ankles then a man Christ where came
[1:03:59] to Martin Luther and took them and
[1:04:02] brought them through the waters
[1:04:04] ankle-deep then right and turn you from
[1:04:07] death works in Rome and turn around and
[1:04:10] took him into the river the living water
[1:04:13] now Martin Luther walked into the river
[1:04:15] the water stood there up to his ankles
[1:04:17] justification by faith he had the faith
[1:04:20] to go into the rivers of heavy water
[1:04:22] expanding amen amen now notice now and
[1:04:27] he measured a thousand and brought me
[1:04:29] through the waters the waters were to
[1:04:31] the knees God took Wesley and brought
[1:04:35] him out into the world also past the
[1:04:37] ankles up to the knees amen now he went
[1:04:40] by faith up to the knees and also again
[1:04:44] he measured a thousand brought me
[1:04:46] through the waters were to the lawyer's
