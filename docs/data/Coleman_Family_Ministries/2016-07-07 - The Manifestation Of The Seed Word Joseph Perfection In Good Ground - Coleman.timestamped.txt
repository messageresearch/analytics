[0:55] quite sure everybody wants to see the
[0:57] glory of Jesus here I know that's what
[1:00] uh I feel like Moses I beseech thee show
[1:03] me thy glory amen cuz Moses told the
[1:06] Lord he was not going to go up the
[1:08] second time unless the glory went with
[1:10] him and I believe we feel the same way
[1:13] we cannot go any further praise God
[1:16] unless God's glory comes and takes us
[1:18] praise God so we certainly thank God for
[1:22] that and what can I say about Brother
[1:24] Ray burfield what a a a testimony back
[1:29] to me and encouragement the Lord knows
[1:33] when to encourage you at the right
[1:37] time all these years and I and it comes
[1:41] at this time so there's so many things
[1:44] to say but I'll talk to the brother
[1:47] myself but I certainly thank God for him
[1:49] and the ones that are standing down
[1:51] there and it makes me feel good I was
[1:53] never there but that's brother Brown's
[1:58] message got nothing to do with me at all
[2:02] and I keep telling them
[2:04] and thank God for the people in New
[2:06] Zealand they know it you see how humbl
[2:09] the brother was he said these are
[2:10] brother brandom's quotes from Harvest
[2:12] Time and whatever see does people like
[2:15] get around the world and the Holy Spirit
[2:16] sent this tape here that you might know
[2:19] that there's others of likeminded Faith
[2:22] precious like Faith around the world
[2:24] they are seeds of God and so they don't
[2:27] they don't have no leader or somebody
[2:30] they got to follow amen and he showed
[2:32] you when they get off the word where
[2:34] they all wind up at so we thank God that
[2:37] we stay in that word and so may God
[2:39] richly bless if this tape you get to my

[3:27] Gathering of the tears and the Shu going

[3:33] amen and everything is died down is dead
[3:36] and there's something going on this is
[3:38] seed time amen and negative and positive
[3:42] the seeds are taking life amen and and
[3:44] spirit and they become in flesh and you
[3:47] when you say it it's like say Paul spoke
[3:50] in the Bible a seed what would be befall
[3:53] Us in the last days then when that thing
[3:56] begins to happen that means that that
[3:59] that seed has taking life amen and the
[4:02] spirits got a hold of it whether it's
[4:03] negative like over Europe and what's
[4:05] happening there in in the Book of
[4:06] Revelation and Rome and all those things
[4:09] that's the seeds and they're taking life
[4:12] those are negative seeds of course but
[4:14] then what about the
[4:16] positive I mean brother Marcel a seed
[4:20] taking life sister Alexander a seed
[4:24] taking life do you see what it's not
[4:27] many but there are some and these seats
[4:30] down there or are you understand what
[4:32] I'm

[5:54] soft
[5:56] friends it's my last message for a while
[6:00] God is looking for a bride love
[6:04] slaves to be prisoners to Jesus Christ
[6:08] the
[6:09] word to pull this Malachi for a message
[6:13] in the presence of this last
[6:17] generation and on Paul a prisoner I was
[6:19] going to speak on it the 17th but uh I
[6:22] never got to it I read this quote I want
[6:25] to read it
[6:26] again just kind of set the tone for the
[6:29] message cuz it just wasn't right there
[6:32] page 13 and let the love of God come in
[6:36] his
[6:37] presence praise God and ENT into the
[6:41] spirit Paul knew what it
[6:44] was on page 13 Paul prisoner he found
[6:48] out that he was harnessed to
[6:50] something like a horse in harness it is
[6:54] to pull something Hallelujah and Paul
[6:57] knew after this experience and 3 years
[7:00] and a half of typing this experience he
[7:03] had with the Bible he realized that God
[7:06] had chosen him that's the first thing
[7:09] did he choose you Hallelujah if he chose
[7:12] you then nothing else
[7:15] matters and then he chose and he
[7:17] harnessed him by the Holy Spirit am the
[7:21] experience that he had to pull the
[7:24] gospel in the presence of the Gentiles
[7:27] now watch the spirit itself self
[7:30] harnessed him now what is the message
[7:34] that I've been driving and trying to get
[7:35] to you the Holy Spirit itself is
[7:39] here then if he's here what is he going
[7:42] to do he's going to harness
[7:47] you those that go here and go there and
[7:49] they can't make it well he's here to
[7:52] make it for
[7:54] you amen today as Servants of Christ we
[7:59] be come harnessed hooked up we can't go
[8:03] without it being with us harnessed to
[8:06] the word no matter what anyone else says
[8:09] you're harnessed to it yes there's
[8:12] something about it that you just can't
[8:14] get away from it you've been yolked up
[8:17] with it by the Holy
[8:19] Ghost and it it yoked you to the
[8:23] word no matter what anyone else says it
[8:27] is the word that is following
[8:30] you see you're pulling the word and
[8:34] you're harnessed by the Holy
[8:36] Spirit and you're pulling this word and
[8:39] that's what I've been doing seven
[8:41] Thunders give faith I'm pulling
[8:44] it all the critics is standing on the
[8:46] side but we're pulling
[8:50] it Hallelujah adoption Perfection
[8:54] pulling it Malachi 4 pulling
[8:57] it regardless of how many critics of
[8:59] what they
[9:00] say we
[9:03] yolked oh Hallelujah you won't you won't
[9:07] worry about the world you won't worry
[9:09] about the things of the world if you
[9:10] ever get
[9:11] yolked the trouble is you haven't been
[9:13] yolked up with the
[9:16] word thank you Jesus his presence is
[9:19] here now
[9:22] Hallelujah you're being yolked up with
[9:24] the Holy Ghost right
[9:26] now and it yoke you to the word it is
[9:30] the word that is Fallen you harness up
[9:33] with put in the Yoke with it to the word
[9:37] by the spirit he was harnessed yes
[9:42] Glory now we must come back to the Bible
[9:44] times for this day the priest was
[9:47] harnessed too but you see they never
[9:50] they came over into another
[9:52] dispensation and they failed to strip
[9:55] off their old
[9:56] harness now I can say a lot of things
[9:58] here I preach a whole message here I
[10:01] could that old harness that you didn't
[10:02] take off that old nature and we can go
[10:04] on and on Old Doctrine or whatever it
[10:06] was amen you see but you see they never
[10:10] they came over to another dispensation
[10:12] and they failed to strip off the old
[10:13] harness and put on a new harness and the
[10:17] same thing we find today we did come
[10:19] through a denominational age as we prove
[10:21] through the church ages the Bible and so
[10:23] forth but we come now to a free age
[10:27] where the Holy Spirit himself
[10:30] comes down vindicates himself and makes
[10:34] himself known see what's going on here
[10:37] now and makes every promise that he
[10:40] promised come to
[10:43] pass oh Church praise
[10:47] God page 17 God is looking for
[10:51] prisoners he's always done it see I have
[10:54] to say these words before I preach this
[10:57] message it'll tie right back into
[10:59] Brother Ray bur's
[11:01] testimony cuz he had my message right on
[11:03] on that tape there and God sent it to me
[11:06] as a witness to go ahead and preach us
[11:08] here
[11:09] amen
[11:13] yes God is looking for
[11:16] prisoners he's always done it you might
[11:19] search it through the scripture a man
[11:21] has to be a prisoner to Christ against
[11:23] anything therefore you cannot be
[11:26] connected with anything but Christ amen
[11:30] watch even your father your mother your
[11:35] brother your sister your husband your
[11:40] wife anybody God is above your wife
[11:44] above your husband and when your
[11:47] husbands and wives understand that each
[11:48] one has got to take that word they are
[11:52] Yol each woman is is a prisoner unto the
[11:56] Lord and her Covenant husband might be
[11:59] all unspiritual and whatever but she's
[12:03] yolked she cannot deny her
[12:06] master praise God and the husband is
[12:09] yolked to the word of
[12:11] God that's the way it is
[12:14] friends that's why if both are Yol then
[12:17] there's no problem CU when one is Yol
[12:19] and one is not Yol then there's problem
[12:21] in the
[12:22] home but it both filled with the Holy
[12:24] Ghost oh praise God as brother burfield
[12:27] said those colors are flying everywhere
[12:29] praise God yes sir
[12:33] Glory
[12:35] Glory Glory to
[12:39] God Amen with anybody you're only
[12:42] connected with Christ and him
[12:46] only then God can use
[12:49] you don't even ask God to use you for
[12:53] nothing until you've been
[12:55] stripped of all your old harness
[12:59] and then yolked up with the message
[13:01] itself not your idea of it then you're
[13:04] ready to do something for God not before
[13:07] that's why you see them all running up
[13:08] and down these past 20 years they fail
[13:11] they they heaps along the
[13:13] roadside but brother bery said brother
[13:16] cman we are standing praise
[13:19] God why because he stayed connected with
[13:22] Christ and him only then God can use you
[13:26] until then you can't amen oh praise God
[13:31] hallelujah hallelujah page
[13:34] 24 he said um yes
[13:38] sir excuse me speaking about
[13:42] Joseph amen yes sir remember he was sold
[13:46] by his brothers to an Egyptian when he
[13:47] was in prison and they sold him to pipar
[13:50] and pipar gave him a little bit of
[13:52] Liberty and the first thing you know
[13:54] that was taken from him and there he sat
[13:57] in prison crying crying God had to strip
[13:59] him now notice this but all the time I
[14:02] believe in that prison he could remember
[14:04] that the vision said that he was going
[14:06] to sit on a throne and his brothers were
[14:08] going to bow to him because he knew that
[14:11] his gift came from God and he knew that
[14:13] it had to come to
[14:15] pass oh my oh how you could think back
[14:19] and by inspiration struck you and what
[14:21] God Said and you know even though you
[14:23] can be in some prison to somebody amen
[14:26] they put you in a prison but you're not
[14:28] in prison
[14:30] the message put you in prison for for
[14:31] what you preach but you yourself are not
[14:33] in
[14:34] prison I'm in nobody's prison even
[14:37] though they put me
[14:38] there but I'm free amen he whom the son
[14:42] of man set free is free I am not in
[14:45] prison to their ideas to their lives to
[14:49] what they feel to what they say that's
[14:51] what they say let every man's word be a
[14:54] lie praise God let God's word be true so
[14:58] I am free I'm a free man
[15:01] amen hallelujah praise God and he knew
[15:05] it had to come to pass and I know Joseph
[15:08] Perfection got to come to pass though it
[15:10] was spoken in 1964 amen it'll come to
[15:13] pass praise God if we can only keep that
[15:16] in our minds that according to the word
[15:18] of God in these last days he's going to
[15:22] have a church going to have a people and
[15:25] these things that he promised he's going
[15:28] to do them he said he would and we're
[15:31] living in the time with the word he's
[15:35] just trying to get us to be real
[15:37] prisoners now locked in with
[15:41] him so are we combing through here now

[17:35] few of their own Wills off he shows them
[17:39] that they can't do just what they wanted
[17:42] to do see you know what I mean they are
[17:45] not at Liberty to do what they want to
[17:48] do before they can come into full power
[17:51] and be a l slave to

[18:27] to be shaved off then
[18:29] presented sometimes he takes them to the
[18:32] deserts to do that to shave them off and
[18:35] then bring them out the anointed ones to
[18:39] fulfill the purpose that he's ordained
[18:42] them to be see what I mean brother we at
[18:45] the end time yes sir praise
[18:49] God now if now now then if you're
[18:51] following God and have submitted
[18:53] yourself to God then you become a
[18:55] prisoner to that God to that word to
[18:58] that will am no matter what anybody else
[19:00] says we become a prisoner to it listen
[19:04] we at the end time and I would say this
[19:07] with reverence and respect as the last
[19:09] couple of minutes is floating by look
[19:11] what God in my to my opinion will do
[19:15] must do and will do in his last days is
[19:17] to find a tool for the Harvest he's got
[19:20] to find a tool to thresh the
[19:22] floor any fer when he goes to his
[19:24] Harvest he has to have a tool to do it
[19:27] with certainly he's got to have a sharp
[19:29] sickle or something some instrument to
[19:31] thresh out the Grain and the Harvest is
[19:33] right God take us in your hands make us
[19:37] bonder Servants of Your Love use us for
[19:41] tools to bring to to the realization
[19:45] bring the realization to this sinful
[19:47] cursed Earth that we Liv in today that
[19:50] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[19:52] and
[19:53] forever for myself God let me be a
[19:55] prisoner if all my brethren turn me down
[19:58] all my friends turn me down I want to be
[20:01] a prisoner of Jesus Christ to and his
[20:03] word that I might be harnessed to his
[20:06] word by the Holy
[20:08] Spirit to see the Holy Spirit make the
[20:12] word of God be confirmed by the things
[20:15] that he said would be done I want to be
[20:17] a prisoner of Jesus Christ let us pray
[20:20] how many want to be a prisoner of
[20:22] Christ and he speaks to the young people

[20:32] I'm uh when I get big I'm going to be a
[20:34] certain thing I wonder if you could feel

[20:52] have Ambitions of her fine lady

[23:57] blessing amen amen and amen okay quickly
[24:00] to the word uh Genesis 1 St Luke 8 St
[24:05] John
[24:06] 15 amen Genesis 1:1 and God said let the
[24:10] Earth bring forth grass the herb
[24:12] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[24:14] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[24:17] is in itself upon the Earth and it was
[24:19] so and and the Earth brought forth grass
[24:23] and Herb yielding seed after his kind
[24:26] and the tree yielding fruit who SE was
[24:28] in itself after his kind and God saw
[24:31] that it was good in St Luke 8 one of The
[24:35] Parables where the brother Berfield was
[24:37] speaking about and I felt to take it
[24:39] from St Luke it's in in three different
[24:42] places and I felt it was a little
[24:44] shorter here the reading of the
[24:47] scriptures Amen on fourth verse and when
[24:50] much people were gathered together and
[24:53] were come to him out of every city he he
[24:57] spake by a terrible a soul went out to
[25:00] seow his seed and as he sowed some fell
[25:03] by the wayside and it was triing down
[25:05] and the fouls the air devoured it and
[25:07] some fell upon a rock and as soon as it
[25:10] was sprung up it it withered away
[25:12] because it lacked
[25:13] moisture and some fell upon thorns and
[25:16] the Thorns sprang up up with it and
[25:18] choked it and others fell on good ground
[25:21] and sprang up and bear fruit 100 fold
[25:25] and when he had said these things he
[25:27] cried he he that hath an ear let him
[25:30] hear amen and his disciples asked him
[25:33] saying what might this Parable be and he
[25:36] said unto you it is given to know the
[25:39] mysteries of the kingdom of God but to
[25:41] others in Parables that seeing they
[25:43] might not see and hearing they they
[25:47] might not understand and he hasn't
[25:50] changed I mean the same son of man amen
[25:55] came and took all the mysteries of the
[25:57] Old Testament
[25:59] and revealed them to his disciples and
[26:01] spoke to many in
[26:03] Parables so that they would hear it and
[26:06] see it and yet not believe
[26:08] it but he revealed the Mysteries to his
[26:12] disciples in the same son of man not
[26:15] another came back in Malachi
[26:18] 4 and took all the mysteries of the last
[26:21] seven Church ages praise God and
[26:23] gathered his disciples and spoke uh in
[26:27] Parables to many the seven sealers open
[26:30] the seven sealers close it's AAR but the
[26:33] se but the disciples know it's open and
[26:36] the others it say it's closed then they
[26:38] argue about it then they go away oh my
[26:41] see the
[26:42] Mysteries so he hasn't changed cuz it's
[26:45] a son of man praise God and 100f let him
[26:50] here and disciples answer him saying
[26:52] what might this Parable be and I I read

[29:16] to put it just this way sew ye and reap
[29:19] plant Vineyards and eat the fruit

[30:28] matured yet amen amen and then he goes
[30:30] on speaking about the word and so forth
[30:32] I'm trying to skip around Luther went to
[30:35] husk with his first word the just shall
[30:37] live by faith Wesley had two words
[30:39] sanctification second definite work of
[30:42] Grace Pentecost had the third word the
[30:44] restoration of the gifts but the entire
[30:47] seed has to come
[30:49] forth that's what I'm talking about amen

[48:27] intelligent will step right into it and
[48:28] shall be shall speak and so now by the
[48:32] close from Malachi 4's message the bride
[48:35] forms herself into the word image for
[48:38] the intelligence to step right into it
[48:41] then it is smitten a
[48:44] [Music]
[48:45] masterpiece yes sir see it's a call to
[48:48] perfection in this seed time or Pride
[48:52] time which is Harvest
[48:55] Time you ain't got much more time to
[48:59] go praise God on marriage and divorce
[49:01] page 14 thank you brother Bram said on
[49:04] page 14 usually a Revival only lasts
[49:06] about 3 years but this has been going on
[49:08] for over 15 years and not one
[49:10] denomination has sprung up from it for
[49:13] this is seed
[49:15] time you see what he's
[49:18] saying in
[49:20] 1946 it was the time of the Harvest and
[49:24] the angel of the Lord came and gave
[49:25] brother brandom the word which was
[49:29] seeds and it couldn't form no
[49:32] denomination because it was the word of
[49:36] God that's why he said 15 years there
[49:39] hasn't been a denomination you cannot
[49:41] denominate the
[49:43] word how can you denominate Jesus
[49:47] [Applause]
[49:49] Christ I don't may you could take
[49:51] justification and go around that
[49:53] sanctification and the in the gift and
[49:55] speaking in tongues
[49:57] you can denominate that but you cannot
[49:59] denominate this whole Bible
[50:02] here no
[50:04] way and brother Brown preached this
[50:07] Bible and they were
[50:09] seeds and they were four types of hearts
[50:12] that they were going to go
[50:14] into or good or
[50:16] grounds yes
[50:19] hey in all these years Malachi for's
[50:22] words were word seeds now there's no
[50:25] more shu after the shuck is gone is seed
[50:29] God is ready if he isn't doing it now
[50:32] he's going to call a church to
[50:33] Perfection by his word Jesus
[50:36] Christ see then then uh brother the son
[50:41] of man's words became brother bram's
[50:44] words brother Bram spoke them and put
[50:47] them here these were still his words
[50:49] which was the son of man's words then we
[50:52] take from this or to take and it's our
[50:55] words then amen but then it still
[50:58] remains there unless we speak
[51:02] it and once we speak it for our churches
[51:04] and family it becomes
[51:07] ours so what I took from the prophet
[51:10] became ours in this
[51:13] church whatever it
[51:16] was you understand I had the faith to do
[51:20] it and the anointing is here to prove it
[51:23] God is here praise God that's the way it
[51:27] will be done in the message and there is
[51:29] no other way is going to be done that's
[51:31] the way it was always done so brother
[51:35] I'm glad I saw it a long time
[51:37] ago you may be seated so his words
[51:40] become your words if you speak them back
[51:43] by faith amen by
[51:45] Revelation amen do you see the
[51:48] circumstances surrounding our coming to
[51:51] Perfection then see a Perfection amen it
[51:54] cannot come per infection cannot come
[51:57] from the
[51:59] Wayside now I'm going drive it home now
[52:02] the man already spoke it already it
[52:04] cannot come from the Wayside Hearts it
[52:07] cannot come from Stony Rocky Hearts it
[52:10] cannot come from Thorns which is still
[52:12] here by the way the other two gone amen
[52:15] but the Thorns are still hanging
[52:17] around yes sir see it can only come from
[52:21] the heart of good
[52:23] ground yes sir the parable of the Soul
[52:26] pictures the whole course of this age of
[52:30] Grace portraying reception of the word
[52:34] of God in different hearts and the
[52:38] results that
[52:41] follow yes sir and the Wayside Hearts
[52:45] those are like hard paths like right
[52:48] outside of a field and the farmer may
[52:50] have the field enclosed then there's
[52:52] some uh ground right outside of his
[52:54] enclosed field that's by the way side
[52:57] and when the se s the seeds the wind
[53:00] blew it right through the fence and it
[53:02] landed on the outside here well he
[53:04] didn't cultivate it outside there just
[53:06] laid right
[53:08] [Applause]
[53:09] there
[53:11] amen so therefore those hard paths with
[53:14] unenclosed fields or unplowed and
[53:17] unprepared ground and which could not
[53:20] receive seed to grow it and where the
[53:22] birds remember them birds flying through
[53:24] the the mines those dirty birds those
[53:28] birds fly right through there and pluck
[53:29] it right out of there praise God Amen
[53:32] and devour it oh Hallelujah and the
[53:36] Stony ground of Rocky Hearts partially
[53:39] prep now that ground was partially
[53:41] prepared ground but the stones that was
[53:45] not taken out they didn't take the time
[53:47] to pull them stones out those hard rocks
[53:51] in there mad of hoing grudges and stuff
[53:54] they didn't pull it out
[53:57] amen amen see they left it in there they
[54:00] in the message amen and we not taken out
[54:03] so the seed could grow and fully
[54:06] develop and they and they're gone among
[54:09] Thorns Hearts you see parly prepared
[54:13] ground but the Thorns were not all taken
[54:16] out so the seed could germinate and grow
[54:21] normally
[54:23] Glory understand now the way side Stony
[54:27] Thorns Thorns the
[54:29] craving passionate desire for other
[54:34] things creep in and choke and suffocate
[54:38] the
[54:41] word yes sir and lust for other things
[54:45] and becometh
[54:47] unfruitful Glory see these thorny hearts
[54:51] in St Luke
[54:53] 8:14 amen uh I was shouting and the Lord
[54:57] showed me this here last Sunday there I
[54:59] was reading that there I got a real
[55:00] blessing before that tape came that's
[55:02] when I got the inspiration here I was
[55:03] reading it there 8:14 and that which
[55:06] fell among Thorns are they which when
[55:09] they have heard go forth and are choked
[55:12] with cares and riches and pleasures of
[55:15] this life I was reading and bring no
[55:19] fruit to
[55:20] Perfection I said wait a minute let me
[55:22] read this again I said well then the
[55:24] tears will I mean the thorns will never
[55:27] be
[55:28] perfected then why should I fool with
[55:30] [Applause]
[55:34] them the Bible says they will never be
[55:38] perfected they're full of lust and
[55:41] things for the world and cravings and
[55:43] this and that and yet is full of thorns
[55:46] and they didn't pull these thorns out
[55:48] and they're sitting right here in the
[55:50] church this morning full of thorns and
[55:53] they choke the word when the word comes
[55:56] in back up on the word see them things
[55:58] in the heart and right here said the
[56:01] word says I never saw it before the word
[56:04] says and bring no fruit to
[56:08] Perfection I said there you are so
[56:11] therefore Lord in it's seed time only
[56:13] one ground left that's the good ground
[56:16] oh we're here seed time PR time Harvest
[56:21] Time all the rest are
[56:23] finished glory to God oh
[56:29] Hallelujah ah yes sir may be
[56:33] seated there uh there is only one
[56:35] prepared ground and that can bring forth
[56:38] and that's a a good ground and that's uh
[56:40] uh St Matthew 13:23 you can read it it's
[56:43] so bring forth 100f amen and some bring
[56:47] forth 60 and 30 amen but we asking for
[56:50] 100f now the now you understand the
[56:53] manifestation of the seed word Joseph of
[56:56] affection in good ground amen that's my
[56:59] title that's why there's a revelation
[57:02] cuz it ain't it's not going to do
[57:03] nothing in the Thorns the Wayside are
[57:06] the Stony places ain't going to bring no
[57:08] Perfection at all and in the Bible said
[57:11] it'll not bring it amongst the Thorns
[57:14] which is the Pentecostal Spirits we know
[57:15] it the scriptures itself are
[57:19] seeds amen you believe that Satan's Eden
[57:23] page 14 praise God
[57:26] amen notice here here's a thought don't
[57:29] forget it I'll get this some other time
[57:31] or some other message but but you know
[57:33] God said let every seed bring forth of
[57:36] his kind is that God's commandment now
[57:39] what good is any preacher or anybody
[57:41] else to uh to try to make that word say
[57:44] something else now I can stay here about
[57:46] 20 minutes see that's what they've been
[57:49] doing in the message he said the uh the
[57:52] seed let it bring forth of his kind and
[57:54] the prophet said every word is a seed so
[57:57] these ministers takes these seeds and
[58:00] these books and tapes and changes
[58:04] them are you follow what I'm trying to
[58:06] give you illustration they try to change
[58:08] it to say something else but then he
[58:11] then you mess with it then it's
[58:13] hybrid but if you leave it alone it'll
[58:15] bring forth of his
[58:19] kind so you see so if it says seven
[58:22] Thunders will leave it it'll it'll
[58:25] gather the Bri
[58:28] together there you signed down in New
[58:30] Zealand the brother Beria wasn't looking
[58:32] for nobody but these people begin to
[58:34] gathered in the last two
[58:36] years
[58:38] themselves nobody went down there to get
[58:40] them God got them oh praise God my God
[58:46] glory glory so what good is any preacher
[58:49] anybody else to try to make that word
[58:52] say something else like the serpent did
[58:54] it shall you shall not surely die he
[58:58] changed the word put one word in there
[59:00] and it was hybrid and and he died you
[59:03] see every word of God is a seed Jesus
[59:06] said so the seed a soul a soul so if
[59:09] Mark 16 is God's word it will bring
[59:11] forth of its kind if Malachi 4 is God's
[59:14] word it'll bring forth of his kind and
[59:16] every other promise must bring forth of
[59:17] his kind if Ephesians 4 amen amen
[59:21] five-fold Ministry it'll bring forth of
[59:24] his kind a perfect man
[59:27] I mean can't nobody in this message
[59:29] throughout the fivefold
[59:30] ministry no way cuz it's a
[59:35] seed oh there will be Apostles and
[59:38] Prophets and teachers and evangelists
[59:42] and pastors that will be might be
[59:46] five but it'll be cuz it's a
[59:50] [Applause]
[59:52] seed may not be who they want it to be
[59:56] but it'll be
[59:58] anyway every seed will bring forth of
[1:00:01] its kind if you're a seed of God and
[1:00:04] attribute a Son of God you may be seated
[1:00:06] and then the word of God is sown in you
[1:00:09] see and then you hear the word of God my
[1:00:11] sheep hear my voice a stranger they
[1:00:14] won't follow you get it then every seed
[1:00:17] comes forth at his own
[1:00:20] kind and we only preach one kind in here
[1:00:23] brother praise God
[1:00:26] a word image kind in Here We Don't
[1:00:29] Preach no other kind of soft soaping
[1:00:31] stuff around here
[1:00:33] amen so every word of God is a seed and
[1:00:37] these are positive scriptures that's
[1:00:39] taking on life in spirit and every word
[1:00:42] of God's a seed and the Thunders and
[1:00:44] Perfection adoption and the Holy Ghost
[1:00:46] itself is seeds so is the negative seeds
[1:00:49] also end time uh end time seed sign
[1:00:53] quote Jesus said there would be a a a
[1:00:56] fearful signs and sights in the heavens

[1:04:28] saying after the prophet left he left
[1:04:31] the word but the the word was
[1:04:34] anointed and then the elected seeds of
[1:04:37] God that would get in the spirit it's
[1:04:40] got to be somebody picked up for the
[1:04:42] word to come to and Quicken that thing
[1:04:45] to him and then way they
[1:04:50] go that's the way it goes you may be
[1:04:53] seated Jesus did this the early did this
[1:04:56] the seven Church ages did this Malachi 4
[1:04:59] did this so what's so strange about
[1:05:02] somebody today doing
[1:05:03] this what the what I mean they did it
[1:05:06] down in New Zealand and was nobody even
[1:05:10] there see what I mean they were elected
[1:05:12] to do
[1:05:13] it then what they fighting me
[1:05:16] for what did I do is it not a
[1:05:20] cause I mean can I take the anointed
[1:05:22] word also and preach it
[1:05:25] [Applause]
[1:05:26] [Music]
[1:05:29] hallelujah what about the seed word may
[1:05:32] be seed I'm almost finished what about
[1:05:34] the seed word Joseph Perfection Bride
[1:05:36] for this day Hallelujah quote Paradox
[1:05:42] what is the word for This Day quote look
[1:05:45] at those four Patriarchs Abraham Isaac
[1:05:47] Jacob and Joseph Abraham election Isaac
[1:05:50] calling Jacob Grace Joseph
[1:05:53] Perfection nothing against him him
[1:05:56] that's God working his way out and you
[1:05:58] keep telling them and telling them and
[1:06:00] telling them there's nothing against you
[1:06:03] I told them Minister I told them all you
[1:06:05] can't hurt me you can't curse me there's
[1:06:07] nothing against
[1:06:09] me because Joseph Perfection came in my
[1:06:12] heart in
[1:06:14] 1964 and God worked his way out of my
[1:06:19] heart right through the 60s the 7s the '
[1:06:22] 80s right down the
[1:06:24] 1990 God has worked his way
[1:06:28] out and you
[1:06:30] also so who what if God be for you who
[1:06:35] can be against you
[1:06:40] huh if God is your judge God is your
[1:06:45] lawyer and the judge says not
[1:06:48] guilty are you going to argue against
[1:06:52] that not
[1:06:54] guilty
[1:06:57] Glory
[1:06:58] hey
[1:07:04] hallelujah praise

[1:07:16] Glory thank you
[1:07:17] [Applause]
[1:07:19] Lord amen amen you may be
[1:07:22] seated nothing against him that's God
[1:07:25] God working his way out Abraham knew
[1:07:28] there was nothing against him so he kept
[1:07:30] on going regardless of what they said he
[1:07:32] had a revelation no one knew there was
[1:07:35] nothing against
[1:07:36] him see you have a revelation you don't
[1:07:39] care what the 400
[1:07:42] says doesn't matter if it's 1,000
[1:07:45] doesn't matter cuz you have a
[1:07:48] revelation now nothing against him
[1:07:50] that's God working his way out see
[1:07:52] because it came to the word if it was
[1:07:54] the Pentecostal Jacob Grace didn't I
[1:07:56] don't know you see but when they came

[1:18:10] they might not understand now this not
[1:18:13] me now it's Malachi 4 talking here see
[1:18:16] but God's word comes right on down to
[1:18:19] the judgment to judge them because they
[1:18:23] did see it

[1:28:27] seed the same works of Jesus manifest in
[1:28:30] Jesus him being the Original Seed of God
[1:28:32] his death brings you back to the
[1:28:34] original seed of God and if the same
[1:28:36] spirit that was within him is in you
[1:28:38] then the same Works will be manifested
[1:28:41] you don't believe that then turn over St
[1:28:42] John 14:12 then the works will be
[1:28:45] manifested in him are the same for it's
[1:28:47] the same seed word of God God's son was
[1:28:51] his example seed and what is like life
[1:28:54] was when the spirit poured upon him
[1:28:57] after his baptism and the Holy Ghost
[1:28:59] come upon him that very life that he
[1:29:02] produce will that same watering Spirit
[1:29:06] of the Holy Ghost and I'm looking for it
[1:29:07] to be the Holy Ghost itself to be the
[1:29:09] watering spirit in this
[1:29:11] [Applause]
[1:29:13] church then he'll come upon you down at
[1:29:17] the River St Matthew 3:16 And1 17 the
[1:29:20] dove will come upon you and water you
[1:29:23] then that life that he Liv you'll live
[1:29:25] that
[1:29:28] life after his baptism and that's before
[1:29:32] St Matthew 17 amen oh praise God the
[1:29:37] watering spirit will bring forth the
[1:29:39] same kind of a life doing the same thing
[1:29:40] and he did if it's the same seed Son of
[1:29:43] God would bring forth the son of God's
[1:29:45] seed then he says here now shame on you
[1:29:48] women with bobbed hair shame on you
[1:29:50] preachers denying the truth that's right
[1:29:52] hair has nothing to do with it see and
[1:29:55] he begin to all that baby stuff there
[1:29:58] amen oh I'm finished
[1:30:00] now
[1:30:01] [Music]
[1:30:03] tired praise God the shuck is
[1:30:07] dead seed time bride time germ water and
[1:30:10] spirit time bursting from The Germ of
[1:30:13] the seed of the word of Joseph affection
[1:30:15] sew ye and reap and plant Vineyards and
[1:30:18] eat the fruit thereof oh what a time I
[1:30:20] believe that he's the hours here now for
[1:30:23] the manifestation the seed word Joseph
[1:30:26] Perfection uh Capstone in good ground
[1:30:29] and how will the water come the seed
[1:30:31] plant the seed must have water seed
[1:30:34] water before it can grow it must have
[1:30:36] water to fall before the seed that's
[1:30:38] been planted can grow then every seed
[1:30:40] will bring forth of his own kind and
[1:30:42] remember the Earth is full of seeds and
[1:30:44] the rain makes it bring forth of it
[1:30:45] after its kind so
[1:30:48] therefore the J that's inside of the
[1:30:50] seed that's the life in the seed Jesus
[1:30:53] was German of the word of God the German
[1:30:55] is the spirit The Germ is the water now
[1:30:57] how was that done in the apostolic times
[1:30:59] okay here we are two quotes and finish
[1:31:01] page 54 part two the spoken
[1:31:04] word he that Hearth you heareth me and
[1:31:08] he that despises you despises me he that
[1:31:10] despises me despise him that sent me
[1:31:13] that proves that God speaks his message
[1:31:15] through his servants always has that's
[1:31:17] right now the power of the believing
[1:31:20] Church Christ has all power in heavens
[1:31:22] and earth you believe that then what if
[1:31:25] he is in you has Christ got all power
[1:31:29] Matthew 2018 all right he is the seed
[1:31:32] word in his body and he in US becomes a
[1:31:36] seed word in
[1:31:38] us do you understand what we're lacking
[1:31:40] from the early bride Christ himself son
[1:31:43] of man gave them the
[1:31:45] word amen they had the word they
[1:31:48] received all the words and they had the
[1:31:50] seeds and they went in the upper room
[1:31:52] and the water began to gush down
[1:31:54] am seeall so then he came back through
[1:31:58] Malachi 4 to give us the word but it's
[1:32:00] been a process of time over 20 some
[1:32:02] years so many false anointed ones got
[1:32:05] among it and and and then and
[1:32:07] everything and so forth but it came
[1:32:09] right down anyway praise
[1:32:11] God it had to come back to that seed
[1:32:14] word my God and that seed word is Joseph
[1:32:17] Perfection the Capstone that fourth line
[1:32:20] the top of the
[1:32:22] foundation cuz every thing every promise
[1:32:24] is down in there so when that water hits
[1:32:28] it comes
[1:32:29] up GL yes sir it's already in you
[1:32:33] brother
[1:32:35] Roman it's going to be like a Roman
[1:32:37] Candle brother it's going to burst and
[1:32:39] burst and burst and burst my
[1:32:43] God yes sir he is a sea word in the body
[1:32:47] and he in US becomes a seaw word in us
[1:32:49] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:32:51] and all that Christ was he poured into
[1:32:52] the church that's the power now watch
[1:32:55] remember God's law of reproduction now
[1:32:57] remember at this kind the seed of Christ
[1:33:01] the word must come through his body oh
[1:33:03] are you getting tired all right just a
[1:33:04] minute now let's just hold quiet and
[1:33:08] pray I want to get this in real good I
[1:33:10] want this to grind down the seed of
[1:33:12] Christ must must come through the body
[1:33:16] his body not through the nomination but
[1:33:18] through a born again seed of the word
[1:33:20] must come through now the man must be
[1:33:22] born again amen the man must have the
[1:33:24] Holy Ghost before any uh life come
[1:33:27] through there at all so that's been the
[1:33:29] problem in this message many ministers
[1:33:31] without the Holy Ghost they can't bring
[1:33:34] anything they're bringing nothing but
[1:33:36] death cuz there's no seed of life in
[1:33:39] there that man is see you can tell if
[1:33:42] you're little spiritual you go into a
[1:33:44] group and the anointing is there
[1:33:46] Wherever You Preach Seven Seals that's
[1:33:47] the anointing amen then the minister
[1:33:49] comes up there and he don't have the
[1:33:51] Holy Ghost and after while he's going
[1:33:53] good for about 5 10 minutes and banging
[1:33:55] down there and after a while his voice
[1:33:57] gets
[1:33:58] raspy cuz there's no
[1:34:02] oil and he's scratching around and he's
[1:34:04] and then he says say Amen say Amen
[1:34:07] somebody and people getting quieter and
[1:34:09] quieter and quieter cuz they don't feel
[1:34:11] nothing there's no life at
[1:34:16] all see but that man is Anointed my God
[1:34:20] the power's going out the people up on
[1:34:22] their feet sh counting and praising God
[1:34:25] cuz there's life in there that's the
[1:34:29] difference amen so it must come through
[1:34:32] the body hallu now remember what is it
[1:34:35] Christ seed how does my seed come
[1:34:37] through the body how does the apple tree
[1:34:38] seed come through the body seed is
[1:34:40] through through the body and the church

[1:34:43] Bible Church this birth produces that's
[1:34:46] the new birth himself in body his his
[1:34:49] church is his word so that people can
[1:34:51] see the confirmation of Hebrews 13:8
[1:34:54] he's the same y say today and forever
[1:34:55] you believe it these are not
[1:34:56] denominational hybrids this is those
[1:34:59] that was that's in orbit waiting for the
[1:35:02] countdown you know what I mean fixing to
