========================================
[Music] prise hallelu praise thy wonderful praise God so remain standing almighty God Amen we're so happy to be gathered here this morning Amen on this great day and Lord Jesus father this day because to many of us is a sad day just like about 2,000 years ago when you in the days of your flesh when the enemy had cut you down and when you had gone your disciples walked to Earth and also they had sorrow and also they were sad the Lord Jesus the resurrected word of God moved upon the Earth and came and spoke to your disciples and said oh fools and slow heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken Lord God me the resurrection power move in our midst this morning and speak to our hearts that we might say today that we might leave this place saying didn't our hearts burn within us as you speak to us in the upper room Lord God you have S yesterday today and forever we believe this Thy word oh Lord is settled forever in heaven Thy word shall not return void father this is a great

we have a little long message this morning about an hour or so I don't know how long the Lord will lead us but I believe that the holy spirit this morning would be leading this way that we here uh for an understanding for we we come to God's house because because to receive understanding of the word of God we want to greet our dear sister Ellen Clark this morning she's sitting right here like ask her to stand up so you may see her because I'm going to I'm going to read something this morning this is Sister Ellen Clark God bless you she's she came through here by cuz through sister Ruth here and she's the seat of God and she's up in Rochester now and she has now has fellowship with uh the the the Scots up there in Buffalo so they have wonderful Fellowship now so God has a way of putting because putting his people together so but the reason she's here this morning um something that the Holy Spirit laid upon her heart and that something was uh those words which God gave her those words they were used to comfort brother bram's family so therefore because we have it this morning and also we like to read it this morning now uh before we go into the service we have brother Garcia here with us from now in Puerto Rico and just this morning some other eagles walked in here brother a can lar in the back here and also brother orz so brother Garcia he has asked brother huny and myself

brother Garcia this is Brother yes this is brother Al Garcia so may you turn and also face the congregation we hear the elders here now you know this is the Bride of Jesus Christ and though we have different assemblies we're still the same body so if we have the same mind see so if we agree here that this is our precious brother here and we believe that he has a message in his heart so if we we going to lay hands upon him to show that we believ this therefore would you bow your heads as the elders here lay hands up on him praise God would you bow bow your heads with us almighty God as we

praise God hallelujah [Music] God Amen well we thank God to know that there's one thing that we know that this message will never go into a denomination this is the end it can't go no further it's finished with it cannot be denominated God for it's Eagle time amen it is Eagle time amen so brother Garcia may God bless you and send you forth in his power brother Hunt and I we just want to help all we can and we we just join with all our brothers because across the world and I believe as the scriptures will show us today that though many people they don't believe what is taking place right here this morning because in the bride it's going to be that way see whether they believe it or not so therefore um it's strange that on this day that this should take place now um I want to announce that um um the funeral arrangement for for brother Brandon this moment Wednesday or there will be no service because God's Prophet brother brandham they're going to hold a funeral service for him we're not quite sure whether it's Wednesday or Thursday but I was told that it was supposed to be Thursday but it's still tentative so therefore perhaps here there will be some who won't because they you would want to go down there so if please feel because feel free to go if you have the means well then you go see so now um this is far as I understand the funeral Arrangement brother Perry call and told me that that brother Billy Paul and his family that they're leaving Tuesday far as I know this was as of yesterday morning and they're leaving Tuesday and and also a brother called me last night brother Ben Bryant and told me that that the body came in last night at 9:30 and he was out there to meet that body her brother Ben Bryant and they took it to the funeral paa and there he's resting now and so then he's uh they don't know anymore so then uh Billy Paul he told Perry green that don't let anyone see the body until he comes there so therefore the body as far as we know it cannot lie in state until uh because Billy Paul gets there that would be Tuesday perhaps maybe sooner I don't know so then now I understand that that his body is to lay there Tuesday Wednesday Thursday maybe Friday I don't know and also they want to give time for people to come from all over the world to see his body laying there now I understand that the Tabernacle small and that they're going to have a private family service and guest only of the family but the people they'll be allowed to because file through and just look at the remains of the body that's the way I understand it now this could change but as far as I know 30 jday is supposed to be the day we don't know whether it's in the morning whether it's at night or nothing but we haven't heard because they don't know themselves yet so as soon as we hear well then those of you if you want to go you can call us later on and perhaps if we get the message because then we can tell you so but we don't know as yet and we may find out this afternoon if so it will be announced tonight now does everybody understand that am Thursday attentively Thursday and the body will lie in state for about 3 or 4 days far as we we know now brother green told me that he's going that that he plans to have a memorial service out in Tucson that is if Sister media allows a body to uh because be buried out in in the west but seems like Billy Paul that didn't want to be burried in the west but sister brandom maybe because brother brandom said that he wanted to be buried in the East so therefore I don't know so if the body is to be bured in the west brother green he'll have a memorial service sometime in Jan January and there he allow all the brothers to speak and also have because I say a few words over you know and then that would be in January that is if the body goes out there because to be buried so then that would be the next service and that is on condition so that's as far as we know what is going on down in Indiana as everyone understand now amen now um uh we're here this morning we're here this morning it's a sad day in one way but nevertheless God servant he has brought us a promise so for us to understand the very thing that he was to bring us is here now be right at the door for the Rapture of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen so if though it's a sad day is also a joyful day hall for we waited they have all waited in the graves for this day they're now waiting for this to happen now this is the day that Paul and also all wanted to be living in this hour and we are privileged above all people to be living in this hour to see the coming of the Lord hallu his secret coming actually so now um just for about this morning I may be because a little lengthy I don't exactly know what to say CU I'm tired and we've been up all week and no sleep and the phone's been ringing because just about 24 hours of so to speak and we just had time to jot down a few notes so you pray for me that the Holy Spirit would say what he want said this morning for I don't know whether there's anywhere else around in the message this morning that the message is going forth I don't know but I know one thing that most of them are right now down in Indiana so God always has a witness up on Earth amen so brother Hunt and I we want to stand to post and preach the word amen and then Thursday we shall be there God willing so now um I want I just want to go back over his death and say a few things now from last Sunday morning there were a conflicting uh reports so actually I heard that brother brandom never changed since last Sunday but they just said that uh not that that they just said that because that's the kind of report that was given them see so therefore nobody actually knew what was taking place Place really but he was laying there I believe that he was with the Lord so that's neither here nor there though but now last Sunday morning brother Perry green when he was flying into Texas like I said Wednesday I believe it was he saw the moon in the East and also the moon was dark right at the small part of the Moon I'd say about eighth of because about eighth of it it was blood on the moon for the brothers saw this also that was a sign then Wednesday when he was failing and we announced that he had Wednesday night but actually he was dying then and therefore the doctors said to let the brothers go in and they all got together about 25 or 30 out in the waiting room and also all of them prayed and they asked for a sign at that time because kind of Cloudy there and the sun come out bright as an amber color and gave him a sign that was Wednesday after they prayed now Sunday a Friday evening at 549 I understand that the evening star came out brighter than has ever been before it's shine brighter than has ever been up on the face of the Earth and I'm told now that you just have to receive that this is what somebody told me so therefore because whether who said it it doesn't matter but I was told this I was told that through the moon Friday night the moon was setting in the west see last Sunday when a brother green went out there it was in the east then the moon rode a trail across the sky for 6 days and it set in the west out in there sunset Mountain it rolled a trail there was a light right through the moon right through the evening star rather An Evening Star brighter than what has ever been before there was a light through it on either side it rode a trail from the East clean out through the West Amen Let God reveal it to your heart what it means if the evening star rode a trail across the skies it's amazing when and we in our natural Minds try to figure out something isn't it so um a center remarked that uh my isn't that evening star bright tonight it was brighter it was shining brighter in his death when he passed away it shined brighter than it was ever shined before so now we see that so it was said like I said that a trail went across the sky from east to west as Lightning cometh out of the west or out of the East now Sister Ellen Clark she's hand this assembly and she sent down to Sister Ruth some inspired words and and she I don't believe she really knows how inspired these words are so if I'm going to read it to you cuz a brother called me last night and told me he says who wrote that poem up there in New York so if I told him who it was he says everybody knows about it and they're making copies of it amen praise God so therefore brother green told me that out of everything I was said this poem really lifted up William brandom's family this poem here it lifted them all up and gave them Faith so therefore I like to read it now um this brother also so told me last night that there's enough in this poem for him to preach because until the Lord comes amen amen so we know it come right from God Amen and some of you sisters wonder what can I do stay still she's by herself amen she's all alone in Rochester seat of God therefore she wasn't trying to preach God spoke to her heart and she wrote so if you sit still a while God he'll speak to you also amen of Housewives and so forth and you won't have to preach he'll tell you what to do amen praise the Lord so this is the poem is entitled the hush and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour Revelation 81 what is this breath of Silence this hush of expectation a groan a tear a whisper a prayer question mark it is the closing scene of a great drama the time when Spectators wait open mouth gazing at the stage or the play has reached its climax it is the time the fingers of the entranc reader turn to the last page of his novel to find at last the key to the Intriguing mystery it is the hush before the dawn the Stillness before the flower opens and birds begin their song it is the breathless waiting of the eagle soaring high in the a with his eye on a serpent coil on a rock ready to strike this was Wednesday see and the serpent struck Friday but the eagle was soaring high in the a amen it is the hush before the wedding march begins as the bride prepared Waits at the door either your heart has been turned back or it hasn't for when Christ come he is filthy be filthy amen either Elijah has turned your heart back or he has not he's failed as the bride prepared Waits at the door and the eyes of the bridegroom turned to look at her it is the last groan The Last Tear the last whispered prayer of the expectant mother noted sorrow who gives at last all strength she has and brings forth life Joy I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending which is which was and which is to come the almighty that was written by this sister right here in spite of the Holy Ghost so we want to know what can we do for the Lord sit still God will tell you amen praise the Lord so we thank God for that that God allowed it but brother Hunt he called brother Perry we felt led to get this down to brother brandom that somebody May read it to him and brother Hunt he got Perry on the phone and also he wrote it down word for word and and read it to him and also everybody waitting because down the waiting room down there and now brother Ben briyan told me that they want to make up copies and they want to pass it around but she has the rights to it but actually is the holy spirit so I guess it's all right amen praise the Lord so therefore um that was the hush so it really lifted up the family and um oh yes brother green said that it may be read at the funeral service so I don't know you and now notice something very strange about Texas isn't it the pill of fire first appeared in Texas 1950 I believe it was life appeared in Texas President Kennedy was killed in Texas is that right brother brandham was there was a blackout first in New York then in Texas and God's Prophet was blacked out in Texas there was death and life in Texas and now straighted cuz strange now that Johnson is in Texas President Johnson and also want to really come forward and and also helped brother Brandon family Perry Green from down Texas so we don't understand it's all spiritual actually what this means so but God's Prophet was blacked out in Texas New York also had a blackout we all know what that means so all we know is that what these things are on now we understand also that sister meanie last week in the room this week last week that she saw brother brandham and he stood by a bedside there it was a vision and he told her that that I have to go away for a little while because I have to go away but I will be back in a little while at the last Trump Jes this is what I heard a sister had a dream of brother brandham saying these very words and he would be back in the resurrection at the last trumpet amen the death in Christ shall rise first Hallelujah shall walk to Earth for witness on there brother he's living he's not dead but what he wants this morning I believe that some Eagles would stand up and preach the message that he has delivered amen amen so this is a time to look up for your Redemption draweth n amen amen so what does all this mean I do not know but I have been commissioned by to stand up here and feed the flock just like brother Hunt that's what we're trying to do I cannot feed you he must feed you so let therefore I can't feed you let us turn to the word of God let's bow our heads almighty God we pray that the Holy Spirit the dove of God would come down in here father in this sweet anointing in here today let your people know that Among Us breathe upon on your word and make it live in their hearts for they have heard the message dear God now make this message live in their hearts encourage them and may they go out of these doors saying didn't our hearts burn as you came and spake To Us by the wayside we pray in Jesus name amen let us turn to Isaiah 12 do we all understand now what happened down in Texas and what is going on now is anything else God has to reveal it to your heart it's good now you know that a lot of well what did he say and who said that see that should cease now you know just receive a report believe it and go on see it shouldn't matter did John Jones say that or did John Jackson say it it should make any difference what time did he say it was it underline you see me now somebody asked me that question cuz uh because somebody called me and gave me the scriptures that was given to me and then they want to know was that underlined by Brother Bram I don't know I'm telling you now what people want to know see blessed is he that believeth without sin sayeth the scriptures sayeth Jesus Christ in his resurrection Ministry to his disciples Thomas didn't believe he believed after see so you're blessed if you sit here and if you believe the word of God Amen God say so Isaiah 12 and in that day Thou shalt say oh Lord Lord I will praise thee though thou was Ang with me thine anger is turned away and thou and thou comforest me behold God is my salvation I will trust and not be afraid for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song and he also is present tense become my salvation therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of Salvation And in that day this day shall ye say praise the Lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people other words manifested by the quickening power make mention that his name is is exalted sing unto the Lord for he has done excellent things this is known in all the Earth for the trail was written across the sky cry out and Shout thou inhabitants Zion for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee first Thessalonians the 4th chapter [Applause] the 13th verse but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord which we seing here this morning that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the death in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain now notice now we which are alive dead in sins and trespasses only the quickening of power makes your life amen amen amen we which are quickened let us say and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words that's what I'm doing this morning by the grace of God you are to be comforted with these words that you sorrow not even as they in the world sorrow for the joy of your salvation you're going to drink The Waters from the wells of Salvation which is the word of God do you believe that amen that's going on now thank you Lord so now I like to title this the shout of the king it's going to be a shout and we want to and we notice here that that three things are here that is said here that there's a shout that there's the voice of the Archangel and there's a trump of God so by God's grace this is to be explained this morning not by me but by it was explained by God's Prophet when he preached the last message the Rapture of the bride God loves you so much that that he allowed these this Revelation to because to come to us this week so if because we have it this morning and want to give it out to you amen amen comfort with you with these words is the word of God's Prophet his messag amen got to live in your heart now we know that it's a sad occasion like we say God's Prophet brother Braham he's laying because his remains rather was laying down in that funeral PA and I myself I stand here because because through his ministry I met the Lord before because because I heard about him but now I'm I know beyond the shadow of a doubt that I am in the bride amen cuz I receive the word of God which he preached and we know that we have this promise we have the promise for it was promised that before the Dreadful and terrible day of the Lord I will send you Elijah and he will turn your hearts back to the apostolic F amen he will come and reveal all the scriptures seated a serpent Catholic church and all these things tell you who is the White Horse the white horse rider the red horse rider he'll tell you these things see then when you hear these things your hearts will be turned back to the apostolic fathers waiting for the same promise that they have I'll send my spirit upon you in that day you shall know you're waiting for the same thing right now either your hearts have already been turned back or they haven't either Elias is is already come and brought the truth the message to you see or either he would have to be resurrected and start all over again but I don't know the scripture doesn't say that though they are many this morning down Indiana looking for brother brandom to be resurrected they have gathered there from all over and they're there and though we were told that nobody can see the body this morning but they're there so I say if it's God's will for his Prophet to be resurrected then let God's will be done that's what I say but if I have a charge I have a charge and I have to stay there and preach the word in season out of season so now we find then that we have this promise we are to comfort one another with this promise that he will return he said he had to go away to prepare a place for us if it were not so I would not have told you let not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid amen for he said in the same chapter if you believe this then arise and let us go hence Amen to meet the bridegroom is that right that's the scriptures amen so we find then that the word of God is settled forever before the foundation of the world it's not going to change today other words if God did not ordain for his Prophet this morning to rise I don't care if 500 million people are down there it won't change God's will Thy word oh Lord is settled forever in heaven it's already settled but he brings it forth in each age and then the the people are blind this is is the eagle age the age when the Eagles will pick it up by the revelation of the of God what is faith faith is the revelation of God's will then God must reveal his will what we are to do now we find then that three things are said here like I said the Lord himself personal healed his sin but notice his body stays in the air his own because own Corporal body stays in the air but his anointing or his great power comes up on the earth with together with a shout it comes together with a shout we want to find out what is the shout see and then you know what is going to happen so we find then that uh God in this evil age in 1933 when his Prophet who was born a prophet he didn't become a prophet in 1963 he was born a prophet but they're just now trying to figure out is he the prophet is he the Elias which want to come he was born a prophet he was a prophet in God's mind before the foundation of the world see so therefore he was baptizing the 17th person down on the banks of the Ohio and there with about 5,000 people standing around there the pill of fire swung down the Lord himself come down in the form of a pill of fire and boomed out now listen now I'm going to quote God's Prophet because right now brother hun I we have come against many things in the past this week there are people now coming trying to say hold you to every word I'm quoting the word and I'm and also I'm quoting God's Prophet word I ain't saying anything so brother com did not say it see the word says it and I believe the word amen they're trying see there are those who don't know what to say they don't know what to preach and very quickly they will start a denomination see other words what are we all going to do I don't know what you're going to do I'm going to do what he tell me to do I'm going to say what he tell me to say whatever God tells you to say say it and whatever he tells me I'll say that s to me now and I'll say it in faith for I believe it for he's called me to preach this amen amen if I didn't believe it I wouldn't I'd be sitting down there so we find then that in 1933 the evening time light message started in 1933 it didn't just start it started there it was the word His prophets thoughted he was bringing the word so those that received the word from him that was the seat of God and he'll raise him up in the resurrection he'll see all of his friends and there's thousands of them and screamed oh brother brandom that was the word the word born pride of Jesus Christ since 1933 when he began to go out that was the word he preached the word in season out of season and nobody believed in what he was saying just like now you see you can't sit down and say this and that you can only see eye to eye by the eagle anointing amen that's all you can only say eye to eye by the Holy Spirit other words if when brother Brown when he was preaching the only way that if we were up here in New York preaching we would have to say what he said by the Holy Ghost amen that's how you know see if you're saying the same thing you can't wait to get the tape and then play 11 times and then then it's dead then you see but if you've been called you'll say what he's saying it'll be on the table it's in the word see if you preach the word so then the voice boomed out this is the message now which is coming this morning this is part of the message as John the Baptist forun my first coming so shall your message forerun my second coming and you know that we have tried to drive that home to you amen so as John the Baptist in his natural flesh stood before me so shall your written message stand before me when I come with a shout amen but but I will Quicken your written message in many hearts and then they'll know that the King has come with a shout is in their midst and they'll have something to cry about they'll speak Thou Art to Christ for they know in that day for now we know in part we prophesy in part but when the great eego knowing comes you'll know as even he knows you you'll know him for he will be in you the fullness of God in you so we find then where is This Promise found like that Malachi 4 5 and 6 Revelation 10:7 St Luke 17:30 it's found right there in three places so other words it says there in Revelation 10:7 your message will wind up all the Loose Ends from the spirit of man age cuz man tries to figure it out he doesn't really understand it even in this age right now if a man has the Holy Ghost he's Anointed with the Holy Ghost but he has to study and did everything together see and then he go preach a message and also he's anointed see but um when that great inspiration Eagle comes he'll just stand there for the words in him it'll anoint that word out it comes amen amen you see so therefore that's spiritual Revelation on the word of God so therefore your message will wind up the Loose Ends and introduce the Messiah so we know that God's prophet in 1963 three the Lord himself came down in the days of the voice is that right the voice came together with a prophet sign in 1963 see and spoke out the revelation of Jesus Christ that could only be the son of man revealing himself that's all it could be for the son of man has revealed himself down Through the Ages he revealed himself in the bride on the day of Pentecost he revealed himself in Paul arenius St Martin and so forth but in different forms not always the same way see Amen in different forms so therefore we find then that John wound up the Old Testament took all the loose ends for they didn't quite know what was going on who was the word for they had traditions and Commandments of men they had Pharisees and Sadducees and essenes but John the Great Prophet moved on the scene and tied them all up together and then he preached the word the Messiah is at hand he preached the word so then we found that that same Spirit see and John called out an elected group and then the word himself came on and took that group on with the word did and that word be to laying that presence there that right of the son of man reveal himself to his disciples amen so notice now son of man always comes before Son of God son of man is Prophet amen amen son of man Christ brought the message for his hour then he had the seed Jour of life in him for he was the Living Word of that age is that right amen for the anointing came down a sign a dove up on his shoulder there is that right amen and he was anointed with life in his body and he gave out his written word and but it was quickened into his disciples Hearts then the seed lay in their hearts they understand it see they understand that they didn't understand until he came in a resurrection Ministry like we waiting for to open their understanding to the scriptures but they laid there so we find then that that son of man God Prophet introduced the Holy Ghost age then the Son of God poured out himself over those seeds of God in the upper room that started the great Holy Ghost age but he gave a promise he said that in the end time as it was in the days of lot and Noah I will again reveal myself see through a body amen amen amen and that will be the son of man revealing himself again for he must come first before the Lord himself descends with a sh the son of man must come with a promise for this age and call out seeds from all Pharisees and Sadducees is that right Baptist and Methodist and so forth call them all out of there see and then they follow that son of man man Prophet not God Prophet see man Prophet amen see son of man for Ezekiel was called son of man also then he was to take them right up to the Rapture take them right there and preach the Rapture to them and reveal it to them then we don't know perhaps he was supposed to leave the scene some believe it and some don't cuz some are waiting for him to come back for them see but according to your faith be it unto you see me now but what I'm going to say what the scripture says amen no matter what the people believe some were looking for a great tent Ministry and I was told about that that um you can't really tell what the prophet for Prophet speaks in Parables amen amen Jesus did amen why wouldn't Jesus explain it to them that was God himself amen see oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have said MH so then the prophet said many things he purposely says these things cuz that's God's will he's got to say do what his father tell him so he had a series of Visions with a tent and so forth but nobody can say whether it was a symbol what did it mean for he spoke the word he spoke the word right here in this congregation right in the back here on S the Law's Joy amen had no Joy B had to come out he prayed over the phone with me on the phone and he prayed not me other words he spoke the word not me see word has been going on amen amen amen see I mean uh when God does his thing and he put it on Telephone that's why the telephone Ministry came this year so he would announce on the telephone all across the country that the people might know that there's a bride following him every 200 miles he got the message home somewhere he got it home every 200 miles somewhere amen right down in Puerto Rico here down South America over in Europe the message went out spoke the word went out also he said on this uh wings of a white dove if I could tell you the Miracles and the signs that was done in the past three years you wouldn't believe it see so but however Jesus did his things and very very few people saw it very very few saw what he did see so we just don't understand these things so therefore it pays to believe the scriptures amen don't look for some great thing like this here cuz we were fool once before in ' 63 praise the Lord some sisters they wanted to see angels with tempet up in the sky and everything but see it's the word coming forth am so we find then that that uh son of man Prophet God Prophet called out seeds of God from Pharisees and sad J and so forth elected pre destinated seats of God for that hour they were the seat of the hour and he called them out they had to come something inside made he says follow me they didn't say what was it underlined you follow me now they didn't ask no questions they followed him what tape was that on he didn't mean that he said this over here he said say what I said that's what he said is that right don't change what I said cuz you have not been ordained to change it only the Eagles are they understand it and they'll preach it they'll feed the flock see the Eagles will so we find then that the son of man then was to bring a message what is a message a message is the thoughts in God's mind for that age and then that message when come out is the word for the age then message word came by Christ son of man he revealed himself how with a sign is that right pill fire he told Nathaniel behold an Israelite indeed in whom there is no God whence thou knowest me Rabbi I saw you I saw you you see so we saw another son of man come do the same thing thousands of times still they don't believe it but he did it amen amen so then we find then that that son of man had a message the word not to be spoken to individually see but to believe all that the prophets have said amen the scriptures believe the scriptures then that was a message that message was the word of God that was the word the word of God that was God himself amen then we find in that Christ was God's seed message now notice this now listen to what I'm saying very carefully now Christ the word was God's seed message but that seed message did not live in the heart yet it was there until it was quickened by the Holy Ghost Amen on the day of Pentecost are you beginning to understand it now amen but that message was in their hearts for they was restored am they was restored from the fathers to Little Children amen is that right amen he went to all the old traditions and got out some children and they was restored John did that amen then John said I must decrease as he increases but he had to preach marriage and divorce before he left the sea amen it's in the scriptures so then we find then that Christ was God's seed message but it did not live in Hearts until it was quickened by the spirit then we find what did the spirit do the Holy Spirit did the following the Holy Spirit In Jesus Day called out the seeds of God from different denominations is that right call them out then it preached to souls in prison then signs followed the message word Jesus the word had signs following him just like today see raise the Same Spirit raise Christ from the dead see if it be in you it shall also Quicken your mortal body and Resurrection also made Christ live for 40 days 40 is a judgment are we going into the Judgment huh then it came when they died out it came on them for power for service amen the spirit of God did Same Spirit that was up on Christ that same anointing he was the original corn of wheat he abided alone as long as he walked Earth himself that would be the only fruit amen but first fruits go back to God for it's a law in Leviticus 23 am amen back to God it must be offered back to God then the first mature corn of wheat must be cut down bruised battered and be offered back to God that the Holy Spirit might come back up on the seeds of God that was called out of all denominations that are waiting on a promise for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the archangel it's Eagle time what are you looking down for look up rise let us go hence look up we were promised a message for today amen did we receive the message did it go forth in 1933 was it Vindicated before the whole world Amen in 1963 when the pfy the Lord the voice of the seventh angel when the V when each angel came down in the room there and the pillow fire and spoke out the white horse riders the pope you follow me now amen you see me now then the then then the prophet preach the unveiling of the Mighty God God before you reach the promised land god comes down and reveals himself in human flesh amen he did it with Moses amen as a sign amen that we're on a way to restore Faith we're going to the promised land de with Abraham also I want to prove that so then what has transpired today call therefore the word message has call out seeds by the word how did it do it the son of man reveal himself today that right stood right there and call out the secrets of their hearts amen but a prophet when he's doing it always speaks hint for he says he will come and do it while he's doing it amen see they now amen then it go over top of their hands they miss it then they say what where where where he just did it amen cuz he called our brother Hunt say your name is Mr Hunt and you praying for your sister she has asthma and he says I'm his friend he called me his the Holy Ghost called me his friend am so therefore can't nobody get in between us amen with different tales and things don't try it for God called his friends in Tabernacle he said that's Mr Coman your friend and his father had a stroke as thus sayith the Lord amen then I couldn't hold it back I had to let it go am on to tape that God I had to shout for it was revealed to me who it was amen so then we know we see then that this promised word Malachi 4 had life to it it was anointed and that's what made us turn the life in him see made you turn to that word if you could be sitting anywhere and hear a tape and hear the prophet on a tape you say that sounds real that's differ amen that's life speaking to you that's God revealed in human flesh speaking to you that's why God himself speaking out of human flesh revealing to your heart he said I'll turn your heart back before that your heart was in some old dead Pentecostal church somewhere am right but he said I'll come and restore your heart back to the word message did he do it amen are you sitting here amen he must have done it amen amen you don't know how close the Rapture is so then we find then that the seed germ in the prophet was imparted To Us by the written word right for the hour and we received it but we just can't get that power amen we want to pray in the spirit we want to preach with power we you want to you can't do it can you see me now you're waiting to be quickened it must be quickened first amen all the scriptures must be fulfilled CH amen you see a corn of wheat must be cut down by the Lord bruised and so forth and offer back up to God on the wings of a snow white dove don't miss that amen so therefore we find that afterwards when the message come Malachi 4 then the message must live to be quickened for the body is dead right now that right this body is dead the body of Christ is dead the body without the spirit is dead the spirit hasn't come yet cuz it's just laying there asleeping giant now the the scripture says that it's laying there amen sleeping that's right so we find in that the dead body the spirit of God make it live but God has a law for in St John 16 he told him that because because use a parable it us a natural woman that when she is to because in travail that she must have sorrow first amen see she had a sorrow when he died the corn of wheat died she had a sorrow but he rose from the dead the third day is that right then she had joy for at the end of the third day the third day started in the end time in 1906 that right amen he was the same yesterday today and forever he told those cuz he told Mary and them there ktha and them there go tell my brethren that right amen well he appeared in theza Street in 19 six go tell my brother that I live I speak in tongues and once to heal a sick see dreams and Visions it came forth in 1906 that right am amen but just go tell them that I'm the same yesterday today and forever that was the message that's all they had you see me now but in the evening time at the end of the third day he walked through the walls that's just time now amen amen it's in this hour now great power is going to be loose up on the earth Resurrection see right through the walls he just told him touch me not you can't handle me now but you go tell them that I'm the same yesterday today and forever but at the end of the third day the Eagles can handle the word touch me handle me feel me amen amen at the end of the Third Day St John 20 I believe is whatsoever you bind shall be bound in heaven whatever you loose shall be loose in heaven amen so then we find but the body must live Abraham's a type he's the father of the faith that right amen now notice now God appeared in many forms to Abraham voices light and a man that right well God appeared to you Abraham's seed and Luther and Wesley and all of those in many forms too he appeared as a blade amen he appear as a tassel yes as a husk and now he's appearing as a seed amen that is waiting to be quickened by the Holy Ghost amen that right but now let us go back to the scriptures and we have to type this out see because it's in the word amen amen so it's in the evening time when Sodom was just about just about to be burned two angels had gone down and delivered their message to lot the worldly Church those who believe the message now listen now get this now Abraham the prophet was called out of the world with lot he didn't tell lot but lot came along with him but God didn't tell him to bring lot but lot came you get he wasn't predestinated to go into bride but he came anyway he saw the signs you know sort of healing but he come so therefore when another Abraham Prophet come lot came also follow him in the wilderness amen live in the world did all kind of Filth still doing it see man and didn't believe it and they still doing it see me now but they had to come but the elected seat of God those women stopped cutting the head right away seat of God they listen to their ministers right away seat of God see me now so therefore to prove it lot could not stay with Abraham for his congregation argued with Abraham's congregation they always do the worldly ones will always argue with you if you're trying to holy if you're always trying to do the will of your father am they'll Purge you out that's right they have to do it they ordained to do that amen so therefore take no thought just let them sit there and let them keep talking let them keep want to do what they want to do just let them go on let them curse you God has bid them to do it to purge you to make you a little sweeter Amen to take it out of your wash it in the water to wash you that washing machine they do it in the house of God where at in in God's house they do it unbelievers make Believers sit right in God's house not the man outside he don't bother you out there he doesn't even know you is that right those in God's house do it see so therefore and they they hate you if you believe that word oh they they don't they that's much see so then we find then that at that time Abraham he he was called out Sarah is a type of the Bride she was part of Abraham amen amen not a lot see amen Sarah was part of Abraham and Sarah had her unbelief in the beginning and so did we right now amen amen but she was part of God therefore God could not take Sarah that's right though she disbelieved amen that right Abraham he believed he's a prophet he believed right away I'm going to visit you in the time of life you're going to have a son Sarah laugh through unbelief me old woman have a son why did Sarah laugh through what happened there here's what happened we found out that God appeared he had already appeared to Abraham now in different forms down through the seven Church ages right amen as as Abraham came out of the world and so forth but at this time in the evening time see right at the time Sodom and gomorra was to be burned the two angels they went down all Roberts and also Billy Graham delivered their message and lot still can't come out he has no testimony to his family see me now when it came time to go his family did not believe him for he was living in the world he had no lost his testimony he went backwards but Abraham was pressing on outside of Sodom just like you today you have come out all things of the world Abraham see Abraham if you love it liot see so we find then that those two Messengers could not get lot out it wasn't until God himself came up on the earth and spoke to lot come hither see it was the time when lot finally got his little city zor just one let me break one little word God I don't want to go to the mountain say just repent repent repent the prophet crying is that right there was a dream there was two dreams one by Junior Jackson Another by because of by sinner woman she saw a little man repent repent repent repent and next thing she know because it was a long prayer line and thundered and God spoke out this is Jehovah God and Jackson he had the same dream so then lot was warned come out see but he said escape to the mountain lot I don't want to go to the mountain I want to go to zor I want a little city I got to do one I must cut my ha See I well I must I must do this this little thing I got to do it see I mean now elction that's all I can tell you but at that time the sun was up on the earth it rose on the earth when that happened judgment fell the fire fell we are waiting now the prophet has warned us all things are ready that right Make Ready the fire is ready to fall fire of the Holy Ghost first I want to be baptized with fire Holy Ghost and Fire amen some don't amen anyway I do I want to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire amen amen so then we find then that at that time God had appeared in many forms now but in the evening time he did something strange there was a prophet and there was a bride Eve God just before Abraham received the promise God Elohim Jehovah appeared in human skin and revealed himself because of his bride Abraham that right am that's one thing he appeared in human skin see in human flesh so that's a that's one sign then in the end time we must look for the same sign the Bible says it will be St Luke 17:30 that right do you believe that amen well it happened we then we had to see God appearing in human skin and speaking the word of God to you revealing all the Mysteries to you did you miss it did it go over your head God the mighty unveiling of the Mighty God Amen son of man Prophet God and going to be in your skin in a little while amen it's going to be God speaking out of you s just like him do you believe that there it happened with Moses too just before he went to the promise all right it happened to Abraham just before he received the promise God in human skin appear to Abraham why human skin so that you would know that it could happen again amen that's why amen amen that's why it was human skin it had to be it was word skin that was me a mezic skin if you know what I mean word skin see by the word you formed by the word you're God's word express here in the flesh all right for this hour to believe his word amen you have to be you in his mind you're part of God therefore you are justified in his sight you have never done nothing right that's what he said amen what he said he he never saw those of you who believe the word amen see so therefore the first sign before Abraham reive the promised son Isaac God had to appear in human skin now the next thing after he received the promised word the Angels they were down in Sodom lot was down there he couldn't get out see right at that time the next thing that happened just before Isaac come a great power come a quickening power to change Abraham's body it was dead did you get that amen the body was dead amen amen so it had to be quickened changed resurrected if you get what I mean I hope you get that amen amen Romans 8:11 if the spirit of God that raised up Christ from the dead be in you it shall all so Quicken your mortal bodies amen so therefore there was Abraham the believer his body was dead he couldn't bring forth no life but he was the body amen he was the mechanics of the word of God but needed some life to produce the seed that right amen so then a great power came and changed Abraham and Sarah's body and they went back they were resurrected back to the way they were young people and Abraham lived on and also had because he had more children amen way after that that right amen amen so we find then that if we ought to see to Abraham we look for the same promise we are to look for God appearing in human skin we ought to look for a great power that shall descend from heaven with a shout to change our minds transform our bodies everything Quicken us make us alive make us seeds of God that will live on the earth amen as a witness out here that he's the same yesterday today and forever are you following me am amen this is the message amen it hasn't changed you know it's the same message amen so therefore today the body is dead but it will be quickened for the word of God says comfort you one another with with these words this is the promise you are to be quickened amen amen thankes are you tired amen praise God Amen brother Brown he had three PS Amen brother Russell he had three pools now now watch this now today they say well a brother ROM he must be raised from the dead see because he must ride the trail one more time and also he's Elijah to come see he hasn't come yet now see he hasn't restored anything back Seven Seals was nothing oh my so therefore this is I'm the holy spirit is showing to you to see how stupid it is this anointing here shown it to you so other words they're saying he must come to ride the trail he must be Elijah coming for what happened back there ' 63 what's all the shout about back there what is the books the tapes hanging up on the cross for being crucified huh amen a messenger with a message must first die for it to be in effect amen they all seal their testimony with blood now notice now watch this now those Mexicans were Roman Catholics am amen amen did you get that they were Roman Catholics so therefore amen that's why we have the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord so therefore they were Roman Catholics so therefore a Roman Catholic drove his car into God's Prophet Amen in Texas so we find then that that God gave his Prophet three pulls three pulls he himself if you want it now I'm quoting it's on tape sir what is the time and many other tapes he told you on there cuz you hear it that his message his first message his first pull rather was healing and th that was the little birds that right little veterans amen and they were in the shape of a pyramid these little veterans that right those little vetetans were worn out but brother Brown was tired he was on the field around the world except he was tired but notice now the veterans where he saw him from flew Eastward they flew back Eastward the next one was doves but it was not white doves it was gray doves that was the second pull that was his prophecy he was preaching de seed The Serpent and all these messages and so forth that was the word of Goden God came down and the Seven Seals and Vindicated it to it was thus sayth the Lord amen but it was still word back then in 51 52 by a prophet for he when he was born a prophet he went forth with the he was Vindicated years ago he was Vindicated before the whole world around the world on wi service by a pillar of fire amen I don't know what they were waiting for he was already Vindicated already but only the seed can come amen see that was the second pull the doves these are these were great doves and they flew Eastward now we all waiting where the the third pull at it's the third pull wait for that third pull well he said on the tape that the next thing come first the little birds then the doves gray ones the next thing he saw for his new message his third pull was seven angels is that right when when did they come are they to come or did they come before huh did the seven angels come to commission him for his third pool Ben and three or they too come you figure it out I'm saying what's on the tape that's all don't quote me now I'm only saying what's on that tape sir what is the time take it down amen amen so therefore seven angels had to come to commission him for his third pull amen where only life and death how only the word judges did the word come down and judge amen amen did the word come down himself self the pill of fire reveal the seven seeds amen was the Lamb's Book of Life thrown open for you since 1963 sitting right here did it happen amen well he threw open the book and you saw your name in there and here you come running am amen but the lamb opened the book up not the lion the Lion's coming see so okay first there was a blast shook the Earth and brother Brandon was standing out in the mountain looking Westward and he said that the angel stood this way and also counted them but that one over on the corner over there was a mighty angel that was a swep back wings that was the the angel that was God himself so therefore only six Angels Came Down Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday and six of them come down and reveal the seals to him the other the seventh angel he didn't come yet that's the coming of the Lord amen see he he's the one that comes down in Revelation 10 and stands up on the earth both feet not he he cries on the earth not up in heaven on the earth go back to the dream Jackson's dream he saw God's Prophet at a at because a long prayer line but a Dove came in and took him on the wings of a snow white dove before the Thunder h a tape so therefore it said it thundered what he said now it thundered and a voice said this is Je God but when you get a dream Jackson's dream back in ' 62 it all didn't come together yet he but he had the whole thing there but it didn't come to pass right then did it had to wait for it to come to pass amen so therefore um the Bland took the Earth looking Westward a constellation like a pyramid come see and the power of God lifted brother Bram up into this pyramid and there the seven angels of the lord gave him his new commission go back Eastward and reveal the Seven Seals it went around the whole world in Life magazine and so forth the signs and that sign went up into the sky that right and formed into a cloud oh can we have have we happen to have it this morning because I don't think that some didn't see this here now notice now I better read the scripture here I want to say everything right here make sure it's correct this is a strange time right now when you're being quoted and everything amen praise God Amen so I'm reading from Revelation 5 the 9th verse amen amen amen praise the Lord after this I beheld and low a great M I'm reading from seven and uh I'll read from the first verse Revelation 5 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals I saw a strong Angel proclaimed with a loud voice who is worthy to to open the book and to loose the seals thereof no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to even look at it these Seven Seals and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and loose the Seven Seals but now when he looked the lion did not open it see had he opened it it had been judgment and I beheld and low in the midst of the Throne of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as has been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits and God sent forth he came and took the book and out the right hand of him that set it set upon the throne now we find in that down in the 13th verse that John is praising and blessing God is that right he's making noise and there have people today who don't want you to pray loud you can't now when John his name in that L's Book of Life he made some noise amen yet today you can't even hardly sing nowhere something's wrong somewhere here what he said blessing honor glory power be unto him that Seth on the throne I say the same thing I got something to shout about for the lamb opened the book amen my name was in there amen thank you Lord there's the lamb see the lamb see that sweet little lamb lamb there the nose the ear here the face mouth that's the lamb right up here the seven Angel here's the eagle I want to show it to you here so therefore natur this is the Christ that's the sign of the son of man in heaven now notice now in 62 brother Bram said that Elijah would probably point to the sky screaming Behold the Lamb of God that right that the sign of the of the sun man up in the heavens did he point to the sky in the Tabernacle last Easter morning that's right when he put it up like this here he did point to the sky he did all right but we wanted him to be out in Tucson somewhere up on a mountain on Sunset mountain and all certain ones just certain ones be there only their own denomination yes Amen brother just old see nobody over in Europe nowhere or Africa Australia but just a certain few people that say he's the words they'll be up on the mountain then he would tell them he scream out Behold the Lamb of God he didn't do it that way he did through the word see for if the spirit of God be it shall also Quicken your moral body in the resurrection amen amen God's got one here two there all over the world see don't ever make a denomination out of the word of God and brother hun and I we are strong upon that today see me now why for the prophet the Lord has passed on and many now are screaming oh brother brand the cloud took him West see it's gone therefore they screaming out what shall we do see let us all let us do nothing let the Eagles go forth Amen Let the spirit of God anoint the Eagles and send them out that's right then the eagle can be in Africa Australia Canada but they'll see eye to eye amen for Christ himself the word will come down himself and search out his sheep through a fful Ministry he'll do it great power amen you tired no amen prise God we're trying to get this message out this Mage Revelation 10:7 tells us in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall only begin start to sound when he just moves on begin to open the seals up the mystery should be finished amen is that right amen I mean it really should be finished after all it was the church was lost we had no vision of the end time the Baptist said that because they were right Pentecostal everybody was right all right what we needed was a vision of the end time Daniel said shut up the words all right SE up the book until the time of the end that right in the end time when knowledge shall be increased they shall fly to and fro run to and fro at that precise time I will open the seals but the lamb will do it the lamb will open up the seals reveal to you that his Prophet is a judgment sign see and the next voice Shout you'll hear will be the Messiah speaking this is Jehovah God the next voice you'll hear for a prophet sign laid down there in Texas and the evening star rolled a trail across the skies that right amen we still don't understand it so then his message it says here was to finish all the Mysteries all these things that they had proved at down through the ages for when the first seal broke Paul called he was a prophet he knew that it was something he didn't know that it was a Roman Pope though see cuz he hadn't started yet but Paul knew it was something so he caught it and said the mystery of an niqu do already work amen he prophesied it was already working in a spirit form see me now so how greater is William brandom when he told you who it was amen thousands of visions and and spoken words and everything he's already done it already I don't know what you're waiting for I'm waiting on the coming of Lord for he's turned my heart back for the promise that he'll come and he's even on the way amen I know it so his message was to finish a Mysteries and introduce the Messiah with the restored word is the word restored back amen he can't come unless the word is there that's what the Pentecostals believe they believe that they can go on and sin and they'll be C and meet them in the a amen it's not going to happen that way so the word had to be restored first did he restore the word that's up to you see I can't tell you that restored in my heart amen so how did he do it the lamb did it he opened the Seven Seals is that right the lamb restored the word back to the bride now the bride has a prophetic Vision she knows judgment coming and sa fire three weeks ago brother Perry Green in his church he asked brother Bram to come and speak he said no I won't say nothing he says that but I want to say this that in the churches today the Lord's Supper is only a tradition people come P full of sin amen and take the Lord's Supper he said but that won't be long he said there's going to be the Holy Spirit among you it will call out the anas and the Safar we and brandom said that out in Tucson Tabernacle so he said that not me he said that cuz the Bible says that that's why he said that see he said there will be a great power among you and it'll be Jesus Christ himself I believe God himself am amen that's what you're looking for you're looking for God to come down into this assembly and speak out amen speak out in here others are looking for something else now they don't want no kind of order all God get told us to do was to go back there to New York and just preach the word take this church order put those Spirits in subjection to order cuz God's house you got to have order in it so that's why we have church order here because the seeds of God they love it they love to be in order they love to listen to all the deacons and everybody they love that that's the seed of God but the rebellious Spirits from time to time rebuke them and let them know that you're in Authority there amen before all sometimes if they sin That Others May fear it's the word but now you preach like that who you think you are anyway did Brother Brown say that over there Bible says he's the word amen they won't understand you but whether understand or not preach the word in season out of season be constant all the time they won't understand they look for him to be resurrected somewhere see me now but they won't know my people the daughters of Jerusalem was wailing against the wall that right he was right there are they wailing right now against the walls right now doors of Jerusalem they're wailing up against the Wailing Wall there same thing all over again the daughters are wailing you see they just can't take those ministers something I don't know about it but anyway so therefore the the Seven Seals restored the word to the bride a prophetic Vision all the Mysteries are finished already he said so that when he begin to sound he finished Mysteries except marriage and divorce right away right and everything which came forth from there came from the Seven Seals from the lamb see and that's why John said blessed and shoutings and honor and Glory everything the seeds of God love to sing they love to shout they love to everything they praise God Amen let every that have a voice praise ye the Lord what are you looking down for look up for your Redemption draw now amen so now we find that John he had to preach marriage and divorce he had to decrease God's Prophet had to decrease that Christ might be increased Rome because killed the prophet same thing today is Roman is a Roman Catholic so we understand we now have the restored prophetic word message where at in our hearts for Elijah restored It to Your Heart Right but it's laying there for Christ restored the word to Peter James and John in them didn't he but it laid there until the resurrection came amen and the resurrection is the rapture is that right so we're looking for the Rapture in the resurrection you must must be resurrected first for we're dead the body this body is dead need to be changed then when it's quickened it'll be quickened to every word every word this mind will be transformed see me now amen that's that power that you're looking for right now if I can only pray 15 minutes if I can only go on if I can only stop being so mean see Power is coming but on the seat of God for there'll be anointed ones at the end time who still do the same thing baptize in the Holy Ghost God's Prophet said so that woman said I can walk up those three steps he said he said no you can't she walked up there with high he shoes on click click click click and she began to walk down a narrow way it got narrow and narrow and narrow and she fell off you can't walk it you walk in God's way that's right there's a way there's a highway and there's a way and the way is called Holiness those very high heel shoes like that there because because tips them over and they go along tinkling as they go Daughters of Zion see me now and God's Prophet preached that and they mad and because it mad against them but however the that message that he preached is living in some of the daughters of Zion's Hearts today we have some right here living in their hearts amen you believe at them praise God Amen praise the Lord so we have the restored prophetic word message where at in the book in our hearts amen it needs to be Quicken though it's going be quick so therefore I believe that my heart has been turned back amen I don't know about your heart now see but my hands see me now that's what I believe see be it unto you according to your faith amen don't quote me see I said what I believe that's me see now the worn out messenger cried to go home on wings of a snow white dove now that happened we heard it here on Telephone he read uh Psalm 55 if you if you read it at all in the spirit you see what he was trying to say there he's tired 40 years he's been sick people were prayed for right in front of his face and God never healed him all right he had a little six he had SE like a little furry animal in a vision in his stomach and he was sick brother Brandon was sick suffered for 40 years 40 years is a judgment too so therefore he had a message though before he could go home now he on that tape he told a story about a little Dove and a dove is a sign right is also a sign of Peace you see it's useful a Sign by Noah and also it was useful for Jesus Christ and so therefore it symbols peace and now um God's Prophet had told his story about I think it was World War I and how this was a carrier pigeon see but he had a message because to deliver and the enemy saw him and they began to shoot at him and also his wing was clipped you see a part of his back shut out and so forth but he kept on going he was bruised and vanished but he was going home see to and he got the message home and fell on the floor now the the the little birds was going Eastward after the first pull that right then the dob the next pull these uh doves they flew Eastward after the seven angels God's Prophet was coming Eastward to Jeff that right to he was bruised he was bannered he was tied he was worn out and little didn't he know as he passed through Texas but he had to go that way you see for there was blackout in Texas there and there he was killed God's servant that right so we find then that why is that we don't know we try not understand today what does it all mean see but it means something but we know this that he had a message since 1933 amen that right and he preached the word for God gave him many visions that he would pluck fruit from both sides jesus' name and also trinitarians he would take the fruit from both sides a plum tree and also apple tree and he got the fruit that right he got them amen his message got the fruit and then his uh I should say his crowning message the third pool when he was to reveal the Bible it was revealed well then he got that message out it went out this is the called out Age first you had the mar age then you had the reformer age then the lamb comes opens the book up and calls out his people see in now therefore the prophet got his message out and then he was going back he said the next major mess on my heart is a tracing the serpent seed is that right but now he got the message out but now there's some people now you got to be very spiritual here some people s now he said himself that he had three PS and I just named them little birds gray doves and seven angels that was his signs to him for history PS but there's another sign of Eagle then if that was to him also that would be a fourth pull wouldn't it well you decide how many PS was he supposed to have is that right he was supposed to have three pulls they all had three pulls so now if he was to have a fourth pull that would be the eagle so here was he waiting for 33 years preaching the word in season out of season reveal the whole Bible see me now then at the end there he was out in the desert and now he began to say that he wants to preach to see to the serpent to tell how it started in the beginning that right around about that time seed of the serpent was preached somewhere in the country amen see me now so the prophet it was told to him you know oh yeah it was told to him see so he just smiled he was happy for he knew that an eagle caught it in the spirit so now he was happy see it's time to go home now so he's sick and he's tired through 40 years his stom and so forth and and all you know out there in Arizona there finally up there it's on the tape um it's on the tape now wings of a snow white dove see he went now his mother she said now all of her dreams have come to pass but something that we all missed I believe because I know I did anyway so uh his mother she had a dream I think I had I took down part of it here you hold just hold on a minute oh yes his mother had a dream and uh it's on the tap and he said that she saw six doves in the shape of an S because come down right and also went back now she saw him sick laying there about to die did you get that there amen it was on the tape she saw her son brother brandham sick and dying dying see he wasn't shot now but he was dying see but then he quickly said because my stomach you know so uh it's a prophet see speak some Parables but that was said see so then um also saw a little 6inch furry animal that that right slid down the stroke see now he said that that was man's suffering number six is man's number see but then he was promised one day that I'll show you a sign it'll be the seventh White Dove where it be at the Lord God he'll provide his own sacrifice right he provided a ram to Abraham way out in the middle of out in the wilderness on a mountain that right he provided a ram that's a signed to Abraham way out there in the wilderness so God's Prophet said himself that he was up in the mountain and there I think it was in October right through there he saw a white dove that white dove was Snow White it was wasn't gray see man it was Snow White then he knew what that meant see all right that meant that he would finally be healed now he had his three PS now I'm not saying he's supposed to have a fourth P I didn't say that but he had his three PS he was tired he was worn out for 40 years he preached the word there see but he was sick and that's the year of the Judgment see that's number of the judgment and there he was waiting see when he that sign uh because he shouted and then he come back again and he was praying there the holy spirit says look up over your heart and over his heart there was CV in the Rock written in the Rock White Eagle see and then uh that eagle flew he saw an eagle fly in a vision of something so therefore Dove Holy Spirit first then Eagle now this another sign now different message I'm going read what he said he said he knew knew he would see the seventh Dove and also at the same time he saw that little furry animal hanging on a branch all right in October he saw all three together that right so that little furry animal hanging on a branch right okay he saw wrot written a stone White Eagle just exactly the vision said the next message would come forth by now I don't know what that means but that's on the tape see I wrote it down exactly as I heard it he saw the a white eagle flying just exactly that what the vision said the next me the next message would come forth by rode in the Rock but the dove was first then was the eagle then he said in the prayer I imagine it is finished see I'm going to be well signed from above for the dove was a sign to no when he come back I think with the olive uh Branch there that it was peace after the Waters of judgment that right Noah and his family finally they had peace and safety on dry land but the dev was assigned to them of peace is that right and then Christ he come down and the dove appeared a sign and he gave us his peace that right now brother brandom that seventh Dove was a signed to him of Peace for he read out of Psalms 55 on the wings of a snow white dove that right he wanted to take a flight from here on the wings of a snow white dove and nobody know what he's talking about you see you're not supposed to so therefore brother Jackson had a dream and brother Brandon walked down there just exactly like something was going to happen it did but we didn't know what happened you see me now and we expected cuz he said Jackson saw brother Jack Mo's church he saw the church and everything and brother brandom had a long prayer line that right did he have it and he wanted all the old times who started out in the very beginning and they were there Jack more all them were there that right but in Jackson's dream at the end of that prayer line a dove flew through the window see and took him home you see because took him but the dove come in the window but then also right after this long prayer line it thundered and a voice said this is Jehovah God that was in the dream so the people was expecting for it to thunder in treport and a voice speak out this is Jehovah God but it didn't happen you see the me now amen it didn't happen that way another woman saw the same dream she saw a little man running in the streets repent repent repent and then it thundered and a voice this is Jehovah God same dream almost so therefore what does that mean I'm not going to tell you CU I don't know but if if it has been preached then you understand see me now so therefore he also said it is finished I'm going to be well it's a sign from above that I have peace at last the seventh Dove was assigned to me to him but then at the same time he was batted and bruised but he saw an eagle amen he knew it was the eagle age he know the Eagles can fly high in the spirit they'll take the message they may Kill the Messenger and seal his message with blood but the message will live on for the Eagles can pick up that message and preach that word in season out of season the same way rebuke with all longsuffering call out the sin and whatever the God tells the eagle to do he'll do that he'll do what the what God tells him to do the Eagles Why for he knew that the Eagles would have to start in Genesis amen see the serpent tell it how it all started he know the eag would pick it up amen he would just smile if you Happ to hear about it amen so uh what can I tell you you have to be spiritual so we find then that he said also that Noah sign of a dove it was a messenger dou is a messenger comeing to tell them everything is all right and also he says uh he now he's praying he says you gave no a sign you gave the world a sign he gave us a sign also the world see that it was peace with him see and you gave me a sign and the next day this is in praying seeing that eagle flying oh God there is a message coming forth now I pray that you will let the Holy Spirit of lead lead me to a faith send down a message could send a message if you could send a message because to knowing John send it to me can send it to others on the wings of a dove the faith the wounded dove has brought the message back that's what he said the wounded dove has brought the message back and it flapped out but the message got home am did it get home in your heart then if it's in your heart if God has restored it to your heart it will live when the quicking power strikes it it's the word of God Amen so we find then that the wounded dove has brought the message back and he cried out oh God is finished just give us Faith to believe it and then he said a few other words and so forth up and so forth and around the country and like that you know so therefore Noah search for lamb Amen brother Frank caught that there so the dove Spirit of the Holy Ghost to give Faith he said Lord let the Holy Spirit Dove flutter into our hearts to give us that Faith see me now that He restored the word the mechanics that came back amen you have the faith in that word don't you you're waiting for the quickening power for he has restored you back to that word but Christ must take you on now yes amen only Christ can take your arms don't dare follow a man follow the message amen then you won't have any sorrow today you won't run around the country nowhere if you follow the man if you follow a man you'll be down right now but if that word of God is abiding in your heart abide in me and I'll abide in you and in that day if you keep on abiding I'll Keep On Blessing I'll keep on sanctifying You Keep On Believing and I'll fill your hearts in that day I'll Quicken your m B if you do but if you just believe in a man's flesh for in that same dream of his mother it said that at the time he was dying he was building a house on the hill he never went into his home amen amen that was in her dream years ago when he was laying there dying there was a house being built on a hill you see so he never got there so we find out that that these so he also he said said this let this be a memorial prayer line for the sick in honor of the old days it can be done again that was on the tape there so then we find then that the Seven Seals restored the prophetic Vision to the bride the bride has it now in her heart and that message will live by the Great Eagle anointing for there's a power coming up on the earth that's going to change you amen amen it's going to change you see so therefore now whether our hearts have been turned back to the message I don't know see because it's supposed to be unbelievers make Believers and Believers in same congregation but one day there's a great power coming in to we them out but see he'll do that not me don't root up the tears let him sit there preach feed the flock amen that's tonight praise God so therefore the one out messenger amen am the one out messenger cried out to go home on wings of a snow white dove did he do that there that's what he wanted he began to sing it on the wings of a snow white dve that right he sang it and sang it and sang it and sang it and we didn't know what in the world he's talking about see so he was baded bruised and went on so now we find then that uh God's prophet he cried out for deliverance spoke about that he knew that he was to see a sign of a dove the seventh dove it's a sign of Peace his mother's dream I spoke about that so then we find also he said that he had seven eights seven changes seven eights 56 years old he had to have a change is right that's what he said amen and also how strange the dove sign the know I spoke about that um brother Brandon was going home the Roman Catholic I went through this here so want I want to catch something um s White Dove R in stone went through I've been preaching not C off the notes Here If I skip over it so then we find then that he saw the eagle flying and he knew that if he could get that message home that God would pick up that message in some hearts Quicken it make it live for the age see mean now there's certain predestinated seeds of God that received a message but can't do anything see they must wait on I say wait on the Lord Isaiah 40 then they'll Mount up with wings as Eagles is that right they'll run they won't be worried in you'll walk and you won't faint in God's time that is coming so we find out then that something I wanted to say here oh yes that notice this here the past four years Rome has had a dialogue with the whole world watch this now but its Works was finished in December of 1965 is that right God's prophet he came with a dialogue to the bride his work was finished in December 1965 right the pope said it last week the seed sown by by the counil must now be cultivated what he said and we know that there's a demonic power that's going to come upon on the earth and cultivate that seed swn by Rome among the image to the Beast and all the churches that right they going to have a quickening power also they going to draw them together against the bride but we also know that there's going to be a great power among God's seeds and God's seeds will be cultivated by the spirit of almighty God so we find then that just before brother brandham signed off so to speak that he preached a Rapture out in and Rialto now the bride want to know why did he go there and preach it why did he come to Jeffer somewhere he has to follow his father amen but let us turn over to uh second Peter 3 this is what he preached out there be about five minutes are you understanding the message Amen brother Brandon preached on the rapture before his death among scoffers second Peter 3:3 knowing this verse that there shall come in the last day scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things contined as they were from the beginning of the creation Now the promise of his coming was tied up in Malachi 4 that right so he went after he preached the wings of a snow white dove out to Yuma and announced it at a banquet and I'm told that they were smoking there they were saying hurry up come on get through there that's right they were scoffing but the scripture say he had to preach it there he had to preach the promise of the coming among the scoffers and he also held up the tape see but and he he used Psalms 275 if you want to take it down and second Peter 3 3 and 4 that's what he used and that's what he preached on two messages so we heard that uh we all heard that the Rapture would take place in the Fourth Watch between 6:00 and 9:00 a.m. in the morning that right somebody want to know what because that's in Tucson well then that's what he said I don't know anything about it I haven't heard the tape but the prophet said it was between 6:00 and 9 that's good enough for me amen I'm not worrying about whether what time is over in Africa or what time over in Canada between 600 and 9 s it me now for I know that this that the Bible says when the seventh angel strk the Earth time as you know it shall be no longer is that right well I don't worry about the about what time is over in California and what time will it be over there for time shall be no longer time as you know it days and hours this is eternity so never try to get ahead nowhere don't try to figure it out time shall be no longer that's what the scripture says is that right amen so therefore we find then that um he had to preach it this way and he signed off and a brother Dill told me the other day that all he he was saying was the judgment is coming the fire is falling and the fire fell in Indiana and also California Fireballs fell that right signs that the Holy Ghost Fireballs are going to fall upon you soon amen exactly right see so therefore uh he preached it there and now uh brother out west say the name he happened to because go to Phoenix and there he met a brother who was at the meetings and he gave the bombs amen so this what he said he said three things to happen before the Lord appears see now go back to go back to Abraham now certain things had to happen before Isaac appeared God and human flesh that right but a power had to come and change their dead bodies back is that right okay and now let's turn to first Thessalonians 4:14 so we can see a des scripture I'm tired amen praise God the 16th verse for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Crash shall rise first now I'm going to say what brother brandom said is on the tape and this was this brother's notes and this was given to me so I'm going to give it to you and I didn't say this now brother Bram said it amen he said he said now there's three things that must happen here here it's the shout the voice of the Archangel and Trump of God he said now the shout the shout the first thing that happened is the shout now here what the shout is that's the message through Malachi 4 what are you shouting about you anything to shout about great is a Holy One of Israel in your midst is that something to shout about amen the word of God Amen is that simple amen how simple thank you Lord the he the Lord shall Sin from heaven with a shout on the earth other words there's his Prophet seal the message with his blood the message is out and Book and Tape and everything there's laying out there scoff has come he ain't no Prophet if you're a prophet raise up from the dead say Amen now be careful when you praying to ask him because to be raised up make sure it's God's will now so therefore the SC raised up from there come on now see and therefore I thought you had a message see you're dead now you see the me now then the Lord himself shall descend from heaven and make that shout that message live am how in your hearts amen it's very simple Noah built the ark and there the ark sat and they scoff at is that right am and they laugh and they laugh and they laugh but the water came amen type of the spirit that right amen amen and it lifted up that message that Ark up it wind amen all others died this message if this is the message and to me it is the message for is living in my heart and it's going to be quickened see to me now therefore all others is to me is wrong there is no other message sunship body whatever it is is to me is wrong amen this is the message and though God's prophets remains as laying down in Jeff I have the message for he spoke that to continue preaching in the eagle age then he do that but right now he told me to feed the flock am that's all I can do is a stand up here let the Holy Spirit feed the flock if I'm called in this great anointed age this age where a baded bruised seventh angel had his wings clipped going home his elbow See Me Now crushed but I'm told that every bone his body came back to place before he died that's right every bone came back to place was mended back and then he died so therefore he brought the message now you say well why say the scribes that Elias must first come well go back to when uh God hidden in Simplicity you all there he said that when the ratchet come to be so few why it won't even be missed what he said it'd be a very very few see and nobody can figure it out what's he talking about he said why the judgment will be falling and they started in Alaska see the judgments in Arizona just flooding and snowing and all across a dry desert see me Rivers Running and so forth judgments are falling all across the land and so forth the judgments would be falling Christ would be on the earth in his message word in your heart living and then certain ones would come and run and say well why sayth the scribes that Elijah must first come where's he at see me now why don't he raise up from there see me now ai already come didn't know why he was a prophet from the foundation of the world he went fourth in 1933 didn't you know it what do you think he stood up there and said stop cutting your hair for that was God speaking to you sister that that was God speaking to you through his word did you know it then you see to me now but you did unto him whatsoever you listed you see that was God being revealed in human skin there but his so simple is say that something will come among you it'll pass over you pass right on through you won't even see it that's the way God does he comes in Simplicity now I'm not telling you that Elijah has already come I'm not telling you that brother Brandon will not raise from the dead please don't go out there and say that I said to you that why I said the scribes is he already come is your heart restored back I say to you if God wants to raise him that's God's business am amen that'll be according to the will of God so when you pray you pray Lord let thy will be done make sure that you don't pray a Miss make sure that all that the bruised pattered messenger fought with a a torn up stomach for 40 years to bring you the message and here is Le and you run somewhere else the mess is supposed to be in your heart you don't have to run nowhere supposed to be in your heart if you want to go down there go down orderly go down there and see the prophet because see his remains and come on back home but you got the message he got it home to you and Rome killed him see but he got it home to you that's right so therefore if you want know what that's the message the message went forth to me see to me now people want to ask you question I don't I'm not going to answer any questions I just preach your word up here amen I'm not going to try to explain nothing you cannot explain this it must be revealed to the Eagles so brother Hunt and I the holy spirital because because you're both of us don't try to explain nothing cuz they somebody come ask you this and ask you that I don't know nothing I'm just a servant of the Lord doing what I'm supposed to do here in New York that's all I'm supposed to do here see amen now if God change it then then I'm happy it's all right with me see man now but I'm going to do what it says I'm going to preach the word you see the me now so therefore If the message has been restored and he had the message do you all say that there amen was something restored to your heart do you believe in all that the prop have said that's the message your heart was turned away from Pentecost baptism whatever it was turned to the word you want to hear the word the word the word and your heart will restored to the word and believe in all that God's Prophet has said and he looking down over the banon right now he'd be happy if he see all of us because be like be like across the country I mean exalting one another assembling ourselves together with love you know what I mean now and not with a lot of rankling and also accusations and you said this over here and what you mean over here and so forth he would be happy to know that his message got home see his message got home so you make sure today that the message of God got home to your heart for it's the word of God then if that has happened he said the next thing would happen number two the second thing amen the shout oh yes um number two the second thing is the voice of an archangel Jesus on the cross now notice this now Jesus up on the cross Jesus gave up the ghost is finished see the work is finished gave up The Ghost and cried with a loud voice and the resurrection took place and right the voice came after the son of man God Prophet died all right amen amen see talking about now the Holy Spirit see went down and preached souls in prison but a voice he cried with loud voice something that he said so brother Brown said that there was something in jesus' voice some words that he spoke now watch this now all the old Saints from Adam on down they were asleep is that right don't miss that they were sleeping see me now so in they sleeping though they were in a different place they were still sleeping they wasn't dead but he woke them up with a cry he cried out on the cross and they woke up Resurrection time and they come up and walked around there that right the Bible says that the bride is sleeping slumbering sleeping that right amen so the Lord himself must descend leave his body in the air left his bite up on the cross didn't he and the work is finished the message got home that right is it living in your heart though we're sleeping we're dead the body is dead we're sleeping but there's going to be a voice of thunder Jehovah God something he's going to say is going to wake us up but we sleeping they were sleeping a voice Cried Out wake up and said certain words and we're sleeping that right but when that happens that is the resurrection it's on the resurrection is on and only the seed can come and that's the time when you're going to see a little persecution it's coming on now see so then the Saints arose and Jesus said something and this voice again will bring forth the Rapture to to the sleeping bride with a shout a message that will live amen amen so the bride is sleeping and the Thunders must be spoken I believe the third thing is the the trumpet and this is going to call the bride to the wedding supper see that's what it's going to be now did God give brother brandom three pulls plus another pull he gave him three PS little birds great doves seven angels as sign did he give him sign as an eagle that's up to you to know see I'm not saying anything all I know is that he passed away all I know is that he said that the message got home now whether he's to come back as the eagle again I don't know see this the eagle age whether there'll be one Eagle all over again see me now whether it'll be in the resurrection Christ himself the Royal Seed of Abraham in the resurrection in that time quickly bodies to see many sons like un to himself amen whether it be the all the eagles gathered there you follow me now amen that if that is the case that's what I'm looking for amen so I pray that you understand what I said just now amen so I'm saying to you that I'm not saying brother brm is not going to rise I didn't say that I said if he rise it'll be for the glory of God it'll be God's will see mean now but I know this that there's got to be a resurrection power come among the bride I know that and if he doesn't rise up he so I heard said himself that I go away but I'll come back in a little while at the last Trump that's what he said now that was this was what was said so therefore if people are looking for him to come back I don't know maybe they're right but me I'm looking for the will of God Amen I'm looking for the Lord himself to descend from heaven with a shout and therefore I'm here by the grace of God this morning to comfort you with these words amen shall we bow our heads almighty God we thank you Father for Thy word this morning we pray Lord Jesus that amen these words have comforted the Sheep's heart that they might understand these things and Lord God we know was a long and lengthy message but father we felt led that this message had to go out father to these sheep sitting here we're not responsible anywhere else oh God but we pray Lord that the words that's been spoken here will be quickened in their hearts and may it live and father may they go out ahead with more understanding of the scriptures Lord and may you reveal it to their hearts and father we pray for brother Brandon's family for all those that are in sorrow Oh God on this day Lord many a morning and we mourn also also ourselves Lord but we know father that thou would have us to believe in your word we're here
