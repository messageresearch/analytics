[13:18] amen and so therefore I certainly want
[13:21] to thank you for that and just a little
[13:25] testimony I thought I'd take about 10
[13:27] minutes
[13:28] hey man September 20th 1974 the Holy
[13:34] Spirit the fog my father in heaven tell
[13:36] him reveal the seventh
[13:42] and
[13:44] seven thunders are the seven voices of
[13:47] the seven churches now that's the way
[13:50] it's supposed to come because in a
[13:52] seventh seal book on page 575 brother
[13:56] branham said that there will be seven
[13:58] voices of the thunders that will reveal
[14:02] the great revelation at that time so the
[14:07] voices of the thunders had to come to
[14:10] the Prophet because in Saint John 12 I
[14:14] believe it thundered nobody knew what
[14:17] was going on but Jesus knew it was his
[14:19] father speaking
[14:22] amen so the voice of Elohim came to the
[14:26] logos nail
[14:29] a man so there stood the logos to peel a
[14:34] fire veil
[14:37] see it was the voice in the clown amen
[14:41] or who is I just take a little testimony
[14:45] [Applause]
[14:47] on page five who is Melchizedek now I'm
[14:51] getting old now being the oldest
[14:53] preacher here I mean that's gonna preach
[14:55] anyway amen
[14:56] and so a man you were preached last
[15:00] night a preacher preacher preach last
[15:02] night a man and a young colored man got
[15:06] up on a horizontal rainbow
[15:08] [Applause]
[15:13] but he left room for all colored man to
[15:16] get up they all saw a man
[15:18] [Applause]
[15:21] happy - amen I don't think I have enough
[15:24] debt to say what beetle I don't know
[15:25] anything I'll find out the event
[15:27] so anyway page five a paragraph who is
[15:32] Melchizedek paragraph 422 now remember
[15:36] that light that was in that cloud that
[15:42] gave the revelation the light was in the
[15:47] cloud the cloud was representing seven
[15:51] thunders
[15:53] angels
[15:55] and church change too
[15:56] seven seals but there was somebody but
[16:00] not the Lord that was a ghoul
[16:03] of the law
[16:06] there was a pillow fire in the cloud
[16:11] Amen that was that boys there spoke to
[16:14] the Prophet and says go back in open
[16:18] mystery of marriage in divorce
[16:21] the Royce that was fooling up in the
[16:23] cloud hey man my little girl telling me
[16:27] Sara here that school there in Arizona
[16:30] was looking up there on a cloudless sky
[16:32] and seeing this cloud mysteriously and
[16:35] that mountain going up and down with an
[16:37] Amber fire burning in it
[16:39] your teachers dismissed the classes in
[16:41] the school and brought them out front
[16:43] and said did you see anything like that
[16:45] look look away now remember that's the
[16:48] same amber light that's on the rock so
[16:52] it's the same God same revelation said
[16:55] tell them to do this it's what I told
[16:58] you this morning which was marriage and
[17:00] divorce
[17:01] so it was still that word now what was
[17:05] the mystery of marriage in divorce first
[17:07] Corinthians chapter 7 verse 12 through
[17:10] 15 was the voice given to prophet the
[17:14] authority to forgive your sins in
[17:16] marriage in divorce you could get the
[17:19] cloud and angels and everything else
[17:21] bless that voice speaks it so remember
[17:29] now that light when I was in the cloud
[17:31] it spoke a matter anyway September 20
[17:36] 1974 seven thunders was revealed I
[17:39] thought it was for myself in my church
[17:41] demands I don't know anything about
[17:43] going out on the field so I just spoke
[17:46] it to my church for 71 days nobody else
[17:50] preached but myself
[17:53] and the Holy Spirit told me in August
[17:55] 1974 I was away on a vacation someone
[17:58] give you a specially designed messages
[18:03] to bring down the Holy Ghost in your
[18:06] church from September the 8th to
[18:11] November 17th from 8 to 8 amen and so
[18:16] then I appreciate some this is what the
[18:18] Holy Ghost is giving forward and
[18:19] capstone the love and all the different
[18:21] messages and I had four preparatory
[18:25] messages amen Armageddon and I believe
[18:28] consecrated temple sanctification amen
[18:32] and then Christ is in his temple
[18:36] seven Thunder baby amen
[18:39] on a Wednesday and Wednesday night
[18:41] September 18 our preach expectation
[18:45] Simeon that was September 18
[18:50] in Friday morning I was reading I knew
[18:52] something was moving just like here in
[18:55] this meeting something is moving
[18:57] [Applause]
[18:59] and then on Friday morning September
[19:01] 20th already laid out for preparatory
[19:04] messages my things and we're here buy
[19:07] things
[19:09] and then reading the statue of a perfect
[19:11] man that morning in the water in the
[19:14] bathtub a man in a then the Holy Spirit
[19:17] dropped down in there and said the seven
[19:20] thunders are the seven points and seven
[19:21] churches use a man after simian
[19:26] expectation the Holy Ghost review you're
[19:28] gonna see the price and the price is
[19:31] anointed word
[19:34] so there was a Christ seven thunders
[19:37] amen
[19:39] and then it was scriptural revealed
[19:42] Scripture because page 304 and the
[19:47] fourth seal this says wait a time
[19:50] element is involved wait I say wait on
[19:54] the Lord you shall renew your spent go
[19:58] get all excited frustrated wait
[20:01] God spoke it so shall it be
[20:06] so a man so we had waited since 6365 and
[20:12] then they
[20:13] it says on page 304 wait till the seven
[20:17] thunders auda is voices but now it just
[20:21] turned it back around and he told a
[20:24] prophet the Prophet said there'll be
[20:26] seven voices of the thunders coming to
[20:30] the profile
[20:31] then for the bribe way to the thunders
[20:34] on the tapes and books artists voices
[20:38] [Applause]
[20:40] so therefore I knew I was right with the
[20:42] splitter tapes I had to wait for the
[20:44] thunders already on the tape to audit
[20:47] the voices if I'm not a prophet I'm in
[20:53] the pride
[20:56] but there is a gift of wisdom among the
[20:59] nine gifts
[21:01] to know how to put the Word of God
[21:03] together
[21:06] well praise the Lord that's my testimony
[21:08] amen
[21:09] and then we begin to go out in 1975 from
[21:13] September 20th from my own church the
[21:16] Lord spoke to me and said go to Beaumont
[21:17] Texas and I thought Beaumont Texas and
[21:21] well amen and while the Dilek was there
[21:24] with us and other brothers and they are
[21:26] started with a little message entitled
[21:27] seven live voices amen and praise God I
[21:33] went out from there
[21:34] I wondered why Texas well the Prophet
[21:38] died in Texas and the word went in the
[21:42] ground in Texas
[21:44] [Applause]
[21:48] so from the West they'll come for fall a
[21:51] horse rider
[21:51] [Applause]
[21:56] a man but now remember the white horse
[21:59] rider comes locals and Elihu
[22:04] so the logos come right out as the
[22:07] thunders with a promise to wait for the
[22:10] dynamics
[22:13] here we are heaven so there's been six
[22:17] years of sewing from 1974 September 20th
[22:23] to 1980 September was six years of
[22:28] sewing and the Holy Spirit had given me
[22:30] Leviticus 25 verse 1 through 6 way back
[22:34] in 1968 and told me I was sold and then
[22:39] explained a little few things to me man
[22:42] but I had no idea that I had to do that
[22:45] on the field just for my own church well
[22:49] anyway I don't have time to read the
[22:50] book verse 1 through 6 is what he give
[22:52] me that you are mean so I'll pick up one
[22:55] verse in here third verse six years
[22:58] thou shalt soul I feel in six years
[23:04] thou shalt plane dive in you can gather
[23:06] in the fruit there road but in the
[23:09] seventh year shall be a Sabbath
[23:11] now watch or Sabbath of rest on to the
[23:15] land
[23:17] it's not a Saturday Sabbath it's a
[23:20] Seventh Seal Holy Spirit land rest
[23:25] [Applause]
[23:28] did you get it
[23:30] six years saw them seven thunders sees
[23:36] then beginning in 1980 about September
[23:40] begins the seventh year
[23:43] so God called for a rest he said turn
[23:49] the clown
[23:50] [Applause]
[23:56] so I rested I just turned the crown the
[24:00] Holy Spirit pours out
[24:02] [Applause]
[24:06] so I'm resting but some happen arrested
[24:10] with the Holy Spirit amen in New York
[24:13] City and coronation bill what happened
[24:16] in melt coronation bill
[24:21] crowd was turned
[24:24] then I believe you had a Issa convention
[24:26] and Kimberly then the Holy Spirit had
[24:30] our brother Roscoe from Johannesburg
[24:32] took him way back before the beginning
[24:39] the crowd was turned which is L ahem
[24:43] now somebody got a speakit

[24:54] yellow him as a seven spirits around
[24:59] about April that time come charity never
[25:01] faileth
[25:02] [Music]
[25:04] and then old dead seeds that was sitting

[25:36] with the glory of the Lord and the 16
[25:41] pictures was represented 60 years
[25:45] [Music]
[25:46] [Applause]
[25:49] because the Prophet said the mechanics
[25:52] and the dynamics is here now
[25:54] [Applause]
[25:57] but if you can just get started with the
[26:01] right attitude
[26:03] and the right attitude as a beer dog if
[26:07] you call a dog a man even a dogs eat the
[26:10] crumbs
[26:12] [Applause]
[26:13] and the right attitude is to come like

[26:20] if you would have been here
[26:23] but he was all
[26:24] already there
[26:26] [Applause]

[26:35] Elohim was just holding over you
[26:39] this wait before you to sanctify
[26:41] yourselves amen to get right with God
[26:44] and then amen so we have the 16 pictures

[27:47] universe
[27:49] we got the devil under our feet
[27:52] [Applause]
[27:56] [Music]
[27:58] that's what Joshua told him to get those
[28:01] Kings and put your foot on their necks
[28:05] [Music]
[28:11] and we got them down in the ground
[28:14] now don't you get weep now and let them

[28:28] fenders don't you believe that
[28:32] [Applause]

[28:44] New York and then turned it in Maryland
[28:47] and come over to Johannesburg and the
[28:50] coronation field and turn at the third
[28:53] third time why three times he said third
[28:57] phase brotherly love 1974 some have
[29:03] compassion identify the seven churches a

[29:19] quotes Amen from the backside of the
[29:22] Bible reveals

[30:16] third phase and pin Harris identified
[30:19] sin for brother into rascal brother
[30:21] George Martin brought I was wondering
[30:23] about my meeting I knew it was charity
[30:24] and I couldn't preach it myself and I
[30:27] had to have somebody with a revelation
[30:29] of priests charities
[30:31] brother George Martin came over in June
[30:32] and brought me a tape and the elders I
[30:35] believe told by the etiquette to send
[30:37] the tape a brother Coleman he have said
[30:39] it himself but he was asked to send it
[30:41] that's inspiration I was needing that
[30:45] is not me or brother Edgar or Martin or
[30:49] this one or that one or twine them it's
[30:51] the Holy Spirit
[30:55] we are the same body Romans 12 everyman
[31:00] menaces according to his measure
[31:03] so I'm only mincing according to my
[31:05] measure
[31:07] and you Minister core New York measure I
[31:10] thank God for brother Tommy Dillon a man
[31:13] old soldier over here
[31:15] he stood faithfully a man and he had to
[31:20] take the rebuke the revile ins the
[31:24] curses for heaven he being Wayne having
[31:28] a colored man come to the meetings and
[31:31] preach five times with everybody in the
[31:34] message sitting there in 1975 you can
[31:37] imagine what they call him and then also
[31:42] the added rebuke of New York City the
[31:45] Prophet says something about New York
[31:47] City and one brother said yeah watch New

[32:09] three of us and they'd come to the
[32:11] meetings and they won't do the preaching
[32:13] here and all is always New York this and

[32:30] you got to put up with the spirit of man
[32:32] you mean because it's just about over
[32:34] this year hope is over in these meetings
[32:39] amen
[32:42] so I don't care who it is or where I
[32:44] come from as long as it's there
[32:48] but now when you get out of the spirit
[32:50] of man from Laodicea and get over to the
[32:52] book of Acts in Jerusalem they had
[32:55] eleven apostles I personally would have
[32:57] liked to have all eleven right here
[33:01] how about you I'd like to have those
[33:05] prophets and teachers from Antioch
[33:08] it doesn't matter long as the Spirit of
[33:10] God that the Prophet speak one by one
[33:14] amen well praise God we certainly
[33:17] appreciate these things
[33:19] so now just we have we are in nineteen
[33:22] that we into eighth year and he says in
[33:26] Leviticus 25 verse 20 through 22 in the
[33:29] eighth year soldier seed but this time
[33:34] with mechanics and dynamics together
[33:39] so I feel trees caught by the
[33:42] inspiration God is fixing to give this
[33:46] ministry power and authority to clean up
[33:50] the churches of the unclean spirits
[33:53] and Paul the virtues into the bride
[33:57] to the perfection of the coming of the
[33:59] Son of God
[34:01] we're here we have arrived a man soul
[34:05] praise God we in the eighth year you
[34:08] believe that a man so anyway that's some
[34:15] remarks here somewhere
[34:16] wait I have it here now 19 September 12
[34:20] 1981 I had 3 thoughts in the beginning
[34:24] was the word the Lord to give me this
[34:26] year but from the beginning there wasn't
[34:28] a soul number 3 to know him from the
[34:31] beginning
[34:32] so I'm speaking to a brother Roscoe he
[34:34] told me the whole is very deal to know
[34:36] him from to get into him so well that's
[34:38] on both sides at the ocean they love him
[34:40] so praise God is wonderful to know the
[34:43] inspiration so I feel like this is a la
[34:46] m7 rainfall convention in 1982 Dell ahem
[34:52] and logos a man the dynamics and the
[34:56] mechanics is ready to mold you in 1982
[35:03] into the word image in the eight-year
[35:07] and wait till the ninth year are to her
[35:10] fruits come in
[35:13] so here we are marriage in divorce
[35:17] page 14 brother Brown speaking here
[35:22] usually a revival lasts only about three
[35:24] years but this has been going on for
[35:27] over 15 years and not one denomination
[35:29] has sprung up from it and they tried
[35:31] seven thunders a nomination there is
[35:33] none pimping and for this is the seed
[35:36] time there's no more shot
[35:39] after the shucks gone is see God is
[35:43] ready
[35:44] amen if he isn't doing it now he's going
[35:47] to call a church to perfection by his
[35:50] word Jesus Christ
[35:52] so I'm looking for God to call a church
[35:54] to perfection this year you believe that
[35:58] now our brother Edgar stepped out by
[36:01] faith and I know what that is seven
[36:04] funders give faith a man and on page 25
[36:09] in marriage in divorce just let you know
[36:10] that God said that before the beginning
[36:14] in the beginning in front of beginning
[36:16] before the beginning was Ella him and
[36:18] Helen was the seven spirits that's what
[36:20] our brothers said and page 25 he said
[36:24] what is God God is a great eternal at
[36:28] the beginning way back before there was
[36:32] a beginning
[36:34] way back before they even was a
[36:37] beginning and that's what brother Roscoe
[36:40] preached way back before the beginning
[36:43] before there was a beginning
[36:44] [Applause]
[36:46] amen he wasn't even gone did you know
[36:50] that God's the object of worship and
[36:52] there was nothing to worship Him he
[36:54] lived alone and in him was attributes
[36:56] and what does an attribute of thought
[36:59] now you get something that will board on
[37:01] the lesson for tonight
[37:03] he was his attributes that was in him he
[37:07] was his attributes
[37:10] [Music]
[37:13] amen praise God he was his own
[37:16] attributes now it was in him to be
[37:19] father in him to be God and him to be
[37:21] son and him him to be Savior it was in
[37:24] him to be healer and all these things
[37:26] here are just displaying his attributes
[37:30] and you are the physical manifestation
[37:34] [Applause]
[37:36] of the display of elohim's attributes
[37:41] so please go so anyway we are I'm kind
[37:49] of got my thoughts over here
[37:51] a man so anyway my inspiration for these
[37:56] meetings it comes from so on September
[37:59] 20th but telling me in the beginning was
[38:02] the word and but from they get it was
[38:04] not soul and to know him from the
[38:07] beginning to know him his eternal life
[38:09] September 20th seven years to the day
[38:13] September 20th this year 1981 from
[38:17] September 20th 1974 was seven years in
[38:22] that morning he giving us a message in
[38:24] the beginning was the word that's what I
[38:27] want to preach what am I trying to
[38:29] understand
[38:30] and he spoke to me the message this
[38:33] morning the message to nail the book of
[38:35] life so on September 20 in seven years
[38:39] after the thunders the Holy Spirit gave
[38:41] me the inspiration for these messages
[38:44] which is the Lamb's Book of Life so I
[38:48] thought it fitting to go along with LEM
[38:53] amen so that's my inspiration
[38:57] now catch this now I think assist asked
[39:00] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[39:03] you're sure going to get it whoever you
[39:05] are
[39:05] [Applause]
[39:09] because here's your quote sister whoever
[39:12] you are three kind of believers amen
[39:16] three kind of believers now we have I
[39:21] got it at a man Paradis that's the
[39:23] reason page 15
[39:25] that I do believe that when that bride
[39:28] is called out she's called out for 16
[39:32] years
[39:33] and seven thunders gathers the brown
[39:37] calls around this call-out and elected
[39:44] election predestination and set in the
[39:48] book of life
[39:53] are you reading
[39:55] [Applause]
[39:57] we gotta be set in
[40:00] when that happens when that time comes
[40:04] God's got to come where they're gonna be
[40:06] sent in the book of life
[40:09] they'll come a sound from heaven that'll
[40:12] take such a baptism the Holy Ghost into
[40:14] that bride
[40:18] that'll take her from the earth in a
[40:20] Rapson grace
[40:22] cut promise it is I don't care how
[40:25] old-fashioned it sees for God's hips
[40:28] hold
[40:32] so there we are now so my inspiration
[40:36] September 28 1981 is a preach on the
[40:39] book of life
[40:41] then he promised it here you do it
[40:44] somebody do it him and then they'll come
[40:46] a sound from heaven
[40:51] so we're waiting for sounds from heaven
[40:53] sound from heaven is life coming from
[40:57] heaven amen now the seven thunders gives
[41:01] faith to set their pride in the book of
[41:03] life
[41:04] now we've been setting the book the
[41:06] bride in the book of life all these
[41:08] years
[41:09] but then it's got to come a time when
[41:11] God makes it real
[41:13] and gives you a part of hims name which
[41:18] is Ella hems life
[41:20] then what happens to realize when the
[41:23] bride begins to realize like in these
[41:25] meetings here mm so so if we want to
[41:28] take our time this morning to make sure
[41:31] Cape Town gets it Kimberly gets it East
[41:35] London
[41:36] appacha strong and
[41:38] however you say it in all the rest of
[41:41] the believers

[42:23] different ministers here and brother

[42:54] amen and we do want to hear so amen
[42:58] praise God what they're clapping in the
[43:02] banging down on the platform is what
[43:03] when the people came here and we are

[43:23] before we stand the spoken word means
[43:25] flesh is light amen it is the light that
[43:28] be walking in we've been walking in the
[43:30] light of Malachi 4 for 16 years it was
[43:34] the light to ripen now the seven
[43:36] thunders is that right it's the same
[43:40] light of Paul arrhenius and Martin and
[43:43] Columba and Luther West America for the
[43:46] seven thunders is the light
[43:50] and it flashed on the Seas for sixteen
[43:53] years and it ripen you were towards you
[43:57] and then are you ready for the
[43:59] seventeenth year was in the 17th year
[44:02] Genesis 37 Joseph put on his coat

[44:12] now I think I put on my coat and I go on
[44:19] and I'll have some fellowship with the
[44:21] Brethren
[44:22] now I'm not Joseph I'm Joseph Coleman
[44:27] I gotta cover myself all the time he
[44:31] said he was Joseph he reduce a man
[44:34] where's the law I Revan see and then yes
[44:38] sir
[44:38] well praise God so a prophet said or
[44:42] what's attraction on a mountain in the
[44:44] last things he said that are and he said
[44:46] that the lemons and grapefruits would be
[44:50] hooked into that tree
[44:53] amen a citrus life and he called the
[44:56] lemons and the grapefruits denominations
[45:00] but he said in the top of the tree where
[45:04] the fruit comes there would be something
[45:06] hiding up there it would be a tangelo
[45:10] they'd be half orange and half amen
[45:16] lemon and the tangent law is a
[45:18] perversion it's not a lemon which is a
[45:22] denomination not a grapefruit sour
[45:26] cranky
[45:29] former fanatics hey man
[45:35] well it's a tangelo sweetie sweet
[45:39] creeping around silly women's houses in
[45:44] the last days and the tangelo is a
[45:47] perversion of the last 16 years of shot
[45:51] and a tangelo in the top of the tree
[45:54] with the orange we're almost deceive the
[45:58] very elect if possible so there we are
[46:02] but when that orange branch moves out
[46:07] test the lemons and grapefruits it'll be
[46:11] right in the top with the tangelo
[46:14] and here we are right in the top
[46:18] oh praise God better get to my message
[46:20] amen but something I do want to say over
[46:22] here a baby brother Roskill mentioned
[46:25] that genesis of the ESET aliens it turns
[46:30] a men an eight-time let us make man and
[46:34] ellingham said to logos let us make man
[46:36] in our image a man
[46:38] and so that's wonderful amen that's what
[46:41] God's been been doing here with you amen
[46:43] he's been doing the same thing to see
[46:45] the sea is already planted in the earth
[46:47] and the water is on top of the air but
[46:51] God put disease in there first
[46:53] so all those denominational waters from
[46:56] revelation 17 doesn't matter the big
[46:59] sitting on the waters where God
[47:03] put the seeds under the
[47:06] hey man
[47:08] so God knows all he need is light
[47:12] to dry deland part the waters a man in
[47:16] giant earth your earth up let it dry out
[47:19] for 16 years
[47:22] amen so therefore deceits already
[47:26] planning the earth the Spirit of God
[47:28] move once again upon the face of the
[47:30] waters
[47:31] and separate the waters from the waters
[47:35] then he began to speak the word let
[47:38] there be let it be let there be
[47:40] did you get it now no more this he's
[47:43] already planning number two the Spirit
[47:45] of God moves number three will then see
[47:49] have no fear speaking let there be
[47:54] amen and God saw the light and a fundus
[47:58] was good and he named a light he tall it
[48:02] damn
[48:04] and loofah named the light he called it
[48:06] justification
[48:08] and Wesley named the lights
[48:10] and the Pentecostals name the life and
[48:13] we name the light the seven continents
[48:18] that's why we may that's why we keep
[48:21] saying seven thunders we're naming the
[48:26] [Applause]
[48:28] and we said let there be a firmament
[48:30] between the waters on the top and the
[48:33] waters on the bottom and you are the
[48:35] waters on the top
[48:40] heavenly places is in between here now
[48:45] in heavenly places and the church was
[48:49] separated from the bride the water the
[48:51] bride waters from the church waters now

[1:26:38] that's why and all now listen your body
[1:26:42] is not a plane your body sixteen
[1:26:48] elements is not a tussle your body is
[1:26:51] not a shot your body is the grain itself
[1:26:55] [Applause]
[1:26:58] this body has matured into the green of

[1:28:03] they sturdy amen Pei sturdy now they
[1:28:10] were up in the upper room you notice now
[1:28:12] they were cowards they had the mechanics
[1:28:15] and we got two mechanics and they were
[1:28:17] all standing back at his saying oh I'm
[1:28:19] afraid of them I'm afraid now I become
[1:28:21] afraid to go out there make a claim for
[1:28:22] seven thunders all them great bishops
[1:28:25] amen and things out to end the message
[1:28:27] I'm afraid then priests and things I'm
[1:28:29] afraid to make that claim

[1:28:56] and they were then they were fresh out
[1:28:58] believed on him I just can't do that but

[1:29:03] and what did it do it not only fill this
[1:29:05] theory inside that only fill their soul
[1:29:09] with the baptism of the holy ghost or
[1:29:11] breath but it also quicken their
[1:29:13] dynamics I mean their mechanics their
[1:29:16] bodies were quicken they're 16
[1:29:23] so your body your 16 elements is not the
[1:29:27] shop
[1:29:29] if the mechanics
[1:29:33] he is the dynamics and ill hem is ready
[1:29:36] to take it then the term inside will be
[1:29:40] busted

[1:30:40] the Holy Ghost amen
[1:30:41] wasn't only in his soul but it was all
[1:30:44] over them not only the die names come in
[1:30:47] to quicken but a quickening mechanics
[1:30:51] in 1906 when they come into quicken his
[1:30:54] soul quicken shut and shuts promises was
[1:30:59] a gift
[1:31:02] so he not only quick in the soul and

[2:22:47] mind we were and he spoke it in it
[2:22:51] materialized
[2:22:56] the Bible teaches that Jesus Christ was
[2:22:58] the lamb slain before the foundation of

[2:47:15] know who you are you don't want you to
[2:47:17] speak the word for your own healing in
[2:47:20] but we want to do it amen so therefore
[2:47:23] friends the gospel this morning is the
[2:47:26] good news that God puts your name on the
[2:47:28] Lamb's Book of Life and Christ died and
[2:47:31] said the Holy goes here to call you to
[2:47:33] eternal life and all the Devils in Hell
[2:47:35] cannot stop you North erase your name
[2:47:40] eternal section
[2:47:44] we were right there with him in the mind
[2:47:46] and force of God and each thought is
[2:47:49] expressed is in a season and time when
[2:47:52] each member came forth a man
[2:47:55] it became expressed and took its place
[2:47:58] in the body of Christ
[2:47:59] thus the bride is the literal spoken
[2:48:03] word see bride in turn they become the
[2:48:08] many members spoken word see bride
[2:48:10] manifests in the flame and in this light
[2:48:14] we did not become seed by the rebirth we
[2:48:18] were seed and we can
[2:48:21] [Music]
[2:48:24] because all the lik only the elect can
[2:48:26] be reborn or born again because you are
[2:48:29] the seed sons of God and God only and
[2:48:33] God can send forth the baptism the Holy
[2:48:34] Ghost and fire into your hearts and then
[2:48:37] you're born again you have the new birth
[2:48:39] and birth means creation a continuation
[2:48:43] of the creation and therefore before you
[2:48:46] receive the Holy Ghost you are believing
[2:48:48] unto eternal life but you do not have
[2:48:51] eternal life until you receive the Holy
[2:48:53] Ghost because it is eternal life the
[2:48:55] Holy Ghost is God's life in you then you
[2:48:57] got eternal life
[2:48:59] but the all words cease here that's
[2:49:01] looking for the baptism of the Holy
[2:49:03] Ghost and because you are a word seed
[2:49:06] from his thinking therefore you can
[2:49:10] receive the baptism when the sound from
[2:49:12] heaven comes and it's here so before the
[2:49:16] Holy Spirit could pour out the dynamics
[2:49:18] here to go all these 16 years amen and
[2:49:21] bring all these truths out and call some
[2:49:24] sons of God out and train some call man
[2:49:27] to pack this revival and now these men
[2:49:31] have have come out on the great
[2:49:32] persecutions many trials and temptations
[2:49:35] and everything lost if friends and
[2:49:37] everything else to take a stand for the
[2:49:39] gospel
