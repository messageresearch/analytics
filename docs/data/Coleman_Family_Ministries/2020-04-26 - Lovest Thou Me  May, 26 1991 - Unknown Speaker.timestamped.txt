[15:03] the people understand what I'm talking
[15:05] about must understand my lingo a man
[15:07] praise God now let's remember that great
[15:10] message from last week and build your
[15:12] faith on the word amen and today as you
[15:16] approach the prayer line and just recap
[15:20] in st. John 20 and 21 as a god up in 221
[15:23] there was three appearances about Jesus
[15:26] to his disciples to teach them a man and
[15:30] he had two appearances the first Sunday
[15:33] 2nd Sunday and then he appeared in st.
[15:35] John 21 to his disciple
[15:38] and they have gone on fishing I preached
[15:41] this in 1974 as the thunders and faith
[15:43] virtue and knowledge and now we know by
[15:48] knowledge when our nipa that speaks the
[15:50] miraculous does take place regards what
[15:53] anybody says amen
[15:56] I mean God can live with your fool away
[16:00] your foolish man God does not like I
[16:04] don't care if it takes a thousand years
[16:07] praise God it'll happen because God said
[16:11] soul may take 120 years maybe seventy
[16:17] years down at Babylon may take seven
[16:20] days in the upper room or ten days you
[16:23] may be seated but it's going to happen
[16:24] because God said so so that was the end
[16:31] of the first climax faith virgin now is
[16:34] in the second one come in and in st.
[16:35] John 21 now is this third appearance and
[16:38] that's where we are right now on
[16:39] temperance May 12th and today is the 26
[16:42] patients for is God so now I'm nipa
[16:46] tense is speaking in your lives doing
[16:49] these meetings messages it's very simple
[16:53] it's this word speaking like it did in
[16:55] 1974 1984 you come back around again to
[16:58] third time speaking again and some going
[17:01] fishing again amen they don't know well
[17:05] see John said it is the law John
[17:10] recognizes it and John recognized it's
[17:13] not the whole church let them do what
[17:15] they want to do but John himself is
[17:17] haven't remindful individual revival
[17:21] some may want to go here and there if
[17:23] you look the eyes and look at the church
[17:25] well then well yeah I don't see
[17:27] everybody doing everything well if
[17:29] they're not going to everything because
[17:31] the individual is individual it is the
[17:34] Lord from John oh yes that's right I'll
[17:39] sit the shaking her head she's saying my
[17:41] god that's right sister
[17:44] the shaking isn't it a man see and so
[17:49] I'm nipa to speaking in your Lara's
[17:52] omnipotence is this word that I'm
[17:54] speaking and from the Prophet tying it
[17:56] in together amen
[17:58] temperance and for Christ directed
[18:00] service but temperance and patience and
[18:03] God isn't probably carrying this and
[18:05] then the token is displayed through
[18:07] brother kindness the dog lead a needle

[18:14] these questions about this man seems so

[18:30] that ties directly into self-control on
[18:35] that button that little black button as
[18:38] you gotta turn Oh hallelujah
[18:42] breathe that's why I was stuck right on
[18:45] there omnipotence put it right there to
[18:48] teach some temperance saint man so we
[18:52] got into and on May 12th there and read
[18:55] directly from Malachi 4 his message to

[26:21] dream was had a few years ago when the
[26:23] voice said my yes sir
[26:26] but while preaching temperance sees
[26:28] person makes their own decision
[26:30] amen how can you have strength I don't
[26:33] know amen it's messed up on the word and
[26:36] the message amen
[26:37] but while preaching temperance the Holy
[26:39] Spirit gave the answer from the message
[26:42] to Tolkien now the real issue is
[26:44] television itself not the sports and all
[26:47] the rest of the things and all the good
[26:49] things that maybe you could put on there
[26:51] and the museum's and things like that
[26:52] you know that's okay in itself but
[26:55] that's not what the prophets talking
[26:56] about the Prophet was talking about the
[26:59] TV nothing to do with sports don't do
[27:02] anything and you talked about getting
[27:03] rid of the TV
[27:04] here's a get rid of sports or get rid of
[27:06] good things or nothing
[27:07] set the television now you take it up
[27:10] with God if you want to put on the news
[27:12] or whatever it is I don't know I'm gonna
[27:14] do with that
[27:14] amen praise God and they do have
[27:17] monitors they'll cost a bit more of
[27:19] course amen now the real issue is that's
[27:21] what it is and Malachi enforce it to get
[27:23] rid of it why for we in the 3rd Exodus
[27:26] we're going to heaven that's what do you
[27:30] understand now I'm not preaching against
[27:32] your television I'm preaching to those
[27:33] who want to get free to go to heaven I
[27:38] mean how long do you think we won't be
[27:40] here another 75 years or one huh you
[27:46] won't find me here praise God
[27:49] so on and my bones won't be bleached
[27:52] either God I'll tell you that the last
[27:55] time out now
[27:56] brother Cornell with us now I'm liked a
[27:58] little testimony I don't know whether
[28:00] sister Lawrence was there not in 1976
[28:03] and mount Royale I don't know whether
[28:06] she was there in 1976 with brother Tommy
[28:09] Dillard we're down to brother Jeff songs
[28:12] and Freddie a pair of shoe and his
[28:16] little place there and would have a move
[28:18] revival 1976 little testimony relax a
[28:23] man TVs all praise God a mess you
[28:28] nervous time my god hey man so a little
[28:32] testimony and five groups from I think
[28:37] annecy of some way up there and the part
[28:40] of France near of Switzerland and they
[28:42] all come down I think we started on
[28:45] Thursday and Friday and we struck a
[28:47] little revival and then they called back
[28:49] up to the other churches they all come
[28:51] down then the bishop man named says can
[28:55] you get brother Coleman to come up here
[28:57] and like that said no I'm preaching down
[28:59] here so they had to come down there hey
[29:02] man I'll never leave where he sends me
[29:05] so they come down Thursday Friday and
[29:09] mind you the lot of the sisters had on
[29:11] pants and and the brothers you know
[29:14] beards and things and look like John the
[29:17] Baptist amen
[29:18] maybe I come out of woods amen so praise
[29:20] God but they but they love Christ and
[29:23] they love the Lord so all we had a
[29:26] wonderful time Thursday and two times
[29:28] Friday and Saturday morning the Holy
[29:30] Spirit pouring out it was my turn to
[29:32] preach 39 just like here you know I'll
[29:36] be going on fine when revelation all
[29:38] sudden always first it now narrow he
[29:40] said they can't go no further you have
[29:43] to get them sanctifying they cannot go
[29:46] from those pants and show it dresses and
[29:49] stuff over into the Holy Ghost you say
[29:52] and you know that so it lays your life
[29:56] to preach Saturday night to these lovely
[29:58] people thought we was angels preaching
[30:01] all these wonderful things about brother
[30:02] Branham
[30:03] and now I gotta walk out with that sword
[30:05] like I do here all the time then I mean
[30:08] then see you think I'm talking about
[30:10] them see I have to me all the time man
[30:13] I said Lord do I have to do that and he
[30:16] told me it's a Saturday night you have
[30:18] to bring them to the word for
[30:19] sanctification because I want to pour
[30:22] out the third work of grapes holy goes
[30:25] you say you can't bypass sanctification
[30:28] see now talking in France now I'm not
[30:31] talking anybody here I mean it might
[30:34] help somebody here and so there he says
[30:38] take the token and read how to apply the
[30:42] blood to the house so I had to take the
[30:47] very same quotes in order to have the
[30:52] Holy Spirit pour out and I haven't done
[30:56] anything different than what I did on
[30:58] temperance God be my witness so if you
[31:06] want what they had there
[31:08] well then hear what I had to say that
[31:09] time same God Amen ain't changed same
[31:13] message so I I saw okay yeah when I
[31:18] spoke to them and if I was a clap like
[31:20] this you know and then and I hit those
[31:23] quotes and they said it was praising God
[31:26] they were wanting to know what to do say
[31:30] and I was flabbergasted I hit brother
[31:33] Courtney that I had some people that
[31:35] really want me to tell them what to do
[31:38] how to get rid of their self
[31:40] I mean how to help them without arguing
[31:43] back at me and say I'm doing something
[31:45] them oh I tell I could have stayed there
[31:49] in France at the lorentz I could have
[31:51] stayed right there

[32:11] and I'm standing watching I've seen the
[32:14] Holy Spirit hovering over the people

[32:19] the brother what to do paint man but I
[32:22] couldn't go and tell brother tell me I

[36:08] you will be upset by what someone else
[36:12] may be doing to you see so many cannot

[36:38] you got temperance you do something that
[36:41] will hurt somebody else and that's those

[36:51] right there those two tempers and
[36:52] patience tempers and patience you hurt

[38:06] upset by what someone else may be doing
[38:08] to you I don't want be too long with
[38:10] this now like God not giving you a
[38:13] healing when I give you a job or
[38:16] something the apartment or the bettors
[38:18] of the Holy Ghost when you think you
[38:20] should receive it you know some people
[38:23] get mad at God you know yes sir
[38:27] but you know when they get mad at God I
[38:28] don't know why because if you read your
[38:30] Bible see you meet the mind of God it
[38:33] tell you in James 1 3 knowing this
[38:35] that's a trying of your faith worketh
[38:37] patience so what would you get mad at
[38:40] God for he's only trying your faith to
[38:42] work patience out of you amen see it
[38:49] declares Oh is it kind of joy when you
[38:53] fall into divers temptations count it
[38:57] joy
[38:59] give me a Bible preacher Paul and Silas
[39:02] fell into temptation in jail and they
[39:06] sang praise God and God was so pleased
[39:11] it caused an earthquake and it shook the
[39:15] walls and everything else praise God
[39:17] that's what I'm talking about Bible back
[39:21] to the Bible see puts he got these
[39:26] little babies around him you can't get
[39:27] nowhere maybe seen it declares there is
[39:31] a work of patience and God ain't gonna
[39:33] move you off that ash heap until you can
[39:36] get some patients out of you cry all you
[39:41] want to but God ain't moving you praise
[39:44] God hallelujah praise God till you stop
[39:49] getting mad at somebody for saying
[39:50] something about you because if you
[39:56] accost child he's going to work or work
[39:59] our patients through you whether your
[40:01] flesh likes it or not cuz he ain't
[40:06] worried about your flesh he's trying to
[40:08] get to that see Amen yes you may be
[40:17] seated
[40:18] so James declared there's a work of
[40:20] patience knowing this that the trying of
[40:23] your faith worketh patience be assured
[40:27] understand at the trial and the proving
[40:30] of your seventh under faith brings out
[40:33] patience and endurance and he didn't do
[40:36] it to the end
[40:38] back to the pieman I mean 25 years on
[40:43] waiting he didn't do it to the end
[40:46] and now what what's all these trials for
[40:49] the trials test your seventh under faith
[40:52] you said you believed seven thunders
[40:54] well you send you Charles to test it and
[40:58] the man who stands true in them proves
[41:02] his seventh on the faith to be sound in
[41:05] genuine yes sorry
[41:09] so the test works patience and patience
[41:13] works perfection that correct
[41:16] a man we're just talking to you by the
[41:20] wayside praise the Lord I think Emile
[41:24] won't appreciate just kind of talk to
[41:25] you just talk about Jesus amen alright

[42:10] it says here Amen not only saw the weak
[42:12] glory in tribulations also knowing that
[42:15] tribulation worketh patience I'm getting
[42:22] them today huh
[42:23] getting everybody see guys doing
[42:25] something through here and somebody want
[42:28] to go free and the Jubilee

[42:49] so tests works patience and patience
[42:52] works a perfection and amen and it says
[42:56] here in the fourth verse and patience
[43:00] experience and experience hope and hope
[43:04] maketh not ashamed because the love of
[43:07] God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
[43:09] Holy Ghost which is given unto us we are
[43:12] not ashamed of the gospel is the power
[43:14] of God and the salvation amen we glory

[55:24] through the bride for all these years
[55:27] yeah that's the virtue of the third pole
[55:31] patient like the Prophet had like Noah
[55:34] had like Moses had Daniel the Lions Den
[55:41] had like all the Hebrews of fate had
[55:45] patients because they had the mind of
[55:48] God they knew how to meet the mind of
[55:51] God without a Bible without a video
[55:55] without a cassette without the written
[56:00] scriptures hmm what kind of little

[56:30] thorough work so that you may be
[56:33] believers and fully develop with no
[56:37] defects and lacking in nothing praise
[56:46] God
[56:47] notice the Christian is to be joyful and
[56:50] trial in trial not because of trial
[57:02] until you do that sound like an idiot
[57:06] laughing because it's another trial but
[57:09] when the trial comes a needs becomes be
[57:12] patient joyful knowing that your child
[57:15] but then knowing that only God could
[57:18] send his trial cousin of the church name
[57:23] I wouldn't be having no trials I'll be
[57:25] out in the world having a good time but
[57:27] because I am a Christian I will have
[57:31] trials then I'll count of joy I'll be
[57:37] joyful in my trial
[57:39] not because of trial nobody wants child
[57:42] I don't want none either
[57:43] I'm just like you for is God may be
[57:46] seated
[57:47] but when they come a man I'll have to
[57:49] receive him because I have to look at
[57:51] the one who went before me Jesus Christ
[57:55] father remove this cup and his speche
[57:59] you wanted either but the will of God
[58:03] praise God
[58:05] father let thy will be done in my life
[58:08] and my family let it be done Lord the
[58:15] fruit of the trial is patience or
[58:17] endurance the stain panel of life this
[58:22] endurance or patience must be allowed to
[58:25] have his perfect worry don't get all
[58:27] upset the first day and we're on up
[58:30] because here you get the Holy Ghost well
[58:31] you get he'll May 12 patients be like
[58:37] John Ryan
[58:42] it is a process that goes on in the life
[58:46] of a Christian its goal is perfection or
[58:50] maturity that's the goal got one quote
[58:56] to read to you that you have a perfect
[58:58] man just pick up what he said there on
[59:00] patience amen
[59:02] then after that fourthly the Prophet
[59:05] picking it up set your perfect man
[59:06] you'll want to add patience to your
[59:08] faith if you got faith it worketh
[59:10] patience the Bible said so that this is
[59:13] patience now that's the next thing
[59:14] that's going to build this statue see
[59:17] what we're doing through here now we
[59:19] build that statue again amen that's the
[59:22] next thing we won't build a statue you
[59:24] know God's got real material in his
[59:26] building see how short we are brethren
[59:29] see where we add see we have glory
[59:32] we have shouts and things because we
[59:35] have faith but when we come down to
[59:38] these things here God can't build us
[59:41] into that statue he can't make us up to
[59:45] that kind of a place not all these other
[59:48] things we fall and slide off with it he
[59:51] can't build his church business say
[59:56] after all the prop has been ain't gone
[59:59] you still can't build a church ministers
[1:00:01] fighting the virtues and fighting
[1:00:03] thunders and how can you build a church
[1:00:05] amen
[1:00:08] patience with one what kind of patience
[1:00:10] first thing is half patient with God
[1:00:14] that's the first thing if you got a real
[1:00:18] genuine one on faith you have real
[1:00:19] genuine patience because faith worketh
[1:00:21] patience when God says anything you
[1:00:24] believe it
[1:00:26] Amen that's all you got patience then
[1:00:29] well I asked him last night to heal me
[1:00:31] or will say may 12 and I'm just as sick
[1:00:35] this morning or today oh my what
[1:00:38] patients God tool Abraham and 25 years
[1:00:41] later there wasn't even one sign and he
[1:00:44] still believed it he was patient with
[1:00:47] God
[1:00:50] Amen church put them always before you
[1:00:54] let him be the next crossing thing you
[1:00:56] can't cross him so just keep him before
[1:00:59] you he said now is going to happen
[1:01:01] keep him before you that's right Oh
[1:01:05] hallelujah God gives patience
[1:01:09] amen then God tries your patience find
[1:01:11] your faith in his word he tries you and
[1:01:15] patience will keep you from being uh
[1:01:17] from being upset by anything that
[1:01:19] someone someone else may do that's
[1:01:21] likely to wound you then I mean that
[1:01:23] patience is passive patient just lays

[1:05:58] greater love than the rest yet no one
[1:06:01] treated him more basely than Peter did
[1:06:03] and Peter replies now repeat his words
[1:06:05] come back and fill your love because he

[1:06:51] beat up he said feed my lambs my in the
[1:06:56] second time love is on me he's picking
[1:06:58] the gospel love again though and Peter
[1:07:00] answered the second time he's a plan
[1:07:03] replying back in filial love love us on
[1:07:06] me more important than love for men is
[1:07:10] love for Christ more than these and the
[1:07:14] only acceptable motive is love and
[1:07:16] service and the motive his love and the
[1:07:18] object is Christ anything else you've
[1:07:22] missed the mark
[1:07:24] Jesus was broken he just loved in the
[1:07:27] presence of his brethren he does not
[1:07:30] want to entrust his lambs to one who
[1:07:34] does not love him
[1:07:39] so you find out in the message how many
[1:07:42] love God you see how many ministers you
[1:07:45] got yes siree
[1:07:48] I'm gonna put his lambs in their hands
[1:07:50] they got all kind of crazy
[1:07:51] interpretations and everything else
[1:07:54] hallelujah so they don't love a word you
[1:07:57] love these interpretations more then the
[1:08:01] word amen amen
[1:08:06] yes Peter needed love to assume his
[1:08:11] pastoral office and Peter denied the
[1:08:15] Lord three times before the crowed
[1:08:18] now what is Jesus doing Jesus is making
[1:08:21] him make a triple confession because he
[1:08:27] loves Peter he's not busting Peter
[1:08:29] [Music]
[1:08:30] brother Coleman busted me he's proven
[1:08:36] Peter because he loves you so he makes
[1:08:40] me turn around up on you and probe in
[1:08:45] there Oh hallelujah
[1:08:48] Ray's cut you get a revelation today
[1:08:54] nobody's busting you yes
[1:09:02] hallelujah it may be seen
[1:09:06] Peter spacious was wearing thin with God
[1:09:09] and these messages all these years the
[1:09:13] last 17 years especially trying has been
[1:09:15] trying to probe your love for the word
[1:09:18] and then you get annoyed and walking out
[1:09:22] I'll speak against the pastor he did
[1:09:25] this to me did that to me this to me and
[1:09:28] all Jesus in the pastor is trying to
[1:09:31] prove you love us down me love has found
[1:09:36] me love us down me well who's me me is
[1:09:42] the word then the pastor preaches the
[1:09:45] word to prove your wealth can you say

[1:09:55] last do you sure your sweet sister how

[1:10:08] no sword belongs in his hand for his gun
[1:10:11] a man sold in many get annoyed because
[1:10:16] of trying to prove she just speaks in
[1:10:19] filial love the third time now Jesus
[1:10:21] dropped from a gospel to filial he said
[1:10:24] Peter are you fond of me Peter and do
[1:10:29] you like me I mean uh do we have a nice
[1:10:34] friendship and Peter knew what he was
[1:10:38] doing there Peter knew he was had Peter
[1:10:42] knew he was being busted and sweetness
[1:10:45] and by the word Amen Peter was grieved
[1:10:49] the third time he was uneasy he was in
[1:10:53] sadness because his human sphere was
[1:10:55] exposed and he couldn't ruin it couldn't
[1:10:58] have and what was Christ doing Christ
[1:11:01] was breaking that will stay with you and
[1:11:06] all the rest leave busted our
[1:11:16] he broke it because he had failed Jesus
[1:11:21] and denied him and yet had boasted of
[1:11:24] his great love for the Lord yet he
[1:11:26] denied him for jesus knows now Peter
[1:11:29] saying I could jesus knows something

[1:15:52] don't he provailen with these strong
[1:15:53] messages praise God they're talking
[1:15:56] about New York City that he wants to
[1:15:58] bring out he wants to mold and shape and
[1:16:03] pull out and get a people ready for a
[1:16:05] blast of the Holy Ghost so I was down in
[1:16:11] Elgin honky Navas down in Puerto Rico
[1:16:13] taking on - rest April 1970 and I'll
[1:16:19] threaten the house and I'll keep walking
[1:16:21] out and look up on the mountain just
[1:16:23] flat top mountain up there I didn't know
[1:16:25] what it was so I asked this next-door
[1:16:28] neighbor was one witness the house name
[1:16:30] was Naomi I said Naomi what what is that
[1:16:33] up there and she's oh that's junkie
[1:16:36] junkie I said what's that mean she's a
[1:16:39] whoa the great Indian chief L junkie you
[1:16:42] know the Indians that was here before
[1:16:45] the Spanish from
[1:16:46] and he was a great chief because he had
[1:16:48] patience with all the people's problems
[1:16:51] he had patience and so they likened him
[1:16:55] to a blacksmith in the anvil that's the
[1:16:59] way the mountain was shaped like flat a
[1:17:01] blacksmith would take and put the thing
[1:17:03] in and hammer away and make it hot and
[1:17:06] shape and fashion it you see and I said
[1:17:10] oh I just put that man Son and Holy
[1:17:13] Spirit says go up there I'll meet you up
[1:17:14] there
[1:17:17] 1970 now you have to be around for a
[1:17:20] while to remember that a lot of people
[1:17:22] thought the 1977 was the end of the
[1:17:25] world and America was be destroyed and
[1:17:28] it was put that away just that way and
[1:17:30] God does things he put things a certain
[1:17:32] way
[1:17:33] you don't like to profit be up on a
[1:17:34] mountain and then the Holy Spirit says
[1:17:36] leave this in and take that out you send
[1:17:40] it type it up publish it but there be
[1:17:44] many will come in down their profits
[1:17:46] wrong here because it says over here
[1:17:49] that's for them not for you amen
[1:17:53] yes sir praise God he know that they
[1:17:56] would leave like the 70 what eats your
[1:18:00] blood drink your blood and eat your
[1:18:02] fresh what are you a vampire your false
[1:18:07] prophet it didn't happen 1977 see so
[1:18:12] anyway to go up there and I made
[1:18:16] arrangements to go up there and then
[1:18:18] have this being in the rain forests all
[1:18:20] the people from Puerto Rico know that in
[1:18:22] the rain forest there is a tourist
[1:18:24] attraction and then but they know what
[1:18:26] the mountain was up there he'll join him
[1:18:28] so I climbed up there and he get away up
[1:18:30] to the top you could miss it because
[1:18:32] it's like a little opening and I climb I
[1:18:35] found my way the Holy Spirit let me up
[1:18:37] in there when I got out also was blue
[1:18:39] sky and the islands and the water it was
[1:18:43] beautiful sight when she bring out over

[1:25:39] Peter or anyone go into service with
[1:25:42] filial love
[1:25:43] why not because because you will fail

[1:25:50] anointing of the seven seals over you

[1:25:57] and believers have failed because of
[1:25:59] Noah gap alone but a revelation has come
[1:26:02] to you many of us were serving him in
[1:26:05] filial love like Peter with a seventh
[1:26:07] under revelation and Peter had
[1:26:09] revelation also thought to Christ
[1:26:10] without the Holy Ghost and he failed
[1:26:13] when Jesus on that night and denied him
[1:26:17] three times they don't believe and in
[1:26:19] many of us fail Ehrman carnal worldly
[1:26:20] filial love so patiently except the
[1:26:23] words that they add to your temperance
[1:26:26] patience to see the patience to do well
[1:26:30] church lovest thou me love us now me
[1:26:35] without charity your service cannot be
[1:26:39] accepted you are useless you are nobody
[1:26:44] but if you were believeth Yves is one
[1:26:47] fine that you are predestinated unto
[1:26:52] adoption then he will heal you and seal
[1:26:56] you and bring on another Ephesians for
