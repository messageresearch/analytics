[3:14] how many would like to hear testify
[3:21] and what could I say about Italian band
[3:26] man praise God
[3:30] yes assistance in Tacoma and I favorite
[3:34] is when reason there's something there
[3:37] with the Italian band because when we
[3:40] first came up we was all together and
[3:43] they formed they helped form the local
[3:45] Christian assembly along with brother
[3:47] Ben sister Nadine the Whitaker's of
[3:51] course the the Hunts and and and Ben and
[3:55] brother hunt and then Sylvia : Ortiz
[3:59] sister elm and all the different ones so
[4:01] we've been down a long road way long
[4:05] road and a strange thing before we left
[4:08] a penny costs my mother had a dream in
[4:13] the end of 1960 or 61 just before we
[4:18] came to the message in nineteen may in
[4:20] 1961 she had a dream that my sister
[4:24] Coleman was worshiping with these white
[4:28] sisters and they all had long hair and
[4:31] we didn't have the faintest idea of what
[4:33] kind of dream that was as I look around
[4:38] here I see the dream has come to pants
[4:46] and then so we didn't know you know and
[4:50] so you don't know the footstep of the
[4:52] righteous older the Lord so the main
[4:55] thing I know is that April the 9th I was
[4:57] baptized into the kingdom of God I know
[5:00] anything about the message but I was
[5:03] born again and received the Holy Ghost
[5:05] and I thank God just a few months later
[5:08] sister Coleman likewise was baptized
[5:10] with the Holy Ghost also and not knowing
[5:15] that down the road did you want to need
[5:17] a wife like that in order to Pastor a
[5:20] church and so the Lord has been really
[5:23] good to us down 30 years and given us a
[5:26] lovely beautiful family and sons and
[5:29] laws and beautiful grandchildren so we
[5:33] have so much to thank the Lord for I
[5:35] tell you it's good to serve the Lord I
[5:37] believe that a man praise God amen
[5:43] praise God so I could think of so many
[5:47] you know blessings down the road mm aha
[5:51] when we went down to Jeffersonville 1961
[5:54] i I just we knew that we had to we had a
[6:00] special job to do in other words and so
[6:04] and I don't know brethren but the way I
[6:08] feel that my wife is my queen so how you
[6:12] feel about it but
[6:15] says you know properties 31 who could
[6:19] find a virtuous woman for her price is
[6:21] far above rubies the heart of her
[6:24] husband does trust in her so that he
[6:27] shall have no need of spoil she will do
[6:30] him a good and not evil all the days of
[6:33] her life and I can truly testify today
[6:36] that mr. Coleman has done me good all
[6:40] the days of our lives
[6:42] amen so I thank the Lord amen for her
[6:49] she's means more than a wife to me she's
[6:52] my friend she's my buddy amen
[6:55] I remember going down to the tabernacle
[6:57] and I always wanted to make sure that
[7:00] that she look right and looked good amen
[7:05] my two brothers but I can see my wife
[7:07] looking the best she can likes you're
[7:09] looking beautiful amen
[7:12] and I could say she is walking down this
[7:15] tree hey man so that's that's where I
[7:18] met her you know coming by us ain't she
[7:21] sweet walking down the street so anyway
[7:25] you know I like to get around a little
[7:27] bit you know me and so amen and I
[7:31] remember once an edict
[7:33] I was following well I was the artist
[7:36] for a department health and 125 word
[7:39] Street she worked across the street in
[7:40] motor vehicle building New York State
[7:42] and so then I would see where she would
[7:45] go and Neelix and then she be eating and
[7:48] then she'd look up out of wink that wink
[7:51] was devastating
[7:53] I knew that we had her she could not get
[7:58] away from that wing it was powerful so
[8:08] then I decided to play a little game and
[8:10] someone find out I'll let her think
[8:11] she's going alone on Chambers Street
[8:14] there was another Bank interest if you
[8:16] worked downtown you know I'm talking
[8:17] about
[8:18] so I went down the back entrance and I
[8:20] would bump into ana middle of the
[8:22] station Oh fancy meeting you here
[8:24] no it's all planned of course
[8:27] predestinated and she put a nickel in
[8:34] that old before and the nickel fell I
[8:36] was just so nervous you know I said
[8:38] don't worry honey try my nickel it's all
[8:40] right so anyway we had beautiful times
[8:47] together and I thank the Lord for it you
[8:49] know
[8:49] and I always want to see her looking
[8:51] good and I should go buy things myself
[8:54] and she loved that haven't been able to
[8:57] do that much in recent years you know
[8:59] it's been in you know then I memoir I
[9:02] Rebecca Smith Brandon Smith but you
[9:06] should tell her that it's just a brand
[9:08] I'm just a comment
[9:08] on the way she dressed and the way she
[9:11] carried herself and that meant a lot to
[9:12] me
[9:13] Amen so that's why brethren you know
[9:16] that's why you should love your wives
[9:18] and make sure that they look like Queens
[9:21] that is your queen amen there's nothing
[9:24] that I wouldn't give her if I had it I
[9:26] give it to her amen it's got appreciate
[9:28] her because when I met her it was just
[9:32] more than physical attraction however it
[9:35] was her spirit and she has a beautiful
[9:38] spirit she loves people and people never
[9:40] forget her we were just taking
[9:43] treatments over in a in a medical center
[9:45] those old woman there that was taking
[9:47] care of a husband he was like his half
[9:49] dead and she was feeding them and taking
[9:52] here my wife couldn't resist the
[9:53] temptation to go over and say something
[9:54] good to her
[9:56] and one was so blessed and I thought we
[9:58] were praying for you and just that you
[10:01] but your husband make it through so it's
[10:03] things like this that really bless me
[10:05] with her you know as we went down the
[10:08] road together and then I and we thank
[10:13] God that we had experiences together
[10:15] like when she came back from Tucson she
[10:18] had such a burden on a hole on a horse
[10:19] you could understand why where the
[10:21] people sold rye and didn't and she came
[10:24] back and and then Oh Lord she landed in
[10:27] February 6 1974 and the Lord spoke to
[10:29] her and said boomed out they are
[10:31] preaching six seals well inside of a
[10:35] heart came a revelation but you have
[10:37] been feasting on the hidden manna under
[10:40] the Seventh Seal now that was in 1974
[10:43] before they were Thunder to us you see
[10:46] and that was coming down from Joseph
[10:48] perfection the foundation and a lot of
[10:51] people they don't know what or what
[10:52] actually I'm doing or saying but the
[10:54] foundation was Joseph's perfection and
[10:57] that's when the prophet of God on June
[10:59] 14th says god bless you brother Coleman
[11:02] I was looking for you and brother on the
[11:04] inside to call you out on the outlaw and
[11:06] in five months later he did and he gave
[11:11] me an understanding of what brother
[11:12] Aaron was preaching while he was
[11:14] preaching it can we say Amen
[11:16] Italian band they all know it I was
[11:19] preaching Joseph perfection and then
[11:22] 5:00 a.m. December 26 I formed by the
[11:27] LIA fáil by the Peregrine I wasn't in
[11:29] Yuma I said what did what was the Nugget
[11:32] what was the bomb well bill you know
[11:34] leave bill well bill said the Lord
[11:38] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[11:39] shout and I asked for the period same
[11:41] thing that's oh my god
[11:43] the Lord has already descended what is
[11:46] young
[11:47] and so they didn't seem to know it so I
[11:50] just he said now go into pulpit and give
[11:53] the report about brother branham's a
[11:57] accident and his passing away and then
[11:59] tell the people all right lift up your
[12:01] head to get up from there the shout of
[12:02] the Kings in the camp and that's where
[12:05] we've been all set all the time
[12:06] we've been to we'd never stopped you
[12:09] know so I thank God for that and see
[12:12] this is my testimony you know so people
[12:15] have things that they say and whatever
[12:17] they well that's their business and had
[12:18] them do it me at all you know I'm a
[12:20] Christian because God saved me a man not
[12:24] only there's a man on the face of the
[12:25] earth that I cannot forgive sorry if if
[12:30] it was then I could not have broadly
[12:32] kindness for that know when he would not
[12:34] be there and so I thank God for that
[12:36] revelation of somehow compassion that's
[12:39] what it's all about forgiveness because
[12:41] faith is based on forgiveness
[12:42] so I thank God for that and you got to
[12:45] live it and you got to teach it oh you
[12:47] can make mistakes and you can have the
[12:49] things can happen and get out of sorts
[12:51] with a brother but that's that happens
[12:53] because we are all in the natural and
[12:55] that will happen brother Graham said you
[12:57] will make mistakes but the test is can
[12:59] you forgive that will always be the test
[13:03] otherwise you have any father could have
[13:04] to give you so I thank the Lord and then
[13:08] down through the years as we came down
[13:15] a 1972 experience ahead I wanted to
[13:20] express to my wife ha really loved her
[13:23] and now mailman's coming down the hill
[13:26] and God actually spoke to me and told me
[13:29] go home and tell her the these words and
[13:31] went home in November 1972 and told
[13:35] right straight from heaven a while I
[13:37] loved her and how I loved her and so I
[13:40] couldn't remember although I'll try to
[13:42] write it down and so I know that God put
[13:47] us together before the foundation the
[13:48] world and I know that I'm very proud of
[13:52] her and so I'm salute her today she's
[13:55] been a real wife and real mother and
[13:57] many times she was sick and weary she'd
[14:01] never complain about anything and then I
[14:04] thank God when seven thunders was
[14:07] revealed they don't mind you brethren
[14:10] anybody could have picked up the tapes
[14:12] and her heard and also read the books
[14:15] they laid there from 1965 to 1974 nobody
[14:22] said Thunder so that's my testimony the
[14:25] Lord told me or what they were and then
[14:28] that's what I had to stand for some
[14:30] people say well you say thunder too much
[14:32] and so forth and so on well that's what
[14:34] you say but you see but brother Branham
[14:37] laid out a seed a seven Thunder seed and
[14:40] therefore you have to say what it is
[14:44] otherwise we're going to come down to
[14:46] the harvest time because what do you
[14:49] want to get if you don't you didn't
[14:50] plant a seed so therefore they just saw
[14:53] on tears I'll reap in joy so we thank
[14:56] God for that
[14:56] and so anyway as we come down here now
[14:59] and I remember my 1962 we went in to see
[15:05] brother Branham and there was brother
[15:07] hunt sister hunt myself my wife it's
[15:09] just Alma Lauren's mother and we went in
[15:14] to see him and then my wife had a
[15:17] message from sister Millie for Shetty
[15:18] and she's down in Florida now and she
[15:22] knew the branham's and she's to tell
[15:24] brother Brown that I love him so much
[15:26] that I want to pull him into myself and
[15:29] so sister sister Mita was there in the
[15:32] study so my wife repeated that to
[15:35] brother Burnham and brother Branham told
[15:38] my wife he says just to Coleman I love
[15:41] me too so much that I want to pull her
[15:43] into me so that we may be one and so we
[15:48] never forgot those words you know that's
[15:50] why I always tell the husbands love your
[15:52] wives
[15:53] that's what the Prophet told us
[15:55] personally amen
[15:56] so I thank God to have a wife like
[15:59] sister Coleman and she doesn't say
[16:02] nothing but she did something yesterday
[16:05] that she doesn't know you haven't told
[16:07] yet and we having lunch in the Lord
[16:10] spoke to me and I've been waiting for
[16:13] months for to hear from God concerning
[16:15] just season right now and the Lord spoke
[16:19] to me and said go over see if he's
[16:20] finished lunch I want to speak to you
[16:22] and then but her the sushi got on right
[16:26] now and I won't thank the lord for
[16:29] sister iris she isn't here right now but
[16:31] she's been a real real help to her and
[16:33] others here at the choline and and
[16:35] different ones there but sister iris
[16:38] been taken around because I can't can't
[16:40] get around so my wife said no I'll call
[16:43] sister iris I still don't know how
[16:45] there's alcohol before I studied but I
[16:47] knew that the Lord said go upstairs you
[16:50] know she insisted
[16:52] and I so okay you know but I will do it
[16:55] you know so she went on and did a couple
[16:58] of things and when she went out then
[17:00] that's when the Lord spoke to me so you
[17:02] know you don't know that but when you
[17:05] went you insisted but that was a God
[17:07] making you insist so that he could speak
[17:09] to me and so I don't like splendid today
[17:13] but a burden is lifted from me I know
[17:16] I'm gonna be healed I normally be well
[17:19] amen
[17:21] praise God let's it be the name of the
[17:26] Lord I know all is well amen
[17:30] and I know that in here you're gonna be
[17:33] sealed and refill I know that the third
[17:37] phase is here and tomorrow we will show
[17:40] you the ending of the second phase so I
[17:43] praise God for that and anyway so as we
[17:49] say I'm saluting her today in honor of
[17:53] her birthday and I have something I want
[17:56] to give her after because I found a
[17:59] virtuous woman and her price is far
[18:02] above rubies so I have a little keepsake
[18:06] for her and she will remember me at this
[18:08] short little message that's left before
[18:10] we go to resurrection amen so anyway
[18:13] that is I want to thank all you for
[18:16] being in a day has been a day today we
[18:18] won't forget a man had made a law to
[18:20] richly bless each every one of you and
[18:23] give you a safe trip I just back home
[18:25] and just shared their brother hundred
[18:28] sit-downs not here amen
[18:30] so now I believe that some Eddie you
[18:35] want to
[18:37] I have some things that you want to
[18:38] present whatever this is the common
[18:41] language you come over here
[19:00] yes
[19:02] Oh
[19:06] well first I want to say uh I could
[19:10] never I don't ever remember meeting
[19:13] sister Coleman she was just always there
[19:16] she's like my mom
[19:19] she's timeless
[19:22] and um she she's very special to me and
[19:28] to my wife and to all the Deacons and
[19:32] their wives she has given of herself
[19:38] unselfish
[19:41] and as it were her life is very public
[19:45] and everyone sees when she's going
[19:50] through a trial or she's not well she's
[19:53] not feeling well and yet she greets you
[19:57] with this beautiful smile always and you
[20:03] could see that it's it's just God in her
[20:06] so sister Coleman may the Lord always
[20:10] shine in your heart as you shine in arts
[20:14] from the Deacons rushers and and their
[20:18] wives
[20:30] hold on what do you care beautiful wax

[22:39] you means something special to me and

[22:45] know that one day we're gonna take that
[22:47] flight all together we're not leaving
[22:50] one and I know we all feel the same way
[22:53] if we could help each other we're right
[22:56] there but by his grace and by his
[22:59] strength and of course you know how I
[23:01] feel about this man we've been through
[23:07] the waters we've been through the flood
[23:09] has been through the fire but God knows
[23:11] we made it by the grace of God because
[23:14] we we love Jesus and we always depend on
[23:17] him we don't depend on ourselves
[23:18] otherwise we never make it you know but
[23:21] he's the greatest you know

[23:35] he's a very good person he's been
[23:38] wonderful to me I have no complaints at

[24:28] love every single one anything I could
[24:30] ever do for any one of you I know there
[24:33] is something that I could do for each
