gave us a promise and the promise was that uh page 29 and what shall we do Jesus called of Christ he said the Dynamics for this church our church will be a refilling of what we work in a small measure the Dynamics to our mechanics and in that refilling will'll be a wonderful glorious baptism of the Holy Ghost where there is Faith a filling virtue power praise God knowledge huh Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and charity the Holy Ghost the person amen may be seated and when the person comes upon you his new name is in there oh Hall we just getting started oh my may be seated so therefore I just wanted to say that there and when I'm here to introduce the video a special video presentation and brother Paul Griffin it's over here amen you appreciate brother Paul Griffin my God Amen he's a man of many gifts amen may be seated brother Paul has many gifts and he put this uh presentation together and I believe it's going to bless you normally we we wouldn't do this here with a speaker like brother Theo over here but brother Theo is here and I'm here and all of us are here we are workers in The Vineyard we have a short time Amen to prepare the young people to jam it into you praise God we don't know what tomorrow holds amen but We Know Who Holds Tomorrow amen you may be seated so we just want to do all this together to help the young people and that's our song if I can help somebody then my living would be would not be in vain amen so that's what it's all about it's not Minister's uh quoting scriptures and new doctrines and interpretations and that ain't it listen brother 1946 God sent a prophet out in to get the people in the unity of the spirit that's first pull second pull of the spirit knowing that in the third pull he would bring the unity of the faith amen may be seated and believe me when the unity of the faith comes it ain't no Minister sitting around in the ministers meeting that ain't it brother it's a divine revelation Straight from Heaven you don't learn no book praise God be like in the upper room may be seated so that's why I thank God tonight anyway so I just want to kind of Set uh the stage for the presentation of the video title the line ofir roared who will not fear the lord God has spoken who can put prophesy amen so anyway I want to appreciate uh the youth ministry brother Jonathan here back here and brother Joey and all the youth ministry amen that's my boy amen train him up and the way should go amen may be seated and so we thank God for that and for all these wonderful young men and all the helps and the singers the what can we say the musicians over here everybody amen the sound all the sound people and everything okay quickly I ain't going to have too much time here so anyway uh now the line has roared who will not fear the the the the Lord God has spoken now that's a question today did he speak well then who can but prophesy [Applause] amen so anyway may be seated so Malachi 4 has revealed all of these mysterious uh truths that was hid in the Bible and you know as we as it was just take I did it in New York here a week I don't have it with me but take the Bible here brother BR if you don't understand what seven Scrolls roll up like this uh scrolls with little tabs sticking out see seals but put seven straps around there like like in Puerto Rico which is their seal down there amen Puerto Rico is a Bible the Lamb on it amen so now if uh only uh if only six seals was broken as the ministers say some of them well then the Bible is still sealed with the seventh one and there is no message so you might as well go on in the world so you might as well go amen can you say Amen to that all right may be seated the seventh seal if that is not broken then brother Bram did not deliver a message because his message was under the seventh seal amen so and the lamb broke that seventh seal and a l reveal that seventh seal but he you may be seated couldn't bring it all to the public but what it was it was the mystery of the Thunders it was the mystery of the coming of Christ and the Thunders hell the mystery and is being revealed in you that's why we shouting that's why we thanking God Amen it may be seated so therefore and when the seventh seal broke then the Bible that last seal broke then the Bible is open and I believe spoken words Original Seed I think page 58 somewhere around through there he says uh uh Elijah will plant the seed of the Bible from Genesis Plum through revelation well how could he do it if it was sealed with the seven seal amen amen Amen brother Kelly amen yes sir and then that is so and that means in Revelation 10 son of man Messiah come down on the earth and roared out seven Thunders [Applause] amen may be seated because before he could do that the Seven Seals that held the Seven Fold Miss of the Bible held the Bible closed that had to be open and when that was open March 17th uh 18th through the 24th then it was time for Revelation 10 Messiah the the prophet was supposed to open the the Mysteries and uh and and gather of all the Loose Ends and then go under the seven seal and tell you is it is seven Thunders banging 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 but going home it's not time yet but the seven Thunders under the seventh seal are connected to the coming of the Lord amen you may be seated and then when he slips down begins to reveal that Thunder message to you then the see is broken that Easter seal is broken which is a seven seal and you're under there like all the rest are amen so praise God it's been so much controversy that's why the Lord knew when he uh broke the seals and the prophet delivered the message and it was a silence put on it he knew that all these old Fighters cor and day and all the rest of them you knew he give years to die out he knew that with their unbelief they wouldn't go on and take the truths they wouldn't take a hidden message that laid in the pages of the Bible for the bride only which would beeve by Thunder amen may be seated so God knew that he had some young people under that he was waiting for my ah amen glory here they are Satan here they are here amen so there we are you may be seated and that's why you're shouting and praising God cuz the old Fighters they won't uh go over Revelation 5 verse 8-14 and worship King lamb they don't want to do it they want to sit dead in the church and argue and dis quotations about this and I think this and somebody spoke two words in tongues and I got one word of it oh what are you talking about brother praise God the whole Bible is open praise God Amen excuse me you may be seated I better get out of here cuz very nice in here and everything and I'm not supposed to be preaching I'm very tired but I'm supposed to set this video for you anyway and Eagle stir his nest uh before um my scripture uh Genesis 19 I'll just say it this way I'll just paraphrase it Genesis 19 we know the angel of God can walking down a dusty road one day amen and that was God and God said Elohim said uh come here Michael come here Gabriel let's go on down and see Abraham Because he believes the word huh he believes a promise amen say come here may be seated and he put 16 elements together together and they come walking down a dusty road about 12:00 noon praise God Amen so praise God and they received it maybe seated Sarah received the promise and then God said to Abraham now Abraham I'm going to send Billy Graham and all Roberts down to Sodom and they ain't got much of a message but they got to get lot out amen so they couldn't do it so they say well uh Abraham shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do I'm going to reveal these Thunders to you Abraham amen cuz I know Abraham in your churches you will teach your children that this message of Malachi 4 was the Thunders therefore Abraham your children will start a Revival in in the Thunders amen there are may be seated we not clannish now no we would to God everybody would be here tonight but some don't want to come amen what can we do what can we say but anyway you got the picture so anyway he says uh then Abraham went into intercession like you've been doing and he said Lord with your spirit fulfill 50 show our spirit for 50 you can find 50 amen they went on down to 45 and and and 40 and 30 20 can to find 10 he our spirit Abraham for 10 now 10 what 10 athletes 10 football players 10 volleyball players huh 10 uh would be preachers 10 what huh 10 with Christ Living in them amen you may be seated so therefore he couldn't find 10 so therefore he said I have to come on down and the only ones down that going to be saved is predestinated ones many going to think they are getting saved but but they will not be saved because the prophet had to preach a third pull to souls in prison and he had to do another thing he had to uh uh reveal all Seven Seals and reveal the hidden Mystery under the seven seal and then he had to have five manifestations go with it that's a third pull and we promise the same thing amen so I'm just cutting it up here so here's how you know when the angel will come to you now remember the prophet brings the word uh the shout and then the angel of God that's in the prophet that brought the shout certainly knows what he said so he comes as the Holy Spirit to confirm what he already said amen may be seated so the angel of God the voice of the Archangel is here tonight to confirm what the angel himself said in the prophet St Luke 17:30 the Holy Spirit when he's come he'll take the things of mine and reveal it unto [Applause] you amen you may be seated so therefore you got the the picture here now you want Revival well brother you have to get the word if you going to have Revival and Eagle stir this Nest page 26 before God was destroying Sodom he sent his Angel to warn Abraham why because Abraham was one who lived by the word and kept the word that is how Angels come to man because they keep God's word Three Angels Came to Abraham and told him a Godly prophet of God that God would destroy Sodom watch the reason for these Three Angels visit they were bringing the news of the last warning of Destruction and the angels left Abraham's place and went on to Sodom to tell Sodom of the pending judgment Sodom in return laughed at the angels and even sought to do evil to the angels oh how like the so-called churches of the world today a real God sent man will come into their city and they will seek to do him evil and hurt rather than stand behind them and the man's preaching the message reading the quotes anointed signs following it and they will still seek to do him evil because he didn't come out of their school or something that they haven't heard before amen so anyway and stand behind him and Bank him up and support him and pick he to the message but the Bible says that they would be like that anyway well he goes on to Second Timothy I just cut it off here and on your testimony on the sea I want to say this to encourage you tonight on uh testimony on the sea uh Dallas series page three he speaking about Jesus there with with the fisherman there brother Bram said here I I would have Lov to have living that day to follow him but you know I'm glad I still have the privilege of doing the same thing watching him do things and it's greater listen now don't be discouraged here it is greater to watch him today than what it was then huh there shouldn't be a sad eye nobody in despair everybody should be shouting and praising God greater for today amen may be seated and watching him do things and greater to watch him today than it was then I have more faith in him now and can have more faith now than I could have then because we've had 2,000 years to prove that the gospel is right and after 2,000 years he's still alive oh he's alive in you tonight so how much more faith should you have tonight amen okay amen prove he's still amen he's still alive and after 2,000 years he's still alive doing just as he did then so we have a greater assurance and a more foundation for Faith now than they had then because he was just a man going around with a claim that he was sent from God and was a Son of God and that God was vindicating his promis word of that day by him and they had somewhat the reason to doubt it now watch very careful here now very treacherous right here to doubt it the theologians they were and you notice it was a pathetic thing it was really pathetic because them theologians would have believe that if God had not blinded their eyes you mean the Pharisees you mean the Sadducees would have gladly receive Jesus Christ the ministers if God had not blinded them in that day you mean that they would have received the Thunders huh the seals you may be seated Jesus preached the seals in St Matthew 24 can we say Amen oh brother Brown preached the seals in the Book of Revelation Jesus omitted the seventh seal brother Bram omitted the seventh seal in that sense because he was a prophetic gift to reveal it and what did he reveal maybe seated brother Brandon revealed the same Jesus that would not preach it in St Matthew and that Jesus that would not preach it in and Matthew came in William brand and revealed it the coming of the Lord and we are here oh Hallelujah may be seated you mean to tell me that we are revealing the coming of the lord we hear the young people huh it's a mystery and the Thunders hold the mystery you may be seated anyway that was my thought and and did you know he promised that he would blind their eyes again today that they wouldn't see it they would be headyy high minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truth Breakers false accusers incontinent despisers those that are good having a form of God but would deny the power thereof and they would deny the power of the Thunders of they the power of the Resurrection The Power of Revelation they deny it oh but they they fine minister is fine man cultured man fine but they're false anointed cuz they're blind come out of there praise [Applause] God maybe seated so I'll just pass on I hope you got that if you are under one of these blind ministers pray for them but if God blinded him and you know that what the message is you better get out of there cuz there ain't no time left okay finish up here three kind of Believers page 46 though he may not give me the power to walk like Enoch and not have to die but just take an afternoon walk and go home with him but God I do believe that it will happen because I know that there is to be a Rapture in the last days and the work has to be cut short father so says our calendar 36 more years and the work will be over and you'll have to come sometime within that or there'll be no flesh saved so are we conscious tonight huh do we know where we at I don't want to scare the livers out of you because I cannot do it anyway cuz you're predestinated amen and you're going to receive the Holy Ghost everyone will be sealed seal Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah okay I'll cut it off pray you may be seated I preach this in New York on March 19th we had quite a Time H H New York Glory praise God may be seated but anyway I'm finished now I just had to bypass all that didn't even get into it the permanence of character and how you sat there in your ways and whichever way the tree is leaning he that is filthy be filthy you're leaning this way righteous be righteous filthy be filthy you don't know today that you be caught filthy so you better straighten up praise God tonight you don't know the day you don't know the time you don't know the hour so today you hear my voice heart not your heart amen may be seated the pope is coming in October 20th to New York United Nations wake up he's coming for the young people also they they ought to have two youth rallies like this in New York so why can't we have a lake champion in New York huh glory to God Amen may be seated okay let me wind it up I won't go on the rest of it I'm finished November 28th Al Luna Eclipse brother Paul you'll see the video Let's get it on now amen you see the video you see as brother Ram is speaking to California you see uh the uh uh lunar eclipse so don't miss it and brother Paul put it in there and you'll see it fading fading fading it's almost gone just about gone and don't forget now when the Luna Eclipse went off in November 28th uh the Seven Stars of pades that right pades amen he tells me these big words amen praise God plates on November 28th the seven Stars when the moon blacked out the church they were shining brighter than ever the seven Thunders seven voices seven Church ages huh seven eyes seven lamps seven spirits shining brighter than ever you may be seated so don't worry the church is blanked out and the Seven Stars are shining he said I'll give you the Morning Star yes sir you may be seated and brother Paul put the sharks in there so you see the sharks swimming there as brother R's preaching and he also put you in there right here amen so so anyway this is a final warning with final mercy and let's I was going to say other things here but the Holy Spirit Led me here and there and don't want to uh uh be I must say this here Christ V's own word uh Genesis Genesis 18 Genesis 19 and brother Ram said here on paragraph 69 you remember Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom what happened just before Sodom God came down with some angels and they had an investigation judgment said I've heard the cry that is so sinful so great so I've come down to find out whether it's alt together Truth Or Not other words God looked down and in leosa blind wretched miserable poor and naked and there were some people in Leia crying out so God come down in skin St Luke 17:30 he heard your cry so he come down to find out if you really want to be saved and he's still here tonight do you want to be saved do you want to be sealed he heard the cry amen and he could hardly find anybody may be seated that really wants to be saved and that was God veiled in the prophet coming to the elected seat Abraham then he come on down and he preach the souls in prison and then his message sunlit for 28 years and wound up in the 28th year uh February 28th as brother Dave spoke this morning David pummer walked out from under the seventh seal 28 years sunlit amen may be seated so it's an investigating judgment and that's when I go preach I go down to South and here wherever I go at I go to take the investigate and judgment I preach very hard because I want to see the Holy Spirit does see if you really want to be saved so I make it I stick it in there to see if you really want the word cuz I'm not playing with anybody's Soul amen may be seated so you come down to investigate the message has so we see now the moon's blacked out we don't know could it be over is it over I sure hope it's over so we have signs and we know there was a good Friday earthquake amen excuse me and we know that we we don't want no part of these plagues that's on the earth and you know what's left here and but anyway there's two influences on the earth young people I'm finished um we know on this Earth here um you could you influence by uh down and up and going down there's three phases going down Souls of the unjust demons then the devil and Hell itself and going up is the Holy Ghost angels and God himself now which one are you influenced by tonight well that's the way you going that's the way you're leaning may be seated that's the way it is so therefore I remember 1958 I was in the hospital my father was there with a stroke and a man he looked like he was was a a gambler or something High live a lot of rich friends in the bed in the bed there next to my father I was 1958 and I was going in and one night the man screamed out and backed up against the headboard trying to go back back and he sat up he said no no no what are you going to do with those chains please don't chain me don't chain me I wasn't saved I said what who's the man talking to it was demons with change ready to snatch his soul and take it to hell so you a wise guy here tonight huh who you think you are here tonight hey praise God you better thank God tonight that you are here hallelujah and you have a chance to be changed Oh Glory to God thank you Jesus finish
