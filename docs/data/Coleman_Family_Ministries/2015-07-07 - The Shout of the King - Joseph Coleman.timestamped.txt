[0:28] a sad day just like about 2,000 years
[0:32] ago when you in the days of your
[0:35] flesh when the enemy had cut you down
[0:38] and when you had gone your disciples
[0:41] walked to Earth and also they had sorrow
[0:43] and also they were sad the Lord Jesus
[0:46] the resurrected word of God moved upon
[0:49] the Earth and came and spoke to your
[0:52] disciples and said oh fools and slow
[0:54] heart to believe all that the prophets
[0:57] have spoken Lord God me the resurrection

[1:03] speak to our hearts that we might say

[1:26] great hour though we have sorrow now it
[1:28] shall be turned into joy for I
[1:31] believe now Lord that soon even now

[2:05] today and
[2:07] forever I want to greet everyone this
[2:09] morning in the name of the Lord
[2:12] Jesus we have a little long message this
[2:15] morning about an hour or so I don't know
[2:18] how long the Lord will lead us but I
[2:20] believe that the holy spirit this
[2:22] morning would be leading this way that
[2:25] we here uh for an understanding for we
[2:29] we come to God's house because because
[2:32] to receive understanding of the word of
[2:35] God we want to greet our dear sister
[2:38] Ellen Clark this morning she's sitting
[2:40] right here like ask her to stand up so
[2:43] you may see her because I'm going to I'm
[2:45] going to read something this morning
[2:46] this is Sister Ellen Clark God bless you
[2:49] she's she came through here by cuz
[2:52] through sister Ruth here and she's the
[2:54] seat of God and she's up in Rochester
[2:56] now and she has now has fellowship with
[2:59] uh the the the Scots up there in Buffalo
[3:02] so they have wonderful Fellowship now so
[3:04] God has a way of putting because putting
[3:06] his people together so but the reason
[3:08] she's here this morning um something
[3:11] that the Holy Spirit laid upon her heart
[3:14] and that something was uh those words
[3:17] which God gave her those words they were
[3:20] used to comfort brother bram's family so
[3:22] therefore because we have it this
[3:24] morning and also we like to read it this
[3:26] morning now uh before we go into the
[3:29] service we have brother Garcia here with
[3:31] us from now in Puerto Rico and just this
[3:34] morning some other eagles walked in here
[3:36] brother a can lar in the back here and
[3:38] also brother orz so brother Garcia he
[3:42] has asked brother huny and myself and
[3:44] also we are nothing he's asked us if we
[3:46] would lay hands upon him so therefore
[3:49] because he's a minister of God but he
[3:50] just like for someone because in this
[3:53] message to sort of lay their hands up on
[3:54] them and and so therefore we being here
[3:57] at church and also soling our own right
[4:00] are we going to do this this morning and
[4:01] we're going to ask brother candelario
[4:03] and also brother Artis to also come
[4:05] forward and and also brother Kurt as we
[4:08] would lay hands upon Him shall we turn

[5:58] God believe that the Great Eagle God has
[6:02] revealed his message because to brother
[6:04] Garcia brother candelario here also
[6:06] brother orz and there's a great job to
[6:09] do for this message now must go out to

[6:30] heart his heart and make that message
[6:32] live down in South America Puerto Rico

[6:42] eye by the Holy Ghost we see eye to eye
[6:45] here for we believe the same word of God

[10:59] [Music]
[11:20] amen praise God hallelujah
[11:23] [Music]
[11:29] God Amen well we thank God to know that
[11:33] there's one thing that we know that this
[11:36] message will never go into a
[11:40] denomination this is the end it can't go
[11:42] no further it's finished with it cannot
[11:45] be denominated God for it's Eagle time
[11:48] amen it is Eagle time amen so brother
[11:51] Garcia may God bless you and send you
[11:53] forth in his power brother Hunt and I we
[11:56] just want to help all we can and we we
[11:59] just join with all our brothers because
[12:00] across the world and I believe as the
[12:03] scriptures will show us today that
[12:06] though many people they don't believe
[12:08] what is taking place right here this
[12:10] morning because in the bride it's going
[12:12] to be that way see whether they believe
[12:15] it or not so therefore um it's strange
[12:19] that on this day that this should take
[12:22] place now um I want to announce that
[12:26] um um the funeral arrangement for for
[12:29] brother Brandon this
[12:33] moment Wednesday or there will be no
[12:35] service
[12:37] because God's Prophet brother brandham
[12:40] they're going to hold a funeral service
[12:41] for him we're not quite sure whether
[12:43] it's Wednesday or Thursday but I was
[12:46] told that it was supposed to be Thursday
[12:47] but it's still tentative so therefore
[12:50] perhaps here there will be some who
[12:52] won't because they you would want to go
[12:54] down there so if please feel because
[12:56] feel free to go if you have the means
[12:59] well then you go see so now um this is
[13:03] far as I understand the funeral
[13:05] Arrangement brother Perry call and told
[13:07] me that that brother Billy Paul and his
[13:09] family that they're leaving Tuesday far
[13:12] as I know this was as of yesterday
[13:14] morning and they're leaving Tuesday and
[13:17] and also a brother called me last night
[13:18] brother Ben Bryant and told me that that
[13:22] the body came in last night at 9:30 and
[13:24] he was out there to meet that body her
[13:27] brother Ben Bryant and they took it to
[13:29] the funeral paa and there he's resting
[13:32] now and so then he's uh they don't know
[13:35] anymore so then uh Billy Paul he told
[13:38] Perry green that don't let anyone see
[13:40] the body until he comes there so
[13:42] therefore the body as far as we know it
[13:45] cannot lie in state until uh because
[13:48] Billy Paul gets there that would be
[13:51] Tuesday perhaps maybe sooner I don't
[13:53] know so then now I understand that that
[13:55] his body is to lay there Tuesday
[13:58] Wednesday Thursday maybe Friday I don't
[14:01] know and also they want to give time for
[14:03] people to come from all over the world
[14:05] to see his body laying there now I
[14:08] understand that the Tabernacle small and
[14:11] that they're going to have a private
[14:14] family service and guest only of the
[14:18] family but the people they'll be allowed
[14:20] to because file through and just look at
[14:22] the remains of the body that's the way I
[14:25] understand it now this could change but
[14:27] as far as I know 30 jday is supposed to
[14:30] be the day we don't know whether it's in
[14:31] the morning whether it's at night or
[14:33] nothing but we haven't heard because
[14:35] they don't know themselves yet so as
[14:37] soon as we hear well then those of you
[14:40] if you want to go you can call us later
[14:42] on and perhaps if we get the message
[14:43] because then we can tell you so but we
[14:46] don't know as yet and we may find out
[14:47] this afternoon if so it will be
[14:49] announced tonight now does everybody
[14:51] understand that am Thursday attentively
[14:55] Thursday and the body will lie in state
[14:57] for about 3 or 4 days far as we we know
[14:59] now brother green told me that he's
[15:01] going that that he plans to have a
[15:03] memorial service out in Tucson that is
[15:07] if Sister media allows a body to uh
[15:10] because be buried out in in the west but
[15:12] seems like Billy Paul that didn't want
[15:15] to be burried in the west but sister
[15:17] brandom maybe because brother brandom
[15:19] said that he wanted to be buried in the
[15:20] East so therefore I don't know so if the
[15:23] body is to be bured in the west brother
[15:25] green he'll have a memorial service
[15:28] sometime in Jan January and there he
[15:31] allow all the brothers to speak and also
[15:33] have because I say a few words over you
[15:34] know and then that would be in January
[15:37] that is if the body goes out there
[15:40] because to be buried so then that would
[15:43] be the next service and that is on
[15:45] condition so that's as far as we know
[15:48] what is going on down in
[15:51] Indiana as everyone understand now amen
[15:55] now
[15:56] um uh we're here this morning
[16:03] we're here this morning it's a sad day
[16:05] in one way but nevertheless God servant
[16:08] he has brought us a
[16:10] promise so for us to understand the very
[16:13] thing that he was to bring us is here
[16:15] now be right at the door for the Rapture
[16:18] of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen so if
[16:21] though it's a sad day is also a joyful
[16:23] day hall for we waited they have all
[16:26] waited in the graves for this day
[16:28] they're now waiting for this to happen
[16:29] now this is the day that Paul and also
[16:32] all wanted to be living in this hour and
[16:35] we are privileged above all people to be
[16:38] living in this hour to see the coming of
[16:42] the Lord hallu his secret coming
[16:45] actually so now um just for about this
[16:48] morning I may be because a little
[16:50] lengthy I don't exactly know what to say
[16:52] CU I'm tired and we've been up all week
[16:54] and no sleep and the phone's been
[16:56] ringing because just about 24 hours of
[16:59] so to speak and we just had time to jot
[17:02] down a few notes so you pray for me that
[17:05] the Holy Spirit would say what he want
[17:07] said this morning for I don't know
[17:09] whether there's anywhere else around in
[17:11] the message this morning that the
[17:12] message is going forth I don't know but
[17:15] I know one thing that most of them are
[17:17] right now down in
[17:18] Indiana so God always has a witness up
[17:21] on Earth amen so brother Hunt and I we
[17:24] want to stand to post and preach the
[17:26] word amen and then Thursday we shall be
[17:29] there God willing so now um I want I
[17:33] just want to go back over his death and
[17:35] say a few things now from last Sunday
[17:38] morning there were a conflicting uh
[17:42] reports so actually I heard that brother
[17:44] brandom never changed since last Sunday
[17:47] but they just said that uh not that that
[17:50] they just said that because that's the
[17:52] kind of report that was given them see
[17:55] so therefore nobody actually knew what
[17:58] was taking place Place really but he was
[18:00] laying there I believe that he was with
[18:02] the Lord so that's neither here nor
[18:04] there though but now last Sunday morning
[18:07] brother Perry green when he was flying
[18:09] into
[18:10] Texas like I said Wednesday I believe it
[18:12] was he saw the moon in the East and also
[18:16] the moon was dark right at the small
[18:19] part of the Moon I'd say about eighth of
[18:21] because about eighth of it it was blood
[18:24] on the moon for the brothers saw this
[18:26] also that was a sign then Wednesday when
[18:30] he was failing and we announced that he
[18:32] had Wednesday night but actually he was
[18:33] dying then and therefore the doctors
[18:37] said to let the brothers go in and they
[18:40] all got together about 25 or 30 out in
[18:42] the waiting room and also all of them
[18:43] prayed and they asked for a sign at that
[18:46] time because kind of Cloudy there and
[18:48] the sun come out bright as an amber
[18:50] color and gave him a sign that was
[18:53] Wednesday after they prayed now Sunday a
[18:57] Friday evening at 549 I understand that
[19:01] the evening star came out brighter than
[19:04] has ever been before it's shine brighter
[19:08] than has ever been up on the face of the
[19:10] Earth and I'm told now that you just
[19:13] have to receive that this is what
[19:15] somebody told me so therefore because
[19:18] whether who said it it doesn't matter
[19:19] but I was told this I was told that
[19:22] through the
[19:23] moon Friday night the moon was setting
[19:26] in the west see last Sunday when a
[19:29] brother green went out there it was in
[19:31] the
[19:31] east then the moon rode a trail across
[19:37] the sky for 6
[19:39] days and it set in the west out in there
[19:43] sunset
[19:44] Mountain it rolled a trail there was a
[19:47] light right through the
[19:50] moon right through the evening star
[19:52] rather An Evening Star brighter than
[19:55] what has ever been before there was a
[19:57] light through it on either side it rode
[20:00] a trail from the East clean out through
[20:03] the West Amen Let God reveal it to your
[20:06] heart what it means if the evening star
[20:10] rode a trail across the
[20:13] skies it's amazing when and we in our
[20:16] natural Minds try to figure out
[20:17] something isn't
[20:19] it so um a center remarked that uh my
[20:24] isn't that evening star bright tonight
[20:26] it was brighter it was shining brighter
[20:29] in his death when he passed away it
[20:32] shined brighter than it was ever shined
[20:35] before so now we see that so it was said
[20:38] like I said that a trail went across the
[20:41] sky from east to
[20:43] west as Lightning cometh out of the west
[20:46] or out of the East now Sister Ellen
[20:49] Clark she's hand this assembly and she
[20:53] sent down to Sister Ruth some inspired
[20:57] words and and she I don't believe she
[20:59] really knows how inspired these words
[21:01] are so if I'm going to read it to you
[21:04] cuz a brother called me last night and
[21:07] told me he says who wrote that poem up
[21:10] there in New York so if I told him who
[21:12] it was he says everybody knows about it
[21:15] and they're making copies of it amen
[21:18] praise God so therefore brother green
[21:22] told me that out of everything I was
[21:25] said this poem really lifted up William
[21:28] brandom's family this poem here it
[21:31] lifted them all up and gave them Faith
[21:34] so therefore I like to read it now um
[21:37] this brother also so told me last night
[21:39] that there's enough in this poem for him
[21:41] to preach because until the Lord comes
[21:44] amen amen so we know it come right from
[21:48] God Amen and some of you sisters wonder
[21:51] what can I do stay still she's by
[21:54] herself amen she's all alone in
[21:56] Rochester seat of God therefore she
[21:59] wasn't trying to preach God spoke to her
[22:01] heart and she wrote so if you sit still
[22:04] a while God he'll speak to you also amen
[22:06] of Housewives and so forth and you won't
[22:08] have to preach he'll tell you what to do
[22:11] amen praise the Lord so this is the poem
[22:16] is entitled the
[22:19] hush and when he had opened the seventh
[22:23] seal there was silence in heaven about
[22:26] the space of a half an hour
[22:29] Revelation 81 what is this breath of
[22:32] Silence this hush of
[22:35] expectation a groan a tear a whisper a
[22:39] prayer question mark it is the closing
[22:42] scene of a great
[22:44] drama the time when Spectators wait open
[22:48] mouth gazing at the stage or the play
[22:52] has reached its climax it is the time
[22:55] the fingers of the entranc reader turn
[22:58] to the last page of his novel to find at
[23:02] last the key to the Intriguing mystery
[23:06] it is the hush before the dawn the
[23:09] Stillness before the flower opens and
[23:13] birds begin their
[23:15] song it is the breathless waiting of the
[23:18] eagle soaring high in the a with his eye
[23:22] on a serpent coil on a rock ready to
[23:26] strike this was Wednesday see and the
[23:29] serpent struck Friday but the eagle was
[23:31] soaring high in the
[23:34] a
[23:35] amen it is the hush before the wedding
[23:39] march begins as the bride prepared Waits
[23:44] at the door either your heart has been
[23:46] turned back or it hasn't for when Christ
[23:49] come he is filthy be filthy amen either
[23:52] Elijah has turned your heart back or he
[23:53] has not he's
[23:55] failed as the bride prepared Waits at
[23:57] the door and the eyes of the bridegroom
[24:00] turned to look at her it is the last
[24:03] groan The Last Tear the last whispered
[24:07] prayer of the expectant mother noted
[24:11] sorrow who gives at last all
[24:14] strength she has and brings forth life
[24:19] Joy I am Alpha and Omega the beginning
[24:22] and the ending which is which was and
[24:24] which is to come the almighty that was
[24:26] written by this sister right here in
[24:28] spite of the Holy Ghost so we want to
[24:31] know what can we do for the Lord sit
[24:33] still God will tell
[24:35] you amen praise the Lord so we thank God
[24:38] for that that God allowed it but brother
[24:41] Hunt he called brother Perry we felt led
[24:44] to get this down to brother brandom that
[24:46] somebody May read it to him and brother
[24:48] Hunt he got Perry on the phone and also
[24:50] he wrote it down word for word and and
[24:52] read it to him and also everybody
[24:54] waitting because down the waiting room
[24:55] down there and now brother Ben briyan
[24:57] told me that they want to make up copies
[24:59] and they want to pass it around but she
[25:02] has the rights to it but actually is the
[25:03] holy spirit so I guess it's all right
[25:06] amen praise the Lord so therefore
[25:12] um that was the
[25:14] hush so it really lifted up the family
[25:17] and
[25:19] um oh yes brother green said that it may
[25:22] be read at the funeral service so I
[25:24] don't know you and now notice something
[25:27] very strange about Texas isn't it the
[25:31] pill of fire first appeared in Texas
[25:33] 1950 I believe it was life appeared in
[25:36] Texas President Kennedy was killed in
[25:39] Texas is that
[25:41] right brother brandham was there was a
[25:44] blackout first in New York then in Texas
[25:49] and God's Prophet was blacked out in
[25:52] Texas there was death and life in Texas
[25:56] and now straighted cuz strange now that
[25:59] Johnson is in Texas President
[26:03] Johnson and also want to really come
[26:05] forward and and also helped brother
[26:07] Brandon family Perry Green from down
[26:10] Texas so we don't understand it's all
[26:13] spiritual actually what this means so
[26:15] but God's Prophet was blacked out in
[26:18] Texas New York also had a blackout we
[26:21] all know what that
[26:23] means so all we know is that what these
[26:26] things are on now we understand also
[26:29] that sister meanie last week in the room
[26:34] this week last week that she saw brother
[26:37] brandham and he stood by a bedside there
[26:39] it was a vision and he told her that
[26:43] that I have to go away for a little
[26:44] while because I have to go away but I
[26:47] will be back in a little while at the
[26:49] last Trump Jes this is what I heard a
[26:53] sister had a dream of brother brandham
[26:55] saying these very words and he would be
[26:58] back in the resurrection at the last
[27:00] trumpet amen the death in Christ shall
[27:02] rise first Hallelujah shall walk to
[27:04] Earth for witness on there brother he's
[27:08] living he's not

[30:49] will God bring with him for this we say
[30:52] unto you by the word of the Lord which
[30:56] we seing here this morning that we which
[30:58] are alive and remain until the coming of
[31:01] the Lord shall not prevent them which
[31:03] are asleep for the Lord himself shall
[31:06] descend from heaven with a shout with
[31:08] the voice of the Archangel and with the
[31:10] Trump of God and the death in Christ
[31:12] shall rise first then we which are alive
[31:14] and remain now notice now we which are
[31:18] alive dead in sins and trespasses only
[31:21] the quickening of power makes your life
[31:22] amen amen amen we which are quickened
[31:25] let us
[31:26] say and remain shall be caught up
[31:29] together with them in the clouds to meet
[31:31] the Lord in the air and so shall we ever
[31:33] be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one
[31:36] another with these words that's what I'm
[31:38] doing this morning by the grace of God
[31:41] you are to be comforted with these words
[31:44] that you sorrow not even as they in the
[31:45] world sorrow for the joy of your
[31:48] salvation you're going to drink The
[31:50] Waters from the wells of Salvation which
[31:52] is the word of God do you believe that
[31:54] amen that's going on now thank you Lord
[31:57] so
[31:58] now I like to title this the shout of
[32:00] the king it's going to be a shout and we
[32:04] want to and we notice here that that
[32:06] three things are here that is said here
[32:09] that there's a shout that there's the
[32:11] voice of the Archangel and there's a
[32:12] trump of God so by God's grace this is
[32:16] to be explained this morning not by me
[32:19] but by it was explained by God's Prophet
[32:22] when he preached the last message the
[32:24] Rapture of the bride God loves you so
[32:27] much that that he allowed these this
[32:30] Revelation to because to come to us this
[32:32] week so if because we have it this
[32:34] morning and want to give it out to you
[32:36] amen amen comfort with you with these
[32:40] words is the word of God's Prophet his
[32:43] messag amen got to live in your heart
[32:46] now we know that it's a sad occasion
[32:47] like we say God's Prophet brother Braham
[32:50] he's laying because his remains rather
[32:52] was laying down in that funeral PA and I
[32:55] myself I stand here because because
[32:58] through his
[32:59] ministry I met the Lord before because
[33:01] because I heard about him but now I'm I
[33:04] know beyond the shadow of a doubt that I
[33:07] am in the bride amen cuz I receive the
[33:09] word of God which he preached and we
[33:14] know that we have this promise we have
[33:17] the promise for it was promised that
[33:20] before the Dreadful and terrible day of
[33:22] the Lord I will send you Elijah and he
[33:26] will turn your hearts back to the
[33:29] apostolic F amen he will come and reveal
[33:33] all the scriptures seated a serpent
[33:35] Catholic church and all these things
[33:37] tell you who is the White Horse the
[33:39] white horse rider the red horse rider
[33:40] he'll tell you these things see then
[33:43] when you hear these things your hearts
[33:46] will be turned back to the apostolic
[33:49] fathers waiting for the same promise
[33:52] that they have I'll send my spirit upon
[33:55] you in that day you shall know you're
[33:58] waiting for the same thing right now
[34:00] either your hearts have already been
[34:02] turned back or they haven't either Elias
[34:07] is is already come and brought the truth
[34:11] the message to you see or either he
[34:14] would have to be resurrected and start
[34:16] all over again but I don't know the
[34:19] scripture doesn't say that though they
[34:21] are many this morning down Indiana
[34:24] looking for brother brandom to be
[34:27] resurrected they have gathered there
[34:29] from all over and they're there and
[34:31] though we were told that nobody can see
[34:33] the body this morning but they're there
[34:36] so I say if it's God's will for his
[34:39] Prophet to be resurrected then let God's
[34:43] will be done that's what I say but if I
[34:47] have a charge I have a charge and I have
[34:49] to stay there and preach the word in
[34:51] season out of season so now we find then
[34:55] that we have this promise we are to
[34:58] comfort one another with this promise
[35:00] that he will return he said he had to go
[35:03] away to prepare a place for us if it
[35:06] were not so I would not have told you
[35:09] let not your heart be troubled neither
[35:11] Let It Be Afraid amen for he said in the
[35:14] same chapter if you believe this then
[35:17] arise and let us go hence Amen to meet
[35:20] the bridegroom is that right that's the
[35:23] scriptures amen so we find then that the
[35:26] word of God is settled forever before
[35:29] the foundation of the world it's not
[35:31] going to change today other words if God
[35:35] did not ordain for his Prophet this
[35:39] morning to rise I don't care if 500
[35:42] million people are down there it won't
[35:44] change God's will Thy word oh Lord is
[35:48] settled forever in heaven it's already
[35:50] settled but he brings it forth in each
[35:53] age and then the the people are blind
[35:57] this is is the eagle
[35:59] age the age when the Eagles will pick it
[36:02] up by the revelation of the of God what
[36:05] is faith faith is the revelation of
[36:08] God's will then God must reveal his will
[36:12] what we are to
[36:13] do now we find then that three things
[36:17] are said here like I said the Lord
[36:20] himself personal healed his sin but
[36:23] notice his body stays in the air his own
[36:27] because own Corporal body stays in the
[36:29] air but his anointing or his great power
[36:34] comes up on the earth with together with
[36:39] a shout it comes together with a shout
[36:42] we want to find out what is the shout
[36:44] see and then you know what is going to
[36:46] happen so we find then
[36:49] that uh God in this evil age in
[36:54] 1933 when his Prophet who was born a
[36:57] prophet he didn't become a prophet in
[36:59] 1963 he was born a prophet but they're
[37:02] just now trying to figure out is he the
[37:04] prophet is he the Elias which want to
[37:07] come he was born a prophet he was a
[37:10] prophet in God's mind before the
[37:12] foundation of the world see so therefore
[37:17] he was baptizing the 17th person down on
[37:19] the banks of the Ohio and there with
[37:22] about 5,000 people standing around there
[37:24] the pill of fire swung down the Lord
[37:26] himself come down in the form of a pill
[37:28] of fire and boomed out now listen now
[37:32] I'm going to quote God's Prophet because
[37:35] right now brother hun I we have come
[37:37] against many things in the past this
[37:39] week there are people now coming trying
[37:41] to say hold you to every word I'm
[37:44] quoting the word and I'm and also I'm
[37:46] quoting God's Prophet word I ain't
[37:49] saying anything so brother com did not
[37:51] say it see the word says it and I
[37:54] believe the word amen they're trying see
[37:57] there are those who don't know what to
[38:00] say they don't know what to preach and
[38:03] very quickly they will start a
[38:05] denomination see other words what are we
[38:09] all going to do I don't know what you're
[38:10] going to do I'm going to do what he tell
[38:12] me to do I'm going to say what he tell
[38:14] me to say whatever God tells you to say
[38:18] say it and whatever he tells me I'll say
[38:20] that s to me now and I'll say it in
[38:23] faith for I believe it for he's called
[38:26] me to preach this
[38:27] amen amen if I didn't believe it I
[38:29] wouldn't I'd be sitting down there so we
[38:32] find then that in
[38:34] 1933 the evening time light message
[38:38] started in
[38:40] 1933 it didn't just start it started
[38:42] there it was the word His prophets
[38:45] thoughted he was bringing the word so
[38:47] those that received the word from him
[38:50] that was the seat of God and he'll raise
[38:52] him up in the resurrection he'll see all
[38:55] of his friends and there's thousands of
[38:56] them and screamed oh brother brandom
[38:59] that was the word the word born pride of
[39:02] Jesus Christ since 1933 when he began to
[39:06] go out that was the word he preached the
[39:09] word in season out of season and nobody
[39:12] believed in what he was saying just like
[39:14] now you see you can't sit down and say
[39:17] this and that you can only see eye to
[39:20] eye by the eagle anointing amen that's
[39:22] all you can only say eye to eye by the
[39:25] Holy Spirit other words if when brother
[39:27] Brown when he was preaching the only way
[39:29] that if we were up here in New York
[39:31] preaching we would have to say what he
[39:32] said by the Holy Ghost amen that's how
[39:35] you know see if you're saying the same
[39:37] thing you can't wait to get the tape and
[39:40] then play 11 times and then then it's
[39:43] dead then you see but if you've been
[39:46] called you'll say what he's saying it'll
[39:47] be on the table it's in the word see if
[39:50] you preach the word so then the voice
[39:53] boomed out this is the message now which
[39:57] is coming this morning this is part of
[39:59] the message as John the Baptist forun my
[40:03] first coming so shall your message
[40:07] forerun my second coming and you know
[40:09] that we have tried to drive that home to
[40:11] you amen so as John the Baptist in his
[40:15] natural flesh stood before me so shall
[40:20] your written message stand before me
[40:22] when I come with a
[40:25] shout amen but but I will Quicken your
[40:29] written message in many hearts and then
[40:32] they'll know that the King has come with
[40:35] a shout is in their midst and they'll
[40:37] have something to cry about they'll
[40:40] speak Thou Art to Christ for they know
[40:42] in that day for now we know in part we
[40:45] prophesy in part but when the great eego
[40:48] knowing comes you'll know as even he
[40:50] knows you you'll know him for he will be
[40:53] in you the fullness of God in you so we
[40:56] find then
[40:57] where is This Promise found like that
[40:59] Malachi 4 5 and 6 Revelation 10:7 St
[41:04] Luke
[41:05] 17:30 it's found right there in three
[41:07] places so other words it says there in
[41:10] Revelation 10:7 your message will wind
[41:14] up all the Loose Ends from the spirit of
[41:17] man age cuz man tries to figure it out
[41:19] he doesn't really understand it even in
[41:21] this age right now if a man has the Holy
[41:24] Ghost he's Anointed with the Holy Ghost
[41:26] but he has to study and did everything
[41:27] together see and then he go preach a
[41:29] message and also he's anointed see but
[41:32] um when that great inspiration Eagle
[41:35] comes he'll just stand there for the
[41:37] words in him it'll anoint that word out
[41:39] it comes amen amen you see so therefore
[41:42] that's spiritual Revelation on the word
[41:43] of God so therefore your message will
[41:47] wind up the Loose Ends and introduce the
[41:51] Messiah so we know that God's prophet in
[41:56] 1963 three the Lord himself came down in
[42:00] the days of the voice is that right the
[42:05] voice came together with a prophet sign
[42:09] in 1963 see and spoke out the revelation
[42:13] of Jesus
[42:14] Christ that could only be the son of man
[42:17] revealing himself that's all it could be
[42:19] for the son of man has revealed himself
[42:22] down Through the Ages he revealed
[42:24] himself in the bride on the day of
[42:26] Pentecost
[42:27] he revealed himself in Paul arenius St
[42:30] Martin and so forth but in different
[42:33] forms not always the same way see Amen
[42:36] in different
[42:37] forms so therefore we find then that
[42:41] John wound up the Old Testament took all
[42:44] the loose ends for they didn't quite
[42:46] know what was going on who was the word
[42:49] for they had traditions and Commandments
[42:51] of men they had Pharisees and Sadducees
[42:54] and essenes but John the Great Prophet
[42:57] moved on the scene and tied them all up
[43:00] together and then he preached the word
[43:03] the Messiah is at hand he preached the
[43:05] word so then we found that that same
[43:08] Spirit see and John called out an
[43:11] elected group and then the word himself
[43:16] came on and took that group on with the
[43:18] word did and that word be to laying that
[43:22] presence there that right of the son of
[43:24] man reveal himself to his disciples amen
[43:28] so notice now son of man always comes
[43:32] before Son of God son of man is
[43:35] Prophet amen amen son of man Christ
[43:40] brought the message for his
[43:43] hour then he had the seed Jour of life
[43:47] in him for he was the Living Word of
[43:50] that age is that right amen for the
[43:52] anointing came down a sign a dove up on
[43:54] his shoulder there is that right amen
[43:56] and he was anointed with life in his
[43:59] body and he gave out his written word
[44:03] and but it was quickened into his
[44:05] disciples Hearts then the seed lay in
[44:08] their hearts they understand it see they
[44:11] understand that they didn't understand
[44:12] until he came in a resurrection Ministry
[44:15] like we waiting for to open their
[44:18] understanding to the
[44:20] scriptures but they laid there so we
[44:23] find then that that son of man God
[44:27] Prophet
[44:29] introduced the Holy Ghost age then the
[44:32] Son of God poured out himself over those
[44:35] seeds of God in the upper room that
[44:37] started the great Holy Ghost age but he
[44:41] gave a promise he said that in the end
[44:44] time as it was in the days of lot and
[44:48] Noah I will again reveal myself see
[44:53] through a body amen amen amen and that
[44:58] will be the son of man revealing himself
[45:01] again for he must come first before the
[45:06] Lord himself descends with a sh the son
[45:10] of man must come with a promise for this
[45:14] age and call out seeds from all
[45:19] Pharisees and Sadducees is that right
[45:22] Baptist and Methodist and so forth call
[45:23] them all out of there see and then they
[45:25] follow that son of man man Prophet not
[45:30] God Prophet see man Prophet amen see son
[45:32] of man for Ezekiel was called son of man
[45:35] also then he was to take them right up
[45:39] to the
[45:40] Rapture take them right there and preach
[45:43] the Rapture to them and reveal it to
[45:45] them then we don't know perhaps he was
[45:48] supposed to leave the scene some believe
[45:51] it and some
[45:52] don't cuz some are waiting for him to
[45:54] come back for them see but according to
[45:58] your faith be it unto you see me now but
[46:01] what I'm going to say what the scripture
[46:03] says amen no matter what the people
[46:05] believe some were looking for a great
[46:07] tent Ministry and I was told about that
[46:10] that um you can't really tell what the
[46:12] prophet for Prophet speaks in Parables
[46:14] amen amen Jesus did amen why wouldn't
[46:17] Jesus explain it to them that was God
[46:19] himself amen see oh fools and slow of
[46:24] heart to believe all that the prophets
[46:26] have said MH so then the prophet said
[46:30] many things he purposely says these
[46:33] things cuz that's God's will he's got to
[46:35] say do what his father tell him so he
[46:37] had a series of Visions with a tent and
[46:39] so forth but nobody can say whether it
[46:41] was a symbol what did it mean for he
[46:44] spoke the word he spoke the word right
[46:47] here in this congregation right in the
[46:49] back here on S the Law's Joy amen had no
[46:52] Joy B had to come out he prayed over the
[46:54] phone with me on the phone and he prayed
[46:57] not me other words he spoke the word not
[46:59] me see word has been going on amen amen
[47:04] amen see I mean uh when God does his
[47:07] thing and he put it on Telephone that's
[47:10] why the telephone Ministry came this
[47:11] year so he would announce on the
[47:14] telephone all across the country that
[47:16] the people might know that there's a
[47:17] bride following him every 200
[47:22] miles he got the message home somewhere
[47:25] he got it home every 200 miles somewhere
[47:26] amen right down in Puerto Rico here down
[47:29] South America over in Europe the message
[47:30] went
[47:31] out spoke the word went out also he said
[47:35] on this uh wings of a white dove if I
[47:38] could tell you the Miracles and the
[47:40] signs that was done in the past three
[47:42] years you wouldn't believe it see so but
[47:46] however Jesus did his things and very
[47:49] very few people saw it very very few saw
[47:53] what he did see so we just don't
[47:58] understand these things so therefore it
[48:00] pays to believe the scriptures amen
[48:02] don't look for some great thing like
[48:04] this here cuz we were fool once before
[48:06] in '
[48:07] 63 praise the Lord some sisters they
[48:10] wanted to see angels with tempet up in
[48:13] the sky and everything but see it's the
[48:15] word coming forth am so we find then
[48:18] that that uh son of man Prophet God
[48:22] Prophet called out seeds of God from
[48:25] Pharisees and sad J and so forth elected
[48:28] pre destinated seats of God for that
[48:31] hour they were the seat of the hour and
[48:33] he called them out they had to come
[48:35] something inside made he says follow me
[48:38] they didn't say what was it
[48:40] underlined you follow me now they didn't
[48:43] ask no questions they followed him what
[48:45] tape was that on he didn't mean that he
[48:48] said this over here he said say what I
[48:50] said that's what he said is that right
[48:54] don't change what I said cuz you have
[48:56] not been ordained to change it only the
[48:57] Eagles are they understand it and
[49:00] they'll preach it they'll feed the flock
[49:02] see the Eagles will so we find then that
[49:06] the son of man then was to bring a
[49:09] message what is a message a message is
[49:12] the thoughts in God's mind for that age
[49:15] and then that message when come out is
[49:17] the word for the age then message word
[49:21] came by Christ son of man he revealed
[49:24] himself how with a sign is that right
[49:28] pill fire he told Nathaniel behold an
[49:31] Israelite indeed in whom there is no God
[49:34] whence thou knowest me Rabbi I saw you I
[49:37] saw you you see so we saw another son of
[49:40] man come do the same thing thousands of
[49:43] times still they don't believe it but he
[49:46] did it amen amen so then we find then
[49:49] that that son of man had a message the
[49:52] word not to be spoken to individually
[49:55] see but to believe all that the prophets
[49:59] have said amen the scriptures believe
[50:02] the scriptures then that was a message
[50:06] that message was the word of God that
[50:07] was the word the word of God that was
[50:10] God himself amen then we find in that
[50:13] Christ was God's seed
[50:18] message now notice this now listen to
[50:20] what I'm saying very carefully now
[50:22] Christ the word was God's seed message
[50:27] but that seed message did not live in
[50:30] the heart yet it was there until it was
[50:34] quickened by the Holy Ghost Amen on the
[50:37] day of Pentecost are you beginning to
[50:40] understand it now amen but that message
[50:42] was in their hearts for they was
[50:45] restored am they was restored from the
[50:48] fathers to Little Children amen is that
[50:50] right amen he went to all the old
[50:52] traditions and got out some children and
[50:55] they was restored John did that amen
[50:59] then John said I must decrease as he
[51:02] increases but he had to preach marriage
[51:04] and divorce before he left the sea amen
[51:08] it's in the scriptures so then we find
[51:11] then that Christ was God's seed message
[51:14] but it did not live in Hearts until it
[51:16] was quickened by the
[51:18] spirit then we find what did the spirit
[51:20] do the Holy Spirit did the following the
[51:24] Holy Spirit In Jesus Day called out the
[51:27] seeds of God from different
[51:28] denominations is that right call them
[51:30] out then it preached to souls in
[51:33] prison then signs followed the message
[51:37] word Jesus the word had signs following
[51:40] him just like today see raise the Same
[51:45] Spirit raise Christ from the dead see if
[51:49] it be in you it shall also Quicken your
[51:51] mortal body and Resurrection also made
[51:53] Christ live for 40 days
[51:57] 40 is a judgment are we going into the
[51:59] Judgment
[52:01] huh then it came when they died out it
[52:06] came on them for power for service amen
[52:09] the spirit of God did Same Spirit that
[52:11] was up on Christ that same anointing he
[52:13] was the original corn of wheat he abided
[52:16] alone as long as he walked Earth himself
[52:19] that would be the only fruit amen but
[52:21] first fruits go back to God for it's a
[52:24] law in Leviticus 23 am amen back to God
[52:28] it must be offered back to God then the
[52:31] first mature corn of wheat must be cut
[52:35] down bruised battered and be offered
[52:39] back to God that the Holy Spirit might
[52:43] come back up on the seeds of God that
[52:46] was called out of all denominations that
[52:49] are waiting on a promise for the Lord
[52:51] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[52:54] shout the voice of the archangel it's
[52:57] Eagle time what are you looking down for
[52:59] look up rise let us go hence look
[53:03] up we were promised a message for today
[53:07] amen did we receive the message did it
[53:11] go forth in
[53:12] 1933 was it Vindicated before the whole
[53:15] world Amen in
[53:17] 1963 when the pfy the Lord the voice of
[53:21] the seventh angel when the V when each
[53:23] angel came down in the room there and
[53:25] the pillow fire and spoke out the white
[53:27] horse riders the pope you follow me now
[53:30] amen you see me now then the then then
[53:33] the prophet preach the unveiling of the
[53:35] Mighty God God before you reach the
[53:39] promised land god comes down and reveals
[53:42] himself in human flesh amen he did it
[53:44] with Moses amen as a sign amen that
[53:48] we're on a way to restore Faith we're
[53:50] going to the promised land de with
[53:53] Abraham also I want to prove that so
[53:56] then what has transpired
[54:00] today call therefore the word message
[54:04] has call out seeds by the word how did
[54:07] it do it the son of man reveal himself
[54:09] today that right stood right there and
[54:11] call out the secrets of their hearts
[54:13] amen but a prophet when he's doing it
[54:16] always speaks hint for he says he will
[54:19] come and do it while he's doing it
[54:21] amen see they now amen then it go over
[54:24] top of their hands they miss it then
[54:26] they say what where where where he just
[54:28] did it amen cuz he called our brother
[54:30] Hunt say your name is Mr Hunt and you
[54:32] praying for your sister she has asthma
[54:35] and he says I'm his friend he called me
[54:37] his the Holy Ghost called me his friend
[54:39] am so therefore can't nobody get in
[54:41] between us amen with different tales and
[54:43] things don't try it for God called his
[54:46] friends in Tabernacle he said that's Mr
[54:48] Coman your friend and his father had a
[54:51] stroke as thus sayith the Lord amen then
[54:53] I couldn't hold it back I had to let it
[54:55] go am on to tape
[54:58] that God I had to shout for it was
[55:01] revealed to me who it was amen so then
[55:05] we know we see then
[55:07] that this promised word Malachi 4 had
[55:12] life to it it was anointed and that's
[55:15] what made us turn the life in him see
[55:19] made you turn to that word if you could
[55:21] be sitting anywhere and hear a tape and
[55:23] hear the prophet on a tape you say that
[55:24] sounds real that's differ amen that's
[55:28] life speaking to you that's God revealed
[55:32] in human flesh speaking to you that's
[55:34] why God himself speaking out of human
[55:37] flesh revealing to your heart he said
[55:39] I'll turn your heart back before that
[55:41] your heart was in some old dead
[55:42] Pentecostal church somewhere am right
[55:44] but he said I'll come and restore your
[55:46] heart back to the word message did he do
[55:48] it amen are you sitting here amen he
[55:51] must have done it amen amen you don't
[55:54] know how close the Rapture is
[55:58] so then we find then that the seed germ
[56:01] in the prophet was imparted To Us by the
[56:05] written word right for the hour and we
[56:09] received it but we just can't get that
[56:11] power amen we want to pray in the spirit
[56:15] we want to preach with power we you want
[56:16] to you can't do it can you see me now
[56:19] you're waiting to be quickened it must
[56:21] be quickened first amen all the
[56:25] scriptures must be fulfilled CH amen you
[56:27] see a corn of wheat must be cut down by
[56:30] the Lord bruised and so forth and offer
[56:33] back up to God on the wings of a snow
[56:36] white
[56:36] dove don't miss that amen so therefore
[56:41] we find that afterwards when the message
[56:44] come Malachi
[56:46] 4 then the message must live to be
[56:49] quickened for the body is dead right now
[56:53] that right this body is dead the body of
[56:55] Christ is dead the body without the
[56:57] spirit is dead the spirit hasn't come
[56:58] yet cuz it's just laying there asleeping
[57:01] giant now the the scripture says that
[57:03] it's laying there amen sleeping that's
[57:06] right so we find in that the dead body
[57:09] the spirit of God make it live but God
[57:12] has a law for in St John 16 he told him
[57:15] that because because use a parable it us
[57:17] a natural woman that when she is to
[57:19] because in travail that she must have
[57:22] sorrow first amen see she had a sorrow
[57:25] when he died the corn of wheat died she
[57:28] had a sorrow but he rose from the dead
[57:31] the third day is that right then she had
[57:34] joy for at the end of the third day the
[57:38] third day started in the end time in
[57:40] 1906 that right amen he was the same
[57:44] yesterday today and forever he told
[57:47] those cuz he told Mary and them there
[57:49] ktha and them there go tell my brethren
[57:52] that right amen well he appeared in
[57:54] theza Street in 19 six go tell my
[57:57] brother that I
[57:58] live I speak in tongues and once to heal
[58:01] a sick see dreams and Visions it came
[58:04] forth in 1906 that right am amen but
[58:07] just go tell them that I'm the same
[58:08] yesterday today and forever that was the
[58:10] message that's all they had you see me
[58:13] now but in the evening time at the end
[58:16] of the third day he walked through the
[58:18] walls that's just time now amen amen
[58:22] it's in this hour now great power is
[58:25] going to be loose up on the earth
[58:28] Resurrection see right through the walls
[58:30] he just told him touch me not you can't
[58:32] handle me now but you go tell them that
[58:34] I'm the same yesterday today and forever
[58:37] but at the end of the third day the
[58:39] Eagles can handle the word touch me
[58:42] handle me feel me amen amen at the end
[58:45] of the Third Day St John 20 I believe
[58:48] is whatsoever you bind shall be bound in
[58:50] heaven whatever you loose shall be loose
[58:52] in heaven amen so then we find but the
[58:56] body must live Abraham's a
[58:59] type he's the father of the faith that
[59:02] right amen now notice now God appeared
[59:05] in many forms to Abraham voices light
[59:09] and a man that right well God appeared
[59:13] to you Abraham's seed and Luther and
[59:16] Wesley and all of those in many forms
[59:18] too he appeared as a blade amen he
[59:21] appear as a tassel yes as a husk and now
[59:25] he's appearing as a seed amen that is
[59:28] waiting to be quickened by the Holy
[59:30] Ghost amen that right but now let us go
[59:33] back to the scriptures and we have to
[59:35] type this out see because it's in the
[59:36] word amen amen so it's in the evening
[59:40] time when Sodom was just about just
[59:44] about to be burned two angels had gone
[59:47] down and delivered their message to lot
[59:50] the worldly Church those who believe the
[59:53] message now listen now get this now
[59:56] Abraham the prophet was called out of
[1:00:00] the world with lot he didn't tell lot
[1:00:02] but lot came along with him but God
[1:00:04] didn't tell him to bring lot but lot
[1:00:06] came you get he wasn't predestinated to
[1:00:08] go into bride but he came anyway he saw
[1:00:11] the signs you know sort of healing but
[1:00:13] he come so therefore when another
[1:00:16] Abraham Prophet come lot came also
[1:00:20] follow him in the wilderness amen live
[1:00:22] in the world did all kind of Filth still
[1:00:24] doing it see man and didn't believe it
[1:00:27] and they still doing it see me now but
[1:00:29] they had to come but the elected seat of
[1:00:32] God those women stopped cutting the head
[1:00:34] right away seat of God they listen to
[1:00:37] their ministers right away seat of God
[1:00:40] see me now so therefore to prove it lot
[1:00:45] could not stay with Abraham for his
[1:00:48] congregation argued with Abraham's
[1:00:50] congregation they always do the worldly
[1:00:53] ones will always argue with you if
[1:00:55] you're trying to holy if you're always
[1:00:58] trying to do the will of your father am
[1:01:00] they'll Purge you out that's right they
[1:01:03] have to do it they ordained to do that
[1:01:05] amen so therefore take no thought just
[1:01:08] let them sit there and let them keep
[1:01:10] talking let them keep want to do what
[1:01:11] they want to do just let them go on let
[1:01:13] them curse you God has bid them to do it
[1:01:16] to purge you to make you a little
[1:01:18] sweeter Amen to take it out of your wash
[1:01:20] it in the water to wash you that washing
[1:01:22] machine they do it in the house of God
[1:01:25] where at in in God's house they do it
[1:01:27] unbelievers make Believers sit right in
[1:01:29] God's house not the man outside he don't
[1:01:31] bother you out there he doesn't even
[1:01:33] know you is that right those in God's
[1:01:35] house do it see so therefore and they
[1:01:38] they hate you if you believe that word
[1:01:40] oh they they don't they that's much see
[1:01:43] so then we find then that at that time
[1:01:46] Abraham he he was called out Sarah is a
[1:01:50] type of the Bride she was part of
[1:01:52] Abraham amen amen not a lot see amen
[1:01:55] Sarah was part of Abraham and Sarah had
[1:01:58] her unbelief in the beginning and so did
[1:02:00] we right now amen amen but she was part
[1:02:05] of God therefore God could not take
[1:02:08] Sarah that's right though she
[1:02:09] disbelieved amen that right Abraham he
[1:02:12] believed he's a prophet he believed
[1:02:14] right away I'm going to visit you in the
[1:02:16] time of life you're going to have a son
[1:02:19] Sarah laugh through unbelief me old
[1:02:22] woman have a
[1:02:23] son why did Sarah laugh through
[1:02:26] what happened there here's what happened
[1:02:29] we found out that God appeared he had
[1:02:31] already appeared to Abraham now in
[1:02:33] different forms down through the seven
[1:02:35] Church ages right amen as as Abraham
[1:02:38] came out of the world and so forth but
[1:02:40] at this time in the evening time see
[1:02:42] right at the time Sodom and gomorra was
[1:02:45] to be burned the two angels they went
[1:02:47] down all Roberts and also Billy Graham
[1:02:50] delivered their message and lot still
[1:02:51] can't come out he has no testimony to
[1:02:54] his family see me now when it came time
[1:02:57] to go his family did not believe him for
[1:02:59] he was living in the world he had no
[1:03:01] lost his testimony he went backwards but
[1:03:04] Abraham was pressing on outside of Sodom
[1:03:08] just like you today you have come out
[1:03:10] all things of the world Abraham see
[1:03:13] Abraham if you love it liot see so we
[1:03:17] find then that those two Messengers
[1:03:19] could not get lot out it wasn't until
[1:03:23] God himself came up on the earth and
[1:03:27] spoke to lot come hither see it was the
[1:03:31] time when lot finally got his little
[1:03:32] city zor just one let me break one
[1:03:36] little word God I don't want to go to
[1:03:38] the mountain say just repent repent
[1:03:41] repent the prophet crying is that right
[1:03:43] there was a dream there was two dreams
[1:03:46] one by Junior Jackson Another by because
[1:03:48] of by sinner woman she saw a little man
[1:03:50] repent repent repent repent and next
[1:03:52] thing she know because it was a long
[1:03:54] prayer line and thundered and God spoke
[1:03:56] out this is Jehovah God and Jackson he
[1:03:59] had the same dream so then lot was
[1:04:02] warned come out see but he said escape
[1:04:05] to the mountain lot I don't want to go
[1:04:06] to the mountain I want to go to zor I
[1:04:08] want a little city I got to do one I
[1:04:10] must cut my ha See I well I must I must
[1:04:13] do this this little thing I got to do it
[1:04:15] see I mean now elction that's all I can
[1:04:19] tell you but at that time the sun was up
[1:04:22] on the earth it rose on the earth when
[1:04:25] that happened judgment fell the fire
[1:04:27] fell we are waiting now the prophet has
[1:04:29] warned us all things are ready that
[1:04:32] right Make Ready the fire is ready to
[1:04:35] fall fire of the Holy Ghost first I want
[1:04:38] to be baptized with
[1:04:40] fire Holy Ghost and Fire amen some don't
[1:04:44] amen anyway I do I want to be baptized
[1:04:47] with the Holy Ghost and Fire amen amen
[1:04:51] so then we find then that at that time
[1:04:54] God had appeared in many forms now but
[1:04:57] in the evening time he did something
[1:04:59] strange there was a prophet and there
[1:05:01] was a bride
[1:05:03] Eve God just before Abraham received the
[1:05:08] promise God Elohim Jehovah appeared in
[1:05:12] human skin and revealed himself because
[1:05:15] of his bride Abraham that right am
[1:05:19] that's one thing he appeared in human
[1:05:21] skin see in human flesh so that's a
[1:05:25] that's one sign then in the end time we
[1:05:28] must look for the same sign the Bible
[1:05:30] says it will be St Luke 17:30 that right
[1:05:34] do you believe that amen well it
[1:05:36] happened we then we had to see God
[1:05:40] appearing in human
[1:05:42] skin and speaking the word of God to you
[1:05:44] revealing all the Mysteries to you did
[1:05:47] you miss it did it go over your head God
[1:05:50] the mighty unveiling of the Mighty God
[1:05:52] Amen son of man Prophet God and going to
[1:05:55] be in your skin in a little while
[1:05:58] amen it's going to be God speaking out
[1:06:00] of you s just like him do you believe
[1:06:02] that there it happened with Moses too
[1:06:05] just before he went to the promise all
[1:06:07] right it happened to Abraham just before
[1:06:10] he received the promise God in human
[1:06:13] skin appear to Abraham why human skin so
[1:06:16] that you would know that it could happen
[1:06:18] again amen that's why amen
[1:06:23] amen that's why it was human skin it had
[1:06:26] to be it was word skin that was me a
[1:06:30] mezic skin if you know what I mean word
[1:06:33] skin see by the word you formed by the
[1:06:35] word you're God's word express here in
[1:06:37] the flesh all right for this hour to
[1:06:39] believe his word amen you have to be you
[1:06:42] in his mind you're part of God therefore
[1:06:46] you are justified in his sight you have
[1:06:49] never done nothing right that's what he
[1:06:52] said amen what he said he he never saw
[1:06:55] those of you who believe the word amen
[1:06:58] see so therefore the first sign before
[1:07:03] Abraham reive the promised son Isaac God
[1:07:08] had to appear in human skin now the next
[1:07:12] thing after he received the promised
[1:07:15] word the Angels they were down in Sodom
[1:07:18] lot was down there he couldn't get out
[1:07:20] see right at that time the next thing
[1:07:23] that happened just before Isaac come a
[1:07:26] great power come a quickening power to
[1:07:29] change Abraham's body it was dead did
[1:07:32] you get that amen the body was dead amen
[1:07:37] amen so it had to be quickened changed
[1:07:42] resurrected if you get what I mean I
[1:07:43] hope you get that amen amen Romans 8:11
[1:07:46] if the spirit of God that raised up
[1:07:49] Christ from the dead be in you it shall
[1:07:52] all so Quicken your mortal bodies amen
[1:07:55] so therefore there was Abraham the
[1:07:56] believer his body was dead he couldn't
[1:07:58] bring forth no life but he was the body
[1:08:02] amen he was the mechanics of the word of
[1:08:04] God but needed some life to produce the
[1:08:07] seed that right amen so then a great
[1:08:10] power came and changed Abraham and
[1:08:12] Sarah's body and they went back they
[1:08:15] were resurrected back to the way they
[1:08:18] were young people and Abraham lived on
[1:08:20] and also had because he had more
[1:08:22] children amen way after that that right
[1:08:24] amen amen so we find then that if we
[1:08:27] ought to see to Abraham we look for the
[1:08:29] same promise we are to look for God
[1:08:31] appearing in human skin we ought to look
[1:08:34] for a great power that shall descend
[1:08:37] from heaven with a shout to change our
[1:08:40] minds transform our bodies everything
[1:08:44] Quicken us make us alive make us seeds
[1:08:46] of God that will live on the earth amen
[1:08:50] as a witness out here that he's the same
[1:08:52] yesterday today and forever are you
[1:08:54] following me am amen this is the message
[1:08:57] amen it hasn't changed you know it's the
[1:08:59] same message amen so therefore today the
[1:09:02] body is dead but it will be quickened
[1:09:05] for the word of God says comfort you one
[1:09:07] another with with these words this is
[1:09:09] the promise you are to be quickened amen
[1:09:12] amen thankes are you tired amen praise
[1:09:15] God Amen brother Brown he had three PS
[1:09:19] Amen brother
[1:09:20] Russell he had three pools now now watch
[1:09:23] this now today they say well a brother
[1:09:25] ROM he must be raised from the dead see
[1:09:28] because he must ride the trail one more
[1:09:29] time and also he's Elijah to come see he
[1:09:33] hasn't come yet now see he hasn't
[1:09:35] restored anything back Seven Seals was
[1:09:37] nothing oh my so therefore this is I'm
[1:09:40] the holy spirit is showing to you to see
[1:09:43] how stupid it
[1:09:44] is this anointing here shown it to you
[1:09:47] so other words they're saying he must
[1:09:49] come to ride the trail he must be Elijah
[1:09:52] coming for what happened back there ' 63
[1:09:56] what's all the shout about back there
[1:09:58] what is the books the tapes hanging up
[1:10:01] on the cross for being
[1:10:03] crucified huh amen a messenger with a
[1:10:06] message must first die for it to be in
[1:10:09] effect amen they all seal their
[1:10:13] testimony with
[1:10:14] blood now notice now watch this now
[1:10:18] those Mexicans were Roman
[1:10:20] Catholics am amen amen did you get that
[1:10:24] they were Roman Catholics
[1:10:26] so therefore
[1:10:29] amen that's why we have the Holy Ghost
[1:10:32] amen praise the Lord so therefore they
[1:10:36] were Roman
[1:10:38] Catholics so therefore a Roman Catholic
[1:10:40] drove his car into God's
[1:10:43] Prophet Amen in Texas so we find then
[1:10:49] that that God gave his Prophet three
[1:10:52] pulls three pulls
[1:10:56] he himself if you want it now I'm
[1:10:57] quoting it's on tape sir what is the
[1:11:00] time and many other tapes he told you on
[1:11:03] there cuz you hear it that his message
[1:11:06] his first message his first pull rather
[1:11:09] was healing and th that was the little
[1:11:12] birds that right little veterans amen
[1:11:16] and they were in the shape of a pyramid
[1:11:18] these little veterans that right those
[1:11:20] little vetetans were worn out but
[1:11:22] brother Brown was tired he was on the
[1:11:24] field around the world except he was
[1:11:26] tired but notice now the veterans where
[1:11:28] he saw him from flew Eastward they flew
[1:11:32] back Eastward the next one was doves but
[1:11:36] it was not white doves it was gray doves
[1:11:39] that was the second pull that was his
[1:11:42] prophecy he was preaching de seed The
[1:11:44] Serpent and all these messages and so
[1:11:46] forth that was the word of Goden God
[1:11:50] came down and the Seven Seals and
[1:11:51] Vindicated it to it was thus sayth the
[1:11:53] Lord amen but it was still word back
[1:11:55] then in 51 52 by a prophet for he when
[1:11:58] he was born a prophet he went forth with
[1:12:00] the he was Vindicated years ago he was
[1:12:03] Vindicated before the whole world around
[1:12:05] the world on wi service by a pillar of
[1:12:07] fire amen I don't know what they were
[1:12:09] waiting for he was already Vindicated
[1:12:12] already but only the seed can come amen
[1:12:14] see that was the second pull the doves
[1:12:18] these are these were great doves and
[1:12:20] they flew
[1:12:21] Eastward now we all waiting where the
[1:12:25] the third pull at it's the third pull
[1:12:27] wait for that third pull well he said on
[1:12:30] the tape that the next thing come first
[1:12:33] the little birds then the doves gray
[1:12:36] ones the next thing he saw for his new
[1:12:38] message his third pull was seven angels
[1:12:43] is that right when when did they come
[1:12:46] are they to come or did they come
[1:12:48] before huh did the seven angels come to
[1:12:52] commission him for his third pool Ben
[1:12:54] and three or they too come you figure it
[1:12:58] out I'm saying what's on the tape that's
[1:13:02] all don't quote me now I'm only saying
[1:13:04] what's on that tape sir what is the time
[1:13:07] take it down amen amen so therefore
[1:13:11] seven angels had to come to commission
[1:13:13] him for his third pull amen where only
[1:13:17] life and death how only the word judges
[1:13:21] did the word come down and judge amen
[1:13:23] amen did the word come down himself self
[1:13:25] the pill of fire reveal the seven
[1:13:28] seeds amen was the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:13:31] thrown open for you since 1963 sitting
[1:13:34] right here did it happen amen well he
[1:13:37] threw open the book and you saw your
[1:13:38] name in there and here you come running
[1:13:40] am amen but the lamb opened the book up
[1:13:43] not the lion the Lion's coming see so
[1:13:48] okay first there was a blast shook the
[1:13:51] Earth and brother Brandon was standing
[1:13:53] out in the mountain looking Westward and
[1:13:55] he said that the angel stood this way
[1:13:57] and also counted them but that one over
[1:13:59] on the corner over there was a mighty
[1:14:01] angel that was a swep back wings that
[1:14:04] was the the angel that was God himself
[1:14:08] so therefore only six Angels Came Down
[1:14:11] Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
[1:14:12] and Saturday and six of them come down
[1:14:15] and reveal the seals to him the other
[1:14:18] the seventh angel he didn't come yet
[1:14:21] that's the coming of the Lord amen see
[1:14:24] he he's the one that comes down in
[1:14:25] Revelation 10 and stands up on the earth
[1:14:28] both feet not he he cries on the earth
[1:14:31] not up in heaven on the earth go back to
[1:14:34] the dream Jackson's dream he saw God's
[1:14:37] Prophet at a at because a long prayer
[1:14:40] line but a Dove came in and took him on
[1:14:42] the wings of a snow white dove before
[1:14:44] the
[1:14:46] Thunder h a
[1:14:48] tape so therefore it said it thundered
[1:14:51] what he said now it thundered and a
[1:14:54] voice said this is Je God but when you
[1:14:56] get a dream Jackson's dream back in ' 62
[1:14:59] it all didn't come together yet he but
[1:15:01] he had the whole thing there but it
[1:15:03] didn't come to pass right then did it
[1:15:06] had to wait for it to come to
[1:15:08] pass amen so therefore um the Bland took
[1:15:13] the Earth looking Westward a
[1:15:14] constellation like a pyramid come see
[1:15:18] and the power of God lifted brother Bram
[1:15:20] up into this pyramid and there the seven
[1:15:23] angels of the lord gave him his new
[1:15:25] commission go back Eastward and reveal
[1:15:28] the Seven Seals it went around the whole
[1:15:31] world in Life magazine and so forth the
[1:15:33] signs and that sign went up into the sky
[1:15:37] that right and formed into a cloud oh
[1:15:40] can we have have we happen to have it
[1:15:41] this morning because I don't think that
[1:15:42] some didn't see this
[1:15:44] here now notice now I better read the
[1:15:47] scripture here I want to say everything
[1:15:49] right here make sure it's correct this
[1:15:51] is a strange time right now when you're
[1:15:53] being quoted and everything
[1:15:56] amen praise God Amen so I'm reading from
[1:16:00] Revelation 5 the 9th verse amen amen
[1:16:04] amen praise the Lord after this I beheld
[1:16:07] and low a great M I'm reading from
[1:16:10] seven and uh I'll read from the first
[1:16:13] verse Revelation 5 and I saw in the
[1:16:15] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[1:16:17] a book written within and on the
[1:16:19] backside sealed with Seven Seals I saw a
[1:16:22] strong Angel proclaimed with a loud
[1:16:23] voice who is worthy to to open the book
[1:16:25] and to loose the seals thereof no man in
[1:16:28] Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the
[1:16:30] Earth was able to open the book neither
[1:16:32] to even look at it these Seven Seals and
[1:16:35] I wept much because no man was found
[1:16:37] worthy to open and to read the book
[1:16:39] neither to look there on and one of the
[1:16:42] elders said unto me weep not Behold The
[1:16:44] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[1:16:46] David hath prevailed to open the book
[1:16:49] and loose the Seven Seals but now when
[1:16:51] he looked the lion did not open it see
[1:16:55] had he opened it it had been
[1:16:56] judgment and I beheld and low in the
[1:16:59] midst of the Throne of the four beasts
[1:17:00] in the midst of the elders stood a lamb
[1:17:02] as has been slain having seven horns and
[1:17:04] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:17:06] and God sent forth he came and took the
[1:17:08] book and out the right hand of him that
[1:17:10] set it set upon the throne now we find
[1:17:12] in that down in the 13th verse that John
[1:17:15] is praising and blessing God is that
[1:17:18] right he's making noise and there have
[1:17:21] people today who don't want you to pray
[1:17:22] loud you can't now when John his name in
[1:17:25] that L's Book of Life he made some noise
[1:17:28] amen yet today you can't even hardly
[1:17:30] sing nowhere something's wrong somewhere
[1:17:34] here what he said blessing honor glory
[1:17:36] power be unto him that Seth on the
[1:17:39] throne I say the same thing I got
[1:17:41] something to shout about for the lamb
[1:17:44] opened the book amen my name was in
[1:17:47] there amen thank you Lord there's the
[1:17:51] lamb see the lamb see that sweet little
[1:17:54] lamb lamb there the nose the ear here
[1:17:57] the face mouth that's the lamb right up
[1:18:01] here the seven Angel here's the
[1:18:04] eagle I want to show it to you here so
[1:18:07] therefore natur this is the Christ
[1:18:09] that's the sign of the son of man in
[1:18:11] heaven now notice now in 62 brother Bram
[1:18:14] said that Elijah would probably point to
[1:18:18] the sky screaming Behold the Lamb of God
[1:18:21] that right
[1:18:25] that the sign of the of the sun man up
[1:18:27] in the heavens did he point to the sky
[1:18:30] in the Tabernacle last Easter morning
[1:18:31] that's right when he put it up like this
[1:18:33] here he did point to the sky he did all
[1:18:36] right but we wanted him to be out in
[1:18:38] Tucson somewhere up on a mountain on
[1:18:40] Sunset mountain and all certain ones
[1:18:42] just certain ones be there only their
[1:18:45] own denomination yes Amen brother just
[1:18:49] old see nobody over in Europe nowhere or
[1:18:52] Africa Australia but just a certain few
[1:18:54] people
[1:18:55] that say he's the words they'll be up on
[1:18:57] the mountain then he would tell them he
[1:18:59] scream out Behold the Lamb of God he
[1:19:01] didn't do it that way he did through the
[1:19:03] word see for if the spirit of God be it
[1:19:06] shall also Quicken your moral body in
[1:19:07] the resurrection amen amen God's got one
[1:19:10] here two there all over the world see
[1:19:12] don't ever make a denomination out of
[1:19:13] the word of God and brother hun and I we
[1:19:15] are strong upon that today see me now
[1:19:18] why for the prophet the Lord has passed
[1:19:19] on and many now are screaming oh brother
[1:19:23] brand the cloud took him West see it's
[1:19:25] gone therefore they screaming out what
[1:19:27] shall we do see let us all let us do
[1:19:29] nothing let the Eagles go forth Amen Let
[1:19:32] the spirit of God anoint the Eagles and
[1:19:34] send them out that's right then the
[1:19:36] eagle can be in Africa Australia Canada
[1:19:39] but they'll see eye to eye amen for
[1:19:41] Christ himself the word will come down
[1:19:43] himself and search out his sheep through
[1:19:46] a fful Ministry he'll do it great power
[1:19:50] amen you tired no amen prise God we're
[1:19:53] trying to get this message out
[1:19:55] this Mage Revelation 10:7 tells us in
[1:19:58] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:20:01] angel when he shall only begin start to
[1:20:05] sound when he just moves on begin to
[1:20:09] open the seals up the mystery should be
[1:20:11] finished amen is that right amen I mean
[1:20:14] it really should be finished after all
[1:20:16] it was the church was lost we had no
[1:20:20] vision of the end time the Baptist said
[1:20:22] that because they were right Pentecostal
[1:20:24] everybody was right all right what we
[1:20:26] needed was a vision of the end time
[1:20:28] Daniel said shut up the words all right
[1:20:30] SE up the book until the time of the end
[1:20:33] that right in the end time when
[1:20:35] knowledge shall be increased they shall
[1:20:37] fly to and fro run to and fro at that
[1:20:40] precise time I will open the seals but
[1:20:43] the lamb will do it the lamb will open
[1:20:46] up the seals reveal to you that his
[1:20:49] Prophet is a judgment sign see and the
[1:20:53] next voice Shout you'll hear will be the
[1:20:56] Messiah speaking this is Jehovah God the
[1:20:59] next voice you'll hear for a prophet
[1:21:02] sign laid down there in
[1:21:05] Texas and the evening star rolled a
[1:21:07] trail across the skies that right amen
[1:21:10] we still don't understand it so then his
[1:21:12] message it says here was to finish all
[1:21:15] the Mysteries all these things that they
[1:21:18] had proved at down through the ages for
[1:21:20] when the first seal broke Paul called he
[1:21:22] was a prophet he knew that it was
[1:21:24] something he didn't know that it was a
[1:21:26] Roman Pope though see cuz he hadn't
[1:21:28] started yet but Paul knew it was
[1:21:30] something so he caught it and said the
[1:21:31] mystery of an niqu do already work amen
[1:21:34] he prophesied it was already working in
[1:21:36] a spirit form see me now so how greater
[1:21:40] is William brandom when he told you who
[1:21:42] it
[1:21:43] was
[1:21:45] amen thousands of visions and and spoken
[1:21:48] words and everything he's already done
[1:21:49] it already I don't know what you're
[1:21:51] waiting
[1:21:52] for I'm waiting on the coming of Lord
[1:21:55] for he's turned my heart back for the
[1:21:57] promise that he'll come and he's even on
[1:22:00] the way amen I know it so his message
[1:22:04] was to finish a Mysteries and introduce
[1:22:06] the
[1:22:07] Messiah with the restored word is the
[1:22:10] word restored back amen he can't come
[1:22:13] unless the word is
[1:22:14] there that's what the Pentecostals
[1:22:17] believe they believe that they can go on
[1:22:18] and sin and they'll be C and meet them
[1:22:19] in the a amen it's not going to happen
[1:22:22] that way so the word had to be restored
[1:22:25] first did he restore the word that's up
[1:22:27] to you see I can't tell you that
[1:22:30] restored in my heart amen so how did he
[1:22:33] do it the lamb did it he opened the
[1:22:35] Seven Seals is that right the lamb
[1:22:37] restored the word back to the bride now
[1:22:40] the bride has a prophetic Vision she
[1:22:44] knows judgment coming and sa fire three
[1:22:47] weeks ago brother Perry Green in his
[1:22:50] church he asked brother Bram to come and
[1:22:51] speak he said no I won't say nothing he
[1:22:53] says that but I want to say this
[1:22:54] that in the churches today the Lord's
[1:22:57] Supper is only a tradition people come P
[1:23:00] full of sin amen and take the Lord's
[1:23:01] Supper he said but that won't be long he
[1:23:04] said there's going to be the Holy Spirit
[1:23:05] among you it will call out the anas and
[1:23:08] the Safar we and brandom said that out
[1:23:11] in Tucson Tabernacle so he said that not
[1:23:14] me he said that cuz the Bible says that
[1:23:18] that's why he said that see he said
[1:23:19] there will be a great power among you
[1:23:22] and it'll be Jesus Christ himself I
[1:23:24] believe God himself am amen that's what
[1:23:27] you're looking for you're looking for
[1:23:29] God to come down into this assembly and
[1:23:30] speak out amen speak out in here others
[1:23:33] are looking for something else now they
[1:23:34] don't want no kind of order all God get
[1:23:37] told us to do was to go back there to
[1:23:40] New York and just preach the word take
[1:23:43] this church order put those Spirits in
[1:23:46] subjection to order cuz God's house you
[1:23:50] got to have order in it so that's why we
[1:23:52] have church order here because the seeds
[1:23:54] of God they love it they love to be in
[1:23:56] order they love to listen to all the
[1:23:58] deacons and everybody they love that
[1:24:00] that's the seed of God but the
[1:24:01] rebellious Spirits from time to time
[1:24:04] rebuke them and let them know that
[1:24:06] you're in Authority there amen before
[1:24:07] all sometimes if they sin That Others
[1:24:10] May fear it's the word but now you
[1:24:14] preach like that who you think you are
[1:24:16] anyway did Brother Brown say that over
[1:24:18] there Bible says he's the word amen they
[1:24:22] won't understand you but whether
[1:24:24] understand or not preach the word in
[1:24:25] season out of season be constant all the
[1:24:28] time they won't understand they look for
[1:24:30] him to be resurrected somewhere see me
[1:24:32] now but they won't know my people the
[1:24:35] daughters of Jerusalem was wailing
[1:24:37] against the wall that right he was right
[1:24:39] there are they wailing right now against
[1:24:43] the walls right now doors of Jerusalem
[1:24:45] they're wailing up against the Wailing
[1:24:47] Wall
[1:24:48] there same thing all over again the
[1:24:50] daughters are wailing you see they just
[1:24:52] can't take those ministers
[1:24:54] something I don't know about it but
[1:24:55] anyway so therefore the the Seven Seals
[1:24:58] restored the word to the bride a
[1:25:01] prophetic Vision all the Mysteries are
[1:25:04] finished already he said so that when he
[1:25:07] begin to sound he finished Mysteries
[1:25:10] except marriage and divorce right
[1:25:11] away right and everything which came
[1:25:14] forth from there came from the Seven
[1:25:16] Seals from the lamb see and that's why
[1:25:20] John said blessed and shoutings and
[1:25:22] honor and Glory everything the seeds of
[1:25:24] God love to sing they love to shout they
[1:25:26] love to everything they praise God Amen
[1:25:29] let every that have a voice praise ye
[1:25:32] the Lord what are you looking down for
[1:25:34] look up for your Redemption draw now
[1:25:37] amen so now we find that John he had to
[1:25:42] preach marriage and divorce he had to
[1:25:44] decrease God's Prophet had to decrease
[1:25:48] that Christ might be
[1:25:50] increased Rome because killed the
[1:25:53] prophet same thing today is Roman is a
[1:25:56] Roman Catholic so we understand we now
[1:25:58] have the restored prophetic word message
[1:26:01] where at in our hearts for Elijah
[1:26:05] restored It to Your Heart Right but it's
[1:26:08] laying there for Christ restored the
[1:26:11] word to Peter James and John in them
[1:26:13] didn't he but it laid there until the
[1:26:16] resurrection came amen and the
[1:26:19] resurrection is the rapture is that
[1:26:21] right so we're looking for the Rapture
[1:26:22] in the resurrection you must must be
[1:26:24] resurrected first for we're dead the
[1:26:26] body this body is dead need to be
[1:26:28] changed then when it's quickened it'll
[1:26:30] be quickened to every word every word
[1:26:32] this mind will be transformed see me now
[1:26:36] amen that's that power that you're
[1:26:38] looking for right now if I can only pray
[1:26:40] 15 minutes if I can only go on if I can
[1:26:43] only stop being so mean see Power is
[1:26:46] coming but on the seat of God for
[1:26:49] there'll be anointed ones at the end
[1:26:50] time who still do the same
[1:26:52] thing baptize in the Holy Ghost God's
[1:26:55] Prophet said so that woman said I can
[1:26:57] walk up those three steps he said he
[1:26:59] said no you can't she walked up there
[1:27:01] with high he shoes on click click click
[1:27:04] click and she began to walk down a
[1:27:05] narrow way it got narrow and narrow and
[1:27:07] narrow and she fell off you can't walk
[1:27:09] it you walk in God's way that's right
[1:27:12] there's a way there's a highway and
[1:27:14] there's a way and the way is called
[1:27:17] Holiness those very high heel shoes like
[1:27:19] that there because because tips them
[1:27:21] over and they go along tinkling as they
[1:27:23] go Daughters of Zion see me now and
[1:27:26] God's Prophet preached that and they mad
[1:27:28] and because it mad against them but
[1:27:30] however the that message that he
[1:27:32] preached is living in some of the
[1:27:33] daughters of Zion's Hearts today we have
[1:27:36] some right here living in their hearts
[1:27:38] amen you believe at them praise God Amen
[1:27:42] praise the Lord so we have the restored
[1:27:45] prophetic word message where at in the
[1:27:49] book in our hearts amen it needs to be
[1:27:52] Quicken though it's going be quick so
[1:27:56] therefore I believe that my heart has
[1:27:58] been turned back amen I don't know about
[1:28:01] your heart now see but my
[1:28:03] hands see me now that's what I believe
[1:28:06] see be it unto you according to your
[1:28:09] faith amen don't quote me see I said
[1:28:12] what I believe that's me see now the
[1:28:16] worn out
[1:28:18] messenger cried to go home on wings of a
[1:28:21] snow white dove now that happened we
[1:28:24] heard it here on Telephone he read uh
[1:28:26] Psalm 55 if you if you read it at all in
[1:28:29] the spirit you see what he was trying to
[1:28:31] say there he's
[1:28:32] tired 40 years he's been sick people
[1:28:35] were prayed for right in front of his
[1:28:37] face and God never healed him all right
[1:28:40] he had a little six he had SE like a
[1:28:42] little furry animal in a vision in his
[1:28:44] stomach and he was sick brother Brandon
[1:28:47] was sick suffered for 40 years 40 years
[1:28:50] is a judgment too so therefore
[1:28:54] he had a message though before he could
[1:28:56] go home now he on that tape he told a
[1:28:59] story about a little Dove and a dove is
[1:29:02] a sign right is also a sign of Peace you
[1:29:05] see it's useful a Sign by Noah and also
[1:29:08] it was useful for Jesus Christ and so
[1:29:11] therefore it symbols peace and now um
[1:29:16] God's Prophet had told his story about I
[1:29:17] think it was World War I and how this
[1:29:19] was a carrier pigeon see but he had a
[1:29:22] message because to deliver and the enemy
[1:29:25] saw him and they began to shoot at him
[1:29:27] and also his wing was clipped you see a
[1:29:30] part of his back shut out and so forth
[1:29:32] but he kept on going he was bruised and
[1:29:35] vanished but he was going home see to
[1:29:39] and he got the message home and fell on
[1:29:42] the
[1:29:43] floor now the the the little birds was
[1:29:48] going Eastward after the first pull that
[1:29:51] right then the dob the next pull these
[1:29:54] uh doves they flew Eastward after the
[1:29:57] seven angels God's Prophet was coming
[1:30:00] Eastward to Jeff that right to he was
[1:30:04] bruised he was bannered he was tied he
[1:30:07] was worn out and little didn't he know
[1:30:09] as he passed through Texas but he had to
[1:30:11] go that way you see for there was
[1:30:14] blackout in Texas there and there he was
[1:30:17] killed God's servant that right so we
[1:30:20] find then that why is that we don't know
[1:30:23] we try not understand today what does it
[1:30:25] all mean see but it means something but
[1:30:27] we know this that he had a message since
[1:30:31] 1933 amen that right and he preached the
[1:30:34] word for God gave him many visions that
[1:30:36] he would pluck fruit from both sides
[1:30:38] jesus' name and also trinitarians he
[1:30:41] would take the fruit from both sides a
[1:30:43] plum tree and also apple tree and he got
[1:30:45] the fruit that right he got them amen
[1:30:48] his message got the fruit and then his
[1:30:51] uh I should say his crowning message the
[1:30:54] third pool when he was to reveal the
[1:30:56] Bible it was revealed well then he got
[1:31:00] that message out it went out this is the
[1:31:03] called out Age first you had the mar age
[1:31:08] then you had the reformer age then the
[1:31:11] lamb comes opens the book up and calls
[1:31:13] out his people see in now therefore the
[1:31:16] prophet got his message out and then he
[1:31:19] was going back he said the next major
[1:31:22] mess on my heart is a tracing the
[1:31:24] serpent seed is that right but now he
[1:31:28] got the message out but now there's some
[1:31:31] people now you got to be very spiritual
[1:31:33] here some people s now he said himself
[1:31:37] that he had three PS and I just named
[1:31:40] them little birds gray doves and seven
[1:31:44] angels that was his signs to him for
[1:31:46] history PS but there's another sign of
[1:31:50] Eagle then if that was to him also that
[1:31:52] would be a fourth pull wouldn't it
[1:31:54] well you decide how many PS was he
[1:31:56] supposed to
[1:31:58] have is that right he was supposed to
[1:32:01] have three pulls they all had three
[1:32:04] pulls so now if he was to have a fourth
[1:32:07] pull that would be the eagle so here was
[1:32:10] he waiting for 33 years preaching the
[1:32:12] word in season out of season reveal the
[1:32:14] whole Bible see me now then at the end
[1:32:18] there he was out in the desert and now
[1:32:20] he began to say that he wants to preach
[1:32:22] to see to the serpent
[1:32:24] to tell how it started in the beginning
[1:32:26] that right around about that time seed
[1:32:29] of the serpent was preached somewhere in
[1:32:30] the country amen see me now so the
[1:32:33] prophet it was told to him you know oh
[1:32:36] yeah it was told to him see so he just
[1:32:39] smiled he was happy for he knew that an
[1:32:42] eagle caught it in the
[1:32:44] spirit so now he was happy see it's time
[1:32:48] to go home now so he's sick and he's
[1:32:52] tired through 40 years his stom and so
[1:32:54] forth and and all you know out there in
[1:32:57] Arizona there finally up there it's on
[1:32:59] the tape um it's on the tape now wings
[1:33:01] of a snow white dove see he went now his
[1:33:04] mother she said now all of her dreams
[1:33:08] have come to pass but something that we
[1:33:10] all missed I
[1:33:12] believe because I know I did anyway so
[1:33:15] uh his mother she had a dream I think I
[1:33:18] had I took down part of it here you hold
[1:33:21] just hold on a minute oh yes his mother
[1:33:24] had a dream and uh it's on the tap and
[1:33:27] he said that she saw six doves in the
[1:33:29] shape of an S because come down right
[1:33:33] and also went back now she saw him sick
[1:33:37] laying there about to
[1:33:40] die did you get that there amen it was
[1:33:43] on the
[1:33:43] tape she saw her son brother brandham
[1:33:48] sick and
[1:33:49] dying dying see he wasn't shot now but
[1:33:53] he was dying
[1:33:54] see but then he quickly said because my
[1:33:57] stomach you
[1:33:58] know so uh it's a prophet see speak some
[1:34:01] Parables but that was said see so then
[1:34:05] um also saw a little 6inch furry animal
[1:34:08] that that right slid down the stroke see
[1:34:11] now he said that that was man's
[1:34:13] suffering number six is man's number see
[1:34:16] but then he was promised one day that
[1:34:19] I'll show you a sign it'll be the
[1:34:21] seventh White Dove where it be at the
[1:34:25] Lord God he'll provide his own sacrifice
[1:34:28] right he provided a ram to Abraham way
[1:34:30] out in the middle of out in the
[1:34:32] wilderness on a mountain that right he
[1:34:35] provided a ram that's a signed to
[1:34:38] Abraham way out there in the wilderness
[1:34:40] so God's Prophet said himself that he
[1:34:43] was up in the mountain and there I think
[1:34:45] it was in October right through there he
[1:34:48] saw a white dove that white dove was
[1:34:52] Snow White it was wasn't gray see man it
[1:34:55] was Snow White then he knew what that
[1:34:58] meant see all right that meant that he
[1:35:02] would finally be healed now he had his
[1:35:04] three PS now I'm not saying he's
[1:35:07] supposed to have a fourth P I didn't say
[1:35:08] that but he had his three PS he was
[1:35:11] tired he was worn out for 40 years he
[1:35:14] preached the word there see but he was
[1:35:17] sick and that's the year of the Judgment
[1:35:19] see that's number of the judgment and
[1:35:20] there he was waiting see when he that
[1:35:24] sign uh because he shouted and then he
[1:35:27] come back again and he was praying there
[1:35:30] the holy spirit says look up over your
[1:35:31] heart and over his heart there was CV in
[1:35:35] the Rock written in the Rock White Eagle
[1:35:38] see and then uh that eagle flew he saw
[1:35:41] an eagle fly in a vision of something so
[1:35:43] therefore Dove Holy Spirit first then
[1:35:47] Eagle now this another sign now
[1:35:49] different message I'm going read what he
[1:35:52] said he said he knew knew he would see
[1:35:54] the seventh Dove and also at the same
[1:35:57] time he saw that little furry animal
[1:35:59] hanging on a branch all right in October
[1:36:02] he saw all three together that right so
[1:36:05] that little furry animal hanging on a
[1:36:07] branch right okay he saw wrot written a
[1:36:11] stone White Eagle just exactly the
[1:36:14] vision said the next message would come
[1:36:16] forth by now I don't know what that
[1:36:18] means but that's on the tape see I wrote
[1:36:21] it down exactly as I heard it he saw the
[1:36:23] a white eagle flying just
[1:36:26] exactly that what the vision said the
[1:36:29] next me the next message would come
[1:36:31] forth by rode in the Rock but the dove
[1:36:35] was first then was the eagle then he
[1:36:38] said in the prayer I imagine it is
[1:36:40] finished see I'm going to be well signed
[1:36:45] from above for the dove was a sign to no
[1:36:48] when he come back I think with the olive
[1:36:51] uh Branch there that it was peace after
[1:36:53] the Waters of judgment that right Noah
[1:36:56] and his family finally they had peace
[1:36:58] and safety on dry land but the dev was
[1:37:00] assigned to them of peace is that right
[1:37:03] and then Christ he come down and the
[1:37:06] dove appeared a sign and he gave us his
[1:37:09] peace that right now brother brandom
[1:37:12] that seventh Dove was a signed to him of
[1:37:15] Peace for he read out of Psalms 55 on
[1:37:19] the wings of a snow white dove that
[1:37:21] right he wanted to take a flight from
[1:37:23] here on the wings of a snow white dove
[1:37:26] and nobody know what he's talking about
[1:37:28] you see you're not supposed to so
[1:37:30] therefore brother Jackson had a dream
[1:37:33] and brother Brandon walked down there
[1:37:36] just exactly like something was going to
[1:37:37] happen it did but we didn't know what
[1:37:39] happened you see me now and we expected
[1:37:42] cuz he said Jackson saw brother Jack
[1:37:44] Mo's church he saw the church and
[1:37:46] everything and brother brandom had a
[1:37:48] long prayer line that right did he have
[1:37:50] it and he wanted all the old times who
[1:37:53] started out in the very beginning and
[1:37:54] they were there Jack more all them were
[1:37:56] there that right but in Jackson's dream
[1:37:58] at the end of that prayer line a dove
[1:38:00] flew through the window see and took him
[1:38:03] home you see because took him but the
[1:38:05] dove come in the window but then also
[1:38:08] right after this long prayer line it
[1:38:10] thundered and a voice said this is
[1:38:13] Jehovah God that was in the dream so the
[1:38:15] people was expecting for it to thunder
[1:38:17] in treport and a voice speak out this is
[1:38:20] Jehovah God but it didn't happen you see
[1:38:22] the me now amen it didn't happen that
[1:38:24] way another woman saw the same dream she
[1:38:27] saw a little man running in the streets
[1:38:28] repent repent repent and then it
[1:38:31] thundered and a voice this is Jehovah
[1:38:34] God same dream almost so therefore what
[1:38:37] does that mean I'm not going to tell you
[1:38:39] CU I don't know but if if it has been
[1:38:42] preached then you understand see me now
[1:38:44] so therefore he also said it is finished
[1:38:49] I'm going to be well it's a sign from
[1:38:51] above that I have peace at last
[1:38:54] the seventh Dove was assigned to me to
[1:38:56] him but then at the same time he was
[1:39:00] batted and bruised but he saw an eagle
[1:39:03] amen he knew it was the eagle age he
[1:39:05] know the Eagles can fly high in the
[1:39:07] spirit they'll take the message they may
[1:39:11] Kill the Messenger and seal his message
[1:39:14] with blood but the message will live on
[1:39:17] for the Eagles can pick up that message
[1:39:20] and preach that word in season out of
[1:39:23] season the same way rebuke with all
[1:39:26] longsuffering call out the sin and
[1:39:28] whatever the God tells the eagle to do
[1:39:30] he'll do that he'll do what the what God
[1:39:32] tells him to do the
[1:39:33] Eagles Why for he knew that the Eagles
[1:39:37] would have to start in
[1:39:39] Genesis amen see the serpent tell it how
[1:39:43] it all started he know the eag would
[1:39:46] pick it up amen he would just smile if
[1:39:48] you Happ to hear about it amen so uh
[1:39:52] what can I tell you you have to be
[1:39:54] spiritual so we find then that he said
[1:39:58] also that Noah sign of a dove it was a
[1:40:01] messenger dou is a messenger comeing to
[1:40:03] tell them everything is all
[1:40:05] right and also he says uh he now he's
[1:40:09] praying he says you gave no a sign you
[1:40:11] gave the world a sign he gave us a sign
[1:40:14] also the world see that it was peace
[1:40:16] with him see and you gave me a sign and
[1:40:19] the next day this is in praying seeing
[1:40:21] that eagle flying oh God there is a
[1:40:26] message coming forth now I pray that you
[1:40:28] will let the Holy Spirit of lead lead me
[1:40:32] to a faith send down a message could
[1:40:35] send a message if you could send a
[1:40:36] message because to knowing John send it
[1:40:38] to me can send it to others on the wings
[1:40:41] of a dove the faith the wounded dove has
[1:40:44] brought the message back that's what he
[1:40:46] said the wounded dove has brought the
[1:40:49] message back and it flapped out but the
[1:40:52] message got home am did it get home in
[1:40:54] your
[1:40:55] heart then if it's in your heart if God
[1:40:58] has restored it to your heart it will
[1:41:03] live when the quicking power strikes it
[1:41:06] it's the word of God
[1:41:08] Amen so we find then that the wounded
[1:41:11] dove has brought the message back and he
[1:41:14] cried out oh God is finished just give
[1:41:16] us Faith to believe it and then he said
[1:41:19] a few other words and so forth up and so
[1:41:21] forth and around the country and like
[1:41:22] that you know
[1:41:24] so therefore Noah search for lamb Amen
[1:41:28] brother Frank caught that there so the
[1:41:30] dove Spirit of the Holy Ghost to give
[1:41:32] Faith he said Lord let the Holy Spirit
[1:41:35] Dove flutter into our hearts to give us
[1:41:38] that Faith see me now that He restored
[1:41:41] the word the mechanics that came back
[1:41:43] amen you have the faith in that word
[1:41:45] don't you you're waiting for the
[1:41:47] quickening power for he has restored you
[1:41:50] back to that word but Christ must take
[1:41:52] you on now yes amen only Christ can take
[1:41:54] your arms don't dare follow a man follow
[1:41:59] the message amen then you won't have any
[1:42:02] sorrow today you won't run around the
[1:42:03] country nowhere if you follow the man if
[1:42:05] you follow a man you'll be down right
[1:42:06] now but if that word of God is abiding
[1:42:08] in your heart abide in me and I'll abide
[1:42:12] in you and in that day if you keep on
[1:42:15] abiding I'll Keep On Blessing I'll keep
[1:42:17] on sanctifying You Keep On Believing and
[1:42:20] I'll fill your hearts in that day I'll
[1:42:22] Quicken your m B if you do but if you
[1:42:25] just believe in a man's flesh for in
[1:42:28] that same dream of his mother it said
[1:42:30] that at the time he was dying he was
[1:42:33] building a house on the
[1:42:36] hill he never went into his home amen
[1:42:40] amen that was in her dream years ago
[1:42:42] when he was laying there dying there was
[1:42:45] a house being built on a hill you see so
[1:42:48] he never got there so we find out that
[1:42:51] that these so he also he said said this
[1:42:53] let this be a memorial prayer line for
[1:42:56] the sick in honor of the old days it can
[1:42:59] be done
[1:43:00] again that was on the tape there so then
[1:43:03] we find then that the Seven Seals
[1:43:06] restored the prophetic Vision to the
[1:43:09] bride the bride has it now in her heart
[1:43:12] and that message will live by the Great
[1:43:16] Eagle anointing for there's a power
[1:43:18] coming up on the earth that's going to
[1:43:20] change you amen amen it's going to
[1:43:23] change you see so therefore now whether
[1:43:26] our hearts have been turned back to the
[1:43:28] message I don't know see because it's
[1:43:32] supposed to be unbelievers make
[1:43:34] Believers and Believers in same
[1:43:35] congregation but one day there's a great
[1:43:37] power coming in to we them out but see
[1:43:40] he'll do that not me don't root up the
[1:43:42] tears let him sit there preach feed the
[1:43:45] flock amen that's tonight praise God so
[1:43:49] therefore the one out
[1:43:51] messenger amen am the one out messenger
[1:43:54] cried out to go home on wings of a snow
[1:43:58] white dove did he do that there that's
[1:43:59] what he wanted he began to sing it on
[1:44:01] the wings of a snow white dve that right
[1:44:04] he sang it and sang it and sang it and
[1:44:06] sang it and we didn't know what in the
[1:44:07] world he's talking about see so he was
[1:44:10] baded bruised and went on so now we find
[1:44:13] then
[1:44:14] that uh God's prophet he cried out for
[1:44:17] deliverance spoke about that he knew
[1:44:20] that he was to see a sign of a dove the
[1:44:22] seventh dove it's a sign of Peace his
[1:44:24] mother's dream I spoke about that so
[1:44:27] then we find also he said that he had
[1:44:29] seven eights seven changes seven eights
[1:44:32] 56 years old he had to have a change is
[1:44:35] right that's what he said amen and also
[1:44:36] how strange the dove sign the know I
[1:44:39] spoke about that
[1:44:41] um brother Brandon was going
[1:44:44] home the Roman Catholic I went through
[1:44:47] this here so want I want to catch
[1:44:49] something um s White Dove R in stone
[1:44:53] went through I've been preaching not C
[1:44:55] off the notes Here If I skip over it so
[1:44:58] then we find then
[1:45:00] that he saw the eagle flying and he knew
[1:45:04] that if he could get that message home
[1:45:07] that God would pick up that message in
[1:45:09] some hearts Quicken it make it live for
[1:45:12] the age see mean now there's certain
[1:45:15] predestinated seeds of God that received
[1:45:18] a message but can't do anything see they
[1:45:22] must wait on I say wait on the Lord
[1:45:24] Isaiah 40 then they'll Mount up with
[1:45:27] wings as Eagles is that right they'll
[1:45:29] run they won't be worried in you'll walk
[1:45:31] and you won't faint in God's time that
[1:45:34] is coming so we find out then that
[1:45:37] something I wanted to say here oh yes
[1:45:40] that notice this here the past four
[1:45:43] years Rome has had a dialogue with the
[1:45:47] whole
[1:45:48] world watch this now but its Works was
[1:45:52] finished in December of
[1:45:55] 1965 is that right God's prophet he came
[1:45:59] with a dialogue to the bride his work
[1:46:03] was finished in December
[1:46:05] 1965 right the pope said it last week
[1:46:10] the seed sown by by the counil must now
[1:46:15] be cultivated what he said and we know
[1:46:18] that there's a demonic power that's
[1:46:20] going to come upon on the earth and
[1:46:21] cultivate that seed
[1:46:23] swn by Rome among the image to the Beast
[1:46:26] and all the churches that right they
[1:46:28] going to have a quickening power also
[1:46:29] they going to draw them together against
[1:46:31] the bride but we also know that there's
[1:46:35] going to be a great power among God's
[1:46:37] seeds and God's seeds will be cultivated
[1:46:40] by the spirit of almighty God so we find
[1:46:44] then that just before brother brandham
[1:46:47] signed off so to speak that he preached
[1:46:50] a Rapture out in and Rialto now the
[1:46:54] bride want to know why did he go there
[1:46:56] and preach it why did he come to Jeffer
[1:46:58] somewhere he has to follow his father
[1:47:01] amen but let us turn over to uh second
[1:47:04] Peter 3 this is what he preached out
[1:47:14] there be about five minutes are you
[1:47:17] understanding the message Amen brother
[1:47:21] Brandon preached on the rapture before
[1:47:23] his death among scoffers second Peter
[1:47:26] 3:3 knowing this verse that there shall
[1:47:29] come in the last day scoffers walking
[1:47:31] after their own lust and saying where is
[1:47:33] the promise of his coming for since the
[1:47:36] fathers fell asleep all things contined
[1:47:38] as they were from the beginning of the
[1:47:39] creation Now the promise of his coming
[1:47:41] was tied up in Malachi 4 that right so
[1:47:45] he went after he preached the wings of a
[1:47:47] snow white dove out to Yuma and
[1:47:50] announced it at a banquet and I'm told
[1:47:53] that they were smoking there they were
[1:47:55] saying hurry up come on get through
[1:47:56] there that's right they were scoffing
[1:47:59] but the scripture say he had to preach
[1:48:01] it there he had to preach the promise of
[1:48:03] the coming among the scoffers and he
[1:48:06] also held up the tape see but and he he
[1:48:09] used Psalms 275 if you want to take it
[1:48:12] down and second Peter 3 3 and 4 that's
[1:48:16] what he used and that's what he preached
[1:48:18] on two messages so we heard
[1:48:22] that uh we all heard that the Rapture
[1:48:25] would take place in the Fourth Watch
[1:48:28] between 6:00 and 9:00 a.m. in the
[1:48:30] morning that right somebody want to know
[1:48:32] what because that's in Tucson well then
[1:48:34] that's what he said I don't know
[1:48:35] anything about it I haven't heard the
[1:48:36] tape but the prophet said it was between
[1:48:39] 6:00 and 9 that's good enough for me
[1:48:41] amen I'm not worrying about whether what
[1:48:43] time is over in Africa or what time over
[1:48:44] in Canada between 600 and 9 s it me now
[1:48:48] for I know that this that the Bible says
[1:48:51] when the seventh angel strk the Earth
[1:48:54] time as you know it shall be no longer
[1:48:57] is that right well I don't worry about
[1:48:59] the about what time is over in
[1:49:01] California and what time will it be over
[1:49:03] there for time shall be no longer time
[1:49:06] as you know it days and hours this is
[1:49:09] eternity so never try to get ahead
[1:49:11] nowhere don't try to figure it out time
[1:49:13] shall be no longer that's what the
[1:49:14] scripture says is that right amen so
[1:49:17] therefore we find then
[1:49:19] that um he had to preach it this way and
[1:49:22] he signed off and a brother Dill told me
[1:49:24] the other day that all he he was saying
[1:49:27] was the judgment is coming the fire is
[1:49:29] falling and the fire fell in Indiana and
[1:49:31] also California Fireballs fell that
[1:49:33] right signs that the Holy Ghost
[1:49:36] Fireballs are going to fall upon you
[1:49:37] soon amen exactly right see so therefore
[1:49:41] uh he preached it there and now uh
[1:49:44] brother out west say the name he
[1:49:47] happened to because go to Phoenix and
[1:49:49] there he met a brother who was at the
[1:49:51] meetings and he gave the bombs amen so
[1:49:54] this what he said he said three things
[1:49:56] to happen before the Lord appears see
[1:50:01] now go back to go back to Abraham now
[1:50:03] certain things had to happen before
[1:50:06] Isaac appeared God and human flesh that
[1:50:08] right but a power had to come and change
[1:50:11] their dead bodies back is that right
[1:50:13] okay and now let's turn to first
[1:50:16] Thessalonians 4:14 so we can see a des
[1:50:19] scripture I'm tired amen
[1:50:23] praise
[1:50:26] God the 16th
[1:50:29] verse for the Lord himself shall descend
[1:50:32] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[1:50:34] of the Archangel and with the Trump of
[1:50:35] God and the dead in Crash shall rise
[1:50:38] first now I'm going to say what brother
[1:50:40] brandom said is on the tape and this was
[1:50:42] this brother's notes and this was given
[1:50:44] to me so I'm going to give it to you and
[1:50:46] I didn't say this now brother Bram said
[1:50:48] it amen he said he said now there's
[1:50:51] three things that must happen here here
[1:50:53] it's the shout the voice of the
[1:50:54] Archangel and Trump of God he said now
[1:50:56] the shout the shout the first thing that
[1:50:59] happened is the shout now here what the
[1:51:02] shout is that's the message through
[1:51:04] Malachi 4 what are you shouting about
[1:51:08] you anything to shout
[1:51:10] about great is a Holy One of Israel in
[1:51:13] your midst is that something to shout
[1:51:15] about amen the word of God Amen is that
[1:51:18] simple amen how simple thank you Lord
[1:51:20] the he the Lord shall Sin from heaven
[1:51:24] with a shout on the earth other words
[1:51:27] there's his Prophet seal the message
[1:51:28] with his blood the message is out and
[1:51:31] Book and Tape and everything there's
[1:51:32] laying out there scoff has come he ain't
[1:51:34] no Prophet if you're a prophet raise up
[1:51:36] from the dead say Amen now be careful
[1:51:38] when you praying to ask him because to
[1:51:40] be raised up make sure it's God's will
[1:51:43] now so therefore the SC raised up from
[1:51:45] there come on now see and therefore I
[1:51:47] thought you had a message see you're
[1:51:49] dead now you see the me now then the
[1:51:52] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:51:54] and make that shout that message live am
[1:51:58] how in your hearts amen it's very
[1:52:02] simple Noah built the ark and there the
[1:52:06] ark sat and they scoff at is that right
[1:52:08] am and they laugh and they laugh and
[1:52:10] they laugh but the water came amen type
[1:52:13] of the spirit that right amen amen and
[1:52:15] it lifted up that message that Ark up it
[1:52:18] wind amen all others died this message
[1:52:22] if this is the message and to me it is
[1:52:25] the message for is living in my heart
[1:52:28] and it's going to be quickened see to me
[1:52:30] now therefore all others is to me is
[1:52:34] wrong there is no other message sunship
[1:52:36] body whatever it is is to me is wrong
[1:52:39] amen this is the message and though
[1:52:41] God's prophets remains as laying down in
[1:52:44] Jeff I have the message for he spoke
[1:52:48] that to continue preaching in the eagle
[1:52:51] age then he do that but right now he
[1:52:54] told me to feed the flock am that's all
[1:52:56] I can do is a stand up here let the Holy
[1:52:58] Spirit feed the flock if I'm called in
[1:53:01] this great anointed age this age where a
[1:53:05] baded bruised seventh angel had his
[1:53:08] wings clipped going home his elbow See
[1:53:12] Me Now crushed but I'm told that every
[1:53:14] bone his body came back to place before
[1:53:17] he died that's right every bone came
[1:53:20] back to place was mended back and then
[1:53:22] he died so therefore he brought the
[1:53:26] message now you say well why say the
[1:53:30] scribes that Elias must first come well
[1:53:33] go back to when uh God hidden in
[1:53:36] Simplicity you all there he said that
[1:53:40] when the ratchet come to be so few why
[1:53:42] it won't even be missed what he said
[1:53:45] it'd be a very very few see and nobody
[1:53:48] can figure it out what's he talking
[1:53:50] about he said why the judgment will be
[1:53:53] falling and they started in
[1:53:54] Alaska see the judgments in Arizona just
[1:53:57] flooding and snowing and all across a
[1:54:00] dry desert see me Rivers Running and so
[1:54:02] forth judgments are falling all across
[1:54:04] the land and so forth the judgments
[1:54:06] would be falling Christ would be on the
[1:54:08] earth in his message word in your heart
[1:54:12] living and then certain ones would come
[1:54:15] and run and say well why sayth the
[1:54:17] scribes that Elijah must first come
[1:54:19] where's he at see me now why don't he
[1:54:21] raise up from there see me now ai
[1:54:24] already come didn't
[1:54:26] know why he was a prophet from the
[1:54:28] foundation of the world he went fourth
[1:54:30] in 1933 didn't you know it what do you
[1:54:33] think he stood up there and said stop
[1:54:35] cutting your hair for that was God
[1:54:37] speaking to you sister that that was God
[1:54:40] speaking to you through his word did you
[1:54:42] know it then you see to me now but you
[1:54:45] did unto him whatsoever you listed you
[1:54:48] see that was God being revealed in human
[1:54:50] skin there but his so simple is say that
[1:54:53] something will come among you it'll pass
[1:54:55] over you pass right on through you won't
[1:54:56] even see it that's the way God does he
[1:54:58] comes in Simplicity now I'm not telling
[1:55:01] you that Elijah has already come I'm not
[1:55:05] telling you that brother Brandon will
[1:55:07] not raise from the dead please don't go
[1:55:09] out there and say that I said to you
[1:55:11] that why I said the scribes is he
[1:55:13] already come is your heart restored back
[1:55:16] I say to you if God wants to raise him
[1:55:18] that's God's business am amen that'll be
[1:55:20] according to the will of God so when you
[1:55:23] pray you pray Lord let thy will be done
[1:55:27] make sure that you don't pray a Miss
[1:55:29] make sure that all that the bruised
[1:55:32] pattered messenger fought with a a torn
[1:55:35] up stomach for 40 years to bring you the
[1:55:38] message and here is Le and you run
[1:55:40] somewhere else the mess is supposed to
[1:55:42] be in your heart you don't have to run
[1:55:44] nowhere supposed to be in your heart if
[1:55:46] you want to go down there go down
[1:55:47] orderly go down there and see the
[1:55:49] prophet because see his remains and come
[1:55:51] on back home
[1:55:52] but you got the message he got it home
[1:55:54] to you and Rome killed him see but he
[1:55:58] got it home to you that's right so
[1:56:01] therefore if you want know what that's
[1:56:02] the message the message went forth to me
[1:56:06] see to me
[1:56:08] now people want to ask you question I
[1:56:10] don't I'm not going to answer any
[1:56:11] questions I just preach your word up
[1:56:13] here amen I'm not going to try to
[1:56:14] explain nothing you cannot explain this
[1:56:17] it must be revealed to the Eagles so
[1:56:20] brother Hunt and I the holy spirital
[1:56:22] because because you're both of us don't
[1:56:23] try to explain nothing cuz they somebody
[1:56:26] come ask you this and ask you that I
[1:56:27] don't know nothing I'm just a servant of
[1:56:29] the Lord doing what I'm supposed to do
[1:56:31] here in New York that's all I'm supposed
[1:56:32] to do here see amen now if God change it
[1:56:34] then then I'm happy it's all right with
[1:56:36] me see man now but I'm going to do what
[1:56:39] it says I'm going to preach the word you
[1:56:40] see the me now so therefore If the
[1:56:43] message has been restored and he had the
[1:56:46] message do you all say that there amen
[1:56:48] was something restored to your heart do
[1:56:50] you believe in all that the prop have
[1:56:52] said that's the
[1:56:54] message your heart was turned away from
[1:56:56] Pentecost baptism whatever it was turned
[1:56:58] to the word you want to hear the word
[1:57:01] the word the word and your heart will
[1:57:03] restored to the word and believe in all
[1:57:06] that God's Prophet has said and he
[1:57:10] looking down over the banon right now
[1:57:12] he'd be happy if he see all of us
[1:57:14] because be like be like across the
[1:57:16] country I mean exalting one another
[1:57:19] assembling ourselves together with love
[1:57:22] you know what I mean now and not with a
[1:57:23] lot of rankling and also accusations and
[1:57:25] you said this over here and what you
[1:57:27] mean over here and so forth he would be
[1:57:29] happy to know that his message got home
[1:57:32] see his message got home so you make
[1:57:34] sure today that the message of God got
[1:57:36] home to your heart for it's the word of
[1:57:38] God then if that has happened he said
[1:57:41] the next thing would happen number two
[1:57:44] the second thing amen the shout oh yes
[1:57:49] um number two the second thing is the
[1:57:52] voice of an archangel Jesus on the cross
[1:57:54] now notice this now Jesus up on the
[1:57:57] cross Jesus gave up the ghost is
[1:58:00] finished see the work is finished gave
[1:58:03] up The Ghost and cried with a loud voice
[1:58:06] and the resurrection took place and
[1:58:08] right the voice came after the son of
[1:58:12] man God Prophet died all right amen amen
[1:58:16] see talking about now the Holy Spirit
[1:58:18] see went down and preached souls in
[1:58:19] prison but a voice he cried with loud
[1:58:22] voice something that he said so brother
[1:58:24] Brown said that there was something in
[1:58:25] jesus' voice some words that he spoke
[1:58:28] now watch this now all the old Saints
[1:58:32] from Adam on down they were asleep is
[1:58:35] that right don't miss that they were
[1:58:38] sleeping see me now so in they sleeping
[1:58:41] though they were in a different place
[1:58:43] they were still sleeping they wasn't
[1:58:44] dead but he woke them up with a cry he
[1:58:49] cried out on the cross and they woke up
[1:58:52] Resurrection time and they come up and
[1:58:54] walked around there that right the Bible
[1:58:57] says that the bride is sleeping
[1:59:00] slumbering sleeping that right amen so
[1:59:03] the Lord himself must descend leave his
[1:59:06] body in the air left his bite up on the
[1:59:08] cross didn't he and the work is finished
[1:59:12] the message got home that right is it
[1:59:15] living in your heart though we're
[1:59:16] sleeping we're dead the body is dead
[1:59:18] we're sleeping but there's going to be a
[1:59:20] voice of thunder
[1:59:22] Jehovah God something he's going to say
[1:59:25] is going to wake us up but we sleeping
[1:59:28] they were sleeping a voice Cried Out
[1:59:30] wake up and said certain words and we're
[1:59:32] sleeping that right but when that
[1:59:34] happens that is the resurrection it's on
[1:59:37] the resurrection is on and only the seed
[1:59:39] can come and that's the time when you're
[1:59:41] going to see a little persecution it's
[1:59:43] coming on now see so then the Saints
[1:59:47] arose and Jesus said something and this
[1:59:49] voice again will bring forth the Rapture
[1:59:51] to to the sleeping bride with a shout a
[1:59:55] message that will live amen amen so the
[1:59:58] bride is sleeping and the Thunders must
[2:00:00] be spoken I believe the third thing is
[2:00:03] the the trumpet and this is going to
[2:00:05] call the bride to the wedding supper see
[2:00:08] that's what it's going to be now did God
[2:00:11] give brother brandom three pulls plus
[2:00:14] another pull he gave him three PS little
[2:00:17] birds great doves seven angels as sign
[2:00:21] did he give him sign as an eagle that's
[2:00:24] up to you to know see I'm not saying
[2:00:26] anything all I know is that he passed
[2:00:28] away all I know is that he said that the
[2:00:31] message got home now whether he's to
[2:00:33] come back as the eagle again I don't
[2:00:35] know see this the eagle age whether
[2:00:38] there'll be one Eagle all over again see
[2:00:40] me now whether it'll be in the
[2:00:42] resurrection Christ himself the Royal
[2:00:44] Seed of Abraham in the resurrection in
[2:00:48] that time quickly bodies to see many
[2:00:51] sons like un to himself amen whether it
[2:00:53] be the all the eagles gathered there you
[2:00:56] follow me now amen that if that is the
[2:00:58] case that's what I'm looking for amen so
[2:01:01] I pray that you understand what I said
[2:01:02] just now amen so I'm saying to you that
[2:01:05] I'm not saying brother brm is not going
[2:01:06] to rise I didn't say that I said if he
[2:01:09] rise it'll be for the glory of God it'll
[2:01:11] be God's will see mean now but I know
[2:01:14] this that there's got to be a
[2:01:15] resurrection power come among the bride
[2:01:18] I know that and if he doesn't rise up he
[2:01:20] so I heard said himself that I go away
[2:01:23] but I'll come back in a little while at
[2:01:25] the last Trump that's what he said now
[2:01:28] that was this was what was said so
[2:01:30] therefore if people are looking for him
