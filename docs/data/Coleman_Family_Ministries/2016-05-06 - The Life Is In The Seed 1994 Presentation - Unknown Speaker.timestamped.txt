[32:19] Hallelujah
[32:21] Nigeria I've heard by the hearing of my
[32:24] ear I've heard the testimonies from
[32:27] brother Roo and brother Theo and brother
[32:31] bomo about a group of people over in
[32:34] Nigeria and it's so full of Faith so
[32:37] full of worship so full of fire that the
[32:40] devil can't stand and stay in your
[32:42] services but now tonight now tonight my
[32:46] eyes see it I see it I feel it
[32:50] BL Hallelujah I feel good
[32:54] tonight Hallelujah
[32:58] amen
[32:59] worship what B says that what
[33:02] Jeffersonville needs and I say what
[33:05] Legos needs oh hallelujah what Nigeria
[33:08] needs is thousands of Liv voices that's
[33:13] the Thunder that shakes the devil that's
[33:15] the Thunder that shakes the devil your C
[33:18] won't Shake him your C w't Shake him
[33:21] Minister you're preaching your preaching
[33:23] will shaking but you get one young
[33:25] person so living with Christ walking the
[33:28] streets of Legos walking the streets of
[33:31] Anisha walking like him and talking like
[33:33] him that's the Thunder that's going to
[33:35] shake the devil oh but said if Satan get
[33:39] a hold of it if he can get a hold of it
[33:42] he'll do great damage because what will
[33:44] he do he'll try to separate the light
[33:46] the virtues from the Thunders but he
[33:49] can't do it because the Thunders are in
[33:51] you are in you
[33:58] it seemed odd to
[34:00] Nicodemus how can a man be born again
[34:05] must he craw back into the womb of his
[34:08] mother and be born again how is that
[34:11] possible and today it seems so hard to
[34:15] think that in this filthy sinful
[34:21] generation that someone could have the
[34:23] ocity to say that there is a real Holy
[34:26] Spirit and I'm not going to be content
[34:30] I'm not going to be satisfied until that
[34:32] Holy Spirit comes into my life and what
[34:36] changes it so I'm no longer walking the
[34:39] same and act in the same until I have a
[34:42] new spirit and I new walk and a new talk
[34:47] it seems OD that's why so many churches
[34:50] even churches in the message will not
[34:53] preach that oh it can only get you to
[34:56] just believe that when you believe the
[35:01] message you are born
[35:03] again but I'm going to show you tonight
[35:06] that cannot be that never was that never
[35:10] will
[35:10] be Jesus said ye must be born again amen
[35:18] there's no way of getting around that
[35:20] there's no way of going over that you
[35:23] cannot crawl under that purse he must be
[35:27] born
[35:30] yeah what is the Holy Ghost but B him
[35:33] take the Holy Ghost to the Red Sea he
[35:35] explain how the children of Israel came
[35:38] out of Egypt they came out of the world
[35:41] but how Pharaoh wasn't going to let them
[35:43] wasn't going to let them have a safe
[35:45] passage to the promised land and when
[35:47] you become a Christian and you accept
[35:49] salvation the devil's not going to let
[35:51] you have a safe passage to the promised
[35:54] land you're not going to let you have an
[35:55] easy passage up to heaven
[35:58] and what is what what did he do he took
[36:01] all of the old task Masters and all of
[36:04] the old soldiers and they GA it all
[36:07] together and begin to chase those
[36:09] Israelites and what happens to you all
[36:11] those old sins that you thought you were
[36:13] deliver from the devil drags him back up
[36:16] on those old spirits on those old
[36:18] Temptations and he drags them back up
[36:20] and he gets you to a place where you're
[36:22] Corning the red seat in front of you
[36:25] behind you you hear the you hear
[36:27] Pharaoh's arm to the right of you is the

[37:21] upset just get desperate hey Lord feel
[37:23] me Lord feel me Lord oh think about it
[37:27] or your living or your sanctification
[37:30] will be in vain without the baptism of
[37:32] the Holy Ghost all these years you've
[37:34] stood for him all these years you took a
[37:36] stand on your job in your school all
[37:39] your prayers all of everything you've
[37:41] ever done in his name Will mean nothing
[37:44] without the baptism of the Holy
[37:46] Ghost oh get desperate
[37:53] tonight that is the message there's
[37:55] nothing else these minutes that should
[37:56] be preaching people have to get them to
[37:59] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[38:01] there's nothing else I could tell you
[38:02] young people than to be filled with the
[38:04] Holy Ghost don't rest day or night until
[38:07] you're so sealed with the
[38:09] [Applause]
[38:11] spirit but the reason why I can say this
[38:14] now we can preach this message now is
[38:16] that the holy spirit is loose te for
[38:20] you bless it be name now listen I'm
[38:23] coming to a climax now if you want to
[38:27] take one thing home with you tonight
[38:29] take this
[38:30] home the question is when are you a seed
[38:36] when are you a seed of
[38:43] God are you a seed of God when you
[38:46] receive the Holy Ghost
[38:49] no you always was a SE of God
[39:00] you do not become seed by the new birth
[39:03] because you are seed you can receive the
[39:05] new birth but Brown said if you were not
[39:08] asking for it there would be no Holy
[39:10] Ghost but the only reason there's a Holy
[39:12] Ghost is because you want it cuz you
[39:14] want it that's the only reason God gave
[39:16] it to you cuz you are a seed of God oh
[39:19] Hallelujah
[39:29] upon whom did the Spirit fall on
[39:32] Pentecost upon sons of God and upon whom
[39:35] is the spirit going to fall here in
[39:37] Lagos Nigeria upon sons of God upon
[39:40] seeds of God because on the inside
[39:43] inside is a deep calling and because
[39:45] there a deep inside of you there a deep
[39:47] to respond if there were no deep in you
[39:50] there would be no deep to respond but
[39:52] the only reason there a deep responding
[39:54] is a deep in you and the only reason
[39:56] there a deep in you cuz there a deep to
[39:58] respond blessed be his name there's no
[40:01] reason to fear him
[40:03] tonight who probably were Sinners maybe
[40:06] you were in some formal church and not
[40:08] believe in the baptism of the Holy
[40:09] Spirit but you heard the message there
[40:11] was something in there called out for
[40:13] moral God you might have been living in
[40:15] the Justice High State before God but
[40:17] you wanted the baptism of the Holy
[40:18] Spirit and you hungered for it now the
[40:21] very reason that there is a holy spirit
[40:22] is because you were hungering for it you
[40:24] would never hunger for it unless there
[40:26] was something in here to call for it out
[40:28] there see what I mean I would never come
[40:30] all these miles and preach to you about
[40:32] the Holy Spirit unless I knew positively
[40:35] that you could receive it tonight I will
[40:38] never come over here and tell you some
[40:40] Fable and tell you some myth unless I
[40:42] knew that there's a real God I've seen
[40:44] him pour out I've SE I've felt it I've
[40:47] experienced it and there's no reason
[40:49] young people of Nigeria there's no
[40:51] reason why you can't feel you now he
[40:54] can't feel you now amen spirit Lord will
[40:58] go through this building
[41:00] Lord there's any young person in here
[41:02] Lord that's in a back cing condition

[41:06] this altar Lord may they somehow make
[41:08] their way to this Altar and realize
[41:10] there's no more time left there's no
[41:12] more time left for fooling around
[41:14] there's no more time left for halfway
[41:16] believing they go all the way or perish
[41:19] Lord that is my prayer tonight Lord As

[42:45] among
[42:46] Believers amen I love to be uh in a
[42:49] atmosphere of faith and preach a word of
[42:52] the Living God to Believers because the
[42:55] Believers have a way of making the word
[42:58] live hallelujah it's not some dead word
[43:02] praise God or some dry quote praise God
[43:05] but your Amen to the word makes it live
[43:08] praise God makes it a
[43:10] reality amen so we're not here just to
[43:13] quote some quotes or read some words up
[43:16] to you praise God but we're here to see
[43:18] a living God walk out of the pages of
[43:21] the Bible praise God and make himself
[43:24] real this morning to Our Living Church

[44:00] [Applause]
[44:15] on Christian soers
[44:19] [Applause]
[44:32] wonderful
[44:38] hallah may be seated so they fight it
[44:40] praise God and they try to say well we
[44:42] have something much greater than that
[44:45] praise God we know listen we've got to
[44:48] preach the Holy Ghost and we've got to
[44:50] preach the Holy Ghost as the Holy Ghost
[44:52] itself as a promise and identify it
[44:56] because when it comes comes it'll speak
[44:58] for
[45:01] itself it'll speak for
[45:06] itself the manifestation will be the
[45:09] interpretation of the Holy Ghost
[45:12] [Applause]
[45:17] itself praise God hallelujah amen those
[45:21] apostles were men of few words they
[45:23] didn't wasn't busy amen with wasted
[45:26] words praise God but when they spoke
[45:29] they have thus sayith the Lord even in
[45:32] their shadow the the lame walk in the
[45:34] cripples walk in the blind sword it
[45:36] spoke for
[45:40] itself for he was the manifestation of
[45:43] the entire Old Testament mystery you
[45:46] realize that the scribes and the
[45:48] Pharisees they read the Old Testament
[45:51] they read it but it was a mystery to
[45:53] them but Christ was the Ephesians
[45:59] the entire mystery
[46:02] unfolded that Ephesians made
[46:06] manifest the promised
[46:09] Messiah oh
[46:12] [Applause]
[46:15] my so what are you saying uh brother obl
[46:19] what are you saying brother brium
[46:22] prophesied it but we promised another
[46:25] Ephesians
[46:27] the word made
[46:29] flesh another Ephesians made
[46:32] manifest oh my my
[46:37] [Applause]
[46:39] mind so now there's got to come in
[46:42] Ephesians to this because everybody
[46:44] claimed to be Church everybody claimed
[46:47] to be bride everybody claimed to be in
[46:49] the message but there's got to be a
[46:51] coming calling out
[46:53] of there's got to be a distinct
[46:56] difference
[46:57] [Applause]
[46:59] everybody's not the same everybody's not
[47:02] bride there is a pride and God is going
[47:06] to identify that prde call her out by
[47:09] another
[47:10] [Applause]
[47:13] Ephesians you may be
[47:16] seated we received Letters by the
[47:19] literal hundreds from Uganda different
[47:21] all African nations and ministers have
[47:24] gone there for years with word word word
[47:27] word and now what has happened the seven
[47:29] Thunders has spread like
[47:32] wildfire all over Uganda all over Africa
[47:36] North Africa South Africa what is
[47:38] happening the seeds are being C
[47:40] [Applause]
[47:44] out fire he would be the same Messiah
[47:47] that led Israel praise God out of Egypt
[47:50] he would be the same Messiah you may be
[47:52] seated if you can praise God so what
[47:55] would Messiah be today he would not be
[47:57] an intellectual giant he would not be a
[48:00] religious politician but he would be
[48:02] Vindicated word manifested word god
[48:06] living among his
[48:08] people that's
[48:12] Messiah so when you see the Holy Ghost
[48:14] pouring out and filling the people that
[48:16] is Messiah God living among
[48:20] [Applause]
[48:21] us when you see the cripples and the
[48:24] crutches being flung up in the air is
[48:27] [Applause]
[48:30] Messiah cross over now over the Jordan
[48:34] he said let us stop playing games let us
[48:38] stop playing you mean to tell me until
[48:41] they cross over into the Jordan they're
[48:44] only playing games
[48:47] yes they're playing with God's
[48:49] people but we don't play games we have
[48:52] crossed over to the back of the book

[59:58] Christian and when you call upon the
[1:00:00] name of the
[1:00:02] Lord you're calling on something special
[1:00:05] and not anyone can call on his name but
[1:00:09] B talks about a group of Jews Vagabond
[1:00:12] Jews who had heard about the Miracles
[1:00:16] that Peter that had been done through
[1:00:18] Peter and they had heard that Peter had
[1:00:20] called upon the name of Jesus Christ so
[1:00:23] they felt that they can do the same
[1:00:25] thing there was a man possessed with
[1:00:27] devils and they came into his house and
[1:00:29] they said in the name of that which
[1:00:32] Peter calls Jesus I cast you
[1:00:34] out and that devil spoke back to them
[1:00:38] that devil
[1:00:40] said Peter I know and Jesus I know but
[1:00:46] who are
[1:00:51] you but in our day Satan will know who
[1:00:55] we are he'll know our walk he'll know
[1:00:57] our talk and when we say get the hits
[1:01:00] he'll go Hallelujah because we will bear
[1:01:04] his name we will be called Christians
[1:01:07] it's a responsibility but one which we
[1:01:09] are capable of holding because we are
[1:01:12] his children his name is our name that's
[1:01:16] our family name Christians part of
[1:01:21] Christ is not just the man you see on
[1:01:24] the street smoking sming a cigarette and
[1:01:27] drinking

[1:01:31] unbeliever has a form of
[1:01:34] [Applause]
[1:01:37] godliness listen now a form of
[1:01:42] godliness for a season he will do the
[1:01:45] works of God he will do the works of God
[1:01:48] in a season but in the end he will deny
[1:01:51] the power
[1:01:52] thereof a form of godliness but deny of
[1:01:56] power worry about the unbeliever you
[1:02:00] keep preaching the word and they will

[1:02:08] churches let them walk away just wave
