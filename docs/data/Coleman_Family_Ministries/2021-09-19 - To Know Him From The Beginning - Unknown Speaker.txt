remain standing thank you brothers for saint john 17. for everybody feeling fine amen [Music] amen amen praise the lord uh i think i don't think you're going to forget that one too soon i'm actually this part says uh yeah and if i says no so you get caught up in the middle there somewhere each amends hung up amen praise god well amen right i don't have anything to lose i have everything to gain so praise god i'm going to preach what god told me to say amen that's the way i feel this morning tired and weary don't know don't see nobody or nothing amen so don't get in my way now i'm only kidding you praise god i got a little a soft paddle that's all it man praise god saint john 17 i start speaking like that i won't have anybody left brother bobby trying to break his arm getting out of here amen so saint john 17 i invite your attention amen and you find the mark of saint john 20 and revelation 10 these words spake jesus saint john 17 and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour has come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou has given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him is that wonderful for the foundation of the world god gave x amount and x amount every generation and then jesus the word amen through the ministry in the messengers when they would speak that word in that age or whatever what god has given so many and so many shall come praise god there's nothing to fail nothing to worry about who's going out who won't praise god nothing to do with it so many has been given and so many will come and hell of high water won't stop them praise god because god has spoken it in so shall it be [Applause] amen when you begin to feed a talk like that then you begin to know who you are brother those muscles begin to grow out praise god hallelujah amen and this is the season where you're going to know who you are you're going to be planted down amen and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou has sent i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which god gave us me to do wouldn't it be wonderful you could stand at the resurrection say that god pulled me out of school and pulled me out of here and put me out of the air and told me to finish the work and to glorify me on this earth and you can stand there that last angel stands here with that last trumpet praise god and you can stand the adopted and anointed praise god self finish the word praise kept the cost amen praise god fought a good fight amen hallelujah that's the christian slip slagging here and there amen stand there amen and now father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was isn't that wonderful saint john 20 verse 30. i'm finishing up on these three virtues amen march 31st april 7th and april 28th this is the third one amen and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book but these are written that you might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that the and that believing you might have life through his name and for the fourth time we have to we're born to go to that angel and i hope is they finally get there we've been trying to go to him since a long time since 1974 then more specifically in 1988 and tied it into the reading of the seven seals and see when we still couldn't get there so she said play those two tapes back on wednesday speak to him about going to the angel on the 14th of april he said now come back today and nail it down and we don't have any more time to wait for you to go to the angel praise god revelation 10 8 and the voice which you heard from heaven speak to me again just a second time amen and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth now do you understand that that class this angel is standing where on 42nd street or would he be standing here saint patty's or would he be here some good baptist church or over there or would it be here in new york city with all the filth with all the sin great grace is that can we say amen shout it out it's just a man told you to come to this man who who you think is here this morning it'll be so humble and simple behold i come as a thief [Applause] then came jesus 17 years but he's here see it picking up another octave is beginning to go off he's really here and i went to the angel let that be your testimony today and say to him give me the the little book he said let me take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey oh how i can testify about that brother it was in my belly for 17 years bitter when i had to stand up and say to seven thunders seven thunders for 17 years in america and in canada and europe and south africa in the west indies i was slain and cursed and persecuted for saying give me the book for eating the book it was sweet when that revelation come about the thunders and so forth but when i had to stand up and tell the brethren because they didn't hear it first and i had to say it amen then i was cursed so i've been through my bitterness time time for you to go through it time for you to stand out against whoever this friend or whoever it is amen take a stand for jesus see i'm giving my testimony i've lived it amen i know what people see the people was not supposed to know so that's why he had to give me brotherly kindness to forgive them before they even open their mouths up i forgave me for the foundation of the world praise god amen i did i was in christ forgiving them as he forgave me i forgave them oh come on brother oh well what's now we in the word now you better have been reading and studying this message amen and i took a little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and it was and as soon as i eaten it up my belly was bitter now this is identified on blasphemous names for the age brother bram said just as every uh uh is it just as every age met their requirement paul and arenas and martin columba lutheran wesley malik in there so will that seventh age meet their requirement a world falling apart do you know what that means that means that we in this message and our requirement is brotherly kindness forgiveness and the prophet prophesied that we would meet that requirement [Applause] he would let all kind of tests come and demons come against you family come against you for nothing just so that you can meet that requirement i forgive your brother i love you i forgive you that's the message [Music] and he said unto me thou must prophesy again and before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings may god bless and read of his word well praise god you may be seated amen well everybody's feeling fine lord strange thing i had this message here actually preached it several years ago but to kind of bring it up to date i felt that the knowledge is to know christ and brother keith campbell from tulsa sent me a letter beautiful letter the other day and while i have i see i stayed home last sunday because i knew the wedding would be this weekend and there would be no way i could study so i stayed home last sunday and studied and made up this message and i had a letter a little sign to me brother keith and he said ps i always liked the story of the past that brother muscaro always has been saying for a long time about the president he said many people know about jesus but they don't know him there is a difference a big difference if i were to tell you i know about the president of the united states you would say big deal everybody does but if i told you i personally know and have met and have shook the hand of the president of the united states then that would really be something different you would say wow you personally know the president of the united states so to really know christ is something very different than to know about him [Applause] and that's what i've been leaving for for 17 years to get you to know him not just about him amen so to really know christ is something very different from the know about him many many multitudes know about him and spend their whole lives studying him and many in the message study the message about him being revealed in malachi 4. but they still don't know him they're in the message where him came and revealed himself and they still don't know him because they study intellectually about him so our purpose this morning for you to go to him [Applause] and finally walk out these doors knowing him and not just about him amen may be seated many many many multitudes know about him and spend their whole lives studying him but only very few actually know him to know him is life there's a difference that's different between the holy ghost and others who know about him the person received the holy ghost they know him from the beginning amen brother come on now praise god yes siree so i got a beautiful letter from sister henrietta of plavoi and she used to be married to brother marcel and then she was telling me uh uh how um uh the this message of some have compassion back then february 17th really she saw the revelation there forgiveness and so forth and then your testimony was that then brother oblato preached easter morning he really said some things that really shook her up and she felt like she couldn't forgive thing forgive people that had done so many things to her i guess is back in haiti somewhere i don't know but anyway she couldn't and she prayed throughout easter day and way up until uh monday morning at one o'clock in the morning still praying to get to want to forgive and forget you see and then finally somewhere during the week it left her then she walked in here sunday morning april 7 and there was the message then came jesus and jesus met her and she says baptizer with the holy ghost and fire because she forgave and you cannot receive the holy ghost unless you forgive and forget so i'm not looking for 15 to be baptized it's just one amen so that's the way it's going to be when you can forgive and give up and forget about it and don't think it what was done to you was worse than what was done to that one that's the spirit that won't die you maybe see this you don't understand lord but see the way it happened to me on this day and going over there on this street that was worse than what they did see me now because the way it happened me who are you i mean the lord said what's all this nonsense you're telling eternity tell me the word says when you stand praying if you have ought to drop it i can't go over my word i don't care if you've been here for 25 years but i cannot go with my work sister no you have to go back and give the worst one the one who did the worst things to you until you forgive her i will not forgive you so be delivered today because you're going to know him from the beginning it wasn't so from the beginning hallelujah so you understand now praise god so to know him not about him and in this message they've been knowing about him in books and quotes and tapes that's about him but we preach him crucified [Applause] amen okay you may be seated my subject is that voice spake the voice spoke and the shout went out let that voice speak again and the voice of the archangel will go out [Applause] catch what i'm saying and how behold i come as a thief amen between before the california earthquake and between the gulf war are coming in somewhere maybe i come to see thomas then came jesus oh hallelujah just saying if these messages didn't come back around what what would be in georgia wouldn't be nothing there amen because i saw i told a brother saying all those three messages of wave sheath and so forth and some have compassion and messy morning star what a blessing and going on and what it means to the church and all the different ones are telling me the same thing and i said yes fine i said now in your own church you're having a wonderful revival and the people are being revived in your church now take that anointing and inspiration to the other groups that you know fully well for the last 17 years and you got orange go into their church the one maybe left your church and went to another church and this family left your family split up huh go to everyone that left your particular church you went to this one morning went to that one and go back there and say i love you i forgive you then you come back and tell me oh we're having a wonderful time brother coleman and i said wonderful i said brother i didn't want to preach no more after the last year that's why because i'm preaching to people right here and his inspiration and they won't forgive one another and the holy spirit told me that's it he says he can't go no further and but in each church or they have a revival because their own kind you don't care and you're forgiven but you got to love the unlovely [Applause] you got to love the ones and forgive the ones that did the worst things to you i mean according to what you think anyway but now according to what god says so you may be seated hallelujah so my title is to know him from the beginning my subject is that voice speak again go and take that little book which is opening the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth amen well how many enjoyed the wedding that was privileged to be there yesterday a beautiful wedding brother antonio and antonino and sister nader and it was quite something there at the uh that's right amen it was really something there that that cake cutting was something amen praise the lord and so we certainly want to welcome reverend uh uh kwame uh jose uh the united methodist church and he's here with brother wilson gemma stand up brother we can welcome you here amen he's from ghana i believe amen and he's a graduate of oru and he's going back there for his masters so he come and he phoned brother wilson they were boyhood chums see and see both he and christ and both of you stay together amen you didn't cut the line amen praise god well that's wonderful we welcome here brother and we thank god that you're here and may you you get your masters praise god and who are or doctorate or oh i mean i mean how has you too low praise god you have to higher higher you got a higher calling amen yes siree so god bless you there brother amen and we got a higher calling here too amen we're trying to get them up here praise god amen glory so praise god and i want to welcome the and sister male in my god when she sang a song i think it was a sister marla i think it was that that righteous tamala she sang it at your uh um is that righteous melon the 20 on the 25th that's when it was here and when she sang it god spoke to me amen i think i told her and yeah how shocked that was when i heard that you're going to sing it again this morning come to this man the very thing i'm preaching amen oh my praise god god bless you sister marlon amen praise god [Applause] how many years went down down the line praise god and we certainly want to welcome the entire mara family they're up there in the balcony with the headsets i want to welcome them here for coming over for the wedding of their son praise god bless my brother and his family and brother and sister barn trager uh from indiana brother tommy's church and uh sister rita and brother jim bontrager and our brother daniels and and stephanie colembrand all the way from germany and our brother here from florida uh perez cousin i believe and uh so we thank god that they're here and like i say we want to special bless upon brother and sister right amen and all the other visitors may god bless you amen praise god so friends now what i'm doing trying to do you pray that god give me the strength uh you've got to go to that angel it must be clear that god would bring it back and just be the fourth time that is it's it's uh imperative it's imperative i don't know you don't know how much to tell you because if you was here easter or seen the royalty mayor's message you would know that something happened here in the holy spirit after 17 years of preaching that is finished and then he says now you go to thomas uh next eight days later i don't know what to tell you so therefore that's all oh finish that so now you go to the angel and i spoke to you on the 14th and then the wednesday was on the tape then last one is on the tape and now today is the fourth time and as you know wouldn't be wonderful and we'd be sitting down in georgia and everybody would do a real revelation of brotherly kindness and all those who had gone to different groups and split up was all gathered in there together and before the meeting even started they started uh going to one another's rooms having prayer and making things right brother brown said that on the tape he said going from room to room making things right getting orcs out wouldn't the holy spirit come down in the meat like that oh my my don't hold any bitterness in your heart amen you could take that on with you to tribulation and period in hell somewhere amen forgive it what's that mean i'm let you let that block you from going to heaven no no way amen so uh so now we want to speak um brother oblater myself but the strength of the lord the next eight sundays including today to see if something we can hear the rustling of the top of the mulberry tree or something and some of you people can get sealed up amen like our sister henrietta was still on april 7. it's a little season from today come see this man and sister madeline is singing about it and be washed in the blood oh praise god so from april 28th to june 16 just before the making georgia meeting to get some of you seal up for service and now you don't have to pray for me because i want to have two prayer lines may 12th and may 26th it'll be a and o and then of course the other time is whichever sunday that they will fall into and we'll get it straight that's what i want to do god give me the strength so you'll be praying i feel maybe you have a little bit more faith now some of you seen your names in in the book of redemption and so maybe you have faith to get healed now you see a name there well he died for your healing and dying for your the holy ghost then this you come through here i'm anointed we are anointed and you anointed firefalls that's why i haven't attempted to do it again there was enough power here to heal everybody in 1986 but a virtually powerful service but there was no faith on the line so hope for some faith on that line so before we get to may 12 we want to go to that angel anything can happen amen would you like to see another september october november 1983 you remember september 11th the holy spirit just poured out for about five hours we like to see that today or any day break out we can have it you know oh we're building to it oh hallelujah prince got another time around gloria be encouraged but first we got to know him amen okay now you may be seated now god gives us three things he reveals faith and then he pours out the virtue and knowledge and just these little three messages here he's as far as you go he says and then then then uh you just preach these three here and then you move on and then they themselves got to catch it get a revelation then everybody gets sealed amen then they die as a death of a corn and wheat and then they'll begin to show their temperance and patience and goddess and bully kindness see so now to know him from the beginning is the last message to bring up the new people to the present time saint john 17 3 and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou has sent saint john 4 through 5 glory of god the glory of god is for the bride which glory he had before the world began and i just read that and in your cod book page 15 paragraph 29 30. but look now are we looking the whole church now we're standing on a great big banister watching what god's doing and we'll get right down to this question here and you see how he brings it in now no one has seen god now the next thing we begin to see by the eyes of supernatural looking see that supernatural when you sit there in the natural just looking at me i don't see no supernatural and that's why i get exasperated i said well what they're staring at me it's like get in the spirit i mean you don't get spooky i mean but close your eyes and do something amen but just stare at me amen amen see well amen we see a little uh okay the eyes are supernatural looking now don't see something that's not there and say i saw this i saw that you know no not that either see we see a little white light forming out there what is that that was called by bible readers logos the anointed or the anointing as i was going to say the part of god began to develop god was just there and he can't be god until he has an object to to worship him god is the object of worship just great spirit there covered all things knew knew all things there but when did he start he was there in the beginning don't blow your mind not trying to figure when the the theologians the doctorates the masters can only go to saint john 1. is that correct brother in the beginning that's as far as you can go and when you go to your doctorate you ain't going any further he knows this he's not the doctors or whatever it is bhd's he cannot go any further than in the beginning god they can't go no further now i'm telling you something brother the only way you can go further than saint john 1 is to hear a message from a prophet who was able to go way back hallelujah to hear a message of a prophet that was back before the beginning glory that's the only way the only way hallelujah you may be seated and uh we happened i was a little different it's not a classroom but this is a big is this open but we're actually going for our doctors also on the third phase amen praise god that's right uh dr bolomo and dr thiory over here praise god so now uh amen praise the lord yes sorry get that down amen praise god yes siree and i and part of god began to develop into so human beings could have some type of an idea of what it was amen was it a little low a little light moving that was the word of god now god gave himself birth to this son which was before there was even an atom or air to make an atom that was see jesus said glorify me father i read the scripture with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world see way back yonder mind saint john 1 he said in the beginning was the word and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us god unfolding himself into a human being that we might talk to him and speak to him and handle him and oh praise shake his hand and sit down and break bread with him praise god and we will drink the communion with him in the end after the battle's over after the panel's over praise god hallelujah after battling the demons that won't let you forgive uh defeat those demons and see if you don't be purged out and feel the light is a feather no more weight on your shoulders no more hallelujah praise god free like an eagle amen you may be seated how many understand about the the white light and then the seven rainbows coming out of the white light would you like to hear an article about that huh okay uh december 11 1990 in the news day long island paper discoveries for young people how come this is captioned the colors of the rainbow and the sun amen i thought i'd read it to you what does the sun why does the sun change color sometimes it's red or orange and other times it's yellow writes jeremy tan a second grader in merrick imagine you are orbiting the earth in the space shuttle you look out at the sun glowing against the inky black of space and it appears white or imagine standing on the surface of the moon and gazing up at the sun from there it would also look white but here on earth look at the sun through the blanket of air surrounding our planet the sun normally looks yellow at sunrise and sunset it may look red or orange or pink how come our star is not really changing colors out by our way out there in space it glows in white light all the time it glows as elohim that white light that went down between abraham's sacrifices hallelujah that's the white light that's him from the beginning to know him that white light from the beginning praise god amen now you learn a little something now elohim white light amen it glows in white all the time the clue is that the sun's color appears to change only when you look at it through the earth's atmosphere remember there is no air in space or around the moon looking at the sun through air is like looking through a veil sunlight which has to pass through the air before it reaches our eyes is changed by its trip so as god the white light began to unfold and coming on down to the earth it began to begin to change color red and yellow and orange and green and blue and indigo and brotherly kindness seven spirits coming down from glory but way back it was white light oh hallelujah first seven spirits seven eyes seven lamps seven voices seven seven lambs my god seven messages seven stars seven thunder seven virtues oh that white light coming down my god to know him from the beginning and one of his attributes is brotherly kindness he come down to forgive us man amen his son died to death praise god on the cross that we might be saved hallelujah and god forgave us our sins hallelujah we catch this revelation then we in turn forgive our brother and our sister no matter how many sins they have committed we forgive them how many times 70 times seven so that out our promise won't be spotted with the flesh for wanting the flesh to be vindicated you did this to me as a pharisee praise god but we are god's children amen you may be seated hallelujah amen oh praise god yes sir where's that now look at the sun through the ears like looking through the the veil that's right before it reaches our eyes it's changed by its trips yes serene by time they got down to us it was in the color brotherly kindness amen amen praise god the light produced inside the sun is white light but white light contains with in it many colors all the colors of the rainbow if you look at a at white light through a prism you will see the rainbow three corner prism you see a rainbow amen the prism splits the white light into colors like a cone separating here into his individual strands as a woman combs in here or man and goes into individual strands and so as they combed through the white light it went into seven strands praise god and samson had those seven strands hallelujah all seven little strands on the back it's oh lord once more i can reach back and feel them seven strands hallelujah that white light my god praise god come alive new york praise god yes sir [Applause] maybe see the the prism splits the white light into colors like a comb separating hair into individual strands white light enters the prism bands of red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet light stream out the other side something similar happens when sunlight passes through the raindrops making a rainbow in the sky white light is invisible invisibly full of color as it zips through the space at 186 000 miles per second and when it enters the earth's atmosphere some of the light slices cleanly through reaching the ground untouched staying white sometimes amen but since the earth's air is made of molecules such as nitrogen and oxygen some of the light will run into these molecules on its way down and when it does light is scattered yes sir it is mostly bluish light that is scattered out of the white light beam so by the time sunlight reaches our eyes most of the blue end of the spectrum the blues and purples that scatter out into the sky this is uh what makes the blue sky by the way because it's black out there man you see blue sky amen praise god me and see we are getting our doctrine here this morning amen amen brother praise god meanwhile the sun beam having lost his blues isn't that nice the sunbeam lost his blues did you did you lose your blues uh set the hell on his guns he lost her blues amen praise god yes sir see lost the blues you have a little sense of humor you know he should have caught him right away i lost the blues oh praise god you know amen praise god having lost his blues is now much yellower since the colors that are left in the beam are the warm colors so instead of white the sun looks yellow to us as sunrise the sunset an even more dramatic change occurs sunlight must travel through an even thicker layer of air that it does than it does through the rest of the day why when the sun is overhead the light passes through just the air above us air that becomes thinner and thinner higher up but when the sun is near the horizon its light must pass through many thick layers of air those nearest to the ground the light runs into even more air molecules than usual so even more of the blue and of the spectrum is scattered out of the light beam this leaves only orange and red sunlight in the beam and so we see the sun is a fiery orange ball getting redder and redder as it sinks but it sinks lower into the sky going down in the west so praise god you understand so when you hear me speak my white light and then seven rainbows you know what it is it's god then seven manifestations of the one holy spirit white light see what i'm saying not seven different one seven manifestations not seven spirits separate the seven manifestations of the white light diffused on the earth praise god oh glorify me father with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world so this bride wants to be covered by this glory from the foundation of the world amen that's what she's striving for saint john 3 amen and this is life eternal that they might know thee it means to know to perceive to recognize to become acquainted with and understand you the only time and real god yes sir and likewise to know him jesus as the christ anointed one the messiah the kinsmen redeemer whom you have sent in in these last days in through malachi 4 saint luke 17 30 revelation 10 to open the book of redemption rights and all the mysteries about who god is and what god is and his nature his being and how he's one god and not three gods and all these mysteries plus the seven thunders and they have been revealed for one main purpose that we might know god i'm gonna bring 17 years down to the day that you might know him from the beginning so he got nothing to do with brother coleman's that you might know him from the beginning praise god i don't get no glory out of the praise god god gets all the glory we'll give all the glory to jesus oh hallelujah praise god amen and to know god is life eternal saint john 20 here 30 31 all of the signs and ones and miracles that were done through malachi 4 3 polls and the same life signs and spirit that will be revealed in the bride are done that you might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing you might have life through his name and his name is his person his life his word and you got to know him you gotta know that word yes sir and people back up from the word hallelujah amen [Applause] praise god inspiration then is to know him from the beginning because when we know him from the beginning that is life eternal revealed to us he that hath the son hath life everlasting oh he didn't have the son the word give me that book i have life everlasting i see my name hallelujah i'm in love with the with all my friends my enemies lord bless my enemies bless everybody i'm on my way to heaven praise god diffusing the light out the white light is in me and coming through my body is seven manifestations of the rainbows you see your faith and virtue and knowledge and tempest and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness diffused out hallelujah hey man you maybe see the old church revelation 10 8-11 what a blessed privilege the bride has today through malachi 4's message of the revelation of the book of redemption that is now open in the hand of the angel now he's not standing on 42nd street neither is down in rockefeller center nowhere like that he's not next door he's right here [Music] if you want him come see this man yeah see him in your seat up in the balcony in the basement praise god malachi 4 has restored back to faith amen and just to drop this message back in here again here on revelation book of symbols page 12 paragraph 65 4. so remember daniel was told by the angel daniel heard seven thunders they uttered their voices daniel grabbed his penis on the right and the angel said don't you write it amen are you ready let's get into it just about the next five minutes will you don't write it john saw the same thing and it had already been written outside the bible and had seven seals on the back of the book that no man could open those seals on the back of the book that was them voices here's the bible written see which is a mystery itself they so can't figure this out amen praise god amen that's the mystery itself but on the backside of the bible the revelations were shown to daniel and john back here the revelations of this [Applause] see them voices open up this yes sir praise god on the backside of the bible the revelation was shown to daniel say that there's seven voices to be uttered and no man could open no man know what it was but the bible said it was it told daniel and also john that in the days uh these seven voices would be known by the real true church um you get it can you see where the false and counterfeit is trying their best to keep great men from places like that can you see what was going on in 17 years i was trying to preach you to these places and all these spirits was coming against me to keep me away from these promises i give you the land hallelujah and now we're here glory we overcome we wrestle and prevail glory they couldn't keep us out of there now do you understand what this book is them voices the revelations of the entire book when you get this revelation at you first of all your name is there and then you just then you got the son and you got life hollow you feel different you love everybody you forgive everybody amen and then you go on the people curse you and you overcome all this nonsense you go into heaven you ain't got anything to do with that you're not from here you only come down here for testimony that's all i come from heaven i'm going back to heaven i got heaven on my mind i'm heaven bound i'm bound for the promised land hallelujah glory to god

rise his church right out of it it'll watch it'll be a ceiling for sure as i'm standing in this platform and the hours at hand the cold and formal is weaning away the evangelical and the social gospel

light hallelujah a white light that diffuses out seven colors and in him is no darkness at all no unbelief no doubt no turning around and up and down and in and out that's not in god hallelujah and we walk in the light as he is in that light dwelling in the season then we have fellowship one with the other and that's why god brought these messages back around that we might go down to georgia and

he blasted me but he didn't blast the other one are you kidding me if you got blasted you were purged you were purged to bring forth more fruit maybe god didn't elect that person over there they can't take it but you can take it [Applause] but that's why the holy ghost directed his servant to come right to you because he wants you for his table he knows what's in you he made you he knows your weaknesses he knows you're down sitting in your uprising he knows you from sun up the sun down he knows all the sins you're going to fall for he knows which ones you're going to fall for oh hallelujah praise god so don't get mad when you come in on sunday and you get perished and busted around a little bit it's only god trying to purge you out to get more fruit he's trying to get you over to verse seven amen if my words abide in you you never turn them down you never got mad you never started crying you're picking on me but the words was abiding in you lord beat unto me according to that word then you come on down here asks what you will oh what a something huh to walk down the street would ask what you will my god my god you may be seated want to open your bibles up uh look this little the word lessons here amen i thought we'd be back in the word it's where we preached long time ago amen but you couldn't hardly do it no more people didn't know they were saved or what you know had to keep telling them keep telling them over and over and over the same thing but we're in the word amen first john 2 okay first john 2 12 verse 12. i write unto you little children because your sins now get spiritual here and follow every little word in here now because your sins are forgiven you for his name sake now these little children are very happy because their sins are forgiven just for his name's sake and they're shouting and praising god they don't know nothing else they don't know anything about no thunders or nothing amen they're just happy because he's saved now verse 13 i'll write unto you fathers why because you have known him that is from the beginning yes sir i write into young men because you have overcome the wicked one i write unto you now speaking twice to little children these are two different words i'm gonna prove it out to you because you have known the father the first little child just knows his sins are given but this one has a different one here he's a little bigger than one here and he knows he see the he saw the father amen verse 14 i have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning i have written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of god abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one don't you remember brother brown's dream huh he was coming down there and there was some young men shackled and he started to help them get out of the shackles and he said no they got out themselves because they are strong amen and they overcome the wicked one praise god and the word of god abideth in them and he turns on mrs fenton and then he said mrs fenton and all these people caged up there and she said brother branham he's to carry her groceries she says these are fine people you don't know them you don't understand them they don't understand you she said help those people or he also saw brother borders with something over his eye and said brother boy roy get out of that there and he said that this is not enough in itself see but it was for the young men they got out hallelujah thine the glory the young men got out and but brother boys he couldn't get out of it or something over his eye and some brother brahm said and mrs fenton another denominational group see and they're all in the cage then and so forth he said free those people in the voice they free those people he said i can't i'm too small this bar is there and he's seen the rainbow appeared amen elohim appeared there the rainbow out there and the voice says uh speak and free those people and brother rams stood back and straighten up praise god and said house of hell give way to the name of the lord jesus christ and all those people come up screaming out of that prison praise god may they come out today hallelujah praise amen [Applause] whatever prison you in today may you come out of here today yes sir now we got three groups here of spiritual growth three groups also have spiritual development in the church amen the little children and young man and fathers then we're going to finally have four groups because there's two types of young children amen now these three stages reveal the progression in spiritual maturity at last we have arrived to this station now the father's of course is uh is a sign of adoption time because they know him from the beginning they've been they've been to him took the book and everything hallelujah why well 17 years ago they went to the angel in 1974 and asked the angel for the open book that's why the book of redemption in the angel's hand placed us in elohim to bring forth the adoption sign and the fathers are going to bring out the adoption sign who know him from the beginning somebody must come forth today as a sign to you as a father somebody got to step out here in this message as a father who knows him from the beginning now we can begin to understand saint john 17 1-3 to know him is eternal life and saint first john 2 12 john says he's writing to the little children because they know two things first john 2 12 because your sins are forgiven you for his name sake in first john 2 13 you have known the heavenly father this is wonderful knowledge but it is not enough knowledge with which to go out and do exploits for god just knowing the father and your sins are forgiven little babies see me now and uh and number two here uh there is knowledge of the son but no capacity for service but by revelation we find that there is four stages here st john first john 2 12 little children this is a greek word t-e-k-n-i-a this brother might know over here studying the greek it means infants newborn like you know like uh you can't teach pentecostal babies a supernatural things you know what i mean okay your sins are forgiven and you are and are forgiving you for his name sake they're happy with that you could preach around there would get mad you know so i'd leave him alone amen first john 2 13 greek p-a-p-a-i-d-i-a peter pedia something it means little children it means those able to walk and talk now that's a big difference from little infants and babies though those who can stand up and talk and walk and see what's going on and shout a little bit you know and say praise the lord ah amen praise god from 1965 1991 little children and the feeding on seven seals of revelation and who god is his name is being all about him knows about malachi 4 little children ripening as seeds in the hot sun learning the abcs so that the funds on the back side can be revealed to them all these little children waiting around here now for moving of the spirit they've finally seen that the book the name was in that book and they're getting ready to come to the end they finally believe that god is right here hallelujah praise god nothing can stop him no mind battles can stop him now yes sir so first john 2 30 little children because you have known the father and first john 2 13 they're able to walk and talk and emphasis here is on support but to be subordinate amen rather than on a relationship as in teknia in the first one so now praise god do you see it it's about time to go to that angel in revelation 10 and eat the whole role to make you strong to overcome the evil one and climb out of your shackles as a young man praise god in first john 2 13 14 young man i written to you young man because you have a seventh under revelation you are strong and the word our god abideth in you with a promise of much fruit first saint john 15 7. number three you have overcome the wicked one amen you have a revelation of the two spirits operating with the framework of the church and now it's time for you to die the death of a corn of wheat to become a father yes sir my come on young man you know all these spirits in here you dodge them inside step them in and you got to pat them you pat them down god bless you amen oh yes yes sister yes brother those are spirits amen and the young men have learned to handle those spirits that's why i put them in office deacons and elders and so forth they can handle these things here amen before 83 i hadn't had nobody praise god but i got young men to do that see got sisters down there deacon's wives and whatnot oh hallelujah oh come on young man go to that angel now praise god go get your redemptive rights go get your spoken word praise god hey go get your refilling amen praise god come on come on yes sir go to the age that's standing in revelation 8 10 through 11 with that book open the book of redemption has revealed every spirit and given you a revelation of your redemptive rights come on calebs climb that mountain for your inheritance you have overcome the devil praise god to the two things of the little children uh since were given for his namesake because you know the father you have added three things young men and now the young men have five things all you young men have five things your sins are forgiven for his name's sake you know the father they you are strong the word of god abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one you've overcome the lust of the eye the pride of life hey hallelujah hallelujah praise god yes sir you overcome the wicked one you wrestle with satan for the last 17 years praise god and you stood hallelujah young man the word of god is abiding in you you overcome the promises to the overcomers amen expressing the abiding result of past action young men in the greek means n-e-a-s-k-o-l means those grown to the prime of life oh praise god all your young men young women grown to the prime of life and no longer talks about like little children growing up by interpretations and fallacies and winds of doctrine hallelujah no see ephesians 14 that you'll be henceforth no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine the hours come for the young men to come to their place of trying amen place of trying forgetting all about what's in the world for verse 15 love not the world neither the things that in the world if any man love the world the love of the fathers not in him for all that's in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes the pride of life it's not of the father but it's of the world and the world passes the way and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abide forever now the young men have got to come to this spot that they finally want to give up the world amen in the things of the world and hallelujah they're going to forget all about what everybody likes in the world and amen you want to give up something some young men will have to give up all the sports body exercise profit very little praise god and some are trying to go out of their way to get to sports and things my god don't even realize that behold i come quickly and he i'm coming as a thief i'm jumping right down in on you to see what you're giving up to see if you're dedicating yourself rededicating yourself throwing everything out praise god getting the trash out taking a shotgun and blast the television out boom praise god i don't care if it's a 35 inches wide makes no difference praise god take a shotgun and blast it out that's the young man that's the vision praise god oh hallelujah we want to see you young men become fathers we want to see you adopted praise god yes siree my god you're coming to a place of churn add them seven virtues to be sealed by charity then press on to be a father who knows him from the beginning oh i exhort you today go to that angel praise god and eat that little book hallelujah oh my yes you may be seated there's something very special about the fathers you have known him from the beginning after learning the five other truths of little children young men the fathers with the holy ghost baptism and with years of place of training trying the fathers has been in here for years sick and weary and up and down and all kind of unbelief against them and they're still pressing on that's the fathers now the fathers are soon to be adopted and the young children the second ones are soon to become young men and young men are soon to become fathers [Music] so hallelujah are we all going to wind up fathers all across the earth and everyone's going to know him from the beginning oh hallelujah the father with the amen the father's been through tutoring sanctification maturing and behavior then comes the revelation of elohim in the book of redemption amen god has three ways of doing he don't ever change he told you the first pull is always popularity everybody loves you because that's when you heal the sick and you cast out devils and you even raise the dead so you do that in the first phase jesus did it and brother brahm did it but when you come down to declaring what the doctrine is he said then you enter into another phase that's when you're mean and you're only prophesying praise god what's going to happen so you're prophesying your own promises got nothing to do with no other church you're solving in your own church in new york then some other brothers see the vision they ask you to come to trinidad or europe or somewhere well that's between you and them not the other critics that underdo with those critics i mean do you understand that we stand here we come from god it doesn't make any difference who comes in here that we think has nothing to do with this that god put us here i mean we are his children and we sing the way we want to sing we shout the way we want to shout [Applause] we do the things the way we want to do them and we're not on a microscope of some other believers we don't have anything to do with them they have their own way of worshiping and then we respect them like brother branham got down with the african and worship well we'll go in there if they say oh man we'll do the same thing it's all right praise god but if if i feel that brother i've been sick for about 30 days all of a sudden i get a quick name and get healed and you mean i can't shout [Applause] i've been down on the great siege and uh amen oh no see so long time ago the holy spirit said son do what i tell you to do not what the other think you should do yes sir praise god i thank god for that don't you we're free uh amen glory you may be seated praise god i'm gonna finish up here now uh then it comes a revelation of elohim in the book of redemption then the father's learning something new knowing the one who is from the beginning is a deeper revelation and experience which takes them into the to the councils of the godhead the unsealing of the living testimony under the seventh seal they learn not only what god has done but they learn uh why he did it and their roots go deeper into the eternal truth of elohim praise yessiree way back into the back parts of elohim's mind before there ever was a beginning before there ever was a molecule praise god ever it was anything you go way back in there and from the father's groups comes forth the manifestation of the adopted sons of god oh hallelujah i can see it coming on now yes siree ephesians 4 11 5 4 ministry real adult christian workers praise god they have overcome every spirit why because greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world trying to stop you greater greater greater more powerful sharper praise cut hallelujah they know him in saint john 17 and to know him his eternal life to know him from the beginning he may be seated to move his own to the little children must go to that angel and eat that book and become a young man praise god and a young man must go to the angel and eat that book and become a father and the father must go to the angel and eat that book and become adopted so now who's gonna rest on their laurels every station until god get them all together amen so as a group we want to press on praise god the father is a sign of the new season he's ready to be adopted and god is ready to seal his living seven virtues with charity for adoption the manifestation of the holy spirit in the church is that angel among us see here it recognizes an act upon it revelation 10 9 the bride acts upon the word and i went to the angel the manifestation of the holy spirit here today and said unto him give me that little book he said unto me take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be that my sweetest honey when you have to digest it it gets bitter everybody's against you go to the angels standing on earth with the open book in his hand if you have a revelation act upon it knowing that the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel standing right here this morning go to that angel and say give me the book revelation 10 10 acting upon the word and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up church well anyway 1974 1991 seven thousand are the seven voices seven change ages now i'm gonna throw you here 28 1991 the seven thunders are the seven virtues of the seven church ages why did you say that revelation there because the prophet said on statute of a perfect man page 59 to the ministers he said lord let virtue and knowledge pour out that these ministers may be able to pour the seven virtues into the bride to that perfection of the coming of the son of god praise god for 17 years identify malachi 4's message it didn't die it cannot die my word shall not return to me foreign so that's what i was doing for 17 years identifying brother bram said here here here there their dynamics mechanics thunders voices this that that's what i was doing i was identifying the prophet's message that it would stay alive pray no devil couldn't tear a town praise god and today it remains with the same power oh hallelujah and if you don't believe me you watch a revival break out and hear praise god you watch the blind see you watch the cripples walk you watch the dead be raised up praise god amen and you watch them pour them seven virtues in and just as we are pouring into seven virtues the rest of these guys are going to start saying uh the seven thunders is under the seventh seal or something brother you're too late man praise god we're pointing the virtues to the bride oh hallelujah forget about that's been going on for 17 years so this revelation is to build a pyramid of seven virtues in your hearts for charity to camp off a bride the holy ghost itself coming right down in perfection and back to the word to manifest itself again amen and it was in my mouth sweetest honey as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter there's your charge there you are there's your message praise god sippers got to be inspired to you praise god and hearing my last quote here hearing recognize and praise god do you love him do you know who you are do you know who's standing here this morning hallelujah glory to god all right page 24 rehearing recognizing acting on the word of god got to be inspired to you the holy spirit has to bring it and make it manifest to you did you get it the holy spirit has to bring it well the holy spirit today is the angel i mean the manifestation of the holy spirit is here to bring it he's here because he said he's got to bring it and make it manifest to you so the manifestation of the holy spirit is the angel with the book open his hand standing [Applause] that's what's the matter today you can't get up at this altar and say well hallelujah hallelujah lord i want the holy ghost hallelujah hallelujah no i remember time 1964 when our church was down there brother brown preached the mighty god unveiled in philadelphia and we were the ones that was a men and brother branham and then they had the nerve to think that we didn't understand that god was veiled when he was a very one standing there i said well you kidding me or what i said it was brother coleman in his church brother hun we was right there when you hear amen that was us well nobody else in the mess it was us so we understood that god was unveiled and long before these doctrines started long before the 1964 god was unveiled our church went down i'm bragging now on jesus christ our church went down to see the unveiling of mighty god amy and brother nino everybody went down they come back they were scratching their head i said don't worry about it i'll preach it to you next week praise god i'll tell you how god come down from his glory and went behind skin praise amen and rip down every fail praise god and that bleeding bloody word went out hallelujah praise god and brother brown stood up on a platform praise god with all those full gospel prisoners behind them didn't believe nothing they were going to sleep the sleeping virgins and brother branham said i'm identified with this group [Music] i said amen brother branham praise god i was gone praise god hallelujah i was a wild man praise god amen that's right brother jose praise god is i'm identified with him amen you got to be identified you got

up move up to the fathers come see this man today praise god let him wash you in the blood so you can be adopted over the time you see your name and eternal section of the book of redemption do you know what i'm saying your name is in the eternal section can you see that clearly not just the book of life book of life here you go over there this is the second resurrection somewhere but to know that he would put your name the angels right here wherever this the other words the manifestation is in this message now you want you i don't hurt nobody's feelings see me but there's uh they're gonna

stuff there you know they got some old moldy bread and rags you know and they come on say we come from a far place and now god didn't want that same and then they tricked joshua in them and they come from right around the corner somewhere just let the bread stay out there about four days and so forth and put some holes in your clothes you know and then god was mad about that you see so there'll be those who will come like they've been preaching this all the time see but i feel sorry for him because see it's got to be a manifestation and it won't be there that's where the angel will be with the manifestation you see because see the the prophecy has come along now and all the seeds together all these things here and all of a sudden the angel will pull it out here that bride oh and then he'll
