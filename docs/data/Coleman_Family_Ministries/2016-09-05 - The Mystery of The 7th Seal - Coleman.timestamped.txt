[7:43] lay them here you can still bring them
[7:45] up see but we're not going to read them
[7:47] out like that anymore unless you have it
[7:49] into the song leader at least 5 minutes
[7:52] before but anything that because comes
[7:54] after brother Hunter myself or we just
[7:56] laid here see I hope he understand cuz
[7:59] we can't go through this here it takes
[8:01] uh it takes your mind away from from
[8:02] what you right when you come out that
[8:04] room there you got your mind on the word
[8:06] and then you're looking for a prayer
[8:07] request cuz I just walked in it was
[8:09] about several papers here I'm trying to
[8:11] get them all lined out because in a
[8:12] hurry so cuz we up in the word amen so I
[8:16] I know you understand see God knows
[8:18] these things and just a matter of making
[8:21] it known and you bring it up here is
[8:23] made known he knows it and so we just
[8:25] lay our hands up all of them at one time
[8:28] and ask God to take care of so I hope
[8:31] nobody we would be mature to understand
[8:34] that it wouldn't be slighting any one
[8:36] person so we thank the Lord to be here
[8:39] this morning after the wonderful
[8:41] outpouring that we had Wednesday night
[8:44] amen and so um we're looking for more of
[8:47] the same I
[8:49] am and um I have a message this morning
[8:52] well it might be a little lengthy uh
[8:56] because um I feel that maybe this
[9:00] message would cap off this morning all
[9:02] that I have tried to preach down through
[9:04] the years and bring it to a point to
[9:07] where that's it you know and so maybe uh
[9:11] a little over hour I trust because that
[9:14] all that will all that that's the length
[9:17] of the time it will be I I'm wanting to
[9:19] say now uh I ask you to read as a
[9:21] scripture lesson the uh Christ is the
[9:24] mystery of God reveal and I'm going to
[9:26] quote from here because you understand
[9:29] as I'm doing it why I'm doing this here
[9:32] there's a secret laziness here and when
[9:34] I read it to you you'll understand why
[9:36] so then if there's a secret laying here
[9:39] and all of you are straining and pulling
[9:42] to uh uh know what it is well then if
[9:45] you will make it easier for me when I
[9:47] read it that I don't feel a tenseness
[9:50] you know then I can I start stammering
[9:52] and studing I can feel that uh what's he
[9:54] trying to say what's what's he trying to
[9:56] get at but if we mature
[9:59] and sit back I told Brother uh the
[10:02] little brother Craig I told him he'd
[10:05] come in he'd strained and strained and
[10:06] strain now he's just sitting back
[10:08] relaxing he got the secret last week he
[10:11] sat back he was straining and straining
[10:14] and he told me he's testifying about it
[10:16] he sat back he relaxed boom he was hit
[10:19] right in the head you ask him about it
[10:22] if each one of you who are straining and
[10:25] all twisted up if you could just sit
[10:27] back in your seats amen and just sit
[10:30] back and you're going to get it now I
[10:33] realize
[10:35] that my praise the lord we had a
[10:38] wonderful time Wednesday didn't we amen
[10:40] you know why you was relaxed so you
[10:43] relaxed this morning that's it I was

[10:52] and so I know what I'm talking about see
[10:54] you got it wonderful just and I was
[10:57] talking to this person just the other
[10:58] day day and telling that particular
[11:00] person to relax cuz you're going to get
[11:02] it cuz your mind go out and try to know
[11:05] what I'm going to say before I even say
[11:06] it and I don't know what I'm going to
[11:08] say cuz I preach by inspiration so how
[11:11] can I tell you how can you figure out
[11:13] what I'm going to say if I'm waiting for

[12:53] weeks ago I asked the church to pray for
[12:54] a girl named Mana Walsh who had a
[12:57] nervous breakdown
[12:59] due to parents pressure for education I
[13:01] heard on Friday she's pulling out of

[13:07] the first time praise be to our God for
[13:10] his love and compassion please continue
[13:13] to pray for her soul sister McMurray now
[13:15] here's the one I wanted to our brother
[13:18] Gonzaga from Ecuador and brother uh West
[13:22] saan had testify to him on his job about
[13:24] God and this message here in the end
[13:26] time what God is doing and he's been
[13:28] searching God for a long time and he
[13:31] understands a little English he can
[13:32] speak a little English and he was
[13:34] baptized here I believe it was about two
[13:36] weeks ago I think and then um he had a
[13:40] problem of smoking and and we prayed for
[13:42] him in the back and here's this
[13:44] wonderful testimony I thank the Lord for
[13:47] the blessings he is bestowing on me
[13:50] before I was baptized in the name of the
[13:52] Lord Jesus Christ I had not felt what I
[13:55] have felt recently
[13:57] amen a strange feeling inside of my body
[14:01] in other words something like pains
[14:03] anguish inside of me to such extent that
[14:07] I wanted to scream while I was uh
[14:10] working on my job I felt like running
[14:14] out my hands were not strong enough to
[14:17] to do my work in my mind there were two
[14:21] voices one saying you have to be light l
[14:25] i g HT uh wherever you go you must test
[14:28] ify with yourself in other words a new
[14:31] birth the other voice saying why to
[14:35] leave the things of the world because
[14:37] you enjoyed before like that so sudden
[14:41] the devil speaking and God speaking see
[14:43] why leave the world in the things of the
[14:45] world smoke a cigarette you will quit
[14:48] with the time the voice told him that if
[14:51] you're smoking you'll get rid of it it's
[14:53] all right there something uh lie that's
[14:57] nothing no sin
[14:59] this is amazing no wonder he didn't want
[15:01] me to read this this morning huh then I
[15:04] also had a bad temper that I could not
[15:06] control but the the
[15:08] prayer uh in my mouth always asking the
[15:11] Lord do not faint the love in me amen
[15:15] and that I'll
[15:16] be and I'll be triumphant over the devil
[15:20] because God himself say I can do all
[15:23] things in Christ who strengtheneth me he
[15:26] also say he will that
[15:29] will permit temptations that your body
[15:33] can
[15:34] resist I thank the Lord because peace
[15:37] and calm has come to me I have more
[15:40] desire and thirst of God's word and love
[15:44] and like Paul said From Grace to Grace I
[15:47] will reach Perfection he does all in me
[15:50] I can do nothing I quit smoking 5 days
[15:53] ago something I could never do every 10
[15:56] minutes I had to light a cigarette I
[15:59] quit before on on my own but a little
[16:01] while after I went back to smoking I
[16:04] thought I had no hope so I thanked the
[16:06] Lord because while I was walking and
[16:09] smoking a voice said you have to testify
[16:13] I threw it I threw away the pack of
[16:15] cigarettes and said Lord I am in your
[16:17] hands Brother Carlos Gonzaga It's a
[16:19] Wonderful testimony uh to the grace and
[16:24] the sanctifying power of the word the
[16:27] Lord Jesus Christ so now he's showing
[16:29] you this man hardly understands English
[16:31] and he's showing what Christ can do in
[16:34] you if you will let him do it amen
[16:37] blessed be the name of the Lord now we
[16:40] um another little sister called me last
[16:42] night from over here friend to brother
[16:45] Paul Griffins and uh she called me up
[16:48] last night and told me this almost the
[16:50] same thing that she saw she had a dream
[16:53] where there was a ladder a Jacob's
[16:55] Ladder she was singing that song I'm
[16:57] climbing the cuz Jacob's letter and then
[17:00] uh there was Satan on the left side and
[17:02] God on the right side and it was a pull
[17:04] and I understand sister Elizabeth and
[17:06] brother Thomas and Andrew went over to
[17:08] the Griffin's house last night and they
[17:10] listened to a tape and she got stirred
[17:12] up and she called me last night said she
[17:14] just wanted to talk with me and didn't
[17:17] know what to say so I knew that God was
[17:19] dealing with a heart and her mother was
[17:21] outside trying to listen and whatnot and
[17:23] there we led her to the Lord amen so I
[17:27] so you pray for her name is Trish that
[17:29] God will because Grant her the time that
[17:33] she be able to come to service and
[17:35] another little one that was over here
[17:36] with sister Elizabeth she was supposed
[17:38] to be baptized today but because her
[17:40] mother won't let her come and I told the
[17:42] little sister I saids isn't it strange
[17:43] your mother doesn't mind if you put on a
[17:46] minis skirt and have drugs and also go
[17:49] out with boys and also wild party she
[17:51] said that's absolutely right but she
[17:53] Rebels for you to come to this church
[17:55] can you imagine how a mother could have
[17:58] that kind of of a Insanity not to want
[18:00] her daughter to be a a handmaiden of the
[18:04] Lord so but we can pray that God will
[18:07] break that power amen so now we thank
[18:11] the Lord for these good things it's 10
[18:13] minutes to 12 I want to get straight to
[18:15] the word of the Lord and I want to ask
[18:18] you to stand with me for the reading of
[18:20] the
[18:21] word and one one other uh thing I have

[18:47] it'll be uh on the bulletin board
[18:50] downstairs let's turn to the word of the
[18:53] Lord I'm reading from um a text this
[18:57] morning I asked brother Joey to read
[18:59] that cuz that was the spoken word book
[19:01] that was the message to set a background
[19:03] this morning and I want to read now from
[19:06] Amos 3 the 3r chapter verse
[19:11] 7 surely the Lord God will do nothing
[19:16] but he revealeth his secret unto his
[19:19] servants the
[19:20] prophets Revelation
[19:23] 81 and when he had opened the seventh
[19:25] seal there was silence in heaven about
[19:28] the space of a half an hour of half an
[19:31] hour and Deuteronomy
[19:35] 2929 the secret things belong unto the
[19:39] Lord Our God but those things which are
[19:42] revealed belong unto us and to our
[19:45] children forever that we may do all the
[19:48] words of the Lord now let's catch the
[19:51] text and the subject this morning is
[19:53] laying right here in the 29th
[19:55] verse the secret things
[19:58] that God is going to reveal to us and
[20:01] also has revealed to us see belongs unto
[20:05] the Lord Our God but those things which
[20:08] are revealed the Seven Seals and all
[20:10] these things belong unto us and to our
[20:13] children forever and here's the purpose
[20:17] that we may do all the words of the law
[20:21] this law may God a blessing to reading
[20:23] of his word just uh bow our heads in a
[20:26] moment of Prayer Lord Jesus I pray this
[20:30] morning God that uh this morning as you
[20:33] took us up into Heavenly places
[20:35] Wednesday Lord God this morning may you
[20:39] uh uh relax the people this morning Lord
[20:42] and makes me a little nervous and that I
[20:46] won't feel a tenseness from them and let
[20:48] each one know like you did here
[20:50] Wednesday that nobody's going to miss
[20:52] anything Lord Jesus they can only
[20:55] understand that they think they're going
[20:56] to miss something that because I'm
[20:57] saying they can always get the tape and
[21:00] go back and study it but oh God may they
[21:03] relax so the enemy don't tense them up
[21:05] and then they will really miss it so now
[21:08] Lord Jesus uh we know uh oh God this
[21:11] morning I just feel that we could come
[21:13] to a climax this morning Lord and in
[21:17] this message here in New York City that
[21:18] we were that we have been trying to
[21:21] Proclaim by by Revelation and may there
[21:24] be one great Revelation this morning to
[21:27] Every Soul in here and may everyone know
[21:30] what has been going on here in New York
[21:32] City and may it all be to the glory of
[21:35] God lord Jesus come down now in
[21:38] fellowship with us breathe upon the word
[21:41] of the Lord and May the angels move to
[21:45] their post now God to cut off all
[21:48] unbelief and uh uh uh AC quiet my spirit
[21:51] Lord and the nervousness upon me and
[21:54] weariness dear God and I I committed
[21:57] unto thy hand hands I pray heavenly
[21:59] father and we ask it in Jesus name and
[22:01] his sake amen you may be seated i' like
[22:04] to title this message uh the mystery of
[22:07] the seventh seal I just been lingering
[22:09] just waiting cuz uh it just wasn't right
[22:12] to start you see and I know um I don't
[22:15] want to be too long with you but I do
[22:17] feel that this message on my heart that
[22:21] um that well let me put it this way on
[22:24] page one in Christ is a mystery of God
[22:27] revealed brother Bram he was praying and
[22:30] he said Lord may this message that it
[22:32] would cap it all off he's speaking about
[22:36] storing up food and he was praying that
[22:38] this particular message would be a cap
[22:41] to storing to the the food stored up
[22:44] that it would show that you're God and
[22:47] that this is your word and your truth
[22:50] and on page
[22:51] 94 as he was singing and worshiping God
[22:54] in because in the end here he says not
[22:57] knowing of of course being spiritual you
[22:59] watch spiritual things not knowing this
[23:01] God knows it but if you turn and look at
[23:03] the clock it's on the dot 2:00 the end
[23:06] of the second pull the third pull is at
[23:09] hand I know very few knew what he was
[23:12] even talking about then about the we
[23:14] thought we was in the third pole when
[23:15] the Seven Seals open up and now uh we
[23:19] read here that uh the second pool was
[23:22] ending up and later on I begin by
[23:25] Revelation to understand what he was
[23:27] talking about cuz as more messages come
[23:29] out you have to wait you see other words
[23:31] you couldn't know what he meant then
[23:33] until he had finished in 65 then you
[23:36] could know so you're not going to know
[23:39] what I'm saying until the message is
[23:40] finished amen here we go then if you
[23:43] realize that you're not going to know
[23:46] then you'll just sit back you see and
[23:48] and you'll just relax praise the Lord I
[23:51] feel I just keep saying it over and over
[23:53] again because I know that God gave such
[23:54] a wonderful Victory last Sunday and then
[23:57] I come back here here I see the same
[23:58] thing trying to move in again see I
[24:01] thought it was just finish with you know
[24:02] just sit back and relax so you're not
[24:05] going to miss nothing because I can't
[24:07] show you anything only is a revelation
[24:09] and the Hol whatever the Holy Spirit
[24:10] wants you to get this morning he'll give
[24:12] it to you if you could only settle on
[24:15] that you know just what he's going to
[24:17] get that's what you're going to get and
[24:19] be satisfied if it's just one spoonful
[24:21] this morning well take your Spoonful and
[24:24] sit back and take that you see that's it
[24:27] see me now he'll show you more later
[24:29] don't you feel him quickening that to
[24:31] you now so you're not going to miss
[24:33] anything you ain't going to lose nothing

[24:48] rest of the entire world in the
[24:51] message now please yeah you're already
[24:54] ahead they got to catch up to you hey so
[24:57] aren't you satisfied right now
[25:00] well my praise God I mean um amen now
[25:05] just relax see praise the Lord now um
[25:09] I'm I'm praying that a message this
[25:11] morning would just cap off all that I've
[25:13] tried to preach concerning the
[25:16] revelation of this message I want God to
[25:19] show it to you what he showed me Peace
[25:21] by peace over the years and I didn't
[25:23] know what I was doing he got it see he
[25:27] he show you what he he took 8 years to
[25:30] show me 10 years he'll show you in one
[25:33] message this morning that's all I'm
[25:35] praying for see and then you got it you
[25:38] see and then you'll know but you'll
[25:40] understand when you get it so you'll
[25:42] know why this is I'm going to preach it
[25:44] right to you and you're going to know
[25:45] what it is so right now amen see now
[25:49] when we went out to Tucson not knowing
[25:52] see just going feeling in the will of
[25:54] the Lord to go for a a little vacation
[25:58] and then preaching out there under great
[26:00] strain you see cuz this is
[26:04] nothing wow Amen brother it was a battle
[26:07] there see and cuz you're you got a
[26:10] background but there was no background
[26:12] whatsoever for nothing and you ask
[26:15] sister colan she'll tell you see there
[26:16] was no kind of background at all and
[26:19] that's what the strain I had to preach
[26:21] under I was getting about 3 hours sleep
[26:23] every night for for 18 days that's all
[26:27] the sleep I got and I was already tired
[26:30] you understand now and that was the
[26:31] strain see and then I just one of them
[26:35] things that's all see so now you don't
[26:38] know the strain when uh people with
[26:40] intellect trying to figure out what
[26:42] you're talking about that almost kills a
[26:44] spiritual person they're trying to catch
[26:47] your words and through the senses figure
[26:49] out what you're saying it's a revelation
[26:52] so don't touch it leave it alone amen
[26:55] see so now um so therefore with that
[26:58] thought there um and going out there and
[27:01] then um excuse me uh the message that
[27:04] was
[27:05] preached and thinking about I know the
[27:08] the middle Sunday was a rough time you
[27:10] know and then getting the the messages
[27:13] back fry and listening to them brother
[27:16] Hunt uh uh listened to them also and I
[27:20] saw what God had done and first I said
[27:24] well now how could I get these tapes to
[27:26] each person in here take 6 to S months
[27:30] and by by time each each one of you got
[27:32] those tapes it take about 6 to seven
[27:34] months and there's no kind of way you
[27:35] could even set it up so brother Hunt he
[27:38] s suggestion that could we just play him
[27:41] here so therefore um Wednesday we're
[27:45] going to play the first tape Wonder and
[27:48] after you hear this morning's message
[27:51] and the title to the first tape is but
[27:54] now I
[27:56] see so after this morning's message I
[27:59] think Wednesday all of you will see now
[28:03] there's something going on spiritual now
[28:05] see and then the next one was uh every
[28:08] place every day and I wrote something
[28:11] down here I see my brother Vincent here
[28:13] I wrote it down and left my mind but I
[28:16] got you brother happy to see him back in
[28:18] the house of the Lord after having a
[28:20] operation we happy to see brother
[28:22] Vincent back here this morning and so
[28:24] now um then the next message being um
[28:28] every place every day and that was the
[28:31] one where the enemy fought with all he
[28:33] was worth and it's one that because
[28:36] brother green had to send out because he
[28:39] uh that's his Sunday morning message
[28:40] which he sends out and that was a
[28:41] message I preached pure word the
[28:44] promises of God and they didn't know
[28:45] what I was talking about it was the
[28:47] heart straining and pushing and whatnot
[28:50] then that night I preached the who can
[28:52] but prophesy and then on that message
[28:55] there that ran into the the devil with
[28:58] all Force came at me because I mentioned
[29:00] because the intelligence the Holy Spirit
[29:03] the promise and he tried to cut off that
[29:05] promise you see and but you'll hear the
[29:08] tape when I heard it back boy the power
[29:10] of God just went right straight on
[29:12] through there I didn't even know it cuz
[29:14] when you're under that string you don't
[29:16] know what you're saying really because
[29:17] your mind goes away from you and the
[29:19] mind of the Lord moves in and before
[29:21] even went out the Lord said I'll give
[29:22] you a mouth and I'll give you wisdom and
[29:26] when I heard back each t I saw the
[29:28] wisdom of God and the wisdom of God is
[29:30] going to be is going to be a revealed to
[29:34] you this morning I said it's going to be
[29:38] every one of you going to understand it
[29:40] this morning see so I know that so
[29:42] therefore there's nothing to get tense
[29:44] and excited about amen and then the the
[29:48] last message and then uh brother Perry
[29:51] twice not understanding what I said and
[29:53] he came behind me two times trying to
[29:56] correct and make it everything are all
[29:58] right but he missed missed what I said
[30:00] so and so I said nothing and on that
[30:03] middle Sunday there in the morning and
[30:04] night and it was about the
[30:06] interpretation of the I said the lion
[30:09] roars I says and we have the trouble is
[30:12] in the message that men are trying to uh
[30:16] defend a line with their
[30:18] interpretation of the message I said
[30:20] just open up the cage and let that line
[30:22] Roar out his own interpretation
[30:25] everybody called it but brother Perry
[30:26] missed that you see so he thought I was
[30:29] saying that you don't have to defend the
[30:30] word I didn't say that I said defend the
[30:32] word with your interpretation that's all
[30:34] together different and then I was
[30:36] speaking about being numb and then an
[30:39] elder brother came and told me the
[30:42] following Saturday about the the remark
[30:45] the intelligence and Sh and types and
[30:47] shadows and when I put those four in a
[30:49] row numbness where the enemy tries to
[30:52] move with a shiver and a sensation I
[30:54] said there what's right there and the
[30:56] interpret ation of the message there it
[30:58] is right there second point and types
[31:01] and shadows which is the word see and
[31:04] then the the last one the promise for
[31:07] now the intelligence Jesus Christ the
[31:09] enemy hit those four points with a full
[31:13] blast and now you know what I was on and
[31:15] then tried to kill us and run us off the
[31:17] road Sunday even before I could bring it
[31:20] to a climax but God uh intermingled all
[31:24] things for good and then that night to
[31:28] me it was a masterpiece having all these
[31:31] books and what not trying to explain
[31:33] what I meant and brother Perry saying
[31:35] we'll be here till midnight with all
[31:36] those spoken word books and then not
[31:38] touching one of them Holy Spirit came
[31:40] back and hit those four points himself
[31:43] and said everything that I wanted to say
[31:46] I didn't even know it until after so I
[31:49] tell you it runs from the morning Unity
[31:52] of the faith to that night who can but
[31:55] prophesy and then every promise then who
[31:58] can but could prophesy but now I see
[32:00] rather and then running to the last
[32:03] message there is a river that was the
[32:05] last one and showing them that the
[32:07] intelligence is the holy spirit is here
[32:10] and so God got the Victory and realizing
[32:12] that the message was preached on those
[32:15] five
[32:16] tapes everything that's been preached
[32:18] here for 10 years was preaching five
[32:21] tapes that's what I'm trying to explain
[32:23] to you this morning so I'm praising God
[32:25] for that it wasn't me it was Jesus
[32:28] Christ now we are reading here now
[32:31] um we are uh speaking as to uh mature
[32:35] people that can receive the word by
[32:38] spiritual
[32:39] Revelation now uh this
[32:43] mystery which we were predestinated to
[32:46] the adoption of sons and
[32:47] daughters so let me read here from page
[32:50] 17 I'm just going to take my time
[32:53] because uh took about 10 years to get to
[32:55] this spot so will take my time this
[32:58] morning amen praise God and so now um if
[33:03] you want to mark down these Pages where
[33:05] now I can't I cannot preach this tape
[33:07] it's impossible you know that so I can
[33:10] only sat down this morning it was very
[33:11] hard to put this together cuz I had to
[33:13] sit and wait for the Holy Spirit to go
[33:15] over all these pages and put a message
[33:18] out and take what he was saying here and
[33:21] then last
[33:22] night uh because the Holy Spirit showed
[33:24] me a lot of things what brother Bram had
[33:27] said here and I want to bring it out to
[33:30] you this morning now um I want to read
[33:33] from page 17 now God had a purpose and a
[33:37] hidden Mystery and that's what I want to
[33:39] speak on to the church this morning now
[33:41] I'm teaching this morning and I might
[33:44] get some start eating some big grapes
[33:46] amen so therefore don't pay me no mind
[33:49] see when I get the inspiration strikes
[33:51] me but you got to teach it so you can
[33:53] get it and that's what I want to speak
[33:55] on to this church this morning the the
[33:57] hidden Mystery of God that he had in his
[34:00] mind before the world ever began and how
[34:02] that it's unfolded itself right down to
[34:04] this present hour that we're living see
[34:07] and then you will understand clearly
[34:09] then see on I believe what is being done
[34:13] now watch God's great mystery of how is
[34:15] a secret he kept it a secret nobody know
[34:20] nothing about it even the angels didn't
[34:22] understand it see he didn't reveal it
[34:25] excuse me that's the reason under our
[34:28] seventh
[34:29] mystery when the seventh seal was open
[34:32] there was
[34:33] silence Jesus when he was on Earth they
[34:37] wanted to know when he would come he
[34:39] said it's not even the son himself don't
[34:42] know when it's going to happen see God
[34:44] has this all to himself it's a secret
[34:47] and that's the reason there was silence
[34:49] in heaven for a space of a half an hour
[34:52] and seven Thunders uttered their voices
[34:54] and John was even forbidden to write it
[34:57] the coming of the Lord that's one thing
[34:59] he hasn't revealed yet this is in 63 now
[35:02] of how he will come and when he will
[35:04] come it's a good thing that he doesn't
[35:06] no he has showed or revealed that it in
[35:08] every type that's in the Bible now here
[35:11] we go here this right here now this is
[35:13] what the Holy Spirit showed me I was
[35:16] rejoicing here therefore the entire
[35:20] Bible is the revelation of God's mystery
[35:23] in Christ see now now here it is now
[35:27] just the point the holy spirit will
[35:28] strike to you sitting
[35:30] here the entire Bible is an expression
[35:34] of one goal that God had one purpose he
[35:38] wanted to achieve in the entire Bible
[35:43] now here it is and all the acts of the
[35:46] Believers in the Bible has been en tyed
[35:50] and expressing what God's Great goal is
[35:54] and now in this last day he has revealed
[35:56] heeld it and CH us and God's help we'll
[35:59] see it right here this morning what the
[36:01] Lord has had in his mind all along and
[36:04] has expressed it therefore you can see
[36:07] the great meaning of what has been to
[36:09] know this he speaking about his own self
[36:11] and then try to bring it to the people
[36:13] see that's like me this morning amen and
[36:17] then you don't cuz you haven't went into
[36:19] details and tried to explain as God has
[36:21] revealed it to me now he's saying here
[36:26] I'm coming back up this quote just we're
[36:28] teaching and everything everybody
[36:30] settled down the entire Bible I'm just
[36:33] now the holy spirit's coming back and
[36:35] striking the different points that he
[36:36] showed me this morning the the entire
[36:39] Bible is the revelation of God's mystery
[36:43] in Christ every word of it the entire
[36:46] Bible the entire Bible is an expression
[36:49] of one goal that God has had one purpose
[36:54] he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible
[36:58] and all the acts of the Believers in the
[37:00] Bible has been in type and expressing
[37:04] what God's goal is and when I got that
[37:07] one I says my one goal one purpose Jesus
[37:12] said search the scriptures the
[37:15] scriptures they testify of me then then
[37:19] Herod is right here testifying oh I know
[37:22] you're getting it everyone from Abel
[37:25] amen all the way down to John were
[37:27] testifying of Jesus
[37:30] Christ praise God Christ is a principal
[37:34] theme of the entire Bible St Luke 24
[37:39] wrote to emus the 6-hour sermon when he
[37:43] had when he come back in the
[37:45] resurrection and they not knowing the
[37:48] scriptures they testify of him they said
[37:51] what he would do and how he would do it
[37:53] and Christ comes back around and his old
[37:56] fools and slow of heart Amen Let me uh
[38:00] read the scripture here if as long as
[38:02] you got time I don't have to rush do you
[38:04] mind stay here to
[38:06] 5:00 wonderful a now let's
[38:10] go praise the Lord I feel felt Shackled
[38:13] you know now if you get hungry and you
[38:15] have to go it's all right you just get
[38:17] up and leave that's all right you can
[38:18] pick up the tape after but if I know I
[38:20] not being rushed then it' be all right
[38:23] see so now um St Luke 24 uh 24 um and
[38:30] then uh then he said unto them oh fools
[38:33] and slow of heart to believe to believe
[38:37] see all that the prophets have spoken
[38:39] ought not Christ to have suffered these
[38:42] things and to enter into his glory and
[38:45] here it is beginning at Moses which is
[38:47] Genesis you understand and all the
[38:50] prophets he expounded unto them in all
[38:53] the scriptures the things concerning
[38:55] himself amen himself amen then he is the
[38:59] principal theme of the entire Bible amen
[39:04] there he is then he he come back in St
[39:07] Luke
[39:08] 24:45 and after he came in the room and
[39:12] showed himself then he opened their
[39:15] understanding to all of the scriptures
[39:18] to the principal theme of the entire Old
[39:20] Testament he opened their understanding
[39:24] to himself in every point
[39:27] other words he was in Moses he was in
[39:28] Abraham Isaac and Jacob and all Gideon
[39:31] and Barack and he was that was him and
[39:35] then when brother Brown was speaking
[39:37] here and I saw what he was talking about
[39:40] amen the word this word is the
[39:42] revelation of Jesus Christ if you want
[39:45] to know the secret of what brother Bram
[39:47] was talking about read the word there's
[39:49] the secret amen Christ being revealed in
[39:53] his word through these little people who
[39:55] didn't know what they were
[39:58] doing they were just living like you are
[40:01] every day they didn't know they didn't
[40:03] have no Revelation as to what they were
[40:05] doing but without knowing it they were
[40:08] typing out Jesus Christ in their
[40:11] day that's what the Holy Spirit struck
[40:14] me with last night oh you get it now
[40:18] everybody got it and then the
[40:20] inspiration coming I said my that's what
[40:24] brother BR was talking about it's the
[40:26] word it's not going to this place and
[40:29] that place it is the word of God from
[40:32] Abel all Adam all the way through think
[40:34] of it those women and those men in
[40:36] Hebrews 11 that's Christ that was the
[40:39] spirit of the Living God and them people
[40:42] moving them and making them take the
[40:44] word against everything he lived in
[40:46] caves and dens they was s of Thunder
[40:49] beaten in everything else what was it it
[40:52] was the word those women like Sarah them

[41:01] God with the hair hanging down all
[41:03] straggling and all because corns on
[41:05] their hands were working hey those were
[41:07] Daughters of God that was the word the
[41:10] spirit of Christ in those women in those
[41:13] men but they didn't know it they didn't
[41:17] have the Holy
[41:18] Ghost praise God amen amen but they was
[41:22] doing what comes naturally they were
[41:25] children of God they love the word they
[41:27] put it on the ears and the head and
[41:30] everywhere that's all it
[41:32] is there's your secret under the seventh
[41:35] seal the sword the word coming to a

[43:26] pulsating Spirit of Christ amen in all
[43:31] of us something pulsating yes amen you

[43:36] here amen I didn't know what I was doing
[43:38] no more than what you knew I didn't know
[43:39] what this secret was but I know one
[43:41] thing the word came and had come yeah
[43:44] now I know what was going on I'm looking
[43:47] back amen praise God Christ is the theme
[43:52] the entire Bible my praise praise the
[43:56] Lord God now this great
[43:59] mystery as he spoke as you read this
[44:01] morning here so I'm I got a lot of notes
[44:03] but letting the Holy Spirit lead amen
[44:05] even the mystery which have been hidden
[44:07] from ages and from Generations but now
[44:10] is being made manifest to his Saints to
[44:13] whom God would make known what is the
[44:16] riches of the glory of this mystery
[44:17] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[44:21] you the hope of glory my now you going
[44:25] to know who come into you in the form of
[44:27] seven Thunders to live the word we're
[44:31] going to get into it now amen so now the
[44:35] threefold purpose of God and brother
[44:37] Bram saying here now um notice now God
[44:41] has had a threefold purpose here's a
[44:43] mystery here now in this in this great
[44:46] mystery secret God in this great mystery
[44:49] secret that he had before the world
[44:50] began he's got a threefold purpose in it
[44:54] and now what we want to go on upon this
[44:56] morning is what is that three-fold
[44:59] purpose see now I Believe by the help of
[45:02] God he's present and he'll show it to us
[45:04] now if he had this threefold purpose we
[45:06] want to find out what is this threefold
[45:08] purpose the first thing that was that
[45:11] God wanted to reveal himself to the
[45:13] people amen he couldn't do it as a great
[45:16] Jehovah God who who covered all Space
[45:18] and Time and Eternity he could not he's
[45:20] too great to be revealed to people
[45:23] excuse me and he speaks about fatherhood
[45:25] and so forth now he wanted to express
[45:27] himself that was one of his three that
[45:30] was one of his great three-fold purposes
[45:32] was to express himself this is number
[45:35] one identify himself with human beings
[45:37] to reveal himself in Christ that's
[45:40] number one second to have the
[45:44] preeminence in his body of Believers
[45:47] that is his bride that he might live in
[45:50] his people and get them back cuz as they
[45:53] was lost like like Adam and Eve amen and
[45:55] and the only way to get him back now if
[45:59] doubt took the entire race
[46:03] away how can doubt how can you get back
[46:06] by
[46:07] doubt I don't understand
[46:09] it how can you come back to God with
[46:12] doubting unbelief that's why brother
[46:14] Brown preached the way he preached it's
[46:15] impossible to come back by doubting
[46:18] unbelief in the word when that was the
[46:20] very thing that because they had lost
[46:22] their salvation through doubting one
[46:24] word how where you going to get by
[46:26] doubting one word it's impossible amen
[46:29] see and um brother B goes on saying here
[46:33] God's Great purpose revealing himself in
[46:35] heaven first to to reveal himself in
[46:37] Christ the fullness of the godhead body
[46:39] then bring that fullness of godhead Bly
[46:42] into a people that he could have the
[46:55] om to his rightly position that fell by
[46:58] sin by the first Adam my God moving
[47:04] through able to have the
[47:06] preeminence amen God moving through
[47:10] every son Before the Flood to have the
[47:13] preeminence moving through Abraham and
[47:15] Isaac and Jacob and uh Joseph and Moses
[47:19] and all through them and the prophets to
[47:22] have the preeminence amen just so Christ
[47:26] could get out amen and then those people
[47:30] acting normally and naturally cuz they
[47:33] were part of the word in their
[47:35] generation and they were just doing what
[47:37] comes naturally that's why brother Bram
[47:40] said if you have the spirit of bethoven
[47:42] because bethoven then you do what he did
[47:47] amen praise the Lord if you have the
[47:50] spirit of Christ you do what he did if
[47:52] you're a seed of God you do what they
[47:54] did here in the Bible which is our types
[47:56] and shadows it's natural it's not no a
[47:59] chomping down and trying to make you see
[48:02] it no it's is a
[48:04] revelation upon the rock of this
[48:07] Revelation I'll build my church as to
[48:09] who what as to who Christ
[48:12] is the word amen and the word is the
[48:15] revelation of Jesus
[48:17] Christ now he so there there was now
[48:21] there's his great mystery that's how he
[48:23] got Christ into the people through the
[48:25] word amen that's his great three-fold
[48:28] purpose to get Christ the word into you
[48:32] the hope of glory amen see get the
[48:35] people to Christ not to the church and I
[48:39] want to lay something down here page 64

[48:45] struck me last
[48:47] night make it his mystery to known to
[48:50] his bride his bride tree the Redeemed by
[48:52] Christ going back home to be restored

[48:57] the wrong conception to convert people
[49:00] to to Christianity and to its
[49:04] government government is not God's
[49:06] thought at all you say or we make a
[49:09] converts to Christianity by its
[49:11] government that's not it well they
[49:13] they're not supposed to drink and
[49:14] they're not supposed to lie he's
[49:16] speaking about the muhammadans and also
[49:18] Africa and African tribes the Shi they
[49:22] put us to shame what he said now notice
[49:26] god making himself known we're not
[49:28] supposed to make converts to
[49:30] Christianity by a government Jesus said

[1:10:23] Revel
[1:10:24] of Jesus Christ the entire Bible my
[1:10:28] heart God put it over on the devil and

[1:10:41] I know what I've been doing for 10
[1:10:44] years what a faith came into me
[1:10:46] yesterday when I knew what I was doing
[1:10:50] and all the
[1:10:51] time against the word word and all the
[1:10:54] time it was God trying to get the
[1:10:56] preeminence in New York City that's all
[1:10:59] he was trying to do get the preeminence
[1:11:02] in our lives to manifest the word to get
[1:11:06] the promises to us praise God see how
[1:11:10] God's great three-fold mystery because
[1:11:12] his great purpose rather the mystery
[1:11:15] hidden which is Christ in you the hope
[1:11:17] of glory it ties right into the Seven
[1:11:19] Seals the mysteries of them the mystery
[1:11:22] of this entire Bible how God wanted to
[1:11:25] have the preeminence in all of because
[1:11:28] of his people in the in the Old
[1:11:30] Testament here then it it come right out
[1:11:33] here on the day of Pentecost and went
[1:11:35] into seven Church ages and sealed with
[1:11:37] Seven Seals and the prophet of God comes
[1:11:40] along and and he reveals the Mysteries
[1:11:43] under each seal the seal itself broke
[1:11:46] then if the prophet was to reveal the
[1:11:49] entire Bible the mystery of this Bible
[1:11:51] here being Christ
[1:11:54] on this message capped off the second
[1:11:58] poll you got it he Reve on this tape
[1:12:01] right here he he said let me cap it off
[1:12:05] to show it's the word and he capped it
[1:12:08] off and show it this Bible even this
[1:12:11] mystery which was hid amen it is the
[1:12:15] mystery of it is Christ in you the hope
[1:12:17] of
[1:12:18] glory so he revealed The Mystery of the
[1:12:21] Bible then went on and into seven seal
[1:12:25] Mysteries amen because he first he had
[1:12:27] the six seal mystery and then he
[1:12:29] revealed this then he went waiting for
[1:12:32] that seventh seal mystery The Mystery of
[1:12:36] the seal then we found out that the
[1:12:39] mystery under uh this entire Bible was
[1:12:43] Christ and the Mystery under those six
[1:12:46] seals was Christ redeeming his people
[1:12:50] amen and the word living in them then
[1:12:53] what is is the mystery under the seven
[1:12:57] seal you got the answer Christ coming
[1:13:00] down present tense day by day and
[1:13:04] redeeming us every
[1:13:06] day by the word to make sure other words
[1:13:10] suppose the M age moved in and all we
[1:13:14] had was those gifts and we were still
[1:13:16] Pentecostal babies everyone would be in
[1:13:18] the insane institution and you know it
[1:13:21] cuz you would know what to do but he
[1:13:23] came down
[1:13:24] himself as the word and reveal himself
[1:13:28] as the word to take us
[1:13:30] through and all we had to do was just
[1:13:32] because just read the word also hear the
[1:13:34] tapes and Obey it then he would be
[1:13:37] getting the preeminence in us and that
[1:13:42] preeminence itself on the Earth would
[1:13:44] show that you saw your name in the
[1:13:46] Lamb's Book of
[1:13:48] Life because you walk in the Earth as a
[1:13:52] predestinated word of God on the earth
[1:13:55] your
[1:13:55] actions typing out Jesus Christ the word
[1:13:59] of God wise love your husband I mean
[1:14:01] husband love your wives and so forth and
[1:14:04] love one another right here on the earth
[1:14:07] doing that and that's all he asked for
[1:14:10] that's all see now it's the mystery of
[1:14:13] it see so now we see then that um the
[1:14:17] Old Testament Christ getting the the
[1:14:19] preeminence each type expressing Jesus
[1:14:22] Christ exactly
[1:14:23] yet never given his secret in full
[1:14:26] waiting for it to be made known in the
[1:14:28] last days waiting for it to be fully
[1:14:31] comprehended amen see search the
[1:14:34] scriptures they testify of me they tell
[1:14:36] you what I am see now then comes the
[1:14:39] mystery praise God the mystery of the
[1:14:43] seventh seal then if God has always uh
[1:14:48] broken a seal and revealed a revelation
[1:14:52] under that seal
[1:14:53] and those and those people serve God
[1:14:55] under each seal and because when they
[1:14:58] die he seals them away a a temporary
[1:15:02] judgment Falls up on the earth and then
[1:15:04] he drops a another Revelation a
[1:15:06] messenger Goes Forth and also calls out
[1:15:09] God's people a temporary judgment Falls
[1:15:12] and those people are sealed away all the
[1:15:14] way down never yet fully revealing his
[1:15:19] secret but in the last days making it
[1:15:22] known to William brandom to what he was
[1:15:25] doing all the time and then brother Bram
[1:15:27] telling us that he that seventh seal
[1:15:30] open but it's a total secret it's the
[1:15:34] end times a seal and when it goes forth
[1:15:37] it's connected with seven Thunders to
[1:15:39] the coming of the Lord how he comes and
[1:15:42] when he comes and we know that he has
[1:15:45] already
[1:15:47] come well then how do we know well how
[1:15:50] did he come he himself set on the seven
[1:15:52] seal I won't even get it now because you
[1:15:54] know what it is he said the sword in
[1:15:56] sainia Canyon see bring on his holy
[1:16:00] vesture it's the word he said see the
[1:16:04] secret the word see the mystery the word

[1:16:10] off of that tape you remember that there
[1:16:13] it's in that portion right there it's
[1:16:15] the word then the word then the seven
[1:16:18] Thunder mystery would bring back The
[1:16:21] Headstone is that right
[1:16:23] then The Headstone has come back in the
[1:16:25] form of a a
[1:16:27] shout and he's here all the time he's
[1:16:30] here this
[1:16:31] morning in the form of a message but he

[1:17:07] anything about it they cannot know
[1:17:10] nothing about it it's impossible for
[1:17:11] them to know anything about it here it
[1:17:14] is God has hid the senses of
[1:17:19] knowing God has hid the senses of of
[1:17:23] knowing it from the very elected
[1:17:26] teachers and everything else it's a
[1:17:29] personal all the little illiterate ones
[1:17:33] Oh my he loves

[1:17:50] so sit back and relax you will never
[1:17:54] know it straining and straining and
[1:17:56] straining it's a
[1:17:58] revelation sit back and let God crack
[1:18:01] you in the forehead and then you got it
[1:18:04] I hope this morning you finally got it
[1:18:06] let me read it again now God has hid the
[1:18:10] sensus of knowing it from the very
[1:18:13] elected teachers and everything else
[1:18:15] it's a personal individual affair with
[1:18:18] the person that Christ has revealed to
[1:18:21] them amen
[1:18:23] there you are there's your church two or
[1:18:26] three of those gather he's in the midst
[1:18:29] there he is oh praise God and if you say
[1:18:33] he has been revealed to me then the life
[1:18:36] that Christ produced here in the Bible
[1:18:38] all the way through now amen types and
[1:18:42] so forth you know like that all the way
[1:18:43] through is a life following the word of
[1:18:45] God not dos and don't also Church
[1:18:47] government that forget about that
[1:18:49] talking about life amen then the life
[1:18:52] that Christ has produced here in the
[1:18:54] Bible that same life is in him does not
[1:18:57] produce itself in you then you got the
[1:18:59] wrong
[1:19:01] Revelation amen see now here it is God
[1:19:05] is known by Simplicity and a revelation
[1:19:09] of Jesus
[1:19:11] Christ excuse me in the most illiterate
[1:19:16] person let that one sink
[1:19:18] now God is known by simplicity and of
[1:19:24] Revelation in the most illiterate person
[1:19:28] now you know what kind of ministers he
[1:19:29] got in the last
[1:19:32] days and you ran after those
[1:19:35] teachers see not your theology it's a
[1:19:38] revelation of Jesus Christ Upon This
[1:19:40] Rock I'll build my church this is page
[1:19:42] 45 here no other rocks Revelations
[1:19:46] except it no other things accept it no
[1:19:49] other Roman Rock no other Protestant
[1:19:51] Rock no other school no other nothing
[1:19:54] but on exactly the revelation of Jesus
[1:19:57] Christ in a new birth he is born in
[1:19:59] there and injects his own life and your
[1:20:02] life is gone and the life of Christ is
[1:20:05] is is projecting itself through you with
[1:20:09] the
[1:20:12] [Applause]
[1:20:22] at
[1:20:24] all my now you see why we need those
[1:20:29] Dynamics amen
[1:20:31] see Watch God's Great Revelation
[1:20:35] unfolding now here it is but by lack of
[1:20:39] this Revelation is why we have so many
[1:20:42] different divisions among us and so much
[1:20:46] mockery so much division Among Us is
[1:20:49] because the people lack that Revelation
[1:20:51] see they lack that Revelation the
[1:20:53] teachers he
[1:20:55] said there you are see so
[1:20:59] now my think on it now the most
[1:21:04] illiterate person is not who you think

[1:23:26] Headstone the sword the word and
[1:23:29] releases The Headstone and God takes him
[1:23:32] away and then The Headstone is himself

[1:27:15] amen should not he also revealed the
[1:27:17] seventh seal and the word is the
[1:27:19] revelation of Jesus Christ then the
[1:27:22] third pull was the opening of the word
[1:27:24] the word to open up to come into our
[1:27:26] hearts now he has revealed God's hidden
[1:27:30] Mystery the three-fold purpose then he
[1:27:32] then he reveals the Seven Seals and
[1:27:35] Christ is the mystery of the seventh
[1:27:37] seal the sword the word there'll be no
[1:27:41] mimics to this no
[1:27:44] impersonations amen now number seven is
[1:27:46] complete finished number eth is a a new
[1:27:50] order of things now
[1:27:53] on the Statue of a perfect man in 2
[1:27:55] Peter 1 5-7 the bride under the seventh
[1:27:59] seal mystery like all the others under
[1:28:02] the six seals and all the Bible types in
[1:28:07] obedience expressing Christ by becoming
[1:28:11] part of the word in
[1:28:13] obedience this morning and letting
[1:28:16] Christ get deeper Eminence in her life
[1:28:20] like all the rest of the seals
[1:28:22] by her identifying herself with every
[1:28:25] word making herself
[1:28:30] weak perfect weakness he's bringing it
[1:28:33] on through the word amen and when we get
[1:28:37] perfectly weak then he's able to bring
[1:28:40] his perfect
[1:28:41] strength amen now in this very a
[1:28:46] deceiving age now Satan can impersonate
[1:28:50] Seven Virtues
[1:28:52] we driving at home now took a long time
[1:28:55] getting here he can impersonate Seven
[1:28:58] Virtues Satan can impersonate any gift
[1:29:01] the prophet told us he can also
[1:29:04] impersonate
[1:29:06] Faith that's right he can also because
[1:29:09] impersonate virtue Temperance godliness
[1:29:15] knowledge oh yeah maybe you don't
[1:29:18] believe me huh I'll read it to
[1:29:20] you we got it right here in the word
[1:29:23] praise God let me
[1:29:26] see
[1:29:29] [Applause]
[1:29:31] amen 20 yeah yeah this is Blasphemous
[1:29:35] names the the
[1:29:38] Tabernacle now you say brother Brandon
[1:29:40] did should we speak with tongues
[1:29:42] absolutely that's gifts of God but those
[1:29:44] gifts of God without these virtues in
[1:29:46] them makes a stumble block to the
[1:29:48] unbeliever it's not accepted by God this
[1:29:51] has to be first and and when you have
[1:29:52] faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:29:54] patience godliness and brotherly love
[1:29:56] then the Holy Ghost comes down and seals
[1:29:58] you as a unit as the same as he seals
[1:30:01] the church age as a unit the way he
[1:30:03] makes his bride is the way he makes his
[1:30:04] his individual made out of the same
[1:30:06] material like Eve was made out of Adam a
[1:30:09] rib from the side here is the things
[1:30:11] that you have to have first you can't
[1:30:13] impersonate them you can't imitate them
[1:30:16] they've got to be God sent and God born
[1:30:19] imitation only causes confusion
[1:30:22] and he speaks about a buzz and also a
[1:30:24] black bird you see now now get this
[1:30:27] lesson here is what's wrong with the
[1:30:32] Tabernacle I ought to turn it on for
[1:30:35] this here's what's wrong with the Bram
[1:30:36] Tabernacle you see there is two
[1:30:39] different kinds of Faith two different
[1:30:41] kinds of virtue are you following me now
[1:30:44] as I had the other day two different
[1:30:46] kinds of knowledge two different kinds
[1:30:49] of of temperance one thinks is
[1:30:51] prohibition and they ain't got that kind
[1:30:53] of temperance because God's talking
[1:30:54] about it's that ungodly uncontrollable
[1:30:56] temper that you got in things of that
[1:30:59] type flashback and fuss patience and so
[1:31:03] forth there's a mockery of it a
[1:31:05] pretending to be a nature giving Faith a
[1:31:11] nature giv virtue there's a nature given
[1:31:14] Temperance and all these things are
[1:31:17] nature
[1:31:19] given is the point made amen now don't
[1:31:22] get quiet on me now amen no please don't
[1:31:25] do that now no don't don't freeze up now
[1:31:29] see so now uh we uh we are head to
[1:31:33] maturity amen amen I'm trying to show
[1:31:36] you how the devil can deceive you see
[1:31:39] now here we are see now the bride in
[1:31:42] obedience expressing Christ by becoming
[1:31:45] part of the word in obedience now the
[1:31:48] devil can impersonate we just found out
[1:31:51] s Seven Virtues now you know where I'm
[1:31:53] going yes number eight is a new
[1:31:57] order he can impersonate every gift he
[1:32:01] can impersonate Seven Virtues these are
[1:32:04] human virtues the Christian Scientist
[1:32:07] will outs Smothers on these
[1:32:09] virtues and you know that and and
[1:32:11] brother B he's told us that a Christian
[1:32:14] Science amen you see a light glowing
[1:32:17] around them because went as a mailman
[1:32:20] once I went into a Christian sence
[1:32:22] Church everybody was bright looking just
[1:32:25] sweet and everything with th with with
[1:32:27] these human virtues in there by their
[1:32:29] mind by the thought over other words
[1:32:33] thought over the matter they just
[1:32:35] overpower it with the human Minds that
[1:32:38] can be done those a nature given and you
[1:32:42] see people who are sweet de kind old
[1:32:45] priests in the Bible sweet Temperance
[1:32:49] never fuss and get mad and knowledge of
[1:32:53] God stand up to him without the mind of
[1:32:56] Christ see what happens to
[1:32:58] you you just stand up to their knowledge
[1:33:01] and their
[1:33:02] patience and their virtue we getting it
[1:33:06] now amen so he can impersonate those
[1:33:11] things but charity never
[1:33:15] faileth so God Amen Let The Devil come
[1:33:20] into the Third
[1:33:22] and HD it and didn't say what it was
[1:33:25] just a
[1:33:26] word amen and in those that's catching
[1:33:29] the word they got it and then they don't
[1:33:33] know what it's all about but like the
[1:33:34] old types in the old Bible they acted it
[1:33:37] out under silence sh silence silence the
[1:33:42] devil might get a hold of it he can
[1:33:43] impersonate it so therefore brother BR
[1:33:46] said there's a great secret lays on here
[1:33:47] the sword the word amen and and so
[1:33:52] simple is coming to you this morning
[1:33:55] wait till it goes out and around the
[1:33:57] world is going to bust up and blast up
[1:34:00] all kind of men's opinions and he will
[1:34:02] vindicate it on the spot amen Christ the
[1:34:06] third pull speaking out behind it but
[1:34:08] youve had it for 10
[1:34:10] years thank you
[1:34:12] Lord my we have had it for 10
[1:34:17] years what wasn't an action not knowing
[1:34:19] what it was doing but preaching it by
[1:34:22] Revelation what Perfection Perfection
[1:34:25] Perfection just pulsating I must have
[1:34:28] the prance in New York City I didn't
[1:34:30] spoke it in 52 through my Prophet
[1:34:32] there's something about New York
[1:34:35] City and I got to have the pr in New
[1:34:37] York City cuz I'm going to do something
[1:34:39] in New York City I'm going to fill some
[1:34:41] people with the power of almighty God
[1:34:43] they're going to shake New York City and
[1:34:45] turn upside down and it won't be through
[1:34:47] their Seven Virtues it'll be through
[1:34:50] charity charity never
[1:34:53] faileth praise
[1:34:56] God Satan under the seventh
[1:35:00] seal coming to Eve you know that is this
[1:35:05] it's that and while it was spoken to Eve
[1:35:08] I'm going to multiply and replenish God
[1:35:12] never revealed it it was the word and
[1:35:16] under the seventh seal he says he's
[1:35:18] going to multiply the bride like it was
[1:35:19] on the de on the day P cost and
[1:35:22] replenish her and never revealed it amen
[1:35:26] but it was a spoken word and long as she
[1:35:28] didn't tamper with that promise it was
[1:35:30] an oncoming thing and in the season of
[1:35:35] the Dynamics God was going to bring it
[1:35:38] to pass and in our season of the
[1:35:41] Dynamics this message here is C it off
[1:35:45] the hours upon
[1:35:47] us for the Dynamics to strike it and
[1:35:50] bring death oncoming promise to pass
[1:35:53] amen but Eve got sticky and reached for
[1:35:57] some
[1:35:58] wisdom and he impersonated the knowledge
[1:36:01] of God to her and she ate off the wrong
[1:36:05] tree
[1:36:06] amen and so therefore under the seven
[1:36:09] seal many Eaves concubines false
[1:36:13] anointed went forth
[1:36:15] impersonating they they brother BR said
[1:36:17] that they couldn't mimic it they
[1:36:18] couldn't even know it because they now
[1:36:22] now here it is these men are not the
[1:36:26] elected ones there's no faith seed there
[1:36:30] therefore they can only use their five
[1:36:32] human senses how can they know
[1:36:36] it the
[1:36:38] teachers how can they know it and then
[1:36:42] the concubines that ran after
[1:36:45] absolum and the sight up on the roof of
[1:36:47] all Israel while David was in rejection
[1:36:50] the word
[1:36:52] what happens to them they were wasted
[1:36:55] used up you understand but the bride
[1:36:59] went with David in rejection his wife
[1:37:02] she's humble now bearing a reproach for
[1:37:05] his
[1:37:06] name blessed be the name of the Lord for
[1:37:09] the what's his name we found the other
[1:37:11] day his person his nature his
[1:37:13] personality him who's that the word the
[1:37:18] sword I don't know what else to tell you
[1:37:20] brother pray is God God reveal it to you
[1:37:23] it's the word of God Amen however it's a
[1:37:26] revelation He Goes Forth on the with the
[1:37:29] intellectual conception of the word
[1:37:30] Goliath got them pinned
[1:37:32] down amen we went out to battle Sunday
[1:37:36] morning and slay them and hit him in the
[1:37:39] head with the rock of the Salvation
[1:37:41] stone that Christ is present test right
[1:37:46] now redeeming
[1:37:48] you Revelation upon Revelation that is
[1:37:50] your present tense Redemption am it's
[1:37:53] going on this morning that's why don't
[1:37:55] jump ahead just take it one at a time
[1:37:58] thank you Heavenly Father for let this
[1:37:59] little seed just now thank you Lord
[1:38:01] he'll pile more up on top of it but
[1:38:03] don't get ahead of me don't try to
[1:38:05] figure out do I have those seven natural
[1:38:08] virtue I caught it all over the place I
[1:38:11] know the devil told you that's
[1:38:13] me my that's not you I I was only
[1:38:17] bringing out to you how he has ruined
[1:38:19] the church that's what what what the
[1:38:22] holy spirit is bringing out to you this
[1:38:25] morning that's all he's doing so if you
[1:38:27] can't stand a revelation and you fall
[1:38:29] down how you going to take the full
[1:38:31] blast of the word under the Dynamics
[1:38:33] well you melt if you can't take this
[1:38:36] little Revelation here
[1:38:38] amen now I don't know what but how you
[1:38:41] going take the word be impossible to
[1:38:43] take the word see now it's a a
[1:38:45] revelation he almost deceives a very
[1:38:47] elected under The Greening period that's
[1:38:51] the only time he could work with the sea
[1:38:53] when it's green he can't work when it's
[1:38:56] a mature gold because golden brown cuz
[1:38:59] the Dynamics is there with it amen see
[1:39:03] so by Revelation the bride catches the
[1:39:07] the revelation of the seven seal and all
[1:39:10] she ever gets that I should I should do
[1:39:12] thus and so in the word so she does it
[1:39:15] she don't understand anything else she
[1:39:16] don't run here and go there and go over
[1:39:18] there she just tries to Faithfully stay
[1:39:20] where she at her post and do the word
[1:39:23] and then she keeps getting this and God
[1:39:24] blesses her in the word and she's happy
[1:39:27] she having a love affair and he's given
[1:39:28] her
[1:39:29] Secrets Revelation a top of Revelation
[1:39:33] and not knowing exactly what she's doing
[1:39:35] but she loves the she loves the word not
[1:39:38] a church government Satan he can
[1:39:40] impersonate that see but he cannot
[1:39:43] impersonate Divine
[1:39:45] love amen he can come all the way
[1:39:47] through those Seven
[1:39:49] Virtues now under the silence period he
[1:39:51] said he might give away the secret and
[1:39:54] he didn't want to give away the secret
[1:39:55] see so now we got two different kinds of
[1:39:58] Virtues and and one faith is under same
[1:40:01] Matthew 24:24 a religious spirit and to
[1:40:05] that is added six virtues man what
[1:40:08] because number six are what we can do
[1:40:11] and under this one they'll speak in
[1:40:12] tongu shout and preach and do everything
[1:40:14] else in the message amen there's another
[1:40:18] one coming right alongside of it the Bri
[1:40:22] amen they're coming along together right
[1:40:25] here coming along together one is based
[1:40:28] on acts 238 Faith see now humanly
[1:40:31] speaking we're adding six virtues during
[1:40:33] this Greening period And there's Loose
[1:40:36] Ends everywhere all over the message see
[1:40:38] and the impersonators don't know where
[1:40:41] they going at therefore they have to
[1:40:43] watch it to figure out what you're going
[1:40:44] to say and what you going to do then
[1:40:45] they try to do
[1:40:47] that because my own wife sitting right
[1:40:49] here at this funeral service saw this
[1:40:52] poor sister writing down what this man
[1:40:54] said a wife should do writing it down
[1:40:57] when it should be in
[1:40:59] here she was writing it down she saw
[1:41:02] that out there you see now they take all
[1:41:05] these strange odd things now Christ is
[1:41:07] the mystery of God revealed is hid from
[1:41:10] the senses of knowing and from the very
[1:41:13] elected
[1:41:14] teachers can you imagine that God hid it
[1:41:18] from the very elected teachers
[1:41:21] so that you wouldn't run after
[1:41:24] them amen see they wouldn't run after
[1:41:28] those teachers he sent them out he says
[1:41:30] go you false anointed ones go ahead I'm
[1:41:34] going wait but you won't touch my bride
[1:41:36] she's having a love of fear with me she
[1:41:37] loves me she that little second cousin I
[1:41:40] can hear the old Buck board coming down
[1:41:42] the road she's lived true and a cousins
[1:41:45] left turned as shame she said but he
[1:41:48] promised amen praise God up here on
[1:41:53] Mount Camelback I was up there praying
[1:41:56] last August and the Holy Spirit spoke in
[1:41:58] my heart and I was thinking about what
[1:41:59] would happen after and he gave me a
[1:42:02] scripture for the Church of God I put it
[1:42:05] that way 1 Corinthians 26 uh because
[1:42:10] 1-8 and then I would I said well that I
[1:42:13] I know what that is and uh I thought
[1:42:15] about it and that's uh the scripture
[1:42:17] here 1 Corinthians 2 1-8 because I just
[1:42:20] read could read it to you spoke to uh to
[1:42:23] Sister Coman about it and Brethren when
[1:42:25] I come to you came not with easy of
[1:42:27] speech or wisdom declar to you the
[1:42:29] testimony of God for I determin not to
[1:42:32] know anything among you save Jesus
[1:42:33] Christ and him crucified and I was with
[1:42:35] you in weakness and in fear and in much
[1:42:38] trembling and my speech and my my
[1:42:40] preaching was not with enticing words of
[1:42:42] man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the
[1:42:45] spirit and power that your faith should
[1:42:49] not stand in the wisdom of men
[1:42:51] but in the power of God how be it we
[1:42:54] speak wisdom among them that are perfect
[1:42:56] yet not the wisdom of this world nor the
[1:42:58] prin of this world that that come to
[1:43:00] knowth but we speak the wisdom of God in
[1:43:02] a mystery even the hidden wisdom which
[1:43:05] God ordained before the world unto our
[1:43:07] glory and I got that so I says now I
[1:43:10] wonder what that means well I know that
[1:43:12] if you would go if you or would be sent
[1:43:14] anywhere You' have to go in the power
[1:43:16] and demonstration of the spirit of the
[1:43:18] Living God and then I thought back here
[1:43:20] said well year here in New York City uh
[1:43:22] God has healed the people raised the
[1:43:24] dead that your faith wouldn't stand in
[1:43:27] human wisdom here that he would stand in
[1:43:30] the power of God to bring Revelation and
[1:43:32] heal the sick and so forth and then
[1:43:34] thinking if I would go anywhere this is
[1:43:37] what he give me and not known anymore
[1:43:39] until last night and I really got the
[1:43:41] shouting last night page 46 as brother
[1:43:44] man's reading here and he said my speech
[1:43:47] was not uh and my and my speech and my
[1:43:50] my beseeching was not with enticing
[1:43:52] words of man's Wisdom but in the
[1:43:53] demonstration of the spirit Power of the
[1:43:55] power there see there's the gospel see
[1:43:59] Jesus said go ye in all the world and
[1:44:01] preach the gospel didn't say go teach he
[1:44:03] said go preach in other words
[1:44:06] demonstrate the power and these signs
[1:44:08] shall follow them just teaching doesn't
[1:44:11] do it it takes the actual Spirit itself
[1:44:14] demonstrating these signs listen because
[1:44:17] to this that your faith should not stand
[1:44:19] in the wisdom of man but in the power of
[1:44:21] God oh my see to change the man now uh
[1:44:25] how be it in weakness among you that are
[1:44:28] perfect and then uh the Lord showed me
[1:44:31] this this what that meant there full
[1:44:33] grown perfect and I begin to say well
[1:44:36] now what does that mean perfect and then
[1:44:39] brother brandham here on page 46 he said
[1:44:42] here but we speak the wisdom of God in
[1:44:46] mystery see the threefold mystery of of
[1:44:50] God then I begin to shout then I
[1:44:54] realized that the wisdom that had been
[1:44:58] spoken here for 10 years and all of it
[1:45:01] was always pointing to Christ to have
[1:45:03] the preeminence which is the threefold
[1:45:06] mystery of God has already been spoken
[1:45:10] here and then he's telling me here in
[1:45:12] the sixth verse when this goes out it
[1:45:15] goes to those that are mature ready to
[1:45:18] receive it now go back to because about
[1:45:22] two weeks ago when I was when I was
[1:45:24] preaching Unity of the faith to those of
[1:45:26] us that are mature have have come to
[1:45:29] this spot hold it right there amen amen
[1:45:32] hold it right there to those that of us
[1:45:35] that are mature and then to the mature
[1:45:39] ones you can bring this Revelation as to
[1:45:43] what God was doing under the seventh
[1:45:47] seal amen amen and then when this this
[1:45:50] Revelation strikes as to what he has
[1:45:54] been doing under the seventh seal then
[1:45:58] you'll find out that it's been wisdom
[1:46:00] all the time that's been here bringing
[1:46:04] you the three-fold mystery of God see
[1:46:07] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:46:09] wisdom of man but in the power of God
[1:46:11] and demonstra in the power of God not
[1:46:14] giving all the exercise of his power but
[1:46:17] adding to the promises as you chop it
[1:46:19] out by faith
[1:46:21] amen see now and we speak this wisdom
[1:46:24] among them that are
[1:46:26] perfect oh I hope you can get what I'm
[1:46:28] trying to say other words the wisdom was
[1:46:31] spoken out of
[1:46:33] season maybe I can explain it that way
[1:46:37] it other hasn't even gone nowhere yet
[1:46:40] maybe that's better but it was spoken
[1:46:43] here this wisdom out of SE out of season
[1:46:47] as to what God was doing by this work
[1:46:50] word under the seven seal right amen and
[1:46:54] this is what is to come back upon the
[1:46:56] bride as he returns back and shows the
[1:46:59] bride to loose things how this one
[1:47:02] because went off here and this one
[1:47:03] because went off there but all the time
[1:47:06] what was it the word coming in amen and
[1:47:11] the bride being green and and and a ripe
[1:47:14] green full of life of this world blind
[1:47:18] wretched miserable poor and naked and
[1:47:20] didn't know it because full of of
[1:47:22] ability and also knowhow education and
[1:47:26] then for about 10 years in New York the
[1:47:29] word coming in by Revelation and
[1:47:31] stripping
[1:47:32] you absolutely making us
[1:47:36] weak absolutely making us weak and then
[1:47:41] the word came into Seven Virtues Faith
[1:47:44] through brotherly kindness and seven is
[1:47:47] God's number then if seven is God's
[1:47:50] number we have become perfectly
[1:47:53] weak amen then if we are perfectly weak
[1:47:57] through seven virtues we can't do
[1:47:58] nothing because it's
[1:48:00] human it's human you get it now that's
[1:48:03] why it's human we can't do nothing
[1:48:07] because we're still human and we got
[1:48:09] faith and virtue and patience and
[1:48:10] Temperance but we are still
[1:48:12] human and we can't do it but in New York
[1:48:16] he stripped
[1:48:17] us through these Seven Virtues he
[1:48:19] brought the word and it wouldn't let us
[1:48:22] move in this church here here anyway but
[1:48:25] according to the
[1:48:28] word I hope you got it it took the
[1:48:31] starch out of us it took the skin off
[1:48:33] our
[1:48:34] hands but he made us perfectly weak
[1:48:38] could nobody get up and raise up and uh
[1:48:40] with their own might and power and what
[1:48:43] call who they are and what not that was
[1:48:44] stripped out of here amen therefore
[1:48:47] we're all a weak laying around here amen
[1:48:50] we can't do nothing the closer we have
[1:48:52] gotten to him the weaker we have become
[1:48:55] cuz the more comes forth that you want
[1:48:57] you can't do it so now being speaking
[1:49:01] this wisdom this morning of the
[1:49:02] threefold Revelation God's one purpose
[1:49:06] amen was to to get his people uh get his
[1:49:11] word into his people the hope of glory
[1:49:14] that was his purpose to have the
[1:49:16] preeminence in his people and here it is
[1:49:19] this morning
[1:49:21] praise God to full grown seeds that have
[1:49:24] rapen and have finally ready my God for
[1:49:29] the wisdom of God to come in and God
[1:49:33] coming I hope you get what I'm trying to
[1:49:35] say God purposely stripping us down by
[1:49:39] the
[1:49:40] word many are waiting for thus in Soul
[1:49:44] nothing is being done just saying
[1:49:45] playing the tape and whatnot but no
[1:49:47] Revelation on what he said when you hear
[1:49:49] those tapes from out there that you
[1:49:51] understand what I'm talking about and
[1:49:53] everything I'd say was something new I
[1:49:55] thought I could understand it everything
[1:49:57] I'd speak is all new intelligence was a
[1:50:00] thing that tore up everybody it's on the
[1:50:02] tapes I said well that that is the Holy
[1:50:04] Ghost right then when I begin to preach
[1:50:08] like uh uh New York's a rough place you
[1:50:10] better have the word they didn't like it
[1:50:14] so I didn't know what I said he had e
[1:50:16] and Zion so I saw that the people are
[1:50:19] blanket it down with the intellectual
[1:50:21] conception of the message that they
[1:50:23] believe the message and that's it that's
[1:50:26] down in the West Indies South America
[1:50:29] it's in Europe New Zealand Africa all
[1:50:32] over the world in this country every one
[1:50:35] of them believe all they have to do is
[1:50:36] to get baptized acts 238 and that's it
[1:50:40] and they end the message and here we are
[1:50:42] you ask them down in the hours and so
[1:50:43] forth and ask them their condition right
[1:50:46] now also when you ask them that and you
[1:50:48] find out what's been here here it's been
[1:50:51] God I say I'm not going to say it no
[1:50:53] more now it's been God coming in here
[1:50:56] with the word to purposely make us
[1:50:59] perfectly weak through the Seven Virtues
[1:51:02] to bring on the perfect strength the
[1:51:05] charity which is the strength of every
[1:51:07] one of those virtues that's what he's
[1:51:10] been doing he has done it in New York
[1:51:13] City by the word of the Lord amen I hope
[1:51:17] you got it praise God that was my
[1:51:20] thought this morning amen so therefore
[1:51:23] it's a revelation to the elected ones
[1:51:26] that their father right now is revealing
[1:51:30] he loves him by the mere fact you're
[1:51:32] sitting in
[1:51:34] here he collected us here together amen
[1:51:38] and beat down our intellect amen by
[1:51:41] bringing forth a revelation and
[1:51:42] vindicating it yes amen amen beat it
[1:51:45] down brother that's right see no wonder
[1:51:48] the devil is howling against it see
[1:51:50] we was told right there that we all all
[1:51:53] right and the brother said unless you
[1:51:55] get out of the word we have the blood we
[1:51:56] all right we're waiting for the
[1:51:58] resurrection and the devil don't bother
[1:52:01] you say my see now that's his way of
[1:52:07] doing it the bride living the word and
[1:52:09] expressing Christ by let him have the
[1:52:10] preeminence is in her and then uh
[1:52:13] Wednesday night as we were speaking here
[1:52:16] about the lame man and having a purpose
[1:52:19] in his heart one day I'm going to be
[1:52:21] made whole for 38 years straggling
[1:52:24] around there and finally Jesus Christ
[1:52:26] saying rise up take up your bed and walk
[1:52:29] and not even really knowing who Christ
[1:52:31] was under the seventh seal what it was
[1:52:33] all about amen you getting it now and
[1:52:36] then Jesus Christ finding them in the
[1:52:39] temple assembled together there and
[1:52:42] coming back and saying behold Thou Art
[1:52:44] made whole praise God and then says sin
[1:52:47] no more don't miss the mark
[1:52:50] with your thoughts and ideas and so
[1:52:52] forth it's only the word it's not a
[1:52:55] church government it's the word amen
[1:52:58] praise God so relax and hit the bullseye
[1:53:01] every time amen see
[1:53:03] now after he's already been already been
[1:53:06] completed which it has now for eight
[1:53:09] years he returns back and shows the
[1:53:12] bride what he's done he reveals it is
[1:53:14] that what this voice is all about is
[1:53:16] ready to come back here and pick up
[1:53:19] these loose sins here and show it out
[1:53:21] now we are nothing we can't do it
[1:53:24] because it's not by our power nor our
[1:53:25] might see but by his Spirit now the word
[1:53:29] itself has made us weak as I said seven
[1:53:32] complete virtues human and the closer
[1:53:34] you get to God the weaker you are now
[1:53:37] now we have perfect weakness Seven
[1:53:39] Virtues now God's strength number eight
[1:53:42] Divine love can be made perfect is
[1:53:45] complete finished human weakness now
[1:53:47] charity is ready to do it now we can be
[1:53:50] kind to one another this is human and
[1:53:52] you know that but now can we love the
[1:53:57] unlovable can we love the worst white
[1:54:00] racist or the worst black extremist can
[1:54:03] we love the filthiest sodomite the
[1:54:06] dirtiest prostitute through our human
[1:54:10] virtues this morning can we do that come
[1:54:13] forward if you can you know you can't
[1:54:16] but charity will never fail
[1:54:20] Malachi for had charity and that's the
[1:54:24] word and he poured it into a bride do
[1:54:27] you know what he poured into his bride
[1:54:29] upon our faith he poured a blood
[1:54:31] atonement into us and this Blood
[1:54:34] atonement brings down his presence
[1:54:37] around the blood he sees the blood the
[1:54:40] blood is here let's say right here in
[1:54:42] New York City the blood Aton is here
[1:54:44] listen oh praise God here it comes fresh
[1:54:47] amen the blood of to is here through
[1:54:50] Revelation it's the
[1:54:52] word then if there's a people that's
[1:54:55] special to God for a purpose and it has
[1:54:58] received a blood atonement though they
[1:55:00] don't even understand it but one morning
[1:55:03] wisdom will come to them and explain it
[1:55:06] to them and then the blood atonement is
[1:55:08] there then he can descend the pillar of
[1:55:11] fire can come down in our midst because
[1:55:14] the blood atonement is already there by
[1:55:18] revelation
[1:55:21] he can't go there because they think
[1:55:23] it's one Minister many virgins can't go
[1:55:26] over here cuz it's abstinence do you get
[1:55:28] it can't go up here in New England
[1:55:31] because because no more
[1:55:33] pastors oh get it but here the word the
[1:55:38] sword the blood

[1:55:46] 10
[1:55:48] years God has put a blood atonement here
[1:55:51] in New York City the word of God and
[1:55:54] they say it's uh I'll just say it now

[1:56:00] the tent and all these things and you
[1:56:03] yall know that and it and all in the
[1:56:05] islands and all them places there I just
[1:56:07] I was sick to find out uh to find out
[1:56:10] you should get to see because these
[1:56:11] letters that are written here poor

[1:56:26] letters and all around the world they're
[1:56:29] doing all kind of crazy inan things and
[1:56:33] all the time it's the word if some
[1:56:36] Minister would only preach the word to
[1:56:38] them then otherwise then if they here's

[1:56:46] them everybody's all right just believe
[1:56:48] the message and and you got the Holy
[1:56:50] Ghost then those poor people without the
[1:56:52] Holy Ghost go out and the devil slays
[1:56:54] them but if they only knew that they had
[1:56:56] a promise they say back up Satan I got a
[1:56:59] promise god promise Satan and I'm going
[1:57:03] to receive the Holy Ghost now one the
[1:57:04] man to tell them that they're afraid to

[2:00:07] word under the seventh seal and many are
[2:00:11] waiting for all these things that they
[2:00:13] waiting for and is sitting in flesh and
[2:00:15] you don't dare preach on no flesh not in
[2:00:18] this message you better have the seventh
[2:00:20] seal on the spot with you outside of
[2:00:24] here yes sir now uh God is wanting to
[2:00:29] descend this morning because he sees the
[2:00:31] blood nature which has been which has
[2:00:34] brought us into his presence Now 1
[2:00:37] Corinthians 13 I'm finishing up here now
[2:00:39] sister
[2:00:39] naine I Paul said that with all the
[2:00:42] Mysteries and all I could do it myself
[2:00:44] I'm nothing without charity therefore
[2:00:47] the blood word sword sacrifice
[2:00:49] has been added to our faith the seed and
[2:00:52] brings us into God's presence and this
[2:00:54] is that great mystery upon that seven
[2:00:56] seal and charity controls Seven Virtues
[2:00:59] and gives strength to it Perfection
[2:01:02] partial knowledge Three Graces and the
[2:01:05] the loose hands are gathered up in the
[2:01:06] six seals and superseded by the seventh
[2:01:09] seal and revealed and given out as a
[2:01:11] message to be poured into the Bride As
[2:01:14] the word of God knowledge of the Son of
[2:01:16] God bringing a completeness of
[2:01:18] communication is Christ himself love no
[2:01:21] more tongues no more gifts and no more
[2:01:23] knowing in part amen if we know in part
[2:01:27] Baptist Methodist and so forth
[2:01:29] Pentecostal that's in part amen but he
[2:01:31] which is perfect is come a perfect
[2:01:33] knowledge of the perfect word is here
[2:01:36] with a revelation imperfection adding to
[2:01:39] our faith amen then Christ in the
[2:01:42] fullness in Peter stood up on the day of
[2:01:45] Pentecost they had spoken tongues for
[2:01:47] themselves amen but when it come to
[2:01:49] preaching and laying down the word that
[2:01:52] there was no tongues then Christ was
[2:01:54] there in the fullness in Peter
[2:01:56] communicating to his people through one
[2:02:00] language Galilean amen now the Mexican
[2:02:03] girl here in brother br's meeting here
[2:02:06] she spoke Spanish no English and while
[2:02:08] brother brandham quoted from the vision
[2:02:11] she understood everything he said for
[2:02:13] Christ was there communicating he which
[2:02:15] is perfect was there from the vision so
[2:02:18] t and knowledge in part shall be
[2:02:20] superseded by the more complete perfect
[2:02:23] knowledge by means by means of divine

[2:02:50] maybe you didn't get it all that's all
[2:02:52] right but let me say this to you that uh
[2:02:55] the mystery of what God was trying to do
[2:02:58] he was just to break it down to you
[2:03:00] simply he was trying to get the
[2:03:02] preeminence in his people now the devil
[2:03:05] hates this
[2:03:08] Revelation you see man I knew that for
[2:03:11] for even coming here see all week long
[2:03:13] see but therefore if I could say it to
[2:03:16] you this way God
[2:03:19] has given us here a revelation here
[2:03:23] Jacob Grace Joseph Perfection and I
[2:03:26] don't even want to say it no more cuz I
[2:03:28] feel that we have reached the time and
[2:03:31] went out here to Tucson and preaching on
[2:03:34] the absolute on the Sunday morning
[2:03:36] January 20th brother Perry Green's
[2:03:39] father he's a dreamer and he's the one
[2:03:41] that because dream because about brother
[2:03:43] brandom going back to Jack Moore's
[2:03:45] Church in shreport ' 65 he came out told
[2:03:49] me said brother Coman that shuck was
[2:03:51] completely
[2:03:53] dry and he says 2/3 walked out and I
[2:03:57] said my then there was a sign to me that
[2:04:00] the seed if the shuck is dry then the
[2:04:03] last life has left the Shook and is in
[2:04:07] the
[2:04:08] seed then if the last life has left the
[2:04:12] Shook and is in the seed then the last
[2:04:15] bit of greenness has left the seed and
[2:04:17] has turned golden
[2:04:20] Brown I hope you got that that was the
[2:04:23] dream that was spoken to me after a hard
[2:04:25] message I had to preach and the other
[2:04:27] was brother Fred Barker brother brand
[2:04:30] told him because he's paralyzed down the
[2:04:32] side and he's the song leader and
[2:04:35] brother Bram told him in 65 I don't have
[2:04:38] a word of the Lord for you he said but
[2:04:41] one day you'll speak the right word and
[2:04:43] say the right thing and you'll be healed
[2:04:46] and that night I told the two son
[2:04:48] tabernac I said my God you got a
[2:04:50] blessing of God sitting right here you
[2:04:52] got a sign of the third pole and I spoke
[2:04:55] about because because sister com's eye
[2:04:57] also I says right here I says the the
[2:05:00] mighty intelligence the Dynamics of God
[2:05:02] is wanting to come down and give us the
[2:05:05] mind of Christ what to say the right
[2:05:07] thing and do the right thing and if we
[2:05:10] have already received the Revelation
[2:05:12] this morning we've been doing the right
[2:05:14] thing by the
[2:05:16] word amen I hope you get now other words
[2:05:20] this is doing other words the secret is
[2:05:22] knowing what to do and what to say so he
[2:05:25] moved the mind of Christ into the bride
[2:05:28] the word which tells us what to do and
[2:05:31] tells us what to say and how to walk and
[2:05:33] how to live and how to talk amen and
[2:05:35] we've been doing it on inspiration for
[2:05:38] the last 10 years just doing the right
[2:05:40] thing keep on doing it keep on doing it
[2:05:42] then one day like sister hady right
[2:05:45] you'll say the right thing that's
[2:05:48] nothing but the truth and if you can
[2:05:50] speak that this morning that this
[2:05:52] message is nothing but the truth then
[2:05:55] the inspiration can move around oh God
[2:05:59] this morning is wanting to move upon his
[2:06:01] people he's looking for a people that
[2:06:04] believes the word in it Simplicity that
[2:06:08] won't tense up and and try to figure it
[2:06:10] out just believe the word as it has been
[2:06:14] spoken the wisdom of it being this
[2:06:16] mystery and a three-fold purpose of God
[2:06:19] then the mighty Dynamics can move in and
[2:06:23] drop in on his people and make us speak
[2:06:26] the right things praise our God and then
[2:06:29] you'll see a perfect communication go
[2:06:31] forth it'll be perfect I believe it with
[2:06:34] all my heart amen I believe that it'll
[2:06:36] come on the wings of a snow white dove
[2:06:40] you believe that friends I want to read
[2:06:42] something to you as she picks up that
[2:06:43] key there wings of a snow white DB i w
[2:06:46] let you go I told you that brother brand
[2:06:49] preached this message events made clear
[2:06:51] by by
[2:06:53] prophecy he said friends this is Def
[2:06:56] fulfillment that's page
[2:06:58] 41 this is the Fulfillment of Malachi 4
[2:07:02] St Luke 17:30 St John Revelation 10
[2:07:06] prophecies then he went on he made him
[2:07:08] stand he said pledged by the the brandom
[2:07:11] Tabernacle now with one Accord let's
[2:07:14] stand and say I now accept Jesus Christ
[2:07:18] as Savior and and Al healer and by his
[2:07:22] grace from this hour henceforth oh God
[2:07:24] let no unbelief ever into my heart for I
[2:07:29] have seen the prophecy of this day
[2:07:31] fulfilled I believe that Jesus Christ is
[2:07:34] alive and here now confirming his word
[2:07:37] of this hour the prophecies that was
[2:07:40] written of him has now been fulfilled in
[2:07:44] our midst he is my savior my god king my
[2:07:48] all and all dear God hear our testimony

[2:07:59] praise thee the mighty one the god of
[2:08:01] the prophets in Jesus Christ's name amen
[2:08:04] then he made him sing now I believe I
[2:08:07] wonder is that your testimony this this
[2:08:10] morning I wonder if you believe this
[2:08:14] Revelation that has gone forth in New
[2:08:16] York City I I wonder if you believe it's
[2:08:19] been from God cuz I myself feel it's all
[2:08:22] over with I feel it's finished with it's
[2:08:24] done and it's been spoken and I do not
[2:08:28] intend I hope not to have to come back
[2:08:31] to refer back to my person or anything
[2:08:33] like that there for that's to me it's
[2:08:36] over with it's finished with all I'm
[2:08:39] waiting for now is a sign on the wings
[2:08:42] of a snow white do so all I'm waiting
[2:08:44] for now and I know that a message like
[2:08:47] of this timee is a rough one to bring
[2:08:50] because God's got to reveal it and so
[2:08:52] therefore though you try to tell the
[2:08:54] people don't strain and don't try to
[2:08:57] press see if you could only be thanking
[2:09:01] God for what has been revealed this
[2:09:04] morning I don't know praise God but uh
[2:09:09] nevertheless God has spoken and so
[2:09:13] therefore that is the message of God and
[2:09:17] what he his purpose purp was Wednesday
[2:09:20] night the previous Wednesday it was God
[2:09:24] overpowering whenever that Catholic
[2:09:26] Church just mentioned the Holy Spirit
[2:09:28] comes down and just overpowers every
[2:09:29] Spirit out here and not even being in my
[2:09:32] mind that that just like this you see
[2:09:34] and then on the battlefield Sunday
[2:09:36] morning then coming back Wednesday the
[2:09:38] you were coming into it you entered into
[2:09:42] it see so you got blessed is as you
[2:09:46] enter into it you will get blessed
[2:09:49] this morning trying to teach you what it
[2:09:52] has been and in doing this here many
[2:09:54] always compare what they were doing then
[2:09:57] the the self uh uh judgment comes in and
[2:10:01] that's where he goes just like it's here
[2:10:03] and you feel it drop the bottom Fallout
[2:10:05] and see but nevertheless um the hour has
[2:10:09] come and I believe with all my heart the
[2:10:13] shook is just about dry the seeds are
[2:10:16] mature according what he gave me on
[2:10:19] Mount Camelback I know you don't
[2:10:21] understand it it has to do with finally
[2:10:23] accepting the will of God that's all it
[2:10:26] means you mature you're ready for the
[2:10:28] principles of the kingdom of God to flow
[2:10:31] through you the principles the word here
[2:10:34] in New York City has cleaned out every
[2:10:36] Spirit moved it out of you that's what
[2:10:39] it's been for moved it out of you wash
[2:10:42] it cleanse it that's finished with now
[2:10:44] now the mind of Christ coming on the
[2:10:46] wings of a snow white dove can move into

[2:11:05] going out here to Tucson and seeing the
[2:11:07] mind of Christ and seeing what God did
[2:11:10] and coming here this morning not even

[2:17:24] Christ a sign gave William brandom a
[2:17:27] sign the message this morning meaning
[2:17:29] that he's going to send us a sign on the
[2:17:32] wings of a dove what's that sign brother
[2:17:34] Coleman that's all over with it's
[2:17:37] finished all over with return back that
[2:17:41] second time said behold Thou Art made
[2:17:44] whole just relaxing praise God moving
[2:17:48] into a feeling and knowing that is
[2:17:52] finished with and realizing that present
[2:17:56] tense salvation under the seventh seal
[2:18:00] the mystery hidden from the ages the
[2:18:04] word the secret made known just a plain
[2:18:08] word God knowing that the human Great
[2:18:11] Mighty intellect second Timothy 3 hey
[2:18:13] High minded could impersonate those
[2:18:16] seven virtues so he hid it and just said
[2:18:20] it's the word and knowing that those
[2:18:21] seven those senses those five senses
[2:18:24] couldn't know that it's just the word so
[2:18:26] they had to to like come out with all
[2:18:28] kind of strange ideas and doctrines and
[2:18:31] then when that bride has held to the
[2:18:33] word then God comes back around and
[2:18:36] drops the Holy Ghost upon those Lambs
[2:18:38] that have added to their nature the
[2:18:41] blood sacrifice the word of God we are
[2:18:44] here and I I know we are oh praise God
[2:18:48] on the wings of a snow let's take one
[2:18:52] another's
[2:18:56] hands God send his
[2:18:59] pure
[2:19:01] Sweet
[2:19:03] Love A same
[2:19:07] [Applause]
[2:19:10] from on the wings of
[2:19:14] a that's it all on the wings of a
[2:19:21] snow
[2:19:23] [Music]
[2:19:25] why God sends his
[2:19:29] pure
[2:19:32] Sweet
[2:19:33] Love A S from
[2:19:40] above on the wings
[2:19:46] of
[2:19:48] praise His name every head bowed on the
[2:19:51] wings of a snow white dove the message
[2:19:54] has gone
[2:19:55] forth I know it's the
[2:19:58] truth the enemies howling and
[2:20:01] scowling but God's going to vindicate it
[2:20:05] on the sign on the wings of a dove he's
[2:20:09] going to send it I know that for the
[2:20:12] word of God has been preached here and
[2:20:15] he'll vindicate his word but just had to
[2:20:18] bring this thought to you this morning
[2:20:20] tying it into to you bring it out my
[2:20:23] simple thought was that them people
[2:20:26] typing out Christ in the Old Testament
[2:20:28] under them Seven Seals didn't know
[2:20:31] exactly what they were doing they were
[2:20:33] being led by the spirit of God and
[2:20:35] that's all it was under the seventh seal
[2:20:40] being led by the spirit word anointing
[2:20:44] and doing it and letting God come in and
[2:20:47] have the preeminence to clean us up
[2:20:49] through the washing of the Water by the
[2:20:52] word and now we stand here different
[2:20:55] dreams and things happening and
[2:20:57] manifestations and realizing that the
[2:20:59] mechanics has gone forth and to
[2:21:01] perfectly prove it to you Christ is
[2:21:04] revealing his own Jesus Christ on our
[2:21:06] hands he says you are not supposed to
[2:21:10] know the
[2:21:12] mechanics then he comes back around and
[2:21:14] says you're only supposed to know the
[2:21:16] Dynamics the pul ating of it so I
[2:21:19] understand what's going on this morning
[2:21:21] but praise God there been a
[2:21:23] revelation to bring out these
[2:21:26] mechanics and to explain it to you and
[2:21:29] the devil hates that but it's it has is
[2:21:33] finished to me it's over with and I'm
[2:21:36] looking for Jesus Christ the dove to
[2:21:39] come and prove it on the spot to smash
[2:21:44] the individuals in the forehead it'll
[2:21:45] never be a group it'll be is an
[2:21:48] individual love affair with Jesus Christ
[2:21:51] so don't look for a group but there was
[2:21:54] a place in New York City by the grace of
[2:21:57] God that this Revelation was preached in
[2:22:00] and so I trust and pray it's been
[2:22:03] wonderful the past
[2:22:06] years it's been wonderful knowing that
[2:22:09] God has put uh to me some of the cream
[2:22:12] of the crop together that we could come
[2:22:15] in here and fellowship like this here
[2:22:16] and take this word of God and let me
[2:22:18] exalt you here this morning if you love
[2:22:20] God and you are predestinated unto the
[2:22:22] adoption you're going to receive the
[2:22:24] Holy Ghost you're going to know what
[2:22:26] it's all about only want you to believe
[2:22:29] it and to relax you come back wsy come
[2:22:34] back relaxed God's going to fulfill
[2:22:37] every bit of his word is already moving
[2:22:41] and I'm just looking for it to come
[2:22:44] anytime when the prophet of God spoke
[2:22:46] this message message here he says the
[2:22:48] second pull was finished the third pull
[2:22:51] was at hand and so I'm trying to by
[2:22:54] faith step forward and I feel that this
[2:22:57] portion is finished and I feel that what
[2:22:59] we're looking for is at hand the
[2:23:01] manifestation of Christ in the bride so
[2:23:04] here we are praise the Lord so the Lord
[2:23:07] bless you the Lord be with you it's long
[2:23:09] but uh I felt it's up on my heart to get
[2:23:11] it off and so therefore it's the
[2:23:14] children's bread and let us come back
[2:23:17] now uh Wednesday night and but now I see
[2:23:21] and I'm looking for the five God to fall
[2:23:23] and oh that's what he meant praise the
[2:23:26] Lord Brother Kurt may the Lord bless you
