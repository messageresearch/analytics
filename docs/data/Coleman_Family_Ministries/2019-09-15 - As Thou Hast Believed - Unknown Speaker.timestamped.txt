[0:00] we want to read from Saint Matthew the
[0:02] eighth chapter verse 5 through verses 13
[0:06] inclusive I'm reading from Saint Matthew
[0:09] the fifth the eighth chapter rather a
[0:11] verse five and when Jesus was entered in
[0:16] took a camper gnam they came unto him
[0:20] asa Torian beseeching him and saying
[0:24] Lord my servant lieth at home sick of
[0:28] the palsy palsy grievously tormented and
[0:32] jesus said unto him i will come in
[0:34] helium the Centurion answered and said
[0:38] lord I am not worthy that thou should
[0:40] has come under my roof but Speak the
[0:43] word only and my servant shall be healed
[0:46] for I am a man under Authority having
[0:49] soldiers under me and I say this to man
[0:52] go and he goeth and to another come and
[0:55] he cometh and to my servant do this and
[0:57] he do with it when Jesus heard it he
[1:00] marvelled I said to them that followed
[1:02] verily I say unto you I've not found so
[1:05] great faith no not in Israel and I say
[1:08] unto you had many shall come from the
[1:11] east and west and shall sit down with
[1:14] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the
[1:17] kingdom of heaven but the children of
[1:21] the kingdom thank you shall be cast out
[1:24] into outer darkness there shall be
[1:27] weeping and gnashing of teeth and jesus
[1:29] said unto the Centurion go thy way and
[1:31] as thou hast believed so be it done unto
[1:35] thee and his servant was healed in the
[1:39] selfsame hour and I like to take a
[1:42] thought out of this as thou hast
[1:47] believed made a lord at a blessing to
[1:51] the reading of his word now let us get
[1:53] on with the message praise God so now we
[1:55] have those here that realize that the
[1:58] Word of God is soul amen and God will
[2:01] because vindicate his word he said he
[2:04] would do it and he's and he's going to
[2:06] do it and we believe that now um it's
[2:09] our brother spoke here in 65 I believe
[2:11] it was
[2:12] they were praying there when he was
[2:14] first struck down by the enemy and then
[2:16] uh the Holy Spirit spoke through his own
[2:19] wife these words they shall lay hands on
[2:21] the sick and they shall recover and the
[2:24] devil try to make them go against that
[2:26] but God has spoken through his wife and
[2:28] they laid hands and here he's still here
[2:31] amen and so he had a promise that he was
[2:34] to live and the doctors didn't give him
[2:35] no time to live but they laid hands in
[2:37] it and because he recovered and
[2:39] believing that then a prophet of God
[2:42] came down the road with a commanded
[2:44] blessing and he had a little spoonful
[2:47] oil amen and the Prophet poured some
[2:51] supernatural faith into his little
[2:53] spoonful and he's had a whole barrel
[2:56] full ever since hey man it hasn't run
[2:59] dry in Haven brother friend and brother
[3:02] Fred told me I'll narrow zone he said
[3:04] brother Coleman I like that I never
[3:06] thought about it can you nurse he said I
[3:09] like that so he's nursing amen so now we
[3:14] see then at this hour in as speaking
[3:16] here as brother Branham has spoke to our
[3:19] brother here and about the right
[3:22] attitude and the syrophoenician woman
[3:24] and how we know so well as Jesus Christ
[3:27] say for this saying you're healed and go
[3:30] your way I mean because your daughter's
[3:32] heal rather and she went on her way in
[3:34] the daughters heal and then I had a note
[3:37] here and his brother Bram told we got a
[3:40] brother here someday you will say the
[3:41] right thing and it will all be over and
[3:43] then just this year here he spoke it
[3:46] will go no further it will be over and
[3:48] then uh so all of this is pointing into
[3:51] the right attitude now in night in
[3:54] Spokane Washington 1962 on a tape call
[3:58] hear ye him adoption in his prayer he
[4:02] said these words he says wait for the
[4:04] right thing to be done or the right word
[4:07] to be spoken for that great faith that
[4:10] we might dash into the blessings of God
[4:13] see it's the right attitude now this
[4:16] morning we might as well relax because I
[4:20] haven't got nothing to say to make
[4:22] anything happen
[4:24] so there's no ancient gonna fly around
[4:26] in through here I'm just gonna preach
[4:28] the Word of God we're gonna be blessed
[4:30] and whatever God wants to do is already
[4:32] ordained before the financial world to
[4:34] do it so they I'm not gonna restrain to
[4:37] hope something happens that I might see
[4:39] it this morning not even worrying about
[4:41] it I'm saved
[4:44] the greatest miracle has already
[4:46] happened I'm in the house of God I'm
[4:49] enjoying the blessings of God I'm not
[4:51] hoping and wondering his brother Barbara
[4:54] is it gonna be healed today it's none of
[4:56] my business I can't heal him I can't
[4:58] preach anything that's gonna heal him
[5:00] for the end God himself must give him
[5:03] the right words so sit back and relax
[5:07] and hear the word of the Lord
[5:09] and this and I cannot give brother Gary
[5:12] a leg I can't heal him can't do nothing
[5:16] so we might as well sit back and don't
[5:18] try to hope that he'll be healed today
[5:21] you you we all would like to see that
[5:25] God knows that but what we wanted would
[5:27] just be calm and this lip just let's
[5:31] just hear the word amen
[5:34] praise the Lord now it's that right
[5:37] attitude and you must come with the
[5:41] right attitude to God to receive
[5:43] anything from God and on the the
[5:47] unveiling of the of the mighty God as
[5:48] brother bark and I was a rejoicing over
[5:51] it on page 11 the the news for word book
[5:54] here and he says this here you have to
[5:57] know these words and these things look
[6:00] at handy right at that time when the
[6:01] third pole you could you remember it all
[6:03] of us of all the everything that the
[6:06] woman said the right thing you got to
[6:09] say that right word the right thing to
[6:11] God see
[6:13] now therefore ain't nothing now what
[6:15] could have you right how does she know
[6:17] what she was going to say she didn't
[6:19] even know anything about the third pole
[6:20] in that sense but when brother Brown
[6:22] related it back to her the Holy Spirit
[6:25] fell upon her and she said that's
[6:26] nothing but the truth and in the God
[6:29] from heaven fell in the room and she
[6:32] scream you could hear a city block away
[6:34] I hate anointing hit them so hard their
[6:36] faces hit the take
[6:37] God was all older and brother Ram jumped
[6:40] up and says ask what you will say
[6:43] anything sister Hedda you got it as four
[6:47] million dollars it's yours anything you
[6:49] want and she said the right word I knows
[6:52] what she said the salvation of my two
[6:55] sons there's the greatest miracle I hope
[7:00] that ties it down this morning that you
[7:03] won't look for the limbs and things that
[7:06] you'll look for the salvation of your
[7:08] families that's what I don't want the
[7:11] third pull for that come fresh didn't
[7:14] even all you more sayeth Amen praise got
[7:17] an inspiration not even knowing what she
[7:20] asked for and that was the fifth thing
[7:22] that he told him in the hospital he put
[7:24] it in that order number five to him
[7:26] that's exactly what I said happened down
[7:28] in Puerto Rico revelation 22:17
[7:32] salvation God speaking with mercy and
[7:35] love to your families and tell them come
[7:38] to the house of God there is the
[7:40] greatest miracle amen
[7:42] and brother Browne said these words here
[7:44] what's this revival belong for now how
[7:48] could it prosper how could it be blessed
[7:49] I don't care how many impersonations is
[7:52] God or anything else that's all when
[7:55] Moses went out there was a mixed
[7:56] multitude went with him amen brother
[7:59] and the last night amen but um what's it
[8:04] done for its Jehovah himself taking a
[8:06] veil off of God to show the difference
[8:09] between right and wrong which is
[8:11] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian or who's
[8:14] right God's Word is right well every man
[8:16] be a lie and mind the truth and God
[8:18] needs no interpreter he does his own
[8:20] interpretation he manifested and made he
[8:22] gives interpretation God unveiling
[8:25] himself
[8:25] oh my right in the midst of us we see
[8:29] his great hand telling us these things
[8:31] see and he goes on down he says and he's
[8:35] done the same thing today putting his
[8:38] word right out in front what he promised
[8:41] not here it is every promise in the word
[8:44] laying right before us in plain view my
[8:50] what a thought can you imagine malachi
[8:54] for left every promise that's what I
[8:56] told you
[8:57] quicken every promise and gave it to us
[8:59] and it's laying here this morning in
[9:01] plain view what do you want we have the
[9:05] authority this morning to speak it
[9:09] salvation we can give out eternal life
[9:11] this morning healing or whatever that we
[9:15] can give it out this morning it's in
[9:17] plain view as thou hast believed
[9:21] anything you want this morning is here
[9:23] hey here's brother Ronnie towles letter
[9:26] the man come in as sick with a fever
[9:28] everything else in pain but the word the
[9:30] Lord went forth nobody knew he was sick
[9:32] but Jesus did amen so Jesus knows all
[9:37] about it this morning down in the
[9:39] basement mothers up in the balcony young
[9:41] people and where you are Jesus knows
[9:43] everything in your heart this morning he
[9:45] knows exactly what you're going for all
[9:47] he wants this morning is that every
[9:50] promise is laying right before us it's
[9:52] in plain view and all he want us this
[9:54] morning let's look at the right attitude
[9:56] of faith as a word stood before the
[9:59] Gentiles Centurion now I'm here and I'll
[10:02] scripture lesson this morning Jesus
[10:04] Christ coming down from off because from
[10:08] off the mountain he had been up there
[10:11] chapter 5 6 and 7 st. Matthew he had
[10:16] been up there expounding on the
[10:18] principles of the kingdom of God he had
[10:22] been up there declaring the mechanics of
[10:25] the kingdom of God he had been up there
[10:29] about eight years instructing the people
[10:31] in the mechanics in the principles he
[10:34] even preached about false anointed ones
[10:36] over there and met the Chimera through
[10:38] seven false teachers told you about the
[10:41] two ways to come to straight gate and
[10:43] wired gate and also don't have no faith
[10:45] he even preached in the commands over
[10:48] here I think of the sixth chapter fits
[10:49] the fifth chapter on marriage and
[10:51] divorce everything is in the fifth and
[10:54] sixth and seventh chapters on
[10:56] righteousness in the kingdom amen
[10:59] and after he had finished explaining the
[11:02] learning of himself
[11:04] instructing he come off that mountain
[11:06] now in Chapter eight in Chapter nine he
[11:09] was ready to prove what he was talking
[11:11] about
[11:12] Amen so if you reach health 8 in chapter
[11:15] 9 come to dynamics to prove it
[11:17] but a chapter five six and seven was the
[11:19] mechanics of what he was talking about
[11:21] amen and brother he told him all about
[11:25] everything marriage he divorced
[11:27] everything now the principle studied in
[11:30] the three chapters here in st. Luke six
[11:33] are those which should be operating in
[11:35] the entire bride of Jesus Christ the
[11:39] things that we have heard Jesus Christ
[11:41] himself speak through Malachi 4 on those
[11:43] tapes up on a mountain with us all these
[11:47] years are the principles that should be
[11:50] operating this morning in the bride of
[11:53] Jesus Christ amen see so therefore for
[11:57] that reason God ordained he sent Malachi
[12:02] for with a message a seven seal message
[12:05] and this message was ordained to bring a
[12:08] deliverance to his blood wash
[12:11] predestinated seeds of God that was in
[12:14] Laodicea all messed up all entangled in
[12:17] marriage and divorce and false and Noah
[12:18] and everything else and he sent a
[12:21] prophet with a message to bring us a
[12:24] deliverance from every spirit that would
[12:28] keep the principles of Jesus Christ from
[12:31] operating in you amen see now well when
[12:36] we were in a Pentecostal church we'd
[12:37] read the Bible and wish we could do
[12:39] these things and go right back out and
[12:41] fail but when Malachi 4 come forth he
[12:45] proved that you can do these things for
[12:48] his word wash you from the spirits that
[12:51] was holding back the word of the Lord
[12:53] from operating in you and that was a
[12:56] Ephesians 5:26 the washing of the water
[12:59] by the word amen and then the next thing
[13:02] he was this message was supposed to do a
[13:05] message of faith and deliverance
[13:07] deliverance from every known Spirit amen
[13:12] every one of them and when we finally
[13:14] delivered an armature to praise God
[13:18] then he was to restore the church to the
[13:21] righteousness holiness nature authority
[13:24] and power of Christ and I feel you on a
[13:28] verge of this dismal by the dynamics
[13:32] coming down to bring the foot to bring
[13:35] to pass the mechanics that Malachi 4 has
[13:37] released every promise in the word it
[13:40] lays right before us this morning in
[13:42] plain view but we must come with the
[13:44] right attitude to receive these things
[13:47] now the mechanics has gone forth and
[13:50] then come the dynamics after Jesus come
[13:53] off the hill and as Jesus Christ come
[13:56] down and he entered into Capernaum here
[13:59] and a Gentile a Centurion because he
[14:04] approached him and as he came up on him
[14:06] here's what he said I just read it again
[14:07] you'll have to get it and when Jesus was
[14:10] entered into Capernaum there came unto
[14:12] him a Satori and beseeching him and
[14:14] saying Lord my servant lieth at home
[14:16] sick of the palsy grievously tormented
[14:19] because he had paralyzed and jesus said
[14:23] unto him I will come and heal him the
[14:25] Centurion answered and said lord I am
[14:28] not worthy that thou should has come
[14:30] under my roof but Speak the word only
[14:33] and my servant shall be healed
[14:35] what a attitude what the right attitude
[14:40] of Gentile approaching the word amen
[14:44] and here was a man that was under
[14:46] Authority but this man had heard about
[14:49] Jesus Christ and what he was doing and
[14:52] he believed it he was a Roman and here
[14:54] was the Jews who the revelation was for
[14:58] of God coming through their own prophets
[15:00] and they were fighting him with unbelief
[15:03] hey I mean what a contrast here was a
[15:07] Gentile dog who just saw a few things I
[15:10] heard about he believed here he come for
[15:11] his own servant and he approaches him in
[15:14] the right editor he says I am not worthy
[15:18] praise God he some a man on the
[15:22] authority in other words the meaning
[15:24] being that if this minor officer could
[15:27] issue orders to his of subordinates
[15:31] go and they go and coming to come and do
[15:33] this and they do it you understand
[15:36] the Centurion recognized that just as he
[15:40] had authority invested in him by Rome
[15:42] was his headquarters amen so Jesus had
[15:46] authority from God that enabled him to
[15:49] exercise power over disease
[15:51] so therefore this Roman centurion know
[15:55] that his headquarters was Rome and in
[15:57] Rome told him to do certain things there
[15:59] in Israel he'd do it because Rome gave
[16:02] him that authority he had authority from
[16:05] Rome Jesus Christ had authority from
[16:07] heaven praise got over every disease
[16:11] Amen and this Roman centurion recognized
[16:15] praise God and then he realized he
[16:19] wasn't saved but he realized he had a
[16:22] reverence for God so he come to God with
[16:25] the right attitude brother he has to
[16:29] receive something he come with the right
[16:31] attitude he didn't come like I ain't got
[16:34] nothing I don't understand
[16:35] this was what his brother como talking
[16:37] about now no he come with the right
[16:39] attitude every Wednesday and every
[16:40] Sunday maybe this is the day Lord God
[16:44] I'm gonna get something this morning
[16:46] happy rejoicing in his salvation present
[16:51] tense salvation a pearl of great price
[16:56] soul all you had and bought this pearl
[16:59] of great price and you got it now now
[17:03] are you the sons of God and it does not
[17:06] appear what you shall be amen and this
[17:09] man's men obeyed him to the letter
[17:11] now this Centurion was expressing
[17:15] absolute faith in the power of Christ
[17:19] amen
[17:20] scene and he was saying here you have
[17:22] authority over demons and one word from
[17:25] you will be enough to heal my servant
[17:28] yes I know you can do all things I've
[17:33] heard about it I've seen it so therefore
[17:35] you don't have to come to my house amen
[17:40] praise God I'll need a minister to come
[17:43] to lay hands upon me praise God I need
[17:47] God to come down from heaven with a
[17:49] white horse I need God to set up a tent
[17:52] for me to go into a little room to be
[17:54] he'll praise God you're a god of
[17:58] distance you don't have to come to my
[18:01] house I got a revelation Lord that you
[18:05] can heal a million miles away Oh Lord
[18:09] you got to do I must come with the right
[18:11] attitude I know who you are your God
[18:14] amen so therefore I'm not worthy to even
[18:19] stand in your presence like the
[18:22] saphenous woman she says that he said
[18:23] you're a dog she said a dog's licked the
[18:27] crumbs under the master's table what an
[18:29] attitude and another Gentile Amen what
[18:33] faith what a right attitude praise God
[18:36] coming to God with the right attitude
[18:39] humility reverence faith and there was
[18:43] and Jesus stood there and marveled and I
[18:47] believe in the Bible I think you'll find
[18:49] only twice way because wit he marvels he
[18:52] marvels had a Gentiles faith I think a
[18:54] st. mark six I believe it it's where he
[18:56] marvels at the unbelief of his own
[18:58] people huh so he's human he could marvel
[19:02] Hey and he got a human Saheb amen and so
[19:06] that's why I get very happy when I see
[19:08] those with great faith too and I marvel
[19:11] at the unbelief also Amen praise the
[19:14] Lord I see my why can't they understand
[19:16] it well praise the Lord so we are human
[19:19] you know amen and we marvel and he
[19:21] marveled at faith and unbelief also
[19:24] praise God it's kind of hardly
[19:27] understand why people come in here
[19:28] dejected all the time when we have the
[19:32] greatest oh I mean what can I tell you
[19:36] what is there to be dejected about you
[19:41] are richer than every millionaire in the
[19:43] world put together
[19:45] you're over top of the king of England
[19:49] and the Queen of England
[19:51] we are kings and priests of eternity
[19:56] this little meager world's not our world
[19:59] this is man stuff here our world I
[20:03] hasn't seen ear hasn't heard what God
[20:08] has in store for the kings and priests
[20:12] who love him and who come with the right
[20:15] attitude now we are the sons of Almighty
[20:19] God thought you can do anything for your
[20:22] daughter in your son this morning praise
[20:25] God he marvel at this great faith Jesus
[20:29] saw the great faith of the Centurion in
[20:31] recognizing here it is and I recognized
[20:34] that he had a power to speak merely as a
[20:37] word where he was see and his servant
[20:42] would be healed
[20:43] that's what Jesus Christ marvel at that
[20:45] this Centurion had the faith and the
[20:48] understanding to know that Jesus Christ
[20:50] could stand right there and don't even
[20:53] go to his house and just speak a word
[20:55] and be healed oh I wonder we have this
[20:58] faith this morning amen and how the holy
[21:02] spirit would come down and just marvel
[21:05] and just come all around you amen the
[21:10] angel of the Lord now who do you think
[21:11] he'll this poor tricking brother oh
[21:12] because Spanish brother over here in
[21:14] Puerto Rico as he's as I was preaching
[21:16] up here nobody knew he was sick the
[21:19] angel the law will not didn't heal them
[21:21] the angel Lord is moving all through
[21:23] here now the angels and medicine spirits
[21:26] are here but the angel of the Lord he
[21:31] can touch you amen I remember old tapey
[21:35] I think sister Wolman had and she gave
[21:37] it to us there and brought round
[21:38] starting to preach and before he went
[21:40] into it he said oh my something just
[21:43] happened but I won't say anything about
[21:44] it yes I will and he saw a woman be
[21:47] touched by the angel of the Lord
[21:49] and he thought it was bank's word son
[21:52] David he thought it was David stand over
[21:55] but it was angel the Lord so he told the
[21:57] woman that she was just healed she
[21:59] didn't even know it and if this is the
[22:03] season for the spoken word the angel
[22:06] Lord can come up on you sitting here

[22:28] distance he believed it and so jesus
[22:32] healed him at a distance and there was
[22:35] there your church Jesus can heal at a
[22:37] distance this morning praise God you
