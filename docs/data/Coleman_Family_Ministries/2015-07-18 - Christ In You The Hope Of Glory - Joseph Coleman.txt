so truly these have been the Capstone meetings of these past 21 years for me preaching the inspiration of the seven Thunders I said the inspiration a lot of you know people don't understand what I'm talking about a lot of the the ministers well this brother BR says three steps water blood and spirit and the water is the word which was the reveal word to Seven Seals that's the word then blood a revelation of seven Thunders reveals the blood the atonement has been here all along but Malachi 4 revealed the fullness of the atonement and that's what the thunderus does it reveals every word every jot every tit every mystery in the book and Jesus said lo I come in the volume of the book so the Thunders is Jesus Christ the Thunders reveals Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ God must always be Veil so when Malachi God in Malachi 4 spoke where did it go at it went in you bad your skins thank you brother Theo may be seated so water is the Seven Seals blood is a revelation of the seven Thunders that bring the fullness of the blood into our different churches because the Holy Spirit he doesn't want to descend on water he likes to descend where there's a blood there then fire comes down on blood and that's seven Thunders praise God has revealed the blood of Jesus Christ that's all what it's all about what are they fussing about am it's the blood bleeding bloody dripping word June 14 1964 God rent the veil of every denomination and there stood Jesus Christ in Jeffersonville Indiana 1964 before June 14th the mighty conqueror praise God we already have a victory yes sir you are victorious tonight the devil fought you for 20 some years but you're here you have overcome him oh I better not get started saw preach before we a to get started amen so now you understand may be seated what is all about the blood in there you got to have have a little rebuking of spirits otherwise you have a church full of spirits if you have if you're a farmer you're planting wheat and you get some tears in there if nothing happens you get a whole lot of Tears you have a weak wheat feeli but brother if you can keep them tears out of there you have a strong Wheat Field praise God amen Amen brother Jim

you're all ready for the for the fire to fall amen okay St John 1412 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father verse 20 at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them you know his sayings you know he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him huh manifest 1 Corinthians Ians 2:6 how be it we wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of the of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to know it but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world into our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory Colossians 26 verse 261 even the mystery which have hath been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus may God a blessing and reading his word shall bow our heads just a

strengthen me Lord and may you get glory for thy holy Child Jesus by pouring out the shakina over everybody in this place tonight in Jesus name we pray and ask the blessing amen and amen you may be seated okay praise God uh you know in St John 17 I think I was trying to make this point the other night I don't think I did cuz uh I haven't heard the tape anything but uh I was trying to strike something that uh verse 21 that they may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they may know that they that they also may be one in us now here's the reason why that the world may believe that thou has sent me in book of Acts 4th chapter 13th verse they took note that they had been with Jesus so therefore they knew indeed that God had sent Jesus Christ because Apostles manifested that the Oneness of God God and man I mean God in Christ and Christ in the apostles would it be a wonderful time on this third phase that we could go out through this message manifes in Jesus Christ that the world may know that God sent Malachi for oh my can we live for that huh and that of the the message already vindicate but they'll know that indeed I have sent a prophet okay you may be seated all right so uh my title is um now brother Theo and brother Frank have already preached part of my message it's all right it's fine help me now my title is Christ in you the hope of glory and my subject is another Ephesians is here for the bride Third Exodus we are going out not another church age brother we going out of here this is the Third Exodus this is Rapture time Resurrection timeall hey all right you may be seated now my inspiration is St John 14:20 at that day ye shall know that I'm in my father and ye in me and I in you now we're not talking about the birth I think you understand it by the all men have struck it and uh and as Jonathan preached the unconditional Covenant there's nothing against you there's nothing against you brother what is your where do you stand brother BR on inv visit Union of Brant he said where are you standing little bran on this Thanksgiving Day this night huh you're standing perfect you never did it in in the first place the invisible Union of bride is the second part of marriage and divorce amen so if that was the invisible the prophet preached the invisible Union of the Bride is it time for the visible Union to be made manifest the visible union he preached that word that word within you now manifest it amen so we're not talking about a birth right amen but the Holy Spirit must come down here for you to ply the token as brother uh uh Underwood said you may be seated you cannot apply the token on the second phase because the day is not the chemical it's the spirit so we're waiting for the Dynamics and then we can apply the token which is the life Faith virtue knowledge temperence patience godance blly kindness there's your token that's how you apply it it's got to be in the church oh now you understand what it is now his very same Spirit you got it okay you may be seated Hebrews chapter 7 part 2 page 359 listen closely as we close and it Calvary God came down and took the body of his own son in which he had lived and he ripped it upon a Calvary his bleeding wounded cut and the spear running there and ripped him apart and his blood gushed out he said father into thy hands I commend my spirit he bowed his head and the Earth shook the Lightning's flashed the Thunders roared God was right in his Everlasting Covenant praise God and he took his dead body from the grave on the first day of the week and brought it up into heaven and sat it there as a high priest as a memorial set in there perfect forever and he sent the spirit that he tore out that body the other part of the contract amen right back down on the church and that church will have to have the same spirit that was in that body or it won't Dov tail with it in the resurrection amen so we are hungering and thirsting for that same spirit oh Hallelujah so a Duff tail we ain't got no time brother we got to get out of here April 19th the federal building was bombed anti-terrorism Act is on the laws are being changed oh don't be caught with your work undone amen the plans they have on the drawing board will overnight be put into effect amen you be just wake up one morning is there may be seated I remember being up in Canada 1970 before I met brother Gabriel let take the family up there to mount chimblo amen and brother Bram said I think on page 58 statue of a perfect man he said now the only thing you do is to throw it back on the gold standard I never understood that way back I said well we're on the gold standard he said only thing you can do at that time is to throw it back on the gold standard and we was on the gold standard at in 1962 so I just said well I I believe it amen then I was in Canada on a Monday morning in August went to the bank the bank was closed it was a bank holiday President Nixon had uh ex-president Nixon had gone and uh told the nation that we're off the gold standard and there the prophet said the only thing you can do is throw it back on the gold standard so where are we at the prophet knew what he was talking about he knew that some president was take us off amen and have all these conditions come up to throw it back on and who has the goal who's coming here October Papa America's broke huh Lord friend or no friend denomination or no denomination father pour out virtue and knowledge Hallelujah I might teach those and pour those virtues in there to the Perfection of the coming of the Son of God we're ready in the hour is here and so is God that's why you're in Indianapolis that's why it's the crossroads we are here amen the British are not coming as Paul said the British are coming the British are coming praise God is here hallelujah hallelujah yes sir okay hey may be seated those two pieces must come perfectly together and this church isn't perfectly just exactly the same spirit that was in Christ you'll never go in the Rapture amen no there's the Everlasting Covenant brother seek it out yourself what's in your heart love the Lord really be sure you're saved don't take a chance on you're gambling we American people love to gamble but don't you gamble on that you be sure that you're right not because you joined church but because you're truly Born Again Christ has come to you in the person of the Holy Ghost hey did you get that Christ has come to you in the person of the Holy Ghost now just compliment you like I'm closing how happy we should be to see now here's a prophet telling the people that the Saints Spirit was in him to see The Same Spirit that was in Jesus Christ right Among Us doing the same thing that he did when he was here on Earth how happy we should be and he goes into a prayer oh how happy we should be went the prophet prayed this brought this promise to us these ministers here have preached it and now we're here and

Jesus Christ is the rain you are right well now it's time for the rain to come down praise God Amen may be seated we do imp part a higher wisdom that is the knowledge of the divine plan previously hidden but it is indeed not a wisdom of this present age nor of this world or of the leaders and rulers of age who are being brought to nothing and are doomed to pass away but rather verse 7 we are setting forth is a uh what we are setting forth is a wisdom of God once hid hidden from the human understanding now revealed to us by God that wisdom which God devised and decree before the ages for our glorification amen he's fixing the set set you out for glorification justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost and setting out in Perfection seven rainbows flashing on the way to the resurrection praise God glorify not the Lord but the glory of the Lord they'll recognize that that you've been with Jesus amen maybe seated and now reveal To Us by God that wisdom which God devised

long with you now I rush home and got my dictionary and so forth and some uh scripture notes began to copy some things down and then I got a weaps dictionary and brother brother BL talking about weap is on on absolute well let's see what it says here about restore to find out the right definition for ReStore to restore means to return to the former owner huh Glory or bring back to the former estate of condition the threefold mystery of God God in Christ Christ in you to restore back to the former condition where you could speak the word hallelujah glory amen and we can enforce a claim to be restored now that's what Webster says the word restore means to bring back to the former owner or to bring back to a former state of condition now our standing is perfect but our state is variable we're up one day and down the next day and we believe we don't believe variable but I will restore sayeth the Lord back like the bride was on the day of Pentecost no more variable perfect State perfect standing walking just a nod from God how did they know there was a nod from God cuz them Seven Virtues was in there that's how they knew ain't a bunch of nonsense here brother we're preaching the word of the Living God to the living bride praise God to set her on fire amen amen bring it back to the former state of condition and if a claim is made on something to make that restoration you can enforce to make it come back to his right place and may God uh bless the feeble wordss now to restore means to bring back or to restore a claim can be enforced not to bring anything back to his rightful owner where it belongs therefore some way went away from his rightful owner and can wander around anywhere but to restore is to bring it back to who really owns it that title deed book you
