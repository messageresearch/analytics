[26:38] hither and I speak about 20 minutes
[26:40] there this is our introduction but I
[26:42] thought that I should play it for you

[26:47] something in here and the very and I
[26:49] brought it back to the people there
[26:51] something has happened here but I'll
[26:53] notice it seems they have gone by you so
[26:56] it's it's poking on here you catch it
[26:59] when you hear it you know what I'm
[27:00] talking about
[27:01] it's that third pull
[27:04] a man's here yes sir

[28:08] couldn't sit down but you don't hear it
[28:11] on the tape but this this part you hear
[28:13] them but as it gets into the message I
[28:15] don't know the brother he divorced the
[28:18] people from probably collect from me and
[28:21] something I know what happened but you

[42:54] seven thunders and met him the first
[42:57] time in February 1976 and he was there
[43:00] and he been through a whole lot so he
[43:04] was come to spy out the land amen
[43:07] but he gave a true report amen for the
[43:12] Prophet said himself in paradox 1961
[43:16] Lord may you break these seals us to
[43:19] enter into Canaan land on the back of
[43:23] the book
[43:24] amen so we all know that the shadow of
[43:28] Joshua 18 was the thunders and because a
[43:33] Caleb that he had already asked for his
[43:35] inheritance and Joseph's sons Manasseh
[43:38] and Ephraim they asked for their a man
[43:41] because of Judah and the scepter the
[43:43] authorities with Judah and Joseph had
[43:46] the land blessed but had to be seated
[43:48] together amen and then the five wise
[43:52] virgins ants were there but seemed like
[43:55] he was still tired and the Holy Spirit
[43:58] ahead moved from Gilgal the place of the

[44:31] mountain you didn't see that what's
[44:36] wrong with you amen how are they sweat
[44:40] to go and possess the land

[1:02:29] may be seated
[1:02:30] hey man praise God amen if you don't
[1:02:37] have the Holy Ghost hit with the Prophet
[1:02:39] saying we believe in justification by
[1:02:42] faith Romans 5:1 we believe that after
[1:02:45] persons being justified by faith he has
[1:02:48] peace with Lord Jesus Christ was him but
[1:02:51] it's possible that that same person
[1:02:52] could have some habits such as drinking
[1:02:55] and smoking and doing things that he
[1:02:57] should not do filthy habit of the flesh
[1:02:59] amen
[1:03:00] then we believe that the blood of Jesus
[1:03:03] Christ sanctifies this person for the
[1:03:06] service of the Lord and thus we believe
[1:03:08] in sanctification according to Hebrews
[1:03:10] 13:12 where Jesus also that he might
[1:03:14] sanctify the people with his own blood
[1:03:16] suffered without the gate and we believe
[1:03:18] that sanctification is taught in the New
[1:03:20] Testament and we believe that the
[1:03:22] hospitable Leafs will live sanctify with
[1:03:24] their wives and we believe that the
[1:03:27] Prophet said don't do no dirty filthy
[1:03:30] things with your lives
[1:03:32] [Music]
[1:03:32] [Applause]

[1:03:40] spirit hallelujah free you can tell that
[1:03:44] man I'm not gonna submit to you
[1:03:52] we believe in sanctification we are not
[1:03:57] no hypocrites in here
[1:04:01] listen here husband you got a dirty
[1:04:04] lowdown spread get in here it gets
[1:04:06] sanctified I get out of the house of God
[1:04:08] [Applause]
[1:04:13] racecar team everybody have a clean
[1:04:15] house here the Holy Spirit knows what's
[1:04:19] going on behind the closed door
[1:04:21] hallelujah yes Sarah
[1:04:23] [Applause]
[1:04:29] we believe in sanctification is taught a
[1:04:32] new Testament not your sanctification a
[1:04:35] man which we're now living and we also
[1:04:38] believe in effort a person has been
[1:04:39] sanctified on clean habit has gone to
[1:04:43] them dirty habits are gone
[1:04:45] [Applause]
[1:04:51] he's a believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:53] and his habits are gone we believe that
[1:04:57] then he's a candidate for the baptism of
[1:05:00] the Holy Ghost not before
[1:05:05] we believe that you get a haircut we
[1:05:09] believe you let down your dresses neatly
[1:05:11] not before are you sanctified hallelujah
[1:05:16] is good you get nothing do you
[1:05:20] understand what I'm saying you're not a
[1:05:24] candidate for the Holy Ghost until
[1:05:26] you're sanctified until the filthy
[1:05:29] unclean dirty low-down spirits are gone
[1:05:33] [Music]
[1:05:34] EEMA
[1:05:38] yes sir hallelujah praise God want to
[1:05:43] get this church clean up in here
[1:05:45] [Applause]
[1:05:49] a man's which comes as a filling of the
[1:05:53] believer and then when the believer is
[1:05:56] just as many times as I have taught it
[1:05:58] like picking up a glass out of the
[1:05:59] chicken yard justification is picking up
[1:06:02] ready to use it with a purpose and heart
[1:06:05] that's what God does to the sin he
[1:06:07] picked us up
[1:06:08] he picked you up for birth for purpose
[1:06:10] and what do you mean walking around here
[1:06:13] that God don't love me the devil told me
[1:06:15] this here he picked you up on purpose
[1:06:18] he picked you up you can take a joke
[1:06:21] born of an ass
[1:06:23] [Applause]
[1:06:27] what are you chase ten thousand demons
[1:06:31] that's a purpose God picked you up or he
[1:06:35] you were dead and sin quicken you
[1:06:40] quicken you
[1:06:42] [Applause]
[1:06:46] [Music]
[1:06:47] [Applause]
[1:06:48] or purpose that he had that's what God
[1:06:53] does to the sinner he is still filthy
[1:06:56] then he's cleansed by the blood of Jesus
[1:06:59] Christ and the word sanctify is a
[1:07:02] compound word which means clean and set
[1:07:05] aside for service in the Old Testament
[1:07:08] the altar sanctified the vessel and it
[1:07:12] was set aside for service excuse me we
[1:07:15] believe that the Holy Spirit is put in
[1:07:17] the same vessel in service that the Holy
[1:07:20] Spirit is not another step of grace but
[1:07:22] more of the same grace that fills the
[1:07:25] believer to the extent where the signs
[1:07:27] and wonders such as the apostolic gifts
[1:07:30] spoken of in first Corinthians 12
[1:07:32] manifests themselves through this
[1:07:34] believer when the Holy Spirit comes in
[1:07:37] to take up the gifts I believe that the
[1:07:39] scripture teaches that gifts in calling
[1:07:41] or without repentance that when we are
[1:07:44] born in this world we are sent here for
[1:07:46] one purpose that is of God and that
[1:07:49] before we are even become adults while
[1:07:52] we are yet children the gift that we
[1:07:54] have of God is in us then and only the
[1:07:57] filling of the Holy Spirit puts these
[1:07:59] gifts into operation but we have them in
[1:08:01] the beginning such as teachers and
[1:08:03] apostles and prophets and gifts of
[1:08:05] tongues and the nine spiritual gifts
[1:08:07] according there now we believe that
[1:08:10] these gifts are in operation today and
[1:08:11] it should be in every church now we
[1:08:13] believe in water baptism in the Branham
[1:08:17] tabernacle by immersing in the name of
[1:08:19] the Lord Jesus Christ which is the
[1:08:21] apostolic teaching of the Bible and may
[1:08:23] all members of us or come as 2008 amen
[1:08:28] or comers to the Branham tabernacle who
[1:08:31] desire such made any time requesting to
[1:08:34] be immersed in the name of the Lord
[1:08:35] Jesus may he consult a pastor if they
[1:08:39] have repented and believe on the Lord
[1:08:40] Jesus Christ have passed the will as
[1:08:42] soon as possible even then if he can
[1:08:44] baptize them immediately this does bring
[1:08:47] them into the fellowship of the
[1:08:48] believers we believe that water baptism
[1:08:51] we are brought into a fellowship
[1:08:53] so many in here are enough fellowship
[1:08:55] but you're not in the body of Christ yet
[1:08:57] Amen you in the fellowship of the seven
[1:09:00] seals seven thunders as to fellowship
[1:09:02] but by the baptism of the Holy Spirit we
[1:09:05] are brought into the members being
[1:09:07] members of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:09:09] which is all over the world and that's
[1:09:12] what you're striving for the night not
[1:09:14] to just be enough fellowship in New York
[1:09:16] in this message but to be enough
[1:09:18] fellowship of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:09:20] and don't you stop and don't you sell
[1:09:23] your birthright and who is this filthy
[1:09:27] flesh you say that I don't feel this and
[1:09:30] I don't feel it as filthiness before God
[1:09:32] when God picked you up for purpose
[1:09:35] quicken you you were dead in your sins
[1:09:38] what do you mean walking around here
[1:09:40] with unbelief what do you mean walking
[1:09:42] around here negative in a negative dirty
[1:09:44] lowdown spirit God said so God said so
[1:09:54] God said so
[1:09:57] praise God God dropped a third pulling
[1:10:01] here you heard me say stand to your feet
[1:10:03] are you insane
[1:10:05] don't you know what that was this is
[1:10:08] Timothy over here and you let that slip
[1:10:11] away like a low praise God but God said
[1:10:16] turn that picture back again put it in
[1:10:20] your face I'm here so I never gonna let
[1:10:26] you forget it and the Holy Ghost is
[1:10:28] another witness and he won't let you
[1:10:31] forget it for he will confirm what I'm
[1:10:33] saying by signs wonders and miracles he
[1:10:38] will back up the minister he'll back
[1:10:40] your brother hunt like he did this
[1:10:41] morning he'll back up by the mean always
[1:10:44] God
[1:10:47] he'll back up these Deacons we don't
[1:10:50] care what you think about the Deacons
[1:10:52] card will pack a bomb
[1:10:54] [Applause]
[1:10:58] we're his goddamn and plenty with nobody
[1:11:01] in here another thing that we believe
[1:11:04] the manifestation of the Spirit is given
[1:11:06] to every man to profit withal and we
[1:11:08] believe that when these gifts and so
[1:11:10] forth are operating the church which we
[1:11:12] covered and desire that the people are
[1:11:15] gifted by the spirit come and worship
[1:11:17] with us
[1:11:17] I think first every member or every
[1:11:20] worshipper of the bram tabernacle she
[1:11:23] being such so much in divine love with
[1:11:26] each other until it was their hearts
[1:11:29] would long for each other now being and
[1:11:31] divine love with what each other doesn't
[1:11:33] mean to go to your brother said you know
[1:11:35] I think brother Coleman is mean that
[1:11:37] ain't divine love that's a devil let me
[1:11:43] say it good that's a demon that will go
[1:11:46] into his brother and speak against me or
[1:11:48] anybody astray that's our devil from
[1:11:50] hell a demon in you speaking out of your
[1:11:55] filthy mouth
[1:11:58] peni yes sir drive it down good getting
[1:12:04] you sanctify it why because I'm crazy
[1:12:06] cuz I want to see you get the Holy Ghost
[1:12:08] I want to see every unclean demon leave
[1:12:13] amen
[1:12:15] oh my prays got into their hearts but
[1:12:19] alone for each other when they have to
[1:12:21] go away to leave each other at the
[1:12:23] service at night I'm a true believer in
[1:12:25] divine love the Apostle Paul said that
[1:12:27] there was the evidence of the Holy
[1:12:28] Spirit by this man all man will know
[1:12:30] what you're my disciples said Jesus when
[1:12:32] you have love one for another and we
[1:12:35] believe that it is the love of God that
[1:12:36] sent Jesus Christ to this earth to die
[1:12:39] for all of us God so loved the world he
[1:12:41] gave His only begotten Son that
[1:12:43] whosoever believeth in him shall not
[1:12:45] perish but have everlasting life
[1:12:48] and they everlasting life is God's own
[1:12:50] life because we become sons and
[1:12:52] daughters of God by the baptism of the
[1:12:55] Holy Spirit which is the seed of Abraham
[1:12:58] and gives us the faith that Abraham had
[1:13:01] when he believed God before he was even
[1:13:03] circumcised see I have the baptism
[1:13:06] I cannot go along with the garbage to
[1:13:09] filth the cursing I can't because I have
[1:13:11] the seed in me and to see to me the word
[1:13:14] for this they cries out against the
[1:13:17] church members it condemns you already

[1:31:35] brother Perez has got something wrong
[1:31:38] with him as we're preparing to pray for
[1:31:41] them sister Silvia Gonzalez had a dream
[1:31:46] Monday January to 6 I was at my place of
[1:31:52] work when I received a phone call from
[1:31:57] my sister she told me that a cloud had
[1:32:01] begun to take place had begun to take
[1:32:04] shape in the sky
[1:32:06] I walked toward the window to look at it
[1:32:10] and I saw when the cloud was shaping up
[1:32:12] and it was like the the one that
[1:32:16] appeared in the days of the Prophet
[1:32:18] suddenly I found myself in a wooden
[1:32:21] house out in the country somewhere I
[1:32:24] came out to the front entrance and they
[1:32:27] are knelt down to pray and to cry for
[1:32:31] joy thanking God for the sign of the end
[1:32:35] time
[1:32:39] there were also several persons around
[1:32:42] me kneeling crying and repenting while
[1:32:46] others pass through unconcerned after
[1:32:51] this experience I stood up and saw
[1:32:54] several airplanes which approached the
[1:32:57] cloud and poured a white smoke over it
[1:33:00] seemingly to cover it and make it appear
[1:33:05] as if it were formed out of the smoke
[1:33:07] from the planes but their attempt was
[1:33:13] unsuccessful and the original cloud
[1:33:16] withstood furthermore I saw women in the
[1:33:22] planes that's who I've been fighting
[1:33:25] fought one this morning so women in the
[1:33:28] planes with spray cans also pouring
[1:33:31] smoke out of the cans
[1:33:35] a little while after the smoke vanish
[1:33:38] you can put this clown out don't you
[1:33:44] ever try a sister to put this clown out
[1:33:48] yes sir mister the crowd has been turned
[1:33:52] I sister Sylvia call the other day with
[1:33:58] this dream I know anything about it
[1:33:59] people with airplanes trying to get up
[1:34:02] higher Pentecostals in airplanes
[1:34:07] Pentecostals airplanes Cheryl Luther in
[1:34:10] a horse and buggy Wesley in an
[1:34:13] automobile Pentecostals and airplanes
[1:34:15] and women up in the airplane with spray
[1:34:18] cans do you mean you did this you
[1:34:22] shouldn't do that poor sister so and so
[1:34:24] women silly women what their mind God
[1:34:29] don't even care what they think you
[1:34:30] can't even find one woman in a thousand
[1:34:32] you find one man in a thought but not
[1:34:34] know women in a thousand that's the
[1:34:38] scorcher and I mean for it to scorch
[1:34:44] because God ain't got no women he's got
[1:34:48] daughters like Sarah bunch of filthy
[1:34:52] women what your filthy churches coming
[1:34:55] in here trying to spray
[1:35:01] [Applause]
[1:35:06] a man praise God I feel the angel in the
[1:35:13] kale
[1:35:15] a little while after the smoke vanish in
[1:35:19] the original crowd was clear as ever
[1:35:22] then at the evening when the Sun was
[1:35:26] setting
[1:35:27] I saw white dove flying with a branch in
[1:35:31] her beak and she landed in the cloud
[1:35:38] position herself in the lower half of
[1:35:41] the cloud facing us the same as the
[1:35:45] cloud the seven rainbow colors was
[1:35:47] behind the Dove shining bright as fire
[1:35:51] and on the right side of the dog there
[1:35:54] were small numbers of letters that I
[1:35:57] couldn't make out after this found
[1:36:01] myself again inside of the house
[1:36:03] together with my sister and my
[1:36:05] brother-in-law
[1:36:06] I had Mohnish them to repent while there
[1:36:09] was still time to do it at this point
[1:36:12] they got up to go my sister left with
[1:36:14] her head bowed and my brother-in-law
[1:36:16] said quote I'll do it when the time
[1:36:20] comes
[1:36:23] then we left as soon as we walked out
[1:36:25] the house it was dark and the cloud
[1:36:28] began to fade can only be seen from the
[1:36:31] center of a man another sister had a
[1:36:34] dream I won't give her name five and six
[1:36:38] after I walked out I went to South
[1:36:40] Africa she had a dream December 21st
[1:36:45] there was fire up in the ceiling of the
[1:36:48] church towards the bank just before the
[1:36:51] balcony it looked like when a fire place
[1:36:55] is burning brother Cowan was preaching
[1:36:57] and as soon as he spoke there was the
[1:37:00] manifestation it look like judgment the
[1:37:04] Spirit would take brother Coleman right
[1:37:07] to the face of the ones called out and
[1:37:10] judgment would strike amen that's what
[1:37:15] I've been doing they going right to
[1:37:16] their faces and I didn't even know what
[1:37:19] hit was the dream I wasn't even here but
[1:37:21] God said look in their faces he said no
[1:37:25] matter how hard their faces he told me
[1:37:28] in Saint Thomas he ZQ he says set your
[1:37:31] face to their faces they are a
[1:37:34] rebellious house and I've done it praise
[1:37:38] God amen and I know where I'm standing
