TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what can we say about the pen Harris convention praise God stand to your feet and salute the Holy Ghost use the one I made it possible amen yes sir you may be seated pinheiros convention what about them buttwater victory amen [Applause] so to my understanding this convention witnessed the following thing as you know my inspiration from me 1974 has been three phases that were hidden in brother and God's God's second coming second coming of the Lord and the street phase of hitting a on page 13 the Lord spoke and told me that these three phases are HID and my second coming and these three phases will hook into Malachi for third pole so he said when you reached so the first one was brotherly love and that was capped orange in 1974 and that started from 1966 and capped off in 1974 nine years and then wholly of decency came in 1975 in Fort Wayne and then that was capped off in 1983 with the outpouring of the baptism of the holy ghost in New York and across the world amen so now the number three is what took transpired and took place in pin Harris nest place in Christ adoption time so can you heard about it for 20-some years but now we're here amen so when we got to pin Harris then it's a time for me to connect it to the third pull and opening of the word the mystery is revealed and then page 304 the seven funds will utter their voices to the roof and that will be on the third phase you see it you know it will utter his voices to you be no more questioning that date at that day you shall know but wait don't get all nervous and flustered sit down a minute this will be preached as a revelation of the Son of Man making you ready for the rapture on his third failures you know Saint Matthew 16 whom the men say I had a son of man I am well they don't know who you are he said I know they don't they don't know it in the message who I am either he said well they think you Jeremiah's one of the prophets he said I know that he said but who do ye individuals say I am he said but who de individuals say I am Elohim dropped down thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God Elohim dropped down March April May June come on come on give me a shout béla him drop down the pin Harris that's what's going on the brother Brian preached on it you may be seated who do you individuals say I am l am drop-down thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God my father Ella him in heaven has revealed this to you not flesh and blood ami Reuben you gotta Reuben [Applause] I feel like getting up here and walk amen praise God hey man Laurey now you understand what's going on you may be seated my father in heaven has revealed this to you not flesh and blood so I can't reveal nothing to you that's why I asked you for your testimonies flesh and blood can't give you nothing I couldn't give it to you for 30 40 years I wanted to know what happened to you Joe where was down when elder him the whirlwind drop down amen sitting there wondering what am I talking about amen Laurie [Applause] you may be seated do you understand how New York what happened in the spring you missed the whole thing amen I even spoke to you about your good self because good self is connected into Joe and you getting a blessing and me being healed [Applause] l ahem don't want your good self because there's Buddha and Hindu and sins and everybody else far better than these Christians pray more worship more do everything else more he don't want that from us he wants that word see that was back with him and that word scene will add faith one word on top of word on top of word on top of worry that's what L AM wants not on good selves amen you may be seated my father in heaven has revealed us to you not flesh and blood so I can't reveal nothing to you I'm free I cannot reveal anything to you no matter where I went you may be seated I went to Europe South Africa South America why did I go there for what did I go there for to contend for the faith that's what I was doing all these years i was contending for the faith that was once delivered to malachi for why did I go there to contend for the faith that's what I went for well praise God seven thunders gives faith for ranching grace that's what he showed me amen god bless you so what's going on here today as we reach our third phase we automatically connect with the third pool brother : what is the third pole the opening of the word the mysteries revealed what mysteries the hidden mysteries revelation 10-7 the mystery of God should be finished do you know we ant today new york PA in july 2004 first corinthians 2 verse 6 Christ as the mystery of God revealed on page 45 he reads the scripture there and he comes on down about Paul saying here I think is the fourth or fifth verse my speech and my decision was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in the demonstrate of the spirit power see there's there's see there's the gospel jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel didn't say go teach you say go preach in other words demonstrate the power and these signs shall follow them just teach them don't do it it takes the actual Spirit Elohim who will be here on a third phase to demonstrate the power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God she changed a man now what not what I can explain away and say he's not the same he is the same if I do that surely it shows me that surely a man tell me that would be showing me that he don't have the revelation the three full revelation of God so then then he hits the first corinthians verse first corinthians 2 verse 6 and howbeit and weakness among you that are perfect and yet we are not with the wisdom of the world but of the princes of this world that come to know it we speak the wisdom of god in mystery and brother Branham says see the threefold mystery of God even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world to our glory which none of the princes of this world knew none of the priests rabbis and so anybody knew anything about it for if they had known it it would have not have crucified the Lord of glory so now we see elohim's back part of his mind I think brother David Thompson said that in the back part of your mind is I think is in three sections back there you get it threefold mystery [Applause] and a 3/4 mystery was sealed by seven thunders and also brother branham on Super Saiyan Southgate 1962 he tied to three full mystery the mystery of God religion ten seven and the seventh under mysteries he tied it all together and he revealed every mystery soul so now we understand now that we have to be mature we have to be full-grown we have to be perfect and then if we are then the threefold mystery will be revealed to us it's it's a three full revelation of the hidden wisdom in a mystery and Christ is that mystery a threefold mystery of God even a hidden wisdom of God it can only come to mature Christians golden brown seeds let me give you a little testimony here 1973 I told before I went down my first time with the family down to Pennsylvania and to find my roots then down in Pennsylvania and went down to Mount Pocono in different places there and enjoyed the pennsylvania countryside and there my friend have sent me a letter we were very used to talk back and forth and some things going on in the tabernacle and he would just write me a letter just see if I had anything to say about it the Lord told me and don't answer that he says then he gave me the scripture this scripture first Corinthians 2 verse 6 how big we speak wisdom among them that are perfect mature so did you catch what I said don't bother with anybody in the message until we come to his day I don't there is [Applause] you understand what I've been doing now and he also gave me maybe seated Jehoshaphat and a ham when Ahab tried to trick Jehoshaphat had he asked Jehoshaphat for his bride rule and he put it on impersonating but the king of Syria they knew he was anyway and they killed him and then the Lord gave me the scripture he said when my people get away from human leaders I will come to him today who is he Elohim will come [Applause] and we see that the human leaders of just about played out totally drying dead shook amen no one knowing they know nothing so it's time for Ella him to come to his people yes sir so now now the street full mystery of God even the hidden wisdom all these hidden mysteries can only come to mature Christians golden brown seeds full grown corns of wheat in the July hot Sun which we in now which is charity which is the dynamics which is Elohim returning in power in the time of life which is sun lit the seven angels Malachi force message mechanics with promise of dynamics remain after sunset and has stayed 28 minutes and it was Sun lit so July hot Sun charity is sunlit [Applause] is also the intelligence-related 22:17 two-spirit new brands they come spiritually mature Christians who are ripe in understanding perfect mature or full-grown no more children ready to become young men to these people we do impart a higher wisdom previously hidden in three full mysteries sealed by seven thunders in the back part of God's mind amen before the foundation of the world on September 20th 1974 God began to reveal this hidden whistie wisdom with the revelation of the seven thunders seven thunders of seven voice of seven Church ages seven years to today 1981 L ahem begins to reveal himself to me I'm just gonna say certain things to my church but there are visitors here so don't say don't take anything out of here friends out of context please amen so September 2nd began a Lord began to speak to me and he told me to study the revelation series Hebrews 7 seals Co D book spoke and read original C adoption and other books Daniel series I begin to study these books in September 1981 I was looking to understand about what is the revelation of the dynamics how do I get it down in New York and then I also want to know how do I preach the Lamb's Book of Life what is the revelation how can I preach it so after he told me to study the books I just read to you I just mentioned then on September 2nd 1981 I just may start with some of you but I'm gonna let you know because this 17 takes to go out with the Elohim inspiration on it and to you brethren that will receive it so I want you to know where that come from and here's where I come from September 2nd 1981 the Lord told me this the Spirit of God shall come upon you and open the scriptures to you listen to you in a way that has never been done listen to any man after my prophet brother William Branham you shall rightly divide my word on the spot with such power that Satan's Kingdom shall literally shake [Applause] that's what's going on [Applause] Ramon praise God you got it amen so you may be seated so now you understand where I come from I do I said what I was studying in Revelation series seven seals Hebrews seal D I was studying all of that amen so then September 20th 1981 he told me the seven Thunder mysteries comes to the bride as the revealed word a seed that will bring forth the miracle September 28 1981 when the Holy Spirit came to me five o'clock in the morning before I preached in the beginning was the word he revealed to me the revelation of Ella him now here it is the revelation of the seven spirits of Elohim being the attributes of God as a thought great supernatural God is the revelation of the dynamics to the mechanics and then he told me at the Lamb's Book of Life is in two parts Ella Hamed as an attribute thought in Ella hem and then is expressed in the logos as a word seed in the logos day after day and then number three it becomes a manifested word the bride in the seven churches in your generation in your season and that's what's going on now on your message to know him from the beginning on page 8 I was speaking here by setting the church in order and that's what's being done today and setting the order and then God said it all in order then September 20th I believe it was August 30th or rather and blessing I will bless thee September 20th seven years to the day from 74 74 the thunders 81 seven years to the day Elohim seven thunders seven spirits but still there's something laying there a revelation then how can we be perfect well them seven spirits is Elohim and you catch the revelation here now so L ahem had to reveal to you that he is the seven spirits now you know how to get back to him so you're only going back to where you were in the beginning way back before there was a beginning and now you know how to get back there on the third phase for the seven thunders were other their voices to you so therefore may be seated catch this so therefore what are you going to do are you gonna sit around again next week do I have to come back in here next week again like this no I won't be here um and I have to come back then here again and guts and you got seven more spirits or you gonna finally make up your mind to die what are you gonna do that's what this weekend is all about and you have to make up your mind it's on you well praise God can we say Amen so starting today we will begin to impart may be seated a higher wisdom to God's elect bride to the perfect the mature or right seat of God with all of the food value in it the seven thunders of page 304 fourth seal will give faith to lift us up into the glory that we had in Elohim and logos oh yes sir I have 17 L am serious tapes to share with my friends and to know him I just read that from the beginning okay the third phase third pole now because the revelation of the dynamics is the seven spirits of Ellingham when I seen that connect with two attributes which forms then I realized that seven spirits seven rainbows came down to the earth condescending and then that was perfection then the only way back is with that perfection seven rainbows seven spirits so that is the revelation of LEM the dynamics are you following me so therefore on the third phase the reflection this is my thought I'm gonna speak on it the reflection of the seven spirits of Elohim as seven living voices in the Omega bride so these seven spirits are gonna reflect back here and seven living voices amen and a form the word image in you to bring you to a perfect man Ephesians 4:13 don't forget now it's got to cap off Joseph's perfection the revelation of it November 10 1964 so that's got to be capped off with Joseph rainbow coat which will be a perfect man so the opening of the word the third pull the mysteries revealed the fivefold ministry will preach the hidden mystery of the revelation 10 7 there's hidden mysteries that have to be preached friends well church do you understand where you are today you say Amen well you understand that you in July in the harvest month and then it and you heard you understood that therefore July is the hot Sun which is charity which is dynamics which is sunlit which is Elohim coming forth in a time of life you understand that in other words you're here are you ready for the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're ready for science one is Americans while we're here and it will be a short quick message and we will remain in July literally all the way to the literal resurrection now you may be seated 1981 was assigned to you of the ellingham inspiration season so therefore 1981 was assigned to us now how could it I should I put it we are going to be possible for somebody to start preaching all of these messages 30 40 50 messages in 1981 we just thought now trying to preach that you take it to next year in the following year so God dropped down and stored away some corn [Music] [Applause] with the LM anointing the faith and circumstances situations had to be here and Satan's the spirits had to be here to attack it and also reveal about who Satan is and so forth you may be seated so as 1981 was a sign therefore it relates back to 2004 because L ahem himself I didn't know how to approach the third pole all through last year are mainly stick leaning in surgery lady in the hospital and my only one thought laying in the hospital was how do I get on that third phase that third pole that's all so I said I'll become approached this way the opening and the finishing of the Seventh Seal I was going through that the whole year and then in February second he told me to go down in the basement and get faith to faith and I did that and then he told me in next week a February eighth to go down in the basement and look for the easter tapes and I found those and then I began to look at 81 and I've seen a tape brother Joseph Coleman then I saw brother Jose Q I said Jose Q there must be can yours I said don't tell me that the Spanish on these tapes and that's how I found out put the tape on and then I found all the rest of the Spanish tapes so God did that himself I knew nothing about it at all forgotten all about it and was even in my mind so he's the one that brought out that 81 tapes catch it now in 2004 he could have brought it up in 2005 or 2006 maybe but he brought it in 2004 and since his for then we had to go to pen Harris the same as we did 81 will be marched over to Jerusalem but this time we hit the third phase and it connected with the third pole the opening of the words of mr. Seville so we are here praise God were here so now we can understand from 81 he may be seated before the beginning in the beginning from the beginning the three things who God is who you are who Satan is in this revelation is what will connect you into way back before you cannot be reborn unless you were there enough as a thought they are the only ones that can be reborn because you had to be there and you had to be in a lamb's book of life as a word see and now you can be reborn and it pleased God amen now listen to tell you something you may be seated because of Adam and Eve we had to come here our bodies laid in the dust and because Adam had the book of life in him which is the theophany and he would have spoke the seeds of God in their generations Adam would have done that but because of the sin of Eve and Adam therefore we had to come through the flesh are you following me could we had to bypass off the Alpha knees come here so what I'm trying to tell you to get rid of the guilt complex on you other words God thought of us in this mine predestinated us called us justified us and already glorified us [Applause] amen and the only reason you came here is because of Adam and Eve so then that means that all the things that you get in your life that has transpired in your lives the only reason that anybody knows anything about it because of Adam and Eve it was very dominating ever been here at all and that's why he justifies you you never did it in the first place that's the only way you can understand it amen you all free and he when the son of man set free is free indeed amen so we're here so you may be seated glory Hey [Applause] that's why God could do that do you understand now that's why the woman at the well he went to her because she was white in heaven and black on air but she was not black on earth she was white on earth also so catched on faith to know who you are amen we want to have a seventh on the revival amen [Applause] okay you may be seated so now as 1981 did it because identified a fire for ministry well that as it did in 81 then 2004 would be now and it'd be a sign of the fivefold ministry a portion of it it meant being identified soul there's your testimony anyway all right so now 1982 will let be assigned Ephesians 4:13 a ministry stepping forward from around the world and people from around the world coming forth some beginning to be adopted they have next shift the Lord tarries will see amen I don't know could be okay today's tape my father working Hitler to network and as I said it was the same day as to know him from the beginning and these two messages are on adoption to camp off the Ella hem series of 1981 in February 1982 was the tent inspiration and open Puerto Rico and the revelation of Ella him given Sarah and Abraham a promise while she was in the tent and returning back and dynamics because he will already was there through Malachi for in human skin he comes back as dynamic sunlit so church are you now on the third phase so church you you are now on the third phase officially and this is a message to everybody ministers elders deacons rushes sown leaders quiet musicians helps governments you're now entering your place of trying and and here is gonna be child training tutoring sanctification instructions and righteousness seasoning correction reproof etc so we've back to the Bible back to the beginning back to the word eat the whole role amen so therefore we are here and I will be because addressing a lot of issues in the church new york and pennsylvania right on the spot just speak right to you can you supposed to be here as a seed of god it's supposed to be a ripe you're supposed to be ready to be drying out with excess moisture so any excess moisture I see I'll bring some hot Sun the word to dry it out [Applause] so yesterday I will be I will be addressing that laid-back you know well you know you know that's been here since 1998 will now leave and as I'm healed and start to clean up Pennsylvania in New York also we are getting ready to build a new church in Pennsylvania I won't have a meetin soon as I'm healed and get down there and I assure you that that a spirit will not be in the church president nor will to be in a new church well amen and you're going to make mistakes now everybody was going to make mistakes Peter was adopted and he made a mistake and he went down to Antioch where they had multi-racial and there and then certain Jews come down there to try to make those Gentiles keep the law and it was even keeping the law themselves so Peter and also Barnabas got carried away with the whole thing there but thank God Paul saved the Church of the Living God to take it away from the legalism kept it under grace amen so many things like that there you will make mistakes too brother branham said it was not Peters doctrine and difference with Paul it was Peters behavior that was in question so place of trying is to sanctify as you know you know without behavior and seasoning and everything else so you're going to make mistakes now and see but because you are in training you will make mistakes so and then no praise demons and all spirits will leave both churches there's something about New York City what will it be it'll be a manifestation of the revelation of November 1064 Joseph's perfection finally Joseph's perfection rainbow coat finally on display a perfect man ephesians 4 11 through 13
