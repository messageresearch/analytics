Jesus Christ praise God God be praised amen amen the anointing of the Lord is in the house this morning I ask the sister to sing that song for me this morning amen the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the Broken Heart to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mour and brother brandham told us that uh of course uh Jesus started the acceptable year of the Lord and the apostles picked it up and right on down through the seven Church ages and Mali 4 restored it back but he said on identified Masterpiece 1964 Yuma he says the second part and the day of Vengeance of our God he said the bride identified Masterpiece will take this forth so praise God perhaps this is that day so that you understand uh what we're preaching about and talking about not just singing a song for n but for a purpose amen 1 Corinthians 13 though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become a sounding brass or tinkling symbol and uh though I have the gift of Prophecy understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profit me nothing charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity Ved not itself is not puffed up doth not behave itself unseeing uh seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never faileth but whether there be prophet phes they shall fail uh whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away second Peter 1 verse 4 whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue

our ears and our hearts in Jesus name we pray and ask the blessing amen and amen well praise God there's the chart again the last time we had it up was the open door amen you may be seated brother woman and to brotherly kindness charity and I have a subject um charity anointed Seven Virtues for a manifestation of the seven Thunders amen understanding what thou hear us now we anointed now right amen April SEC April 6 uh been very strange season been sick and weary and been uh remodeling my house and my wife and I have been staying over to Jonathan's house over almost two months now just back and forth and so much stress and everything and remodeling and going back and forth and very tired and no time to study or whatever and didn't exactly know what I was going to do and but uh on April 4th the Lord spoke to me and um and told me gave me the message then came Jesus after Easter and then I still didn't know what I was doing just moving by faith then April the 6th on a Saturday uh he spoke to me twice in the morning the seven Thunders or the Seven Virtues Of The Seven Church ages and then it came in my heart I said well now I know that I said what uh does that does it mean something else and then he says and to brotherly kindness add charity for June 9th and that's what he that's what he told me so I didn't know what it meant so uh I believe on one of the messages to know him from the beginning I just said those words I said I'm saying for a purpose I was still looking for the inspiration myself amen so on June 9th 1974 uh brotherly kindness was birthed into us or from from the message and of some have compassion and from June 9th 1974 to June 9th today 1991 is 17 years and on June 1st uh just a week or so ago um I was just wondering um what was I supposed to do oh I know what I left something out on May was it May 11th uh just still didn't know what I was what I was supposed to preach and Saturday morning morning he told me Temperance and he showed me I had some notes there and immediately I knew I had to preach patience and godliness but I couldn't figure out where was I supposed to preach godliness at because he had already told me from the 28th of April through June 16th that brother o blade and I were supposed to share eight Sundays to set the captive free be a jubilee for 50 days so I'm hoping that some are going free that's what he told me amen that people would go free and so then he did that then he later he tells me on June 1st uh um no he told me that uh uh that I had to speak on uh Temperance and patience but I couldn't figure out where godliness then he told me on Wednesday June 5th so then on June 1st um I just Med meditating like and um the Holy Spirit spoke to me and told me to add another message I said add another message and then uh I said well I didn't think I had to go any further than faith on Easter and then came Jesus virtue and then April 28th knowledge to know him from the beginning so I thought I was finished preaching on the virtues with faith virtue and knowledge and then on May 11th that's what he told me preach on Temperance come and Dy so instantly I knew I had to preach on patience and godliness and June 9th he already told me on April the 6th to brotherly kindness and charity so June 1st he spoke again and said add another message said add another message now I could hardly preach on Wednesday and then he spoke back and says from the scripture enter godliness brotherly kindness he says separated you always preached uh to brotherly kindness a charity two or three times maybe and he says but that's to be separate so preach on brotherly kindness Friday and I did amen how I got in here I don't know but uh I I made it then I had to to today uh get inspiration for today which he'd already told me he said just change a little bit and to brotherly kindness charity just the way it says in the scripture so that's what I'm doing this morning amen so and to brotherly uh into godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity so he says separate and make these two messages thus making me preach eight virtues amen and then going from April the 7th virtue to to charity today so here we are so I had to preach Wednesday and Friday night to finish my course on June 7th amen I was finished brotherly kindness well praise God it's been tremendous 17 years trying to uh take these promises praise God and so they today is June 9th and I'm I'm just supposed to preach on charity and you don't have to get all stiff and one what's going to happen cuz it never comes that way so you might as well enter in like you did Wednesday and Friday don't sit and try to squeeze and wonder what's going to happen how is it going to happen and when is it going to happen and will it happen to me and how will I get it and on and on and on and on and on just a die and enter into the anointing say thank you Lord praise God but don't go there stay away from here cuz I don't even know myself so amen so amen I do do not know I've been going by inspiration amen so I preached to 7th virtue June 7th you may be seated and to Godliness brotherly kindness and so in 17 years on June 7th preaching on the seven thunders of the seven voices seven Church ages seven virtues brotherly kindness adoption Perfection promises etc etc etc all promises that uh was supposed to keep you alive amen 25 years or so praise God and then mainly the last 17 years and then uh the April inspiration speaking two times the seven Thunders or the Seven Virtues the seven Church ages he did not explain this statement to me and I still don't quite know what he mean CU I know what it means but what does he mean for it now I don't know I hope he'll show me today praise God Amen so maybe I will find out today why that was spoken to me me praise God the seven Thunders are the Seven Virtues Of The Seven Church ages after this day I hope to get a little rest and then get some inspiration for making Georgia so you pray for me huh but it's been very rough I'm kind of favoring my side here and just totally blown out amen but I had to do this here and then um the last three and a half years from 1988 June 3rd L here received for you has been harder trials than the other part so for three and 1/2 years to June that's three and 1/2 years of harder trials that I had to go through sick and weary and diabetes and everything else but I made it to June 7th amen by the grace of God so we go to the eighth message I never did this before I don't think I remember 1974 I preached the Capstone of love amen so but I didn't preach directly on charity this is the first time I believe I'm doing this amen all eight together praise God so we go to the eighth message I believe this is the first time doing it this way and to brotherly kindness charity now remember amen charity never faileth everything else will fail the world will fail the country will fail fa the the president Kings and potentates all

the uh some kind of society and give you a good will and give you some clothes and so forth like that and old shoes we're not talking about that kind of Charity amen we talking about Divine love aapo

truthful knows how to be silent full of trust always present always present sure it could be standing that way and you walk up it turns around it's present regards of what happens right there instant spontaneous now one thing you cannot do charity never faileth it can never fail we can have everything uh uh uh uh listed in the ver first three verses here of Corinthians have everything in there praise God and though we speak with tongue of men and angels and have not charity praise God I am become a sounding brass of tinkling symbol though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries though you understand the mystery of the Rapture and you don't have charity It Don't Mean a Thing to you though you understand all Thunders and all these things it means means nothing to you unless you have charity praise God amen amen though you have all Faith seven Thunder Faith Rapture in faith and have not charity I am nothing oh praise God and though I besto all my good of feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profit me nothing well what are we going to do we we're going to uh now therefore give me this mountain we're going to die out we're going to be born again we're going to add to our faith Hallelujah we got no more time to hang around here we know what this message is now we have knowledge to understand it now praise God oh my would you like to have charity how many like to have charity in here praise God Amen well you can is your promise for this age is is already Vindicated by Malachi 4 the rampt is already Vindicated the new city is Vindicated it's not maybe will it be what is it future home in the brown is already Vindicated it's in your heart already it's on the tape spoken word books is already Vindicated This Promise of Charity is Vindicated already may be seated now remember the Seven Virtues must absolutely be birthed in you before charity will ever seal them up in you for service and you and you can't even get virtue with without first being born again so we have seven human virtues we ain't talking about those now see and number two these Seven Virtues must be uh uh scripturally proven to be in you they must be tested you know your Temperance must be tested your patience and so forth must be tested amen and your knowledge must be tested to understand who's in the message and what is the message hallelujah praise God amen see and you know one thing you know that God cannot fail God cannot lie God heals God seals knowledge amen oh there must be birth in you before the Holy Spirit as Charity can come upon you and seal you up see you add these Seven Virtues until the complete statue of Christ is made manifest then the Holy Spirit comes upon it and seals it as one body praise God amen well Hallelujah on the guide page 16 uh brother BR say what about the Holy goes into church he was speaking about the Instinct of the Ducks to go south in winter time uh when the cold comes they go south to louisian and Texas for the rice and so forth he said what about the Holy Ghost in the church the Instinct you know it ought to lead us from old formalities and uh Creeds and things into a glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost where there is virtue knowledge patience and guidance in the Holy Spirit now what he's telling you the Holy Spirit himself descended from heaven with a shout and he came in the form of mechanics and Dynamics as promises together and then that was the guide and the prophet released that then that should have led us from 1966 to Virtue and to knowledge and to Temperance and to patience and to godess and brotherly kind and maybe today the Holy [Applause] Ghost huh all 25 years and maybe today the charity will pour out because the uh the Holy Ghost is inside of the Holy Ghost you understand so is patience and all the rest of us inside oh church that's what we need to today that's what I am dedicated to on this third phase starting from June 9th today praise God Amen so therefore the ministers commission and all of us is my commission anyway and the rest of them supposed to be statue of a perfect man page 59 quoting back to uh second Peter 1 whereby given to us exceeding and great precious promises do you now understand the promises they were given by Malachi 4 and he left what did he leave there the promises and many sit here and they sad they don't understand it's a promise God gives a promise Noah is going to rain I promise you rain now I suppose Noah got all nervous and excited in 10 years where's the rain 20 years got mad 50 years evil 75 years stop preaching it walked away but Noah stagger not praise God he said it will rain amen there will be a statue of a perfect man amen there will be a glorious baptism of the Holy Ghost where there is virtue and knowledge and Temperance I don't care how long I have to PR preach it it will happen praise God how long will you preach it until the last one is Seal with Charity that's when I'll stop until then that's my commission may be seated now we have escaped what are you doing in here you escaped the [Music] world that's what you're doing in here you escape the World by these great these exceeding great and precious promises that you might be partakers you just didn't escape the world come in here for for what to be partakers of his divine nature for a purpose God has called you to Virtue in Glory Hallelujah to partake of his nature through the promises he may be seated having escaped the corruption the prophet listen to that that is in the world through lust the corruption comes through the people lusting in the world over desires for money and women and sex and all kind of things that's what's in the world corruption but we escape [Music] that that's enough to sit down for 10 years and say hallelujah praise the Lord thank you Jesus for escaping the corruption not sit around all sad Hallelujah It Will Rain yes sir you may be seated lust for money lust for big things Lust For popularity see these are overd desires uh uh these things are dead to the believer we don't care a tent or cleage why should I care live or die sink or drown this is the thing that I'm interested in the kingdom of God whether I maintain my home whether I maintain my family whether I maintain whatever it is is let me maintain Christ the hope of glory Build Me Up Oh Lord right here see oh Lord into this let Christ be my head let working through me on my Foundation my faith down there amen that's in him let virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness work in me oh lord is my prayer I don't care live or die sink or drown denomination no denomination friend or no friend see why preach the way I preach I ain't got no friends okay I got to preach the word amen they all walk away praise God let that work in me now let Christ's virtue his knowledge pour out let charity come forth and pour out virtue pour out knowledge the seed is already in there when you put them seeds in there April 7th 28th May 12th May 26 amen put them in there June 5th June 7th the seeds are in there Hallelujah when it happened then came Jesus 17 years faith faith faith faith 17 years later then came Jesus now come back again with them virtues again and now something's going to happen now praise God all that group is together now praise God hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God the glory of God is in the temple the anointing is upon you oh hallelujah praise God God be praised amen you understand it now minds are coming open praise God hallelujah you may be seated let it pour out that I might be able to teach those for God has said it in the church Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists all for the perfecting and now the six message on Wednesday you catch it on there and bringing all these virtues into it to that Perfection of the coming of the Son of God oh praise God God be praised my that Perfection of the coming of the Son of God Amen and the Lord come with a shout and a voice and a trunk that Perfection yes sir let it Pour Out Lord oh Hal Hallelujah the guy says that charity is a wonderful glorious baptism of the Holy Ghost where there is Faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience godl and brotherly kindness and the Holy Spirit so that means that if that wonderful glorious baptism of Charity would pour out today immediately those seeds would receive Faith amen and those that already have a birth would be refilled and then they would pick it up they begin to end virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience Hallelujah they're coming on now praise God they're shaking the Earth Hallelujah glory to God Amen may be seated and the Holy Spirit see the Holy Spirit itself back in the church now we know that the holy spirit is Christ the anointing amen like sister Pharaoh saying for us this morning the anointing amen now let's go to my subject amen let's get to my subject here charity anointed Seven Virtues for a manifestation of the seven Thunders wouldn't that be wonderful three questions I want to ask amen I want to answer number one what is the anointing number two how do we receive the anointing and number three After we receive the anointing what do we become amen [Applause] I pause let you think on that now Sila means pause and think on this all right now questions uh Cod book but I have the the old one book two questions and answers the old green series but you pick up in your Cod book I think it's the same page anyway well before we do that now let's nail down the fire4 ministry cuz a lot of people say that there is no fire4 Ministry in the message let nail down the bride and the church and charity as that which is perfect has come okay and brother BR answered the question so I don't know what is the question what's the confusion Amen on page 87 I've done this before but I think the day maybe to strike home amen now there's many questions here well will the bride will this the church see you can't Divine what they are the bride is the elected of God the church goes through that's the ones that says whosoever will let him come but the bride is elected of God so now you want to get get in before the spirit comes upon the bride and the spirit and the bride say come you want to get in before that because whosoever will let him come and that's a church that goes through a tribulation period so we ain't just coming here for nothing we're trying to get in and be positionally placed cuz you can see what's happening there over in Europe there brother Antony was telling me his father told him that July believe they're getting together on the money and the whole thing uniting and letting Russia come into it in Europe over there so brother things the clock is ticking amen praise God now see that that's the on that says whosoever will let him come but the bride is the elected of God it's elected for the bride to be in here predestinated they're happy to be here they know they're going to be sealed they're not funny and walking around all strange not the bride no they elected predestinated of God they're always the same yes so not in and out up and down they they're there once that light strikes that seed they not going nowhere [Applause] praise God Amen husband and wife sit together Stand Together praise God and they stay together amen praise God now now uh there's five there is these are right in a row Here There is five offices elected of God for God has said in the church Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists God did that man has deacons and so forth and everything else but you see uh but God said in the church for the prop of the church can't Divine it a lot of the people the message get mixed up with a Elder app to teach and a real fivefold Minister Pastor they don't know the difference and that's where all the problems come in at see if that man's a p in the fire for ministry that's Christ in there the ministry of Christ not just somebody in the message running around because there's so much knowledge to spout out anybody could preach in this message here amen but the anointing where's the anointing Hallelujah it breaks the yoke upon the people it doesn't bind them it breaks it Hallelujah sets some free because it's Christ in them setting the people free by the word hallelujah you may be seated glory to God can't Define it so we understand it now there is a fire for Ministry well then I can I start my my commission pouring in the virtues do you receive me as a pastor after all 17 years laboring do you believe it's the truth then stay with it praise God Amen okay now the Holy Spirit I'm sing about today now the Holy Spirit when it comes it it it is a witness unto you that this word is right now you had this word for 25 5 Years and we're looking for this Holy Spirit this anointing to come down here today to witness to you that this word is ranked and God confirms his word with signs and wonders and miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah the Holy Ghost will testify and you will testify hallelujah praise God he amen now you got it the prophet brought the word with the promise of the Holy Spirit to follow the word and whereever you preach that word by Revelation the Holy Spirit follows that word sing zing zing wherever it goes at somebody block it off it goes right over top of you praise God it goes right behind you in the seat behind you goes right through you praise God you you have no receptacle to hold it amen yay amen you may be seated now the Holy Spirit when it comes it is a witness unto you see that this word is right the word for today not the word for Luther the word not for Moses we witness it's the truth see it's another day that's why we are preaching this here I'm looking for the Holy Spirit to confirm it Hallelujah Now 1 Corinthians 13 says this when that which is perfect is come and I read the scripture that which in which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things are jumping up and down like a kid and trying to talk in tongues and all these other things uh when that which is perfect and here what he says and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication that's charity that's the word but it come in Dynamics and mechanics and the Dynamics is supposed to confirm to you that the mechanics is right then it's charity that's Christ hallelujah praise God then that which is in part is done away with always little interpretations beside this Pentecostal stuff all these interpretations is done away with in the message Len I think this I think that done away praise finish praise God Amen yes sir praise God Amen when I was a child I speak as a child I understood as a child but when I become a man I put away childish things amen I go to preaching and then don't get to these things yes sir okay now now what now question number one praise God uh what is the anointing what is it amen okay um would you see the church where am I at here uh okay here we are um what is the anointing page 101 amen 101 in the book here okay now and now what was that other question I get so wound up in these I forget the things uh what the things were one of them was was I they asked brother Brown was he the son of man here it is I believe the son of man see they can't understand that God could be Veil that Prophet they don't get it you know and not Jesus skin but the the skin from Genesis 18 human skinin see they don't get it you see that so they say he is the son of man no the son of man was revealed in him that's what the scripture said so man would be revealed well the Holy Spirit the word it's got to have a body to come into can't come into that piano over there praise God Amen so it came in Malachi for his body amen okay I forget what the uh here it is I believe the son of man or was the pillar of fire the son of man no now watch the pillar of fire is the anointing you got it now and Christ is the anointing amen now now that pill of fire is the logos that went out of God the logos which is actually the attribute of the fullness of God you see this is now we we're preaching and people are going and coming see but what they're doing they don't know see they're rejecting the fullness of the atonement now many in the message will take the atonement in part and you wonder well why don't they do this here why don't they do that well they don't takeing it in part but a Brian is going to take it in his fullness so there's a big difference amen see so yeah and see the attribute you other words you taking all of the logos amen the attribute of the fullness of God when God become into a form to where it could be seen it was the anointing of the great spirit that went forth amen coming down like seven rainbows condescending yes sir coming down God the Father the logos that was up over Israel he was holy could not bear sin there had to be a offering right in Eden then that logos become flesh and dwelt Among Us and where the Loos dwelt in a human body which was the sacrifice amen oh praise God yes sir the pillar fire the L did you pick that up now now Jesus said I come from God and I go to God is that right after his death burial and resurrection and Ascension when the body was taken up to is sit at the right hand of God now I don't mean God's got a right hand God's a spirit but at the right hand means in power and authority of God that in the that name everything in heaven is named after it and subject to it everything in the earth is named after it and subject to it a name above all names Jesus Christ amen now this logos this logos that was in him which was the spirit of God the anointing yes sir through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons of God which is Anointed with the same logos you anointed if you have the Holy Spirit with that same Locos a part that Locos come into your being his being come in you praise God you changed you can never be the same anymore oh hallelujah praise God yes sir now on the day of Pentecost they come down that pill of fire and broke apart like that and tongues of fire set upon each of them not their tongues but tongues of fire set upon them an elected selected group identified by this pill of fire showing that God has separated himself into man do you get it God the logos separating himself into man God not in one person he's in the church Universal amen that's the reason Jesus said the works that I do shall you do more also more now I know the King James versin says greater but the right translation there is more than this shall you do got more bride to do it with God was bottled and confined in one man Jesus Christ but now he's bottled and confined in the whole Universal Church of the Living God I got God in this bottle praise God you got God in your bottles in your wine skins it's is giving you stimulation of the Revelation oh it's soft skins pliable skins not old wrinkle up skins praise God it might burst if you get any new wine can't take it Hallelujah acts 238 skins that can shout and give and move and say hallelujah praise the Lord not don't wrinkle up dry skin you put some Revelation in there burst open can't take it I don't believe that praise I know you don't believe it praise

which he's coming soon to claim the body now that's L he's coming soon Amen to clean the body but first he comes with a shout and a voice and then the Trump and dead in Christ Rises then we see him and Malachi 4 says the Behold the Lamb of God hallelujah it's right in front of you amen living for that day all else means nothing hallelujah praise God back to the headship again which he's coming

that's him l e Corporal body Jesus Christ amen and now now brother BR says I am not he he's answering the question I am his servant and the pillar of fire is not he it's in spirit form and is called the Holy Spirit pillar fire and we have a part of it if we have the Holy Ghost in us of that Holy Spirit and he's come down the last days by the word together bright together universally by one message praise God into one body Oh Glory to God Amen now I am not he I am his servant and the pill of fire is not he it's in spirit form see which was upon the son of man and then he went up and sent down his spirit in the upper room and it's been down through all the apostolic ages and the Seven Church ages and come right back and his fullness released by Malachi 4 CU he brought back the full word and now we can have the full Holy Ghost oh Hallelujah I know what I'm talking about praise God charity anointed Seven Virtues amen for a manifestation of the seven Thunders amen now I'm not he is in spirit form which was upon the son of man has come now to anoint sons of man to bring back a Ministry now you understand the ministry of Jesus Christ now this charity that's to be loosed is loosed for what to bring back a Ministry his ministry oh Hallelujah bring back a Ministry just exactly like he said it would be in order for the head Lov and the rest of the body to connect together you got it now he ties it into the pyramid just like the pyramid as Enoch built and we find that in the pyramid they never did get the headstone on it why The Headstone Yet to Come The Headstone Yet to Come the seven steps in the pyramid now watch we'll go through that someday and i' just like to show you how it really is perfectly with the scripture all these guys that come against the Thunders and virtues well he said he'd go through it one day the Holy Ghost would and he show you this perfectly with the scriptures but it's a revelation until he goes through it not to everybody amen praise God so they don't understand it amen so now that now that great Diamond see L could not settle down there in Luther cuz it was Luther was too wide and then as it come in the westle is still too wide and brotherly kindness was still too wide you looking at it so then he had to drop a Ministry called the Holy Spirit and love will only fit into the Holy Spirit it won't fit into brother kindness only in the Holy Spirit brotherly kindness with all the virtues in it must pick up the Holy Spirit it must catch the Capstone on the seventh step now it's death to go in there but morai like I said the other night told you how to dress Esther if I perish I perish but my people hymon the World Council is after them so what am I going to do and Mori told me what to wear and how to dress and it was a law of of the king then at that time in Persia that you could not come in to see him unless he sent for you even though you were one of his wives so Esther knew she didn't have any command to come in there may be seated so therefore she said and and Mori told her well you have to do it are they going to hmon is going to kill these Jews here all your people so she put on all that uh morai told her to put on and then she walked and she was beautiful the King was he was gone he looked and he says uh uh what do you want Esther unto hand for my kingdom and he put the scepter forward Hallelujah can you imagine that charity drops down here maybe in 1991 and a lot of these people in this message try to approach charity the king without these uh virtues here with some little interpretation and mean and mad and putting people out of the message and how they going to approach charity when I just went through the things that he is not puffed up and beareth all things hope at all things praise God and how these guys going to approach charity huh with their strange Revelations saying the virtues is not there was way back there somewhere because they don't have a life that's why they can't preach it they don't have it how can you pre what you or you can't be what you ain't praise God you can't produce it they cannot produce it they don't understand that you you are is a battle it's a revelation you fall down a thousand times but you get up I'm going to have it I'm going to have it praise God Amen so come on Esther put on your seven virtues and come in to see the king Hallelujah he'll give give you the scepter thus sayeth the Lord oh hallelujah praise God you may be seated yes sir now that's Now understand that stone not going to fit down there will not fit down there on the bottom Foundation neither will it fit on the second on the third it only fit on the top foundation you know that's Joseph Perfection right Amen on the top uh when the entire building has become fitted to the stone and it drops that Holy SP spirit in there to do the fitting oh praise God has become fitted to the stone and Jesus cannot come until the church a body of Believers and the ministry that he once left there it is Holy Spirit Ministry on the early Apostles and on Malachi 4 you got it now amen the ministry he once left will have to be the same then as it was then and then that brings then is a resurrection them without us is not made perfect Paul said Hebrews 11 without us they cannot be perfected they must have this ministry to raise up the Lutheran Wesleyan and all of them down through their ages when that come when that that part where the Eagles gather just as the carcass as the eagle will be gathered the question was oh it's just perfect I hope that answered the question well praise God we understand it you know what the anointing is now the pill of fire oh the Holy Spirit praise God Amen now we know that this holy spirit is coming here for purpose is is bringing a back a Ministry of Charity and the purpose is to raise up the dead to be perfected so we can connect with love Lov in the air oh Hallelujah can't you live for that amen connect together and ties the anointing pfy into the pyramid amen just like the pyramid amen so therefore that Capstone will only fit on the top amen Jesus cannot come back until and he is Lov on your chart the Min of Jesus Christ will have to be here in order to raise the dead and the resurrection then comes Jesus as love Corporal body in the Rapture amen okay or church we need charity today do we need charity for charity

Jesus comes down and sets himself at the head of the church and then he will Resurrect The Church being his own body so he come down as a she out through the prophet with the message and that message
