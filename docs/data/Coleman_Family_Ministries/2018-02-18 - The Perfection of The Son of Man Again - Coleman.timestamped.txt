[1:49] thought that we find these Devils in the
[1:52] name of Jesus Christ we find these
[1:54] church members that won't give praise or

[2:27] seed of God that's for this pain
[2:30] hallelujah may you pour the water
[2:32] charity upon the sea in spite of all the

[2:38] powers in spite of all the misled
[2:41] misguided spirits hallelujah praise God
[2:46] may you seal the people today may you

[2:52] praise God
[2:54] may you pour out your Holy Spirit in
[2:56] Jesus name we pray amen and amen
[2:59] you may be seated
[3:01] I'd like to take out a title the
[3:03] perfection of the son of man again
[3:06] now notice the word again and my subject
[3:09] is the dynamics and the mechanics are
[3:11] together for the bride's day I got three
[3:15] questions to ask amen
[3:17] what is the perfection of the son of man
[3:19] number two how do we get this perfection
[3:22] and number three is it that it's a time
[3:24] of life for the token though the three
[3:27] noble questions and only the scriptures
[3:30] and a revealed word for this day can
[3:32] answer this here now praise God amen now
[3:39] I know no man after the flesh seated now
[3:46] the bride must recognize her position in
[3:49] the word for this Dame and get in step
[3:51] with her message and her season you know
[3:54] what is the vision for this day
[3:56] recognizing your danis of message on
[3:59] page now I'm just paraphrase did you
[4:01] know what it is just bringing it back
[4:03] for this of climax the 11th hour workers
[4:06] they were supposed to receive the same
[4:08] penny as they receive on the day of
[4:10] Pentecost and a penny that they receive
[4:13] then what did they have on the day of
[4:15] Pentecost listen they had a
[4:17] manifestation of the perfection of the
[4:21] Son of Man
[4:24] the son of man Jesus Christ had revealed
[4:28] himself in prophecy and spoke seed
[4:32] promises into to his disciples but on
[4:37] the day of Pentecost they had to take
[4:39] note that they had been with Jesus I
[4:44] want to ask you a question why because a
[4:47] perfection of the Son of Man was in them
[4:51] the same length the same signs the same
[4:57] wonders the perfection of the Son of Man
[5:03] hallelujah
[5:05] Laurie the only difference was a son of
[5:09] man himself did the sign of this
[5:10] treatment but other than that they had
[5:13] their portion of the pillow fire failed
[5:16] and Peter unveiled a mighty God page 41
[5:20] the pillar of fire was failing Peter
[5:23] like in Moses it was a word for their
[5:26] pain
[5:27] the pillow fire was in God's flesh for
[5:31] that day the church and that day has
[5:34] returned packed in the last days the Son
[5:39] of man has revealed himself again in
[5:42] Malachi 4 all praise God any promise to
[5:47] return back Sarah
[5:50] come on Sarah don't you laugh in a tent
[5:54] I will return unto thee according to the
[5:58] time of life I will be veiled in your
[6:01] flesh like I was on the day of Pentecost
[6:06] you'll get no more sign in the message
[6:08] now I care for reveal the sign of the
[6:12] ascertainment the only sign you'll get
[6:14] you'll see a prayer with the same life
[6:17] same time same oneness God in flesh
[6:25] various car hey you may be seated
[6:31] do you know what the same penny is now
[6:33] huh the perfection of the son of man
[6:38] again that's the penny or a praise God
[6:46] in a prize vision and recognizing
[6:48] today's message
[6:49] the first c-prime came in to review a
[6:54] man she was marching all in order and
[6:57] then come a church into review a filthy
[7:00] church and brother brass all my god it's

[7:15] bunch of no praise church members can't
[7:20] even praise God

[7:45] again in evening time and the message
[7:48] was just keep her in step until she's

[8:19] brain the Spirit of God which is the
[8:21] word of God my word is spirit and length
[8:25] we'll put the people in her place why
[8:27] because she will recognize her position

[10:33] happen to pin Harris when that
[10:35] revelation is perfectly in harmony Lord

[10:44] God expresses through his word by the
[10:47] same action the same things that he did
[10:49] making his word manifest oh if the
[10:53] church only knew its position it will
[10:58] one day then the rapture will go when
[11:01] when it knows what it is when it knows
[11:04] that it is that it will do the it will

[13:41] again to manifest itself when perfection
[13:45] comes in not just the birth when the
[13:47] birth coming it was gifts but when
[13:50] perfection drops in there comes the word
[13:55] then it's word in spirit and then
[13:58] spiritus charity to water seven thunders
[14:02] seed where that's the secret the word is
[14:06] in the prime with the mind of Christ of

[14:31] thus saith the Lord my wife blaring air
[14:34] I shall open then I speak it back
[14:38] Laurie now perfection is here back to
[14:45] the word maybe seated to manifest itself
[14:46] see friends is not to shock that was
[14:49] Hagar I mean I was just the Blee was
[14:51] Hagar and Sarah was a tassel and Mary
[14:54] wasn't shocked and Mary produced the
[14:56] true spiritual seed the Word made flesh
[14:59] now when the word is made fresh again
[15:01] didn't see time
[15:04] do you understand the sign on Halloween
[15:07] when all those spirits was loosed on
[15:09] Halloween on all demon night praise God
[15:14] they were loosed when that happened that
[15:17] was a sign is see turn again back to the
[15:22] see the cedars are green the greens of
[15:24] mechanics Oh hallelujah praise glory to
[15:30] God
[15:31] yes sir you mean is actually see time
[15:36] just the word in the spirit really to
[15:40] 22:17 the spirit on the word the brown
[15:43] dust sayeth the Lord thus saith the Lord
[15:46] then ours here now well I don't feel ok
[15:49] what you don't feel is here now
[15:51] [Applause]
[15:54] I'm waiting to see it Prescott now
[15:57] Pentecost maybe see the represented Mary
[15:59] the last stage of the plant and now she
[16:02] was not the seed now I notice yet the
[16:06] life where the seed was in her just seen
[16:08] her not mature yet
[16:10] so therefore the shock had to hold it
[16:12] glory and the in turn the entire seed
[16:15] had not come forth yet and all of the
[16:20] life from the shuck forms in the seed
[16:24] word again so therefore before the
[16:29] dynamics could strike the mechanics all
[16:32] of the life that was in this shock had
[16:35] to come out in form into the seven
[16:37] thunders seed wearing and then the
[16:42] others that will come bless Laura is
[16:44] blessed all those who are not here these
[16:46] last ten years and they will believe
[16:48] without seeing
[16:50] EEMA they'll be blessed and God sent
[16:54] somebody with this
[16:56] God sent somebody down to Tulsa amen as
[16:59] a representative of those who will come
[17:05] amen and they already are first base
[17:10] Emma we touch bases pin has be second
[17:14] base Easter third piece tell us a home
[17:20] Laurie now praise God now she was not to
[17:25] see and the life of the sea was in her
[17:27] and all of the life from the shuk forms
[17:30] in the seat again the life of the seat
[17:33] passes through the plant in three stages
[17:37] so therefore those three stages only had
[17:40] the life passing through their bodies
[17:43] was not actually the green but in this
[17:48] day your bodies your mechanics is
[17:53] actually the green how do you know that
[17:58] and so much that your green seed word
[18:02] will be changed
[18:07] because the stalker not being a
[18:09] resurrection to be changed
[18:11] neither could a tassel neither could
[18:14] have shot
[18:14] can you imagine God giving us chuckle
[18:17] glorified party cannot if they was in
[18:21] the shock age with the Holy Ghost they
[18:23] went to heaven but this day they'll walk
[18:27] on the earth
[18:34] to know that we ourselves are the green
[18:38] the the seed word itself
[18:44] what a revelation oh my wonderful the
[18:51] fourth stage may be seated
[18:53] is the seed word itself the mechanics of
[18:56] the word again like the first seed
[18:59] Church and when you begin to claim your
[19:01] promises of the seed word in say I am a
[19:04] father one and preached all these seven
[19:08] thunders and promises and Joseph
[19:09] perfection and adoption then that shot
[19:12] goes away you know why because the ship
[19:18] knows it is not to seed green body
[19:25] [Applause]
[19:27] but you know you are
[19:29] [Applause]
[19:32] predestinated caught predestiny you for
[19:36] this age to believe these impossible
[19:40] promises impossible impossible
[19:45] no with God nothing shall be impossible
[19:47] is anything too hard for the Lord
[19:51] cheer up stop laughing in the tent the
[19:55] peril of God shall come upon your body
[19:58] and change you
[20:05] a power of God gave Sara body to receive
[20:11] Isaac Delp Alki will give you a body to
[20:16] receive Isaac
[20:21] Gloria hey man so when you be gold when
[20:26] you begin to preach I am a father one
[20:27] these shucks Devils coming against you
[20:30] because they know inside of them as
[20:32] nothing there's no witness in them that
[20:34] they are anything so when you preach
[20:38] seven thunders of perfection did they
[20:40] have no revelation of perfection they
[20:43] afraid so therefore they just like just
[20:47] leave it alone
[20:48] don't appreciate sunders in Joseph's
[20:50] perfection in adoption and then they
[20:52] pull away from it
[20:55] amen and brother Browns he'll try and do
[20:58] God's everything against his will in
[21:00] Shreveport he said first they will
[21:01] receive Elijah he said Elijah Elijah
[21:04] didn't come until after 63 and wasn't
[21:09] hard about here in 63 4 and 5 but with a
[21:12] small remnant praise God hey man so
[21:18] therefore who will receive Elijah first
[21:21] after the large is gone who will support
[21:25] it and put it into foreign languages and
[21:27] sending around the world who the shock
[21:29] will in the message
[21:35] and then it'll come when that seed pick
[21:38] up that promise on page three or four
[21:40] for sealed amen wait time element and
[21:43] foul to put a seed wait until the seven
[21:47] thunders uttered his voices to that
[21:50] group that can hand the words here it'll
[21:53] slice and cut and shut the heavens and
[21:55] everything else so when a Tyrell they
[21:59] should begin to chop down praise
[22:00] guidance in early 70's the shuck they're
[22:03] gonna pull away God actually puts shuck
[22:06] ministries and all around the seed that
[22:09] it might be manifest and pull away the
[22:13] action is going on where the thunders
[22:15] are there you see all kind of action all
[22:22] kind of demons all kind of everything
[22:24] going on around the thunders
[22:27] Laura nah Amen or you begin to claim
[22:33] your promise but the real genuine
[22:35] privacy Church will find her position
[22:37] and bring forth the entire Word of God
[22:39] in its fullness the shuck has served its
[22:43] purpose it is see time again see time is
[22:47] here word time bread time Laura the seed
[22:54] cannot get ripe until the stalk Jocelyn
[22:58] shucks all try they've got to be
[23:01] completely tried as long as any life is
[23:05] in the shop is still green when the last
[23:10] bit of life comes out of the shop and he
[23:13] shuts to tour and then green seed
[23:19] becomes golden brown when the life
[23:22] leaves the shop and the shop goes from
[23:25] green to yellow straw and the seed goes
[23:29] from gold from agreeing to golden brown
[23:31] and about that time wheelchair than
[23:33] Tulsa
[23:38] glory praise God and all this kind of
[23:44] preaching here could not come until
[23:45] October 31st in this area hallelujah

[26:57] care if you never praise God because God

[53:28] have eternal life without n without
[53:31] anything it's just forever eternal life
[53:34] oh my the only way to have the
[53:40] perfection of the Son of Man is a
[53:43] compact with that perfection which is
[53:45] God and God is Elohim and when L ahem
[53:49] drops down in perfection with seven
[53:51] spirits then we come back to perfection
[53:55] seven spirits coming down from God to

[54:01] spirits going back to God back to where
[54:03] you come from then we have eternal life

[55:29] itself seven steps back to car question
[55:33] number two oh man so that how do we get
[55:35] this perfection by the word message of
[55:38] Malachi for glory his word message was
[55:43] Luther Wesley Pentecostals in a worried
[55:46] pride faith love grace perfection so you
[55:50] can only get it by his message no other
[55:53] message can you get perfection by he is
[55:55] the one that brought forth Joseph's
[55:57] perfection
[55:59] it lies in here and we preach this
[56:04] Laurie shocked Oh hallelujah Lord then
[56:14] chose the perfection the seven spirits
[56:16] of Elohim represented by the seven
[56:19] rainbow coat upon Joseph the bride type
[56:21] and a pill of fire will be failed again
[56:24] in her skin like Christ was failed in
[56:28] Peter in the early prime MA
[56:33] so a three phase message produces
[56:38] perfection let's prove that
[56:40] Hebrews page 347 ami
[56:44] paragraph 340 I don't want to tell you
[56:47] another thing
[56:47] did you ever take a three corner piece
[56:49] of glass you take a piece of glass that
[56:51] street corner and lay it so the Sun can
[56:54] hit it you gotta lay it in the sound
[57:01] take your justification baptismal holy
[57:04] ghost and lay it in the Sun Amen so the
[57:10] Sun can hit it it'll produce seven
[57:12] perfect colors don't take a one corner
[57:16] piece of glass nor two corner piece of
[57:18] glass take a three corner piece of glass
[57:22] well you'll never get the seven rainbow
[57:24] colors it's got to be three corners a
[57:28] three corner
[57:30] oh my three corner piece of glass will
[57:33] produce a rainbow that's exactly right
[57:36] now if we had time we go on three brings
[57:39] perfection Father Son Holy Ghost
[57:42] justification sanctification baptism of
[57:45] the Holy Ghost there you are
[57:47] the perfection come by the threes God
[57:50] above man God in man called Jesus God in
[57:53] the church then then the perfection
[57:57] God the word coming into your baptism of
[58:01] the Holy Ghost then lay in the sunshine
[58:03] and watch those seven rainbow colors be
[58:08] manifested
[58:12] glory Oh hallelujah glory what a
[58:20] revelation it'll produce seven perfect
[58:23] colors
[58:23] that's exactly right three brings
[58:25] perfection justification sanctification
[58:28] of baptism there you are
[58:30] the perfection comes by threes then a
[58:33] perfection by laying in the Sun to
[58:35] reflect seven perfect colors that is in
[58:38] your baptism by the seventh on the
[58:40] message of Malachi fourth message how
[58:45] are you gonna get the seven rainbows
[58:46] without the seven Thunder Revelation
[58:49] impossible oh my you find the same thing
[58:55] on the name of Jesus also page 21 I
[58:57] don't have time to read it he said a
[58:59] three corner piece of glass will reflect
[59:01] seven perfect colors it's only one piece
[59:04] of glass with three corners that's how
[59:06] Father Son Holy Spirit being one yet
[59:08] reflect the seven spiritual attributes
[59:11] of God see in the baptism 19:06 come the
[59:18] gifts but in now with the baptism come
[59:22] seven thunders
[59:26] then that same baptism will get in the
[59:29] Sun away from the shock and it'll
[59:32] reflect seven living voices seven
[59:35] rainbows my butt the shock had to be dry
[59:40] first why you was trying to manifest and
[59:46] reflect the shock kept bothering you all
[59:48] the time
[59:51] backbiting evil some eyes and you
[59:53] couldn't get to victory all kind of
[59:58] accusation against your pastor and
[59:59] deacons and everything but when ads
[1:00:02] Chuck is try
[1:00:09] now I'm acting like you're seen I ain't
[1:00:12] looking for no church members in here
[1:00:14] [Applause]
[1:00:18] well Lori at that day st. John 14:29
[1:00:24] when the revelation of the seven seals
[1:00:27] seven thunders is made known you will
[1:00:30] know that I am in the father and the
[1:00:32] father and me and I ran you and you and
[1:00:34] me you have to wait until the Prophet
[1:00:37] come when the religious made manifest at
[1:00:39] that day you shall know that I and the
[1:00:41] father are one
[1:00:43] I'm in the father as Elohim and the
[1:00:45] father's and me that's the locals that's
[1:00:50] the word lorry then when the revelation
[1:00:53] comes forth and you find your position
[1:00:57] you get up on that third step I don't
[1:01:01] care how many devils trying to track you
[1:01:02] off for them and then when grace and
[1:01:05] power and the presence of God strikes
[1:01:07] that church on that third phase then
[1:01:10] when charity falls upon the seventh on
[1:01:12] the seed to water it then is hiring you
[1:01:16] and you Amy endemic and I neighbors are
[1:01:21] together for the bride's day to bring
[1:01:23] the pastor perfection of the Son of Man
[1:01:24] again there you are the story of
[1:01:28] redemption cannot be fully known until
[1:01:30] we see him and stand in his likeness in
[1:01:33] his word image then we will know the
[1:01:37] story
[1:01:39] amen you won't need no strong leaders
[1:01:43] everybody happy a song leader all right
[1:01:49] my oh my I feel like sitting down praise
[1:01:54] God
[1:01:55] so I say lay your three corner piece of
[1:01:58] glass in the hot sunshine and let God
[1:02:00] make the seven living spirits have got
[1:02:02] out of you for perfection and the hot
[1:02:07] Sun charity will be here to bake you out
[1:02:13] that's a promise you know now lay in the
[1:02:18] Sun then perfection and the only way we
[1:02:21] can come back to that perfection to come
[1:02:22] back with that perfection which is God
[1:02:24] Elohim then we come back to perfection
[1:02:27] and L AM promise in Genesis 18 14 is
[1:02:30] anything too hard for the Lord at the
[1:02:33] time appointed I will return unto the
[1:02:36] according to the time of life and Sarah
[1:02:38] shall have a son question number three
[1:02:41] is a time of life for the token the
[1:02:44] middle part of his preaching better be
[1:02:46] covered or Amen with attempt sister
[1:02:49] Laura had a dream in 1975 and March that
[1:02:53] uh amen and we would have some preaching
[1:02:56] Amy we'd have our tents and what does
[1:02:59] the Tennessee is a tabernacle and we are
[1:03:02] tabernacle we have an outside and we
[1:03:06] have an inside a holy place in the
[1:03:09] spirit and we have an inside inside a
[1:03:12] most holy place
[1:03:15] so the Lord gave her a dream that we
[1:03:18] would begin to preach the seven thunders
[1:03:19] in Fort Wayne in 1975 and then that
[1:03:23] there was a dream where some brethren
[1:03:25] came from Tucson we will give him the
[1:03:28] open part see that's been for 10 years
[1:03:32] we had to open part but when it hits

[1:04:55] now talk about our tenth time anybody
[1:04:57] else's ten but this is my tenth here
[1:05:02] now in a Christian and the Holy Ghost
[1:05:04] quote you know what God did he placed
[1:05:06] his tent among us we have tents and God
[1:05:09] out of ten and God twelve in a tent
[1:05:11] called Jesus Christ he just pitched his
[1:05:14] tent with us so Jesus was God's ten

[1:05:45] Supriya seven golden candlesticks an
[1:05:48] altar of instance where you pray that's
[1:05:52] the middle part and there the middle
[1:05:54] part is represents a human spirit the
[1:05:57] spirit then the spirit reflects seven
[1:06:00] rainbows reflects seven spirits in the
[1:06:05] middle part four seven Church ages but
[1:06:09] on the inside inside Laura in there's
[1:06:14] the alternate lead over gold Amen is the
[1:06:18] mercy seat the cherubim swings its tip
[1:06:21] in there's the arc
[1:06:24] Amen the Tambor's in the arc and over
[1:06:28] the arc between the cherubim sister
[1:06:29] Shekinah and she kind of sits over the
[1:06:33] mercy seat where the blood is sprinkled
[1:06:35] seven times to the east also in his
[1:06:39] original spoonful of manna
[1:06:42] hallelujah just like when the day of
[1:06:44] Pentecost you'll promise the same penny
[1:06:47] you promise the original spoonful of
[1:06:50] manna
[1:06:52] and also in is Aaron's rod it it but it

[1:07:35] to Puerto Rico and said so
[1:07:39] that's why with them in the Puerto Rico
[1:07:41] that's why card games brother LeBron
[1:07:43] attend in the beginning was a word seven
[1:07:48] written a seals of redemption the word
[1:07:51] is the water the redemption is the blood
[1:07:54] Christ in you the spirit Sunday morning
[1:07:57] rise and shine
[1:07:59] speak the word brother Vela Sunday night
[1:08:01] push the through the tent as my
[1:08:06] father sent me even so send I you
[1:08:07] it was already symbolized that's why
[1:08:14] we're down to Puerto Rico Oh glory my
[1:08:18] yeah the middle part the spirit part
[1:08:23] reflected light from the seven golden
[1:08:25] candlesticks to the seven churches the
[1:08:28] inside inside had the ark the mercy seat
[1:08:31] sprinkled with blood
[1:08:32] Shekinah was in the soul but our human
[1:08:37] experience of imagination and memory
[1:08:39] confection that must die that his spirit
[1:08:43] faith and virtue and knowledge would
[1:08:45] reflect out of you in the middle part
[1:08:47] covered with a tent God is going to
[1:08:51] stretch his tent Jesus Christ to cover
[1:08:54] you
[1:08:57] to reflect the Shekinah glory oh my in a
[1:09:03] hurry huh is the time of life for the
[1:09:05] token to be displayed here number three
[1:09:09] is the time of life is it here is it
[1:09:11] ready if it is then it will be the
[1:09:15] perfection of the Son of Man again now
[1:09:21] you know I can't preach it cm pin Harris
[1:09:23] don't you hear it said surely it's crazy
[1:09:26] he's gonna have the perfection of the
[1:09:29] Son of Man again imma prove it to you
[1:09:31] anyway glory which is the mechanics and
[1:09:38] dynamics together for the branch day
[1:09:40] there this is a promise of God from
[1:09:43] Malachi 4 ok let's begin to prove it out
[1:09:45] now God always proves his word well he
[1:09:48] don't use make believers he don't use
[1:09:51] complainers he don't use with those what
[1:09:54] I don't know I don't feel good this
[1:09:56] morning he don't use you to prove
[1:10:00] nothing the devil uses you Loreena God a
[1:10:04] man sure
[1:10:08] oh man that's a button float here for
[1:10:12] about ten minutes a man flew along some
[1:10:14] quotes to nail down
[1:10:15] Nayla town proving this word of I am a
[1:10:20] teen number three page one the Word of
[1:10:23] God
[1:10:24] he's the quickening pal he's the Holy
[1:10:26] Spirit the dynamic that comes into the
[1:10:28] mechanics the words that make it live
[1:10:30] you are his words you are his mechanics
[1:10:33] he is a dynamic succumbing to his words
[1:10:36] why because you believe all of his words
[1:10:38] through the through the Prophet it was
[1:10:41] him that spoke through the prophets
[1:10:43] mouth and you received his words and you
[1:10:47] come out of shock and you become his
[1:10:49] words his mechanics and now he's the
[1:10:55] dynamics that wants to get into your
[1:10:56] mechanics and then make it live and it
[1:11:00] all has to work together just won't work
[1:11:01] it's got to take the whole Bible the
[1:11:03] whole Christ the full gospel and just so
[1:11:08] we know what we're talking about the
[1:11:10] manifestation again on page four we
[1:11:14] should realize that in us has been given
[1:11:16] we who believe Jesus Christ been born of
[1:11:18] the spirit filled with that quickening
[1:11:20] power that power that's in you by laying
[1:11:23] on the hands or on the others like the
[1:11:25] disciples did down through the age it
[1:11:28] absolutely heal the sick raise the dead
[1:11:30] it showed visions prophecies and a very
[1:11:33] same spirit catch it the very same
[1:11:37] spirit that lived amongst the early
[1:11:40] apostles talk about now the first C
[1:11:43] church amen
[1:11:45] Laurie is living in the church today
[1:11:48] working the very same things and as
[1:11:52] quick as we can recognize that see no
[1:11:54] matter how much it's the working
[1:11:56] you got to recognize that and believe
[1:11:58] that it won't do one bit of good until
[1:12:01] you believe it
[1:12:02] and the moment you believe it your
[1:12:05] troubles are ended
[1:12:10] the very same spirit that worked in
[1:12:13] Peter come back and work again through
[1:12:17] Malachi for that's my promise
[1:12:24] that's your promise if you wanted that's
[1:12:28] the second seed church
[1:12:30] the only thing won't had that sign was
[1:12:33] done Malachi for did that sign and he
[1:12:36] had all of the Son of Man in him and we
[1:12:39] will have our measure but it'll be the
[1:12:42] measure that was in the early bride
[1:12:45] which was the same they did the same
[1:12:47] signs they take it took note that they
[1:12:51] had been with Jesus cuz they was
[1:12:54] manifesting his perfection so my thought
[1:13:01] is the perfection of the son of man
[1:13:03] again
[1:13:06] again like it was on the first see
[1:13:10] Church is here again oh oh you got it
[1:13:20] grace okay you got it now on page 6
[1:13:23] paragraph 30 it's your approach the
[1:13:26] attitude it's what it takes and that's
[1:13:28] what it is tonight their friend it takes
[1:13:30] the attitude we are and believe that we
[1:13:32] are in the presence of Jesus Christ but
[1:13:35] as your attitude it brings the results
[1:13:37] the mechanics is here and so is the
[1:13:39] dynamics if you could just get started
[1:13:41] God will do the rest
[1:13:42] there we are Oh mind speaking about
[1:13:47] Sarah he said on page 25 talking about
[1:13:51] son of man and Ella him he said she's in
[1:13:54] a tent behind you he's 25 listen what he

[1:16:11] and in truth my and a prophet restored
[1:16:17] this time back
[1:16:19] they'll mechanics and dynamics together
[1:16:22] is worshiping God in spirit and truth
[1:16:24] and we have the dynamics here and we
[1:16:29] have the mechanics hallelujah give glory
[1:16:34] to God same and somebody there feel
[1:16:37] happy well glory hallelujah glory man
[1:16:46] I'm finished two more coats page 24
[1:16:50] Jesus said in John 14:12 he didn't

[1:16:54] while he is in me no one that people say
[1:16:56] that these Americans has passed
[1:16:58] no wonder they say these things miracles

[1:17:02] things he did leave without me not he he
[1:17:05] did believe within me not on me
[1:17:06] but believeth in me the works 9 to show
[1:17:09] you also why it's his life
[1:17:11] it's his dynamics in his mechanics
