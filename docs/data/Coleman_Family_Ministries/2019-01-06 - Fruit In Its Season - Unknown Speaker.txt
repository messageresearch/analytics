TRANSCRIPT
========================================
reading from Psalm 1 I'm going to read from the first verse through the third I'm going to read jeremiah 17:7 and eight verses st. Matthew 7 17 through 20 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of order that bringing forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper Jeremiah 17 chapter the seventh verse will take my time is normal time blessed is the man that trusted in the Lord it's not a blessing we see one blessing is to not to walk in the way of the ungodly and here's another blessing here blessed is the man who trusted in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is faith in God for this man that doesn't stand in the way of the sinners and and also taketh a counsel from the ungodly and who trusts in the Word of God for he shall be like a tree he shall be as a tree planted by the waters that spread it out that spread out her roots by the river and shall not see when he'd come in but her leaf shall be green and shall not be be careful in the air drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit we see that though there's no joy around there's always somebody who will be yielding fruit joy in their souls that's what the scripture says so we just stay with the word amen Matthew seventh chapter 17 verse even so every good tree bringeth forth fruit those that are planted by the rivers of living order that's a good tree bringeth forth fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth no I'm reading - but - fancy even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them may a loyal blessing to the reading of this word so we can see from the choice of scriptures no matter what man says today no matter what man is doing because how hard it is and the devil said this and the devil said that and I ain't got no joy and the law don't bless me the Bible says our good fruit I mean a good tree will bring forth good fruit a good tree will just bear the fruit well he hasn't got anything because to do with it for his coming from the inside out it's in the roots it's the life and the roots and the Word of God declares that my word shall go out and it shall not return to me void but it will it shall accomplish that in the thing that I sent it into it will prosper when I send my word that see that tree that person will prosper so we find out that what we are looking for in this hour is a life you must see a life and the life is the fruit flavors the apple tree is life down in that apple tree that's going to produce apples so if you see the trees and well what kind is it when you see the Apple he said that's the apple tree and if we are lacking on two trees and we're supposed to be Christians loving one another and by their fruits you shall know them see if they are complain us evil speaking and so forth by their fruits you shall know them Amon that's God's Word and God just doesn't because because put is worried out here and just leave it no sir for Jeremiah says great in council mighty in work for then our eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men to everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings so they all mighty God in your secret councils over in your homes where you gather with the friends that finest level around you seem to me now all the trees gather together it does apple trees is all apple trees if there's bramble bushes and figs and so forth that's the kind of trees there is so therefore you can't get grapes because because I'm a victory and if certain kinds of trees are gathered together if if they are getting together when if they have love that love will be evident in their myths but if they gather together with jealousy evil speaking about their brothers and the passes and so forth that's the kind of tree it is it's a corrupt tree nothing good can come from it for its roots or Christ it's nothing in it so therefore no matter what they say they believe the message that doesn't mean one thing no siree by their fruits you shall know the Bible says amen so we see God is watching over us to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit the length the effect of his doings amen of his works so therefore whatever works you have whatever comes out of your mouth your heart or whatever it is God will recompense you for that that's your fruit you can't bring forth anything else see so because Solomon said in the book of progress he said the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life amen hey Solomon said the fruit the doings of the righteous is a tree of life John the Baptist said when when he come on a scene with a message anointing with the spirit Elijah and we're looking for the spirit of Elijah to come on the scene once more and bring up methods also John came with a powerful message to all the pharisees sadducees and so forth and they all they were supposed to be sweet and kind old priests but he told them that he told them to bring forth fruits meet for repentance no matter if you have Abraham - father that's all right but when you hear the word now see when you hear the word for this age then if you receive that word believe on him that is sent that will be the fruit by their fruits you shall know them then when the word comes for that age it is going to produce the effects for that age the fruitful adage then if these apheresis also Sadducees no matter how sweet they were if they had received John the Baptist message they would have produced brought forth bring forth other words if the seed of God is in you you will bring forth out of you for if you see if you see a tree because in the winter time all you see is that Trina limbs but if there's a seat of an apple plant it deep down in the roots in the springtime it will bring forth and you'll see them amen so when the word came with John the Baptist if they had the seed of God down in the roots in there when the word was spoken it would have brought forth the life that was supposed to be in that tree amen in that man so we find bring forth fruits meat for a pet because because for repentance other words John the Bethel was saying bring forth fruit that is consistent with repentance it's a little different amen other words he's saying let your lives prove your change of heart prove it see me now you say I repent prove it let your life prove it by the fruits you shall know them you could come up here so I repent brother but if you still go I won't shake my hand are you still talking against me sitting in there if you still speak in railing accusations against me by the fruits you shall know them bringing forth fruits meat on to repentance then you have not repented it's very plain so we find in that if it's a good tree see a good tree cannot impassable less God is alive but God said our good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit can saltwater and sweet water come from the same fountain no Serena can you curse somebody this assembly here and say sweet things about him also no sir if you do it you a hypocrite right I make it plain this morning by their fruits you shall know for this is the age when God is shining the light into the dark corners into the dark hole we don't worry about it if we see mumbling over there and also burning over there in the darkness shining upon it expose that thing bring it out bring out those secret things back there coracles names and put them out in the front so Aramaic is he look at what comes in the heart there put them right up on it the light of God's Word amen he's put no matter what they say put the light of God up on those trees amen so we find them that by their fruits you shall know them a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit but they'll all grove together but he's coming now to separate them see so we find in that what is fruit there's D D fruit of faith if you believe this message you will produce certain things it's the fruit of repentance if you really and truly repent if we'll go back and read David and you want to yeah I think I saw because I'm 51 you read when somebody if they really repent what they do they just don't say I repent brother oh no that's no repentance that's what you what you call because Pentecostal repentance but that's not true rugged Christian repentance No so therefore the day all we can do is just receive that's all we can do we can't just nobody if you say that you have repented fine with me he is watching your doings a man he's watching your doings he's watching the fruit of your doings he's watch it has a search another seven spirit all over the earth they're watching you watching it - not when you hear when you go downstairs what you say down there when you go home to the Bronx Jersey Brooklyn whether you go it in your dark secret corners that's where the eyes search out and mark it down for you mark it down for you you'll be recompense when he comes up on earth you get it all back so all we can do here is to preach the word to stretch you out in here to smooth that's all we can do Amen so the fruit we are speaking about of the spirit love and peace and joy and temperance if we have passed from death unto life we have fruit to prove it that's in the Bible no matter how much the palm ornament and locusts have eaten off of God's tree there is still something about those that are the prettiest native seeds of God they have something there for one for the other imma prove this one about scriptures there is something there so how can we prosper and also have fruit in our season this most difficult time this is the hardest time they have fruit because Satan is right in here this is the way it comes in see if you wanna know if it's a work of God you find a devil Satan it with all his fury raging all through this assembly here but we know that and therefore we rejoice in that then we fall into divers temptations well we know that God is with us he's I'll help you in that day amen so we'd says we just go on and let God search him out and do the work that's all we can do so how can we bring forth this fruit here's how blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly now walk is your manner of life see that's your man of life if you don't stand around with the ungodly because in their counsel if you stand there with them pretty soon you shall sit down amen and the seat of the scornful you stand around long enough with the ungodly you'll sit down with him amen and next thing we find then that he said blessed is a man that trusted in the Lord so we find that we have to have faith in this word though all around us we don't feel anything and there's a spirit against you with is trying to make you not love your brother and it's a spirit that is trying to make you talk against your brother see me now but just for this age God knows what he's doing he has put his word right here for this age right now the mechanics of the word see so in for as believe us has fake faint thoughts that's all you can do therefore if you want to prove it in the Old Testament they didn't not have the Holy Ghost yet they have a testimony in the book of Hebrews 11 amen they have a testimony there they was sauna Thunder hunting caves and Den's and so forth but they held on they were seized of God without the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen they have a testimony so don't tell me I don't have the Holy Spirit if you are the seed of God you we do what is recorded in you if you are a good tree you bring forth the fruit that God has ordained for you to bring forth in his proper season in this season right now he knows that many don't had the better than Holy Ghost neither did Peter know they were persecuted but they were together before they received the Holy Ghost and they loved one another they were friends one to the other they did not have the Holy Ghost but they had received the words of God amen so therefore this morning if you feel that evil be spread upon you if you will receive the word and resist the devil for it's written he will flee from you cuz God can I if you give in to it it proves what kind of seed is there see sure look how she does it so we find that Jesus Christ said and Saint John 15 uh okay you don't have to get it I just thought it because block you off from well trying to say I'll just read it out we just just take our time this morning amen we want to find out a few things this morning st. John 13:34 a new commandment I give unto you that ye love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another notice now by this love see by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if you have love one for the other amen there's a test see so what is it and love is God Jesus Christ the word is a great big bundle of love that's what he is he is the word so then we find with all the storms of doubt see all around us if we can reach out and grab hold of at apples the word and tie ourselves to that word in no matter what happens God he'll hold on to you he will take though you stumble and you're walking here reached out and cup your hands he'll eat you the way his word is the lamp unto your feet in this darkness now he'll help you when you don't have any strength at all he'll help you so therefore we find in Saint John 15 he's speaking here these things have I spoken unto you in the eleventh verse that my joy might remain in you you don't have any joy my joy might remain in you what he said no these things have I spoken unto you they did not have the Holy Ghost that my joy might remain in you then your joy it might be full amen you should be so happy this morning knowing that we're seem to take a flight so you believe this ungodly word you don't have no joy this morning what kind of tree are you this morning huh look around tree are you what are you looking down for look up for your redemption I'm full of joy this morning to know that by the grace of Almighty God he reached down to pluck me up from all this filth and sin and unbelief out here he chose me amen hey you don't have no joy man about this man about that evil about this speaking really accusations all the time what kind of tree are you what kind of tree are you amen praise God amen brother so we find this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you now notice the love of God he laid down his life he stripped himself of his royal roles he stripped himself and made himself of no reputation and laid down his life for us he wants the same word in us that we may lay down our lives for our friends see he said you are my friends if you do if you do what sort of our mention henceforth I call you now servants for the servant knoweth not what is Lord do it but I have called you friends for all things that I've heard of my father I have made known unto you can you imagine every all the thoughts in God's mind the things his nature Christ revealed his nature to his disciples and was ready at this time getting ready to lay down his life for them to prove it amen say bring forth fruits meat he was ready to prove it to bring it forth see at this time ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth it's bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name he may give it to you these things I command you that you love one another now how should we be in here all the little seeds of God loving one another amen the Bible says by this you'll know that you are my disciples by the fruits you shall know them that's exactly what it says no Bible so we find that love one another as Jesus loves us he loved us so much and he laid down his life for us can we say the same thing one for the other in here can we say that see well the bride is gonna say that the bride will say that whoever she is even now for the bride will do that some will have to do that then we want to see a great separation we'll see the bride bring forth fruits meat unto unto repentance when the Elijah says repent the bride will bring that forth for she have an inner to come forth it's there it's a good tree it'll bring forth the good fruit amen so he laid down his life for us and revealed his nature to his disciples as his friends Jesus right now is he is now revealing his nature to us through the seven seals through all the mysteries amen he's revealed it to us given us and he revealed to us and he's soon coming now to open our understanding to this that we may do the work of God see he's revealing it now this is that over there and that's that over there and we say my I was tagging around right now trying to understand this these things but he's coming to give you the understanding upon it in the resurrection power of the dynamics of Christ will open up I understand to all these things so we see that not many had been called the Friends of God Abraham John was and also disciples will call the Friends of Jesus Christ so therefore we are striving today to be called his friend for he has revealed his nature to us how we should be all disciples have loved one for the other so we find them that today the love of many has next and where there is a spark of love that's where you find the enemy trying to tear down all right wear it because writing this out right now is the inter let chill message going forth now God's prophet is cool as a cucumber he's walking among all the confusion smiling not saying a word knowing that they have to do what they have to do what have you do do quickly see if they stay with the word they are staying with the word they have been blessed that's that's a good tree so therefore Benny now all around God's prophet he can't do anything for it's a predestination he know that if the seed is laying there the Holy Spirit is soon coming to pick up these seats and also put him together in a strong chain know which is the word he knows that so he can't do anything he just goes hit preaches a message if the man is called of God he'll preach what the word says what it says in the Bible that's all he can do so we find that we can only have love then through the tap holes the word for sin here we can only have it through this it that's all we hear we on a certain level here because we come here for the word we have the word in common here amen we are supposed to be seeds of God and if we have the word we are supposed to be bringing forth fruits meat on to repentance John the Baptist told him to change their lives before they received the Holy Ghost amen oh yes he said bring forth now fruits meat unto repentance repent and turn around from the works of darkness so we find them that we can only have love because through god's word the word ties us together let us have a little example of love in the Bible turn to 1st Samuel the eighteenth chapter we have an example of the love of God in the Bible here to me is a beautiful example it's one of the greatest friendships in the Bible Jonathan and David beautiful true friendship so we like to look at this little example of love for about five ten minutes amen please go first samuel to 18th chapter and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul that the soul of Jonathan notice now the soul of Jonathan was knit knit knit with the soul of David and Jonathan loved him as his own soul then we have a type of the love that I'm trying to express to you this morning through the Word of God that's what I'm trying to talk about this morning so we find then from this beautiful friendship here what was this friendship based on what was Jesus Christ friendship with Abraham John the Baptist his disciples what was that based on you find that Jonathan and David frigate was based on the same thing so we see it now so we find out the first thing zette the friendship must be based on his trust that's the first thing faith in one another confidence in one another if you come at this and send me here and you don't have faith and trust and Brotherhood myself as these two pastors here then there is no friendship there is no faith whatsoever so you don't trust us you have no faith in us you have no confidence in us amen then you know how to be in common see so we find in that true friendship is founded on faith is the fact is the foundation there now notice now David could not trust Saul ah Saul was a child of God slept with his father's he was annoyed of the Lord but David could not trust Saul why we find out but David could trust you the Bible says that their souls was knit together so we find in the first thing that you must have is trust faith in one another that's your foundation the next thing you have is sacrifice Christ did it he sacrificed himself for his friends he laid down his life amen well because look at Jonathan he was heir apparent to the throne of Saul he was a mighty warrior Jonathan was all right he was a fine handsome man but something happened when he met David here was a king son a warrior of great renown heir to the throne of God see well when he met David something in the heart went out to him just like oh just like Mary Elizabeth sons amen but because of an amen a witness went out see it's something that you can't explain but it's there something that won't be knit together because I because invisible you won't see it but it's there it's right there just like you can't see the life in that tree it's waiting on the roofs but it'll produce a certain kind of fruit so Jonathan was heir to the throne mighty warrior but when he met David when he met David and saw Davis courage against the great Goliath and his modesty see in his love and his faith in the word of God how dare uncircumcised philistine did find a living honors of God for God way back in Deuteronomy he had declared when you go into warfare I will fight your battles David was the only one who remembered them therefore he trusted in the Word of God David meditated day and night God said I will be with you I will fight your battles so there David went to fight the bellows and so Jonathan saw them Jonathan was a mighty preacher warrior for the Lord but he saw David and he saw something in David what did he see he saw that David was called of God see David was a sheep herder he was called as a sheep herder David was anointed to fight the battles and then David was placed as a king in the throne sea so you have to go through all that just let just let God's prophet he was called as a pastor and ship it then he's been annoying all these years he's getting ready to be placed as Elijah Eamon he's been through all the battles now God's gonna place him out there so we find in that when Jonathan saw David the first thing that Jonathan did he stripped himself let's read it right here and the second verse and Saul took him that day and wouldn't let him go no more home because his father's house then Jonathan David made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul and Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that because upon him and gave it to David and his garments even to his sword and also to his bone and also because to his girdle so we find in that Christ stripped himself of all that he had for his friends amen Jonathan stripped himself of all that he had he was a great warrior king son but he stripped himself for his friend he brought forth fruits meet you saw that he did it you saw him and you knew it see so we find in Jonathan was ready to lay down his life for David and he did it too because he fought in the battles and so forth so we find that he was ready to lay down his life at the risk of his own life lay it down for him so then we find out what is the true meaning of a friend a friend seeks his friends welfare see if we are the same seed here you are continually praying for me seeking my welfare not your own because self-will is unbelief seek my welfare I will seek your welfare that's what you're supposed to be doing seeking my welfare not talking against me save me now seeking my welfare all the time but why could he seek Davis welfare because they had a foundation the Word of God this holes was knit together therefore they had a spiritual quality about their friendship then they had a meeting of the mind to mine they meant soul the soul spirit the spirit they had a mutual Amite relationship every seat at his own kind see their relationship was not it was not caught no siree here was a king's son and a shepherd boy there was no walls between them a king's son and a shepherd boy at the picture now and Christ bar no free Jew nor Greek doesn't matter Christ in Christ now cry because David and also Jonathan was together they was in Christ same spirit whether he was a king's son or whether he was a shepherd boy had made no difference to Jonathan and today if we are supposed to be in Christ it should make no difference what a man looks like or where he comes from it should make no difference whatsoever for if we are the trees of God we all clap my hands when we all receive the ring we all bring forth the same kind of fruit after its kind Amen if we need some Jonathan Davis today so we find him that how was this possible it's possible because the Bible says that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David that time it was joined together it was worn mine heart sold one see and we had here to come or seeking each other's welfare the Holy Spirit because a charity sneaking out at home does not bought itself no uh-uh it doesn't secrets on see it's looking out one for the other because Christ did then that's Christ so we find in that we can only have this beautiful fellowship define with crimes only as we are knit together our souls are knit together now just a minute now God spoke back there don't put wallet linen together don't mix it together no surgery you cannot knit together one minute separated see only after its current mush you knit together so you find in that that you knit things together that are the same kind things that are the same substance and also fiber and texture strength and endurance you knit those together so we find then that you will knit a thread to a kindred thread they three full thread two or three four three amen a chain of iron two chain of mine a chain of gold to a chain of gold you don't mix it see you knit those things together and it'll be the same size and strength and beauty and also purity this goal will be so then Jonathan's soul was a chain of gold of the same size and also Beauty as David soul was then that was knit together and that was one they will one see and so and also how could you know Jonathan he humbled himself to a shepherd boy he was a king son that's how you knew he was humble he was a great warrior he was a mighty preacher too and also he had proved himself but he humbled himself down because of David in other words he had mutual esteem see if a man think himself something and thinks that he's a great preacher and all those brothers nothing there's nothing new to but at all if you don't think I'm anything at all then can any two walk together except they be agreed you can't walk together no siree so we find it must be are in one another goodwill affection and most of all loyalty now a loyalty fine loyalty today plus almost the curse way if somebody here want to be loyal right here to the pastor's you'll get blasted for it today is something right surely will any assembly any awareness message if you try to be loyal loyalty no right there and Tucson alone is about nine different variations of the message that's right so we find in that in this mutual friendship here esteem one for the other the basis of it Jonathan kept back no secrets from David Heyman even David kept back no secrets because from because from Jonathan in other words David because he was a shepherd Jonathan let him know what was going on sing so he told David of Saul's plans to kill him Amen Jesus told his friends of Satan's plans to kill them they shall deliver up to the synagogue's they shall persecute you from Sega's city house can you know if you have a friend he'll tell you amen he'll let you know what the enemy is speaking trying to kill you but words all the day long does a friend don't ever feel convicted if you hear somebody speaking evil against somebody if you have person's friend because you let them know and you pray for that evil person see you now don't ever feel convicted about that don't let the devil tell you that your snitches cuz today if Jonathan was in this church today he would be called a snitch call her and so going back and telling past two days it what evils saw his brother was trying to do to him come on you know talking about and hope is planing you know exactly what I'm talking about amen so we find Jonathan would be called a rat you rat Jonathan why did you go and tell David what Saul said about him why he's trying to kill him today James said you had told to rose and Delta rest instead right you kill them with your words that's right you kill them with your words see what kind of friend is that what a fellowship with a friend Devine what a friend what a fellowship divine amen so we find that is impossible for that to come forth from a good tree see cuz Jesus said a good tree cannot bring forth that kind of fruit it is impossible for my word I predict my where to go into good soil and it'll bring forth fruit thirty sixty a hundred and his season it will come forth but evil speaking and railing accusation come from corrupt trees amen from corrupt trees their evil man jealous envious of what God is doing is cut to be legal spirits and moon-goddess bid him to curse you why he has a law Saint John 15 I'll purge you by an evil spirits they'll keep on pressing you down in prayer ho God why they keep doing that don't they know the word they're supposed to do that because let him alone let go and do it the day is coming the lifetime a shine upon call them out there the guardia feet first that's right so I'm speaking to the good trees this morning the Warriors who love to hear the word flowing from the throne of God the war is that a predestinated to take that word of God and bring forth fruit me repentance I'm sticking to you this morning the rest of you sit there I'm speaking to the seeds of God why am i speaking this way for Elijah is soon to come forth and I want a testimony Lord God I want them I told them when Elijah comes forth and speaks clean see told you thank you so therefore we find that a poor old loyal Jonathan knit to the soul of David whether you call a rap today a snitcher because he would tell his friend what the enemy was gonna do to him Saul anoint of God if you notice Saul before he could even be used by God God gave him a new heart before he had anybody to even follow him he had to change their hearts also let you know something right there that whoever want to follow who God's got to put them together God had to give Saul a new heart it's in the word and I'll show it to you maybe something we couldn't believe that there but it's right here amen praise the Lord so we find Saul anointed king oh and first time you attend the ninth verse and it was sold that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel God gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass that day 26 verse and Saul also went home to Gilbert and then went with him a band of men whose hearts God had touched amen God must touch your heart to go with anybody it's got to do that it's got Revere to you Jimmy now then when after that was one age of God Saul was that was one time but when God moved on on down to David fewer men because women David God had to gather together 400 there who was distressed and dissatisfied with their lot in the land they follow David but God had to touch them that they may follow David for doing that time he was anointed Saul his brother and notice how David loves song touch not mine anointed and do my prophet no harm when Saul was evil when the presence of God would when the evil spirit would move up on Saul he took a jabber and threw it at him three times try to kill him so we have Saul's today they have gentleman's darts and they're throwing at you but your signs to them just by faith which they alternate behind your backs talking about you dig it into you it because javelins it's the girl into you see but God the hand of God is up on you you just move on alone but Saul feared David wise for the card it was with David nothing that they could see nothing that they could do against David God was still with him why was that because they couldn't understand God because God doesn't calm in a card demands way see but the Lord said unto Samuel look not a look at his countenance on the height of a statue because I had refused and for the Lord see if not as a man cr4 man look at on an outward appearance but the Lord look at on heart sing so therefore no matter how powerful and big and smart you may think somebody is or who should do what in here seeing me now God looketh on the heart and that's where God looks in that heart you see me now so we find today in this hour now that Brad is all torn up there's many souls there's many Davis they all have eternal life we don't we don't go into that will either with God but you find when this book of the seven tears come out you're gonna find a lot of people who followed the message now here's one that God's prophet has preached and their mystic the Pentecostals is a type of Israel Kannada wilderness and and dying on the ones because about forty years 1906 to 1946 is 40 years Sarah but now after that God's animals is also william branham amen and he took out some people out in the wilderness - and it's still out there so he's talking to them but they don't know it they saw the pillar of fire they others didn't see it because when the Holy Spirit fell back in 1906 in about three years it was all dried up through that because the nomination and they had tomes and so forth that's all he saw but who saw the pillar of fire after 46 come on now where was the dead in the message who saw the great signs wonders and miracles the dead raised again the blind seen the lame walking who saw that those that followed the pillow fire since 1947 they saw that but to adjust to Joseph Mikayla went passed over crossed over what happened to mighty Aaron and Miriam what happened to them dead the Bible says did on the Aaron now he was a prophet all right he had many wonderful works did all kind of things was Darren in Egypt but he come against God's prophet I guess that worried Miriam because because she'd prejudiced against Moses dark wife hey amen Bible says so what happened to Miriam leprosy come up on where she had now dead where's Aaron dead David so I believe the message you do bring forth fruits meat unto repentance I believe the message hey man now I'll make the plane this morning maybe you don't understand these things but who saw the pillar fire the pillow fire came down in about two because 1950 with God's prophet they saw the pillar fire even right now brother Brown is sweet-talking certain people there's sheep locked up in there if you heard these telephone message you have heard him say over and over this is a fact now I know where I wouldn't say it if I didn't know that that is true I know exactly what I'm saying he's sweet-talking certain people they're sheep locked up in certain cults and he's gonna that's right they're sheep there and one woman up in Chicago her son is locked up there and she went to brother Branham and he assured her in God's season in God's time he'll come out see you come out see so during this time love ye one another what am I to do here preach the word in season out of season reprove cuz it prove at all long-suffering why am i preached this way this morning I'm preaching to you that those of you who are going to wrong with me turn around that's why if not because they these things they I could preach a nice message and you shout and go home see me now it's hard to preach this way but then we may understand these things and repent not keep on doing the same thing every Wednesday Sunday Wednesday Sunday that's no repentance no well a lot understand anyway he does did he understand about Aaron Miriam 3 million of his own people dead the Bible says dead means eternally separated from God so we find it and this is our now Paul said to cast off the works of darkness amen cast him off in this hour an hour in Romans 13 I just want to read it to you and and that knowing the time then now is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer then when we believe is it is it nearer amen the night is far spent the day is at hand the day of Christ let us therefore cast off the works of darkness let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and also drunkenness and Chairman and wantonness and strength and envy now either strength and envy is the Word of God is the works of God or it's not that's up to you touch because understand it either a jealous pair like soul against David is the work of God or is not up to you to understand it see but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ to work and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof that's the message of the hour paul also said overhead ephesians the fifth chapter 4 and 8 verse 4 ye were sometimes darkness ye were sometimes darkness see but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of light for the fruit the fruit of the Spirit is all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable unto the Lord now notice now have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them somebody wants their own else up you got talk about somebody reprove that thing there let them know how because your walk at you not want to stand in the way with the sinners you're not gonna listen to the ungodly filth come out their mouths their hearts so reprove them that's exactly what the Bible says when in this hour now don't it's a shame to even hear that filth Paul sessile right here for it's a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret say in secret they do it in secret and if anybody they want to be a Jonathan linked together the chain one soul all of us around the evil ones to get mad at you see they may now think you say oh why you got to tell all because Dave everything saw because Jonathan why see say the same thing today why tell because a ship is everything why tell them you ain't tell me that you are reproving that filth that's what you're doing it have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness is that unfruitful on earth will that bring forth anything bring forth death so but rather reprove them like Jonathan told David of Saul's jealousy and unfruitful works that's what he did Jonathan told David of Saul's jealousy his plan his talking about him in blasting him insult cause his friend Jesus Christ he told his disciples his friends what the enemy was getting ready to do to their butt because trans knew all things amen so we find them that let our lives reprove by listen by being in contrast to all darkness all evil speaking and lying in jealousy is darkness they say ye are the children late then walk as children of the light then when you begin to walk as children the light in you all autumn your life is automatic because we proven their lives for you are bringing forth good fruit in your season amen God's Word so we find then that when our lives will begin to bear fruit on the word it'll no no clicks it'll no no color lines no nothing see it'll just be linked knit it together soul the soul and then the Holy Spirit can move up on that and come down up on it so we're finding that when it's all murmuring and mumbling in a dark corner put the light up on and sharing up on it what's that over there over there and pull out an openness a you find out what it is and watch them run like roaches that's character they go that's right they can't face you with that stuff they could because talking behind your back all day long but they can't face you with it never will they face you with it they can't face you with they can't stand against that truth can't do it see so they call hard preaching because you're mad and no love and clicks and so forth that's what they say they gotta say that that's what's in their heart see so don't ever look back no other words if we have a look back and think that we did something here then we have left gone I haven't done nothing God has built a work here himself but me I'm not anything I'm standing here by the grace of Almighty got it and pray that God will speak for me to his because to his sheep but I ain't done anything here don't ever look back because if you look back there's nothing there because Aaron because he could look back he's dead though Aaron was a prophet wasn't he well could he look back he's dead that's right don't ever look back see go all on my lord pause that press forward the one to mark up the hack hole press forward not that I have attained because to the out resurrection that's what he said but he's seeking to but he knew that he had to earnest though a man he had the earnest of the resurrection in him so we find therefore that in this island now is a time for us to examine ourselves to see if we be in the faith - well we know one thing that Jesus Christ that he has ordained and chosen us to bring forth fruit he said so in Saint John 15 I have ordained and chosen you to bring forth fruit so we know that we have some Jonathas here this morning and Davis whose souls are knitted together loving the Brethren hating the works of darkness they hate that and when they hear people talking about this one talking over their jealousy they can't stand that see it grieves them and they said well listen sister if you don't if you don't leave it just don't come here no more that's between you and God say somebody wants because of my total between them and God say and move on leave that alone upsie don't be staring on no evil darkness like that leaving people alone because they are evil is corrupt as filthy in God's sight the eyes of God is searching out looking for the good trees he's blessing them and the corrupt trees are standing around man and even talking about you right let us the budge and so forth corrupt tree bring forth corrupt fruit you cannot get any good fruit from those trees can't get it so we find then that if we're Jonathan and David have a beautiful friendship like that Jonathan strengthen Davis hand amen in his battles Christ strengthened his disciples hand amen if I'm your brother strengthen my hand with prayers and so forth strengthen my hand pray for me help me I need your help we have one soul don't talk about me and down me there and knock me down strength in my hands if you are my brother see so we find then that these friends who will strengthen one another's hands they will bring forth fruit we have those who love to know what's going on down at Tucson and those who want to play on the Jeff go down there we hear we're do what we God put us here together if you want to go they go there it's alright if you say well brother songs a soul pressures over there don't know but if you want to strengthen our hands here what stand do it sing it bring it forth let it be seen we'll do it together amen now how can we know that we're gonna bring forth this fruit amen how can we know well Davis said here we shall be like trees as planet by a rivers of living water that right I'm gonna show you something so we will be positive amen he said that notice now God Davis said that we all like trees as planet not just growing there some I had a plan him husband man right there for car has planted us by the rivers of living water he took us from here and put us there by where by the river of living water Romans 6:5 says that we have been planted together in here in the light of his death amen then we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection we've been praying there you have anything to do with God he puts you there he plants you where he wants you to be at stay there and bear fruit Saniya now stay right when he plants you it and bear fruit right there excuse me and he says that we shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season and his leaf shall not wither we know this that his fruit in his season Luther had to bring forth his fruit in his season and right Wesley had to bring forth his fruit in his season d90 no says Pentecost had to bring forth their fruit in their season this is a different season see this is an entire different season now we're going to bring forth the fruit for we're seeds of God that has come out of the husk it's laying out here now the Sun is coming to shine up on these seeds to bring forth that fruit then when that when the Sun shines you can't do anything about it then you can run you can hide you can jump you can stump but you can't bring forth the fruit that linemate did you can't do it see and then you were crying your said give me the oil so depend up but it's not there but right now before that comes you can prove it right now by your souls being knitted together you see me now right now bringing air forth now in spite of the devil st. now resist you I love my brother I hate the rights of darkness evil speaking of so up because I hate that I'll prove it by my life my life will convict those who do that now that's how you know how you bring forth fruit and the spirit gotta fall upon that kind of tree yes it will it's leaf won't wither no siree the leaf then the fruit amen so we find then that how will we be if we want to be because I trees that's planet then we will be standing by rivers of truth amen drinking and the truth of the word of God amen and bringing forth the proper fruit of the Spirit see the proper fruit of the Spirit and we want to find out about that now if we a tree we're gonna stand God he put he put you here you were Baptist Methodist Pentecostal but he planet you here by the rivers of water the word throwing it up sitting me now you are drinking in the true then if you're drinking in your good tree bring forth good fruit you may come in here if you are corrupt tree you'll walk outside downstairs over your home and you bring forth corruptness no man you come here not see yes that's kind of treatise by the fruits you shall know them so we find them that turn with me to Ezekiel about five more minutes we want to see what the Lord has done here Ezekiel 47 amen for you Scott we want to know David said that we are planted by rivers of living water amen where is the rivers of this living water located at amen praise God after what he brought me again unto the door of the house and behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward for the forefront of the house - toward the east and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house and at the south side of the altar now hold your place right there and turn to revelation 22 it's the same house the same throne the same altar and we find out where it said a whole list but right there revelation 22 and he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of God and of the lamb in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river or was there's D D Tree of Life which bare twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were four but they were they were a healing of the nation's so we fired back over here in the second verse a colon third verse we see that the river of water comes from the throne now here's over in the Old Testament here Ezekiel prophesied is right here and when the man but they had the line in his hand went forth east would he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through look the man brought him through the waters amen through the waters the waters were to the ankles then a man Christ where came to Martin Luther and took them and brought them through the waters ankle-deep then right and turn you from death works in Rome and turn around and took him into the river the living water now Martin Luther walked into the river the water stood there up to his ankles justification by faith he had the faith to go into the rivers of heavy water expanding amen amen now notice now and he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters the waters were to the knees God took Wesley and brought him out into the world also past the ankles up to the knees amen now he went

reached the time right now we're in the water the worst a network don't get out of it abide in me only me can you bring forth the light for the length is in the water to worry it staying there therefore they stayed in that word from the angle to need the loin now notice him and after what he measured thousand and it was a river this is the river that David saw Amon that could not pass over

John 14:12 amen praise God brought again by the prophet of God so we find out because from Ezekiel here he said unto me son of man has now seen this occur then he brought me a cause meat or to return to the bridge of the river now when I had returned behold at the bank of the river were there many trees on the one side and also on the other that's you Davis said you'd be like a tree planted by the rivers of this water here so when you come on back he saw all these trees lined up along the side amen that's you your roots was planted by the waters of living water down in the ground right by the water the water look like this here and stay there now and you drink it in that water that's life amen in terms of me these waters issue out toward the east country and go down into the desert and go into the sea which being brought forth into the seat Ackley's waters shall be healed when it goes into the dead seat and it makes it alive heals him amen shall come to pass that everything that liveth which moveth whistle ever the river shall come because she'll live Christ said that theta that be dead the day coming with a shell hear his voice and live man what he said that's exactly right heel quickness is a cease of God here make it live spirit the by what the spirit is dead but the Spirit is coming to quicken the body to make it live because the waters is coming amen mmm it'll be good to what ails you praise Allah so we find in shale air and water shock because come differ and they shall be healed and everything shall live with her this river cometh shall come the pants that the Fisher's aimer administers shall stand upon it from me from aghia even on to Eaglin they shall be a place to spread forth the nets their fish shall shall be according because the day occurrence as the fish of the great succeed many but notice now abundant Mary places day of alpha and also the marshes there shall not be healed they shall be given to salt then we find only the trees that's planted by the husband man by the rivers of living water shall live to uh out of swamp and what's not the marshes and the mire and land they can't live out there she not to forsake the center yourselves together by the rivers of living water the word you won't live say to me that you may come in for a season go back out you did you must be in with the rivers of living waters going forth but you did and why he planted you there he puts you there may be none shall be plucked from his hand amen so we for it and by the river pulling the bank there on this side and on that side she'll grow all trees because for meat whose leaf shall not fade they shout on with her amen neither shall news how they are fruit thereof or be consumed it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months his season because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary and the fruit thereof shall be for meat and the leaf for the medicine and remember us now by their fruits you shall know them because Jeremiah said the leaves shall be green and it shall not could not be careful in the ear of the drought right now we don't have to be careful flowing amen it's the drought on all around they're looking for the Word of God but to us is flowing all the words the minister in this message now he doesn't have to take one little thought and be very careful because I've milk it the words coming forth amen before here take one little thought and also hold that thought and also picture four or five times very careful amen but in this hour now just stay up there in a word floor throwing up for this is the age for the word to flow swimming the Word of God drink in the waters of eternal life that's what the Bible says amen can you say Amen praise the Lord okay let's bow our heads praise God Almighty God we thank you this morning Lord Father for that word but our the lamp and touch their God we pray this morning Lord Jesus that what has been said Lord a made accomplished what you have sent it to accomplish we pray Heavenly Father that you'd bless your people and may these trees here Oh God may they blossom out in this age and bring forth fruit unto eternal life we pray dear God and ask this in Jesus Christ's name Amen praise the Lord [Music] the tendon [Music] [Music]
