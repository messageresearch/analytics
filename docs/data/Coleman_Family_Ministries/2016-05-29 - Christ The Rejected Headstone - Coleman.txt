TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you may be seated for a moment amen is it wonderful to feel the presence of the Lord all right so now next Sunday not next Sunday October 5th will be the Lord supper and now you know we've been phasing into the third phase and trying to do everything that the prophet said and we remember how his third pull come in and how he remodeled the church and all that and we just did what we felt do by inspiration I've been trying to do that since 1982 but never worked out see just seemed to work out in 1986 so perhaps the Lord will work for us at this time like he has been even in a greater way this time and so therefore we'll be setting things in order worship and uh Church order and communion and different things whatever the Lord tells us to do that we will do and sometimes things will be done we won't have a chance to get back to explain why but if you believe in the leadership then you'll move with it amen so the next communion will be October 5th and we'll just do what the Lord tell us to do in that time and season amen and then we feel that the ministry has been uh tested and so forth and you can see what it is amen is god with it or whatever it is uh you you're answer it amen see so be no questions and just have faith in the leadership it can always show you where I am coming from and what I'm doing and why I'm doing it I don't always have time to to to explain it but I can certainly show it to you amen then of course you still got to get a revelation amen even after I do it amen so praise God so then you don't know who's right but one thing we know he's right so anyway now on this third phase just about five minutes or so here I'll read a couple of quotes from Discerning of spirit then um if God give me the strength I want to try to bring a little inspiration then I can be able to rest amen so that's why we got the church here today I couldn't do it on the Lord's Supper because we got to take an hour or so for the taking of the Lord's Supper in the foot wash so I have more time this morning now on discernment of spirit just a few just want to post you and let you know why we do what we're doing and so forth now brother Bram said discernment of spirit knowing surely that in the day of judgment we will be brought face to face with this generation and being ministers we will be judges and and the and the people to which we have spoken to and the attitude towards the word that we bring them will determine their Eternal destination so now you understand why I'm careful to bring what I'm bringing amen because you're being judged you see and then that's why that whole second phase was crying out for Holy decency please don't say nothing if you don't understand it's better to leave but don't sit there and complain and come against it cuz see you were being judged amen praise God see and the people which we have to which we have spoken uh spoken to in their attitude toward the word that we bring them will determine that Eternal destination therefore Lord in that day we would be a judge for or against the generation that we preach to we might leave here this morning so filled with the holy spirit that we would be more determined than ever before in life to carry the message to the dying generation that we're living in you feel that way amen so may God change our understanding this morning and we go go out of here on a third phase new people with a new Purpose with a new hope with a new determination that I'm going to be like Jesus amen so now you may be in a little group somewhere might be 10 or 12 of you maybe in another state somewhere seem like you can't get nothing going and then you just go on with the same old thing over and over and over but if somebody will die and start it then that one will be able to bring Christ to their lips then the next another one will catch you with a new birth and another one until the whole group in your state is all full of the new birth and brotherly kindness and goodness of God but who's going to start it I challenge you to start it am man that's dying to the flesh praise God so we might want to leave here to carry the message to the dying generation that we living in hear us Lord and speak to us through the word we ask in the name of thy son and our Savior Jesus Christ amen so therefore um now the church speaking about I'm going to have to cut some here um the church page five he said the New Testament Prophet is a preacher we all know that just any Minister that's a preacher is a prophet a new testament Prophet not the old if he's prophesying preaching not to try to edify himself to make a big name or edify his organization which he should be in in organization here I am without one brother R speaking telling them now amen but yet preaching you should be that's right now every man ought to have a church home you ought to have a place not just to float about from Pillar To Post now look at the message today I got my tapes I don't need you I got my books and they're floating about from place to place in the message yet and here's what the prophet said you ought to have a place uh that you can go to and you call it your church somewhere you pay your tithe and somewhere that you help support the cause take your choice but then don't never disfellowship the other man because he don't belong with your group discern his Spirit you know if he's preaching something that you don't understand well discern his spirit and say what's he trying to achieve what is the end of his prophecy is something good amen to bring Christ down for adoption and bless everybody is that what he's trying and striv him for discern that discern what that man is saying no matter how he's saying it or what which way he's saying it but what is he saying amen take your choice then don't never dis disfellowship the other man discern his spirit and see if he's got the same purpose in heart then you got Fellowship one with another you're working for one great cause that's the cause of Christ I think that is absolutely true and Page Six paragraph 21 just quickly then we're going to just say and you going to remember these things what I'm saying to you now we're just talking to the church it's not to the outside people see this is to this church here amen just take the minist minister today if he has the baptism of the Holy Spirit and and he knows that if he preaches that word it's going to cut his Fame down he's not going to be so popular if he preaches certain things in brother Brown's message such as the baptism of the Holy Ghost rebuking spirits and seven Thunders and things like that it'll cut his Fame down he may have been very popular in Georgia but when he begins to lay them Thunders out they're going to walk away but what is he trying to achieve what is he looking for sure ain't no Fame in doing that there's no popularity there there's no money there they all walk away amen see he preaches that word is going to cut his Fame down he going to put him in a little bitty church somewhere but if God's with it is going to grow and prosper while they saying is finished finish it's growing growing well that's what uh you know Joseph name means to prosper and AD depending where you're getting your anointing from amen well praise God Amen Hallelujah thine the glory amen little bitty church somewhere may be out on the street but he know know that something in his heart is burning he sees the coming of the Lord the shout the voice to Trump he sees it in friend he Nails it down friend a no friend praise God Amen praise God he sees the coming of the Lord he doesn't care whether he has a big church or a little church he doesn't care he tells people you can leave there's the front door oh this this is a man of I ain't talking about myself now I'm talking about man of God that the spirit of God the baptism is in and it'll be the same in Oklahoma somewhere else in Puerto Rico if long as the baptism is there the bodies will react the same amen his heart is burning he sees the coming of the Lord he doesn't care where he has a big church a little church he doesn't care whether he has today's food or no food he doesn't care whether he has good clothes or he doesn't have good clothes he's only mindful of one thing and that's the very life within him crying out he's trying to achieve something for the glory of God and that man in doing so will act the very life of the spirit that is in him he said do you follow me he will act it out that was David acting out the life of in him and then Christ and David was rejected and shemiah kicked dirt upon David and David's deacons pulled their swords out should we cut that dog's head off said let him alone God has B him to call me an incarnate devil praise God glory let them alone God acting it out old New York City you would get some discernment of spirit to see what this ministry is crying out and then you mothers wouldn't protect your children when that Ministry comes to release your children you wouldn't say my baby didn't do it were you with your baby all day long in school and everywhere else but when that Christ and that Ministry Cries Out take your hands off of there listen to what God has got to say oh hallelujah praise God may be seated now listen sister if you're looking for a divorce from your husband you'll never get one he can put you away you can't put him away so get that Spirit out of this church here you cannot get no divorce from your husband he can put you away but you cannot put him away amen I guess that took care of that huh don't put that through this church it's false Doctrine amen well praise God oh we're talking about that spirit in David amen yes sir Now The Same Spirit in David was manifesting fullness in Christ is in the church today crying to the people how of would I have gathered you and when you see separations and differences and Brotherhood broken up in Christian Life one against the other then it makes the spirit of God in your heart cry out you're trying to achieve something amen a true prophet of God a true teacher is trying to bring a church to Unity of the spirit a Unity of spirit that they might recognize God that word that word come on it's the word the word the word people walk away they don't they think is you being mean to them and as you trying to get them to see it's the word in their lives to clean up straighten up keeping that messiahship straight amen true teachers trying to bring a church to Unity of spirit Unity of of spirit they might recogniz God trying to achieve it no matter what denomination they belong to or what about it we have discernment of spirit and you're going to have to have it now on this third phase if you don't have the Holy Ghost you better get the Holy Ghost so you can have discernment of spirit or the devil will tell you anything see we have discernment of spirit to discern the spirit that's in the man to see if it be the spirit of God or not amen see we notice when he was here on Earth he went about doing good I notice another thing that comes in my mind do you noce when David was rejected as God's uh he went out in the city well I just spoke on that already about mistakes and so forth amen and he's speaking about this crippled Spirit you see calling David all kind of bad names and cursing him you see cursing King David and he said no watch this little old up benjamite benjaminite on page 10 watch the spirit of God and the spirit of the devil working now if you notice he was crippled it represents the spiritual of the people today that would make fun of the true spirit of God in Christ manifesting itself see that was the spirit of Christ in David being rejected as a king and today now that's going to mean something today cuz we have a a thought on this amen amen praise God that was the spirit of Christ and David being rejected as king and today when the people make fun of the people who has received the Holy Ghost and trying to achieve something to draw Methodist and Pentecost Baptist Pentecostal and Presbyterians all together in unity that was brother brandom's what he had to do with the denominations and today we have to go out on the third phase to say come let us and rejoice with us to draw them together from tent and white horse rider and this and that and so forth so amen what a commission huh

know oh Hallelujah but David was exposed big enough to hide their own things they can't hide it but David was exposed why he had the spirit of Christ in him did did you catch it when you hide it and nobody knows but when you go on the cross and stripped naked you're exposed that's the spirit of Christ come down down from the cross you exposed everybody is hitting you everybody knows everything about you well then that's Christ and then you forgive them you ask them they ain't never did anything wrong they're never wrong try ask the elers here when they go through the people well did you no

motives is directed that way amen now I've been thinking since the ministry and the first second and third here now very selom I was speaking to brother musco and a brother had left and he come back he now brother mus I like to see the word phase that I hear all the time and I just happened to run across this quote a brother give it to me overseas for something else and I I had it markk for a long time and I spoke to brother my friend and uh I mentioned a quote he said what is that he said this brother like to see the word phase cuz brother says pull so listen to what the prophet said about faase now I've been thinking since the ministry in the first second third phase of the ministry when I first come to shreport I told you people that the Lord that you would lay your hands like on my hand and it would signify the same and the Holy Spirit never failed one time but what told you exactly what was wrong with you I told you then he told me that day it would be a time when you know the very secret of the heart not knowing that the word says that will be I didn't know that then I didn't know that but the word does say that the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart Hebrews 4 now who could understand that God would take Hebrews 4 and give that gift to his prophet in 1946 there's a difference between 1 Corinthians 13 Discerning of spirits this goes past the spirit and divides a su goes into the sockets of your souls that's why people get cut up when that word goes in there cuz they can act so much in the human spirit I paid my tith I did this I did that but when that word is preached by the holy ghost man it bypasses your intellectuals and Pops in there and bring out something you didn't think of or you thought you was hiding oh well that's what this church is all about there's a spirit behind this church see the word is opening up here today and all those who were couldn't understand but hell on you're going to understand today praise God excuse me not knowing the word says oh yeah here we are now that the words you see you must never leave that word you must stay exactly with that word the way it's written don't put no private interpretation to that just say it just the way it's written that's God's word if it says you repent and be baptized don't talking about you got the Holy Ghost when you believe it that's foolishness amen just say what it says amen just say the way it's written that's God's word that's God's heart that's God and God and His word is the same as I said last night that there's a portion uh laid to every age and there's something anointing comes down to project that portion word for that age you see uh and he said he goes on speaking here just just to save time I only see one thing left the coming of the Lord Jesus at any time a Rapture for the church and we got to meet him in the air now these things has got to come to pass in this day just as he promised he would do it now for about five years after that he is had served his time about that second phase see each one of those phases had served his time and he give visions and many of tape listeners and so forth know that there was coming one more phase the third one and he simply drawn out there so perfect there's man sitting here now and he speaks about the seven angels and the third pool and so forth amen so there we are he said one more phase was coming praise God so he had three phases and he had three PS the Holy Spirit told me three phases but today the September 7th I'm tying the Third phase into his third phase who give you us authority Jesus Christ amen okay now let's discern the spirit behind this church December 30th Serv is just the time I happen to have been there and then the Holy Spirit spoke me said return back to New York and start your church January 6 1963 so the inspiration or the spirit behind this church was s is this the time for the Thunders that's the spirit behind this church and God answered that question September 20th 1974 so you're getting free today now you get an understanding today s is this the time for the Thunders you get it straight I'm not the son of man I am a son of man revealing the son of man for the third pull the opening of the word the word is to open up and come to you and reveal the Mysteries the Mysteries themselves come down from heaven as the word of God and the word is contained in the Seven Seals the revealed word and the word that the prophet brought opens the Bible up scriptures you couldn't understand you understand it now it's alive and

Grace Grace unto The Headstone in the hour of judgment you talk about the grace of God you shouldn't be you should be so happy today to know you're going to be sealed and healed oh my glory where are

there'll be no time for Redemption it's all over the lamb done took his book and his redeemed is over as Jesus first preach and was rejected and then went and haunted those that were in there preached to them that were in prison and could not repent no time for salvation can you imagine uh selling your birth right The Headstone and winding up like Esau who could find no place for repentance do you know what that means the place for repentance is blood and if the bride takes the blood off the off the Earth in spirit form then where's the place to repent then what can Esau do he sold his birth right there's no place in the three and a half year tribulation to repent then you just have to die amen there's no place to repent if the dying come up in the second Throne white Throne judgment stand there with the Sheep Nations and so forth oh but this is the time to repent this is the time to get right this is the time to cut the fools and shake the things off you say oh Lord just once

foolishness and God ain't got no grandchildren you all need experience down in front of me here my oh I can leave something of this here the prophet saying he said look at the people here tape people you listen to this tape I wish you could look at the congregation this time I hope you feeling the same way what is it look at the scriptures piling here could it be is the third pole to preach Eternal doomed has rejected the message of Salvation could the third pole come now after whales and deal Gloria and France and the builders rejected The Headstone that roared out in whales Hallelujah was identified in de Gloria come back in France and identifi the love divine and now the builds have walked away and waged their heads and cursed it and yet they crying out for the results of it for their children and the prophet said on absolute bring that congregation under the condition of the word where everybody in that church children all walks under those condition i s ab and they'll have an absolute attack post they won't have to be here in this order term in that place there they could be down on South Street somewhere in Manhattan praise God the Devils come roaring around them and

salute amen hold a c's unchanging hand he comes to you on the third Feast Glory could the third pull be on now I'm explaining this now to the Eternal Doom people here third pool a doomed no why we open up now Glory it's glorious praise God that's rejected they'll go right on just the same now remember all this time Noah's in the ark the bride is sealing with Christ the last member has been redeemed The Sixth Seal has produced itself the seventh seal brings it back to Earth the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him and sat down and claimed what he on what what he had redeemed is that right it's always been that third pull three is perfection now watch the ministry come to its Perfection when it reproduced Christ again in the natural amongst human beings was Christ reproduced on the first phase the second no but he was promised to be reproduced on the third phase the word formed in you and honed into the image of Jesus then you end talking about third phase now third pull amen H he will be reproduced in you did brother Michael ain't that something God him self reproducing me in the natural word made flesh as was predicted as it was in days of lot think people can go right on preaching thinking they're getting saved believing they're doing right believing their organization is growing growing sure and not even a aray of Hope and that Vision was that has been so hard against women see we come to that hour doors closed gone already the book is in his hand think of it could he be on the earth now the voice of the Archangel with the book in his hand and see you're elected I'm going to give you the the robe I'm give you the robe cuz you elected and and others don't even have array of hope I know what you even talking about Lord don't let it happen to me Father wake me up Glory oh for the word of the Lord comes to them and they are the word to the people amen Min come to this Perfection reproduce Christ Christ is what the third phase is all about now let's check out my spirit and my anointing that I have preached and labored under since January 6 1963 okay check me out now this is what I labored under praise God page 41 amen I think I got enough time amen page 41 souls in prison the first three is perfection that's when the mercy went forth second pull was Discerning of spirits of Prophecy first pull the healing of the sick the second was the prophecy that went forth that knew the secret of the thoughts when the word itself was made manifest which that's great but remember the seven is the Finish could this be the Finish pull is all over could this be think of it amen and Jesus ministry consists of three pulls statue of a perfect man page 44 four he says a five full ministry is the ministry of Jesus Christ then if it's the ministry of Jesus Christ it should be a signed somewhere on this Earth of three pools or three phases amen discern it now not the man but discern the spirit that's making these three phases then you know those people railed against Christ and not the man yes Glory so you're going to understand today cuz when you come in at church you ain't going to say nothing against that you don't what you're talking about amen Oh my Jesus ministry okay three pulls be sincere if you ever in your life for a few minutes now his first pull was Healing The Sick he was very popular everybody believed him is that right when he went forth Healing The Sick everybody want him in that church but one day he turned around and started prophesying for he was the word he was the prophet that Moses spoke of oh my the dead was raised two or three times and old the Revelation was wonderful from 64 to 74 come over here Rabbi Jones come to our church and start something here 1964 1974 first pull or first phase and dead raise in front of everybody could that have been the spirit deser that Spirit now don't miss it don't look at that man there was a mail man he was delivering the male the Epistles praise God so you have to understand and then you can be blessed that's why I say it's not to any Outsider it's to this church any outside of say anything about this here and God just pack him out of here if he don't know what he's talking about cuz this ain't no man fooling around here amen praise God this is serious things there being spoken amen it's no Bragging nothing like that but see now that was fine raising the dead and Healing The Sick and Cancers and people call you get that so and so up there six-letter word God's with him prayed for the man he was healed twice and was dying of cancer and called me a six-letter word get him because God's with him brother hun will tell you that was the 1960s God's with him but he's still a six-letter word but get him anyway amen see you don't know about that do you brother Hunt knows and sister keman of course knows still go on praise God you get some understanding today behind the whole thing huh praise God ain't nobody running up and down crazy been at the helm amen oh my see now here's when it gets rough after the word becomes flesh by Revelation seven Thunders and seven voices that's the word becoming flesh second phase little doves which is great a revelation but now the third phase the Finish and then that come my he went to tell them how they were living the things where they were doing he become very unpopular that was his second pull oh my I wonder if it type right back again just think could it be the first healing everybody the second oh it could be Jesus only could be be ELO it could be that's the same thing they did there same now watch see it's the same Spirits living in the same kind of people condemned people that could never be saved because they were condemned be for like Judas is carried so those spirits that was there and curs Christ comes back and curse Christ in the prophet and will come back on any holy ghost man who will stand and those same demons will come back and anoint people today and say perverse things praise God oh let me finish here page 42 Jesus ministry when he was healing SI he was so wonderful that young prophet of Galilee while he makes the blind to say he even raised the dead we got three cases of it he actually raised the dead but one day he turned around he said you Generation of Vipers oh one day he turned around 1975 and 76 you you bullheaded women you oh that theer fly amen see deser that Spirit now that was saying bullheaded woman was it a man was that Spirit hating that spirit of the women in the last days that would be bosses and goddesses was that Spirit crying out against that female Spirit would be Anointed with a bullhead or a sex devil at least some man of God will come to the platform and nail that thing down not Holy Ghost SS now there's a difference amen there's difference between a woman and a lady is got a female and a sister Glory oh my where we at oh my they turn around you gener some vipers you make the outside of the platter clean high and holy you appear to be holy but the inside of you are nothing but a bunch of snakes I heard I thought he spoke sweet didn't like the way you said it so your Generation of Vipers can you imagine a bullhead telling I don't like the way you said that that's the same Spirit of Christ that cries out here today and they don't like the way that said my god well praise God did I lose you are you with me Hallelujah th the glory hallelujah amen well praise God had to kind of wake you up a little bit some of you went into a stoer amen glory glory amen and the prophecy went forth condemning the organization to change they turned against it that's right and finally by rejecting him on that second phase he was rejected you catching what I'm saying the second phase The Headstone is rejected then sweep out for one year for a sign then it's finished then remodel the church and come back and we're ready for the seven Thunder Revival oh what a time oh my glory you made it I made it Mama glory to God Amen oh you understand that's right finally reject him they crucified him and today they Cru they crucify see me the word in the man they can't get the man then they find they can't get the word they find fault with the man you going to find it mainly on this third phase they're going to find fault with the person that's bringing the word amen see they hit that person they don't know who it is you can put the message sleep but you can't put the message he lived on and when that third pull up his minist to come the first healing the six second re now watch was the second you got it rebuking the organizations brother Ram said he said you bunch of denominations you so you cigarettes sucking Flappers he was rebuking that anointing had to do that if it was it wasn't the spirit of John see so deser the spirit on the second phase it wasn't a man was mean but the second pH from Christ to the prophet must rebuke Spirits it's got to say hard things it has no other anointing it could walk out so sweet God bless you how all of a sudden you paint the face Jezebels you don't know what the man don't know what happened to him anointing strikes him glory and what else besides rebuking prophesying of what's coming Ministry of Christ adoption Perfection cripples or walking and things keep prophesying about that have you discerned the spirit now how many has discerned the spirit oh oh wonderful that's about three uh 2/3 then you you that raise your hand the others I don't know but you that raise your hand you're ready for the third [Applause] face cuz I you could not receive it unless I bring this today for you to understand what that was and what this will be then you can enter into it open up all your Gates to the Lord's doing oh let me I'm just lingering here oh then you understand Glory third pull you understand what it is now ently separated from the presence of God they had to recognize that who he was he had to go down there I wonder if his ministry climbs out the same way in the last days as it was and then he drops in here with adoption as the father sent me so send I you the works that I do shall you do also where on the third pull no miny all mines are same Noah priest that's exactly right he went into the ark and when he went into the ark there was seven days that nothing happened now watch his testimony preached to the Doom amen see so shall it be like it was in the days he preferred Noah so the testimony must preach to the Doom before we can leave here I gave my testimony on the second phase rebuking spirits and prophesying that's my testimony but this is not my testimony now something else so therefore the ark the door was shut the family was in Come Thou and the family in the ark he shut that door and that Ark sat there for seven days to testify that they were sealed in and then comes the mocking in the laughing because you're sealed in for seven days with seven Thunders with seven virtues sealed and they curse and laugh once again amen oh I'm trying to finish here my my my I'm trying to finish out here and nail this thing down oh my now any question first ply heal the sick second Ministry he was prophesying rebuking Spirits third Ministry was preaching to the Eternal loss Noah's testimony before you go preach to the Doom first with a testimony of witness has we come to this hour church I'm trying to close now

is Grace to serve the Lord amen no more fear and wondering uh you know now remember we cannot preach to the Doom let me say it again so you don't get mixed up until we are first formed to the word image then adopted Vindicated and sealed into the kingdom of God and given the ministry of Jesus Christ manifested then Christ in the form of the pill of fire lives in us and he preaches to the Doom with a Ministry of witness that we are sealed in the ark do you understand what your commission is is to receive the Holy Ghost and form yourself into the word image he stands here with the rob you can have it if you want or you can turn it down so let's bring forth The Headstone with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto The Headstone right in the very hour of judgment we have Grace because Joseph affection The Headstone in us there's nothing against him the very the word for this age is nothing against you in this judgment so strive to be positioning place to escape these plagues oh my now we

speaking here page eight message of Grace I'mma pick up my scripture and finish we all acen with the scripture that reads the Bible we know is doing the time of the preparation restoration of the temple and zeru was a great Prince he was the type of Jesus Christ of the people who had laid the foundation in the billing now I want you to put on your spiritual thinking anointing jacket this morning as we think and this great Prince had determined to rebuild the house of the Lord and then when he did he had laid the foundation stone and he's a type of Christ and as you read on farther we find out that God said Zer rubal had laid the foundation with his hands he also also shall bring forth The Headstone here's my point I want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the Cornerstone he shall bring forth The Headstone now what happened on September the 8th the Cornerstone was laid in the spirit the coming of The Headstone and the Cornerstone was laid from Isaiah 28:16 you didn't even know it then on September 15 reach down into that Cornerstone and pull out a manifestation of the sons of God and walk over to d marblo right in front of you then there was six more

scripture says that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone he's also the headstone and that's why Peter identified that Cornerstone as The Headstone in Acts 4 and so shall we identify that Cornerstone of Ephesians 2:20 we shall identify here as The Headstone Capstone it's going to be identified signs wonders and miracles so I'll finish here so now if we think for a few minutes the seventh Church age messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit virtue and knowledge and that's the power not by power not
