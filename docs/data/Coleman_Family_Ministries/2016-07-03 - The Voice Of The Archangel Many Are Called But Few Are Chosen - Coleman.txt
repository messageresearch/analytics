TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Well, since you're standing, let us read the word. Amen. Just a few moments. Praise God to exhort you along the way. Everybody's getting ready to go. I don't know what I'm going to say. I didn't have the time to study. I was really working on my Tulsa message right up to uh quarter to 7. So then I switched over and just jot down a few notes here tonight. But I'd like to invite your attention to to this to to the Gospel of St. John the 14th chapter. Amen. And St. Matthew 22 11-14. Now, New York, this means something. Now, this is setting uh just a little simple thought, but it's kind of setting the tone for the season coming in. Ma St. St. Matthew 22 and 1 Thessalonians 4 St. John 14. Let not your heart be troubled. Ye believe in God, believe also in me. Jesus was telling these Jews, "Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in Elohim, believe also in me because Elohim is veiled in me." Praise God. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also. Hallelujah. Amen. and 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and uh 16th verse. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, with the trump of God, and dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. And also u I just want to read for little context. It's in Matthew 22. Amen. And uh well maybe we'll just uh pray over the what I'm going to read. Amen. And then I'll let you see it. Heavenly Father, Lord, just talking to the church before we go to Tulsa and all what's going on. And we're looking forward to a mighty outpouring of the token to seal up the people that's not sealed. Amen. And to refill and heal the people and bless them and kind of put them in the in the season and Lord God and may it be broadcast out to those who don't have the token. Amen. But tonight, Father, I believe that those who don't have it can be sealed right here. [Applause] Amen. For brother Gabriel told me that the Lord did that for the people in his church who was who wasn't going to to Tulsa. I have some hair that's not going Lord tonight they can father receive a blessing. They can be sealed and heal or whatever. They don't have to wait. So, Father, may you anoint the word that is read and was read and will be read and will be spoken. Lord God, may you confirm it. Hallelujah. And pour out the Holy Spirit upon the people. We pray and ask and strengthen me and ask the blessing in Jesus' name. You may be seated. Amen. For context, the marriage feast. So, you can read it with me saying Matthew 22. So, let them want to keep you stand up too long. And Jesus answered and spake unto them again in parables and said, "The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son, and sent forth his servants to call them that are bidden to the wedding, and they would not come." And again, he sent forth other servants, saying, "Tell them what you are bidden. Behold, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen, and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come unto the marriage." But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise, and the remnant took his servants, and intreated them spitefully, and slew them. But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth, and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. Then saith he to the servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as you shall find bit to the marriage. So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both. Now notice, both bad and good. And the wedding was furnished with guests, bad and good. And now I want to strike the 11th through 14. And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there was a man which had not on a wedding garment, and he saith unto him, friend, how canst thou hither camest thou hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. And you begin to understand my preaching. I don't want you to be speechless before the voice. [Music] Amen. So my then said the king uh to the servants, bind him head and foot and take him away and cast him into out of darkness. There shall be weeping and nashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen. Oh may the Holy Spirit take the words that was read and stick them into your soul. May it stir you up. Many are called, but few are chosen and many have the wrong attitude after they were called. They're busy. They got to do this. They got to go to their farm and they got to get married and all kind of excuses. And no doubt when you come to the message and read the Bible, you say, "Well, how could those people do something like that?" When you heard Malachi 4's message, but it's been about 20 years now. I see them doing all kind of things now. Amen. But when they were called, they were on fire. But where are they at now? Where are they at now? They falling right back into the word like these was there. Oh my. A little thought. The voice of the archangel. Little subject. Many are called but few are chosen and inspiration positionally placed in time. Amen. Amen. And now pray. We just come through the series of the token. And now we can say uh President Reagan, do you have the token? We can say to all the dignitaries in the message that knew the prophet, do you have the token? We can say to all the mighty apostles and evangelists that's been roaring across the world, do you have the token? Amen. My do you have the token? That's the only thing that will matter. When I see the blood, I'll pass over. Hallelujah. Glory. So the Holy Spirit sent our brother. You may be seated. Owen Palm here. Praise God. To vindicate back to you, New York, what's been taking place all these years since 1974 and 75 and on the field and all the talk that was going on by what was going on in New York. And now you know it's vindicated. Amen. And now you ain't got no more questions. Uh hallelujah. Glory. Praise God. Amen. Then if you know it's vindicated, then you can have what has been spoken. If thou can't believe. Glory to God. Amen. Yes, sir. Okay. You may be seated. Now, I told you in the month of June what I was looking for. Amen. Holy Spirit led brother led me with Paul uh Paul Griffin and told me to go up to Hurricane Mountain. I don't hardly believe anybody's been up on Hurricane Mountain. What a blessing it was to see the cabin and to lean to and the tower. What a blessing it was to meet the guy. Oh, glory, brother. We You going to need him till you dying in. Glory. Hallelujah. My what a blessing. Up on Mount Severance to be severed from your sins to be given a double rainbow as a token. Hallelujah. My God. Yeah. The guy my the spirit of truth may be seated came in the prophet and spoke through the prophet and put it on tape in book form. That was a spirit of truth and a storm came up and led us through the storm all the way to 1985. And now the spirit of truth has led us this far. But the hour has come for wonderful, glorious baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Is that why you went up on a hurricane mountain? You better believe it. Hallelujah.

Now the spirit of truth, the mechanics like Enoch turns into dynamics. Oh my. You mean the mechanics will actually turn into dynamic in the season, in the time and the hours in the hour. Praise God. Let the God that wrote that word, let that God that veiled himself in that prophet come forth and prove that word. Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. Amen. But I thank God he told me, you may be seated. Say, you turn these people over to the guy. You took a revelation since 1964. Jacob, Grace, Joseph, perfection. Then you added to it in 1974 the seven thunders or the seven voices of the seven church changes. And then you try to hold the people with that revelation. Praise God. Which was the spirit of truth. Praise God. Which was bearing witness of what the prophet said. Amen. The prophet said the shout is a message and and the shout gathers a bride together and the seven thunders gathers a bride together. Therefore, the prophet already preached the seven thunders. Amen. Glory to God. And many critics reviled and cursed. They should have come and seen. Come see. Hallelujah. It don't matter no more. The Holy Spirit is here. Praise God. It don't matter no more.
