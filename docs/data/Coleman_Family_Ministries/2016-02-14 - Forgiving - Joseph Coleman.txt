TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Satan Luke 66 chapter 20 verse the 20th verse reading down through the 38th verse i hope to be short with you this morning the last two weeks have been kind of long but i'll just have in my heart to get out these messages for i believe since it is something is six and a half and i believe that god would have this groundwork laid here and disassembly here I'm only speaking about four here so let's think about because anywhere else see but according to your faith be it unto you so just been up my heart to laying the groundwork of love and faith and this morning's message and the other scripture will be fusions 432 reading from the 20th verse we see the Riccio this morning we're certainly happy to have them down for fellowship to be here and to partake of God's blessings with us fun me thank you and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples we'd like to have the Lord to look at you this morning amen chills run all over here for his God you to see the Lord standing looking underneath what he is by faith he's right there that right and said blessed be e poor for yours is the kingdom of God blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled bless it re that weep now for you shall laugh blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company that's got to be you know just the word of God they must separate you from their own company and shall reproach you and cast out your name is evil for the son of man sake now remember this kind of son of man shaking Christ's sake because we're going to drive home this morons message on that grounds rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy can you imagine going through a tremendous trial all kind of things against you when you face it all of a sudden you leap about three feet up in the air uh-huh and click your heels together like that old man did there we're just daughter downstairs there when he found out his sins was in the bottom of the sea they had no bottom he leaped for joy and shouted and praise God and kicked his heels together that right praise the Lord where else where it says here rejoicing that day and leap for joy amen praise God if you want to get that revelation and praise God for behold your reward is great in heaven for in like manner did their fathers unto the prophets but woe unto you that are rich for ye have received your constellation woe unto you get a full for you shall hunger won't you at laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep woe unto you when all men shall speak whether you for so did their fathers to the false prophets but I say unto you which here of your enemies do good to them which hate you bless them that curse you pray for them which despitefully use you no matter whether you think is wrong or or not to it anyway the Word of God says so remember we're being because conformed to God's will see no matter what the situation is see grant and unto him that smite thee on the corner one cheek also offer the other him that ticket away or cuz I cloak a forbid not to take because I could also give to every man and ask you to because of the you know in those days the soldiers would come by and just take things because you know front of people in they will take spoils so he's telling me if they come in not going to do it and take away furniture whatever let them have it that used to happen because the enrollment soldiers because it could ever do that and and gives every man that asketh of the of him that taketh away thy goods askim not again and as you what that men should do unto you do to you do you also to them likewise for if you love them which love you which is very easy what what thank had you for sinners also love those that love them and if you do good to them which do good to you what thank have you for cells also do even the same and if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive what thank have you for tennis also lend the sinners because to receive as much again but love ye for your enemies and do good and Lynn hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and you shall be the children of the highest for now here's the reason why I see this is why you're doing these things for he is carrying unto the unthankful and to the either be there for merciful because compassionate as your father also is merciful judge not and you shall not be judged condemn not and you should not be condemned forgive and you shall be forgiven give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down shaken together running over shall men give unto your bosom for with the same measure that you meet out cuz meet with them it shall be measured to you again what you give out God gets right back to you same mission see so you can imagine if you're given our love has just come right back to you see I'm right from him praise the Lord your fusion is 432 and be occurring one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you they lawyer blessing the reading of his word like a title this morning's message forgiving for giving a little title I wanting to preach finish out a little thought a hand about 22 weeks now on the love of God started about two weeks ago and want it and i believe about about two years ago the lawyer given me a message be there for perfect explain about how we should be because conform to God's will and so now I believe then I wanting to preach about the Fellowship of his sufferings to identify ourselves with him I'd like to explain the words from the dictionary what a 4give means so we're going to have a little teaching this morning while believe that God would have us to understand and to know these things when you have a vision of what God is doing you have wisdom you have understanding and you have knowledge so when you know God you understand then you grow up you see you said well this is what the Lord wants you see and you do it you do it with loving service now now forgive to give up resentment against our the desire to punish stop being angry with pardon to give up all claim to punish our exact penalty for an offense over look this is going to get us this morning I can see that praise the Lord to cancel or remit a debt to show forgiveness to be inclined to forgive so I read the word are there to be inclined to forgive then that's what struck me for this morning's title see because a forgiving means that it means inclined to forgive so therefore the message would be this morning we can because forgive somebody from one thing but maybe you'd want to give him for the next thing but the message this morning is being inclined to forgive for everything all the time as you go forth in his love amen with his nature in you see so therefore being crying always no matter what happens to you any time of the night of the day my god forgive be inclined to forgive now we know that there was only one person that had that nature in him and that was Jesus Christ to forgive he also had the faculty to forget also amen and so we don't have that see we struggled to forgive see because always that maybe two weeks later you know at first I mean because I gave him but what did it do that they shouldn't have done it I can't I can't I can't see why they did it well he didn't ask you to see why they couldn't because why they did it he asked you to forget so if you have a nature in you to forgive which is God's nature you will forgive a man see praise the Lord I see smiling faces around so we know that only one person had that quality and that one person see came and put that nature in us in seed for his very own nature now Ephesians 4 32 says forgiving one another being client too because because we give always see now now here's the punch line even as God for Christ's sake see hath forgiven you na ah praise the Lord other words God in Christ coming down didn't have to do it hey man did not have to do it we were in sin and iniquity see but for Christ's sake because of Jesus Christ died for our sins he forgave us he has forgiven us and we have forgiveness of sins continually if we will be faithful and because confess our sins day by day every day see now trying to get to you now if Christ God has forgiven our sins and we have his nature in us and we must go forth forgiven Amy praise the Lord see now he had in him kindness and love and forgiveness that was God see and Jesus Christ says true in the Gospels he never forces you to do anything see he says if thou wilt if you can receive it say if you can do it he walks along sweetly and humbly never be carried up his voice and said well if you can receive it do the sums up see so Peter don't when you want it to get a higher revelation of how to be like God well if thou wilt this is what you do love your enemies bless those that because curse you and this is only to those that you don't have to do this this is to those who want to go up on a higher plane payment see go up higher where the eagles law and you can look out and see the whole plan of God well I was a Pentecostal baby down there fighting fussing down near lord thank you for taking me up on high and now I see it I understand let me be conform to your will amen praise the Lord see now are you see if you will be perfect other words be there for perfect that means to be complete and being conformed to God's laws see it means to be a mature complete full growth as men all the Lord expects us to do is to mature to his word that's why he sent the word to his prophet now without me you cannot do this so you settle down right now I thought I can't do that I know you can he does it through you as you let him come in he is the word Amen see and and as he would bring us to this final spot which we all know we have reached we have reached a plateau we've been climbing up their mountain by faith we get up here we see all the glories of God for the gods profit shoulders by the word it's there we can see the Millennial Kingdom over there amen it's right there where are we going to live over there some of you might even be right here in New York State you don't know later on see it may have you because your portion here but then when the the heavenly city comes down after then your DNA of course but in the 1000 years you own the way you're going to be here amen because just going to be the bride on there that's all that's always going to be at 144,000 and servants but the brides want it because the meek shall inherit this earth for 1,000 years you see then after that Satan's loose for short season and so forth God reigns down fine then comes down to New Jerusalem say a new heavens and new earth and all these things see but there's going to be a while you're going to be here on this earth praise the Lord so now see there are two kinds of forgiveness i think i just read i'll just take my time this one see we want to get this we want to know or God's will he's going to sit down the power now but we want to see what kind of people are going to have this power in them see them at the 26-28 right now in scripture for this is my blood of the New Testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins now this word are remission is found here acts 1043 Hebrews 9 22 what really is a Greek word meaning of forgiveness but here's called remission see now it means to to send off send away like that scapegoat back in Israel 1-disc able because he went away off into the wilderness SC and throughout all the scripture it is the fundamental meaning of forgiveness see it is to take the sin from the center see now there's two kinds this human forgiveness see human forgiveness means to forgive the penalty that's what we do see now in the old testament and the new way which is a type and fulfillment the divine forgiveness follows the execution of the penalty now that would be in leviticus you write it down 5 10 and Leviticus 435 just copied one of them to show you what I mean I'll read from Leviticus lead and one they both saying the same thing I'll read from Leviticus 435 435 and he shall take away all the fat thereof in the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offering and the priest shall burn them upon the altar according to the orphans made by fire to the Lord and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed and it shall be forgiven him see so the sin is done and then divine forgiveness he forgives that penalty then if you have the nature of God human forgiveness forgives the same penalty on his brother you follow me now other words the man has committed a sin he goes to the Lord is a blood atonement there for his sin disbeliever so then the Lord forgives him now you know he did that so if you have the nature of God and if you are inclined to be forgiving you will forgive it also you will send it far away from him hey man see me and you see him as your brother he may he make because many moral mistakes and so forth had many faults bear ye one another's burdens and so doing you fulfill the law of christ that right she let me know so now human forgiveness rest upon and results from divine forgiveness God did it I do it see he said why because to be caring for he was kind to the evil and to the good that right see now st. Matthew 6 that prayer over there the Lord's Prayer that was on legal ground saying we're laying in this ground Rick or right now so you understand and embody I explained to you could I was legal in this sense I'll reach 6 12 i think i have here 612 i read 11 give us this day our daily bread and forgive our debts as we forgive our debtors so this is legal see because this forgiveness was on a condition that if we forgave you then God could because we give us but we he says right here safe or forgive out this as we forgive our debtors there was that condition we had to forgive the other man and then God didn't didn't expect God to forgive me we didn't forgive him God would never because to give us is legal hey man but now for Christ's sake hey man see difference now so Paul says for Christ's sake forgive me one other because he forgave yourself what you asking is that reference see all the way you didn't even know because asked to forget other man says God came and found you and singing and forgave your saves himself amen it seemed and for that reason for that course forgive your brother no matter how vile it is no matter what it is because nobody could do anything worse than what they did to Jesus Christ said right and he forgave that was in his nature so we are supposed to have his nature in us so therefore we have to because we give also that right see now so now Ephesians 1 32 is under grace he is the grace of God that forgives our sins see so therefore it is done for Christ's sake and we are to exhort it to forgive continually daily over because you have the different scriptures which you all know the different ones divine forgiveness is in Leviticus in Psalms even this morning Matthew 6 14 fusions 17 so forth but human of forgiveness because enjoying to divine is Ephesians 4 32 Colossians 3 13 and different ones st. Matthew 18 which all are you unfamiliar with colleges read it then came 18 21 then came Peter to him and said Lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him seven times seven because till seven times jesus said to him I say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven continually you see and so now our fences must come see we're going to line it up together so they won't be off on one side see now offenses will come and you have to forgive because your heavenly Father does the same thing but I just thought because read the st. Luke 17 if you want to take it down then said he unto the disciples it is impossible that offenses will come it they've got to come see but woe unto him through whom they come now I don't want to be standing in the shoes of those who continually because offend you though you are to forgive them but I don't wanna be in their shoes for he says he it are better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and cast into the sea then that he should offend one of these little ones take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repents forgive him now let's line it up sing it so you otherwise we just go off saying I forgive your brother I forgive you president that means that the brother can do anything no it doesn't mean that no see because um Peter with the fullness of God was because of addison you lating head right down Antioch yes sir safe and trying to make them into Jews and so forth see and when he himself was not living as a Jew keeping the law so therefore how could he make those were because a Christians there because keep the law when he was keeping himself hey man hey hey so he was down here because of simulating so now Paul caught him with an offense so Paul abonnez went up and rebuked him to his face that right see big why for the doctrine see we don't bother nobody outside of the disp over here but if somebody is coming down from because Jerusalem into any are and teaching those brothers who was set free by Jesus Christ who were born sleeves the Christ and telling it because they had to be circumcised and showing them here in the law you have your circumcised brother or Paul and Barnabas the spare loss struck them and brother they rebuilt them yeah see so that's all we do here somebody come around here saying well there's no Holy Ghost on what we have to rebuke that that's that's the doctrine see holy amen praise the Lord it's beautiful holy so you're holding or for just can't let any old spirit come in old sex beard or any kind of thing come in there or you forgive to sit up on shore but you don't let them take over nothing no oh you preach to wear to keep the sweet upset what you have here now otherwise it'd be all full scorpions and you won't know which way to go amen you can't even praise God do anything spirit of dead just move in strengthen you out zoom in no you rebuke seek because love is what collection now we be performed to the mind of Christ amen seeker some might say well they are mean down there they don't have no love well love this correction see what you forgive Christ rebuking he forgave floated Peter and Paul and all the rest and brother branham uh-huh he rebuked all over the place but he had when he went out he was full of love he forgave those brothers knowing that they were babies see excuse me so now see we stay with the doctrine and we die for the stock we hold the fort we can't help it if God has revealed now watch thing I'll just collect the holy spirit lead sea in the land when he God's that I give you the land a judgment 13 but you must have the souls of the bottom of your feet staying on that land you got afraid to get there that right and possess where you're standing you're possessing there that right you get I just don't say ah I have the land glory to God and I'm just a praying for outpouring oh no you're going to go through our fences rebuking ravali that right and you won't have to because if you grant back with love standing holding the fort amen and wait now now here's why that's the type or where they fought naturally that right to get to that spot well today you don't find naturally you're resting for a hot wisdom comes down and reveals another portion of the land to you and you see corridor car that's it and you move up higher but when you get their hair comb Satan oh here he comes who told the Lord didn't show me that we show it to me I want to possess it I'm going to chat with the world I'm going to rip ink for God has shown me that there's three stages by revelation therefore I have possessed that by revelation you don't have it wasn't revealed to you the man fact that you go against the message prove it was not revealed to you now I'm gonna hold forth because it was revealed to me then I go from a revelation to revelation from faith to faith I'm possessing the land God has put a seat in the third stage in the heart and the confirmation is coming with the love of God the dove is coming down the consummation and there which what is in me shall be we become afflicted out one I believe that in it that is he spoke and by revelation arm hole in the fourth I'm hold that ground hey I can't help brother if you believe that we one time and then get all gone up I can't help that see well have a charge hold the fort amen narrow is I forgive your brother you got any cost come and see me like Paul did with the Peter what song they were wit to face the face so if anything enough if it's my little me nothing face to face go see your brother the property go in the back room sit down and slug it out back there and come out in love if a person can come in and face you with whatever he's talking about it only nothing it's just talk I don't talk you see the midnight because it was thus to have the Lord in the person would see you so many run up and down with all kind of crazy reports that's all right they immature sorry but if God ever SAT him down and reveal its will to them they would be because I with you sure same spirit amen praise the Lord well so now we see what the doctrine see and so we see that who are we to follow man's person no no man can stand up and take the seven churches book and there's a biome they could say anything for the Prophet came with a message to say all kind of things if you take one person you can say make it say anything you could take one point that said there's no holy ghost at all another force it because there is a Holy Ghost please a variant on line five must you must not dislocate the scripture that right because they replace the scripture so forth we can move it around anywhere pretty haven't just say it as it is you see so now because he fishes 551 you with me praise the Lord if he's just 50 be there for followers of god as their children walking love as Christ has also loved us have forgiven and have given himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice to God with a for sweet-smelling Savior so therefore we are to follow a man no part of the Lord because God knew that after his person the word in the Prophet Malachi 4 would come with the thoughts of God see give him out put him on tape in book form he knew that Antichrist see will come right out to 65 and especially in 68 and soul down that doctrine in 68 elders wouldn't because run after it 68 c and so let's see it and all of spirits was settled down and then they were waiting for the next year to see what's going to happen sees his song see so he knew that so therefore he said he says follow God see follow God for can Antichrist would come on all kind of crazy doctrines but now on the Isaiah 6 he says arise and sharing for that light has come now notice arise and shine right Sharon but two things that orion's means to be because resurrected from your circumstances from this Laodicean Church you were Eagles but you will bow shackle and federate by circumstances so you laid down prostrate but one day you heard of Eagle coming screaming down arise rather let yourself to a new life the word amen and when the light comes is is for you to see by then when you get resurrected up and you see where you're going the lights in your path then darkness moves in 65 66 67 darkest and gross darkness upon all the people in the world as you have seen it today but then the next word rise which you have done rhetoric is of up by the word and sure praise Allah for his glory shall be seen upon you and after you go through darkness and gross doctor to put all the people then God will quicken the other part the glory of God that you have resurrected up to a new life shall be seen upon you shall be reflected out of you amen that's our promise friend now if you believe the hell to that killa for cuz i have been revealed to you see amen so therefore or be there for perfect now um also followers followers mean to be imitators mimic the gate speech accent manner of life of another it means here to imitate God as children do their parents as your sons and daughters try to imitate you see that's what Paul say hey we're children so that as a child to God the Father watch him see what he does amen seeing natural Spencer now if your father love in the home your children will see the kind of life you live in as a Christian they will imitate you what they see see and we saw God's nature through his prophet because so are we read about it but we saw it amen so now we buy and then he wouldn't a to do if he don't send a sprint to do it with so he sent the word to seven seals and write plus the feet on a seven course meal to give us strength to follow his ways his nature his acts follow him completely see and we can only do this by his spirit which must be in us in the third stage are you following me though see the spirit of gods in you in seed form C and out of that seed is transfer to see yourself is transforming power C and win the seat in you finally at the end of the road meets the the transforming power which is is to come down to quicken you and make you alive for the resurrection it meets it it does something sweet amen praise the Lord see now now also have another scripture here just take my time I have it because about 20 minutes yet hey man acts I'm built up to a point here so stay with me please just laying groundwork to drive home a thought this one see acts 14 17 Paul here and and Paul here and saw the brother here I can't think was named here was up here at the list Rhea here and they was and it's just lame man was he'll appear and if people saw it they thought that Paul was a Mercurius and a Barnabas was because Jupiter and they got so excited that they wanted to make him gods Paul and Barnabas rip off the clothes ran among the people and said this here he said insane sirs why this is acts 14 15 why do you do these things we also are men of light passion with you and preaching to you that you should turn from these vanities on to the Living God which made heaven and earth and the sea in all things that are therein who could not watch who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways nevertheless he left not himself without witness is the witness now in that he did good Haman and gave us rain from the heaven and fruitful seasons killing our hearts with food and gladness and a heavenly father left his son shine on the evil and the good pours his rain on the just and also on the unjust therefore is not rightful for us to want to shut up something from somebody who's doing evil so if we are being conformed to the will of God see we do good as a witness of God no matter how much sinners out here God has the witan in that he has a good nature that's his nature and therefore we are too because imitate God and if we just go out with long-suffering gentleness and kindness and so forth out to this unbelieving world you farming our friends that's the fruit of the Spirit see a faint of it or because love joy and pieces for you inside see out to man because you give our long-suffering gentleness and goodness to God Nick pneus and faith and all humility to God amen sing but that this is a way we supposed to move and so therefore that was a witness to be kind to one another because to forgive one another see it is the law of christ see now arm this law is spontaneous and you have to force it see and you just are spontaneous with him well god bless your brother now like I said now you stay with the word of course don't ever forget that you just stay with that word see but naturally with love you go out to your brother and doing good deeds and kind and so forth because you're moving on see you see Christ law is law see Moses law demand it love it demanded love see what Christ law is love because written in the heart by the Holy Spirit and just come down to the heart the spontaneous see so now on this law death in our hearts makes us in kind to forgive our brothers that right praise the Lord now we got to the point I just want to drive this home for a while now on the tape of the countdown we wanted to play it to you but we got mixed up with the wrong tape the one from the Shreveport there are some things on there which I believe because a lot want you to know about and so I thought the car bring it back to you what a brother branham had said now we know that all natural things or types of the spiritual there right natural reflects the spiritual now water justification that's because courtship see courtship is God calling you he's calling you justify see courtship blood is agreements that's the doctrine like because you get it tonight the bark when that suffer got it because got into the bark to go out the doctrine seeing so forth see that's his agreements see and the next thing is your spirit that's the marriage d-union there's got to be a spirit because to be a marriage got to be because unionized you see by his spirit now because in his courtship to us God calls us he's calling many of us since 63 to be his bride see but we are to surrender to the doctrine and be baptized in his name and so forth seen and then there's to be a union between him and you by his Spirit and nobody seasons actually happened but if something that is in you you know that your wed to him you want to do his will your will is finish would see you become one with the bridegroom and now many people all mix up now what is going on right now we are now in the age of adoption for God's prophet told us that the Mosaic law there was a dispensation of that disposition of John of christ church organization then the outpouring of the Holy Spirit for in 1906 but when God's practic came in 46 he came with to open up the age of adoption see those who were born Sutton and also daughters of God the Prophet came with the Holy Spirit tutor with a message to pour it into the church in three poles see and to bring the Pentecostal church up to adoption for that's the place that God has got to have for us to me because a Coca life out there you see for therefore we must come to that place and that's what we're in now God has been adopted us and he's ready because one to adopt us so what does he do in the adoption he finds one here he looks all around he preaches his words to 19 years k hard for anybody see then he comes with it because his profit method and somebody and Holly you can find anybody who sell out all the way with love for everything of prompted saying you following our friends to be adopted it because it comes with sanctification holiness is in this adoption see the women are told they have a certain covenant they are do certain things in dressing matter and so forth and admit the same thing see then the Holy Spirit washes the whole thing this is right now is the age of adoption we're getting ready to go into the disposition of the fools of town where he gathered in the reservation all things in one himself but right now he's trying to adopt his church to place them positionally in the land where they belong you finally now other words back there because in joshua tear they fought they fought to get a certain spot but over end i think it was january 21 43 and 45 they then had fought the enemies God saw that they was ready to possess the land and so therefore he gave them their portion Ephraim had his own land see God gave each tribe rest from all of the enemies Ephesians 6 13 said that with the shield of faith we shall quench all of the fiery darts of the enemy all of them every single last darkest Satan can hurl at you you will quench it amen therefore is a tight see if you'd also Joshua therefore they receive their rest from all of the enemy now watch God delivered every enemy into their hands unto them so what would that mean over here well a God's prophet is our example one more than 61 one afternoon he's going up to Chicago now he's going along by faith god she's going up there was the Ministerial Association up there waiting for me his enemies so the Lord showed my vision and delivered every one of them to his I just may be sitting here and this one thing he'll be over as a trap set for you so all of his enemies was delivered by a vision to the product when he got there do you know exactly what they were supposed to do and he knew what he was supposed to do you follow me down friends we're coming to a point now where God will give you rest from your enemies right now you gotta fight see but he does that then not you you just stand still you wake up in the morning give to tie your shoe of vision breaks a man are you with me too smoothly pretty I feel a deadness movement here somewhere I mean this is a word of god and we come here to praise the Lord don't let the spirit of deadness moving on you see God is trying to show you this this morning see what you're gonna have to do see me now so therefore i'm giving you his promises why there's people that will never hear this at right never here is eternal I see something that God is going to do with his people sending me now so therefore you wake up in the morning and God show your vision give you rest from the enemy you know exactly what you're gonna do what he's gonna do to so then you walk out how with love how forgiving you follow me now you walk out I'm trying to show you how you're going to go out now see you walk up because forgiving and so therefore you have been given rest by the Lord from all of your enemies and then there's going to be a battle French just remember that see now now i'm robear told that science when science achieves something in the natural god is achieving something spiritual now i'm laying it down off i hope you can hope you can because see people say well yeah i think so for the thing is laying right there still don't believe it Apollo's and so forth that s why after the prophecy of 62 he prophesied about these asses also powders you believe me now amen praise the Lord when science achieved something in the natural God is achieving this is above our own words now something spiritual all the words horsepower because I was Luther the car was Wesley the airplane was the Pentecostals now that ass that is the brash see all of the secrets of the universe is now unlocked to them if for the whole Bible is now unlocked to the bride is right it's right together see now the materials was placed in the earth by the word Amen see me now well nothing made I was not made by the word he bought a spoken word of God placed all of these materials here the inventors and scientists a come-along by revelation by revelation now they build all these things by revelation well d materials for his bride laid in the Bible the materials to build Luther was in this Bible one day fair Luther there in the old Catholic place there he said the just shall live by faith where there's material to worry laying right there amen and God began to build his body the materials lead in the Bible to Bill Luther Wesley Pentecostal and now he is himself is pouring a whole Bible into his bride to be conformed to the will of God to be conformed to his laws to grow up to mature don't worry what you can do now no the capstone will do that he's a dynamic you are the mechanics he will go in you and do the works amen z the father goes in you The Sun will go in you see the father within him see now the whole bottles being poured into the bride all of the word that's why we say brother don't say that there's no more this inductance or for you breaking the word of god I can't see why people can't see that why would they wait to the very hour at the prophets they say everything well back to of the Holy Ghost is every if anything I would keep on saying it cuz was skipping the Bible but they wait to the very hour when God Himself is about to come in judgment and then they begin said there's no Holy Ghost how can they what Spirit says that it drives me crazy thing how do you even say that would you say it what can you do see you have to go on anyway amen see so now um he puts his whole nature it could finally be itself and reveal the true nature of God when it gets all of the word it has to have all the words but all the words God's nature amen see and now we are into all the word now to express God's nature but what's he doing his thoughts is coming into our heart a bed of love see thoughts comes in when he germinates it it'll live it'll be fruit exactly right sassy it's being so nice why we say keep on receiving the word and keep on struggling and trying and pressing on to do good be kind to your brother because forgive 10 that's why he tells you these things see it's the thought of God coming in see and if the flesh to but the press got to die the flesh must die in order to express God's will see now it must be made it to the head the love see and when the seven virtues is made it to number eight love then it's a new creation of course hey man scribes see because what's his name Samson had one faith in God and God put because he brought seven and seven locks of hair and when I got into seven locks of here because because including the love see then it had the same strength back amen and when this little bride with that seed of faith gets in those seven virtues because including love will have the same strength at the head on their Pentecost amen the secret of the power God what the seven locks will be restored back to that Brian amen can you say man that means so be it praise the Lord then it's settled in final now and Satan and he know that you have received it amen see so now now wait now watch in closing how does it for that's the secret that's what I'm trying to bring it because bring you up to hit because this morning how does it go for it well it just so happens that they have a Paula number 10 now come back to countdown what Sciences are doing god is doing same thing see now God had the science had to have seven and eight that's the word Christ see and then he got to have nine and ten mr. brand senia now because she had a test she'd been tested all around safe she stayed with that word doc has moved in growth on become thicker to cover all the people out here but she stayed with that word she was resurrected up the wheat she come out sitting there now and she's ripening right on down laying the presence of the Sun waiting to the right when the wheat is right then we don't know his purpose it's got to be right first when Peter was right on the tenth day up there because it helped a room then the Holy Spirit come down to do what to take a ripe and seed see to take that seat and preach the gospel to nourish and make it grow throughout the world what is a different purpose this time it come down this time to mature to see well since--since that this is now the end time God has something in store hitting them seven thunders that nobody knows anything about except one man because brother brand he knew what they were let's see what we are writing tutor and what they are God will redeem it to his bride she'll know what they are in that thing now we see how does it go forth because Apollo 10 now much to my amazement I happen to look into the time the other day so here and they had you know because all of the d3 flights there I have a look there too apollon I'm the testing mission Apollo 10 d forgiving mission and that's why I appreciate this message this morning I didn't know how to bring this but when I read this this was sunday last Sunday there it said that this number 10 is the forgiving mission are you following me friends other words when this tested the phenomena and bride is ready fine ready to go up it goes out forgiving let us think in praise the Lord now this is what dr. Lowe says the head man he says for these and a number of other reasons directors of the program are anxious to have one more flight before an attempt declared of landing mr. Lowe calls this flight of politan the forgiving mission here's why because he says it will forgive them for any miscalculations now we are not perfect in ourselves I hope you get it friends grow up we are still the same people when that power comes it won't be you to him you still the same person but for Christ's sake God forgive your sins he made you brainless that right this method is hold us until that day we share p blameless well for his very sink when you go out with this power don't condemn don't judge when he has committed judge it to warn the Sun st. John 5 22 and first grade is 45 that right he does all the judge but we go forth in love meekness goodness for giving cuz for his sake he forgave our sins therefore for this appalling to go out here's man knowing that they are not perfect and knowing that they could take a chance in May and go to the moon but they were held God held them they had to have one more mission for it because in case because they found out that the moon is like because I bumpy up there and they can't get our good because some really called they could orbit because who know whether it'll be good because I go up or down see so therefore they're not sure whether they will have enough fuel ago so therefore they want to go on a small mission and see if they can bring back a half a tank of fuel say because they can't store too much you can't have because because too much throw it up on you no weights hey man for their Shore player for them they may have made mistakes are you finding friends we are a and have false but when it goes out when that real nation comes in here forgiving you when that fire strikes your body when the Living God says that you are my son this is my beloved son when that revelation pause until you leap for joy you'll say Lord God I'm unworthy when you come into his presence I that's him a man on doing you see farming our friends therefore if his nature's poured in there he forgave he was going then you go out on this mission the last one to the Gentiles with a forgiving mission oh you followed it in a racecar hope you get it we were right at the door for something French and only the Almighty God to take these this is not me now I just pick it up boy strip that this means doesn't so and just bring right to your vessel see that's for you here is for all of us together but now I'm not grape seed it's just the holy spit because revealing his will his prophet said that in the the because such because the adoption age that the sons of God would because reveal the mystery to the church now he goes for forgiving see now remember science is typing out the spiritual see so therefore dr. Lowe says here forgiving mission because he says it will forgive them for any miscalculations a power 10 will be a forgiving mission because it is limited or because duration short powerful ministry a few orbits or because of the moon that's always gonna be see but no landing because a presumably will bring home with his tanks half full leaving a wide margin for error now they'll go forth and they have the spiritual understand by revelation to have a another mission 24 because because forgive their mistakes what about the bride whenever i'll strikes you you don't want you to go out here because condemning somebody because judging somebody finally our friends now here's the real reason why if you are justified then you know that that you never did it in the first place that's a revelation which because come to your day by day and to be made a reality to you by love see then it's real to you then you know it then you like here you march on said beat me whatever it is that you got their reality you know it that's what because brother branham said when God came down him out there because in Colorado come and take a walk with me now suppose you hear that dear huh the Living Almighty God come down in your home wherever you are and says come my daughter come my son and take a walk with me I'm the unseen captain right by your side my voice is here don't because trust in your own words trust in the words that are poured into you 63 64 65 678 now pour the wording to you trust now the spiritual shall bring all these words to your remember so staying there I'll give you mouth my voice amen I'll give you wisdom and you'll speak it with a special cut right to the heart won't be you now you won't be judging could you have nothing to say it'll be me in you speak are you following me first we are we are coming but now when you go for forgive those that did the worst thing to you now you catch because it's more this message and what's going on right now as a collective group

understand Nestle we he know that he want us to be conformed to his will that's his will you say well why would god is good why it's a good guy sure is judgement belongs to him we don't just nobody amen amen but now the Pentecostal Spirit will judge you kiss you out call you a devil well then you say where it's only a baby their Lord forgive melted what are you talking about but let now that down is flesh must attain to that though it'll kill this flesh to the flesh say well yeah depends off baby answer but the words hey man I'm proud up the Kings Highway I don't care how many surfers get

day I don't know when it's coming but I know one thing is coming soon I know that I believe is cutting right through here otherwise why would I be here yes I believe that the power of Almighty God the works that I do share you do also discernment and stands and what is it powers to be vision is coming right through this assembly right here and we lean around we fall out for no sir it comes to the adoption stage we the progress that I'll know how many times takes you out by yourself on a spiritual mountain that's what he said he'd ask no group to get together and there would be hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah no he do that that was that's back there a Pentecostal they did that this is another age the bride age where I'll take care of this has been a good daughter she's obeyed every word because she had unbelieving husband but her life see her life by her life he'll be safe we'll leave that sister Carla is able to forgive his sins on this mission just remember that that's right just remember that friends why no watch God is going here's why we should forgive the Heavenly Father now is going to forgive now you go forth in power I wisdom signs wonders and he don't want you to judgment by his wife because he himself is going to forgive the foolish virgins himself I hope you get it he himself will say the sheep and the goats go there ghosts sheep nations and so for foolish virgins come on the side see he's he's good that's his nature even in judgment he's going to forgive millions times million over revelation 7 another no man could even mmmm washed in the blood over there you found in our friends there's a forgiving God going to forgive these foolish virgins then how can we go for all the wisdom and try to judge somebody out here can't do it so go forth on this next mission forgiving amen and then praise be to God if you can receive this be it unto you if thou wilt grow up this morning and be you can form the God's laws have his mind in u.s to mine i was in christ the early church and Paul and William Brennan that's the mine that I met my another thing a thing a stirred me down to my toes and brother Brent went better pour rentrer said because it in his little black book he said I will love my enemies he's spoken by faith you do the same thing that's the law of God it's a seat amen well number 10 that right it goes forth in love Ephesians 4 15 speaking the truth in love that will grow up into all things into one that right speaking the truth how in love see go afford half forgetting god bless you brothers take the sin away from him it far away you know why charity does what believe with all things amen hope it's all things and the hope that he will someday come to the knowledge of the truth on here when hours in makes you pure keep you pure amen see so we praise God for this here and even we know on Christ's name when you were on the cross there were seven sayings over there seven voices of God on the cross and the first one he said Father forgive them for they know not what they're doing that right so therefore has a bride go four Father forgive them for they know not what you're doing because they don't have knowledge didn't add add add add down the line see but this is because it image to a person so therefore the first thing you ask for is forgiveness in love amen praise the Lord so now we go forth because we're giving or judgement belongs to the Sun so I have some other things to say here but i just wanted because they close it off the scientist also this last one Apollo 11 they call it the real thing landing they call it landing the real thing so now I thought about that I said we're in some year this year 69 what's going to be and Apollo 11 that's what other credit are we were speaking about 11 that's not because any number where God could do anything there with and we're talking about it I thought about then last money seemed like the lowest a turnover to Genesis 11 and see what happens when they because of because build a city and also at our God says go to let's go down and confound them in Genesis 11 so I don't know what if because if this Apollo 11 has to be 11 amen by the one thing and just as 11 they had built a big towel and God just watched him let him get all fired up that we're all puffed up amen o praise His wonderful name amen please God let them think they could do everything amen Oh who's liking to us Oh Nicole amick back there I loll kind of men everything see you could too wise everything safe and then God watched him so let me go puffed up spirit and then he went down and confounded them see now he has many ways because to confirm people earthquake and things like that amen you just watch the word of god c so now then we're in our tremendous year amen it's praise the Lord and I thought about Apollo 9 and 10 days 19 all God's things C it's also perfect we all understand them but have to be safe now can I have five more minutes I'll have a few more comments here to time with this no finish now I don't know what's going to be our only tell you what the Lord tell me to tell you seem to be looking for anything say to be an expectation it would be like Oh Anna back there is expecting something see and then when that with that kind of expectation God don't find it nasty amen see now what I'm saying to you now this is a this way of life means of death so you could put in the right place now so you won't go out of here leaping up for joy in all you have to die with this here talking about hey it's not flesh works this is dead yes sir see now see it is given to some it is given I said given by him to see understand see and to follow literally in his footsteps amen and it's also given to some to these to bear witness of this connection now hey man can hear you man c is given the some to see understand the will of God they have been become matured and a prophecy and only a few will identify himself with that Oh going that far only now you see why I morning it now I'm preaching to this morning there's only going to be a few from what I'm preaching to you some more you think on it now and what God's prophets say what's in this Bible the identification with the way of the cross how many in the flesh can give st. Jesus Christ when he was baptized and also because was anointed he went forth with this standard because because for our life that's standing lesson because about three years or so that was a standard in that standard he died to his loved ones to normal means of life and all of these things see that we might have life he died daily so he died daily and his white had a diet daily see so here for because he the acoustic fiction it shall reveal the true nature of God see there now is when you're dying see so therefore we couldn't write up to a point now now the capstone must come in then the nature of God comes out and when it comes out is love because forgiveness see but then when they because because the assaults come in all we had a calm sea because I want to comment on the cross yet see but then Father forgive them and the true nature of the kingdom is revealed on the energy that's the way we're gonna be over there see meek and humble that's the nature of God now this will be against man's force see me now love is on the center force it is like on the outside see me now but love because shall overcome force because force is just for seasoning salt see now when this love comes in and is revealed to you it also shows for a corresponding love for others now this life of Christ was not for himself it was for others now we can move up because of the cross we can because identify thought with this word but they come to third stage where we must die for others that means that somebody doesn't to you with love and forgiveness you die who's it for him so death works in you for him he said what I see Christ in his brother here glory to come I see now I did everything to this man here and yet he just offered me love and also because because he forgave me see it now so that man sees the life of Christ he sees God walking on the earth therefore is death to you and life to him that's what Paul preached that right that's we brother branham stood up there full of pain and everything else and brother Billy for Tony because it by the fire out there and because somebody was he'll there and he said well dad won't you speak to worry it's just not for me it's for others that's the lonely walk friend that's what Jesus you see now I mean if now if you can receive this he calls you up on her if you can give up things down here can have five more minutes what praise the Lord the counter how far to go yet see come on go as far as I can a man see so this way will reveal God's true nature to the world as it was revealed in brother branham see it didn't they'll see God the pentecostal foolish virgins and so forth whoever they are will see Christ it's well that's what the Prophet bram speak up and already got I see it I see it I believe this to lately of course you know see well the witness goes out to be a conviction of what dis messages it'll be followed by the most glorious power guy that's exact on the cross to know him in the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings on that cross then you'll know and understand what it's all about but do you rejoice because the father the son is being glorified again on the earth Jesus Christ that right he said when you bear much fruit and we entered into the fruit season The Love here is my father glorified that right so we want to glorify the father when you bear much fruit and you want to see it praise God now then it because I remember he don't force this a true nature on you just remember that now if you can receive see stuff everybody there are those who will camp on unless a ground because because still saved you know but they can't go up there so therefore don't look down try to be caliph them up anyway follow me now friends there's some weak ones who'll kick brothers okay I'm staying there you know well it's all right brother God shall read the other two you see ask God for wisdom amen see you are now I'm a tour son of God now see me now those those Pentecost way you have long since they put them away you don't talk it because against your brother no more those kind that's because i'll pick up any cost and stuff see you bless your brother you pray for your brother amen all praise God let the word come and see and then just spell all the foolishness seen him in now see you got all it against you but you go to your brother you don't run up and down talking against him and saying he's wrong bus to go to him Amy go to your brother say Amen see so now Christ he reveal the full standard my lip and life for three years all right now so now watch these were seat for seed thoughts which he sold like I said in a bed of love heart this remember these thoughts are going to your heart if you believe you can receive it be it unto you you can't do anything loud of you know he's the fire and you are the branches so don't fret say Lord I can only do that just have that just because being kind to forgive being client because to be kind and brother come and do good like you've been doing you follow me and when just maybe someone had you said what I shouldn't even do that for that person if do it anyway what's your father would see so have that mind a messy now now watch things will occur to move you to fear the anger up because retaliation argument and self-defense under such because impulses we leap to force whether by our words what you travel with SC or deed but we have because so we inclined to do that see now where this major a minor mmm seen whether it's just say like because well urge your own view why don't think sister Jones you really do that that's all of you so because she did that I'm gonna do so on so on so because pursuing your own action amen follow me now you die to your own view and Oh what no but I don't uh uh uh I got it man what the fishes must come oh i see lord they must offend yes well let it come but when it can't leap for joy amen see and when these crises call see we have to acquire the habit of dying well now watch and this time you'll know by the Swinton's of the Holy Spirit that you are dying you'll know it so he'll give you witness because he because right there with you now whip this this is voluntary death like I said you want to camp up on the Chi ground now volunteer you'll have to do this if you will you have to content work see now that if you will do it it's voluntary death to normal advantages in the flesh comforts loved ones material advancements because in large income different things because written any pleasures leisure see if we die to these things like Jesus Christ is now there's a lawyer you know a law of a spiritual harvest hey man now if we voluntarily and it's now don't go out and do these things see wait he brings a thing to you and then test you on it then do it then you know don't run out of here now and say well I'm gonna be a big I don't want no money at all no don't do that you gotta live brother the baby needs milk can you a painter and you found me an expo get wisdom with your knowledge amen amen praise the Lord see now if we die when he shows us the will see then we have a right to clean the fruits of the harvest it's a spiritual Harvin's cousin because but tonight's tape I will restore is the law of God he doesn't see all right then we don't count our losses as something that we have been because of deprived of thing but we we buy d because for the the glory of God because embrace these things and also in doing because voluntary death of these things we turn all of the trial so-called child into victories amen tragedies insults and so forth turn into a victory is good is even though it's good amen is turned into a victory see well because you look for it but it was suited for you that's why it sent it amen you know what you need yes so not what you want amen same it out and he said well lord I have a clear vision I'm being conformed to you will I have wisdom I have understanding and I have knowledge so let it be amen and how'd you go see so if we speak it's with because humility tendencies of Christ if we act is with loving service amen see and if if like like I had to because toward one another is hoping all things and believing all things knowing it down at the end of the line that Christ is going to forgive the foolish virgins they have defiled himself somewhere off for one word somewhere so don't get mad at them because if it had been revealed to them believe me brother they would be right alongside you just remember that every the filter is hippie out there if God ever reveal this glorious will to him he would be sitting right here with a haircut and everything sitting right in here clean that's right see but it hasn't been revealed to him if this person in the church has always doing the wrong things being one another's burdens all the false and so forth see me now if God ever revealed that person that they shouldn't do it and that they should be because because the lega because her formally as will they wouldn't do that but because they don't know his will they do that see what you do is your test amen now talking to the Ephesian Church Lord giving because it because you believe oh well right now friends enclosing the identification with the word has been going on a fight and when you can overcome understand what I appreciate because it's morning in line with the message in the Bible see then you have in wit victory and when you have overcome have in with victory then you have in word power ready to flow out and then you want you have by seeing you have a conviction inside faith that is going to be then that by overcoming it gives you a poise like God's prophet because your points walking around so what any word power is flowing out with love love casts out all fear hey hey men sound mind see and you don't you don't fear nothing brother Brown totally bail he said leave he says that I don't fear nothing he says that is just it is going you coming to the same thing come and take a walk with me just like Enoch and to Enoch God reveal his plan of judgment and a prophesied now God's plan the Lord God comes with tent out of the Saints to slay the wicked ones that's your message hello just remember that those seven vials and plagues and all these things here it's got to be told seven thunders and so forth come is gonna because because they reveal to the bride but she'd be taking a walk with her Savior is 10 to our stretch hand same hand stretch it right out to somebody else see and when when brother bran preach these things that he still had love in his heart but he appreciated love see to warn do you Robin friends let us sing his song love lifted me I will sink in Vincent far from a piece for sure very deeply staying with him sink into rise no more a [Music] master don't see her disappear i [Music] live with me say what [Music] let me [Music] good help me [Music] let me love it me la [Music] [Applause] Oh [Music]
