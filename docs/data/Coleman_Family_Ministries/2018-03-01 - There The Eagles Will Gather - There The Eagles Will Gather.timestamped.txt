[0:10] June 1943
[0:15] the Ohio River Jeffersonville Indiana
[0:21] william branham a humble Kentucky born
[0:25] gospel preacher was baptizing his
[0:29] converts in the name of Jesus Christ
[0:33] when a light appeared from the sky
[0:37] and hanging overhead witnessed by many
[0:41] hundreds of people a voice spoke out
[0:46] saying
[0:48] as john the baptist was sent to forerun
[0:51] the first coming of Christ your ministry
[0:55] will forerun his second coming he was
[1:11] indeed the voice of one crying in a
[1:15] modern wilderness prepare the way of the
[1:18] Lord and make his paths straight his
[1:24] simple Christian message called even
[1:27] those professing Christianity to
[1:30] repentance pointing back to the Bible as
[1:34] the infallible Word of God and the
[1:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost as the very
[1:41] cornerstone of the Christian faith deed
[1:45] baptized you with water to repentance
[1:47] but that comes one H&E whose shoes I am
[1:49] not worthy to bear heel baptize you with
[1:51] the Holy Ghost and fire his fan is in
[1:53] his hand William Brennan not only
[1:59] preached but also demonstrated the power
[2:03] of God as he traveled across America and
[2:06] around the world performing great
[2:10] miracles and healings whether it was
[2:15] before royalty or mass gatherings were
[2:19] African natives solo the gospel is
[2:23] demonstrating the power of the Holy
[2:26] Spirit avoiding the nation's they say
[2:28] now we don't want missionaries we know
[2:31] more about it than you do but the thing
[2:33] we want to see is somebody that's got
[2:35] faith enough to make God's Word manifest
[2:37] that's what they want to see an Indian
[2:41] boy who's crippled leg grew to full size
[2:44] in the audience one such incident
[2:48] seen on stage
[2:50] thirty thousand to force a caller and
[2:53] give their heart to Christ maybe I could
[2:56] submit myself to him
[2:58] and he would do something through me
[3:00] that would make you loving more and
[3:02] believe him in the heel that's the
[3:05] granddaughter of Florence Nightingale
[3:08] who was healed of cancer seen here
[3:12] before and after William Branham flew to
[3:16] England to pray for a little boy raised
[3:26] from the dead after a fatal road
[3:29] accident in Finland the incident having
[3:34] been foretold
[3:36] in a vision many years earlier this
[3:39] child is suffering it's been turned down
[3:42] with the doctors to die it's leukemia
[3:46] isn't that right bring the child to me
[3:49] little sister dear the Lord Jesus was
[3:53] here he laid hands upon you and death
[3:56] will leave you and your live do you
[3:58] believe
[3:59] [Music]
[4:04] come out of the child Satan by the
[4:07] authority of God Bible with a divine
[4:10] gift ministered by an angel
[4:12] our journey to leave the child it is
[4:16] reported that never was a child prayed
[4:19] for by William Brennan that was not
[4:23] healed in fact two testimonies of divine
[4:27] healing throughout the world are
[4:30] innumerable and these alongside a
[4:34] multitude of supernatural signs and
[4:37] wonders leave little excuse for the
[4:41] skepticism of modern man look why didn't
[4:46] the world realize that picture there why
[4:49] doesn't it catch that right we want to
[4:51] catch these other things want to catch
[4:52] these prophecies and think you know they
[4:54] can't do it no no but one day I'm going
[4:56] to leave the world and when I leave then
[4:59] they'll recognize it some of you young
[5:01] people realize that after I'm gone
[5:03] on the 19th of December 1965 came the
[5:10] devastating news that William branham's
[5:12] family car had been involved in a
[5:15] head-on collision with a car driven by a
[5:19] drunken driver
[5:26] amidst the terrible wreckage this 20th
[5:29] century profit still retained the power
[5:33] of God in such a way that his hands laid
[5:38] upon his mortally injured wife Meador
[5:41] caused her to be healed but he could not
[5:46] heal himself the gift was for others
[5:52] she was taken to be with the Lord that
[5:56] Christmas Eve leaving behind him a
[5:59] message nearly 1400 sermons that had
[6:06] been recorded on magnetic tape on those
[6:11] tapes he said was a love letter written
[6:15] between the lines to the endtime Church
[6:20] the bride of Jesus Christ
[6:23] [Music]
[6:32] and while we have seen what we have seen
[6:36] these promises in these lazy's what we
[6:40] have seen ourselves ought to put each
[6:42] one of us in action it should make a
[6:44] church they would make a revival here in
[6:46] Phoenix that people be flying in from
[6:48] Europe to see what they can play let's
[6:50] say there's something broke out that I
[6:51] tell the seven thunders of Revelation
[6:55] stand is not even wrote in the Bible is
[6:56] being benefited the power of God they
[7:00] can time here thank the Lord for these
[7:03] books and take center high speed on John
[7:10] the King does indicate what everybody
[7:13] was saying you know nobody knew what to
[7:15] do these man if they pick up this he
[7:24] goes out with it they can make more
[7:26] sense to it so you to bring it to
[7:28] appreciate I just want to lay this feat
[7:29] they're all they make it come to life so
[7:32] what do you say praise God I'm a prophet
[7:41] little message stop sense and the
[7:48] inspiration gives young man like a
[7:50] pastor here let's call them as I'm
[7:52] beginning to know that my days are
[7:54] numbered and the work now that these
[7:56] young man can take this message and
[7:58] sweep it on to the coming of the Lord if
[8:01] he doesn't come and my generation which
[8:04] I'm hoping to see of it daily for him
[8:07] watch keeping myself prepared for that
[8:09] hour
[8:10] [Music]
[8:16] you were speaking about there'll be some
[8:19] standing here which shall not taste of
[8:21] death until they see the Son of man
[8:22] coming in his kingdom paragraph 130
[8:27] after Peters rock confession which we
[8:30] know that his confession is he would
[8:34] build his church upon on this same rock
[8:36] not Peter being a little stoned as a
[8:38] Roman Catholic tries to say it but
[8:41] Peters confession of the revelation so
[8:45] maybe this will understand give you a
[8:49] little insight into my ministry and the
[8:52] New York City Church this church is
[8:54] built upon a confession of the
[8:57] revelation of Jesus Christ as revealed
[8:59] by Malecha not one voice voice is plural
[9:35] to the seven spirits
[9:41] [Music]
[9:47] [Music]
[9:52] good to see you bloody sister
[9:56] [Music]
[9:58] stomach is saying thank you lord
[10:00] [Music]
[10:05] everybody can't be a preacher but you
[10:09] can avoid it
[10:09] if you can't preach the people a sermon
[10:12] if you're a preacher you're going to the
[10:14] pulpit to preach
[10:15] you're still a preacher the bamboo
[10:27] rejected say no one can put a finger on
[10:29] his or her life I want to face what I
[10:33] was saying on this quote in these
[10:36] scriptures dear God
[10:39] we see the handwriting on the wall
[10:42] reacting in time we know that there is
[10:45] great things laying ahead but yet
[10:48] somewhere some way out in this mess out
[10:52] here there's still honest people that's
[10:55] been ordained to length it would be
[10:57] impossible for one man or two man but
[11:01] God all of us together let us spread in
[11:04] every corner we can the good news that
[11:08] Jesus is coming just spread our little
[11:12] bread alone a little worried
[11:14] wherever the Eagles are they'll follow
[11:17] that food whether it comes by taint or
[11:20] whether it comes by a word or a
[11:23] testimony and I like to say here my own
[11:26] personal conviction is that whether it
[11:28] comes by tape I would say the voice of
[11:31] God recordings as long as this venture
[11:36] as it is undertaken by Joseph Brennan
[11:39] brother Rams son and he's in charge of
[11:42] the voice recordings the voice of God
[11:44] recordings and whether it comes by word
[11:46] and we understand there's a written word
[11:49] and is the
[11:50] reveals spoken word and we're so
[11:53] thankful that we have received the
[11:54] reveal spoken word for this generation
[11:56] from the Prophet Malachi
[11:58] or so whether it comes by tape or
[12:01] whether it comes by a word or a
[12:04] testimony Eagles will follow it to his
[12:07] headquarters for it is written where the
[12:09] carcass is there the Eagles will gather
[12:13] there Jesus we know that thou art a
[12:15] carcass that we eat without the word and
[12:19] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[12:22] us we pray God that when we scatter the
[12:25] word by worried by voice by testimony
[12:28] when we scatter the word that the Eagles
[12:31] will find it
[12:33] - the way they do it at Jefferson
[12:35] building
[13:12] [Applause]
[13:28] so December 30th 1962 brother Ben
[13:34] preached at memorial message serves is
[13:36] this the time that titling itself speaks
[13:40] volumes for we went to I know I in
[13:44] particular with questions on my heart
[13:46] did we start this church for the people
[13:48] what do we do
[13:49] and so his title serves at the time of
[13:53] course speaking about seven angels and
[13:55] seven seals and all these things that we
[13:57] didn't even know anything about and so
[14:00] they're sitting there with these
[14:01] questions pondering in my heart on that
[14:04] memorial message needless to say I
[14:06] didn't know what he was even talking
[14:07] about and sealed on the backside and the
[14:11] written seals it was all Greek to me
[14:13] and what I know this that night after he
[14:17] finished preaching God spoke to my heart
[14:19] again I say by revelation when you
[14:24] return back to New York City start to
[14:27] church
[14:29] 20 years the first that's the first
[14:34] wedding camp of my brother's home
[14:35] we're the first couple he ever married
[14:37] 19 years old she was my only girl none
[14:46] of my family came to the wedding
[14:48] it's enough they were made because we
[14:51] followed the Brenin they're coming for
[14:54] seven mysterious buggers it's not even
[14:56] written at all and I believe that
[14:59] through those seven thunders will be
[15:02] revealed in the last days an order that
[15:04] gets a bride together for rapture and
[15:06] Facebook
[15:10] there's something we've got the
[15:12] stepfather we we can't have that favor
[15:14] divine healing harness to be changed in
[15:19] a moment and we had a little Walt on
[15:25] 35th Street one block north of the
[15:27] Empire State Building and there in June
[15:32] we came outside and the younger sister
[15:35] look up in the sky and seen this huge
[15:37] beautiful white cross in this guy that
[15:42] was over the Empire State Building and
[15:44] here's the original photo which appeared
[15:47] September 21st 1964 in the newspaper and
[15:52] I might add that it has a caption a time
[15:57] for reflection so we took the picture
[16:03] and we sent it to brother Branham he
[16:06] wrote his letter back and told us that
[16:08] it was a sign of the intact and in the
[16:12] fate magazine April 1951 was a quite an
[16:16] unusual story one day last summer
[16:20] construction men were working on the top
[16:22] of the Empire State tall building tower
[16:25] 1467 feet above the street preparing to
[16:28] put up a new television mast suddenly
[16:32] something struck the cheek on one of the
[16:34] men then another reaching to his
[16:36] shirt-collar and picked out a grain of
[16:38] something of Honor or other he looked at
[16:41] it in in puzzlement then flung it aside
[16:43] then other men began to notice the
[16:45] kernels falling upon them while they
[16:47] looked in bewilderment
[16:49] nearly a peck of grain fell upon them in
[16:52] this tongue their faces and next and
[16:54] bounced off the steel floor where was it
[16:58] coming from they heard no airplanes over
[17:00] nor did they see any there was no wind
[17:03] or storm though the sky was overcast
[17:06] meanwhile the grain continued to fall
[17:09] tenants along the north side of the
[17:12] villain herder Alan against it windows
[17:14] samples of the grain were taken to dr.
[17:17] Michael Laurel of Fisher chemists of the
[17:19] produce exchange what dinner fighted as
[17:22] barley I believe it was five loaves of
[17:24] barley and two little fishes that our
[17:27] Lord fed the multitudes so we thank God
[17:30] for the barley a revelation of Malachi
[17:33] for seven seals seven thunders and this
[17:37] little scientists fell the north side of
[17:39] the apostate villain where we gathered
[17:41] from 1964 to 1972

[19:22] [Music]
[19:36] and now November 10 1964 again going
[19:42] back to revelation to brother hunt and I
[19:44] are concerning Elijah revelation when
[19:46] they start to church now we need
[19:48] revelation with the preach so there was
[19:50] brother Branham preaching perfection and
[19:53] and unveiling the mighty God and in
[19:56] seven angels thunders we saw what do you
[19:59] preach and November 10 1964 the hallways
[20:03] burials going down to Korea Tuesday
[20:06] afternoon it was wasn't my day off as a
[20:08] mailman just so long that go and talk to
[20:10] the Lord and as I was coming up the
[20:12] steps on 35th Street one block north of
[20:15] the Empire State Building and burdened
[20:21] down with different interpretations and
[20:24] different ministers that would preach in
[20:26] a church and I knew there had to be one
[20:28] voice and one inspiration and the Lord
[20:32] spoke to my heart these words Jacob
[20:35] grace Joseph's perfection and then went
[20:39] up to pray I was stopped along the steps
[20:41] and I wrote it down on a newspaper then
[20:44] I went upstairs to pray open the
[20:46] building up then went to the altar and
[20:47] there the Holy Spirit poured out
[20:49] scriptures and and there was no spoken
[20:51] word most of the time and and different
[20:55] Quotes we'd say of things that have
[20:58] heard on the tapes and then the Holy
[21:00] Spirit spoke to my heart and said here
[21:02] the masterpiece which was just preached
[21:05] that year so there he said Jacob grace
[21:09] Joseph's affection but first here the
[21:12] masterpiece I went home and heard the
[21:15] masterpiece and seeing the foundation
[21:17] was indeed Abraham faith and Isaac love
[21:24] and Jacob grace and Joseph perfection so
[21:28] that is the foundation of this church is
[21:29] built on and on top of it we know we'll
[21:32] be seven virtues seven thunders Jesus
[21:37] Christ will be formed
[21:39] [Music]
[21:45] and now we put the blood of Jesus Christ
[21:47] in and that brings the face of Jesus
[21:51] Christ the virtue of Jesus Christ Jesus
[21:54] Christ the vapors of Jesus Christ
[22:06] [Applause]
[22:09] you're Peters of foundation all right
[22:12] amen
[22:14] so then 1972
[22:19] we bought a church and clothes for in
[22:22] August and October 23rd something
[22:26] terrible happen the church was
[22:28] firebombed and we know was Satan using
[22:33] certain individuals yeah young people in
[22:36] the area and what it was the Methodist
[22:39] Church could not cope with these young
[22:41] people who were using going under the
[22:43] steps to use it for to shoot drugs and
[22:47] they were minutes to the neighborhood
[22:48] and the people were afraid of them the
[22:50] scripture said it would be our pressors
[22:53] and so the Methodists United the church
[22:57] sold it to us at a very good price and
[23:00] took the mulch bag back and gave it to
[23:02] us then we found out why they couldn't
[23:04] handle these young people so we took it
[23:07] over in August and we noticed them
[23:09] they'd come by and look at us and each
[23:12] other like perhaps maybe try to frighten
[23:15] us or scares and we just went on
[23:17] repairing and painting and getting ready
[23:20] and we had a dedication August and
[23:23] August September October 23rd that night
[23:27] the church was firebombed and it went
[23:31] into radio television newspapers
[23:34] everywhere not give a member in
[23:37] particular one that the TV news
[23:40] commentators asking me directly I signed
[23:44] a bill and how do I feel about this
[23:47] and on a1 the person that did this I
[23:50] said well sir sir so I'll feel better if
[23:52] I could find out who he is I would love
[23:54] nothing more than lead him to the altar
[23:56] inside and and what he didn't could do
[23:59] is he'll give his heart to the Lord and
[24:02] he said my that's an awful lot of
[24:05] compassion I'd say so that's what it's
[24:08] all about
[24:09] forgiveness of man and his sins
[24:16] [Music]
[24:24] yeah because my hand my cause it's my
[24:35] piece loser can't do the things that we
[24:38] did
[24:43] [Music]
[25:12] I'm here for that person I'm here for
[25:16] something you know for my family in
[25:19] order to be able to see Christ and me a
[25:23] picture on the charity is our burning
[25:30] bush coming down I want now

[26:07] [Music]
[26:11] [Applause]
[26:12] [Music]
[26:22] [Music]
[26:30] what many questions have have arisen
[26:34] oh are you prophets or the Apostles or
[26:37] who are you and what is your title well
[26:41] that we know brother Browns message I'm
[26:44] a pastor the New York City Church and
[26:46] the prophet of God Himself said on a
[26:49] Philadelphian Church age he says that
[26:51] speaking about the wise and foolish
[26:54] version she says the wise virgins will
[26:56] have wisdom of Revelation to catch that
[27:01] open door that got put down between
[27:04] Wesley in Laodicea and that opened doors
[27:07] Jesus Christ and so it takes a wisdom
[27:10] from heaven as wisdom come down to Peter
[27:13] Rock a revelation to catch that door the
[27:21] door is the door
[27:31] one Holy Ghost baptism is another one
[27:37] some people it is difficult for them to
[27:42] go the word is there is preaching there
[28:00] is this money you know it is one to wait
[28:07] to see ya because we know that is a
[28:11] verse for us and the time is the easier
[28:15] is preached so are you a believer yes
[28:22] [Music]
[28:27] the invitation to roll around the fellas
[28:30] all the rich and poor
[28:32] that's why here's the kingdom of God no
[28:35] sweet guys are little guys they're all
[28:37] one guy all wanna cry so please God my
[28:43] brothers and sisters or whoever that
[28:44] wherever this tape will go to may God
[28:46] richly bless you
[28:48] and for taking our time to listen to my
[28:52] testimony this is my testimony we have
[28:55] for cystic home and my family and the
[28:58] elders and the Deacons and and all the
[29:00] believers in New York City or whatever
[29:02] we can do for the people we try to do it
[29:04] and so may God richly bless you and
[29:07] always remember to pray for us in New
[29:09] York City because it is a rough place
[29:11] where God put us here and we shall
[29:14] remain to the end as a witness of the
[29:16] entire message of Malachi for not a man
[29:19] but God himself bail behind humans in
[29:23] speaking his promises out to his
[29:26] children which is a good man and I feel
[29:28] like Caleb and Amen come on Brandon we
[29:32] are more than able to take the land
[29:34] because God gave it to us
[29:40] the pen Harris conference center 1986
[29:58] when I got a revelation I was in the
[30:01] chicken barnyard but I was illegal I
[30:04] found me a place to jump in the water a
[30:07] man who was baptized in the name of
[30:10] Jesus Christ went back in baptized my
[30:12] wife and my mother-in-law something
[30:14] begin to turn on the inside even without
[30:16] a prophet a man there would be no scream
[30:19] over the barn yo so he was an Eagle
[30:22] heard that scream every little fiber in
[30:25] his body be good to move he recognized
[30:28] that scream there was a part of him it
[30:30] wasn't his blood it wasn't his soul
[30:33] that's something within you that goes
[30:35] way back a foundation of the world being
[30:39] like he wanted to be failing in there
[30:43] screaming eagle took one look in the sky
[30:50] and he saw the ministry of Malachi fools
[30:54] you're going to meet your mind

[36:39] treasure beyond anything that the world

[36:50] prophet shall receive a Prophet's reward

[37:15] to a lost and dying generation
[37:20] [Music]
[37:21] [Applause]
[37:26] so whatever it is but of course the
[37:29] young person who's thinking about trying
[37:31] the world was thinking about going out
[37:33] there and and he's not a hundred percent
[37:36] convinced that it's going to him any
[37:37] harm like my son said yes it's it's
[37:42] terrible I I know it before you're gonna
[37:44] lay things and you think it looks nice
[37:46] and that's the way it always does
[37:48] everything he makes everything look so
[37:49] nice and so creamy and so ice creamy and
[37:52] really it's just like my father said
[37:54] garbage wood paper on top you know and
[37:57] when you get to the bottom of it it's
[37:58] all garbage and it's just a lure of st.
[38:01] and but anyway we started getting all
[38:04] the different things and before you know
[38:06] it we were involved with drugs and there
[38:11] was even I think through some of there's
[38:14] a large chain of people and it was a
[38:16] bank robbery one of my close friends was
[38:19] involved with that and there was
[38:21] killings going on and and it got to a
[38:24] point where around this particular
[38:26] gentleman had such large overhead of
[38:29] lawyers fees for getting arrested that
[38:31] uh he started he started he had
[38:34] connections to get straight cocaine but
[38:36] non-cut cocaine from a friend he thought
[38:39] this elephant big and he wanted us to be
[38:42] his carriers and it was very dangerous
[38:46] when you were in the world in the world
[38:48] can be extremely dangerous and it was
[38:51] life and death that was touching them it
[38:52] kind of grew and grew that worse and
[38:55] worse until point where my boy I was
[38:57] said to be pointy when he in the church
[38:59] and I always had a respect for brother
[39:01] Coleman my God's people my parents it's
[39:04] just something that I wanted to do a
[39:05] whole sudden I realized I was deep in I
[39:08] couldn't get out and I got worse and
[39:11] worse and if you never forget
[39:15] brother Brandon's message my grandfather
[39:18] have probably heard every tape two or
[39:21] three times and I had grown up to know
[39:23] and love brother grams voice and his
[39:25] message and it just comes back to you it
[39:28] was back he said well this man could
[39:30] come the they're hired hitmen they have
[39:33] murderers who would think nothing of
[39:36] wiping out the entire family especially
[39:38] if they think you know something that
[39:40] they don't want anybody to know once
[39:42] you're part of them they don't want to
[39:43] let you go
[39:44] didn't want you to leap alive and I
[39:46] remember the message and their word and
[39:48] I've killed me what I was doing you know
[39:50] support getting into it where I was
[39:52] supplying other people drugs and that I
[39:56] started to take the drugs heavily and
[39:59] I got to a point where I didn't care
[40:02] about anything or anybody just to kind
[40:05] of hurt us to get hurt because Timothy
[40:07] was out there for quite some time and
[40:09] even some had made the remark well what
[40:14] about Timothy I thought you spoke two
[40:15] words for Timothy
[40:16] whatever happened determining is this
[40:18] was said over and over again while it's
[40:21] seemingly nothing once taking place when
[40:23] it seemed like Timothy was still out in
[40:25] the world and wasn't gonna come back its
[40:27] but packet remember when I was in the
[40:29] world and I wanted I wanted to stay in
[40:34] the world other keep keep my demons and
[40:37] nice to see brother : I said should I
[40:39] run the other way you know there's such
[40:42] a presence of God about him then and
[40:45] when he prays that the demons gotta go I
[40:47] thank God that to have a man that has
[40:50] done item like that and the lives the
[40:54] life and has a real burden for the
[40:56] people you could never convince me that
[40:59] a situation is hopeless because if there
[41:01] was a hopeless situation this was this
[41:03] was it but God spoke to ward and I
[41:07] believe it's an example for all other
[41:10] cases that we come that for parent or
[41:15] their lost loved one or for a young
[41:18] person to see is there a hole is there a
[41:21] possibility is there a way back can it
[41:24] break day can we reach the mountaintop
[41:27] can we get out of it
[41:29] these are the hopeless is it impossible
[41:31] or can God deliver can God well this is
[41:35] the example this is living proof of what
[41:38] God can do if you could just hold on and
[41:41] trust him if you believe in any people
[41:43] even that there's a word the word of God
[41:47] and the Word of God it was spoken by
[41:50] Malachi of four and whether it be for
[41:53] the coma or any Minister can get up
[41:55] there by faith and take the scriptures
[41:57] and take the revealed Word of God but
[41:59] when your friend and speak the word he
[42:01] taught us to speak the word he said why
[42:04] Christ speaking more fall and he said
[42:07] all these scriptures in the Bible are
[42:08] ours if we would take thee not just a
[42:11] power but the authority that God gives
[42:14] us as sons and daughters of God and we
[42:16] would stand on God's Word believing on
[42:20] God's Word and quoting God's Word he's
[42:22] speaking the word
[42:23] I'm just standing there there's nothing
[42:26] else that we have to do baba says having
[42:28] done all to stand stand and that's all
[42:31] we have to do is stand it's God's job he
[42:34] spoke the word
[42:35] it's his spoken word and he's the one
[42:37] that must come behind that work and
[42:39] bring it to pass
[42:41] I had been going to a chiropractor and
[42:43] she had taken x-rays of my back
[42:47] and one of the experts showed that what
[42:50] they call a degenerated this what she
[42:52] means was disintegrating
[42:55] she said she could not help me only to a
[42:58] certain extent and in that it would
[43:01] always be that way there's nothing I
[43:03] could do
[43:05] so my pastor brother Coleman he prayed
[43:10] and he spoke the word over my back and I
[43:13] remember the words he used was my every
[43:16] bone go back into place and now here is
[43:20] the disc which you see flown vibrant in
[43:24] the other x-ray you can see it showed
[43:28] this area here was completely
[43:31] disintegrated on an angle and now you
[43:34] can see here that is a it's full and
[43:37] vibrant before lifetime there's nothing
[43:40] they could do to restore that disc
[43:41] absolutely
[43:42] they would only take that fact she said
[43:46] it would take a miracle now that I
[43:48] remember she said it would take a
[43:49] miracle and that's that's exactly what
[43:53] happened Oh God again I did what he did
[43:56] earlier with the Prophet and praying and
[44:00] actually something it wasn't there was
[44:03] there the doctor the one doctor said
[44:06] that every bone and the vertebrae was
[44:11] out of place every way that my back was
[44:13] supposed to curve it went the opposite
[44:16] way and it was completely straight and
[44:18] the disc that was not there was
[44:20] completely home I had my back leg
[44:23] towards wishes you view the x-ray when I
[44:26] turn around I was shocked because you
[44:28] saw the x-ray the bone the back bone was
[44:32] straight up and was oh look my anointed
[44:35] glow and white it was beautiful look
[44:37] like the Empire State though there has
[44:39] straight correct and I begin to get a
[44:41] revelation that God is a pen begin to
[44:45] get a revelation of God as a father and
[44:48] how God wants so much for us and we
[44:52] can't even imagine if I as a natural
[44:54] father we want a blessing for my son and
[44:57] I'm only thinking of a little natural
[44:59] blessing so to speak as compared to what
[45:02] God wants for us I begin to get a
[45:05] revelation that day I begin again to get
[45:08] a revelation of God's suffering when we
[45:11] drift from him and and drift for
[45:13] perfection not even backslide but just
[45:16] here from perfection that what he really
[45:18] wants to give us
[45:21] [Music]
[45:24] [Applause]
[45:26] [Music]
[45:32] I pledged this morning to him with all
[45:38] my heart by his help and by his dream
[45:43] pray that I'll seek daily without
[45:47] ceasing until I feel every one of these
[45:51] requirements flowing in this little
[45:53] statue on July to be a manifestation of
[45:56] the living we just finished service and
[46:19] brother came downstairs and and he began
[46:22] to cry out and I began to cry out also
[46:24] that was the night that God fill me with
[46:26] the Holy Ghost and I'll never forget
[46:29] that night because God had to pin to the
[46:32] floor for three hours
[46:33] and he brought him to me something that
[46:36] I've never experienced before I was like
[46:38] a power beyond any natural feeling and I
[46:43] really felt something changed inside my
[46:47] soul up to that time and since I was
[46:50] born I've been in the church and mentor
[46:53] many meetings and I consider myself a
[46:55] Christian but but till there and that
[46:57] had a real experience where you can feel
[46:59] the college's go through you and that's
[47:02] what happened on September the 4th then
[47:05] your whole life takes on a new meaning
[47:07] and you know
[47:08] you know where you're standing I know
[47:10] that he filled before reason didn't just
[47:12] fill me to stand around and not share my
[47:15] testimony with anyone I can't just tell
[47:17] me to not pray for my family but he
[47:19] firmly for music and I'd like to do all
[47:22] their dog had me do to help somebody and
[47:24] the compassion and love they had for me
[47:26] has really rubbed off and if any Harris
[47:29] in the meetings you just like you feel
[47:32] like that's such a mighty feeling in the
[47:36] Holy Ghost
[47:37] it's just no words to express what means
[47:41] to me my life
[47:53] [Music]
[48:17] [Music]
[48:33] into your heart then when you do raise
[48:35] up your hands and thousands are so tiny
[48:37] large because I'm so grateful that you
[48:39] didn't survive during the Holy Spirit
[48:41] you'll feel the power of God surged
[48:43] through your body you'll be a different
[48:44] person from that little testimony as to
[48:49] whether Joelle when he was testifying
[48:51] Lord how the Lord the Holy Spirit came
[48:55] down and what it is is the Lord has done
[48:59] so much the devil has been fighting
[49:00] joelle other ones and trying to drag
[49:04] them back into the world
[49:05] yeah New York's an ironic place to live
[49:08] in this so much that Satan has so so to
[49:10] speak to orphan but I believe the Lord
[49:13] has presented them something that is so
[49:16] far better and it's starting to hit them
[49:17] one by one that they have something so
[49:20] much greater something that will hold
[49:22] them away from the devil the devil will
[49:24] come knocking at the door but I believe
[49:26] these children know now that they have
[49:27] something in them greater than what the
[49:29] devil can ohon so as the Holy Spirit
[49:31] fell down you know like you can see and
[49:33] what it is it's such a deep meaning to
[49:35] each and every one of them how God has
[49:37] literally dragged them out of the world
[49:39] drugs at a sex out of you'll put them
[49:42] here as a clean vessel ready to be used
[49:44] ready to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[49:46] ready to go out me and sweep out to
[49:48] their friends and their relatives and
[49:50] perhaps some of them still have brothers
[49:52] and sisters and they do out there and
[49:54] drugs and everything else and they know
[49:56] now if God could do it for them God's
[49:58] going to do it for their brothers and
[49:59] sisters so we just wanted to say that
[50:02] that I realize how the devil had brought
[50:04] these before the pen Harris meetings and
[50:06] how almost that close but he came right
[50:09] down that mother Eagle come down yeah
[50:11] Ava screaming these young people realize
[50:12] my god I'm a predestinated seed of God
[50:15] yes I belong to God I always did belong
[50:17] to God and that's the Spirit of God that
[50:19] we felt
[50:20] [Music]
[50:23] amidst the glittering lights of the end
[50:26] time the world stumbles on through a
[50:30] mirage of progress towards her
[50:33] inevitable destruction in a generation
[50:38] where children are weaned on fantasies
[50:41] of monsters and demons the people are
[50:44] being prepared for tribulation and
[50:47] insanity but by the grace of God to
[50:51] those who have believed the prophets
[50:54] message there is a people that is being
[50:57] prepared by the Word of God for the
[51:00] second coming of the Lord
[51:03] [Music]
[51:12] [Music]
[51:27] but the clock of life is whelmed at once
[51:30] and no one has the power to say just
[51:34] when the hand will stop at late or early
[51:37] hour now was the only time we owned to
[51:41] do his precious will do not wait until
[51:43] tomorrow the clock may then be still
[51:47] they just said it one more time left at
[51:49] all you know and it's just such a little
[51:52] time to serve God and to to get back
[51:56] into the kingdom of God and I said to
[51:58] myself I was there praying to God I said
[52:01] Lois I began to get a revelation of his
[52:04] mercy to put me in the Browns message
[52:08] will we be without for the van's message
[52:10] and a word of God for a rapture and to
[52:13] be in the Church of the Living God come
[52:16] Lord Jesus
[52:17] catch away your church and if it be your
[52:20] will Lord just before that church is
[52:23] raptured made our rods power Oh God fill
[52:27] these messes raisin this world once more
