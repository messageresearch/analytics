[21:46] may be seated and then brother then
[21:49] Apostle Paul he come along and put the
[21:52] thing in order at at the beginning of
[21:55] the church seventh Church age to
[21:57] Ephesians and Ephesians 2:20 and you are
[22:00] built upon the foundation of the
[22:02] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[22:04] himself being the Chief
[22:06] Cornerstone he put the Cornerstone down
[22:09] there with
[22:10] faith amen you got it now but under
[22:14] there Peter had already identified
[22:16] Christ that was Christ in the apostles
[22:19] that was Christ in the early bride and
[22:22] then now we're going to have seven
[22:23] Church ages and then then and the and
[22:26] the Chief Cornerstone is the head stone
[22:29] is the Capstone amen but it was an oddl
[22:32] looking Stone and everybody didn't go
[22:34] for it praise God but but uh Peter uh
[22:38] Paul identified
[22:39] anyway and Paul said but as the billing
[22:43] begin to
[22:44] materialize no this is on uh dedicating
[22:47] ourselves rejected Cornerstone as the
[22:49] billing begin to materialize they
[22:51] realize that the hole that was left the
[22:54] arstone fit it to the dot that's where
[22:57] the spiritual bill is today today that's
[22:59] why the bride bilding of Christ is not
[23:01] ready for the bridegroom is because the
[23:03] builders has rejected the Chief
[23:05] Cornerstone that was laid on the day of
[23:08] Pentecost which is the baptism of the
[23:12] Holy
[23:13] Spirit now we already have the stones
[23:17] you are the stones the stones of God for
[23:20] ordained see and we got them all the way
[23:23] from Ephesus Amen to lead AIA we're only
[23:28] waiting for for that headstone that the
[23:30] billers rejected waiting for his coming

[24:27] to the end the last message is supposed
[24:30] to straighten that all up to bring these
[24:33] things to One Faith one Lord one baptism

[24:39] on the pyramid was never put on I've
[24:41] been in cairu Egypt and the camp never

[29:15] stones and uh someday the master stone
[29:19] that rejected
[29:21] Stone when the church got up so far they
[29:25] found out that they had a freak Stone
[29:29] they couldn't find no place it for it to
[29:31] fit but they come to find out that that
[29:34] was the Chief
[29:35] Cornerstone down in Ephesians see and
[29:39] you think Brethren that one of these
[29:41] days we're now watch we're going to

[29:48] God now where's love at it's up on the
[29:52] top amen you're going to find that out
[29:56] and then the great church church will be
[29:58] camped over and God will take it to
[30:03] Glory that's why the the these the

[1:03:00] the church in Christ that's what I'm
[1:03:02] preaching this morning about become one
[1:03:05] because brother Brandon showed us the
[1:03:07] way he did it he can anoint you for
[1:03:09] every blessing that's in the Bible and
[1:03:11] that's why we the holy by God's grace to
[1:03:14] us let us see all of these promises to
[1:03:17] preach them back to you so that Christ
[1:03:19] can come upon those promises that he
[1:03:21] himself spoke through Malachi 4 if
[1:03:24] Malachi 4 said Seven Seals are open we
[1:03:27] said the same thing then Christ can come
[1:03:29] upon Seven Seals
[1:03:32] open if Malachi 4 said you got to get
[1:03:36] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we said
[1:03:37] the same thing then Christ can give you
[1:03:39] the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:44] Ghost Glory see the word must be in you

[1:04:04] false
[1:04:05] anointed they leave things out of the
[1:04:07] seven seal message and when the Dynamics
[1:04:10] Falls they can get
[1:04:12] nothing I hope you see it the nor stries
[1:04:16] that well he says now the pillow of fire
[1:04:20] is identified scientifically by the
[1:04:23] reaction by his character and everything
[1:04:25] else Malachi 4 did that just the same as
[1:04:28] it was when it was dwelling in the body
[1:04:29] of God's only begotten son now watch
