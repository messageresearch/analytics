[31:23] 1964 there must be a supernatural sign
[31:26] from God to vindicate no matter how real
[31:30] deep it wasn't theology how great it
[31:32] sounded if God still would have to sign
[31:34] in vindicating was insulted a junior now
[31:37] the old testament Aaron's plate was done
[31:39] away with the old covenant but in a new
[31:41] covenant God still remains with the Urim
[31:44] and Thummim that is if a prophet dream
[31:47] of the low gene or whatever it is speak
[31:49] something that's contrary to the word
[31:50] and God don't echo it back to the word
[31:53] I'll let it alone for is God's Urim and
[31:56] Thummim now I believe with all my heart
[31:57] is God's Word so we thank God for all
[32:00] these echoes praise God that's been
[32:03] equina back back the testimony and

[32:23] God when his great instrument catches
[32:26] every voice des vins oh every word
[32:29] that's been muttered spoke original see
[32:31] so therefore we must preach what he said

[1:11:04] seven coming around there that new city

[1:13:32] then it comes with joy and happiness
[1:13:34] that gladness and and and the refreshes

[1:14:10] understand hiss gasps Benton Redemption
[1:14:13] page 18 then it is now to get a baptism
[1:14:17] of fire
[1:14:18] what happened Christ came and called the
[1:14:20] church to repentance baptism a name of
[1:14:22] Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:14:24] sanctified the church with the fire of
[1:14:26] God come down and bring out all the
[1:14:29] filth and come and dwells in a human
[1:14:32] heart now the world to be redeemed for
[1:14:35] this redeemed person he used the same
[1:14:37] method he baptized in water after
[1:14:39] Antonia destruction shed his blood
[1:14:42] opponent to Sanctifier and claim it and
[1:14:45] the blood of the bloodied lamb for his
[1:14:48] last 31 years he's poured two blood out
[1:14:50] the original atonement and we minister
[1:14:53] was supposed to clean every promise
[1:14:56] that's why we preach it like this
[1:14:59] claiming it in the plug and now Stanford
[1:15:03] a fire hi his brother Flint the
[1:15:09] sanctifying a cleaning
[1:15:11] Satan child say I'll give it to you sin
[1:15:14] no I'll fire let it be a witness he was
[1:15:17] lifted up for insulin he bought it he
[1:15:19] purchased it
[1:15:20] he's our Redeemer but now it has to go
[1:15:22] through baptism fire holy fire from God
[1:15:25] which cleanses the earth and the heavens
[1:15:27] around them then is purchase so that the
[1:15:30] redeemed can live on it live in peace
[1:15:32] notice the bathroom the fire is the
[1:15:35] cleanest cleanse it from sin sickness
[1:15:37] disease germs sinners devil and all of
[1:15:41] his group he cares to make a fire
[1:15:44] holy fire from God comes down from God
[1:15:47] out of heaven and burns it up to make it
[1:15:50] ready for God it's all in it for God in
[1:15:52] a new world that is to come
[1:15:54] it's the flaw in their head you say God
[1:15:57] he dwells in the human heart but he and
[1:15:59] the pride becomes one and they go to
[1:16:01] their home in the world
[1:16:02] and the same plan of redemption is used
[1:16:05] to to redeem both the oil and the
[1:16:07] persons that live in it do you believe
[1:16:09] that amen where you find this breach
[1:16:14] that huh run across the land fire you
[1:16:18] could find somebody preaching it see the
[1:16:20] heart has to be cleansed like that
[1:16:22] before God could come down in the person
[1:16:24] of the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming
[1:16:26] down and dwell in the human horn it
[1:16:29] first must be repented it must be
[1:16:31] baptized in water in his name the
[1:16:33] shoulder he belongs to then it must be
[1:16:35] cleansed by the blood of Jesus and then
[1:16:37] the holy fire and the Holy Ghost from
[1:16:40] God comes down and burns on all the
[1:16:42] desire of sin all the nature of the
[1:16:45] world and then for he that since
[1:16:46] wilfully out to receive it in out of the
[1:16:48] truth then again the Bible says it is
[1:16:50] impossible for man is born of God cannot
[1:16:53] commit sin he does not send theirs
[1:16:56] for him to sin how can it be of Shinobi
[1:16:58] repeat at the same time how could I be
[1:17:01] in the pawn shop and I had a pawn shop
[1:17:02] at the same time all he redeemed his by
[1:17:05] his blood by his Spirit he cleanses and
[1:17:07] then it comes to the world in us the
[1:17:09] church not the denomination a church
[1:17:11] oh praise God Oh glory
[1:17:19] now when you a most minute when you're
[1:17:22] fully redeemed then you're ready to
[1:17:23] worship King around hoped in spirit and

[1:17:31] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:17:34] hallelujah in the word and the spirit in
[1:17:37] the mechanics and the dynamics
[1:17:39] hallelujah reached debt ministers
[1:17:43] preached to fire of God a man to be born
[1:17:46] again God gets the message brother brems
[1:17:52] hit full on deity he said I'm here to

[1:19:30] was God Himself living in the people
[1:19:33] who's that the intelligence who's that
[1:19:36] the dynamics who's that the person of
[1:19:39] Christ hallelujah praise God
[1:19:42] he's coming in this is a time this is
[1:19:45] the season this is the hour this is the
[1:19:47] appointed time I will visit you Sarah
[1:19:50] [Applause]
[1:19:53] Lauren that was God Himself living the
[1:19:58] people because it was an answer of his
[1:19:59] word
[1:20:00] Jesus Edna st. John for the time was
[1:20:02] coming and now is there God being the
[1:20:04] sparrow with you worship in spirit and
[1:20:06] truth now some people have spirit no
[1:20:08] truth
[1:20:08] others have true the no spirit that's
[1:20:10] what's the nav with the church today
[1:20:11] with full of theology without any
[1:20:13] dynamics in it that's right no matter
[1:20:15] how well we're taught how well we
[1:20:18] believe and how much the Bible you say
[1:20:20] is true and we believe is also has got
[1:20:23] to be the dynamics has got to feed it to
[1:20:25] spark to set that word of fire and make
[1:20:29] a star true has got to have it if you
[1:20:31] don't the church sits still the car sits
[1:20:34] still you will sit still no matter how
[1:20:37] much you say I sympathize I believe the
[1:20:39] word of that you got to have something
[1:20:41] to spark that off to make that 100
[1:20:44] octane go to fire and a big Church of
[1:20:47] God put a moving on there's got to take
[1:20:49] the dynamic with the mechanics nothing
[1:20:51] normally can't put black in the dynamics
[1:20:53] and that's what we're talking about here
[1:20:55] tonight we're looking for the dynamics
[1:20:57] that break out in these meat sale Oh
[1:20:59] glory to God praise God glory and I
[1:21:05] think that's what's the matter with the
[1:21:06] church today
[1:21:07] we lack in the dynamic power to oppress
[1:21:10] this word and make it live for this
[1:21:13] thing Oh
[1:21:15] Oh goddess of spirit amen and he must be
[1:21:19] worship in spirit and in truth
[1:21:21] praise God and that's what's wrong today
[1:21:24] I'm a Luther had his mechanics and
[1:21:27] dynamics Wesley had his and the
[1:21:30] Pentecostals had theirs amen
[1:21:33] and I'll page 16 the same book
[1:21:36] Martin Luther had to be cancer Dianetics
