[0:04] we wanted to have you up today for an
[0:06] informal time of Fellowship not going to
[0:08] preach to you we're not going to let
[0:10] anybody preach to you but we wanted to
[0:13] have a time to get together with special
[0:16] friends you know like brother says you
[0:17] got friends and you got special friends
[0:19] we could have invited a lot of people
[0:21] and some we did invite couldn't come but
[0:24] the fact remains that this is a a place
[0:27] that people from around the world come
[0:29] to uh see they come to see the things
[0:32] brother R talks about but yet the
[0:35] facility itself was never really
[0:37] formally dedicated in all these years we
[0:40] never had a a dedication ceremony of any
[0:43] kind and now that we have the other part
[0:45] in the house which we're going to talk
[0:46] about later we wanted to have one time
[0:49] where we could all get together and have
[0:51] prayer and just have some some
[0:52] fellowship and let you see what uh the
[0:55] continuing Ministry of William Bram is
[0:57] right here at what he call
[1:00] Memorial as you know when brother Bram
[1:03] came to Arizona then there was the
[1:05] question about why did you go back and
[1:07] you know he told on tape the Lord told
[1:09] me to go back and in 19 in late
[1:14] 1964 uh the Lord led him to this very
[1:17] property to buy the house and it was a
[1:20] spec home the man had built like two
[1:22] three houses here in the area couldn't
[1:24] sell them the house laid vacant for what
[1:26] was 2 years or one year and so the
[1:29] carpet is started going bad and
[1:31] everything and brother B made him you
[1:35] know an offer best offer that guy ever
[1:37] had and so uh he bought it and for the
[1:41] next 12 months after the purchase which
[1:43] is late 64 he was uh had the people here
[1:47] and brother Jean was part of the crew
[1:48] and there's others uh putting in the
[1:50] driveway putting in the rock wall
[1:52] because when they bought it it was a
[1:53] house and a car for it that was all so
[1:56] they landed on the den and so we wanted
[2:00] to like I say have you up have
[2:04] dedicational prayer and so
[2:06] forth um and then I wanted to ask
[2:09] brother Coleman if he would just say a
[2:10] few words this is the first time he's
[2:11] even been in here and yet he was uh his
[2:15] church was part of the uh they bought
[2:18] the first drapes and now they bought
[2:20] this second set of drapes that went in
[2:21] here and so uh somebody new like that
[2:24] that would have a fresh perspective
[2:26] maybe on what this place means to the
[2:30] believer you know and so we'll we'll
[2:32] have him say a few words and and then
[2:33] have a dedicational prayer and then
[2:35] we'll give you an official tour of the
[2:39] din that's what all the things are
[2:42] because there's things here that relate
[2:43] to each one of us almost so brother if
[2:46] you'll just take a few minutes and speak
[2:48] to us and have a prayer and then we'll
[2:49] go on to the tour
[3:06] [Music]
[3:11] I want to greet you this morning name
[3:14] the Lord Jesus TR redeem this honor a
[3:19] blessing uh to even see the
[3:23] then before and been out here many
[3:27] times what uh the just never was
[3:31] possible to see it and so I said well I
[3:34] just leave in the hands of the Lord and
[3:36] one day I will to see it I am to see it
[3:39] so therefore today is uh there's no way
[3:43] I can equate the blessing of being here
[3:46] and then being asked by brother sister
[3:48] Smith to come even come into den and
[3:52] then even say a few words and to uh say
[3:56] a dedicational prer so therefore I'm not
[3:59] going to brother George said say a few
[4:03] and so I like to
[4:06] um
[4:08] um draw your attention to First Kings
[4:11] nth uh 17th
[4:14] chapter and uh stand
[4:21] read so this is the William Brandon
[4:25] moral uh library and den and this is the
[4:29] D ation prayer of the den and so
[4:32] therefore I like to match attention to
[4:36] First Kings the 17th chapter verse
[4:40] 8 and the word of the Lord came unto him
[4:44] saying arise get thee to zarit which
[4:48] belong to zidon and dwell there behold I
[4:52] have commanded a widow woman there to
[4:54] sustain thee so he arose and went to Zar
[4:58] and when he came to the gate of the city
[5:00] behold the widow woman was there
[5:03] Gathering of sticks and he called to her
[5:06] and said fetch me I pray thee a little
[5:08] water in a vessel that I may drink and
[5:12] as she was going to fetch it he called
[5:14] to her and said bring me I pray thee a
[5:16] morsel of bread in thine hand and as she
[5:19] said as the Lord thy God liveth I have
[5:22] not a cake but a handful of meal and a
[5:25] barrel and a little o and a cruise and
[5:28] behold I am Gathering two sticks that I
[5:32] may go in and dress it for me and my son
[5:35] that we may eat it and
[5:37] die and Elijah said unto her fear not go
[5:41] and do as thou has said but make me
[5:45] thereof a little cake first and bring it
[5:48] unto me and after make for thee and for
[5:51] thy son for thus sayith the Lord God of
[5:55] Israel the barrel of meal shall not
[5:57] waste neither shall the Cru of World
[5:59] fail until the day that the Lord sended
[6:03] rain upon the Earth and she went and did
[6:05] according to the sa of Elijah and she
[6:08] and he in her house did eat many days
[6:11] and the barrel of meal wasted not
[6:14] neither did the Cru of oil fail
[6:17] according to the word of the Lord which
[6:19] he spoke by Elijah God blessed me of the
[6:22] word you may be seated and we know that
[6:27] in First Kings 171 first verse he said
[6:31] uh there neither be due nor rain but
[6:34] according to my
[6:36] word and so we thank God for the word of
[6:40] God and we feel now that uh in the
[6:43] Widow's house she was ordain of God to
[6:47] sustain uh God's prophet in that time of
[6:51] it was going to be a famine and for the
[6:54] word of God and there will be no
[6:56] water and she had a little room a little
[6:58] chamber upstairs a little D for the
[7:02] prophet to go there and then after she
[7:05] had uh well it's like this it's good to
[7:08] hear the thunder from the mouth of the
[7:10] Prophet thus sayith the Lord and I
[7:13] believe we can all say that for we have
[7:16] been eating from the barrel and it has
[7:18] not uh uh because uh uh gone uh empty
[7:24] and we've been drinking from the Cru and
[7:26] it's not going dry can you say Amen to
[7:28] that amen each one of us in here we all
[7:31] uh have partaken of it the blessings of
[7:36] brother Brown's
[7:37] Ministry and I like to say for myself
[7:40] what it means to me
[7:41] personally uh to be here in the den at
[7:44] this time uh 1965 February during the
[7:48] meetings of marriage and divorce and
[7:51] there was a committee of brothers and
[7:53] they uh spoke to brother Hunt I and said
[7:56] that they were planning to build a den
[7:59] and what we a contribute and so forth we
[8:03] wish you and I saw brother bers that
[8:05] night and at the schoolhouse and gave
[8:09] him a check to work the D and so then uh
[8:13] in the summer of 65 um brother Perry
[8:16] green over here he asked me to um meet
[8:21] him at 10 minutes to 9 he had a 2-hour
[8:25] interview with brother brand so I didn't
[8:28] know anything about it he just said come
[8:30] T night so I was obedient and I went
[8:33] there and uh I walk into the holiday in
[8:36] lobby there was the dining room right
[8:38] there and I see brother Ram sitting
[8:40] there and I see brother Perry facing me
[8:43] I said oh my God
[8:44] this I walked back and I realized well
[8:48] he said 10 minutes to 9 CU brother Ram
[8:50] as you know was very prompt and so he
[8:53] was as later brother Perry told me he
[8:56] says one of our color Brethren just
[8:58] walked up in the hallway
[8:59] so uh and he had his back to me so this
[9:02] was the second time and so anyway
[9:05] brother RAM and per walked out and there
[9:08] brother par brother BR this is Brother
[9:10] Coleman this church they uh want the
[9:14] drapes for den and uh he said oh brother
[9:18] Coleman he said you shouldn't have done
[9:19] that and he reached in he P out a check
[9:23] he said let me write you a check for
[9:24] that so I had his hand I want squeeze
[9:27] his hand on and I said no brother BR I
[9:30] said that's a blessing for us and no no
[9:34] no you can't do that he say uh well
[9:36] brother Coman Jesus said and as much as
[9:38] You' done to the least of my little ones
[9:40] you've done it unto me so I was finished
[9:44] right there and so I said I still felt
[9:46] his hand there I had to bless it amen
[9:50] and so anyway the brother the minister
[9:53] brother that spoke to us and told us he
[9:55] now brother Coleman he said this Den is
[9:58] going to be for the foolish
[10:01] virgins and when we go into Rapture he
[10:04] said they'll be able to come and see all
[10:07] the things about all the e all his
[10:11] hunting trophies and and what what he
[10:13] meant to this generation these effects
[10:16] will be in the den and'll be for the
[10:19] foolish
[10:20] regas so I said well I want to
[10:22] contribute sure but I didn't about the
[10:24] foolish versions but uh I want to be I
[10:27] wanted to contribute to the den
[10:29] so well that wasn't right because we
[10:32] were still here it's 27 years later and
[10:35] so actually to me it was for the bride
[10:39] because the bride has come from around
[10:41] the world to see this T and we are told
[10:46] in church history that David when he
[10:49] couldn't build the house for the Lord
[10:51] because he was a bloody man and but his
[10:54] son Solomon would build a house so then
[10:57] David went on anyway even though he
[10:59] couldn't build it he went on collecting
[11:02] things for the temple and they say by
[11:05] the day standard that he must have
[11:08] collected at least two or three billion
[11:11] dollar worth of things to go into the
[11:13] temple and not to mention with Solomon
[11:16] the gold and everything that he put in
[11:18] there so therefore I say today are
[11:22] greater than solom here amen and
[11:25] therefore the den and what it means
[11:27] inside here in the library
[11:30] there's no way that we can put a price
[11:32] on it because it's Priceless it is the
[11:35] revelation of Jesus Christ to this age
[11:38] it is the end of all things it is Jesus
[11:41] Christ himself that has come down and
[11:43] personally reveal himself the word of
[11:45] God so there's no way I mean you can't
[11:47] put it on the same scale you can't
[11:50] measure it and so I thank God to uh be
[11:54] part of this and to know that these 27
[11:57] years that um uh the the the meal in the
[12:01] barrel is not going dry and the oil is
[12:04] still gr so we give thanks to God for
[12:08] that and the footstep of the righteous
[12:10] order of the Lord and so um uh brother
[12:14] Joy said well what does it mean to you
[12:16] well Breen uh uh what does it mean to me
[12:19] what can I tell you I mean it means that
[12:21] uh just to be part of the bride and to
[12:25] know that uh God called me one in a
[12:28] million uh out of this uh entire world
[12:32] and a journ and me before the foundation
[12:35] of the world and that jourm was in
[12:37] eternity and came down here and took on
[12:39] the name of Coman and that's should be
[12:42] now in time and I had the privileg to
[12:45] see my name in the Lamb's Book so
[12:47] therefore I was transferred from The
[12:50] Book of Life where all life is at except
[12:53] the certain seed and transferred into
[12:55] the Lamb's Book of Life and therefore I
[12:59] thank God I'm able to go back on uh to
[13:03] heaven and John shouted and wept because
[13:07] there was no man uh to open a book and
[13:10] then Elder said don't be J he says the
[13:13] line has prevailed and old my we turn
[13:17] off to Eternity and see the lamb
[13:19] advancing from eternity and coming a
[13:22] bleeding bloody lamb to take that book
[13:24] from the one that set on the throne and
[13:26] John and them wept and cried because
[13:28] every everybody was in handed but they
[13:31] couldn't come back to the Earth because
[13:33] God held the book to the Earth the title
[13:35] thev to this earth and then when Jesus
[13:39] Took the book and Tow off the seals and
[13:41] sent the Revelation down to the prophet
[13:43] just 19 uh 63 March 17th through
[13:49] 24 talking about shouting and screaming
[13:52] and rejoicing I was there and we all
[13:56] were looking for different things and on
[13:58] the Sunday night the seven
[14:00] seal uh they some they would see Angels
[14:04] flying through the Tabernacle they know
[14:06] what they want to see Sunday night it
[14:08] was all worked up and then what I saw I
[14:11] saw brother R step back and step forward
[14:14] I actually saw the face of an eagle so
[14:17] therefore I know what I saw on the night
[14:19] of the seven seal that's what I saw a
[14:21] screaming eagle amen and he's still
[14:24] screaming am praise God so I deem it a
[14:28] blessing and
[14:30] Rebeca and brother George God bless you
[14:32] for inviting sister com I here and give
[14:34] me the opportunity to say a few words in

[18:07] you you
[18:09] [Music]
[18:12] seated this time Rebecca and I would
[18:14] like to give you a tour of the Dan
[18:18] before I do that I'd like to say that I
[18:21] believe each of you know each other but
[18:23] you may not know my children cuz some of
[18:25] you saw my name was pretty small they're
[18:27] not small than long
[18:29] this is William right here our baby and
[18:32] Angela standing next to the caribou and
[18:35] Steven standing by the door with this
[18:38] wife the terries we don't know we have
[18:42] no way KN him terries these are the kids
[18:45] will be giving your kids and
[18:46] grandchildren a
[18:48] tour on later ter so we want to just
[18:54] tell you that we're glad you're here
[18:55] today and when brother Ram was building
[18:58] this
[18:59] cuz he was he was the general contractor
[19:01] he was looking over it but like brother
[19:03] Coleman said there was people that was
[19:05] out you know scouting getting things
[19:06] done getting money collected and all it
[19:09] always amazed me there were some
[19:10] brothers that were going to put some
[19:11] real fancy doors on this place and they
[19:14] thought they would surprised brother
[19:16] Brandon of course always wonder how was
[19:17] you surprising you and so they collected
[19:20] money privately for some fancy
[19:22] doors then when he found out what they
[19:24] were doing he said now we can't spend
[19:26] that kind of money on doors we just put
[19:28] up some panel door do being a man of
[19:30] integrity and being money was ear marked
[19:33] he said we'll go ahead with the project
[19:35] but I'll decide what's on the panels and
[19:37] that's why on the outside of the door it
[19:40] saysa which means in Spanish eagle nest
[19:44] he came to me one day and he said how do
[19:46] you say Eagles next so I rattle it off
[19:48] said well I can't understand it write it
[19:49] down so I wrote it down he didn't say
[19:52] where he wanted to put it years later
[19:54] you know those deaths I saw where he
[19:55] wanted to put it so that's why it says n
[20:01] I have to have George's help on the tour
[20:03] because of the fact that usually I'm the
[20:05] one that's in the house and George gives
[20:06] tours to everybody but we probably
[20:09] there's thousands of people every year
[20:11] they go through the den come through
[20:13] sometimes singly sometimes a groups of
[20:14] 40 50 people uh they come from out of
[20:17] town they they come in school buses and
[20:20] everything to come and see the den and
[20:22] we always want to have it available I
[20:23] don't care what time day or night
[20:25] because we've had people in the night
[20:26] that have come through town called us
[20:28] and ask if they could come and see the
[20:30] den and it's our pleasure to always have
[20:33] it available for the people who feel
[20:34] like that it's an honor that the Lord
[20:36] has given us to allow us to have to live
[20:39] here and to make this available to the
[20:40] people and to serve the people
[20:43] um it's almost 30 years ago probably the
[20:47] first time that that I ever saw this
[20:49] house was nearly 30 years ago and Dad
[20:51] and Mom had been out driving around in
[20:53] Tucson they've driven around for months
[20:54] trying to find a house and looking at
[20:57] different parts of Tucson they really
[20:59] like this Northwest area uh but they
[21:02] they looked in other parts of Tucson
[21:03] also and then one day they picked us uh
[21:06] they picked his kids up after school and
[21:08] they drove us up here and they showed us
[21:10] the house and they said what do you
[21:11] think well you know it was just a big
[21:15] empty house we love the swimming pool
[21:17] this is the house this is definitely the
[21:19] house this was the only one that we
[21:20] looked at was the swimming pool and the
[21:23] contractor was here that day his name I
[21:25] believe was olon if I remember correctly
[21:28] and uh we were getting ready to leave
[21:30] and we were standing at the at the front
[21:32] door the whole family was standing there
[21:34] and dad was talking to the contractor
[21:36] they're looking at one another and
[21:37] Joseph who was only well he had only
[21:39] been 9 years old I guess at the time
[21:40] he's playing around the door jam of the
[21:43] door and he starts he's running his
[21:45] finger his little finger running it down
[21:47] the door jam now dad was not looking at
[21:49] him but all of a sudden dad reached out
[21:51] and grabbed his hand right before he got
[21:54] to the lock on the door he never quit
[21:56] talking to the Builder but he reached
[21:58] down in his pocket and he pulled out a
[21:59] little pocket knife and opened it up and
[22:01] he looked and he stuck it back in that
[22:03] door jam and pulled it out and there was
[22:05] a scorpion and Joe's finger was about
[22:08] you know that far from the door J you
[22:10] know and the contrast just kind of it's
[22:14] stuned when you can you know imagine
[22:16] because he knew that Dad had been
[22:18] looking at his at him and he couldn't
[22:20] have seen that scorpion you know back in
[22:22] the back in the door jam and um I don't
[22:27] know to me that has always just made the
[22:29] house right even when I was you know I
[22:31] was 19 years old then it made the house
[22:33] special and I thought you know for
[22:34] something like that to happen this is a
[22:36] special house and sure enough just the
[22:37] next week they went and they bought the
[22:39] house and started working on it and
[22:41] sister Norman she and Mom they worked a
[22:43] long time uh she helped mom uh decorate
[22:47] the house and buy furniture and rugs and
[22:50] things like this but um until mom uh
[22:54] went to be with the Lord in 1981
[22:55] basically the din room wasn't open that
[22:58] maybe once a year or Mom can get Billy
[23:01] call or somebody else to come and show
[23:02] people through the den but she uh just
[23:05] was not able to take care of of the
[23:08] numbers of people and everything that
[23:10] that you know come through to see the
[23:12] den but since 19881 we've kept the D
[23:16] open for the people Lord we love to keep
[23:18] it on keep it open till it
[23:20] [Music]
[23:21] comes after we're gone fo
[23:25] virgin they gone we're gone they can
[23:28] they can come in here when people come
[23:31] to see the den um usually the first
[23:36] thing they ask is to see Blondie well we
[23:38] do not have Blondie here in the den
[23:39] Blondie is back in
[23:41] Jeffersonville but we're going to go
[23:43] around and I'm going to point out some
[23:45] of the things we do have and George will
[23:47] help me out here uh I'm not real good
[23:50] about guns here so uh about the
[23:55] din
[23:57] yeah most of the stuff that's here came
[23:59] out of the den of jonville which any of
[24:01] you all that that were there and did
[24:02] visit it was a very small room very
[24:04] small room and it was right next to my
[24:06] bedroom as a matter of fact I could lay
[24:08] in the lay in my bed and my door was
[24:10] within this far of my headboard I'd lean
[24:12] out at night and look in there in the
[24:15] din with all of these eyes watching me
[24:18] you know oh just that close but um in
[24:24] let's see summer of 1965 we went to
[24:26] Jeffersonville the din room was BAS Al
[24:28] complete we went to Jeffersonville in
[24:30] 1965 they built crates they crated all
[24:33] the animals crated everything up brought
[24:35] it out here and put it in the den and
[24:37] dad did Place everything in the den
[24:40] where it is now we uh Steven cleans the
[24:43] guns and keeps them nice but we haven't
[24:45] changed the animals around before Dad
[24:47] had it the very last thing that was
[24:48] placed in the den was the Le was the
[24:50] leopard oh boy was the mountain line up
[24:53] here and when dad put that in the den
[24:56] he's got this mountain line in northern
[24:57] Arizona he said that it was a
[24:59] fulfillment of the poem that he had
[25:02] written when he was just a young man I
[25:05] yeah right over here uh called the
[25:07] Arizona line and um that was the last
[25:11] thing that was placed in the den the gun
[25:13] that's on it he was really proud he
[25:14] liked to display the gun on his trophy
[25:17] um and that
[25:18] was 22 okay very small okay grace well
[25:24] again
[25:25] um okay this
[25:30] the lion yes was from northern Arizona
[25:33] most of you have heard named Joe Riley
[25:35] he's older gentleman now lives here in
[25:38] Phoenix he's got a son named Dawson and
[25:41] uh Dawson I think he still has dogs well
[25:45] back then he he was a Traer you know
[25:49] call gu and so he had these very
[25:53] expensive dogs and it's not like the guy
[25:55] that had the the $10,000 cat you know to
[25:57] trade for the
[25:58] 2,000 $55,000 dogs these were $5,000
[26:02] dogs very expensive dogs so when they
[26:05] went out
[26:05] hunting uh he asked brother brand
[26:08] where's your gun we're going to hun big
[26:11] game well I
[26:12] got here she looks at well he says I
[26:17] know who you are you're the only man I
[26:19] would allow to shoot a lion out of a
[26:21] tree with that gun over top my dogs cuz
[26:24] of course if you miss the dog cat comes
[26:26] down here a good dog so uh he shot him
[26:30] with one shot out 22 magnets of course
[26:33] anybody know
[26:34] hun quite some but he was a one shot
[26:36] Hunter he wasn't like some of those
[26:39] machine
[26:40] guns throw a lot of in that
[26:44] direction go ahead well now that we're
[26:48] up in this area the painting he had down
[26:51] on the wall see there's some paintings
[26:52] that you're going to see in the
[26:54] house we want you to just feel free to
[26:56] make yourself at home here today and go
[26:58] through the whole house in fact on the
[27:00] table there there's a guest book you can
[27:01] see where the people do come from around
[27:03] the world but in the house when he
[27:05] bought it there was a painting in the
[27:07] kitchen some Quail around the stove and
[27:10] so forth and in the bathroom some fish
[27:12] and it was done by an artist here in
[27:14] town named K mik she has big studio and
[27:16] stuff and so he saw that you know he
[27:19] liked that work so he commissioned her
[27:21] to paint this on the wall here which is
[27:24] to resemble P Canyon I'll move out over
[27:27] here which is up at the top of First
[27:29] Avenue and uh he wanted the the water
[27:32] running down he wanted to coming out
[27:35] through
[27:35] here well when she had it penciled in it
[27:39] appeared that the water was running
[27:41] uphill he said no no no like this he
[27:43] takes the pencil like this oh water
[27:46] coming down that she added the color and
[27:48] so in P Canyon is where he was hiking
[27:52] when the Lord told him about marriage
[27:53] and divorce he way up in there and from
[27:56] Tucson was when when the cloud came down
[27:58] it it looked like it was old finger Rock
[28:00] which it was but he was back in behind
[28:01] he didn't go up the front of finger Rock
[28:04] he was back in behind there and so
[28:07] that's basically the story of the of the
[28:09] painting now over on the on the right
[28:11] here you see this some of you that's
[28:14] from City might not know this this is a
[28:17] hornet's nest right here this is the
[28:19] Hornets Nest which was in brother R's
[28:21] backyard remember the story pushed the
[28:24] more in and alerted hornets and they
[28:26] came out and he spoke to them and went
[28:27] back well he got it out in the winter
[28:29] time and got it in the
[28:30] house the Bobcat is
[28:36] from there's on a Bobcat now this
[28:40] alligator this is we call him Al the
[28:42] alligator the little kids coming here
[28:45] he's from Florida now brother brandom
[28:48] and brother Welch Evans was out fishing
[28:50] one day in okoi swamp and brother random
[28:53] says to brother Evans I'd sure like to
[28:55] have an alligator in My Den someday
[28:58] a few minutes later he comes Swimming by
[29:01] so brother of course brother Evans you
[29:03] know with that pressure on his mind he
[29:05] takes the or of the boat and cluns him
[29:07] right between the eyes well the
[29:10] alligator goes out and he's belly up but
[29:13] he starts to drift away so brother Evans
[29:17] being Fearless he gets out and water
[29:19] this deep but who knows what H in there
[29:21] to retrieve the trophy and as he's
[29:23] getting back in the boat well the
[29:25] alligator comes too so they had a little
[29:28] wring match and they got him wired up
[29:31] here he is today but U those of you that
[29:35] remember brother Welch kind of relate to
[29:37] that the uh leopard was a gift from
[29:40] Brother Sydney Jackson uh from South
[29:43] Africa and this right
[29:45] here which is a real Trophy this is the
[29:48] Bear That Never Was a
[29:51] cut if you can explain where he come
[29:54] from go ahead this is the bear the
[29:57] silver St G from R British
[29:59] colum brother just come down the
[30:02] mountain no Bush no Rock no nothing and
[30:05] all of a sudden any was I
[30:07] provid now the furniture that you see up
[30:10] here is Furniture it's solid Maple
[30:13] Furniture the brother Brown purchased
[30:15] when he moved into his new house in
[30:16] Jeffersonville in
[30:18] 1948 and of course when you see the how
[30:21] nice it is that shows how good sister
[30:23] Brown took care of things but the chair
[30:25] for sister for Rebecca is that is theair
[30:28] brother Brown like to study when he
[30:29] lived in jille had wide arms like put
[30:32] his Bible on one side no p on the other
[30:34] and that's how he study and that's was
[30:36] his favorite study
[30:37] chair
[30:40] St oh back um I was about 15 years old
[30:45] we were traveling up in the ATAC
[30:47] mountain and um dead pulled into one of
[30:50] these little souvenir shops and bought a
[30:53] couple pillows and black pillows that
[30:55] were filled with balsom and I remember
[30:58] that Mom got very upset with him because
[31:00] they smelled up the car something
[31:01] horrendous I mean just overpowering he
[31:04] loved that have that in his din um fall
[31:08] yeah it's falling apart to smell of his
[31:10] din make it smell like the the outdoors
[31:13] so when we brought the chairs out we
[31:15] brought the pillows out too we kept one
[31:17] pillow there and one over here but just
[31:20] like that one is it's got big holes in
[31:21] it they're just they' worn out and just
[31:24] uh leaving balom all over everything so
[31:28] finally the one that was on this chair I
[31:29] had to throw it away and this is about
[31:32] just about a year Oro about last
[31:33] December and then a month or so later
[31:36] Sister Pam and sister Deborah came out
[31:38] and we were down to a shop here in
[31:39] Tucson we were walking through the shop
[31:41] and all of a sudden I looked up and
[31:43] here's this pillow identical to the one
[31:45] that i' thrown out and it really hurt me
[31:47] to have to throw it out and I'm looking
[31:50] and here's this pillow and this pillow
[31:51] that we found right here in the shop is
[31:54] is identical to the one that I threw out
[31:56] except for the fact that around the edge
[31:59] where the other one was zigzagged and
[32:00] this one has the The Fringe on it um and
[32:03] you know on tape when Dad talks about
[32:05] the Amber
[32:07] Cloud this is the color this is Amber
[32:10] this is the color that dead called Amber
[32:12] so I really felt like the Lord provided
[32:14] us to keep it in the den room here um
[32:17] cuz it's unusual unusual pillow and a
[32:20] find one like
[32:23] thater these Spears up here always draw
[32:26] attention to a lot people
[32:28] attention these were purchased by the
[32:31] Armstrongs when they were some friends
[32:34] ours that lived over in Borneo they
[32:37] brought him back and gave him to Leo and
[32:39] Jean and then they gave him to brother
[32:42] Brown and we assume these are all
[32:44] animal they may be some white missionar
[32:47] we don't
[32:48] know those are from Borneo
[32:52] southf the uh this is a snow shoe
[32:58] up in the North Country this right here
[33:00] is an elephant T that was carved in
[33:02] Africa brought back this is his moose
[33:05] this old gun was an old Trappers gun
[33:08] brother rown traded for many many years
[33:10] ago uh people ask about the bow and
[33:13] arrow well people gave him those bow and
[33:14] arrows he I think practiced some in the
[33:16] backyard but never really killed
[33:17] anything with them um on the arm of the
[33:21] chair are some notes and as you have
[33:24] time you can glance at them please don't
[33:26] be
[33:29] very old that's some brother sermon
[33:31] notes that we laid out there from fure
[33:33] home from future home there probably
[33:36] made on that very chair William will
[33:38] hold up the little black man there I
[33:39] like to explain that this was a gift
[33:42] from Tommy Osborne in
[33:44] 1959 he brought that back from Kenya it
[33:47] was handcarved over there by one of the
[33:48] natives and brother Ram talks about it
[33:50] on a couple different tapes on one of
[33:52] them he says this man took a vow to his
[33:54] God not to speak he says how many
[33:58] Christians have a similar dedication to
[33:59] your
[34:01] God
[34:04] wa um working our way around here um the
[34:08] two big racks above the couch are elk
[34:11] racks from
[34:13] Colorado he love to hunt Colorado all of
[34:16] you big listeners know and the first two
[34:20] guns on this rack right here are the
[34:22] weather be Magnums he's very proud of
[34:25] this weather be Magnum the next gun up
[34:27] is called the 416 Rigby that takes this
[34:32] type of a
[34:34] bullet
[34:36] which great powerful gun the gun on top
[34:40] is not Blondie although it is blonde
[34:42] that was one of the last guns that was
[34:43] given to him as we're all the guns in
[34:45] here were gifts to him the first gun
[34:47] over here is a Remington 721 that's the
[34:51] same thing as Blondie Blondie was that
[34:53] same color too Blondie was not blonde
[34:56] the reason he call it blond because his
[34:58] wife was dark-headed and this was the
[35:00] other 11 his
[35:03] life the two top guns on that rack um
[35:06] brother brandom actually put that those
[35:08] designs in there himself there's you
[35:10] know kits that you buy you do that
[35:12] little work he was very proud of that uh
[35:15] right behind anel's head is the Carib
[35:17] with 42in
[35:18] horn like I say it is a little crowded
[35:20] but you can have time to Mill around and
[35:22] take your own pictures that's the
[35:24] Caribou next to the Caribou is an
[35:26] anvelope then right in the the corner
[35:28] the big gray one that's a ram and the
[35:30] goat is the one the white one next to it
[35:33] goat and the RAM and the
[35:35] car right behind brother Perry is a deer
[35:38] which is in Colorado and then the two
[35:40] fish are from uh
[35:43] Idaho river no turn that's uh the top
[35:47] one is the one he said that the Walt
[35:49] Disney Studios didn't tax work on it and
[35:51] it held world's record for several
[35:53] months weigh 27 pounds and that's not
[35:56] your ordinary rainbow trout rainbow
[35:59] trout never get that big these are
[36:01] steelhead trout CU they go to the ocean
[36:03] in back they get that
[36:05] size above the door are the uh Havalina
[36:09] pigs which is a wild pig we have a
[36:11] family of live out out side of our
[36:14] backyard and uh those represent you know
[36:18] one per year the brother BR 100 and so
[36:23] back years ago there was a sporting good
[36:26] store here in town most of you heard the
[36:28] name Linda rstat her dad had a sporting
[36:30] goods shop here in town hardware store
[36:32] and so forth and during the season he
[36:35] would have a um uh what you call contest
[36:40] contest and whoever brings in the
[36:42] largest pig during the season uh gets a
[36:45] free hunting rifle so typical Hunter
[36:49] brother R drives up there to we in his
[36:51] Pig the last day of the
[36:52] season and as he drives up he sees an
[36:55] Old Gentleman you know a poor fell
[36:57] sitting on the sidewalk out front with
[36:59] his pig that he'd already weighed in and
[37:02] his old gun and so he um he got out and
[37:05] started talking to him man and come to
[37:06] find out that this was the biggest one
[37:08] so far so brother BR knew what he had in
[37:10] the car was bigger he just left his in
[37:12] the car and he thought well if somebody
[37:14] does come up with the big one I'll get
[37:16] mine out and win the rifle anyway but as
[37:18] it turned out he let the old man win the
[37:20] rifle it's kind of
[37:23] man The Peasant that you see next to the
[37:26] door was from our brother G Norman when
[37:30] they had the meetings in waterl Iowa
[37:33] 1957 I
[37:36] believe the next deer is the one you
[37:38] call Big Jim all those four deer on that
[37:41] wall are from
[37:42] Colorado but the big one there is Big
[37:45] Jim and that's the one he said he hunted
[37:47] for many years up there in the mountains
[37:49] of Colorado of course being a hunter you
[37:53] know how would you know the hunter knows
[37:57] that's the same one year after
[37:59] [Music]
[38:00] year the fire uh well the next deer is
[38:04] holding a gun that's brother Brown's 22
[38:05] rifle that's the one is is squirrel gun
[38:09] it's just a simple 22 rifle with a four
[38:12] Power Scope which as you uh remember
[38:15] hearing he U had it sided in for 50
[38:19] yard and over on the on the left wall
[38:22] there kind of in the dark is a red
[38:23] squirrel now it's even kind of hard to
[38:26] see from here but brother random would
[38:28] shoot those little guys at four times
[38:30] the distance of this building in one
[38:32] year he shot 135 squirrel during the
[38:35] season six of them were head shots and
[38:38] 129 were eyeball shots 50
[38:42] yards he preached just like a shot prise
[38:46] you didn't have to wonder what he meant
[38:48] what was that all about exactly what
[38:49] he's doing the white hat on the on the
[38:52] hat rack there brother's old white
[38:54] hunting hat seen many pictures
[38:57] and let's see what else we got back
[38:58] there the picture that's on the the desk
[39:01] is a picture of brother BR when he first
[39:02] came to Arizona when he was going to be
[39:04] Bron Rider you about the chap and had
[39:06] the proper uniform and everything out
[39:07] there guys are you rer
[39:10] don't and so that's when he was was want
[39:13] to be a
[39:14] br um the little table that sister Muse
[39:17] is leaning on you've all read about the
[39:19] executive desk and magazine well that is
[39:22] the executive desk that's where brother
[39:24] Brown studyed for the last 3 years and
[39:27] give witness to how simple this whole
[39:31] thing is there was a man come from
[39:33] Germany few months ago he took a look at
[39:36] that no room for a
[39:41] computer so that kind of tells how he
[39:45] was um in the gun case you'll see many
[39:48] guns and knives collected from around
[39:49] the world um if you care know which
[39:53] one's which Ste can tell you exactly
[39:55] almost down to the serial numbers
[39:58] um in the middle of the room here we
[39:59] have this large
[40:00] table which is a slice of Redwood from
[40:04] California this was donated by Brother
[40:06] Muse's Church before they ever moved
[40:08] over here and as I understand back then
[40:12] in 1966 it cost
[40:15] $600 the
[40:16] eagle was shot in California now that is
[40:19] a golden eagle when a golden eagle is
[40:21] born Pure White and by the time it's
[40:24] four years old it loses all its white
[40:25] feathers so this one's still a young one
[40:28] there's a $5,000 fine for shooting these
[40:30] guys it's a very protected species but
[40:33] somebody in California shot it the state
[40:35] confiscated it had it fixed up and had
[40:37] it in their office or something and a
[40:39] man we all know very well by the name of
[40:41] Ben Bryan who's traveling over
[40:44] there and he purchased it and he donated
[40:48] and there it goes so he he did do a few
[40:50] things
[40:51] right gave us all heart attacks in the
[40:55] meantime when brother ran was here he
[40:57] had a custom of picking up rocks as he
[41:00] went through the desert and through the
[41:02] mountains and everything little rocks he
[41:03] bring them home put them in his tumler
[41:05] and polish him up Real L and you keep
[41:06] him in this little brown Bowl up here
[41:08] that was given to him by ear Jackson in
[41:11] 1951 and when visitors came he would
[41:13] allow them to reach in and get a little
[41:16] souvenir brother Perry will show you one
[41:18] of those at this time you have yours
[41:22] oh this is one of the rocks that brother
[41:25] Brown had in his old box when brother
[41:27] random left he only had a few left so we
[41:30] put those
[41:31] away they're put
[41:34] away but we continue the tradition we
[41:36] have purchased Arizona rocks that been
[41:40] tumble and every one of you can reach in
[41:41] the bowl and take a souvenir home with
[41:44] you souvenir from most to you it's your
[41:46] visit to the
[41:47] de um the stone wall that's right behind
[41:50] us here has a room for a planter in it
[41:53] there's not enough light in here to grow
[41:55] anything so we we can't ever grow plants
[41:57] but that's the wall that you heard about
[41:59] where brother Brown and brother borders
[42:00] had the discussion and everybody was
[42:02] coming in telling brother bers how to do
[42:04] the job all you got to make it square
[42:05] and so brother said hey no problem in
[42:08] heaven things are on the Square here
[42:09] they're on the round so that's why the
[42:10] wall is round and U uh the floor was it
[42:15] comes from a query up in northern
[42:17] Arizona some brothers brought it down
[42:18] and brother brandom and brother
[42:19] bankswood actually did The Cutting and
[42:21] the setting of The Stone in the floor
[42:24] and I like to point it out because any
[42:25] of you that know about stones you
[42:27] usually know when you're walking across
[42:28] a stone floor but this is perfectly
[42:30] smooth it's almost like it was
[42:33] concrete um and last but not least two
[42:37] deer above the window are from Brother
[42:39] ROM's trip when he took the hunting trip
[42:42] and the honeymon together up in New York
[42:45] State uh we got lost on Hurricane M and
[42:49] brother Paul Griffith who's right there
[42:50] with the video camera is a man that
[42:52] lives near Hurricane Mountain and he
[42:54] sent us for nice pictures we to the
[42:56] magazine of the uh of the
[42:59] area have any
[43:02] questions the name Bill on the horn yes
[43:05] the last deer over there above brother
[43:07] Keith one in the
[43:09] corner brother brand was out hunting
[43:11] with another person one day some other
[43:14] brother I believe anyway they they shot
[43:16] two deer each one shot a deer and the
[43:18] deer was so similar the brother BR
[43:20] scratched his name on
[43:23] Thats Right
[43:28] the zebra skin is courtesy of brother
[43:31] Jackson in South Africa which he gave to
[43:33] brother Perry brother Perry is
[43:35] graciously donated it for our use here
[43:37] for a rug and like I said the the
[43:45] drapes that's
[43:47] fine
[43:51] alwaysed push
[43:54] button um brother brand said himself
[43:57] said I'd like to sit in my office chair
[43:58] and look out at my beloved Catalina
[44:00] mountains and push the button and open
[44:03] the drapes I and if we can do
[44:09] this just this year we were able to
[44:11] actually get the electric the wiring was
[44:13] there all the
[44:15] time remote control you know one thing
[44:18] that I'd like to say is that first the
[44:20] den room as Believers this is not a
[44:23] shrine for us that's why we have things
[44:26] in here like like the zebra we don't
[44:29] feel bad about replacing the soapa
[44:31] replacing the draperies you know the
[44:33] Catholics have their shrines that they
[44:34] worship that for us we have no place for
[44:36] candles this is yeah this is a memorial
[44:39] you know to the ministry and we want to
[44:41] keep it nice um I put uh I called
[44:44] brother Perry and asked him about the
[44:46] zebra put it in here because there was
[44:49] so many trophies that Dad got on his
[44:51] last hunting trip to Africa in 1965
[44:53] including the big uh uh yeah no it's not
[44:57] bual P Buffalo um that were lost the
[45:02] Airlines lost them on the way back some
[45:04] of those trophies that that we have
[45:05] pictures of him with him and everything
[45:07] just to kind of remind people of that
[45:09] trip whenever we're telling them uh the
[45:11] story of the den we just thought it' be
[45:13] nice to have something like that in here
[45:16] to remind people of events and job their
[45:19] memory a little bit um another thing
[45:21] that I'd like to tell you about the
[45:23] general design of the V room for many
[45:26] many years dad carried in his wallet a
[45:29] little picture that he had torn out of a
[45:31] Hunting magazine that showed the den
[45:33] room of a famous hunter that have this
[45:35] ledge on it where that the the rugs were
[45:37] up there know this is a lot of years
[45:39] before he had uh the Silver Tip Grizzly
[45:42] but in this picture of the den room
[45:44] there was a ledge up here where the
[45:45] animals weren't walked on and everything
[45:48] and he carried that uh and he said
[45:50] someday I'm going to get a nice din room
[45:52] and I want it built like this so when
[45:54] brother borders designed this din room
[45:55] daddy gave him that picture
[45:57] for him to go by so um this was in his
[46:01] spots for a long time also uh we put
[46:05] Dad's hat down here dad's uh old hunting
[46:07] hat and feel free to try it on if you'd
[46:11] like you know it's hanging there so that
[46:13] you can do that um see how your head
[46:16] size fits with
[46:20] profits I I was going to go in because
[46:22] it's it's so smashed and so uh out of
[46:25] shape I was going to take in and have it
[46:27] blocked and steamed and fixed up real
[46:29] nice but then wouldn't look quite
[46:31] authentic so we just left it the way it
[46:33] was and you're free to try it on anytime
[46:36] you like it you have any questions three
[46:39] monkeys yes the three monkeys you've all
[46:43] I no doubt heard on paper brother R says

[46:47] airport and I saw these three little
[46:49] monkeys he says it's a good thing for
[46:51] everybody to have on their desk we found
[46:53] these are a little bigger than dust size

[51:05] library that we're uh it's evolving into
[51:09] a major seven Church age Library you
[51:11] know you don't start off with everything
[51:14] at one time but we have been able to
[51:16] acquire quite a few uh very old books
[51:20] some uh newer versions of old books um
[51:24] like on this top shelf for example
[51:26] there's a red series of blue and a green
[51:29] brother Bram had one of each of these he
[51:31] had this one the last blue one and the
[51:33] last green one that's what he uh studied
[51:35] from to get the um notes for the seven
[51:39] Church age message you know the
[51:40] revelation of Jesus Christ we went ahead
[51:43] and purchased the rest of the series see
[51:45] it has to do with that study um two
[51:48] people in particular are have been a big
[51:50] help and they're they're continuing to
[51:52] be a big help and that is Brother D mes
[51:53] who has a degree in library Sciences and
[51:56] also brother um uh Morris UNR back in
[52:02] Mississippi uh he's been a big help with
[52:04] books so we're going to ask Brother
[52:05] Floyd if he would uh say a few words he
[52:08] has you know he's going to have the
[52:10] dedication prayer for the the library
[52:12] but before he uh comes I'd like for
[52:16] Brother John to step up in here and tell
[52:18] us a few things that that brother BR
[52:19] told him because he was
[52:21] intimately uh connected with brother
[52:23] brandom in relation to this property and
[52:26] and he actually told him some things
[52:29] that I wanted you to hear he told me
[52:31] also I George I thank all of us that new
[52:35] brother brandom
[52:36] has probably many things for Testimony
[52:39] but the den itself and heing brother Co
[52:42] and speak and pray about it it's 1965 is
[52:47] first time of course we came up here and
[52:49] was personally me my brother Don rutle

[53:00] us here and took us through the den here
[53:03] personally and told us several things
[53:06] happened in fact brother Jee Norman I
[53:08] think drove up and out he was doing some
[53:10] work in and out while we were here that
[53:12] day I think I saw you on film the other
[53:15] day brother brother Norman and uh we
[53:17] stood there right outside where they
[53:19] makes the turn and brother Brown went
[53:22] through the details of why he was doing
[53:24] you know how he always did it
[53:28] I don't know probably two or three times
[53:30] while we were here while he was taking
[53:33] us through brother George he mentioned
[53:35] and you know that this is not my
[53:38] house this is house is a memorial to my
[53:42] Ministry so he made that statement to us
[53:45] probably two or three times and the
[53:47] brothers that were standing there uh at
[53:50] at that time so I'm personally course I
[53:53] know everybody has their own feelings
[53:55] but I'm person personally happy to see
[53:58] the effort that you and sister Rebecca

[59:54] here there's a doorway that goes into
[59:56] our kitchen at the hours when the
[59:58] library is open that door will be closed
[1:00:01] and we've also put a set of doors in the
[1:00:02] hall so actually the library itself will
[1:00:05] be this L-shaped room the front uh
[1:00:09] former bedroom which is now an office
[1:00:12] the bathroom next to it and then there's
[1:00:14] doors in the hall so when people come
[1:00:16] they want to do work on the computer
[1:00:18] which will be available in the front
[1:00:19] office they want to sit and listen to a
[1:00:21] tape uh this unit here in the center of

[1:00:30] videos that we have uh we've tried to
[1:00:33] make it as versatile as possible they
[1:00:35] can do everything except to play the
[1:00:36] piano and they have to have special
[1:00:38] permission to play the Rebecca's
[1:00:41] piano but um we can open those doors in
[1:00:45] the hall and you're welcome to make
[1:00:48] yourself at home we'd like for you to

[1:00:54] lived in this house so we can't really
[1:00:56] say uh this is you know the way brother
[1:00:59] and sister Brandon lived but what we've
[1:01:02] tried to do is to make this reflect what
[1:01:07] brother and sister Brandon mean to us
[1:01:10] not just as my parents but what the
[1:01:13] ministry means to us when people walk
[1:01:15] into this Library I want them to know
[1:01:18] that William Brandon was a very special
[1:01:20] person that we care about William
[1:01:23] Brandon that we care about this Ministry
[1:01:26] it's nothing that we're we're doing it's
[1:01:29] not done in a in a backwards way we've
[1:01:32] wanted this to reflect the caring and
[1:01:34] the love that we feel for William Bram
[1:01:38] and for his
[1:01:40] ministry and I appreciate youall being
[1:01:43] here thank

[1:04:00] has you know it has had its knocks and a
[1:04:04] few years
[1:04:05] ago uh I called I wanted to get an
[1:04:08] appraisal on it for insurance purposes
[1:04:12] so I called mullers where Dad and I went
[1:04:14] and bought the piano and so I told him
[1:04:16] you know my dad bought me a piano there
[1:04:17] in 1965 I want to get an appraisal on it
[1:04:20] can you come out he says oh I won't need
[1:04:21] to just tell me your name so I told him
[1:04:24] William Brana so he disappears off the
[1:04:26] phone and comes back a few minutes later
[1:04:28] he says I'm looking at a photo copy of a
[1:04:30] of a check of Reverend William brandom
[1:04:33] for $900 and here for this piano and I
[1:04:35] said yes sir he said that's a Steinway
[1:04:38] we sold it for
[1:04:39] $900 $1,100 sorry and I said uh yes sir
[1:04:43] that's the one and he said we sold that
[1:04:47] piano for
[1:04:49] $1,100 I said yes sir you did you know
[1:04:52] well at that time the piano was worth
[1:04:54] $12,000
[1:04:56] oh uh whenever we did the remodeling
[1:04:59] project here because my piano was going
[1:05:02] to be a part of the library I wanted to
[1:05:04] really shine in here and look nice we
[1:05:06] took it and had it refinished and then
[1:05:08] we had it appraised again the piano now
[1:05:09] was worth about
[1:05:11] $118,000 so from his $1,100
[1:05:17] purchase would you play only believe one
[1:05:19] time for him you all will sing it
[1:05:26] [Music]
[1:05:45] all things are possible
[1:05:57] [Music]
[1:06:04] all things are
[1:06:09] [Music]
[1:06:18] possible and they're not the biggest you
[1:06:21] know or anything like that but the Lord
[1:06:23] chose that for him and I think a lot of
[1:06:25] times in our own lives we think oh I
[1:06:27] wish I had greater or bigger or better
[1:06:29] or the best or something like that but
[1:06:30] you know we got to pray for what the
[1:06:32] Lord chooses for us we want that
[1:06:34] specific thing and uh brother BR he he
[1:06:39] said so many times you know when I go
[1:06:41] into the Wilderness I go out there and I
[1:06:44] in other words I tank up I take in I
[1:06:48] take in so that I can come back to the
[1:06:50] pull pit and give out and give out and
[1:06:53] he said that you some people think that
[1:06:55] it's it's strange that hear a man of God
[1:06:58] to go out and hunt and kill animals and
[1:07:01] do you know brother BR said that all of
[1:07:05] these animals that the lord gave him his
[1:07:07] gifts was so that he would learn to
[1:07:10] trust help him to trust the Lord the
[1:07:13] Lord would say to him you know okay
[1:07:14] you're going to get a Carib with 42 in
[1:07:16] Horn and for the believe that he would
[1:07:19] go into the woods he' get that caribou
[1:07:21] and it would help him because he was a
[1:07:23] human being too it would help him when
[1:07:25] he got in the P pit and he knew that the
[1:07:29] Lord would keep his word you know it was
[1:07:31] a reminder that the Lord's going to keep
[1:07:33] his word he would come to the pulpit he
[1:07:35] would believe him to be there and he
[1:07:37] would keep his words and so all of these
[1:07:39] things that we're looking at here all
[1:07:41] these animals and everything they were
[1:07:42] lessons really they were little helps
[1:07:45] that the lord gave brother brandom to
[1:07:47] help him when he came to the pull pit
[1:07:50] and ministered to us and this is this is
[1:07:53] the little gift that the lord gave him
[1:07:56] uh does anybody have any
[1:07:57] questions anything you'd like to ask I
[1:08:00] know that you all been studying on this
