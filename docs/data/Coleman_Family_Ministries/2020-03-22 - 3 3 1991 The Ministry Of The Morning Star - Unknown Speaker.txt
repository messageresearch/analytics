praise God so that's charity can come down upon us and spread out amen and go out with a power praise God amen and we know it's all tied up in forgiveness in law that we cannot forgive you neither can you forgive us that's what your prophet told us because faith is based on forgiveness so it's totally impossible to go out of here in a rapture without forgiving because the seven thunders gives faith for wrapped in grace so we thank your Lord now may catch the people up now and open the understanding and bless the Brethren along the walls Lord and up in the balcony and downstairs in the nursery

in revelation 22 so praise the Lord Isaiah 21 verse 11 the burden of Douma he called it to me out of Seir watchman what of the night watchman what of the night we see ask but the night first but the watchman cries back he doesn't answer he explains the morning cometh and also the night if you will inquire inquire ye return and come amen and revelation 2 verse 26 and he did overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will I give power over the nation's he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to shivers even as I received of my father and I will give him the morning star in revelation 22:16 and ah right Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I believe this is first time you hear the word churches from way back and there somewhere I am the root and offspring of David and a bright morning star and the spirit and the bride say come and let him in here and say come and let him that is athirst come whosoever will let him take the water of life freely in other words the watchman said the morning cometh and also tonight if you will inquire inquire return calm because the spirit of bride say come may God add a blessing reading of his words you may be seated by the Norman for title the Ministry of the Morningstar and that completes the Georgian meetings of 1974 the wave she the Holy Spirit spoke to me and says when you come into 1991 you said many of those people they don't want to even know what the message is so you drop back many me telling you that you should drop back first bring out the harvest in January when the with when the fruit is brought forth the harvest has come I believe January 6 the germ seed from the body of Christ all that means something then drop back and pick these people up and let them know that the that the wave sheath which was malachi force message was waived or revealed over the people it was a message full of promises and I preach promises and that's what I'm all about I'm a preacher of promises so now you understand so you can you don't have to squeeze and pick it out you had to we had to go through 25 years of being tested on the promises and I had to preach the promises for 25 years and then in one day about 12 o'clock praise God that LEM come walking down a dusty road see what I'm saying now so y'all should be released not no more figuring out what is it what is it it's love God and you see his love increasing more and more as we look in the Gulf we see all the confused people and then we see the love of God to us for all these years Oh makes you want to run around and do something praise God so the minister the morning star and my subject is the final voice with final mercy to the final age my inspiration is a call to the resurrection amen come you inquired return call spearing the bride say come well hear him Spokane warrants in 1962 malachi for was praying he said wait for the right thing to be done or the right word to be spoken for that great faith that we might dash into the blessings of God now I read this quote years and years ago well what a confidence to find out like cuz Peter said the right word thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and that Elohim is the flesh and blood has not revealed us to you Peter but your father in heaven so may your father in heaven praise God reveals some to you this morning not flesh and blood brother Coleman but your father in heaven or may the right thing be done or the right act of brotherly kindness I'm sorry forgive me may that chop down the blessings of God praise God reason being the time is short and many need to token and and our families have to come in here some of our families and you remember the inspirations our Lord gave me in November 24th before the work the war started when that Saturday afternoon he said behold I come as a thief go in there November 25th and warn them between revelation 16:12 the sixth vial and the seventh vial I'm coming in between and tell them don't be caught naked and it be a shame of the garment that my prophet has we feel to them praise God the only way they could keep it on is through probably kindness and love otherwise you'd be naked you're gonna be spotted and of somehow compassion praise God so what hours upon his chair she told me to chop back and bring these seed messages back in from 74 which was the first phase of it Amy remember that that climax the ministry from 1964 down in Georgia with these three messages and he said don't say anything about just preaching and then I didn't last the last time some have compassion then I figure you know what I'm gonna do next in the ministry the morning star praise God so what hours upon us church we have just come through 42 days of the Desert Storm can we say Amen now I want you to say Amen if I say something don't sit there and wait for me to say the next thing see when you say Amen something I might grab the microphone and anointing

calling him a killer or something over there where his ancestors come from his great-grandfather come from the Black Forest and the mayor wanted to have a welcome performance there and meet all the relatives there and then the town was an uproar against him the man who was doing his job but I couldn't understand what they were saying everything pretty look I couldn't come figure out where they come from a man so anyway was I'm saying yeah we want to cut the demons off and kill them singing and it's in the way general Schwarzkopf did it he made the Iraqis think that they were gonna fight their fight right there in Kuwait and that's what I kept barmen ashore and all like that day I kept it incursions in there you see and they will had all the fortifications there but while they had them busy thinking they're gonna do that they went out to the west and they shot right through it and the Screaming Eagles the paratroopers landed inside and the French and English and it went in

years later Thursday February 28 that the seven angels had visited and lingered for 28 minutes after sunset it was a sunset message oh praise God friends you know what the Bible says walk why there is light but when darkness come no man could work you can't start adding faith and virtue and knowledge in the darkness [Applause] praise God you guys do why the light is here hallelujah so I don't know how much time we have left but the Lord told me to first of all tell you that the wave she's been waved over you for your acceptance in the beloved in the next thing of some have compassion to forgive

angels are up here February 28 1963 at sunset the cloud states sunlit for 28 minutes and then it was blacked out in the night it was nighttime but only for 28 minutes now we had 28 years of evening time life if you're in here you better thank God that you in here huh doing these 28 years he don't have to call you after this time if you don't want to all you young people thank God that she ain't and you included amen you may be seated from January 16th when the Desert Storm switched from Desert Shield to Desert Storm with thunder and lightning and it went 42 days of war with and then the Russians were shot at the American technology and they wasn't fighting a world war 2 or fight a man on Vietnam was a different kind of fight they fight at night we're all kind of modern technology and this is the technology that they would have used in Europe against Russia and Russia would have been terribly shocked that one of their great a general Zhukov he saw that Americans were way ahead years ago and he told them that and they fired him for saying that but then it was proven to him that the Americans were for him well you know America's gotta have a little revival oh wait man think I had a little revival of an image likened to the Beast and an American president has got to speak like the dragon before him now sit put it in the message and Norway you had a man so that now you understand and God will make the war come to pass just the way he wants it you'll make it a hundred hours amen praise God 96 hours or four days and four hours of the ground war it make the entire war forty-two days of war and in all the persecution near trustees on the citizens that went on in Kuwait that's a sign of what's fixing to happen they were dismembered and cut in half their heads and everything else all kind of trustees and general Schwartzkopf says he prayed he said that these people are not in the human race for the general say so church wake up what does the 42 days mean why was the great Republican Guard army so great so mighty they were cut off at the river Euphrates is that right him the men at the river Euphrates so that you know revelation praise God is right in front of you wake you up God amen may be seated they were cut off at the river Euphrates and the general said that case was shut to them another retired Marine general said well I don't know there's a six-lane highway you know but the general said the gates was shut so they knew what they were talking about because they bombed every River on the Tigris River every Bridge rather and every bridge on the Euphrates River for them to cross they were cut off then they the paratroopers and the French him the men on the west and they couldn't get out and now you reading the papers in here on radio what's going on see it's just a natural sign of a spiritual and natural thing fixin to happen I'm Church against the church against the Jews we better wake up I'm here praise God why 42 days is a discerning the Gulf War does it mean 42 months huh or three and a half years under the great persecution of the beasts in the image call the Tribulation Period for 42 months for the ministry of Moses Elijah 42 months why 42 wake up hallelujah we we think I know what time to fool around here may be seated was the war permitted by God to be a sign to the bride to get ready get out get sealed up for the resurrection in the rapture did the sixth angel of Revelation 16:12 pour out his vial upon the great river Euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared amen and he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon and where they act the whole world now is focusing on Israel and the Arabs exactly what you said in a Bible prays exactly and people try to figure happiness come about the Prophet said it I believe it it'll come about and didn't the Holy Spirit warn you in November 25th about this very thing here and then the war broke out in January so you'd know already so when he asked me to write the article I didn't have to write it the Holy Spirit already told me November praise God amen I didn't have any mind battle what should I write I didn't have to us preaching it amen hallelujah God warns you a man may be seated it's God actually using this war in the Gulf and I told you that it would not be Armageddon I told you that a man to bring to pass his word that the whole world would be focusing on the Middle East to make peace for the Arabs and Jews and bring the past Ezekiel 38 and 39 where Gog and Magog and Russia and all them come down there because then because in in Israel is all this a uranium in the Dead Sea is worth trillions of dollars beside the oil down there so God put it there an old Ishmael is wild as ever he still wild him and he never been team yet brother brands the issue here was a wild man and I'm not speaking as any Arabs in here but I'll just tell you what the Prophet says I don't know if that there might be one in here I don't know Amen we have everybody else in here - Amen so I won't even with the process of Ishmael your wild Amen praise God and they want to destroy the Jews of course Desert Storm funding light in 42 days of hell on earth just bonding like that first can you imagine people oh my out of their minds they was happy to give up barliman every night over and over and over like that it'll borrow me out of your mind and once you forget now that seventh vision America she's destroyed seemed like she never even makes on again the whole of America all the small towns out west where everything is nice finished craters and debris and everything none shall escape the Bible says they shall tell the mountains to fall upon them to hide her from the wrath of God hallelujah may be seated a great storm of thunder and lightning is here for the world and for the church how can the bride turn this storm away from her so she can be sealed and get out of here that's the question in the message regardless of what you believe of the message what interpretation amen can you turn the storm caused the death of storm is here remember the bride was promised seven thunders to others voices there were seven thunders going to feel nice going around you now praise God only thing I can cover you praise huh amen and where did the gods profit put it at the promise on the fourth seal page 304 he said wait we didn't know it had to be 25 years but he did say wait hey man tell them seven thunders uttered his voices to that group who can really take the Word of God and hand it there the group that know that they accepted in a beloved the group that know how to forgive and drop the arts then they can hand the word that's the group otherwise you cannot utter anything to you at all and hand it there it'll slice and cut they can close the heavens they can shut this or that do whatever they want to Malik have four promises blessing to the bride but he also promised judgment to the world and church and though it might linger he spoke it was a warning from the Prophet though it might linger but it's coming to pass and when that happens they will know that a prophet was among them praise God they will know hooks and when California goes lost handle slides in they will know that a prophet was among them praise God amen SoDo a ling it 25 years so far it will be here it's already here how close are we friends on the sixth seal page four or five I can almost see that angel standing there in saying watch at the last of that seven angels message now what is the last part of it the first part was a shout in the middle part is a voice and then the trump is the last part of his message amen and that angel stands there and says time shall be no more that little loyal bride will fly away into the arms of Jesus one of these days he prophesized when he takes her to the father's house what a promise right for right in a sixth seal he jumped his crowns on a sixth seal and he dropped their the seventh on the fourth seal the very two seals that is the loose destruction and persecution he put two promises there for the brand that's why I tell you here the seals they hit it table you know what I'm talking about so they won't take my word for it take the prophets word for it Oh hallelujah praise God hey man Malachi 4 says here let's think of these things as we go along now that's what he said let's think about it and I say the same thing this morning at Malachi 4 said let's think about these things as we go along here now just let you know that the prize will have some authority praise God a lot of people don't believe that hey man but I can't help that any man I got to see what the Prophet said a man say what that prophet said Amen praise the Lord so on you're seven Church ages and page 339 and 340 so long oh yes that is soul revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets there it is he is sending a vindicated prophet he is sending a prophet after almost 2,000 years he's sending someone who is so far from organization education in the world religion that is John the Baptist enlarge of all he will hear only from God and he will have thus saith the Lord and speak for God he would be God's mouthpiece as he as it is declared in Malachi 4 6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the father's he will bring back the elect of the last day I've indicated profit give the exact shoe that there was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day watch we'll be the ones who truly manifests the Lord and be his body and be his boys we're gonna be his boys a lot of the people in the Mets don't believe that but that's what I've been preaching for 25 years we're going to be his voice amen not only that be his voice amen and perform his works hallelujah he says do you see it I say Amen brother BAM I do see it I'll pray for those who don't see it God raise up others and so it has gone on through the years until in his last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger watch will be the final voice to the final age what's my subject the final voice with final mercy to the final leaves the bride will have that mercy that mercy is the blood of God which is the Word of God with nothing attitude and nothing taken away how powerful it is today it can turn that desert storm praise God has spoken precept by precept line upon line here a little and there a little how we thank God for not welching out praise God compromising now we are powerful praise God the way that God now is quicker sharper more power for any two-edged sword hallelujah the pride you understand what I'm saying today the prophets going to heaven amen but the pride if she has that boy that word in her then she has authority to give out mercy oh praise come you may be seated God raised up others and so has it going on through the years until in his last day there was thinking of other people delaying who under their messenger it will be the final points to the final age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is his own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confer on her through the Prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her was his voice his word and yes it is for it says in the last chapter revelation 20 verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost direct like Peter spoke to Ananias and Sapphira you have not lied this is the Holy Ghost you live to direct o church wake up hallelujah maybe Sita will hear direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that that word Brides will be repudiated as in the first age Amen and then the next page 341 Oh God still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride that voice is in the bride as we have said and we will talk more about that later now let's get this last warning in here praise God the last warning of the spirit page 360 for religion 322 neither hath an ear let him hear other words inquire come Amen what the Spirit says to the churches this is the last warning there will not be another the throne room

in another age the ages are over but thank God at this moment this age is not over he is yet crying and his cry is not only in the spiritual ears of men by spirit but once again the prophets in the land once more God will reveal the truth as it did to Paul in the day is the seventh messenger as in the days of Laodicean age in the days of the Laodicean age its messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed of Paul he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the the benefits of the beneficent effect of that prophets ministry and they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of the last Dane who are mentioned in revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come see come by now this Morningstar minister gonna mount up on the bride the Holy Spirit the bride is the word and the spirit gonna come over her then the voice will be in the prior to say come whosoever will come be the final voice with the final mercy to the final age right why the desert storm is roaring across the world and they begin to talk about peace peace and when they shall say peace come in sudden destruction amen hallelujah may be seated amen amen who I mentioned really 22:17 the spirit of Bryant's they come the corner week the bride wheat that fell on the ground in Nicaea has come back to original word grain again praise God forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this Lance age what he says from God the bride will say now Eunice then what I was preaching last 17 years but fun doesn't think he said that well then the bride says it praise God you understand it sometimes give faith all out there I always have what he said [Applause] I mean I couldn't figure out why wasn't arrested I'm saying the same thing because he said here what he said they will say solid combat no I'm saying it amen praise God amen what he said from God the bride will say you have to understand it but is sayeth and then one day wait till them seven thunders on his voices then it be like Peter now what's a Christ the Son of the Living God Elohim has revealed as to you all praise God don't get discouraged be encouraged maybe see them and what they will say watch will have already been set in the word now here's my thought they are saying it now come out from among her now and be separate that's been my message since the Prophet left that's what nobody understands me amen the cry has gone out what Malachi for the cry is going out bride how long will the voice cry we do not know but one thing we do know it won't be long for this is the last age oh who do you say this is praise God so the bride can see now by promise the final voice is final merchants of the final age and the private will be God's mouthpiece and the spirit and the bride say come and once more the world here direct from Donna that Pentecost the voids in the bride calling out to the resurrection all praise God in a with a short and powerful demonstration of the Spirit amen so we could I just give you the last warning of the spirit to the age what he says from God the bride will say despairing a prophet in the bride would be saying the same thing and what they say will have already been said in the word they are saying it now come out from among them and be separate the cry has gone out Malachi 4 the cry is going out 1991 the bride prays gosh you still him and she becomes the final voices final immersion of the final age how long will the voice cried we do not know but one thing we do know it won't be long for this is the Lance age old church how can the bride turn this Desert Storm away from her that's still the question that is the question amen I believe on of a scene on your dollar bill on a pyramid it is Novus Ordo seclorum it's a closed room and somebody was in the New York Times somebody gave it to me then a precious brother he knew about it and so he won't know more about that so last night he called a Catholic Church and asked the priest what the Latin words Novus Ordo seclorum means I said that's really something yes siree call the priests in the Catholic Church you want to know and then the Catholic priest answered me if I if I if I got these words off of a dollar bill and what and was my and why my curiosity and why I wanted to know then he said that's Bush's new world order the Catholic priest said then he asked me if I knew what the other words meant on top of the pyramid and knew it the cult is something or other he said that means what I have started I will finish so hallelujah praise God my my thank you brother for having the boldness to call that Catholic priests amen praise Allah yes sir so now the oncoming storm amen so hit a profit in 1960 appreciate coming storm line 15 number two and there I thought I'd read it back to you to come back on it today here on page five with where my in here page fire Amen you got at the wrong or page here amen amen I'll find it maybe you open your Bible up to st. mark seven yes sir well you're here this yeah beautifier st. Matthew chapter 7 verse 24 this is the two foundations therefore whosoever here at these sayings of mine and doeth them I would liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened to a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and arranged descending to the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and fell and great was the fall of it o church we are you standing on a rock praise God or on the sand hallelujah praise God wall-e amen everybody ready okay I just want you to read that one page six here paragraph 41 brother Brad explains it Jesus was speaking here of a coming storm which has got to strike every man every woman that's born in the world there is just no way out of it that storm will strike you sometime or other high on the world could wait years later when the Bible was written Jesus spoke these words here how in the world could they pick up Desert Storm I don't know having the Holy Spirit in know how to do these things huh and here he talked about the storm and the prophets prophesy no and why you preach the word the oncoming storm when Jesus speaking of a coming storm which has got to strike every man every woman that's born in the world there's just no way out of it that storm will strike you sometime another and it depends on what kind of a foundation that you have whether your house will weather that or not there has been many lives saved because of preparation to for storms it has been many lives many of lives lost because of failing to take heed to the warning of storms that's coming and he speaks about he wasn't but he was told a story I had that happen in Florida and there had been many great storms that sweep through Florida typhoons and came in off to sea and bring water four city blocks up to the city and by the way they were in California's goes down he says Tampa no place will go under so brother is not gonna hit both sides amen and then he said it'll throw a tidal waves back 40 miles back to the Salton Sea so it's really nothing to play with friends and I believe Billy Graham said that that Santa Angie's fault goes down through Mexico and then it goes under the Gulf in a cross landing ocean and it cuts right across North Africa and it goes right over into Egypt and then hips and straight into Mount Olivet my my my right to Mount Olivet Amen which is near the mosque of Ouma so years ago Liz asked all rabbi on what do you think about the mosque of Omar he says the twelve his beard he said well there could be an earthquake ain't be no more that mosque of Omar each Musa a mosque will be gone well praise God God knows how to do it amen so in sweeps out in such storms in some way the elements they can contact the changing of the weather they got the instruments in the atmosphere which was a way to weathers gather which away this weathers gathered that would bring forth one of those stones because they made it a life study and by certain instruments and things that science has provided them then by calling ahead and hearing which way the storm is coming how much wind has got behind him which way other storms are coming then winds whether it's able to combat to shove away the storm and then he said I could stop and preach for now on that that it takes now here's my thought here and it takes a greater storm that's coming it takes a higher wind to turn that stone now the winds s drive in it amen it takes the higher wind to stop it and you know that there's four angels standing in Revelation 7 hold it back the winds of destruction until the 144,000 sealed then what about the bride [Applause] see I could sealed up also because they could steal open three and a half years but we got good seal here just before Oh Holloway they're not playing time left brother aiming a higher win that's my toy to turn s time and so it is today and we all know that we got on coming strong and only win that I know they can turn that strong will be the Russian win that fell on a day of Pentecost Oh hallelujah praise God glory to God amen brother I can hardly keep still oh I hear the sound upon the rain glory come see how that prophet tied that greater win into the storm and I'm coming back and turn it greater went into the desert storm because the question is how can the bride keep that storm back until she's sealed all the way from faith to charity Oh hallelujah praise God keep all the plagues away and everything else shall not come nigh thee maybe seated Russia Winterfell in their opinion cuz I'm told that there is men even in the city now speaking against communism and they should be but just speaking against it isn't enough we gotta find how to turn the thing and then there's only one thing that can turn that stone and that's a more powerful storm that can be set it and change its course amen you believe that praise God well cific got enough time I have it that look I want to read this here okay I was reading I forgot page seven just now I believe in the taper in the newspaper of a storm a few years ago I was on a way across Florida Central Florida and all the regions around okie Okeechobee was warned I just felt left there about five I just left it by five weeks ago and there was a neighbor man who kept in contact with radio all the time because of these storms and he was a very renowned Christian and he heard that the great typhoon was coming that way twisting down trees and everything was warned to get to safety and he thought of his neighbor he had brotherly kindness love his neighbor and if you love me you talk couldn't you tell your neighbor of something our profession a man who had a chicken farm and some light buildings with their chickens in them they're brutal houses and so forth with depends where all that they had in there and then life was tired up with these chickens of their living and he rushed quickly frantically up to the gate and stopped his car and jumped out and said to the fellow take all the chickens that put him in your storm shelter and you rush over to mine because there's coming a typhoon a storm that's gonna twist everything down like today a man is a desert storm coming with funding lightning hallelujah stop your nonsense brains got get in the house of God be sanctified praise God come out of the world hallelujah praise God tell your neighbor revolt when others allow a man may be seated and the man stood and looked him in the face and laughed at him and said nonsense I've heard them predict such things before and never did happen and the Christian neighbor was so excited he said but what if it does happen we hear it most like that along line I've heard of this it's going to happen and that's going to happen but it's going to happen one of these days and it behooves us to listen to every warning but this man said I have no time for such foolishness I raised chickens I have no time for such I guess raising chickens and then when raised and eagles amen praise God amen and he cried out the neighbor said that is the neighbor amen in the name of God he said leave those chickens alone then John and come quickly you and your family if you don't want to believe it let your family come let your family come to the truth if you don't believe heyno have mercy on them huh God first in your family second didn't you Lance that's the order hallelujah and you said I will not have my children to be excited over a few radio warnings my children I have decided will live as I live ain't got no man in the home say and my wife will listen to me because I am the breadwinner of this home he nailed it down and she must listen to me I'm the boss here and I will not have my children all excited or TWRP about some nonsense my really some huh sound like I heard this in the message like you know woman our prayers God amen legalism everything else and woman the woman may have the Holy Ghost I mean if she's following the leading of the Lord a man was trying to be humble everything all yeah what a now praise God and the neighbor was turned and he went to his home into his shelter and all of a sudden the crowds was upon him before they knew it any day behold I come as a thief glory before they knew it and the way that's the way judgement strikes it comes so sudden you wonder how can it get there so quick how I have seen cruel man who once cursed God fall and scream and say how could you cheat me this way the whole every foundation was swept out from under him in a moment it pays to take a warning oh you might laugh at the messenger you might be able to even kill him but you cannot kill the message because it's in the Prak the final voice final mercy final age hey man and they can't stop it it has going out and it is going out shop hey man he may be seated Laurita car you cannot kill the message it'll go on just the same God's message is eternal his words will never fail Oh hallelujah sound like brother bear preaches yesterday amen I see heavens open and he tomorrow Paul was successful having Stephen stone and Stephen stood there and said you see heavens opening Jesus standing at the right hand of God something got ahold of him it wasn't a messenger but it was a message he hand hey man while the storm swept through the country it caught the chicken house and the farmer they never found his body and his wife frantically fighting and they lived close to the great Okeechobee lake and the waters began to rise as the typhoon lifted the waters all the way up from the bottom of the lake and that that's what makes them go so dangerous now his wife could have been with the Christian in his shelter but her husband knew more he said no I'm the boss here so she had the SUP in the whole family and it was beginning to rise as a typhoon lifted the walls all the way up from the bottom of Lake that's what makes him so dangerous this shallow the boats wrapped and that's how the waves come up and turn the boats beneath them the storms come and just a world's up the water impacts it for miles and the water was sweeping until the mother no there was no hope but to get her children on top of the building and she got her children and got him on top of the building holding onto the chimney of the house hey man and she could have been into.the in a shelter and then the wildlife the cottonmouth moccasin snakes I believe a more deadly snake in your Diamondback rattler they were crawling for safety and they come on the roof with her and by listening to a husband not taking heed to the warning she she had to she had to fight the snakes she stomped and she beat but she had to stand and watch those vicious snakes bite her children until they died on the roof my god and the mother herself was bitten so much until finally she died and that's the only way we got the story after the storm had quieted and the search party's hunting for bodies and so forth they found her laying on top of the roof with the children laying by her side oh it pays to take warning the first thing to do before they can be a warning there has to be a preparation made for safety and there is no need of sending a warning and the warning is only a voice or one having you to prepare for the danger just of all there has to be a preparation made first and then if the preparation is made then the warning can go forward to cause you to make your decision whether you want to listen to it or not if you don't want to listen to it well that's up to you if you do listen to it there is safety Oh hallelujah God has the same method we work on God's method and that way God in the early days when the ant alluvion world when people had gotten so wicked and so sinful that God could not look upon it and be just amen so friends if in many lives say because of preparation for storms amen if the many lives lost because of failing to take heed to the warning of the storms that's coming and so it is today and we all know that we got our oncoming storm amen can you say Amen and that the only thing I can turn that storm will be the Russian wind that fell on the day of Pentecost all thank God for that promise and there's only one thing I can turn that storm that desert storm of 42 days and that's a more powerful storm that that can be set it and change its course here's a brother Coleman how could that be what we hid we know what happened once you remember huh well what what happened little fishy I'll give you your life huh what happens say it be a squirrel and it be a squirrel what happened oh praise God sister handy right that's nothing but the truth I give you your two sons what happened church well then a higher wind a little stronger voice like a turn that strong Oh hallelujah praise God don't be nervous this is an area you were pouring for be barely put stand there praise God put your shoulders back and your head up amen glory to God well now let's attack the storm out there in Colorado there was a storm that probably was hunting that right and the warning come get out of the hills get off the mountain and everybody rushed out of there praise God and including the Prophet and down the hill he come but a voice that could turn this tongue spoke to him and say go back up the mountain oh praise but that same forest praise God is here today Oh glory don't cut say go back up everybody was running for their life because the storm was there and a prophet walked into the storm well I mean the same God in him was in Jesus when he spoke to the storm and said peace be still praise God hallelujah my god don't be afraid hallelujah and a prophet of God told that storm to cease a man and all of a sudden stop the clouds we're all the way he said let the Sun come out and shine for days that same God is here don't be weary Oh hallelujah praise God before the darkest hand touches my wife tomber it'll be gone praise God that's what I'm talking about like it was on the day of Pentecost you may be seated praise God a me believe us now this hallelujah so now we know that the storm can be spoke to so the prophet already demonstrated already amen Malachi 4 spoke the word wind ceased Tonka Mountain shine for days just like Jesus didn't in the book and the prophet went on down into a gas station and he asked a man what happened to storm there yeah he said I rushed out of here all of a sudden but then all of a sudden he said it stopped we don't know why and a prophet just smile now he said Oh to the stall suited me now he just said oh yeah he went on it's very humble see God can't give you know polish she has some character you find it open I think is Satan to my I will ascend up then I'll do this eh I'll do that amen praise God by the grace of God will do it with the help of the Lord and even have peace be still how we thank God for these promises for the spiritual and natural realm in the Florida storm warning the family oh my god it it gone they didn't take heed the storm warning the desert storm is real amen so now in defending was destroyed before they can be a warning there has to be a preparation made for safety or there's no need to send a warning there's no sense in you saying it's gonna rain unless you have a place for people come in - there's no sense you're saying coming to this message unless you have some dynamics to take them direction [Music] so therefore it's then a man is that it's built into the message there's a promise in there so therefore before there can be a warning it has to be a preparation made for safety or there's no need to send a warning then if the preparation is made then the warning can go forward for for you to it's up to you to make your decision if you don't want to listen to the warning then it's up to you if you do want to listen then their safety how we thank God for his preparation through Malachi ofourse message I want to hurry up and but I because I because I read you the deep preparation here amen he said here on page 16 he said there there is the hour coming and now is and the ceiling is about over that's where every man and woman on the face of the earth is going to be in that place of refuge like it wasn't days of Noah or on the outside of it you have to make your decision that safety is Jesus Christ that he is the only place the only one who has eternal life no man can come to the Father but by him he is the Ark of our safety the Holy Spirit bears record with us now that we passed from death unto life then he says on page 17 we see the newspapers and we do and then all incoming storm and we do now

here together praise God I hear by the Bible God's on coming judgments we have sickness in trouble and disaster will strike the nation's and every nation will break to pieces I read in the Bible that's the Prophet 1960 prophesied during his second pool before he struck that third pole him and but did you notice there he said before you go to bed tonight read revelations 8 and you read it and you see it and they open the Seventh Seal There was silence then he immediately goes into the trumpets there correct and it goes all the way through a revelation 8 into the ninth right on through there and then at the end of the trumpets then it drops in Revelation 10 a prophet see it the way the Bible was written the Amen see but right there but they loved what he did he took the seven thunders that was stuck to the back of the Bible and knowing that he said read revelation eight well then in the eighth in the first verse Malachi 4 stuck the thunders in Revelation 8 1 so when he opened it there were seven thunders banging one two people five six seven but right close together before them trumpet sound out wisdom of God you taught my getting out here without this message hollow the whole the Holy Spirit to the Prophet place them thunders on the backside writing in Revelation 8 1 just before Moses Elijah come with the trumpet with the trumpets oh that's not the shout because you notice right in revelation 8 1 then in Revelation 8 2 through 13 and revelation 9:1 through 21 is all my puppets does anything about thunders the fun is a revelation from Malachi 4 nobody knew where to place it he placed it there amen in 25 years a believe it in and now oh man I'm finished preaching praise God my god but Malachi 4 revealed on the next haven't seen a red light ain't one and there was seven thunders banging right close together what is it a ceiling of preparation Geoff's before the trumpets are loosed [Applause] my a ceiling of preparation sure first seal page 155 the seven thunders of Revelation may they show the bride how to prepare a preparation message for his god a man to prepare for great translation faith so now we can warn because we have a message from the Prophet so we can be the final voice and we can sense you saying you to final for the final emergency where they going hey what are you taking them to do an interpretation of something away yo ho - a revelation 7 other news voices oh praise God amen sentence gives the preparation then out goes the warning in this final I age amen the final boyhood final mercy to the final age with a call to the resurrection old church there is a preparation to escape the desert storm 42 months or 42 or months or 42 days or three and a half years how we thank God for the messenger with the token oh praise God do you have the token the message the gospel age for this hour page 26 token Amen jeffersonville praise got to see what the Prophet says here amen now notice he said God's preparation for that time now as we know that the Bible said all those things happen for examples for us notice when God got ready to judge Egypt first he made a preparation what did he do the first time he never changes his order he always makes a preparation what did it do he in the first time he made his preparation you sent a prophet with a message that's the first thing first thing it did to his people was a sign of problem with a message number two the next thing he did was to identify the Prophet you sent a pillar of fire for identification to identify it and we're waiting for a higher wind the pillar fire to identify the bride with a final warning with final mercy to the final age a man and the third thing he sent was a token that's exactly right the token what does the token mean assurance Oh mind I have to talk it in this hour of all the plagues in war and Internet it had the token assurance amen first it's probably with the message he identified himself among the pillar of fire with his prophet then he sent a token to get under the blood then he accepted this substitute death in your place then the blood was a token that he looked at you you heard the message you believed on the pillar of fire and accepted the substitutionary that he had provided for you and you were under the blood of the very chemistry of the life that went out for you my what a perfect thing that is you under the blood now you're under the Spirit under the Holy Spirit and the spirit and the bride say come that way the wind to turn the stone hallelujah you believe the message of the day you believe the power the pillar of fire you believe that and you do now now look just to believe it's not enough not to walk around with an isn't enough that is to make yourself worse if we either know what to do good and do it not for to him and sin so just don't do that there see hey man so brother what a pretty thing it is for today but you must apply and display that now see just to believe it's not enough you must display it or reflect Christ back to the people now I'm moving other staff payment now we into reflection amen amen page 13 page 12 here ma glory to God now the very spirit itself is the token the Holy Spirit itself is the token not the blood page 12 the Holy Spirit itself you follow what I'm saying huh then the Holy Spirit is not mom not the baptism just the baptism but the baptism of the Holy that made a way for the Holy Spirit itself to come right down and perfection it back to the word amen you got it okay but the token is the Holy Ghost upon the church that they see Christ and that's revelation 22:17 the spirit upon the bride says come and they say the spirit not only will it be in the inward parts but truth from the inward parts will be manifested or display from the you just can't say I'm in a message that's truth but it's got to come out and be seen then you know you have assurance you're under the token they can see the very spirit that was upon the Prophet is now upon you and the voice of God is in you oh praise God amen yes yes I feel like traveling hallelujah I got my foot up here now I can't get it down amen yes siree Mike feel like traveling on yes sir okay I

Christ is the same you mean crisis gonna give us his ministry I give you the Morningstar oh praise God and what Jesus began to do to continue to do his death didn't stop him and when brother Bram died that didn't stop the holy spirit it's right here it's going out is going out the boys also he returned again not a third person but the same person returned back again in the form of the Holy Ghost and it continues to work on it continues on said the book of Acts Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that is the token that is the sign Peter John passed through the gate called beautiful they laid a man had been crippled laying from his mother's womb he said silver gold have I none but such as a HAP I give you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk they talked to them and they knew and knew that they were ignorant and unlearning it man but they taking notice to them that they had been with Jesus see the token was there displayed it's on page 13 such as I have seen a poor fallen brother laying there crippled disfigured everything and the same life that was in Christ was in them such as I have in my name shall cast out devils not I will you will if you say to the mountain not I say but you say to the mount the old brother the hour that the token is to be displayed is at hand we can see it so all the message that's wonderful we in the message but what the hour has come for the message to be displayed which is a token so we've been a planet in a long time but now we have to display it yes sir amen you can see it we know that we near the end now for all kinds of messages of show signs and ones now we come back for what the church has got to do that token has got to be displayed when I see the blood I'll pass over you nothing else will work it must be the blood when I see the spirit I'll pass over you Oh hallelujah church amen Nelson now did you get it the ministry of the bride the minister Christ is the same and there's my thought the minister of the morning star of Antikythera and it's very our darkness to reflect the oncoming Sun with a display of the token which would be a reflection of Christ on earth again and the desert storm is here and is here now and it is Brad time to reflect Christ we are to be a reflection of Christ in this dark hour amen Isaiah 60 said rise and Charon for that light is come and the glory of God shall be risen upon you for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee the spirit and the bride

hour you raise up pour hallelujah glory to God to the overcomer and I will give him the morning star hope you may be seated I will try to try this thing home now let's pick up Isaiah 21 glory now the Prophet here had a burden what is a burden a heavy weighty thing is a message on Oracle concerning Babylon and Assyria and Jerusalem back in Isaiah here it is heavy because a wrath of God is in it and it is grievious for the Prophet to declare amen and so was it for Malachi for the cities thing but what about the weight that's why your own choosing a price and you ran this way you ran that way try to not say it but God was in him speaking it out and then you understand why the man of God got to say things and people get mad at you but you can't help but you've gotta say they don't want to spin what's motivating you praise go why are you saying it you're saying it for purpose you're warning the people praise God hallelujah final revelation you know is right a fish through is right they can't

gross darkness upon the people and the world knows dangerous here but they don't know what to do President Bush don't know anything about this here : power and general Schwarzkopf he knew how to detail that thing out there but they don't only buy this they don't know how to get out of here what we do but they don't so the world knows nothing they don't know what to do in this night time of

devil Briggs got a sixth sense inside can't pick up that thing you know a man evil and demons are loosed from the pit or everywhere and Armageddon is right at the door all praise God and right in this hour God sent Malachi forth with a seven Thunder message to wake up the bride amen and give her a revelation of the will of God for this hour so before darkness could overtake the brand God set off for a silent alarm amen to wake up the sixth sense of faith to warn her by a sudden alarm system and prepare her and get her ready for this great hour through the Scheldt message three kind of believers page 15 or when that brand is called out and set in the book of life when the last member is set in the book of redemption amen - 25 years so far when that happens they'll come a sound from heaven that'll take such a baptism of the holy ghost internet bride that'll take her from the earth into a raft and grace God promised it I don't care how old-fashioned it sounds but he promised it yes sir Laurie oh I feel so wonderful today I feel like is going in I feel like the people are catching it next Sunday morning catch it catch it catch it hey man you may be seated now these promises down through the seven churches remembers always to he that overcometh any man Christ home comes only to other version of his word to reproduce himself again this reproduction or reflection brings him back on earth again after Malachi 4 left the scene December 1965 it produces the Ministry of the Morningstar in the pride and and through our mechanics we are espoused to him you understand espoused that's what the message that followed me means your spouse Oh II was espoused Amen see but she broke the word before Adam got to her now before Christ's Amen can get to the pride at the 25 years with what kind of conditions our brand in who stay with the word who has interpretation all these kind of things in dead why they living right in the church right in the message it's the only espouse but many went on but we thank God for Revelation we stayed right there is spouse so the dynamics is the mate and that's the spirit of his spirit born of this bone flesh of his flesh then comes the resurrection o to the whole will come on will I give the morning star in the morning star as the minister Jesus Christ given back to the church just before the resurrection the mating with the dynamics to reflect Christ on the earth in the bride praise God you've been a spouse to Christ and God will bring the holy jesus right through your womb to reproduce Jesus Christ on earth again a reflection on the earth the mating with the dynamics to reflect Christ on the earth in the pride to raise the dead and go in a resurrection or rapture the Morningstar is the Ministry of the Holy Spirit Holy Spirit to praise God amen Oh hallelujah what shall I say now amen shall continue okay they did it see I'm trying to close out but they told me to go on amen okay uh then what okay now page 22 harvest time all right brother branham we find a perkiness church age that jesus said here he that overcometh i would give him the morning star give him the morning star he said now how could he get them on a star when Jesus said himself that he is the morning star now how can we be I get the morning star see all of those seeds of Abraham are reflected by stars they're different one from another and we're different for one for another and Jesus is that morning star the brightest of all of them but we find him in Revelation one with seven stars in his hand he interprets that and says these seven stars are the seven angels to the seven churches are the seven churches that's coming then he said how could it be then if they got the morning star I said the stars that were in there in his hand were only the reflection stars from the morning star see for the messenger of that day had the word and he is the word he just had the portion for that day and the people that's ready now wants to come away from the world systems and world things and walk with Him sees the reflection of the morning star through the messenger of that age as he did through Noah and on Moses and so forth as he reflected the old testament finally they all arrived to one and soul world it it is at the end of the church age it arrived back to Jesus that he is the word or a we as Christians are only reflecting him the moon only reflects the Sun in his absence and the believer only reflects the Son of God and the absence of the Son of God it's the light of the Bible the scriptures being vindicated in our lives the word that makes them light in darkness you are candles as set up on a hill that ain't the Sun is a candle the candle just takes the place of the Sun just shows a certain amount of light we are God's children we are sons and daughters of God only the spirit with Portia only by the spirit portion he had it without portion we are a star there shining all of us together make a light to the world but he is the entire Sun that reflects the light to every star hallelujah I believe him god help my unbelief you said oh praise God he did all will come out give him the morning star now how could he get the morning star but jesus said himself as the morning star well I just answered the question amen you get it now okay on page 30 here praise God amen page 30 the answer here to the overcomer 206 that was represent that light in his hand in the new church eh reflecting his life the manner and only the man that perfectly overcome the man that really sets down and throws aside everything else beside the word and the word does that manner all my as Jesus mentioned I live by word that we see other man shall live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God that's the hidden manna for the overcomer or that was laid up for each priesthood following it amen the hidden manna is for overcoming no page 39a men his is his word of promise I remember we had a word promise dynamics to your mechanics is that right give me say Amen dynamics his promise to us we didn't know when but we know what the promise because he said Saul rising of the Sun there correct okay
