[57:01] about the life of William Ram Marion
[57:05] Branham and just just a few it's about
[57:09] 40 minutes to presentation and you know
[57:12] if you were to perhaps put it all into
[57:14] words or into a presentation I guess we
[57:17] would be here I guarantee you about two
[57:19] or three months to all the testimonies
[57:21] and different things that happen and
[57:22] transpired in the ministry of our
[57:25] prophet William Mary Branham and I have
[57:29] not personally met brother Branham but
[57:32] I'm so glad that the Lord gave me the
[57:35] opportunity to meet it's family and I
[57:38] appreciate them for my heart
[57:41] I'd be raised it's wonderful name just a
[57:46] wonderful things you know just it's
[57:48] talking to them you know last night in a
[57:50] few the times that we were you would get
[57:52] together and dump cheering the different
[57:54] testimonies of how you know brother
[57:57] branham was and the more I hear that's
[57:59] the more I want to know amen and just so
[58:02] many things just it's mind-blowing so I
[58:05] do appreciate them a we all appreciate
[58:07] their presence here this afternoon and
[58:09] just a slide presentation was presented
[58:12] also in pin Harris of this year and a
[58:16] lot of brothers asked for the video tape
[58:19] of the presentation and I felt for the
[58:21] cone when I talked and we felt not to
[58:24] send it out until the Brandon's see
[58:27] personally themselves so therefore we
[58:30] kind of saved it here to the end after
[58:33] after this will make as many copies as
[58:35] is requested but we just wanted to be a
[58:39] blessing to you and just just a small
[58:43] presentation that we would have we pray
[58:46] that the Lord originally bless them may
[58:48] God bless you

[1:04:59] name tell you what it's very difficult
[1:05:04] coming behind him
[1:05:06] presentation like that
[1:05:10] you know many of us we go through trials
[1:05:13] we think we do and to think that all the
[1:05:18] things that brother Branham had to go
[1:05:20] through to
[1:05:22] deliver a message to this generation
[1:05:25] he made a presentation like that you
[1:05:28] know makes me want to press on
[1:05:31] [Music]
[1:05:33] amen all the trials that perhaps you
[1:05:35] think you have after something like this
[1:05:39] you know you don't have any any trials
[1:05:41] whatsoever he managed just encourages
[1:05:44] you to be a better Christian encourages
[1:05:47] you to be more sincere he men and it was
[1:05:53] said by a brother one time that
[1:05:56] the Branham spent many many days many
[1:05:59] months in the field away from his family
[1:06:04] praying for the sick burdened for the
[1:06:09] people
[1:06:11] with children back home perhaps needing
[1:06:16] little touching their bodies as well but
[1:06:19] he gave his life amen for a message
[1:06:23] amen and I appreciate
[1:06:27] the profit that God has sent to this
[1:06:29] generation I mean that with all my heart
[1:06:32] so in mine I mean it
[1:06:35] amen and spoken-word books and different
[1:06:37] things that ministry that
[1:06:41] the brendham families has now trying to
[1:06:44] get the message out it's amazing
[1:06:46] what effect those books have on the
[1:06:49] people
[1:06:50] a man and I just k-11 little buckles
[1:06:57] one
[1:07:00] many times you feel that you have a
[1:07:02] problem that you don't feel it's
[1:07:04] answered yet you come across a tape that
[1:07:08] every answer to every problem is on
[1:07:12] those books and tapes
[1:07:14] amen
[1:07:16] so therefore I certainly do appreciate
[1:07:18] this presentation very much and
[1:07:21] appreciate the family being here we have

[1:13:58] Brandon family have to come and see it

[1:14:11] years for brother Billy and the family

[1:14:24] people a man praise God Genesis 19 God
[1:14:29] come down first Kings 19 God come down
[1:14:32] praise God revelation 19 Amen right on
[1:14:36] down and 1946 to 1965 God come down pray
[1:14:42] you believe that a man 19 years later
[1:14:45] it's time for God to be here in the
[1:14:49] prophets family
[1:14:50] what a blessing there's no way that we
[1:14:53] can explain it you know we're all like
[1:14:56] actually we come from heaven and we
[1:15:00] don't have anything to do with that
[1:15:02] first book that's just natural lives and
[1:15:05] the natural deeds and all the things
[1:15:07] that God has written down that book but
[1:15:10] he has another section called the blood
[1:15:12] section praise God and that section is
[1:15:16] was God's little orphans in the world
[1:15:19] and they've all mixed up many colors and
[1:15:22] races and different denominations and
[1:15:24] religions and then God didn't he had his
[1:15:28] orphans there he's I will not leave you
[1:15:31] comfortless as orphans in the world I'll
[1:15:34] come down myself in the dark and cloudy
[1:15:36] day and get you and I'll find a body
[1:15:40] William Brennan to come down to get you
[1:15:44] you won't have to worry about doctrines
[1:15:47] and interpretations and revelations
[1:15:49] because in my orphans and my children I
[1:15:52] don't care what color they are where
[1:15:54] where they are will be a seed will be
[1:15:57] adjourned blood and when I speak through
[1:16:01] my prophet that's German blood worry
[1:16:05] and my orphans they'll catch that and
[1:16:08] they'll gather and I won't lose one I
[1:16:11] know where they are
[1:16:13] amen praise God and I'll gather them
[1:16:16] together and it may look dark in 1987
[1:16:21] looks like is the message is nothing but
[1:16:23] that's just the way I wanted to look cuz
[1:16:26] I took my children down to the Red Sea
[1:16:28] one time it was impossible to go over I
[1:16:32] said Moses take him to make dawn he
[1:16:37] purposely told him to take him to McDole
[1:16:39] where he knew there would be a Red Sea
[1:16:41] where he knew that favor would have come
[1:16:43] breathing down their backs and at that
[1:16:46] time don't cry
[1:16:47] speak and move forward so praise God I
[1:16:51] don't care how dark it gets how many
[1:16:53] clouds all around Amen the Sun is still
[1:16:56] shining behind them clouds
[1:16:58] amen and how we appreciate it and know
[1:17:03] that there is a man that can turn on the
[1:17:06] light praise God praise God praise God
[1:17:10] so I thank the Lord to know that we are
[1:17:13] orphans but he sent a comforter to get
[1:17:16] us it will be no more often we'll be
[1:17:18] adopted praise God we're going home amen
[1:17:22] we have a father amen
[1:17:23] so praise God the message is such now
[1:17:27] that
[1:17:27] that really behooves you to stretch out
[1:17:32] on faith and really believe and really
[1:17:34] step on say a Red Sea giveaway amen

[1:17:41] unbelief
[1:17:42] we're going over praise God so anyway
[1:17:46] today after the presentation and there's
[1:17:51] just no way that I would ask brother
[1:17:53] Billy to speak now because he uh as you
[1:17:56] saw he's wrapped up into that and he
[1:17:59] just has a presence and something with
[1:18:01] him this afternoon I could sense it
