[0:39] you you shall ask what you will and it
[0:43] shall be done unto you ask what you will
[0:48] and it shall it shall it shall it shall
[0:54] be done unto you ask for your
[0:57] healing ask for the Holy Ghost
[1:00] Amen brother Eddie you believe that
[1:03] brother
[1:04] Gonzalez you hold up God on Chang your
[1:08] hand you hold from that
[1:11] promise glory to God
[1:18] hallelujah oh
[1:20] my ask what you
[1:24] will here's an
[1:26] example a married woman she's anxious us
[1:30] to have to embrace her little
[1:33] baby and she could hardly
[1:35] wait her
[1:38] anticipation is so great but if brother
[1:42] brandom said if she don't watch behind
[1:46] that
[1:48] anticipation is a fear that will show up
[1:52] that she might not have that
[1:56] baby now you looking for the Holy Ghost
[2:01] you have a
[2:02] fear that it might be
[2:04] over maybe you're not
[2:07] redeemed maybe you made a
[2:11] mistake that's only a fear from the
[2:14] devil you hold to God some change your
[2:18] hand this is your season this is your
[2:22] time it's impossible for God to lose you
[2:27] totally
[2:28] impossible God came down
[2:30] on the ramp parts of
[2:32] Glory he left the Ivory Tower he come
[2:36] down to the FR come on down the third
[2:39] second and here he is now how Jehovah is
[2:44] Among Us
[2:45] Now Eli
[2:48] El come back through
[2:52] Jehovah Redemption by
[2:54] power is here today amen am now she has
[3:00] a fear she might not have this
[3:03] baby then that fear draws her further
[3:07] away all the
[3:09] time amen see now there's a
[3:13] remedy it's worked in all
[3:15] ages if that
[3:17] woman sees or
[3:20] believes that she's not going to have or
[3:22] give
[3:23] birth to this baby if she will just go
[3:27] out and adopt the
[3:30] baby then the first thing you know she
[3:33] will have one of her
[3:35] own the prophet said this has proven
[3:38] correct nine out of 10
[3:41] times why because the strain of
[3:46] wondering can I live it can I stop the
[3:50] lust
[3:51] thoughts strain
[3:55] straining
[3:57] wondering oh maybe I won't have it
[4:00] I won't get sealed I won't get
[4:03] healed oh
[4:07] Hallelujah but that adopted
[4:10] baby takes that little satisfaction
[4:14] there maybe God maybe it's God's
[4:18] way of getting her in
[4:22] condition adopted baby get the woman in
[4:26] condition get a mind set right
[4:31] with a faith she knows she's going to
[4:33] have
[4:34] it
[4:37] Glory then she will have her own
[4:40] baby because that
[4:42] scare and fear and
[4:46] anticipation will finally leave
[4:50] her you mean to tell me that this is the
[4:54] hour at that fear that
[4:58] scare anticipation
[5:01] will finally leave the
[5:05] bride something
[5:07] inside let the redeemed say
[5:10] so something
[5:12] within that you know you're
[5:15] redeemed that's the same way about
[5:19] people that want to get
[5:21] healed if they can just have one little
[5:24] visible
[5:26] evidence like Elijah in his servant
[5:30] I see a cloud side of a man's
[5:33] hand and Elijah said I hear a sound upon
[5:36] as of
[5:37] rain he saw the
[5:40] evidence the the cloud was
[5:44] Supernatural so I Elijah got
[5:47] up and that was God moving he was
[5:50] gone have you seen the
[5:54] clown huh H I hear the sound abundance
[5:57] of
[5:58] rain when will it be today not today
[6:04] tomorrow next day but I
[6:07] heard the sound of abundance of
[6:11] rain Glory
[6:14] now that's why many times I tell the
[6:19] people this is brother brandom go on
[6:24] start praising the
[6:26] Lord see because that
[6:30] is the adopted
[6:34] [Applause]

[6:42] Lord for what for your healing for the

[7:26] God that's the adopted baby
[7:31] because it's in their
[7:34] intellectuals until it comes into the
[7:37] soul that they
