[5:25] jesus said unto him if i will that he
[5:28] tarry till he come
[5:31] till i come what is that to thee

[5:47] die
[5:48] but if i will that he tarry till i come

[5:53] this is the disciple which testifieth of
[5:56] these things and wrote these things and
[5:58] we know that his testimony is true
[6:02] and there are also many other things

[8:57] [Applause]
[8:58] so maybe we getting back to that spot
[9:01] amen and brother norman and the title is
[9:04] and to godliness brotherly kindness
[9:07] my subject is forgiveness
[9:09] and just recapping wednesday night those
[9:12] you were here follow me
[9:14] was the message
[9:16] and the holy spirit kind of struck
[9:19] on the young people and i kept saying
[9:21] rock groups i i wasn't meaning that i
[9:23] was meaning just christian rock groups
[9:26] that's what i was trying to get at amy
[9:29] bryant or whoever they are amy somebody
[9:31] and mariah and all these different
[9:33] people
[9:34] and all these ungodly worldly
[9:37] uh so-called christian singing groups
[9:40] singing
[9:41] christian songs
[9:44] so if you have discernment you will
[9:46] discern right away
[9:47] what kind of spirit
[9:49] is on the tape
[9:51] and what kind of spirit is singing with
[9:52] no life
[9:54] and you wouldn't even want it in your
[9:55] car you wouldn't even want it in your
[9:57] home you wouldn't even want to touch it
[9:59] realizing that they put them a record in
[10:02] a circle and a demon
[10:04] demonizes them and say go and sell
[10:07] and then you scoop it up praise god
[10:10] having no discernment of the holy ghost
[10:13] well we don't want that in this church
[10:16] we don't want no jump beaten and
[10:18] contemporary and whatever it is amen so
[10:21] it's finished
[10:26] and you parents getting out of your
[10:28] house
[10:30] amen that's what i was speaking about
[10:32] wednesday night
[10:33] you may be seated amen
[10:35] now there's three conditions for perfect
[10:38] faith
[10:39] number one a spirit of forgiveness
[10:41] number two a revelation that god is the
[10:44] word and the word is god
[10:47] and number three um
[10:49] you must be able to identify yourself in
[10:52] the word
[10:54] so you know since you're hanging around
[10:55] here all these years and can't find
[10:57] yourself in the scriptures
[11:00] for today
[11:02] and you can point to the bibles i'm a
[11:04] written epistle for this day
[11:09] amen are we just a church member amen
[11:13] so now our faith is based on forgiveness
[11:17] amen and then reading and so we just
[11:19] have an old-fashioned time like we had
[11:21] wednesday
[11:23] amen everybody's open
[11:25] praise god
[11:28] anything can happen tonight
[11:31] amen
[11:31] [Applause]
[11:33] praise god on perfect faith page four
[11:36] and i just speaking about it i just read
[11:38] the scripture to you i want to back up
[11:40] here again on verse 25 and 26
[11:42] and uh and when you stand praying and
[11:45] after having this faith to speak to the
[11:48] mountain
[11:49] then you stand up and pray
[11:51] when you stand praying forgive
[11:54] if you have uh uh ought against any
[11:58] that your father also that your father
[12:01] also which is in heaven may forgive you
[12:03] your trespasses
[12:05] now this is a very i don't know this
[12:07] i've been saying it over and over and
[12:09] over and it don't get into the people's
[12:11] hearts
[12:13] they you will get nothing if you don't
[12:14] forgive
[12:16] because this is your age
[12:19] and i don't care if you take the skin
[12:20] off here
[12:21] praise god
[12:26] you have to forgive
[12:29] because you have come to that time
[12:32] you have lived out the shuck age
[12:35] where you say anything do anything and
[12:37] god bless you
[12:39] now we in the word now
[12:42] way up in the word
[12:45] hallelujah
[12:47] hallelujah
[12:50] praise god you may forgive you may be
[12:54] seated amen
[12:55] so therefore your father cannot forgive
[12:57] you
[12:59] amen
[13:00] and therefore when you stand praying
[13:02] can't do it
[13:03] amen now faith is based on forgiveness
[13:06] it's the prophet's word
[13:09] now how can you have seven thunder faith
[13:12] if you cannot forgive
[13:13] [Applause]
[13:14] [Music]
[13:15] then how can you be in the seventh under
[13:17] inspiration and don't forgive and hold
[13:19] grudges and arts and all kinds of things
[13:21] in the seven thunders
[13:23] [Music]
[13:24] the prophet of god himself says now
[13:26] faith is based on forgiveness
[13:29] when you come to the lord asking for
[13:31] healing and asking for that the first
[13:34] thing he does is examine you to see if
[13:36] you get any arts in your heart against
[13:38] anybody
[13:39] then your healing is blocked
[13:44] then you're asking for the holy ghost is
[13:46] blocked
[13:49] because the bible says that the love
[13:51] will perhaps love want to do it for you
[13:54] but it can go against his word
[13:56] he doesn't spoke it and so shall it be
[14:01] and the prophet has put it out here
[14:03] today as the day's message
[14:07] if there wouldn't be no prophet to make
[14:08] it seed word for today then it'd just be
[14:10] in the scripture
[14:12] but now it's living moving jumping
[14:16] praise god on tape in book
[14:19] and you can't get away
[14:20] [Applause]
[14:23] oh hallelujah praise god
[14:26] maybe cedar now faith is based on
[14:29] forgiveness and then as we said this
[14:31] morning trying to get the church into
[14:34] the place to where we could really see
[14:36] apostolic times moving among us that's
[14:39] what we all hunger and it's just laying
[14:42] right at the door
[14:43] we see it but we want to see more of it
[14:46] we want we we want it such a flow that
[14:50] it will be a help to us and flow out to
[14:52] others
[14:54] remember remember wednesday night it's
[14:56] not for you it's for others
[14:58] [Applause]
[14:58] [Music]
[15:00] god didn't raise you up for yourself
[15:03] he raised you up to use you for others
[15:07] amen
[15:08] and we're speaking about coming to the
[15:10] cross you come to the cross you're born
[15:12] again new breath and there you sit the
[15:14] blood dripping down over you identifying
[15:17] yourself with jesus christ
[15:21] then you're filled with the holy ghost
[15:22] you go up on the cross
[15:26] and hang on the cross
[15:28] and there you begin to be identified
[15:31] like him and virtue in knowledge and
[15:33] temperance and patience and godlings and
[15:35] brotherly kindness and then when you can
[15:37] die out with that sixth virtue
[15:39] godliness
[15:40] then it's time for you to step off the
[15:42] cross
[15:43] you're number seven now
[15:46] praise god and now you're gonna pick up
[15:48] the cross and put it on your back
[15:50] and put your footprints in the blood of
[15:52] jesus christ
[15:57] that's the message
[15:59] oh
[16:00] hallelujah praise god you may be seated
[16:03] amen
[16:04] so we see now faith is based on
[16:06] forgiveness so there is your spirit of
[16:09] forgiveness being your very foundation
[16:13] to begin to have perfect faith
[16:15] and seven thunders gives perfect faith
[16:18] [Applause]
[16:19] amen
[16:21] and number two revelation that god is
[16:23] the word and the word is god
[16:25] amen
[16:26] and on page 11 speaking on perfect faith
[16:29] here
[16:30] paragraph 63.
[16:32] brother brown's saying here i don't know
[16:34] the mechanics of the holy ghost i don't
[16:37] i know it fell on me i can't tell the
[16:38] mechanics of it and 25 years people
[16:41] expect you to explain perfection explain
[16:44] the prophet explain this here anything
[16:47] that you can explain there's no more
[16:49] faith
[16:52] so i'm preaching faith
[16:54] because i cannot explain
[16:56] faith
[16:59] if the prophet said get rid of tv i
[17:01] cannot explain
[17:03] tv
[17:05] i cannot explain about the tuner that's
[17:07] in the vcr i'm not going to explain the
[17:10] mechanics of it prophet said get it out
[17:14] so why come to the minister to explain
[17:16] that
[17:19] explain what
[17:20] do what he said
[17:24] hallelujah
[17:26] faith
[17:28] faith
[17:31] amen
[17:33] see why why you don't get nothing you
[17:34] want explanation
[17:37] people want to explain after you've got
[17:38] the books and tapes explain me
[17:40] explain what you speak it
[17:43] and a revelation
[17:45] takes place and you do it yourself
[17:48] then you're not following brother
[17:49] coleman
[17:50] you're following the message
[17:52] hallelujah
[17:53] [Applause]
[17:57] lauren
[17:58] amen so there we are i don't care about
[18:01] it i don't
[18:03] care about the mechanics
[18:06] i i care to to know about is the
[18:08] blessings of the holy ghost the
[18:10] mechanics he works that that's his
[18:12] secret
[18:13] amen
[18:14] this boy could not be healed that was a
[18:16] boy in saint matthew 17 when they came
[18:18] off the mountain the nine disciples was
[18:21] down there and the other three were up
[18:23] on the mountain
[18:24] the disciples had power jesus gave them
[18:27] power to heal all manner of sickness and
[18:29] cast out devils and cleanse the lepers
[18:31] and raise the dead he gave them power
[18:33] but they didn't have faith
[18:35] to operate the power that they had why
[18:37] didn't they have faith when they hadn't
[18:38] received the holy ghost yet the holy
[18:41] ghost is the one that gives the faith
[18:44] but they had the word the power without
[18:45] the holy ghost
[18:47] and there's people in the message today
[18:49] for 25 years that have the power but no
[18:52] faith to operate the power
[18:56] [Applause]
[18:58] they need the baptism of the holy ghost
[18:59] to operate that
[19:00] [Music]
[19:01] [Applause]
[19:03] yes sir
[19:04] and then they went up on the uh up on
[19:06] the up in the upper room and there did
[19:08] they receive faith to ignite the power
[19:11] that he had already given him
[19:13] amen
[19:15] so they didn't have faith to operate the
[19:16] power that they had and then they
[19:18] questioned jesus said now
[19:20] why couldn't we do it now remember or
[19:23] why they have to do this and why and
[19:25] this and that see without the holy ghost
[19:26] a question now remember they had the
[19:29] word
[19:29] and the word was fleshed in and the word
[19:32] told them i give you power you have the
[19:34] word now
[19:36] and the word tells you i give you power
[19:38] [Applause]
[19:40] you have the word direct from the
[19:41] prophet's mouth
[19:43] for this season
[19:46] that's god speaking through the prophet
[19:49] no questions
[19:51] hallelujah
[19:52] glory to god
[19:55] anna
[19:57] they had the word the word was fleshed
[19:59] in and the word told them i give you
[20:01] power amen i give you power and they had
[20:04] the power but they didn't have faith to
[20:06] operate the word that was in them
[20:10] amen
[20:12] what i mean see what it means jesus had
[20:13] he was the word and he had faith that
[20:16] what he said would happen he said oh
[20:18] bring him here how long will i suffer
[20:20] you
[20:21] yes siree how long do i have to do this
[20:24] here see he had faith with his power
[20:27] how did he he said i can do nothing in
[20:29] myself
[20:31] why he relied on upon what he was
[20:37] now can you rely on what you're supposed
[20:39] to be
[20:40] [Music]
[20:42] now there's a reason why you cannot
[20:44] amen
[20:46] amen he relied on what he was
[20:48] he relied in knowing that he was the
[20:51] word
[20:53] and he had faith in god who made him the
[20:56] word
[20:56] [Applause]
[20:58] revelation that god is the word in the
[21:00] word is god number two
[21:03] amen he's showing you the wing
[21:06] he was god the word
[21:09] and they was in him
[21:11] and that gave him faith because watch he
[21:14] understood his position
[21:16] he knew who he was
[21:18] he knew what he'd come here for
[21:21] and knew nothing could stop it
[21:23] praise god but what about you what are
[21:26] you here for
[21:27] nothing can stop you for the purpose
[21:31] all the trials and
[21:33] circumstances and in the natural cannot
[21:36] stop something spiritual praise god
[21:39] that's going to happen that god done
[21:41] spoken before the foundation of the
[21:43] world praise god is going to happen

[21:57] understood his position he knows who he

[22:06] know who you are

[25:14] faith we have confidence towards god if
[25:17] you want to read that the saint john 3
[25:19] 21 got the scripture if our hearts
[25:22] condemn us not then we have confidence

[26:50] that you're wrong you ought a man who
[26:52] you put yourself back to your sinner by

[41:22] reflection of yourself
[41:24] in the natural page 23 that's the way
[41:26] god does he takes the gold that he has
[41:28] found in the earth and he beats it by
[41:30] the holy spirit turn it over and over
[41:32] and over and beaten until he can see his
[41:34] reflection and that's what we're
[41:36] supposed to do reflect the son of god
[41:38] and now we're supposed to do his work
[41:40] saint john 14 12.
[41:43] you're beginning to reflect the works of
[41:45] god but so many of us try to do the
[41:47] works of christ before the reflection of
[41:49] christ is in us now there's a trouble we
[41:52] find these things happening you know it
[41:55] i know it we see these stumbles along
[41:58] the road we find the scrap heaps of

[42:35] because i preached wednesday on that
[42:37] sixth step which is the number of man
[42:40] and you can't go no further than that

[52:12] i'm going to strike it here now and get
[52:14] ready to close out here shortly
[52:16] amen
[52:18] praise god i wanna i got it took me 17
[52:21] years to come back around to this here i
[52:23] want to finish it amen
[52:25] verse 20 then peter turning about see it
[52:28] the disciple whom jesus loved following
[52:30] which also lean on his breast itself and
[52:32] said lord which is he that betrayeth
[52:35] thee peter seeing him say it to jesus
[52:38] lord what shall this man do
[52:42] in other words ephraim said lord what
[52:44] shall manasses do
[52:47] praise god
[52:48] so now
[52:50] peter had the instructions from jesus in
[52:52] verse 18 and 19 follow me
[52:55] now peter felt great he felt good he had
[52:58] heard from god he's walking with jesus
[53:01] he's number
[53:02] number one
[53:03] amen
[53:05] and now he wanted now he wants to know i
[53:07] know what i'm doing now here come this
[53:09] man jumping right now lord what's he
[53:11] supposed to do
[53:12] because you and i together lord you know
[53:14] what is he one
[53:16] yes sir why is he following us
[53:19] amen see now he want to know what was
[53:21] john supposed to do
[53:23] and then peter knows john following with
[53:25] that without the same invitation that he
[53:28] had jesus told peter follow me he didn't
[53:30] tell john to follow him john just tagged
[53:32] alone
[53:33] [Music]
[53:36] amen see so peter said what shall this
[53:39] man do
[53:40] 22nd verse
[53:42] jesus said unto him if i will that he
[53:45] tarry till i come
[53:47] what is that to thee
[53:49] follow thou me
[53:52] so jesus rebuked his curiosity
[53:56] by stating that if it was his will that
[53:59] he lived to his second coming that was
[54:02] none of peter's concern
[54:05] and what i'm doing and what the prophet
[54:07] ordained me to do is none of these
[54:08] menace is concerned
[54:12] i'm in my church i'm in my place i'm
[54:14] ordained to be here there's no woman's
[54:16] concern and she ain't got nothing to say
[54:17] about it and that's why i don't even
[54:19] listen to them praise god i don't care
[54:21] what they say amen because it's none of
[54:23] the concern
[54:25] hallelujah
[54:26] what is that today follow thou me
[54:29] praise god you may be seated
[54:32] it was enough for him to be concerned
[54:34] about doing god's will in his own life
[54:36] let alone uh worrying about what is
[54:39] john's supposed to be doing
[54:40] jesus said what is that to thee follow
[54:43] thou me jesus words however were readily
[54:46] misconstrued as an assurance that john
[54:49] would live on until the lord's return
[54:53] the if
[54:54] he said what if
[54:56] was easily forgotten john himself
[54:58] corrects this false impression in verse
[55:00] 23 then went this saying abroad among
[55:03] the brethren that the disciples should
[55:05] not die
[55:07] yet jesus said not unto him he shall not
[55:11] die but if i will that he tarry till i
[55:15] come
[55:16] what is that to thee
[55:19] and that's where all the troubles and
[55:20] the messages at they misconstrue what
[55:22] the prophet said
[55:24] and a couple of all kind of crazy things
[55:26] praise god
[55:28] i wanted the same thing to happen in
[55:29] this age
[55:32] amen even in the churches people say
[55:34] things and misconstrue it and get mad
[55:36] and almost shake somebody's hand all
[55:38] like is here it wasn't even spoken that
[55:40] way
[55:42] see
[55:43] saying going abroad about many things in
[55:45] the message 1967 there was a binding
[55:48] spirit coming the message to stop the
[55:50] ministers from preaching and forming a
[55:52] denomination in the message
[55:54] and i was getting a haircut one day over
[55:56] in the bronx there in manhattan
[55:57] somewhere
[55:58] and i knew that certain spirit i had to
[56:01] face the people sunday 1967 i was
[56:04] thinking about it and my heart
[56:06] and the holy spirit thundered down into
[56:08] my car said what is that to thee follow
[56:11] thou me
[56:13] and that binding spread broke
[56:15] by the word
[56:18] so i ain't worried no more about what
[56:20] they're talking about amen
[56:21] he said follow down me
[56:23] and i had tried to follow him right on
[56:25] up to the night june 7 1991
[56:29] despite all the things that they have to
[56:31] say despite all what's been said about
[56:34] by what i preach in my church and my
[56:36] conventions and so forth still what is
[56:38] that today follow thou mean

[56:43] heaven worrying about what they're
[56:44] saying i'll tell you that but you will
[56:46] get to if you do what jesus tell you to
[56:48] do
[56:50] that's right
[56:52] and drop your amen follow thou me and
[56:54] drop your arts and forgive them and
[56:57] follow thou me to the seventh step and

[58:18] with the holy ghost
[58:20] is going to step out and begin to add
[58:23] these virtues
[58:26] and they're going to hit that sixth one
[58:27] and die
[58:29] then they will have faith to make this
[58:31] last great step up on that seventh step
[58:36] there they will meet charity
[58:42] it's got to be done
[58:43] why because christ must live in this
[58:47] church
