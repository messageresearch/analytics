[15:44] have too much time here so anyway uh now
[15:47] the line has roared who will not fear
[15:50] the the the the Lord God has spoken now
[15:53] that's a question today did he
[15:56] speak well then who can but prophesy
[15:59] [Applause]
[16:03] amen so anyway may be
[16:06] seated so Malachi 4 has revealed all of
[16:09] these
[16:11] mysterious uh truths that was hid in the
[16:15] Bible and you know as we as it was just
[16:18] take I did it in New York here a week I
[16:20] don't have it with me but take the Bible
[16:22] here brother BR if you don't understand
[16:23] what seven Scrolls roll up like this uh
[16:27] scrolls with little tabs sticking out
[16:28] see seals but put seven straps around
[16:31] there like like in Puerto Rico which is
[16:33] their seal down there amen Puerto Rico
[16:36] is a Bible the Lamb on it amen so now if
[16:40] uh only uh if only six seals was broken
[16:45] as the ministers say some of them well
[16:47] then the Bible is still sealed with the
[16:50] seventh one and there is no
[16:53] message so you might as well go on in
[16:55] the
[16:57] world so you might as well go
[17:01] amen can you say Amen to
[17:03] that all right may be seated the seventh
[17:08] seal if that is not broken then brother
[17:11] Bram did not deliver a
[17:13] message because his message was under
[17:16] the seventh
[17:21] seal
[17:24] amen so and the lamb broke that seventh
[17:29] seal and a l reveal that seventh
[17:32] seal but he you may be seated couldn't
[17:35] bring it all to the public but what it
[17:37] was it was the mystery of the
[17:39] Thunders it was the mystery of the
[17:42] coming of
[17:45] Christ and the Thunders hell the
[17:49] mystery and is being revealed in
[17:56] you that's why we shouting that's why we
[17:59] thanking God Amen it may be seated so
[18:05] therefore and when the seventh seal
[18:08] broke then the Bible that last seal
[18:11] broke then the Bible is open and I
[18:14] believe spoken words Original Seed I
[18:16] think page 58 somewhere around through
[18:17] there he says uh uh Elijah will plant
[18:22] the seed of the Bible from Genesis Plum
[18:26] through revelation well how could he do
[18:29] it if it was sealed with the seven
[18:34] seal
[18:37] amen
[18:39] amen Amen brother Kelly amen yes sir and
[18:44] then that is so and that means in
[18:46] Revelation 10 son of man
[18:51] Messiah come down on the earth and
[18:53] roared out seven Thunders
[18:58] [Applause]
[19:02] amen may be seated because before he
[19:05] could do that the Seven Seals that held
[19:08] the Seven Fold Miss of the Bible held
[19:10] the Bible
[19:12] closed that had to be open and when that
[19:15] was open March 17th uh 18th through the
[19:18] 24th then it was time for Revelation
[19:21] 10
[19:23] Messiah the the prophet was supposed to
[19:26] open the the Mysteries and uh and and
[19:30] gather of all the Loose Ends and then go
[19:33] under the seven seal and tell you is it
[19:35] is seven Thunders banging 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
[19:39] but going home it's not time yet but the
[19:41] seven Thunders under the seventh seal
[19:43] are connected to the coming of the
[19:48] Lord
[19:50] amen you may be seated and then when he
[19:54] slips down begins to reveal that Thunder
[19:57] message to you then the see is broken
[19:59] that Easter seal is broken which is a
[20:01] seven seal and you're under there like
[20:04] all the rest
[20:06] are amen so praise God it's been so much
[20:12] controversy that's why the Lord knew
[20:15] when he uh broke the seals and the
[20:17] prophet delivered the message and it was
[20:19] a silence put on it he knew that all
[20:21] these old
[20:22] Fighters cor and day and all the rest of
[20:25] them you knew he give years to die out
[20:29] he knew that with their unbelief they
[20:32] wouldn't go on and take the truths they
[20:34] wouldn't take a hidden message that laid
[20:37] in the pages of the Bible for the bride
[20:40] only which would beeve by
[20:46] Thunder
[20:48] amen may be seated so God knew that he
[20:52] had some young people under that he was
[20:54] waiting
[20:57] for my
[20:59] ah amen glory here they
[21:03] are Satan here they are
[21:07] here
[21:09] amen so there we are you may be seated
[21:12] and that's why you're shouting and
[21:14] praising God cuz the old Fighters they
[21:17] won't uh go over Revelation 5 verse 8-14
[21:21] and worship King lamb they don't want to
[21:23] do it they want to sit dead in the
[21:24] church and argue and dis quotations
[21:27] about this and I think this and somebody
[21:30] spoke two words in tongues and I got one
[21:32] word of it oh what are you talking about
[21:34] brother praise God the whole Bible is
[21:36] open praise God
[21:44] Amen excuse me you may be seated I
[21:47] better get out of here cuz very nice in
[21:50] here and everything and I'm not supposed
[21:51] to be preaching I'm very tired but I'm
[21:53] supposed to set this video for you
[21:56] anyway and Eagle stir his nest uh before
[21:59] um my scripture uh Genesis 19 I'll just
[22:03] say it this way I'll just paraphrase it
[22:05] Genesis 19 we know the angel of God can
[22:07] walking down a dusty road one day amen
[22:11] and that was God and God said Elohim
[22:13] said uh come here Michael come here
[22:15] Gabriel let's go on down and see Abraham
[22:18] Because he believes the
[22:19] word huh he believes a promise
[22:23] amen say come here may be seated and he
[22:27] put 16 elements together together and
[22:28] they come walking down a dusty road
[22:30] about 12:00 noon praise God
[22:35] Amen so praise God and they received it
[22:39] maybe seated Sarah received the promise
[22:42] and then God said to Abraham now Abraham
[22:44] I'm going to send Billy Graham and all
[22:46] Roberts down to Sodom and they ain't got
[22:49] much of a message but they got to get
[22:51] lot
[22:54] out amen so they couldn't do it
[22:59] so they say well uh Abraham shall I hide
[23:01] from Abraham what I'm about to do I'm
[23:03] going to reveal these Thunders to you
[23:07] Abraham amen cuz I know Abraham in your
[23:13] churches you will teach your children
[23:16] that this message of Malachi 4 was the
[23:23] Thunders therefore Abraham your children
[23:26] will start a Revival in in the
[23:32] Thunders amen there are may be seated we
[23:38] not clannish now no we would to God
[23:41] everybody would be here
[23:44] tonight but some don't want to come amen
[23:47] what can we do what can we say but
[23:49] anyway you got the picture so anyway he
[23:51] says uh then Abraham went into
[23:54] intercession like you've been doing and
[23:56] he said Lord with your spirit fulfill 50
[23:58] show our spirit for 50 you can find 50
[24:02] amen they went on down to 45 and and and
[24:04] 40 and 30 20 can to find 10 he our
[24:09] spirit Abraham for 10 now 10 what 10
[24:13] athletes 10 football players 10
[24:16] volleyball players huh 10 uh would be
[24:20] preachers 10 what huh 10 with Christ
[24:24] Living in them
[24:29] amen you may be seated so therefore he
[24:33] couldn't find 10 so therefore he said I
[24:36] have to come on down and the only ones
[24:38] down that going to be saved is
[24:39] predestinated ones many going to think
[24:41] they are getting saved but but they will
[24:44] not be saved because the prophet had to
[24:45] preach a third pull to souls in prison
[24:49] and he had to do another thing he had to
[24:51] uh uh reveal all Seven Seals and reveal
[24:54] the hidden Mystery under the seven seal
[24:56] and then he had to have five
[24:57] manifestations go with
[24:59] it that's a third
[25:04] pull and we promise the same thing amen
[25:08] so I'm just cutting it up here so here's
[25:10] how you know when the angel will come to
[25:12] you now remember the prophet brings the
[25:14] word uh the shout and then the angel of
[25:17] God that's in the prophet that brought
[25:19] the shout certainly knows what he
[25:22] said so he comes as the Holy
[25:26] Spirit to confirm what he already
[25:32] said
[25:34] amen may be seated so the angel of God
[25:37] the voice of the Archangel is here
[25:40] tonight to confirm what the angel
[25:43] himself said in the prophet St Luke
[25:46] 17:30 the Holy Spirit when he's come
[25:49] he'll take the things of mine and reveal
[25:52] it unto
[25:53] [Applause]
[25:55] you amen you may be seated
[25:59] so therefore you got the the picture
[26:00] here now you want Revival well brother
[26:03] you have to get the word if you going to
[26:05] have Revival and Eagle stir this Nest
[26:08] page 26 before God was destroying Sodom
[26:12] he sent his Angel to warn Abraham why
[26:14] because Abraham was one who lived by the
[26:16] word and kept the word that is how
[26:18] Angels come to man because they keep
[26:23] God's word Three Angels Came to Abraham
[26:26] and told him a Godly prophet of God
[26:29] that God would destroy Sodom watch the
[26:31] reason for these Three Angels visit they
[26:33] were bringing the news of the last
[26:36] warning of Destruction and the angels
[26:39] left Abraham's place and went on to
[26:42] Sodom to tell Sodom of the pending
[26:44] judgment Sodom in return laughed at the
[26:48] angels and even sought to do evil to the
[26:51] angels oh how like the so-called
[26:55] churches of the world today a real God
[26:57] sent man will come into their city and
[27:02] they will seek to do him evil and hurt
[27:05] rather than stand behind them and the
[27:07] man's preaching the message reading the
[27:09] quotes anointed signs following it and
[27:13] they will still seek to do him evil
[27:15] because he didn't come out of their
[27:19] school or something that they haven't
[27:21] heard before
[27:23] amen so anyway and stand behind him and
[27:26] Bank him up and support him and pick he
[27:28] to the message but the Bible says that
[27:30] they would be like that anyway well he
[27:33] goes on to Second Timothy I just cut it
[27:35] off here and on your testimony on the
[27:37] sea I want to say this to encourage you
[27:40] tonight on uh testimony on the sea uh
[27:43] Dallas series page three he speaking
[27:46] about Jesus there with with the
[27:48] fisherman there brother Bram said here I
[27:51] I would have Lov to have living that day
[27:53] to follow him but you know I'm glad I
[27:56] still have the privilege of doing the
[27:57] same thing watching him do things and
[28:00] it's greater listen now don't be
[28:02] discouraged here it is greater to watch
[28:05] him today than what it was
[28:11] then huh there shouldn't be a sad eye
[28:16] nobody in despair everybody should be
[28:19] shouting and praising God greater for
[28:23] today amen may be
[28:26] seated and watching him do
[28:29] things and greater to watch him today
[28:31] than it was then I have more faith in
[28:33] him now and can have more faith now than
[28:37] I could have then because we've had
[28:41] 2,000 years to prove that the gospel is
[28:44] right and after 2,000 years he's still
[28:48] alive
[28:49] oh he's alive in you tonight so how much
[28:53] more faith should you have
[28:56] tonight amen
[29:00] okay amen prove he's still amen he's
[29:02] still alive and after 2,000 years he's
[29:05] still alive doing just as he did then so
[29:08] we have a greater assurance and a more
[29:10] foundation for Faith now than they had
[29:13] then because he was just a man going
[29:16] around with a claim that he was sent
[29:18] from God and was a Son of God and that
[29:20] God was vindicating his promis word of
[29:21] that day by him and they had somewhat
[29:26] the reason to doubt it now watch very
[29:28] careful here now very treacherous right
[29:30] here to doubt it the theologians they
[29:34] were and you notice it was a pathetic
[29:37] thing it was really pathetic because
[29:41] them
[29:41] theologians would have
[29:44] believe that if God had not blinded
[29:49] their
[29:50] eyes you mean the
[29:53] Pharisees you mean the
[29:56] Sadducees would have gladly receive
[29:59] Jesus
[30:00] Christ the ministers if God had not
[30:03] blinded them in that
[30:08] day you mean that they would have
[30:11] received the
[30:12] Thunders
[30:15] huh the
[30:17] seals you may be
[30:19] seated Jesus preached the seals in St
[30:23] Matthew
[30:25] 24 can we say Amen
[30:29] oh brother Brown preached the seals in
[30:32] the Book of
[30:33] Revelation Jesus omitted the seventh
[30:37] seal brother Bram omitted the seventh
[30:39] seal in that sense because he was a
[30:42] prophetic gift to reveal
[30:47] it and what did he
[30:50] reveal maybe seated brother Brandon
[30:53] revealed the same Jesus that would not
[30:54] preach it in St Matthew and that Jesus
[30:57] that would not preach it in and Matthew
[30:58] came in William brand and revealed
[31:01] it the coming of the Lord and we are
[31:06] here
[31:08] oh
[31:10] Hallelujah may be
[31:12] seated you mean to tell me that we are
[31:16] revealing the coming of the
[31:20] lord we hear the young people
[31:23] huh it's a mystery and the Thunders hold
[31:28] the
[31:29] mystery you may be
[31:32] seated anyway that was my thought and
[31:34] and did you know he promised that he
[31:37] would blind their eyes again today that
[31:41] they wouldn't see it they would be
[31:43] headyy high minded lovers of pleasure
[31:45] more than lovers of God truth Breakers
[31:48] false accusers incontinent despisers
[31:50] those that are good having a form of God
[31:52] but would deny the power thereof and
[31:55] they would deny the power of the
[31:57] Thunders of they the power of the
[31:58] Resurrection The Power of Revelation
[32:01] they deny
[32:02] it oh but they they fine minister is
[32:06] fine man cultured man fine but they're
[32:10] false anointed cuz they're
[32:17] blind come out of there praise
[32:20] [Applause]
[32:23] God maybe
[32:26] seated so I'll just pass on I hope you
[32:30] got that if you are under one of these
[32:33] blind ministers pray for them but if God
[32:36] blinded him and you know that what the
[32:38] message is you better get out of
[32:40] there cuz there ain't no time left okay
[32:44] finish up here three kind of Believers
[32:47] page 46 though he may not give me the
[32:49] power to walk like Enoch and not have to
[32:52] die but just take an afternoon walk and
[32:55] go home with him but God I do believe
[32:57] that it will happen because I know that
[32:58] there is to be a Rapture in the last
[33:00] days and the work has to be cut short
[33:02] father so says our calendar 36 more
[33:05] years and the work will be over and
[33:07] you'll have to come sometime within that
[33:11] or there'll be no flesh saved so are we
[33:13] conscious
