[0:00] St John 17 the 18th verse through the
[0:04] 23rd and I'm going to read Ephesians 4
[0:10] 1-6 I'm reading from St John the 17th
[0:13] chapter the 18th verse as thou H has
[0:17] sent me into the world even so have I
[0:22] also sent them into the world and for
[0:25] their sakes I sanctify myself
[0:30] that they also might be Sanctified
[0:33] through the
[0:35] truth neither pray I for these
[0:39] alone but for them also which Shall
[0:42] Believe on me through their word here we
[0:45] are praise our God aren't you happy that
[0:48] you believe their word Paul's word
[0:51] Peter's word James word that's and he
[0:54] prayed for us for those who would
[0:56] believe their word their message
[1:00] that they may be one as thy father art
[1:03] in me and I in thee that they also may
[1:07] be one in us that the world may believe
[1:11] that thou has sent me and the glory
[1:13] which thou gavest me I have given them
[1:16] that they may be one even as we are one
[1:19] i in them and thou in me that they may
[1:23] be made perfect in one and that the
[1:25] world may know that thou has sent me and
[1:28] Hast loved them as thou has loved me
[1:32] Ephesians 4 I therefore the prisoner of
[1:35] the Lord beseech you that you walk
[1:37] worthy of the vocation wherewith you are
[1:40] called with all loneliness and meekness
[1:43] with longsuffering forbearing one
[1:46] another in love endeavoring to keep the
[1:48] unity of the spirit in the bond of
[1:51] Peace there is one body and one Spirit
[1:55] even as you are called in one hope of
[1:57] your calling one Lord one faith
[2:00] one baptism one God and Father of all
[2:03] who is above all through all and in you
[2:05] all but unto every one of us is given
[2:09] Grace according to the measure of the
[2:11] gift of Christ wherefore he saith when
[2:15] he ascended up on high he led captivity
[2:18] captive gave gifts unto men now that he
[2:22] ascended what is it but that he also
[2:24] descended first into the lower parts of
[2:26] the earth he that descended in the same
[2:29] also so is the same also that ascended
[2:32] up far above all Heavens that he might
[2:35] fill all things he gave some Apostles
[2:37] some prophets some evangelists some
[2:40] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[2:43] of the Saints for the work of the
[2:46] ministry that there's only one Ministry
[2:48] although the ministry which is Christ's
[2:51] Ministry uh for the edifying of the body
[2:55] of Christ now here we all come in a
[2:59] Unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[3:02] of the Son of God unto a perfect man
[3:05] unto the measure of the stature of the
[3:07] fullness of Christ that we henceforth be
[3:11] no more children tossed to and fro and
[3:13] carried about with every wind of
[3:15] Doctrine by the slave of
[3:17] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[3:20] lying waight to deceive but speaking the
[3:23] truth in love may grow up into him in
[3:26] all things which is the head even Christ
[3:30] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[3:32] together and compacted by that which
[3:35] every joint supplieth according to the
[3:38] effectual working in the measure of
[3:40] every part maketh increase of the body
[3:43] unto the edifying of itself in love may
[3:47] God a blessing to the reading of his
[3:49] word I'd like to take a little title
[3:52] from this here perfect in
[3:55] one we know the word
[3:57] perfect uh in the Greek as we study just
[4:00] to get the meaning of it not that we're
[4:01] teaching Greek but the word would it
[4:04] signifies having reached this end
[4:07] finished
[4:09] complete and uh uh Ephesians 4 here the
[4:13] great book of Ephesians is where Mali 4
[4:16] Elijah brought the church back to
[4:20] Ephesians Ephesians is the anti
[4:22] anti-type of uh a Canan landed type in
[4:26] the sense of it being spiritual warfare
[4:29] and Joshua and Israel back in the Book
[4:32] of Joshua it's the Joshua book of the
[4:34] new New Testament for it represents a
[4:37] Joshua was en type of the Holy Spirit
[4:40] and this is the one book in here that
[4:43] Paul tries to bring the church to its
[4:46] fullness and this particular chapter
[4:49] here in these 16 verses here uh speaks
[4:53] about one body a complex organism with
[4:58] many functions
[5:00] each in his own place working in harmony
[5:03] his basic principle is
[5:06] love Christ himself is the head and the
[5:09] directive Force now the one body is
[5:13] composed of many members diverse talents
[5:17] and tempers the fundamental
[5:20] requisite for his proper
[5:23] functioning is a spirit of
[5:26] humility and mutual forbearance
[5:29] allowance of forgiving for one another
[5:31] on the part of the members one toward
[5:34] another his object his goal is in verse
[5:38] 13 till we all come in unity of the
[5:42] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[5:44] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[5:46] of the Statue of the fullness of Christ
[5:48] this is the goal this is our Earthly
[5:51] goal and uh we know that uh as this as
[5:56] the church was moving toward this goal
[6:00] in the first three verses here he said
[6:03] that we were to Endeavor to keep the
[6:06] unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
[6:09] that means that it was to nurture each
[6:12] member nurturing one another into the
[6:15] perfect image of Christ and the way we
[6:18] could do it would be with through
[6:20] humility there would be no other way
[6:23] other than to be done through humility
[6:26] and he said to keep the unity of the
[6:29] Spirit and the spirit is the word of God
[6:33] and the unity of the spirit we know came
[6:36] forth in these last days by God's
[6:39] Prophet down in Indiana it was poured
[6:41] out and put on tapes and books so we
[6:43] Endeavor here to keep that Unity with
[6:47] the spirit through the prophet that
[6:48] poured out the message and we Endeavor
[6:51] to do this with humility instructing
[6:56] edifying exalting one another to keep
[6:59] this Unity cuz we cannot have the
[7:02] strange false doctrines moving in cuz it
[7:06] breaks the spirit one word one word off
[7:10] there's no ministers or there's no no
[7:12] Holy Ghost breaks the unity of the
[7:14] spirit amen just one word it's all you
[7:18] need so then uh here Paul is teaching
[7:21] that it would be a growth you would be
[7:24] growing up into a full manhood into uh
[7:28] his standard his stature and his full
[7:31] manhood and Christ's full manhood as a
[7:34] corn of wheat was his three and A2 year
[7:37] Ministry that was the standard that the
[7:41] all the uh the bride was to attain to
[7:44] that standard that life that was in that
[7:47] 3 and 1/2 year Ministry that life of
[7:50] love that life of of signs wonders
[7:53] Miracles always doing the things that
[7:55] please the father about the father's
[7:57] business that's the standard that we are
[8:00] striving Reaching Forward to amen now
[8:05] the church uh uh uh we know that
[8:08] childhood of the church will pass and
[8:11] its maturity will come cuz it has been
[8:14] spoken now the church for nearly 2,000
[8:18] years it's nearly 2,000 years old and in
[8:21] this respect is still in his childhood
[8:23] State see it has not yet reached its
[8:27] visible
[8:30] manifestation of the whole known Unity
[8:34] it wasn't in the early church see it was
[8:37] it had reached a state inary church it
[8:39] was Unity it was one heart one Soul one
[8:43] Doctrine see one Spirit see it was one
[8:48] upon on the earth and but as we know as
[8:50] time begin to go on the spirit of the
[8:53] Antichrist began to move in just to
[8:55] break the doctrine down see and we all
[8:58] know from the teaching
[9:00] and then Paul mainly as a
[9:02] messenger he was continually trying to
[9:06] bring the church to the fullness of
[9:08] Christ from which they had lost their
[9:10] first love and begin to wne away even in
[9:14] the the Ephesus age and Paul went
[9:17] forward mainly he was against the
[9:20] factual elements in local churches they
[9:23] had Jew and and Gentile dissension and
[9:27] and the controversy in the Corinthian
[9:29] Church the legalism in Galatians and uh
[9:33] the book of Hebrews and so forth he was
[9:36] constantly at War trying to break down
[9:39] the barriers trying to bring them back
[9:41] to a Oneness which they didn't have the
[9:45] I mean as a visible church I mean but
[9:46] the invisible Church of course kept
[9:48] moving right on Amen the invisible ones
[9:51] those who were dead and their lives were
[9:54] hid with Christ in God the invisible
[9:57] ones who were being fed by the word amen
[10:01] they have kept moving on through every
[10:03] generation but I'm speaking about where
[10:07] like it was in Jerusalem when the the
[10:10] heathens raged the cils gathered
[10:13] together and to come against a visible
[10:16] church that had signs wonders and mirac
[10:19] father had the love of God in it that's
[10:22] the what I'm speaking about where there
[10:23] was a group of people and they knew who
[10:25] they were they knew that they had been
[10:27] with Jesus amen cuz they spoke with the
[10:30] same Authority amen they had the same
[10:33] life the same signs the same wonders
[10:36] amen and then uh uh Paul was striving
[10:40] for that there and he was fighting a
[10:42] good fight he was Keeping the Faith see
[10:45] and then come the bitter
[10:47] controversies through the second through
[10:49] the fourth centuries then the Imperial
[10:52] Church uh with his outward semblance of
[10:55] unity under State Authority see but it
[10:58] was uh it was a wicked church and then
[11:01] through the papal hierarchy with the
[11:04] unity of authority that robed men of
[11:06] their rights and so forth and drove the
[11:09] Bible out of circulation and move on
[11:11] into that and then we know as the light
[11:14] begin to come out of that the Protestant
[11:16] movement Luther and Wesley and on down
[11:19] into the Pentecostals and it went on
[11:21] into different streams it still wasn't a
[11:24] visible church yet just a invisible ones
[11:27] moving on see Catching wor to move it on
[11:30] and then it moved on down to our age to
[11:33] Malachi 4 Hallelujah and then when
[11:36] Malachi 4 come forward we all rejoiced
[11:40] but we said well now we will be one amen
[11:44] and what are we are we one why there's
[11:47] over 100 different variation of this
[11:50] message is that right and then yet we
[11:53] say we going to be one now cuz Malachi 4
[11:55] has brought back the original word
[11:57] restored back the original faith and yet
[12:00] you can go into different groups and
[12:02] hear all kind of Revelations of the one
[12:05] Revelation Jesus Christ in you the hope
[12:07] of glory and you hear all kind you see
[12:11] but that that had to be so there's still
[12:14] all kind of strange doctrines and ideas
[12:16] and you wonder in your heart will they
[12:18] ever be the outw the outward rather
[12:22] Unity of the visible Church it will be
[12:24] for he said so he said I will restore
[12:28] all the years Hallelujah that the korm
[12:31] and the Locust and the caterpillar and
[12:33] the Palmer have eaten off of my bride
[12:35] tree I'm going to restore bright up on
[12:37] this Earth before she goes out of here
[12:40] there going to be a visible Church
[12:42] Hallelujah there going to be Christ in
[12:44] that church brother is going to be here
[12:46] and so therefore it's according to God's
[12:48] word the word will come to its ress the
[12:51] church will and now it'll come you know
[12:54] why because Jesus Christ prayed it
[12:57] himself
[12:59] father I pray that they will be perfect
[13:01] in one amen if God himself spoke the
[13:06] seed of God and it went out and out and
[13:08] out and out there's got to be a seed
[13:11] here on the earth that will bring to
[13:14] pass and make manifest Jesus Christ's
[13:17] own prayer perfect in one hallu no
[13:20] matter what happens amen it Pope World
[13:24] Council Bishops this person's idea of
[13:27] what they think is going to to be one
[13:30] Perfect Bride Church on the earth amen
[13:34] for Jesus Christ prayed it yes he said I
[13:37] not only pray for these here who were a
[13:39] perfect Church who were going to be but
[13:40] I pray Al also for you today who who
[13:43] were going to believe on their restored
[13:45] back word amen he Jesus Christ prayed
[13:48] for us that we would be one amen amen
[13:53] that we would be made perfect in one
[13:55] that we would grow into this here he's
[13:58] already prayed for us than but he's but
[14:01] because he has a pattern and his pattern
[14:03] is as thou sent me so I sent send them
[14:09] so therefore we would if we examine the
[14:10] pattern then you have to be sent is that
[14:13] right other words we have to be sent the
[14:15] way he is sent and then he was sent with
[14:18] a life he was sent with signs one
[14:21] doesn't matter he was sent with
[14:22] authority and then therefore we cannot
[14:25] move until we are sent as he was sent
[14:29] the same way so Peter now Christ says as
[14:32] my father sent me so I send you he said
[14:34] but T you first until you be end do with
[14:37] power from on high amen and then when
[14:40] the power came and out they went as he
[14:42] went out they went out the same way and
[14:44] that is the pattern that pattern shall
[14:46] never change you have to be sent by
[14:49] Jesus Christ himself and we waiting for
[14:52] the voice of the Resurrection the voice
[14:55] of Christ of the Archangel to come down
[14:57] hallelujah amen and speak to us

[15:13] don't believe at
[15:14] there the faith Bank hasn't reached up
[15:16] high Yet brother you better believe it
[15:20] that's the pattern amen amen yes sir uh
[15:25] St John 17 my father sent me but vers 20
[15:29] here for us to believe on the word
[15:31] here's why the 22nd verse and the glory
[15:34] which thou gavest me I have given them
[15:37] that they may be W even as we are W the
[15:40] glory second Corinthians
[15:42] 3:18 even as by the spirit of the Lord
[15:46] as we look into his face we're changed
[15:48] from Glory from Luther glory to Westley
[15:52] glory to Pentecostal Glory To His Glory
[15:56] Hallelujah I have given them the glory
[15:59] yes you we have the glory the word of
[16:01] God itself in as we look into his face
[16:06] which is all the word of God we are
[16:08] changed even as by the spirit of the
[16:12] Lord amen we're being changed now
[16:15] friends praise our
[16:17] God now why is this that the world may
[16:21] know that he was sent by God and only
[16:25] when we are raised up in his power in
[16:28] his resurrection and his reality can the
[16:32] world know that truly God sent his
[16:36] son amen his son died at the cross and
[16:40] he was raised for our justification
[16:43] hallelujah praise our God but is at
[16:46] Calvary that we must die with him as he
[16:49] died the Son of God so must we the sons
[16:51] of God die also hallelujah amen we must
[16:55] take our corn of wheat yes and we have
[16:57] the corn of wheat the seven sealed
[17:00] message the corn of wheat in our heart
[17:02] take this corn of Wheat and fall into
[17:05] the ground and die fall into the ground
[17:07] of his word and die out to everything
[17:10] here and our lives will truly be hid
[17:13] with him Hallelujah in God Amen it'll be
[17:15] raised in his resurrection to carry on
[17:18] his work Hallelujah and it'll be able to
[17:19] say as my father sent me so I send you
[17:23] you'll go forth in his resurrection yes
[17:25] in his power Hallelujah in his glory
[17:29] yeah but you must be dead because he
[17:31] goes forth that's the thing and that's
[17:34] where we've been trying to get the
[17:35] people to die Hallelujah die to their
[17:38] own thinking die out to the world die
[17:41] out to you because our own ideas amen
[17:44] and let the same God that was in Jesus
[17:46] the Same God that was in the early
[17:48] church bring forth the manifestation of
[17:50] the word bride Hallelujah as was
[17:52] promised and that's our goal in St joh
[17:55] uh because Ephesians 4 here it says that
[17:58] we will come to the unity of this Faith
[18:00] this is our Earthly goal the image of
[18:03] Christ in mechanics now and Dynamics
[18:07] love the finishing touch I think it's
[18:10] over in Colossians 3 put on these eight
[18:12] things and finally put on charity the
[18:16] bond of perfectness the outside garment
[18:20] that binds it all together the Capstone
[18:22] the love of God the strength Giver to
[18:25] every virtue amen we have the word the
[18:28] word is virtue power but he is the
[18:31] strength of it amen he can make the
[18:34] virtue live he can make the patience
[18:37] really have patience amen he can he can
[18:40] he he can give you true knowledge amen
[18:43] godliness brotherly he can make it live
[18:45] all the fruit it'll live for the life
[18:48] that's in the vine will be in the
[18:50] branches make it live that is the cap
[18:53] what you're waiting for Hallelujah but
[18:56] prior to this time here you adding by
[18:59] faith in the word of
[19:00] God this is our Earthly goal friends the
[19:03] image of Jesus Christ what a calling
[19:05] Ephesians 4:1 I therefore the prisoner
[19:08] of the Lord isn't it wonderful to be his
[19:10] prisoner yes beseech you that ye walk
[19:13] worthy of the vocation wherewith you are
[19:16] called amen and that's why we preach the
[19:19] way we preach here you're not called to
[19:21] be a a a slopping around here in the
[19:23] world down here brother you called to be
[19:26] the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[19:29] that's why we and as a bride of Christ
[19:31] you are a queen Hallelujah then live
[19:34] like a queen walk like a queen talk like
[19:37] a queen we are his bride elect elected
[19:40] lady Hallelujah that's right praise but
[19:43] many of we don't know our
[19:45] calling brother Ram said this here on
[19:47] why Christ speak I think every I think
[19:49] any man woman boy a girl in the
[19:52] intellectual conception of what they
[19:54] think the word is and so forth can never
[19:57] have a full Foundation stand until they
[20:00] have met that light that brings the word
[20:04] to a reality we can sit in here and
[20:07] until you personally meet that light
[20:10] that I continually talking about here
[20:12] it'll just be knowledge that's all it'll
[20:14] be to you but I think no church in its
[20:17] practice no matter how intellectual and
[20:19] fundamental it might be that church
[20:22] cannot Thrive until the Supernatural is
[20:25] made known it's just dead that's all it
[20:27] is see among the people and they see it
[20:31] the people must see the supernatural
[20:33] moving through the congregation and
[20:35] that's how we've been able to thrive
[20:37] here on the Revelation that has moved
[20:39] through here cuz brother Braham said on
[20:42] the uh doing God service against his
[20:43] will when they see the things that's
[20:46] predicted happen saying thus saying the
[20:49] Lord and they can see it and they can
[20:51] talk back to it they can talk back to
[20:52] them Jesus Christ himself talk right
[20:55] back to you and you talk to him he talk
[20:57] right back see what are you doing over
[21:00] there stop that whatever it is call it
[21:02] right now he talks right back to you
[21:04] when they see that happening and then it
[21:06] comes to a reality then this word has
[21:09] gone forth is real to you sitting out
[21:11] here amen and when you come in here one
[21:13] day soon it'll be real to you amen
[21:15] praise God something that they can talk
[21:18] to that'll talk back to them that
[21:21] vindicates this written word some person
[21:25] supernatural being that's sitting down
[21:26] in here in form of a pillar of Fire
[21:29] and here's all the word written and it's
[21:31] spoken out there and he vindicates it
[21:33] and you see it happening and you know
[21:34] what's happening in here then brother
[21:36] amen praise God the voice of the
[21:38] Resurrection I'm speaking
[21:40] about and in the same vein he said this
[21:42] on page 14 that's what the world needs
[21:44] today and that's what the church needs
[21:46] today that's what everyone needs as Sons
[21:48] and Daughters of God in order to be that
[21:50] you you need a personal contact see you
[21:53] know God's word is true you know it's
[21:55] right but then when it contacts and then
[21:57] you see the thing then you know you're
[21:59] on the right Road amen that's the way
[22:02] it's got to be and then as we moving
[22:04] toward that time what has kept us this
[22:07] far is Faith in our hearts God placed in
[22:10] our hearts a faith seed and then come
[22:13] down himself and anointed that Faith
[22:15] seed Hallelujah the true bride that's
[22:18] sitting here this morning she believes
[22:20] in Ephesians 4:13 here till we all come
[22:23] in unity of the faith and the knowledge
[22:25] Son of God a perfect man she believes
[22:27] that true bride sitting here morning
[22:29] believe she is Jesus Christ bride amen
[22:32] she has no unbelief moving through her
[22:35] whatsoever could be maybe she is his
[22:38] bride amen for she has acted like she is

[38:11] doing what you're doing that's exactly
[38:14] right he's no respect of persons so you
[38:17] better check up Faith Knows by
[38:19] Revelation what God wants done in the
[38:21] meantime to reach that goal separation
[38:25] obedience Holiness p it and meanwhile
[38:29] When Faith begins to add that word what
[38:32] God wants it begins to become
[38:34] impregnated they laugh at
[38:36] you they mock they scarf look at you see
[38:41] in the tapes and this and that see the
[38:42] man they laughing at you you're trying
[38:44] to take every word and they
[38:46] laughing deonal ones a sister because
[38:49] try to look like a saint they they're
[38:51] calling women they'll laugh at her every
[38:53] time absolutely and the brother who's
[38:57] trying trying to to do what's right the
[38:59] call men will laugh at him laugh at
[39:01] every time there's two groups in the
[39:02] house of God see but nevertheless that
[39:05] bride material begins to apply the word
[39:08] begins to add to his faith begins to
[39:10] apply the word his life by faith St John
[39:14] 8:31 ye shall know the truth and the
[39:16] truth shall make you
[39:18] free that right now watch this the
[39:22] application of this truth will bring us
[39:24] freedom I said the application of this
[39:28] truth will bring us freedom now watch
[39:31] the knowledge of this truth alone will
[39:34] only bring us
[39:36] frustration now that's what's wrong in
[39:37] this message
[39:38] today the application brings Freedom
[39:41] you're free amen the Son of God the son
[39:44] of word the son of man makes You Free by
[39:46] the word you're not bound no more see
[39:49] but to know the
[39:51] tapes to know what happened with the
[39:54] cloud in 1963 to know the books to know
[39:58] what brother Bram or because because
[40:00] what he's done to know these things
[40:02] means nothing alone without the
[40:05] application of what he has sent to your
[40:08] personal everyday life that's right see
[40:13] and so therefore for some strange reason
[40:15] or reason they hesitate to apply it to
[40:17] their own hearts and
[40:19] lives rather than yield their lives to
[40:22] the full sway of Jesus Christ the whole
[40:24] word the whole message see allow him to
[40:27] dictate the policies and the purpose of
[40:30] their lives not just going when you feel
[40:32] like going to certain Affairs and so
[40:34] forth and the families and things did
[40:37] you ask Jesus Christ because should you
[40:39] go
[40:40] first that's having full swing asking
[40:44] the Lord first may I go is it all right
[40:46] for me to go amen amen I hope you can
[40:49] get it or just did before you say
[40:52] anything as rightous against somebody
[40:54] did that God's will say that there or do
[40:57] certain things because hurt people and
[40:59] so forth that God's will see therefore
[41:03] they Shuffle on through
[41:05] life sometimes up and sometimes
[41:09] down sometimes in disgust other times in
[41:12] in
[41:13] despair they become despondent and
[41:15] downhearted because they never are
[41:17] dependent upon Jesus Christ the word
[41:20] that's right see you must apply the word
[41:23] besides knowing the
[41:26] message there the knowledge of this
[41:28] message and there's the application of
[41:30] the
[41:31] truth there you can know the message and
[41:34] apply the truth and you can know the
[41:36] message and don't apply the truth and be
[41:38] an intellectual
[41:40] believer so therefore friends God has
[41:43] never stopped pouring out the Holy Ghost
[41:46] if you don't have the Holy Ghost you
[41:47] should be on your knees day and night
[41:50] asking God to to fill you with the Holy
[41:52] Ghost
[41:54] absolutely you should you wouldn't be
[41:55] around any old carnal a telephone
[41:57] conversation you'd be on your knees if
[42:00] you really knew what because Abraham
[42:01] knew but lot didn't know it see and
[42:05] there he was down there until till God
[42:07] come down the voice of the Archangel
[42:09] come on the Earth itself and pully

[42:26] the promises of God what light Malachi 4
[42:29] light amen Malachi 4 sharing light upon
[42:32] every promise and the faith seeds so it

[43:29] note here about because about the
[43:30] ministry here many seek to find out

[43:35] Minister seek to find out how many
[43:38] imperfections and carnal traits are

[43:46] religion but few seek to bring
[43:48] Christians to the height of the Gospel
[43:50] standard you got to live it first if you
[43:53] want to bring some up there the early

[54:19] ministry that's silly do I have to
[54:22] ground and say I'm Joe

[54:39] who I am amen if you're a daughter of

[54:56] that blood there for your
[54:58] mistakes oh the blood of Jesus it washes
[55:03] us white as snow huah the blood is for
[55:06] your
[55:08] mistakes but you believe every
[55:11] word there's your unbelief believe every
[55:14] word hallelujah that's why we cry out
[55:17] when that spirit moves through here
[55:19] there's no Holy Ghost you don't believe
[55:21] the word and they don't know it there's
[55:23] no more ministers you don't believe the
[55:25] word
[55:27] you make mistakes now but that's the
[55:29] blood is for that but you don't believe
[55:31] the word but then you're
[55:33] unbeliever and they can't get that there
[55:36] well law got to reveal it to them amen
[55:38] see now verse 12 here he gave some
[55:42] Apostles and Prophets and pastors teach
[55:44] now they're only a means toward an end
[55:47] now see and God's intentions here was
[55:50] three things here that they would per it
[55:53] was for the perfecting of the Saints for
[55:55] the work of the one Ministry for the
[55:57] edifying of the body uh edifying the
[56:01] body of
[56:03] Christ excuse me and I begin to read
[56:06] this here and then begin to open up it
[56:08] was for the perfecting the five for
[56:11] minist started on the day of Pentecost
[56:13] and was to go all the way down through
[56:14] to I now and it's for three things here
[56:17] for the perfecting for the full
[56:19] equipping of the Saints to equip the
[56:22] saints of God with the word and for the
[56:24] work of the ministry of course because
[56:26] because evangelists and missionaries and
[56:28] so forth see but it was to properly
[56:30] equip the saints of God for service so
[56:33] the word is preach to tell you how to be
[56:36] in service with God tell the women how
[56:38] to be in service tell the men how to be
[56:40] in service tell the children how to be
[56:42] in service so the fire for Ministry is
[56:44] for that intention to bring God's word
[56:47] to you to tell you how to be in service
[56:49] and then when you do what's in the Bible
[56:50] then you you in God's service amen
[56:53] praise the Lord therefore it was forth
[56:56] to build up the body see now watch verse
[56:59] 13 here till we all come in unity of the
[57:02] faith other words the five for minut was
[57:04] to be here all down through arenius
[57:07] polycarp Columba St Martin and then down
[57:11] to Luther and then the the cor went down
[57:13] in the ground then come up a blade it
[57:16] was to be here till it
[57:18] developed and the blade had to develop
[57:21] the the tassel the sh still develop in
[57:24] the 5 minutes is still here on till
[57:26] verse 13 till we come into the unity of
[57:28] the faith and they didn't have it they
[57:30] had all kind of streams out so then
[57:32] verse 13 you needed Malachi 4 to bring
[57:37] back the faith you needed Malachi 4 to
[57:41] give you a knowledge of the Son of God
[57:43] through the Seven Seals because we had
[57:46] knowledge Through The Bishop's idea and
[57:48] the church's idea so verse 13 here had
[57:50] to be here until Malachi 4 come forward
[57:53] to bring us back to this Unity of the
[57:55] with the word word to give us a a a a
[57:58] seven sealed knowledge of the Son of God
[58:01] his Mysteries his secrets and then this
[58:04] in itself will bring you to a perfect
[58:07] man and the perfect man is the measure
[58:11] amen of the fullness of Jesus Christ for
[58:13] the bride amen amen so we see it then
[58:16] until we attain this Oneness here the
[58:19] ministry was a build up or develop the
[58:21] body until it come on down here until we
[58:24] will arrive at real maturity
[58:26] and then uh uh what is the real purpose
[58:29] so when you get to this real maturity
[58:30] like right now that you'll be no more
[58:33] toss to and fro like children verse 14
[58:36] for the past eight years they've been
[58:38] running out to Arizona down to Florida
[58:40] over here up and down TOS to and fro
[58:42] they don't even know what's even going
[58:43] on see the me now but when they would
[58:46] come to maturity and in Christ the
[58:49] campstone would come down and then speak
[58:52] the truth in love and point every soul
[58:55] into Jesus Christ
[58:56] and then each joint with the proper
[58:59] function in there with the Holy Ghost
[59:01] upon them would edify one another and
[59:04] grow up into him in every way he is the
[59:06] head amen amen praise God Hall so then
[59:10] uh and and there would be no more tossed
[59:12] to and fro and carried about with every
[59:14] wind of Doctrine and with the slay of
[59:16] men now this word here slay of men means
[59:18] uh has to do with cubes and cubes is
[59:21] Dice that's right and it says here
[59:24] because I saw in the Greek they said
[59:25] that the dice are loaded and these men
[59:27] would walk into the church with loaded
[59:30] Dice and throw it out and you can't win
[59:34] you all know that how can you win
[59:36] against loaded dice well how can you win
[59:40] against an antichrist who comes in with
[59:42] loaded Dice and comes in preaching the
[59:45] message but when it comes out it's
[59:47] twisted off so if if they fool around
[59:50] with loaded dice they can't win if you
[59:52] fooled around with these doctrines these
[59:54] ideas go out here and do this here no
[59:57] more this no more that you can't
[1:00:00] win cuz it's the Slayer man's
[1:00:03] hand amen praise the Lord I hope you see
[1:00:07] it and that's why we belt you out and
[1:00:11] nail you to the wall tell you to get
[1:00:13] away from there that's right don't you
[1:00:15] know about sheep when a sheep eats the
[1:00:17] wrong food because it stomach blows
[1:00:20] up and the shepherd must take a knife
[1:00:22] and stick it into his
[1:00:24] gut and let out the gas that's
[1:00:32] right so sometimes some get the wrong
[1:00:34] food so we take that knife and RAM it in
[1:00:40] there no more no more H go how it
[1:00:44] ghost
[1:00:46] amen now this is true you know amen the
[1:00:49] sheep eat wrong food and it they they
[1:00:52] blow up for gas and the shepherd
[1:00:54] actually takes a knife and sticks it in
[1:00:57] their stomach and it lets the ear
[1:01:00] out that's how all the gas I mean TI I
[1:01:03] mean amen praise all God that's right
[1:01:06] see so
[1:01:08] therefore the bride is to come to
[1:01:12] maturity that they won't be tossed no
[1:01:14] more to and fro and deceived by these
[1:01:16] guys and
[1:01:19] brother brother Hunt knows we got some
[1:01:21] things that is is deceit as very likely
[1:01:23] if possible in this message that's right
[1:01:25] so we finally won't be no more children
[1:01:27] so therefore the real purpose God has
[1:01:30] promised to send the Dynamics and the
[1:01:32] mechanic we would be no more children
[1:01:35] you see it now therefore we will come
[1:01:37] and then the truth will go forth in love
[1:01:40] for only through love can you be built
[1:01:43] up and
[1:01:44] edified so therefore we other words it's
[1:01:47] like um to me it comes to me like this
[1:01:49] here uh cuz you women wash clothes you
[1:01:52] got to wash the clothes in full of soap
[1:01:55] ring them out amen washing of the Water
[1:01:57] by the word that right and then when you
[1:02:00] hang them up to dry and dry out the went
[1:02:04] so therefore you've been Washed by the
[1:02:07] Water of the word and now it's time to
[1:02:09] hang out to wash in the Sun out there
[1:02:12] amen let it dry out now amen praise the
[1:02:16] Lord we've been Washed by the Water of
[1:02:18] the word and now it's time that full
[1:02:21] powerful sun to come down and dry us out
[1:02:24] by every word amen amen praise the Lord
[1:02:27] page 363 uh uh uh uh 7 Church age says
[1:02:31] this a bride will mature and her
[1:02:34] ripeness shall be an identification with
[1:02:36] her Lord by means of the word Colossians
[1:02:40] 3:14 said that finally put on charity
[1:02:43] which is the Capstone and the Capstone
[1:02:46] is the strength of every virtue and we
[1:02:48] have we can't move without and charity
[1:02:51] never
[1:02:52] faileth we fail and make mistakes until
[1:02:55] charity he comes did you get
[1:02:58] it so if you want hang around what I did
[1:03:02] yesterday I feel sorry for you cuz until
[1:03:05] charity comes forth that anointing in
[1:03:08] his fullness the measure the perfect man
[1:03:11] amen and anoint you with that fullness
[1:03:14] you will make mistakes amen because but
[1:03:17] charity never
[1:03:19] faileth this time you'll do nothing
[1:03:23] except your father show you amen
[1:03:25] therefore you can't make a mistake if
[1:03:27] the father comes down and shows you a
[1:03:29] step and you step in it and you stand
[1:03:31] until you have thus saith the Lord
[1:03:34] Brother Bram said on be certain of God I
[1:03:35] think it was page 17 he said that the
[1:03:38] widow woman turn and bake me a cake
[1:03:40] first and she turned in obedience he
[1:03:42] said every man every woman loves to hear
[1:03:44] the thunder of God from the the
[1:03:47] prophet's mouth and the Thunder of God
[1:03:49] is thus sayith the Lord so the voice of
[1:03:52] God is coming forward thus sayith the
[1:03:54] Lord the Thunder of God Amen amen praise
[1:03:57] our God so now this happened here this
[1:04:00] Oneness here that we would be no more
[1:04:02] children we're not meant to remain as
[1:04:04] children see and we and we are meant to
[1:04:07] hold firmly to the truth in Love Got To
[1:04:10] Be In Love now and grow up in every way
[1:04:14] into Christ ahead and that's what he
[1:04:16] said on on the six hour tape on the
[1:04:19] prophecy there that when he gets a
[1:04:20] virgin bride in her thinking Amen in her
[1:04:23] thinking see no other seed laying in in
[1:04:26] in the womb but Christ then he'll take
[1:04:29] that a bride and he'll bring the
[1:04:31] manifestation of the word right through
[1:04:33] her womb and the world will see Jesus
[1:04:35] Christ in spiritual form again the word
[1:04:38] made flesh and it'll be every word so
[1:04:40] therefore we only come to the point now
[1:04:43] where we are ready to be
[1:04:44] used we are ready to be made manifest as
[1:04:48] the word and then the word goes forward
[1:04:52] as my father sent me so I send you my
[1:04:54] word amen and then the word goes forward
[1:04:58] drying out ripening to every word that
[1:05:01] he shows the bride and then she becomes
[1:05:04] the word in the resurrection for the
[1:05:07] Resurrection comes forward himself Jesus
[1:05:09] Christ and and the dead in Christ and he
[1:05:12] said I am the resurrection in the bride
[1:05:15] in the resurrection and I am the life
[1:05:18] amen so you the word that is living is
[1:05:20] walking into the resurrection and

[1:06:10] faith the bride saw the word be made
[1:06:13] manifest through all the political
[1:06:15] things the Natural Things the filthiness

[1:10:57] here praise God
[1:10:59] Amen brother brandham now I just talk to
[1:11:03] you a little bit a little ice
[1:11:05] cream brother Brandon 1955 around about
[1:11:09] October he had a tent Vision which was
[1:11:12] the word of the Lord and I always
[1:11:14] believe that the tent Vision was the uh
[1:11:17] symbol for the third pool because each
[1:11:21] seal there had a symbol a white horse
[1:11:23] rider went forward symbol form a red
[1:11:25] horse W the symbol form see the Jews on
[1:11:27] be up on the alt symbol form see and
[1:11:29] when he opened the Sixth Seal all the
[1:11:30] symol form see but there was nothing for
[1:11:33] the seventh seal but I believe this was
[1:11:35] a symbol right here the attent vision
[1:11:38] see in symbol form see and it's thus
[1:11:40] saith the Lord see now that came to him
[1:11:43] about October 55 somewhere through there
[1:11:46] when he just finished up and uh they ran
[1:11:48] into the red because in the meeting in
[1:11:50] the second pool there and God was
[1:11:52] finishing up so then now he had to wait
[1:11:55] he knew it was coming to pass with the
[1:11:57] squirrels and because assister had right
[1:11:59] and all these things he had to wait and
[1:12:02] December
[1:12:03] 1962 was over seven full years in a
[1:12:07] month or so seven years he had to wait 7
[1:12:11] years he had to ripen are you following
[1:12:14] me now the Malachi for seed was in him
[1:12:17] the tent Vision came to him the word of
[1:12:19] the Lord came to him but he had to wait
[1:12:22] and ripen for seven full years and about
[1:12:27] December 62 he was picked up of course
[1:12:30] right there in his home and seven angels
[1:12:31] came to him then he went out to Arizona
[1:12:33] in February and so forth 63 and the
[1:12:36] cloud came in February and the sword
[1:12:38] came into his hand this was in the
[1:12:40] eighth year and then he opened the Seven
[1:12:42] Seals in the eighth year and then he was
[1:12:43] still drying out drying out moving
[1:12:47] around waiting why could I speak the
[1:12:49] Third Exodus and all and the token and
[1:12:52] so forth still waiting then he said
[1:12:54] himself in December 63 he said the book
[1:12:57] is open the seven seal book just waiting
[1:13:00] for the the seven seal Christ The Sword
[1:13:03] to be identified to his coming and then
[1:13:06] one day in June 64 he said the unveiling
[1:13:09] the Mighty God so all in all between 55
[1:13:12] around about October to about December
[1:13:15] or 65 was about 10 years and one or two
[1:13:18] months all that time uh ripening and
[1:13:21] drying out and Christ was made manifest
[1:13:24] through God's Prophet well since 1963
[1:13:27] the bride
[1:13:29] March up to now this is the eighth year
[1:13:32] we're ready to move into the ninth year
[1:13:34] in March 63 we've been also drying out
[1:13:37] and ripening same thing for the Seven
[1:13:40] Seals Vision came to us in March 63 and
[1:13:43] we know it's right and we know it has to
[1:13:45] do with the bribe but you had to wait
[1:13:47] for it just like he had to wait had to
[1:13:49] dry out all these years ripen all and
[1:13:52] believe the word of God and now and
[1:13:55] strange as it may seem I don't say it
[1:13:57] because it's got to happen I don't know
[1:13:59] when the r should be I don't know I
[1:14:00] ain't set any dates but if it should go
[1:14:03] to about March or April 73 it would be
[1:14:07] exactly 10 years also if it should go I
[1:14:10] don't know it because they don't have to
[1:14:11] go that far see because we know that the
[1:14:14] uh uh uh the bridegroom is given at
[1:14:16] least one year to be with his bride in
[1:14:20] the Old Testament because D because
[1:14:22] Deuteronomy at the wedding supper and so
[1:14:24] forth absolutely so we don't know we at
[1:14:26] any time but I'm only trying to bring
[1:14:29] something to you you understand now how
[1:14:32] close are we now um
[1:14:37] 1968 uh April 68 president johnon on
[1:14:41] March 34 31st he announced on TV and
[1:14:46] radio that he would not seek
[1:14:49] reelection for the presidential office
[1:14:53] and it shook up everybody the whole
[1:14:54] world and and then on April the 1st that
[1:14:56] was in the newspapers well from all of
[1:14:59] us know from April the 1st
[1:15:01] 1968 every kind of a natural seed was
[1:15:06] sold in ' 68 even right on down to the
[1:15:09] Vietnam peace SE seed in December 68
[1:15:13] everyone was sold all you know that
[1:15:15] natural the church everything else and
[1:15:17] so forth then
[1:15:20] 1969 came forth this a rightness of of
[1:15:25] natural seeds science reached its
[1:15:29] climax they went to the
[1:15:32] moon is that right they went to the moon
[1:15:35] they reached a ripeness a maturity and
[1:15:38] then they went to the moon the sodomites
[1:15:40] and the Manson murder and Woodstock
[1:15:43] reached their maturity they can't get
[1:15:45] any more wicked they reached their op
[1:15:48] Pinnacle in 1969 the sodomite spirit and
[1:15:52] all you know that and this this case is
[1:15:55] still going on see because has reached
[1:15:56] it already and even uh these singers I
[1:15:59] think one was Janice Joplin and uh I
[1:16:02] think because Hendricks both of them
[1:16:04] within maybe a week and a half apart
[1:16:06] they were gone they're finished with
[1:16:09] other words that spirit that started
[1:16:10] back in the 60s has come to its
[1:16:13] rightness its maturity it's here now we
[1:16:16] see it you accept it is that right and
[1:16:19] and but 69 brought forth a rightness the
[1:16:22] Harvest comes in the tribulation period
[1:16:25] but it's right and the tears and the
[1:16:27] wicked ripen first that's right see okay
[1:16:31] SS sodomites a religion the purpose of
[1:16:35] the Pope and the World Council came to
[1:16:37] its rightness in June 1969 in Geneva
[1:16:41] Switzerland when the pope went and sat
[1:16:43] down with the World Council of churches
[1:16:45] headquarters and he spoke there is that
[1:16:48] right and he also came to right with
[1:16:50] labor for about a week later labor was
[1:16:53] there also having a big worldwide a
[1:16:56] convention and he spoke there also see
[1:17:00] and of course this one in

[1:17:11] about man's intellect is science man's
[1:17:14] body is sports that right so therefore
[1:17:17] the greatest uh Sports achievement in

[1:17:46] leveling off just waiting that's all
[1:17:48] waiting for the fires of God's Wrath

[1:23:09] it's a spirit as in the world and the
[1:23:12] only way it can stop it is you live a
[1:23:14] Sanctified life and still you're

[1:28:45] gleaning time here stubble the gospel
[1:28:48] was to go out friends that's what God
[1:28:50] thought about America here and this has
[1:28:52] been the hardest time to preach to these
[1:28:54] past eight years to to to to bring it to
[1:28:57] that Bride for the intellectual spirit
[1:28:59] that fought every inch of the way that
[1:29:02] just wanted to know about the tapes and
[1:29:04] so forth um and if you don't have the
[1:29:07] Holy Ghost I tell you with all that's
[1:29:09] within me you seek God to you are filled
[1:29:11] with the Holy Ghost just don't take a
[1:29:13] dry
[1:29:15] interpretation you meet that light you
[1:29:18] better be certain of God do you hear
[1:29:20] what he said here he said the next thing
[1:29:22] we'll be getting that little group
[1:29:23] together and a month or so that's
[1:29:25] exactly what he told Billy Paul and per
[1:29:27] green he said that it'll be up on the
[1:29:28] earth for about a month or so that
[1:29:31] Resurrection the dead in Christ will
[1:29:33] walk this Earth for about a month or so
[1:29:36] getting together in groups oh praise God
[1:29:41] just getting together as the song says I
[1:29:44] got an uncle over there I got an aunt
[1:29:47] over there I got a brother over there
[1:29:49] praise our God getting together and
[1:29:52] brother Bram said this here that Jesus
[1:29:54] Christ and his wisdom wouldn't as we are
[1:29:57] gathered together wouldn't let us go
[1:29:59] without being gathered together in
[1:30:00] families in groups so he'll gather the
[1:30:03] family in groups in about a month or so
[1:30:05] they'll be gathered together amen and
[1:30:07] then it come a blast out of the sky come
[1:30:10] on up praise God hallelujah what an hour
[1:30:12] don't miss it I cry out to you this
[1:30:15] morning from 12 years old about that and
[1:30:18] up don't you miss it don't you think
[1:30:21] because you're 14 or 15 that you don't
[1:30:24] have to do God is holding you
[1:30:26] accountable for every word of God in
[1:30:27] this church here you and all you young
[1:30:30] children here every single last one of
[1:30:32] you so if you want to live in the world
[1:30:34] well you go ahead and live in the world
[1:30:35] but therefore you know where you're
[1:30:37] walking you know exactly where you're
[1:30:39] walking today so therefore husband and
[1:30:43] wives and elders and deacons and
[1:30:44] everybody else the hour is short we're
[1:30:47] right here it's got to go out of here I
[1:30:49] believe before 73 and it don't have to
[1:30:52] go that long so therefore how much time
[1:30:54] is left and that's why I'm preaching
[1:30:57] with all my heart the way I am amen so I
[1:31:00] trust and pray that you are or the bride
[1:31:02] that want to be made perfect in one not
[1:31:05] some phony business coming and sitting
[1:31:07] here doesn't mean nothing it's what you
[1:31:09] do in your home and out the street that
[1:31:11] don't you can you can because here and
[1:31:13] because impersonate Hallelujah your
[1:31:15] because all your hair is down your dress
[1:31:17] is down I don't mean nothing what's in
[1:31:19] that hard and then get on the telephone
[1:31:21] and talk against one another and so
[1:31:23] forth you prove it right and God he
[1:31:25] watches that there we just look at the
[1:31:27] flesh here but God look at the spirit in
[1:31:29] the heart so therefore sanctify yourself
[1:31:32] you don't need no man to tell you that
[1:31:33] you're supposed to go and make things
[1:31:35] right you know what the very fact if you
[1:31:38] on the telephone or doing these things
[1:31:39] wrong is against God you know it's wrong
[1:31:43] therefore go and make a real repentance
[1:31:45] and so forth see but the hour is close
[1:31:48] friends so I trust and pray you
[1:31:50] understand this morning's message amen
[1:31:52] try to bring to you the reality of the
[1:31:55] time we're living in the night is far
[1:31:56] spent the day is at hand let us cast off
[1:31:59] the works of darkness and if there's
[1:32:01] something that we need to say is wrong
[1:32:03] we'll say it's wrong otherwise God has
[1:32:05] not even received it shall We
[1:32:11] Stand praise our God Amen Let Us bow our
[1:32:15] heads in a word of Prayer
