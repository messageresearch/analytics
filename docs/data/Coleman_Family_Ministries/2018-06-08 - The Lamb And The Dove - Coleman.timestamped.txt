[0:09] first chapter the first epistle of John
[0:17] that which was from the beginning which
[0:19] we have heard which we have seen with
[0:22] our eyes which we have looked upon and
[0:24] our hands have handle of the word of
[0:27] life for the life was manifested and we
[0:29] have seen it and bear witness and show
[0:31] it showing to you that eternal life

[0:39] seen and heard declare we unto you that

[0:47] and with his son Jesus Christ and these
[0:50] things right we unto you that your joy
[0:52] may be full
[0:54] this then is the message which we have
[0:56] heard of him and declare unto you that
[0:59] God is light and in him is no darkness
[1:02] at all if we say that we have fellowship
[1:04] with him and walk in darkness we lie and
[1:06] do not the truth but if we walk in the
[1:09] light as he is in the light we have
[1:11] fellowship one with another and the
[1:13] blood of Jesus Christ in His Son
[1:15] cleanses us from all sin if we say that
[1:17] we have no sin we deceive ourselves and
[1:21] the truth is not in us if we confess our
[1:23] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[1:26] us our sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:29] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[1:33] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[1:35] word is not in us brother we got him on
[1:39] the run the word is going forth now
[1:41] here's the way he got you tied up in the
[1:44] ninth verse if we confess our sins he
[1:47] won't let you do it there that's where
[1:51] you are right there and he's going out
[1:53] of here and he's here tonight but he's
[1:55] going out he knows where I'm going
[1:58] tonight he knows that he's got to go out
[2:00] the door he knows that God's gonna put
[2:03] you in a position to receive the Holy
[2:05] Ghost and he don't want you to know how
[2:08] to receive the Holy Ghost but we got the
[2:11] word of the Lord
[2:12] and the Holy Spirit come for the Sheep
[2:15] to bless you now God can't lie he's an
[2:18] already put a blessing up on you last

[2:32] battle don't you you should know that
[2:34] well then you but then you you get to
[2:36] you go to getting in the Spirit of God
[2:38] in the Word of God that's that funny
[2:40] feeling leave if we say that we have not
[2:42] sinned we make him a liar and his word
[2:45] is not in us Philippians 2 I'm so
[2:49] positive that God is going to fall in
[2:52] here tonight I'm not even thinking about
[2:54] it not even oh it don't even enter

[3:02] amen
[3:03] Philippians the second chapter if there
[3:06] if there be therefore any consolation in
[3:08] Christ if any comfort of love if any
[3:11] fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels
[3:13] and mercies fulfill you my joy that ye
[3:16] be like-minded having the same love
[3:18] being of one Accord of one mind let
[3:21] nothing be done through strife or
[3:23] vainglory but in lowliness of mind let
[3:25] each esteem other better than themselves
[3:27] look not every man on his own things but
[3:30] every man also on the things of others
[3:32] let this mind be in you which was also
[3:34] in Christ Jesus who being a form of God
[3:37] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[3:39] God but made himself of no reputation
[3:41] took upon him the form of a servant and
[3:43] was made in the likeness of men and
[3:45] being found in fashion as a man he
[3:48] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[3:51] death even the death of the cross may we
[3:54] bow our heads for word of Prayer
[3:55] our Heavenly Father we read your word
[3:56] now in God we are trying to move into
[3:59] position for the fire to fall upon us
[4:02] and that's the faith bank and the
[4:04] enemies fighting Lord but Heavenly

[5:56] this is a gun in simplicity I don't want
[5:59] to speak tonight like I spoke Sunday

[6:05] and lastly Matt or I can just stay up
[6:07] there and you could pull in this pull it
[6:09] out I coming tonight
[6:11] praise the Lord now we're back where we
[6:13] were Sunday night Amen by faith amen
[6:16] page 34 now this is speaking about
[6:20] Elijah how he humbled
[6:22] self now this is the key so zero in on
[6:25] the word humility notice you'd larger
[6:28] Holman himself and stayed with what God
[6:30] said in such a way that it pleased God
[6:34] to take the same spirit from Elijah and
[6:37] promised to shove it it three times down
[6:40] the road from there and he did it
[6:43] excuse me God love that spirit I was
[6:47] upon that simple uneducated woodsman
[6:49] from back there in the woods somewhere
[6:51] he was it was so obedient to his word
[6:55] she to me now so large it was so
[6:57] obedient to his word that he could say
[7:00] Elijah do this Elijah would do it can
[7:03] you say tonight my child stop doing this
[7:06] and you'll do it there's where your
[7:10] missing God right there when you don't
[7:12] do it when he tells you to do it through
[7:14] the pulpit and the message for Sunday
[7:16] morning when it comes and Elijah would
[7:18] do it all Roger did it he said I'll
[7:23] never leave you nor forsake you even
[7:25] just something as simple as killing an
[7:27] animal that's how beating it was to keep
[7:30] the word there's the blessing lain in
[7:33] there and that's why I'm trying to get
[7:35] you tonight so you can get the blessing
[7:38] it was obedient to his word that he
[7:41] would say Elijah do this and I just
[7:43] would do it and God hid himself in there
[7:45] in such simplicity till the all tall and
[7:48] that old crank don't have nothing to do
[7:51] with him and so for they call you cranky
[7:54] when you're being obedient to the word
[7:55] you mean you no brother no love but one
[8:00] day when he got ahold of his ol you got
[8:02] it he got old in his bald head and his
[8:05] whiskers hanging down gray what few
[8:07] hears he had hanging over his shoulder
[8:09] his little skinny arms and meat flopping
[8:10] on him like that come walking down that
[8:12] road to Samara and her eyes looking up
[8:15] to the sky with a Crooked Stick in his
[8:17] hand he wasn't much to look at but he
[8:18] had thus saith the Lord
[8:20] he didn't stammer with it he didn't
[8:22] stutter he didn't say now great Ahab he
[8:25] walked up and said not even a do will
[8:27] fall from him until I call for it God
[8:29] had honored his simplicity
[8:32] now you see while it was in the simple
[8:36] way and everybody against him everybody
[8:39] was at his throat all the Ministerial
[8:42] Association everything else would at his
[8:43] throat that's true trying to get rid of
[8:45] him and everything else but in that
[8:47] simplicity even though they had no
[8:49] cooperation with his campaigns and
[8:51] whatever more they had everybody thought
[8:53] he was a crank God was hiding himself
[8:56] but when he could now here it is but
[8:58] when you come time for that seed to get
[9:00] ripe that had been planted God
[9:04] manifested himself by sending fire out
[9:06] of the heavens and licking God hiding in
[9:09] simplicity and then reveal himself again
[9:11] short please got to do it he always he
[9:14] always did it in such a way did you hear
[9:17] what I said
[9:18] but when it come time for the seed to
[9:20] get right
[9:21] just think a seed has been planted in
[9:24] you for eight years
[9:25] oh is it the ninth year time for that
[9:28] see to be ripe if it is it says here God
[9:33] sent fire out of the heavens hiding for
[9:36] eight years in simplicity no sensations
[9:40] nothing no goosey feelings nothing
[9:43] happened just simplicity going to church
[9:45] taking the word and might have seen dry
[9:48] but that's all right
[9:49] simplicity no great campaigns and
[9:53] spectacular is going on but waiting for
[9:56] the one great spectacular hey man that's
[9:59] gonna smother all the rest of them out
[10:00] no one down in your heart was beating in
[10:03] Edit God set it in God's gonna do it a
[10:06] minute I don't care how it takes 25
[10:08] years like Abraham what God is going to
[10:12] do it I don't care if the old go against
[10:15] me speak against me don't even give us a
[10:18] telephone call and tell about the
[10:19] service or what-have-you but God is
[10:21] going to do it therefore what is here's
[10:25] God's pattern tonight

[10:30] simplicity of the word the very word

[15:07] of this hour in the evening light
[15:09] showing forth delight praise God what
[15:13] our excitation to us to believe the Word
[15:16] of God now one of the first John 1:7 I
[15:21] want to strength to scripture here for a
[15:23] minute yes sir
[15:26] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[15:31] the light we have fellowship one with
[15:35] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[15:38] His Son cleanses us from all sin now if
[15:44] we say we have no sin we deceive
[15:46] ourselves and the truth is not in us if
[15:48] we confess our sins he is faithful and
[15:52] just to forgive us our sins and to
[15:54] cleanse us from all unrighteousness if
[15:57] we say we have not sinned we make him a
[15:59] liar and his word is not in us now verse
[16:03] 8 through 10 he explains about walking
[16:05] in the light now all things are made
[16:07] manifest by the light now listen the
[16:10] presence of God the presence of God
[16:13] which is the word this word in it that's
[16:16] been hiding in us is the presence of God
[16:20] at you don't feel it there's a feeling
[16:24] God is in the word when you receive the
[16:27] word without sensation you receiving the
[16:29] person of Christ praise the Lord now the
[16:35] presence of God which is the word see
[16:38] brings a consciousness of sin in the
[16:41] nature did if you put the shade down the
[16:45] prison of God can't come in and show you
[16:47] the sin that he can cleanse you and
[16:51] there's your trouble then when you're
[16:53] scared to come to me it's not you afraid
[16:56] of me it's the spirits upon you that
[16:59] know how call those spirits out so that
[17:02] you might be free and they know that
[17:05] when they trouble me see it again it's
[17:14] the spirits on the people that don't
[17:17] want to come into the presence of God of
[17:18] a man that has faith in it we'll call
[17:20] those spirits out by the word they don't
[17:25] wanna get free the spirit solar tube
[17:27] free because he whom the Son of Man sets
[17:31] free is free indeed and we all set in
[17:35] heavenly places can you imagine somebody
[17:38] heavenly place up there with the angels
[17:40] and the four beasts around the throne
[17:42] all scared and when you're like this
[17:44] this shouting and praising God
[17:48] and running around is scared to speak to
[17:50] brother Paul and scare speaker brother
[17:52] brown kind of Fugees are that so wrong
[17:55] something wrong somewhere and if we are
[17:58] sitting in heavenly places your favorite
[18:00] speak to me
[18:01] how can it be let's lay it there now
[18:05] this is Wednesday night let's lay that
[18:07] thing down later on somehow some way
[18:12] must be some spirits upon you I will say
[18:15] a plane is there some Devils upon you
[18:18] absolutely what it is if your frame
[18:22] shouldn't be afraid well thank god
[18:24] this man will tell me I'd be afraid of
[18:28] the man wouldn't tell me and so be a
[18:30] pastor he'd be a phony be looking for a
[18:36] mullah yes sister she's all full of sin
[18:41] your lovely sister you're very sweet
[18:44] see brother my the presence of God
[18:49] brings the consciousness of sin in the
[18:52] nature in the presence of God he's in
[18:53] his word God hiding in his word then if
[18:57] the man will do like in the absolute
[18:58] bring the people on the condition of the
[19:01] what the presence of Almighty God and in
[19:05] their free praise the Lord
[19:07] now if you say you ain't got no sin like
[19:11] the Pharisee Laura I thank God I had
[19:15] daddy like that man the Pharisee stented
[19:19] beating his breast you finally know he
[19:21] didn't even know that he had sin on him
[19:23] you see therefore then the verse 9 and
[19:26] 10 makes him a liar so we had no sin
[19:28] because we lie we and we deceive
[19:31] themselves you see now sin and sins the
[19:37] blood of Jesus Christ is deep divine
[19:39] provision for both of them now to walk
[19:42] in the light is to live in fellowship
[19:46] with the father and the son that's
[19:49] walking in the light sin which is
[19:52] unbelief interrupts but confession
[19:56] restores that fellowship
[19:58] then if the minister comes around and
[20:01] God sees a few little lambs tramped
[20:03] brings up methods out like tonight to
[20:05] get the presence of God to them and they
[20:08] back up and go downstairs and full
[20:11] fidget around our heart that you have no
[20:12] fellowship and you missed your chance
[20:14] for fellowship that night through the
[20:16] Word of God and for God is the word see
[20:21] then immediate confession keeps the
[20:24] fellowship unbroken
[20:26] I mean God loves you he knows you can't
[20:33] do it how can we do it so he has a blood
[20:38] atonement foot but he can't get the
[20:39] blood to you if you pull the shade down
[20:42] and hide like Eve did that right did Eve
[20:47] sin and Adam Adam Adam where heart down
[20:51] looking all over for him tonight same
[20:54] thing we are now looking for you and
[20:57] they hidin did something wrong see and
[21:03] then a devil take it and Mount Sinai and
[21:05] whip you good there and yes sorry yeah
[21:10] I'll tear you up
[21:11] next thing you because you get up on
[21:13] your wife and your family or she get up
[21:15] on her husband go on a job you're mad
[21:17] and grouchy God don't love you no more
[21:19] this is wrong and begin to rip intense
[21:21] snort see and all you have to do is
[21:25] Jesus standing there bleeding wait the
[21:28] blood is dripping waiting for you and he
[21:31] don't bring it up to you either if he
[21:35] can only get you here though praise the
[21:37] Lord in the old Tabernacle there were
[21:41] two lights what we call two compartments
[21:44] you all know it the holy place with the
[21:46] shewbread and the candlestick and the
[21:48] most holy place the Shekinah glory the
[21:51] manifested glory of God was the Shekinah
[21:54] glory now these two places are now on
[21:56] one Accord in the same method 27 for God
[21:59] rent the Veil the veil being the type of
[22:01] Jesus Christ body of his human body
[22:03] rather in rendering in it signifying a
[22:05] new and living way was open for all
[22:08] verse we could go be into the inner
[22:11] inner court sanctum in there and into
[22:15] open for all believers to come into the
[22:18] very presence of God with no other
[22:20] sacrifice nor the priesthood just Jesus
[22:23] Christ and to his very presence which is
[22:26] the Shekinah glory the manifested glory
[22:29] of God is the word in season now there's
[22:33] still two lights today but they're one
[22:35] and here's what they're doing Christ the
[22:37] light of life through the spirit through
[22:40] the seven churches he gives like the
[22:43] candlestick throws light upon the
[22:44] message for each age you see and the
[22:47] people are drawn to the lane
[22:48] see on the holy things of God the
[22:50] shewbread the word and the altar
[22:53] instance prayer and so forth see and but
[22:56] then also any change as he throws out
[22:58] the message there he beckons the bride
[23:01] to come and live in that light where he
[23:05] said in the word and the others won't
[23:08] come to the word they come around the
[23:10] word you know same with me now see but
[23:13] they won't come to the word itself and
[23:16] the manifested Shekinah glory is now
[23:18] shining on the face of Jesus Christ and
[23:21] that's his word now into this twofold
[23:23] light we are as believers we abroad and
[23:27] Peter's told about into this marvelous
[23:29] life they wish you come to show forth
[23:31] the the maulvis praises of God amen now
[23:34] we walk in the light which merely he
[23:37] gives in every each by the message and
[23:40] so forth into this first folate carnal
[23:43] believers see put their own
[23:46] interpretation to the late see and then
[23:49] they take what they want they do what
[23:50] they want to add or take away these
[23:53] corner believers and they go into sin
[23:56] after they do it did it in every age and
[23:59] the light came melikhaya for God took
[24:01] him off the scene then come to force and
[24:03] onehans and show them false lights and
[24:06] they misinterpret the real light and God
[24:09] give them eight years now and they all
[24:11] dried up but during the eight years in
[24:14] simplicity the word itself God gave the
[24:18] bride
[24:19] chance to dwell and live in the light
[24:22] where he is everywhere no interpretation
[24:27] just whatever he's doing and then in
[24:30] there we have fellowship one with
[24:34] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[24:38] cleanses from all sin knows the groups
[24:42] where there's no more passes and no more
[24:44] Holy Ghost and all these cuckoo things
[24:46] why brother don't they know Llewyn that
[24:49] in the days of the when the son of man
[24:51] is is to be revealed saying Matthew 24
[24:54] there's a parable there about the the
[24:58] faithful and wise servant and that the
[25:01] servant is to give our meat in due
[25:03] season and all the whole thing is that
[25:06] the Son of Man is revealed as the word
[25:10] and in the the two servants are told to
[25:14] give our food and due season and then
[25:16] the Son of Man is revealed now and in
[25:20] the the faithful and wise servant says
[25:23] that Jesus Christ is here today and it
[25:26] gives that out for about eight years and
[25:30] signs follow with then all this believe
[25:33] it for a while and after I may about 68
[25:37] or 69 they begin to say that the Lord
[25:39] tarries he hasn't come yet and he may be
[25:44] he'll come in a tent and maybe come in a
[25:46] resurrection and nobody got the Holy
[25:48] Ghost now and then he's not there the
[25:50] son of man is not there if nobody got
[25:52] the Holy Ghost he's not here now and
[25:54] then he begins to smite his fellow
[25:56] servant with this doctrine did you get
[26:01] it he begins to remember brother Bram's
[26:04] dream back was served with as a term he
[26:06] had a dream about this big
[26:08] denominational father what a big a big
[26:11] three corners stick and every time the
[26:14] woman the church rolls up he beat her
[26:16] down again well what was these servants
[26:18] doing with the sticks they was whipping
[26:21] the fellow servants the past eight years
[26:23] with funny doctrines every
[26:26] a little bribe would raise up to believe
[26:28] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[26:29] today and forever when they hear about
[26:31] New York City somebody will put them
[26:33] down there's no more Holy Ghost there's
[26:37] no more signs there's no more nothing
[26:39] only one man can do it and you got to
[26:40] wait whipping them down with the smite
[26:43] gnam amen
[26:45] now watch the son of man is there all
[26:48] the time hiding in his word and the
[26:54] unfaithful service don't know it he's
[26:57] all around whenever they got a tape that
[27:00] he's there where there's a similar book
[27:03] he's there but they don't see him he's
[27:06] hiding and simplicity watching to see
[27:09] what they gonna do with his word he's
[27:13] seen what the ministers are going to do
[27:14] it they're gonna preach it the same way
[27:15] Paul preached it the same way Elijah
[27:18] preached it the same way a recent public
[27:20] up in Timothy and Barnabas and the rest
[27:22] of them preached it if they come along
[27:24] but now we can't do this here and we
[27:25] can't lay hands upon the sick and we
[27:27] can't do these things here you see and
[27:29] not realizing that the promise comes
[27:32] which is a promise a promise that's what
[27:35] I'm going to do then have you take the
[27:39] promise then you must suffer the
[27:40] reproach of barrenness you must be
[27:44] bearing for a while you get it you every
[27:49] son must be chastised must be tested and
[27:53] chance of what you believe and if that's
[27:57] why I pray for the sick it won't happen
[27:59] I don't get too scared to come back and
[28:01] play again God promised he didn't tell
[28:05] me Lynn told me to believe it he told me
[28:08] a bit the son of man is here I believe
[28:10] it
[28:11] where's his word he come down to America
[28:15] for mouth of powerful Raziel them and a
[28:17] son of man
[28:19] just behind my veil and behind yours
[28:24] and that's ways that I just told you the
[28:30] mystery of the personal crash being
[28:32] around sensation hiding then the son of
[28:38] man he's there all the time catches the
[28:41] unfaithful servant in our when he thinks
[28:43] not and he's a true servant but he
[28:46] appoints him his portion with the
[28:49] hypocrites didn't call me hypocrite but
[28:52] he appoints him his portion with the
[28:54] hypocrites see some none here some
[28:57] innocence not a minor she took my no
[29:00] that's why I rather bring him one of the
[29:03] absolute the Word of God then when the
[29:06] Son of Man returns back for that second
[29:08] ride he finds a faithful servant giving
[29:11] out the same food because he realized
[29:15] that the faithful servant through the
[29:16] eye of faith sees the scriptures coming
[29:19] to pass as a son of man being revealed
[29:21] then he gives that faithful servant
[29:25] makes him ruler over all of his goods
[29:28] adoption you got him that's what's going
[29:34] on praise the Lord
[29:36] so we walk in the light amen now in
[29:40] which he lives
[29:41] see then to walk in the light the bride
[29:44] tonight is exhorted to walk in a light
[29:48] not merely which he gives William Brown
[29:51] as a prophet
[29:51] come on to Arizona let's do this here
[29:54] has a tape said all right but let's get
[29:56] into the word weighs an innocent cause
[30:00] the message is taking him back to the
[30:01] word and if you can get back to the
[30:04] world where he's living at then the
[30:06] blood cleanses you and then you have
[30:08] fellowship one with another otherwise is
[30:11] wonderful we have the light on hidden
[30:13] things just age and many believe it the
[30:16] six seals but could lit up everything in
[30:18] the church to six seals but he's living
[30:21] under the Seventh Seal silence amen
[30:27] she's under the Seventh Seal
[30:30] hiding simplicity nobody knows what's
[30:33] happening you understand me now see but
[30:36] the bride noticed the word so she has a
[30:39] revival going on and within her like the
[30:42] Welshman and yes way he's living it now
[30:45] we walk in a lab where he lives that
[30:47] then we have fellowship one with another
[30:49] what a revelation we have friends where
[30:51] he lives he lives in every word his
[30:54] presence is in every word his power is
[30:57] every word his nature is in every word
[30:59] now it's one condition if we walk in
[31:03] this light as he is in the light where
[31:05] he is dwelling right now
[31:07] then the power in the blood cleansed us
[31:10] from all sin now one say something I
[31:12] don't read some T again from God hidden
[31:14] in simplicity page 56 why to refuse
[31:20] light is to walk in darkness that put
[31:24] their children in death row he's talking
[31:25] about this case down in Texas with just
[31:27] a man who had taken the picture of the
[31:29] pillar fire I want to read on down now
[31:33] he hid himself in the death of Christ
[31:34] but manifests himself in the
[31:36] resurrection all my and so forth there's
[31:38] no end to it you can just keep saying
[31:40] but there you are to refuse to say there
[31:43] is sunshine is to go into the basement
[31:44] and shut your eyes from the light that's
[31:46] right and remember the only way that you
[31:48] can be wrong is first to refuse right
[31:50] and to refuse open your eyes you'll live
[31:53] in darkness if you just refuse to look
[31:55] how are you going to see watch the
[31:57] simple things it's the little things
[32:00] that you leave undone not two big things
[32:02] you're trying to do oh my then look here
[32:06] and there we are
[32:08] it is these little things that we have
[32:11] endeavored to teach you little things
[32:14] where you can little slice and where are
[32:17] this person they don't mean nothing in
[32:18] your way they're not a big person so
[32:20] and just by passing and so forth
[32:22] you know respects to one another and
[32:23] that's why we have endeavor to teach you
[32:26] respect for one another in these little
[32:29] things because that's where God is that
[32:32] on page 58 think everything will run
[32:36] just as common as as it can be a fanatic
[32:39] message will go by and the first thing
[32:42] you know
[32:43] ministers going somewhere he's never
[32:44] come back he proudly went to the woods
[32:46] hunting
[32:47] he's never returned no more this fella
[32:49] went somewhere you know what happened I
[32:50] believed that young girl she must been
[32:52] called away somewhere you know someone
[32:54] take a girl out there and ravish and
[32:55] probably throw it in a river she was
[32:58] nobody handful of it see
[33:00] he says ninety nine out of every may say
[33:03] one out of every hundred million would
[33:04] ever know anything about it unless
[33:05] somebody's acquainted with said well the
[33:07] girls missing you talk about the rapture
[33:09] how is gonna be a fanatic message will
[33:12] go by and it did and they're waiting for
[33:15] something he said John's own disciples
[33:17] was didn't know that Elijah was there he
[33:22] said the first thing you know the place
[33:23] will be up on earth and then they'll see
[33:26] the son of man he didn't say in what
[33:28] form and they said why say it describes
[33:30] at last miss first come he's already
[33:32] come you didn't know it brother what an
[33:35] hour for us a Pyncheon and move into God
[33:38] let all the foolishness goal this is a
[33:41] time to dig in get down into God and see
[33:44] all the foolishness finish with now if
[33:47] we walk in the light as he turned the
[33:48] light where he's dwelling right on now
[33:50] he said the simple things that write the
[33:52] little simple thing see then the power
[33:55] cleanse us from all sin now God hiding a
[34:00] simplicity of the little things little
[34:03] things you leave undone not the big
[34:05] things you're trying to do see and now
[34:08] but in simply obeying God like Elijah
[34:11] did obedience is better than sacrifice
[34:14] see now there is God hiding and
[34:17] simplicity then revealing himself out to
[34:20] the obedient ones taking away their sins
[34:22] through the power in the blood
[34:24] the other thing I'm saying though in a
[34:27] little simple things that there's God
[34:28] and those who do the little things God
[34:31] takes away their sins then the others
[34:35] who stumble on top of these little
[34:36] things don't even care thing about it
[34:38] they're fussing and stewing and there's
[34:40] no fellowship and they're scratchy and
[34:41] they're hard and stiff because they
[34:45] won't come to those little things and
[34:48] that's where they stumble over top of
[34:51] God and the prophet of God warned us and
[34:53] told us and yet they still won't come to
[34:55] the
[34:56] little things they've seen and then now
[34:58] in second Timothy second Timothy the
[35:03] first chapter well praise the Lord yes
[35:07] sir hey men second Timothy first chapter
[35:11] 6 verse wherefore putting remembrance
[35:13] that I'll stir up the gift of God which
[35:15] is indeed by the putting over my hands
[35:17] for God have not given us the spirit of
[35:19] fear but of power and of love and of a
[35:23] sound mind
[35:23] what a wonderful scripture and this word
[35:27] spirit we don't have the spirit of fear
[35:29] you don't like you to point your nails
[35:31] everything skids a little shadow we have
[35:33] a spirit of power and I always check up
[35:36] this word in the Greek and it's the word
[35:38] this name power is a Dunamis inherent
[35:42] power to reproduce itself implying need
[35:46] of constant activity and use for
[35:50] continued reproduction our English word
[35:53] dynamo and a dynamics now it means the
[35:59] branch of mechanics treating of motion
[36:02] that's what a dynamics mean the
[36:04] principles of active operation just as a
[36:07] dynamo needs to be in motion to produce
[36:09] power amen so one needs to stir up into
[36:14] flame the gift of God in his last you
[36:18] got it and the only thing I know it can
[36:20] stir up to get the Guardian life is the
[36:22] Word of God then if you don't want the
[36:26] word on the world can you be stirred up
[36:29] it's impossible forgot to even get to
[36:32] you
[36:33] you understand them so therefore st.
[36:36] John 1:11 for as many as receive him he
[36:39] gave them power amen
[36:42] to become the sons of God even to them
[36:44] that believe on his name those without
[36:46] the Holy Ghost that would receive him he
[36:48] gives them power to become the sons of
[36:51] God he gave it to Peter in him and they
[36:54] didn't have the Holy Ghost the st. John
[36:55] 17 far the way they have we have they
[36:58] have received that words a may kept them
[37:01] in fellowship with him is that right
[37:04] then when the flame seems to have died
[37:06] out he have a broken fellowship then
[37:09] where it comes to you see to stir up the
[37:13] gift in you of life
[37:14] you see if you will receive me the word
[37:16] I'll give you power if you only receive
[37:19] me
[37:21] I'll give you power for my thought is
[37:25] there is power in the bird see the power
[37:31] is in the blood now we want to find out
[37:33] tonight where's this power in the blue
[37:36] net and we want to find out amen see I
[37:40] give you power now receive my words then
[37:45] we understand why there is no revival in
[37:47] our souls sin in one form of another
[37:51] it's blocking it up the little thing
[37:53] that God is asking us to do and we want
[37:56] something big from God how can you give
[37:57] it to you when he actually do one little
[37:59] simple thing in order dude you won't do
[38:02] it well the only working God bless you
[38:06] I'm gonna show you why I wouldn't care
[38:09] how scratchy it gets tonight there don't
[38:13] make no difference to me you see because
[38:17] if this long person who gets it then we
[38:20] can have a revival if one person gets
[38:24] what I'm talking about tonight see it is
[38:26] fighting all the way tonight see there's
[38:28] only one thing in the world that can
[38:30] free us from sin only one thing and that
[38:33] is the power of the blood of Jesus
[38:37] Christ now what is it that gives the
[38:39] blood of Jesus Christ is mighty power I
[38:42] want to know what is it in the blood
[38:45] that gives us so much power don't you
[38:49] want to know by the panel of the blood
[38:52] just a few things peace is made between
[38:54] God and man just blood God acts upon
[38:59] birth and gives peace between him and
[39:02] man by the power and this is the power
[39:06] of the blood now there is forgiveness of
[39:08] sins and eternal life for all who put
[39:11] their faith in Jesus Christ by the power
[39:13] of the blood by the power of the blood
[39:16] Satan is overcome
[39:18] by the power blood there is continued
[39:20] cleansing on broken fellowship amen by
[39:26] the peril of blood we may be sipped free
[39:29] from the tyranny of an evil conscience
[39:31] thoughts thoughts thoughts thoughts yes
[39:34] I get sick and tired of hearing thoughts
[39:37] thoughts that is the devil terrorizing
[39:41] you with thoughts tyranny dipping your
[39:44] down with thoughts and here's God
[39:46] telling you to take his thoughts and you
[39:49] refuse to do it you'll ever dwell on his
[39:53] thoughts you'll ever believe that your
[39:55] scoundrel you did you did this you did
[39:58] that with all the time he is telling you
[40:00] that you are my bride there is no sin at
[40:06] all and you won't take it why you rather
[40:10] be terrorized by a devil but if you only
[40:13] take the blood and the power in the bird
[40:17] will set you free
[40:18] [Applause]
[40:20] may priests car the peril of blood makes
[40:26] us it gives us power to serve the Living
[40:28] God by is this power in the blood has
[40:34] infinite power with God we want to get
[40:39] to tonight the most unworthy the remote
[40:44] the richest person in the world through
[40:47] the power of the blood has Liberty to
[40:50] enter into the Holy of Holies of God's
[40:53] presence and live there all day I mean
[41:01] stay there all day question what gives
[41:05] the blood all this power and how many
[41:09] experience its full power in our lives
[41:11] they answer to the question first
[41:15] question script you hear revelation 7:14
[41:19] and I said unto him Sir thou knowest he
[41:22] said unto me the
[41:24] survey which came out of Great
[41:25] Tribulation and have washed their robes
[41:27] and made them white in the blood of the
[41:30] Lamb revelation 12:11 and he overcame
[41:35] him by the blood of the Lamb now we want
[41:39] to find out what is about this lamb now
[41:42] know is it was not the blood of a mighty
[41:45] warrior but the blood of a lamb in other
[41:50] words that which gives a precious
[41:53] bloodiest power with God for men is you
[41:57] ready
[41:58] here comes is the lamb like disposition
[42:04] attitude of the Lord who hid it and of
[42:12] which it is the supreme supreme
[42:15] expression the title the lamb there's a
[42:20] title the lamb wouldn't it be wonderful
[42:22] to be known as the lamb what a wonderful
[42:27] christ-like sister she's a lamb he's a
[42:31] lamb that's what I want to be known as a
[42:35] lamb there's the power now here it is
[42:39] first it first of all the lamb is is is
[42:44] that is that is a description of his
[42:47] work you see a sacrifice for our sin
[42:50] that describes it see now the second
[42:52] thing the title the lamb has a deeper
[42:56] meaning
[42:56] it describes his character the lamb
[43:00] describes his character he is the lamb
[43:03] in that he is meek and lowly in heart
[43:05] gentle and unresisting and all the times
[43:09] are rendering his own will to the
[43:12] father's and for the blessing and saving
[43:14] of man all the time he had no rice I had
[43:19] many inscripted by one going tonight
[43:20] Isaiah 53 he died on the cross because
[43:24] he is the lamb you understand no other
[43:29] way he didn't go to the cross and become
[43:31] a lamb
[43:32] you get it we didn't go up there and
[43:35] then he had to die so he had a funny had
[43:37] to give in but because he was a lamb he
[43:40] went to the cross amen
[43:44] so all the good different isn't it so
[43:46] it's like Ghostly you serve God he
[43:48] finally gets in here and pin you down
[43:49] show your revelation show your vision if
[43:52] finally you say okay Lord I'm gonna
[43:53] serve you you don't want that
[43:58] nobody wants stamping and whack and chop
[44:00] you up and then finally you you pin into
[44:04] the corner and you can't get out you
[44:06] exposed and then you have to serve God
[44:09] serve God because your lamb God don't

[46:09] blood of Christ with his self offering
[46:11] to God and it is this fact that bestows
[46:14] upon it its power with God for men you
[46:19] see for this lamb disposition has ever
[46:22] been of supreme value to God God can use
[46:27] that nature full he's God he's the
[46:30] Creator he wants all his subjects to be
[46:33] lamb like and he can dwell with him /
[46:38] he's God humility lamb likeness the
[46:42] surrender of our wills are what he looks
[46:44] for supremely from man now in God's mind
[46:49] it was for this reason that he created
[46:53] Adam he created Adam a lamb you get it
[46:59] and so then when he create a lamb so he
[47:04] the Dove the power is the Dove you get
[47:09] to know the Dove is the power Amen the
[47:13] lamb is the nature humble then the dog
[47:17] can alight on the layout that's what
[47:22] will wait for me so the Holy Spirit is
[47:25] tonight the simple message is showing
[47:28] you how to enter him this is your chance
[47:31] tonight don't flub it you flubbed it for
[47:34] nine years then don't after tonight
[47:36] don't miss it you'll make it clear to
[47:38] you tonight
[47:40] amen God created Adam so he could he'd
[47:45] add of could dwell with his creation but
[47:50] when he come down he's got to be on
[47:53] humility because God is humility
[47:57] amen now it was the refusal of Adam and
[48:01] Eve to walk this path that constituted
[48:05] the first sin they did they want
[48:08] self-will II wonder what she want to do
[48:11] then she was no more lamb like she
[48:16] become a goat nature but but but the way
[48:20] you know we should but I don't think so
[48:23] and there you go you see so if you come
[48:28] if you know it's the word don't fight it
[48:32] don't fight it you know the man stand up
[48:36] here what God has vindicated it at the
[48:40] HS you gonna fight it yes or no sing now
[48:47] and it has been the heart of sin ever
[48:51] since to do
[48:53] Yoel against his will now it was a bring
[48:57] this lamb just after Adam and Eve sin
[49:00] then God was busy setting things in
[49:03] motion he's going to have around
[49:07] praise God sold it genesis 3:15 he
[49:12] started for that lamb the woman shall
[49:15] have a seed is going to be a lamb
[49:18] amen started a naval an Abraham right on
[49:21] down and all God's people were humble
[49:24] they're all lambs sheep and a shepherd
[49:30] live let him breathe got into the
[49:33] heavens all the way through the Bible
[49:37] was sheep Ram
[49:39] that's what a sheet means or a layout or
[49:43] lamb disposition a lamb header tude not
[49:48] my will entire will be done now it was
[49:53] to bring this lamb disposition nature
[49:57] back to earth that's why Jesus came to
[50:01] get it back on earth ellika for William
[50:04] Branham alaya
[50:05] another layer is we saw it we saw the
[50:08] life generous that we handle it we saw
[50:11] it we saw it manifested that right and
[50:15] then the bride comes along to let Jesus
[50:18] the Dove now Jesus is a dove and we to
[50:22] Lamb
[50:22] so she lets Jesus the Dove come into her
[50:26] nature to give her power in her blood
[50:31] you got it
[50:33] then she is letting the Dove have
[50:36] preeminence and the preeminence
[50:39] automatically cleanses every bit of sin
[50:42] and unbroken fellowship then you see the
[50:46] tub in the lamb walking together on the
[50:50] earth the bride in Jesus Christ 1 what a
[50:56] love affair for 8 years has been going
[51:00] on what's it for to restore the whole
[51:04] family back to the Garden of Eden where
[51:07] the Dove and the lamb can dwell again
[51:11] all he wanted to do it at him and Eve
[51:14] and he wanted to add him to call from
[51:17] the dust some more limbs and sin
[51:20] interrupted the program but brother
[51:22] Branham said in the Millennium he'll
[51:24] call them from the dust again I can't
[51:26] figure it out we already take it over
[51:28] there does it be a blessing when I get
[51:29] there to figure it out
[51:30] amen might have some more out of plants
[51:33] over there I don't know praise the Lord
[51:36] Amen praise God at night now you see why
[51:41] I say I know where I'm going tonight I
[51:43] know where I was going I know why he was
[51:45] fighting yes sir
[51:47] it was simply because the father saw
[51:50] this in him that he could see here it is
[51:54] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[51:57] pleased to dwell in a lamb God was so
[52:03] happy he found a lamb
[52:05] again he wanted handle but had him sin
[52:07] become a boat but God fell his lamb
[52:11] Jesus Christ the Lamb of God and ended
[52:17] up was so happy to death come down in
[52:19] dwell with the lamb and led the lamb to
[52:24] the slaughter took him there for you and
[52:25] me it was because the shedding of his
[52:29] blood nature life so supremely Express
[52:32] this disposition that it is so utterly
[52:35] precious to God and so all availing from
[52:38] man and his sin you get it now see this
[52:41] nature God love this lamb like nature
[52:45] notice when you be around and your
[52:48] fellowship and no brother or sister it's
[52:51] China now the Lord told me a vision

[52:55] just get in the word and bless one
[52:57] another when they come at a say mmm the
[52:59] okay praise the Lord wonderful see now
[53:02] but when they just get on the word and
[53:05] in the Holy Spirit is there yet you can
[53:06] tell because this one will speak and
[53:09] everybody listen then the other one will
[53:11] speak and as they keep doing then the
[53:12] Holy Spirit comes closer and closer
[53:15] because it's all Lambs there and a dog
[53:17] just comes out and blesses from one to
[53:19] the other one amen and then the oil it
[53:21] gets so wonderful you feel fine don't
[53:22] you you get into one little fellowship
[53:24] where somebody want to get up with the
[53:25] word and give exhortation what not
[53:28] saying well I was I guess I'll be going
[53:30] after a while see if you're gone see but
[53:33] when you get the lamb like nature's
[53:34] around no backbiting no evil surmising
[53:38] no talking about this and talking about
[53:39] this one in that one just little lambs

[54:00] that this is what happened they don't
[54:02] understand this here and just like that
[54:04] the Holy Spirit just spoke to me said
[54:06] the power in the blood is the dynamics
[54:09] and I said praise be to God the power in
[54:15] blood is the dynamics and the dynamics
[54:18] is God praise Allah and we are the
[54:22] mechanics the lamb like natures and then
[54:26] the blood of Jesus Christ with the
[54:28] dynamics in it the power in it cleanses
[54:30] us from all sin takes it right away the
[54:33] Holy Spirit is the dynamics in the blood
[54:37] of Jesus Christ then the word the word
[54:41] which is the dynamics of God by the Holy

[55:55] gift in you the spirit of power inherent
[55:58] power to reproduce yourself implying
[56:00] need of constant activity that's why we

[56:06] stirring up you know those who don't
[56:08] have the word they could try see this
[56:12] not being stirred and then the activity

[58:01] be low and down like it's a come along
[58:04] and bless you throws down some barley up
[58:06] on you the power in the blood is a demon
[58:09] but dynamics which comes upon the nature
[58:11] of the blood which is lamb like
[58:13] disposition northern Eicher can it fall
[58:16] upon to manifest the power of the word
[58:19] there's not another nature that the
[58:22] power of the blood can fall upon to
[58:25] manifest the power of the word
[58:28] there's only own limbs there's your
[58:32] answer to the revelation of September
[58:34] 2nd confess your sins he is stirring up
[58:36] the power of blood to free you from sin
[58:39] and praise God he sent down a dove and
[58:44] as the power in the blood to stir it up
[58:48] now we have it now see but being by
[58:51] being willing to have the same
[58:52] disposition that ruled him you see just
[58:57] as it is the disposition of the lamb
[58:59] that bestows upon the blood its power so
[59:02] it is today if we are willing to be
[59:04] partakers of the same disposition of the
[59:09] lamb then we can finally know the full
[59:12] power of God in our lives
[59:14] sister Nadine the DOE shall come upon us
[59:18] as lambs do we understand dear friends
[59:21] tonight we may be partakers of his
[59:25] disposition if we want to for has been
[59:29] made transferable to us by his death
[59:32] it's ours if we want it you see all the
[59:37] fruits of the Holy Spirit mentioned in
[59:39] in Galatians 5 is ours
[59:41] how does it come to us by the Dove so
[59:46] anyway it comes and when it does bring
[59:48] zit you just know it's it's just passes
[59:52] all understanding praise God
[59:54] what are they but expressions love peace
[59:59] joy long-suffering gentleness goodness
[1:00:00] faith meekness self-control they are
[1:00:03] expressions of the lamb like nature in
[1:00:06] you then that you have the nature of the
[1:00:10] word
[1:00:11] which is - you have a spirit in you to
[1:00:14] begin with to obey the word then the
[1:00:17] Dove comes and settles down and
[1:00:19] manifests the word and the word is peace
[1:00:23] and joy and long-suffering and healing
[1:00:25] and everything else you get it now so
[1:00:30] that if you don't have nothing well you
[1:00:31] got the wrong nature so I can tell you
[1:00:35] and then you need to repent and ask God
[1:00:39] for our lamb lank nature then you can
[1:00:46] have a revival in your home then God
[1:00:48] will send a servant of God your way with
[1:00:52] the word of the Lord and may you might
[1:00:55] have a little situation going on right
[1:00:57] now if you really made up your mind
[1:01:00] tonight after nice message that that's
[1:01:03] why I missed the power of the blood
[1:01:05] because of my disposition and my
[1:01:08] attitude lord help me to understand from
[1:01:12] now on starting Sunday morning whatever
[1:01:15] is preached let that be for me oh you
[1:01:20] can only come to that tonight brother
[1:01:23] you see something happened in here you
[1:01:26] found in our friends see praise God amen
[1:01:30] and the Holy Spirit wants to fill us why
[1:01:33] to reproduce himself in us he wants to
[1:01:36] do it more than what we wanted he's
[1:01:39] waiting for his little Adams and Eve's
[1:01:41] he wants him to come for us he can dwell
[1:01:44] amen
[1:01:45] so when you see a person with the
[1:01:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost the Dove is
[1:01:50] dwelling with them they have an unbroken
[1:01:52] fellowship they make mistakes they
[1:01:55] quickly humble themselves through the
[1:01:57] Word of God that's where I started out I
[1:01:59] could understand you know what do people
[1:02:00] get so mad about if they claim to have
[1:02:03] the Holy Ghost I can see a person that
[1:02:05] don't have the Holy Ghost but the person
[1:02:08] claims to have the Holy Ghost what are
[1:02:10] they up tight upon now I want to know
[1:02:13] about peace and love and joy and
[1:02:16] long-suffering with the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:02:18] speaking about now now those without the
[1:02:20] Holy Ghost I give you power
[1:02:22] to become the sons of God and I give you
[1:02:25] a promise and you believe it unto it I'm
[1:02:27] going to fill you and all the eight
[1:02:30] years ten years I have given you power
[1:02:34] to become the sons of God you know why
[1:02:37] because you took the word and the Dove
[1:02:40] was in the word to power praise the Lord
[1:02:44] so either way you go now see but now are
[1:02:47] we willing can you nurse
[1:02:51] that is the question let us stand can
[1:02:56] you nurse if you can nurse brother the
[1:03:01] Dove can dwell with us Sunday morning
[1:03:05] next Wednesday
[1:03:07] falling Sunday it's going to be the best
[1:03:10] has been pronounced already
[1:03:12] can we nurse can we come to our mental
[1:03:17] attitude tonight mature that we finally
[1:03:20] are not going to back up from the Word
[1:03:22] of God which is only Jesus the dove
[1:03:25] trying to come in and free us from sin
[1:03:28] he knows we don't know it was a tune for
[1:03:33] walking the lighten ending are we
[1:03:38] willing we can walk in the light you
[1:03:41] know where he is if we're willing we
[1:03:47] don't try to make ourselves feel the
[1:03:50] humility of Jesus you know feel feel no
[1:03:56] we only have to walk in the light the
[1:03:59] word and be willing for God to in that
[1:04:02] here it is be willing for God to reveal
[1:04:06] any sin that may be in our lives that's
[1:04:11] the price you gotta pay
[1:04:14] now many of us have fought this for 10
[1:04:17] years before it ran this way in that way
[1:04:20] but we come to the end are you willing
[1:04:25] now tonight you want to walk in that
[1:04:28] beautiful light you want the Dove to
[1:04:31] come down and overtake you and bless you
[1:04:36] he's here tonight moving around you now

[1:04:43] Gonzales he was standing by the water
[1:04:46] cooler drinking water and I approached
[1:04:49] him and a thought of unbelief struck
[1:04:52] Daniel and I said Daniel don't think
[1:04:55] that he said what am I thinking and I
[1:04:59] said in the dream I told him what he was
[1:05:02] thinking he became afraid of me see now

[1:05:17] when this message came to me my wife was
[1:05:20] talking to his mother and that's the
[1:05:22] dream he had and I knew what it meant

[1:05:28] we're his children and you're afraid and
[1:05:32] you think I know some things on yourself
[1:05:35] and say it's not me it's a dove
[1:05:38] oh praise God the Dove wants a he knows
[1:05:42] what's in your hearts the things that's
[1:05:45] in our hearts he wants to get rid of so
[1:05:49] he sends his word down the line to get
[1:05:52] rid of it then he sends the power out of
[1:05:55] heaven stirs the blood up and it's gone
[1:05:58] he does all this that we could have
[1:06:00] fellowship together and that's why the
[1:06:03] Word of God has been preached these
[1:06:04] eight years oh it was that he could have
[1:06:07] a place somewhere we can have fellowship
[1:06:08] and pour his blessings in there so
