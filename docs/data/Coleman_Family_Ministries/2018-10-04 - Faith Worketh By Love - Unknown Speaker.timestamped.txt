[0:00] let us turn to the word this morning as
[0:02] we settle down st. John the 14th chapter
[0:06] and 16th verse through the 26 first
[0:12] Ephesians the 3rd chapter 16 verse
[0:18] through the 19th and Galatians fifth
[0:22] chapter fifth and sixth verse now I'm
[0:26] going to take my time this morning
[0:29] because I am unfamiliar with the pulpit
[0:31] have been here quite a while but the
[0:34] Holy Spirit he knows so I'll just take
[0:36] my time so I like to teach this morning
[0:39] sometimes you like to come back and
[0:41] teach the word to the people that's what
[0:44] we're here for Sunday School this
[0:46] morning so people might know which way
[0:51] to grow up him I'm reading from Saint
[0:53] John the 14th chapter xvi verse and I
[0:57] pray the father he shall give you
[0:59] another comforter that he may abide with
[1:02] you forever even the Spirit of Truth
[1:05] whom the world cannot receive because it
[1:08] seeth him not neither knoweth him but
[1:10] you know him for he dwelleth with you
[1:12] and shall be in you I will not leave you
[1:16] comfortless I will come to you yet a
[1:18] little while and the world seeth me no
[1:20] more but ye see me because I live ye
[1:24] shall live also at that day you shall
[1:26] know that I am in my father ye and me
[1:28] and I anew he that hath my Commandments
[1:31] and keepeth them he it is that loveth me
[1:35] he allows me shall be loved of my father
[1:38] and I will love him and will manifest
[1:41] myself to him Judas saith unto Him not
[1:44] Iscariot Lord how is it that thou will
[1:47] manifest thyself unto us and not unto
[1:49] the world
[1:50] jesus answered said unto him if a man
[1:52] love me he will keep my word and my
[1:56] father will love him and we will come
[1:58] unto him and make our abode with him he
[2:01] that loveth me not keepeth not my
[2:04] sayings and the word which ye hear is
[2:06] not mine but the father which sent me
[2:09] these things have I spoken unto you
[2:11] being yet present with you but the
[2:13] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[2:15] the father will send in my name he shall
[2:18] teach you all things and bring all
[2:20] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[2:22] have said unto you
[2:23] Ephesians the 3rd chapter 16 verse that
[2:29] he would grant you according to the
[2:31] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[2:33] with might by his spirit in the inner
[2:37] man that Christ may dwell in your hearts
[2:41] by faith that ye being rooted and
[2:43] grounded in love may be able to
[2:46] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[2:48] breadth and length and depth and height
[2:51] and to know the love of Christ which
[2:54] passes all knowledge that you might be
[2:56] filled with all the fullness of God
[2:59] Galatians 5 5 6
[3:07] for we through the spirit wait for the
[3:11] hope of righteousness by faith for in
[3:14] Christ Jesus neither circumcision
[3:16] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[3:20] faith which worketh by love and God a
[3:24] blessing the reading of this word take a
[3:27] title from this faith worketh by love
[3:31] yeah Paul here and this great book of
[3:36] Ephesians the book that I was reading in
[3:40] the 7th church age book there the other
[3:42] day the chapter about the visions said
[3:45] that was a holy people
[3:47] Ephesians was the spiritual church now
[3:52] naturally that the message from the
[3:54] angel went to the Ephesians Church and
[3:56] the Corinthian was in the Friesians
[3:59] church age there's all types in in a
[4:01] church age but this particular Ephesians
[4:04] church itself Paul could teach all the
[4:07] great doctrines to them see and he could
[4:10] tell them being Gentiles most of them
[4:13] because after those original ones that
[4:16] explained to them the workings of the
[4:19] nature he explained to them by nature
[4:22] because you Gentiles and war and strife
[4:24] and always think that was what you did
[4:26] when you was before you were saved but
[4:28] he could explain to them that you're
[4:30] washed by the water of the word he could
[4:33] tell them that they was predestinated on
[4:36] to adoption and all of the great
[4:39] doctrines they're in here to me this is
[4:43] one of the greatest prayers in the Bible
[4:45] for there's a prayer for inner fullness
[4:48] and knowledge see and the thing that
[4:53] strikes me here the 16th verse that he
[4:55] would grant you according to the riches
[4:57] of his glory to be strengthened with
[4:59] might by his spirit in the inner man so
[5:06] we see that there's supposed to be
[5:08] another person a new man
[5:12] a different one a new spiritual self
[5:15] that's supposed to be inside and this
[5:20] only way that this person can get in
[5:22] there it's true a baptism of the Holy
[5:26] Ghost and then that's a scene see god is
[5:31] love
[5:33] but he comes so he's the word but he
[5:37] starts out with a seed plants to see
[5:41] then it's the seed of love and it's a
[5:45] spirit in spirit and then it is to
[5:47] produce at the end love joy peace
[5:53] temperance long-suffering meekness
[5:55] gentleness and all of the fruits of the
[5:58] Spirit amen
[5:59] and sold in we see them that Paul here
[6:04] with praying that for the theater they
[6:06] would be strengthened in the inner man
[6:09] that though the inner man would be in
[6:11] there in seed form that he wants to be
[6:14] strengthened by the word see the early
[6:18] church they just didn't come to suddenly
[6:22] because come on suddenly because they
[6:25] hear a sermon on Wednesday they were
[6:28] spirit-filled everyday words fed word
[6:32] filled every day they had powers visions
[6:38] all kind of signs follow wherever they
[6:41] were but when they come together it was
[6:44] an explosion the prophets could get up
[6:47] and prophesied by the Holy Ghost one by
[6:51] one
[6:52] amen there was no written Bible for them
[6:55] that they'd had a few Scrolls
[6:58] if they hadn't because money because
[7:00] they buy them the message had them
[7:01] because no doubt of the Old Testament
[7:03] but the Holy Spirit was there to take
[7:07] the Old Testament and reveal it out
[7:09] through servants prophets Aryans of what
[7:12] the Old Testament men in the New
[7:13] Testament the Bible was written two
[7:16] years later are you beginning to follow
[7:18] me now friends
[7:20] they were a spirit-filled and because
[7:24] more baptisms that's right they would
[7:27] because baptized they again once again
[7:28] they all come together and they were
[7:29] filled with the Holy Ghost again not
[7:32] just once again they will fill with the
[7:35] Word of God see so to really see God
[7:40] working you must have all the word and
[7:45] you must have the full of the Spirit and
[7:47] here was Paul praying that they would
[7:50] have be filled with the fullness and we
[7:54] know that he was saying that if you've
[7:57] grounded and rooted in love love is the
[8:01] soil amen see if that's soil that ground
[8:07] is love then you can grow out of that
[8:10] love to be able to comprehend the
[8:14] breadth the height the depth of God that
[8:18] you may be able to do that but you got
[8:20] to be rooted and grounded in love and
[8:23] love is Jesus he was a great big bundle
[8:28] of love that God so loved the world he
[8:31] sent him to us that's what so now we may
[8:34] understand and his breath was boundless
[8:39] the breath of him the lent was endless
[8:43] amen
[8:45] endless no way to measure that the depth
[8:48] was because fathomless exhaustless amen
[8:53] praise the Lord amen the height
[8:56] measureless can't mention praise God I'm
[9:01] talking about my lord Amen when you
[9:04] begin to talk about how great God is the
[9:06] devil's got to leave he's got to leave

[9:30] to the eighth
[9:32] to measure God's love can I do it
[9:36] praise our God how He loves us today if
[9:40] we only get a revelation that we've got
[9:43] a God that loves his Rock
[9:46] and you wouldn't fear peace be still
[9:50] he can still all the fears calm all the
[9:54] waves

[30:38] they'll give my body to be burned and
[30:40] have not charity it probably nothing now
[30:43] much faith faith there's a gift of thing
[30:46] amen and then there's faith to receive
[30:52] amen let us take into you we see a lot
[30:56] of bulldozers out there Odegard Jesus
[30:58] man with faith out there do all kind of
[31:00] things out there get the faith gifts and
[31:02] corner guys around repentance so right
[31:05] now there's plenty of people right now
[31:07] say well you know buddy got nothing
[31:08] there because I don't see no signs of
[31:10] one is a miracle I don't see the powers
[31:12] of God moving I don't see that faith
[31:14] what you can have that still be wrong
[31:17] what if he planted because of love
[31:20] or see in your heart a seed of love in
[31:25] there that seed of love is right now
[31:28] growing brightening maturing into our
[31:33] Galatians 5:22 and in the fruit of the
[31:37] Spirit is faith so the little person
[31:41] sitting down here will know and they
[31:42] want to have pain too because it's a
[31:45] fruit of the Spirit the man may stay out
[31:48] there with a gift of faith to preach to
[31:50] them or like to tear but you got to see
[31:52] groaning you that's gonna produce faith
[31:53] and that'll be your wrapped in faith you
[31:56] want to have it and can't nobody taking
[31:58] away from you it can't know Paul's devil
[32:01] come up to you with some kind of crazy
[32:02] doctrine I'm looking here brother get
[32:05] away from you okay you serpent you see
[32:07] that's right cuz you will you'll know he
[32:11] was just perfect is come you know all
[32:13] things you know now see and you're
[32:15] growing right on into it knows it's
[32:17] coming every day you see but there's
[32:20] still some fun is hanging out there that
[32:22] he's going to reveal to you you're gonna
[32:24] do it amen
[32:26] see so now we see then that faith cometh
[32:29] by hearing Luther Wesley they heard they
[32:34] come by here again was saved
[32:35] amen see and faith is also planted
[32:39] though but now you cannot get this
[32:41] ratchet faith unless that is planning it
[32:44] by a seat holy spare to see and the
[32:47] Spirit of God must bring that fruit of
[32:50] the Spirit the faith of the Spirit the
[32:52] Spirit of God must do it and see it must
[32:54] be an in seed form to do it with you can
[32:57] have a give and don't have it in there
[32:58] that'll pass away amen see
[33:03] Paul said so you can have such a faith
[33:05] because could become move a mountain but
[33:08] they grounded in love amen
[33:11] pass away don't mean a thing Amen so we
[33:16] see them that love is the soil which we
[33:20] must grow in speaking the truth in love
[33:23] in love grow up into him in love
[33:26] speaking the truth living the truth
[33:28] because one to another for God is able I
[33:32] think here again Ephesians over here it
[33:34] says 3:20 now in Tim that's able to do
[33:38] exceedingly abundantly ask or think
[33:40] according to the power that worketh in
[33:46] US now he can only do all these things
[33:51] according to within you the power that
[33:54] is working in you what many would come
[33:57] in the last days denying the power from
[34:02] such turn away the power the revelation
[34:05] in you as to who Jesus Christ is who is
[34:08] the prophet and all this thing that
[34:09] power is there that power strengthens
[34:11] you in a revelation comes but they don't
[34:13] have the revelation there it is so if
[34:17] they don't have it you down there you
[34:20] surely can't have if I haven't got it
[34:22] we've heard that before
[34:24] you give it a meeting now if me with all
[34:27] my great ministry the only thing if I
[34:29] don't understand it
[34:30] how in the world can you understand I'm
[34:33] the one that's called and also ordained
[34:34] with a great ministry you don't talk
[34:36] about how can they understand anything
[34:39] there Oh God's able of these stones to
[34:43] raise children Abraham all right he told
[34:47] the church today he said the South is
[34:50] mixed up on the seed of the serpent they
[34:53] thought about it they know what he said
[34:55] he talked about the South natural down
[34:57] there because they're not even saved who
[35:01] listen to his message you find out we
[35:02] talking to so they all waiting with this
[35:06] message n who got the notes so we can
[35:09] see praise Allah
[35:12] now what is this power that Paul says is
[35:16] in in us that's God's love in seed form
[35:20] and the word is a seed and a word is
[35:24] part of God therefore there's a part of
[35:26] God in you in seed form all right well
[35:29] that that word in there is power all it
[35:33] needs is some water amen
[35:35] it'll begin to work it'll begin to bring
[35:38] forth what he said it'll do he planted
[35:41] it I have a load planner a large shell
[35:43] water it it'll bring four four is God
[35:46] now a couple of scriptures you want if
[35:48] you want to write it now Asians 424 I
[35:50] just want to lay out a background here
[35:52] and then finish up and that's you put on
[35:55] the new man if you want to write it down
[35:57] which after God is created in
[36:00] righteousness and true holiness so if
[36:03] you want to see a person who's a doing
[36:05] righteousness and also holiness well
[36:08] there's a new creation in them see that
[36:10] is because uh because created after
[36:12] holiness and so forth and righteousness
[36:14] also Colossians 3:10 if you wanna write
[36:17] it down and have put on the new man
[36:20] which is renewed in knowledge after the
[36:25] image of him that created him
[36:28] so this new man to seed in your little
[36:30] sea like this here is renewed day by day
[36:32] and so Paul said I travail in birth
[36:35] again because because the labor that
[36:38] Christ might be formed in you so God's
[36:42] prophet brings on birth pains amen what
[36:45] is that our prophet brings on birth
[36:47] pains so therefore he's laboring there
[36:50] Christ will be formed in you bringing
[36:52] forth the seed word coming into your
[36:54] spiritual wolves and then Christ is
[36:57] being formed at sea is growing through
[36:59] the shop body amen praise the Lord
[37:02] praise God so this new man is another
[37:06] nature another person a new man a new
[37:09] creation Peter says being born again by
[37:12] the Word of God the seed of God amen
[37:15] then our faith will work by the love of
[37:19] God that He shed aboard in our hearts he
[37:23] put a love in there for the word
[37:25] if only now by the holy spirit and the
[37:28] holy spirit in your heart loves God the
[37:31] word and it wants do all that it can for
[37:36] the love of God is in the heart so
[37:38] therefore it has faith because it loves
[37:41] the word it has faith because it loves
[37:43] his Saints love the tapes love their and
[37:46] don't want to break nothing it don't
[37:48] want to be seen nowhere with anybody
[37:50] who's funny there to pray for and if
[37:53] they had to run into him well praise the
[37:55] Lord
[37:56] stay on top round you can long enough
[37:57] and then this move way see but you want
[38:00] to stand around nikka their unbelief and
[38:02] unbelief kills you you go home you feel
[38:05] for you next day you know I'm talking
[38:07] about if you ever been inside my
[38:08] unbelief you fellowship there the next
[38:11] day you got a headache and everything
[38:12] else
[38:12] praise the Lord Abraham Oh a games wrote
[38:19] that works without faith his day
[38:22] so therefore Abraham worked his faith by
[38:26] his love for God because Abraham loved
[38:31] God more than Isaac then right because
[38:35] he loved God he gave up Isaac but he had
[38:40] a revelation didn't matter if you kill
[38:42] them coming back again anyway alright so
[38:45] no matter what we do we go to death
[38:47] that's why Peter wanted to be because
[38:49] Marlin upside down he'll raise in the
[38:52] last days wanted to identify himself
[38:55] with Jesus on the cross hold all of them
[38:58] Paul was bound to it couldn't keep him
[39:00] away from it amen my course is finished
[39:04] he says Charles made up for me he's on
[39:06] his way to it so he knew he is something
[39:09] in the heart that's pulsating in here
[39:11] and canto by stopping player for
[39:13] Abraham's faith worked by the by the
[39:16] love of God in his heart he loved go see
[39:19] the lamb for what about us and also our
[39:22] desires what should it be
[39:24] we don't have to come here because we
[39:26] supposed to come here well we call me
[39:28] because we love God amen we love the
[39:32] Brethren
[39:33] together and we can't make nobody do
[39:36] anything with anybody I'm so happy to
[39:40] see these people in here to see y'all
[39:42] going around to the sick the old ones
[39:44] and so forth that makes us feel
[39:46] wonderful because we know that we sow
[39:48] that seed and many before say well
[39:51] so-and-so don't visit me and but we
[39:52] can't do anything about it we kind of
[39:54] wait on God until the love of God gets
[39:56] in that person's heart amen for that
[39:59] they themselves will go out for the love
[40:03] of God in their heart for the Brethren
[40:05] sisters then this is not brother hunt
[40:08] brother Coleman tell and you get over
[40:10] the soy sauce house and you go over
[40:12] there and you go over there it's a my
[40:13] friend well then you come to see me well
[40:15] okay just call me a minute and we get
[40:16] because long could I go to see you send
[40:18] me now the people here there's people in
[40:21] here
[40:21] God sees that God sees that going to
[40:24] these ones here God sees everything
[40:25] you're a labor of love
[40:27] that's what Paul says is that right work
[40:30] of faith in a labor of love and God's
[40:32] right at all down on the board amen what
[40:36] is it gold silver precious stone laying
[40:39] on a foundation of love building up to
[40:43] the statue of a perfect man the love of
[40:45] God it's your love for these people here
[40:48] one for the other
[40:49] Paul appear to do that Paul said put on
[40:53] that love put it on so now work of live
[40:57] I was living faith at they had their and
[41:00] a living faith is fruit you see it
[41:02] amen praise God you love him amen praise
[41:08] the Lord how are we strengthened by his
[41:11] spirit in the inner man seated me now
[41:15] the Spirit of Truth the Holy Spirit
[41:19] people that can't understand that many
[41:21] are confused about the message well if
[41:26] he didn't 320 according to the power
[41:28] working in us according to the power
[41:31] against God is able to mold sons and
[41:34] daughters into God now how does he do it
[41:37] God does it by the spirit of his word he
[41:42] plants his seed
[41:44] the Roses spared upon it and brings plot
[41:46] the product brings it forward see his
[41:50] holy spirit transforms the seed word to
[41:55] be vindicated of its character now
[41:59] whatever kind of seed is in the heart
[42:02] the holy spirit was to come the latter
[42:05] rain and throw up on it in the same
[42:09] field weeds and tears the champion wheat
[42:11] and whatever's in the heart that's the
[42:14] only thing that can come out on the
[42:16] outside
[42:17] so therefore the life in the seat meets
[42:20] the life of the Spirit but if the life
[42:23] in the seat is love you can seed fall
[42:27] and when it meets this full token amen
[42:32] full token life that have come down here
[42:36] now
[42:36] to apply it you apply them to it what's
[42:40] in their heart that you'll transform it
[42:42] into a sudden daughter of God you won't
[42:45] have to ask the system to accept because
[42:47] top cutting they had all these things
[42:48] here the love of God brother it'll be in
[42:52] a man and her heart is beating in there
[42:54] because you want to please her Lord amen

[42:58] dresses now aunty Maggie said they'll do
[43:00] it for the love of God you won't have to
[43:03] ask the Brethren to be real brothers one
[43:05] to another they'll do it for the love of
[43:07] God that's a real church that's what a
[43:10] gospel wife that she is because she sees
[43:12] a fear and has the best spirit she says
[43:15] in a whole message if she said drop the
[43:17] play
[43:19] see and so we pray stop it because not
[43:22] us but I'm happy to be associated with
[43:26] you I'm happy to unite paint with paint
[43:30] and staying in this rotgut city here as
[43:34] a testimony amen
[43:36] I stood here for the love of God in my
[43:39] heart I wouldn't move know where they
[43:43] can go to the east can go to the west
[43:45] you go to the south go to the north but
[43:48] the love of God constrains me to hold on
[43:51] he says I got a work for a little while
[43:55] longer there hold still down there amen
[43:58] praise the Lord
[44:00] so we'll hold still the Philistines is
[44:04] ravaging the people up and down the
[44:06] byways amen
[44:09] but we got things we got a ops code amen
[44:13] and by faith we have beat him off of the
[44:16] byways in the highway amen

[44:38] is over us right now is in us moving
[44:42] through it brooding up over bringing us
[44:45] full why his love for people so the Holy
[44:51] Spirit transforms the life in your heart
[44:55] and to a seat of God seat itself see
[44:59] they can only get that bit the seed word
[45:02] drain itself we were shocked when the
[45:05] Cabal lay out see you but now the grains

[45:15] grain itself amen praise God imma prove

[45:24] Spirit transforms a seat that's on the
[45:25] inside of it the man of what current he
[45:27] will transform it so God to recede
[45:32] I was worried there's only one thing I
[45:34] can quick in the word that is the Holy
[45:36] Spirit nothing else won't do it see me
[45:39] now it is the life giver to the word and
[45:42] when the life and the sea meets the life
[45:45] in the word there you see something
[45:46] happen spontaneous combustion amen
[45:50] now the spirit green gives life to the
[45:54] weed to tear shucks all of it see so God
[45:59] took before he could get the real green
[46:02] lines out into the harvest he took it
[46:06] through three steps three stages three
[46:09] processes the world passed through three
[46:13] same steps on a woman passes through
[46:16] three bringing full of life the wheat
[46:19] goes through three and we're gonna come
[46:21] to three but yet there are men around
[46:25] this area and across who says no you're

[46:32] took you out of the third wouldn't put

[47:24] a man can repent of sin he's still
[47:26] thinking of well maybe he's in because
[47:28] immoral man every moral looking woman he
[47:30] finds is still there
[47:31] maybe he's a drunkard every time he
[47:33] smells the drink is still there see but
[47:35] then he gets sanctified that cleanses
[47:38] that desire out of him see it takes the
[47:40] warmth of it away he can still be
[47:42] tempted but it takes to warn of it away
[47:44] still he's not right
[47:45] then he is baptized with the Holy Ghost
[47:49] and fire this was in 64 cleansed burnt
[47:52] out cleaned up and then put in to
[47:55] service of God sanctification only test
[47:59] aside for service and notice just
[48:02] exactly how there comes the message is
[48:03] coming
[48:04] Luther justification West identification
[48:07] Pentecostals the baptism of the Holy
[48:08] Ghost the messages
[48:10] that's so where they can't be no more
[48:13] ages of it see we at the end time three
[48:15] stages baptism cleanses the heart with
[48:17] the Holy Ghost how striking now he takes
[48:20] the place where we are to dwell and
[48:22] through the same process and it's called
[48:24] a church through justification called to
[48:26] sanctification then filled it with the
[48:28] Holy Ghost and fire and he took himself
[48:30] through a prostate he himself the Holy
[48:32] Spirit they can't get there he himself
[48:35] is the Holy Spirit the love but he
[48:38] baptized your heart with his spirit to
[48:41] burn it out then he could come down what
[48:44] is in seed form in there then he comes
[48:46] down with the word then let's see didn't
[48:48] it takes on the word takes on the word
[48:50] he s himself a man's word he is as good
[48:54] as his word so what is G he sends his
[48:56] word down by only one personal profit he
[49:00] says I want you and the Prophet speaks
[49:02] it out that's his word then he himself
[49:04] comes down in manifest himself to you
[49:06] personally he said he would do it what
[49:09] you said here hey man praise the Lord
[49:10] his old very life self-serious wondrous
[49:14] powers he'll do it himself in season a
[49:18] man see so now um page 23 yes
[49:27] Satan was will be taken from the earth
[49:29] just exactly like Satan was taken from
[49:32] you Hittner Amy let us take him now
[49:36] Satan will be taken from the earth just
[49:39] exactly like Satan was taken from you
[49:43] Satan cannot bother he contempt but he
[49:47] can't get a born-again Christian for God
[49:49] from the foundation of the world Paul
[49:51] saw him and sent Jesus to redeem him
[49:53] and the blood speaks for him how can he
[49:55] say when he can't even be seen by God
[49:56] and today they'll come and tell you that
[49:59] you don't have that they've said it well
[50:02] they told me on the phone you haven't
[50:03] got that well maybe he hasn't got it
[50:05] but I know what I have praise the Lord
[50:08] I'm for sweetie nobody fighting away
[50:10] from either okay men against that day
[50:14] that's right and but you see now here is
[50:17] again I just want to say these things
[50:19] that you understand it the baptism of
[50:21] fire watch now on it only is to cleanse
[50:26] it or begin that now he says a baptism
[50:30] of fire to cleanse out the heart to take
[50:33] Satan out cuz thanks avocation Satan
[50:36] still in there now he told you that but
[50:39] when he says the fire had the tub comes
[50:41] in and a little seed in the third stage
[50:45] this is what the Prophet taught see the
[50:50] baptism of fire on it only is to cleanse
[50:52] it and make it a fifth place for his
[50:55] meek to live in see oh like he did us so
[51:00] therefore he takes Satan offered the new
[51:02] millennium kingdom takes it away binds
[51:04] him up then the meat can live there as
[51:07] long as he's there because to influence
[51:08] them plate takes him away and everything
[51:11] is righteousness so then therefore the
[51:14] Christians tumble around he the elected
[51:16] one he takes him out of your heart he
[51:19] can't get in there he's out burned out
[51:23] amen
[51:24] come see before he could become in he
[51:28] had to give us the baptism of fire then
[51:31] the Holy Ghost come in and live dwells
[51:36] in there let Kruk a Christ dwell in your
[51:38] heart by faith amen praise the Lord do
[51:42] you love them well one more restoration
[51:48] of the bradstreet made 76 the fourth
[51:50] light is to come that will bring forth
[51:53] the same science person told me well
[51:56] right now if you have the Holy Ghost
[51:58] why don't you have discerns while I'm in
[52:00] the third stage and I'm going into the
[52:02] fourth day
[52:03] but he said the fourth stage is to bring
[52:05] them the fourth stage concede the a
[52:08] pentecostal with the baptism was the
[52:10] Leaves wasn't the fruit yet and the
[52:13] fruit up on a top of the tree and his
[52:15] shall be lying about the even time to
[52:17] ripen the top of the tree but the fruit
[52:20] in the top is four stages and they all
[52:22] gone up they're trying to figure the
[52:24] early church with this church and they
[52:25] can't they can't get it and they want
[52:27] signs and ones America imma sure you buy
[52:29] this here why you cannot have it right
[52:31] now is against God's nature to have it
[52:34] right now how can you have it when the
[52:37] full light is not there yet the full
[52:39] nature is not to you how do I have it
[52:40] but they want anyway and they blast
[52:43] anybody who say because he got the Holy
[52:45] Ghost see okay
[52:47] watch justification brought back to pulp
[52:50] sanctification brought back the bar
[52:51] doctrine of holiness
[52:53] what brought back the lees Pentecostal
[52:55] or what is the Pentecostal of leaves to
[52:57] clap their hands your rejoicing
[52:58] Pentecost of what the fourth was the
[53:01] word itself the Word made flesh fruits
[53:05] of the fruits of the Resurrection sign
[53:06] that Christ has finally after
[53:08] justification been planted
[53:10] sanctification then the cook planted
[53:12] that does the Holy Ghost
[53:13] all nations died out see Laodicea Christ
[53:17] has again scented himself like to camp
[53:20] on the earth the capstone had come down
[53:23] love hope you get that and you walking
[53:27] into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[53:29] in there is all the mechanics of what he
[53:32] really is take a car and because take it
[53:35] apart why the Prophet has taken apart
[53:37] the word for you to let you see every
[53:39] part of the Holy Ghost it'll do this a
[53:42] me it'll do that it just won't shout
[53:46] will speak and telling us do everything
[53:47] else
[53:47] amen love and peace and joy everything
[53:50] from Genesis all the way through
[53:52] revelation so the master mechanic of
[53:54] prompted
[53:55] has taken apart the Holy Ghost to show
[53:57] you what it really is what he's doing
[53:59] the mechanics of it all you see it right
[54:02] now you follow me frames first line
[54:05] justification sanctification baptism of
[54:07] the Holy Ghost
[54:08] then coming of the camp what is it that
[54:11] Holy Ghost four-inch prophets words

[57:38] light I will restore say the Lord in the
[57:41] fourth stage not the morning of the
[57:43] third day
[57:44] when life appears baptism Holy Ghost but
[57:47] at the end when the science comes see
[57:51] this when he walks in when they finally
[57:53] get together after all the rumors up and
[57:57] down a whole day hey man and they got
[57:59] together an even time and Thomas was
[58:02] neither and they was together and they
[58:05] was on one Accord in there and he walked
[58:07] through the wall he slipped in there and
[58:10] spoke to them and then he talked to them
[58:12] and the thing that he did because he
[58:14] honed them out the living resurrected
[58:17] word open their understanding to the
[58:19] scriptures that right showed mighty
[58:23] committee because infallible proofs to
[58:25] them so did because he dried them out
[58:28] he added to them many things on the
[58:30] scriptures then for about ten days they
[58:33] just dried right out then he sent down
[58:37] the Spirit amen they were just
[58:39] completely dry
[58:40] but the thing about it he himself told
[58:44] them to go to that place so they was in
[58:47] one place but he told me go there they
[58:50] was on one Accord because he told them
[58:52] all that I'll send you the Holy Ghost
[58:54] I'll baptize you with fire so brother
[58:57] they're harvester waiting for that are
[58:59] you wait my bus
[59:00] amen glory to God they were had to every
[59:02] day there was nobody peeping around in
[59:05] prayer they always praying out privately
[59:08] they look nobody off you can feel a
[59:11] spirit when you praying to God and
[59:12] somebody is listening it happened to me
[59:15] all the time before here our brother
[59:16] Kennedy says the brother you were
[59:17] praying and your prayer but brother
[59:19] that's own soul I said what what come on
[59:23] know about him don't know what happened
[59:24] to him I couldn't believe it
[59:26] this is a brother walk up to me because
[59:28] we had a print me know about six years
[59:29] ago and I'm praying it out for this
[59:31] brother different ones my brother asked
[59:33] me what is wrong with him I thought if
[59:36] he was praying pretty lucky he wouldn't
[59:39] hear me amen so I'm only trying to show
[59:43] you they was on one of course they had
[59:46] love they had a dis die in there they
[59:49] wanted that baptism of fire and if we'll
[59:52] then you see nobody amen praise God
[59:56] therefore God said he'll get a bride
[59:58] into one place Christ amen and they'll
[1:00:02] be on one Accord every word they won't
[1:00:05] break the word note that way one could
[1:00:07] be in Europe want to be in Africa on one
[1:00:09] Accord by the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:00:12] and he don't have to pick no certain
[1:00:14] time he can come down in and come up on
[1:00:17] those who are in one Accord on the word
[1:00:19] dot in heavy word amen amen amen
[1:00:21] all across the world no funny doctrine
[1:00:24] Amen but in one place Christ amen on one
[1:00:28] Accord with the word that's why he sent
[1:00:31] the word back because every man will the
[1:00:32] Lord Himself because Begley I see an age
[1:00:34] I'm a possum of profit I'm sore so and
[1:00:36] so that right but he sent a product with
[1:00:39] the word to get us back on one Accord
[1:00:41] those who are elected and they are in it
[1:00:44] right now being dried up amen praise the
[1:00:47] Lord the original life is the word see
[1:00:50] now that life that was in the
[1:00:54] in closing in the blade toss woman husk
[1:00:56] comes out of it the latter rain brings
[1:00:59] it out then when it comes out
[1:01:02] where's it going got to go somewhere it
[1:01:05] goes into the green in the green the
[1:01:07] Warriors on earth a message and it walks
[1:01:10] right into it
[1:01:10] so therefore part of the full life was
[1:01:16] in Luther
[1:01:17] Wesley Pentecostals part of that life
[1:01:20] was in there and that part of eternal
[1:01:23] life Paul prayed for you that you would
[1:01:25] get the fullness of it but you got to
[1:01:28] walk into the word first because he can
[1:01:30] only move by his word and his spirit and
[1:01:32] you got to apprehend it for yourself
[1:01:34] when the angel came because came to Mary
[1:01:36] and told her that God loves you marry
[1:01:39] you highly favored me yes sir just like
[1:01:43] you but you couldn't believe it so
[1:01:45] therefore she knew about Isaiah 9:6 now
[1:01:48] she knew all about it but when that
[1:01:51] spark of faith because it was told her
[1:01:54] you she applied that word to her life
[1:01:57] when she surrendered her will to cook
[1:02:01] and applied it to herself then the Holy
[1:02:04] Spirit that was right there brewed it
[1:02:06] over created God in her womb right there
[1:02:11] the same prophetic message spoken by an
[1:02:14] angel Gabriel we had a prophetic message
[1:02:17] the light come out of the ark up in him
[1:02:19] come down told us that you gonna have
[1:02:21] the same Bulls of God amen
[1:02:23] so surrender to it and the Holy Spirit
[1:02:26] is right now I can prove it brooding
[1:02:28] over you bringing forth its life as it
[1:02:31] cuz well when I read this to you
[1:02:32] amen but now I'm closing justification
[1:02:36] made a way for sanctification
[1:02:37] sanctification made a way for the
[1:02:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:02:41] baptism made a way for the Holy Ghost
[1:02:44] Christ himself love charity Rose of
[1:02:48] Sharon where you walk home come down and
[1:02:51] get into that word all the word and then
[1:02:55] bring it in manifest himself in the
[1:02:57] fourth page signs following it see it
[1:03:00] now friend praise the Lord
