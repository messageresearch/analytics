for that's the thing is saving that's the thing that's brought me thus far that's the thing that help me when the doctor said I was dying that's the thing that's paying an hour of death that's the thing that resurrected me that's the thing I go to heaven with get have to go by cuz I don't know nothing else that and don't want to know nothing else amen right so Jesus and him crucified and that's

amen the ox the man and the eagle and each one is seven is seven spirits and and the seven spirits for the the seven Thunders and therefore and therefore these beasts with the spirit worships God that if the spirit that's in the Beast comes in you what do you do worship God huh you can't worship you must not have the spirit everything fell right before him like that when he made his complete plan when he showed in heaven his plan reveal the seals and showed it they fell down in worship when he took the book here comes a lamb W back in eternity John is John we there's nobody to take the book Hallelujah I'm lost I live a life for Christ on the Earth but I'm lost if somebody don't take that Abstract title de I'm going to say something here it is just come fresh Adam had the book of life but
