[20:26] Hallelujah. My
[20:29] Lord, anything can happen
[20:32] tonight. Oh
[20:35] yes. Oh
[20:37] yes. Anything can happen
[20:40] tonight. You just believe. Forget about
[20:43] who's next to you. Forget about who's
[20:46] sitting behind you. Close your eyes.
[20:50] Lift your hands. Get into your own
[20:54] atmosphere.
[20:56] Hallelujah. I know it was the
[21:00] blood. I know it was the blood. Well, I
[21:05] know it was the blood for me.
[21:10] Lord, one day when I was young, Jesus
[21:16] died and I knew it was
[21:23] enough. And he is coming back
[21:27] again. He is coming back
[21:31] again. He is coming back again for me.
[21:38] There one day when I lost
[21:44] Jesus and I know it was the
[21:49] Lord. Now put your hands together.
[22:01] The Bible says, "Let everything that has
[22:05] breath praise the name of the
[22:13] Lord." Now, as we sing it again, just
[22:16] one more time, turn around and greet
[22:18] your brother and sister. I know it was
[22:22] enough. I know it was enough.
[22:26] I know it was not for
[22:31] me. You see, one day when I was lost,
[22:36] Jesus died upon the cross. And I know it
[22:41] wasn't enough. Oh.
[22:45] Well, now I know it was the
[22:49] blood. I know it was the
[22:53] blood. I know it was the blood for
[22:58] me. Well, one day when I was walking,

[23:43] Blessed be his name. Do you believe that
[23:45] anything can happen? Amen. Do you
[23:48] believe that you can receive a baptism
[23:49] of the Holy Ghost? You believe that the
[23:52] heart is the hardest
[23:54] case can be busted
[23:57] tonight.
[23:59] Amen. The Holy Spirit is all over the
[24:01] building tonight. Anything can
[24:04] [Music]
[24:06] happen. Amen.
[24:08] [Music]
[24:09] [Applause]
[24:11] Lord God, would like to welcome your
[24:14] presence into your building tonight cuz
[24:17] you know you're already here,
[24:21] Lord. And I feel like something good is
[24:25] about to happen. I feel like someone is
[24:27] going to be delivered tonight. I feel
[24:29] like someone's going to be sealed
[24:31] tonight. I feel like someone's going to
[24:33] come to Christ
[24:35] tonight. Oh Lord, I pray that you will
[24:38] bless these meetings. Lord, may you
[24:40] bless the concert tonight. Bless the
[24:42] preaching services and the video
[24:44] service. Lord, may it be such an
[24:46] anointing. Lord, may it be all in one
[24:47] accord, one mind. Oh, one faith. Oh
[24:53] [Applause]
[24:54] my. I pray your sweet spirit come down
[24:58] here tonight, Lord, and stay with us and
[25:00] dwell with us, Lord. Is anyone hungering
[25:03] after God, Lord? Many know where there's
[25:06] a well tonight, Lord. Oh, they thirst
[25:09] after you, Lord. You're here. Oh, they
[25:11] need you. You're here.
[25:19] Blessed be his
[25:21] name. You may be
[25:24] Amen. Blessed be his name. You may be
[25:28] actually remain standing. I'm just going
[25:30] to read a portion of scripture. You
[25:31] don't have to find it. It's 2
[25:34] Chronicles the 20th chapter. Verse
[25:39] 21. And when he had consulted with the
[25:41] people, he appointed singers unto the
[25:44] Lord, and that should praise the Lord,
[25:47] the the praise the beauty of holiness,
[25:48] as they went out before the army, and to
[25:50] say, "Praise the Lord, for his mercy
[25:52] endureth forever." And when they began
[25:54] to sing and to praise the Lord, the Lord
[25:57] said ambushments against the children of
[25:59] Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, which were
[26:03] come against Judah, and they were
[26:05] smitten. Amen. I pray the Lord had a
[26:08] blessing to read the word. You may be
[26:10] seated. Amen. This is exactly what we're
[26:14] going to go on this weekend. We're about
[26:17] to go out into a mighty battle.
[26:21] Amen. In this battle, the souls of many
[26:24] young people sitting here are hinging on
[26:26] the victory or defeat cuz we know we
[26:30] have come to the end of time as we know
[26:32] it. And we're waiting for the coming of
[26:34] the Lord.
[26:38] Amen.
[26:40] Amen. Yet, there are still some people
[26:43] who may be questioning and may be
[26:44] wondering and there's still some people
[26:46] who are seeking the baptism in the Holy
[26:48] Ghost. So, there's a battle that's going
[26:50] to go on this weekend. So, we're going
[26:52] to go out the first night. We're singing
[26:55] and praise.
[26:58] Amen.
[27:02] Hallelujah. Amen.
[27:05] You may be seated. And we know that as
[27:09] we sing and as we praise, the Lord God
[27:12] will send ambushments against
[27:14] the the Moabs and the Ammonites and any
[27:19] other spirit that dwells in the camp.
[27:22] Amen. Blessed be his name. You may be
[27:26] seated. That's why I'm not
[27:29] concerned about the way that you came in
[27:31] here today. It doesn't bother me.
[27:39] Amen. You may be
[27:41] seated. Because as bad as some people
[27:44] may think they are, and as hard as they
[27:48] are, I've seen harder. I've seen
[27:51] tougher. And I've seen them come to the
[27:54] altar with tears streaming down their
[27:56] face. And the Holy Spirit changed
[28:00] them. Amen. And you may be
[28:02] seated. But the only key is that there a
[28:06] seat of God. And that's a choice you
[28:08] have to make tonight. Amen. You may be
[28:11] seated because believe me, I didn't beg
[28:14] anyone to come here. And I didn't call
[28:16] you up at your home. I didn't tell your
[28:18] mama, your daddy, the son, you here.
[28:20] You're here cuz you want to be
[28:23] here. Amen. So, it's up to you whether
[28:26] you let this situation pass you by and
[28:30] go into judgment or you grab a hold of
[28:32] God and go into
[28:34] glory. Amen. Cuz
[28:38] otherwise, Amen. You may be seated.
[28:41] Amen. I'm sorry to get over there, but
[28:44] I'm happy to be here tonight cuz I know
[28:46] you want to be here. I know you're on
[28:48] fire. I know you came here for God.
[28:51] Blessed be his name.
[28:54] Let's be his
[28:57] name. Amen. Amen. You may be
[29:00] seated. I feel the Holy Spirit in here
[29:04] tonight. I can see angels standing
[29:07] around
[29:08] here.
[29:09] Amen. You may be
[29:12] seated. Blessed be his name. I just want
[29:14] to officially welcome each and everyone
[29:16] here tonight. Amen. And I want to
[29:18] apologize. I know the conditions are
[29:20] cramped in the cabin and I know some
[29:23] people have to be in a separate camp,
[29:26] but I want you to know that it was our
[29:27] desire to be able to have as many young
[29:30] people that wanted to be here to come
[29:33] here.
[29:37] Amen. We could have closed the door at
[29:39] 350 or 400, but we knew if there's one
[29:43] soul out there that wanted to be here
[29:45] and they should be here. So, it may be a
[29:49] sacrifice, but one that we're happy to
[29:51] make. Amen. And I know it's crowded in
[29:54] here tonight. I believe every seat is
[29:56] taken. But I can imagine it was crowded
[29:59] when you were in the upper room. And I
[30:02] can imagine it was crowded on Iusa
[30:04] Street and I know it was crowded. We're
[30:07] up in the chapel back up there in 1993,
[30:10] but the Holy Spirit was there. It didn't
[30:13] matter. Amen. You may be seated. And you
[30:17] know what? I kind of like when it's
[30:18] crowded because and the spirits can't
[30:20] hide. They try to hide in the back and
[30:23] the Holy Spirit's back there. They try
[30:25] to hide in the side and the Holy
[30:27] Spirit's back there. Everywhere they
[30:28] look, there's angels. Everywhere they
[30:30] look, the glory of God, nowhere to run
[30:32] to, nowhere to hide. Blessed be his
[30:36] name. We're going to have a service
[30:38] tonight. Amen. The Holy Spirit will
[30:40] sweep out
[30:42] here. Amen.
[30:45] Hallelujah.
[30:46] You may be seated. Blessed be his name.
[30:51] Amen. So, we're switching over tonight.
[30:54] I I know I enjoyed myself today in the
[30:56] activities and I pray that you did. But
[31:00] that's not why you traveled all these
[31:01] miles to be here. That's not why you
[31:03] came from England and France and
[31:06] Trinidad and Puerto Rico and Canada and
[31:08] across the United
[31:09] States. Amen. You came here to meet God.
[31:13] Now, here's your opportunity.
[31:17] Amen. Blessed be his
[31:20] name.
[31:22] Amen. Amen. You may be
[31:25] seated. So, I just want to just
[31:28] encourage everyone and warn everyone
[31:30] that now that we're switched over, it's
[31:33] time to leave the foolishness behind.
[31:36] Time to leave the
[31:37] carnality behind.
[31:40] Amen. I know it's excited to be here and
[31:42] you see different ones and maybe up all
[31:45] night talking and so forth, but it's
[31:47] time now to switch over. I want Amen.
[31:50] It's time now to focus on these things.
[31:53] Amen. Because the Holy Spirit's here,
[31:55] and the Holy Spirit is not just here in
[31:58] this chapel, but he's with you, and
[32:01] you're going to take him back to your
[32:05] room. Amen.
[32:07] So there should be an atmosphere in your
[32:09] room that if someone is ready to be
[32:11] baptized with the Holy Ghost, they can
[32:13] be filled right in the room that the
[32:15] angel feels welcome to open your door
[32:18] and step into your cabin. Amen. So
[32:22] enough.
[32:24] Amen. So it's time to focus. And I
[32:28] believe if you come here with the right
[32:29] attitude, if you come here with
[32:31] desperation, if you come here with a
[32:33] hunger, if you come here with
[32:35] respect for God's servants and God's
[32:38] people and keep the worldliness out and
[32:41] keep the foolishness out, there is no
[32:43] reason that God can't drop down and give
[32:46] you a personal
[32:47] experience. Do you believe that? And
[32:50] give the Lord a hand of praise. And feel
[32:53] free tonight to worship. Feel free
[32:55] tonight to praise because the Holy
[32:57] Spirit is already here.
[33:03] Hallelujah.
[33:04] [Music]
[33:13] Hallelujah. I will praise the
[33:19] Lord no matter what tomorrow.
[33:24] Oh my
[33:28] I know I will praise.
[33:34] Lift your hands to heaven
[33:36] now.
[33:38] I will
[33:40] praise the
[33:42] Lord. Choir, would you come
[33:44] forward? I will
[33:48] praise the Lord.
[33:53] No matter what
[33:57] tomorrow, what it has,
[34:07] it's everybody sing
[34:12] now. I will praise the
[34:15] Lord. Oh Jesus.
[34:29] No matter what tomorrow brings,
[34:33] I I know
[34:35] I will.
[34:40] One more time. Well, now
[34:44] I from your heart now.
[34:49] Oh Jesus high.
[34:57] Oh no matter.
[35:00] It doesn't matter what tomorrow
[35:04] brings. I know
[35:07] I will
[35:09] praise the
[35:14] Lord. Hallelujah.
[35:16] [Music]
[35:17] [Applause]
[35:23] [Music]
[35:25] Hallelujah. Glory.
[35:30] Blessed be the name of the Lord. You may
[35:32] be
[35:34] seated. Amen. How many know that he's
[35:38] worthy tonight? Amen.
[35:44] Amen. Hallelujah. As we were just saying
[35:47] a little bit
[35:49] before, if you can get a picture tonight
[35:51] of
[35:53] John when he was in Revelation five.
[35:58] Amen. And how when he got caught up into
[36:00] that
[36:02] vision and there he was not not there
[36:06] was nobody there that was worthy to open
[36:08] the book or to look upon the names in
[36:11] that book. Amen.
[36:14] But all of a sudden, out of the throne
[36:17] walked a bleeding, bloody lamb.
[36:20] Hallelujah.
[36:24] And I can imagine John as a lamb of God
[36:29] came forth
[36:30] to pick the book out of the master's
[36:34] hand and he opened that
[36:37] book. Mind the screams and the shouts.
[36:41] The Bible says that everyone heard I
[36:43] John on that day.
[36:47] So we just want to give back a little
[36:49] glory to him tonight by singing He's
[36:52] Worthy. Amen. May God bless you.

[46:18] grace to give our daily bread.
[46:24] and

[46:44] You got to be broken
[46:47] down by the
[46:49] seed of his

[46:59] so man cannot
[47:02] live by bread alone.
[47:08] So when the seed is
[47:12] grown, deep inside your heart, you'll
[47:17] find the
[47:20] greatest
[47:22] love that the
[47:25] world has
[47:26] ever
[47:36] known. So Lord, if I'm going to be
[47:41] broken, I'd rather be broken for
[47:46] you. Cuz you have a way of taking broken
[47:51] things, making them just like
[47:54] [Music]
[47:55] new. Lord, I don't mind the pain.
[48:00] just do all that you must
[48:04] do to take me and break me and make me
[48:10] just like
[48:12] you. My
[48:14] father, take me and break me and make me
[48:19] just like you.
[48:28] Oh. So if you're feeling
[48:33] broken, remember the word is
[48:37] spoken. Cuz a broken spirit and a
[48:41] contrite
[48:42] heart will give the Lord a perfect place
[48:46] to
[48:49] start. Lord, if I'm going to be
[48:54] broken, I'd rather be broken for
[48:58] you. Cuz you have the way of taking
[49:02] broken
[49:03] pain, making them just like

[49:26] Jesus. Take me and break me and make me
[49:31] just like you. My Lord, I beg you, Lord
[49:35] Jesus.

[50:18] prayer here
[50:20] tonight. Amen. Take me, Lord, and and
[50:23] break
[50:24] me any way you have to, Father, but make
[50:27] me what you want me to be, Father. I
[50:31] I've done everything I could on my own,
[50:34] and it never seemed to work. Amen. But
[50:38] as the songwriter said, one touch from
[50:41] the master. Amen. It makes a difference.
[50:45] So, as we get ready for our next song,
[50:46] let's sing that song. Spirit of the
[50:48] living God, fall fresh on me. Amen. As
[50:52] our brother Brian cuts makes his way

[52:26] Hallelujah. Yes,
[52:30] Lord. Is that your prayer
[52:34] tonight? Spirit of the living
[52:37] God, fall fresh on me.
[52:41] I believe that's why you're here. That
[52:44] the spirit of the living God might fall
[52:47] fresh on you this
[52:50] weekend. It's a special weekend ordained
[52:53] before the foundation of the world that
[52:56] the spirit of the living God might fall
[52:58] fresh upon
[53:00] us to be in the right
[53:02] atmosphere, an atmosphere of faith, an
[53:06] atmosphere to believe.
[53:09] And in that atmosphere, you can
[53:11] receive whatsoever your heart desires
[53:15] tonight. You may be
[53:20] seated. Just as an introduction to the
[53:23] song that I sing tonight, just a quote
[53:27] that really struck my
[53:29] heart and I pray that it will bless you.
[53:33] Brother Brandham said unto see
[53:35] Jesus, "Let your faith," like the blind
[53:38] man, let your faith, like the woman that
[53:41] touched his garment, stood back out
[53:43] there meekly. She had a consolation. She
[53:46] was in the meeting. She knew that her
[53:49] faith touched him some
[53:51] way. He turned around. He looked over
[53:55] the audience and said, "Thy faith has
[53:58] healed thee. Your blood issues stopped."
[54:01] In other words, she was healed. That's
[54:04] Jesus today. That's him
[54:06] today. Now, let's all softly sing this
[54:09] song, Only Believe, just once. The
[54:12] organist will give us a chord. All
[54:14] right. And he goes and he sings a verse
[54:17] of only
[54:20] believe. He is here
[54:23] now. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[54:25] Christ, I take every spirit in my
[54:28] control for God's glory. for a
[54:31] manifestation of the resurrection of his
[54:36] son. The Holy Spirit is
[54:39] here. Be reverent and know him who knows
[54:44] you and
[54:47] pray. Title of the song I'd like to sing
[54:49] for you tonight is He is
[54:53] here. Do you believe it? Amen. He's
[54:56] here.
[54:58] Praise God.
[55:00] the atmosphere of the Holy
[55:02] Spirit. Anything can
[55:04] [Music]
[55:11] happen. He is
[55:16] here.
[55:21] Hallelu He is
[55:25] here. Amen.

[57:00] hovering
[57:02] all around
[57:05] us. For the

[1:54:04] One day
[1:54:08] soon the
[1:54:10] rapture is going to
[1:54:23] come. Then the battles will be fought.
[1:54:29] And victory
[1:54:32] shall be
[1:54:35] won. Victory shall be
[1:54:42] won. I don't want to be left out
[1:54:47] here. Not
[1:54:49] after
[1:54:51] Jesus is
[1:54:55] gone. Oh no.
[1:55:02] So my prayer is
[1:55:05] in the
[1:55:08] words of this

[1:55:34] want to be
[1:55:36] here. So when that rapture come,
[1:55:40] there'll be nothing
[1:55:43] nothing holding me
[1:55:48] from being
[1:55:52] free. Cuz being left out here is just
[1:55:57] like the sun going down on me.
[1:56:06] Lord have mercy on
[1:56:14] me. Listen.
[1:56:17] The sun shall
[1:56:21] darken and the
[1:56:24] moon shall go down in
[1:56:28] blood. Oh
[1:56:33] Jesus. So sinner man, will you tell
[1:56:39] me where are you going to run?
[1:56:45] where you
[1:56:48] go. Listen to
[1:56:51] me. You may run to the
[1:56:55] mountains and try and
[1:56:58] hide your face. Oh yes you will. Oh yes
[1:57:02] you will. Cuz God said you
[1:57:07] would. But don't you know the rocks are
[1:57:10] going to cry
[1:57:11] out. Ain't no hiding
[1:57:18] place, not down
[1:57:20] here. No.
[1:57:23] Wo. Don't let the
[1:57:26] sun go
[1:57:29] down on me. Don't let the
[1:57:33] sun, long as I search myself, Lord, in
[1:57:37] your word, I want to be.
[1:57:41] So when that rapture comes, there'll be
[1:57:45] nothing nothing nothing
[1:57:49] [Music]
[1:57:59] more. It's just like the sun going down.
[1:58:06] Don't let the sun
[1:58:09] go down on
[1:58:12] me.
[1:58:14] So, Lord, as I search
[1:58:17] myself in your word, I want to
[1:58:21] be. So, when that rapture comes,
[1:58:25] there'll be nothing
[1:58:28] nothing
[1:58:30] holding
[1:58:32] me. I want to be free. I want to be
[1:58:38] but being left down here is just like my
[1:58:43] son down on me.
[1:58:51] Lord have mercy on me.
[1:58:55] I don't want to be left out here. No.
[1:58:58] No.
[1:59:00] Don't

[1:59:52] serious time.
[1:59:57] And we want to be
[1:59:59] sure that everything is
[2:00:04] right. I don't believe anybody in their
[2:00:06] right mind would want to leave this
[2:00:07] place tonight before they made
[2:00:10] everything right with
[2:00:15] [Applause]
[2:00:16] God. Hallelujah.
[2:00:23] If you've never been in a meeting like
[2:00:25] this before, or if you've been going to
[2:00:28] meetings like this for 20
[2:00:30] years, if there's something you need to
[2:00:32] make right with God, there's no more
[2:00:35] time,
[2:00:36] friends. I'll speak
[2:00:39] frankly. There's no more time left. We
[2:00:43] have to get out of
[2:00:45] here. Praise God.
[2:00:48] [Music]
[2:00:52] Oh
[2:00:53] yes, it's time to shake
[2:00:57] yourself. It's time to get down on your
[2:01:01] knees. Hallelujah. It's time to cry out.
[2:01:06] It's time to cry out to
[2:01:09] God and make your peace with them
[2:01:12] because one
[2:01:13] day, one day, the day will
[2:01:16] come when you want to cry out and you
[2:01:19] can't
[2:01:20] anymore. I'm just telling you the plain
[2:01:24] facts. It's not to scare you, but it's
[2:01:27] the truth. The problem today in a
[2:01:30] message around the world everywhere is
[2:01:33] they won't tell the truth.
[2:01:38] Hallelujah.
[2:01:39] [Applause]
[2:01:42] But I thank God I'm where I'm at.
[2:01:46] [Music]
[2:01:59] If the truth hurts, it's only hurting
[2:02:02] your flesh, but it's saving your
[2:02:08] soul.
[2:02:11] Hey, praise him.
[2:02:14] [Music]
[2:02:23] Don't let the
[2:02:26] sun I don't want the sun to go down on
[2:02:29] me.
[2:02:34] That's why I'm searching myself
[2:02:36] now. Cuz in your word I want to
[2:02:40] be and I don't want nothing. I don't
[2:02:44] want I don't need nothing. I don't need
[2:02:47] nothing holding me.
[2:02:53] I don't want nothing holding me down
[2:02:55] here.
[2:02:57] Cuz being left down here is just like
[2:03:01] the
[2:03:02] sun going down.
[2:03:08] Don't let the sun go down on me. Oh,
[2:03:13] don't let the sun.
[2:03:20] I'm going to do what he says to
[2:03:24] Do you want something? Could you need
[2:03:28] something? Just Just holding.
[2:03:32] [Music]
[2:03:37] Hallelujah. Cuz being left
[2:03:41] behind is just like the sun going down
[2:03:47] on me.
[2:03:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:03:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:03:59] Oh
[2:04:01] yeah. Oh yeah.

[2:04:17] Hallelujah.
[2:04:20] And we're going to give you an
[2:04:21] opportunity tonight to make it right
[2:04:23] with God. Hallelujah.
[2:04:27] I want you to turn inward. Look in your
[2:04:31] heart. There's an altar here. If you
[2:04:34] need it, feel free to
[2:04:37] come because God is calling now. Amen.
[2:04:42] And he is not going to call forever.
[2:04:45] But I am so glad, so glad.
[2:04:49] Hallelujah. That I can still hear that
[2:04:52] voice, that I can still feel that Holy
[2:04:55] Spirit moving in my heart.
[2:05:00] Amen. I'll tell you a story.
[2:05:04] There's a story about a little
[2:05:07] boy who went out to go playing, right?
[2:05:10] And his story, it's a true story from
[2:05:13] what I know. He went out down the
[2:05:16] street, 3 years old, and got lost when
[2:05:19] he went out to
[2:05:20] play. And while he was wandering around,
[2:05:23] he began to
[2:05:25] cry. And so the neighbors begin to come
[2:05:28] out and they asked the little boy, they
[2:05:29] said, "What's the matter?" And he said
[2:05:31] to them, "Well, I'm lost. I don't know
[2:05:32] where I'm
[2:05:34] at. And he was so excited he couldn't
[2:05:37] remember anything of a telephone number
[2:05:39] or an address or anything like
[2:05:43] that. So they called the
[2:05:46] police and when the police came, they
[2:05:49] asked him, they began to ask him
[2:05:51] questions about who his parents was and
[2:05:53] so forth. And he was too excited, was
[2:05:56] too upset about where he was at. They
[2:05:58] didn't know he was all frightened and
[2:06:01] frustrated. So they said, "Is there
[2:06:04] anything, oh my, that you can
[2:06:08] remember?" He said, "I can remember a
[2:06:11] white church with a big white cross on
[2:06:13] the top of it."
[2:06:16] And he
[2:06:18] said, "Well, if I could find my
[2:06:24] way back to that
[2:06:27] cross, he said, now I could find my way
[2:06:33] back home."
[2:06:36] He said, "If I could find my
[2:06:40] way back to that
[2:06:44] call," he said, "Now I could find my way
[2:06:49] back home."
[2:06:56] So many of us, so many of us are just
[2:07:00] like that little boy.
[2:07:03] We stray away from home and away from
[2:07:08] God. Amen.
[2:07:12] We can't seem to find a way because
[2:07:15] we're headed in the wrong
[2:07:18] direction. We started to depend on
[2:07:21] material things instead of God for your
[2:07:25] protection.
[2:07:27] Go back
[2:07:31] and repent for all the wrong you've
[2:07:33] done.
[2:07:36] Renew your right spirit within and ask
[2:07:39] God to receive your home. And you can
[2:07:42] say like that little boy, if I could
[2:07:44] find my
[2:07:46] way to that old rugged
[2:07:51] cross, I could find my way back home.
[2:07:57] Hallelujah.
[2:08:01] If you're losing hope
[2:08:05] and find yourself drifting
[2:08:08] away, you need to go back to the
[2:08:11] altar. Fall down on your knees and pray.
[2:08:15] Come on.
[2:08:17] The blood of
[2:08:19] Jesus was shed on
[2:08:23] Calvary so that every man, woman, boy,
[2:08:26] and girl could have life
[2:08:30] eternally.
[2:08:32] Come on to the
[2:08:35] cross. Do it today. Don't don't don't
[2:08:40] wait. Don't wait for tomorrow cuz
[2:08:43] tomorrow might be too
[2:08:46] late. Go back to the cross. Do it today.
[2:08:51] Just like that little boy. Just like
[2:08:53] that little boy. You can say
[2:08:59] Ille. They're coming. Yes.
[2:09:04] You need to come back to the
[2:09:07] cross. He's calling. Oh, we need to go

[2:52:53] have a faith like they never had before
[2:52:55] that they can receive the Holy Ghost and
[2:52:57] they shall be born again.
[2:53:01] Hallelujah.
[2:53:04] Hallelujah.

[2:53:08] Hallelujah. Is he real
[2:53:10] [Music]
[2:53:12] tonight? Amen, Lord. And I pray Lord
[2:53:16] there's anyone here Lord that still
[2:53:18] cannot feel your presence Lord that
[2:53:22] still refuse to accept your grace Lord
[2:53:24] as you so shake them Lord you so convict
[2:53:27] them Lord that they will not be able to
[2:53:30] sleep
[2:53:31] tonight until they know they acknowledge
[2:53:34] that they're in your
[2:53:36] presence because your angel over here
[2:53:38] they cannot deny
[2:53:41] it. Amen.
[2:53:44] Lord, I pray that you bless each and
[2:53:46] every one of the young people here
[2:53:47] tonight, Lord. And may you honor each
[2:53:50] and everyone that came to this altar
[2:53:53] tonight that made an altar at their seat
[2:53:56] tonight, whatever it is that's been
[2:53:58] binding
[2:53:59] them, may it be
[2:54:03] separate. And
[2:54:05] Lord, as we dismiss the people, Lord, we
[2:54:10] can't dismiss his presence. If any feel
[2:54:12] like staying in his presence, Lord,
[2:54:15] you're more than welcome,
[2:54:16] Lord. You're more than welcome,
[2:54:22] Lord. But what can we say,
[2:54:24] Lord, but thank you, Jesus, Lord. Thank
[2:54:28] you for your power, Lord. We thank you
[2:54:30] for the anointed singers that have gone
[2:54:32] forth, Lord. May you bless each and
[2:54:34] every one, Lord, and bless the
[2:54:36] musicians, Lord, and bless these your
[2:54:40] people and continue to pour out on them
[2:54:43] and baptize them and deliver
[2:54:47] them. Lord, we ask these things, Lord,
[2:54:50] in your name, knowing that they shall
[2:54:52] come to
[2:54:53] pass.
[2:54:55] Amen. And
[2:54:59] amen. You may be seated.
[2:55:04] And
[2:55:05] when

[2:55:11] only
[2:55:12] child, your
