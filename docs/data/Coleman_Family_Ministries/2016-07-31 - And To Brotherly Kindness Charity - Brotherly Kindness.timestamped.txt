[2:46] song for me this
[2:48] morning amen the spirit of the Lord God
[2:51] is upon me because the Lord hath

[2:59] Broken Heart
[3:00] to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and
[3:03] the opening of the prison to them that
[3:05] are bound to proclaim the acceptable
[3:09] year of the Lord and the day of

[3:17] mour and brother brandham told us that
[3:21] uh of course uh Jesus started the

[7:41] manifestation of the seven
[7:45] Thunders
[7:48] amen understanding what thou hear
[7:51] us now we anointed now
[7:56] right
[7:58] amen
[8:00] April SEC April
[8:02] 6 uh been very strange season been sick
[8:06] and weary and been uh remodeling my
[8:09] house and my wife and I have been
[8:10] staying over to Jonathan's house over
[8:12] almost two months now just back and
[8:15] forth and so much stress and everything
[8:16] and remodeling and going back and forth
[8:18] and very tired and no time to study or
[8:21] whatever and didn't exactly know what I
[8:24] was going to do and but uh on April 4th
[8:27] the Lord spoke to me and um
[8:30] and told me gave me the message then
[8:32] came Jesus after
[8:33] Easter and then I still didn't know what
[8:36] I was doing just moving by faith then
[8:39] April the 6th on a Saturday uh he spoke
[8:41] to me twice in the morning the seven
[8:44] Thunders or the Seven Virtues Of The
[8:46] Seven Church ages and then it came in my
[8:49] heart I said well now I know that I said
[8:51] what uh does that does it mean something
[8:54] else and then he says and to brotherly
[8:57] kindness add charity for June 9th and
[9:01] that's what he that's what he told me so
[9:04] I didn't know what it meant so uh I
[9:08] believe on one of the messages to know
[9:10] him from the beginning I just said those
[9:11] words I said I'm saying for a purpose I
[9:15] was still looking for the inspiration
[9:18] myself amen so on June 9th
[9:23] 1974 uh brotherly kindness was birthed
[9:27] into us or from from the message and of
[9:29] some have compassion and from June 9th
[9:33] 1974 to June 9th today 1991 is 17
[9:37] years and on June 1st uh just a week or
[9:42] so ago um I was just wondering um what
[9:47] was I supposed to do oh I know what I
[9:49] left something out on May was it May
[9:53] 11th uh just still didn't know what I
[9:55] was what I was supposed to preach and
[9:58] Saturday morning morning he told me
[10:01] Temperance and he showed me I had some
[10:03] notes there and immediately I knew I had
[10:06] to preach patience and godliness but I
[10:10] couldn't figure out where was I supposed
[10:11] to preach godliness at because he had
[10:14] already told me from the 28th of April
[10:17] through June 16th that brother o blade
[10:18] and I were supposed to share eight
[10:20] Sundays to set the captive
[10:23] free be a jubilee for 50
[10:26] days so I'm hoping that some are going
[10:30] free that's what he told me amen that
[10:33] people would go
[10:34] free and so then he did that then he
[10:38] later he tells me on June
[10:40] 1st uh um no he told me that uh uh that
[10:46] I had to speak on uh Temperance and
[10:48] patience but I couldn't figure out where
[10:50] godliness then he told me on Wednesday
[10:52] June 5th so then on June 1st um I just
[10:58] Med meditating like and um the Holy
[11:01] Spirit spoke to me and told me to add
[11:05] another
[11:06] message I said add another message and
[11:10] then uh I said well I didn't think I had
[11:12] to go any further than faith on Easter
[11:14] and then came Jesus virtue and then
[11:17] April 28th knowledge to know him from
[11:19] the beginning so I thought I was
[11:20] finished preaching on the virtues with
[11:22] faith virtue and knowledge and then on
[11:24] May 11th that's what he told me preach
[11:27] on Temperance come and Dy
[11:29] so instantly I knew I had to preach on
[11:32] patience and godliness and June 9th he
[11:34] already told me on April the 6th to
[11:37] brotherly kindness and
[11:38] charity so June 1st he spoke again and
[11:42] said add another message said add
[11:46] another message now I could hardly
[11:48] preach on Wednesday and then he spoke
[11:50] back and says from the scripture enter
[11:53] godliness brotherly
[11:55] kindness he says
[11:57] separated you always preached uh to
[12:00] brotherly kindness a charity two or
[12:02] three times maybe and he says but that's
[12:05] to be separate so preach on brotherly
[12:07] kindness
[12:10] Friday and I did
[12:12] amen how I got in here I don't know but
[12:15] uh I I made it then I had to to today uh
[12:19] get inspiration for today which he'd
[12:21] already told me he said just change a
[12:23] little bit and to brotherly kindness
[12:26] charity just the way it says in the
[12:28] scripture
[12:29] so that's what I'm doing this
[12:31] morning
[12:34] amen so and to brotherly uh into
[12:37] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[12:39] brotherly kindness charity so he says
[12:43] separate and make these two messages
[12:45] thus making me preach eight virtues amen
[12:48] and then going from April the 7th virtue
[12:51] to to charity
[12:53] today
[12:54] so here we are so I had to preach

[25:23] it and seals it as one body praise God
[25:29] amen well Hallelujah on the guide page
[25:33] 16 uh brother BR say what about the Holy
[25:35] goes into church he was speaking about
[25:37] the Instinct of the Ducks to go south in
[25:40] winter time uh when the cold comes they
[25:42] go south to louisian and Texas for the
[25:44] rice and so forth he said what about the
[25:46] Holy Ghost in the church the Instinct
[25:48] you know it ought to lead us from old
[25:50] formalities and uh Creeds and things
[25:53] into a glorious wonderful baptism of the
[25:57] Holy Ghost
[25:58] where there is virtue knowledge patience
[26:00] and guidance in the Holy Spirit now what
[26:03] he's telling you the Holy Spirit himself
[26:05] descended from heaven with a
[26:07] shout and he came in the form of
[26:10] mechanics and Dynamics as promises
[26:12] together and then that was the guide and
[26:16] the prophet released that then that
[26:18] should have led us from
[26:23] 1966 to Virtue and to knowledge and to
[26:25] Temperance and to patience and to godess
[26:27] and brotherly kind
[26:28] and maybe today the Holy
[26:32] [Applause]

[33:55] amen now let's go to my subject
[33:57] amen let's get to my subject here
[33:59] charity anointed Seven Virtues for a
[34:02] manifestation of the seven Thunders
[34:04] wouldn't that be
[34:05] wonderful three questions I want to ask
[34:08] amen I want to answer number one what is
[34:10] the anointing number two how do we
[34:13] receive the anointing and number three
[34:16] After we receive the anointing what do
[34:19] we
[34:22] become
[34:25] amen
[34:28] [Applause]
[34:35] I pause let you think on that now Sila
[34:38] means pause and think on
[34:44] this all right
[34:47] now questions uh Cod book but I have the
[34:51] the old one book two questions and
[34:53] answers the old green series but you
[34:55] pick up in your Cod book I think it's
[34:56] the same page anyway well before we do
[34:58] that now let's nail down the fire4
[35:00] ministry cuz a lot of people say that
[35:02] there is no fire4
[35:04] Ministry in the message let nail down
[35:07] the bride and the church and charity as
[35:09] that which is perfect has
[35:11] come okay and brother BR answered the
[35:13] question so I don't know what is the
[35:14] question what's the confusion Amen on
[35:18] page 87 I've done this before but I
[35:20] think the day maybe to strike home amen
[35:23] now there's many questions here well
[35:25] will the bride will this the church see
[35:27] you can't Divine what they are the bride
[35:30] is the elected of God the church goes
[35:34] through that's the ones that says
[35:37] whosoever will let him come but the
[35:40] bride is elected of God so now you want
[35:43] to get get in before the spirit comes
[35:46] upon the bride and the spirit and the
[35:48] bride say
[35:50] come you want to get in before that
[35:53] because whosoever will let him come and
[35:55] that's a church
[35:58] that goes through a tribulation
[36:00] period so we ain't just coming here for
[36:05] nothing we're trying to get in and be
[36:07] positionally placed cuz you can see
[36:10] what's happening there over in Europe
[36:12] there brother Antony was telling me his
[36:13] father told him that July believe
[36:16] they're getting together on the money
[36:17] and the whole thing uniting and letting
[36:19] Russia come into it in Europe over there
[36:21] so brother things the clock is ticking
[36:24] amen praise God now see that that's the
[36:26] on that says whosoever will let him come
[36:28] but the bride is the elected of God it's
[36:31] elected for the bride to be in here
[36:33] predestinated they're happy to be here
[36:36] they know they're going to be sealed
[36:37] they're not funny and walking around all
[36:39] strange not the bride no they elected
[36:42] predestinated of
[36:44] God they're always the same yes so not
[36:48] in and out up and down they they're
[36:50] there once that light strikes that seed
[36:54] they not going nowhere
[36:57] [Applause]
[36:58] praise God Amen husband and wife sit
[37:02] together Stand Together praise God and
[37:04] they stay together amen praise God now
[37:08] now uh there's five there is these are
[37:11] right in a row Here There is five
[37:13] offices elected of God for God has said
[37:15] in the church Apostles prophets teachers
[37:17] pastors evangelists God did that man has
[37:20] deacons and so forth and everything else
[37:22] but you see uh but God said in the
[37:25] church for the prop of the church can't
[37:27] Divine it a lot of the people the
[37:29] message get mixed up with a Elder app to
[37:31] teach and a real fivefold Minister
[37:34] Pastor they don't know the
[37:35] difference and that's where all the
[37:37] problems come in at see if that man's a
[37:39] p in the fire for ministry that's Christ
[37:41] in there the ministry of
[37:45] Christ not just somebody in the message
[37:47] running around because there's so much
[37:48] knowledge to spout
[37:50] out anybody could preach in this message
[37:53] here amen but the anointing where's the
[37:58] anointing Hallelujah it breaks the
[38:01] yoke upon the
[38:04] people it doesn't bind them it breaks it
[38:11] Hallelujah sets some
[38:13] free because it's Christ in them setting
[38:16] the people free by the
[38:18] word hallelujah you may be seated glory
[38:22] to God can't Define it so we understand
[38:25] it now there is a fire for Ministry
[38:27] well then I can I start my my
[38:29] commission pouring in the
[38:32] virtues do you receive me as a pastor
[38:36] after all 17 years laboring do you
[38:38] believe it's the truth then stay with it
[38:41] praise
[38:42] God
[38:44] Amen okay now the Holy Spirit I'm sing
[38:46] about today now the Holy Spirit when it
[38:49] comes it it it is a witness unto you
[38:53] that this word is right now you had this
[38:55] word for 25 5 Years and we're looking
[38:58] for this Holy Spirit this anointing to
[39:00] come down here today to
[39:03] witness to you that this word is
[39:07] ranked and God confirms his word with
[39:10] signs and wonders and miracles and Gifts
[39:13] of the Holy
[39:14] Ghost Hallelujah the Holy Ghost will
[39:18] testify and you will
[39:20] testify hallelujah praise
[39:25] God he amen now you got it the prophet
[39:29] brought the word with the promise of the
[39:31] Holy Spirit to follow the word and
[39:34] whereever you preach that word by
[39:36] Revelation the Holy Spirit follows that
[39:38] word sing zing zing wherever it goes at
[39:42] somebody block it off it goes right over
[39:43] top of you praise God it goes right
[39:46] behind you in the seat behind
[39:49] you goes right through you praise God
[39:52] you you have no receptacle to hold it
[39:54] amen yay
[39:59] amen you may be seated now the Holy
[40:03] Spirit when it comes it is a witness
[40:04] unto you see that this word is right the
[40:07] word for today not the word for Luther
[40:10] the word not for Moses we witness it's
[40:12] the truth see it's another day that's
[40:15] why we are preaching this here I'm
[40:17] looking for the Holy Spirit to confirm
[40:19] it
[40:21] Hallelujah Now 1 Corinthians 13 says
[40:25] this when that which is perfect is come
[40:27] and I read the scripture that which in
[40:29] which is in part shall be done away with
[40:31] so all these little things are jumping
[40:33] up and down like a kid and trying to
[40:35] talk in tongues and all these other
[40:37] things uh when that which is perfect and
[40:39] here what he says and we do have today
[40:43] by God's help the perfect interpretation
[40:46] of the word with Divine
[40:49] Vindication that's charity that's the
[40:52] word but it come in Dynamics and
[40:55] mechanics and the Dynamics is supposed
[40:57] to confirm to you that the mechanics is
[41:01] right then it's charity that's
[41:04] Christ hallelujah praise God then that
[41:09] which is in part is done away with
[41:11] always little interpretations beside
[41:13] this Pentecostal stuff all these
[41:15] interpretations is done away
[41:18] with in the message Len I think this I
[41:22] think that done away praise finish
[41:25] praise God Amen yes sir praise God
[41:32] Amen when I was a child I speak as a
[41:34] child I understood as a child but when I
[41:36] become a man I put away childish things
[41:37] amen I go to preaching and then don't
[41:39] get to these things yes sir okay now now
[41:42] what now question number one praise God
[41:44] uh what is the anointing what is it amen
[41:49] okay um would you see the church where
[41:51] am I at here uh okay here we are um what
[41:55] is the anointing page 101
[41:58] amen
[42:00] 101 in the book here okay now and now
[42:05] what was that other question I get so
[42:07] wound up in these I forget the things uh
[42:10] what the things were one of them was was
[42:12] I they asked brother Brown was he the
[42:14] son of man here it is I believe the son
[42:17] of man see they can't understand that
[42:19] God could be Veil that Prophet they
[42:21] don't get it you know and not Jesus skin
[42:23] but the the skin from Genesis 18
[42:27] human
[42:28] skinin see they don't get it you see
[42:30] that so they say he is the son of man no
[42:32] the son of man was revealed in him
[42:35] that's what the scripture said so man
[42:37] would be revealed well the Holy Spirit
[42:40] the word it's got to have a body to come
[42:42] into can't come into that piano over
[42:45] there praise
[42:46] God
[42:48] Amen so it came in Malachi for his body
[42:51] amen okay I forget what the uh here it
[42:54] is I believe the son of man or was the
[42:57] pillar of fire the son of man no now
[42:59] watch the pillar of fire is the
[43:03] anointing you got it now and Christ is
[43:06] the
[43:07] anointing amen now now that pill of fire
[43:11] is the logos that went out of God the
[43:15] logos which is actually the attribute of
[43:17] the fullness of
[43:19] God you see this is now we we're
[43:21] preaching and people are going and
[43:23] coming see but what they're doing they
[43:25] don't know see they're rejecting the
[43:28] fullness of the
[43:30] atonement now many in the message will
[43:33] take the atonement in
[43:34] part and you wonder well why don't they
[43:37] do this here why don't they do that well
[43:38] they don't takeing it in
[43:39] part but a Brian is going to take it in
[43:41] his
[43:46] fullness so there's a big difference
[43:49] amen see so
[43:52] yeah and see the attribute you other
[43:55] words you taking all of the
[43:57] logos amen the attribute of the fullness
[44:00] of God when God become into a form to
[44:04] where it could be seen it was the
[44:07] anointing of the great spirit that went
[44:11] forth amen coming down like seven
[44:14] rainbows
[44:15] condescending yes sir coming down God
[44:18] the Father the logos that was up over
[44:21] Israel he was holy could not bear sin
[44:25] there had to be a offering right in Eden
[44:27] then that logos become flesh and dwelt
[44:30] Among Us and where the Loos dwelt in a
[44:33] human body which was the
[44:35] sacrifice
[44:37] amen oh praise God yes sir the pillar
[44:42] fire the L did you pick that up now now
[44:46] Jesus said I come from God and I go to
[44:49] God is that right after his death burial
[44:52] and resurrection and Ascension when the
[44:54] body was taken up to is sit at the right
[44:56] hand of God now I don't mean God's got a
[44:59] right hand God's a spirit but at the
[45:01] right hand means in power and authority
[45:04] of God that in the that name everything
[45:07] in heaven is named after it and subject
[45:10] to it everything in the earth is named
[45:14] after it and subject to it a name above
[45:17] all names Jesus
[45:20] Christ
[45:22] amen now this
[45:24] logos this logos that was in him which
[45:28] was the spirit of God the
[45:30] anointing yes sir through the
[45:33] sanctifying grace of the blood brought
[45:36] many sons of God which is Anointed with
[45:39] the same
[45:41] logos you anointed if you have the Holy
[45:44] Spirit with that same Locos a part that
[45:47] Locos come into your being his being
[45:50] come in you praise God you changed you
[45:53] can never be the same anymore oh
[45:57] hallelujah praise
[45:59] God yes sir now on the day of Pentecost
[46:03] they come down that pill of fire and
[46:05] broke apart like that and tongues of
[46:07] fire set upon each of them not their
[46:09] tongues but tongues of fire set upon
[46:12] them an elected selected group
[46:15] identified by this pill of fire showing
[46:18] that God has separated himself into man
[46:20] do you get it God the logos separating
[46:24] himself into man God not in one person
[46:27] he's in the church
[46:29] Universal amen that's the reason Jesus
[46:32] said the works that I do shall you do
[46:34] more also more now I know the King James
[46:37] versin says greater but the right
[46:39] translation there is more than this
[46:41] shall you
[46:42] do got more bride to do it with God was
[46:47] bottled and confined in one man Jesus
[46:50] Christ but now he's bottled and confined
[46:53] in the whole Universal Church of the
[46:55] Living God
[46:58] I got God in this
[46:59] bottle praise God you got God in your
[47:04] bottles in your wine
[47:06] skins it's is giving you stimulation of
[47:09] the
[47:11] Revelation oh it's soft skins pliable
