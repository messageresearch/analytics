TRANSCRIPT
========================================
for the written word for the reading of the word i am very very very tired tonight but uh the holy spirit told me i had to come in and do this so sophia amen so i'm going to read from saint matthew 5 and saint john 21 and ephesians 4. saint john 5 43 ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son arise on the evil and on the good and send it rain on the just and on the unjust for if we love them which love you uh what reward have ye if ye love them that which love you do not even republicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even republican soul be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect saint john 21 19th verse picking up from where it was before on this 26th of may 18th verse verily verily i say unto thee when thou was young he's still dealing with peter here thou art girders thyself and walketh with thy witness but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and then another shall gird thee and carry thee with thou what is not this fake he signifying by what death he should glorify god and when he has spoken this he saith unto him follow me in ephesians 4 11 and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god and to a perfect man unto the measure of the statue of the fullness of christ may god in the blessing of the word just by his word to pray heavenly father we have read the word of god and now lord may the whole great holy spirit drop down now father to bless the word of god back to the people's hearts and ears father we committed into thy hands in jesus name for a few moments amen and amen and amen praise god [Applause] amen now we're in the word now amen you may be seated now brother norman have a little title follow me and my subject is godliness that's my perfection is be therefore perfect my original inspiration and purpose of calling these meetings and it still is be therefore perfect marriage and divorce page 14 brother bram said usually a revival only lasts about three years but this has been going for it for over 15 years and not one denomination has sprung up from it for this is seed time do you finally understand seedtime everything that prophet spoke is a seed a word huh there's no more shock after the shark is gone is seed god is ready if he isn't doing it now he's going to call a church to perfection listen by his word jesus christ that's why i preach the word jesus christ because that's the only way you will come to perfection amen if you want to come to perfection church do you see how perfection comes number one is by the revealed word for we could read the bible we don't have a prophet to tell us what is revealed for this age what are the popular sins that and then if he tells you all about the rock and roll and all these wild things why would you go back to it doesn't even make sense amen it's not a point of your father mother not being with it or don't understand what the prophet said it's a popular sin it's of the devil praise god run for your life [Applause] you play with your soul amen praise god it's the reveal word that's why you read the prophet's message and then they tell you all about television and all these things in hollywood and all these singers and they're singing for the devil starting with elvis presley and all the rest are singing for the devil why would you look at somebody singing for the devil doesn't even make sense you have a fellowship with satan praise god so do you see that you can't become perfected by that amen see and you get in your car and you turn on and here comes a summary of some record on that's been there at that station there so then you get i get in your car i know what you listen to amen [Music] praise god seeing is by the revealed word back to the bible again to manifest the pride again see the pride in him will be manifested by the bible it won't be because they have books and tapes but because the bible will be living out of them amen they be walking holy holy holy unto the lord hallelujah they will take the world and the things of the world and the wreckage and the music and the rest of the film praise god don't you understand if you have one rock and roll record praise god he's got one drum beat on there that's from africa that's voodoo that's from the devil it is the drum that the devil uses [Applause] [Music] so there all of it is no good because they all use drums can't young people understand that amen praise god you may be seated back to the bible again to manifest the pride again in perfection and my inspiration i told you before i'll say it again i'm trying to bring you to the reality of the presence of christ that you might see him through resurrection faith and know that it is him by his identified promise of this day for this day be there for perfect praise god that's all there is amen on april 7 we preaching on virtue then came jesus april 28th on knowledge to know him from the beginning and it was a visitation to thomas uh to make him know that christ had indeed been resurrected amen and making him declare in so much my lord and my god amen and jesus did many other signs and that was written in this book the scripture says 1974 when i preached the same message i had about six miracles to report and this time i preached i said well i don't have any miracles lord but i'll preach it anyway and he said go and preach it to know him from the beginning but something happened that morning a little testimony around 2 30 today i got a phone call from germany and sister uh stephanie coleman brandon was praying for right here when i preached on knowledge amen and she called me today to tell me that uh god has totally and completely healed them praise god so this is a sign to thomas that god does heal praise god this is a sign to you that was prayed for may 12 and may may 26 you shall be healed hallelujah praise god how could she call me on the very day june 5th you may be seated a sign she was praying for you everybody saw right there amen and uh see his knowledge to know that god cannot lie and acknowledge to know that he does heal hallelujah praise god and sister stephanie was praying for that morning she called me today to tell me that god performed the miracle on her in a healer on may 14 she was having much pain after she was here for no doubt some of you the same condition but she was ignoring the pain fighting it a man just like you and she had to go to the doctor and she said when she got there they said we have the hospital in your bed ready for your operation and before she got there she had been praying that she would get the video again she phoned brother baloma but she couldn't get through with something i wanted to ask for the video but the horizon laid on my heart to send those videos out so she had to go on may 14th at nine o'clock that morning the post came and there was the video [Applause] amen so she just want to hear those words prayed over her again to give her a faint amen to walk into the doctor so she heard it the tape arrived and then it got to the doctor there and the nurse said now we uh wait a minute we have to put you in but we haven't examined you for for quite a while so you have to be uh re-examined tomorrow may 15th and then they re-examine her in the x-ray shows black spots and then small several small ones and she had much pain and then there's a wheel schedule the operation june 5th and then we'll give you some antibiotics or whatever she took a few of those and she said it made her sick so she just stopped taking them and she just trusted god amen so today she went to the doctor and she was so excited the doctor couldn't find one trace one trace of a black spot anywhere in her body she was totally completely healed by the word of god spoken on april 28th and so are many of you healed by the word of god spoken on may 12 may 26 so your minds will enter into your healing hallelujah say i am healed thank you jesus i am going to receive the holy ghost thank you jesus hallelujah whatever you come through that line and whatever you ask for praise god that's what you shall receive amen praise god god be praised amen our sisters rejoicing but she fought for her healing and god healed the praise god all he could do for you the same he's the same yesterday today and forever praise god hallelujah you may be seated everything every problem was completely dissolved and it's all gone the doctors were amazed and there was the x-rays and but there was the person healed by a miracle of god amen so thomas uh that should help you praise god on that very day when the holy spirit was preaching to you to make you say my lord and my god amen god totally had america on the same morning but it had a span of time miracle some are instant miracles but some a span of time amen maybe yours a span of time but once that demon has been cursed it is cursed yeah praise god amen you may be seated so it was done for thomas and he might believe in may 12 coming down the master called jesus was standing there in the fourth verse i believe and they didn't even know it was him and i don't believe the handful know that jesus standing here now praise god i don't even believe that that they would believe that jesus dragged in here tonight for a specific purpose to make a point i don't believe they even believe that amen hallelujah you should be on fire you should be shouting a prison god thanking the lord because you're going to be healed anyway praise god you're going to be sealed hallelujah glory to god love us now me praise god do you now believe that jesus the son of god appearing right among us and giving out life through his name hallelujah you may be seated let's strike our text right away here saint john amen the 18th verse okay follow my my text is uh my title is follow me until we talk about jesus now follow means follow after uh to be a follower or companion or likeness uh number two in the dictionary says way hence one going in the same way follow me his way means expressed in the union in saint john 21 18 very very i say unto thee when i was young without good as myself took your own self and walker's wither thou was you did what you wanted to do whenever you wanted to go you went to you went fishing you put on any kind of music you want to put on no doubt praise god yes sir who won't tell you anything different hallelujah parents can't tell you praise god amen you slide around the ministry yes siree praise god amen you think god don't know what you're doing amen amen you do what you want to do and when you witness but when thou shalt be old listen to the holy spirit prophesying to peter who doesn't even have the holy ghost who failed them many times but yet he's going to use them amen praise god why because he's predestinated so don't you sit there and cast away your confidence praise god because you failed god misery so many times hallelujah cast not away there for your confidence god is able right now to seal you and fill you praise god hallelujah glory may be seated so you went where you wanted to do did what you wanted to do but he's prophesying now but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee with her with our waters this speak he signifying by what death he should glorify god and when he has spoken this he says unto him follow me prophesied to him told that you want to die for me upside down praise god and you want anything to do with it now i tell you peter follow me [Applause] when you follow me i open your understand through the scriptures i'll pour out the holy spirit on the 50th day and seal your way praise god and you'll live a life for me peter how many pears do we have in here praise god amen may be seated so we see now a prediction of the kind of death he would glorify god with was pronounced upon him and death another would take him to where he would not desire to go to death and the grave amen praise god and godliness now is the sixth virtue follow me the acceptance of this commission was to prove costly you got to give up something now praise god this led to a physical movement but much more is implied peter was being summoned to on deviating faithful walk undeviating praise god hallelujah to set his face as flint even as jesus had done in view of the approaching cross and follow use of a servant soldier or pupil following their leader even to death this statement no doubt a relieved peter showing that christ was not going to make any more predictions of his weakness and failure because he had failed god so many times and he was feeling that the lord was kind of you know hitting them kind of hard there but when he told me he won't die for me oh praise god man then peter was happy then to know that the lord had to prove to him throughout the lord loved him you know the lord all the time never looked down on him one time never thought lowly of him it was peter thinking lowly of his own self right now tonight god don't think lowly of you praise god god has you way up here but you have yourself way down there so praise god get rid of yourself forget about what you say take what he says of you not what you feel about yourself amen praise god hallelujah you may be seated two things he was commanded to do amen peter was asked to identify himself with the word he was uh being asked to be like god to be like christ follow me what a calling in life and talk and walk even in death so where does amy grant come in here with all these rock and roll singers coming in what time do you have for them praise god when you are supposed to be home out in westbury out here and there following christ gathering together praise god around the tapes singing with joy the christian songs there is a fountain filled with love that ain't old-fashioned praise god it'll bring down the power of god and baptize somebody in there but amy grandchild won't bring out it'll bring the devil in there praise god the mariah will bring the black mariah right up there for somebody dead praise god yes sir hallelujah glory to god amen follow him in life and talk and walk in death be amen identified may be seated saint mark 8 34 whosoever will come after me and let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me that's that sixth virtue colonies amen number one is where you become like christ number two be therefore perfect identifications in three phases with christ's cross now the first thing the christian comes to the cross and there he sees himself a sinner mary sees with a vision in christ on the cross and the blood streaming down for him and what christ did for him that he identifies christ identified with him by calling him and telling them what he did for then he identifies back and say i'm selling out to the world i want to be like jesus hallelujah glory glory to god amen that's what christianity is all about to deny yourself to deny the world to deny the things of the world and set out and be like jesus to be like jesus hallelujah amen may be seated praise god and then when you go through that you're born again and then number two then you see yourself on the cross get up on the cross and hang there praise god when all your friends from the office come around when all your old cronies come around hang on that cross praise god amen don't be afraid don't be a little chicken living something praise god be barely be take a take a stand for god on the cross in your office once you're with your family wherever you are hallelujah oh praise god talk about a hallelujah talk about a glory to god amen now he may be seated then he's number two number one you come to the cross you act not with a revelation what he did for you then you die and you're baptized and everything else and no more in the world no more you want to hear about it see no evil hear no evil don't try to reason out evil praise god you only want to hear him praise god amen number two he sees himself on it for christ died in my place that in the sight of god it was i who died amen galatians 2 20 i'm crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet ned i yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i i now live in the flesh i live by faith of the son of god who loved me and who gave himself for me that's christian that's the message therefore by seven thunder revelation i see myself in the pyramid dying out to myself in the pyramid praise god and these virtues come in in a lie and made by an experience a death of a corner wheat seventh under knowledge lets me know that christ's very own nature is coming into me and the old man is dying and the new man's living put on the new man hallelujah this is an inward experience something happens on the inside like tonight praise god many in here are catching a revelation what i'm talking about in here yes siree this is an inward experience in the nature to which the the outward man's life is conformed to that inside the experience makes his outside flesh conform to the inside to the experience on the inside and not the one on the outside so don't take an experience on the outside and look at her look at this look at him and then make the inside conform to that by going after it amen but do the opposite praise god to your flesh praise god to conform to the inward work in your life by the word of god and by christ the holy spirit coming into you to change you into the image of jesus christ from glory to glory to glory to glory to glory hallelujah praise god amen you may be seated it's an identification and number three the final stage romans 8 14 for as many as led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god now the identification on the third phase that's adoption place in christ and only a few will walk in christ's footsteps now identification one and two is for you you come to the cross baptism of the holy spirit you're born again with the new birth that's fine that's wonderful but you're just getting started way down in faith amen then number two you're on the cross praise the infertile comes into you on the cross parallel comes into you for service to stay on that cross hallelujah every day on your job and where you are with power power knowledge praise god temperance patience hallelujah you're dying and you're coming like christ amen all your world desires are dying out you may be seated amen now on the cross hanging on that cross you're being tooted you're being child trained you're being sanctified you have behavior you do things that's right amen you don't sash your parents back and try to reason something out hallelujah gloria add to your faith amen virtue and knowledge and tempers and patience and god and brotherly kindness which is what you're supposed to be doing now then number three uh of the identification number three is you carry the cross you come off of that cross where you stand from faith to brotherly kindness and all of a sudden the capstone comes down and you catch the capstone and you come down from the cross you pick up the cross you put it on your back and you become a crossbar and then you walk in the bloody footprints of jesus christ the world is long long gone praise god and amy grant and the moriah and all these things is gone these little sneaky little wreckage is all gone and so forth and take dicks and whatever finish finish you're going after the lost sheep in god's kingdom thus saith the lord keep still now therefore give me my mountain praise god what a message right in here you didn't even know what to pray for holy spirit use your servant to tell you what to pray for now therefore give me my mountain praise god amen hallelujah glory to god brother branham preached many things but you go to brother branham's promises and say brother remember i want the promises the real ones amen adoption perfection to be like jesus like you are that's what i want this is my mountain i want the mountain where the annex are i want the mountain where it means divine fellowship like with abraham hebron praise god place of fellowship that was a that was his mountain he wanted fellowship with god and he had the hardest task of all he had to drive out the three sons of anna he had to drive the giants in the message off of the mountain press god hallelujah he wasn't afraid and he was the only one to drive the philistines off the mountain if you read the book of judges no other israel tribe drove out the philistines [Applause] only caleb who followed the lord holy that's why he preached what he preached only caliph will be able to turn out the philistines the bible says so in time and so says the bible today so your mind will forget about everything else praise god and follow me says the lord hallelujah glory you may be seated yes siree amen the third phase it's not for you it's for others you had yours in the second phase when you were being filled up with faith and virtue and knowledge and quippings and power i mean oh my god that was yours and then god seal those virtues in you then you go out to others it's not you no more it's jesus christ going out this lost sheep in the message don't you want to do that huh don't you want to be a tool for the harvest oh glory to god [Applause] don't you want to be a prisoner to the lord glory may be seated christ the corner we you're going it's for others the lord's sheep saint john 12 24 verily verily i say unto you accept the corner weak fall on the ground and die it bites alone no death no fruit but if it die in the second stage on the cross it brings forth much fruit in the third phase going after the lost adoption time so make it be mine when you're gonna die praise god you gotta die now brother you can't hang around that first stage no more i received the holy ghost 1988 or 89 fine but where you going now praise god amen and your life tells what you are now now your desires your unholy desires tell what you want now and you're supposed to have the holy ghost with unholy desires hallelujah you better go back to the altar praise god amen you may be seated amen now amen third early bride followed jesus paul followed jesus the other messengers followed jesus they were called crossbacks because they took the cross even so much they wanted to be identified they picked up a cross and carried it so the whole world could see where they were identifying with it and here we sneak around the office and sneak around trying to say prayers sinners so i'm afraid to pray in front of the sinners praise god and let alone pick up a cross and walk in the wrestling with a cross on your back praise god huh or walk in your office with a cross they say get that nut out of here put him in creedmoor praise god amen praise god well you're still with me huh gloria amen i ain't got my strength but i'm trying to nail it down to you the early brian paul all the other messengers malachi 4 on his third tour what did he say he says it's not for me paul when he had the accident and billy paul said daddy you got the spoken word speak the word he could have spoke the word and he'd been living today he says it's not for me paul [Music] it's for the church yes sir and we can't die to something my god is for others and oh my [Applause] glory glory full stature 104 fruit adoption going after the losses for others saint john 15 7-8 amen he abideth in me and my words are by him he shall ask what you will and hereby is my father glorified when you bear much fruit oh hallelujah you want to glorify the father praise god say matthew 5 48 this speaks about be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now this means not you cannot be perfect sinless doesn't mean man it means growth into maturity of godliness not sinless perfection because peter was perfect and he made a mistake over in the book of acts this is correct and paul had to straighten them out but he was still perfect in god's sight because they was in perfection they were following jesus amen it's the father's business amen uh and that's the point in the sermon on the mountain see the the sun shines on the evil and the good the rain falls on the just and the unjust but what uh christ is bringing out here it is the father's this point that is the point in the sermon on the mountain see god chooses to shine the sun on the evil and the good on both and the sun falls on the just and the unjust be perfect complete in conformity to god's laws amen amen and christ brings us to perfection on the seventh step and we are broken in spirit we are meek we are humble we are burned for others we are merciful we are hungry for righteousness we are pure in heart we are wise we are patient we are loving we are joyful we are gracious and charitable navally and god like in society hallelujah praise god do you know what i'm talking about now amen in other words follow me the word and be like god be there for perfect there's your sixth virtue godliness and the seventh step of course is probably kindness and that just reveals the father's kindness through the adopted son because to brotherly kindness a charity has been added do you understand on this sixth one where you could become like jesus you don't want to come out tonight it's where you die out praise god and then he will take you off yes no my man is six number six is man and you come up to number six god is in you're dead number seven is god's domain and when you're dead you can walk up to his seventh step and it's no more you it is christ in you the hope of god [Music] you jesus moving your feet amen saint john 5 19 i do not nothing except the father show me praise god go over here go over here thus saith the lord do this do that brotherly kindness let the sun shine on the evil on the good forgive them how many times father 70 times 7 i forgive you for that hallelujah praise god amen so three steps across in self-denial speaks of readiness to suffer for someone else and christ is the pattern amen identification second step on the cross brian will mature and her rightness shall be in identification with her lord by means of the word there you are follow me holy holy holy unto the lord is your daily walk christ brings us to perfection on the seventh step [Music] hallelujah praise god yessiree got one quote to read here amen statute for perfect man page 43 amen he speaks here okay now fifthly add godliness oh my godliness to be added what does goddess mean i looked in four or five dictionaries and couldn't even find uh what it meant finally i was down here brother jeffrey's here we found a dictionary godliness means to be like god oh my after you've got faith and virtue and knowledge and timbers and patience then to be like god it's number six it's just telling you because number seven is just a manifestation of the father's kindness that's all what it is because in that age the prophet brings all the mysteries for you to be like jesus is on the seventh step the seven requirement amen forgiveness and dropping oughts and things see why if you don't drop yourself you don't forgive you can't you're not even nowhere you're not even in the church not even the message that's in this church if you can't forgive and forget you're not even in this message you're only wasting your time in god's time hallelujah [Applause] praise god amen i won't be wrong with you tonight amen just drive down a few tanks to the church amen godliness means to be like god you know why because i know the holy spirit is going to pour out and i know that somebody is going to take this tonight hallelujah somebody is going to be sealed out of this group here of godliness tonight amen surely you should know what's going on around here praise god can't you count to know what's going on what i'm doing all over again 74 right in front of you [Music] i mean didn't the prophet say one day we'll take these words and preach on them [Music] but he never did what then came jesus is jesus preaching on the same words that the prophet wanted to preach on this ain't no play thing here tonight brother we making spiritual church history something is happening something is moving hallelujah something is being set in motion tonight somebody's gonna catch it tonight hallelujah glory to god you may be seated a man godliness means to be like god oh my after you've got faith virgin knowledge tempers patience then be like god there it is again number six that's man that's who you got to die out to number six be like what a challenge what a death [Applause] it's right here tonight this is the one you say i can't do that brother branham oh yes you can [Applause] the prophet just answered some of you tonight say i can't make it amen let me uh just read to you a few scriptures here just a minute matthew 5 48 i took it for text we'll take this one see what it sounds like matthew 5 48 and see if you're supposed to be like god you know what the bible says your gods jesus said so why all the things that are in god are in you matthew 5 48 be jesus speaking in the beatitudes be therefore p-e-r-f-e-c-t perfect uh what's that perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect amen you you got way up here now before you have to do that all these things have to be added first and then we got up here he's asked you now to become perfect godliness sons and daughters of god that's right how many things i can say along that line now watch him do something here let's turn to ephesians and find over here in the book ephesians says about this thing too about how we should do uh ephesians fourth chapter and begin with 12 verse ephesians 4 and begin with 12 verse all right let's begin up here in the 11th verse and he gave someone that's why i read it and he gave some apostles and prophets remember last night don't try to take the other man's office some advantages some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of god does it read like that perfecting what saints who are the saints the sanctified ones amen trying to get you sanctified tonight the ones who started from down here perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry now here it is the ministry of jesus christ for the edifying of the body of christ for the edifying building it up in a firm until we all come into the unity of faith and of the knowledge and of the son of god until perfect man unto the assurance oh my unto the measure of the statue of the fullness of christ see how he's jumping this five four minutes he's right in here now he said the ministry of jesus christ so why would he tell like he told them follow me amen they turn around and tell you the same thing and the prophet's gone and where's the holy spirit he the holy spirit will be in the five-fold ministry then he'll tell you to follow the five-fold ministry amen as they follow christ praise god amen do you understand why that's why he connected it in it's going to be now watch and here's my little subject here perfect takes godliness there you are you can't become perfect before you get some godliness totally impossible you have to add to your faith godliness see you start off down here with virtue then you like to go to knowledge and go temperance and patience now you're on god and it's godliness oh my our time is getting away so is ours but you know what god is meant you sing a song to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i long to be like him all through life's journey from earth to glory i only asked to be like him that's godliness amen when he was smitten on one side of the face he turned the other one when he was spoken rough too he didn't speak he didn't rile back see godly always looking for one thing i always do that which pleases the father yes sir that's godliness my not acting nasty to your parents and and straightening out somebody in the flesh i always do that which pleases the father not that camping somebody back camping and rest of the laughing hallelujah die to that prison that made the flesh feel good hallelujah it didn't make christ feel good the holy spirit was grieved away from your fellowship praise god oh hallelujah so now malachi 4 ties perfection into godliness you got it be there for perfect then down through the prophet's message faith virtue knowledge tempest patience i'm trying to be perfect then all sudden boom he ties it into godliness aha this is how i become perfect now to be like him oh glory to god i got revelation now to be like him because temperance i it's self-control i don't want to hurt nobody i still ain't like him here because if many in the world could do that and uh patience well then uh i don't care what they say about me that's all right well there's a whole lot of people like that too sure i mean but we need to be like god there's hardly anybody like that oh i said six thunder praise god may it thunder down in your souls tonight hallelujah perfect that's godliness [Music] praise god yes sir [Applause] yes glory may be seated then he ties ephesians 4 11-13 another ephesians into godliness by the fireform ministry bringing the bride to a perfect man that's what he said there the fire for men they were they'll be here on to the for the knowledge and unto the statue of a perfect man is tied in through godliness it's gonna be here right shortly too somebody's gonna be manifested right in front of you it's god to lead you right on up the ladder hallelujah praise god glory then he says on page 44 perfect perfect takes godliness these things to be like jesus and turn the other cheek and so forth pianist organist amen don't rile back i'll always do with please as a father be there for perfect then follow me to perfection you know you don't want to take those blackberry feathers and whatnot he said here he said oh my he says see after you page 45 after you done come from here to here to here to here to here and you come into the full statute now of a son of god but you have to have this plus all this you can't even start until you get this now remember the black bird with peacock feathers don't forget him see don't try to add it to you actually born again because it won't
