[0:53] morning if you're weary and tired and
[0:55] you have to go I have a message up on my
[0:57] heart and I don't even know what it is
[0:59] so you may just clip out as I wait until
[1:01] this burden has has left my
[1:04] heart you right now in the scriptures
[1:06] Romans
[1:07] 13
[1:09] um verse 8-
[1:12] 14 and Ephesians
[1:16] 4
[1:19] 14-6 and Colossians
[1:22] 2 4-7 I'm reading from um Romans
[1:28] 13 the eth
[1:30] verse Oh no man anything but to love one
[1:34] another for he that loveth another hath
[1:37] fulfilled the Lord for this thou shallal
[1:39] not commit adultery thou shall not kill
[1:43] thou shall not steal thou shall not bear
[1:46] false witness thou shall not covet if
[1:49] there and if there be any other
[1:51] commandment it is briefly comprehended
[1:53] in this saying namely Thou shalt love
[1:55] thy neighbor as thyself love worketh no
[1:58] ill to his neighbor
[2:00] therefore love is the fulfilling of the
[2:02] law and that knowing the time that now
[2:05] it is high time to awake out of sleep
[2:07] for now is our Salvation nearer than
[2:10] when we believed the night is far spent
[2:13] the day is at hand let us therefore cast
[2:16] off the works of darkness and let us put
[2:19] on the armor of light let us walk
[2:23] honestly as in the
[2:25] day not in rioting and drunkenness not
[2:29] in a chambering in in wanness lewdness
[2:33] and everything else see not in strife
[2:35] and envying but his because the
[2:38] admonition but put you on the Lord Jesus
[2:41] Christ and make not provision for the
[2:45] flesh to fulfill the lust
[2:49] thereof and Ephesians
[2:52] 4 we in Sund school this morning now
[2:55] that we henceforth be no more children
[3:00] children tossed to and fro and carried
[3:02] about with every wind of Doctrine by the
[3:04] slave of men and cunning craftiness
[3:07] whereby they liy and wait to deceive but
[3:11] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[3:14] into him in all things which is the head
[3:18] even Christ let me say it again now
[3:20] here's my burden right here but speaking
[3:23] the truth in love may grow up into him
[3:27] at all things every Point everything in
[3:29] your life may finally grow up amen which
[3:33] is the head even Christ and he is the
[3:36] word from whom the whole body fitly
[3:39] joined together and compacted by that
[3:42] which every joint supplieth see
[3:45] according to the effectual working in
[3:47] the measure of every part each each one
[3:49] has a measure and you supply it to the
[3:51] body see uh making uh uh measure of
[3:55] every part Mak an increase of the body
[3:58] until the Ed of itself in
[4:02] love and
[4:04] Colossians 2 4 and this I say lest any
[4:09] man should beguile you with enticing
[4:12] words for though I be absent in the
[4:15] flesh yet I am with you in the spirit
[4:18] joying and beholding your order and the
[4:21] steadfastness of your faith in Christ as
[4:24] you have therefore received Christ Jesus
[4:26] the Lord so walk ye in him rooted and
[4:29] built up in him and established in the
[4:32] faith as you have been taught abounding
[4:35] therein with thanks given as a memorial
[4:40] to William brandham the prophet of God
[4:43] verse 4-7 this morning is a memorial to
[4:47] him for he is the one that taught us
[4:50] amen he is the one that's not here in
[4:52] flesh but he's here in
[4:54] spirit for he sold these this message to
[4:57] us which is here now amen and that he
[4:59] might be able to withhold our joy and
[5:02] our steadfastness and all these things
[5:04] so it's a memorial to his message this
[5:06] morning may the Lord add a blessing to
[5:08] the reading of the word shall we bow our
[5:10] heads for a word of prayer our gracious
[5:13] Lord as we stand here Lord trembling on

[8:03] heated up in my own spirit for one time
[8:07] Jeremiah was ready to go you give him a
[8:09] commission and but he got so mad at the
[8:12] people he was in the heat of his own
[8:14] spirit and you let him sit there and
[8:16] wait and then when his own Spirit had
[8:19] cooled off then you sent him by the
[8:21] spirit of the Lord so Heavenly Father
[8:23] may my own thoughts my own ideas cool
[8:26] off Lord and may it be a true holy ghost
[8:30] anointing coming out and I know if it's
[8:32] the Holy Spirit anointing that then
[8:35] nobody will get mad they'll be glad
[8:37] they'll be happy Lord and we'll reap a
[8:40] crop this morning for this coming forth
[8:43] seven Thunders oh God the revelation of
[8:46] it if they're not they're still babies
[8:48] they'll never even hear it Lord and I
[8:50] pray that they will grow up today Lord
[8:52] if they can't even stop these little
[8:54] things of the the sins of the flesh how
[8:57] can they go into the Eternal C of the
[9:00] Loos that's wanting to come and reveal
[9:04] these mysterious things to bring on that
[9:06] Rapture and Grace oh God the hour is
[9:10] here I don't know about around the world
[9:12] but I'm only going by the barley in New
[9:14] York and this is pulsating in my heart
[9:17] and I got to say that there be no more
[9:19] children I believe the hour is here to
[9:22] reap so Heavenly Father may you give the
[9:25] witness drop a real reverence in our
[9:29] midst now Lord May that silliness
[9:32] disappear or that's brother Coleman may
[9:35] they realize this is not brother Coleman
[9:37] this is the word of the Lord going forth
[9:39] Lord may they not be fearful of
[9:42] me may they not look at me Father you
[9:44] don't want to looks into their hearts
[9:46] not me I can't see I'm not in their
[9:48] homes I go to my own home and try to
[9:50] take care my own business Lord may they
[9:53] understand not to serve me as a men
[9:55] pleaser but may they serve the Living
[9:58] God with reverence and fear he's the one
[10:01] that knows their thoughts are registered
[10:03] in heaven right now and you the one that
[10:06] watch them in their jobs in their homes
[10:08] or wherever they go at not me Lord may
[10:09] they finally realize that it's not
[10:12] brother Coleman it is the spirit of the
[10:15] Lord may they grow up today Father we
[10:18] pray and we ask this in Jesus name and
[10:20] his sake amen you may be
[10:25] seated I like the Tyler's thought be no
[10:28] more children
[10:30] and as I said here this uh terrible
[10:33] thing on my heart and I and then you see
[10:37] how I hate to see somebody taken
[10:38] advantage of that's the way I was born
[10:41] and when I was a kid I'd see gangs beat
[10:44] up a a little fellow that had wandered
[10:46] out of his neighborhood over in the uh
[10:48] because down in Harlem there at the old
[10:51] polar ground
[10:52] ballparking we to live around there and
[10:55] I see kids wandering around and and then
[10:58] little boys stealing things and beating
[10:59] them up that used to always bother me
[11:01] and the Army the same thing and so
[11:03] therefore that's in my nature I don't
[11:05] like to see uh somebody harmm somebody
[11:08] or take advantage of that person and
[11:10] then being called and saved and and
[11:13] called to the ministry from the onet I
[11:16] saw the devil amen and all his workings
[11:19] and his uh cunningness and sless to
[11:23] deceive God's people oh it's all right
[11:26] and get them all at ease in Zion and
[11:29] down in their sins and you can do this
[11:31] and you can do that always showing them
[11:33] what you can do see always get them
[11:35] license where you can do this it's all
[11:37] right after all when I see that spirit
[11:39] that looks for the things that that they
[11:41] can do I mean I'm looking for the spirit
[11:44] that want to know Lord to look in my
[11:46] heart and clean me out that I don't want
[11:48] to do not the what can I do to get away
[11:52] with it in the church and long as
[11:53] brother com don't see it's all right no
[11:55] long as God is looking at it I'm just
[11:57] here preaching the word of the Lord
[11:59] see so in view of the coming of the Lord
[12:03] um this morning's exaltation is to be no
[12:05] more children is to grow up in Christ
[12:07] and all things and we are reminded that
[12:10] in the The Ten Commandments um the first
[12:14] four as God spoke no other gods no
[12:17] graven images don't bow yourself down to
[12:19] them don't serve them don't take the
[12:22] name of the Lord in vain and see all the
[12:24] things going on today it almost kills me
[12:28] to hear these people say holy Christ or
[12:31] Jesus Christ that just tears me apart
[12:34] they don't even know what they're saying
[12:36] and you know how they just say it with
[12:38] cursed words and take his name in vain
[12:40] like it ain't nothing see and the first
[12:42] four of the Ten Commandments shows your
[12:45] attitude toward God and the last six of
[12:49] the Ten Commandments shows your attitude
[12:51] towards your neighbor so it's four to
[12:54] God and six to man you see that now four
[12:57] to God and six to man see and Jesus he
[13:00] condensed them into two and and he says
[13:03] uh uh uh in St uh Mark 12:28 and they
[13:07] ask him about the uh the great
[13:09] commandment he says uh it's the love the
[13:11] Lord thy God with all their heart soul
[13:13] and mind and to love your neighbor he
[13:16] made 10 into two and then he even gave a
[13:19] new commandment he said I give you a new
[13:21] command you love one another he knowing
[13:25] that God was going to be in him on the
[13:27] day of Pentecost and then the two would
[13:30] be one for how can you love God if you
[13:34] don't love your brother whom you see and
[13:36] you never even seen God and Paul summed
[13:39] it all up to love as he said over here
[13:41] in in Romans here to Romans 13 here he
[13:45] says love is the fulfilling of the Lord
[13:48] and so we have this new commandment here
[13:52] and just as it strengths me now I don't
[13:54] know how I got a lot of notes here but I
[13:56] just want the Holy Spirit to move this
[13:58] morning on the word word amen and I was
[14:01] getting a blessing in the car this
[14:02] morning as as we had Jo in to read this
[14:04] scripture in the car cuz on my heart now
[14:07] if you want to know what how we should
[14:09] be in the church today you should read
[14:11] Romans 12 to present your bodies amen I
[14:15] beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[14:17] mercies of God that you present your
[14:19] bodies a Living Sacrifice God is Not
[14:22] Looking for your service at all no he
[14:24] don't need you he wants your body he
[14:27] wants a sacrifice man he wants a clean
[14:30] holy body not join to sin fornication
[14:34] adultery filthiness lewdness out in the
[14:36] world he don't want that no sir he's a
[14:38] holy God he wants a sacrifice and a
[14:42] sacrifice meaning you going to have to
[14:44] to deny mother father your wife your
[14:47] children or whatever it is you going to
[14:48] have to do that and you're not going to
[14:50] question uh whatever God wants to do a
[14:53] service through you if you can't even
[14:55] get away from little old Petty things
[14:57] about this and that how in the world
[14:59] world can you go in service for God if
[15:01] you can't deny little old normal things
[15:03] in the flesh how can God use you for
[15:06] anything if you're fussing and stent
[15:08] thinking about this and that now he
[15:10] wants a sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[15:13] God which is your reasonable service
[15:16] nothing extra reasonable service and be
[15:20] not conformed to this world other words
[15:23] be not conformed to the Fashions the
[15:26] Styles and the things of this world all
[15:28] right down here amen and in the world
[15:31] the Sodom is here and now he says here
[15:33] but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[15:35] your mind that you may prove what is
[15:37] that good and acceptable and perfect
[15:40] will of God oh church do you realize
[15:42] what has happened when Sodom moved in on
[15:45] the world here in 1960s with these
[15:47] Beatles and whatnot and the Hard Rock
[15:49] the sex those Spirits loose the long
[15:51] haired devils and move it all across the
[15:53] land and tore down our young women
[15:55] stripped them naked and they just give
[15:58] themselves over and fored forication and
[15:59] loose living and all kind of thing that
[16:01] was the devil stripping them down and
[16:03] through the four Beatles coming on the
[16:05] scene and then what we needed was a
[16:08] message amen from God and God sent a
[16:11] prophet with a message and our minds was
[16:14] renewed but the thinking man's filter
[16:16] renewed our mind out gave us God's mind
[16:20] for the devil had clouded our minds up
[16:22] with all kind of stuff and we saw it
[16:24] going on in the different churches or
[16:25] therefore we figured if the pastor and
[16:28] the their deacon is it must be all right
[16:30] if they're doing it but God brought a
[16:32] little humble man who stood alone the
[16:35] thing about your pleasure for second
[16:37] Timothy three declared there'll be
[16:39] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[16:41] God who want to do Godless service
[16:43] worrying about their own flesh what they
[16:45] going to go out here we had a little
[16:47] picnic in here oh my it got all mixed up
[16:49] and brought a devil in the church here

[33:24] this command is not satisfied by an
[33:26] intellectual conv
[33:28] of belief in in one deity see so

[33:44] I see the the Seven Seals and the Seven
[33:47] Angels rather and the the sunset
[33:49] Mountain whatnot that ain't it that's
[33:51] only an intellectual conception did God
[33:54] do something for your heart did he
[33:57] change you in if you never saw the seven
[33:58] angels but did God call you and and tell
[34:01] you that you are the bride child of mine

[40:35] almighty God that'll take this whole
[40:38] thing away as he says not by your might
[40:40] not by your power of this and that but
[40:43] by my spirit saith the Lord amen look at
[40:46] this education mess here look at those
[40:48] little Eaves out there in California
[40:51] because Hurst and and these girls out
[40:53] there who was it are they poor little
[40:55] girls who didn't finish school you
[40:56] better believe they were not they were
[40:58] teachers and highly educated little
[41:01] Eaves lusting for some wisdom and here
[41:04] is uh Field Marshal sinu he had the
[41:08] wisdom he was a serpent amen he's going
[41:11] to mix his wisdom with sex and he
[41:13] trapped those little Eaves looking
[41:15] lusting around for some wisdom they go
[41:18] to school they don't get enough wisdom
[41:19] even in school they want some more
[41:20] wisdom and God has anointed ones likee
[41:24] Manson and this man Phi Marshall sinq
[41:26] what kind of mind could he have what
[41:28] could he say to trap these women he had
[41:31] to have a powerful anointing in order to
[41:34] uh uh uh because uh deceive them and
[41:37] they were deceived look at Hitler there
[41:40] I saw three pictures of him there and
[41:44] one picture he's walking in in Birches
[41:46] Garden there like this here and he's
[41:47] talking to Eva his girlfriend and he
[41:50] looks like any old nice man see kind Old
[41:53] Gentleman then another picture I saw he
[41:55] was preaching and and his eyes was
[41:58] glassy full of devils he had the most
[42:00] powerful anointing upon this Earth of
[42:01] the devil I believe since the serpent
[42:04] yes sir brother and I saw his eyes was
[42:06] actually hazy and he preached so hard he
[42:10] said oh he said just give me a few
[42:12] minutes to speak to the people and I'll
[42:14] get them and he did he almost took the
[42:16] whole world and when he preached the
[42:19] people got so frenzy they scream h h h
[42:23] that's the same thing when the Holy
[42:24] Ghost Falls in here and you begin to say
[42:27] Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah it
[42:29] gets so good on the inside well the
[42:31] devil's anointing went into them people
[42:33] and that's what this field Marshal sent
[42:35] you and all these anointed ones out here
[42:37] black and white and different ones
[42:39] they're anointed by the devil and their
[42:41] words get down into those people and
[42:44] turn them around and they begin to
[42:46] scream that's right or right on and yes
[42:48] sir and they scream and they're ready to
[42:50] kill ready to lay down their bodies or
[42:53] anything and you know that stay in a
[42:56] house like that and all kind of
[42:57] ammunition going in there firep power
[43:00] and yet they fought back where's a
[43:02] bride where's a if they could stand for
[43:05] that thing there and they going to hell
[43:07] where is a bride who will stand for the
[43:10] word where's somebody who will stand up
[43:13] as brother Bram often told the story of
[43:17] Anor renwall this great swissman there
[43:19] when he ran forth into the army and let
[43:22] him throw all the spirits and RAM them
[43:24] into himself give me LI or give me death
[43:27] death and that changed the Swiss Army
[43:28] around they were smaller than that great
[43:31] Army but they defeated the enemy cuz one
[43:33] man had Faith had a revelation that they
[43:37] could not do it and I read in the Bible
[43:39] of a man like that there David amen here
[43:41] was God's people tied down with the
[43:43] intellect and they were TI and Saul's
[43:46] Ministry couldn't do it David Street
[43:48] Brothers couldn't do it those out on the
[43:50] field now can't do it and here comes
[43:53] David number eight walking down the road
[43:56] oh he had to work of the Lord but he had
[43:58] the power of the Resurrection behind it
[44:01] and Goliath faced him and amen and and
[44:04] those men were saying this and that and
[44:07] but oh if you go and fight him that
[44:09] he'll give you money and and women and
[44:11] riches and also all these because
[44:14] popularity David said who cares about
[44:16] them things there I'm here for the honor
[44:18] and the glory of God there it is are you
[44:21] here for the honor and glory of God well
[44:24] do you think that God is glorified and
[44:26] fornication and filthiness and strife
[44:28] and enemy is God glorified in that well
[44:31] then why would we want to stay in that
[44:34] why won't you want the word preach for
[44:36] the honor and glory of God why don't you
[44:38] want that word to scour down through the
[44:41] church until everybody lays out flat and
[44:43] confess their sins that God might have
[44:46] the honor don't you know that Joshua
[44:48] said when aan had committed this sin he
[44:51] said uh a my son he said give glory to
[44:55] God give glory to God confess your sin
[44:58] don't you realize that when you confess
[45:00] your sin that you given glory to God
[45:02] you're saying God is greater than the
[45:04] devil but if you hold on and remain
[45:07] silent then you're giv glory to the
[45:09] devil but when you confess it right away
[45:12] you say it God is greater amen don't you
[45:15] realize people what happened there there
[45:17] was aching hiding with the sin in his
[45:18] heart amen and there there was s he was
[45:21] from the tribe of Judah and then down
[45:23] come the high priest with the Yum and
[45:26] the Thum and and they called all Israel
[45:28] over a million landine out there can you
[45:30] imagine Aaron and cuz and the the the
[45:34] high priest walking down the line with
[45:36] the human Thum walking by Simeon and
[45:40] because walking by Dan and the different
[45:42] tribes and coming down to Judah and to Y
[45:45] th light up that was the Holy Spirit the
[45:47] word had found the tribe and then bring
[45:51] them house by house in that tribe didn't
[45:54] they come until finally the uran th
[45:57] found Ain and achen was taken by the
[46:01] urum oh praise God I remember one day on
[46:05] the day of Pentecost there was Peter and
[46:07] them standing there and in comes ananas
[46:09] and saf and the Yum lit up amen and you
[46:12] a liar Holy Spirit the Y thumb and
[46:15] called out ananas and safire they were
[46:18] taken by the same y that took Ain oh I'm
[46:22] persuaded that that same holy spirit is
[46:24] wanting to come back into his bride once
[46:26] small to take the aans and the ananis
[46:29] and the fires and take them out of the
[46:31] midst of God that God might be glorified
[46:34] oh if you sin we have a blood atonement
[46:36] but give glory to God and repent for it
[46:40] is shame and fear that holds you back
[46:43] therefore when the sin is is committed
[46:45] you don't want it's a monstrosity you
[46:46] don't want anything to do with it that's
[46:48] not you you leave it over you want to
[46:49] hide it and slip over here and slip over
[46:51] as the spirit of the devil that is fear
[46:53] as in other words you have no faith that
[46:56] God is able cover that sin you don't
[46:58] have faith in the blood if you have
[47:00] faith in the blood the moment you sin
[47:03] you will confess it cuz God is able to
[47:07] forgive you God is faithful the Bible
[47:11] says if you will confess your sins God
[47:14] is faithful to forgive you your faults
[47:17] now either he said it or he didn't say
[47:19] it and the longer you hold on to when
[47:21] you do them then there's a child that
[47:23] could be healed there a healing blocked
[47:24] up here a blessing is blocked is
[47:27] stopping over here when you have the
[47:28] unconfessed sin in the midst there oh my
[47:32] praise God so there come David walking
[47:34] down the road there and in the the
[47:37] Goliath he knew he had all Israel tied

[50:33] moments at the altar here that uh that
[50:35] somebody might be healed in here or

[50:42] the way from New Jersey and and
[50:43] Connecticut they come in here for
[50:45] something and we live here right around
[50:47] here why we should be on fire in here

[51:04] like it is yes sir see so therefore um
[51:08] David amen praise God he believed that
[51:11] God is a God in Israel and he walked out
[51:14] there with the power of almighty God and
[51:17] the word of the Lord and that stone was
[51:19] hurled right into the heads there amen
[51:22] so now we see here therefore in the hour
[51:24] that we're living in is uh the the wrong
[51:27] spirits that overcome the people amen

[52:01] still shaking now he shook the Earth by
[52:04] trimmer just warning what is going to be
[52:07] by a great earthquake amen and therefore
[52:09] California is going to shake and I'm
[52:11] persuaded that when the voice of God
[52:13] come down to Exodus 19 and shook the
[52:17] mountain there amen and that mountain
[52:20] and once the voice of God spoke once the
[52:23] voice of God spoke the mountain kept

[53:07] know when the resurrection is coming I
[53:08] don't know when the Rapture is coming

[53:20] I know amen and Peter saying that
[53:23] knowing this in the last days scoffers
[53:25] shall come walking after their own lust
[53:27] and saying where is the promise of his
[53:29] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[53:31] all things continue as they were from
[53:33] the beginning not even realizing do you
[53:35] know they're ignorant of the word of God
[53:37] they're saying where is the promise of
[53:38] his coming and Malachi 4 is the promise
[53:41] of his coming he said I'll send you
[53:43] Elijah there's his promise and you and I
[53:46] have received the promise of his coming
[53:49] and then we put in education and uh
[53:51] going to school over top of the promise
[53:53] of his coming and we not and like give
[53:55] it up our Wednesday he all like this for
[53:57] some school and whatnot what kind of
[53:59] Promise of his coming is in your heart
[54:01] then what has been quickened to you to
[54:03] know that he's here we ain't got
[54:05] anything because against education God
[54:07] has not me I ain't got anything against
[54:09] it God said it's
[54:12] cursed you understand I didn't say he
[54:14] said it he said the tree of knowledge of
[54:16] Good and Evil is
[54:17] cursed so there schools hospitals all
[54:20] Society all good sure for a season in a
[54:23] time but when Malachi 4 comes along and
[54:25] tells you the truth of it then it's all
[54:27] together
[54:27] different amen see so therefore he has
[54:31] given us secret food and we have this
[54:33] secret food now we have nourishment
[54:36] satisfaction refreshment do you have it
[54:38] now friends oh praise God and as you
[54:41] have therefore received Christ the lord
[54:43] so walk ye in him and then now we have
[54:46] now the hatred between the Nations and
[54:48] the different races and whatnot it
[54:51] cannot come by education nor treaties
[54:53] and Conquest no sir it only ANS the
[54:56] smoldering fire the only thing that can
[54:59] put it out is the love of almighty God
[55:01] that's all friends that's all what is
[55:03] needed in a government the church and
[55:05] the homes is a Love Of Christ This Love
[55:07] Of Christ is a Divine plant and Malachi
[55:10] FL four has planted this Divine plant
[55:14] and this Divine plant is now in our
[55:17] hearts and it's going to give fruit soon
[55:19] Amen in the heart of the bride and the
[55:21] churches are going to gather is Heavenly
[55:24] fruits the resurrection is coming and
[55:26] Malachi 4 has planted this in our hearts
[55:29] and is going to bring the pass the
[55:30] tremendous victory in the love divine
[55:32] amen and Malachi
[55:35] 36-18 just want to read it here just
[55:37] strikes my heart just whatever God lay
[55:40] on my heart amen I want to say it then
[55:43] they that feared the Lord spake often
[55:46] one to another may that be this
[55:48] day and the Lord hearkened and heard it
[55:52] and a book of of remembrance was written
[55:54] before him for them that feared the Lord
[55:57] and that thought upon his
[55:59] name his name now and there uh there's
[56:02] the first four Commandments about his
[56:03] name no Idols but who think on his name
[56:07] his Holiness now and they shall be mine
[56:10] sayeth the Lord of host and that day
[56:12] when I make up my jewels and I will
[56:13] spare them as a man spareth his own son
[56:16] that serveth him then shall ye return
[56:19] and discern between the righteous and
[56:22] the wicked between him that serveth God
[56:24] and him that serveth him not oh my we
[56:27] are reached that time now see where

[59:59] would be afraid over 2 million people
[1:00:02] and he would have to take care of those
[1:00:04] people and Moses was a mighty Prophet so
[1:00:06] therefore God right with he said be not

[1:00:56] night amen and observe to do all that's
[1:00:59] written in the law there you are
[1:01:02] therefore uh God Joshua brought us the
[1:01:04] law of the book amen if we could only
[1:01:07] observe to do if you never came here
[1:01:10] amen if you never heard a tape even but
[1:01:12] if you had a revelation that he's God oh
[1:01:14] praise God and you got a Bible here You
[1:01:17] observe to do this here amen see long as
[1:01:20] you heard about it and God spoke to your
[1:01:22] heart therefore if you will observe to
[1:01:25] do what's in the Bible without brother
[1:01:27] keman telling you you have
[1:01:29] success before you even get here
[1:01:31] Wednesday or Sunday if you will meditate
[1:01:33] on my word that that tells you stop
[1:01:36] fornicating and playing around stop
[1:01:37] being a baby before you come here before
[1:01:40] you pick up the telephone before you go
[1:01:42] anywhere meditate on that and then when
[1:01:45] you meditate it means uh it's a a
[1:01:48] two-way traffic oneway traffic is
[1:01:50] reading it reading reading reading
[1:01:52] reading reading reading going on but
[1:01:54] two-way traffic you're reading it comes
[1:01:55] right back at you two ways right back at
[1:01:58] you and it larges in here then as you
[1:02:02] sit there oh God thank you for the word
[1:02:05] this morning then you begin to meditate
[1:02:07] and then holy spirit says don't do this
[1:02:09] here don't do that there do this here do
[1:02:10] that there from where the word from here
[1:02:13] right from
[1:02:14] here oh I hope you get this this morning
[1:02:17] now I'm going close out here the devil
[1:02:19] knows how to take his little thoughts
[1:02:21] and put it right in the words see and
[1:02:23] get spoken word books and line it up and
[1:02:26] show it to you you see to me now it's a
[1:02:28] spirit see and unless you are reading
[1:02:30] the word you won't
[1:02:32] know you won't know you got to hear the
[1:02:35] tapes and read the word but you must
[1:02:38] read this word otherwise you will not be
[1:02:41] able to discern the error you it'll come
[1:02:44] right to you and it'll hook you right on
[1:02:46] off you're gone see so therefore uh to
[1:02:49] my neighbors this morning I love you and
[1:02:51] I wanted to tell you the truth the lion
[1:02:53] has roared who will not fear the Lord
[1:02:56] God has spoken who can but prophesy the
[1:02:59] truth as recommended by Paul is the
[1:03:01] whole gospel back to the word which
[1:03:03] centers around Christ and builds the
[1:03:05] church into a working unit is able to
[1:03:07] throw off all the error all the waste
[1:03:10] and to sustain itself like the human
[1:03:12] body is a working mechanism you
[1:03:15] understand and the body of Christ is so
[1:03:18] much waste and error all over the body
[1:03:20] of Christ now but the day is coming and
[1:03:23] I'm praying that this is the day in New
[1:03:26] York City that this is the day is going
[1:03:27] to start see and it's going to be able
[1:03:29] to be a workable unit to throw off the
[1:03:31] era and the waste from this day on see
[1:03:35] as the body itself see and to sustain
[1:03:37] itself by the word each member sustain
[1:03:40] itself see Christ is risen and he is the
[1:03:43] head amen and so therefore we need some
[1:03:46] Davis to chop off the intellectual
[1:03:47] conception of the Bride amen do you
[1:03:49] believe that there friends and Satan
[1:03:51] always challenge you when he thinks he
[1:03:53] has the upper hand but Jesus Christ said
[1:03:55] that I am the headship I'm the control
[1:03:59] tower amen and I'll ride this Trail once
[1:04:01] more amen praise God may I ask you this
[1:04:05] morning uh what does the resurrection of
[1:04:07] Christ mean to you what does it mean to
[1:04:10] you this morning because I like to know
[1:04:12] what impact does it have on your daily
[1:04:14] life the resurrected Christ is it just a
[1:04:18] historical event that happened is it one
[1:04:21] item in your faith or what is it to you
[1:04:24] what does it mean to you or is it such
[1:04:26] that your entire life begins a new in
[1:04:29] this glorious
[1:04:30] fact did that happen to you or just some
[1:04:34] old historical thing and some vain
[1:04:36] tradition or something see what part
[1:04:38] does the Risen Christ play in your daily
[1:04:41] confrontation with the world Amen the
[1:04:44] daily confrontation see with the
[1:04:46] mounting precious experience on every
[1:04:49] hand what does Christ mean to you amen
[1:04:52] the tragedy this day is that many
[1:04:54] Christians live as if the Lord never
[1:04:56] rose from the dead you know why because
[1:04:59] they know that their sins are forgiven
[1:05:01] and they go into heaven because he died
[1:05:03] for them but he is living for you now
[1:05:07] and that's the part you can't get them
[1:05:08] to see he is living this day right now
[1:05:11] he's here this morning living right in
[1:05:13] here he's a Living Word but so many
[1:05:15] won't come to the word they're scared of
[1:05:17] the word so when the word comes to them
[1:05:20] they back away and preaching hard but
[1:05:23] that's the Rison Christ coming to you to
[1:05:25] set you free
[1:05:26] and and you close you shut down the the
[1:05:29] curtain or the shade you shut it down
[1:05:30] over your heart you won't let the word
[1:05:32] come in and you steal your stuff like
[1:05:34] that and what's he going to say now
[1:05:35] what's he going is he going to expose
[1:05:36] him over here see that's the Risen
[1:05:38] Christ trying to get in and it just
[1:05:40] about drive you up the wall cuz you
[1:05:41] can't preach hardly nowhere just just
[1:05:44] like that see so now but in the meantime
[1:05:47] they don't know he's living this morning
[1:05:49] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:05:51] forever therefore they fac the Hopeless
[1:05:54] struggle of trying to cope with with
[1:05:56] events and circumstances that reduce
[1:05:58] them to hopeless failures how many in
[1:06:00] here is this morning is a hopeless
[1:06:02] failure cuz you hav't I'm going talk to
[1:06:04] you plain now anybody that's groping
[1:06:06] around scratching around like you
[1:06:09] hopeless failure because the Christ has
[1:06:11] been risen resurrected with barley
[1:06:14] loaves breaking them off in here every
[1:06:16] day for over 8 and 1/2 years and you is
[1:06:18] a you asham to be walking around in here
[1:06:22] in that condition and knowing that he's
[1:06:24] risen this morning you won't take him
[1:06:26] you just refuse to take him see
[1:06:28] therefore we nothing but hopeless
[1:06:31] failures the resurrection of Christ is
[1:06:33] an item present in their belief by
[1:06:35] intellect see but is absent in their
[1:06:38] behavior you say that the Lord is in me
[1:06:40] I'm saved I believe the message well
[1:06:42] then show it to
[1:06:43] me show it to me you said that the
[1:06:47] Malachi 4 gave the word and we have this
[1:06:49] message here and we're on our way to
[1:06:51] heaven and the word will overcome every
[1:06:53] devil well then overcome him then amen
[1:06:55] [Applause]
[1:06:58] that's or do you say the devil's
[1:06:59] fighting me can't make it you it's a
[1:07:02] hopeless failure I don't know what

[1:11:46] Prayer my praise God where are those

[1:11:51] children Walling around in the dirt God
[1:11:55] he amen praise
[1:11:57] God where they at let me give you a
[1:12:00] little illustration and because and
[1:12:01] close out this morning I feel we got
[1:12:03] some uh spiritual ones here
[1:12:06] now amen praise the Lord illustration a
[1:12:11] physical birth to a spiritual birth each
[1:12:14] person begins his physical Life as a
[1:12:16] baby and a child we understand that then
[1:12:19] uh Jesus Christ said except uh ye be
[1:12:22] except you be converted and become as
[1:12:23] Little Children You shall not enter into
[1:12:25] the kingdom of heaven so we begin ours
[1:12:27] in spiritual as little children is that
[1:12:29] right amen now excuse me to uh because
[1:12:33] to receive spiritual life one must uh
[1:12:36] become as little children now a healthy
[1:12:40] newborn baby begins to grow physically
[1:12:42] and continues growing uh then through
[1:12:45] his life because he acquires all the
[1:12:47] skills of sitting crawling walking
[1:12:51] recognizing responding and speaking is
[1:12:53] that right amen
[1:12:56] I got you this morning amen as the years
[1:12:58] go by he attends school and develops
[1:13:01] more skills then uh normal growth
[1:13:04] through the stages of a child a teenager
[1:13:06] and also adult now all this is normal
[1:13:09] and this is expected is that right can
[1:13:12] we say amen amen all right then it's our
[1:13:14] spiritual life we are little children
[1:13:16] young men and fathers that right first
[1:13:19] John 2 that right little children young
[1:13:22] man and father see now sometimes s the
[1:13:25] the abnormal occurs and a child does not
[1:13:28] develop those necessary skills which
[1:13:30] lead to adult life one of the most uh
[1:13:34] pathetic sits in the world is to see an
[1:13:38] adult with the brain of a four-year-old
[1:13:39] child that right a strong of Limb and
[1:13:43] body but the brain of a little foury
[1:13:46] child and they can cope with the world
[1:13:48] see that's a terrible sight it is see
[1:13:51] and this is not normal and when it
[1:13:53] happens special measures are necessary
[1:13:56] because the life is not designed to
[1:13:58] operate on such unbalanced conditions it
[1:14:01] shouldn't be that way see now then
[1:14:04] special measures is needed more
[1:14:06] attention more nursing more provision
[1:14:09] but with no possible hope of the child
[1:14:12] accepting
[1:14:13] responsibility you follow me now okay
[1:14:16] now Hebrews 512 through 13 and 1
[1:14:19] Corinthians 3 1-3 refer to certain
[1:14:22] Christians who were still babes in their
[1:14:24] spirit growth and Paul said my you still
[1:14:27] I have to speak to you as carnal is that
[1:14:30] right because in Corinthia and over in
[1:14:32] Hebrews he said why you have uh need of
[1:14:35] uh of you should be having meat now you
[1:14:39] should be teachers and I still have to
[1:14:41] give you milk is that right amen see
[1:14:45] then who and so therefore they needed to
[1:14:49] be fed on milk their behavior was
[1:14:52] characterized by all the limitations of
[1:14:54] babyhood
[1:14:56] they were unre they were unreliable in
[1:14:58] their responses unreasonable in their
[1:15:01] demands and unable to accept
[1:15:04] responsibility or make
[1:15:08] decisions oh yeah it's here this morning
[1:15:10] I'm going to say it that's here we are
[1:15:12] now I'm laying you out a baby here's a
[1:15:14] baby and I'm going to let you see it you
[1:15:17] see they had never grown up they were
[1:15:19] still
[1:15:20] babies there is the tragedy today in the
[1:15:24] bride the Corinthian group could not go
[1:15:27] on to Perfection because they kept
[1:15:29] misbehaving fornication contention
[1:15:32] jealousy Strife bitterness I'm because
[1:15:35] this man and that man and even this
[1:15:37] group said because we have Christ I have
[1:15:39] Christ therefore they were saying we
[1:15:40] don't want nothing to do with none of
[1:15:42] you guys you see so you had four groups
[1:15:44] there you see I mean now and you had the
[1:15:47] Hebrew group and they couldn't go on to
[1:15:50] profession because of the things that
[1:15:51] they refus to do therefore Paul said
[1:15:54] come come on Hebrew group let's go on to
[1:15:57] Perfection better things are persuaded
[1:15:59] for you and they wouldn't go and the
[1:16:01] other group kept the same thing over and
[1:16:04] over and over into sin back and forth
[1:16:08] and stripes and emulations and whatnot
[1:16:10] they couldn't go on and the Hebrew group
[1:16:13] they couldn't go on so Paul why let me
[1:16:16] go over to
[1:16:17] Ephesians oh amen be no more children
[1:16:22] tossed to and fro with every wind of
[1:16:23] dark and we are here this morning we
[1:16:26] have
[1:16:27] arrived amen the people trusted God
[1:16:30] years ago but we're still babes in
[1:16:32] Christ many of us now these kind
[1:16:36] Corinthia and and also Hebrew they are
[1:16:39] spiritual
[1:16:41] abnormalities because of their age and
[1:16:43] status you expect to see them honest
[1:16:45] matur Christians working with these
[1:16:47] young people and helping them now I'm
[1:16:50] telling about you older ones in the
[1:16:51] faith here you sisters and what not
[1:16:53] should be with these young sisters
[1:16:55] helping them and inspiring them and

[1:25:05] you back away then you don't get that
[1:25:07] that nourishment that would have set you
[1:25:09] free that's all I'm trying to say so
[1:25:14] when the word is preached there's going
[1:25:15] to be like this morning there's going to
[1:25:17] be nourishment but when you walked in
[1:25:19] here it was a wall you see the me now

[1:25:30] more we're going on to a
[1:25:32] Perfection amen for the hidden promises
[1:25:35] listen when Joshua was like any other
[1:25:37] man when Moses died can you imagine but
[1:25:40] when he got there he was called for the
[1:25:42] job if God has called you he will equip
[1:25:45] you you think God going to have you face
[1:25:48] Satan you not fa because facing Satan
[1:25:50] that's him he says this is my battle

[1:25:56] body that's all but the battle is the
[1:25:59] Lord's it's not your battle it's God's
[1:26:02] battle and David knew it was the Lord's
[1:26:04] battle so David all he had to do was to
[1:26:06] go out there and be on the scene and
[1:26:08] testify and David told him he said are
[1:26:10] you crazy he said the god that the God
[1:26:13] now that delivered me from the poor of

[1:26:42] is praise that was him speaking back it
[1:26:45] wasn't me amen praise the Lord naan
[1:26:49] praise
[1:26:50] God oh Church be no more children the
[1:26:53] resur rection of Christ today has
[1:26:56] released every promise the promises is
[1:27:00] hidden food amen and it's a secret the
[1:27:04] Risen Lord is the one who makes possible
[1:27:07] our complete enjoyment of the Glorious
[1:27:11] promises hidden away in the word of
[1:27:15] God do you believe
[1:27:17] that it is the enjoyment of these
[1:27:20] promises that make possible life where
[1:27:23] sin is restrained temptation is resisted
[1:27:27] and fear is neutralized and
[1:27:30] anxiety and depression lose their power
[1:27:34] through the
[1:27:36] promises amen can you imagine the fear
[1:27:40] anxiety and depression that fell upon
[1:27:44] Joshua when Moses left over 2 million
[1:27:47] people to deal with and here he was just
[1:27:49] there you
[1:27:50] see but he was the one that was in that
[1:27:54] tent with Moses in a tent a meeting in
[1:27:56] there he had been in there praying and
[1:27:57] whatnot see he'd watched the man of God
[1:28:00] move so he knew to trust in the Lord and
[1:28:04] then God spoke to him and says every
[1:28:07] place where you put your foot at that's
[1:28:09] yours don't worry about it see when they
[1:28:11] got over there to Jericho he put down
[1:28:13] his foot said take off your shoes for
[1:28:15] the soul of your feet that was the same
[1:28:17] thing he told Moses it's the same thing
[1:28:19] he tells you today amen see therefore
[1:28:23] therefore we we are here friends the
[1:28:26] generation is all anxiety infatuated
[1:28:29] with filth and whatnot but God is
[1:28:31] calling us to
[1:28:33] Holiness and the Risen Christ has made
[1:28:36] this all possible in our experience in
[1:28:38] our experience now he has released all
[1:28:42] of the promises of God to us the peace
[1:28:44] can be ours this morning that inner
[1:28:47] peace that termoil inside am I saved am

[1:28:56] devil why did I make a mistake make a
[1:28:58] mistake make a mistake every
[1:29:00] day you understand now you will make a
[1:29:03] mistake every day but there's a blood
[1:29:06] atonement for you confess it right away
[1:29:09] see because you have secret food the
[1:29:12] hour is here for the message and the
[1:29:14] messenger to become one spiritual food
[1:29:17] in Du season he said all them prophets
[1:29:20] live in the spirit of God until they
[1:29:23] became one with the word then he says
[1:29:26] church do you see what I'm trying to
[1:29:28] tell you this morning the word is in the
[1:29:30] person the sick is healed with a word
[1:29:33] the cripples rise up and they walk amen
[1:29:36] the blind eyes open up the dead is
[1:29:38] raised why the message and The
[1:29:41] Messengers are one and the only way we
[1:29:44] can become one is one with the word I'm
[1:29:48] trying to tell you this morning the
[1:29:50] message the taped message and spoken
[1:29:53] word message was a revealed message
[1:29:55] which was in the Bible and it it was a
[1:29:58] message of Prophecy it prophesied about
[1:30:01] all the things happening which you
[1:30:03] couldn't really understand it here
[1:30:04] because you couldn't locate it out here
[1:30:05] but it had to be a prophet to locate it
[1:30:07] and put it here then while you see the
[1:30:10] tapes and all these things it gives you
[1:30:11] Faith cuz you read it and you see it com
[1:30:13] to pass and you hear it you it makes you
[1:30:15] have more
[1:30:16] muscles but what that all this here for
[1:30:19] is to get you back here then if what he
[1:30:23] said as come to pass won't what it says
[1:30:27] here in you come to
[1:30:31] pass that's all that's all for 10 years
[1:30:34] I've been trying to say to you if the
[1:30:36] prophet had to read the same word God is
[1:30:39] trying to get you to read this morning
[1:30:41] and what he read with a message and it
[1:30:43] came to pass all these things happen you
[1:30:45] understand and we've seen it happen for
[1:30:47] over 10 years now all these things in
[1:30:49] there is that right now this day he says
[1:30:52] be no more children
[1:30:54] you know it's right you know it works
[1:30:57] well I want to work through you this
[1:31:00] morning I want to bring to pass every
[1:31:02] promise that he had in him I want to
[1:31:05] bring it to pass in you amen but he read
[1:31:07] my word you understand he read the same
[1:31:11] Bible here Ando but he had a message but
[1:31:14] the Bible declared that we have a
[1:31:16] message also Revelation
[1:31:19] 2217 says the spirit and the bride say
[1:31:22] come but you got to be reading the word
[1:31:24] for it is a reading of the word that
[1:31:26] gives you the spiritual
[1:31:28] muscles that's that's one that give you
[1:31:30] the strength is reading other the word
[1:31:32] it gets into your heart and tells you
[1:31:34] what to do and what to say and whatnot
[1:31:36] you understand me now that's how you
[1:31:37] know so therefore uh listen the listen
[1:31:41] as we meditate on the word the word
[1:31:43] comes to Lodge in your heart in your
[1:31:45] mind amen then the word within your
[1:31:48] heart and your mind starts to speak back
[1:31:50] to you you know that the word speaks but
[1:31:52] if you don't read how can speak back to
[1:31:54] you I want to know if you don't read the
[1:31:57] word how can the word speak back to you
[1:32:00] then it begins to convict you before you
[1:32:03] come here
[1:32:04] now before you come in here it convicts
[1:32:07] you of sins of thought and
[1:32:11] deed and before you even get in the
[1:32:14] house of God I mean you are convicted
[1:32:16] cuz you're reading the
[1:32:17] word the anointing shall teach you is
[1:32:21] that right then it shows you how you
[1:32:24] ought to behave in such and such a
[1:32:26] situation it's in the word every s say
[1:32:30] nothing new Under The Sun It's All in
[1:32:32] here already happened everything that
[1:32:34] could happen happened already you
[1:32:36] understand only different people in a
[1:32:38] different setting but the things has
[1:32:40] already
[1:32:41] happened every situation has all this is
[1:32:44] brother you don't understand my trouble
[1:32:46] no I do understand has already happened
[1:32:48] if you read this it tell you how to get
[1:32:50] out of
[1:32:52] it amen see if you read this will tell
[1:32:54] you how to get out of it see and then
[1:32:58] it'll show you what your actions and
[1:33:00] reactions should be and you won't come
[1:33:03] in here all down cuz you already have
[1:33:05] read the word during the week and in
[1:33:08] prayer and you're just a strong
[1:33:10] spiritual mature Christian come in to
[1:33:12] help somebody you see a little one like
[1:33:14] you say you walk over God bless your
[1:33:16] sister how you feeling so forth so on
[1:33:18] and you've been in the word and all
[1:33:20] day then God can usually put you in
[1:33:22] service amen and speak not what your
[1:33:25] mind but the Holy Spirit say it have to
[1:33:27] be in a word now see now therefore our
[1:33:31] response to the in workking of the word
[1:33:33] of God is the measure of the success
[1:33:36] that we're going to have in God's sight
[1:33:39] our response to what we have read and
[1:33:41] what we have heard that's all he can
[1:33:44] use you understand that and then you
[1:33:47] have that success because he told Joshua
[1:33:50] meditate day and night and observe to do
[1:33:52] what's written here and you shall have
[1:33:54] success and we'll have the same
[1:33:57] thing um the world is longing to see a
[1:34:01] faith that
[1:34:02] works now a faith has been delivered to
[1:34:05] the saints of God and we are contending
[1:34:08] for that faith is that right we are
[1:34:10] contending for the faith that was once
[1:34:12] delivered and was delivered Again by
[1:34:15] Malachi 4 amen now this is only possible
[1:34:20] that the world will see it if we be no
[1:34:22] more children
[1:34:24] there's no other way they just won't see
[1:34:25] it through you cuz you'll still be
[1:34:27] walling around see now Hebrews 12 and
[1:34:31] 3:19 Revelation rather chastening is
[1:34:35] child
[1:34:35] training and it's in the lay out of sea
[1:34:38] age that God calls out some children
[1:34:40] from leosa and chastens them and rebukes
[1:34:43] them with sickness Temptations trials
[1:34:49] problems and those things is for child
[1:34:52] training
[1:34:53] so when you fuss and stew against the
[1:34:56] problems the
[1:34:58] situations then every son which cometh
[1:35:02] to God must be child trained otherwise
[1:35:05] he is not one of
[1:35:07] mine now if Christ had to go through the
[1:35:10] same thing what about you and I brother
[1:35:13] B had to go through the same thing he
[1:35:15] had a throne in his flesh Paul had Thor
[1:35:18] his flesh brother BR it was a little
[1:35:20] animal 6 in long but it would be made
[1:35:23] well
[1:35:24] so we have thorns well thank God for the
[1:35:26] thorn I've been sick in my body for
[1:35:29] years we're retired it's I got to go
[1:35:32] with
[1:35:33] it because other words I'm saying I say
[1:35:37] Lord if you will only give me some
[1:35:38] strength in my body then I I can really
[1:35:41] do something for you then I'm saying
[1:35:43] Lord I'll do it in my
[1:35:46] strength amen but if I'm perfectly weak
[1:35:50] I can't do nothing then he can show his
[1:35:52] strength in my
[1:35:55] weakness amen so when I become totally
[1:35:58] weak in in myself then God can be
[1:36:02] totally
[1:36:03] strong amen so when we have problems and
[1:36:07] situations we're weak then he comes on
[1:36:10] the scene he's strong but you got to
[1:36:11] believe he will come on the scene there
[1:36:14] where the devil Cuts you off so he's not
[1:36:16] coming but then you run his hand out of
[1:36:19] here I'll chop your head or get your
[1:36:21] hand out of here he is coming amen then
[1:36:24] then something touches you you feel
[1:36:26] something come down your shoulder Holy
[1:36:29] Spirit comes all over here the hand of
[1:36:32] the Lord moves down and you say oh then
[1:36:35] you get strong don't you oh you feel
[1:36:38] good you're ready to stand and challenge
[1:36:40] any devil let him come amen praise the
[1:36:43] Lord that's the way it does it see so
[1:36:46] now why does he do this here two things
[1:36:49] partaketh of his Holiness Hebrews 12:11
[1:36:52] and it ye yields the Peaceable fruit of
[1:36:56] righteousness he only is chastised those
[1:36:58] who he loved that they might be
[1:37:02] holy then in sewing this holy seed then
[1:37:07] they have the fruit of righteousness
[1:37:09] then he plucks it up he takes his second
[1:37:12] ride that's all it's all about this word
[1:37:15] is thrust at you seven times in seven
[1:37:17] verses now I'm going to say something I
[1:37:20] spoke on this before a little blessing
[1:37:22] to you maybe chastening is connected to
[1:37:25] the problems around us he chastens us
[1:37:28] with these
[1:37:29] problems can you see that can you be no
[1:37:33] more babies and Waller in in the
[1:37:35] problems but be like Paul says Lord
[1:37:38] therefore will our glory in my
[1:37:40] infirmities therefore will I glory in
[1:37:42] every situation circumstance that when I
[1:37:45] am weak and I can't do nothing that you
[1:37:48] might be made strong in
[1:37:50] me are you ready to say that this
[1:37:52] morning yeah

[1:38:07] with the sex devil trying to get up on
[1:38:09] them and your sons and whatnot it's
[1:38:11] literal hell to you those are problems
[1:38:13] but he's only chastising you see he know
