Luke 24:36 truth 3:45 open your understanding and nobody knew what I was even talking about well here it is now same scripture that was preached in 74 was read back Wednesday now your understanding will come open and now the water bear will pour water upon you praise God Amen oh praise God okay has a this is in Perea about prayer greetings in the name of our lovely Lord Jesus I want to give a testimony for the glory of the Lord last week you hit it right on the nail thank you brother that was a gospel meal you were telling us how to enter into prayer by first giving praises to our Lord and then talking to him I knew in my heart there was something about praising and worshipping the Lord that I was missing On February 3rd as I was walking on my mail route I was talking to the Lord asking him how I could get his ear before I knew I was not coming to the Lord in the right way all of a sudden something inside of me said our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name they are all Lord I'll worship you I love you my father before you ever pray you worship Him and that he taught you how to pray he said here's how you pray amen the Lord's Prayer everything is in there for giving you enemies your debtors everything everything is in there amen and all of a sudden some inside me said our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name I see yes that's it praises be to his holy name that is part of our prayer is praising and worshiping his holy name as I went further down in the Lord's Prayer it says thy will be done we have to pray for his will not our will in our life also thinking thanking God for our daily bread for the food clothing shelter our good health and everything all the good carnal things and spiritual that he has given us jobs and homes or whatever he's given us and not take everything for granted like Americans do amen forgive us our trespasses Lord if I have done any one wrong in intentional or unintentional to anyone may they forgive me for if they don't it will hurt their their soul as we forgive those who trespass against us may we have believed kindness in prayer for anyone that has done us no harm for thine is the kingdom and the power and glory we may we worship the Lord Jesus who gets all the glory and honor I believe this is a secret place of Thunder it is for you hear the Thunder God's voice is Thunder for if we get into prayer by pour by praising and talking to the Lord all negative things will pass away brother Branham said on page 452 seven seals don't never try to figure out anything just be simple before God because the more you tried to figure it out the farther you get away from him just simply believe him thank you for your god-given ministry and being an echo of Malachi 4 I will simply believe the promise that God will heal you and your wife a fellow and now this is our like a fellow King and priest brother rich in Christ Jesus but rich Martin he knows he's the king and a priest by faith amen so let's have

time of need we want to we want to reach forth a hand and help our brother email so now you know where you add on the third phase and Aquarius pouring out water what happened last on February 9 a revelation come to you a revelation of the third phase that's what happened a man she thanked God for them praise God now you ain't understanding was open you may be seated and Wednesday night Amen an hour hand of deliverance God's got his bowl ready to shoot it into your hearts and when he seals you with our head praise God that's what happened did you know you may be seated did you hit a prophet clean your hides out oh he's nice huh no man of God loves sin they'll bust sin the hell praise God some people think I gotta say something nice sweet hey man no you gotta knock that thing in the head John the Baptist said you bunch of vipers and snakes Oh what are you talking about anybody may be seated they got all off on the nice quotes and then they build himself a little thing around that and leave that other stuff there that's for the Pentecostals or somebody and that's what you who brother that's what me him amen so anyway oh yeah what does I have here visitation that's right remember when I was reading about elder at last week I think yeah my elder at Kenya where where brother Bram had visited there into the African brother there on August 13 94 and brother bran was in the presence of the Lord he had been hearing all over elder ed and that's the stronghold of the the polygamists and nobody could get in and do anything immediately when angel was still there brother Branham in grey suit appeared and greeted the brother of us god bless you my precious brother he proceeded to say this in the presence of the angel of the Lord number one he did not expect a message to go the way it is now going and if I was going the preachers of the message have changed the message itself and they in that area did they change it and I know who did it and he came down and told the poor Africans with several wives that they can bring them into the message and just this Minister come from Europe and that's how they got all messed up in his eye and all down through there the Lord told me stay out of there for seventeen years ago to the right time amen so they changed the message itself number three the preachers and believers are quoting the message more than believing what he preached you can find it everywhere they're quote everything but forgiveness and brotherly kindness they'll quote everything but seven thunders they're quoting everything except that the saying the Seventh Seal is open but they're quoting quote and quote unquote they in the message so now you see waiting around up amen so the preachers are quoting the message more than believing what he preached many people have gone astray in the message backsliders they are they just look around all those will come through here where they are now back slidden and it's supposed to be in the message amen the only thing that the preacher the preachers have done is to bring people to the church and not to Christ that's why I preach as hard as I can to drive church members out of here praise God yes that's why I do it I don't want no church members say I could have 1500 people around here I don't want them I want the elected predestinated seeds of God that can take that word and I nail it down a man may be seated so now you know why I do what saying do it what I'm doing but I know what I was doing I know all the impersonations I was gonna go through and down to the time for him to pour out the water I know what I was doing the time would come when the star day would be up in the heavens my god and be just a few short days praise God I know there be of people ready full of seed in their souls for the water-bearer to pour upon him hey man maybe a seeded the only thing the preachers have done is bringing people to church and not to Christ when we had time we wasted it rather than get on fire and come closer to God these people don't know that God has come down now he's quoting from 1 Thessalonians 4 the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and a voices and Trump and I'm the raptured tape he said Jesus does all three and brother parameters telling the man here these people don't know that God has come down Elohim they'd up The ministers don't know it so here's a wonderful report from elder rent her brother John this fax me have just come back from elder Edda we're all this we're brother Ram appeared in 1994 and the message was all messed up there now and the thunders is in there now just come back from elder ed and I had four wonderful service that have characterized or great outpouring of the Spirit the Brethren who were very happy we came up with an idea everybody's grabbing four tapes and everything so we had to come up with 90 or forming a Central Library and elder ed town that will serve over 30 churches in the vicinity of this town this was after hearing of the great demand and thirsty that the people have for your audio and videotapes because the need is so great it will really it will be really very hard to equipped everybody so I suggest you to talk to you to help in this matter to the provide elder aunt town with videotapes and to give them permission to give give and to get permission to give them audio tapes duplicated which he does by me three families in Ella read have the V CRM system and sister there open up her home for the Brethren and watching your videos she haven't been going to 400 kilometres away to get the videos so therefore he says she told me that she has written several times anyway they are demanding now this is Ella read where brother branham visited this African brother and now what's going on in town a seventh on the revival the message that was changed was changed right back seven thunders give faith our echo was echoed in elder end and here's a man you may be seated so now you know and we're gonna have a brother they already fires all over the place the holy spirits fall in the jungle I have faxes there they're going in a jungle they just say seven thunders and fire falls and so it's all over the place in the east they cannot stop and put it out so [Applause] forget about it and one minister from Canada who poles the seven thunders for twenty years and came right next to us in Arusha two challenges and God emptied his meeting and they came in on me the one sister come and said what is this this dis anointing we don't have it there is here I will go back and tell the people is here not there [Applause] so I say yeah and they come and then I got the letter yesterday may be seated then the the host African pastor and this Minister from Canada said what's going on they say people don't come back here cuz there's no anointing here knowing over there were thunders we go there so what happened the host pastor and the minister from Canada came Sunday morning and captain blew it from London laid out the message the great opened Seventh Seal and and a minister from Canada had to throw up his hands praising God said I say amen to everything same Minister went to Nairobi preached the seven thunders same when I went down Christmas down to Johannesburg and rebuked the South ethic for not preaching of seven thunders now he himself had just been blasting the seven thunders so Amen well praise God I thought I'd let you know that so it's the message see you watched him guys brother they're gonna try to turn around and so you may be seated can I have some oil no you go to those guys now who is selling it I don't have enough for myself oh brother you want these things happen it'll blow your mind up oh I get over there and I want to take all my strength over here so that's what happened for a ninth the water poured out it was a revelation and that's what happened and some I'm happy to report that the that the 7th on revival has broken out in Eldoret King it's all over the place and in Wednesday night something happened tremendous of Pennsylvania they were gathered it was snowing and then while it was snowing they were sitting there and it couldn't hear the tape too good so the Holy Spirit led brother Dave Mac to cut off toward the end by the Holy Spirit and he had a book printed up and he and he read from there and a supernatural anointing came in behind him while he was reading brother Brown's words and anointing just it went out to the people and he hit those points in Saint Luke 24 and so your understanding is open and the people jump to the feet there was no song leader in the pulpit in Pennsylvania and they praise gone for 45 minutes to an hour with the snow outside and they had to drive 11:30 at night in the snow but the anointing hit the place and they have not and they were not here last Sunday so God supernaturally come in to bring them together and they are seeing less on his tape today soin orion is already there then they'll pick up the message last sunday you talk about a gun you talk about being on the third phase you talk about of faith oh my okay maybe see you so now we know positively what it was the third phase at a little secret amen well the Holy Spirit told me Jeremy 31st February 2nd to February 9th will be the same as it was for you June 2nd June 6th and June 9th so will February 2nd February 6 you go out to the church like you did June 6 and that's what happened that's the Lord you gave me a tape then and it was speak to the rock not smite it I said do you have a tape for this time he says yes peak to the mountain so praise God we're going to start speaking to the mountain amen [Applause] so we have to get some third phase training and that's what brother Brandon was doing with the squirrels he was training him with squirrels and said it'd be their brother Brent himself said no vision just say it keep a picture so that's where we are oh my god may be seated so the seventh under revelation places the bride under expectation for a seventh on a revival and as June 2nd 6 & 9 placed the people capped off the first phase from November 1064 and went on to the second phase and God captain off in Georgia aim in front of everybody if thunder would love and then and went on to the second phase as you know what happened September 20th and so and we went in a solid preaching the first message is February 2nd 1975 it was faith the faith that's when God spoke to my mother sitting over there see I gave them to you for this day to bring the people on the darkness so they seem to be in darkness to me so the time for the third phase and some Eccles to go out with signs wonders and miracles and bring a light Lord signify hallelujah okay now maybe see I'm hurry up here I'll be a to long in my bank the seventh on Revelation it places the bride on their expectation Holy Spirit was placing you from September 15 then he cleaned you up got rid of all the sins and pardoned you and did everything else and then gave you a king lamb worship November 17 do you know what he was doing then Daniel Martin praise God that he entered in a man and he and he found old dream October 29 where he tried to the Holy Spirit was a person and he tried to go in there and he couldn't get in and then it any second time he went in and he found out what the secret was the first time he trying to go into the Holy Ghost the second time he thanked the Lord for the Holy Ghost which is scripture praising and blessing his name full of joy [Applause] that's the secret you don't want to be a fish if there's a beach fish do you huh one that's swimming through the water praise God huh with his mouth open all the time looking for something amen that's how naked the fisherman hooks they're looking for something grab the hook hey man see so then didn't Jesus help Peter I'll make you a Fisher of men huh amen praise the guy maybe a seated so you keep praying like but brother David Martin amen Daniel Martin and the sister Martin up they have received the Holy Ghost also a man consecrating and totally dedicating yourselves and you are bound to receive that the baptism the Holy Ghost why because why we we have a revelation now because we are now on the third phase where the dynamics will strike the mechanics and God announced it in the heavens and dreams and everything else flash it on the wall I don't know what else there is to tell you sit down and don't eat my god poured out the Holy Spirit what else is there to tell you I think left for you to do as a believer I'm okay praise God you may be seated so the dynamics type mechanics now have a start here a message amen we're gonna start here now we're here my title is spirit and the bride say comb and you pray for me I don't know how long I can go or what I'm gonna say what I'm supposed to say anything I just don't know and that's why I like it let my mind go away that the mind of Christ move across so I'm looking for the mind of Christ to come in here today praise God amen now we know st. Luke's 1730 was L M and then coming down into profit in Genesis 18 and Sophie you know the whole story and we know that on Christ to reveal his own word that he called that the I time and he said there's nothing left one more moving one more faculty left that would be the intelligence and that's where I'm laying that my message today on the intelligence the mind of Christ amen so now we're here now now we know that what let me see what time is it here okay now we know that 1 Thessalonians 4:16 the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and voice it in a trunk and we know that the shout now we know was the I time to seeing time to take us through 30 years of darkness to see where we was at is that correct and we had a guide the word to take us all the way the last 30 years many have fell in ditches and everywhere else but by the grace of God because your predestinated my god has led you all the way you could not go into a ditch you couldn't fall in there because your predestinated a man for purpose you're going to receive something hallelujah so alright you may be seated page 18 Christ Aviva's onward 1965 you remember jesus said as it wasn't an age of Sodom what happened just before Sodom now I spoke the same quote here on SEP November 17 God put now I think your minds are open you and I bring it back God came with what I was doing was sowing on the 17 for now when we hit a typical you'll see that and I was bringing in the King language lamb worship for now any man so what happened just before Sodom God came down with some angels and then I watch they had an investigation judgment see was been going on for 30 years investigation judgment and hear what he said I heard the cry that it's so central so great so I come down the final weather is all together the truth or not and I'm gonna come down through my prophet for about three years and I'm going to lay out every mystery in the Bible I'm going to book and tape and I'm a final across the world who's crying who wants to get out of here and they will come to my message for 30 years amen and so I've come down to find out whether it's all together the truth or not is that right watch that main one that stay with Abraham could discern the thoughts was in Sarah's heart behind him now you look around just a little bit Anolis watch what is doing the same thing today now he's bringing from James 18 to Revelation 10 over here the same thing today it's an investigation judgment so there you are so brother Branson message was an investigation judgment to see who the seeds are who really wants to get out of Sodom who wants to get out of this New World Order who wants to leave here who don't want being in a Tribulation Period who wants to praise the Lord huh who wants the Holy Ghost hey man now you understanding it now now you see the series of the hour amen may be seated same thing today it's an investigation judgment when after a while the church when it can stand that place what place place in Christ praise God where you're adopted Amen with Joseph's coat Rebecca's veil wrap with the spoken word of God when you can stand that place and every see may be seated has been brought to its spot adoption time they'll be gone they won't know what happened to them one won't be going this way one may go on over to pass his house when we going down over there and the first thing you know they're not there clinic was the time God took him he's found not come down to investigate oh praise God amen patient 19 see down through the age we started off with the foundation from from the first church age when the sea went in the ground the complete sea then it come out through the feet Luther come back through wesley then independent cost tongues lips now sin the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself that's what I'm about this morning my god we're here on the third phase with the mind of Christ some places are placed his promise here in New York and November 17th many times but I'm bringing it but we were actually preaching it today we're actually here today amen yes sir so I got to sew it back here may be seated and now there's nothing else left foot to come but him himself to step internet cuz that's the last thing there is and once on this third phase in part one you add to your faith the seven virtues there then when you get up to charity him himself steps into your statue of a perfect man and that'll be part two adduction speaking the word create yourself like that speak to the mountain yes sir okay you getting it you understand me an opening being open may be seated but him himself to step into that because that's the last thing we really see why is two parts there now I'm only telling you this the rest of them don't know this they don't know anything about it but he told me in 1980 a man died my share to you last week amen Oh [Applause] did it put fire on it he shown you the secret how to climb up a man may be seated so if you climb up amen still through Malachi fours message touch of a perfect man he said I'll take the secret of it to my grave he did there's a statue of a perfect man on top of his grave and they walk all around it take pictures and his secrets laying right there come from all over the world and take take a picture of his grave and there's a pyramid sitting right there with the eagle on top there's a secret hallelujah Lauren okay next is the intelligence but himself a separate to that because this is the last thing or is the next is intelligent we have no intelligent my own as his we have no sign of her own how can a man for see these things he can't do it it's God himself he's becoming to a place he's governed the body all the way through then a complete party of Christ is revealing a form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adam did at the beginning and Adam was rather at the at the beginning and then he said on page 39 notice now notice the light you can't see with your hands yes part of the body you can't see what the ears yet it can hear you can't see what the nose it smells you can't see what the lips but it speaks see that's what's the Pentecostal age but now it's twice but now is in the eye time Malachi for the seein see now there is a one moving faculty beyond the eye is that right the next is the intelligence which is Christ itself and that's what I'm speaking on this morning we own a third phase for Christ himself my gut to be failed behind your human skin what a promise the mind of God moving through you Zoe eternal life brother my cut the word up gotta be spoken the authority will be in a living Church the cripples will walk the blind will see hallelujah hey man maybe sealing the next is in the intelligence I could take over here and finish in 15 minutes I could get through here next is intelligent which is crash itself who controls the whole body no moving motion beyond that see everything else has moved there's nothing beyond the i but christ the voice of the archangel [Applause] hey man maybe you sit down let me identify quickly and leave this part of it here

denominational and in the word fighting one against the other they have been they have been since Luther first brought forth the first Reformation I hope that's simple enough that you can understand and see these men if they can pick up this and go out with it they can make more sense to it huh well look look around the message see how many men picked it up that makes sense to it they all in confusion but there's a star over New York City that picked it up to make more sense to it by 1/7 under revelation oh you don't know you got it may be seated these men if they can pick up this and go out with it my faith is go out there in seven thunders give faith step out go out with it they can make more sense to it because see it'll be revelation after revelation once they step out power after

my god and his worry becomes one hey man that's when God's Spirit waters the seat of God the Word of God it produces God it's not it's not a it is not the individual it's gone for what you're dead and you're not yourself no more you're wrecking yourself dead hollowed out waiting for the seed germ then then what is it isn't you no more it isn't a man it's God in the man it's a seed germ layer begins spoken word God's Word made manifest in the man then it isn't the man it's the man that that's died he can't be a hybrid in the Sun at the same time he's either Sun or death or Sun of life so if he's the son of death give it over to the devil and let him kill it give it over to God a minute and let him kill the devil that's in you come forward to the elders knee of cancer Devils out of you don't

ha loves you out then that God Prentiss on life in you then it's not you no more it's God's life Amen in you then it's not you no more it's God's life because it's God's Word watered by the Holy Spirit will produce the same thing the word is in you the seventh on the revelation is the word that is in you for 22 years and now the water is here to water that seed it's already in you everything is prep you can't break it and these three phases that was here in the second coming of the Lord brotherly love holy decency placing the Christ here in there your soul yes sir and you say page 34 a really thought upon the Bible in the Bible's got to be in you that's why every mystery was in the parable the seven thunders open it up and we preached it here and now is in you the Bible is in you you're walking Bible all you need is water to pour the water on you hey Mon the word is a seed as long as this lane here won't do nothing amen but when it comes in here when it comes into the heart then it begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit the works of God then visions come power comes humility comes all you know it all is gone you become nothing Christ becomes the line you die he lives there it is because he died I live when I die he lives again when I die he promised me lying and I died out to myself so all I could have his life and how do I do it by taking his word his seed put his seed in here by faith and believe him then it produces exactly what the Bible said and the season in the time and we end the time and we end the season now I declared to be soul yes sir read page 42 it's all right so all so believers of the word and spirits who back to word and spirit we actually now took all these year 30 years to get back to what brother branmer originally preached the spoken words original see we finally come back to it back to the Bible back to the Bible principles laid down on the day of Pentecost we're finally out here oh my alright so believers that of the word and spirit must be one you get it believe it's the word and the spirit absolutely one you don't do your own thinking now and I'm gonna strike my text here now you don't do your own thinking you don't use your own mind isn't that wonderful the - in Christ is in you see I might not intelligence huh the mine is in Christ and you will take the word just like he did because he was the word and the mind of Christ in you you are the word you that you a God's living worried representatives of him on earth here on earth continuing the work then right the church should be that way and when so the Bible is manifested again like in the early days of the disciples just like the disciples the Bible does living again in you right here now on the third phase for another book of Acts if that orange branch ever puts out another branch praise God it'll be oranges and we're here Oh hallelujah praise God okay may be seated here's a promise to you without the Holy Ghost but there's hell on you held on and you're held on well here's your promise all right when so the Bible's manifested again like in early days of Christ because you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was and when the rain falls on the seed the life produces itself when the Holy Spirit falls when it fell on those seed that Jesus said he chose them when before the foundation of the world then they were a predestinate at seat is that right and first they knew that your name was in written in heaven and then Peter had a revelation still did have the Holy Ghost and then in st. Luke 24 he opened the understanding to joelle to 28 you mean that that's what Jowell meant in the last day they pour out the Spirit on us and Jesus said yes what a revelation my god the understanding was open and it went up into the upper room with praising God with joy returned to Jerusalem with joy without the Holy Ghost because they knew that they knew it was coming down and we're here we got the sign into heaven oh my god you know it's coming down here we go you may be seated Hey glory glory yes siree okay wait am i here amen yes here we are you may be seated all right then the Bible's manifest again like it in their early days you best see us right that right then here they the 120 Hall themselves up in the upper room these seeds the word that's you without the Holy Ghost and the word was laying on there without life in it that's where you are right now if you don't have the Holy Ghost the word is laying there without the life amen so the word that was laying there he excuse me the home says up there where was laying on there without life in it all of a sudden they came of sound from heaven as the waters began to gush down gonna pour it out and here come the water I got on all you dry seats my what a promise water promise my the water began to gush down it actually fill all the house where they were sitting and the seeds begin to grow it began to manifest itself the word our God being manifested and we are right back there now man no man can change the praise God we're here now all right he may be seated yes sir now and if the marine of Christ is in you amen and and then you then his voice is in you that correct if the mind is in you which is a spirit then his voice is in you well then let's let's say it then seven Church HD book page 239 revelation 10 seven I can skip on down because the time was getting away here thus say he said he will hear only from God he would have thus saith the Lord and speak of God he would be God's mouthpiece and he as it is declared in Malachi 4 6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the father's he'll bring back the elect of the last day and they were here vindicated prophet give the exact truth as the one would appall he will restore to the truth as they had it and those elect with him and that day will be the ones who truly manifests the Lord and be his body and be his voice and performed his works hallelujah do you see it page 340 God raised up others and so has it going on through the years until in this last day there's two getting other people in the land who honor that messenger would be the final voice to the final age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is his own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confirm her through the Prophet in the pride for the voice of God will be in her yes sir for it says the last chapter here's my Birds revelation 17 last chapter 22 the spirit and the bride say come that's why I'm preaching today I don't know what I'm talking about Amen the spirit the bride say come the same God that give me this he also gave me and of some have compassion from the word from Jude the last book before the Bible man before the revelation rather they're correct before that you can open that book of Revelation and if somehow compassion forgiveness then September 20th he opened the book of Revelation seven thunders seven voices seven church ages now here we are in the last chapter chapter 22 verse 17 spearing the branch they come I don't know whether you're picking up what I'm saying praise God hallelujah yes sir we may be seen it Amen who wanted that messenger amen we had my head the mouthpiece of God amen okay be the final voice of finely aged church don't long as a mouthpiece is turning on that's right the spirit of Brian said come once more the world will hear a direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as it was in the first place amen and then once more page 365 the God will reveal the truth they did to Paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the Laodicean age its messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as real to Paul he will speak out those who receive the prophet in his own name who received the benefits the beneficent effect of that promise ministry and they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that brand that last day who were mentioned revelation 22:17 that's why I'm preaching it today because you are part of that bride here today and tonight and down in Pennsylvania Hank and if the tape goes around the world whoever it is doesn't matter the spirit of bride say come the corn wheat a fell down the ground has come back to original green what he says Amen or what he says what the Prophet says from God the

mighty power Malachi 4 said on a word made flesh I believe it's on the road that when the church would be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind slowed away from themselves that they don't see their themselves they don't have no motives and but serve God when their thoughts move on when they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit they just live in the spirit moving the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity why because uh because deity will be revealed in a human being by the Holy Spirit bringing the passive thoughts of their mind unquote hallelujah oh my god God will be failed behind you it'll be the manifestation of the self same person the bride and a dragon will be one which will be the intelligence the mind of Christ controlling is Brad so truly a call to perfection by the spoken revealed Word is here that's

brother man said that there would be a carryover time question answer on the seven seals amen and now a question 33 now there would be a carryover time of course one message carrying to the other one it will come right in like this you see as I explained that see it like Paul to the Gentiles now the Star of David amen currency last week I thought I just bring some of it back here now as we discovered the Star of David will be weaving in and out of the heavens in the orbits of planets in our solar system over the next several weeks and we're under now the star David we've and in and out

people's on fire they hear burning there's a fire in the building my god praise God good now something huh Loreena got a man somewhere somehow this blessing was set in motion at the beginning of time and we have been given the eyes to see from the Prophet Malachi 4 this is an amazing consciousness a raising event like the birth of a miracle the White Buffalo what the Indians are looking for or even a star Bethlehem the sign of the star in the heavens is a mighty clarion call to people everywhere it's the voice of the archangel calling them to the resurrection Omar has that reflecting the morning star his hair is coming a different message to take your here Run For Your Lives hey you see escape death to get out of here a lot you church member you get out of there praise God another message hallelujah then he goes into David strains all about David David represents dispensing and giving out a line like a river fans out into a two dimensional plane because it's the star David is two demons like you say it dispenses itself into the sea at a delta does it Hebrew the double triangle known as the mogen David represents the dispensation of ongoing manifestation didn't you know talking about on going once it falls not 83 when it stopped but on going to the resurrection to pour into Benjamin Oh hallelujah my God my God on going yes sir other words with my hands here amen on ongoing manifestation that's what it is in other words the double triangle represents the way one deep dimension pours itself out into the next dimension from the Gentiles to the Jews the same Christ that come through the Prophet will come through mostly in Elijah and call 144,000 right out of their ongoing no stopping hallelujah this revival has started Oh hallelujah praise God dimension it pours herself out into the next dimension just like the way of seed pours itself out until it becomes fruit amen this is a sacred process and a sacred path it's an animation of the hero's journey which is Christ of course expressing a sequence of geometric snapshots this is a true meaning of the double triangle it models the critical point of life this process of self unfurling from generation to generation endlessly praise God oh who do you say this is do you get a church think I think you know in other words the Star of David the double triangle represents the way one dimension the Gentiles pours in itself out into the next dimension just like the way of seed pours or sell out into become a fruit soul praise go well we finished hallelujah my brother Bram sent here Jesus Christ the same New York New York 8:24 54 I'm looking for the council one day to lead the Gentile people return to the Jew I've seen the picture of the night a very dear friend of mine on the west coast a Christian businessman mr. organ bright and he had a picture called three minutes at midnight I've never been the same since then after seeing this wonderful picture it showed the answers of all the prophecies pertained to the Jews how they believed return back and how they'd be an ensign at their return the six point star David over Jerusalem this is 1954 in New York huh and he said there would be a 6-point star of david' over jerusalem but it also appeared over New York City at the same time I tell you look friends I don't know whether to run down the aisle and shout what to do amen Sixpoint star over jerusalem how that the water that comes from the country to blossom as a role see the water again the desert wood in the Jews returning Bank it was just a picture threw it on the screen but

church will be caught up the gospel goes to the Jews amen and where we were staying in on the same message right here in New York but what I think the law is gonna make his message so quick to the world is this that he's gonna send out the power and the demonstration of the holy spirit that this illuminate the whole world in just a few days time I believe he's calling a church pulling up people
