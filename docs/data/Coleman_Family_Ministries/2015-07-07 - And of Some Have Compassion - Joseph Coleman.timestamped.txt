[5:27] name and his sake amen amen you may be
[5:30] seated oh we're certainly happy tonight
[5:32] to be gathered here in the house of the
[5:35] Lord under this uh pyramid villing amen
[5:39] looks like a a pyramid to me I think
[5:42] it's fitting in this hour to be sitting
[5:44] in the pyramid praise the Lord amen and
[5:47] so we're certainly happy to be here
[5:49] tonight and we certainly thank brother L
[5:51] for those gracious words for um as
[5:54] brother B always said praise the Lord
[5:57] rather receive a bouquet now than a
[5:59] wreath on Your Grave so we thank you
[6:02] Lord for every kind word that is spoken
[6:04] for the prophet of God did exhort us to
[6:05] say something nice and say something
[6:07] good amen so we try to say something
[6:09] nice and good to one another and you
[6:12] know what that does it brings the spirit
[6:13] of the Lord on the scene and all the old
[6:15] doubt and funny Spirits move away
[6:18] because they don't like anything nice
[6:19] and good Jesus loves it amen praise the
[6:22] Lord so we thank God for that and now I
[6:26] wanted to say that I feel that we're
[6:28] looking at ES tonight the bride that was
[6:31] called out of Lea because aashi uh in
[6:35] type and Esther or the lean Church she
[6:37] refused the headship see and therefore
[6:40] he had to put her away and he called
[6:42] Esther amen Esther's sitting here
[6:44] tonight praise the Lord and the unic
[6:47] they're sitting behind me and they've
[6:48] been feeding Esther praise God for them
[6:51] amen and now we realize that when Esther
[6:54] was called that a ha guy he was a
[6:57] chamber in I believe and what the Bible
[6:59] said says that Esther listened to
[7:01] everything that Hagi told her to wear
[7:04] and to use that would please the king
[7:06] for Hagi a feels a type of the Holy
[7:08] Ghost and he knew just what the king
[7:10] wanted so Esther listened to Hagi and
[7:13] then the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit
[7:15] has revealed to us just what the king
[7:17] loves and that is the word to be in
[7:19] obedience to the word of God and then uh
[7:22] when Esther went out the king just loved
[7:24] her and he put the the crown up on her
[7:27] head and then she received a headship
[7:30] the word that uh vashi turned down and
[7:33] but a Time came uh I believe it was in
[7:35] Exodus uh exod 4 the fourth chapter
[7:38] where um uh hmon was a foot and he was
[7:42] getting ready to move against uh God's
[7:45] people and there was one who was trained
[7:47] and called for the job to be ready to go
[7:50] out and stand against a hmon and the
[7:53] world Cel in them and that was Esther
[7:55] praise the Lord and then but Esther was
[7:57] safe in the Kingdom there she knew knew
[7:59] she was the bride but morai he exalted
[8:02] her that there's yet other people there
[8:04] and that's the way we feel going after
[8:06] the loss amen and then Esther was told
[8:09] to go into the king and it was death to
[8:12] go in unless the king called you in
[8:13] there see and to come into His presence
[8:16] but thank God that God has made a way
[8:18] for us to walk into his presence through
[8:21] this bloody message of Malachi 4 praise
[8:24] God as the blood Aton has laid out the
[8:26] way we and Esther had courage to go in
[8:29] here for she said for such a time this
[8:31] how do you know that you aren't called
[8:32] tonight for such a time as this do you
[8:35] believe friend that you were called for
[8:37] such a time as this this very hour to be
[8:40] able to walk into the king's presence
[8:43] and when you she walked in there she put
[8:45] on her royal apparel and the crown on
[8:47] the head she walked into his presence he
[8:49] was so moved when he saw how beautiful
[8:52] she was dressed in her gown in the
[8:55] headship the word all over her that he
[8:57] he just loved the way she looked and he
[8:59] put out the scepter The Authority said
[9:02] whatever you want Esther whatever you
[9:05] want just anything you want you want to
[9:07] be healed you want the Holy Ghost uh you
[9:09] want your loved one to be saved you can
[9:11] ask anything you want even to half of my
[9:14] kingdom you can have it oh I see that
[9:16] scepter stretched out here tonight don't
[9:18] you see it friends it's hanging all over
[9:20] the place it is the authority of Jesus
[9:23] Christ that he wants to hand the bride
[9:26] oh I feel it can happen tonight praise
[9:30] God and now I wanted to say I certainly
[9:33] enjoyed the messages this morning
[9:35] brother yonir and brother roseni was
[9:38] here and brother roseni he gave us
[9:40] cornbread and beans we certainly thank
[9:42] the Lord for the doctrine going forth
[9:44] brother Young from Belgium came along
[9:46] gave us ice cream and
[9:48] cake praise the Lord he certainly happy
[9:51] for that we like we got to have the
[9:52] cornbread and beans we got and we like
[9:55] the ice cream and cake also so it was
[9:57] wonderful this afternoon and uh uh we're
[10:00] trusting that uh the Lord will give us
[10:02] something tonight and I'm trusting and
[10:04] praying that the sick will be healed
[10:06] with a word tonight you know and um
[10:09] thinking about that there I have
[10:10] something here um this note was given to
[10:14] me by Brother Jack Palmer two years ago
[10:17] and Jeff and I don't think he knows
[10:19] anything about it because he may have
[10:20] forgotten about it and he gave me this
[10:22] year and I've kept it in my Bible for 2
[10:25] years and never uh thinking that I would
[10:27] be here with brother Jack palmer but
[10:30] this is what he gave me uh a message
[10:33] then Jesus came jonville Indiana 4757
[10:37] quote I was just inspired to speak them
[10:39] words and say that some glorious day at
[10:42] all of the gifts that is in the church
[10:44] would would just be set aside on the
[10:46] mantle as it was and the Holy Spirit
[10:49] himself would just take the church in
[10:51] such a control of divine love until the
[10:54] sick will be healed the blind will see
[10:57] the lame will walk with without being
[10:59] hands laid on them it'll be just one
[11:02] great Unity well praise God Brother
[11:06] Tech may he didn't know it but may that
[11:09] come to pass
[11:11] tonight I'm hoping that God cap this off
[11:14] tonight for he's the one that had the
[11:16] faith and the burden to get God's people
[11:19] together here in spite of understandings
[11:21] and this one and that one he didn't care
[11:23] he had a he had something in his heart
[11:25] burning to get God's people together and
[11:27] so therefore I as Minister I don't feel
[11:29] worthy to even be standing here so many
[11:31] fign brothers here and such a fign
[11:34] spirit here that any Minister could
[11:36] stand up here and speak tonight I heard
[11:38] brother Jack Bell last year Speaking In
[11:40] This Very spot on healing and it was a
[11:42] tremendous message so therefore just a
[11:44] night of healing but I just want to see
[11:47] uh the Lord bless brother Jack for his
[11:49] faith and his church and what they did
[11:51] to bring us together I think we should
[11:53] really uh pray for him and and also
[11:56] because appreciate him for what he's
[11:57] done praise God for brother Jack and now
[12:00] um tonight is healing and so now we know
[12:04] that uh we can have uh um healing even
[12:07] without hands laid Upon Us St Mark 11:23
[12:11] whatever you want whatever you believe
[12:12] in your heart and you say it it shall
[12:14] come to pass or we can have hands late
[12:16] on also St Mark 16 is still the word but
[12:19] it's up to you whatever you want amen I
[12:21] just want to give you a little testimony
[12:23] in my own church December the 2nd last
[12:26] year 73 I believe it was brother n i was
[12:28] have to be up and he was there and a
[12:31] sister in our church was there and she
[12:33] had uh what had happened I had came into
[12:35] the church a little late and she had
[12:37] missed her prayer request and she had a
[12:40] tremendous boil up underneath of her arm
[12:42] and that morning I was reading uh the
[12:45] message end time seed signs brother
[12:47] Sparks Edition and there brother Brandon
[12:49] was reiterating how he was teaching his
[12:51] church in Indiana on the greatest belly
[12:54] of a fort how there a woman on the
[12:56] stretcher a young lady laying on the
[12:58] stretcher and he just looked at her and
[13:00] went ahead and preached the word and
[13:02] when he finished preaching that message
[13:04] the greatest battle ever fought the
[13:06] woman got up off the stretcher and
[13:08] walked out amen so I was reading that
[13:11] over and that morning I was inspired to
[13:13] reading that there and came into the
[13:14] church and they handed me the note I
[13:16] walk into the pulpit and with that up my
[13:19] heart I prayed that when the word while
[13:21] the word yet went forth whether she be
[13:23] in the basement or the balcony cuz the
[13:25] word can find you you know I don't care
[13:27] where you go at that a word go on and
[13:29] find her sitting in her seat and brother
[13:32] Ned will can give witness to it he was
[13:34] there and that afternoon she called back
[13:36] to my wife and said that before the
[13:39] message was over she felt something
[13:41] trickling down her sleeve and had busted
[13:44] open by the word of God I believe God
[13:47] can burst open cancers tonight I believe
[13:50] he can bust open anything tonight amen

[13:55] world praise God that's the way I feel
[13:59] tonight friends so I feel that those who

[16:34] veil that is to say his flesh and having
[16:37] an high priest over the house of God let
[16:40] us draw near with a True Heart in full
[16:42] Assurance of Faith having our hearts
[16:45] sprinkled from an evil conscience and

[16:56] promise and let us consider one another
[16:59] to to provoke unto love and to good
[17:03] works and Jud
[17:07] 22 and of some have compassion making a
[17:11] difference and others Sav with fear
[17:14] pulling them out of the fire hating even
[17:16] the garments spoted by the flesh now
[17:19] unto him that is able to keep you from
[17:22] falling and present you faultless before
[17:25] the presence of his glory with exceeding
[17:28] Joy may God add a blessing to the
[17:31] reading of his word can you imagine that
[17:34] God is able to present Us faultless
[17:36] Praise just that one thought alone is
[17:39] enough to sit down for a million years
[17:40] and think about it the grace of almighty
[17:43] God faultless blameless
[17:46] spotless praise God that's the way he
[17:48] sees us right here tonight i' like to
[17:50] take a a photo out of here and of some
[17:55] have compassion that's my burden tonight

[18:02] that you have to hear a lot of strange
[18:05] doctrines to know what's going on no uh

[18:10] you can discern what's going
[18:13] on Amen see we don't have to hear a lot
[18:16] of funny things we just want to hear the
[18:17] truth and then when the funny things
[18:20] come along we know what it is and we
[18:22] have peace because that's the way like
[18:24] in the natural in the uh Banks they
[18:27] train their Bank tellers on the real
[18:30] dollar bills not the eait ones and they
[18:34] learn how to count the money with the

[19:09] is praise the Lord do you believe that

[20:40] God for it amen so now and brother Bram
[20:43] taught us that when Jesus cursed the Fig
[20:45] Tree uh that it was already moving away

[21:12] God used brother brand to show us those
[21:15] five manifestation and all those signs
[21:18] wonders and miracles that was to show us
[21:20] that it could be done first and all we

[21:50] now it said that a helpless Sparrow can
[21:52] drift With the Wind see but it takes an
[21:55] eagle to fly against the storms of
[21:57] Dallas and unbelief and see through the
[21:59] storms and see the promises of God on
[22:01] the other side oh I can see the eagles
[22:03] with their wings spread out tonight amen
[22:06] ready to fly with every promise of God
[22:09] let the current the Holy Spirit just
[22:10] sweep you up you go places you've never
[22:13] been before I believe that amen but all
[22:17] we have to do now is take both the Old
[22:19] and the New Testament I believe that God
[22:22] can take any portion of this Bible and
[22:24] interpret through
[22:25] you wherever I don't care whether it's
[22:27] it the book of ecclesiastics or the Book
[22:29] of Esther that can be interpreted
[22:31] through you yes sir I believe that
[22:33] tonight excuse me now
[22:35] tonight my message is dedicated uh to
[22:38] the Statue of a perfect man but somehow
[22:41] I feel that that message is a key
[22:43] message for the bride and so much so
[22:47] that um brother brandom uh this was part
[22:50] of the stor of food and I even believe
[22:53] that brother Billy Paul even had a dream
[22:55] about this here hope he don't mind me
[22:57] saying it but he did have a dream
[22:58] because he made it public so I suppose
[23:00] it's okay to say it and had a dream of I
[23:03] think it was 19 tapes and so forth like
[23:05] that and brother BR was saying in the
[23:07] dream to him before Paul you can come to
[23:09] me or I can come to you there's a
[23:11] condition and these tapes and it's 19
[23:14] and they must have these 19 and I never
[23:17] forgot that you know and it stuck to me
[23:20] and then um he said well because how
[23:22] would I know what it how would it be he
[23:24] said it would be like a statue of a
[23:25] perfect man and that was the only tape
[23:28] that he named in that dream so brother
[23:31] I've been searching this book for a long
[23:33] time amen for the prophet gave it to his
[23:36] son in a dream there's got to be
[23:37] something in here somewhere for he named
[23:39] this book right here the only one so
[23:41] therefore let us go back to this book it
[23:43] maybe something is in here praise God
[23:46] and so therefore it was beautiful and I
[23:48] began to chase Billy Paul for I saw
[23:50] something in the word and having a dream
[23:53] like that I saw his dream in the Bible
[23:55] for it's in the Bible in Leviticus 2
[23:58] and Deuteronomy 288 for God commands a
[24:02] blessing on the
[24:03] storehouses Amen on everybody's
[24:05] Storehouse there's a commanded blessing
[24:07] which is a different blessing from an
[24:09] ordinary blessing a commanded one from
[24:11] Heaven upon the storehouse praise God
[24:15] and so therefore brother Billy Paul move
[24:17] under this commanded blessing and open
[24:19] up the storehouse and we've been going
[24:21] there all these years and so I saw that
[24:24] in 68 I wanted to tell them about it I
[24:26] never got a chance to tell them but tell
[24:28] him tonight amen but anyway in cuz back
[24:31] in there in in
[24:32] Leviticus 25th chapter verse 1 through
[24:36] uh six it says sold the seed for six
[24:39] years but guys want to strike the 20th
[24:42] verse here and if you shall say what
[24:44] shall we eat the seventh year behold we
[24:46] shall not swow nor gather because in our
[24:49] increas then I will command my blessing
[24:52] upon you in the sixth year and it shall
[24:54] bring forth fruit for three years you
[24:56] shall s the eight year and eat yet of
[24:59] the old fruit that's the old Storehouse
[25:01] tapes until the ninth year until her
[25:03] fruits come in ye shall eat of the old
[25:07] store oh I saw his head this these tapes
[25:11] would be right here to the Harvest amen
[25:13] the old fruit would be right here and
[25:15] then I saw from' 66 through 1971 was 6
[25:19] years of sewing I saw the ministry here
[25:22] sewing that seed I saw in their places
[25:25] there I saw brother Billy Paul doing he
[25:26] was supposed to do playing those tapes
[25:28] in that Storehouse I said how wonderful
[25:30] this is everybody's in their own order
[25:32] doing what they want doing what they're
[25:33] supposed to do by led by God and we have
[25:36] got to come to a spot in the ninth year
[25:39] somewhere in there where's going to be a
[25:41] unity in there somewhere amen it's got
[25:44] to be I feel it it lays in here
[25:46] somewhere praise the Lord so when I saw
[25:48] that there and then we had a little uh
[25:51] typ for this in our own church for
[25:53] brother Hunt labored for 66 through 71
[25:56] and in October
[25:58] 1971 two hippie types beards and boots
[26:01] and all Jesus people walked into our
[26:03] church in October and we was preaching
[26:06] there and then the Holy Spirit was all
[26:07] around them and we didn't quite
[26:09] understand it this was in our sixth year
[26:11] and we didn't get it and then after the
[26:13] service I threw everything with the
[26:14] kitchen sink at them trying to
[26:16] understand it the beards and whatnot and
[26:18] trying to figure out what it meant and
[26:20] they just ate it up praise God next
[26:23] thing I know they were baptized they
[26:25] were from New Jersey and then not even
[26:28] known in the sixth year there was a
[26:29] commanded blessing for for New York City
[26:32] and then in the seventh Year brother
[26:34] hunai was laboring we were tired and
[26:36] weary from just pounding away sowing
[26:38] that seed sowing it Faithfully staying
[26:40] at the post and the seventh Year God
[26:42] gave brother H rest for these two
[26:44] brothers begin to bring them in from New
[26:46] Jersey and brother they begin to come
[26:49] into our church from January 72 all the
[26:52] way around and we begin to eat in the
[26:55] seventh year we didn't have to do
[26:57] nothing we just baptized them and our
[26:59] own people they ate as they saw the new
[27:01] souls coming in what a rest what a
[27:04] refreshing it was that was God taking
[27:07] the portion of the word in Leviticus and
[27:10] interpret it in New York City in this
[27:13] day I know what I'm talking about for
[27:17] I've seen God vindicate just this right
[27:19] here in our own time in
[27:21] 1972 and then in the eighth year he says
[27:24] sold that seed and last year we sold the
[27:28] seed from Faith all the way up to
[27:30] brotherly kindness to adoption praise
[27:33] God to Rapture in Grace rapturing Faith
[27:35] Divine love amen the Resurrection The
[27:38] Rapture the wedding supper the whole bit
[27:41] last year the church was sold down the
[27:44] old times is with these new people
[27:45] coming in in 1972 71 everybody was sold
[27:49] down together with the original seed and
[27:52] New York cities here I they're waiting
[27:54] and looking with their with their cups
[27:56] empty amen looking up for God to pour it
[28:00] down I know you're here also for the
[28:01] same thing and then this being the last
[28:04] year was the eighth year and says keep
[28:07] eating from the old fruit the storehouse
[28:09] the tapes until the ninth year until her
[28:12] crops come in am oh my this is the ninth
[28:17] year friends 8 and 1/2 years already and
[28:20] I feel that the sewing time is over I
[28:23] feel that there's got to come forth an
[28:24] end Gathering what a beautiful month to
[28:27] have end Gathering of the wheat in June
[28:29] right down here in Georgia praise the
[28:32] Lord my I'm looking for end gathering

[28:37] wheat has been gathered here in Georgia
[28:39] tonight amen and I believe we are right
[28:43] I believe we are mature I believe we are
[28:46] ready to manifest the Brotherly Love
[28:50] That is supposed to be our virtue in the
[28:52] top of the pyramid and then when Jesus
[28:55] can look down tonight and see faith and
[28:59] virtue and patience and godliness and
[29:01] knowledge and brotherly kindness the
[29:04] honey stuck in the rock box fith then
[29:07] he'll seal it up praise God and we'll
[29:11] see a statue of a perfect man oh my you
[29:16] brother believe it all in the back over
[29:17] here brother I'm looking for it and
[29:19] that's what he said anyway I just want
[29:21] to read to you about five minutes of so
[29:23] from page six here statue of a perfect
[29:26] man want to read something to you page
[29:28] six now we approaching the Seven Seals
[29:31] we just finished the seven Church ages
[29:33] and this is a message on teaching that
[29:35] ties a man in that's going to be
[29:37] Redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus
[29:40] and is going to be in that church Age
[29:42] The Eternal Church age at the end of the
[29:46] seals that's the one that that I want to
[29:48] be in and now brother Bram took his
[29:51] church in ' 62 and he stood him up and
[29:54] he made him pledge and he said these
[29:57] words words on page 65 add to your faith
[29:59] virtue add to your virtue knowledge to
[30:02] your knowledge Temperance to your
[30:03] Temperance patience to your patience
[30:05] godliness to your godliness brotherly
[30:07] love to your brotherly love the Holy
[30:10] Spirit and Christ will come because just
[30:13] beneath him the holy spirit is the
[30:15] spirit of Christ into the church to
[30:17] manifest those virtues I pledge this
[30:20] morning to him with all my heart that by
[30:23] his help and by his grace I pray that
[30:26] I'll seek daily without ceasing until I
[30:29] feel every one of these requirements
[30:31] flowing in this little old statue of
[30:34] mine till I can be a manifestation of
[30:37] the living Christ for he became sin like
[30:40] me that I might become righteousness of
[30:42] God like him he took my place Lord let
[30:45] me take his now because that's the
[30:48] purpose he died for I love him I pledge
[30:52] it Lord this church pledges it the full
[30:54] stature of Jesus Christ amen my I said
[30:58] might has got to be something laying in
[31:00] there somewhere and I sure am looking
[31:03] for that Living Image for brother BR
[31:05] said then you'll see Sons and Daughters
[31:08] of God living monuments images of Jesus
[31:11] Christ that's what he died for that's
[31:13] what he's coming back for and I feel
[31:15] that something can happen before these
[31:17] Services is over to start us to push us
[31:20] off toward what we're talking about here
[31:23] in this book right here page 52 isn't
[31:26] that wonderful and then God through that
[31:29] has brought also seven Church agents to
[31:31] show those seven steps that he brought
[31:34] building his individual Into His Image
[31:36] he has built a complete Church in His
[31:37] image at the resurrection this complete
[31:40] body will be raised up to live with him
[31:42] forever because it is a bride so that
[31:44] cuts in every age every age comes and he
[31:47] goes on reading here in Hebrews 11 and
[31:50] he reads on this wise and speaking about
[31:52] those who wanded about in deserts
[31:54] mountains and dens and and caves of the
[31:55] earth and these all having obtained a
[31:57] good report through faith here a good
[32:00] report through faith not receive not the
[32:03] promise God having provide some better
[32:06] thing for us that they without us should
[32:08] not be made perfect you get it these
[32:10] people who died in here are depending
[32:13] and waiting on us so this church has got
[32:16] to come to perfection in order to bring
[32:19] the
[32:20] resurrection my what a calling we have
[32:24] what a vocation you and mere mortal
[32:28] human beings and even brother Billy Paul
[32:31] in the dream there he said Paul before
[32:33] you can come to me and I can come to you
[32:35] there's something here has got to be
[32:36] made here praise God I want this
[32:39] somewhere in here somewhere and this was
[32:41] the tape that he named and here these
[32:43] people over here cannot come to us and
[32:45] we can't go to them until this church
[32:47] here comes to
[32:49] Perfection the prophet's own words in
[32:52] here I know it's got to mean something
[32:54] but I'm looking for something like this
[32:57] to happen here friends aren't you
[32:59] looking for the same thing amen I know I
[33:01] am well in second Peter this very
[33:04] message here says that by these promises
[33:06] the word we might be made partakers of
[33:09] his divine nature so then we we realize
[33:13] that it is through God's nature uh
[33:15] through these promises rather that we
[33:17] will be made partaker of his nature now
[33:20] the token is the life which is the word
[33:23] he allowed this life seed to grow in him
[33:27] like I spoke last night for 30 years by
[33:30] the promises brother Brandon of the Holy
[33:33] Spirit of
[33:34] nature of God came into brother brandom
[33:37] through the
[33:38] promises and it's got to come to us by
[33:41] the promises a much short of time but
[33:44] it's still got to come by the promises
[33:46] and brother brandom hacked the promises
[33:48] out for himself against the entire world
[33:52] Amen and then the anointing come down
[33:55] and brought the out the life of the word
[33:58] and we have the promised word in us God
[34:02] like we were saying last night he
[34:04] compressed the Holy
[34:06] Spirit like an accordion and slipped it
[34:10] into our hearts for 8 and 1/2 years and
[34:13] sold a seed now he's getting ready to
[34:15] expand our borders amen amen oh my when
[34:19] he expands our borders the full of the
[34:21] Holy Spirit just comes around us the
[34:23] canopy of Life D Drops over us and we
[34:27] Under The Canopy of life and we become
[34:30] living monuments then the charity comes
[34:32] down and then we see a living faith a
[34:35] living knowledge a living Temperance a
[34:37] living uh uh uh virtue a living patience
[34:41] a living brotherly kindness when the
[34:43] charity does it the anointing of God and
[34:46] we're all waiting for that I know we are
[34:48] amen but we had to go through heartaches
[34:51] and testings and trials and temptations
[34:54] to literally die out to ourselves but
[34:56] but he showed us the way and it can be
[34:58] done he also provided the way he said
[35:01] this will bring to pass a tremendous
[35:03] victory in the love divine so I'm
[35:06] looking for the love divine to mate with
[35:09] the word and the two become one and the
[35:12] token I feel was his keynote message in
[35:15] 63 but he said that was my greatest
[35:17] message by inspiration outside of the
[35:20] Seven Seals those were a direct
[35:22] commission but he said uh that was uh uh
[35:25] by inspiration so something inspiration
[35:28] I feel that God wants to reveal to the
[35:31] bride how to get out of the
[35:33] way oh if he would do it
[35:36] tonight reveal to us to get ourselves
[35:39] out of the way that we might see Jesus
[35:43] the Greeks said we would see
[35:46] Jesus amen the world is wanting to see
[35:49] Jesus they want to hear about they want
[35:51] to see them amen this is a see and age
[35:54] they want to see it and we have have the
[35:57] calling to produce Jesus Christ to be a
[36:01] reproduction of Jesus Christ through the
[36:04] seed sperm word that's already in us
[36:07] already every promise in there already
[36:10] all we need to do for God to come down
[36:12] and bring it out so I feel that the Seed
[36:15] of Abraham Christ is in the bride and
[36:17] the bride like Malachi 4 adds The Life
[36:20] of Christ by the promises and the
[36:23] promises must be sold must be preached
[36:25] by the ministry or if you don't have a
[36:26] minister you hear the tapes and so forth
[36:28] you have a minister to hear the tapes
[36:29] and hear them preach also and read the
[36:31] books as long as this so this message is
[36:34] solded in there long as you know it's a
[36:36] Bible promise praise God if a donkey
[36:39] speak it long it's a Bible promise amen
[36:42] amen God can use donkeys anything he
[36:44] want to do to speak the word of
[36:46] God we ain't
[36:49] nobody amen praise God if he use a
[36:51] donkey he ain't got no mind of his own
[36:55] anyway
[36:57] amen see so therefore oh God make me a
[37:00] donkey tonight amen every promise is
[37:03] quickened by the word of God enabling us
[37:06] to add the life to the seed now
[37:08] brotherly kindness is a is a forgiveness
[37:11] it's the virtue our feel of the hour
[37:14] that's burning in my heart uh it must be
[37:16] displayed it must be ripe it must be
[37:19] seen and and the uh the Perfection the
[37:23] seed is the seed of God is the baptism
[37:26] of the Holy Ghost coming in and then now
[37:28] we're looking for fruit though this is
[37:30] the hour of the fruit way up in the top
[37:31] of the tree and the fruit is the Harvest
[37:34] of of the seed in the heart and that's
[37:36] charity that's the full word added to
[37:38] the seed now I feel tonight that the
[37:41] rightness is brotherly kindness
[37:44] forgiveness honey uh The Rock Box
[37:46] confession and I feel that charity seals
[37:49] a man up for service uh this is to take
[37:52] place as brother Bram said on so many
[37:54] tapes um uh the adoption and tapes and
[37:57] all what the Holy Ghost is given for and
[37:59] all so many of them Blasphemous names
[38:01] desperation we we know them all but he
[38:04] said that there he said that there will
[38:05] come forth a power of the Resurrection I
[38:08] think it's page five and what of the
[38:10] question answers on the Holy Ghost he
[38:12] said when the power of this church Rises
[38:15] the power of that church Rises to bring
[38:17] its Brethren when the power of the
[38:19] church in Georgia Rises the church in
[38:22] Jeff and Tucson and Alabama all around
[38:24] Rises the power of the Holy o moves in
[38:27] charity sweeps in you'll be caught up
[38:30] into charity into Rapture and Grace
[38:33] it'll bring you praise God it'll pick
[38:36] you up and reap you like a sheath coming
[38:38] up in the reaping season and you'll know
[38:41] who you are you'll know your son and a
[38:43] daughter of the Living God a living
[38:45] Monument praise God ready to work for
[38:48] the master or you have thust sayith the
[38:51] Lord you keep still you have the mind of
[38:55] God Zoe eternal life moving through your
[38:57] members praise God move here go there
[39:01] say this here it something's going to
[39:03] happen now friends cuz it's dust sayith
[39:05] the Lord or you keep still and you then
[39:08] oh God is wanting to put us into a
[39:09] position St John 5:19 a position in the
[39:14] word where he can show us anything in
[39:17] the word he can bring it to pass cuz
[39:20] Jesus Christ was in that position St
[39:23] John 5:19 I do nothing except the father
[39:25] show me revealed to me how to do and
[39:28] what to say and I do that oh if we can
[39:31] get that position tonight where we won't
[39:33] back up from any part of the word no
[39:36] matter it doesn't cope with our Doctrine
[39:37] or or our idea or not Lord God get my
[39:41] idea out of the way we all we've all
[39:44] found out all these years whenever God
[39:46] actually comes on the scene is always
[39:49] different from the way we thought it
[39:51] was I believe everybody can say Amen to
[39:54] that it's always been different from the
[39:57] way we actually had to figure it out in
[39:58] our own minds oh my amen brothers so
[40:03] therefore let us get our own minds out
[40:04] of the way what a tremendous calling we
[40:07] have tonight what a responsibility that
[40:10] we have we have a wonderful exaltation
[40:12] here tonight here in the book of Hebrews
[40:15] the 10th chapter here and um so we
[40:18] realize that through these promises of
[40:20] Charity we will be like him but it got
[40:23] to be a Bible promise and this is a
[40:24] Bible promise of add to your faith and
[40:28] so forth and the last thing is Charity
[40:30] now here every believer is a priest and
[40:33] is exhorted to enter into the holiest
[40:36] and to enjoy his full rights in Christ
[40:40] Christians today should exalt one
[40:42] another to faithfulness more and more
[40:45] amen as they see the day of Christ draws
[40:47] near come on brother help that brother
[40:49] help that sister come on come on now
[40:52] come on praise God I always believe this
[40:54] here brother Bram said to minent brother
[40:57] you're walking up to Mount Zion now and
[40:59] on the side is serpents hissing this way
[41:01] and that way don't fight them don't even
[41:04] look at him amen keep on walking up
[41:06] those bloody footprints on up to mount Z
[41:10] praise God keep moving on brother I
[41:13] don't care what those serpents are
[41:14] hissing about it don't mean anything
[41:17] anyway amen cuz he already spoke what
[41:20] means something is only one thing that
[41:23] means anything is the word of God this
[41:25] is life this is
[41:28] real amen praise
[41:31] God oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[41:34] assembling ourselves together
[41:36] considering one another oh how the lord
[41:39] loves to see us consider one another one
[41:42] another's feelings one another's
[41:44] thoughts how brother Brandon wouldn't
[41:45] even let no man open the the door for

[43:38] Christ therefore we have a charge men s
[43:41] to preach the word in season out of
[43:43] season oh what a charge to preach the
[43:46] word praise God I believe this is the
[43:49] season when the people will stop running
[43:51] from the word and they'll fall upon the
[43:53] sword and you put it in with love speak
[43:56] the truth in love not speak lovely the
[43:59] truth hallelujah just speak the truth in
[44:03] love amen praise the Lord you know the
[44:06] Ten Commandments the first four is our
[44:08] attitude toward God and the next six is
[44:10] our attitude toward our neighbor amen
[44:13] amen if you love your neighbor you will
[44:16] tell your neighbor about God first am
[44:18] and as a men if I love my neighbor
[44:20] that's you I'll tell you that God don't
[44:22] want no Idols before
[44:23] him amen amen because I love you I speak
[44:27] the truth about him first but I speak it
[44:30] in love for you so you know that amen
[44:33] praise God so now we are exalting one

[44:39] love and I'm here to exalt you praise
[44:43] God the people to enjoy their blood wash
[44:46] redeemed rights unto love and unity of
[44:49] the faith but now watch here there are
[44:52] many weak ones and those who don't
[44:53] understand God's Will and so therefore
[44:56] there's a scripture here and of some
[44:59] have
[45:00] compassion oh what a revelation Brothers
[45:04] there are weak ones there ignorant ones
[45:06] who don't don't have the same Revelation

[45:11] the word now back to the word every word
[45:15] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[45:18] every word that proceeded forth from the
[45:19] mouth of God therefore I'm not
[45:22] interested in what that brother believes
[45:24] us to believe in Malachi 4 that's the be
[45:26] the beginning there does they believe
[45:28] that well it may be all uh this way and

[1:19:18] his unbelief oh praise God the word says
[1:19:21] whosoever will let him come whoever is
[1:19:24] thirsty let him come I remember over
[1:19:27] here in Puerto Rica one of the churches
[1:19:30] over there they had a problem with the
[1:19:31] deacons in there they were very
[1:19:33] legalistic and some uh Spanish friends
[1:19:35] of ours wanted their backsliding for 10
[1:19:37] years and I got I went over there in
[1:19:40] March and got him to come to church and
[1:19:42] the man wanted to have his little baby
[1:19:45] dedicated and the Deacon wouldn't let
[1:19:47] the family in because the young daughter
[1:19:50] 15 had on a minis skirt and would let
[1:19:53] him in the house of God and I heard
[1:19:55] about it I was wrestling I came back on
[1:19:57] March 24th and God just and this same
[1:20:00] man I spoke with him Friday and then U
[1:20:03] he said well because I used to believe
[1:20:05] the message now I've been backsliding
[1:20:07] for 10 years and yall are talking about
[1:20:09] the bride and Rapture and Faith

[1:20:16] it's a revelation well because I can't
[1:20:17] have a revelation yes you can I said
[1:20:20] because Jesus Christ he lived by
[1:20:22] Revelation say John 5:19 you see so
[1:20:24] therefore he can give you Revelation
[1:20:26] also that very night he received a Dream

[1:25:16] Vision here excuse me he had a vision
[1:25:20] way back and this is what changed my my
[1:25:22] heart June the 6th first I wanted to to
[1:25:25] read about the middle of the road here
[1:25:27] in Divine Healing this is a book a
[1:25:29] brother down in Texas sent me and I read
[1:25:32] I read it to you Divine
[1:25:34] Healing I believe in grace but on the
[1:25:37] other hand I also believe in Holiness
[1:25:40] Isaiah said that there is a Highway the
[1:25:42] way of Holiness and any correctly built
[1:25:44] road is higher in the center than it is
[1:25:46] on the side so that the trash can wash
[1:25:49] off now when a man is Born Into the
[1:25:51] kingdom of God God he's put right
[1:25:54] straight in the middle of the road
[1:25:56] looking toward Christ the
[1:25:58] Savior and if he doesn't watch he'll
[1:26:00] gradually move over to one side where he
[1:26:04] gets so cold and starchy or he'll get
[1:26:06] into fanaticism but right in the middle
[1:26:08] of the road is a true San path of those
[1:26:12] who would obey the true Gospel of Jesus
[1:26:14] Christ it is a gospel that you don't
[1:26:17] have to be ashamed of it is the power
[1:26:19] and manifestation of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:22] isn't that wonderful amen we are not
[1:26:25] ashamed of the gospel for it is the
[1:26:27] power and the manifestation of the Holy
[1:26:30] Spirit like
[1:26:33] we all they need to do is to look to
[1:26:36] their Advocate that's all God will bring
[1:26:39] them back to Grace may God help to keep
[1:26:42] us balanced praise the
[1:26:45] Lord thank
[1:26:49] you thank you now we've always tried to
[1:26:54] stay in the middle of the road and not
[1:26:56] to get off to one side and that's a
[1:26:58] rough spot there in the middle cuz you
[1:27:00] have a cuz you have a pull from both
[1:27:02] sides amen and um as a minister of
[1:27:06] sewing sewing in heaven I believe a
[1:27:09] revelation by the grace of God of the
[1:27:12] true Holiness of God and what brother
[1:27:14] Bram stood for and we in New York wanted
[1:27:17] to walk that same middle of the road see
[1:27:20] wanted holding us everything right pure
[1:27:22] and church or whatever he said do it I
[1:27:24] mean the man was a
[1:27:26] prophet everything he said was for my
[1:27:30] church because his church was the
[1:27:33] bride and we was in The Bride but that's
[1:27:35] his church he said this is for my church
[1:27:39] well every marriage and divorce is for
[1:27:41] his church also so his church so
[1:27:43] everything else but if a brother ask me
[1:27:46] do you believe in I said well because
[1:27:47] you don't have to believe that see it's
[1:27:49] okay with you because I believe it see
[1:27:52] excuse me and then um think along those
[1:27:55] lines and like people don't understand
[1:27:57] you and you get and you get kind of
[1:27:59] weary and tired and then you see those
[1:28:01] who weaken they seem to be doing the
[1:28:03] same thing over and over and it just
[1:28:05] sort of give you maybe a complex and
[1:28:07] maybe you don't want to like preach no
[1:28:09] more to them see and you get into a
[1:28:11] corner and then June the 6th that
[1:28:14] morning there I was sitting there tired
[1:28:17] and weary and thinking about Georgia and
[1:28:19] wondering there like Jericho maybe
[1:28:21] what's going happen down
[1:28:23] there amen excuse me and then this come
[1:28:27] to me and I want to read it to you
[1:28:29] brother br's Vision the one because he
[1:28:31] had back here a few years ago a
[1:28:34] thrilling story of how a soul Was Won to
[1:28:36] Christ by Reverend William brandham and
[1:28:38] the name of it is and of some have
[1:28:41] compassion and that's when it struck me
[1:28:44] and I hope it strike you tonight the way
[1:28:46] it struck
[1:28:47] me friends there are so many things that
[1:28:50] we can say about Perfection it is so
[1:28:55] easy to try to gouge the eyes out of
[1:28:58] somebody else to make ourselves appear
[1:29:01] just a little holier than they but if we
[1:29:05] can only see the true picture it is only
[1:29:08] by God's grace that we are what we
[1:29:12] are praise God oh this is God speaking
[1:29:16] here amen some time ago in in Ohio where
[1:29:20] I was having a meeting I learned a
[1:29:23] lesson the hard way we had been eating
[1:29:25] at a little dunet restaurant where they
[1:29:29] had such lovely little ladylike
[1:29:31] waitresses decently dressed and and
[1:29:34] clean as it could be it was a real treat
[1:29:37] to eat in such a pleasant Place their
[1:29:39] kitchen was stick and span on Sunday
[1:29:42] they closed up and went to their
[1:29:44] church I was going to preach that Sunday
[1:29:47] afternoon and feeling a little hungry I
[1:29:50] went over to what looked like an
[1:29:53] ordinary Little American restaurant as I
[1:29:55] walked in the door what did I hear about
[1:29:58] a jukebox going full blast I looked
[1:30:01] toward the back of the building there
[1:30:03] was a bunch of teenage boys and girls
[1:30:05] playing those little rock and roll
[1:30:06] records on the machine a young woman
[1:30:09] about 18 years of age was standing there
[1:30:11] her dress hanging low in front let one
[1:30:13] of the boys act indecently towards her
[1:30:16] they were all smoking and drinking I
[1:30:17] thought oh God how can you see all this
[1:30:20] and stand it hearing somewhere make a
[1:30:22] big groan I looked over to my right and
[1:30:25] there sat an elderly woman probably 60
[1:30:27] or 70 years of age she had on those
[1:30:29] little skinny vcal clothes her poor old
[1:30:32] wrinkled flesh was just as flabby as it
[1:30:35] could be makeup cover to face her hair
[1:30:37] was cut real short curled up and dyed
[1:30:39] blue her fingernails were painted of
[1:30:42] Deep Purple the little open shoes she
[1:30:44] wore showed purple painted toenails I
[1:30:47] looked at her and two drunk men who sat
[1:30:50] across her table it was summertime but
[1:30:52] there was one sat with a big old army
[1:30:53] Overcoat on and a gray scarf wrapped
[1:30:55] around his neck long whisk were all over
[1:30:58] his face belching and his friend excused
[1:31:00] himself themselves from her and
[1:31:01] staggered to the restroom standing there
[1:31:04] I asked God why don't he destroy such
[1:31:07] ungodliness why he didn't just sink it
[1:31:09] beneath the earth I wondered if my
[1:31:11] little Sarah and Rebecca would have to
[1:31:13] grow up amid such stuff I said God how
[1:31:16] can you in your great Holiness ever
[1:31:19] stand to look at such a thing as that
[1:31:21] and not send an earthquake and sink it
[1:31:24] as I stood there condemning a woman I
[1:31:27] felt the spirit of God I stepped behind
[1:31:30] the door and a vision came to me I saw
[1:31:33] the world turning around and around with
[1:31:35] a Scarlet streak around it it came close
[1:31:38] until I saw myself son as a little boy
[1:31:40] doing things that I ought not to have
[1:31:42] done maybe cuz they weren't bad like I
[1:31:45] just saw but they were sin every time I
[1:31:48] did anything wrong I saw a great black
[1:31:50] shadow go toward towards heaven God
[1:31:53] would have had to slay me for that sin
[1:31:55] then I saw standing between God and Me
[1:31:57] Jesus Christ that perfect sacrifice amen
[1:32:02] oh I saw him standing there with the
[1:32:04] thorns on his head spit hanging on his
[1:32:07] face every time my sins was St toward
[1:32:09] God he would reach out and catch him
[1:32:12] like the bumper on a car he was
[1:32:14] protecting me from Death every time I
[1:32:16] would do anything wrong God's holiness
[1:32:19] required death for me certainly his Law
[1:32:22] requires but every time I would do
[1:32:24] anything wrong the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:32:27] acted like a bumper the Scarlet streak
[1:32:29] meant that the blood was availing for me
[1:32:32] I got a little closer to him and I could
[1:32:35] hear him say father forgive him he does
[1:32:37] not know what he's doing looking down I
[1:32:40] saw a book and a recording Angel there
[1:32:43] by his side he was recording my sins in
[1:32:46] the book which had my name on it I
[1:32:48] realized that someday that blood streak
[1:32:50] would be lifted and I would have to
[1:32:52] stand in the presence of God with my
[1:32:54] sinful life I saw that his Mercy was
[1:32:56] holding off my judgment humbly I went to
[1:32:59] him I knelt and said oh Jesus thou Son
[1:33:02] of God I am unworthy to come into your
[1:33:05] presence but will you please forgive me
[1:33:07] for what for what I have just done he
[1:33:10] touched his side with his hand and took
[1:33:12] the old book and wrote pardon on it
[1:33:15] threw it behind him my sins were
[1:33:18] gone then he looked at he looked me
[1:33:21] straight in the eyes as he said now I
[1:33:23] have forgiven you but you want to
[1:33:26] condemn her I saw then what it all meant
[1:33:30] and that's when I saw June the 6th this
[1:33:33] year what it all meant to me then he
[1:33:36] spoke to my heart and said on and of
[1:33:39] some have
[1:33:41] compassion and oh praise God I don't
[1:33:44] care what anybody say about me I I don't
[1:33:47] care what ought I would have against a
[1:33:49] minister brother anybody else I forgive
[1:33:52] him amen I don't care what it doesn't
[1:33:54] matter what it is William brandham had
[1:33:58] that Revelation they sent him dung in
[1:34:00] the mail they cursed me did all kind of
[1:34:02] things to him he went and prayed for him
[1:34:05] amen yes sir and the more he humbled
[1:34:08] himself the more he prayed for them I
[1:34:10] don't care if it's doubters and odd
[1:34:13] doctrines and funny Spirits I forgive
[1:34:15] them yes sir makes no difference brother
[1:34:19] that's then you come into real mat
[1:34:21] Authority then you begin to get real
[1:34:23] right you begin to grow up into the
[1:34:25] things of God you begin to be like your
[1:34:28] father going about forgiving doing good
[1:34:31] doing kind no matter what they do to you
[1:34:34] when they revile you you're in the word
[1:34:36] now you're in the sermon on the mountain
[1:34:37] now brother you moving with reality when
[1:34:41] they they revive you you bless them oh
[1:34:45] praise God if God can get a bride like
[1:34:47] that that's back to the word there's the
[1:34:50] real back to the word not legalism and
[1:34:53] chopping down and Grace Grace but
[1:34:55] Walking Down The Highway of Holiness
[1:34:57] brother with hands stretched out to both
[1:35:00] sides the legalist and the grace gracest
[1:35:03] and trying to pull them on up to your
[1:35:05] road don't go down there now just pull
[1:35:07] them up brother and keep moving on down
[1:35:09] the King's Highway that's why I believe
[1:35:12] that yes sir so therefore I I feel
[1:35:15] Brothers excuse me and then W let June
[1:35:18] 9th and while had just finished
[1:35:20] preaching this message here and then all
[1:35:22] of a sudden I turned around the Holy
[1:35:24] Spirit spoke to me and brother Hunt
[1:35:26] sitting right over there I said brother
[1:35:28] Hunt brother Tony he's over here
[1:35:29] somewhere brother Kirk brother dilot

[1:35:34] something swept through our I said
[1:35:35] church God bless you please forgive me
[1:35:38] and the spirit of forgiveness swept down
[1:35:41] through the New York assembly I didn't
[1:35:43] even know what I was even doing it
[1:35:46] wasn't until 4 days later the holy
[1:35:48] spirit said read St Mark 11:24 252 6 if
[1:35:52] you have art forgive brother Hunt rushed
[1:35:55] back he said you didn't do anything to
[1:35:56] me and the other you could do anything
[1:35:57] to me I said I know it but I don't
[1:35:59] understand it then the Holy Spirit begin
[1:36:01] to speak he says this this this happened
[1:36:03] to me now I me I don't know what
[1:36:04] happened to you excuse me but he said
[1:36:07] that there's a lost coin there's
[1:36:09] brotherly kindness it must be shown it
[1:36:12] must be displayed it must be revealed
[1:36:15] I'm fixing to come down and bless my
[1:36:17] people if they can only get the
[1:36:19] Revelation that they are nothing and I

[1:36:38] all the things happening to him is the
[1:36:40] one he can even because remain s the
[1:36:43] things that happened to him and we have
[1:36:44] a few little things to overcome just a
[1:36:47] few little trials and temptations that's
[1:36:50] all we have in all all the glory of God
[1:36:52] is waiting for us there if we can just
[1:36:55] overcome about 8 or n years that's all

[1:44:15] has provided a smitten Rock if you read
[1:44:18] back in numbers there the first exod 17

[1:44:29] there when that rock was smitten at
[1:44:31] Calvary either we didn't have to be
[1:44:33] there but we can accept it tonight yes
[1:44:35] sir but the next time he told him to
[1:44:37] speak to the Rock but notice when he
[1:44:39] spoke to the rock it was when Israel was
[1:44:42] complaining and murmuring and unbelief
[1:44:44] and sin and one the stone Moses is when
[1:44:47] the sin at his greatest height that's
[1:44:51] when God loves to show his
[1:44:54] grace yes sir that's when we have that
[1:44:56] promise we can speak to the Rock Amen
[1:44:59] that's when uhh he says speak to the
[1:45:02] Rock don't Smite it but just speak to
[1:45:04] the Rock obedience is better than
[1:45:07] sacrifice no matter what we think and
[1:45:09] here we have the rock the second time as
[1:45:12] the high priest and that's what he is
[1:45:14] here tonight he's our high priest here
[1:45:16] tonight notice it was the people's sins
[1:45:19] what led to what which led to the
[1:45:21] smiting of the Rock Amen and out of the
[1:45:23] rock comes rivers of Living Water yes
[1:45:26] sir and Israel had Grace and they had a
[1:45:28] smitten rock and a brass serpent a
[1:45:30] prophet of God and a pill of fire they
[1:45:32] had all these things here and we have
[1:45:34] them here in this end time now just to

[1:46:09] fruit
[1:46:10] tonight all we have to do is bring into
[1:46:13] the presence of
[1:46:14] God it'll yield almonds all we have to
[1:46:16] do is speak to the Rock the hour is here
[1:46:19] for us our s to speak to the Rock
[1:46:21] friends it's time for this tonight do

[1:46:34] talking about that clown like a man's
[1:46:36] hand that Malachi forsaw we talk about
[1:46:39] those five manifestations that he saw
[1:46:42] that spoken word of Resurrection to
[1:46:43] squirrels and salvation the power amen
[1:46:46] and the healing praise our God and who
[1:46:48] was that person that did these things
[1:46:51] for you and me it was none other than
[1:46:53] Jehovah of the Old Testament came back
[1:46:55] to Malachi 4 and manifested himself as
[1:46:59] Jesus of the New Testament he come back
[1:47:02] for a Third Exodus he come back to get
[1:47:05] you and I and he gave Malachi for to
[1:47:08] give us everything for the journey we
[1:47:12] are on our way to the resurrection do
[1:47:14] you believe that there yes sir St John
[1:47:17] 8:58 before Abraham was I was but he
[1:47:21] says before Abraham was I am he could
[1:47:23] have said I was but he said I am amen
[1:47:27] present tense friends without any doubt
[1:47:29] he was taking us back to that day when
[1:47:32] Moses bowed before the burning bush we
[1:47:35] got to know who I I am is tonight amen
[1:47:38] asking God in what name he should go
[1:47:40] that that God should give him that was
[1:47:42] sending him and when he was going down
[1:47:44] to Egypt and God says I am that I am
[1:47:47] that's who I am I am who I am and what I
[1:47:50] am and I will be what I will
[1:47:53] be amen that's that's what I am you go
[1:47:57] on down and you tell those Israelites I
[1:47:59] am have sent
[1:48:00] you yes sir and Jesus told those Jews if
[1:48:04] you believe not that I am he shall die
[1:48:06] in your sins yes sir friends therefore
[1:48:09] the meaning of that great name we know
[1:48:10] is Jehovah and all this there and Jesus
[1:48:12] claimed the same name and reveal it to
[1:48:15] Malachi for one day out there squ
[1:48:16] hunting he says I am Jehovah he said

[2:15:12] church so was Luther and Wesley and old

[2:15:32] there into the oyster shell is
[2:15:35] introduced a substance which becomes a
[2:15:38] source of great irritation and
[2:15:40] suffering a small
[2:15:43] stone or some foreign body and once this
[2:15:47] irrit
[2:15:48] is in the Oyster is there for good it's
[2:15:52] a real thorn in the flesh for the oyster
[2:15:56] but the creature has to live with
[2:15:58] him amen yet God has provided the oyster
[2:16:03] with a wonderful way of handling the
[2:16:05] source of
[2:16:07] sufferings the creature is able to
[2:16:10] manufacture a wondrously smooth
[2:16:13] material with which it covers the
[2:16:16] irritation oh my we have something in US
[2:16:20] Sweet Holy Spirit smooth and sweet and
[2:16:23] it covers every
[2:16:25] irritation is that wonderful

[2:16:31] makes the actual
[2:16:32] Pearl as the years go by the oyster

[2:16:38] problem you have the Holy Spirit can
[2:16:40] cover that problem tonight amen with
[2:16:42] more Pearl material so that in God's
[2:16:46] good time
[2:16:48] does this thing which came in originally
[2:16:51] as an irritant or a thorn becomes
[2:16:55] transformed amen so we learn that a
[2:16:58] precious Pearl really is a problem
[2:17:01] covered with the the provision of God
[2:17:04] the word Heroes of f of Faith learned
[2:17:07] this life without the the provision of
[2:17:11] Christ is often just a string of Sorrows
[2:17:15] and tragedies and sufferings
[2:17:18] but praise be to the Living God tonight
[2:17:22] when our problems are covered with what
[2:17:25] he has
[2:17:26] provided the string of problems become a
