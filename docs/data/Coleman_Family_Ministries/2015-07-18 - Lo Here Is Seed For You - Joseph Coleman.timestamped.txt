[3:30] Ezekiel 3 verse
[3:34] 24 then the spirit entered into me and
[3:38] set me upon my feet and spake with me
[3:42] and said unto me go shut thyself in
[3:45] thine house but thou son of man behold
[3:49] they shall put bands upon thee and shall
[3:52] bind thee with them and thou shalt not
[3:54] go out among them and I will make thy
[3:57] tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth
[4:00] that that thou shalt be dumb and shall
[4:03] not be to them a reprover for they are
[4:06] rebellious house but when I speak with
[4:09] thee I will open thy mouth and thou
[4:13] shalt say to them thus saith the Lord
[4:15] God he that heareth let them hear and he
[4:19] that for beareth let him forbear for
[4:23] they are rebellious house Ezekiel 24 you
[4:26] know Ezekiel was called the son of man
[4:29] and he did all kind of signs and things
[4:31] and had to do some terrible things that
[4:34] humanly possible you wouldn't want to do
[4:37] amen and he was all kind of signs and he
[4:40] did those things amen cuz that was H
[4:42] have a signed to the people what they
[4:45] would be going through and so forth and
[4:47] the judgments that were coming upon them
[4:49] and then God put it upon him and the
[4:51] 24th uh chapter here I don't have time
[4:54] to read it all but the 24th verse uh he
[4:56] was to be a sign according to all he had
[4:59] done shall you do and when this cometh
[5:02] you shall know that I am the Lord God
[5:04] when all you see these signs going on
[5:07] when they would see Ezekiel going
[5:09] through all kind of signs amen and then
[5:12] they would know that Jehovah was
[5:14] displeased and then uh at that time I
[5:17] might as well read the 25th verse and
[5:19] also thou son of man shall it not be in
[5:23] the day when I when I take from them
[5:25] their strength the joy of their Glory
[5:28] desire their eyes and that whereupon
