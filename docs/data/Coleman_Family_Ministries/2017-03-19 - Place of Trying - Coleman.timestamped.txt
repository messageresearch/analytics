[2:43] like to take that one amen uh Joshua the
[2:46] 13th
[2:47] chapter just a few
[2:50] comments have a few leftover thoughts
[2:53] from this morning Hall that so many
[2:56] things was going on in here I tell you
[2:58] if you knew the spirits that was here
[3:01] this morning the the the people that
[3:03] came in here with odd strange things on
[3:06] them my it was really something so it
[3:10] kind of took me away from my main
[3:12] thought amen but the Lord knows now
[3:15] Joshua was old and stricken in years and
[3:17] the Lord said unto him Thou Art old and
[3:21] stricken in years and there remain yet
[3:24] very much land to be possessed this is
[3:26] the land that yet remaineth all the
[3:29] borders of the Philistines and all
[3:32] gurai from sior which is before Egypt
[3:35] even unto the borders of the erron
[3:37] northw which is counted to the Canaanite
[3:40] five Lords of the Philistines the the
[3:42] gites and the asites and the uh the
[3:47] escit and the gites and the aconites
[3:50] also the aites all the vites amen we
[3:55] amen we have dominion over all of them
[3:58] praise God amen every fight
[4:02] amen judges the first
[4:06] chapter judges the 1 chapter verse
[4:10] 19 and
[4:12] um verse 19 judges first chapter and the
[4:16] Lord and the Lord was with Judah and he
[4:19] drave out the the inhabitants of the
[4:21] mountain but could not drive out the
[4:24] inhabitants of the valley because they
[4:25] had Chariots of iron verse 21 and the
[4:29] children children of Benjamin did not
[4:30] drive out the jees the the jebusites
[4:34] that inhabited Jerusalem but the
[4:36] jebusites dwell in the dwell with the
[4:38] children of Benjamin in Jerusalem until
[4:39] this day and verse 27 neither did
[4:43] Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of
[4:45] bethen and her towns nor tenoch and her
[4:49] towns nor the inhabitants of door and
[4:51] her towns nor the inhabitants of IIM and
[4:54] her towns nor the inhabitants of megiddo
[4:56] and her towns but the Canaanites would
[4:58] dwell in that land
[5:00] in verse
[5:01] 29 neither did Ephraim drive out the
[5:04] Canaanites that dwelt in gazar but the
[5:07] Canaanites dwelt and gazed among them
[5:10] verse 30 neither did zebon drive out the
[5:13] inhabits of KRON nor the inhabitants
[5:16] ofo but the the Canaanites dwelt among
[5:18] them and became
[5:20] tributaries and verse 31 neither aser
[5:24] drive out the inhabits of AOL nor the
[5:26] inhabits of zidon nor of a Arab and nor
[5:30] of aib nor of halba nor of AIC nor of
[5:35] Rahab in verse 33 neither did napali
[5:39] drive out the inhabitants of Beth shesh
[5:42] and nor the inhabitants of Beth but he
[5:44] dwelt among the Canaanites inhabits of
[5:46] the land nevertheless the inhabits of
[5:48] Beth shth and of Beth anth became the
[5:51] tributaries unto them so we see they
[5:54] didn't drive it
[5:55] out my and they remain yet today
[6:00] oh what it means
[6:03] obedience praise God judges 2 vers 20
[6:08] and the anger of the Lord was hot
[6:10] against Israel and he said because that
[6:12] this people hath transgressed my
[6:14] Covenant which I have commanded their
[6:16] fathers and have not hearkened to my
[6:18] voice I also will not henceforth drive
[6:21] out any from before them of the Nations
[6:25] which Joshua left when he died that
[6:28] through them
[6:30] I may prove Israel whether they will
[6:32] keep the way of the Lord to walk therein
[6:35] as the fathers did Keep It or Not
[6:38] therefore the Lord left those Nations
[6:40] without driving them out hastily neither
[6:43] delivered he them into the hand of
[6:46] Joshua may God the blessing to reading
[6:49] of his word you may be seated well
[6:52] praise the Lord so just a few comments
[6:56] so I like a little thought for the tape
[6:59] play of trying so now we got two places
[7:02] of trying we got we in the
[7:05] message we in adoption time and we're
[7:08] going to have those that's going to have
[7:11] their their inheritance going to come
[7:13] down the Dynamics and they're not going
[7:16] to drive out the Philistines then there
[7:19] going to be some calebs that's going to
[7:21] drive them
[7:24] out so make up your mind which group are
[7:26] you
[7:27] in so I call it place of trying because
[7:31] Caleb will be Tried by the
[7:34] Giants and the church they will be tried
[7:37] also but the one's going to make it and
[7:39] the one is not going to make
[7:42] it so now listen I'm going to speak some
[7:44] things now this other group that won't
[7:48] put them Philistines out and put their
[7:50] churches in order they will be trying
[7:52] for three and A2 years in the
[7:54] tribulation
[7:55] period but there's a bride
[8:01] Hallelujah there's some calebs that has
[8:04] a little short message that will shake
[8:08] the whole
[8:11] nation what is that message you may be
[8:14] seated what is that message that there's
[8:17] actually in the 20th
[8:19] century a few people that God has
[8:23] predestinated
[8:25] [Applause]
[8:30] now either there's going to be a
[8:31] spiritual adoption or there's not going
[8:34] to
[8:35] be now I'm not talking about physical
[8:37] adoption that comes in the resurrection
[8:40] and many pastors don't know nothing
[8:42] split beans from coffee about spiritual
[8:46] [Music]
[8:48] adoption they don't know the message
[8:51] they over in Romans 8 but I'm talking
[8:53] about Ephesians 1: 15 I'm talking about
[8:57] Apostles and Prophets and pastors
[8:58] Evangel teachers I'm talking about
[9:01] coming to the unity of a faith I'm
[9:03] talking about one God one Lord One Faith
[9:07] one baptism praise
[9:12] God I ain't talking about hoping so
[9:15] maybe so I might make it a resurrection
[9:18] listen here I have more faith listen
[9:20] listen to the statement now I have more
[9:23] faith to be adopted like the prophet was
[9:27] and then go in Resurrection rather than
[9:29] being state I'm in now and going in
[9:35] Resurrection why because this is my
[9:39] season this is adoption
[9:42] time just the same as Luther was
[9:45] justified the Wesley was Sanctified the
[9:49] Pentecost received the Holy Ghost praise
[9:51] God you're going to be
[9:56] adopted not in the resurrection before
[9:59] the
[10:01] Resurrection let me say it good before
[10:05] the
[10:06] resurrection before the
[10:15] resurrection God Amen God did not bring
[10:19] us out here for 20 years to let us go
[10:21] through the tribulation
[10:24] period he brought out here you are
[10:28] predestinated to take that glorious
[10:30] stand of perfect man on this Earth

[10:37] resurrection do you have faith yes I
[10:40] have faith seven Thunders gives me that
[10:46] Faith there's no devil of unbelief is

[10:57] Malachi 4 to be the first
[10:59] son adopted son and it shall be

[18:39] exactly the father's business so the
[18:41] secret of the message in 1965 not 74 way
[18:46] back before that the secret of the
[18:48] message was to be about your father's
[18:50] business and not listen to the church or
[18:52] the
[18:56] rabbis what is a father's business could
[18:59] you think of what the father's business
[19:00] was to him to fulfill what Isaiah said a
[19:03] virgin shall conceive the Lord your God
[19:06] shall raise up a prophet like unto me
[19:08] see it was the father's business to
[19:10] fulfill that word well if that come down
[19:14] through them stalks of Natural Women
[19:16] Hagar and so forth and Sarah and Mary
[19:21] what about these stalks of these
[19:22] Spiritual Church women churches Luther
[19:25] Westley
[19:26] Pentecost amen means women women means
[19:29] churches is that right then what is it
[19:31] now we must be about the father's
[19:34] business the wheat the wheat not the Shu
[19:37] the wheat would cry back the grain yes
[19:40] sir what must it do vindicate Malachi 4
[19:44] vindicate St Luke 17:30 vindicate Hebrew
[19:46] 138 St John 14:12 vindicate all his word
[19:51] you mean to tell me that myself and you
[19:54] we are to vindicate the prophet
[20:01] is that why he took the prophet and left
[20:04] the
[20:07] pride and amen the because Isaiah said
[20:11] when the enemy come in with a flood of
[20:14] unbelief false anointed ones I'll take
[20:17] the prophet but the seed will get in the
[20:22] people and then they will be about their
[20:24] father's business vindicating Malachi 4
[20:27] in Europe South Africa New Zealand India
[20:31] South America vindicating the
[20:33] [Applause]
[20:36] message Hallelujah a bride and God could
[20:41] turn his back and turn and sit down his
[20:43] rocking chair in 1965 when he took the
[20:46] prophet God sat down his rocking
[20:49] chair because he knew he had some
[20:52] predestinated seeds of
[20:55] God that would not fail
[21:00] that would
[21:01] overcome Hallelujah no matter what the
[21:04] test was they would stand there anyway
[21:08] can a devil move
[21:13] them praise God
[21:16] hallelujah so every time you say the
[21:19] seven Thunders gives Faith you are
[21:21] vindicating Malachi 4 no doubt if
[21:24] Malachi 4 could hear you I can see him
[21:26] raised up Hall alah Glory come on come
[21:31] on come
[21:35] on praise God you may be
[21:39] seated vindicate all of his word I mean
[21:42] Revelation the 10th chapter the opening
[21:43] of The Seven Seals vindicate the opening
[21:46] of the seventh seal vindicate Revelation
[21:48] 81 that the seventh seal open say it
[21:51] back it did
[21:53] [Applause]
[21:55] happen that's what it means I to say I
[21:58] don't know now what quote was that was
[22:01] this before the third pull was this the
[22:03] second pull or the first pull some
[22:05] brothers said well now the second pull
[22:07] was not the voice of God in
[22:13] Doctrine
[22:14] ignorant stupid not even knowing that
[22:19] the second pull was the restoration of
[22:22] the former
[22:24] [Applause]
[22:26] rign brother Brandon Resto storing back
[22:29] Paul's
[22:30] doctrines in the second
[22:33] pull then God come down open Seven Seals
[22:36] to vindicate the second
[22:39] pull that indeed this man knew what he
[22:42] was talking
[22:43] [Applause]
[22:45] about then the lad rain swept over and
[22:48] the lad and the former rain together
[22:50] they don't want no former rain women
[22:53] preachers and stuff like that they don't
[22:54] want that so they say his Doctrine is
[22:57] wrong
[22:59] is not
[23:01] wrong
[23:02] Glory the mysteries of God even to
[23:04] serpent seed and all will be manifested
[23:07] marriage and divorce and all the other
[23:08] Mysteries has been hid under the pillars
[23:11] from all these years from the
[23:13] theologians and hid from their
[23:18] eyes amen but now is the
[23:21] hour that's the father's business think
[23:25] they would receive it they want to be
[23:26] dignified all the n Nation don't teach
[23:29] us that we don't know about no seven
[23:32] Thunders
[23:33] dignified my but the Bible does that's
[23:36] right God vindicates it to be the
[23:39] truth fulfilling this age when the Seven
[23:42] Seals are just proven denomination have
[23:44] been
[23:45] carriers excuse me that's another one of
[23:48] the father's business to prove and the
[23:51] father's business now is to show you
[23:53] them denominations is not his their
[23:57] man-made system that the word so the
[23:59] father's business is to take the seventh
[24:01] Thunder Revelation and show everybody
[24:03] else is not his if they don't believe
[24:07] it oh praise God my my time for you to
[24:14] take out your
[24:15] [Applause]
[24:18] sword sister Louisa Mayo had a dream
[24:20] Friday February the 4th it was it was as
[24:24] if I was with some saints from the
[24:26] church yet I was standing alone it
[24:28] seemed that we were in some sort of a
[24:30] war as the enemy came toward me I looked
[24:32] at him and knew that in me was the power
[24:35] to destroy him exactly what I told you
[24:37] this
[24:38] morning as I looked at him I saw a
[24:41] lightning bolt in front of me then a
[24:43] ball of fire formed in a big ball of
[24:45] fire then there was fighting with a
[24:48] sword the fighting went on until the
[24:50] person with the sword was led to stick
[24:52] it in when it was my turn to take the
[24:54] sword I was afraid because I had never
[24:57] handled a sword before for and the
[24:59] promis is wait till them seven Thunders
[25:01] uttered his voices to that group not Joe
[25:06] Coman to the group that can hand it
[25:11] there that can take the spoken word and
[25:14] say Silver and Gold Have I
[25:17] [Applause]
[25:20] None but such as I have I give unto
[25:24] you oh Hallelujah I was afraid because I
[25:28] never handle a sword before then it
[25:30] seemed as if there was someone teaching
[25:32] me how to use it I wonder if Michael is
[25:39] here I wonder if that's what's going on
[25:43] child training
[25:46] tutoring and to your faith teach you how
[25:49] to hand that
