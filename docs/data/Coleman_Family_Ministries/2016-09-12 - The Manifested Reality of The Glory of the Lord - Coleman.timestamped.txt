[29:32] and physical adoption and on into the
[29:34] Rapture with our Lord Jesus Christ you
[29:37] believe that and judgment is roaring
[29:39] across the Earth and now when they see
[29:42] the things predicted happen saying thus
[29:44] saith the Lord happens then they say
[29:46] give us some of your oil is that the
[29:47] hour the prophet spoke about was it's
[29:49] here we're actually living in that
[29:52] hour there got to be oil on the earth on
[29:55] the earth somewhere
[29:59] for somebody to say give me some oil
[30:01] they don't see how can they ask for
[30:03] it you're too blind to the promises of
[30:06] Malachi 4 anyway so therefore they got
[30:08] to see something happen oh Hallelujah
[30:14] see it
[30:15] manifested somewhere amen okay uh so now
[30:22] Malachi 4 said uh about the world system
[30:26] and USA and prophecy and so forth and we
[30:29] know the sign that he gave us and um on
[30:33] God's uh Covenant with Abraham
[30:36] 56-
[30:38] 0428 um I didn't mean that to do any
[30:41] harm women now see uh the women is the
[30:44] sign of the end time for this
[30:47] nation okay you know that now so this I
[30:51] don't just hundreds of quotes but I just
[30:53] want to pick out a few I feel that it
[30:55] will will hit the the the the time
[30:58] in a season and nail it
[31:00] down before I can preach amen you got to
[31:03] know what I'm talking about I don't mean
[31:05] you Christian women see not talking to
[31:07] you now see uh but just to see a woman
[31:10] coming into politics and everything it's
[31:12] a disgrace huh are you reading the
[31:15] papers amen it's a Breaking of the
[31:18] American morale and remember this is
[31:21] America well a woman I better leave it
[31:23] alone but just remember this I predict
[31:27] this
[31:28] that a woman will be president before we
[31:32] are
[31:33] annihilated that's right I said that in
[31:36] 1933 by a
[31:39] vision where are we at
[31:43] church we better wake up I tell you
[31:46] that and then uh on the seven uh Church
[31:51] ages uh Exposition chapter n Ley and
[31:54] church age uh then just to speak about
[31:58] the sixth Vision then from 1933 then in
[32:02] the sixth Vision they rose up in America
[32:03] most powerful but cruel woman she held
[32:06] the people in her complete power I
[32:09] believe that this was the rise of the
[32:11] Roman Catholic church now watch though I
[32:15] knew it could possibly be a vision of
[32:18] some woman rising in great power in
[32:22] America due to a popular vote by
[32:26] women so
[32:28] my my we are somewhere huh so then now
[32:34] what's predicted by Malachi 4 to happen
[32:36] to the women in our day and on teaching
[32:39] on Moses
[32:41] 1956 uh I predicted that women would
[32:43] keep
[32:44] demoralizing and the nation would keep
[32:47] falling and they they'd keep hanging to
[32:50] mother or like mother like or mother a
[32:54] like mother like that till they become a
[32:56] woman become
[32:58] Idol and after a while that America
[33:01] would be ruled by a woman mark it and
[33:05] see if it's not right a woman will take
[33:08] the place of a president or something of
[33:11] great some high power in
[33:15] America where are we at who is the
[33:20] co-president praise God that everybody
[33:23] knows huh praise God we know who it is
[33:27] amen
[33:31] okay uh the mark of the beast
[33:34] 1956 America has refused Christ as their
[33:37] God and received women as their god what
[33:40] have they done they stripped their
[33:42] clothes while it's a disgrace for a
[33:44] decent person to walk down the streets
[33:46] of any City what does that show that
[33:49] shows just exactly what's in a woman's
[33:51] heart Jesus said by their fruits you
[33:53] shall know them they have disgraced
[33:56] Womanhood why because that a woman has
[34:00] become a
[34:01] goddess like Eve was in the Garden of
[34:03] Eden Adam turned his back on God and
[34:06] went with Eve and America and the rest
[34:09] of the world has turned their back on
[34:11] God and went with the woman that's
[34:13] scorching but that's true look around he
[34:16] says just look
[34:18] around see the naked in the street and
[34:21] everything else and the men worshiping
[34:22] the woman the female body you see it
[34:26] amen so we thank God we out of
[34:29] it amen Praise by a message from a
[34:32] prophet amen that's why these
[34:35] Pentecostal churches and different ones
[34:37] they don't know how to get out of it so
[34:39] they have all kind of strange uh
[34:40] teachings on sex and everything else the
[34:42] handwriting on the wall I think the
[34:45] whole nation of America has become a
[34:47] modern
[34:48] urinal you hear what I saying America
[34:51] has become a modern urinal in the sight
[34:54] of almighty God when a divorce and rape
[34:57] and crime and stop it if you can you
[34:59] can't stop it God said it would be so
[35:02] and she's right for judgment now here's
[35:04] what we do purpose in your heart that
[35:07] you will not defile yourself from the
[35:09] things of the
[35:10] world it's up to you but you want to do
[35:14] praise God you want to be part of this
[35:16] world well brother I don't know in the

[1:56:42] to see why that the people are so elated
[1:56:46] and so infused and these conventions are
[1:56:49] such an
[1:56:51] oddball uh a strange thing to other

[1:57:49] that in these last days there would be a
[1:57:50] latter rain poured out upon the people
[1:57:53] in the last days I think the Greek word
[1:57:56] here that is kenos which means that he
[1:57:58] emptied himself out not in the way we
[1:58:00] would say like something was inside of
[1:58:02] somebody that had emptied out but he
[1:58:04] poured himself out he changed in morphi
[1:58:07] he changed from what he was Amen to what
[1:58:10] he is he never changes his nature he's
[1:58:13] the same yesterday today and
[1:58:16] forever but on the day of Pentecost
[1:58:18] remember he was son of man and on the
[1:58:21] day of pent because he changed himself
[1:58:23] from being the son of man to the Son of
[1:58:25] God he came not with the people he came
[1:58:28] in the people the shakina came in the
[1:58:32] temple Hallelujah and then when it comes
