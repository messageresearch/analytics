[0:00] I'm reading from St. John 4 the 4th
[0:03] chapter verse
[0:05] 31-38 in 2 Kings 19th chapter
[0:10] uh 29th
[0:13] verse St. John the 4th chapter verse
[0:17] 31. In the meanwhile, while his
[0:20] disciples prayed him, saying, "Master,
[0:23] eat." But he said unto them, "I have
[0:26] meat to eat that ye know not
[0:29] [Music]
[0:30] of." Therefore said the disciples one to
[0:34] another, "Hath any man uh brought him
[0:36] ought to eat?" Jesus saith unto them, my
[0:39] need is to do the will of him that sent
[0:41] me and to finish his work. Say not ye,
[0:45] uh, they are yet four months, and then
[0:48] cometh harvest. Behold, I say unto you,
[0:50] lift up your eyes, and look on the
[0:53] fields, for they are white already to
[0:56] harvest. And he that reapeth receiveth
[0:59] wages, and gatherth fruit unto life
[1:02] eternal, that both he that sweth, and he
[1:05] that reapeth may rejoice together. And
[1:08] herein is that saying true, one sweth,
[1:11] another reapeth. I sent you to reap that
[1:14] whereon ye bestowed no labor. Other men
[1:17] labored, and ye are entered into their
[1:20] labors. And uh 2 Kings the 19th chapter
[1:24] verse 29.
[1:26] And this shall be a sign unto thee. Ye
[1:28] shall eat this year such thing as grow
[1:31] of themselves. And into the and in the
[1:34] second year that which springeth of the
[1:36] same and in the third year sow ye and
[1:39] reap and plant vineyards and eat the
[1:41] fruits thereof. May the Lord add a
[1:43] blessing to the reading of his word. Let
[1:45] us have a word of prayer. Father, we can
[1:47] only read the holy rip, the scriptures.
[1:50] But Father, uh uh you must come upon
[1:52] them and breathe upon them and and bring
[1:55] life and spirit out of the scriptures,
[1:57] Father. For the flesh profited nothing,
[1:59] but the spirit quickenth. Now, Father,
[2:01] may you quicken the word of the Lord to
[2:04] the predestinated seeds of God that have
[2:06] gathered here this morning. and may uh
[2:08] uh their hearts uh receive a basket full
[2:11] of goodies this morning. And they'll
[2:13] they'll be able to go forth from the
[2:15] gates uh uh uh praising you, thanking
[2:18] you, and saying, "Then our hearts burn
[2:19] within us as you speak to us by the
[2:21] wayside." Father, breathe upon the word
[2:24] now and give it life. We pray and we ask
[2:26] that in Jesus name we say, "Amen." You
[2:28] may be
[2:30] seated. I'd like to take a a thought out
[2:33] of here, a a secret meat. But Jesus said
[2:37] that I have meat that you know nothing
[2:38] of. And so I like to call that meat the
[2:41] the secret meat. Amen. Now um before I
[2:46] bring in a few thoughts on the word of
[2:47] the Lord this morning, you don't mind if
[2:50] I take off my jacket. Amen. I don't
[2:53] believe that the Lord's looking at my
[2:54] jacket. Look at my heart this morning.
[2:56] Amen. So we thank the Lord for that.
[2:59] Now, um, so I'd like to give a little
[3:01] testimony, uh, concerning Trinidad and
[3:04] and Venezuela. And as you know, I told
[3:07] you some time back, I believe it was
[3:08] February or somewhere around here, uh,
[3:11] January, February, that was February,
[3:14] that the Lord uh, I was seeking the Lord
[3:16] uh, about where I would go. I have so
[3:19] many invitations to go all over the this
[3:21] country and around and I didn't I want
[3:24] to be in God's will. And I realized that
[3:26] it wasn't in the thus saith the Lord
[3:29] season. And then some people, you know,
[3:31] they said, "Well, what are you going out
[3:33] for?" Cuz you you said that when you go
[3:34] out, you have thus sayeth the Lord.
[3:36] Well, see, they don't understand. See, I
[3:38] I have to do the will of God, the one
[3:40] that sent me. See, and finish his work.
[3:43] And so many people, they don't they
[3:45] haven't even understood what's been
[3:46] going on here for 8 years. Much less
[3:49] could they understand that, you see? So
[3:51] see the whole thing I even spoke to you
[3:53] that it's a CIA work. Remember see I'm
[3:56] doing a secret work. You see I said it I
[3:59] hope I thought that they would catch it
[4:00] you know. So and I'm still doing that.
[4:03] Amen. See it's secret meet secret work.
[4:05] You see and God is down on the earth
[4:08] now. And the world don't even know it.
[4:10] He's doing secret work. We're doing
[4:12] secret work. We secret angels in this
[4:13] world. We're from another world, another
[4:16] kingdom. Amen. just finding out the
[4:18] thing here for the lost elected ones. So
[4:22] I'm I'm on a mission.
[4:24] And when I go down to Puerto Rico and
[4:26] Trinidad, I'm on a mission. Amen.
[4:28] Looking for the elected one that'll
[4:30] that'll come to that perfect sacrifice.
[4:33] No add mixture, nothing added, nothing
[4:35] taken away the way she presented as
[4:38] Malachi 4 said it. Amen. That's the
[4:41] mission I was on. I told him I told the
[4:43] whole church. So therefore, I never said
[4:45] I had thus sayeth the Lord. But I did
[4:48] explain to you what happened in Tucson
[4:50] when the Holy Spirit revealed to me what
[4:52] I was doing out there. He said, "You are
[4:54] sewing the seed for the dynamics." And
[4:57] that's I came to the whole church. I'm
[4:59] sewing for the dynamics. Amen.
[5:02] So, cuz the revelation, the end time
[5:05] late seeds that's laid in the spoken
[5:07] word tapes, they have got to be sold
[5:10] just before the resurrection to bring up
[5:13] that ministry of Jesus Christ upon the
[5:15] earth. That'll raise the dead. When the
[5:18] power of the Forest Hill Church rises,
[5:20] it'll bring the brethren. And the power
[5:23] of the other churches around the world
[5:25] rise, it'll bring the brethren. Well,
[5:27] how you going to get the power? The
[5:28] people not looking for the power. So you
[5:30] got to sew the seed for that power of
[5:33] the resurrection. Some is looking for
[5:35] watermelons and some looking for a great
[5:37] man and a pope and a great church. But
[5:39] who's looking for the dynamics of God,
[5:42] the charity, divine love, the ministry
[5:45] of Jesus Christ? The works that I do
[5:48] shall you do also. That's what I'm
[5:49] looking for. And I got to sew it down
[5:51] the right way. See? And you can cuz you
[5:53] can't have the the mechanics without the
[5:56] dynamic. Got to be together. See? And
[5:58] that's what it was all about. And so
[6:01] realizing that uh in prayer, the Holy
[6:03] Spirit spoke to my heart uh thinking
[6:05] about Georgia and Ohio and Indiana,
[6:08] different places. And the Holy Spirit
[6:09] spoke three words. It says Puerto Rico,
[6:12] Trinidad, Venezuela over and over. So as
[6:15] you know, I went down to Puerto Rico and
[6:17] the Lord did bless and then I went to
[6:20] Trinidad and Venezuela. So I cannot say
[6:23] myself what happened there, but uh it'd
[6:26] be hard for me. You understand? How can
[6:28] I stand up and talk about what I was
[6:30] doing? It was the Lord. See, so it'd be
[6:32] kind of hard for me to do that, you
[6:34] know. But uh but the Lord interceded and
[6:38] soft was God. And uh a a friend to
[6:41] Sister Leone from Trinidad wrote her a
[6:45] letter already. And I feel a four-page
[6:47] letter is a testimony of what actually
[6:50] happened down there in Trinidad. So,
[6:52] Brother Hunt, he's going to read it to
[6:53] you. Brother Hunt. Amen. Say amen.
[6:58] That's the testimony from Trinidad and
[7:01] truly it uh really was a a real blessing
[7:05] being there and seeing the brothers and
[7:08] realizing that uh in Trinidad, many
[7:10] other places, many uh uh people from
[7:13] America go down with their
[7:15] interpretations and God knowing that
[7:18] there would be a little confusion. I I
[7:21] just come down to try to help and
[7:23] straighten it out. Amen. And so as
[7:25] always, people sometimes they don't uh
[7:28] really zero in on the word and give
[7:31] respect to the man of God until he's
[7:32] finished speaking. You see, and so as
[7:36] the brother testified of he came in with
[7:39] a critical spirit and he got nothing.
[7:42] And that's how many years they tell you,
[7:44] you come, you know, all shook up about
[7:46] what happened last night and this
[7:48] morning, you can't get nothing. You
[7:49] know, that's what that's the spirit
[7:51] you're in. You see? And so it was a real
[7:53] blessing being there. And what it was uh
[7:56] uh the brothers there seemed to be the
[7:59] latine doctrine and church order seemed
[8:02] to be uh the prevalent thing down there.
[8:04] I didn't know what it was until I got
[8:06] there because I wouldn't go to brother
[8:08] Ojars for that purpose so that they
[8:10] wouldn't think I was with him. So I just
[8:12] went and stayed by myself. See and then
[8:15] I and he didn't tell me anything. And
[8:16] this the Lord I'm glad he did. The Lord
[8:18] just showed me. See, and I had to speak
[8:20] on the letter rain all about three
[8:21] nights running. And then Friday night, I
[8:24] felt it was kind of rough at first cuz
[8:27] uh they was standing down on level
[8:29] ground in the schoolhouse and there was
[8:31] no microphone and I had to a scream out
[8:34] over top of the people's heads and
[8:36] whatnot and that was kind of rough. And
[8:38] the next night they had a microphone and
[8:40] you had to hold it in one hand. See? And
[8:42] so, but then finally the third night
[8:44] they had it all set up and I just felt I
[8:46] said, "Well, I feel tonight that God's
[8:48] going to break this thing open in here
[8:50] tonight." Amen. And so he sure did. And
[8:53] the Holy Spirit fell upon the people and
[8:55] you should have been wonderful to seeing
[8:57] them reaching over two and three rows uh
[8:59] crying and weeping and grabbing one
[9:02] another and making amends for the
[9:03] different things. I didn't know what was
[9:05] in those people's hearts. And then uh
[9:08] Thursday mo Friday morning the three
[9:11] ministers that was mentioned Walter and
[9:13] Shanei and Sanki and Sham they come to
[9:16] see me and one of the brothers said uh
[9:19] what do you think about this here? I
[9:20] said about what you know they want me to
[9:23] explain something there. I said well
[9:24] brother one time when God walked the
[9:26] earth in the days of his flesh some
[9:28] Pharisees came up to question
[9:31] him. Do you have a question for me? Ask
[9:34] it. I'll answer it if I can. And that
[9:36] just set everything up just nice to you
[9:39] know when you have a question we'll ask
[9:41] the man the question that's all. See
[9:42] they come to trap Jesus the word. See
[9:45] and so just be open and God bless you.
[9:48] Amen. Don't come you know like this. You
[9:50] know what I mean? Just come straight say
[9:51] brother Cole brother H so and so and so
[9:54] this happened. Say it. You know what I
[9:56] mean? Don't try to you know the Holy
[9:57] Spirit pick you right out. See. Amen. So
[10:00] that was wonderful. And we had a
[10:02] wonderful
[10:03] conversation and the Lord showed me what
[10:05] it was. Uh these brothers was believing
[10:08] that the latter rain is coming over here
[10:10] and it's going to shape the world. Cuz I
[10:12] know the brother who taught that down
[10:14] there and we all know him from here in
[10:16] this area. He brought that doctrine down
[10:18] there and nobody got the Holy Ghost
[10:20] saying this is going to happen over
[10:21] here. The latter rain outpouring over
[10:23] here. See? And then brother Ojar and I
[10:25] call them the Orthodox group. They are
[10:28] saying that the latter rain has come and
[10:29] it has come. was gone and we're right in
[10:32] the sun. So then this group is fussing
[10:34] at this other group here because they
[10:37] ain't looking for this, you see. But
[10:38] meanwhile, brother Oj's looking for a
[10:41] manifestation of God at the end of at
[10:44] the end here, but he never called it
[10:46] anything. You see? So then I just said,
[10:48] "Well, I see where I saw where it was
[10:49] at." So I came right down the middle.
[10:52] Amen. See, so I said, "Well, this group
[10:54] here know that the Latin has come, but
[10:56] they're not sure about what this is. And
[10:58] this group over here is looking for the
[10:59] latter rain over here and saying here
[11:02] the latter rain hasn't come here yet. So
[11:04] both is wrong. So I just come down the
[11:06] middle cuz the latter and the former
[11:08] rain has come. And what shook them up
[11:10] was the Wednesday night when I uh uh
[11:13] presented the wave sheet and prove that
[11:16] the former rain was formed from 33 to
[11:19] 63. That threw everybody off. They never
[11:21] heard that one before at all. thing.
[11:23] Then I prove that the former rain was
[11:26] added, added, added, added in Malachi 4.
[11:29] For 30 years, the seed of God had grown
[11:33] from a little seed in June 1933 on the
[11:36] banks of the Ohio River. And when the
[11:39] telephone rang, William Brown picked the
[11:41] telephone up and nobody else, they heard
[11:43] the ring, but they didn't hear the
[11:44] words. Malachi 4 heard the words. Amen.
[11:48] And then his faith in the words that he
[11:51] heard to him watered the seed in his
[11:54] heart. And so it is the day with the
[11:57] bride. The telephone rang around the
[11:59] world. Church woke up. Go out and meet
[12:01] the bridegroom. But the bride picked the
[12:03] telephone up.
[12:06] And she heard beautiful words from God.
[12:10] Child of mine, I called you. I have
[12:12] redeemed you from the foundation of the
[12:13] world. I sprinkle the blood of Jesus
[12:15] Christ over you. And here we are sitting
[12:17] here today. So our faith in the words
[12:20] that we heard has warned the seed of God
[12:23] in us. Now we're about 9 months pregnant
[12:26] ready to bring forth a spiritual
[12:28] manifestation of Jesus Christ. That's
[12:30] all it is. Very simple. So I explained
[12:33] that Wednesday night and they they were
[12:35] shook up. And then I said the former and
[12:37] the latter come over through 63 through
[12:41] 65. So brother old joy indeed was right
[12:43] cuz the latter rain did come. And over
[12:46] here they I said, "Brothers, you better
[12:47] put the ladder rain over here." I said,
[12:49] "What you looking for over here is the
[12:51] reaping, but you better sew it over
[12:54] here. You never get it over there." So
[12:56] other way, brother Graham said on the
[12:57] rising of the sun, he says, "If you
[12:59] don't have the mechanics here, you sure
[13:02] your dynamics there, it's not going to
[13:03] mean nothing." That's right. The Holy
[13:05] Spirit will fall. But if you if you
[13:07] didn't receive every word in the latter
[13:09] rain here sold in your heart here, don't
[13:11] look for anything over there. You see?
[13:14] So I just sort of brought him back to
[13:15] the middle, you know, and so therefore
[13:17] everybody was happy. Amen. But uh be as
[13:21] it may was wonderful to sit down with
[13:23] the brothers and meet with them and see
[13:25] all the things that happened. People
[13:27] came up to my to my wife and I and said
[13:29] they hadn't been sleeping and uh all
[13:32] kind of things were going on. And so I
[13:34] find that um what it is with people
[13:37] around the world uh they don't have a
[13:40] real revelation of the uh the the
[13:44] holiness of God. And many different
[13:47] brothers came to me and said I say
[13:49] what's on my mind. I said wow brother I
[13:53] don't want to say what's on my mind. I
[13:54] said Lord God take my thoughts away from
[13:56] me. So I find they get in trouble like
[13:59] that you know and they don't know it.
[14:01] They think that's being honest and out.
[14:02] No, that's being foolish. You see? And
[14:05] so they if they get a little idea about
[14:07] something all people all around all over
[14:09] America, everywhere now, not just uh I'm
[14:11] not speaking about one place now, but
[14:14] I'm saying that uh soon as they get
[14:15] something, they come right to the
[14:17] person. They blast the person. You see,
[14:19] without I mean uh you know, angels uh
[14:22] fear the tread. You know, some people
[14:24] walk with hobnail shoes on. You know
[14:25] what I mean? Angels fear the tread. Even
[14:28] the the angels himself wouldn't even
[14:30] curse Satan. Said the Lord God rebuke
[14:32] you, Satan. You see, so if we would be
[14:35] more conscious of the fear of God, then
[14:38] we'll find we won't be in so many binds,
[14:40] you know. And I see so many people say
[14:42] that um well uh uh I know this is right,
[14:46] you see, but until God convicts me, I'm
[14:49] not going to do it. Well, they don't
[14:51] understand. God saw the attitude in
[14:53] their heart. He'll never convict them.
[14:56] He'll let them sit right in the church
[14:57] and they go right on and and and feeling
[15:00] the Holy Spirit being in the church.
[15:01] They go, but they'll left God. They're
[15:03] not going to convict them. But I find
[15:06] that attitude all around. When he
[15:07] convicts me, they now they know it's in
[15:09] the word. Satan, but they won't come to
[15:11] it. They're waiting for the Holy Spirit
[15:13] to do a private work for them. And he's
[15:15] doing the work through the word.
[15:18] They missed it. He's on the earth now in
[15:21] the word doing this work. And they're
[15:23] waiting for some kind of a manifestation
[15:24] on the outside to do the same work he's
[15:26] doing in the form of the word. See, so
[15:30] praise God. So then brother Ojar he
[15:32] certainly was wonderful. He said how
[15:34] brother Coleman said the aisle just set
[15:36] on fire and brother Furlong his
[15:38] brother-in-law it was his college there.
[15:40] They were just so happy. And brother
[15:42] Furlong he followed me over to Venezuela
[15:45] and we had some more fellowship. He
[15:47] wanted some more. Amen. So I said,
[15:49] "Well, okay, brother." And he came over
[15:50] there the following Friday and then but
[15:52] he he brought over a report that some of
[15:55] the brothers come right back to brother
[15:56] Ojar fighting again you know and so he
[15:59] prayed for brother Ojar and the brothers
[16:01] down there that uh they would just wait
[16:03] see and don't be with accusations and so
[16:06] it it sort of grieved me to hear that
[16:09] after the outpouring of the love and the
[16:12] unity of God and all the ministers met
[16:14] me at the airport and they gave me a
[16:16] gift on behalf of all the miners at the
[16:18] airport See, and so that really made my
[16:21] heart glad that I know what God told me
[16:23] in January in Tucson, January 12th, the
[16:26] unity of the faith. So, I know what I'm
[16:28] doing. And so, therefore, when I saw the
[16:32] the counter attack going this way, then
[16:35] I said, "Well, I don't know what's
[16:36] happening here, so I'll explain it to
[16:38] you this morning, but it's in the word
[16:39] of the Lord." So then when I saw the
[16:42] reaction from Puerto Rico coming
[16:44] straight down the line with the wave
[16:45] sheet and then all the things that I'm
[16:47] hearing now, I said, "Well, what is
[16:49] going on?" But it's in the word, say,
[16:51] "Amen." So we're here now. So therefore,
[16:54] it was certainly wonderful being there
[16:55] in Trinidad and I told the brothers if I
[16:58] like to get a chance to come back down
[16:59] and maybe visit down into Guyana also.
[17:02] Now um so therefore we also had a
[17:06] ministers conference on a Saturday and
[17:08] all the the wives came with the
[17:10] ministers and uh it was a wonderful
[17:13] meeting. I was caught there. I didn't
[17:15] understand. They says relax. So I came
[17:18] with a sports shirt on and slacks and
[17:20] they had on white shirt and ties and
[17:22] suits. So it's kind of odd to have
[17:24] anything with me but the Lord blessed
[17:26] anyway. And so we thank God. And so now,
[17:29] um, I want to say this morning, but when
[17:32] we I saw the brothers walk up to me that
[17:35] morning and repenting and I was upstairs
[17:37] eating and a little waiter up there and
[17:40] he says, "Uh, uh, Reverend Coleman, the
[17:42] saints is downstairs." I said, "The
[17:45] saints, you wow, some saints is
[17:48] downstairs." And I saw the brothers
[17:50] standing there about eight of them there
[17:52] and he says, "Brother Coleman, we have
[17:54] judged you wrong and we've come to
[17:57] repent." I said, "Wow, I never seen that
[17:59] before." You know, so then each one said
[18:01] what he had in his heart and they all
[18:04] got it out and then we just the Holy
[18:06] Spirit come down and people all over was
[18:08] watching the whole thing. We stood right
[18:10] in one spot. See? And so then was able
[18:12] to help some other people that was um
[18:15] kind of mixed up, you know, and that
[18:18] Sunday morning, the Lord blessed and
[18:20] just laid out some things down there.
[18:23] And so, Brother Ojo, I said, "I got me
[18:26] licks, too, man." Amen. So, everybody
[18:28] got the licks and all got lick me down
[18:30] as they say down there, you know. So,
[18:32] they all got some licks, not from me,
[18:34] from the word. Amen. See, so, but that
[18:36] was the attitude. They were happy to to
[18:38] get their licks, you know. Amen. So,
[18:40] brother Oj, he just said it, we getting
[18:42] our licks. Amen. So, say praise God for
[18:44] praise God for the licks. Amen. Amen.
[18:46] See, so in other words, God only uh
[18:49] otherwise as we say in the south, uh uh
[18:51] he doesn't uh peck nobody else's
[18:54] bitties, you know, pecks his own
[18:56] bitties, you know, so that God take care
[18:58] of his own children. He just lets down
[19:00] the whip a little bit and when they get
[19:01] out of line. Amen. So that's all it is.
[19:04] See that we might understand. Now we we
[19:06] went on over to uh
[19:08] Venezuela and wow went on the
[19:11] battlefield and brother uh brother Galon
[19:14] had met me and I had felt led to call on
[19:16] April the 30th before I left. He said
[19:19] brother Coleman he says we had an
[19:20] explosion down here. I said what? I
[19:22] waited 8 years to come to Venezuela.
[19:25] Every brother hunt told me how they
[19:26] sing. How the all the ministers told me
[19:28] in America here, oh, go down there. Go
[19:30] down there. They sing in the people.
[19:33] That's one little word they scream and
[19:34] shout. The church seat over a thousand
[19:36] people in there, you know. I said,
[19:38] "Well, I can't wait to get down there."
[19:40] I go down there. Why? It was a battle.
[19:44] Amen. That's a lot to go into the battle
[19:46] zone, you know. And so he told me that
[19:49] there was all torn up. Some strange
[19:51] doctrine had come from Puerto Rico and
[19:54] William Marian Brown and they are
[19:56] praying his name and Marian is supposed
[19:59] to be the name in the thunders and all
[20:02] kind of stuff. See? So I said, "How this
[20:05] get started then?" And and I was
[20:07] supposed to be coming down to bust up
[20:08] brother God's denomination. I'm the
[20:11] great bishop from America, New York,
[20:13] coming down to break this thing up down
[20:15] here. I said, "Are you kidding me or
[20:16] what?" I said, "I better stay home." He
[20:19] said, "So, I said,"Well, will those
[20:20] ministers be there?" Cuz they had the
[20:22] pastor's conference every first Tuesday
[20:24] in each month. He said, "They definitely
[20:27] will be there cuz they're waiting for
[20:28] you to vindicate them." They said that
[20:30] you're on their side and you going to
[20:32] straighten me out and the rest of us. I
[20:34] said, "I'm going to do that to them."
[20:36] Wow. So I had spoke to brother George
[20:39] Smith here Rebecca's husband and told
[20:41] him he couldn't believe because nobody
[20:43] could believe that was the last place
[20:44] where they had a oneness a unity all
[20:47] these years everywhere else and the
[20:49] message is torn up you know that with
[20:51] all strange ideas and whatnot but they
[20:53] held it there so I knew why cuz only one
[20:55] man spoke English that's why that was
[20:57] Galon and so the others didn't
[20:59] understand English I said brother if you
[21:01] had about four brothers speaking English
[21:02] down here it would have been ripped
[21:03] apart a long time ago cuz each man got
[21:05] his own his own idea
[21:07] But you kept it because you had your
[21:08] idea, you see. But now they've been fed
[21:12] from the mouth of their mother and they
[21:14] want to they feel strong. They want to
[21:16] go on their own, you know. So you can't
[21:18] hold that back. That's just nature, you
[21:19] know. Have to let them go. So I try to
[21:23] explain that. But you know in your own
[21:25] each person they don't, you know, that
[21:27] hurts them, you know, it hurt, you know.
[21:29] So you have that also the hurt feelings
[21:32] you know of this beautiful fellowship
[21:34] and the the glass is broken a beautiful
[21:37] vase and trying to put it back together
[21:38] you can't it's broke have another one
[21:42] amen see so then um I was the bishop
[21:45] coming down to straight down brother
[21:47] Galon and Venezuela one faction said I
[21:50] was going to confirm them and the other
[21:53] faction brother gone they were puzzled
[21:55] see and so then all right I went in
[21:58] Tuesday morning and for 3 hours or so
[22:02] before I left laying in the bed about 5
[22:03] in the morning, the Holy Spirit said,
[22:05] "Take the bruised serpent with you." And
[22:07] I took it and then that was the word of
[22:09] the Lord. I read three pages from the
[22:11] bruised serpent that Brother Bram left
[22:13] the field. When the bruis the serpent
[22:16] come out of Canada and uh it went down
[22:19] to Georgia and you who follow the
[22:20] message, you know what I'm talking
[22:21] about. They come out of Canada uh that
[22:24] that that deity spirit that William Ram
[22:26] is God. See, and then they went to
[22:28] Georgia and on on your bruis serpent,
[22:31] Brother Brandham was so torn up, he left
[22:33] the field. He said, "And every soul that
[22:36] that he cannot bring to the Lord will be
[22:38] laid at their charge on the day of
[22:40] judgment." And he was so shook up and
[22:42] torn up. You read it there and you see,
[22:44] he'll leave the field. He said, "Oh,
[22:46] that is a horrible thing. That's an
[22:48] error. That is of the devil. That's thus
[22:50] saith the Lord." So, I read all that to
[22:52] them and it just sort of straightened it
[22:54] out. But what it was, he had a vision
[22:57] and he started to hit the serpent on on
[23:00] the head and somebody said don't do that
[23:03] there. Hit him here and he hit him in
[23:04] the middle. So
[23:06] um Canada North and Georgia is in the
[23:09] south and Indiana was in the middle and
[23:11] he chopped the serpent in half in the
[23:13] middle and bruised them and just wiggle
[23:16] on into the a little puff of water. That
[23:18] was 19 in the 50s already. And my heart
[23:21] broke to see that same spirit going to
[23:23] Puerto Rico years later. Here it's like
[23:26] it's something new. It's been here all
[23:27] the time. That's right. Been here in
[23:29] America all the time. We go and we live
[23:31] with it right in the message here. And
[23:33] it goes down like it's some revelation
[23:35] under the white stone or something. See?
[23:37] And that's what's there. And so I had to
[23:41] face it. I had to call down to Puerto
[23:43] Rico a Thursday to Rain and David Lloyd
[23:46] and Carmen. That's what they got down
[23:47] there. And I spoke to the pastor in
[23:51] my sister Iris
[23:54] downstairs. Father, Sister Iris, I know
[23:56] she's down
[23:57] there. The pastor in my way thought that
[24:01] she caught the revelation. They was
[24:03] current and brother Eddie was in service
[24:05] down there and he come over to her, you
[24:07] know, he said, "Ah." He says, "See,
[24:08] you're more spiritual than Brother
[24:10] Coleman for you know that the name."
[24:13] See, and you go back. She's down in the
[24:16] basement. God bless you. Amen. So he
[24:18] said you're more spiritual than brother
[24:20] Coleman cuz you know something he don't
[24:21] know. The name of William Brandham is
[24:23] the name of the thunders. You see so
[24:26] there you are. So therefore brother
[24:27] Eddie and Irish they saw firsthand what
[24:29] happened down there. So it happened that
[24:31] the pastor was in brother David's house
[24:33] when I called Thursday. I says put him
[24:36] on the phone. I said brother Lord bless
[24:38] you. I said but I come down there and
[24:40] love and I says told my own people to go
[24:43] into your church and pay their tax. I
[24:45] says, "Now I hear this, brother. That's
[24:47] the Antichrist spirit. I'm releasing
[24:49] David Re from your charge as of now." I
[24:52] said, "I'm telling them to get away from
[24:54] that filthy table. That's vomit. I don't
[24:56] want those children eating vomit from
[24:58] your table there." I said, "Brother,
[25:00] that's Antichrist. And I'll face you in
[25:02] the day of judgment. That is thus
[25:05] sayith William Mary Brown, the prophet
[25:07] of God." So he said, "Well, when when
[25:11] you coming down to Puerto Rico?" I said,
[25:12] "I don't know." I said, "But I'm just
[25:13] telling you now." I said I'll tell
[25:15] brother account whoever else is involved
[25:18] whoever's involved in it if our sheep
[25:19] got anything to do with it. See I didn't
[25:21] do anybody else. See but I understand I
[25:24] can't prove it but he said it to sister
[25:27] Iris and Eddie and therefore I can say
[25:29] it to him. See and brother David told
[25:31] me. So I got that straight out already.
[25:33] So we thank God. So with that is many
[25:35] other things. See so what is it? Brother
[25:37] Brham said that if he uh if the spirit
[25:42] didn't come that said that he was the
[25:44] Christ then he would have to repent of
[25:46] the Elijah ministry for they said John
[25:50] are you the Christ are you that prophet
[25:53] therefore the spirit of Elijah is the
[25:55] spirit of Christ and the spirit of of
[25:58] Elijah is to make people think that that
[26:01] man is the Christ and if that's uh if
[26:04] that if that spirit of Christ or Malachi
[26:07] before you ran him didn't produce the
[26:09] same thing it was in the spirit of
[26:10] Elijah. You understand? See, it's it's
[26:13] the reverse. The spiritual ones catch it
[26:15] on the other side. See, but the other
[26:16] ones, oh, I'm all shook up. Why? Why?
[26:19] What do you mean? Why? It says that thou
[26:21] are you in Christ? Therefore, the Bible
[26:23] said so. That's right. So, you just move
[26:25] on. Amen. Amen. See, and so, but then,
[26:28] of course, Brother Bram's a human being.
[26:29] He felt bad. So, he explained it. So,
[26:32] therefore, that was down there. And then
[26:34] the Lord just went off about 3 hours.
[26:36] the soul to break that out of there and
[26:38] then at night uh preached the wave sheet
[26:41] and presented the wave sheet and the
[26:43] fire fell. Amen. And one of the brothers
[26:46] who was the main one that was uh uh uh
[26:50] projecting these things. He came up in
[26:52] the pulpit in the view of a thousand
[26:54] people and he hugged brother Galdon.
[26:57] See, and then all the pastors went
[26:58] together crying, weeping. And so I
[27:01] thought maybe it was broke, but it
[27:02] really wasn't. See, and when I got down
[27:04] there, Brother George Smith was there
[27:06] and God sent him down there for
[27:08] us. Amen. And so, cuz I wouldn't have
[27:12] known the other side. I only known one
[27:14] side and I might have said something for
[27:16] this side and it might have hurt some
[27:17] sheep on that side, you see. So, whereas
[27:20] might be 15 passes involved, might be
[27:22] only three or four hard-nosed ones, you
[27:24] know, and the others just like confused,
[27:26] you see. So, I had to think of that on
[27:29] both sides and come down the middle. So
[27:31] the other brother asked brother George
[27:32] if I would sit with him and a little
[27:34] fellowship and I did and I got his
[27:36] views. I got his views and these views
[27:38] and I just come right down the middle
[27:40] brother. But when you come down the
[27:42] middle each each side is not going to go
[27:44] all out for you. Telling you right now
[27:47] and I tell you I know but I know that.
[27:51] And so I couldn't get nothing from this
[27:52] side nor that side cuz I stayed in the
[27:54] middle and that was the battle that I
[27:56] that we was in. Sister Cole and I and
[27:58] John and brother. It was rough. it don't
[28:00] be for George Smith. I was ready to pack
[28:02] up and leave that place. You see, that's
[28:04] the way my human heart. That's where I
[28:06] felt because uh I said, "What? I come
[28:08] down here to be a blessing and here I'm
[28:10] at like I'm a devil or something." See,
[28:12] and so I'm only saying what's right and
[28:15] you know the people don't want to take
[28:16] the word. See, they want to drown in
[28:18] their own sorrow. You know, why and what
[28:21] and think back and whatnot. See, so I
[28:25] really I was weary, exhausted, and
[28:28] Jonathan got sick. I just had no desire
[28:30] to go on. I said, "Man, I I'd go over to
[28:32] Caracus and get a hotel and find a a
[28:36] beach somewhere away a secluded spot and
[28:39] just sit down there and look out across
[28:41] the sea to New York." Say, "I salute
[28:44] you." Amen. Praise the Lord. Cuz I I was
[28:48] disgusted, you know. See? So, but uh
[28:51] nevertheless, that's the way the Lord
[28:52] takes you. See, you just don't know.
[28:54] See, so Wednesday night, I had a
[28:57] message. If you see me
[28:59] go dead, it was flat. Brother come over
[29:02] from Bolivia and he got into the
[29:04] situation. Should never have done that.
[29:06] He was a visitor. He got budded into the
[29:08] business in Venezuela and he spoke all
[29:11] emotional everything and just fan the
[29:13] fires and it was already calmed down
[29:16] Tuesday night and he fans it Wednesday
[29:18] night before I preached. Can you imagine
[29:20] what I walked into? Brother G, don't
[29:23] don't you judge yourself. This is the
[29:25] hand of the Lord. and walks out the
[29:27] pulpit and we walk in. Oh my brother
[29:32] gather said shall we stand which late a
[29:34] romantic woman has to preach now and
[29:36] there and therefore I walk into the
[29:38] atmosphere the congregation wondering
[29:40] what is he talking about nobody said
[29:42] nothing and there I was standing there
[29:44] like that nothing dead I preached and
[29:47] preached and preached just pound just
[29:49] like I said just to get it out that's
[29:51] all I even mentioned the raising of the
[29:53] dead here in New York City now you
[29:55] mention anywhere there's a shout goes up
[29:58] back. Then I knew when I stuck that in
[30:01] there, I said, "Well, there's something
[30:02] wrong here." So I just went on out.
[30:05] That's all. And then um but a real
[30:08] blessing come. Brother George says after
[30:11] the first night, he says, "Well, brother
[30:14] Co says, I always told Brother Billy
[30:17] that there was something more to these
[30:19] tapes, something deeper than just
[30:20] quotes."
[30:22] So that was real blessing. Amen. So he
[30:25] picked that up saying, "So I said,
[30:27] "Well, praise God. I'm sure you know
[30:29] what I'm talking about." Amen. See,
[30:32] that's a repercussion from there coming
[30:34] back here and then you know, see, so how
[30:37] do we know the steps of the righteous
[30:39] order of the Lord? Don't ever question
[30:41] God, why you doing something? Amen.
[30:45] Go down there and lay down a wave sheet.
[30:47] You don't know where it's going to go
[30:48] at. You understand? You don't know where
[30:50] it's going. See? But I couldn't know
[30:53] until I got there. And then uh uh that
[30:56] happened. Then uh felt better. Then
[30:58] brother Furlong calls me Thursday night.
[31:00] He comes over and says, "All the
[31:01] brothers are coming against brother O. I
[31:02] can hardly sleep that night." And I know
[31:04] what happened from Puerto Rico. And here
[31:06] I'm in Venezuela. And now here's uh um
[31:08] Trinidad and kind of upset me. And I
[31:11] says, "Boy, I said I know the Lord told
[31:14] me to come here and I laid down the word
[31:16] and all the blessings in both places and
[31:18] now this place here." And so I still
[31:20] didn't get it. I just went on like that.
[31:22] And then Thursday night I just had a
[31:25] heart. Well, Thursday afternoon they
[31:28] asked me to pray for a baby in a in a
[31:30] house somewhere and brother George took
[31:31] us there. We prayed for this sick baby.
[31:34] It had a fever inside and it wasn't
[31:36] nothing on the outside and had been sick
[31:38] for days, you know, and the mother was
[31:40] crying and everything. So we laid hands
[31:42] upon the baby. I saw that baby's healed.
[31:44] I said, "We had a little baby over here,
[31:46] a normal baby." And the eye was crossed
[31:48] there and just uh picked the baby up in
[31:50] dedication and God healed the baby. I
[31:53] said, "That baby's healed now." That's
[31:54] it. I said, "Mother, he's healed now."
[31:58] Spoke those words and went on, forgot
[32:01] about it. And then this brother called
[32:02] me and then uh so after so Thursday
[32:06] night told brother Galdon was up on my
[32:09] heart. I said, "Brother Galdon, I've
[32:10] been around a long time." I said,
[32:12] "Brother, I know when I'm being jobed,
[32:14] you know what I mean now? And I'm being
[32:16] joged in this place here. I says, "You
[32:18] got a faction here." I said, "Look,
[32:20] there's 15 pastors here, man, involved.
[32:22] You got a thousand people there that's
[32:24] supposed to be on your side. And you
[32:25] think they cannot overpower the 15?" I
[32:28] said, "Something is wrong somewhere." I
[32:30] said, "Last night, 15 people. What are
[32:31] they going to do against a thousand
[32:32] people that's waiting for Herman Co to
[32:35] come and preach the word?" What
[32:36] happened, brother? I I've been around a
[32:38] long time. I said, "No, there was
[32:40] somebody among them thousand out there
[32:43] that's coming against me also." You
[32:45] know, he said, "No." I said, "Yeah." Oh,
[32:47] yeah. See, so then that night I I told
[32:50] the people, I said, "I would be a
[32:52] hypocrite if I don't confess to you that
[32:54] I felt that you that you treated me
[32:56] rough last night." I said, "I'm only
[32:57] here as a visiting a guest here. I don't
[32:59] know what's I'm not anything in here. I
[33:01] I'm here to preach the word to be a
[33:02] blessing to you." And then uh use a
[33:05] platform to uh break among the
[33:07] congregation that William Brandon is God
[33:10] broke right into it. See and they they
[33:13] threw up their hands with a shout. I
[33:14] don't know what was going on. See then
[33:17] we had a wonderful service. The Holy
[33:18] Spirit come down and we was indeed
[33:21] blessed. That was the battlefield say.
[33:24] Then I just didn't feel nothing. And
[33:26] then Thursday morning um I mean Sunday
[33:29] morning rather Saturday night I was
[33:30] praying and God give me something stay
[33:33] there and uh uh sew the seed. So I had
[33:36] one more thought left the ministry of
[33:38] Jesus Christ and sold the seed and then
[33:41] um give me a thought on the adoption and
[33:43] whatnot. But Saturday night Holy Spirit
[33:45] spoke to me and said the supernatural is
[33:47] coming down. Supernatural is coming
[33:49] down. Supernatural is coming down. That
[33:51] was Saturday night. I said, "Well, pray
[33:54] therefore that encourage me." And Sunday
[33:56] morning, the same thing. Supernatural is
[33:58] coming down. Three times it spoke Sunday
[34:00] morning. So, I went on into the vault. I
[34:02] know it was getting ready to happen. And
[34:03] I preached the word of the Lord. And the
[34:05] place went up with a shout. I only got
[34:07] about one quarter of my nose out. I had
[34:09] to bring the whole thing back Sunday
[34:11] night cuz it didn't even get into it.
[34:13] They was open Sunday morning. That's I
[34:16] know when they open. See, you just say
[34:18] one thing, it opens right up. See? And
[34:20] it opened Sunday morning. And they were
[34:22] shouting and praising God. And we had a
[34:24] wonderful time. And then after the
[34:26] service, the husband of the of the
[34:30] little baby that was praying for the
[34:31] mother and father walked up to me and I
[34:34] in the vestibule and they were crying.
[34:36] The father speaking broken English. She
[34:38] says, "Brother Coleman, we thank God for
[34:41] healing our baby. The baby had spinal
[34:45] menitis. God heal."
[34:50] Amen. So I said, "Well, praise God."
[34:53] Amen. See? So therefore, I was, the Lord
[34:57] saved that for Sunday to encourage me.
[34:59] You understand? And therefore, I knew
[35:01] that I was in God's will. And then um
[35:04] the Lord dropped some barley to Sister
[35:07] Coleman's heart. And she could hardly
[35:09] wait to tell me when we we got back to
[35:11] the hotel room and God gave her a
[35:14] beautiful scripture uh Psalm 126. And
[35:18] there I knew because what what it was
[35:21] all about. And when I read that psalm
[35:24] and then I could see just what was
[35:26] happening. And then um Monday morning uh
[35:30] and getting ready to uh leave, little
[35:33] Jonathan got up. He said, "Daddy," he
[35:35] says, "Um, I saw a light yesterday in
[35:38] front of you." I said, "You did?" And I
[35:40] forgot about the supernatural coming
[35:41] down. See? He says, "Yeah." I said,
[35:43] "Well, somebody took a picture cuz it
[35:45] flashed in front of me." He says, "No,
[35:46] that was a light light. This was a
[35:48] yellow light. I said, "Oh, a yellow
[35:51] light." Oh, yeah. Now, in Brother
[35:52] Galadon's church, brother, he knows
[35:54] there's seven sections going down on the
[35:57] wall. And each one is the is a phase of
[35:59] the moon, you know, with the uh the
[36:01] little uh the little crescent over the
[36:04] uh earth there. And he has seven of
[36:06] them. And the last corner is
[36:08] Learia. And in this corner over here
[36:10] down that wall is the the seven stars.
[36:14] And on the east star is the man sing
[36:16] Brandon Wesley Luther right down the
[36:18] line. See said that he said you shall
[36:21] not
[36:22] sow and then he who regards the cloud
[36:25] shall not reap. And there I knew that I
[36:28] couldn't have it all sweet and nice. I'm
[36:30] waiting for for the like to observe the
[36:33] wind. You see? And so but that was the
[36:36] lot and I had to sew the seed in those
[36:38] conditions in spite of the unbelief and
[36:40] whatnot. Now St. John 4:31 to strike the
[36:43] word here for a few minutes. Uh I'm
[36:45] going to come back to the the testimony.
[36:48] Uh Christ had been sewing seed to a
[36:50] woman at the well and Jesus Christ uh uh
[36:53] uh followed his father. He says, "I must
[36:56] have needs to go by Samaria." And his
[36:58] disciples not understanding it and they
[37:01] were are not they said, "Why go over
[37:03] there?" But he had to go. He was obeying
[37:05] the father's will. And he had just
[37:07] finished sewing a seed to a
[37:09] predestinated elected seed of God, a
[37:11] prostitute, the woman at the well. And
[37:14] his disciples were against this, you
[37:16] see, for uh uh the woman at the well was
[37:20] a Samaritan. That's Ham's people and a
[37:22] mixture of Jew and also Ham's people.
[37:26] And they thought it was just to the Jew
[37:27] and they didn't want him to to go to
[37:29] her. She was a prostitute yet. But
[37:31] nevertheless, he has must have needs to
[37:33] go by Samaria. It's our father's will
[37:35] that we are interested in. No matter
[37:37] what our flesh says or whatever any else
[37:40] says, we must do the father's will. Now
[37:42] Christ had swn the seed in a woman and
[37:45] had already received wages of
[37:47] gratification of saving that soul. He
[37:49] had sown and reaped until life eternal.
[37:52] The same day he sowed the seed in her
[37:55] heart and he reaped it. And she left
[37:57] that water pot and she charged into the
[38:00] city brother and said, "Come see a man
[38:02] who told me everything." Amen. Amen. So
[38:04] he had received that gratification in
[38:07] one day. Amen. So the ser and the reaper
[38:10] was Christ and he was the one in the
[38:12] same person and he rejoiced over the
[38:14] harvest of that one day. And just about
[38:18] this time when Christ was rejoicing over
[38:21] the harvest of this one prostitute
[38:23] changed from a hog to a lamb. Amen. What
[38:27] a miracle of God that changes from hogs
[38:29] to lambs. nature of a dirty hog on the
[38:32] street walling around the pollution out
[38:34] in the world out there and change us to
[38:36] little lambs feeding on the green
[38:39] pasture. Oh, blessed be the name of the
[38:42] Lord. Praise God. God giving us the
[38:45] garment of praise instead of a heavier
[38:48] spirit around. Amen. He's dropping the
[38:51] garment of praise up on you right now.
[38:53] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[38:56] So, at this junction, St. John
[39:00] 4:31. And meanwhile, when he was doing
[39:02] the will of God, they were thinking
[39:04] about get something to eat. You know
[39:05] what I mean? They went on to town to get
[39:07] some bills. And here he was rejoicing in
[39:09] the spiritual food, the secret food that
[39:13] the car ones know nothing about. Amen.
[39:17] And here they come back with all their
[39:18] fiddle all ready to eat now. See? And
[39:20] then they said, "Master, eat." You know,
[39:22] and meanwhile, the disciples prayed him
[39:24] to eat. And he says, "Now they were
[39:26] minding natural things." You see, they
[39:29] were they were regarding which way the
[39:31] wind was blowing before sewing. See,
[39:33] they had to take if the wind says,
[39:36] "Well, you're hungry." Well, they would
[39:37] get something to eat. Before they sold
[39:39] the seed. You understand me? See? So,
[39:41] therefore, so he told them, he said, "I
[39:43] have meat." Amen. Right here, I believe
[39:45] it's in the verse here. He said to them,
[39:46] "I have meat to eat that you know not
[39:49] of." That's right. He has a secret meat.
[39:51] You don't know anything about it. Amen.
[39:53] He says uh uh then he says, "Therefore
[39:56] said the disciple unto him to one
[39:58] another rather, haveath any manuh bought
[40:00] him ought to eat?" And Jesus saith unto
[40:03] them, "My need is to do the will of him
[40:06] that sent me and to finish his work."
[40:08] Amen. Therefore, there is our secret
[40:11] meat this morning. Praise God. Jesus was
[40:14] saying here, I have food. I have
[40:16] nourishment. I have refreshment. I have
[40:19] soul satisfaction that to eat that you
[40:22] don't even know anything of. Amen. And
[40:25] then they asked him the question. He
[40:26] said, "My meat is my nourishment, my
[40:30] refreshment is to do the will of him
[40:32] that sent me and to finish his work."
[40:34] And that's a great principle of life.
[40:37] The great sustaining forth in life is to
[40:39] do God's will. Amen. And to accomplish
[40:42] the purpose that we are here for. Amen.
[40:44] We're not just here uh I mean like uh
[40:47] watching a parade. We're here to for a
[40:49] purpose. God has predestined the sons
[40:52] and daughters of God for a purpose on
[40:54] the earth. We're not here just marking
[40:56] time and sitting here taking up a pew.
[40:59] We're here for the will of God. Amen.
[41:02] And even in the natural life, nothing
[41:04] stimulates. Amen.
[41:07] stimulates and keeps you alive. It
[41:09] maintains uh courage more than something
[41:12] that you set out to do. And when you
[41:14] want to do it in your heart and you see
[41:16] it accomplished that and and you're
[41:18] dedicated to bring that thing about when
[41:20] you see that happen, you are you have
[41:23] joy. Is that right? That's in the
[41:25] natural realm. But what about God on his
[41:28] father's will to go by Samaria and a
[41:31] prostitute? Amen. and then seeing it.
[41:33] But that elected predestinated seed of
[41:36] God, a prostitute. Amen. Wise. She was
[41:40] black as a tar, black tar in front of
[41:43] God. But in heaven, she was white as
[41:46] snow. Amen. She had an attribute up
[41:48] there. Amen. And as the word approached
[41:51] that black heart, then she became
[41:53] brighter and brighter as he spoke the
[41:55] word of God. There was a Pharisees who
[41:58] was white in their own hearts, but they
[42:01] approached the word, it got blacker and
[42:03] blacker and blacker. Amen. For he that
[42:05] think he is something, take heed. That's
[42:07] your call. For we are nothing. Praise
[42:10] God. We're only what God makes us and
[42:12] what his blood has cleansed us to be.
[42:15] Then we are something. We are children
[42:17] of God through the blood of Jesus
[42:19] Christ. Thank God for brother Tony and
[42:22] these brothers here. They are not
[42:24] regarding the wives or the young ones in
[42:27] helping these young people. They are
[42:29] dedicated to the will of God and to
[42:32] finish the work. Amen. And if they have
[42:35] that attitude, God will bless them in
[42:37] everything. What are you dedicated to?
[42:40] Regardless of your wife, she's saved and
[42:42] and the young ones. But these are the
[42:44] ones that's the devil is trying to kill
[42:46] them. He's trying to get them, brother.
[42:49] Yes, sir. When I see these men dedicated
[42:52] to that, oh, praise God as Jesus Christ
[42:55] said in Psalm 40, I delight to do thy
[42:57] will, oh God. And so we have the same
[43:00] thing in our hearts, doing his will,
[43:02] sowing seeds of righteousness, reaping
[43:05] in mercy, sewing the seeds, reaping the
[43:07] fruit, finishing the work to complete
[43:09] and bring to an end. Now Jesus Christ
[43:12] speaking here of the field is white to
[43:14] harvest. He says, don't you begin to
[43:17] think in yourself that there's four
[43:18] months to harvest. This was in the month
[43:20] of December here because the harvest in
[43:23] in in Israel come in April. So he was
[43:25] saying don't think that there's four
[43:27] months off. Don't put it off. He said
[43:29] the field is already wiped to harvest.
[43:32] What field? Why that woman at the well
[43:34] had gone into the city and sold the
[43:37] seed. She had said come see a man. Here
[43:40] come the harvest field coming out to
[43:42] Christ. He saw him coming down the roads
[43:44] coming down the mountains coming up to
[43:45] him. Said the field is already wiped the
[43:48] harvest. I want you to wait till April.
[43:50] Here he come right now. Praise God. And
[43:53] they even asked him to stay and he held
[43:54] a two-day revival right there. That's
[43:57] right. And he only sowed the seed. And
[43:59] about eight or nine years later, he
[44:01] wasn't worried about the seed was sold.
[44:04] If the seed is sold, there will come a
[44:06] reaping time. Oh, praise God. And
[44:09] Philip, a deacon went on down to Samaria
[44:13] to the woman at the well. The same
[44:15] people come out that town. devil in
[44:18] trouble with the true apostolic gospel.
[44:21] Amen. Repent and be baptized in the name
[44:24] of Jesus Christ for the remission of the
[44:27] sin and you shall receive the gift of
[44:29] the Holy Ghost and
[44:32] Christ in the real life and the
[44:35] Samaritan and they had great joy in the
[44:37] city in the book of Acts the 8th
[44:40] chapter. Is that right? and they had
[44:42] joy, healing, salvation, mercy, but they
[44:44] didn't have the Holy Ghost yet. Down
[44:47] come Peter and John and perceive that
[44:50] they have been baptized in the name of
[44:52] the Lord Jesus Christ and they laid
[44:53] hands upon receive the Holy Ghost. Oh
[44:57] brother, the same Christ has swed a seed
[45:00] in your hearts and the Hers are just
[45:02] about up.
[45:04] Just about time for apostolic ministry
[45:07] to come. Praise God. and reap those
[45:09] souls in this day. The seed is sown and
[45:13] it's going to be a reaping time. Amen.
[45:16] Blessed be the name of the Lord. The
[45:18] Samaritans were coming out of the city
[45:20] after the woman's testimony to hear him
[45:22] and they said, "Now we know for
[45:24] ourselves. We we heard him speak to us.
[45:27] Oh, how wonderful it is to receive
[45:28] testimonies and tapes and books and
[45:30] whatnot, but how much more wonderful
[45:33] when he comes to you." Amen. Praise God.
[45:36] And you hear him for yourself. He's
[45:39] promised to do it. He said, "I'll write
[45:42] this trail once more. I'll come to you
[45:44] myself. You receive my testimony through
[45:46] Valentine's 4. This brother, that
[45:48] brother, this spoken word book, that
[45:50] tape, but I'm coming to you personally
[45:52] and I'm going to have a personal
[45:54] identification with you." And will your
[45:57] hearts rejoice. Oh, praise. God's going
[45:59] to overflow with the goodness of God
[46:02] when he comes himself in person. So you
[46:06] hold that seed in your heart that he has
[46:08] planted. I the Lord have planted and he
[46:11] has ordained you will bring forth fruit
[46:13] and your fruit shall remain. So
[46:15] therefore he said don't you sit around
[46:16] here for 4 months waiting for a
[46:18] spiritual harvest. Get on out there.
[46:20] Amen. We can we can have a an immediate
[46:23] harvest of the seed sown. Other words
[46:25] don't be minding dates. Don't be waiting
[46:28] for a 3 and 1/2 year of 1977 and all
[46:31] these things here. Amen. Get on out
[46:33] there. I preached to you December the
[46:35] 30th. I told you on December the 30 is a
[46:38] seed yet in the barn. Read this very
[46:42] scripture. Then the next day the Holy
[46:44] Spirit told me to go to Tucson. Oh, sow
[46:47] the seed in Tucson and saw the harvest
[46:49] of people come with tears streaming down
[46:52] their faces and saying your ministries
[46:54] from heaven and all kind of things
[46:55] happened. Why? There was a rejoicing.
[46:58] There was immediate harvest of the seed
[47:00] sown on the very day speaking the words
[47:03] of God going on down into Puerto Rico.
[47:05] Puerto Rico, Trinidad, Venezuela, down
[47:08] to Puerto Rico. There was a harvest.
[47:10] There was glory and calming around the
[47:12] altar. Praise God. Pass coming in. The
[47:15] people rejoicing from the seed being
[47:17] sown. Not regarding the winds, nor
[47:21] looking at the clouds, not just in the
[47:22] man's mind what they think. I don't care
[47:25] what you think. I only want to do the
[47:27] will of my father who sent me and
[47:30] finished the work. Praise God. Whether
[47:32] they don't believe whether they believe
[47:34] it or not, I'm going to do the work.
[47:37] I thought you had thus said for I do
[47:39] have it on.
[47:42] You just don't know the season, brother.
[47:45] There's a time to pray. There's a time
[47:46] to look up. There's a time to sleep. A
[47:49] time to do everything. This is a time to
[47:51] sew down that seed. And God, if you
[47:54] don't regard the winds and man's ideas
[47:57] and their interpretation, if you'll sow
[47:59] that seed, don't wait for favorable
[48:02] conditions. For the world is cursed. The
[48:04] world is gone. It'll never be favorable.
[48:07] Brother, he come to cause division. They
[48:09] ain't never going to be favorable. But
[48:11] preach the word in season, out of
[48:13] season. Amen. And I just assure you that
[48:15] word has gone forth. I the Lord, my word
[48:19] shall not return to me void. is going to
[48:22] accomplish the purpose that I sent it
[48:24] for. Amen. So, he was saying here, don't
[48:28] be minding dates and natural things and
[48:30] food and whatnot and date setting and so
[48:32] forth. He says, uh, get on out there.
[48:34] The field is already white to harvest
[48:36] and I obeyed my father's will in January
[48:38] this year. So, that seed I went on.
[48:41] Amen. Praise God. Here's the seed in the
[48:44] morning. By faith, I move forward. Amen.
[48:47] not to observe the winds blowing waiting
[48:50] for favorable conditions according to
[48:51] St. John 4:34, do the will of him that
[48:54] sent me. Now, and now we find in today
[48:58] uh the Holy Spirit uh spoke to my heart
[49:01] when I went to Tucson says unity of the
[49:03] faith and brother the the opposition
[49:06] that was there that morning cuz you all
[49:08] know what happened there. You heard the
[49:09] tape and was not the that was the winds
[49:11] blowing. You understand? What are you
[49:13] going to do? You're facing the whole
[49:15] entire message like you know and all
[49:17] those winds was blowing all through that
[49:19] place. I walked out there in the unity
[49:20] of the faith. Brother, I said, "Who can
[49:22] I say the lion has spoken?" Amen. The
[49:26] lion has roared. Who can but prophesy
[49:29] and spoke the word of God. I don't care
[49:31] what they think. It's what he said.
[49:34] Amen. Running through the city, find me
[49:36] a man who will say what he said. Praise
[49:40] God. So there was some secret meat that
[49:44] the father dropped down into my heart in
[49:46] January. He says, "Sow for the
[49:48] dynamics." They won't even know what you
[49:49] doing, but you do, my good. That's my
[49:52] secret meat. Amen. And I've been sewing
[49:55] that. And what a soul satisfaction. What
[49:58] a nourishment. What a refreshment.
[50:00] Sister Cole, I went to Puerto Rico. What
[50:02] a refreshment. Oh, to see the souls
[50:04] rejoicing from the sewing there. We come
[50:06] back here. You know what happened? Boom.
[50:08] Down you went. See, and go back again
[50:10] and see. And down in Trinidad to see
[50:12] those people crying and shouting under
[50:15] the power of God down there and
[50:16] repenting and coming back to God down in
[50:19] Trinidad, what a refreshment. Oh, what a
[50:22] nourishment for our souls. That's the
[50:24] food I eat. That's the sacred food that
[50:26] we was feeding us down there. Wasn't the
[50:28] natural food cuz they to eat their food
[50:30] cold down there. I like it hot so that
[50:34] Amen. to eat cold food. It sits there
[50:35] for a long time. I like to eat my food
[50:37] hot out out of the pot. Amen. Praise the
[50:40] Lord. So it was that spiritual food. It
[50:43] wasn't anything for my we had to dip hot
[50:47] water out of a pot for 6 days down in
[50:49] Trinidad and take a bath that way. It
[50:51] wasn't that. It was a nourishment.
[50:53] Spiritual food. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[50:57] See, that's what it is, brother. It's
[50:59] that spiritual nourishment for your
[51:01] souls. Therefore, don't regard the
[51:03] winds. The Holy Spirit spoke in my heart
[51:06] and told me that I was to go down to
[51:08] these places here. I was a secret agent
[51:10] sewing that seed down. Amen. I went on I
[51:12] heard I did what he told me to do. See,
[51:15] therefore, so my meat was to finish his
[51:17] work. Now, and I'm going to say
[51:19] something now. You just you catch it. In
[51:22] 1963, Malachi 4 went into intercession
[51:25] and he was Rick Addis and Ricky and he
[51:28] didn't know whether he had to get that
[51:30] had a complex. See, and went up here and
[51:32] God showed him seven mountains up there.
[51:33] remember that there standing in the gap
[51:35] and so forth and he said God got to
[51:38] change me that's that change that
[51:39] adoption change in the heart and when
[51:42] God says uh don't wait for the vision
[51:44] just go on out so therefore he had to
[51:46] move forward he's a prophet now he had
[51:48] to move by faith he couldn't regard the
[51:51] wounds he couldn't wait for the vision
[51:54] saying thus say Lord he had to step
[51:56] forward you got so I'm not going to wait
[51:59] around here with the rest of the world
[52:01] I'm stepping forward
[52:03] The prophet is gone. In the minutes
[52:05] everybody sitting around looking for
[52:06] something and look wait for some strange
[52:08] interpretation but I'm taking the word
[52:10] of
[52:12] God of the
[52:14] Lord. Like Gideon the sword of the Lord.
[52:17] The sword of the Lord. Sword of the
[52:18] Lord. Amen. Praise God. Malachi 4 had to
[52:22] step forward and then he said he
[52:24] preached his own message. Why? Cry speak
[52:28] and move forward. And then he had to
[52:30] move forward by faith. He had to preach
[52:33] the token. The token was the life that
[52:35] was in the seventh seal which is Christ.
[52:38] But he had to say it first before that
[52:41] come down. That's what he did in 63. He
[52:44] said the token is my greatest message of
[52:47] inspiration outside of a direct
[52:49] commission of seven seals. That was the
[52:52] one. And any man will know that when he
[52:54] steps forward by faith against all the
[52:57] winds out there regarding them winds out
[52:59] there and no regard and that fire comes
[53:01] down all the satisfaction, the
[53:03] nourishment, the refreshment comes that
[53:06] spiritual one. Amen. And then
[53:09] God and then he posted the church souls
[53:13] in prison and there it was hell being
[53:16] created on the earth. And now we look
[53:18] out and see the devils from hell on
[53:20] earth and God's just holding on back and
[53:23] then he says go on down to Sodom and on
[53:25] the way to Sodom which is New York City
[53:27] to Mark auditorium he stops off with
[53:30] Abraham down in jail. Amen. And they
[53:34] called them to the altar and they went
[53:35] into intercession according to Genesis
[53:37] 18. Abraham was praying for a venture to
[53:40] be 50 40 30 20 they were praying in jail
[53:44] at the souls of prison. Oh God save my
[53:47] family, my husband, my wife, my children
[53:50] for a venture 50 40 30 you can find 10
[53:53] of spirit. And then he come on down the
[53:56] side and he come walking into New York
[54:00] City. Amen. And here he identified
[54:03] himself Malachi for a prophet according
[54:06] to Malachi. I don't care if they don't
[54:08] see them things over there. Brother
[54:11] George told me he said, "Brother
[54:12] Coleman, they told lies on you down here
[54:14] and they tell lies on you over in
[54:15] America." So what's he said? God has
[54:17] just hid them away from New York to keep
[54:19] them away from there. And he's blessing
[54:22] you there. Praise God.
[54:24] Amen. Let your lions and the lions keep
[54:27] them away from you. Wonderful. Let then
[54:28] God can do his work. his secret work.
[54:32] Amen. Praise the Lord. We know what
[54:35] we're talking about here in New York
[54:36] City. This message this morning is to
[54:39] this church and this church alone. This
[54:41] is not for Trinidad now. No. Don't send
[54:43] these tapes down there. This is not for
[54:46] Puerto Rico. This is for New York City.
[54:48] So, if you have a tape this morning,
[54:49] don't send nothing from here this
[54:51] morning down there. This is not for
[54:52] them. I preached down here already. They
[54:54] got terrorists down there. She cares way
[54:58] up the road, brother. I have a message
[55:00] on my heart this morning to bring us to
[55:02] strength here this morning. Oh, praise
[55:04] God. You ready?
[55:07] Amen. Praise the Lord. See, therefore,
[55:09] here we are. And then in
[55:11] 1963, look away to Jesus, the five
[55:14] manifestations of God. The the fish.
[55:18] Amen. The resurrection, the squirrels
[55:20] were spoken. Sister had it right.
[55:22] Salvation. And then he said, "Son, come
[55:24] out and shine 4 days in 63 out there in
[55:26] Colorado." Amen. at the wind sea swim go
[55:30] over there and then he spoke and his
[55:32] wife was laying in Tucson. He was in
[55:34] jail said before the doctor's hand
[55:36] touches that tumor. Amen. It'll be gone.
[55:41] And I'm persuaded this morning. We have
[55:43] a sister sitting here in Mac Murray. She
[55:45] has accepted it by faith. I asked her
[55:48] this morning, "Do you want me to lay
[55:49] hands on?" She says, "No, it's already
[55:52] done
[55:54] for your faith.
[55:56] to
[55:59] your God has taken that from
[56:06] you
[56:07] all my sister and taking that
[56:13] away. She don't even want hands
[56:16] on and that is a prophecy. Brother Ram
[56:20] spoke these words. He said, "Oh, one
[56:22] glorious morning." Amen. And he said the
[56:25] Holy Spirit will fall and and God will
[56:28] take the church a divine love without
[56:31] hands being laid on a sick will be
[56:34] healed. The hillies of the
[56:37] curtain will see I'm feeling that that's
[56:41] coming up on us now this morning.
[56:43] Wednesday Sunday Wednesday Sunday we're
[56:46] in that season. The sewing is finished
[56:50] as far as I'm concerned and I'm looking
[56:52] for the reaping. Praise God. Don't you
[56:55] catch what I'm telling you this morning?
[56:57] Sold the seed in Tucson. Sold the seed
[56:59] of Puerto Rico. So in Trinidad and so in
[57:03] Venezuela he is finished. Yeah. I'm
[57:06] looking for some rec. Blessed be the
[57:09] Lord. Oh, I feel like God just reap of
[57:13] healing here this morning. I feel that
[57:15] God's going to heal little mama's
[57:20] eyes.
[57:22] It's brother is here for you everything.
[57:26] When he walked the earth, blind eyes
[57:28] open up. The grave threw open. When he
[57:31] walked the earth, he didn't call one
[57:32] man's name. They all went from the
[57:34] grave. Devil's cried out. When the word
[57:38] woke to earth, that word is here this
[57:41] morning. He's walking the earth. The
[57:43] entire church here this morning. We have
[57:46] a power. We have a kingdom of God in us
[57:48] this morning. And is turning around the
[57:50] world. Oh, you can have anything you
[57:52] want in your seat. All you have to do is
[57:55] to ask for it and believe it. Brother,
[57:57] you got it this morning. Blessed be the
[58:00] name of the Lord. And then he went
[58:03] through intercession. And then he says
[58:05] the five manifestations. Don't you know
[58:08] what they were? That was the hand of the
[58:11] Lord and his servant way back in Elijah.
[58:14] First Kings 19, he said, "There's a hand
[58:16] like a man's hand." Oh, that was the
[58:18] supernatural hand of God. Elijah knew
[58:21] there was no man's hand. That was God's
[58:23] hand. And that same hand, Jehovah's hand
[58:26] from Elijah and tight came back to
[58:29] Malachi 4 on this side. And five
[58:32] manifestations for the supernatural hand
[58:35] of Jehovah. Listen, saints of God this
[58:37] morning. Listen. What was that hand for?
[58:40] That hand was for the third exodus.
[58:44] Oh my. The first Exodus was of Israel
[58:48] out of Egypt. The second one from a
[58:50] spiritual condition with John and them
[58:52] over into Christ. This is the third one.
[58:54] Now Malachi had preached the third
[58:57] exodus. Then Jehovah come down and
[59:00] manifested up the hand of God for the
[59:03] third exodus. When Moses was going down
[59:06] for the first Exodus, he said, "Who
[59:08] shall I tell sent me?" You tell them I
[59:10] am sent you. Well, I am what I am.
[59:12] Whatever they they need down there.
[59:14] That's who I am. Then that same I am.
[59:17] Oh, he's come back for the third exodus.
[59:20] We're on our way to the resurrection.
[59:22] We're on our way to the raptures for the
[59:23] wedding supper for everything we need
[59:26] for the journey. We need creation for
[59:29] the new bodies. We need resurrection. We
[59:32] need healing, salvation, and power on
[59:35] earth. And we have it. We have the
[59:38] manifestation of the hand of God. We
[59:40] have everything on the journey. If we
[59:43] need food, we speak words. If we need we
[59:47] speak, we have it. Praise God. I want
[59:50] you to realize that that's on right now.
[59:53] We are being raptured away from this
[59:55] world and we on our way. We need
[59:58] healing, we have healing this morning.
[1:00:00] We need salvation, we have it this
[1:00:01] morning. Praise God. See our little
[1:00:04] children being raptured away from the
[1:00:06] world. As the word comes into their
[1:00:09] souls, they're being sold down with the
[1:00:12] word of the Lord. Amen. And then in
[1:00:14] January
[1:00:15] 1964, he went and he put Christ on
[1:00:19] trial. From listen, I'm say from January
[1:00:22] 64 through April, he put Christ on
[1:00:26] trial. And then the Pentecostal
[1:00:30] denomination as a denominational shook
[1:00:33] pulled away from the word in those four
[1:00:36] months. In those four months, Amen. They
[1:00:41] pulled away from the word. Amen. And
[1:00:44] then uh March Alaska almost sunk.
[1:00:48] William Brown said Jesus Christ the word
[1:00:51] officially turned down by Lear Sea. And
[1:00:55] in all June 14 come to the unveiling of
[1:00:58] the mighty God. Come children. The
[1:01:01] sacrifice is here for you now.
[1:01:03] Everything is ready for the journey. The
[1:01:05] power over the the resurrection.
[1:01:08] Creation. Creation means you can have
[1:01:10] clothes, food, or shoes or whatever you
[1:01:14] need. It's here for the dirty. Amen. You
[1:01:16] got it. Creation is all your your
[1:01:20] material physical needs is here. Don't
[1:01:23] ever fret. Don't ever worry one bit. If
[1:01:26] the heavenly father takes care of his
[1:01:28] flowers and his animals, how much more
[1:01:31] it take? Oh, honey clothe the liies of
[1:01:34] the valley. And we are his liies. And he
[1:01:37] needs us on his table this morning. Main
[1:01:39] table is set. And he needs some more
[1:01:41] liies there. Oh liies. Press liies.
[1:01:44] Press. Press all the way
[1:01:46] up. Keep pressing. And listen. When you
[1:01:49] press past the world, you want to break
[1:01:53] out into the dynamics to the fresh air
[1:01:55] of God into heavenly places. And want to
[1:01:58] break out into resurrection, creation,
[1:02:00] healing, and salvation. What beautiful
[1:02:02] it is. and he'll sweep down and take
[1:02:05] those village for his wedding table. So
[1:02:07] keep pressing this morning. Amen. And
[1:02:10] then the Pentecostal ship pull away 1965
[1:02:14] in November Streetport. The in the
[1:02:17] independent ship, you know who I'm
[1:02:19] talking about, shreport, don't you? I
[1:02:20] don't want to say his name. Well, this
[1:02:21] that shook open up and pulled away. And
[1:02:24] in Malachi 4, invisible union of the
[1:02:27] bride said, "The move is on for the
[1:02:29] bride. Thus saith the Lord." Amen. And
[1:02:32] the sh just pulled away. Now what
[1:02:34] happened here? That was
[1:02:36] 6465. I ask you what happened in January
[1:02:40] 74 through May 74. What happened when
[1:02:44] the wage sheep was presented?
[1:02:48] I ask you again, what happened when the
[1:02:49] sacrifice pure undefiled revelation
[1:02:53] Jacob grace Joseph affection was
[1:02:55] presented in his purity? I ask you what
[1:02:57] happened. What pulls away from that?
[1:02:59] individual shorter.
[1:03:02] The hour is here. The seed, the barley
[1:03:05] has been sold. It's time for end
[1:03:08] gathering of the wheat harvesters. Oh,
[1:03:10] blessed be the name of the Lord. The
[1:03:13] sewing season is just about over. Our
[1:03:15] weed is finished. I'm waiting for the
[1:03:17] reaping. I don't know what's going to
[1:03:19] happen from here on out. It either'll be
[1:03:21] sewing or reaping. It doesn't matter.
[1:03:23] It's God's will. That's his will to
[1:03:25] finish the work. It'll be one or the
[1:03:27] other. But we know where we at. Amen.
[1:03:29] Oh, praise God. Did you hear what I
[1:03:31] said? Amen. The earthquake was a sign.
[1:03:34] He said the the uh uh Jesus Christ
[1:03:38] officially turned down. Well, what
[1:03:40] happened down there in March 24th in
[1:03:42] Puerto Rico and the Lord would come and
[1:03:44] people come to the altar 70* 7. What
[1:03:47] kind of sign is that? Revelation 22:17.
[1:03:50] What a sign that was my but it's his.
[1:03:54] Amen. They'll never see it. Only the
[1:03:57] elected ones will see it. Praise God. So
[1:04:00] the Pentecostal sh pulled away in 64 and
[1:04:02] the independent pulled away in 65. Now I
[1:04:05] ask you what happened this year as the
[1:04:08] individual shark pulled away from the
[1:04:10] sea. Oh my, what a season we in now.
[1:04:13] Praise God. Away from the sacrifice. Is
[1:04:16] this the year a sign that the weed is
[1:04:19] mature and that shock individuals ready
[1:04:22] to completely pull away from the word
[1:04:24] itself? The pure sacrifice has been
[1:04:26] presented. Is that what these four chips
[1:04:28] is all about? I don't know. I asked you.
[1:04:31] Is that what it's all about? Praise God.
[1:04:33] Tucson tapes going across America. Open
[1:04:35] to Europe and up into Canada. All
[1:04:37] around. Sold out. Sold out in Spanish
[1:04:40] countries all around. Sold out. Amen.
[1:04:43] Secret meat. Do the will of my father.
[1:04:46] Praise whether they understand or don't
[1:04:48] understand. You just do the will of your
[1:04:49] father. Amen. Is the sewing season over?
[1:04:52] In closing, 2
[1:04:54] Kings 19:29.
[1:04:56] Amen. Well, I remember therefore out the
[1:04:59] the thing that came to New York City, do
[1:05:02] you all remember that there that that
[1:05:03] happened to New York uh the the
[1:05:06] commanded blessing? Remember that there
[1:05:08] six years the seventh year 8th and 9th
[1:05:11] year is a commanded blessing. You don't
[1:05:13] eat you don't plant nothing in the
[1:05:15] seventh year. Amen. You don't you don't
[1:05:18] do anything in the eighth year and or
[1:05:20] until the ninth year crops come in.
[1:05:22] Where is the season? This is that third
[1:05:24] year and God gives a three-year revival.
[1:05:27] This is a word revival here. Now, now
[1:05:30] Leviticus 25:22. And you shall sow the
[1:05:33] eighth year and eat yet of the old fruit
[1:05:35] until the ninth year. Until her fruits
[1:05:37] come in, you shall eat of the old store.
[1:05:39] In other words, until the crops of the
[1:05:41] ninth year come in, you'll keep eating
[1:05:43] the tapes and so forth and so on. See?
[1:05:45] Now, but listen, before you can have a
[1:05:47] crop for the ninth year, don't you have
[1:05:49] to sow?
[1:05:51] Huh? Well, then why should I mean we
[1:05:54] don't only here in New York City here.
[1:05:55] We've been sewing here for years. I
[1:05:57] mean, why go out to Tucson and uh Puerto
[1:06:00] Rico and Trinidad and Venezuela? Why? I
[1:06:02] ask you why after all these years, but
[1:06:04] you got to have a crop now for your
[1:06:06] reap. You got to have the seed sold just
[1:06:08] right. Everywhere around the message, so
[1:06:11] why go out from here? Can't say no other
[1:06:14] way to you catch it yourself. Amen. See,
[1:06:18] he never spoke of the eighth year crop
[1:06:20] fruits. See only the ninth year. This is
[1:06:23] the ninth year. This is the third year.
[1:06:24] In order to reap a ninth year crop, you
[1:06:27] must sew the seed first. All saints of
[1:06:30] God this morning. I wonder is the seed
[1:06:33] sold? The message for the dynamics. Is
[1:06:36] it sold down this morning? That what we
[1:06:39] are waiting for. Amen. Well, we sure
[1:06:41] going to find out, aren't we? 2 Kings
[1:06:43] 19:29. And then this shall be a sign to
[1:06:46] you. You shall eat this year. such thing
[1:06:48] as grow of
[1:06:50] themselves. And in the second year, uh
[1:06:53] that spring of the same, in the third
[1:06:56] year, sew ye and reap and plant venues
[1:06:59] and eat the fruits thereof. This is that
[1:07:01] ninth year, that third year when you to
[1:07:04] sew and reap and plant vineyards, and
[1:07:07] eat the fruits thereof. Sew and reap and
[1:07:10] plant vineyards. I wonder if that is
[1:07:13] what has been going on for 5 months now.
[1:07:16] sewing and getting ready to read. Don't
[1:07:19] you wonder friends? Oh, if it is
[1:07:22] friends, this the resurrection is at
[1:07:25] hand. Just think now want to start a
[1:07:28] little bit. The mechanics is the sewing
[1:07:30] and the reaping is the dynamics.
[1:07:33] So if the mechanics have been sold, the
[1:07:35] right mechanics, then you have got to
[1:07:38] reap the dynamics. And that is the case
[1:07:41] that's just before the resurrection.
[1:07:44] Now that is that this secret meat I'll
[1:07:47] meet is the do the will of our father of
[1:07:49] him that sent me and finish his work and
[1:07:52] what is this uh what is this this uh

[1:08:06] measure of the fullness that of Jesus
[1:08:08] Christ if you don't preach that measure
[1:08:09] in mechanics how you going to get it if
[1:08:12] you don't sew it down Praise and is that
[1:08:14] that secret work? Amen. To and it's got
[1:08:17] to be finished. How you going to finish
[1:08:18] it? Reap it. You'll finish it. Amen.
[1:08:21] Praise God. Now, is he fixing to send us
[1:08:25] forth as reapers to reap the work that
[1:08:27] he sowed through Malachi 4? He himself
[1:08:30] down to Malachi 4 sold in you a work. Is
[1:08:34] he going to let us allow us to go forth
[1:08:36] as reapers into another man's labors?
[1:08:40] And he told him, hey, he says, you enter
[1:08:42] into another man's place as reapers. You
[1:08:44] went to all the prophets and John the
[1:08:46] Baptist, even my labor, and I sent you
[1:08:49] in there on earth, and you reap from our
[1:08:52] labors. Amen. Are we to enter in as a
[1:08:55] Bible and God's people to enter as
[1:08:58] reapers into Malachi for his labors? Is
[1:09:00] this the
[1:09:03] hour? You

[1:09:08] the end. Finish is up on us now. Is
[1:09:12] always finished. Oh my. Praise God. The
[1:09:16] finishing touch to the ground. Bring a
[1:09:18] unity of the faith. Amen. That was a
[1:09:22] seed that was sewed in two. I'm under
[1:09:24] pressure. Brother Barker walked up and
[1:09:27] says, "I see you're chopping up the
[1:09:30] promises for your church and yourself."
[1:09:32] Brother Khan's father had the the dream
[1:09:35] of the sh completely dry. That was
[1:09:38] January. I told you all the way to you
[1:09:42] now. You know I was told to you not even
[1:09:44] know I told you come. Didn't know
[1:09:46] anything about Puerto Rico, Trinidad,

[1:09:49] January. Amen. Now where we at now,
[1:09:52] brothers. What was happening in those
[1:09:54] three countries sowing for the dynamics
[1:09:56] taking the seed of unity and not

[1:10:19] hear what I said? If the sewing is over,
[1:10:22] the reaping is at hand. And that third

[1:11:04] subject tonight, we find this woman, her
[1:11:06] husband had gone. Well, let me read you
[1:11:08] the scripture. You get to understand
[1:11:09] what he's talking about
[1:11:11] here. Uh St. Luke 15, where he took this
[1:11:14] text from the 8th verse. I'll read it to
[1:11:16] you. Just write it down. Even what woman
[1:11:18] having 10 pieces of silver, if she lose
[1:11:20] one piece, do not light a candle and
[1:11:23] sweep the house and seek diligently till
[1:11:25] she find it? And when she had found it,
[1:11:28] she called her friends and her neighbors
[1:11:31] together, saying, "Rejoice with me, for
[1:11:33] I have found the peace which I have
[1:11:36] lost. Likewise, I say unto you, there is
[1:11:39] joy in the presence of the angels of God
[1:11:41] over one sinner that repented." Now,
[1:11:44] that's where he took a text from. See,
[1:11:46] excuse me. Now he said in our subject
[1:11:49] because tonight we find this woman her
[1:11:52] husband had gone and she had lost one of
[1:11:55] the coins out of her tablet. Now I want
[1:11:57] to try to explain that today if a woman
[1:11:59] is married she should wear a wedding
[1:12:01] ring as a sign that she's married.
[1:12:05] That's to keep other men from having
[1:12:07] anything to do with her. They look and
[1:12:10] they see she's a married woman. In those
[1:12:12] days, uh, cuz they didn't have wedding
[1:12:14] rings, uh, cuz they had a tablet. They
[1:12:18] put it on their head. It had 10 coins
[1:12:20] and went around their head. And that was
[1:12:22] a sign that they were married woman. And
[1:12:24] no man was to fool with them. No boys
[1:12:27] was to flirt with them. They were
[1:12:28] married. Each one of these coins, and we
[1:12:31] only had time, but I haven't. I could
[1:12:34] tell you what each one of these coins
[1:12:36] meant. It was placed in there. And each
[1:12:38] coin meant a certain virtue of that
[1:12:40] woman. The first meaning her love to her
[1:12:42] husband. Second, her pledge of virtue to
[1:12:45] live clean for him. And the third and
[1:12:47] fourth and fifth and so on, ninth and
[1:12:49] 10th. If you want to look it up, look in
[1:12:52] Galatians 5. You'll find out that that
[1:12:55] woman represents the church. And the
[1:12:57] church is a spouse wife to Christ. And a
[1:13:00] tablet that the church is is supposed to
[1:13:03] wear is found in Galatians 5, which is
[1:13:05] love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:13:08] goodness, meekness, gentleness,
[1:13:09] patience, and so forth. This that is the
[1:13:12] tablet that's supposedly worn in the
[1:13:14] church, brotherly love, kindness,
[1:13:16] fellowship. And this woman, it must have
[1:13:19] been along about dark that she realized
[1:13:22] that she had lost one of those coins.
[1:13:25] Oh, if there ever was a time that the
[1:13:27] church ought to take inventory to find
[1:13:28] out if they got all the coins on. It
[1:13:31] should be now. It's getting dark. The
[1:13:34] very horns and clouds of destroying
[1:13:36] civilizations hang over the earth. Sin
[1:13:38] and debauchery on every hand. We're
[1:13:41] living in a tremendous time when there's
[1:13:43] wickedness. People who go to church just
[1:13:45] for sham. People who go to church to uh
[1:13:48] to try to hide from their meanness.
[1:13:50] People who go to church and profess
[1:13:52] Christianity and live like the rest of
[1:13:54] the world, drinking, smoking, gambling,
[1:13:56] women immorally dressed, wearing clothes
[1:13:58] because they ought to wear in their own
[1:14:00] dressing room out on the streets before
[1:14:03] public. And brotherly love is a thing
[1:14:06] passing almost. We have not lost one
[1:14:08] coin, but we've lost practically every
[1:14:11] one of them. And we and was getting
[1:14:13] nights and remember her husband would
[1:14:15] return and he found her with one of
[1:14:17] these coins out. It showed she had been
[1:14:20] marked a harlot. And if she had and if
[1:14:23] she had defiled or defiled herself in
[1:14:25] any way, and it was seen by the people,
[1:14:28] they brought her before the priest and
[1:14:30] brought witness as she had been found
[1:14:32] such. And the priest, seeing as she was
[1:14:34] a married woman, took the coin out of
[1:14:36] her tablet, as she had been doing wrong
[1:14:38] by if she had married her virtue, they
[1:14:41] took that out. If she had been flirting,
[1:14:43] showing that she wasn't true to her
[1:14:45] husband, they took that one out.
[1:14:46] Whatever it was, they they took it out.
[1:14:48] And when her husband when he returned,
[1:14:50] he found that she had been marked. And
[1:14:52] that would then he would divorce her
[1:14:54] immediately and have nothing to do with
[1:14:56] such a woman. He did not want such a
[1:14:59] woman. So it was getting dark. It was
[1:15:01] getting along towards dark when she
[1:15:03] realized that she found that she had
[1:15:05] lost something. Time for her husband to
[1:15:08] come. It is getting late. The church
[1:15:11] better be examining their self by the
[1:15:13] word of God. our purity, our loyalty,
[1:15:16] our
[1:15:17] devotion. We've come tattlers,
[1:15:20] tailbears, cigarette smokers,
[1:15:22] backbiters, paid up Jezebels, everything
[1:15:24] in the cabin that the rest of the world
[1:15:26] does. The Christian church is associated
[1:15:29] in those things today. So, you can't
[1:15:31] hardly tell one from the other. It's
[1:15:33] time we took inventory. It's getting
[1:15:34] late now. In order, it was so late. So,
[1:15:37] she had to have a light, a candle, and
[1:15:40] she got a candle. Not only did she get a
[1:15:42] candle, but she got a broom and she went
[1:15:44] the house cleaning. Oh, brother, if
[1:15:46] there was ever a need of a time of the
[1:15:48] lighting of a candle, the sending forth
[1:15:50] of the gospel light, the Holy Ghost back
[1:15:53] into the church, not so much for
[1:15:56] emotion, not for some fantastics, not
[1:15:58] for some emotional worker, not for a
[1:16:00] jump for joy, but for a heart searching
[1:16:03] experience
[1:16:05] when men and women get right with God
[1:16:07] rightly at the end time. And she lit a
[1:16:10] candle to give her light. Oh brother,
[1:16:13] every little candle in here ought to be
[1:16:14] lit tonight. Not only that, but she got
[1:16:17] the broom and the neighbors could see
[1:16:18] the dust flying. She had a real house
[1:16:21] cleaning time for her husband was about
[1:16:23] to come and he caught her with that one
[1:16:26] coin out. She was a harlot. Brother, we
[1:16:28] the church of the living God in these
[1:16:30] great hours that we're living in now, it
[1:16:32] behooves us to check up. So that's what
[1:16:35] I'm saying this morning. Is the sewing
[1:16:37] over? Is it reaping time? It's time to
[1:16:39] check up, brothers, sisters. Amen. See,
[1:16:42] we're at the end time. The coming of the
[1:16:45] Christ is at hand. There's not another
[1:16:48] hope in the world for the church. And
[1:16:50] look, the church is lolly. The church
[1:16:52] has no conscience no more. You can
[1:16:54] hardly wake them up. The Bible say they
[1:16:57] will come in that condition when they
[1:16:58] say, "Lo, our Lord delays is coming."
[1:17:01] And they'll be devouring and biting one
[1:17:03] another and so forth and fighting
[1:17:04] around. It's just exactly that hour.
[1:17:07] Everything's ready. The pages is turned
[1:17:09] and is it as it was like that and it's
[1:17:12] ready the coming of the Lord. The
[1:17:14] Lutheran church lost her light. The
[1:17:16] Methodist lost her light. The Baptist
[1:17:18] lost her light. The Pentecostal lost her
[1:17:20] light. Every light seems to be gone. The
[1:17:23] Pentecostal people. The holistic is
[1:17:26] acting like exactly like the Methodist.
[1:17:28] The Methodist acting exactly like the
[1:17:30] Baptist. The Baptist acting like the
[1:17:32] Lutheran. The Lutheran is acting like
[1:17:33] the Catholic. And it's all gone back to
[1:17:36] one great big conglomeration of sin.
[1:17:39] That's right. We're in the end times,
[1:17:41] the coming of the Lord. Now hear these
[1:17:42] words right here. Here it is right here.
[1:17:44] Now she had a house cleaning time. She
[1:17:47] scrubbed the floors. She swept the
[1:17:50] walls. She took down the cobweb. She
[1:17:52] kept on until she found what she had
[1:17:54] lost. And when she did, she called her
[1:17:57] little sister churches to come. Oh my.
[1:18:02] You know what I'm saying? Amen. Oh, let
[1:18:05] me read on. I hope you're getting it. I
[1:18:08] don't care if you're a Methodist,
[1:18:09] Baptist, Pentecost,
[1:18:11] Presbyterian. Come, let us rejoice
[1:18:14] together. When that time come when the
[1:18:17] church finds it brotherly love, when the
[1:18:19] church finds it holy decency, when the
[1:18:21] church finds its place in Christ, here
[1:18:24] it is. When it finds its place in
[1:18:26] Christ, it'll call the other members of
[1:18:29] the body. Come and rejoice with us. Oh,
[1:18:33] praise God. I want to ask a question.
[1:18:36] What is this revelation? In New York
[1:18:39] City, Jacob grace perfection. What is
[1:18:43] the light of the message? There was a
[1:18:45] man over in Norway with the map of the
[1:18:47] entire United in darkness. But oh,
[1:18:50] praise God. right in New York City to
[1:18:53] find that lost coin. That lost coin is a
[1:18:57] peril of the resurrection. And God has
[1:19:00] given a light, a revelation of the
[1:19:02] message in New York City. There's
[1:19:05] something about New York City. You
[1:19:06] watch, you just remember that about New
[1:19:09] York City. You watch, you'll see.
[1:19:11] There's something about it. Oh, I'm
[1:19:13] persuaded this morning. I'm not
[1:19:15] bragging. This is to New York City. is
[1:19:18] not for Trinidad, not for Puerto Rico,
[1:19:20] not for Venezuela. It's not for Indiana
[1:19:22] or Tucson, Georgia. It's for you this
[1:19:26] morning. God has given you a light to
[1:19:30] understand how to find that coin through
[1:19:33] the word of the Lord. Amen. Oh, and the
[1:19:36] dust been flying for 8 years now. What I
[1:19:40] first came to the word of God is
[1:19:42] sweeping out the dust, sweeping out the
[1:19:44] trash in looking for the coin.
[1:19:47] She has swept the house clean. And I'm
[1:19:51] persuaded, oh, praise God, if the sewing
[1:19:54] is over, we have just about found the
[1:19:57] coin.
[1:19:58] The reaping is coming and God is going
[1:20:02] to reveal the coin. And when we find
[1:20:06] that coin here, then it says here,
[1:20:09] she'll call the other sister tree.
[1:20:13] My come and rejoice with us.
[1:20:17] And it says in St. Luke 15:9, she calls
[1:20:21] her friends and her neighbors, "Come,
[1:20:24] come, oh, I'm persuaded." Revelation
[1:20:27] 22:17, the spirit that was found, the
[1:20:31] Lord, Amen. And the bride says, "Come
[1:20:34] and rejoice for the signs, wonders, and
[1:20:37] miracles here. The Holy Spirit is being
[1:20:39] poured out. God is in his people.
[1:20:43] Blessed be the name of the Lord." Do you
[1:20:46] think that friend? Oh my, what a house
[1:20:49] cleaning time. Luther found his place.
[1:20:52] Wesley found his place. The Pentecostals
[1:20:54] found their place. But we have a bride
[1:20:57] today. They're groping in dark trying to
[1:21:00] find all kind of interpretation. But God
[1:21:03] has given you the light. Lit up the
[1:21:04] whole house. Lit up the whole map of the
[1:21:08] Amen. You see how to find that boy is
[1:21:12] back to the word of God. brother. Then
[1:21:15] she'll call the sister churches said,
[1:21:18] "Here it is. This is it." She sold down
[1:21:21] for the dynamics. Blessed be the name of
[1:21:24] the Lord.
[1:21:26] Now, we don't have the ring. We can't
[1:21:29] produce the ring. But according to
[1:21:31] Christ's revealed, the mystery of God is
[1:21:33] revealed. He's got the ring. I'll read
[1:21:35] it to you. Amen.
[1:21:37] All the devils holling about this. the
[1:21:40] manifested truth of the promise of the
[1:21:42] word in her alone. They don't have the
[1:21:44] answer. When Jesus come, why did those
[1:21:47] Pharisees, he said, if I cast out devils
[1:21:49] by the thing of God, who do you cast him
[1:21:51] out by? He stood alone and his church
[1:21:53] stands alone. She's not hooked with
[1:21:56] anything. But he was identified by God
[1:21:58] being a body that God dwelt in. And the
[1:22:01] church is identified by his body doing
[1:22:04] the same thing. She is his body, the
[1:22:07] manifest truth of his promised word for
[1:22:09] the last days. And she and she alone
[1:22:13] stands by it. That's why the devil's
[1:22:15] hollering these great organizations to
[1:22:17] set up something to close her up.
[1:22:19] They'll never do it. She'll be taken up,
[1:22:22] not closed up. I like that one. They're
[1:22:25] worried about being closed down. Will be
[1:22:27] going up, brother. Ain't going to be
[1:22:29] closed down. No, sir. At that right
[1:22:31] moment, you going to take a look. She is
[1:22:34] now risen by the power of the vindicated
[1:22:37] word promised to her. Amen. How Abri
[1:22:40] holds that promise and how you are
[1:22:43] looking for that coin. You understand?
[1:22:45] Dedicated to find it and sweeping out
[1:22:48] the house with a broom of the word.
[1:22:49] Amen. How that bride hole I said I
[1:22:52] promise the the the adopted baby. You
[1:22:56] got it. How you hold that little adopted
[1:22:58] baby to the real one. Amen. Amen. You
[1:23:01] got it now. Praise God. He told me he
[1:23:04] would return after me. I believe you.
[1:23:06] See? Yes, sir. To meet her headship, her
[1:23:09] redeemer, her husband, her king, her
[1:23:11] lord, her lover, her savior, and a
[1:23:13] provided meeting place. He's got a place
[1:23:15] to meet him. You know, the bridegroom
[1:23:17] don't leave nothing out. He's got the
[1:23:20] ring.
[1:23:22] The lost heaven. Amen. He's got it. And
[1:23:25] when he comes down with the dynamics, he
[1:23:27] gives it to you. Amen. But he wants you
[1:23:29] looking for it. Amen. Amen. They lost it
[1:23:32] in Rome and in thy tyrant church. It was
[1:23:35] lost. Amen. And Luther Wesley Pentecost.
[1:23:38] And now the light come to sweep the
[1:23:40] thing out and look for it. And Malachi
[1:23:42] 4's message has given us the light to
[1:23:45] look for that lost hand. And they're
[1:23:48] looking for white horses and tents, but
[1:23:50] I'm looking for the coin. The power of
[1:23:52] the resurrection, brother. But when that
[1:23:55] happens, then call the rest of the
[1:23:57] little sisters. Come on, little sister.
[1:23:58] There is a man that's turned on the
[1:24:00] light. Amen. Praise the Lord. The
[1:24:02] revelation on what he's talking about.
[1:24:05] Amen. He He's got the ring, the
[1:24:09] identification. He's got the robe that
[1:24:11] she wears for her clothing scene. He's
[1:24:14] got the the provided place to meet her
[1:24:15] that's in the air. Everything has been
[1:24:18] all provided. Got the wedding supper
[1:24:20] already set. Guests already invited,
[1:24:22] already chosen. All the angels standing
[1:24:24] around in service and attention. They
[1:24:27] are all waiting for you. You and I, the
[1:24:30] Malachi 4 and all the old heroes of
[1:24:33] faith are waiting for this very hour
[1:24:34] here that's upon us now. We are in a
[1:24:37] spouse bride and we've been looking for
[1:24:40] that coin. Are you looking for it,
[1:24:41] friends? Are you really dedicated to
[1:24:44] look for that coin? And taking the broom
[1:24:46] of the word and sweeping out the house
[1:24:48] to see as she lights a candle. And then
[1:24:51] when she finds it, she has such joy. She
[1:24:54] calls her friends and her neighbors to
[1:24:56] see and to rejoice with her. She found
[1:24:58] it. Oh, what a time it's going to be
[1:25:00] when the dynamics strike these
[1:25:02] mechanics. And then they'll come and the
[1:25:04] other little sister churches around, but
[1:25:06] God has done something here in New York
[1:25:08] City, brother. You know that. See, I'm
[1:25:10] not bragging. I'm not talking about
[1:25:11] myself. I'm about the Holy Ghost. I
[1:25:13] ain't talking about myself. But
[1:25:16] therefore, I want to call my friends,
[1:25:18] the young people. Amen. You understand
[1:25:21] me now? the husbands, the wives, the
[1:25:23] families, praise the Lord, call and
[1:25:25] rejoice. Come, come. Amen. The spirit of
[1:25:28] God say, "Come." And God wants his
[1:25:30] church to love him. I believe the candle
[1:25:34] is a message of the hour, the revelation
[1:25:37] of it lights up everywhere. Amen. And
[1:25:40] when they see the revelation of the
[1:25:42] message, which is the candle and
[1:25:44] wherever it goes at, it causes a
[1:25:46] spontaneous commotion. You understand?
[1:25:49] and you get back the uh the phrases
[1:25:51] about it. I hope y'all got to you know
[1:25:53] got to say it to you understand when the
[1:25:55] the revelation of the message come which
[1:25:58] is the light you understand then they
[1:26:01] say praise God that's what that means
[1:26:03] you see otherwise they're going around
[1:26:05] in the darkness see you understand what
[1:26:06] I mean now I believe that the secret
[1:26:09] meetings been the revelation of Malachi
[1:26:11] 4 he's been given New York City gospel
[1:26:13] light in order to find the lost coin I
[1:26:15] believe that was that thing he had about
[1:26:17] New York City there's something about
[1:26:19] New York City I believe I'm going to say
[1:26:21] it this
[1:26:22] I mean, it'd be silly for me to buy my
[1:26:24] food in the AMP and go over there and
[1:26:26] and become pay more.
[1:26:29] Amen. I going to do that. I'm talking
[1:26:31] about here. I ain't talking about
[1:26:32] Alaska. I'm talking about New York City.
[1:26:35] This is where we right here and we
[1:26:36] getting the food here. If I'm going back
[1:26:39] right here and say it right here. Amen.
[1:26:42] Praise God. We don't have a counterfeit
[1:26:44] bill. We got a real dollar bill.
[1:26:47] Amen. Dollar bill, William. Amen.
[1:26:51] And when we get to the resurrection
[1:26:53] point, it'll cash in. That's
[1:26:55] counterfeit. Amen. So, we're getting
[1:26:58] ourselves ready. And when New York City
[1:27:00] finds the lost coin, the coin is the
[1:27:02] power of the early church. And when she
[1:27:04] did, she called her little sister
[1:27:06] churches to come. Now, when she finds
[1:27:08] her position in Christ, it'll call the
[1:27:11] other member of the body, come and
[1:27:13] rejoice with us. I don't know about you,
[1:27:15] see, but I'm not going to regard the
[1:27:18] clouds.
[1:27:19] He said, "He that regardeth the clouds
[1:27:21] shall not reap."
[1:27:24] So I look across a man and down into
[1:27:27] Trinidad and Puerto
[1:27:31] Venezuel and that all kind of
[1:27:33] opposition. I'm not even thinking about
[1:27:35] it. I'm going to reap
[1:27:38] for I know I went to sew and be blessed.
[1:27:42] Amen. Praise God. So I'm not going to
[1:27:43] regard it. I'm going to press forward as
[1:27:46] of this morning to read. And as I went
[1:27:48] forward to sew by faith, I'm going to
[1:27:51] move out to reap by faith. Amen. So, we
[1:27:55] going to move out this morning and pray
[1:27:56] for that baby back there to reap back
[1:27:58] something that was sold. Amen. Praise
[1:28:01] God. Brother Joey and his wife sold in
[1:28:04] their hearts, these signs shall follow
[1:28:06] them. But therefore, let's go forward
[1:28:08] this morning with full assurance, full
[1:28:10] faith to reap that seed that was sown in
[1:28:13] our hearts. Amen.
[1:28:15] Now after the morning service, praise
[1:28:17] God, the mother and father came back and
[1:28:19] spoke to me. I told you the baby was
[1:28:21] completely healed of spinal menitis.
[1:28:24] Amen. And then sister Coleman, God gave
[1:28:27] her this uh song which was a blessing to
[1:28:30] me. And so therefore um I wanted to read
[1:28:34] it to you. Psalm uh 126. I have it here
[1:28:38] and I'm close out now. Sorry to get you
[1:28:40] got here too soon. Amen. that when I was
[1:28:43] coming up, I'll just read the fifth and
[1:28:45] sixth verse. They that sow in tears
[1:28:48] shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth
[1:28:51] and weepeth, bearing precious seed,
[1:28:53] shall doubtless come again with
[1:28:55] rejoicing, bringing his sheep with him.
[1:28:59] Oh my, what a confirmation to why Puerto
[1:29:04] Rico the adverse after. I was weeping at
[1:29:08] Puerto Rico and I my heart was broken
[1:29:10] over Canada after heard from brother
[1:29:12] Furlong after I was weeping and I was
[1:29:15] weeping in Venezuela and didn't know why
[1:29:19] and then Sunday morning after I finished
[1:29:21] preaching and finished my course then he
[1:29:24] told my wife gave her the scripture here
[1:29:27] I had to weep in order to bring forth
[1:29:30] coming again and bringing sheav
[1:29:32] together. Uh there's a word that's
[1:29:35] that's completely out of your mind. You
[1:29:37] couldn't even imagine that. You don't
[1:29:39] know what you're doing. You're in the
[1:29:40] thing. You don't know what's going on.
[1:29:41] No, it wasn't no vacation, but it was
[1:29:44] warfare. Now, this fifth and sixth verse
[1:29:47] here, that's what it means. Um it's
[1:29:50] expressed here rather. These verses
[1:29:52] expressing the great truth of sewing
[1:29:54] reaping. The figure is a discouraged man
[1:29:57] who has had crop failures to the point
[1:29:59] of despair. See, and like I just told
[1:30:02] you the three things that happen and you
[1:30:04] know even here I get kind of despondent
[1:30:07] and the word goes forth and you see this
[1:30:09] no change you know that you get
[1:30:10] despondent. You see to preach the word,
[1:30:12] the revelation comes here in New York
[1:30:13] City and no change. Just the same old
[1:30:16] thing over you're weeping. You're sowing
[1:30:18] the seed weeping. You understand? And
[1:30:21] that's what it happened here for over 8
[1:30:23] years. It happened there and you know
[1:30:25] where you going then when this uh
[1:30:26] scripture come oh praise God.
[1:30:30] Amen. That's you don't know what that
[1:30:31] means to me. You understand? So here
[1:30:34] this discouraged man here. He's
[1:30:36] discouraged and he he's had crop
[1:30:39] failures and so forth and he goes out
[1:30:40] over here and it still seems to be fail.
[1:30:42] Don't seem to be bringing unity. See,
[1:30:44] there's a season of time for everything.
[1:30:47] Time to sow a time to reap, brother.
[1:30:50] When the reaping time comes, you're
[1:30:51] going to see it happen. Amen. But then
[1:30:54] this man, though he was discouraged
[1:30:56] anyway, he couldn't help it. He had to
[1:30:58] sew that seed. So it says here, "And who
[1:31:01] sows again in tears and prayer." Oh yes,
[1:31:06] in prayer for no more fear. Oh God, I
[1:31:09] know you sent me here, Lord. And I know
[1:31:11] there's all kind of funny things going
[1:31:12] on. So Lord, help us here. Give us the
[1:31:16] victory here. Tears and prayer. So I
[1:31:18] know this message is right. And I know
[1:31:20] it's the right revelation. I don't know
[1:31:22] what you're doing or why they mad and
[1:31:24] what's going on here. So in tears and
[1:31:26] weeping, you're sowing this precious
[1:31:28] seed. Amen. Amen. He sws the only seed
[1:31:33] that he has. He cares so his
[1:31:35] interpretation his ideas and God hears
[1:31:38] him according to the sixth verse and
[1:31:40] fifth verse here and gives him an an
[1:31:43] abundant increase.
[1:31:46] Oh praise. So when the word of God is
[1:31:48] sown in the hearts, it will produce
[1:31:50] results as he intended it. Amen. It'll
[1:31:54] do it. It'll give bread to the eater and
[1:31:57] seed to the swer. Amen. And God's
[1:31:59] promised word shall not return to him.
[1:32:02] Boy, I want everybody to see it, to see
[1:32:05] what I'm talking about. And it it's very
[1:32:07] discouraging when they don't see it.
[1:32:09] That's you scream, you holler. Don't you
[1:32:11] see it? And right now, uh I I've told
[1:32:14] you already. The coming of the Lord is
[1:32:16] at hand. And I hope you can see it for I
[1:32:20] have to sew this in tears that you see.
[1:32:23] And if you really see it, then you'll
[1:32:25] shake away from those odd little funny
[1:32:27] things that's going on. See, and it's
[1:32:29] the same old thing. the same old things
[1:32:31] you didn't know, but it's coming forth a
[1:32:34] reaping. So, it's time to just stop
[1:32:36] those things. Quit it and leave it
[1:32:39] alone. You live in sin, get out of sin.
[1:32:41] You're not fooling nobody. People in
[1:32:43] here wasn't even to pay their tithes in
[1:32:45] here. I was shocked. I could understand
[1:32:47] it. See that now? Then some people waste
[1:32:50] what God has to convict me of that. Why
[1:32:52] the faces pay your ti do the word of
[1:32:54] God. What even paying the tithes here in
[1:32:57] all this layover? See, you know, so
[1:33:00] therefore, but thank God cuz they see a
[1:33:02] miracle or whatever it is. See, do the
[1:33:06] thing of God. Whether you understand it
[1:33:07] or whether you don't understand it, you
[1:33:09] do it. So it's it's righteousness. So it
[1:33:12] you want to get it back. Amen. See, so
[1:33:16] therefore, is the sewing season over
[1:33:18] with, friends? I want to know. I I want
[1:33:20] to know. Is it over with? Well, praise
[1:33:22] God. I feel it's just about over. And if
[1:33:25] it is over with, it's time for the in
[1:33:28] gathering of the wheat. God has finally
[1:33:31] found that little woman somewhere that
[1:33:33] found that lost coin. Oh, don't you want
[1:33:36] to be one? That little woman that has
[1:33:40] swept the house clean, the filth in the
[1:33:43] house and all these things here and has
[1:33:45] taken this revelation in New York City
[1:33:47] and didn't let it go to not just didn't
[1:33:50] sit there and let it go top your head.
[1:33:52] You took it to heart.
[1:33:54] Now, I hope you read it to your lungs
[1:33:56] now. He gave it to you in New York. He
[1:33:57] ain't giving nowhere else.
[1:34:00] There's something about New York City.
[1:34:01] Now, don't be one of those who just sat
[1:34:03] here and let it go over top of your
[1:34:05] head. You understand? Like the man down
[1:34:08] there in Trinidad said, he said, "Oh,
[1:34:09] God could have struck him dead for
[1:34:12] coming against God's servant." You
[1:34:13] understand? So, it's not the man. It's
[1:34:16] the message to Christ. Oh, praise God.
[1:34:20] His house feeding time. Jesus breaks
[1:34:22] every f
[1:34:26] Jesus

[1:34:38] Christ.
[1:34:50] Yeah. Heat.
