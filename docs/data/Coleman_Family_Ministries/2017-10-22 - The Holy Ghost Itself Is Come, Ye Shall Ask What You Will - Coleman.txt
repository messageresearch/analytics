thing or impersonate the right thing now I say you may impersonate a Christian but there will be there will by and by come a time when the strain will be put on and then it'll show what you are and this is that time a chain is as strong as his weakest link when Christ the son of God was put to the test it show what he was sure when you put to the test it'll prove what you are your life always reflects what's on the inside of you and by and by But be sure your sins don't find you out and that's what we're trying to say Amen some people's sins are caught here I'm trying to catch your sins

made manifest to the people that you that can hear but you life is open before all so no matter no matter how much you try to act this and do this it'll never work it's got to be in you that's the real kernel of the whole story your personal faith in the resurrected Christ as your savior that he's at the right hand of God acting in your place this morning as you're you're acting in his place down here as a witness what do you witness as a snitcher or hiding things in the CH what kind of witness are you what are you witnessing him and hiding filth and and backbiting and you're witnessing Christ here don't fool yourself praise God you're deceived by a devil seducing being seduced and for not receiving the love of the truth God send you a strong illusion to believe a lie that you can sit there like that and be a witness for Christ and you are not praise God amen you're acting in his place uh down here as a witness a witness is to act instead of somebody stand for you as a witness and as your life reflects here what your testimonies in Christ it reflects there amen and reflects here and he's up there as what he is for you reflects both there and here so you are by your faith

God I got you locked in there praise God either you're going to receive it or you're not going to receive it oh H oh my yes sir praise God hallelujah thine the glory oh what a promise for this hour amen the Brian identified Masterpiece statue of a perfect man you will have a perfect faith seven living virtues I was just reading here that's right God walking in you amen okay but oh yeah let me get back over there and get off of that but when we not in imaginary way but prostrate ourselves before a living God a living virtue a living knowledge he going to live now it's going to live on here live live live live live live down inside there you believe it and you're hoping for it up here is going to live it's the word seat down here is a real seat up here living amen amen a living knowledge a living patience a living God is a living power coming by the Living God that's in you now the Holy Ghost itself amen makes a man a Living Image the statue of God what's he doing the same things that Jesus did walking the same way he walked doing the same things he did because it's not an imaginary thing amen there's a reality that proves it see what I mean see how these virtues or these building materials people they don't like me to say virtues then I'll say these seven building materials type in with the church messenger that's to those that may hear the tape and don't like virtuals well the seven building materials maybe that might suffice amen praise God maybe that little pacifier might help you amen praise God Amen type in with the with the church messenger with the I say what he [Applause] said amen now I want you say we're going to take take each one of these words and study them out and show that it proves this if all goes together see oh my now how wonderful that is to see what what it does now this is the house that God dwells in I no other houses this is the one amen so uh not a building with a big belt on top of it in a high steeple a body has out prepared me a body that God can dwell in God can walk and God can see in God can talk and God can work in amen living instrumentality of God God walks walking on two feet in you glory the footsteps of the righteous is order of the Lord God walkth in you for you are written Epistles read of all man and if the life that's in Christ being in you will bear the life that Christ bore oh Hallelujah be therefore perfect praise God Amen and another Foundation scripture before I get to the next one was uh Hebrews 1132 through 40 and I'll just read uh uh 40 and um um verse 39 and 40 let me hit on Motors now are you offended oh praise God we so quiet amen amen verse 39 all and these all have attained a good report through faith they are good report through faith receive not the promise God have provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect see why these scriptures was down in the foundation now you get it these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection Perfection to bring the resurrection and the under Souls under the altar waiting for this church this church here to come to its Perfection but when Christ does come this church you see is coming small in the minority is a whole lot sharper than that but like just like like I uh write that cross there is it's coming up to a needle point until the church in the minority is has got to get to a place until it's the same kind of Mery that just left well Christ left that little Holy Ghost Mery with the with the alpha bride and we got to go back with the alpha word to become the alpha bride with the same anointing cuz that was in Peter they took note that that he had been with Jesus amen HJ amen because when this headstone comes back it's got a pocket where he got to sit right in there and you know it's it just as a camp that sits across the top it's a little flange it's got to sit on there because it sheds the waters and when it comes the church has got to be hone and all these Restless stones of the pyramid are laying so perfect in till you can't run a razor blade between them weighing tons laying in there have uh how they got them up that uh they don't know but they were built and up here when the when the when the pyramid Camp does come the pyramid itself the body of Christ will have to be hone not only just to some just some Creed Doctrine or something you got to come through it will have to be so perfect like Christ till when he comes he and that ministry will fit right smack together then will come the Rapture and the going home so this lays in front of the New York assembly so we ain't got no time to fool around and and play Church praise God God page 65 so therefore are you contend for the faith that Malachi 4 has has uh delivered and he says add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge and to your knowledge Temperance to your Temperance patience to your patience godliness to your godl brotherly kindness to your brotherly kindness love the Holy Spirit and Christ will come after brotherly love then the Holy Spirit then Christ comes because just beneath him the Holy Spirit up at there at the top SE is the spirit of Christ into each Age spirit of Christ into the church to manifest the virtues so you see and on page 61 some people don't know that the virtues was in the early bride it was down in there that's why it came up out of there you find on page 61 I can imagine them Apostles never acted like us they went around probably man a few words until they got in the Pulpit they walked in they did what they were supposed to do and they walked out that's what I'm going to do from here on praise God if I got to see you in the room I go in the room and see you and I'm walking out amen yeser they walked in they did what they had was supposed to do and walked out they didn't let nobody question them God told them to do it yes sir they had power they had virtue they had no argument with man they knew where they stood that's all they knew who they believe they kept on walking in the spirit amen just I said the other night one little nod that's all God had to do uh then nothing's going to stop them they didn't question study hum H weary like we do whether they should do this whether they should do that or go to the elders and ask the ELD what should I do they went ahead and did it anyhow just one little nod from God that did it this is it why how could they know it was a nod from God they had all these virtues in here all these qualifications way down in the ground the alpha bride and Malachi for come to restore it back so what's so strange about the Statue of a perfect man when the first bride had the same thing they had them all in there these qualifications and the first little nod of God compared with every bit of this and with this word they knew it was the word of God all in a way they went they didn't have to worry about nothing else when God spoke they went oh Hallelujah I should be finished by now so you add to your faith The Headstone is the holy ghes Christ and we have to be magnetized to it to be in Rapture oh church it's time to get an action GL you believe that on influence Phoenix Arizona January 13th I believe amen 112 uh 13 what we've seen happen should put every soul in action it should make a church that would make a Revival here in Phoenix allow me to say New York City that people will be flying in from Europe to see what's taking place they say there's a place in Arizona called Maricopa Valley a city called Phoenix allow me to say New York City there's something broke out there until the seven thunders of Revelation 10 that's not even wrote in the Bible is being manifested the power of God is here the end time is here so all that what you have seen should make a church should make some Caleb rise up out of there praise God and get on fire for God Amen friend or no friend praise God now how can we get into action you may be seated December 23rd dep pendic the Holy Spirit spoke My Heart by Jacob uh Joseph affection message and told me the Pentecostals released the Holy Ghost for birth and

Liars start influence also lying on people's character amen but he believes it this way anyhow he start to influence and draw others away from it the thing to do is to protect this message the way

deformity amen and okay now read my context got your Bibles Isaiah 8 chapter I won't be too long with you this is this was down in the Statue of of a perfect man Foundation now we're going to find out why God made brother Bram take it Saturday night before he preached the statute of a perfect man Sunday morning in the year that King yuzzi died I saw also the Lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his train filled a temple above it stood the cphims each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and a post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke and now here's here is a vision here here is cu the the effect of the vision then said I war with me for I am undone because I'm a man of unclean Lips This is a prophet he wasn't gossiping around and telling lies now he's just a man of unclean Li associating with King Uzziah who was struck with Leprosy cuz he want to take another man's office praise God and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto me having alive cold in his hand which he had taken with the tongues from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this ha touched thy lips thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged also I heard the voice of Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me oh if that may the Lord that bless read of his testimon if that could be everybody's testimony this morning and tonight that the the the the Cal of fire would come down and touch our lips all full of iniquity praise God and take all the sin out and burn it out then when the voice of God begin to call out who can I sin and you can say oh with no impersonation here I Lord send me I got rid of all the backbiters I stood up against the impers and the liar they don't like me no more they kick me out of their Fellowship but now I'm in fellowship with you Lord here I am send send me okay praise God my my what uh something huh influence of another praise God now Isaiah 21 verse paragraph 89 now Isaiah King is Z was a great man had a great Revival and had done great for the nation but then he got lifted up and he wanted to go into the priest's office and the and the minister beg him not to do it but he was full of Pride do what he want to do say what he want to say and he took and he burnt the the incense there and God smold him with Leprosy type of sin today amen and he ran out of the building there then uh uh Isaiah had had been friend he leaned on him was influenced by him it don't pay even cuz God ain't going to have his profet lean on a king or nobody God ain't going to have his anointing on that's going to be full of the word leaning on anybody mother father brother whoever you are they going to lean on nobody but that word praise God or they won't be the pride then uh the vision at the temple he saw on the throne of God lifted up the God being lifted up see then Isaiah thought what must I do Uzziah was dead he leaned heavy on his arm and he thought he was gone what would he do life itself was gone for him nearly so what would what did the Young Prophet do he made his way down to the temple to pray he fell down at the altar and he cried out sometimes God lets the props be knocked from under us sometimes he lets sickness strike us he lets disappointments uh heartaches strike us sometimes he does that to get you where you'd be influenced by the gospel praise God Amen be wise enough to catch it don't be stupid enough to walk away from it and that's what God is doing this morning trying to get you have wisdom and Revelation to catch what the holy spirit is telling you this morning not Joseph Coleman but the holy spirit is speaking these words just the way they're being spoken to some people in this is my church if these tapes go out I'm speaking Ming to New York City praise God I'm setting some people in here free that's bound praise God notice Isaiah knew he must uh Isaiah knew he must find something different so what did he do he went to the temple he raised up his hands he cried out to God he fell into a vision he fell into the vision he saw God not on the throne down here but lifted up oh my his train was follow and lift up in the heaven and he saw back and forth through the temple seraphim flying oh my seraphim it means burners amen and the word sarap means which is next to the altar actually the saram is the one who receives a sacrifice and cleanses the worshipper and then presents him to God my you mean to tell me that uh down

serap was an Angelic being and they are the very next ones that God r at the altar and they receive the sacrifice that shows justice of God that sin cannot come into His presence unless it's been been atoned for in these seraps amen you remember in the seven Church ages how they guarded them gospels on on either side you remember we took them back to the Garden of Eden with a flaming sword standing there they guard The Altar and today they're standing outside trying to chase you back into the Garden of Eden with the preeminence of Christ in them chasing you number three to the Garden of Eden praise God with a flaming sword just came up from Puerto Rico is on fire praise God glory we just took it away from Goliath and this sword is on fire is busting the veils this morning praise God amen glory and Isaiah the great prophet when he fell into the spirit he saw God sitting way up amen and said I saw the king the Lord sitting high and lifting up he saw the real king and he saw the serap flying through the building they had wings over their face Wings Over the feet and they were flying with two wings and they were crying holy holy Lord God Almighty holy holy Lord God Almighty what a music what a rhythm you say they must have been singing very lightly and brother Bram on the tape says holy holy holy Lord God Almighty it's on the tape amen Isaiah said when they spoke the pillars of the building shook their voice they was just saying holy holy holy oh what a voice he said the pillars moving Shook at their voice they were screaming those Angelic beings standing next to the side of

action an open Vision to the prophet praise God look at the effect of that and we have an open vision of Seven Seals what is the effect of this open Vision before the bride without a vision my people perish and we have a vision and it's still perishing today we have a open vision and many are perishing sitting in the pews and some are leaving the message and and sitting right in the pews and and reading spoken word books and perishing and hearing tapes and perishing and yet there's an open Vision sitting right there is this correct well where we at church it's time for the Caleb to get into action hey that's all I got to say a there's no hope left there's nothing left but predestinated Caleb who know that they are predestinated and away with the rest of the stuff forget about it we have the word promised like Joel 2 like Isaiah 28 that early bride had plus the son of man who was there himself and he gave a promise of St Luke 24:49 he gave a promise of Acts 1 18 and now praise God he gave a promise in St John 157 and 8 yes sir you abide in me my words abide in you you shall ask what you will St John 15 uh 26 and 27 Oh hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus it's up to you now the holy spirit is up on you now praise God glory to God he said it on St John 15 yes he did pay verse 8 heing is my father glorified that you might bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples verse 26 but when the comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceeded from the father he shall testify me he's going to testify himself and you should also bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning when Malachi 4 called you out hallelujah praise God Amen yes sir you shall not be lost St John 16:12 I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now Malachi for could not tell us everything plainly in those three years praise God cuz our mind would be blowed out so he left all things on the tapes to be revealed in the season in the time and the Holy Spirit is the one to come and reveal it in the time in the season but it's already on the tapes hallelujah praise God because we could not bear it in 1965 some of us wasn't even born we could not grasp it at that time amen and therefore he and we couldn't bear it so he wouldn't put it upon us he just spoke it out and left it there can't nobody touch it until the time come St John 16:13 amen how be when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come and this is what he's saying here now but when the spirit of truth the truth giv Spirit comes he will guide you into all the truth the whole truth hey the full truth TR for he will not speak his own message on his own authority when the Holy Ghost itself comes that's here now glory to God he's taken from Malachi for his message do you know what I'm saying in this season right now since October 9th here the Holy Ghost itself is taken from Malachi for us message the living testimony under the seven seal praise God and bringing these things out to you Hallelujah in this season and in this time the Holy Ghost himself is doing this him he will tell amen whatever he hears from the father he will give the message that has been given to him amen praise God hallelujah prophecy uh and he will announce and declare to you the things that are to come that will happen in the future and that's why we took Revelation 108 through1 a fresh prophecy praise God to
