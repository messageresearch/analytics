[1:09] six verse six shall a trumpet be blown
[1:12] in the city and the people not be afraid
[1:16] shall there be evil in a city and the
[1:18] Lord hath not done it surely the Lord
[1:20] God will do nothing but he reveal his
[1:23] Secrets his secret unto his servant
[1:26] servants the prophets the lion hath
[1:29] roared who will not fear the lord God
[1:32] hath spoken who can but
[1:38] [Applause]
[1:42] prophesy Revelation uh
[1:46] 19:10 of verse seven
[1:53] rather let us be glad and rejoice and
[1:56] give on unto to him for the marriage of
[1:59] the Lamb is come and his wife hath made
[2:02] herself ready and to her was granted
[2:05] that she should be ar raay in fine linen
[2:07] clean and white for the fine linen is
[2:10] the righteousness of saints and he saith
[2:13] unto me right blessed are they which you
[2:16] call unto the mar of the lamb and he
[2:19] saith unto me these are the true saints
[2:21] of God and I fell at his feet to worship
[2:24] him he said and may see thou do it not
[2:28] uh I am thy fellow servant
[2:30] and of thy Brethren that have the
[2:33] testimony of Jesus worship God for the
[2:36] testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[2:39] Prophecy may the Lord had a blessing the
[2:41] reading of his word just a word of
[2:43] prayer Father in heaven we thank you
[2:45] Lord for this day to be able to have a
[2:49] little fellowship with with my church
[2:51] and our friends on the internet I pray
[2:54] Lord you would strengthen my body to
[2:57] give this testimony of my Ministry
[3:00] and may you bless the reading of the
[3:01] word bless it to the hearers ears and
[3:04] heart and strengthen me and anoint me to
[3:08] do what you told me to
[3:09] do receive of our thanks we pray and ask
[3:12] the blessing in Jesus name he say amen
[3:15] and amen you may be
[3:17] seated our brother Norman I'd like to
[3:20] title this uh the testimony of Jesus is
[3:23] the spirit of
[3:24] Prophecy now um there has been much
[3:28] confusion
[3:30] uh over concerning my Ministry since
[3:36] 1974 and especially this this past year
[3:42] 2006 I've heard many odd things about my
[3:46] Ministry the past 32
[3:50] years I don't know what the confusion is
[3:53] or only anything I know it could be if
[3:56] I'm
[3:57] speaking by revelation
[3:59] people are in the humanistic realm then
[4:02] they're trying to reason out uh from the
[4:05] imagination memory affection conscious
[4:07] and reasoning uh from the five senses
[4:11] and I'm speaking from the six sense
[4:14] Faith so it's totally impossible
[4:16] ministers Brethren Church for you to
[4:20] understand what I'm talking about if
[4:22] you're not uh understanding it by the
[4:24] six sense and not your five senses
[4:30] so I just hope that uh helps you and to
[4:33] all the critics my critics that have had
[4:36] much to say I just in brotherly kindness
[4:39] want to uh say the things that the Lord
[4:42] put on my heart to say and concerning my
[4:44] Ministry and I trust and pray on this
[4:46] third phase that the Lord open the word
[4:49] to you and you'll understand what I've
[4:52] been doing and why I've been doing it so
[4:55] that's the so therefore I I would say
[4:58] discern my motive what am I trying to
[5:02] achieve so therefore my testimony should
[5:06] uh when I'm finish should really uh
[5:09] reveal to you and explain to you what
[5:12] I've been trying to achieve since
[5:15] November 10
[5:20] 1964 on
[5:22] Wednesday November 1st this year the
[5:26] Holy Spirit told me to give a testimony
[5:29] of of my three phases which you know it
[5:32] it as brotherly love the first phase
[5:35] holy decency the second phase plac in
[5:38] Christ the third phase uh this Prophecy
[5:42] from Malachi
[5:44] 4 uh came to pass uh June uh the the
[5:50] place in Christ actually the third phase
[5:53] uh June 7
[5:55] 27-30 2006 at Pin Harris then the young
[5:59] people's Retreat October 5th through the
[6:01] 8th it came to
[6:05] pass brother Brandon always said that
[6:08] there are three elements that make up
[6:11] the church and the Bible says so also
[6:14] water blood and spirit if you check
[6:17] closer you'll see that that uh types out
[6:20] to uh uh the word Seven Seals seven
[6:24] Thunder that's the water or what is the
[6:26] word and the blood which is the
[6:28] revelation of Malachi 4's message seven
[6:32] Thunder inspiration and the spirit
[6:35] itself uh which uh needs no explanation
[6:39] because the spirit is there and you feel
[6:41] it and you know it's there so Amos
[6:44] 3:7 says surely the Lord God will do
[6:48] nothing but he revealed his secret unto
[6:51] his servants the prophets and
[6:53] Deuteronomy 29:29
[6:56] declares the secret things belong unto
[6:58] the Lord our God God but those things
[7:01] which are revealed belong unto us and to
[7:05] our children forever that we may do all
[7:08] the words of this law and you could see
[7:12] right here by by inspiration this is
[7:15] where acts 238 would come from and to uh
[7:20] repent every one of you for the promise
[7:22] is unto you and to your children you see
[7:26] so what it is church the prophet
[7:30] makes the word real which was secret
[7:34] things of God hidden in the word
[7:36] Mysteries he shows the people the hour
[7:39] we're living in because if they only see
[7:42] it in the hour past then there's no hope
[7:45] for the church one the church must see
[7:49] it in present tense two so God sends his
[7:54] Prophet to manifest the present tense of
[7:57] it then after is over and then is
[8:02] history so now we
[8:04] come to Amos
[8:07] 3:8 the Lord the lion hath roared who
[8:11] will not
[8:12] fear the lord God hath spoken who can
[8:16] but
[8:17] prophesy in Revelation 19:10 the
[8:20] testimony of Jesus is a spirit of
[8:23] Prophecy so um this whole testimony of
[8:27] Jesus which came from Malachi 4 St Luke
[8:30] 17:30 Revelation 10 1-7 this is the
[8:34] testimony of Jesus Through Malachi 4 and
[8:38] number one it reveal every mystery
[8:40] hidden Mystery written mystery everyone
[8:44] two it introduce the Messiah son of man
[8:47] and three it restored back the faith
[8:50] which is Jesus
[8:52] Christ so therefore um then in doing
[8:56] this he made the word present
[9:00] tense and it and then the Lord took him
[9:03] home and left present tense shout of the
[9:08] King on the earth in the form of books
[9:10] and
[9:11] tapes and that's here now you're going
[9:14] to need a
[9:15] revelation because St Matthew 16 whom
[9:18] the men say I the son of Son of Man am
[9:21] Peter and then uh he said Thou Art the
[9:24] Christ he said flesh and blood has not
[9:26] revealed us to you but my father El him
[9:29] which in heaven so that's the only way
[9:31] you going to understand brother R's
[9:32] message that's the only way you going to
[9:34] understand me is to have a revelation so
[9:37] then we won't have all this confusion so
[9:40] according to Deuteronomy
[9:42] 29:29 those things which are revealed
[9:45] belong to us and our children why that
[9:48] we might come to perfection in this
[9:52] agean now and and make ourselves ready
[9:56] as the bride and then put on the wedding
[9:59] G commment which came from the Prophet
[10:01] come to Perfection we have a commission
[10:05] and not only St Mark 16 and St John
[10:08] 14:12 but we have to come to Perfection
[10:11] Hebrews 11:39 and 40 to bring up the
[10:14] dead we have to catch the headstone and
[10:18] only way you can do that is to uh is to
[10:22] have the ministry of Jesus Christ so
[10:25] therefore whoever follows the prophet
[10:28] the ministry
[10:29] you must uh let your church see it in
[10:34] the present tense and that can only come
[10:37] through
[10:38] prophecy so that's where my message my
[10:42] my Ministry is solely has been solely
[10:46] based on Prophecy since November 10th
[10:51] 1964 to make New York see it in the
[10:55] present tense of it and once you see it
[10:58] in the present tense other words hit
[11:00] that third phase SL third pull then it's
[11:04] over the first and second phase is over
[11:07] and then it's history so that's where we
[11:09] are
[11:11] now so um my testimony starts as follows
[11:15] June 14 I've been through it before I'll
[11:17] just go through it quickly as you know
[11:21] uh
[11:22] 1964 brother BR preached uh the
[11:25] unveiling of God and that night he
[11:27] preached on the Oddball I got I've given
[11:29] a
[11:30] testimony and I was out between two Park
[11:32] cars in a dark moment and the Lord sent
[11:35] the prophet over to me and as a matter
[11:37] of fact walked him over to me outside
[11:40] that night and he came over to me I was
[11:43] in my Dark
[11:44] Hour critics were criticizing and so
[11:47] forth he said brother Coleman I was
[11:49] looking for you and brother Hunt inside
[11:51] to call you out to identify with you he
[11:55] says then he said other things and he
[11:57] said three words to me
[12:00] the greatest three words you could hear
[12:02] God bless you on November 10th
[12:06] 1964 5 months
[12:08] later uh in New York here we had people
[12:12] com out of the Pentecostal church and
[12:15] coming into the message and I had just
[12:17] come out in ' 61 here and the ministry
[12:20] here was there was a lot of Pentecost
[12:23] mixed in the ministry cuz nobody knew
[12:25] what brother Brandon was doing 63 4 and
[12:28] 5 he was just bringing a word and there
[12:30] was no clear Revelation as to what what
[12:33] was what so that's when I was confused
[12:37] uh I mean not confused but perplexed
[12:40] trying to understand are we in Pentecost
[12:43] or are we the prophet or what is going
[12:45] on and on November 10th
[12:48] 1964 the Holy Spirit knowing what's in
[12:51] my heart he spoke to my heart and I
[12:54] heard four audible words Jacob Grace
[12:57] Joseph perfection
[13:00] then I knew that that the Malachi 4 was
[13:04] preaching Perfection because he said the
[13:07] Holy Spirit told me when I went up in
[13:09] prayer on 35th Street there to our
[13:12] little place he says when you go home
[13:15] hear the
[13:16] Masterpiece and check your Revelation
[13:19] with the Masterpiece and of course I did
[13:22] and of course you know what it was
[13:24] Abraham was uh faith and Isaac was love
[13:28] Jacob was Grace and Joseph was
[13:30] Perfection so there was no confusion
[13:34] friends between
[13:36] 1964 and uh December 26
[13:39] 1965 no confusion at all all what was
[13:43] needed was a
[13:45] revelation and subsequently there has
[13:47] been no confusion since December 26
[13:53] 1965 to this present day today dece uh
[13:58] no uh November 3rd of 2006 no confusion
[14:02] in my Ministry at all so anyway um so
[14:08] then I realized Joseph Perfection when I
[14:10] read the Masterpiece and I seen that the
[14:14] Fulfillment of my of my
[14:16] inspiration of Joseph Perfection would
[14:19] have to come to adoption and the pillow
[14:22] five would have to be Veil and I would
[14:25] would be wearing a seven color rainbow
[14:29] coat of Joseph and that would be
[14:32] adoption so then that's what I begin to
[14:35] strive for and forgetting about
[14:37] everything else I look forward to that
[14:40] seven color rainbow coat and of course
[14:43] the lord gave me the scripture Psalm 105
[14:46] ver
[14:47] 19 concerning Joseph until his word came
[14:52] the word of the Lord tried him and then
[14:55] this Joseph Perfection bride until our
[14:59] word comes the seven color rainbow coat
[15:01] we will be trying by the
[15:04] word so then
[15:06] um so I must prophesy until I can wear
[15:10] Joseph's seven color rainbow coat which
[15:13] is the bride's wedding garment
[15:15] Revelation 19
[15:17] 7-8 so now prophesy I've been through it
[15:20] before but I'll do it for the tape why
[15:24] are we not a
[15:25] denomination jeffson bille Indiana 927
[15:28] 58
[15:29] page 33 paragraph 168 now the Bible did
[15:33] say your sons and your daughters shall
[15:35] prophesy Joel 2 now what does the word
[15:38] prophecy mean look it up is to tell
[15:41] something on the inspiration or for tell
[15:45] something and to give you a sign of that
[15:48] all through my second phase I was
[15:51] foretelling about the third phase
[15:54] adoption Perfection Etc the Rapture the
[15:57] resurrection that's what I was
[15:59] prophesying on the second phase I was
[16:02] foretelling and meanwhile on inspiration
[16:06] I was telling my experiences going on
[16:09] during the 32 years of the second phase
[16:13] so it was two things going on I was
[16:15] telling inspiration after inspiration
[16:17] that would come to me and I was
[16:19] foretelling of the third phase place in
[16:22] Christ adoption time seven Living Voices
[16:25] and so on and adoption and coming to a
[16:28] perfect
[16:29] man and then on paragraph uh page 34
[16:34] paragraph 178 he says now the word
[16:36] prophecy does not mean to teach the
[16:40] prophecy means to either tell an
[16:43] experience under inspiration and that's
[16:45] what I started doing since November 10th
[16:48] 1964 or foretell something is fixing to
[16:51] take place and that's what I did under
[16:53] the second phase no
[16:56] confusion nothing to make clear of this
[17:00] ministry all you need is a revelation
[17:03] it's got to say the same thing all the
[17:05] time or isn't the word of God your sons
[17:08] and daughters shall prophesy means that
[17:10] they should either foretell or testify
[17:13] now you look that up and you get the
[17:15] Bible dictionary and see if that isn't
[17:17] right your sons and daughters shall
[17:19] prophesy so of course I prophesied
[17:22] according to Joseph Perfection coming to
[17:25] Perfection plus the three phases uh
[17:28] which was brotherly love
[17:29] brotherly kindness holy decency prophecy
[17:32] rebuking Spirits place in Christ
[17:36] adoption and on page 13 brother Bram
[17:41] said page paragraph 58 same same tape
[17:44] same message now how many knows that
[17:47] wisdom is one of the gifts of the Spirit
[17:50] here's a mind that has wisdom and
[17:52] brother ran speaking about
[17:54] gifts paragraph
[17:56] 59 pardon me now you stop find that all
[18:01] through these Church ages here pulling
[18:03] out the Holy Spirit speaking out how
[18:07] those gifts would be working in the last
[18:08] days now we got Gifts of healing working
[18:12] it's going good well brother there's
[18:14] other gifts that's just one of them
[18:16] that's just a little minor thing why
[18:18] here's a far greater gift right here
[18:21] which would be the best the gift of the
[18:23] Holy Ghost of wisdom to put the word of
[18:26] God together and to show the Church
[18:29] where we are standing than to get than
[18:32] just get somebody healed and I believe
[18:35] that this ministry has done this has
[18:39] rightly divided the word and put the
[18:41] word of God together and on his third
[18:44] phase connecting to the third pole to
[18:47] show the church where we are
[18:50] standing right here on the third phase
[18:53] with the with the inspiration of the
[18:55] call to the Resurrection on the third
[18:58] phase that's very clear so that's what
[19:02] this gift has done for
[19:05] wisdom I'm not a prophet but it's it's a
[19:08] ninefold gift so now we understand that
[19:12] prophecy means to tell an experience
[19:14] under inspiration or foretell something
[19:17] that's fixing to take place and also to
[19:19] bring the word bring the message into
[19:23] present tense and many walk away when
[19:27] you do that because they're looking for
[19:28] for it then not understanding at you
[19:31] prophesying their promises to for
[19:33] nourishment it's for nourishment to keep
[19:36] you alive for 40 years look around the
[19:38] message and where there wasn't a present
[19:41] tense Revelation an echo well the people
[19:45] are dead so that's what this ministry
[19:47] was the second phase of it the ministry
[19:49] of the word but revealed by a gift of
[19:54] wisdom to rightly divide the
[19:56] word so August uh 11 through 17
[20:02] 1974 you know I've testified about being
[20:05] in St Thomas and had a mighty visitation
[20:08] it was there was a mighty visitation in
[20:10] the sky I've been through it the
[20:12] rainbows appeared on August 11th and
[20:15] appeared on August 13th and there is a
[20:18] witness of it brother Ronald Nanton from
[20:20] Trinidad he saw it on Tuesday the 13th
[20:24] and I saw it on both days and then when
[20:26] I saw it on the 13th a voice
[20:29] told me to go to the angel of Revelation
[20:32] 10 8-11 he told me to go and take the
[20:36] little book open in the Angel's hand and
[20:39] take it and eat it up and you know
[20:42] brother Ram taught you I think seal of
[20:44] God or uh mark of the beast uh he said
[20:48] uh the hand uh and and then the sealing
[20:51] the forehead and the hand is what you do
[20:54] with what you what you receive so go to
[20:57] the hand the little books in the hand
[21:00] and take it from the hand take it eat it
[21:01] up he said unto me thou must prophesy
[21:05] before many peoples Nations tongues and
[21:08] Kings now you don't have to go before
[21:10] Kings but you can stand in New York and
[21:13] prophesy from Malachi for's message
[21:17] concerning the Kings concerning many
[21:20] peoples concerning Nations and tongues
[21:23] and Kings you can prophesy by an echo
[21:27] what the prophet said said about the
[21:29] whole world system and every nation
[21:31] every King every everybody so that's
[21:34] what I've done for 30 32
[21:37] years so then uh uh leading up to August
[21:42] 11 through 17
[21:44] 1974 the Holy Spirit spoke many things
[21:46] to me and I'd like to share a few of
[21:50] these Revelations or Inspirations as
[21:54] part of my testimony today on December
[21:58] 7th
[22:00] 1971 between 5 and 5:30 a.m. I was doing
[22:04] my devotion I was working in the post
[22:07] office and I in the morning I'd get up
[22:09] early and then before I had to go to
[22:11] work and I was reading perfect strength
[22:15] by Perfect weakness on 1961
[22:19] Jeffersonville and while reading it a
[22:21] revelation
[22:23] came page 31 paragraph 210 that's what's
[22:27] the matter today
[22:29] God's got a lot of sheep that's gone
[22:31] astray the organizations and things has
[22:34] stole them out brought them out into
[22:37] psychology God give us Davids with the
[22:42] word of God and the power of God to
[22:44] direct it when we go meet these
[22:47] intellectual Giants right with all the
[22:50] pH lldd
[22:53] qus or whatever it might be give me the
[22:56] word of God in the power of the Holy
[22:58] Ghost
[22:59] and I'll tell you we can slay every
[23:01] Giant on the field right we need men
[23:04] that can do this and if you remember
[23:07] brother Brandon when he went out in
[23:09] 1946 he went out uh preaching on David
[23:13] to go out and that's how he went out and
[23:16] here's Revelation that's why he's using
[23:18] it here
[23:20] 1961 in paragraph 2113 and today we know
[23:25] we need a
[23:26] Revival we know we need a stirring
[23:28] amongst the people it'll not take a doct
[23:31] of
[23:32] divinity uh it take a a weakling it'll
[23:36] take uh the word of God and the power of
[23:40] the resurrection of Jesus Christ and
[23:42] slay this thing it'll bring Christ to
[23:45] the country let them see that he still
[23:48] can open the eyes of the blind heal the
[23:51] sick rais the dead he's God conqueror we
[23:56] need a David on train in the theological
[24:01] schools we need a man who knows nothing
[24:03] about that some little plow boy
[24:06] something some little guy with his stoop
[24:08] shoulders not much to look at will come
[24:11] walking down the road with the power God
[24:14] and then uh reading this off of these
[24:17] two quotes excuse
[24:20] me uh 5 to 5:30 a.m. December 7th
[24:24] 1971 heads with the the Holy Spirit
[24:27] inspiration struck me and I called it
[24:30] the rock of Revelation and talking about
[24:32] David
[24:34] stones and I said Stones word of God
[24:38] with the power of the resurrection of
[24:41] God talking about David's five stones to
[24:44] direct a stone to the intellectual
[24:46] Giants The
[24:48] Rock confession
[24:51] Revelation revelation of Christ is
[24:54] directed to the intellectual giant Stone
[24:57] in the forehead
[24:58] so here right here shows you David uh
[25:02] with with with one of his five Stones
[25:04] the a rock Revelation confession the
[25:07] revelation of Jesus Christ is the six
[25:11] sense and it is directed to the
[25:14] intellectual Giants of the five senses
[25:18] and the stone goes to the forehead to
[25:21] conqu it out knock it out and that's
[25:24] what's been going on for 40 years in the
[25:27] message people with the five senses
[25:29] humanistic
[25:30] realm and and brother brandham said page
[25:36] 81 Christ The Mystery of God reveal
[25:39] there's Lucifer at work again limiting
[25:43] the word of
[25:45] God to their reasoning and he told us on
[25:50] page 44 and 45 Christ The Mystery of God
[25:53] revealed it is totally hid from the
[25:59] senses of uh of man you can never
[26:03] understand it 1 Corinthians 2 uh Bears
[26:06] this out verse
[26:08] 9-14 the natural man comprehend not the
[26:12] things of the spirit so friends it's
[26:14] impossible for these ministers to be in
[26:18] the inspiration last 32 years and try to
[26:21] figure out my Revelation then tell me
[26:24] I'm wrong it's impossible because I'm
[26:26] speaking with the six sense and they're
[26:29] trying to take five human senses and
[26:32] understand what I'm speaking by faith so
[26:35] it's totally impossible there's nothing
[26:37] to make clear it is clear as a
[26:41] bell yes sir
[26:44] so the rock confession Revelation
[26:48] revelation of Christ is directed to the
[26:50] intellectual Giant ston in the forehead
[26:52] and The Rock revelation will slay every
[26:56] one of them slay the church intellectual
[27:00] conception of the message now this is
[27:05] 1971 I don't know anything about
[27:07] anything yet I'm just in the message uh
[27:11] preaching from the shout message that's
[27:13] all and meanwhile I'm prophesying when
[27:17] will this come to pass I don't know but
[27:19] this is what he told me and I wrote it
[27:21] down but
[27:23] then uh June 20th
[27:26] 1973 on Mage title ask what you will uh
[27:31] on Wednesday night I Was preparing the
[27:34] people to pray for my for my wife's uh
[27:37] Blind Eye and inspiration
[27:41] fell and I began to prophesy on that
[27:44] particular tape and the
[27:46] prophecy inspiration came from what he
[27:50] had revealed to me uh 5:00 in the
[27:53] morning December 7 1971 one year and a
[27:56] half later here comes the revelation of
[27:59] what I was talking about about
[28:02] David this is how this is how my
[28:04] Ministry is so how can some man a
[28:07] minister being in here understand what
[28:09] I'm talking about unless he gets the
[28:11] same thing so he can't say that he going
[28:13] to make something
[28:16] clear is already
[28:19] clear so while preparing the people's
[28:21] hearts to pray with faith this is what
[28:25] happened here quote there's nothing not
[28:28] another place on the face of the Earth
[28:30] that this Revelation there was a church
[28:32] tied down and they are just that way
[28:34] tonight here's a trouble tonight and all
[28:37] over the world there's a five-fold
[28:39] Ministry yet now here's a here's a
[28:42] here's inspiration for a coming
[28:45] five-fold Ministry that was not around
[28:47] nowhere cuz first of all almost the
[28:50] entire message was against mines in the
[28:53] 60s and the 70s I can tell you that
[28:55] right now so there was no fivefold
[28:57] Ministry and a fire Ministry has got to
[28:59] be called by the Dynamics it's got to be
[29:03] Dynamics and mechanics together and we
[29:05] were only under the ministry of the word
[29:08] you could do a work for the Lord if you
[29:10] felt like teaching you teach or
[29:12] evangelize you evangelize you want to do
[29:14] some missionary work you went ahead and
[29:15] do it I mean could you go ahead and do
[29:18] it but that didn't mean that you was a
[29:19] five-fold minister yet cuz he hadn't
[29:22] even called them and then some
[29:25] say uh it's like watered down they say
[29:28] um I'm a fivefold minister according to
[29:32] Ephesians 4:
[29:33] 111-113 well that's fine but you got to
[29:36] add to that as interpreted by the
[29:39] prophet Malachi 47 sealed seven Thunder
[29:43] message in the adoption season now
[29:46] that's a little different now now you
[29:48] find out according to adoption time well
[29:51] now you got to be called aside called
[29:53] out and you got to be you have to go
[29:56] through a place of trying and you got to
[29:58] have Revelation come forth and the
[30:00] people going to try your inspiration and
[30:03] you got to go through a place of trying
[30:06] Behavior sanctification Etc and then
[30:11] when you proven to have these Seven
[30:13] Virtues in you that God can see faith
[30:17] and virtue and knowledge and Temperance
[30:19] and patience and and and godliness and
[30:21] brotherly kindness then he calls you out
[30:24] and vindicates you visit you with an
[30:27] Angel positionally place you then you
[30:30] become a
[30:32] fivefold
[30:34] minister so all this going around I'm
[30:37] this I'm that no uh not according to the
[30:40] prophet not me but not according to the
[30:42] prophet his
[30:44] message there's not another place on the
[30:47] face of the Earth that this Revelation
[30:49] there was a church tied down and they
[30:52] are just that way tonight here a trouble
[30:54] tonight and all over the world there's a
[30:56] five for Minister yet four head David
[30:59] see is future David's Ministry is
[31:03] finally going to come on the scene that
[31:05] stone is being wound tonight Goliath
[31:09] where did that rock go at you know where
[31:11] it went it went straight to the forehead
[31:14] this is being spoken under inspiration
[31:16] what is that intellectual Powers David's
[31:19] Ministry is going to come on the scene
[31:22] and slay Goliath in the forehead seven
[31:26] Thunders uh when the revelation of Jesus
[31:29] Christ goes to Connecticut now here's
[31:32] the prophecy this is 1973 June 20th and
[31:37] speaking about Connecticut Indiana
[31:40] Tucson and Georgia in South America and
[31:45] all the different places it will slay
[31:47] Goliath and lay them out flat
[31:49] prophesying June 20th
[31:52] 1973 about future in 7 1975 to go out in
[31:57] 7
[31:58] before this is Prophet this is is my
[32:01] Ministry to speak it and go let it go
[32:04] now watch in this here I never caught
[32:07] this until a few years later and
[32:09] conjunction you'll see the Sheep of God
[32:11] come screaming forth praise God when now
[32:16] just now just a manifestation here when
[32:18] the real David Jesus Christ veiled on
[32:22] the third phase adopted when the real
[32:26] David takes that stone
[32:28] of that rock of the revelation of Jesus
[32:30] Christ when that David stands out there
[32:32] with that confession of what the seventh
[32:35] seal is and what the power of God is so
[32:39] he can prove it on the
[32:41] spot and smash it into Goliath's
[32:44] forehead and all the intellectual forces
[32:47] tense White Horse uh intellectual powers
[32:51] of the message will be scattered and the
[32:53] true message shall go forth prophesying
[32:56] about the Third
[32:58] phase direct and of course during the
[33:02] second phase uh all the seeds would be
[33:05] found by Revelation to sow them there
[33:08] will be one more run oh praise God I
[33:11] feel good tonight it's going to happen
[33:14] starting right here in New York tonight
[33:16] blessed be the name of the Lord and this
[33:18] is what came forth and this is what
[33:20] we've been under all these years
[33:24] so the inspiration fell and my wife's
[33:28] testimony in
[33:30] December
[33:33] 1972 uh her eye went completely blind
[33:38] her left eye and
[33:41] then
[33:42] [Music]
[33:43] um on the
[33:45] ministry of the Morning
[33:48] Star something
[33:51] else uh 73 oh yeah and the ministry of
[33:55] the Morning Star no that came after then
[33:57] um in May
[34:01] 73 uh I took her to a park avenue
[34:04] specialist he examined her and said of
[34:06] course uh for cosmetic purposes she
[34:11] could he could take the eye out and have
[34:14] a new eye a a plastic eye and he said
[34:20] but of
[34:20] course this is a Park Avenue
[34:23] specialist he said of course the Lord
[34:27] could work could perform a miracle for
[34:30] you so I was totally shocked to hear him
[34:33] say that so we
[34:36] grabbed that from the doctor when he
[34:39] said the Lord can work a miracle and we
[34:42] took it as as from God and this is May
[34:46] 73 and then I begin to prepare myself
[34:50] and the people for June 20th 1973 which
[34:54] I just told you about ask what you will
[34:57] for prayer and that's when the
[34:59] inspiration
[35:00] struck then on November 25th
[35:05] 1973 sister Coleman had her own dream
[35:09] and woke up and she had seen herself
[35:12] looking into the mirror in her dream and
[35:15] both eyes were totally healed now that
[35:18] particular
[35:19] morning uh I played I preached the
[35:23] ministry of the Morning Star November
[35:26] 25th and you have the book
[35:30] 1973 and then uh 19 in December
[35:35] 25th no December 10th
[35:39] 1973 uh I preached it again a little
[35:42] different the Mery of the Morning Star
[35:44] fars
[35:45] Hills and on you have the book and on
[35:48] page
[35:50] 36 and this is
[35:53] 1973 and I uh just finished praying for
[35:55] my wife in June and this is December
[35:58] and we had a visitation from ministers
[36:00] from Tucson South America India and
[36:03] different
[36:04] places then on then in June I'm speaking
[36:08] here June 14th he said come to the
[36:10] unveiling of the Mighty God identified
[36:12] to the shout praise God and just humbly
[36:15] and sweetly he went on and just brought
[36:18] the word out to my brother Brandon laid
[36:20] it out there now we have that word we
[36:23] have that sword what are we waiting for
[36:26] for it to be ident ify to the coming of
[36:28] the Lord and I see another phase in
[36:31] there the voice of the
[36:36] Resurrection now now there's
[36:39] somewhere we have got to ident to be
[36:43] identified in the voice I'm talking
[36:45] about the voice of the Archangel which
[36:47] is the voice of the
[36:48] Resurrection we can't move now until he
[36:51] does it
[36:53] 1973 and I'm looking for this voice of
[36:55] the Archangel now he will interpret it
[36:58] we can't do it we can talk about it and
[37:02] it makes me get real happy and thinking
[37:06] about it but it's got to be scripture
[37:09] and I see it's scripture I see it's in
[37:12] the word and I see this is me it's my
[37:17] time and my season I'm not Luther ad dip
[37:23] I'm not Wesley a dip I'm not the
[37:25] Pentecostal the baptism and his fullness
[37:28] in the soul with the gifts therefore you
[37:31] can't grow on that but I am with the
[37:35] Holy Ghost which is the
[37:39] faith then I receive the life which is
[37:43] the message and we have grown and now
[37:48] this is my own testimony and now I have
[37:51] grown out here and I can't go no further
[37:57] I I have turned from green to Golden
[38:01] Brown I am mature now I'm ready for the
[38:06] word this is my testimony not knowing
[38:10] that I had a faith was birth November
[38:14] 10th 64 virtue was birth sh of the king
[38:19] and in November 68th was uh uh uh
[38:23] knowledge and then over in Puerto Rico
[38:27] uh no Temperance was uh 1979 the dead
[38:31] was raised then come knowledge up in
[38:35] Elon in Puerto Rico and uh then the
[38:39] godliness brotherly kindness the church
[38:40] almost burnt down I didn't know this in
[38:43] 72 and now here I'm in
[38:46] 1973 saying I'm turn I have turned from
[38:49] green to Golden Brown I'm mature now I'm
[38:53] ready for the word this is December 73
[38:56] not knowing I'm getting ready to go into
[38:58] 74 well I will get a final birth of
[39:01] Brotherly kindness and in June
[39:05] 1974 and then the Seven Virtues will
[39:08] have been birthed in me but I'm
[39:10] declaring it here on
[39:12] godliness so on the same meage you have
[39:15] the message page 42 we're saying there's
[39:18] a river closing
[39:20] out here's what I said November 17 1963
[39:25] in the mark
[39:26] Auditorium in a meeting where the
[39:28] prophet of God stood out there and began
[39:30] to discern the thoughts of the heart and
[39:33] he spoke to a woman and he says do you
[39:35] believe do you believe me to be God's
[39:38] prophet he said wait a minute do you
[39:40] believe me to be God's Prophet according
[39:43] to Malachi 4 I've never said it in
[39:47] public that way God identified himself
[39:51] in New York City amen Malachi 4 was the
[39:55] shout and this is what I declare it here
[39:58] I believe with all my heart I'm speaking
[40:01] for New York City that God will identify
[40:06] himself as the voice in New York City
[40:09] also and when he does oh that river is
[40:14] going to flow so I'm prophesying don't
[40:16] even know it about the voice of the
[40:19] Archangel which will come down to me in
[40:22] Georgia 1974 June
[40:26] 29th so this is what happens you speak
[40:28] and you don't know so this is
[40:32] 1973 and then
[40:35] um just to tie together here on a
[40:39] message which you have come to me and
[40:41] drink June 20th
[40:43] 1981 on page
[40:46] 12 uh so when my wife had the dream with
[40:50] the ey being heal and I preached on the
[40:52] ministry of the Morning Star I always
[40:55] personally believe
[40:57] that her eye would be healed under the
[41:01] ministry of the Morning
[41:03] Star so on page 12 I have another tape
[41:07] 1015 minutes where the Holy Spirit
[41:10] placed my wife's eye healing under the
[41:14] ministry of the Morning Star but I had
[41:17] to walk out and speak it for 8 years
[41:21] knowing is going to come to pass I had
[41:25] to express it like Abraham and also Noah
[41:28] Etc knowing will come to pass God said
[41:32] so knowing that God said so so it's only
[41:36] been waiting for the second part which I
[41:39] already read it to you now of David's
[41:41] prophecy so I read it over to you again
[41:44] what is it intellectual Powers David's
[41:47] minist is finally going to come on the
[41:49] scene and slay Goliath in the forehead
[41:52] when the revelation of Jesus Christ goes
[41:54] to Connecticut Indiana Tucson Georgia
[41:57] and South America and all the different
[42:00] places it will slay Goliath and lay them
[42:02] out flat and they laid out flat right
[42:05] now all over the world it's laying out
[42:07] flat and after and about 3 years ago the
[42:11] holy spirit said that's an an or a
[42:14] conjunction and then he revealed it to
[42:16] me at a later time you will see the
[42:19] Sheep of God many of the sheep are still
[42:22] pinned down but and a conjunction at a
[42:26] later time
[42:27] he's going to slay Goliath he's going to
[42:30] call a special group out and they're
[42:33] going to believe the Thunders across the
[42:37] world and they're going to gather in pen
[42:39] Harris to bring down the power now I was
[42:43] always prophesying about pen Harris now
[42:46] the special group has been called out
[42:50] and they did the work preaching the word
[42:53] and preaching what they understand their
[42:55] measure of the Thunders and so forth and
[42:57] I'm speaking to you right now on the
[42:59] internet and it's right here I'm
[43:01] prophesying it right here that he's
[43:03] going to call a special group out and
[43:05] you right there on the internet and
[43:07] they're going to believe the Thunders
[43:08] across the world and they're going to
[43:10] gather in pin haris see my Ministry is
[43:12] to prophesy to bring down the power and
[43:16] then the rested the Sheep amen and
[43:19] you'll see the Sheep of God come
[43:21] screaming forth a time element when the
[43:25] real David talking about Jesus Christ
[43:27] Christ Veil on the third phase adoption
[43:30] first first take his David's plural the
[43:33] Shepherds this is going on for 32 years
[43:35] 40 years now and send them out for about
[43:38] 7 years with the Revelation in Fort
[43:41] Wayne and around the world and then in
[43:43] 1981 charity the real David when the
[43:48] real David takes that stone of that rock
[43:51] of the revelation of Jesus Christ when
[43:53] that David stands out there with that
[43:56] confession what the seven seal is and
[43:59] what the power of God is so he can prove
[44:01] it on his spot and smash it into Goliath
[44:04] head Hallelujah and all intellectual
[44:07] forces tents white Hors they they're
[44:10] still flourishing tonight but the real
[44:13] David is here praise God see prophecy
[44:16] you see the sheep in the bride set free
[44:19] praise God so that's all part of my
[44:22] prophecy
[44:23] friends and um so we see the
[44:27] prophecy June 20th 73 and I have
[44:31] prophesied since
[44:33] 1973 that my that my wife's Blind Eye
[44:36] would be healed under the ministry of
[44:39] the Morning Star which is on the third
[44:41] phase and here we are now on the third
[44:44] phase still waiting for her eye to be
[44:47] healed under the ministry of the Morning
[44:50] Star so the morning the third phase
[44:53] place in Christ adoption time even the
[44:56] ministry of Jesus J Christ so in May
[44:58] 1974 the three phases the Lord revealed
[45:01] it to me that that by Audible Voice that
[45:05] these three phases are hidden in my
[45:07] second coming and they must come to pass
[45:10] first so then that's in May then June of
[45:13] course you know this story June 9th and
[45:15] 29th some have compassion June 15 1974
[45:20] time is short uh Malachi 4 call the
[45:24] bride call and the call at a little
[45:27] later date to the resurrection then
[45:29] August 11 I just been through it through
[45:31] the
[45:32] 1774 down in St Thomas and September 8th
[45:35] through November 17th 1974 the seven
[45:39] Thunder Revelation and February 23rd
[45:43] 1975 for this saying so now I have a
[45:47] little testimony here for this saying
[45:50] here and it kind of ties in to Sister
[45:54] IET and sister Yolanda Lawson and the
[45:56] pray for sister Rebecca here on the 15th
[46:00] of
[46:01] October and what happened as you know I
[46:04] preached on the Thunders I went to St
[46:07] Martin and there St Martin the Holy
[46:11] Spirit blessed me and told me that the
[46:15] spirit of knowledge would come upon me
[46:18] as it was there with St
[46:20] Martin and then I came on back then I
[46:23] went out Faith to Faith and um I started
[46:27] February 2nd then went to
[46:30] Bowmont and down in Bowmont I preached
[46:33] four messages there and Sunday night I
[46:36] went in brother Jack Bell's office and
[46:39] there he was speaking in the Pulpit
[46:42] closing out he mentioned a s phenician
[46:45] woman and the Holy Spirit spoke to me
[46:48] and told me take this
[46:50] inspiration for this sin back to New
[46:54] York I have I have never said this
[46:57] before and then with that I knew the
[47:00] quote uh this quote here question and
[47:04] answer on the Holy Ghost
[47:06] 1959 uh Jesus said say to the mountain
[47:09] said when the power of this church
[47:11] brings the Brethren the power of that
[47:13] church and that church he said and then
[47:15] bring the Brethren then there'll be a
[47:17] general Resurrection I used that for
[47:19] years because I hard anybody believed in
[47:22] the message that there was be to be any
[47:25] power at all on until brother Brandon
[47:27] preached the rising of the Sun in
[47:33] 1965 excuse me so I came back to New
[47:37] York and he showed me the the in the
[47:40] morning they had the message and he
[47:42] showed me about the wine and the oil and
[47:46] uh new
[47:47] skins so then I begin to preach that and
[47:51] I and I have an excerpt from there so
[47:54] what I'm saying are for this saint
[47:58] this is where this is how it came to me
[48:01] and then on October 15th you know sister
[48:04] uh Evette and then sister Yolanda lost
[48:06] and the Lord spoke to her and told
[48:08] sister evet that um uh you said the
[48:12] right word like had he like like had he
[48:14] WR and then you remember me praying as I
[48:18] was praying I used the San woman and how
[48:22] brother brandom tied it in to had he
[48:25] right then uh if you if you see it again
[48:27] you'll see then on paragraph 21 Jesus
[48:31] said say to this mountain and you've
[48:34] heard about what's taking place that's
[48:38] the ministry we're entering into and
[48:40] right here on the tape I said the third
[48:44] pull we and an anointing Dro that's when
[48:48] the anointing fell when I said the third
[48:49] pull we weigh up the road now soon to
[48:52] come the Lord Jesus and we got to have
[48:54] rapt in faith in a church that can be
[48:57] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[49:00] eye to go to go out or will not go and
[49:04] right here the Holy Spirit had me tie
[49:07] this the the uh the inspiration of the
[49:11] three phases from hidden in the second
[49:14] coming of the Lord I put it in right
[49:15] here as I was reading this so the Holy
[49:19] Spirit was tying in the three phases
[49:21] right into this quote and um but don't
[49:25] worry it'll be
[49:27] there and uh we got to have rapt in
[49:30] faith in a church that can be changed in
[49:32] a moment drinking over an eye or to go
[49:35] out or we not go but don't worry here's
[49:37] the promise it'll be there it'll be
[49:40] there and when the power of this church
[49:41] Rises it'll bring its Brethren and right
[49:44] here the holy spirit is anointing my
[49:47] words as I'm praying for sister Rebecca
[49:50] right here they bring his Brethren and
[49:52] that church of power that church will
[49:54] bring the other Brethren and then there
[49:56] will be a general resurrection and of
[49:59] course a Rapture and here the three
[50:02] phases hidden and the second coming of
[50:04] the Lord right there in the prayer with
[50:07] the sister event and sister Rebecca
[50:10] being prayed for it all tied together so
[50:14] now I want to say something this was a
[50:17] sign to me that virtue power for service
[50:21] is here on the third
[50:24] phase because when I brought it back to
[50:27] New York on February 23rd virtue
[50:31] powerful service fell and which I'll
[50:34] prove to you I have the tapes and
[50:35] everything so trust and pray you
[50:38] understand this uh I connected the
[50:41] second coming of the Lord three phases
[50:43] into the third poll so I feel that
[50:46] according to my prophecy of May
[50:51] 6 uh
[50:54] 1992 when I was speaking about
[50:57] the third pull the
[50:59] faith I said the third pull was here's
[51:02] original Faith the faith we had to
[51:04] content earnestly for the faith once
[51:07] delivered and restored back by Malachi 4
[51:10] through our first phase second phase and
[51:13] now as we reach our third phase watch
[51:16] what's going on here today we actually
[51:18] connect with Malachi 4 third pole which
[51:21] is original Apostolic Faith the faith so
[51:26] as you come up out of that mess you've
[51:28] been in all these years can't understand
[51:31] can't understand nothing and get up on
[51:34] that third phase and all your question
[51:37] about who is Mich and who is this and
[51:39] who is that will be answered but you way
[51:42] out of season if I'm speaking Revelation
[51:45] and you trying to to understand it in
[51:47] humanistic realm you're way out of
[51:49] season if you're not called for it you
[51:50] shouldn't even do it should be satisfied
[51:52] to be nourished
[51:57] can't understand can't understand
[51:58] nothing till you get up on that third
[51:59] phase you connect with the third pull
[52:02] the opening of The Seven Seals it locks
[52:05] right in see it Nathaniel do you see it
[52:08] Church it locks in we actually connect
[52:11] with Malachi for's third pole which
[52:14] everybody don't know what it is and we
[52:16] connect with it we raise up on that
[52:19] third phase and connect with it and then
[52:21] of course I go on and and then I come on
[52:24] down and we connect with Malachi 4's
[52:27] third poll the opening of The Seven
[52:30] Seals as the true word of God the faith
[52:33] okay let's nail it down the faith
[52:35] restored back by Malachi 4 and repr
[52:39] preached in New York City since 1966
[52:43] back there friends this has been 40
[52:45] years there is no misunderstanding of
[52:48] what I'm preaching because it is a pure
[52:51] Echo that come down from heaven so
[52:53] there's no minister in this church or
[52:55] any church
[52:57] can come forward and say that uh maybe
[52:59] they want to correct what I'm saying you
[53:01] can't correct anything cuz there's
[53:03] nothing to
[53:05] correct and it's at this time that the
[53:08] seven Thunders from page 304 at this
[53:11] time when you connect you connect into
[53:14] Malachi for his third pool there's a
[53:16] promise laying there for you page 304
[53:19] the fourth seal other seven Thunder
[53:21] voices to reveal the faith you see it
[53:25] now it will utter its voices to you be
[53:29] no more questioning and that day at that
[53:32] day you shall know and but now wait
[53:35] don't get all nervous frustrated sit
[53:39] down and wait and you know saying things
[53:41] and I don't understand this and who do
[53:43] you think he is and all kind of nonsense
[53:46] you see so I went to Europe uh at the
[53:52] end here my Father in Heaven has
[53:55] revealed this to you not flesh and blood
[53:57] so I can't reveal nothing to you so I
[54:01] can't sit down and have a dialogue with
[54:02] you and try to explain Faith try to
[54:05] explain Michael and all these things
[54:06] here I canot set it back here I cannot
[54:08] do that because uh brother brandham said
[54:11] on I read it to you one in a million he
[54:14] said you you you you have to accept
[54:16] Faith you accept it and in your response
[54:20] in his response and you accepting it he
[54:22] he he gives you the baptism of the Holy
[54:24] Ghost so I'm saying here I can't reveal
[54:28] nothing to you I'm free I cannot reveal
[54:31] anything to you no matter where I went
[54:33] you may be seated I went to Europe South
[54:36] Africa South America why did I go there
[54:39] to contend for the faith that's what I
[54:42] went four and seven Thunders gives Faith
[54:44] a Rapture in Grace and then it says it
[54:47] gives Faith well you accept it and you
[54:49] wait and you'll get the baptism of the
[54:51] Holy
[54:52] Ghost so I trust and pray that this is
[54:55] cleared up to all this nonsense about
[54:57] they don't understand what I'm saying
[54:59] and so
[55:00] forth so um I feel that according to my
[55:04] prophecy of May 6 which I just read to
[55:07] you 19 um 92 as of pen Harris
[55:13] 2006 uh youth retreat 2006 and the
[55:16] prayer I just read to you October 15th
[55:19] 2006 and since the events of healing
[55:23] which is assigned to us the third phase
[55:25] slash third pole is connected together
[55:30] then this means to me that according to
[55:33] brother Lloyd Gonzalez's dream of
[55:36] 627 I have finished marking your Bibles
[55:40] New York and Pa and now it's time for
[55:44] Isaiah 4:5 the pillow of fire on the
[55:47] third phase as you remember the dream
[55:50] that uh brother Lloyd and brother arll
[55:53] went to this church and they had the new
[55:55] message
[55:56] and they asked for the pastor and the
[55:58] pastor came out with a big Bible brother
[56:01] brother V would read and the and the
[56:04] pastor would look he' open the Bible it
[56:07] was like a template he open the Bible to
[56:10] the number of the scripture that was
[56:11] called out of the pamphlet from the
[56:13] revealed word and the pastor would look
[56:16] in his Bible the spoken word and when he
[56:19] put the pamphlet down it was like a
[56:21] template it'll form tongues of fire like
[56:24] the pillow fire and he'll call another
[56:26] scripture out and he'll turn to another
[56:28] page in in the big Bible and there was
[56:30] some marks on it see and when he put the
[56:33] Pamper down on top of that page he'll
[56:36] form the diagram of a tongue of
[56:39] fire this is the dream so he kept on
[56:43] calling some scriptures out as he went
[56:46] through the message and putting it down
[56:48] on the Bible and every time he did then
[56:50] the pillar of fire showed up in a
[56:52] diagram like so finally the last one
[56:56] that he called out that I could really
[56:59] make out of the dream was Isaiah
[57:01] 4:5 and the Lord will create upon every
[57:04] Dwelling Place of Mount Zion upon her
[57:07] assemblies a cloud Smoke by day shining
[57:10] of a flaming fire by night for upon all
[57:13] the glory uh for upon all the glory
[57:16] shall be a defense and when he finished
[57:18] with that brother V looked at me kind of
[57:22] surprised he said how come he knows
[57:24] about this message already so I looked
[57:26] at brother V and I said this is Lloyd by
[57:29] the way I forgot to tell you brother
[57:31] colan came through here before and he
[57:34] marked that Bible for them friends I
[57:38] have marked your Bibles for 32 years and
[57:41] we're on the third phase now and we're
[57:43] ready for Isaiah 45 the Capstone of Love
[57:47] uh with the the pillow fire from Joseph
[57:50] Perfection which will produce a Joseph
[57:52] seven color rainbow coat the revelation
[57:55] of the dream
[57:56] showed the message in the Bible showed
[58:00] the revealed word by revelation of the
[58:04] son of man in the spoken word bible now
[58:09] on the third phase when the adopted son
[58:12] goes out it becomes the spoken
[58:15] word and the word and and the water and
[58:20] the word are together so I trust and
[58:22] pray that you understand that and uh the
[58:26] revelation of the dream show the
[58:28] revealed word by the revelation of the
[58:30] son of man in the spoken word now
[58:32] becomes the spoken word the word in the
[58:34] spirit to go forth together because the
[58:37] revealed word by Malachi 4 takes you
[58:41] back to the Bible the spoken word is the
[58:44] Original
[58:46] Seed so I'm doing this so you understand
[58:49] what my Ministry has
[58:51] been so I
[58:54] believe I believe
[58:56] that now on his stirred face the matured
[59:00] sons of God will begin to come forth for
[59:04] adoption there's my spirit flowing
[59:06] freely get another one over here and
[59:08] place him adoption placing
[59:12] manifesting and
[59:15] uh on um a message of perfect faith for
[59:20] perfect Rapture which I mentioned last
[59:22] Sunday over Leon FRS August 10th 1986
[59:27] the Europe the European Brothers
[59:30] Brothers in Europe should have it it was
[59:32] in brother Freddy paru
[59:35] meeting and
[59:37] um anyway I want I want to read some
[59:40] quotes from there now to go back and to
[59:45] give you understanding of February
[59:49] 23rd um I want to read this here
[59:53] February 23rd
[59:56] uh there was a manifestation down in
[59:58] Georgia of course you know that then the
[1:00:01] seven Thunders then February 23rd now
[1:00:05] we're on the second
[1:00:06] phase and on February 23rd 1975 I just
[1:00:11] gave you the testimony concerning sister
[1:00:13] Evette and also praying for sister
[1:00:15] Rebecca Smith okay here's what happened
[1:00:18] and the Lord told me take this back for
[1:00:21] this saying from bont I preach the
[1:00:23] Thunders so following the preaching of
[1:00:26] the seven thunders in Bulman here comes
[1:00:28] the Holy
[1:00:30] Spirit as I walked out charity fell
[1:00:36] disguised as virtue powerful service to
[1:00:40] form the word image according to 2 Peter
[1:00:45] 1
[1:00:47] 4-8 and that's when my second phase
[1:00:51] Ministry began by a by a
[1:00:57] manifestation so did you get
[1:01:00] that February 23rd
[1:01:03] 1975 uh charity
[1:01:06] fell disguised as virtue powerful
[1:01:09] service to form the word image according
[1:01:12] to 2 Peter 1:
[1:01:14] 14-8 now that happened there and um I
[1:01:20] want to read to you and then in the very
[1:01:22] next week March 2nd 1975
[1:01:26] charity fell as
[1:01:29] Charity now that's where many of the
[1:01:32] Brethren don't understand what I'm
[1:01:35] talking about and they get all mixed up
[1:01:38] so I'll read to you from a perfect faith
[1:01:41] for a perfect Rapture August 10th
[1:01:44] 1986 cuz
[1:01:46] uh charity disguised as virtue powerful
[1:01:50] service was with this ministry in New
[1:01:52] York City since February 23rd
[1:01:56] 1975 that's where all the revelations
[1:01:59] come from that's where the anointing
[1:02:01] come from came from virtue powerful
[1:02:03] service to form in my place of trying
[1:02:07] the word image According to second Peter
[1:02:10] 1 so have what I said on the
[1:02:13] tape now there's a hidden Mystery laying
[1:02:17] in the Holy Spirit
[1:02:19] itself not Luther Wesley Pentecostal now
[1:02:22] itself to perfect this last day Briant
[1:02:26] see now this the holy spirit is it's in
[1:02:31] two
[1:02:32] phases phase one is virtue and phase two
[1:02:37] is Charity but it's still the holy
[1:02:39] spirit it's still the Dynamics now
[1:02:43] virtue power is here in Phase One to
[1:02:46] form or hone the word in you into the
[1:02:51] character into the image of Jesus Christ
[1:02:55] that's the purpose for the power not to
[1:02:57] get all excited and try to run around
[1:03:01] and do this and do that no to form the
[1:03:05] power and
[1:03:09] perhaps uh that's why I couldn't go
[1:03:12] nowhere since 198 89 not to run around
[1:03:16] but form
[1:03:18] power to form the power get the
[1:03:21] character first and then the signs will
[1:03:23] follow it'll be just like that
[1:03:26] understand now watch here's here's what
[1:03:29] I had to go through for 32 years trying
[1:03:31] to preach with anointing and they don't
[1:03:34] understand it now when you go to say now
[1:03:37] I'm preaching promises
[1:03:39] foretelling charity is here
[1:03:42] foretelling the angels are here
[1:03:45] foretelling then the critics they here
[1:03:48] you say third phase foretelling on the
[1:03:51] second phase charity is here they
[1:03:53] question you I've been through 32 years
[1:03:56] of his friends but not your friends who
[1:04:00] believe Brotherly Love holy decency
[1:04:04] placed in Christ who received you years
[1:04:08] ago brother Hunt brother fiori brother
[1:04:12] bomo and the and and and Sylvia colon
[1:04:16] and and the different ones that was here
[1:04:18] with me and all those people that they
[1:04:20] don't question me cuz they've been with
[1:04:22] me for
[1:04:23] years and they say a amen didn't you see
[1:04:27] brother Hunt I think Wednesday night I
[1:04:29] was speaking there he said he jumped up
[1:04:31] and said amen to the word amen see uh
[1:04:35] these are your friends and who received
[1:04:38] you years ago they don't have no
[1:04:39] questions they know I'm preaching the
[1:04:42] truth they stay with you till the
[1:04:46] end if they have a question about what
[1:04:49] you're saying they come to your face say
[1:04:54] brother Coleman you know I'm your friend
[1:04:57] I don't understand this third phase I
[1:04:59] don't understand the headstone I don't
[1:05:02] understand what you mean about charity
[1:05:04] now your friend will come to your face
[1:05:07] and tell your soul to your
[1:05:10] face then they challenge you it's what
[1:05:14] I've been through for 32 years uh
[1:05:17] looking for charity part of it I just
[1:05:20] told you it's disguised as virtue
[1:05:23] February 23rd not not not charity
[1:05:25] charity that came on uh March 2nd but
[1:05:29] that is to come I'm going to read it to
[1:05:31] you if you say Charities here they say
[1:05:34] speak to the Rock and I was told this I
[1:05:37] was told in 86 to go to the zoo and
[1:05:40] speak to the Bulls and the bees speak
[1:05:43] the word to the B right here for the
[1:05:45] bees and the Bulls but they don't
[1:05:48] understand the holy spirit is he has
[1:05:49] virtue to form the word in you that time
[1:05:53] is coming brother it's coming when
[1:05:56] you'll speak to The Rock when you'll
[1:05:59] speak to the squirrels But first you
[1:06:02] come like
[1:06:04] Jesus your brethren they don't
[1:06:07] understand virtue dunamis is to form the
[1:06:11] word so virtue is a hidden Mystery of
[1:06:15] the holy spirit is here right now what
[1:06:17] is it is here as the seal an angel to
[1:06:21] give us virtue to form the word image in
[1:06:23] you and after the word image Christ
[1:06:26] characters form in you on the message of
[1:06:29] Grace crying Grace Grace To The
[1:06:31] Headstone He he'll come again and
[1:06:33] restore back and rebuild the church in
[1:06:36] the power of the spirit in The Virtue on
[1:06:39] the Holy Spirit which is here now to
[1:06:41] rebuild the
[1:06:43] church you
[1:06:45] see then the Holy Spirit and that's
[1:06:48] phase one and that's what I've been
[1:06:50] under for 32 years but it's still
[1:06:53] charity but it's disguise is virtue
[1:06:56] now we on the third phase what are we
[1:06:58] looking for now charity as Charity now
[1:07:02] comes go to the zoo to the bulls and
[1:07:03] bees if he sends you then the holy
[1:07:06] spirit in phase two seals up your Seven
[1:07:11] Virtues for
[1:07:13] service changes your ministry and adopts
[1:07:16] you and places and vindicates you with
[1:07:19] Saint Mark 5:30 virtue leaving your body
[1:07:23] St Luke 619 680 and
[1:07:26] 8:46 like it did the prophet through
[1:07:29] three pulls the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:07:33] manifested God gave brother brandham the
[1:07:37] ministry of Jesus Christ in three PS to
[1:07:40] bring the headpone The Headstone and he
[1:07:43] went West he met The Headstone and seven
[1:07:46] angels and was picked up into the
[1:07:48] headstone and a voice spoke from them
[1:07:51] and said return back to Jeffersonville
[1:07:53] and open the Seven Seals he was adopted
[1:07:56] he already had the life because he had
[1:07:59] the ministry of Jesus Christ see now
[1:08:02] brother Brandon because Jesus was given
[1:08:04] the ministry of Jesus Christ himself St
[1:08:07] Luke 4 and he did that and he went for
[1:08:10] three years of hard trial trying trials
[1:08:14] for three and a half years there at
[1:08:17] least three years of hard ear trials and
[1:08:21] then he was taken up on a mountain and
[1:08:23] he was adopted
[1:08:25] but he but virtue came out of him the
[1:08:28] ministry of Jesus Christ in three polls
[1:08:30] he had it now brother brandom was given
[1:08:34] the ministry of Jesus Christ May 7th
[1:08:38] 1946 in three
[1:08:41] pulls and then he was adopt an angel
[1:08:44] came and seven angels came on the end
[1:08:47] and he was
[1:08:48] adopted so I hope you understand it but
[1:08:51] that's difference there's a difference
[1:08:52] between the prophet and the bride now
[1:08:55] here his the
[1:08:56] bride we don't get the ministry of Jesus
[1:08:58] Christ like that brother Ram was giving
[1:09:01] it but the Holy Spirit has to be here
[1:09:04] for us to be molded into this image and
[1:09:08] then we are given the Min of Jesus
[1:09:10] Christ to catch the headstone when we
[1:09:13] are adopted not before
[1:09:16] ministers so power without character is
[1:09:20] satanic so the Revelation laying up here
[1:09:24] is that on the third phase is that
[1:09:26] virtue is the outlet for the guide to
[1:09:30] begin the born again
[1:09:32] son spiritual
[1:09:34] experience and he will take you into a
[1:09:36] place of trying I've been telling you
[1:09:38] this for 30 some years trying tutor
[1:09:42] child train and the Holy Spirit himself
[1:09:45] is a tutor coming in as a guide with
[1:09:47] virtue and lead you all the way to
[1:09:50] charity and that would be charity as
[1:09:53] Charity the tremendous victory in love
[1:09:55] divine the Dynamics to our mechanics
[1:09:58] when charity is Charity but when charity
[1:10:01] is disguise as virtue is forming you
[1:10:03] into the word image and you pray for the
[1:10:06] sick and they get healed sometimes but
[1:10:08] when you are adopted you command the
[1:10:10] Devils to come out that's the
[1:10:12] difference so I've been trying to get
[1:10:14] this over to the
[1:10:16] church and the Holy Spirit him himself
[1:10:19] is a tutor coming as a guide with virtue
[1:10:21] and lead you all the way to charity the
[1:10:24] tremendous victory and the love divine
[1:10:26] the Dynamics to our mechanics Malachi
[1:10:29] for restored the prophetic Vision The
[1:10:31] Living Word in the bride to bring to
[1:10:34] pass the bride's Ministry in the love
[1:10:37] divine the bride's ministry will be an
[1:10:39] extension of the ministry of Jesus
[1:10:42] Christ the first Ministry was an
[1:10:44] extension was an extension an extension
[1:10:47] and the last Ministry would be an
[1:10:50] extension of the ministry of Jesus
[1:10:52] Christ as it was in the early bride and
[1:10:54] in Malachi 4 and so will it be in you so
[1:11:00] I hope that kind of gives you some
[1:11:02] understanding of uh the difference
[1:11:05] between the prophet and and giving the
[1:11:08] three pulls and then meeting seven
[1:11:10] angels and here we have to have virtue
[1:11:14] power come to us first then begin
[1:11:18] to give us the Holy Ghost and a
[1:11:20] refilling and then we got to add Seven
[1:11:22] Virtues and we got to be tested and and
[1:11:25] proven and when God can see the virtues
[1:11:29] being operated by the spirit which is on
[1:11:32] the third phase then he calls you out
[1:11:36] and then gives you something gives you a
[1:11:38] gift to shake the
[1:11:39] Nations so church I pray that you
[1:11:42] understand what I'm talking about amen
[1:11:45] so
[1:11:47] anyway to back this up on um the
[1:11:51] manifestation of the seven Liv
[1:11:54] voices uh um page
[1:11:57] 24 on page 24 you got your there I'll
[1:12:02] just quickly read
[1:12:03] it then the form me of the word image
[1:12:06] and there entered into the place of
[1:12:08] trying and you heard me keep telling you
[1:12:12] about part A I kept looking forward to
[1:12:15] it how could it be any worse than this
[1:12:17] December 31st
[1:12:19] 2003 he revealed to me I've already been
[1:12:21] in it for 20
[1:12:23] years and then I was greatly relieved
[1:12:26] and then I didn't know that I had to go
[1:12:27] another year and of course another year
[1:12:30] which was up to 2005 and then it was 21
[1:12:33] years and then when he told me he said
[1:12:36] now you're finished so go in there and
[1:12:40] bring this inspiration and I'm going to
[1:12:42] close off the second phase that's what
[1:12:45] I'm doing so when it begins to come
[1:12:46] forth you'll say Where's that guy doing
[1:12:49] all the hollering you know the second
[1:12:51] phase prophesying and so forth oh he
[1:12:54] gave that message for 21 years plus a
[1:12:57] couple of more or it to be so humble and
[1:13:00] simple if you don't have the token to
[1:13:02] examine it you won't know what it is I
[1:13:04] thought you were supposed to do this and
[1:13:06] that or that well they thought the same
[1:13:09] thing about brother brandom jeffson
[1:13:11] Ville and Tucson they thought the same
[1:13:13] thing and they didn't see what they
[1:13:15] thought was supposed to be uh supposed
[1:13:18] to see and meanwhile what they saw was
[1:13:21] what God Said So now you got it so it
[1:13:25] had to be birthed I explain that to you
[1:13:27] tested from
[1:13:30] 1975 to 1983 it was tested and then it
[1:13:34] come out of the Wilderness and then uh
[1:13:36] the breaking of the seventh seal uh July
[1:13:41] 1983 the seal broke under there and
[1:13:44] outpoured the Holy Spirit for birth in
[1:13:47] Fort Wayne and came back to New York and
[1:13:49] spread all the way over to South Africa
[1:13:52] and it finished up for a birth in 1984 I
[1:13:55] started into my harder trials so now you
[1:13:59] got it now so it had to be birthed
[1:14:02] tested and then had to be proven the
[1:14:05] last 21 plus years to be in there all
[1:14:10] and to to be in there I got to have
[1:14:12] these virtues in here proven by all
[1:14:16] kinds of
[1:14:17] tests trials everything else that's what
[1:14:20] I've been through especially this year
[1:14:23] you may be seated so there for three in
[1:14:26] one I had three uh now I had three birth
[1:14:30] tested proven now you're going to get
[1:14:33] three and one now you get three in
[1:14:36] one now I'm no more a signed because
[1:14:39] I've been through that and I thank God
[1:14:42] he told me he said you're just on the
[1:14:44] third phase and whoever comes to
[1:14:46] maturity first they will be adopted so
[1:14:49] we all at the starting point as of today
[1:14:52] and this is
[1:14:53] 2004 that's that's right so I'm just
[1:14:56] kind of talking to you by the wayside so
[1:14:58] we're all here together and I finished
[1:15:00] my signs he said you're on the third
[1:15:03] phase there's no part A no Part B third
[1:15:07] phase place in Christ adoption time go
[1:15:10] to the angel of the Lord I told you that
[1:15:13] that the um that the voice Angel was
[1:15:16] leaving Revelation 10 8-11 and he was
[1:15:19] coming over to Ephesians 4: 11-13 and
[1:15:23] that took six years from uh September 6
[1:15:26] of 2000 all the way to June of
[1:15:30] 2006 took six
[1:15:32] years so go to the angel of the Lord
[1:15:36] because he wants to put a liquor fire in
[1:15:38] there you got it birth testing then
[1:15:41] proven that it's in there before he can
[1:15:44] come upon you he cannot unless you see
[1:15:47] in he see it in there and that's got to
[1:15:50] be through the place of trying and now
[1:15:52] that finishes off all these ministers
[1:15:54] talking about
[1:15:55] uh I'm a five-fold minister according to
[1:15:57] Ephesians 4:11 through 13 no you're not
[1:16:00] neither you be a five-fold minister
[1:16:02] according with the prophet said that's
[1:16:04] how you'll be now on page 31 uh here's a
[1:16:08] secret I just finished showing
[1:16:10] you I just finished showing you the
[1:16:13] secret the word is in the bride logos
[1:16:17] and the mind of Christ Elohim to know
[1:16:19] what he wants done with the word and she
[1:16:21] does it in his name she has thus sayeth
[1:16:24] the Lord that is the secret the logos
[1:16:27] and Elohim together by the grace of God
[1:16:30] by the revelation of seven Thunders the
[1:16:32] Holy Spirit got the logos the word into
[1:16:36] New York and Pa and all our friends on
[1:16:39] the internet and whoever else that's the
[1:16:42] secret and now Elohim is here the Locos
[1:16:46] is in you Elohim the seven spirits is
[1:16:48] here now you got it the word logos is in
[1:16:52] the bride and the mind of Elohim
[1:16:55] intelligence of
[1:16:57] Christ uh to know what he wants done
[1:16:59] with the word and she does it in his
[1:17:01] name she has thus sayth the Lord and I
[1:17:04] have something about
[1:17:07] intelligence now and ask what you will
[1:17:09] March 2nd
[1:17:11] 1975 I told you that the spirit of
[1:17:13] knowledge Came Upon Me in St Martin 19
[1:17:16] in January 75 and on that tape that
[1:17:20] message page 22 I said these words let
[1:17:23] the mind that was in Christ being in
[1:17:26] you the intelligence that will come down
[1:17:30] at a little later date and I'm speaking
[1:17:32] about it right here on the third phase
[1:17:35] as the voice of the
[1:17:36] Archangel but is here now quickened as
[1:17:41] knowledge to New York City on St Martin
[1:17:45] and that's when it come and and was
[1:17:47] charity disguised as
[1:17:49] virtue and that's what happened the
[1:17:51] church so I couldn't have that then
[1:17:54] understand now why why I had to go why
[1:17:56] go to St John why go to St Thomas didn't
[1:18:00] go to St cro I thought I had to go to St
[1:18:02] Croy which would be the cross Ministry
[1:18:05] God sent St cro here this morning I know
[1:18:07] what it means Mrs Munos Jesus Christ
[1:18:10] brought you here this morning Mrs Muno
[1:18:12] you were down in St Croy I was wanting
[1:18:14] to go my wife will tell you I said I
[1:18:17] should go to St Croy that's the third
[1:18:19] step the cross Ministry that's the cross
[1:18:22] Ministry of Jesus Christ said no you go
[1:18:26] to St Martin get some knowledge first
[1:18:30] and I got it and it came and that was
[1:18:33] manifested during the 32 years then I'll
[1:18:36] send to rightly divide the word then
[1:18:38] I'll send St Croy in here our healer our
[1:18:41] Savor to prove to New York City I'm the
[1:18:44] same yesterday today and
[1:18:45] forever so there we
[1:18:48] are so there's your acts 5:12 through 16
[1:18:54] heal and Peter Shadow St John 14:12
[1:18:58] other words knowledge now will come over
[1:19:01] to intelligence because knowledge has
[1:19:04] found all the promises the quotes that
[1:19:08] that was my that's my ministry that's
[1:19:10] finished with now and and now Michael is
[1:19:13] here as the intelligence and I will just
[1:19:17] explain to you on time is
[1:19:18] short um heel and Peter Shadow St John
[1:19:23] 14:12 St Mark 16 Bride In Action as an
[1:19:27] adopted spoken word bride Revelation
[1:19:30] 22:17 the spirit and the bride said come
[1:19:33] Christ the voice of the Archangel veiled
[1:19:36] in her flesh 1 Thessalonians 4:16 three
[1:19:40] things shout appearing voice appearing
[1:19:43] Trump
[1:19:45] coming Christ Ministry Ephesians 4:
[1:19:48] 11-13 will bring the bride to Perfection
[1:19:51] a perfect man Elohim and seven spirits
[1:19:55] back into the bride will be the
[1:19:57] manifestation of the seven Living Voices
[1:19:59] a reflection of the seven spirits of
[1:20:02] Elohim as seven Living Voices and Omega
[1:20:06] bride the reflection will be the
[1:20:08] perfection even the ministry of the
[1:20:10] Morning Star which is given to the
[1:20:13] Overcomer on the third phase in their
[1:20:16] place of trying overcome then they
[1:20:19] adopted and position place so I hope
[1:20:22] it's clear to you church about this
[1:20:23] third phases whole thing here so
[1:20:26] anyway so the third phase is connected
[1:20:29] to the third pole the opening of the
[1:20:31] word the Mysteries revealed third phase
[1:20:35] now in the third phase charity can now
[1:20:38] fall as Charity for
[1:20:43] adoption and on adoption book page
[1:20:47] [Applause]
[1:20:48] 89 you heard it before paragraph 159 is
[1:20:53] that right waiting God trying to place
[1:20:55] his church in position to manifest
[1:20:58] himself God trying to place his church
[1:21:00] in position to manifest himself getting
[1:21:03] one that he can work through like this
[1:21:05] say there's my spirit flowing freely
[1:21:08] there it is I can work here get another
[1:21:11] one over here and place him I can place
[1:21:13] him adoption placing manifesting take
[1:21:17] him out here and put a ceremony on him
[1:21:18] visit him with an angel tell him
[1:21:20] something now if he's told the truth now
[1:21:22] if he's just making some making up some
[1:21:25] old interpretation or something it won't
[1:21:27] work no no no that won't work so friends
[1:21:30] my revelation will not work on the third
[1:21:32] phase if it's not the truth if it's the
[1:21:36] truth well then it will work on the
[1:21:38] third phase so therefore nobody needs to
[1:21:41] come behind me and try to clear it up
[1:21:44] there is nothing to clear up it's been
[1:21:48] spoken as an
[1:21:50] echo so therefore and if it if it's not
[1:21:53] the echo then God will not adopt me and
[1:21:56] will not bless me in nothing but if I
[1:21:58] told the truth well then I I I'll get
[1:22:02] blessed take him out here and put a
[1:22:04] cemon on him and visit with an angel
[1:22:06] tell him something okay um because that
[1:22:09] won't work making up something we had a
[1:22:11] lot of that but I I mean manifestations
[1:22:15] plural of sons of God when God manifests
[1:22:18] himself and sends them out then he goes
[1:22:21] forth and what he says is truth what he
[1:22:23] does is the truth truth what he does he
[1:22:26] manifests Christ that's how in Ephesians
[1:22:29] 4:1 through uh 16 uh that the adopted
[1:22:33] son comes forth speaking the truth in
[1:22:37] love how do you judge him by the way he
[1:22:40] stays with the word right with the word
[1:22:43] now either I have rightly divided the
[1:22:45] word for the first and second phase all
[1:22:48] the way for 40 years since the Joseph
[1:22:51] Perfection or I have not rightly divide
[1:22:54] the word and if I have rightly divide
[1:22:57] the word there's no Minister there's
[1:22:59] nobody can come behind me and say that
[1:23:03] they want to make clear what I'm
[1:23:06] saying that's I mean that's Insanity
[1:23:09] because the word was rightly
[1:23:11] divided so how do you judge
[1:23:14] him uh what he says is truth what he
[1:23:17] does he manifests Christ by the way he
[1:23:20] stays with the word right with the word
[1:23:22] that's how you know all man is by the
[1:23:24] way stay with the word they speak not
[1:23:26] according to the word there's no life in
[1:23:28] them says the Bible so now we see the
[1:23:31] seventh Thunder inspiration is in two
[1:23:33] parts if by Revelation number one and
[1:23:37] then second phase and third phase
[1:23:39] manifestation and if I sold the right
[1:23:42] seeds by Revelation in the second phase
[1:23:45] well then there will be a manifestation
[1:23:47] of the seven Thunder Revival in New York
[1:23:50] city so praise God so there we are so
[1:23:54] now I would like to share with you the
[1:23:57] manifestations of the three phases as a
[1:23:59] sign and I'm going to uh I'm finishing
[1:24:03] up here and I'm going have a have
[1:24:06] another part of the tape where um I'm
[1:24:09] going to put on the following uh
[1:24:11] inspiration December 7

[1:24:49] testimony and and the testimony of Jesus
[1:24:52] is the spirit of Prophecy so friends I'm

[1:26:34] menaces that don't don't understand
[1:26:36] nothing already opening the shouting
[1:26:39] message but veil in the word to give to

[1:44:02] interested in what that brother believes
[1:44:03] as to believe in Malachi 4 that's the
[1:44:06] the beginning there do he believe that
