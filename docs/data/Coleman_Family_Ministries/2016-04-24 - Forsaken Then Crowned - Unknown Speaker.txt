========================================
does remain standing awful word of Prayer Heavenly Father we thank you truly today to be found in the house once again to offer praises unto thee and to assemble ourselves together as the Word of God exalts us to in this day and to come with open hearts cleanse bodies and minds and souls to know that we serve Living God he's risen he's he's in our hearts and we know because you have called us forth from this filth here in this world thou art keeping us alive in Christ Jesus and though we move about here Lord against the wiles of the enemy we stagger not through unbelief but we are strong giving praise to God we can do all things through Christ Jesus to strengthen us so father this morning may you give heart to the faint this morning lift up the feeble arms and legs this morning heal the sick and the brokenhearted stretch forth that goodness and that mercy Lord and God that people has gathered here this morning not to hear from me but all God to hear from the Living God for you said if your people would assemble that you would pour out the water the waters of eternal life and Lord may thy word flow this morning may rivers of living water flow into that people this morning Lord in God may they be able to say that our hearts burning within us as just come down and speak to us by the wayside this morning Lord God brings such a faith in here Lord God that we would be able to go forth from here Lord conquering every devil talking of a disease conquered everything overcome against the seeds of God father sin that presses out to those who could not be here this morning that's my family Lord that are waiting on the coming of the Lord and all of those will gathered around waiting on the coming of the Lord blessed the strangers indicates the small in God and be with that people this morning and come and feed us by the wayside but we pray we asked it in Jesus name and for his glory amen you may be seated we're certainly happy to be here this morning to offer up spiritual praises unto the Lord and it is good to say it we often praises to the Lord well this is the hour and the devil's trying to get us to offer praises to him this is the hour when the Devils are trying to make us bow down to his gods to worship His image but we are like the three Hebrew boys we are persuaded we shall not do it whether we live or die amen will not give in while God is able to keep us here take us through the fiery trial and our clothes won't be burned it won't smell it the kalaiy fire Amen here bring us true smell like a rose or crushed rose praise the Lord we're so happy to be able to give a testimony this morning though we stand in this pest house we know that everybody here is sick amen and the enemy seemed like he's just had a extra time on the little children the past two a few weeks months I saw all the different little ones babies and so far they all sick had been smoked by the enemy and sister komen she told me to send her twigs morning as she's still seen amen and though the enemy's got her down but she still got a praise for others she wishes because she was here this morning but has just been one thing after another since October for Joanne I think it's because that's going around about three times now and Joanne she come down again just the other day Friday I think it was 103 so we just don't know we just keep moving and I was able by God's grace to go through the whole past three months and just Friday I picked up a virus and a habit announced or throat so you pray for me this morning but that's the way it is and so we know that this is a pest house and it's full of sickness and corruption but he promised us amen that we'll have a body like his body if we should die right now just very moment a man will pass into another body there's what a tabernacle already waiting but he put us in here for his glory and don't worry he's coming amen for he promised we can hear the old buckboard coming down the road right now amen it's the coming praise the Lord because he has already descended it on his way down he sent down the shout first he's still coming down amen praise the Lord so we're happy this morning to give a testimony that God and we will certainly have sorry to hear about brother and sister Roble does little daunted Emory's because she had pneumonia but she's doing okay now and so we continue to pray for her and all the other little ones at the enemy has smoke it's all for purpose and so we know as we stay in God's will because your show is why but if we suffer with him we shall reign with him and Paul wanted to know the Fellowship of his suffering and I believe that Oh because all Christians in this hour we have to fellowship with him and his sufferings be baptized immersed into his sufferings and then we'll understand see and then we shall reign with him see so we just have to go through with this and so now we're approaching a tremendous time and I just thought that Salwa now I was able to get a little time from the job and I'm very tired my mind is tired and you know you don't know what it is to come here suddenly morning into face and knowing that wherever the word going forth to the light the devil all the demons gather right there to stamp it out and it just takes away everything your mind your strength everything and so I'm going to take a little rest and I always try to say that always say that but I never stopped preaching but I have been led to stop preaching for the next month or so so therefore this is the last time I believe unless the Lord should change it be here for a while and Brotherhood he'll be here brother Kurt but I'll just be trying to rest my mind see so therefore I thought though in doing so that I would get a chance this morning to get in a few licks Amen see because I still being training now see but right now get a chance to drop in a few licks to the enemy because we've got to know where we're standing in and what is going on and we know all across the land and around the world that many people's hearts are stirred and they all feel as something is fixing to happen this year and even I was noticing if you'd been noticing how President Nixon the many spiritual things which he's saying call about the Word of God and so forth last shall be first first shall be last and then he made that tremendous point in his inauguration speech that if we will stop shouting and listen to the words of the voices and seemed to strike everybody and that's just what it is going on spiritually also the people because the message been screaming at Harland by the scissors because it says that but they would just hold still and listen to the still small voice then they'll know what he said hey man so because you know it was elijah guard up on Mount Horeb there was giving you a type that when our Elijah would come it wouldn't be the fire the earthquake the whirlwind it beat a still small voice because he uses because the fire thing also because Elijah did all kinds of things to see call down fire and also kill the fallen the prophets and so forth because God uses that also but in his season so what he was doing was trying to drop in the fact that there would be a still small voice that would come to us way in the in turn and he dropped it in there for type and so therefore there's still those who are looking for the fire there in quake in the world winds and so forth but the still small voice have has come which is Christ and so a John picked it up because he'd because do any miracles at all justice just a voice the Word of God repent there's the voice of God and so that is God's purpose that that's why he took them up on the mountain Mount Transfiguration and the Elijah came back to witness that it was to be the still small voice but God said hear ye in him hear him the voice the word of God and so Elijah saw that that come to pass and here we are now and everybody though God even brought it back and tight because those three things struck brother branham's ministry also the fire the whirlwind and the earthquake and so but when you come off that mountain out in Arizona everybody came in February to hear the still small voice that's what you wanted to hear so therefore those who are hearing it you're blessed today and God is moving you on and like I was saying so many people are waiting for different things and they all are looking forward to something happening here in April 69 it's a note was a spiritual month and I was just thinking how how Israel took the Passover a way back in April and it Quebec in Egypt and how they they cross the Jordan April and Christ was born in April and the resurrection was in April and 1906 April the Pentecostal blessing was poured out and 1909 God's prophet he was born in April and all these spiritual things happen April I guess I suppose the people are wondering what is going to take place this April and we see what is happening to California the lands just getting loose there and just getting right for God's judgments and we know that something is fixing the half that we know whether it'll be the resurrection come forth we don't know we can't say and many are looking for all kind of things in the resurrection so we're looking for Jesus Christ and I thought it was startling that knowing that in his judgment he comes with earthquakes because back in Zechariah I think there was about Mount Olivet because it would cleave when he would come back the second time but if you notice it if you read in there good it doesn't say that because it had to be earthquake there it just said that the land would be split see so the earthquake in itself could be somewhere else so but because they're noticing that I noticed that when the earthquake did come that dumb on the Good Friday of March 64 that there was an earthquake and that was on on Good Friday and now we are looking the people looking for something happened this time on Easter and on the Good Friday when that earthquake was before soon it was the earthquake the veil rent and who they thought because though was behind the veil because was not behind the veil he was out on the cross and Good Friday 64 the veil rent and then right behind that in June 14th the unveiling of the mighty God hope your kids praise the Lord so therefore just God knows what he's doing exactly and so we don't know what could be this Easter where there has to be anything that's east or not but one thing we know that's something it's fixing to happen and what we want to do is to be prepared and to be ready and God has he can give us nothing greater than to prepare us than his word the sword so it is with that that we turn to the Word of God this morning let us turn to 2nd Timothy the first chapter we read the 13th and the 15th verses hope everybody's feeling fine this morning hope we have up the shades let the sunlight come in amen and whatever having home would have happened on the road on the subway on the bus leave it there yeah amen we're here to worship the Lord now leave all those things outside praise the Lord that was yesterday for getting a thing that I'm behind praise God Ephesians 6 chapter 10th verse through the seventeenth verse Philippians the fourth chapter of the 13th first I'd like to title this forsaken then crowned forsaken then crowned holdfast the form of sound words which thou has heard of me in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us this town knows that all they which are in Asia be turn away from me of whom are of fie jealous and her Hermogenes and Ephesians the sixth chapter 10 verse finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand have it done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace of all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked take the helmet of salvation the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God Philippians 4:13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me a lawyer blessing to read of this word like I said I like to title this forsaken name crown now we know what the word four-second means abandoned desolate for long to leave because to renounce and I was hearing a message the other day you're trying always to find out what is going on where are you and see I was hearing the message of the Prophet present stage of my ministry and there he was making a statement in and stuck at my heart I thought I would just come here this morning and this let the Lord elaborate on what he said there because it's the Word of God he said when a man stays true to the word not just in one meeting every meeting when a man stands true to word the time will come when they will leave him they'll leave him or her or whoever they are when he stands for the truth they did it to the Lord they did it so from Noah all the way through they will leave you when you stand with the word they did it to Paul here and that's what this is about Dimas and these men here all in Asia see they do that because he God does that it comes a time when he separates in the church see and they think that you washed up when men begin to leave you when men begin to talk against and so forth walk out of the church and so forth and people begin to get cold and so forth and don't want to praise God I said what is all washed up begin to call you a denomination and so forth you all washed up see this has proven through all through the Bible no matter how popular because you may have been and no matter how much you have tried to do and how much they have seen God blessing you see but God said in the Bible there's got to come a time when the spiritual ones who stand with that word hold true to it they will forsake you they will walk away from see and so brother Brown was saying that you've got to hit that place for everybody hit it in the Bible all the heroes of faith hit that spot and you've got to hit it you can't bypass it see it's a lion vanity if you think that you can because because go around it uh-huh you must face it so therefore you might as well put on the helmet of salvation amen you might as well begin to gird yourself up with the breastplate of armour amen and your lawn is Girt with truth amen you might as well put up the shield of faith and take the sword of the Spirit in your hand we can do some good amen well he said it in the seals there when that that little group that can handle the Word of God put it in their hand they'll be able to slice and cut and stop everything whatever they wanted to stop nature amen see so is usually such a time when man or the Minister of the people have stayed true to the word and all man has has because forsaking him that God steps in in their defence amen see so just like the song they that wait upon the Lord amen they shall mount up with wings as Eagles they shall walk and not faint they shall run and not get weary they that wait upon the Lord are you waiting upon the Lord Amen well God has spoken this is going to happen for he has said so and just a few types there nor stay true to what God said is going to rain and the world system says it's not going to rain because there there never has been any rain science said so but he stayed true to that message and they are all walked away from him except those ordained to life and then when they had because he stayed true to the word they all forsook him then God came down in his defense and crowned him with her ride in the ark over the judgments Amen praise the Lord just like because Moses the same thing ever Israel has seen all the plagues did the supernatural and so forth and God got him into a spot like right now see failure on one side there is he on the other side and then Israel so why did you bring us here we should have stayed back there and dad back there they forsook Moses he said why crying and he's speaking move forward then God crowned him took him right on through amen so therefore we reach that time ourselves Daniel was also because forsaken and throwing into the lion's den that right and when he was all forsaken stay true to the Word of God he would not worship those gods down there and and they sent out a Supreme Court because a decree that you can't pray in a more public schools and so forth but he just bust the window open and well and because prayed anyway amen praise the Lord wake up now amen so therefore he stayed true to the word and then they took him into the lion's den that's just where God wanted him to prove that he's a god that can deliver Amen he gets you in there into the den somewhere where all the world forsake you and laugh at you mix sport with you like like Samson and then God comes on the scene we feel right now that we entered in in the fire amen and a greater reader out there and they make your sport there laughing where is your God you believe this message back in 63 back there where is it this God that he's there listen to everything is saying and he is going to deliver but he wants all man to forsake you first he wants you to go through something first the fiery trial and then he could come on the scene and deliver you praise the Lord so we see then that God crowned Daniel also changed the king's heart and said that this is the God that can deliver and we see it in that Jesus Christ he embraced his cross he was forsaken and God crowned him on Easter morning and when he rose from the dead hey man and we see right on down and we come down here to our our brother branham as we saw him and here he was back in his second pull here and all had forsaken him when he went forward in his first pull they all loved him popular wonderful see humble like Christ but when he began to prophesy and come down on that word they begin to leave just like you said see and as he stood did it they thought he was all washed up like he said big he was washed in sea he was washed in and then God crowned him with the third Pole the Word of God and brother Brown made this quote I hope he'll crown my ministry with this by letting me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride and the clothes of the word and for his righteousness I hope your crown me and let me stand there on that day and say behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world amen and he did he took the word the seven sealed message and called the bride with the word and all the bright had to do was to take off that old filthy ray from her old church amen come out of the world and then step in to this and through this clothing there just because put it on put on that garment amen see so therefore today we say like Paul here hold fast to the form of sound words the outline the pattern which you have heard and we heard God's prophet bring us to fall out of here he brought a message it had a pattern an outline it was Seventh Seal vision and by revelation we saw it and he says to keep that good thing because Paul gave two charges to Timothy here he charged him to hold the floor hold a pattern stay right with it and to keep that good thing the gospel the Word of God and we have the same charge well he said that in the end time like it was it in the beginning the bride would be given a charge the word Eve had to say in charge but she fell but he said that he would have a bride and she will not fall she will hold to the Word of God so we see then that what about this bride today now the bride today just like Eve was given that good thing to fortify herself with against Satan because God knew that he was going to face Satan saying and she failed the test amen now we were told that we are going to come face-to-face with the devil amen see and he laid out for us to his prophet he step along the way each one here are going to face Satan face to face see and he told that he fortified us with his word Eve had the same thing you know she had a word of God see and he gave us the pattern to form the seventh seal message say it says just take it to where it is for God knew knew that somewhere along the line that the enemy would step up his attack until it comes right on down to the strong delusion but he has because increased his attack now the enemy this morning does not want me to say this I know that but like I said imma get in a few licks by the grace of God amen so therefore don't be fearful for God has not given you a spirit fear he's giving you a spirit of power of love of a sound man amen for this Devils that want to hold you they want to make you bow down to a man that's nice see you can't see you I just read it to hear you you cannot see these things in C is two hundred thousand thousand demons out there you cannot see them the only thing that you can do is to pray Lord lead me lead me through this way here you can't see out at all but your understanding on the inside has eyes the Holy Ghost the Word of God and those eyes is anointed when I say that it may see that it may know which because way to go so now the bride knows she will face Satan face to face she knows that she is in a conflict now the bride knows by revelation right now she is defeating the devil by the Word of God she knows that and she is marching on to victory amen though in this pest house don't knock down the so forth she's still marching over she knows that now she knows she is in a contest which is a test of strength a tug-of-war on one side is the demons pulling you into his fire amen on the other side is the bride pulling this way and right now he's going this way like this here you see it's going back and forth amen now if somebody back here misses the word in there you fall down see them in now so hold still stand amen just hold on to that loop and pull it see but you won't have to use your own strength though because we're going to show you why see now the great conflict started up in heaven when Satan or what's kicked out then because he was kicked out he became the the enemy of God's people and he has strength short of God's strength just remember that now see and therefore it is his purpose to pull every one of us into his fire but he can't do it see but there's got to be a battle and we end it now and he but this time is deception amen see so narrow the word was the best thing that's what that good thing see the best thing that God could give his people - because combat Satan now watch the word is God nobody is stronger than God all right and the word is God see and the word becomes our strength amen God then is in his church and he becomes the church's strength for he's the word first it was a part of the word justification sanctification the gifts but then he come down himself in the shell the word and then the shell is the strength that's pulling the rope you follow me now see therefore God is in his bride now with strength confirming her whole is still to the day of Christ and she know that and because now what she knows that only as she believes the word not try to figure it out but just believe it that's her strength see there's your strength believe the word is your strength now that's because simple but that's what it is see to me now so now the tug goes on any man and now the word has come and watch the main bout is going to come up soon see this is only the preliminary the main ballot will be the world consul versus the bride in a battle amen but God has already tipped us off when an hour comes watch the third pull what's the knockout blow at that time but until that time comes fortify yourself train know your enemy amen see that's right see now study about a man see train for this great contest just like fight us see now or when a fight in the natural is training he wants to know his opponents strength so what does he do he studies on film if he has them or all his weaknesses and all his strong points whether he has a strong jab or left hook or Red Cross or uppercut he studies the whole thing out see and he watches his footwork because even some old-time fighters there was a fella I knew because hurricane Jake because he could just because fight with his head down and just watch your feet and he could tell by your feet what you were getting ready to do and then he'd hit you saying so that's right see you man now that's why our feet are to be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and you can watch a man's feet to see where he's going at you know what he's doing amen you can watch his feet see see if they go into because shady places and you know what kind of fight he gonna make amen pray in the war so now the fighters study out their opponents all right but the whole thing that they are training for a knockout blow see now while we are studying our opponent the enemy is studying our strategy also here come the enemy studies our strategy with the word he study us he studies us out as we come to the Lord John 3:16 or acts 2:38 and he watches see he watches if we stay with that word or if we reason affection memory he knows how to get you in in I hope you got that he knows just he's studying you out he just watching you watching your life in the home on the job wherever you are the enemy is watching you he knows just where to punch you out it yes sir amen see he studies out the ministers because you want to get them first see what kind of life they got see if they go for popularity see if they go for women see if they did they'd go for money he knows gifs with a halo bet when they come down the road and he'd knock him out every time see he studied out the brothers in the church to see if they're jealous humble brotherly kindness see if they're puffed up one or a preacher so forth and so on follow me now he stays them all out to see where they're going now you don't want to say he stay after women see what to see what they do it see if they love the fashions of the world see if they want to because cut to hear all these things they studying them out see if they're lusting after because someone else's husband studied them out then he knows that he can use that nature down the line somewhere he can use it see oh yes a man that he know what this said you know now I'm only taught about fighters amen praise the Lord so he studies out the church to see who he can catch off guard to see who's weak in there and he could send her a adoption through there see a window I could catch him see me now he got him all figured out because God's gonna use him to shake him loose they're still because too many farmers shake him loose see and so what they're deprived knows that she's fortified with the word where you go I'm going with the word Amen see me now so now we see there's Satan studies out the church Satan studying out Adam and Eve as you walk to the garden he wants them day in and day out he watched him he watched him he wants them did he finally a concluded that Adam was the seed of the word because he couldn't get him then he figured that well Eve is part of the word I can get her just like today Eve is the shook he can get her but the bride today not like a then she is the word for she's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit but on his blood life of his life she is the word and Satan cannot get her and he knows it too and she knows that he knows it that's why she walks out there with the word and stands there and chops those Devils down now she will be forsaken for taking that stand oh oh yes praise the Lord and they'll leave her they will first take her for taking that stand against the enemy but she knows where she's going biron by amen by and by we want to take a chariot ride amen praise the Lord I asked her not right so now he knew hard to get to Eve with the best strategy that he can use on her and that was to reason with the word he got it see Rees with the word because the spirit of the of God is deceit and because on the inside inside out here in the mind is faith comes out here see and then either it's faith here moving this body by the word coming because coming to come into the mind or is reason one of the other and if what in he knows that so he come in reason with Eve so Eve hit him with the word she said God has said that we should not eat from there he's but in he reasoned he said we know that God has said that therefore he preached see but see God knows that this way you know how to bring life see oh then I can go out west you mean and do it quicker I don't have to because I go to the cross and die I can live in the flesh you make sure you can just wait for this natural thing be fine you mean otherwise if I us because start abstinence because I can do it yeah sure you can that's the way to do it any other way to do it see something that you can do see when he's already done it just believe it there's nothing that you can do but believe on him that's in the Word of God and hold to it that's all you can do that's all he wants you to do it amen see so now never reason with the word just believe it don't try to explain it don't try to figure it out see you cannot figure out God when you believe it that is your sprint that it that's just fits right there that's gone right there in you and the devil sees it because you believe hope you see that when you believe it that their own eyes you believe it and he backs off see me now but he come again with a different trial next day see in the tug of war every day so now as we were saying we collect in training you study all the moves shadowboxing body punches all these things but then you get a sparring partner that right and you get the best spot important that's just like your just like him have all his moves then right so therefore the best byproduct that God could get today for us with false christs for the false Christ has all of Satan's moves he's smart he's slick he's cunning he's so sincere he's handsome and sweet and he got a nice gimmick for you sending right now so therefore we go into the false Christ time and then we begin to spar with him and when we watch him we watch him we punch him and so forth we watch we watch and that's what we've been doing now past few years hitting those false christs here hit them over there hit them over there follow me now see because see he's the closest thing to him Satan that's his emissary following in our friends so therefore we are in training now right now and we're aspiring see so now the enemy studies out our strategy so the false christ move in trying to feint and bob and weave and hook and jab and move across see and we just you know say can we have been because trained well and week because counter him amen because counters punches see now we are standing right now and we and we have been in a battle right now and having an oil stand staying anyway because it's coming a great battle see this great main bout the world council against the brass it's coming up amen so we've been sparring here with these Antichrist and nothing I'm not left and right may sparring partners not with to the ropes Amen praise Allah so now God promised that the manifested sons would come back and take the kingdom back our inheritance is sonship then right eat with this eternal life we are to be over this domain here joint heirs with Christ was got to be in the fullness of time when the sons of God to men offense and they come back and take back the kingdom at the main belt the spoken word is our knockout blow when the time comes there's a a real crises coming and the bride won't be in that place see watch now where he can use that body and fight his fight follow me now friends praise the Lord okay now Christ then we'll use our bodies that's well trained that has eliminated all the waste and so forth train down fire and when you're in training because you sure won back in the city aim anything and so he'll use our bodies to borrow - we've to faint in in this main belt but now just our bodies now see that's well trained he'll be the head amen and his head will tell this body when the bow hey when the faint when the jab and when the hook finally now hit the head will it'll be in the rain but we'll have his head our body and it he'll move this body into position for the knockout blow Amen praise the Lord he'll do it though well he knows the enemy's weakness and when the enemy come in with his knockout blow strong delusion see to me now before he can throw it send me now the bread will knock him into yesterday praise Allah I love it prays alone probably no but it's just a matter of hard rigid training you gotta suffer in training you can't lean around like this fellow they hit me did I eat all kind of things and so forth this is a big cut because I got his named this middleweight fighter because he lost he ate all kind of food up here in because um the boys got up here and he had all kind of things up here see and then when he got into the fight he lost the battle sing so now but the bride she won't do that she's training now fine she's going that she's in trim she said great shape right now but because lady because she don't think so but he knows he is see it's contrary to the fresh seeing there now you feel terrible he knows you're right on the dot he knows you're almost ready for the main bout when all the lights come on the crowd is there yelling and waiting for the kill amen their power she'll come down the arm should take off a roll and walk out in face Satan amen face to face he'll know where she got there so you know but that's a spoken word the mana they'll take back the kingdom and knock Satan into yesterday amen praise the Lord so now when Satan is ready with all of his powers sighs lying wonders ready to deceive all with a strong delusion our head knows exactly when he's ready to do that and at third our much to third all there you wantyou them saying but make sure when you're watching it that it'll work through you just don't stand looking to see it over there somewhere yeah make sure it is God working through you yeah amen praise the Lord so now then when Satan is ready with an iron wonders strong delusion to deceive all a short turn ready in this is a short hour like the big headway fighters to fight me last around knocking out right away see me now gonna be a short knock out one round that's all this will be sending me down well God knows that that's the hour when he will maneuver his body into position for the D of the could knock out blow she will be placed in position to throw the knockout blow at that time see because not before now then we will be in our place to meet the crises of the hour so now we go with faith to handle the Word of God now watch because right now you'll stink true to the word you are forsaken you feel like everybody left you cast down that's exactly all through the Bible that's just just the way it was should it be any different because for us shall we go in on a flowerbed of these let's see God has a far greater purpose because for you see back in Paul's time and all the all the curly Christians their greatest desire their greatest joy was to die a martyr see yeah that's exactly right because Paul wanted to a Peter want to be because crucified upside down cut it because it wasn't worthy see they all wanted to march into that arena and die or modest death and they shout it and scream and saying to the Lord as they stood there under the power of God and gave because their lives that had to be because the corn wheat had to go in the ground but this time the greatest desire the greatest joy for the bride today just to come through these past years hole into the Word of Life being that beacon that was turning it out with the word that has not because defied herself with that word see me now and she'll stand there and be crowned in his glory at the end time because there's got to be a bride that will stain on this earth and be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that's our design that's our reward to staying here on the earth here and to face the enemy with this knockout blow that's for now back there was different see so now the bride now knows that she needs the more strength see some rapture and strength to because take her out of here so therefore she's only waiting for the sound of the Russian of the wind and top of the mulberry tree when he says go out and he goes out before then you go out until then you wait you train you move you die off to the flesh you're waiting but you know when he says move out you move out amen yes sir see so while we're waiting for the sound of the voice in the top of the tree we pressed about we stand to the Word of God amen now the bride that stays true to the word housewife' all young men missus whoever you are see if you have added the clothes of the word to your faith see if you have put on these clothes and add to your faith virtue and pacing all these things in sea and then we know because we are individual pyramids that write all of us is a pyramid and is seven steps in a pyramid therefore we're waiting for God to cap off our life the pyramid each one of us he is to come and be our head cap it off amen praise the Lord see so now is when we are forsaken at this hour now when men walk away from you curse you say all manner of evil about you the bride rejoices for she knows he's reached the hour amen when she's ready to be crowned when that time comes and we're in that all right now see me now there's something fixin to happen and that's when he will crown your life with the glory of the word here's the word but is full of glory from one glory to another glory amen and we waited for the fullness of his glory to come and Crown our lives whip that glory amen see now because in closing praise the Lord now remember there will be a nightmare going on at this time see now you may say well why are you so zealous to always lay on that way and keep rebuking and reproving and correct with all longsuffering well I thought about the other day I taught them to customer white house now look at this that's is the this terrible condition that we in here if brother Branham didn't spin out there on the word and didn't listen to those popularity Devils don't priests just don't say that see them in there and didn't tell us about the women and all these things in the ministers in the false Christ if he didn't do it where would we be today so far be it from me to back up now Amy so therefore he did it Paul did it Peter did it all the hairs a figure therefore by the grace of God if I got a little bit of voice I want to stand and proclaim that word I want to tell the citizens if they have straight away to the world repent and come back to God for if you don't it's like a dog trainer to his own vomit I'll Pig wallet in his own slop is what it is plain and simple when God I bet it would be so gracious to calm down himself on the earth his spirit and hide it behind human skin he shows all kind of things out here and then back up from the Word of God see that's our calling and therefore I look at how many devils sit there in the church D because three Hebrew boys they were told to worship gods and the image now the same devil is trying to get us to worship the same gods Antichrist and the image same thing and now these gods are men trying to be like Christ coming with because their own teaching worship they're sending me now and will not do will knock them out because in training amen yes sir so now we see them so you may wonder why why yourself because hard why is so pinchy here's why now you watch there's going to be a nightmare we read not in your sleep on the bed on the earth God works in threes now you know yourself that sometimes when it's time for you to go to sleep because you lay down and you're not sleeping and because you're not awake because in between Twilight Zone and they're all kind of things happen to you scream out all kind of horrors is a nightmare that's number one that's you here on earth the other nightmare is hell just because seven dimensions and we hit in the third dimension here the fourth dimension is radio TV and so forth the fifth dimension is hell that's a nightmare also here's why a man's 10 is up on earth he cannot sleep in Jesus because he is not converted he has no blood to take him there so he got to leave the earth because you don't want to leave but he got to go those demons the weight never changed - he could drag him away his soul he's got to go because his tan is up and he can't go in to the sixth dimension up Nick up on the altar there he can't go there there's no blood for soul where can he go to hell to wait for the judgement but while in hell there's a nightmare going on that's number two number one is a man lay on his bed that's one nightmare Sami girlfriends the other one is when he goes into hell his time is up here you can't he gotta go he's got to leave there time is up but he can't go into God's presence he'd look at the gospel he mocked it he scoffed at it now where is the other nightmare the Prophet said by the form of his words the hell is going to be on the earth the nightmare is going to be here the mental condition will bring the nightmare on the earth they will go crazy they will scream they will swear because they're seeing ants because 20 feet high Lucas with long hair stinging their women for slipping off the hair and all these it'll be in their mind they'll be there walking the street naked screaming up and down because sodomites Devils it's coming friends and you wanna live here into the Word of God brother I don't want to be here you know why it's coming for a time is up time shall be no longer so sayeth God he says the time is up there for you man you cannot stay on this earth no longer for you have polluted this earth and you've got to go now but instead of taking it right into hell I'm gonna judge you here for three and a half years on this earth here I'm gonna bring all kind of Horrors on this earth and you wanna want to die and screami' and you cannot die I'm gonna bring it right here now you want to know why I hold to the word hold to God's unchanging here brother we better check up this is not pray thing this is a battle in this devil with lying wonders he's coming to and he will deceive all whose names is not written in the Lamb's Book of Life now you can go on and fool around and go back in the world and cut you here right up your skirts on men what you want to do if you want to what you will be in a nightmare and it will be worse for you for you no better for you heard you wasn't God's presence you saw the glory of God you ate the manna in shouted you saw the healings and then your turn and you walked away from God's present there's no sacrifice for you nothing but the fiery judgment of God to keep you here for three and a half years in judges now that's the Bible and that's what we are preaching to you this morning to line up with the word of God this is not because it's not me telling you that yes this is the message this is the cool Oh God coming down to call this people out amen praise our God didn't see people repent and turn around and go right back to the same muck and mire you say God what is happening God be merciful to them what is wrong with their mind that going insane and they come into God's present lusting around and wanting this and wanting that and laughing in your face and talking about you everything else you know what's gonna happen to them you can see it you can see it right now so what happens now the end time remember there will be it that's the third nightmare in your sleep inhale on their number three he brings all three amen see the time is up he said himself time shall be no longer your time is up in the fullness of time he gathered all things in heaven and in the earth the bride into himself and then the judgments fall on the rest now there's three crowning's the bride her life she's heading to virtue patience temperance knowledge godliness brotherly kindness that's her life that he gave her the strength the word you could do it if you want it you can laugh at it but then because she does that he slips thereon in all his glory now watch the earth is narrow the setting first is demand then the earth becomes the setting then the battleground just final blow just final bout then God brings all of the power amen that's in the kingdom he brings the angels they come also and the bride is ready she has a spoken word that comes to the earth then the devil brings up all those demons in Hell all those filthy devils walk-ins - they're all on the earth and there they meet face to face the bride meet him for a short time then he crowns her with his life his help himself and gives her a body like his but he changes it in a moment in a twinkling of an eye now there's only two more crowning's the foolish virgins who play around whoo laughs or maybe because they'll have the revelation and so forth they is just not God's election they the only way they can escape it because I said over here in Revelation 14 I believe it is relation 14 nirn I think it is are you with me revelation 14:13 and I heard a voice from heaven saying now this was just 13 Jill screaming don't worship the Beast nor his image nor the mark in his hand see and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me write blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord from henceforth yea saith the spirit that they may rest but because from their Labour's their works do follow them your work comes right to you the breath their works follow them therefore they have to crown their life with their own life just because Christ's life is is is not there for them and the rest of the world they crown their life with Satan's life he floods his sperm into them his own nature and deludes them all and he had his bride here the world counsel he has his legions of demons the Pope and always men's day all they all here and he has a son of mice running up and down I was reading because some stories of the things that didn't want to do to these Christians put them into all kind of sodomite X and everything else or force them to all kind of things the car they gon do to them in a short time I ain't trying to scare you I'm only trying to tell you these things is this is really this is a nightmare and they gonna have to die to go out of here therefore you can die now to this world you can die to this world to the fashion of this world to the things of this world to everything here you can die to right now and then you can live unto Christ be alive unto God or you could still dilly-dally flip flap around hallelujah praise the Lord and one day the brat is gone dead and Christ comes you ain't gonna know it for it says that that they are paired to the bride and they tell the bride that the rapture is at hand it's a secret coming so they only comes to the bride there's a resurrection power ministry coming that's to the bride only for Christ's mercy article on the earth but to everybody but when he rose from the dead that was only the bride that's all so therefore only the bride will know he's even back here in resurrection power the rest won't even know it and they'll go right on preaching they'll go right on shout and scream and holler preached the same message here but the bride will be walking humble walking humble say nothing wait for that knockout blow god bless you forsaken with crowns walking on with her cross that I always come and friends I'm living for you I'm looking for it I don't care who says what if nobody want to pray if they don't want to worship God you don't have to see me now but there's a nightmare coming and you're in it right now you can see it out here yourself now open your eyes and see it yourself and then think what God is doing for us and then we fussed at God see give glory to God thank him and praise Him he's doing this for purpose he's making us diet in this nature here what he's doing is die to the things of this world here so the end time brings to the earth the glory of God and hell on earth both of them together on the earth brings both of the back here the glory of God for a short time and this knockout blow comes the sons of God take back the kingdom the benefits are in the way they're going did they take a Asuna track and the power of the Holy Ghost and they go on the countdown is on the fire takes them up the rest on here are left to Satan in a strong illusion goes out you know now you cannot withstand it see when they're what loosens this they already because being because deluded right now see but there's got to be another falling away it's coming see so therefore those who have stayed with this message the past three years or so 1066 they've been laughed at that ain't a message you got to do so on so you got to go over here and many have even walked away from here and cursed you that's right curse you said that ain't nothing their denomination walked away from it they failed to see the blood atonement just like Balaam he look at Israel and the way they look but he didn't see that because blood atonement there you look at them so others look at you what kind of group is empty they don't see that blood hang in there the word day in and day out the word amen the word is here that blood sacrifice is there they will see them people dying out to these things here but let me tell you one thing the nightmare is here it ain't coming is here you see it now I think brother hunt just gave me an article and a Christian booklet Newsweek said the miniskirt was designed to entice the men I'm just saying plain see into the bed in the daytime now Christian woman that would raise up your dress who are you trying to entice in the daytime in the daytime Christian woman with the message the blood of God who are you trying to entice with your short dress or the fashions of this world the men who else got to see and he said watch that you see the church then when you see that lovely Brian washed out that's got no design there for somebody else's husband or want this over here just Christ just a word hanging out sticking very plain today I won't see you for a while I want you to know exactly what is going on see and so so therefore forsaken then crowned now this is not popular in no way in this message and you know that hey you come here brother just wanna preach we don't preach that there no sir you can't preach us here no where I in this message and you better not you better tell them how this is going to happen here and this great things will happen that's not that's enough we could we have our own tapes that's right see but he said preach the word in season out of season is rebuke and correcting with all along something why there's a nightmare coming I don't want to be in it therefore if I haven't been because given a chart I'm gonna stand true that charge a minute everybody walk away if I leave I'm gonna hold on to the word that is the only thing that will take us out of here I've said these things to shake you to waking you up because a nightmare people scream and holler horrors and things go on 10:00 right well then they're down inhale now brother Brown told you he went down there yeah whoo whoo whoo all kind of things going he said it was he can't even describe the feeling well that's come no no sorry hey I don't want to be here they said that they'll hunt down the foolish version like dogs and kill them down like dogs you said well how can that be strong delusion comes upon them it happened once before swear did they're doing God a service that's exactly right think so once in a while we tell you these things so that you might know and understand that we just not appear playing games this is real we fightin a real devil and he's gonna take as many in his tug of war and as we hold on to this rope right now see just like this here there's somebody coming down on the end of it and yank it give it a real pull amen that's right praise the Lord he's coming he's gonna give that a real tongue and you see them demons go squirt all along the ground falling down and all that you said that's right I'm gonna blast those Devils out when the man has the spirits in them these demons and they are cast out he's clean walks in dry places but okay if he repents that's good but then fill up that place with the word because if you don't take in the word right away seven more demons come in and in you're worse than which it was before exactly right amen do you love them we're in a battle friends but he has already overcome it's coming a nightmare the Holy Spirit told me to tell you these things here so I'm telling to you I know it's not popular but I am looking to be popular I'm looking to stay with that word this is what the Prophet had to preach he had to walk into his own tabernacle and say knoweth it not and solutely talking to talk to them and it's happening right in the tablet cutting in here and when false he's all kind of things right in tabernacle and he had to preach it right there and and blade said the Methodist woman they didn't catch it say so therefore God the grace of God has kept this church clean it's been his grace now see his word and His grace because his hope is not me a brother heart but the cred nobody here is his grace he have a clean place and we recognize what it is it's a place where the word can go forth I don't care I don't I'm not interested in who says that you ain't this look that doesn't bother me at all that's God those ferrets must be here so when I see them I shout praise God well here they are right here dearly now follow me down yeah I just go right along see just treat them with love and keep moving see them in now and that no matter what they say against you that must be but God has kept this place here clean by the grace of God we want to keep this place clean do we leave here there'd be a clean place if two people want to hear that gospel there'd be a place that you won't have to because clamor with devils to get in here come on man this wall can take your seat and say glory to God for it strike your praise God see me now so it wasn't like I come on it cut that flesh out chop it down and see with the word see there now to keep a clean place a testimony of the message so you may be forsaken so you think so look you may feel like because you washed in washed out but you're not that's just where he wants you at than your crown you crown you with himself do you Lovell praise God and think about it now these people the judgment areas here they can't go to heaven and they because they can't go to hell they got to be here for judgment and the only ones who can go while is to die with their own lives and their bride she goes out she goes up for she has a place to go to into Christ she's in Christ and he gives her his glorious body amen so therefore these little things of the flesh denarii and these things brother that's nothing to me it don't mean a thing and every sister here god bless you you have a hump net that has given you a trial where else would you get your trial from now you tell me what would you do see where you gonna get because all your because it could the trial from is ordained of God you are to believe for his salvation that you're sanctified you keep him sanctified for the hour is coming live brother Graham's dream where God told him there was mrs. Fenton and those people there in the house of hell it's in his dream on a work his faith Express and he's I can't do anything myself no strength he says speak in my name he said how the hell give way to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the walls come tumbling down and the people come out deliver it and I believe it the name of God will deliver the people one more time there'll be one more ride I believe that God will speak through his bride to bring deliverance so you got to believe other words faith is you can't see no kind of way out of it that's what is faith see when you can't see how to get out of it God said so they're not free well you can see how to get out of it ain't no faith then right what kind of faith if you know we're gonna do the Golden City over here sit down wait and holly's go to God and see faith no sir faith faith is like what they had they did understand the Lord but Lord where could we go now alone has the words of eternal life amen so we thank the Lord this morning to know where we stand so I say to the old people to the young people if I never see you again see there's coming a nightmare on this earth and I have not failed to because declare to you the gospel the message this morning say and therefore whatever your condition you in right now repent from that if you entangle somewhere and get right with God see because he's coming forth soon when he comes forth he brings a dip in Christ with him this is coming see and he said before that that California would sink no I don't understand it he said before he comes on this tape who do you say he is in 64 he said that I predict California will sink before the coming of the Lord and when God comes he brings the Democrats with him sing well therefore now how close is this earthquake and what does all because these things mean here in April all like I don't know see but I know one thing something is fixing to happen I know another thing there's a strong delusion ready to go forth to that although that Satan has with his strategy wants them there for the mercy seat is in the word God unveiled so therefore the blood and it's worth and you come to the for it for the blood of God for the mercy of God and repent of all I can tell you see and until that time let us draw close to the Word of God and add to your faith his life his firm his nature his blood and then let him come down to capstone and cap it and then let him play stiff body into position with the enemy and then let him go that knockout blow Amen praise the water collector Omar - ah beautiful beautiful ha we're mocking of what use I'm guilty 450 of stock before we must design the 11 raised below amen I thank the Lord to know the Royal job to know where I'm standing at you know what I'm looking for I'm looking for Jesus the author and finisher of my faith and having done all to stand amen hey in any way Amen praise God and then one day with your hand up pleasing God one day he'll drop off glistening silver poured into your hand cream then he'll do everything amen until that time amen praise the Lord joining with we join in therefore whenever they still before we reach heaven ow thank you lord don't you want Jesus to cap off your pyramid well then hold fast to the form of salary keep that good thing and artists the word that Eve had and let it go you hold it and while we in training will knock out those fall crimes while we spawn with them amen praise the Lord prep the battles no matter if mother father whoever leaves you whoever forestation that's got to be that is your cross and you must pick it up that's exactly right other words the word of my condition now how could it if it could have been better and then he would have given it to me he could he'll give you all things that right then he must know exactly what I need today and then I'm my feet is shod with the preparation I'm standing on Emanuel's ground what happened on all the stands stand there for a man know what you in the will of God then he will come and crown you amen with his life I'm looking forward and what is to bring on the nightmare mental condition exactly right the mental the prophets told that in Revelation those are not physical those are spiritual things over there and the LSD and all these things is bringing it in now and they will go insane they're completely nude all kind of lewd worship and everything else the devil and you see it coming and what is to go mental the movies come in we're all kind of pro version is here now and 69 to bring it all forward it's here right now then here's the President Nixon his great friends is the angels of Sodom Billy Graham now that could just be happening that way and they've been friends for the past 20 years and his theme is you're 19 uniting bringing the country together bring it in with the church and state all together see and that's the same theme of God uniting but the devil with his perversion and therefore we're in the our friends thing and so two things that happen the glory of God has to come to the earth and the all a hell is to come up on earth right here faint and hell is to be here for three and a half years and only the those who keep the commandments of God and hold on to the testimony of Jesus Christ can escape it outside of the bride's indoors oh don't you want to be in the bride amen think well praise God this so whole believes it's myth with all your heart died out to the world and say Lord leave me that's all and it tells you what is the heart should I be well because in closing of Scripture Ephesians 4 tells us in the fifteenth sixteenth verse but speaking the truth see speaking the truth holding it true see a walking in the truth think and love the love must come think and then when it love come speaking the truth in love walking in love acting in love talking in love amen si si may grow up into him in all things he's the head and he wants to be preeminent they told the Colossians in all things but we have to grow up unto Him in all things they with love and as the desert her brother man told us that nothing but perfect love will take you to that place that right and he dropped down his perfect love on the bride and if she goes for any love for bacon but yoke Roman one of these moines won a crown amen full right now in the congregation here you try to live godly and maybe some I'm I laugh at you alright you know what you're doing do they know they might think you're old-fashioned whatever it is think and thank you cuz you're always trying to be right with the word and so forth do things right then they'd laugh at this door that become safe at the devil they're not trying to get y'all do it out do be about your father's been through everything right because by the grace of God try to do it think he knows his heart God knows your heart you love him pray so he loves us this morning you want you to know that though would you feel for thinking the crowning is coming and every servant of Christ comes to that point and I believe the bride is just about in that situation now the crowning he will crown up with the glory of the word of God and you'll see the life of Jesus Christ on earth once again same ministries same power and then as she nears the headstones she does be very acts of God on the earth coming right down like him and then the fourth of times you get of all things in heaven into himself and I believe it that knockout blow it'll come at that time the Christ Himself will be right in that bright it'll be him and he will create right through our little that's our promise thing therefore you see you have nothing to do but present your bodies a living sacrifice holy none the father only your reasonable service for the help now remember will because maneuver and position the body in the fight see and the head knows all of saints the Satan's blue what he getting ready for a left hook or right the head knows what he want to do before do it because it has discernment amen I told be please beam to the punch amen praise the Lord she always there
