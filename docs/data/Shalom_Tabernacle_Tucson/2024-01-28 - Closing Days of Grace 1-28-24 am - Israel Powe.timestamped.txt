[4:07] horse that was red and power was given
[4:10] to him that sat thereon to take peace
[4:13] from the earth and that they should kill
[4:16] one another and there was given unto him
[4:19] a great sword amen and so let's sing

[5:04] be God bless you you may be seated
[5:07] brother
[5:09] brenon that's what the tree put its
[5:12] forth its first branch and that's what
[5:14] happened and if that tree ever puts
[5:16] forth another Branch they'll write
[5:17] another book of Acts behind it because
[5:19] you see the same life got to be in the
[5:21] same name so now today when we look over
[5:25] our denominational churches Methodist
[5:27] Baptist Presbyterian Luther Church of
[5:30] Christ soall and Pentecostals and things
[5:33] where do we find
[5:35] that you don't find it I will admit that
[5:39] the Pentecostals has the closest thing
[5:41] two three is because they're up here in
[5:43] the lady of sin Church age they had
[5:46] truth and rejected it they got lukewarm
[5:48] with it and God spewed them from his
[5:50] mouth exactly according to the
[5:52] scriptures you can't make them
[5:53] scriptures
[5:54] lie they're going to be truthful always
[5:57] don't try to only thing don't try line
[6:00] your thought up uh to the the scriptures
[6:02] up to your thought but align yourself up
[6:04] with the scriptures that's then you're
[6:07] running with God no matter how much you
[6:08] have to cut away or lay aside line up
[6:11] with that look what it did the first
[6:14] time it fell well if God acted like that
[6:16] the first time he's got to act like that
[6:19] the second time he's got to act like
[6:21] that every time or he acted wrong the
[6:23] first
[6:23] time see we as models we can make
[6:27] mistakes God can God's first decision is
[6:30] perfect and the way he chose to do
[6:33] things there can't be no other better
[6:34] way he can't improve on it because it's
[6:36] perfect to begin with if it isn't then
[6:39] he is an
[6:40] infinite and if he's infinite then he's
[6:43] omn Miss and if he's omn Miss he's
[6:45] omnipotent amen he's got to be that to
[6:47] be God see so you can't say he learned
[6:51] more he didn't learn more he's a he's
[6:53] the very Fountain of all
[6:57] wisdom our wisdom here come from Satan
[7:00] We inherited it from Eden where we
[7:02] swapped off faith for wisdom Eve did it
[7:06] now he was first called Antichrist the
[7:09] second stage he was called the false
[7:12] prophet because that
[7:15] Spirit among the people become
[7:19] incarnate you remember the white horse
[7:21] rider now had no Crown when he
[7:25] started but then he would was given a
[7:27] crown why he was a Cadian Spirit to
[7:30] begin with and then he become incarnate
[7:33] in a man and then he was
[7:35] crowned and received a throne and was
[7:41] crowned and then he served that for a
[7:44] long time as we see as we the seals
[7:46] break and then we find out after that
[7:48] long time Satan was kicked out of heaven
[7:51] and he come down according to the
[7:53] scriptures and enthroned
[7:56] himself just thing enthroned himself
[7:59] self in that man and become a
[8:06] beast and he had power supreme power
[8:10] like that he done all the Miracles and
[8:13] everything that that the uh killings and
[8:17] bloody fights and everything that that
[8:19] Rome could produce all right he killed
[8:23] by cruel Roman
[8:26] punishment just oh how we could break in
[8:29] some scriptures here remember Jesus
[8:32] Christ died under the punishment of
[8:36] Rome capital
[8:39] punishment the message that I've got my
[8:41] heart to preach up here at this next
[8:42] meeting on Good Friday
[8:44] afternoon meet three four things see
[8:48] there they crucify him there the Hol
[8:53] religious place in the world was
[8:57] Jerusalem they the most Most Holy
[8:59] supposed to be people in the world the
[9:02] Jews There They Crucified the most cruel
[9:06] punishment that Rome could produce
[9:08] crucified him what the greatest person
[9:11] that ever
[9:12] lived Hallelujah There They Crucified
[9:16] him my God helped me to swing into that
[9:20] bunch of business man they can see where
[9:21] they're
[9:22] standing now not to be different not to
[9:25] be nasty but to shake that to them
[9:27] brothers can see that they
[9:29] dignitaries and holy fathers and things
[9:33] are writing up in this businessman's
[9:34] journal is nonsense Christians are not
[9:37] supposed to call any man
[9:40] father
[9:42] God they start that I've tried to help
[9:45] him and everything I can you see know
[9:47] where this tape go so I'm
[9:50] finished I certainly won't have anything
[9:53] else to do with it all right first
[9:56] remember Christ first as
[10:00] Nick
[10:01] nicadan and what did the nicadan age ask
[10:05] for it asked to get away from them A
[10:09] bunch of people that shouts and claps
[10:11] their hands and looks like disgracefully
[10:14] like they on Pentecost act like drunk
[10:17] men staggering in the spirit and things
[10:18] they didn't want know that stuff they
[10:20] said they were drunk and when the
[10:22] celebrity
[10:23] listen don't miss this it may sound
[10:26] crazy to you but it's the
[10:28] truth
[10:29] when the the dignitaries begin to come
[10:32] in they couldn't stoop to that right
[10:35] what makes God big is because he's big
[10:38] enough to stoop
[10:40] down God that's what makes him big
[10:43] there's nothing bigger and he stooped
[10:46] the lowest that anybody could stoop any
[10:48] human being ever
[10:50] stoop he was a king of heaven and he
[10:53] come to the to the lowest city on the
[10:58] Earth
[11:00] Jericho and he got so low to even the
[11:03] shortest man in the town had to look
[11:06] down on him the SC is that
[11:09] right zachus that's right he was called
[11:13] a worst name that any human being could
[11:16] be called a sorcerer a devil the
[11:20] elub that's what the world thought of me
[11:22] died the cruelest death didn't have a
[11:25] place to lay his head amen kicked out by
[11:29] every
[11:30] organization but when God exalted him so
[11:33] high till he has to look down to see
[11:36] Heaven God in
[11:39] humility and give him a name so great
[11:44] that as the whole family of Heaven is
[11:46] named
[11:47] after and every family there the Earth
[11:50] all the family on Earth is named Jesus
[11:54] all the families in Heavens in the name
[11:56] Jesus am and such a name that every knee
[12:00] will bow and every tongue will confess
[12:02] to
[12:03] [Music]
[12:05] him either here in hell hell will bow to
[12:09] it everything else will bow to
[12:11] it see but first it was
[12:14] humility then it become great let God
[12:18] exalt he that humbles himself God will
[12:21] exalt now we notice this
[12:25] nickel Spirit wanted with wisdom smarter
[12:30] it had to reason out like it was in Eden
[12:33] reason against the word of God by the
[12:37] wisdom and the church fell
[12:42] for what was it now let's say take this
[12:46] church here and take a bunch of people
[12:48] like we are if he wasn't real spirit
[12:50] filled and let's take say h nothing
[12:53] against the mayor of our city I don't
[12:55] think I know him Mr but off is he still
[12:57] mayor I
[12:59] I don't Mr but off's a fine friend of
[13:01] mine but say the mayor of the city and
[13:04] all the police force and uh and uh all
[13:08] the marshals and they they all come here
[13:11] the first thing you know if they got
[13:14] this a little thing in their head begin
[13:15] to talk to the board and the people
[13:17] around here and say now you know what
[13:20] this ought to be different if you're not
[13:23] spirit filled and got a real spirit
[13:25] filled man behind the pull pit the first
[13:27] thing you know be catering to him
[13:29] maybe not this generation maybe the next
[13:32] generation and that's where it started
[13:34] in see why they were saying look at here
[13:37] it's reasonable you you listen to say a
[13:40] man come in here there could say this
[13:41] church is too little let us build a big
[13:44] church I'll build you when out your
[13:46] it'll be worth so much money a half a
[13:48] million dollars it'll be put in there
[13:50] I'll put the thing on the broadcast when
[13:52] they do that then they got to AAG grind
[13:56] nine times out of 10 you know one of
[13:58] them kind
[14:00] first thing you know then if he does he
[14:02] runs things to suit himself you can't
[14:05] stay him because brother John do back
[14:07] there he's a finan of this
[14:10] church and then you get a little Ricky
[14:12] out of some Seminary and knows about his
[14:14] much about God as a hot and toop does
[14:16] about Egyptian Knight and he'll come
[14:18] along there and he'll cater to that guy
[14:20] because he buys him a new car all the
[14:22] time lets him ride around buys him this
[14:24] that and the
[14:26] other now that's exactly how it started
[14:30] out Ryan notice wisdom and smartness
[14:35] they said now look here isn't only
[14:37] sensible now are are women what
[14:40] difference does it make how they wear
[14:42] their
[14:42] hair but the Bible says it does make a
[14:48] difference just take that one thing
[14:51] besides the hundreds of others see it
[14:54] does make a difference God said it made
[14:57] a difference so it is a
[15:00] difference but you see if they get that
[15:02] started the trustee board deacons and
[15:04] everything the first thing you know the
[15:06] pastor either gets in or gets out that's
[15:09] all it's the people that voted it in all
[15:12] right now notice that Spirit begin to
[15:15] move and the church that's that that got
[15:18] so much dignitary in it so much big
[15:20] things and so much money started after a
[15:22] while they listen to it and fail for it
[15:26] the crudeness of the
[15:29] and that's the very thing that Eve done
[15:32] in the Garden of
[15:34] Eden now you hear that that's right look
[15:37] the Natural
[15:39] Woman Adam's
[15:41] bride before he come to her as a wife
[15:45] fell for the Satan's scheme against the
[15:49] word of God by reasoning
[15:52] it before Adam lived with Eve as a
[15:57] wife Satan beating
[16:01] there that's right you heard the brid
[16:04] tree I preached on that's talks up see
[16:07] all right now notice
[16:09] there
[16:11] Eve fell for reason now he Satan tried
[16:15] to read she said but the Lord said he
[16:17] said oh you know but surely the Lord
[16:19] want yeah you you want to be wise you
[16:23] want to know something well you're
[16:24] nothing but a dumb child see you ought
[16:27] to know something if that isn't
[16:29] Satan if that isn't some of these
[16:33] modern oh they're just a bunch of holy
[16:35] RS don't P hisy don't
[16:37] wor now the natural first Bride of the
[16:42] human race before her husband come to
[16:46] her she fell from Grace by listening to
[16:52] Satan's lie after God had her fortified
[16:55] behind his word if she stayed behind the
[17:00] word should have never
[17:02] fell now that's in the natural
[17:06] notice a natural
[17:08] woman and what was the curse the actual
[17:12] curse of coming out from behind God's
[17:15] word now remember she believed about 98%
[17:19] of
[17:20] it but she just had to let one thing
[17:23] go see she believed a whole lot of it oh
[17:27] certainly Jesus said this and Satan Adit
[17:30] that's right if he can just get you on
[17:31] one corner that's all he
[17:33] wants see only thing you have to do is
[17:36] give the bullet a little twist this way
[17:37] and miss the
[17:38] target see that's all now she believes
[17:42] so much of it but yet missed it now and
[17:46] the and the results because she left the
[17:50] word for one little speck of a
[17:54] reason I say now what about the women or
[17:56] why you want to talk about something
[17:57] like that but any of those little things
[17:59] what's the difference for initial
[18:00] evidence it's something to it you got
[18:03] it's got to be straightened
[18:05] out we pursued that through seven Church
[18:09] ages almost but the Hours
[18:11] come when God speaks it he don't only
[18:14] speak it but he shows it and vindicates
[18:16] it and proves it right if he doesn't do
[18:20] it then isn't God that's all God stands
[18:23] behind his word notice now now the
[18:27] Natural Woman woman caused natural death
[18:30] because she listen to reason to make
[18:33] herself
[18:34] lies make herself
[18:37] wise instead of staying behind the word
[18:39] and doing what God told her to she
[18:41] wanted wisdom and be wise and she
[18:43] listened to reason and and she lost the
[18:46] whole human
[18:49] race now this time the spiritual woman
[18:56] the bride of Christ that started on the
[18:59] day of
[19:00] Pentecost with the early Apostolic
[19:04] Church lost the same thing amen at the
[19:09] NAA
[19:11] Council Lee you know that's
[19:14] right and it aasia
[19:18] Council when she swapped her spiritual
[19:22] birth rights to take Constantine's big
[19:26] churches and things that he offered
[19:28] there am and she sold out her scriptural
[19:32] birthrights for a bunch of Roman
[19:36] D now that's hard on the Catholic but
[19:38] the Protestant has done the same thing
[19:42] and representing the Bible here as a
[19:44] daughter of the Harlot of the
[19:47] that's right it's exactly right every
[19:49] one of them that's right no excuses but
[19:53] out of there has always been a little
[19:55] remant right along that goes to make the
[19:57] bride
[19:59] noce she lost her birth rights see
[20:03] before her husband got to her yeah see
[20:07] before the wedding she lost her virtue
[20:12] and now you remember that she said I
[20:14] said as a queen I have no need of
[20:18] nothing and that lady of seeing age
[20:20] there I'm rich increased in Goods so
[20:24] forth and all the whole world looks up
[20:26] to me I'm the Great holy church and so
[20:29] forth were this way the whole age and he
[20:32] said you don't know that you're a naked
[20:35] blind miserable wretched poor and don't
[20:39] know
[20:41] it that's the condition now if the holy
[20:44] spirit said the condition to be that way
[20:46] in the last days it's that
[20:48] way there's no way of getting around it
[20:51] that's the way it is now
[20:53] what now when she sold her birthrights
[20:56] back there her virtues right out the
[20:58] word what did she do when Eve did it she
[21:03] lost the creation whole creation fell
[21:06] under now
[21:08] notice and when the church did it except
[21:11] the dogmas instead of the spirit and the
[21:15] word it cursed the whole
[21:19] system amen every denominational system
[21:23] that ever was or ever will be was cursed
[21:25] with it and
[21:27] fell there's no other way when you get a
[21:29] bunch of man together to figure out
[21:30] anything one's got to head this way
[21:32] one's got to head that way and one's got
[21:33] to head this way they put the things
[21:35] together and Shake It Up and when it
[21:36] comes out that's what you got it that's
[21:38] exactly what they did at the N Council
[21:40] that's exactly what they do at the
[21:41] Methodist Presbyterian Church of Christ
[21:44] the rest of
[21:45] them and man no matter what God reveals
[21:48] to him you got to teach it the way their
[21:49] credential their Tre Creed says or they
[21:52] kick you out don't tell me I've been
[21:55] there and I know it and that's just
[21:58] exactly what's happened so the whole
[21:59] thing's
[22:01] cursed no one of the Angels said come
[22:03] out of her my people not partakes of her
[22:06] plag because she's going to she's cursed
[22:08] and she's got to suffer the curse of
[22:11] God's wrath upon her because she sold
[22:14] her virtue in
[22:15] right Hallelujah but oh
[22:19] my but remember seeing all that
[22:22] condition but yet God promised in Joy
[22:25] 225 he going to put it down and the last
[22:28] days when he said what the polymer worm
[22:30] left the caterpillar eaten what the
[22:33] caterpillar left the the Locust is
[22:36] eating what the Locust eating just on
[22:38] down bug after bug had come and eat on
[22:41] that church until finally it was nothing
[22:44] but a stump right what what the Romans
[22:50] left the lutherans eating what the
[22:53] Lutheran left the methodists eating what
[22:55] the methodists left the Pentecostals was
[22:58] eaten see until she's down to a stump
[23:02] and do you know what you take those
[23:04] worms in there that Locust and
[23:06] caterpillar and so forth and you chase
[23:09] them down through the uh the book and
[23:11] find out it's the same worm in just
[23:14] different stages what your point so is
[23:19] these
[23:21] seals it's the same worms amen you're
[23:25] going to see it when we bring it out so
[23:27] I'll tell you now
[23:28] it's the same worm all the time four
[23:32] those worms four here and are the same
[23:34] thing it's the same
[23:37] Spirit what one left the other eat what
[23:39] this left the other eat like that so
[23:41] they brought it to a
[23:43] stump but Joel said I will restore sayth
[23:47] the Lord all the years the caterpillar's
[23:51] eaten what is it how is he going to do
[23:53] it if it started out Antichrist but
[23:56] being against the teaching of Christ
[23:58] that accepted Dogma instead of word and
[24:01] through the years the reformers has
[24:02] plunged at it as the Bible said but in
[24:05] the last days at the sounding
[24:08] Revelations 101:7 he said the mysteries
[24:11] of God will be finished in the last days
[24:13] at the sounding of the Seven
[24:15] Angels Malachi 4 said that he would send
[24:20] Elijah before the evil Day come upon the
[24:23] earth when he burn it like a furnace and
[24:25] he would restore and would bring back
[24:29] the the children to the faith of the
[24:33] Father the original Apostolic
[24:37] Pentecostal
[24:41] Faith promised to be restored amen
[24:45] hallelujah now that's just as plain as
[24:47] scripture can say
[24:49] it now it's promised and if we're in the
[24:52] last days something's got to happen and
[24:56] it is happening amen and we're sing amen
[25:00] praise God praise the Lord
[25:04] amen

[1:03:03] Stillness he spoke his creative words
[1:03:07] let there be light and let the heavens
[1:03:10] appear he made the oceans and the Seas
[1:03:14] and the
[1:03:15] Earth with his mighty hand scooped out
[1:03:18] the
[1:03:20] canyon with his fingers he traced
[1:03:23] courses for the
[1:03:25] Rivers he made the mountains to stand
[1:03:28] tall and
[1:03:31] still but then a slight trace of
[1:03:34] sadness came into his
[1:03:37] eyes as he
[1:03:40] made a
[1:03:42] small Lonely
[1:03:48] Hill then he
[1:03:51] said let us make man
[1:03:55] in

[1:04:25] he should
[1:04:29] fall oh but I
[1:04:33] want him to love
[1:04:35] me just
[1:04:37] because he really wants
[1:04:40] to to
[1:04:42] walk with me by his own
[1:04:50] way but in a
[1:04:53] slight trace of
[1:04:56] sadness came back into his
[1:05:01] eyes as he
[1:05:03] looked for that
[1:05:05] small Lonely
[1:05:11] Hill then
[1:05:14] late one

[1:06:14] man hung there
[1:06:17] dying
[1:06:19] crying I
[1:06:22] thirst God turned his face from that
[1:06:26] small Lonely

[1:14:19] amen all
[1:14:21] right Daniel chapter 5 5 verse number
[1:14:30] one
[1:14:33] basar the king made a great feast to
[1:14:36] thousands of his Lords and drank wine
[1:14:39] before the Thousand Bel shazar whilst he
[1:14:42] tasted the wine commanded to bring the
[1:14:46] golden and silver vessels which his
[1:14:48] father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of
[1:14:51] the temple which was in Jerusalem that
[1:14:53] the king and his princesses his wives
[1:14:57] and his concubines might drink therein
[1:15:00] then they brought the golden vessels
[1:15:03] that were taken out of the Temple of the
[1:15:05] house of God which was at Jerusalem and
[1:15:08] the King and his princesses his wives
[1:15:12] and his concubines Drank in them they
[1:15:14] drank wine and praised the gods of go of
[1:15:18] gold and of silver and of brass and of
[1:15:21] iron of wood and of stone
[1:15:24] in that same hour in the same hour came
[1:15:27] forth fingers of a man's hand and wrote
[1:15:31] over against the
[1:15:32] Candlestick upon the plaster of the wall
[1:15:36] of the king's Palace the king saw the
[1:15:40] part of the hand that wrote then the
[1:15:43] king's countenance was changed and his
[1:15:46] thoughts troubled him so that the joints
[1:15:49] of his loins were loosed and his knees
[1:15:52] smoted one one against another verse
[1:15:58] 25 and this is the writing that was
[1:16:01] written many many tel
[1:16:04] euphrasian this is the interpretation of
[1:16:07] the thing many God hath numbered thy
[1:16:11] kingdom and finished it Tio Thou Art
[1:16:14] weighed in the balance and are found
[1:16:17] wanting perz the kingdom is divided thy
[1:16:22] kingdom is divided and given to the mes
[1:16:26] and Persians amen so
[1:16:31] let let us pray once again Lord Jesus we
[1:16:35] ask your blessings on this word and
[1:16:37] blessing on your people we pray in Jesus
[1:16:40] name amen God bless you you may be
[1:16:43] seated we've been talking about this
[1:16:46] beginning and ending of the Gentile
[1:16:48] dispensation and we know that we are in
[1:16:51] the Gentile dispensation we shared with
[1:16:54] you the quotations the scriptures Daniel
[1:16:57] chapter 2 chapter 7 of the image of gold
[1:17:02] that that the King Nebuchadnezzar saw
[1:17:05] Daniel gave the interpretation of what
[1:17:08] the silver and the brass and iron and
[1:17:12] the clay and what they all meant and the
[1:17:14] Lord showed Nebuchadnezzar the beginning
[1:17:18] and ending of the Gentile dispensation
[1:17:21] showing him the time time of the
[1:17:25] Gentiles and we've been bringing those
[1:17:27] things and and um we see the the rock
[1:17:31] that was taken out of the mountain and
[1:17:33] it smot the great image and that image
[1:17:37] was bursted into powder and then the
[1:17:40] rock that smoted it rose up and became a
[1:17:43] great mountain and we know that that
[1:17:46] rock was Christ and that was speaking of
[1:17:50] the coming of the Lord can I get a
[1:17:52] witness this morning and the title of
[1:17:54] our message this morning is closing Days
[1:17:58] of Grace the closing days of grace and
[1:18:02] so we know that we are in the day of
[1:18:06] Grace right now and um it's a beautiful
[1:18:12] thing but it's sad also because that's
[1:18:14] all that we know we don't know what
[1:18:18] judgment looks like in a major way we
[1:18:20] only know one side of Grace the other
[1:18:24] side of Grace is God's judgment and we
[1:18:27] know that day is coming and so we the
[1:18:30] gentile people should be greatly
[1:18:33] appreciative of the day that we live in
[1:18:36] this is the day of Grace it's just like
[1:18:40] you know reading the history of Wars but
[1:18:43] we don't really know what wars uh what
[1:18:46] that means us As Americans we don't know
[1:18:51] um we haven't been in a war where it's
[1:18:53] come on our our our land on our ground I
[1:18:56] believe maybe the the last one that's of
[1:19:00] note is the Pearl Harbor when the
[1:19:02] Japanese snuck up on us and blew up on
[1:19:06] the coast there right there in Pearl
[1:19:08] Harbor and declared war on us um and
[1:19:12] that was a great we didn't know where it
[1:19:13] was coming from we didn't know exactly
[1:19:16] how how comprehensive it was but then
[1:19:19] you know we did what we did we got into
[1:19:22] the battle and fight and we did what we
[1:19:24] did but you know relatively speaking we
[1:19:27] I personally don't know what it is to be
[1:19:31] in war countries do other countries are
[1:19:34] in war now like what's going on in the
[1:19:36] Ukraine what's going on at in Israel at
[1:19:39] the border there what's going on in
[1:19:41] several countries they're in the time of
[1:19:43] war and it's a very difficult time for
[1:19:47] those folks those people we are
[1:19:51] concerned on you know if it's it's too
[1:19:53] cold in the house or if we got you know
[1:19:56] something where are we going to eat not
[1:19:58] if we're going to eat it's like where
[1:19:59] and what we're going to eat we made that
[1:20:01] a big old deal now it's not about the
[1:20:03] hunger it's about the experience of
[1:20:06] eating and the different flavors and the
[1:20:10] things that we call
[1:20:12] important but we know that there is a uh
[1:20:15] we are in the day of Grace but the time
[1:20:20] clock has been started on us and our
[1:20:24] time is winding winding
[1:20:27] up and if you are a True Believer you
[1:20:32] understand that the day that we're
[1:20:35] living in is not going to remain this
[1:20:37] way we know that there is coming you
[1:20:41] know in the foreground in the background
[1:20:45] just beyond the next set of of whatever
[1:20:49] whatever presidency or the next set of
[1:20:52] of circumstances is a great another
[1:20:56] happening and we um could be ushered
[1:20:59] right into something that we've never
[1:21:01] seen before and we realize that in in in
[1:21:05] word form we realize that because the
[1:21:07] word of God tells us that but do we know
[1:21:10] what it is in reality and so but but we
[1:21:14] thank God for this day of Grace don't we
[1:21:16] we thank God that we can
[1:21:18] actually go somewhere and pray without
[1:21:22] being forced to pray I mean we're not
[1:21:24] nothing's on fire or nothing is burning
[1:21:27] as yet we have the freedom to come and
[1:21:30] go we can come to church we don't have
[1:21:32] to we can stay late if we want to we can
[1:21:35] actually go to work get a job get three
[1:21:37] jobs actually we can build our wealth
[1:21:40] and build and go and come because this
[1:21:44] is the day of Grace God has given that
[1:21:47] to us God has given this nation
[1:21:51] liberties and freedoms that many nations
[1:21:54] wish they had and in all of the bad that
[1:21:58] we have done and all of the bad that's
[1:22:00] on our records and so forth there still
[1:22:03] it's a great nation to serve the Lord in
[1:22:06] we have the Lord on our money and God We
[1:22:09] Trust we call oursel a Christian Nation
[1:22:12] is that
[1:22:13] right we have what we call the freedom
[1:22:16] of religion kind of sort of and we are a
[1:22:20] Godly Nation part of the time sometimes
[1:22:25] we have liberty and justice for all but
[1:22:28] not everybody really some and so we we
[1:22:31] know that these things these these words
[1:22:34] and the things that we talk about as it
[1:22:37] pertains to this nation U that you know
[1:22:40] we experience that and we thank God for
[1:22:43] it and we say In God We Trust we can say
[1:22:47] in God we used to trust we can say it
[1:22:50] was the freedom of religion religion
[1:22:53] but it's really not free anymore now
[1:22:56] they're clapping down on what we believe
[1:22:59] and it just takes one video clip one
[1:23:01] posting on the social media and our
[1:23:04] neighbors and friends that are right out
[1:23:06] here will turn on us and say you all
[1:23:09] believe what you guys are really that
[1:23:12] hateful they don't know what we really
[1:23:15] believe do they no and it just takes one
[1:23:17] posting they come right here and they
[1:23:18] can record a part of a sermon or part of
[1:23:21] a statement
[1:23:23] highlight it dress it up and clip it out
[1:23:25] snip it out and post it online and then
[1:23:28] the people can get a very good picture
[1:23:31] they think of another hateful group of
[1:23:34] people people that really don't have the
[1:23:37] love and so we know that that that that
[1:23:39] is you know uh where we are so we we are
[1:23:43] in a day of Grace and we thank God for
[1:23:47] this day of Grace that's our Point
[1:23:50] that's our first point and that our time
[1:23:52] is winding up we're really on the clock
[1:23:55] right now it's already started click and
[1:23:59] we're moving into something our time is
[1:24:01] going into something secondly we believe
[1:24:05] and know that the Rapture is coming and
[1:24:08] will come to pass we know this we know
[1:24:12] that the word of God tells us that there
[1:24:14] will be a catching a way and we know
[1:24:17] that there's events to take place before
[1:24:19] the Rapture and whatever order you want
[1:24:22] to put it uh um it could very well and
[1:24:25] this is The Humbling part it could very
[1:24:28] well happen without it coming in the
[1:24:31] order that your pastor preaches or
[1:24:34] teaches it or that you have understood
[1:24:37] it let's take for one example the third
[1:24:40] pool there's many statements made about
[1:24:42] the third pool we know it's a promise we
[1:24:45] know it's it's come to pass we know it's
[1:24:46] in existence we know it is Con in
[1:24:49] connection to the Rapture but I can take
[1:24:51] the quote on it and show you that this
[1:24:54] third pool is happening right now it's
[1:24:57] in the ministry now and another group
[1:24:59] can say no it's a future event that
[1:25:02] we're looking for and another another
[1:25:05] group can say well it's happening now
[1:25:06] but it's going to happen greater over
[1:25:08] there whatever the interpretation is
[1:25:11] whatever way it's going to come in its
[1:25:13] order remember it could very well happen
[1:25:18] without God asking you permission to
[1:25:22] make it happen and it can happen in a
[1:25:25] way that you would miss it yourself even
[1:25:29] though you're looking for it even though
[1:25:31] you know there's a promise for it you
[1:25:34] can very well be sitting there looking
[1:25:36] for something that already happen or
[1:25:39] that is happening right before you and
[1:25:41] you not even it's all through the
[1:25:42] scriptures this is The Humbling part
[1:25:45] this is the part that should keep us on
[1:25:47] our knees this is the part where we put
[1:25:49] commas instead of periods on any Divine
[1:25:53] promise of God it can happen today and
[1:25:56] we don't know we don't know we well
[1:25:58] brother George I thought that was going
[1:26:00] to happen well I got these quotes I was
[1:26:01] waiting for this to happen and this
[1:26:03] group was waiting for that to happen
[1:26:04] well maybe it did
[1:26:06] happen in South America maybe it
[1:26:09] happened up in Canada you didn't have to
[1:26:12] go God don't have to show you when it's
[1:26:14] happening it's going to happen though is
[1:26:18] that right Saints we somehow think that
[1:26:21] because we know the promise is a promise
[1:26:24] that must happen that somehow God has to
[1:26:27] include us when it
[1:26:30] happens so we need to be very careful
[1:26:33] with that don't we so whatever scenario
[1:26:36] it may come of the order can I touch on
[1:26:39] that just a little bit more come on
[1:26:42] let's take for example the vision of the
[1:26:44] tent the tent vision and I I'm not
[1:26:47] afraid to say it I I I don't want you to
[1:26:49] be afraid to say it I don't have the
[1:26:51] inter interpretation of it I just know
[1:26:54] it exists because the angel of the Lord
[1:26:56] said so he showed it to the prophet and
[1:27:00] this great T vision and so you could say
[1:27:03] well brother Israel is going to happen
[1:27:05] just exactly like this or it hasn't
[1:27:07] happened yet or um when it happens this
[1:27:11] and this and this can and all of those
[1:27:13] things can absolutely be true and you
[1:27:16] still not see it happen that's right oh
[1:27:20] yes because God
[1:27:22] it is the one who's going to interpret
[1:27:24] his word the way he's uh wants it to
[1:27:28] happen how it's going to take place um
[1:27:31] the same thing with the third pool now
[1:27:33] you know with the with with the with the
[1:27:35] vision of the tent the tent Vision that
[1:27:37] brother brandom had in his life in his
[1:27:40] ministry I mean that those are visions
[1:27:44] that he spoke of and those are uh
[1:27:47] portions of the word that he said with
[1:27:50] was thus sayeth the Lord Lord and I
[1:27:53] believe it's it's more our attitude
[1:27:57] towards
[1:27:58] it more than what our understanding is
[1:28:01] of
[1:28:03] it what is your attitude towards it you
[1:28:07] know I I make that statement and
[1:28:09] immediately there's there in a certain
[1:28:11] group maybe not here in a certain group
[1:28:13] it'll tighten up oh what you trying to
[1:28:14] say well what do you mean I what I'm
[1:28:16] trying to say I I'm I'm quoting a vision
[1:28:20] of the prophet and so my attitude should
[1:28:23] be you know what that's what he said if
[1:28:26] you don't know what he said find out
[1:28:28] what he said and then we can at least
[1:28:30] agree that that's what he said shake my
[1:28:32] hand that's what he said now it did
[1:28:36] happen you might disagree is it you
[1:28:39] might say it's this version or it's not
[1:28:42] spiritual or it's not literal you can
[1:28:44] take all the position you want but I
[1:28:46] believe that we have to start with
[1:28:47] saying that you know this is what he
[1:28:49] said and I believe it's more our
[1:28:54] attitude towards it than it is our
[1:28:57] understanding of it and God can very
[1:29:00] well take this one I take the I I use
[1:29:02] the tent Vision because that's one of
[1:29:04] the hottest topics out there right and I
[1:29:08] like my food
[1:29:10] hot but but we like to take those and
[1:29:13] and so it's it uh we God can very well
[1:29:17] take that and do it in a way that you
[1:29:20] missed it
[1:29:24] that's
[1:29:25] right now your faith maybe didn't miss
[1:29:28] it and you believed it all along but God
[1:29:31] can do it and you not know that that's
[1:29:34] what he was doing or that's how he did
[1:29:37] it we've seen it over and over again I'm
[1:29:39] going to take a an example or two here
[1:29:42] just on this part I feel a little
[1:29:44] tightening up here and
[1:29:47] so that's when I know I'm maybe doing
[1:29:50] something good maybe
[1:29:53] I don't know let's
[1:29:55] see don't nobody leave now all
[1:29:59] right here what the prophet of God says
[1:30:02] here's here's what the Bible says in
[1:30:04] Matthew chapter
[1:30:06] 17 in in regards to the ministry of John
[1:30:11] the Baptist remember they were all
[1:30:14] looking for John the Baptist to come
[1:30:17] that's right they were all waiting for
[1:30:20] Elijah to come and to restore all things
[1:30:23] they hadn't had one for 400 years so you
[1:30:28] think that you know us looking for him
[1:30:31] when he comes we will catch him and when
[1:30:34] this Great Mighty messenger comes and
[1:30:38] The Valleys will be brought up high and
[1:30:40] the mountains will be brought down low
[1:30:43] he will thoroughly Purge the floor he'll
[1:30:46] come through and he'll burn it up it's a
[1:30:49] like a it's a tremendous Ministry going
[1:30:52] to come and so these True Believers true
[1:30:55] disciples had these quotations yes had
[1:30:58] these scriptures had these quotes of the
[1:31:02] prophet Isaiah that there would be a
[1:31:05] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[1:31:07] are you looking for him yes here's my
[1:31:10] quote here's my stand and here Matthew
[1:31:13] chapter 17 and his disciples asked him
[1:31:16] saying why then say the scribes that
[1:31:19] Elias must first come
[1:31:22] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:31:24] Elias truly shall first come and restore
[1:31:27] all
[1:31:28] things but I say unto you that Elias has
[1:31:32] come
[1:31:33] already and they knew him not but have
[1:31:38] done unto him whatsoever they
[1:31:40] listed likewise shall also the son of
[1:31:44] man suffer of them then the disciples
[1:31:47] understood that he spake unto them of of
[1:31:52] who that's who he was talking that's who
[1:31:56] John the Baptist was you know I heard he
[1:31:59] was preaching over there and I didn't
[1:32:01] even go I was too busy mama and then
[1:32:04] went to that meeting and they said
[1:32:05] something about this man drowning people
[1:32:08] and he's all hairy he looks wild he
[1:32:10] ain't took a bath he don't have no Coury
[1:32:12] caller talking about snakes and Serv
[1:32:15] grandma and then was talking about yeah
[1:32:17] we heard about it but I was over here
[1:32:18] trying to work on my career and I was
[1:32:21] over here trying to do whatever I was we
[1:32:23] heard about that and then finally we
[1:32:25] come to find out that this was
[1:32:27] Elijah yeah this was
[1:32:29] him they finally understood that this
[1:32:32] was John this John Was Elijah the one
[1:32:36] that was coming in fulfillment of what
[1:32:40] Isaiah had told them and so we know that
[1:32:44] the Lord can allow these things to take
[1:32:48] place even we can miss them now I don't
[1:32:51] want you to misunderstand me I'm not I'm
[1:32:53] not telling you not to believe the word
[1:32:56] as it is spoken that is what you must do
[1:33:00] the word says it you believe it there's
[1:33:02] no explanation the No Greater
[1:33:05] explanation that you have to come up
[1:33:07] with you just have to believe it that's
[1:33:09] what he said he said it you know does it
[1:33:11] make sense but that's what the word says
[1:33:13] and we stand on that so I want you to I
[1:33:15] want you to hold that faith and believe
[1:33:17] it with all your heart and know that we
[1:33:21] are in in a day of Grace and we know
[1:33:24] that that Grace time clock is winding
[1:33:28] up but we know that also there is a
[1:33:31] Rapture coming and will come to pass and
[1:33:34] the scenarios and the events for the
[1:33:37] Rapture to come to pass can happen
[1:33:41] outside of your understanding believe
[1:33:43] that it could take place without your
[1:33:46] knowledge of it and also knowing that
[1:33:50] there is a rapture coming to pass
[1:33:52] knowing that we're in the last days we
[1:33:55] realize that the Rapture happens just
[1:33:58] before the great destruction before
[1:34:01] Israel gets its gospel message so we see
[1:34:04] that there is a a very small portion in
[1:34:08] time that this uh coming of the Lord or
[1:34:12] the last day church is going to be
[1:34:15] manifested or Christ calling away his
[1:34:18] bride we know that before the rapture
[1:34:21] there uh H uh uh before the coming of
[1:34:24] the Lord is the rapture of the church
[1:34:26] before Israel receives the message of
[1:34:29] Grace there is the rapture of there's a
[1:34:32] great catching away we know that that's
[1:34:34] the time frame we're aware of
[1:34:37] that and so let's take the message here
[1:34:40] for for a
[1:34:43] moment and let's see what the prophet of
[1:34:45] God says here about you know things that
[1:34:49] are happening now
[1:34:58] you know something how our Sunday school
[1:35:00] ended up on that quote in the second
[1:35:03] seal paragraph 183 things that are
[1:35:06] happening now but this is in the message
[1:35:07] handwriting on the wall he's uh relaying
[1:35:12] what happened in Daniel there chapter
[1:35:15] 5 um and this great uh party or banquet
[1:35:19] that's taking place and we see this hand
[1:35:23] come out of nowhere and begins to
[1:35:25] inscribe on the wall it shook the king
[1:35:28] up he he he was shaking his in his boots
[1:35:32] is what we were saying his bones and
[1:35:34] joints began to shake as he saw this
[1:35:37] hand this Supernatural hand write a
[1:35:41] supernatural language on the wall he
[1:35:45] couldn't understand what was going on
[1:35:47] but it shook him up it caught his
[1:35:49] attention paragraph 84 and handwriting
[1:35:52] on the wall he says what's going to
[1:35:53] happen there's a sputnick up there and
[1:35:56] what would happen the nation would
[1:35:59] surrender of course that's the only
[1:36:02] decent thing the government could do
[1:36:04] then what happens wave after wave of
[1:36:06] shiploads of soldiers wave after wave of
[1:36:09] airplanes would land in this nation the
[1:36:12] women would be ravished in the streets
[1:36:14] what would you do it belongs to them
[1:36:17] kicked out of your homes they will take
[1:36:19] it over what will happen to you young
[1:36:21] girls and you young men and all of you
[1:36:24] at that time sin has to be paid
[1:36:28] for no matter what nation it is or who
[1:36:31] it is it does it individually or a
[1:36:36] nation is going to be paid for and a
[1:36:39] bunch of brutal ungodly whisker jawed
[1:36:42] communistic soldiers would grab your
[1:36:44] wives ravish them your young girls and
[1:36:47] you stand and and and and there's
[1:36:50] nothing you can do about it what causes
[1:36:53] that question mark because you have
[1:36:56] listened to such stuff as these
[1:36:58] television programs on rock and roll in
[1:37:01] sin and some cold formal preacher not
[1:37:05] able to interpret the
[1:37:07] supernatural the handwriting is on the
[1:37:10] wall that's right and we are weighed in
[1:37:13] the balance and found wanting when could
[1:37:17] that take place before daylight in the
[1:37:21] morning who's going to stop it try it
[1:37:26] the Bible says it'll happen but let me
[1:37:28] tell you that'll never touch the Church
[1:37:31] of the Living God will be gone by that
[1:37:34] time so friends listen if that thing is
[1:37:37] so close and we see see the handwriting
[1:37:39] on the wall there's nothing can stop
[1:37:41] this thing from happening now America
[1:37:44] has been preached to the supernatural's
[1:37:47] been done and continually they weighed
[1:37:49] right on over the top of it go to a
[1:37:53] country somewhere or hold a Revival and
[1:37:55] have 40 converts in a week go back in 6
[1:37:58] weeks you don't have four the Old Pond
[1:38:01] has been s dry God is just so many he
[1:38:06] God God just has so many he's elected
[1:38:10] and when that last one is in that closes
[1:38:14] the door and it's
[1:38:16] over then there's nothing left but
[1:38:18] judgment when mercy has been spurn and
[1:38:22] here we are at the end of the road The
[1:38:24] Supernaturals being done it's been
[1:38:26] laughed at made fun of in the last thing
[1:38:29] God has come in his own power in his own
[1:38:32] beloved Son to work through his church
[1:38:35] and they say it's spiritualism or the
[1:38:37] devil what else can be left but judgment
[1:38:42] and here's the handwriting on the wall
[1:38:45] but but what but if that is that close
[1:38:49] and any teacher knows that the church
[1:38:50] goes in the Rapture before the
[1:38:52] tribulation sets in so if it if it is
[1:38:56] that
[1:38:57] close could happen before morning so if
[1:39:01] that is that close could happen before
[1:39:03] morning what about the Rapture it's
[1:39:07] closer than
[1:39:09] that oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:39:12] the coming of the Lord is at hand the
[1:39:14] writing is written and it's written in
[1:39:17] the Bible and we're living to see it now
[1:39:21] I want you to think about that church
[1:39:23] the handwriting is on the
[1:39:25] wall the handwriting of judgment is on
[1:39:29] the wall and only the spiritual people
[1:39:33] can read the
[1:39:35] handwriting Daniel had to be called into
[1:39:38] the king's chamber or King's house to
[1:39:42] interpret what the handwriting on the
[1:39:44] wall
[1:39:45] said it shook them up they knew it was
[1:39:48] Supernatural but they couldn't interpret
[1:39:50] it they didn't know what it was so
[1:39:52] Daniel comes and he interprets it to
[1:39:55] them King your days are numbered King
[1:39:58] You've Been weighed King you've been
[1:40:01] found
[1:40:02] wanting King uh the Persians are coming
[1:40:06] to get you brother random says they had
[1:40:08] already started to dig and reroute the
[1:40:11] Euphrates river to to travel under those
[1:40:14] great big walls because they were so
[1:40:16] secure in their Nation they didn't know
[1:40:19] that judgment had already come their way
[1:40:22] and they're busy
[1:40:24] partying and they're upping the party if
[1:40:27] it was I mean it's one thing you're
[1:40:29] partying but now let's go to the house
[1:40:31] of the Lord and get the delicate things
[1:40:34] from Jerusalem and let's don't drink out
[1:40:37] of our cups let's drink out of those
[1:40:39] cups and it just raised up the
[1:40:41] disrespect for God and that's exactly
[1:40:45] what we see taking place today we see
[1:40:48] this disrespect towards God towards the
[1:40:51] word towards Holiness towards
[1:40:55] righteousness and we see that that great
[1:40:58] um the the the animosity towards
[1:41:01] anything that's
[1:41:04] holy and this is where the king finds
[1:41:07] himself with the handwriting on the wall
[1:41:10] and an interpretation had to come
[1:41:13] somebody spiritual had to say this is
[1:41:15] what time it is you all are partying you
[1:41:19] all are having a great time but this is
[1:41:20] is what time it is King you're waiting
[1:41:23] to balance and you're found
[1:41:25] wanting you're waiting we looked at your
[1:41:27] vessel you a got no oil in there it's
[1:41:31] lamp trimming time it's time to fill
[1:41:34] your oil your vessels up with oil that's
[1:41:37] what time it is it's time to get ready
[1:41:41] for the coming of the
[1:41:43] Lord that's what time it is it's not a
[1:41:46] time to you know jump around and argue
[1:41:49] with folks right maybe that was a day
[1:41:52] that wasn't a time to gather the message
[1:41:54] and see how much how many tapes we got
[1:41:56] we already got the tapes now now what
[1:41:59] time is it it's lamp trimming time it's
[1:42:03] ripening the grain time it's maturing
[1:42:07] time and King you've been found
[1:42:12] wanting I'm going to deal with this
[1:42:14] judgment just for a minute but the
[1:42:17] prophet of God continues in the message
[1:42:19] indictment and he says here paragraph
[1:42:22] 259 now to you here just in closing now
[1:42:26] pay close attention see I know it's hot
[1:42:29] I'm hot too but oh brother this word is
[1:42:31] life if you hold to it look it's not
[1:42:35] something we talk about that may happen
[1:42:39] here and after it's something that's
[1:42:43] already here with us and happening
[1:42:47] now not something will be something
[1:42:50] something that's already we're not
[1:42:53] testifying we know what he has done we
[1:42:57] know what he's going to do but now we're
[1:43:00] telling what he is doing see this is our
[1:43:08] hour whose hour is it it's our hour it's
[1:43:12] our
[1:43:14] time this is your time my brother to
[1:43:16] wake
[1:43:17] up we may not live to see the rapture
[1:43:20] may die today you may die today I don't
[1:43:23] know but the Rapture is coming amen
[1:43:28] that's when that comes we'll be there
[1:43:31] don't worry uhhuh so will all the rest
[1:43:33] of them back there Through the Ages
[1:43:35] that's believed it and look for it they
[1:43:37] walked in the light of their day and
[1:43:40] here is the light Jesus Christ the same
[1:43:43] yesterday today and forever forsake your
[1:43:46] Creeds and believe his word this is the
[1:43:50] truth
[1:43:51] so we're not talking about something
[1:43:52] that will come something that might come
[1:43:55] we're talking about something that is
[1:43:56] here now happening is the way the
[1:44:00] prophet phrased it all right we're in
[1:44:03] that time of what's of things that are
[1:44:07] taking place that are happening right
[1:44:09] now okay so the prophet continues on in
[1:44:13] the message when their eyes were open
[1:44:15] and he says this
[1:44:19] here paragraph number
[1:44:25] 15 I think that's a whole lot like
[1:44:29] today that many times we'll accept some
[1:44:32] things that Jesus has said but not all
[1:44:36] the things that he
[1:44:38] said people sometimes get say well we
[1:44:41] believe this but we don't believe this
[1:44:44] well you can't believe this without
[1:44:46] believing this see You've Got to Believe
[1:44:50] it all it's either all God or it isn't
[1:44:54] any God and so it all must be fitted in
[1:44:59] right in its place amen and as I said
[1:45:02] last evening God has alloted that his
[1:45:06] scriptures from the beginning before
[1:45:09] there was any before there was any time
[1:45:11] when he was eternal he is the Eternal
[1:45:15] one then these things that's happening
[1:45:17] now are only the attributes of God's
[1:45:21] thinking at first it has to be a thought
[1:45:24] then a word and a word when a thought
[1:45:27] Express is a word then it's spoken it
[1:45:30] has to happen and the whole thing is God
[1:45:33] unfolding himself in his attributes than
[1:45:37] God being made material tangible that we
[1:45:39] can talk to speak with in his whole
[1:45:42] church body and everything Therefore
[1:45:46] your name was in his thinking that's how
[1:45:48] you have eternal life you can't have it
[1:45:50] no other way you got to have eternal
[1:45:52] life you
[1:45:54] always was how many can say praise the
[1:45:57] Lord because you always was and God
[1:46:01] allotted the time take a scripture in
[1:46:04] Acts chapter 17 quickly I want to read
[1:46:07] that for
[1:46:11] you Acts chapter
[1:46:17] 17 believe it's what I want
[1:46:36] Paul speaking here in verse 22 then Paul
[1:46:39] stood in the midst of Mars Hill and said
[1:46:41] ye men of Athens I perceive that in all
[1:46:44] things you are too
[1:46:47] superstitious that word means religious
[1:46:49] the same word word is used through in
[1:46:51] another place in the Bible they're too
[1:46:53] religious superstitious for as I pass by
[1:46:56] and behold your devotions I found an
[1:46:59] altar with this inscri inscription to
[1:47:02] the unknown
[1:47:04] God whom therefore you ignorantly
[1:47:07] worship Him declare I unto you God that
[1:47:11] made the world and all things therein
[1:47:14] seeing that he is the Lord of Heaven and
[1:47:17] Earth dwelleth not in temples made with
[1:47:20] hand
[1:47:21] neither is worship with men's hands as
[1:47:23] though he needed anything seeing he
[1:47:26] giveth it to give it to all life and
[1:47:29] breath and all things hath made one
[1:47:33] blood all nations of men for to dwell on
[1:47:37] the face of the Earth and hath
[1:47:39] determined the times before appointed
[1:47:43] and the bounds of their habitation that
[1:47:47] they should seek the Lord as happily
[1:47:49] they might feel at after him and find
[1:47:51] him though he be not far from every one
[1:47:55] of us so it's the Lord that made all men
[1:47:59] with one blood it's not a three or four
[1:48:02] different kinds of blood he makes all
[1:48:05] men with one blood and he made all
[1:48:08] nations and he set their bounds and he
[1:48:12] gave them their
[1:48:13] habitations and it's the Lord that
[1:48:15] appointed the Nations and the
[1:48:17] separations and the things that we see
[1:48:19] today all of the Nations it's not one
[1:48:23] nation greater than another Nation God
[1:48:25] is the father of all of the Nations and
[1:48:28] he with one blood made all these nations
[1:48:31] and he set their
[1:48:33] habitation so happily that you can find
[1:48:36] him but you know in these he's in
[1:48:41] thessalonia um verse one he's coming to
[1:48:45] thessalonica and then he he's preaching
[1:48:47] the word for three days three sabbaths
[1:48:49] rather and they they they they beat they
[1:48:51] come after him and then he goes to the
[1:48:53] Berean and we read that scripture before
[1:48:56] how the bereans took the word and
[1:48:57] examine the word and then they started
[1:49:00] to follow him and he he comes into this
[1:49:02] place where they had an incription to
[1:49:04] the unknown God these people were
[1:49:07] worshiping
[1:49:09] ignorantly they didn't know who they
[1:49:11] were worshiping and that's that's not
[1:49:13] our God that we serve God wants us to
[1:49:16] know him and He makes himself known by
[1:49:20] revealing himself to us and when we come
[1:49:23] to him we don't know everything but we
[1:49:26] know enough on how to serve him as he
[1:49:29] reveals himself to us amen he's not the
[1:49:33] unknown God he doesn't have an unknown
[1:49:36] name we know his name it's been revealed
[1:49:39] to us his name is Jesus the Lord Jesus
[1:49:43] Christ and so God has allotted the
[1:49:46] scripture from the beginning before
[1:49:48] there was any time when he was Eternal
[1:49:51] so God allots the scripture he all Lots
[1:49:54] the season and then he begins to reveal
[1:49:57] himself continue in the message a man
[1:49:59] ranning from the presence of the
[1:50:04] Lord Brother Ram talking about the
[1:50:06] Pentecostals that receive the
[1:50:08] restoration of the gifts and the baptism
[1:50:10] of the Holy Ghost come out speaking in
[1:50:12] tongues paragraph 60 and when you see
[1:50:15] then in this day now when the word of
[1:50:19] God has made the these promises of these
[1:50:21] things that we see happening now then
[1:50:23] we've got the responsibility to either
[1:50:26] face up to it or get away from
[1:50:29] it you have you just can't stay neutral
[1:50:34] you got to do something about it some
[1:50:37] move has got to be made you can't come
[1:50:41] in that church door and go out the same
[1:50:43] person you come in you either further
[1:50:46] away or closer to God every time you
[1:50:49] come in or go out there oh how easy it
[1:50:53] is for people to Sher these things and I
[1:50:57] want us to think of these things when we
[1:50:58] start into the official Services
[1:51:01] tomorrow so brother bam continues on
[1:51:05] that we can't stay
[1:51:08] neutral we have to take a
[1:51:10] stand we have to redeem the
[1:51:13] time we have to go forward in what God
[1:51:17] has revealed and showed to us and we
[1:51:20] know that the Rapture is going to happen
[1:51:23] it will take place and all we know is
[1:51:28] Mercy side the mercy side longsuffering
[1:51:31] longsuffering longu the the the the
[1:51:34] websites continue to grow anti- word
[1:51:38] anti- god anti- message and they seem to
[1:51:42] continue on the the unbelief seems to
[1:51:46] Foster and grow greater and you taking a
[1:51:49] step stand for what is right you can't
[1:51:53] man hardly pray in public if you own a
[1:51:56] big company or Corporation somebody's
[1:51:58] going to be offended a couple years ago

[1:52:26] word either but I was reading a quote in
[1:52:28] the prayer brother abam says God forgive
[1:52:30] our
[1:52:31] stupidity that's what the prophet said
[1:52:33] and so I took that that there's some
[1:52:35] stupidity on our part I'm looking at
[1:52:37] myself now I'm not looking at nobody
[1:52:39] there's some stupidity on our part but
[1:52:41] how's a man going to end up prayer in a
[1:52:44] man or a
[1:52:46] woman y'all get it
[1:52:51] somebody else say
[1:52:53] it's y'all thinking
[1:52:55] it that's what it is it's like what what
[1:52:58] is he talking about a man then he says a
[1:53:01] woman so you you see that the
[1:53:04] handwriting is on the wall we see that
[1:53:06] this is just it's just going to get
[1:53:09] crazier and crazier when it comes to our
[1:53:12] our rights and our love for the lord
[1:53:15] it's going to stand out more and more
[1:53:17] right but we've been warned haven't
[1:53:20] amen and in one of the great warnings
[1:53:24] and signs of judgment was a prophecy
[1:53:27] given about
[1:53:30] California and I want to go into that
[1:53:33] just for a moment just to bring up
[1:53:36] before I finish up on what's Happening
[1:53:38] Now this great earthquake in Alaska that
[1:53:41] happened in
[1:53:44] 1964 uh March the 27th on a good
[1:53:47] Friday this coming March will be exactly
[1:53:50] 60 years that this took
[1:53:52] place now the nation knows it your
[1:53:55] history books Know It And The World At
[1:53:57] Large if you study earthquakes know
[1:54:00] exactly what that was on the RoR scale
[1:54:03] you can look it up it's very fine what
[1:54:05] the world don't know is what started the
[1:54:08] earthquake what they don't know was the
[1:54:10] Whirlwind that was
[1:54:12] spoken and they don't know that judgment
[1:54:16] was associated with it and we know that
[1:54:20] the Judgment the beginning of judgment
[1:54:23] has already
[1:54:25] started we're on the clock Saints let me
[1:54:27] read some quotations for you all right
[1:54:30] here the prophet of God in the message
[1:54:32] identify Christ of all ages
[1:54:36] 1964 paragraph number one he says we've
[1:54:39] enjoyed about 15 years Revival which
[1:54:42] according to history is longer than any
[1:54:44] Revival has ever lasted to my knowing
[1:54:47] usually a Revival lasts about 3 years
[1:54:49] didn't it get scattered but believing
[1:54:51] that this one is one of the last great
[1:54:55] revivals that the world will receive and
[1:54:58] it's come in the last Age The leod Dean
[1:55:03] age at the end of the Pentecostal
[1:55:07] dispensation and I believe that the
[1:55:09] church now is going out into its
[1:55:12] lukewarmness as the Bible predicted and
[1:55:16] we're seeing just the catching of the
[1:55:19] last part when we see things happening
[1:55:23] like has been happening in the world in
[1:55:26] the last few days for instance the great
[1:55:31] earthquake in Alaska never has been an
[1:55:34] earthquake like that and all the world
[1:55:36] did you notice it come on a good Friday
[1:55:40] you know the last time the world was
[1:55:42] shaking was on a good Friday too when
[1:55:44] our Master died and it shook the whole
[1:55:47] world and remember it might be the sign
[1:55:50] of him returning he said that there
[1:55:53] would be earthquakes in diverse places
[1:55:56] today we got another one in California
[1:55:59] they're just appearing everywhere light
[1:56:01] earthquakes we notice even the Capitol
[1:56:04] building has moved out of its place and
[1:56:06] move back and down here in Baton Rouge
[1:56:08] and Louisiana there's a swimming pool
[1:56:11] there Dash the waters out from Plum from
[1:56:14] Alaska over into Switzerland Sweden and
[1:56:16] through there shook buildings and things
[1:56:18] around the world I believe that it's
[1:56:21] trying to open our eyes to see the hour
[1:56:26] that we're living I'm here in Godly fear
[1:56:30] that it may be sooner than we think of
[1:56:33] his appearing now who you going to
[1:56:35] listen to Saints are you going to listen
[1:56:37] to the media or the news to tell you
[1:56:40] what time it is are you going to listen
[1:56:42] to a Vindicated Prophet to tell you what
[1:56:44] time it is he was s to tell us what time
[1:56:47] it was and he believed that we're living
[1:56:51] in the last closing we seen the last
[1:56:53] part of these things this is not just
[1:56:57] news so we can talk about it I wonder if
[1:57:01] some of our sometimes our our prayer
[1:57:03] requests isn't just news to some so we
[1:57:07] can know what's going on in the next
[1:57:08] group or the next Church hey so and so
[1:57:11] this was going on you know so die hey
[1:57:13] wait did you
[1:57:14] pray did you pray about that's what that
[1:57:17] was for it's a prayer
[1:57:20] request it's not a rumor tag it's not
[1:57:23] something just to talk about did you
[1:57:28] pray you know how we are we're very
[1:57:30] interested in knowing what other people
[1:57:32] are going
[1:57:33] through we gossip and then we try to
[1:57:38] sprinkle keep them in prayer after we
[1:57:40] finish

[1:57:59] of the service but we didn't get there
[1:58:00] yet we talking about
[1:58:03] Grace all right but look at this this
[1:58:07] earthquake in 1964 brother R is going to
[1:58:09] identify to us what's going on and the
[1:58:12] media and and the World At Large
[1:58:14] California they can identify what it was
[1:58:17] let the prophet identify to us what it
[1:58:19] was he continues in the message who do
[1:58:21] you say this
[1:58:23] is paragraph 156 watch what taking place
[1:58:27] walking along not just by yourself man
[1:58:30] along with you see a cluster of angels
[1:58:32] come from the heavens shake the whole
[1:58:35] earth just stand there and the
[1:58:37] newspapers write it up when it's
[1:58:40] predicted months and months before H
[1:58:43] hands would take
[1:58:45] place there he stood there and said the
[1:58:48] time is at hand return back open the
[1:58:51] Seven Seals of mystery that's been hid
[1:58:54] all through the reformations and things
[1:58:56] bring it out then comes preaching
[1:58:59] serpent seed and all these things and
[1:59:01] what does the clergy do instead of
[1:59:03] saying why Luther said this such they
[1:59:06] just they'll never see it see but what a
[1:59:10] privileg privilege it is for us who
[1:59:13] believe to walk in the presence of God
[1:59:16] every
[1:59:18] day stand there and see a whirl wouldn't
[1:59:20] come out of the sky it blowed a mountain
[1:59:23] half in Two standing there where we was
[1:59:25] at cut the top of the trees off and
[1:59:27] things like that and a blast of word
[1:59:30] come out and shook there three times
[1:59:33] said watch it go to the West Coast went
[1:59:35] right over there shook down Alaska
[1:59:38] coming right down the West Coast now
[1:59:41] just exactly day before I took a rock
[1:59:46] and I threw it up in the air and said
[1:59:49] thus sayith the Lord the hour is here
[1:59:53] judgments will start in the earth so
[1:59:57] who's telling us this these are the
[2:00:00] judgments that are starting in the Earth
[2:00:03] where does it start there's a rock
[2:00:05] thrown up in the air and that rock going
[2:00:08] up and coming down started a little
[2:00:11] Whirlwind that was the day
[2:00:14] before you got to know where you're
[2:00:16] at so glad we know where we're at
[2:00:19] that it was a messenger that started
[2:00:22] that it was an angel you go through your
[2:00:26] Through the Bible and Revelation it's
[2:00:28] the angel that declares many of the
[2:00:30] judgments and woes they pronounce those
[2:00:33] woes in judgment just like Elijah he
[2:00:36] pronounced there be a famine and then he
[2:00:39] pronounced that there would be a Revival
[2:00:41] in rain it's always a man on the earth
[2:00:44] that God
[2:00:48] uses that's good right
[2:00:53] yes you take the crime reports and you
[2:00:56] can see they'll tell you crimes is doing
[2:00:59] better here and we cracked down on
[2:01:01] crimes we started a new you know uh a
[2:01:04] team or a new drug task force and we

[2:01:09] area crack down on crimes on that area
[2:01:12] judgments have already begin in the
[2:01:14] earth brother bam continues in the
[2:01:17] message of man running from the presence
[2:01:18] of the Lord Lord he says this here
[2:01:20] paragraph 88 while I was standing there
[2:01:23] the Lord said show me what was going to
[2:01:25] happen judgment is fixing to strike the
[2:01:29] West Coast he said get over here there

[2:02:20] tops of the trees off and the Rocks went
[2:02:23] out and went up into the air and come
[2:02:25] down again with another big baptism and
[2:02:28] struck across the mountain and throw the
[2:02:30] rocks out like that did it three times

[2:03:56] message yes sir actually we're believing
[2:03:59] it more I want something else to happen
[2:04:04] to shake off all the fake
[2:04:06] Believers expose them right yes the cup
[2:04:11] of iniquity has to fill the prophet of
[2:04:14] God continues in this day this scripture
[2:04:16] is fulfilled let me take this scripture
[2:04:18] let me take this quote for you
[2:04:20] here and and I know and trusted to be a
[2:04:23] blessing to you here what the prophet of
[2:04:25] God says here paragraph 165 are you
[2:04:28] there this morning the Seven Seals of
[2:04:31] the Hidden Mysteries of the entire Bible
[2:04:34] will be open and fulfill Revelations 10
[2:04:37] that is in the seventh Angel's message
[2:04:40] these things should come to pass this
[2:04:41] day the scripture is fulfilled before
[2:04:44] our eyes this day the scripture is
[2:04:46] fulfilled last year St standing in the
[2:04:49] same place Mr wood here and I going up
[2:04:52] the hill in kind of a a morning about
[2:04:55] kind of in a morning about his wife
[2:04:56] being sick the holy spirit said pick up
[2:04:59] a rock laying there throw it up in the
[2:05:01] air when it comes down say thus sayeth
[2:05:06] the
[2:05:07] Lord there will be judgment strike the
[2:05:10] Earth tell him that he'll see the hand
[2:05:13] of God the next few hours I told Mr wood
[2:05:16] he's present tonight I guess eight or 10
[2:05:18] of the men or 15 that was there at that
[2:05:21] time when he took place the next morning
[2:05:24] when the Lord came down in a whirlwind
[2:05:27] ripped the mountain around us and cut
[2:05:30] the tops of the trees loose and made
[2:05:32] three blast and said judgment is headed
[2:05:35] towards the west coast and look what he
[2:05:37] says two days after that Alaska almost
[2:05:40] sunk beneath the Earth and since then up
[2:05:45] and down the coast the belches of God 's
[2:05:49] judgment against that spiritual
[2:05:52] scream there is an iron curtain there is
[2:05:55] a bamboo curtain and there is a normally
[2:05:59] he would say a purple
[2:06:01] curtain but here he says it's a sin
[2:06:05] curtain which is tied into the purple
[2:06:09] curtain because Rome will rule the
[2:06:12] world remember Adolf Hitler he wasn't
[2:06:16] persecuting the Jews because the law of
[2:06:19] Moses he was persecuting the Jews
[2:06:22] because of his racist views towards them
[2:06:25] his blood was different than the Jewish
[2:06:29] blood his blood he wanted a pure race
[2:06:33] and in Acts chapter 17 we read for you
[2:06:35] there that God made all blood for all
[2:06:38] nations but his was just pure cruel
[2:06:42] hearted towards against those people
[2:06:45] they were different than him same thing
[2:06:47] with musolini and all their hatred but
[2:06:50] brother vanam shows us that that spirit
[2:06:53] that was on him is the same spirit that
[2:06:56] was on the Romans that crucified Jesus
[2:07:01] because it's an evil spirit so you see
[2:07:03] evil out there and the evil powers out
[2:07:05] there they're not bothering us today
[2:07:07] religious wise but they're
[2:07:09] coming they're
[2:07:12] coming amen and the prophet is now
[2:07:16] identifying you talk about this group of
[2:07:17] men brother Glenn Were You There Brother
[2:07:20] Glenn's a witness of one of those that
[2:07:22] was there in that group I think I saw
[2:07:24] his picture he hasn't aged one bit he
[2:07:26] looks exactly the same I was just
[2:07:29] thinking that he's here with us this
[2:07:31] morning eyewitness these things are true
[2:07:35] you know our eyewitnesses are leaving us
[2:07:37] today but it's still the
[2:07:39] truth here brother man was talking about
[2:07:42] a couple days before he throws up a rock
[2:07:46] you think Time Magazine knows this part
[2:07:49] you think people that study the
[2:07:50] earthquake do they know this part you
[2:07:53] think people that was in the Alaskan
[2:07:55] earthquake did you think they knew this
[2:07:57] part right here there is a little humble
[2:08:00] man from where where is he from

[2:08:29] over there come on somebody they lifted
[2:08:33] him up on a high place on Earth you were
[2:08:36] a leader not a leader to everybody but a
[2:08:40] leader to people like me like

[2:08:47] in in heaven a huge portion awaits you
[2:08:52] for your stand on the word it is my
[2:08:57] way and the million said we're resting
[2:09:00] on that am good enough for me yes sir

[2:09:04] me little humble
[2:09:08] man just a poor guy one of us poor man
[2:09:14] from some Kentucky broken English no
[2:09:17] language skills
[2:09:19] and he's out there in the mountains
[2:09:20] there and the Lord tells him to throw up
[2:09:22] a rock he throws up the rock you can
[2:09:25] believe it or not I choose to believe it
[2:09:28] he throws up a rock and it comes down
[2:09:30] when he hits the ground say thus sayeth
[2:09:32] the Lord and judgment is striking the
[2:09:35] West Coast yes he sends that out into
[2:09:40] the atmosphere of
[2:09:42] Truth everybody can't hear it many
[2:09:46] didn't hear it until it was recorded
[2:09:47] later but it's still the word of Truth
[2:09:51] judgment is striking the West Coast can
[2:09:54] you hear it this
[2:09:56] morning praise the Lord
[2:10:00] amen oh
[2:10:03] my I'm
[2:10:07] believable
[2:10:08] yes can I go a little bit
[2:10:11] further can I have 10 more minutes cuz I
[2:10:13] don't trust that clock I think it's
[2:10:15] earlier than it's later I don't know I
[2:10:16] don't trust it
[2:10:19] thank you somebody tell me what time it
[2:10:21] is yes all right just a few more moments
[2:10:25] all right everybody don't smile like
[2:10:26] that I know that start talking about
[2:10:28] taking your time people start frowning
[2:10:31] and want their burrito or lunch or
[2:10:35] hamburger or whatever it
[2:10:37] is what say you know that g starts at
[2:10:40] one the game starts at one we ought to
[2:10:43] preach at least until
[2:10:45] 1:30
[2:10:46] right how many was say Amen to that it
[2:10:50] it well everybody ain't saying amen
[2:10:52] that's be honest that's all right yeah I
[2:10:54] see it I see you that's all right so
[2:10:57] here the prophet of God is now talking
[2:10:59] about this great earthquake in 1965 and
[2:11:03] look how he describes this this
[2:11:05] earthquake here and I'm going to close
[2:11:08] on this I had another Port I want to
[2:11:09] finish but I'm going to close on this he
[2:11:12] says first he identifies the Iron
[2:11:15] Curtain the bamboo curtain and then the
[2:11:17] sin curtain and which we were bringing
[2:11:19] out before that that's actually the
[2:11:22] purple curtain but here he calls it a
[2:11:24] sin curtain and he he directly
[2:11:27] identifies
[2:11:29] California and I want to say that we can
[2:11:32] say it because the prophet said it that
[2:11:34] California is going down
[2:11:36] Saints it's going down it's the word of
[2:11:41] the Lord and it might not happen in my
[2:11:44] generation that's the thing and it might
[2:11:47] not happen when I think is going to
[2:11:49] happen but the Declaration is still the
[2:11:52] same it's going down it's part of the
[2:11:57] Judgment that comes to this nation for
[2:12:00] rejecting god what happened in
[2:12:02] California some of the greatest
[2:12:04] Ministries ever the isusa Revival
[2:12:08] happened in California where God took a
[2:12:11] a onee black man and and groups of poor
[2:12:16] people poor blacks poor whites and
[2:12:19] people that were the outcasts of the big
[2:12:21] churches and he put his hand on
[2:12:26] them oh we can't go pray over there but
[2:12:29] when God puts his hand on you you will
[2:12:32] go there and get prayed for you go where
[2:12:36] God calls you to go and he he broke
[2:12:39] those
[2:12:40] lines of monetary and wealth and you

[2:12:46] that and he show know where he
[2:12:50] was prise the Lord so let God pick your
[2:12:56] church cuz you don't know how to pick
[2:12:59] one come on somebody help me preach just
[2:13:02] for a minute I try to pick a church it'd
[2:13:05] be a nice denominational church with
[2:13:07] more people in there that I can sit back
[2:13:09] and do nothing if I was going to pick a
[2:13:11] church I'll pick one in the right
[2:13:13] neighborhood like right around the
[2:13:14] corner from my house if I was going to
[2:13:16] pick a church I pick a church that has
[2:13:18] something to give me give me something
[2:13:20] make it you know you know something for
[2:13:22] me something to help me uh if I was
[2:13:25] going to pick a church I would pick one
[2:13:27] that kept me popular looking fine all
[2:13:30] the time no embarrassment don't bother
[2:13:34] me I won't if I was picking a church but
[2:13:36] God picked a church for me it's the
[2:13:40] Church of the Lord Jesus
[2:13:42] Christ and in that church I find
[2:13:46] Refuge I find strength I find the
[2:13:50] anointing I find the blessing of God I
[2:13:53] find a clean table to eat
[2:13:56] from why God chose the church that you
[2:14:01] Worship
[2:14:02] in and that's this message of the hour
[2:14:06] right
[2:14:07] Saints look at the how the prophet
[2:14:09] describes this in the choosing of the
[2:14:10] Bride I'm just going to land a plane
[2:14:12] right here is that all right
[2:14:14] okay when in the great hour
[2:14:18] that great monster laying up yonder that
[2:14:20] flipped over flipped himself over in
[2:14:23] Alaska a few days ago threw his tail up
[2:14:27] again this morning along about down
[2:14:31] around in Washington he could head this
[2:14:35] way Mighty easy and if the Holy Spirit
[2:14:39] ever tells me definitely so he's in the
[2:14:41] message choosing of a bride Excuse
[2:14:45] me yes he's in that message choosing of
[2:14:47] of the Bride in
[2:14:50] California he's talking about the
[2:14:52] earthquakes that had began and there was
[2:14:55] another one that happened and he's
[2:14:57] talking about like a monster he calls it
[2:15:00] a great
[2:15:01] monster and this monster flipped his
[2:15:03] tail over the monster still there
[2:15:06] there's a preacher looking out for
[2:15:08] another preacher thank you praise the
[2:15:11] Lord he knew what I was
[2:15:13] needing but the the the um he he he's
[2:15:17] talking about this Earth earthquake and
[2:15:18] the terminology he's using he calls it a
[2:15:22] monster we we haven't seen the monster
[2:15:24] flipy but you think that monster still
[2:15:26] dead is he dead or no is he still there
[2:15:31] oh he's going to flip one time sir he
[2:15:33] going to flip and the whole thing's
[2:15:34] going to slide in and there's a people
[2:15:37] that have been warned that's the part
[2:15:39] that is so beautiful there is a people
[2:15:42] that was on the inside of the inside of
[2:15:44] what's going on this is what the Alaska
[2:15:47] earthquake was all about it was judgment
[2:15:50] striking the West Coast because they
[2:15:53] rejected God and here this King in
[2:15:57] Daniel chapter
[2:15:59] 7 he takes the gold cups in his great
[2:16:03] party and he takes the holy things of
[2:16:06] God he didn't respect them and he
[2:16:08] started to party with them and then his
[2:16:10] days were number he didn't know his days
[2:16:12] were numbered the doors of his kingship
[2:16:16] was closing
[2:16:18] he had a little portion of Grace if he'
[2:16:21] have followed his grandfather he would
[2:16:23] have stayed with Daniel's religion but
[2:16:25] he got away from
[2:16:27] Nebuchadnezzar and he got into his own
[2:16:29] thing and he saw this thing and start
[2:16:31] shaking in his
[2:16:34] boots his wife one of the Queens come up
[2:16:37] to him and says oh there's a man in your
[2:16:40] kingdom that knows how to interpret this
[2:16:42] what's going on he calls all the
[2:16:45] astronomers and all the people what does
[2:16:46] that mean what does that mean we never
[2:16:47] we never seen that before what does it
[2:16:50] mean and the queen says there's a man
[2:16:53] here that knows these things so they
[2:16:54] call Daniel
[2:16:55] in it's like man you should have called
[2:16:59] him before but finally you get him in
[2:17:02] and Daniel comes in there faithful he
[2:17:04] he's seen these kingdoms come and go
[2:17:07] remember Daniel he was there at
[2:17:09] Nebuchadnezzar he's there with this King
[2:17:11] here he's even with King
[2:17:14] Darius God will preserve his own
[2:17:18] they change Powers all the time but God
[2:17:20] stayed with Daniel
[2:17:22] Amen cuz Daniel stayed with the word and
[2:17:25] Daniel begins to interpret to them like
[2:17:28] the message interprets to us what's
[2:17:32] really going do you know what time it is
[2:17:35] Saints do you know what time it is I'm
[2:17:38] not angry I'm just enthusi this morning
[2:17:42] to think about it the time that we're
[2:17:44] that we're in and here judgment has
[2:17:47] already started amen so he he says it
[2:17:50] that way and
[2:17:52] I'll get one or two more here right here
[2:17:56] in the message of shamed he says it like
[2:17:57] this paragraph 46 he said one day we
[2:18:01] brother wood when we come out there we
[2:18:03] went to the same place throw up a rock
[2:18:06] and come down he said within a day and
[2:18:09] night your some I forgot just what the
[2:18:13] words was you're going to see the glory
[2:18:15] of
[2:18:16] God and the next day a whirlwind came
[2:18:20] down out of the skies and we we know the
[2:18:23] story of what taking place when it went
[2:18:25] up they asked what it was I said it
[2:18:28] spoke three words in three great
[2:18:33] blasts the men only heard the
[2:18:35] blasting I understood what it said and
[2:18:39] said judgment striking West
[2:18:44] Coast that's what the he throws a rock
[2:18:46] up that's where the great blast takes
[2:18:49] place he's he as he's he says two days
[2:18:51] after that Alaska liked to have sunk
[2:18:55] It's been thundering around earthquakes
[2:18:58] everything just look at them every day
[2:19:00] earthquakes just shaking everywhere I
[2:19:03] got to get one or two more in here and
[2:19:06] I'll finish this all right talking about
[2:19:09] this Alaska earthquake I like how he
[2:19:12] frames it here in the message in the
[2:19:14] invisible Union of the Bride he said
[2:19:17] says this here paragraph 302 and
[2:19:20] everything has been said oh even to the
[2:19:22] destruction of California coming up now
[2:19:26] and all these other things and how I
[2:19:27] told them how many days it would be how
[2:19:30] it how it would be where this big
[2:19:32] earthquake happened in Alaska and that
[2:19:35] would be the beginning of the sign of
[2:19:39] time and what would take place and just
[2:19:42] word by word what it said it's never
[2:19:45] fell one time you never seen it fail and
[2:19:48] it can't fail because it's God's words
[2:19:51] and Heaven Earth will pass away but it
[2:19:54] can't
[2:19:55] fail that's
[2:19:58] right last quote on that he says in the
[2:20:02] message leadership 1965 this is December
[2:20:06] of
[2:20:07] 65 the Lord calls him home just a couple
[2:20:11] of weeks later he says look here do you
[2:20:13] know what the Lord says about Los
[2:20:14] Angeles in these places here she's
[2:20:19] gone you remember what I told you about
[2:20:24] two years ago how that earthquake would
[2:20:27] come in Canada up here Alaska I also
[2:20:30] tell you that Hollywood in Los Angeles
[2:20:33] is sliding into the ocean California
[2:20:36] you're
[2:20:38] doomed not only California but you world
[2:20:42] you're
[2:20:43] doomed Church unless you get right with
[2:20:47] God God your
[2:20:49] doom thus saith the Holy Spirit have you
[2:20:53] ever heard me use that name unless it
[2:20:56] come to pass ask you you know me 20
[2:20:59] years did I ever tell you anything in
[2:21:01] the name of the Lord but what come to
[2:21:03] pass it's everything I've ever told you
[2:21:06] would happen happen say
[2:21:12] Amen see I tell you now is the hour you
[2:21:16] better be getting right all of
[2:21:20] us now is the hour we better be getting
[2:21:25] right how many will take that warning
[2:21:27] this morning that we better be getting
[2:21:29] right can I close the service with a few
[2:21:32] scriptures but just take a couple
[2:21:34] scriptures in uh uh um Ephesians chapter
[2:21:40] 5 in Colossians chapter 4 those would be
[2:21:42] my last two scriptures Ephesians chapter
[2:21:46] 5 and I just say to you Saints here you
[2:21:50] can't stay neutral any
[2:21:54] longer you got to pick a
[2:21:58] side we have to make our
[2:22:01] stand
[2:22:06] uhhuh what scripture did I call
[2:22:09] Ephesians 5 verse number 14 wherefore he
[2:22:13] saith awake thou that sleepest
[2:22:17] and arise from the dead and Christ shall
[2:22:21] give thee light see then that you walk
[2:22:25] circumspectly not as fools but as
[2:22:30] wise Redeeming the time because the days
[2:22:34] are evil wherefore be ye not
[2:22:38] unwise but understanding what the will
[2:22:42] of the Lord
[2:22:44] is I
[2:22:46] like in the NIV verse1 15 it says be
[2:22:49] careful then how you live not as unwise
[2:22:52] but wise making the most of every
[2:22:56] opportunity because the days are evil
[2:23:00] that's that's Redeeming the time amen
[2:23:02] last one in Colossians chapter 4 1-6
[2:23:05] Masters give unto your servants that
[2:23:07] which is just and equal knowing that you
[2:23:11] also have a master in heaven how many
[2:23:14] have it there Colossians chapter 4

[2:23:24] same with Thanksgiving so you're praying
[2:23:28] you're watching and you're
[2:23:31] thankful with all praying also for us
[2:23:34] that God would open unto us a door of
[2:23:37] utterance to speak the mystery of Christ
[2:23:40] for which I am also in bonds that I may
[2:23:43] make it manifest as I ought to speak
[2:23:46] what walk in wisdom towards them that
[2:23:49] are without Redeeming the time let your
[2:23:53] speech be always with Grace seasoned
[2:23:56] with salt that you may know how you
[2:23:59] ought to answer every man
[2:24:03] amen that's our that's our our message
[2:24:07] that's our time that's our admonition to
[2:24:10] you so awake thou that
