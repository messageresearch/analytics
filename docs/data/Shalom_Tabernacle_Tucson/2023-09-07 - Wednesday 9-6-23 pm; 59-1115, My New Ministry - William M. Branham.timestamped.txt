[25:56] Saturday at uh up at uh in Phoenix there
[26:00] and brother Branham said now I'm just
[26:02] your brother but by the grace of God
[26:05] when the angel of the Lord moves down it
[26:07] becomes then a voice of God to you
[26:11] and he said maybe if I offended you by
[26:14] saying that forgive me if I felt that
[26:16] might have been resented but I am God's
[26:19] voice to you
[26:21] see I said that again that time was
[26:24] under inspiration you see he said I felt
[26:27] bad about it the first time but it
[26:30] repeated it now see I can say nothing in
[26:33] myself but what he shows me I say it you
[26:37] believe it and watch what happens
[26:41] amen so we don't we're not listening to
[26:43] the tape uh this this evening just by
[26:46] happenstance I believe it's
[26:48] predestinated tonight for us to hear
[26:49] this tape this evening and hear the
[26:52] voice of God speak to this church can
[26:54] you say Amen to that tonight so God

[27:43] Branham read the scripture of Saint Mark
[27:45] the 11th chapter where he talked about

[28:50] Prophet brother Branham
[28:55] [Music]
[28:58] the first time it was ever performed on
[29:01] a human being
[29:04] I said sister Hattie
[29:07] ask what you will
[29:11] God's going to give it to you
[29:15] man what do you think of that
[29:17] does it get into you
[29:20] seven times he had confirmed it by an
[29:23] animal seven is God's complete number
[29:27] here's the first time on a human being
[29:30] and he what did he choose some great
[29:33] risk to crap a great noted Minister a
[29:37] poor little woman that can hardly write
[29:40] her name
[29:43] God knows what he's doing
[29:45] said ask what you will
[29:49] Hattie said to me brother Benham what do
[29:51] you mean
[29:52] I said ask
[29:54] then your heart desires
[29:57] and it shall be produced right here that
[30:01] you'll know that the Lord God Of Heaven
[30:03] answers
[30:05] and his scriptures are true
[30:07] her first time with a new gift
[30:11] but first anointing
[30:13] I could hardly hear
[30:16] and she looked around we've been talking
[30:18] about her little sister
[30:21] I said oh no doubt in my heart within a
[30:24] few minutes little Edith will be jump
[30:26] into the glory of God
[30:28] had he looked around all around and she
[30:31] said brother Bill my greatest desire is
[30:34] for the Salvation of my two boys
[30:37] what up why there couldn't have been a
[30:40] greater thing she could have asked for
[30:42] ten thousand dollars she'd have got it
[30:46] what if they've been some millionaire
[30:48] would have asked for another million
[30:50] God no watches go to ask for
[30:53] Him Sister ahead of you at least a seven
[30:55] or eight Witnesses standing there all
[30:58] you people that was present and when
[30:59] that happened raise up your hands
[31:01] everybody in the building was present
[31:02] that happened one two three four five
[31:04] six seven seven of them eight of them
[31:08] eight of them was present
[31:11] when that happened I said ask anything
[31:14] you want to cause God's give it to me to
[31:17] give to you whatever you want
[31:19] she said her boys is beginning to go off
[31:22] on the teenage
[31:24] tantrum and she said the Salvation in my
[31:27] two boys
[31:28] I said wow the will of God follow the
[31:32] power of God I give you in the name of
[31:35] Jesus Christ your desire and her two
[31:37] boys shook under the power of God and
[31:40] that old building tremored Banks fell
[31:43] into his plate Shelby grab and Hattie
[31:46] screamed you could hear her for two
[31:47] blocks
[31:48] and them two boys with tears rolling
[31:51] down their cheeks received exactly what
[31:54] they asked
[31:57] him oh
[31:58] the first time it was ever used on a
[32:01] human being
[32:01] [Music]
[32:02] asked what you will
[32:06] and it shall be given unto you
[32:09] her boy's sitting there with her this
[32:11] morning
[32:12] why would she have asked what if she'd
[32:14] ask the healing of her little sister
[32:16] what I should ask then the little girl
[32:19] would have been healed but her two boys
[32:21] lost
[32:22] what if that poor Widow who just told me
[32:26] that she tried to give to this church
[32:28] fifty dollars
[32:30] on a pledge to help build a new church
[32:33] and brother Roberson wouldn't take it
[32:36] and only let her give 20 of it
[32:38] and I said to myself when she's speaking
[32:40] I'll give her back the 20 but God said
[32:44] to me in my heart now not my vision in
[32:47] my heart when Jesus was standing
[32:49] watching a widow putting three pennies
[32:52] or there was thousands of dollars laying
[32:55] what would you do and I said well if
[32:57] I've been standing up said we don't need
[32:58] it sister we got plenty of money but
[33:00] Jesus never said it he let her go on and
[33:03] do it
[33:04] because he know what was down the road
[33:07] so help me God
[33:09] is by Solomon judge God knew that was
[33:12] down the road for her
[33:15] I run my hand in my pocket to get my
[33:17] pocketbook to give her her twenty
[33:19] dollars Bank say sister Hattie but he
[33:20] said don't do it
[33:22] then a few minutes from the questions
[33:24] part about Jehovah Jireh she said that's
[33:27] nothing but the truth
[33:29] and it comes from a poor widow woman's
[33:32] heart
[33:34] God knowing she'd asked the greatest
[33:36] thing could be done as long as there is
[33:39] the heaven when the stars is gone when
[33:42] there's no more moon no more Earth no
[33:45] more sea them boys shall live on through
[33:49] eternity
[33:51] with the same Jehovah Jireh who gave the
[33:54] immortal promise
[33:57] his promises cannot fail
[34:01] looking forward for the coming of this
[34:03] meeting down here in San Jose
[34:05] oh if it'll just break forth
[34:08] now when the anointing strikes s what
[34:12] you will
[34:13] I have a perfect assurance that will not
[34:16] strikes and whatever God puts to be
[34:18] asked it'll be just exactly that way
[34:21] it has to be or if you say to this man I
[34:25] see it isn't you speaking
[34:28] it isn't you it's God
[34:30] it's you so so submitted to God now
[34:34] watch the prophets of old when we're
[34:36] closing
[34:37] the prophets of old
[34:39] one day we're seeing the coming of the
[34:41] Lord Jesus
[34:42] they were so in the spirit until they
[34:45] spoke as if it was themselves
[34:47] look at David
[34:49] in the Psalms 22nd Psalm crying my God
[34:53] my God why has Thou forsaken me
[34:56] not David it was Christ 800 years later
[34:59] all my bones stare at me they shoot out
[35:02] their lips at me they wiped their heads
[35:04] said he saved others but himself he
[35:05] cannot say David speaking that as if it
[35:08] was himself but it was the spirit of God
[35:11] and he Christ speaking forth
[35:15] oh God be praised
[35:18] moving into his church in the fullness
[35:21] of his power moving among his people
[35:23] spreading out his great wings of Mercy
[35:26] may he be praised
[35:29] I haven't time for my sermon
[35:32] let us bow our heads just a moment

[36:51] have what you've said
[36:53] Heavenly Father
[36:56] as this day is growing near to the
[37:00] midday
[37:02] and I've been at length here this
[37:04] morning on this story of our divine
[37:08] grace according to your word
[37:12] it is written in the scriptures
[37:15] that Jesus our lord said
[37:19] he that believeth on me the works that I
[37:23] do shall he also
[37:26] and we know that those works are true
[37:30] you could discern the thoughts of the
[37:32] people
[37:33] you told Peter
[37:35] who he was what his name was what his
[37:38] father was
[37:39] you told Philip when he brought
[37:42] Nathaniel or told Nathanael rather
[37:45] that you saw him under the tree before
[37:47] he come
[37:49] you told the woman at the well how many
[37:51] husbands she had
[37:53] oh there is nothing hidden from you
[37:57] you knew all things and that was your
[38:00] works
[38:02] then we see you say to that fig tree
[38:07] oh Lord I believe the hour is soon
[38:10] coming
[38:11] that when the Loaves and Fishes will be
[38:13] multiplied
[38:15] there come a mark of the beast soon
[38:19] there'll come a confederation of
[38:21] churches
[38:22] and they'll put out a sign that a
[38:25] unionized church that no man can buy or
[38:28] sell
[38:29] and your church it won't bother to him
[38:34] for your Holy Spirit shall lead them and
[38:37] feed them as you did Israel in the
[38:39] wilderness
[38:40] you are God
[38:42] don't let us miss that Lord
[38:45] let us remain Faithfully
[38:48] let us be true
[38:51] now I don't know just when this will
[38:53] take place again Lord maybe this morning
[38:56] again
[38:58] maybe it'll happen again in the
[38:59] Tabernacle today
[39:01] trusting that it will Lord trusting at
[39:05] your faith in the people's hearts and
[39:08] know that I haven't misled or said one
[39:11] thing wrong I've said it just the way it
[39:14] come to the best that I know in my heart
[39:17] Lord watching my words and weighing them
[39:21] knowing that you have confirmed that to
[39:23] me as I have said seven times
[39:27] and knowing immediately after that on
[39:29] the first human being I ever spoke to
[39:31] she got the desire of her heart the
[39:33] moment she spoke
[39:36] now Lord there's many Desires in here
[39:38] this morning
[39:39] you'll have to anoint your servant Lord
[39:42] if you'll just send the anointing
[39:45] let me have it this morning
[39:47] if anyone should lead you just speak it
[39:51] to me Lord one day speaker whenever
[39:54] whoever you wish and let it come to pass
[39:57] and I know that what's said then it'll
[40:00] not be me it will be you Lord speaking
[40:03] I'll submit myself to you and before I
[40:06] leave from this ministry
[40:09] the old type of the visions and so forth

[40:19] wonders I dedicate myself again this
[40:23] morning to you Lord for service

[41:45] blessings rest upon them as we pray for

[42:25] and now
[42:26] I am earnestly seeking and Desiring your
[42:31] prayers

[42:37] 50 years old
[42:39] the other morning I said to the wife I'm
[42:42] already 50 honey if I do anything for
[42:44] the Lord I got to hurry
[42:46] she said bill God trained Moses 80 years
[42:52] and said he can train you for another 50
[42:55] years to get one day service from you
[42:58] he's got a purpose for you so just stand
[43:01] still
[43:03] awful there's a lot of wisdom
[43:06] stand still
[43:08] God moves every hand just according to
[43:10] his great plan amen just be still don't
[43:14] try to
[43:15] over to try to push you get ahead of him
[43:18] man it's a whole lot better to try to
[43:21] follow than it is to lead
[43:24] because he's the leader
[43:26] now to my little church here my little
[43:30] flock
[43:31] that's been so faithful
[43:34] and it's prayed for me all out across
[43:36] the world
[43:37] I believe there's another worldwide
[43:39] shakening coming
[43:42] these things I have told you is the
[43:44] truth at the day of the Judgment I'll
[43:47] face you Yonder with the same story
[43:50] just as true as I'm standing here
[43:52] now
[43:54] I'm sure you all could see what it is
[43:57] it's a coming of a greater deeper
[44:01] anointing of the Holy Spirit
[44:03] how to get into it I don't know
[44:06] only thing I know it takes God to put
[44:09] you into it so you just live as sweet
[44:12] and humble and close to God as you can
[44:15] don't doubt him just believe that
[44:18] everything's working just to the good
[44:20] for you and everything will work around
[44:23] all right see just remember you are a
[44:27] sheep
[44:28] he is the dove and the dove leads the
[44:32] lamb
[44:34] when and the lamb and the dove has the
[44:37] same nature
[44:39] the dove is the most generous of all the
[44:42] birds of the heaven a lamb is the most
[44:44] generous of all the beasts of the earth
[44:46] so see their Spirits would
[44:50] coincides with one another now the dove
[44:53] cannot come on a wolf
[44:56] see it wouldn't stay there the wolf is a
[44:59] killer the lamb is gentle so you see
[45:04] it's the lamb and the Dove and one
[45:07] leading the other and you see where the
[45:10] dove led the lamb to all the way to
[45:12] Calvary for crucifixion and he opened
[45:15] not his mouth
[45:17] when they spit on him he never spit back
[45:19] when they smacked him he never smacked
[45:21] back he just went right on knowing that
[45:23] he was for the glory of God he was doing
[45:25] the will of God
[45:27] sister Hattie
[45:31] we're close to around the same age
[45:34] brother George Wright their dad
[45:37] her boy's mother Shelby
[45:41] I want to say this
[45:43] I guess you wonder why I got up and
[45:44] walked out of the house as quick as I
[45:46] did
[45:47] I have never I've been worth 30 000 raw
[45:51] heathens was saved at one time South
[45:53] Africa come to Christ I thought that was
[45:56] the greatest anointing I ever felt it
[45:58] never knows compared with that down to
[46:00] George riots the other day
[46:02] I have never felt anything like that the
[46:06] whole room just seemed to be just a
[46:08] light of the glory of God our sister
[46:11] ahead is very quiet and Pious little
[46:13] woman never raises her voice about
[46:15] anything but you could have heard her
[46:17] scream a city block when the Holy Spirit
[46:19] struck the building everybody everybody
[46:21] there felt it it was wonderful
[46:28] we may live a long time but sister had
[46:30] it as long as there is a memory in our
[46:33] mind we'll remember that from Sister
[46:35] ride now that the people might know that
[46:37] I told that just exactly true would you
[46:40] raise up your hand sister had his sword
[46:41] sister right and you always there just
[46:43] was there just so as you can see see
[46:45] there they are here stand up Sister
[46:47] Hattie there's a little widow woman that
[46:49] the miracle happened on the first
[46:51] bypassing all the peoples of the world
[46:55] for that thing to happen first to that
[46:57] poor little humble widow woman up on the
[47:00] hillside up there trying to raise a crop
[47:02] of corn out of a crawfish ground out
[47:04] there to take care of her children
[47:05] that's the one that God honored the
[47:08] first time since the days of the of
[47:10] Jesus Christ and said ask what you will
[47:14] I said uh challenge anybody in the name
[47:18] of the Lord when that Spirit strikes and
[47:20] says that I don't care what you ask for
[47:23] it shall be granted
[47:28] you know why the plutocrats didn't get
[47:30] it are there big folks like that it's
[47:33] because God knows that ass things that
[47:35] was no good for them he gives it to
[47:37] people who he knows will ask the right
[47:39] thing and what more could that woman
[47:42] what more is tell me anything she could
[47:44] ask greater than that
[47:46] her mother and father saved her little
[47:48] sisters saved all the families saved
[47:51] except the two boys at that time they
[47:53] wasn't saved they're poor people Shelby
[47:57] told me his constant income for a good
[47:59] crop he netted 600 a year
[48:02] work and tell the boys about my agent is
[48:05] all broke down everything and is working
[48:08] take care of his daddy and mother and
[48:10] they're old
[48:11] and try and take care of his little
[48:13] Afflicted sister but he's saved brother
[48:16] right all of them saved but them too was
[48:19] not saying and had he asked the
[48:22] salvation of her children
[48:25] as long as there's an eternity she could
[48:28] have asked for ten thousand dollars and
[48:29] I got it
[48:30] she could ask whatever she would but God
[48:33] knows what you're going to ask before he
[48:35] ever places then haunting that's right
[48:38] sister Hattie is it right that I said
[48:41] ask anything that you wish anything your
[48:44] heart desires asked it Hattie is that
[48:46] right sister Hattie
[48:48] ask anything you want to it makes no
[48:51] difference what it is ask that God has
[48:53] said to me
[48:54] just speak
[48:56] what she's asked for and she'll have it
[49:00] he said ask it now
[49:02] just anything you desire
[49:04] and she didn't oh brother sister
[49:09] do you realize that they were living
[49:11] here
[49:12] the most glorious
[49:15] when God of heaven will put amongst
[49:17] human beings
[49:18] that ask anything you will he'll give it
[49:22] to you
[49:25] it's it's too deep for my mind I know
[49:27] that
[49:28] but I hope that my heart can contain as
[49:30] much of it as I can it's just I have
[49:34] lived on it I have thrived on it I'm
[49:37] going Westward on and I'm entering
[49:39] meetings on it I'm living on it
[49:42] God's words is right
[49:47] as far as I know that's the last thing
[49:49] to happen
[49:51] I don't know nothing else but it could
[49:53] be just to give to human beings as
[49:56] anything that you desire no matter what
[49:58] it is just ask it and it'll be given to
[50:01] you and could you see the wisdom how
[50:04] many beliefs of that woman asked the
[50:07] greatest thing could be yes let's see
[50:11] could you imagine a woman
[50:14] with a Afflicted sister
[50:16] could uh ask for her eating
[50:20] a woman is poor and Her Mother and Daddy
[50:22] poor and all of them poor could have
[50:24] asked for money and got it
[50:28] she could have asked for years added to
[50:30] her life and got it
[50:34] but she asked the greatest thing it
[50:36] could be yes the salvation of her
[50:38] unsaved family and got it
[50:41] amen that's the main thing got it for
[50:44] the same God to give the promise
[50:46] [Music]
[50:47] God oh how I love him now
[50:51] we're going is there any sick here to be
[50:53] prayed for raise up your hands
[50:56] a woman called a few nights ago
[50:59] this tree of I believe from California
[51:01] or something you told me
[51:03] that said we've come two or three times
[51:06] and you give out prayer cards and our
[51:08] numbers are not called I made her
[51:10] promise if she'd stay over that I just
[51:13] pray for the sick this morning comment
[51:15] has been in year one we've had the
[51:16] discernments and things all of you I
[51:18] suppose everybody here see we know
[51:20] that's true we're moving beyond that now
[51:23] oh praise be to God we're moving beyond
[51:27] that now maybe it will come to pass I
[51:30] don't know what God will do this morning
[51:31] but you people that are sick and
[51:33] Afflicted I'm going to ask you just to
[51:35] come a few at a time let these on this
[51:37] side here come up so we can pray for
[51:39] these on this side first maybe I can
[51:41] catch it like that come right up here
[51:42] sister this line right up here
[51:45] because we haven't got you have to send
[51:47] them back down the same aisle
[51:49] I'm going to count of them they're
[51:51] getting back
[51:53] uh
[51:54] I could tell the way this little fella
[51:56] talked this morning he breathed in
[51:58] Divine Healing I know it brings the
[51:59] power of God
[52:01] um is there another Minister here this
[52:03] morning at the uh Minister who believes
[52:05] that God heals the sick if there is let
[52:08] him come up here each life well he only
[52:10] come here same with us why we pray for
[52:12] these these sick and flicking any of you
[52:14] brother not believe that God heals the
[52:16] savior
[52:20] with us
[52:33] now we do not know what the Holy Spirit
[52:36] may do
[52:37] the Holy Spirit May at this time
[52:40] performed just like you did down at
[52:42] sister writes the other day
[52:45] our trust that he will I don't know you
[52:47] understand how many no wealth is not
[52:49] many of you left here when the Visions
[52:51] first started I don't know what time
[52:53] they'll come what they'll do everything
[52:55] is in the will of God and has to be
[52:57] controlled by God how many knows that
[52:59] God could not give man things to control
[53:02] themselves if they did then you see it
[53:06] wouldn't be gone
[53:08] it wouldn't be God it would be I want
[53:11] you to think here friends in this little
[53:12] lowly place but how the Lord has
[53:15] absolutely brother Mike Beyond any
[53:18] Shadow of Doubt has blessed us and
[53:20] performed and done just exactly what he
[53:22] promised you to do
[53:24] how many ever heard of superstition
[53:26] perception many of you hazards it says
[53:28] no but mythology spiritualism
[53:30] but you know they can't damn things are
[53:32] not lasting they don't hold on
[53:35] they can never get any material they'll
[53:37] sit down there and have they say there's
[53:39] a spirit there's a spirit and they're
[53:41] trying to take a picture of something
[53:42] they can't do it see it's just it's not
[53:44] there it's psyche mental
[53:47] but
[53:48] what God does is perfect
[53:51] when Moses sewed down his rod
[53:54] the magician throw down his Rod to this
[53:57] both heard of serpents is that right
[53:59] but what happened to Jamison Jammer's
[54:02] Rod Moses Rod swore it up
[54:06] and when Moses picked up his Rod it was
[54:09] still around
[54:10] but where was there on
[54:12] inside the rod of Moses
[54:15] see you couldn't see it when God does
[54:19] anything he makes it real now they tell
[54:21] me the Holy Spirit you know they say
[54:22] that's people just worked up it's mental
[54:25] them visions and things that's just the
[54:28] mental telepathy well when George J lace
[54:31] examined that picture there when that
[54:33] angel of the Lord many of you stand your
[54:35] scene on the river many times he said
[54:37] brother Branham the mechanical out of
[54:39] this camera don't take psychology
[54:43] so the light was there it is it's
[54:46] Everlasting it's true
[54:48] so you see it's the same angel of God
[54:50] now watch it the nature of it proves it
[54:54] when he was here on Earth it was dwelt
[54:57] in the Lord Jesus Christ who was God
[54:59] made manifest
[55:01] and now Jesus said a little while the
[55:03] world won't see me anymore yet you have
[55:04] seen me for I'll be with you even in you
[55:07] to the end of the world and the things
[55:09] that you do that I do shall you also now
[55:12] watch it when it comes a man can say
[55:14] anything but when God facts it up that
[55:16] makes the truth
[55:17] now what's the nature of that angel when
[55:20] he gets the person so submitted to him
[55:22] he does the same thing that Jesus did
[55:24] when he was here on Earth man because we
[55:26] are Sons and Daughters of God if we're
[55:28] born of his spirit
[55:29] see an angle mythical thing it's got
[55:33] evidence to prove it it shows that it's
[55:35] right so our Salvation is absolutely
[55:38] perfect
[55:39] the god of Heaven who had all the
[55:42] prophets to speak of the coming of the
[55:44] Lord Jesus
[55:45] and Jesus when he come he fulfilled
[55:48] every prophecy many of us fulfill at the
[55:51] cross wounded for our transgressions and
[55:53] what David said my God is Thou forsaken
[55:55] me but when God sends a prophet a
[55:58] prophet speaks God makes that truth
[56:01] if it's God
[56:02] that's where he said to know him if they
[56:05] spoke him up he said come to pass then
[56:06] believe him or I'm with him if it
[56:09] doesn't then either they're not they're
[56:11] false prophets he said but to mark them
[56:14] see where they come to pass now look if
[56:18] God who spoke in the holy prophet talked
[56:21] about the coming of the Messiah to the
[56:23] glory and honor of God
[56:25] if I know who would be president next
[56:27] fall in intelligence that would be
[56:29] prophecy that's right but God doesn't
[56:31] prophesy like that just to or just to be
[56:33] playing God does something to glorify
[56:36] him
[56:37] see but when the Messiah comes and when
[56:40] the Messiah left I want to ask all you
[56:43] methodists Baptist Presbyterian Catholic
[56:45] Lutheran Pentecostal Nazarene Pilgrim
[56:48] Holiness all of you I want to ask you
[56:50] something don't you think that that King
[56:52] of the prophets
[56:54] Jesus would have known how to set up his
[56:57] own church if all the prophets spoke of
[56:59] him and pointed to him what kind of
[57:02] church did he set up when he left he
[57:04] said when he was sure on Earth he told
[57:06] Peter on the revelation of the word of
[57:08] God he said Upon This Rock I'll build my
[57:11] church
[57:12] and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[57:14] against it isn't that right

[1:02:54] for
[1:02:55] just remember
[1:02:57] that the same God
[1:02:59] that granted all these things that you
[1:03:01] have heard done around the country and
[1:03:04] they are truth just as true as they can
[1:03:07] be and all these ministers share what's
[1:03:09] been done in their Ministry what's been
[1:03:12] done in the ministry the Lord has given
[1:03:13] me we have stood here with sincerity
[1:03:16] with all of our hearts praying laying
[1:03:18] hands on you just exactly what Jesus
[1:03:21] said these signs shall follow them that
[1:03:22] believe
[1:03:24] if they lay hands on the sick they shall
[1:03:26] recover
[1:03:27] now it's just there's only one thing to
[1:03:29] keep it from not happening that would be
[1:03:32] for you to disbelieve it Jesus said come
[1:03:35] unto me all your labor and heavy laden
[1:03:36] I'll give you rest
[1:03:38] whosoever will let him come
[1:03:41] now there's only one way for you to miss
[1:03:43] it God's word is true one way for you to
[1:03:46] miss it is not come isn't that right
[1:03:49] that's a way for you to miss it
[1:03:51] God said these signs shall follow them
[1:03:53] and believe if they lay hands on the
[1:03:55] sick they shall recover there's only one
[1:03:57] way for you to miss it that's
[1:03:58] disbelieving
[1:03:59] if you'll believe God's word God will
[1:04:03] keep his word you see to that would be
[1:04:05] that's the first initial that's the way
[1:04:08] to pray for the sake pass them through
[1:04:10] lay hands on them or naunt them or
[1:04:11] anything that God said we but after all
[1:04:15] of that for God to let you know that
[1:04:17] he's in the midst of his people he shows
[1:04:19] signs and wonders and see it's a wonders
[1:04:22] and miracles of the Living God to do the
[1:04:26] things that he does do he's wonderful
[1:04:29] don't you think so
[1:04:31] now the Brethren are making ready in
[1:04:34] therefore the the baptismal service and
[1:04:36] it'll just be quickly and now those are
[1:04:39] to be baptized the women go to the room
[1:04:42] is that right the women over there the
[1:04:43] women over here and the man on this side
[1:04:45] while we're making ready for baptism
[1:04:47] service I want to read a scripture in
[1:04:49] the next few minutes and we'll be I know
[1:04:52] some of your limbs are bound to be
[1:04:54] hurting from standing up and if you
[1:04:57] can't stand just a few moments longer
[1:04:59] you'll see a beautiful sight when you
[1:05:02] see the the immersing of these people
[1:05:08] I want to read some scriptures now found
[1:05:10] in the book of Acts the second chapter
[1:05:12] while they're making ready for the
[1:05:14] baptism I think there's only about two
[1:05:16] or three to be baptized it won't take
[1:05:18] but just a moment and I want you to
[1:05:20] listen close now
[1:05:22] I'm going to
[1:05:24] begin reading I'll Acts 2
[1:05:27] the 28th verse beginning reading
[1:05:33] thou has made known unto me the way of
[1:05:35] life
[1:05:36] the ways of life it's in the plural thou
[1:05:39] shall make me full of joy and with thy
[1:05:42] accountances man and Brethren let me
[1:05:46] freely speak to you of the patriarch
[1:05:48] David that he is both dead and buried
[1:05:51] and his Sepulcher is with us to this day
[1:05:54] therefore being a prophet how many know
[1:05:57] David was a prophet
[1:05:59] is a psalmist and prophet
[1:06:02] therefore being a prophet
[1:06:04] and the knowledge that God had sworn
[1:06:07] with an oath to him
[1:06:09] that all the fruits of his Lawrence
[1:06:11] according to the flesh he would raise up
[1:06:14] Christ to sit on his throne
[1:06:17] he's seeing this before spake of the
[1:06:19] resurrection of Christ that his soul was
[1:06:22] not left in Hell neither did his flesh
[1:06:25] see corruption this Jesus has God raised
[1:06:29] up War for we are all Witnesses
[1:06:33] doesn't that sound like today
[1:06:34] we Are Witnesses of these things
[1:06:38] I could say this morning Hattie the rest
[1:06:40] of you we're Witnesses of these things
[1:06:44] therefore being at the right hand of God
[1:06:47] exalted having received to the Father
[1:06:50] the promise of the Holy Ghost he has
[1:06:52] shed forth this which ye now see and
[1:06:55] hear for David is not ascended into
[1:06:58] heaven
[1:06:59] but he said himself the Lord said unto
[1:07:02] my Lord set thou on my right hand
[1:07:03] remember last Sunday how we spoke of the
[1:07:05] prophets all them great men how they had
[1:07:07] to die but one come the Royal seed
[1:07:12] set thou own my right hand until I make
[1:07:15] thy foes thy footstool therefore let all
[1:07:18] the house of Israel know surely that God
[1:07:22] has made this same Jesus who you
[1:07:24] crucified both Lord and Christ
[1:07:28] now when they heard this
[1:07:31] that Jesus is both Lord and Christ
[1:07:35] now when they heard this they were
[1:07:36] pricked in their hearts and said unto
[1:07:39] Peter and the rest of the Apostles man
[1:07:41] and Brethren what shall we do
[1:07:44] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[1:07:47] baptized every one of you
[1:07:49] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:07:52] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:07:54] the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:56] for the promise isn't to you and to your
[1:07:59] children and to them as far off even as
[1:08:01] many as the Lord Our God shall call and
[1:08:04] with many other words did he testify and
[1:08:07] exhort saying save yourselves from this
[1:08:10] on toward generation
[1:08:12] and they that gladly received his word
[1:08:15] were baptized and the same day that were
[1:08:19] added to them about three thousand souls
[1:08:22] and they continued steadfastly in the
[1:08:25] apostles Doctrine and in the fellowship
[1:08:28] and breaking of bread and with prayers
[1:08:30] and fear Came Upon every soul and Many
[1:08:34] Wonders and signs were done by the
[1:08:36] apostles and all that believe were
[1:08:39] gathered together
[1:08:41] and had all things in common sold their
[1:08:43] possessions and goods and parted them to
[1:08:46] all men as every man had need and they
[1:08:49] continually daily with one Accord in the
[1:08:53] temple breaking bread from house to
[1:08:55] house did eat their meat with gladness
[1:08:57] and sangliness of heart praising God and
[1:09:00] having favor with all the people and the
[1:09:02] Lord added to the church daily such as
[1:09:05] should be saved
[1:09:08] now just the father coming to the water
[1:09:10] you let me know when it's George the
[1:09:12] water
[1:09:13] um that you might know
[1:09:16] that Sovereign Grace
[1:09:20] that reigns with God I want to go back
[1:09:24] I just can't help from placing something
[1:09:27] else in
[1:09:29] did you know those two boys
[1:09:32] that woman's children
[1:09:36] that were saved God knew that before the
[1:09:40] foundation of the world
[1:09:43] and their names were actually put on the
[1:09:46] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:09:47] foundation of the world
[1:09:49] the Bible says that
[1:09:51] and it only had to work to this minute
[1:09:54] did you know God knew that we'd be
[1:09:57] standing here 10 million years before
[1:10:00] the world was ever founded you know he
[1:10:02] knew we'd be standing here this morning
[1:10:04] the infancy of God no one ever fly ever
[1:10:09] not every time that Dr Oz Tower they
[1:10:12] would produce
[1:10:13] before the world was ever formed God
[1:10:16] knew it
[1:10:17] now you say well if he knows it then why
[1:10:20] are you preaching that's God a part of
[1:10:22] God's program
[1:10:23] preaching is his program why do you look
[1:10:26] up all the apostles he looked upon the
[1:10:29] heart he said the Harvest is right
[1:10:32] and the labors are viewed pray the Lord
[1:10:36] the Harvest that he will send labors
[1:10:38] into his harness how many remember that
[1:10:41] well why would they have to pray to the
[1:10:44] Lord of harvest to send labors into his
[1:10:46] harness
[1:10:48] if we are the Harvest of standing there
[1:10:50] is only it could be done
[1:10:52] why God Is So arranging
[1:10:56] that his
[1:10:58] I'll listen to this God has sore reasons
[1:11:01] that his program cannot move without you
[1:11:04] and I
[1:11:07] and as long as we're not doing what God
[1:11:09] needs us to do we're paralyzing his
[1:11:11] program
[1:11:13] but when the church moves about
[1:11:15] anointing of the Holy Ghost then we are
[1:11:17] in God's will doing his program
[1:11:20] oh as soon as I return from California
[1:11:23] the Lord's willing
[1:11:25] what the grand Tabernacle needs is a
[1:11:28] Revival
[1:11:29] raise your Revival and the filling of
[1:11:32] the Holy Ghost
[1:11:33] yeah and that's the great need of the
[1:11:36] Tabernacle some defies keeping the world
[1:11:38] come to you but what we need is the
[1:11:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:43] I feel it then tell us and the city who
[1:11:46] return back if the Lord's willing we're
[1:11:48] going to have a Revival for that very
[1:11:50] purpose that's the remembrance of this
[1:11:53] to happen other people who are seeking
[1:11:55] the Holy Ghost might come in within
[1:11:57] instructions and everything I have
[1:11:58] ground meetings in here to repeat the
[1:12:00] Holy Ghost that's the church might get
[1:12:02] back into the will of God and move on
