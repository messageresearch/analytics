[0:38] blessing upon this Sunday school lesson

[1:20] name of Jesus Christ we ask it
[1:23] amen let's sing only
[1:27] believe only
[1:29] [Music]
[1:32] be
[1:34] only
[1:37] be all things are
[1:43] possible
[1:45] only
[1:47] believe
[1:49] only
[1:53] be
[1:54] only
[1:58] be all things are
[2:03] possible
[2:05] only
[2:08] be you may be seated brother
[2:18] Brena now remember if hell is eternal
[2:23] then the Bible was wrong when he said
[2:24] hell was
[2:25] created and then if a man's go to burn
[2:28] for eternity in hell then you'd have to
[2:31] have eternal life to be conscious to
[2:34] burn is that right well how many forms
[2:37] of eternal life is there one amen that's
[2:41] right there one eternal life I don't go
[2:44] away and say brother BR don't believe in
[2:45] Hell brother BR does Believe In Hell the
[2:47] Bible teaches there's a hell just ass
[2:49] sure as there's a a place for rest
[2:52] there's a place of of punishment and God
[2:55] will certainly make a soul that sins
[2:57] against him be punished and for reject
[2:59] reting Jesus Christ as your savior you
[3:01] certainly will be punished for it but
[3:04] there will be a time when you'll be no
[3:05] more but how many million years that'll
[3:07] take for you to go back to that I don't
[3:09] know but sometime you're a time being
[3:13] until you're born again then you're
[3:15] Eternal being and the only way you can
[3:17] get it is have part of God in you being
[3:19] eternal life can you see it certainly he
[3:23] that has an ear let him hear what the
[3:25] spirit saith un the churches I love him
[3:27] don't you I'm so glad to have eternal
[3:30] life that doesn't bother me
[3:33] anymore uh because we have eternal life
[3:36] now I know that and I trust that
[3:38] everybody will have it all of us irenius
[3:41] yes I had a note here on ireneus about
[3:43] to read this history that a reason
[3:46] irenius was chosen is because that he
[3:48] had the signs of the Pentecostal
[3:50] original Church following him now if God
[3:56] how many believes that the church begin
[3:58] at Pentecost
[4:00] all right how many believe that God
[4:01] endorsed the church at Pentecost all
[4:04] right sir then if that was God's first
[4:06] church and that's what he called a
[4:08] church and he's the vine now we're the
[4:11] branches if the vine ever puts forth
[4:13] another Branch what will it be
[4:16] Pentecostal now maybe not the name now
[4:18] we got names of Pentecost but that's no
[4:21] more than Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[4:23] Pentecostal that don't mean a thing see
[4:25] that's just the name but as long as you
[4:27] got a Pentecostal experience in in your
[4:30] heart Pentecost in your soul giving you
[4:34] eternal life then God has promised you
[4:36] that you'll never be touched with the
[4:38] second death that you got eternal life
[4:41] and can't be touched with the second
[4:42] death see you got you're grieve not the
[4:46] holy spirit of God now don't grieve it
[4:48] do things that's wrong if you do you'll
[4:50] pay for it because the Bible said grieve
[4:52] not the holy spirit of God whereby you
[4:54] are sealed until the day of your
[4:57] Redemption is that right gri not the
[5:00] Holy Spirit oh it's going to be a
[5:03] wonderful day some more some these
[5:05] times to show you if the resurrections
[5:07] going to be Universal there'll be two in
[5:09] the field and I'll take one and two in
[5:11] the bed and I'll take one See it'll be
[5:13] the night one place and daylight on the
[5:15] other side of the earth be a universal
[5:17] resurrection that Rapture The Trumpet Of
[5:20] God shall sound and every one of these
[5:22] of this little church here here here and
[5:25] even that little Bunch that went through
[5:26] there come out here here here when that
[5:29] virgin that virgin when she seen in the
[5:33] seventh watch that I remember there were
[5:36] seven virgins is that right I mean five
[5:39] virgins one out 10 virgins went out to
[5:41] meet the Lord five was wise and five was
[5:44] foolish is that right and now in the
[5:46] watches though there was seven watches
[5:49] and at the end of the seventh watch some
[5:52] slept from this watch this one this one
[5:54] this one that the seventh watch there

[7:15] you anyhow where did you come from where
[7:17] are you going the only book in the world
[7:19] can tell you what it is is this blessed
[7:21] old Bible here and that's the Bible that
[7:24] we believe in that's the god that we
[7:26] believe in and if you're not into that
[7:29] bride into this little bunch of
[7:31] minorities way down here today being
[7:34] squeezed out by Creeds and denominations
[7:36] and so forth if if if you're not in that
[7:40] little group now you don't have to jar
[7:42] this Tabernacle you don't have to jarn
[7:43] anything you just have to be born into
[7:46] that Kingdom now if you want your
[7:48] fellowship in the Methodist Baptist
[7:50] Presbyterian wherever you want it that's
[7:52] up to you see you put your fellowship
[7:54] with anybody you want to but I'll tell
[7:56] you one thing when you're born again
[7:58] your birds of a
[8:03] feather someone asked me one time said
[8:06] brother R you told them people going
[8:07] back to Methodist Church I said sure let
[8:09] them throw him out and they had no place
[8:11] to go
[8:12] so so go on back won't be very long
[8:17] won't be right they'll be right back
[8:19] again you know one time in the ark a
[8:22] place of safety Noah there was a big
[8:24] flood come and so Noah turned the crow
[8:27] out of the Ark and he just went on
[8:29] hawing and looking around well he was
[8:31] satisfied CU he was a vulture to begin
[8:33] with he could fly from an old dead
[8:35] carcass and need a belly full off of
[8:37] this mule and go there on this this old
[8:39] sheep needed belly P off of him and
[8:42] something else was just all kind of old
[8:43] dead carcasses laying around so the crow
[8:46] would just sit down there call around
[8:47] boy I'm having me a jubilee all by
[8:49] myself just calling away but when they
[8:52] turn the little Dove out he's a
[8:54] different
[8:55] nature that stink he couldn't stand
[8:59] why a dove hasn't got any G he's the
[9:02] only bird that doesn't have a gall he
[9:04] couldn't digest it so the only thing he
[9:06] could do is get right back to the ark
[9:08] and be on the
[9:11] door just go anywhere you want to only
[9:14] thing I'm asking you to do is just come
[9:15] into the
[9:16] kingdom I know where you'll

[1:17:27] our the day today there's a portion in
[1:17:30] the scripture in Matthew chapter
[1:17:34] 19 um is where we're going to kind of
[1:17:37] touch a little bit but let's take
[1:17:40] Hebrews 11 and we'll stand to our feet
[1:17:42] and turn there just for a
[1:17:46] moment and the brother from Germany
[1:17:49] where's that brother at let's see right
[1:17:51] there God bless him amen Lord bless you
[1:17:54] my brother
[1:18:01] welcome Hebrews 11 very famous portion
[1:18:04] of
[1:18:06] scripture the heroes of the faith are
[1:18:08] mentioned
[1:18:10] here you know we've been speaking of
[1:18:12] Joshua Joshua is not mentioned here but
[1:18:15] what he did to the walls of Jericho are
[1:18:19] mention but in Hebrews we're going to
[1:18:21] focus on this verse
[1:18:26] number
[1:18:28] 23 and the Bible says by faith
[1:18:32] Moses when he was born was HD three
[1:18:35] months of his parents because they saw
[1:18:38] he was a proper child and they were not
[1:18:40] afraid of the king's commandment by
[1:18:43] faith Moses when he was come to years
[1:18:46] refused to be called the son of
[1:18:48] Pharaoh's daughter it's a pretty
[1:18:50] tremendous Choice
[1:18:52] there choosing rather to to suffer
[1:18:56] Affliction with the people of God than
[1:19:00] to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:19:04] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[1:19:09] what greater greater riches than the
[1:19:14] treasures in Egypt or any other economy
[1:19:18] you can think
[1:19:19] of for he had respect unto the
[1:19:23] recompense
[1:19:25] of the
[1:19:27] reward amen there's coming a day where
[1:19:30] rewards will be given out and we
[1:19:33] are in a great
[1:19:36] race a race like no other race the
[1:19:41] race of your life amen the race the
[1:19:46] challenge the great test the
[1:19:50] turmoil and we want to finish that race
[1:19:53] as God will help us amen amen one more
[1:19:56] scripture Matthew chapter 7 verse number
[1:20:02] 14 verse
[1:20:07] 13 enter ye in at the Straight Gate for
[1:20:12] wide is the gate and Broad is the way
[1:20:15] that leadth to destruction and many
[1:20:17] there be which go in there at because
[1:20:21] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[1:20:25] way which leadth unto life and few there
[1:20:29] be that find it amen the title of the
[1:20:33] message uh this morning is simply the
[1:20:36] harder
[1:20:37] way the harder way is my way the harder
[1:20:43] way is my way amen we'll go to the Lord
[1:20:47] in prayer heavenly father bless your
[1:20:49] word bless your people we pray in Jesus
[1:20:53] name amen
[1:20:55] God bless you you may be seated our
[1:20:57] sister there's a sister um I don't know
[1:21:00] if she's here Sharon you mention
[1:21:03] her maybe she's not here sister
[1:21:07] Dorcas she right there okay oh my so our
[1:21:13] dear sister is a a True Believer we
[1:21:15] she's been among us a few times and we
[1:21:19] um you kind of move kind of quick you
[1:21:21] know so we can't catch her like we want
[1:21:23] to but I believe this is going to be her
[1:21:26] last service here I believe she's moving
[1:21:28] to Phoenix and so uh her father is one
[1:21:33] of the pioneers of this
[1:21:35] message that brought the message to what
[1:21:39] country was that
[1:21:41] sis equ Equatorial Guinea and so she's a
[1:21:46] PK preachers kid pastor's
[1:21:49] kid and um a good one at that and the
[1:21:52] Lord has kept her and she's been among
[1:21:55] us and we just get to know her and she's
[1:21:58] leaving already but she's not too far
[1:22:01] she's she'll be in Phoenix and we hope
[1:22:03] to see her there if the Lord are will
[1:22:07] she's a young lady and she'll be getting
[1:22:10] married here soon and so we pray the
[1:22:12] Lord will bless her richly amen thank
[1:22:14] the Lord for her now the harder way is
[1:22:18] my way is the title of this message and
[1:22:21] as I was um something had been Direct
[1:22:24] directing me to the marriage and divorce
[1:22:28] sermon very strict sermon and I would I
[1:22:33] would in Los crues last week I asked the
[1:22:36] group of Youth in the youth meeting I
[1:22:39] don't think it was a Sunday morning but
[1:22:41] the youth meeting I was quoting out of
[1:22:43] the message
[1:22:45] um um spoken word is the Original
[1:22:49] Seed a 5H hour sermon and I asked the
[1:22:52] youth how many had heard that message
[1:22:55] and I was surprised but I'm wasn't too
[1:22:58] surprised that there was a number of
[1:23:00] them that had never heard that message
[1:23:02] of course if you're a young person and
[1:23:04] you're going to pick a message to listen
[1:23:06] to it's probably not going to be a five
[1:23:09] hour
[1:23:11] one but as I said to them it it's only
[1:23:14] 30 minutes for the first 30
[1:23:17] minutes and then the next 30 minutes
[1:23:20] that'll get you an hour and then you
[1:23:21] just eat it a little bit at a time all
[1:23:25] right so say that with me it's only 30
[1:23:28] minutes only 30 minutes for the first 30
[1:23:32] minutes
[1:23:34] minut now can you do
[1:23:37] that and so there was a number that
[1:23:39] didn't hear that and so I encourage them
[1:23:42] to hear that and I like each of you to
[1:23:44] hear that as well but this message
[1:23:46] marriage and divorce just was striking
[1:23:49] my heart as brother Nathan was doing a
[1:23:53] test one day here trying to work out the
[1:23:55] sound and a portion of that test brother
[1:23:58] bam he he blasts it out he said if I
[1:24:01] really preach marriage and divorce how
[1:24:04] it should really be preached it would
[1:24:07] tear up every Church in the
[1:24:11] country and then he slides in there and
[1:24:13] maybe they should be tore
[1:24:15] up he slid that in there it would tear
[1:24:18] up every Church in the country and then
[1:24:20] maybe it should be tore up and so I like
[1:24:23] us not to walk away from this message
[1:24:26] but to embrace it Embrace that teaching
[1:24:30] on marriage and divorce and what brother
[1:24:33] randam did was he took Matthew chapter
[1:24:36] 19 as his scripture to open it up and
[1:24:41] when he gets into it he begins to share
[1:24:46] with us that when you get a chance he
[1:24:50] said to take all the scriptures he said
[1:24:52] don't get up and walk out says he says
[1:24:55] brother don't turn the tape off he Saidi
[1:24:57] want you to hear it all the way to the
[1:24:59] end and he said' if you if there's
[1:25:01] something you disagree with he said take
[1:25:04] the
[1:25:05] scriptures go home and read it and then
[1:25:09] pray about
[1:25:10] it and so many times we'll listen to a
[1:25:13] message or listen to the tape and not
[1:25:17] hold that discipline in there well we
[1:25:19] know the prophet said it yes we know the
[1:25:22] Bible said it yes but did you you take
[1:25:24] that scripture to your prayer closet and
[1:25:27] ask God to let it reveal itself to
[1:25:32] you and this is the point in taking
[1:25:36] notes or recording something from the
[1:25:38] service you don't come here to be
[1:25:41] entertained this is not a movie this is
[1:25:43] not you know the high points something
[1:25:45] to make us happy or laugh we're actually
[1:25:48] trying to hear from the word of the Lord
[1:25:51] and you should be getting something I be
[1:25:54] getting something when I read the Bible
[1:25:56] when I read the word of God that I can
[1:25:59] go back and now meditate on it pray
[1:26:04] about it because every one of us will
[1:26:07] give an account for the the Deeds that
[1:26:09] are done in our body and the things we
[1:26:11] do and so looking into this message in
[1:26:15] marriage and divorce it um was um right
[1:26:20] consistent in the beginning there he
[1:26:23] gives this um prophecy that happened to
[1:26:28] him in 1961 it was in February in
[1:26:33] 1961 he was in California and he
[1:26:37] preached a whole string of meetings 19
[1:26:41] 1961 in February there in Long Beach
[1:26:45] California uh February 7th 8th 9th 10th
[1:26:49] 11th the 12th two services on the 12th
[1:26:52] the 13th the 14 14th two services on the
[1:26:56] 16th and
[1:26:58] 17th um on the 18th and then on the 19th
[1:27:02] he preach the queen of shba and here he
[1:27:04] is preaching about Abraham in this
[1:27:07] series of messages and as he was
[1:27:10] preaching that he preached um just a few
[1:27:13] titles Jehovah Gyra Abraham Abraham's
[1:27:17] Covenant confirm Jehovah Gyra again and
[1:27:21] thy seed shall possess the gates of his
[1:27:24] enemy the basis of Fellowship so it's
[1:27:28] very uh Centric around this topic of
[1:27:31] Abraham which we have brought to you in
[1:27:35] Genesis chapter 15 this is why this is
[1:27:39] where Israel was uh the Lord showed
[1:27:42] Abraham that Israel would go to Egypt
[1:27:45] and will be there in bondage for 400
[1:27:48] years and that I would bring them out of
[1:27:52] this Strange Land and then there's a
[1:27:54] story of Joshua and Caleb and the people
[1:27:56] of God coming out of this slavery
[1:28:01] basically abuse and then going into this
[1:28:05] great new land a promised land and then
[1:28:07] having to cross over Jordan and at
[1:28:10] Jordan they couldn't all go over so it
[1:28:13] was delayed again by an extra 40 years
[1:28:17] because they wasn't all ready Joshua and
[1:28:20] Caleb were ready and we have been
[1:28:23] encouraging the church here it's been on
[1:28:26] my heart that this Joshua and Caleb um
[1:28:30] positions that they took you know the
[1:28:33] word of the Lord continues to recycle
[1:28:36] itself around and it's a great drama and
[1:28:39] a great play of redemption not just
[1:28:42] Israel coming out of Egypt but it's
[1:28:45] brother Israel coming out of Egypt not
[1:28:48] just his son um uh Moses and the Hebrews
[1:28:53] he's talking about his Sons and
[1:28:54] Daughters you and you and you coming out
[1:28:58] of Egypt the great Plan of Redemption
[1:29:01] and it keeps playing itself over and
[1:29:03] over again in the scripture then you see
[1:29:05] it in the New Testament with the
[1:29:07] Gentiles and then you see it in your
[1:29:09] very life that God is trying to move you
[1:29:14] to the next level and that was crossing
[1:29:17] over Jordan into the great promised land
[1:29:20] and see and so now brother randam is
[1:29:22] bringing this Covenant of ab Abraham and
[1:29:25] he's bringing all these messages here on
[1:29:27] the West Coast it was very very
[1:29:30] difficult for him to bring it but at the
[1:29:35] end of one of those sermons this young
[1:29:38] man who was a Baptist man grabs him and
[1:29:43] begins to tell him the things that you
[1:29:45] were preaching it could have been like
[1:29:47] the the the the the the addition to the
[1:29:50] Bible and so forth and then the
[1:29:52] anointing strikes this man he was is a
[1:29:54] French man and he prophesies over the
[1:29:58] prophet now that was in February he
[1:30:02] doesn't mention it to his people until
[1:30:05] 10 months later in December he doesn't
[1:30:08] mention it to the Tabernacle because
[1:30:10] obviously he's traveling in the ministry
[1:30:13] and so forth but here he picks it up in
[1:30:16] the message
[1:30:18] Paradox and
[1:30:22] 1961 of December and the prophet of God
[1:30:25] says this here and this Frenchman the
[1:30:27] second one over here he wrote it out
[1:30:30] because he had been taking minutes of
[1:30:32] the meeting here is what he wrote I
[1:30:36] Victor Leo am a French man full blooded
[1:30:40] born again Christian filled with the
[1:30:43] Holy Spirit I live at 809 North King
[1:30:46] Road Los
[1:30:48] Angeles attend Angeles attend bethl
[1:30:51] Temple Arie Vic is our pastor a
[1:30:55] Pentecostal Minister biggest Pentecostal
[1:30:58] Church in Los Angeles a translation of
[1:31:01] the prophecy over brother randana given
[1:31:03] by Danny Henry in French February 11th
[1:31:09] 1961 at the Full Gospel businessman's
[1:31:12] breakfast a true translation of the
[1:31:16] prophecy all three of them said this so
[1:31:19] there was three witnesses that said this
[1:31:21] very same
[1:31:22] thing because thou H has chosen the
[1:31:25] Narrow Path see just against I'd have to
[1:31:29] walk by yourself see I can understand
[1:31:32] that Moses had to make his choice too
[1:31:34] see he didn't have to do it but he did
[1:31:37] it see the harder way see because thou
[1:31:41] has chosen the Narrow Path the harder
[1:31:45] way thou has made thou has walked of
[1:31:48] your own
[1:31:50] choosing in other words I didn't have to
[1:31:53] do it
[1:31:54] I can side in go with them if I want to
[1:31:58] but I stayed I want to stay with the
[1:32:00] word thou has picked the correct and
[1:32:04] precise decision and it is my way if
[1:32:09] you'll notice it punctuated underline if
[1:32:11] you notice it's wrote in French this
[1:32:14] spoken French verb before the adverb see
[1:32:17] because of this momentous decision a
[1:32:20] huge portion of Heaven awaits thee
[1:32:24] now that's what I wondered when I die
[1:32:26] will it be then I happen to think Heaven
[1:32:29] is not portioned off to different
[1:32:30] portions to us up there Heaven is the
[1:32:33] Kingdom of Heaven that's within us one
[1:32:36] waits for see now watch what a
[1:32:40] glorious decision thou Hast made this in
[1:32:45] itself is that which will give and make
[1:32:48] come to pass the tremendous victory in
[1:32:50] the love divine H see we would would say
[1:32:54] in the tremendous victory in Divine love
[1:32:57] but in French it would be love divine
[1:33:00] just like German or any other see put
[1:33:02] the verb before the ABB now you see
[1:33:05] what's coming down to the Jordan minant
[1:33:08] so here what he saying now he's bringing
[1:33:10] in Jordan where's Jordan at it's in the
[1:33:13] Old Testament where's Jordan at it's in
[1:33:17] the Book of Joshua in the book of
[1:33:19] numbers so he's now relaying his own
[1:33:23] this this Paradox message and then now
[1:33:26] this tremendous Victory this decision to
[1:33:30] choose the harder way now we're coming
[1:33:33] to the Jordan now let me stop here for a
[1:33:36] minute all of us are coming to a
[1:33:39] Jordan and even kades Baria a time of
[1:33:43] decision we're all faced with that
[1:33:47] different areas in different stages of
[1:33:49] our life in one place don't worry I'll
[1:33:52] get back to the quote in one Place
[1:33:54] brother brandom says that the brandom
[1:33:56] Tabernacle is now at kades Baria
[1:34:00] like what you talking about where we I
[1:34:02] mean the brandom Tabernacles that CAD
[1:34:04] you got to get the spiritual application
[1:34:07] of what he's saying you're at ksh Baria
[1:34:11] you got to make a decision and God
[1:34:14] forces the decision out of all of us you
[1:34:18] know at some point you got to say what
[1:34:21] you believe you got got to take a stand
[1:34:25] on
[1:34:29] something and we can hide behind this
[1:34:32] and we're not a fighter we don't want to
[1:34:33] fight so we don't like conflict we don't
[1:34:36] want to bring it up we try to run it but
[1:34:38] the time is coming well you got to say
[1:34:40] what you
[1:34:41] believe all colors will be made known
[1:34:46] and we see that hour approaching to us
[1:34:48] now so here he's bringing in the
[1:34:51] Jordan you now you see what coming down
[1:34:54] to Jordan meant we're down here now
[1:34:58] let's cross over now let's quit playing
[1:35:03] who we preaching
[1:35:04] to let's quit playing Let's cross the
[1:35:08] other side now cuz it all belongs to us
[1:35:12] it's all ours then invisions has never
[1:35:16] failed they can't fail because they come
[1:35:19] from God I believe with all that is
[1:35:22] within me we're not the hirling that
[1:35:25] will run back into the Wilderness we'll
[1:35:28] cross Jordan the separation God break to
[1:35:32] us the seals that's on the backs side of
[1:35:35] the book let us enter into this great
[1:35:38] place now for Joshua divided to the
[1:35:43] people their inheritance that God had
[1:35:46] left for them Oh Glory praise the
[1:35:50] Lord does anybody want to cross over
[1:35:54] over or do you want to stay with church
[1:35:57] church normal the way it's always been I
[1:36:01] want to cross over yeah no no if the
[1:36:05] prophet said it that's our example if
[1:36:09] it's in the word of God that's what I
[1:36:12] want I don't want an excuse why we can't
[1:36:15] have it I don't want an excuse of why it
[1:36:19] can't happen in our
[1:36:21] church I want across all
[1:36:24] over I'm coming to the Jordan amen our
[1:36:28] days are numbered here all of our days
[1:36:31] are numbered here and I want to cross
[1:36:34] over what a beautiful message God has
[1:36:36] given us in this last day he didn't give
[1:36:39] us a message so we can argue and fight
[1:36:41] give us a message so we can look good in
[1:36:43] the mirror he gave us a message to
[1:36:47] change us and be ready for the Rapture
[1:36:51] the resurrection amen amen
[1:36:54] amen so I love how he types that he's
[1:36:57] bringing in this Narrow Path this harder
[1:37:00] way thou has walked of your own choosing
[1:37:05] now brother brandom has this
[1:37:08] experience and he's preaching all of
[1:37:11] these sermons and all these messages
[1:37:13] this seemingly no nobody out of nowhere
[1:37:17] grabs him and prophesies this to
[1:37:21] him that that you have walked in your
[1:37:25] own choosing so as you focus in on this
[1:37:30] message of marriage and
[1:37:32] divorce it's one of those critical ones
[1:37:35] and I think that we should all listen to
[1:37:37] it again and hear it
[1:37:40] again you know there's some hard hard
[1:37:42] places in there I haven't heard anyone
[1:37:45] else preach on it quite like that of
[1:37:48] brother Ram's time his contemporaries
[1:37:50] you go back they're not preaching
[1:37:53] the origin of you know the original sin
[1:37:58] and he's bringing in the original sin
[1:38:00] and then he he brings this up in
[1:38:02] marriage and divorce let's just go there
[1:38:03] quickly in um paragraph number 57 if we
[1:38:08] could take it
[1:38:13] there it's always an issue it comes up
[1:38:16] all the time he
[1:38:19] says with Believers and there's a reason
[1:38:22] why it comes up
[1:38:24] the script this scripture this question
[1:38:27] confronted Jesus at the very beginning
[1:38:31] of his ministry and it confronted Moses
[1:38:34] at the very beginning of his ministry
[1:38:37] it's a foremost question in Believers
[1:38:41] Hearts The Sinner doesn't care but it's
[1:38:44] to Believers because the believer is
[1:38:47] trying to do all that he knows how to do
[1:38:50] to live right before God therefore for
[1:38:53] it any question comes up on religion
[1:38:56] then the marriage and divorce case comes
[1:39:00] up why because it is the cause of the
[1:39:06] original
[1:39:07] sin that's where sin started and that's
[1:39:11] the reason it's brought up every time
[1:39:13] because it is the very beginning of sin
[1:39:18] and I'll say this here today if you're a
[1:39:20] young man or young woman and you're not
[1:39:21] married you need to get that message and
[1:39:24] embrace it and you need to hear the
[1:39:27] truth at least one time and you need to
[1:39:32] hear it until you really understand as
[1:39:35] you take the notes and the scriptures of
[1:39:37] what the prophet of God is
[1:39:39] saying this message you ain't going to
[1:39:41] get nowhere else this message on
[1:39:44] marriage and divorce comes out of the
[1:39:48] opening of The Seven Seals the seventh
[1:39:51] angel had to break that and bring bring
[1:39:53] that to the people and that Revelation
[1:39:57] that's hidden way way back behind the
[1:40:00] shakina glory there's some bread back in
[1:40:04] there that come up from behind the
[1:40:06] shakina of glory and now it's been
[1:40:09] broken and open to us today amen and our
[1:40:12] young people need to embrace it the
[1:40:15] married folks need to embrace it our
[1:40:18] elders need to embrace it our beloved
[1:40:21] sisters need to embrace it what is it
[1:40:25] it's the cause of the original
[1:40:28] sin and it opens up it wasn't one of
[1:40:31] those easy messages you know he says in
[1:40:34] the beginning there in paragraph number
[1:40:37] five it's like he was
[1:40:40] handcuffed to telling the truth he had
[1:40:44] to say it were some ministers you know
[1:40:47] brother BR had a successful Ministry of
[1:40:49] science wonders and miracles he had a
[1:40:52] beautiful Ministry
[1:40:54] that you know just signs wonders and
[1:40:55] miracles why don't you leave all of this
[1:40:58] harsh preaching this uncomfortable
[1:41:01] material why don't you leave that alone
[1:41:03] leave that to somebody else but that
[1:41:05] wasn't his ministry was it he had to say
[1:41:10] it and that was that was God leading him
[1:41:14] and guiding him because we gone so far
[1:41:17] away from the truth in any and many of
[1:41:19] our churches today have gone so far away
[1:41:21] from it that when you bring up these
[1:41:23] subjects it's like Foreigner you get
[1:41:25] even tightening from from the from Home
[1:41:29] Folks you know take a subject on you
[1:41:32] know the bride and the condition of the
[1:41:34] church and the women and the way they
[1:41:36] dress and every you know I really don't
[1:41:38] preach on it that much like I should and
[1:41:41] you know but still you preach on it once
[1:41:43] in a year and somebody say oh I sure
[1:41:45] appreciate that but you remember there's
[1:41:47] a balance wait wait wait wait wait what
[1:41:49] are you talking about the
[1:41:50] balance we I haven't preached on it in
[1:41:53] like for how long you said well remember
[1:41:55] there's a balance hey wait a
[1:41:59] minute the tapes are already
[1:42:02] balanced so every time you hear it on
[1:42:05] the tape you going to stop the Propet
[1:42:06] wait brother brand there's a balance to
[1:42:08] that you better say Amen to the
[1:42:11] word
[1:42:13] amen amen yes but I know it's tightening
[1:42:17] time cuz we're in Leo deia and I know
[1:42:19] it's a hard time it's the hardest time
[1:42:21] for you to be a young person to you be a
[1:42:24] father for me to be a pastor for you to
[1:42:26] be whatever you are it's the hardest age
[1:42:28] ever to do it but God has given us what
[1:42:31] we need marriage and divorce paragraph
[1:42:34] number four he says this here we've had
[1:42:36] a tremendous time in the Lord we're
[1:42:38] under great
[1:42:40] anticipations for this service and now
[1:42:43] tonight being the closing time for this
[1:42:46] four days paragraph 5 now I hope that
[1:42:50] the audience will not be nervous and I'm
[1:42:53] trusting the God that I will not be
[1:42:55] nervous for I've had a tremendous night
[1:42:59] a lot of
[1:43:01] strain for I realize that the things
[1:43:03] that I say this morning will be held
[1:43:06] against me in the day of
[1:43:08] judgment and I couldn't
[1:43:11] sleep and I know if I don't say them
[1:43:15] it'll be held against me in the day of
[1:43:18] judgment so it makes it hard you can't
[1:43:22] explain L it a't that beautiful how he
[1:43:25] opens his heart there and shows us that
[1:43:29] if he doesn't say these things this
[1:43:32] critical uh message on marriage and
[1:43:35] divorce caus from the original sin which
[1:43:38] was
[1:43:40] adultery and now he's trying to bring a
[1:43:43] church that had ages six ages before it
[1:43:48] that had it pretty much all wrong as he
[1:43:52] was standing talking to his uh audience
[1:43:55] he said there's a curtain before me and
[1:43:58] I have a crowd on the left and a crowd
[1:44:00] on the right because the the building or
[1:44:02] the hall that they had to rent or the
[1:44:04] school I believe it was and so he's um
[1:44:08] talking to these two different sides
[1:44:10] these two different portions of the
[1:44:11] audience and then the curtain there
[1:44:14] right before him and and then to me to
[1:44:17] me as I'm embracing this more the
[1:44:20] invisible audience is really his main
[1:44:26] audience can I get a witness the tape
[1:44:30] was
[1:44:33] recorded that raised it up above even
[1:44:36] those that were sitting there amen now
[1:44:39] it's to those that have an ear to hear
[1:44:43] Glory this message was to an
[1:44:46] invisible
[1:44:47] audience the people not even born yet
[1:44:51] people in problem and troubles they're
[1:44:54] not even on the earth yet but they need
[1:44:57] to hear this
[1:45:00] message thank God for the
[1:45:03] tapes cuz I was that invisible
[1:45:06] audience Hallelujah many of you were the
[1:45:09] invisible audience too you wasn't there
[1:45:13] GL huh but I'm there now there I'm
[1:45:17] listening to it now and I have the
[1:45:20] opportunity to hear what God says from
[1:45:24] this seven seal
[1:45:26] message so the invisible audience
[1:45:29] becomes a more important audience thank
[1:45:33] you than all the people that were in
[1:45:35] physically in the meetings beautiful to
[1:45:37] be in the meetings yes I'm not
[1:45:39] downplaying that but the recording is
[1:45:43] even if you were in the
[1:45:45] meetings huh even if you were in the
[1:45:48] meetings you still got
[1:45:51] to thank you hear me some here little
[1:45:54] damn
[1:45:55] there even if you were in the meetings
[1:45:57] you still got to go get the
[1:46:00] tape am I right about it somebody
[1:46:02] somebody help me so what was more
[1:46:04] important more important is the
[1:46:07] recording it's beautiful to be in the
[1:46:09] Bible days but the Bible has been
[1:46:12] written and recorded and now when I read
[1:46:15] it it's the word of the
[1:46:18] Lord to the believer that receive it so
[1:46:21] this invisible a audience is now
[1:46:23] highlighted Amen Brother Art and the
[1:46:26] Saints and Mesa yes it's the harder way
[1:46:31] it's the
[1:46:32] fourmost question in the believer's mind
[1:46:36] so here the prophet now is moving
[1:46:40] into this message
[1:46:43] now why is it so strict why is it so
[1:46:46] hard why are our churches so like they
[1:46:49] just on you like that why can't why
[1:46:52] can't we just compromise a little bit
[1:46:54] you know just water it down just a
[1:46:56] little bit become more like a
[1:46:59] Christian Christian
[1:47:02] Light Christian
[1:47:07] easy Christian um you know a
[1:47:11] remix of
[1:47:13] Christianity you sometime they remix the
[1:47:16] they remix stuff and it don't it ain't
[1:47:18] the
[1:47:20] same I remember they used to make the
[1:47:23] the anima
[1:47:25] syrup it used to be good but now it's
[1:47:28] not that good
[1:47:29] anymore they even cut her hair and
[1:47:31] bobbed her hair and they gave her a
[1:47:33] little lipstick how remember when she
[1:47:35] was a big big Aunt your mom had the big
[1:47:38] cheeks and
[1:47:39] everything I don't want the
[1:47:42] remix where's Big Mama
[1:47:47] at just give me what what you had before
[1:47:49] why you messing with the recipe
[1:47:53] and that's what they want you to do with
[1:47:54] this message they want you to remix It
[1:47:57] remake it our song service remix It
[1:48:00] remix remake how we operate How We Do
[1:48:03] how we handle sin re re reinvent
[1:48:06] marriage and divorce I'm so glad he
[1:48:08] preached the way he did and there's
[1:48:10] nobody else preaching it that way why
[1:48:13] because he's calling out a
[1:48:16] bride for the
[1:48:19] Rapture this is a harder way not a
[1:48:22] prophet of God continues in the message
[1:48:24] Abraham and this is that series of
[1:48:27] meetings that he was in when this
[1:48:28] prophecy was given I went back and
[1:48:30] looked up a few places there some of the
[1:48:32] things that he said and in
[1:48:35] 1961 he says in the message Abraham now
[1:48:38] let's follow Abraham paragraph 79 aimik
[1:48:42] said you know there's a beautiful Hebrew
[1:48:44] woman is that your husband no that's my
[1:48:47] brother he said that's right that's my
[1:48:50] sister which it it it which is was his
[1:48:55] half sister well so he said well I'll
[1:48:58] take her over to a palace she'll become
[1:49:00] my wife I'll give her a lot of things
[1:49:02] see I'll I'll give you a lot of things
[1:49:05] see all right so he took her over there
[1:49:09] could you imagine a man doing a thing
[1:49:10] like that so he stepped over there see
[1:49:14] why why he done it why did he
[1:49:19] compromise he was out of the promise he
[1:49:22] went down in Greer that's the reason
[1:49:26] your women chop off your hair you use
[1:49:28] makeup and you fellows smoke cigarettes
[1:49:30] and carry on the way you do you get out
[1:49:32] of the promise and still remain deacons
[1:49:35] and members and so forth like these
[1:49:38] Baptists Presbyterians methodists
[1:49:40] Pentecostals and so forth you just get
[1:49:43] right out of the promise that's
[1:49:45] all the devil pushed you and he stay
[1:49:50] over here where you be
[1:49:54] long prayed up that's right let the
[1:49:58] devil speak to you listen to him he's
[1:50:02] saying so he's saying why did Abraham
[1:50:06] get off the ground why did he compromise
[1:50:09] because he was out of the will of the
[1:50:11] Lord he didn't stay in the grounds that
[1:50:13] God called him to now every one of us is
[1:50:17] called to a post a place that we're
[1:50:21] supposed to be and when we get out of
[1:50:23] that place then that's where the
[1:50:25] compromise can
[1:50:27] happen sometimes it looks better you
[1:50:29] know it's Greener over there it's better
[1:50:32] over there but God called Abraham to not
[1:50:35] leave the promised land and he left
[1:50:38] because of a drought and he's trying to
[1:50:40] figure it out and that's what we do
[1:50:41] sometimes we try to manhandle things and
[1:50:44] figure it out for ourselves but God is
[1:50:47] the one who's in charge of Our Lives we
[1:50:51] got to stay with him stay with his word
[1:50:54] and he'll make everything else line up
[1:50:56] exactly the way it's supposed to line
[1:50:59] up and this is our this is the harder
[1:51:03] way you know for you to be a real
[1:51:06] Christian a True Believer today it's a
[1:51:10] harder way than the natural Believers or
[1:51:14] the carnal Believers out there you know
[1:51:17] the churches are full there are lots of
[1:51:19] options you can go to to be a part of a
[1:51:23] quote unquote Christian church and some
[1:51:24] of them do a very very fine job and
[1:51:28] those first few steps as a baby coming
[1:51:31] to Christ I mean you have to receive the
[1:51:34] Lord Jesus by faith that he paid the
[1:51:38] price at Calvary how many believe that I
[1:51:42] don't have anything I'm for that 100%
[1:51:46] And many of the churches they'll take
[1:51:48] you all the way to the Altar and bring
[1:51:50] you to Christ
[1:51:53] on the cross and making a decision for
[1:51:56] him and that's beautiful and we do that
[1:51:58] too here but then how much further can
[1:52:01] you go after you have come to Christ he
[1:52:05] wants to be involved with your life he
[1:52:09] wants your planning he wants to be in
[1:52:11] your planning he wants to be on your
[1:52:14] calendar he wants to know where you are
[1:52:17] going
[1:52:18] tomorrow and be involved with what kind
[1:52:21] of friends you have
[1:52:23] what are you listening to what are you
[1:52:26] influenced by he wants to know every
[1:52:30] detail about your life so you come to
[1:52:33] him that's beautiful but then the next
[1:52:36] step he wants to find out more about
[1:52:40] you so he cleans up starts convictions
[1:52:44] and starts little things and starts to
[1:52:47] pull on this and Nag on that and do I
[1:52:49] have to give that up some people come to
[1:52:51] Christ and they don't think they have to
[1:52:53] give up
[1:52:54] anything they just want to come to
[1:52:56] Christ and then go to heaven you're like
[1:52:59] no no no we got to clean you up brother
[1:53:02] we have to clean you up my
[1:53:04] sister
[1:53:06] yes and this is the harder way you might
[1:53:11] have to let go of some friends there
[1:53:13] might be some family members not like
[1:53:15] you no more you might have to change
[1:53:20] careers have you had have you thought
[1:53:22] about that you might have to move from
[1:53:25] where you are today in order to follow
[1:53:28] Christ Jesus said take up your cross and
[1:53:31] follow me remember he came to that rich
[1:53:34] man and he offered him he says come
[1:53:37] follow me and it was too great it was
[1:53:39] too much for him to sell all that he had
[1:53:44] to follow Jesus well if I sell all that
[1:53:46] I have Lord what about my investments
[1:53:49] what about my retirement what about if I
[1:53:51] get sick
[1:53:53] what about if I need some money I don't
[1:53:54] want to borrow no money I'm going to
[1:53:56] follow you where you going where you
[1:53:59] live at Jesus well I don't have a house
[1:54:02] if you don't have a house why am I
[1:54:04] following
[1:54:05] you you Jesus asked the rich man to
[1:54:09] follow him and Jesus was
[1:54:14] broke Naturally Speaking where you live
[1:54:16] Jesus
[1:54:17] like where you going to eat
[1:54:21] at where's your next meal like he's just
[1:54:24] going wherever he going preaching on a
[1:54:26] boat preaching in villages laying hands
[1:54:29] on lepers
[1:54:30] like no Jesus I need something more
[1:54:33] stable than that I need something more
[1:54:36] stable than that Lord if you want me to
[1:54:38] sell everything I got and to follow
[1:54:41] you
[1:54:43] yes he wants you to follow
[1:54:46] him he's the great Shepherd you're just
[1:54:50] a
[1:54:51] sheep you don't know where you're
[1:54:54] going you think you know where you're
[1:54:56] going but when you get real real sick
[1:54:59] and your money can't get the sickness
[1:55:01] off of you you going to need somebody
[1:55:03] that can heal you you get lost you get
[1:55:07] you get hurt you get pain you're going
[1:55:08] to need somebody and that somebody is
[1:55:11] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:55:15] amen it is the harder way it's the way
[1:55:19] that many have not gone it's the way of
[1:55:23] the cross the prophet of God Mo moves
[1:55:27] forward in this message here and he says
[1:55:29] this here in the message the true Easter
[1:55:31] seal praise the Lord he said this
[1:55:34] Pentecostal church if it would stand for
[1:55:37] another 2,000 years they'd be worse than
[1:55:39] the Catholic is now they're getting so
[1:55:42] far away from everything I was
[1:55:44] questioned the other day are you going
[1:55:47] to preach if you come to this place on
[1:55:50] women wearing makeup
[1:55:52] they shouldn't wear shorts shouldn't
[1:55:54] wear these things I said don't ask me
[1:55:57] then no sir don't ask me to come are you
[1:56:01] going to preach it they even said what
[1:56:04] business is that of yours I said it's
[1:56:07] the Lord's
[1:56:09] business and I'm about his business
[1:56:11] that's exactly right exactly so I said
[1:56:14] what do you do that for ain't them other
[1:56:17] things to say I said yeah but let them
[1:56:20] do that and then we'll talk on other
[1:56:22] things how many know there's some other
[1:56:24] things he talked about but don't deny
[1:56:27] these
[1:56:29] things you see so he let let's get the
[1:56:33] foundation laid that's what's the matter
[1:56:34] you're trying to jump on top of the
[1:56:36] ladder when you ought to be on the
[1:56:38] bottom yet see get started down here
[1:56:41] clean up get started right and then we
[1:56:44] could build upon that otherwise you
[1:56:48] cannot build because any foundation
[1:56:50] that's not built upon the principles of
[1:56:52] Christ will
[1:56:55] fall in the Bible it said it's an
[1:56:58] Abomination for a woman to wear a
[1:56:59] garment pertains to a man it hasn't
[1:57:01] changed one bit and God hasn't changed
[1:57:05] he's Eternal his his thoughts yesterday
[1:57:08] is the same as they are today and will
[1:57:11] be forever his spirit is the same
[1:57:13] yesterday today and forever his works is
[1:57:16] the same yesterday today and forever his
[1:57:18] Redemption is the same yesterday today
[1:57:20] and forever and he is the same yesterday
[1:57:25] today and forever there's no way of
[1:57:28] getting around it no the proof of the
[1:57:31] pudding is the eating thereof we know
[1:57:33] that is that right God said it was man
[1:57:37] was forced to make a
[1:57:39] decision what was they forced first in
[1:57:43] the days of Christ what was they forced
[1:57:45] to do they were forced first to accept
[1:57:49] him he showed them his sign his sealed
[1:57:51] he was the me Messiah how did he show it
[1:57:54] by just exactly what the Bible said he
[1:57:56] would do he was a prophet and he
[1:57:58] discerned the thoughts in their mind and
[1:58:02] they said he's a devil be elab they were
[1:58:05] forced to make a decision they could not
[1:58:09] hold it any longer neither can the
[1:58:12] Pentecostal church or the Baptist or the
[1:58:15] Presbyterian the Holy Ghost Christ has
[1:58:18] arisen and he's in the church amen and
[1:58:21] they say this man baptizes in the name
[1:58:23] of Jesus he believes you don't have to
[1:58:26] speak with tongues for the Holy Ghost
[1:58:27] and things like that that's not the
[1:58:29] initial evidence he believes in women or
[1:58:31] women all wearing their hair like that I
[1:58:34] think it has nothing to do with it then
[1:58:37] why is God vindicating that this is the
[1:58:41] truth find out where it's at they
[1:58:44] refused his messiahship when he showed
[1:58:47] them he was the Messiah they were forced
[1:58:51] to say something and so are they today
[1:58:56] turning it down and won't sponsor it
[1:58:58] washing their hands from it the decision
[1:59:01] is forced upon them there's no Middle
[1:59:04] Road where at the end time man is forced
[1:59:06] to receive it or reject it you've got to
[1:59:10] accept it or turn it away it's forced
[1:59:13] upon America it's forced upon the
[1:59:16] brandom Tabernacle it's forced upon the
[1:59:19] Pentecostals on the Methodist it's
[1:59:21] forced first
[1:59:23] everywhere you have to take it or leave
[1:59:25] it God has confirmed his word showing
[1:59:28] his sign back in his ministry showing
[1:59:32] exactly what he is by proving that he's
[1:59:35] God Jesus said if I do not the works of
[1:59:38] my father then don't believe me see they
[1:59:42] can't find nothing in that because
[1:59:44] that's true why don't they receive it
[1:59:46] it's because of a denomination they
[1:59:48] can't receive it so they are forced now
[1:59:51] to make a
[1:59:53] showdown can I keep reading and in Ohio
[1:59:56] just a few days ago the same churches
[1:59:58] that sponsored me a year ago because I
[2:00:01] attacked it and showed that it was wrong
[2:00:04] there wasn't one of them but one Church
[2:00:06] brother Sullivan would cooperate I said
[2:00:08] I still have the same hand I still have
[2:00:10] the same feet I still have the same
[2:00:12] message I'm still brother brandom what's
[2:00:15] the matter with me it's not me the Holy
[2:00:18] Spirit still speaks the Holy Spirit
[2:00:22] still does the same Works he still shows
[2:00:25] it but you're forced that's right they
[2:00:29] are forced and the great Holy Spirit
[2:00:31] falling right in their midst and
[2:00:33] speaking the words and saying the things
[2:00:35] that he said see so brother bandam is
[2:00:39] bringing this to the people that it
[2:00:43] comes the time where they're forced to
[2:00:46] make a decision we know that right
[2:00:49] around 1962 and just before brother
[2:00:52] Bam's Ministry was on the
[2:00:55] decline in the sense of opportunities to
[2:00:59] preach they started to close the door on
[2:01:02] him finally when he moved here to tucon
[2:01:05] he said he didn't have any nobody
[2:01:07] invited him to preach for three years
[2:01:10] the greatest Ministry that they'd ever
[2:01:12] seen or would ever see in in that
[2:01:16] respect like a a Ministry uh uh that had
[2:01:19] a you know a Revival
[2:01:22] a a pastor a A Prophet that God used is
[2:01:27] in your city and you're a church and a
[2:01:30] pastor but you wouldn't open your pull
[2:01:32] pit to him and he had he used to have
[2:01:34] open doors all over but now his ministry
[2:01:37] is closing down and tightening down and
[2:01:40] he had to make these harder decisions he
[2:01:44] had to take subjects and titles that no
[2:01:48] one else would
[2:01:49] touch and we thank God that he did it
[2:01:53] that he stayed true to the
[2:01:55] word God showed him a vision and he
[2:01:58] shared with us the vision and then some
[2:02:02] people argue say it ain't going to
[2:02:03] happen and run aren't you glad that he
[2:02:05] showed it to you he revealed to us these
[2:02:09] great truths these great visions that
[2:02:12] would take place first second and third
[2:02:15] poem and now he's preaching on you know
[2:02:19] serpent seed and marriage and divorce
[2:02:22] and the the the the the conduct of women
[2:02:26] today and women preachers had gone just
[2:02:30] rampid and people women called the
[2:02:32] preach and he stood against that my
[2:02:35] goodness and so they asked him are you
[2:02:37] going to preach on the women when you
[2:02:39] come here he's like well don't invite me
[2:02:41] to come because he had to preach it not
[2:02:45] in the bad attitude but that was his
[2:02:48] message and here he was 1961 is all
[2:02:52] coming together now because you have
[2:02:55] chosen the harder way you have walked in
[2:02:59] your own choosing I didn't force you to
[2:03:02] do it you made that choice you walked in
[2:03:05] your own choosing and you chose the
[2:03:08] harder way but the harder way is my way
[2:03:14] Glory Glory Hallelujah oh my what a
[2:03:18] constellation that must have been it's
[2:03:21] the heart way this you know the in
[2:03:24] invitations are dropping I know I'm not
[2:03:26] as popular as I used to be they don't
[2:03:28] want me coming to their convention uh
[2:03:30] you know the others that sprung off of
[2:03:32] my Ministry their Ministries are growing
[2:03:34] greater than mine here I am out here in
[2:03:37] the city and they won't even come they
[2:03:39] won't invite me to come to their to
[2:03:40] their meetings anymore you chose the
[2:03:44] harder way but the harder way is my way
[2:03:50] oh my how many are willing to take the
[2:03:52] harder way today the harder way is his
[2:03:56] way it's God's way it's not the popular
[2:04:01] way it's not the way where you get the
[2:04:03] most money or the most Fame it's not the
[2:04:07] way where you're appreciated like you
[2:04:09] should be appreciated it's not the way
[2:04:11] of comfort and ease you're not going to
[2:04:15] retire as a you know a nice uh over you
[2:04:18] know just a you know just a soft
[2:04:21] lifestyle
[2:04:22] you got to be able to cut with the twoed
[2:04:25] sword all the days of your life you got
[2:04:29] to cut
[2:04:31] it you got to say things that are
[2:04:35] uncomfortable how many the people that
[2:04:36] love you people that encourage with you
[2:04:39] come up with these little ideas let's do
[2:04:41] this let's do that where'd you get that
[2:04:43] idea from where the next church is do
[2:04:44] let's do this let's do that you got to
[2:04:46] stay with the
[2:04:48] word amen it's the harder way Hallelujah
[2:04:52] but it is my
[2:04:54] way oh why don't you look at your
[2:04:56] neighbor and say the harder
[2:04:59] way say it like you mean it the harder
[2:05:03] way is God's
[2:05:07] way that's the way I want to go I want
[2:05:11] to go you know when he when he walked
[2:05:13] that rugged the the the the Via De La
[2:05:16] Rosa when he walked those steps where
[2:05:19] was The Fanboys at then
[2:05:22] where was all the people that he fed
[2:05:25] what about the
[2:05:27] lepers what about all the people that he
[2:05:30] rose them up in their life and helped
[2:05:33] them in their Ministry in their life
[2:05:35] where were they amen but it was God's
[2:05:39] way and he walked all by himself didn't
[2:05:41] he why did he walk all by himself so
[2:05:44] that you can walk by yourself if you
[2:05:47] have to remember you're never alone he's
[2:05:51] walking with you you're never alone he's
[2:05:56] a witness with you today
[2:06:01] Glory sometimes the doctors give you
[2:06:03] report and it's it's just going one way
[2:06:07] and all the examples is just going one
[2:06:09] way it looks like you're the only one
[2:06:10] standing but you're not alone you got
[2:06:13] Isaiah 53 1 through five that said he
[2:06:18] was wounded and bruised so that you can
[2:06:22] be healed
[2:06:24] amen sometimes you got to take a stand
[2:06:27] on the
[2:06:28] word everything is looking worse
[2:06:31] everything is looking crazy and
[2:06:33] traumatic but you stay with God's word
[2:06:37] and he will be with you it's the harder
[2:06:41] way but it's God's
[2:06:43] way
[2:06:46] amen glory to
[2:06:48] God Lord help me Hallelujah to stay in
[2:06:52] the heart way to stay with the
[2:06:55] vision all of them stay with the visions
[2:06:59] and the prophecies even the
[2:07:01] uncomfortable
[2:07:03] ones you hear Brother R talk about his
[2:07:05] third pool and he mentioned that so many
[2:07:09] times how many know he mentioned the
[2:07:11] tent Vision hold on don't say nothing
[2:07:13] about that Brothers don't say why
[2:07:16] not I love it somebody said open it up

[2:07:26] that tell me some more about it go get
[2:07:29] the tape go get the tape and get the
[2:07:33] vision that the prophet brought and then
[2:07:35] you feed on
[2:07:39] that it's the harder way oh my I know
[2:07:42] when I say that people get nervous yeah
[2:07:45] they get nervous but that ain't my
[2:07:47] problem that's a them
[2:07:49] problem we ought to be rejoicing when we
[2:07:52] bring
[2:07:53] out
[2:07:55] amen man what church am I am
[2:07:58] anyway I hope I'm in God's
[2:08:02] Church there ain't no scripture or
[2:08:04] quotes that offend us or is there
[2:08:08] huh okay now but the Visions it's the
[2:08:12] harder way brother bam talked about this
[2:08:16] great
[2:08:17] ministry that would unfold in the last
[2:08:20] days he called it a bride and he saw the
[2:08:23] preview of her now he takes that in July
[2:08:27] of
[2:08:28] 1964 I shared a bit of it with you
[2:08:31] before I'll touch on it for you again
[2:08:34] here today and you said brother you
[2:08:37] preached on that before well you got you
[2:08:39] get the chance to say Amen
[2:08:41] again and then when you going to stop
[2:08:43] preaching on it when I'm raptured you
[2:08:46] won't have to hear about it no more when
[2:08:48] we're out of here we won't have to hear
[2:08:49] about it no more you see this is not
[2:08:52] radio content this is not a television
[2:08:55] series that I have to keep new fresh
[2:08:58] this is the word this is the word of the
[2:09:02] Lord I'm not writing a
[2:09:04] book I am re I'm preaching the gospel
[2:09:08] and every time you hear the word of the
[2:09:11] Lord it should be opening up something
[2:09:13] to you fresh and new every morning so I
[2:09:18] embrace this you know harder way is my
[2:09:21] way he has this you know experience that
[2:09:25] the The Voice spoke to him he had three
[2:09:27] Witnesses of people that didn't know him
[2:09:29] the the the person from the UN and then
[2:09:32] another person that was right there and
[2:09:34] uh uh I forget the third Witnesses but
[2:09:37] there were three witnesses that wrote it
[2:09:38] out this brother that was taking minutes
[2:09:40] of the meeting and they wrote out this
[2:09:43] prophecy it's the harder way and this
[2:09:45] will bring and come to pass the
[2:09:47] tremendous victory in love divine
[2:09:53] you might think you're preaching love
[2:09:55] but if it ain't the harder way it's
[2:09:57] really not love because Real Love is
[2:10:03] corrective now brother brandom deals
[2:10:07] with this um and I shared it with you
[2:10:10] all just a little bit on the influence

[2:14:55] on it and hear it straighten out the two
[2:14:59] um extremes that he calls them one went
[2:15:03] on the right one went on the left and
[2:15:04] there were two
[2:15:06] extremes and he brings it that they both
[2:15:10] have a truth but the truth lays in the
[2:15:12] middle of the road and if you really
[2:15:14] look at all of the doctrines that he
[2:15:16] brings it all Lays in the middle of the
[2:15:19] road you can go on Extreme many things
[2:15:22] and you want to be balanced in any
[2:15:25] teaching or any Scripture you want to
[2:15:29] take all of it comprehensively
[2:15:31] everything that he says about it and not
[2:15:34] just be rigid in one way or the
[2:15:37] other and so maybe I'll slip in
[2:15:40] something here on on the music on the
[2:15:42] music program you know there's a there's
[2:15:45] a you know what you call Christian music
[2:15:47] and then you have you know you got you
[2:15:49] know different uh examples of people
[2:15:52] that call whatever they call Christian
[2:15:54] music and then you have cultures that
[2:15:56] have their certain style of music and
[2:15:58] then some like it fast some with it beat
[2:16:00] some with a little slow but you know it
[2:16:03] it still comes down to you got to have
[2:16:06] the Holy
[2:16:09] Spirit you got to have the Holy Spirit
[2:16:12] he leads you and guides you you're
[2:16:16] trying to Worship the
[2:16:18] Lord it can't just be because somebody
[2:16:21] else says it's wrong or somebody else
[2:16:23] says it's right you have the Holy Spirit
[2:16:26] you have the examples and you have the
[2:16:31] scriptures that tells you if it's okay
[2:16:33] or not and so when I first came into the
[2:16:36] message I'm not g to finish this today
[2:16:39] so I know that when I first came into
[2:16:42] the message it was just different very
[2:16:44] everything was different the the beat
[2:16:46] the offbeat the onbeat the say in my
[2:16:49] notes I'm just talking
[2:16:52] very different so what I did with all my
[2:16:54] music Good gospel music brother will I
[2:16:57] had a nice little Library I got rid of
[2:16:59] all of
[2:17:00] it please somebody give me them tapes
[2:17:04] back beautiful music music from my
[2:17:07] childhood it was cornbread it was beans
[2:17:10] it was
[2:17:12] flavor it was Mama's
[2:17:15] cooking and then I come out to a place
[2:17:18] when I'm not going to criticize but I
[2:17:19] was eating but it wasn't Mama's cooking
[2:17:23] talking about the music and so I got
[2:17:25] into that and this because everything I
[2:17:28] was doing quote unquote was wrong but
[2:17:31] you know you got to be led by the Holy
[2:17:33] Spirit you got to look and see what what
[2:17:35] and then look in the word look in the
[2:17:37] message actually and the message opened
[2:17:41] up to me that God made me the way that I
[2:17:46] am and I'm not supposed to try to be
[2:17:49] like somebody else house be what God
[2:17:52] made if God made me when I'm singing by
[2:17:56] myself this is how I
[2:18:04] sing now some of y'all can only see
[2:18:07] through the glasses when they on your
[2:18:10] head but it's other people can see too
[2:18:13] now and you need to travel a little bit
[2:18:15] that's probably what you need to do and
[2:18:17] you need to go to an orchestra and watch
[2:18:19] a Orchestra play and
[2:18:21] perform and it give you some
[2:18:24] range of difference and God is a god of
[2:18:27] variety huh is he what if everybody look
[2:18:32] like me y'all take off
[2:18:36] running right but God's a god of
[2:18:40] variety he made you exactly the way he
[2:18:43] made you all the details all the flaws
[2:18:47] all whatever it is he made you and he
[2:18:50] made every human being it's it's his
[2:18:53] design and it's beautiful when it stays
[2:18:56] in its original in it's the original way
[2:18:59] that God made it Satan can get in any of
[2:19:02] it sure can get in any of it okay so why
[2:19:07] we get into that but God's a god of
[2:19:10] variety and um he makes us and he gives
[2:19:13] us a uh H H he he leads us by the holy
[2:19:19] spirit amen so the message marriage and
[2:19:23] divorce is your message if you embrace
[2:19:27] it as yours and then you take that and
[2:19:29] you Embrace that for yourself sister you
[2:19:33] the way you dress and the way you go
[2:19:34] about and if you think it's somebody
[2:19:36] says it's too tight or it's it's looking
[2:19:39] worldly you need to talk to your husband
[2:19:41] about that because it is about him right
[2:19:44] or is it about you amen amen and so you
[2:19:47] should really talk to I mean right
[2:19:52] amen so so so it's got to make sense to
[2:19:55] you and preaching and reading a quote to
[2:19:58] you is not going to correct your heart
[2:20:01] and me reading any Vision to you is not
[2:20:03] going to correct your heart you have to
[2:20:05] be led by the Holy Spirit to do what
[2:20:07] you're doing and then when the holy
[2:20:10] spirit gives you the okay to do it you
[2:20:12] don't have to worry about getting
[2:20:13] permission from nobody else you just go
[2:20:16] forward this is you know this is why
[2:20:18] this what I like to do how I worship the
[2:20:20] Lord
[2:20:21] amen so now the prophet is bringing this
[2:20:25] here and this one little place in
[2:20:27] paragraph 258 as he's bringing this
[2:20:30] message and um and it's really really
[2:20:35] good it's a it's it's really caught me
[2:20:38] I've had to go back and and hear it
[2:20:41] several
[2:20:42] times and I did not bring my watch to
[2:20:46] the pull pit somebody say praise the
[2:20:49] Lord prise the Lord
[2:20:53] everybody didn't say praise the
[2:20:55] lord it's okay it's all
[2:20:58] right what time is it somebody just tell
[2:21:00] me
[2:21:02] quickly brother obey your
[2:21:06] pastor what time is it please 12:00 12
[2:21:09] o' thank
[2:21:11] you thank you
[2:21:13] sis now answer the rest of the questions
[2:21:16] I asked
[2:21:17] too all right 12:00 no we're going to
[2:21:20] close just now so just get this point
[2:21:22] here in with
[2:21:24] Esther so she refuses now get get the
[2:21:28] point now she had her own party too now
[2:21:31] so the king had a party then she has her
[2:21:34] own party and then when the king tells
[2:21:36] her to do something she disobeys the
[2:21:39] king so what happens here then the king
[2:21:41] said to the wise men verse 13 which knew
[2:21:45] the times for so was the king's manner
[2:21:47] towards all that knew law and judgment
[2:21:50] and next unto him were these gentlemen
[2:21:53] as he speaks in verse 15 he says what
[2:21:55] shall we do unto the queen vashi
[2:21:57] according to the law because she had not
[2:22:00] performed the Commandment of the
[2:22:02] King aerus by the chamber liims and
[2:22:08] mman answered before the king and
[2:22:11] said answered before the king and the
[2:22:14] princes vases the queen hath not done
[2:22:17] wrong to the king only but also to all
[2:22:20] the the princes and to all the people
[2:22:24] that are in all the provinces of the
[2:22:26] king of azerus for this deed of the
[2:22:30] queen shall come abroad unto all women
[2:22:34] so that they shall despise their
[2:22:36] husbands in their eyes when it shall be
[2:22:39] reported the king
[2:22:42] azerus commanded vasi the queen to be
[2:22:45] brought in before him but she came not
[2:22:48] likewise shall the ladies of Persia and
[2:22:50] M us say this day shall say this day
[2:22:54] unto all the king's princes which have
[2:22:57] heard of the deed of the queen thus
[2:22:59] shall there arise too much contempt and
[2:23:02] wrath if it please the
[2:23:05] king Let There Go a royal commandment
[2:23:08] from him let it be written among the
[2:23:11] laws of the Persians and the mes that it
[2:23:14] be not altered that vashi come no more
[2:23:17] before the king azerus and let the King
[2:23:20] give her Royal Estate unto another that
[2:23:23] is better than she and when the king's
[2:23:26] decree which he shall make shall be
[2:23:28] published throughout all his Empire for
[2:23:30] it is great all the wives shall give
[2:23:34] give to their husbands honor both to
[2:23:36] Great and Small and the same pleased the
[2:23:40] king and the Princess and the King did
[2:23:41] according to the word of Muk man Muk
[2:23:46] KH for he sent letters into the king's
[2:23:50] prophet provinces to every Province
[2:23:52] according to the writing thereof to
[2:23:54] every people after their language that
[2:23:56] every man should bear rule in his own
[2:24:02] house and that it should be published
[2:24:04] according to the language of every
[2:24:08] people so this influence had to be
[2:24:13] stopped and it started you know it
[2:24:17] started with the
[2:24:19] head the
[2:24:22] head uh Lady of the lady of ladies she
[2:24:25] was the leader of all of these other
[2:24:28] nations her
[2:24:30] example and her to do this would cause a
[2:24:34] horrible influence to not just to this
[2:24:37] little Province but to all of the other
[2:24:40] ones too it sets a precedent so it's
[2:24:43] harsh he probably no doubt loved his
[2:24:46] wife his Queen she was beautiful but he
[2:24:48] had to make this law and in order to
[2:24:51] correct the
[2:24:52] error and in correcting any kind of
[2:24:55] error now you can start looking around
[2:24:57] and start getting you know make take it
[2:24:59] personal but it's not for you to take
[2:25:01] personal this is God's
[2:25:03] word you got to get you got to get it
[2:25:06] right because why why you'll be held
[2:25:09] accountable you men brothers you'll be
[2:25:12] held accountable how you hold your post
[2:25:15] of Duty you'll be held accountable to
[2:25:18] answer for your wife and your family
[2:25:22] that's what the Bible says and that's
[2:25:24] uncomfortable but that's what I have to
[2:25:26] remind you of and the prophet says I'll
[2:25:29] be held at the day of judgment for the
[2:25:32] things that I say and if I don't say it
[2:25:35] I'll be held at the day of judgment so
[2:25:37] he had to stay with that word and it was
[2:25:40] the harder
[2:25:41] way he preached the message on the west
[2:25:45] coast there and he's dealing with all of
[2:25:48] the sin in the West Coast Co and he he's
[2:25:51] talking about it in Jehovah Gyra
[2:25:54] 1961 he he says
[2:25:56] that in paragraph 48 and I'll close with
[2:26:00] this one here all
[2:26:03] right heal the sick Save The Lost get
[2:26:05] glory to thyself for it is all for your
[2:26:09] glory Lord It's not nothing to us we're
[2:26:12] just it's our sympathy our heart we feel
[2:26:16] that it helped the people it's something
[2:26:19] to help the church why would we be here
[2:26:22] would would be much better for me to be
[2:26:25] home this morning in my Tabernacle and
[2:26:28] with my wife and babies and them calling
[2:26:31] me on the phone crying being Lonesome
[2:26:35] and oh God have I spent 31 years of my
[2:26:38] life out on the field here how easy
[2:26:41] would would how easy it would for me to
[2:26:44] go home but God something down in my
[2:26:47] heart stays says stay there on the west
[2:26:51] coast where sin's abounding stay there
[2:26:54] where the wall for East and West is
[2:26:56] meeting like the wind sweeping across
[2:26:59] and blowing the contamination against
[2:27:02] this West Coast here where Cults and
[2:27:05] things is not known anywhere else in the
[2:27:08] country God why would we stand here
[2:27:11] because it's your commission how are we
[2:27:15] going to Break Down The Walls I don't
[2:27:17] know Lord but you're Jehovah Gyra that
[2:27:19] can provide hide yourself away we'll
[2:27:22] stand because in our hearts we feel that
[2:27:25] we could help your precious little
[2:27:27] church that's struggling along the coast
[2:27:30] among all this Hollywood
[2:27:33] glamour all of this other stuff God
[2:27:36] somehow you'll call your elected those
[2:27:39] who he forne he called those who he
[2:27:42] called he justified those who he
[2:27:45] justified he's already glorified lord
[2:27:47] they're here somewhere speak to them
[2:27:49] Lord as we work in labor and love to
[2:27:52] bring your church out of the
[2:27:57] chaos granted
[2:27:59] father
[2:28:01] amen that's what this message does it
[2:28:06] brings the church out of chaos so when
[2:28:09] you get to that marriage and divorce
[2:28:11] take paragraph 256 and brother man is
[2:28:13] bringing in there on the reasons or how
[2:28:17] um remarriage could be he brings up that
[2:28:20] example and he just leaves it like that
[2:28:23] and he brings the vision of the Bride
[2:28:26] July of 64 we don't have time to get
[2:28:29] into it we have time but I won't take it
[2:28:32] I'll just get a a a a quick definition
[2:28:35] for you here of what that preview of The
[2:28:38] Bride is it's an an inspection or
[2:28:40] viewing of something before is
[2:28:43] brought it becomes generally known and
[2:28:46] available to view or to show beforehand
[2:28:50] so he was given a preview of the rme
[2:28:54] receive or give a preview of to see hear
[2:28:58] or show something before it is available
[2:29:02] to the public so that Vision he saw the
[2:29:05] preview of the Bride he saw what she
[2:29:07] looked like before it was available to
[2:29:10] the public to give a general description
[2:29:13] of something that will happen in the
[2:29:16] future that's what a preview is to see
[2:29:19] an example example of what something
[2:29:22] will look like so this preview of The
[2:29:26] Bride where he sees her and how she was
[2:29:29] dressed and how she was walking and what
[2:29:33] she was wearing compared to what the
[2:29:35] other church was doing and it was a
[2:29:38] church we're not talking about people in
[2:29:40] the bar or people out there World we're
[2:29:42] talking about it was the other church
[2:29:45] was dancing to rock and roll
[2:29:49] music led by a witch they were still a
[2:29:52] part of the church they look horrible
[2:29:55] they're they're morally he saw them he
[2:29:58] said he was ashamed to look at them they
[2:30:00] were stripped with no clothes on in the
[2:30:03] name of the church and he said that's
[2:30:05] how God sees
[2:30:08] it and this age in this day brother and
[2:30:12] sister brother and sister if you're
[2:30:16] going to make it out of this age to be a
[2:30:18] part of the Bride for the rapture
[2:30:20] it is the harder way you will be in the
[2:30:25] minority and and you can't let other
[2:30:28] another church um you can't let another
[2:30:31] sister influence you on how you should
[2:30:36] dress my little sister or M and grandmas
[2:30:40] or whoever you might be because that's
[2:30:43] the influence I seen it I remember we
[2:30:45] moved to Montreal it was not a bad thing
[2:30:47] but you know come in one style of hair
[2:30:50] big braids and then another one get and
[2:30:52] before you know all the people have the
[2:30:54] same kind of style of hair and it just
[2:30:57] sister speaking of and then you'll see
[2:30:59] that and you just see these little
[2:31:01] things that that's alloud and aligned
[2:31:03] and so forth H H we have an example
[2:31:08] we've seen the preview didn't we the
[2:31:11] preview of the
[2:31:14] Bride go get that go read it it's before
[2:31:17] the public before it happened that
[2:31:20] Vision if it's true and we believe it is
[2:31:22] that's a preview of what we should be
[2:31:24] looking like and we should not be
[2:31:27] looking like the
[2:31:29] denominations
[2:31:33] huh God has given us an example we
[2:31:37] believe in the Holy Ghost signs wonders
[2:31:40] Miracles believe in the love of Christ
[2:31:43] we believe in being as nice and
[2:31:46] respectful as we can showing love to all
[2:31:50] people all
[2:31:52] men doors are open to anyone we'll
[2:31:56] cooperate with them but we don't
[2:31:57] compromise for no one God help us to
[2:32:02] stay in that narrow way God help us let
[2:32:08] us

[2:32:15] blessings upon our service today

[2:35:41] the the message on the lifeline app and
[2:35:45] brother Brandon was praying for he was
[2:35:49] talking about about the meeting with the
[2:35:51] president with
[2:35:53] Russia and he says that they have what
[2:35:56] it takes to
[2:35:58] blow America up and and so forth and he
[2:36:01] says but what's keeping it from
[2:36:04] happening he said it's the saints that
[2:36:07] there're still righteous people in this
[2:36:09] country and we know that's going to
[2:36:11] happen one day sometimes we think it's
[2:36:13] our own achievement or abilities but
[2:36:16] it's the holy spirit in The Believer
[2:36:19] that's keeping it from happening where
[2:36:21] are we at Saints look at the hour that
[2:36:24] we're live looking in look at the
[2:36:26] technology the AI and the the all of the
[2:36:29] things that are going on with the world
