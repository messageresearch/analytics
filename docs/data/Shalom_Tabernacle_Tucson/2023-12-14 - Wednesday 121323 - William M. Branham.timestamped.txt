[28:27] bless you
[28:28] now for a text I want to take this far a
[28:32] text this morning the sudden secret
[28:36] going away of the
[28:39] church now let me announce it again
[28:42] because I haven't had very much time to
[28:45] premeditate on any comments but just
[28:48] hurrying we were out late yesterday and
[28:50] never got in last night till real late
[28:53] and rushing down here this morning but
[28:55] this just come to my mind
[28:58] and maybe later I might catch something
[29:02] that would do someone good I love this
[29:05] subject the sudden secret catching away
[29:09] of the
[29:10] church and now in first Thessalonians
[29:13] the 5th
[29:15] chapter but all the times and all the
[29:18] seasons Brethren you have no need that I
[29:21] write unto
[29:23] you for you yourselves know perfect ly
[29:28] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[29:31] thief in the
[29:33] night for when they shall say peace and
[29:37] safety then sudden destructions cometh
[29:41] upon them as trevail upon a woman with
[29:46] child and they shall not
[29:50] Escape but ye Brethren are not in
[29:54] darkness that that day should overtake
[29:56] you as as a
[29:59] thief ye are the children of the light
[30:03] and the children of the
[30:06] day we are not of the night are of
[30:10] Darkness therefore let us not sleep as
[30:14] do
[30:15] others but let us watch and be
[30:19] sober for they that sleep sleep in the
[30:24] night and they that be drunken are
[30:29] drunken in the
[30:31] night now I wish you to look just across
[30:34] the page if it is so geographically
[30:36] arranged in your Bible to the 16th 17th
[30:41] and 18th verses of the fourth chapter of
[30:44] first
[30:47] Thessalonians for the Lord himself shall
[30:51] descend from heaven with a
[30:55] shout and with the voice voice of the
[30:58] Archangel and with the Trump of God and
[31:01] the deading Christ shall rise
[31:05] first then we which are alive and remain
[31:09] shall be caught up together with them in
[31:11] the
[31:12] clouds to meet the Lord in the
[31:16] air and so shall we ever be with the
[31:21] Lord wherefore Comfort one another with
[31:25] these words
[31:28] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[31:31] reading of his holy
[31:35] word this is an unusual thing to speak
[31:39] of a subject like this on a morning that
[31:42] I come down to to minister to the
[31:47] sick but there is a greater sickness
[31:51] Than Physical
[31:53] sickness and it's much more essential
[31:57] that we be well for this great event
[32:01] that's just fixing to take place than it
[32:04] would be to be even asleep in the Lord
[32:07] that is dead as we would know
[32:12] it it's better to be ready I would
[32:16] rather be a sick man ready with the Lord
[32:20] than to be a well man not ready to go
[32:23] with the
[32:25] law yes but however it be God is so
[32:30] willing that we be both well and ready
[32:34] amen soul and
[32:36] body for he forgives all of our
[32:39] iniquities and heals all our
[32:44] diseases he died for a compound
[32:49] purpose and then I thinking today on
[32:54] this subject of the
[32:58] sudden and
[33:01] secret I like that God is people live
[33:06] today as though just before the coming
[33:10] of the Lord Jesus if he was going to
[33:13] send a host of angels down to all the
[33:17] newspapers and for a year of so
[33:20] announced it throughout all the world in
[33:23] the newspaper that on a such and such a
[33:26] date Jesus will
[33:29] arrive and to have it broadcast by the
[33:32] radio and put on the televisions and
[33:35] everywhere just the day and just the
[33:39] hour that he was
[33:42] coming now that's the way people live
[33:45] today but God has said in his word that
[33:49] it would be like a thief in the night
[33:54] coming if that would be so people would
[33:57] say as the world thinks today oh well
[34:01] there is just plenty of time H it'll be
[34:05] well announced and but you see it is
[34:09] announced but it's a secret
[34:14] announcing it's just those who are
[34:17] willing to hear
[34:19] it those who are willing to consider it
[34:22] and
[34:23] to who loves the
[34:25] law
[34:27] I think now of what Paul said when he
[34:30] said there is a crown of righteousness
[34:34] laid up for
[34:36] me that the Lord the righteous judge
[34:39] will give me at that day and then he
[34:43] stops did you notice and said not only
[34:47] me but to all them that love his
[34:54] appearing if we love is
[34:58] appearing usually in the world today
[35:02] that people think of the appearing of
[35:04] the Lord as a horrible Dreadful thing oh
[35:09] the world might come to its don't talk
[35:12] to me about that they'll
[35:14] say they don't want to know about those
[35:19] things they don't care about them just
[35:23] for the present day living but those who
[35:26] love of the Lord love is
[35:30] appearing what if one of your loved on
[35:33] some of you older people that your
[35:36] mother was gone on or your father or
[35:39] your
[35:41] baby and they were been away for so many
[35:45] years and you know that they might
[35:48] appear at any time why you'd have the
[35:51] house all cleaned
[35:53] up you would just be ready and watch
[35:56] watching down that road for every car
[35:59] light that turned in you'd think it
[36:01] would be D now that's the way the church
[36:04] ought to be watching for the coming of
[36:07] the
[36:08] Lord all in
[36:11] order all
[36:13] ready all packed up and ready to go as
[36:18] soon as he comes because it'll be in a
[36:21] moment in a twinkling of an
[36:24] eye just try to time how long it would
[36:28] take your eye to
[36:30] twinkle that's just how quick the
[36:32] Rapture of the church will take place
[36:37] amen you know the enemy always uses the
[36:42] tactics that the uh that the Lord
[36:47] uses you know when he seen that God was
[36:50] going to have a righteous church and the
[36:53] things that he was going to do the enemy
[36:55] used that same
[36:58] strategy he's got a
[37:01] church and he's got a people that's very
[37:07] religious and they're just right on the
[37:10] toe as as religious
[37:14] people because he knows that Christ
[37:17] Church is the same
[37:19] way and he does it out in military
[37:23] line I was reading an article some time
[37:27] ago on the sudden attack on Pearl
[37:33] Harbor that wasn't no exactly any
[37:37] unknown
[37:40] attack they had already been warned that
[37:43] the Jacks were going to do
[37:46] that but the sad part was they ignored
[37:50] that
[37:53] warning they had seen signs
[37:58] and the Japanese Army assembling
[38:01] themselves
[38:02] together and the big ships being loaded
[38:05] with
[38:07] ammunition and the threat was in the
[38:11] air and they were just exactly in line
[38:15] for the
[38:17] invasion but they ignored
[38:20] it that's the way it is today with the
[38:25] church the church church is in line of
[38:30] judgment but they are ignoring the
[38:33] coming of the
[38:35] Lord so you can't blame
[38:38] him they said when it was noise to
[38:41] brought around in Pearl Harbor that the
[38:45] Japs could attacked it any time if their
[38:47] big Fleet had set out in the waters of
[38:51] the sea and was moving slowly but
[38:55] steadily toward Pearl
[38:58] Harbor that thing only laughed at it and
[39:03] said oh
[39:05] nonsense you Gloom Builders You Weary
[39:09] works all you think about is some
[39:15] trouble and on the night just before the
[39:18] great attack the next
[39:20] morning there was a
[39:22] great dance or a big party
[39:27] given in Pearl Harbor
[39:30] itself and no matter how much they tried
[39:33] to
[39:35] say that the Jets were coming they still
[39:39] would not take
[39:43] warning let's just look on them for a
[39:46] few
[39:47] minutes there's a little radio bulletin
[39:50] goes
[39:52] out and a little piece in the corner of
[39:55] the paper about like a healing campaign
[39:57] would be advertised just a small place
[40:01] that the Jacks were on their Road in the
[40:04] waters of the sea a great
[40:08] fleet was headed that way nonsense says
[40:12] the others we don't believe in no such
[40:15] stuff as that what are you trying to
[40:17] scare us
[40:19] about and then we find getting close to
[40:23] the night I can see at the home place
[40:26] instead of them preparing for to get out
[40:29] of the city why the young girls were all
[40:32] putting on their new FRS and so forth
[40:36] they were going down to this great big
[40:39] uh Jubilee they were going to
[40:42] have and also the officers of the army
[40:47] were just busy riding little passes so
[40:51] that the soldiers could all attend this
[40:54] party big drunken party
[40:56] party and the trucks were roaring and
[41:00] humming bringing in their best of beer
[41:03] and their wine and stuff for this
[41:07] party and all the
[41:10] time the Japanese feet on its Road there
[41:14] and they fail to hear the
[41:20] warning as the sun begin to
[41:25] set and they all gathered in this great
[41:28] Tavern of a
[41:30] place maybe on the side somewhere the
[41:33] BART tender polishing the bar or
[41:36] something said something like this say
[41:41] did you hear the
[41:42] rumor no I don't believe it did said the
[41:45] man he spoke to oh they say something
[41:48] about a Japanese Fleet being coming this
[41:51] way and then someone else drops in on
[41:54] the
[41:55] conversation and a young silly girl
[41:58] bounces up there sticks her foot up on
[42:00] the bar and said you gloomy headed
[42:04] WS don't you know that we're here for
[42:07] have a good time and not talk about
[42:11] what that isn't just about the way the
[42:14] world is the same today about the coming
[42:17] of the
[42:19] Lord you oldfashioned fogy do
[42:24] numbers what makes you dress and act and
[42:28] do the way you do but we're looking for
[42:31] that secret sudden appearing of the
[42:36] Lord or there's something in the air a
[42:39] message of the holy spirit that tells us
[42:42] that coming is at
[42:44] handise
[42:46] God then when the big shind dick went on
[42:49] and oh it must have been a horrible
[42:52] thing that night for it said that
[42:55] sometimes during the night they took a
[42:59] young lady a beautiful built young girl
[43:02] and stripped her clothes from her and
[43:05] put her in a little wagon with just one
[43:07] underneath garment on and run her down
[43:10] the street and so forth just having a
[43:13] big time and all the time the Japanese
[43:17] was gaining grounds coming right
[43:21] on and then the next morning when the
[43:24] man on the post of Duty in the airplane
[43:27] signal watching and so forth had been
[43:30] out all night drunk and running around
[43:32] with these women and so forth was so
[43:35] drowsy and upset the next morning from
[43:38] the big party until they were caught
[43:41] asleep on the
[43:44] [Music]
[43:46] job and I'm afraid that it's going to be
[43:50] likewise at the coming of the
[43:52] Lord the church is so tuck up and
[43:56] drunken with the cares of the world tell
[43:59] they are going to be asleep at the post
[44:02] of Duty at the coming of the
[44:07] Lord and
[44:09] then over the city flew the planes and
[44:13] the bombs dropped and they just battered
[44:18] out that City to the ground why because
[44:23] they wouldn't take heed to the warranty
[44:29] and that young lady along with the rest
[44:32] of them one old Japanese brutal soldiers
[44:37] running there they ravished them in the
[44:39] street and cut them to pieces with
[44:41] knives afterwards and so
[44:43] forth for if you won't heed to warning
[44:47] there's only one thing left that's
[44:53] judgment oh if there ever was a
[44:58] time that this America was ever at its
[45:02] lowest end right now of its
[45:06] immorality of its
[45:09] indifference the gospel's been preached
[45:12] from Shore to
[45:13] Shore and signs and wonders has been
[45:18] performed and great Miracles has been
[45:21] done and they
[45:23] continually go on in their Ry
[45:28] drinking
[45:29] ignoring making
[45:33] fun out of the 200,000 pull pits in
[45:39] America of Protestant
[45:42] churches what we need today in those
[45:45] pull pits is prophets of the Lord who's
[45:49] not afraid to blast out God's
[45:52] Thunderbolts of judgment upon this
[45:55] generation of sinful people that we're
[45:59] preaching to amen we need prophets like
[46:04] Isaiah who cried out and said a wicked
[46:08] generation and how that he did condemn
[46:12] that
[46:13] generation and tell them of the oncoming
[46:18] judgments but the day too many of our
[46:21] ministers are afraid to say those things
[46:27] they are a scared to give a direct
[46:31] witness of
[46:32] warning for it would mean some of their
[46:35] jobs they'd have to lead their
[46:37] denomination lead their
[46:39] pulpits and they would have to to go out
[46:42] perhaps maybe take another stand at some
[46:45] other church or something but it's just
[46:48] too bad that we've got those kind of
[46:53] people in our pull pits we need man like
[46:57] John
[46:59] Wesley of the early Reformation Martin
[47:03] Luther we need people like Paul who's
[47:07] willing to give all and to surrender
[47:10] theirselves even if it means separation
[47:13] from this life as a witness of the true
[47:16] Gospel of Jesus Christ
[47:19] amen what it is today that education and
[47:23] societies and little frenal things of
[47:27] societies in their own feelings has
[47:30] stuck the place of the Holy Ghost in the
[47:33] church what we need today to cry out to
[47:37] America is God sent God filled man with
[47:43] the power of the Holy Ghost who's not
[47:46] afraid to cry out against the thing
[47:49] that's
[47:50] wrong and to warn the people of the
[47:53] oncoming judgment
[47:56] God could by no means ever let this
[47:59] nation Escape
[48:02] judgment if God would do so he would
[48:05] have to raise up Sodom and gomorra and
[48:07] apologize to them for ever sinking them
[48:12] when they was such an evil
[48:17] people we are no no exception in the
[48:20] sight of
[48:22] God what we have come today when it
[48:25] comes comes to our
[48:27] politics when it comes to our
[48:30] government it is rotten all the way from
[48:34] Pillar To
[48:36] Post there is no justice no more only in
[48:42] God oh we say we rely upon the
[48:47] UN the United Nations and better than 5
[48:52] years ago they were 51%
[48:56] communist other the nations in the
[49:01] UN there's nothing to rely upon but the
[49:04] word of the Living
[49:08] God we can't rely upon nothing not no
[49:14] politics I have been in trials for the
[49:17] last three or four
[49:19] months under heavy
[49:24] fire try trying to accuse me of doing
[49:28] something that was wrong by passing the
[49:30] money through this Tabernacle here for
[49:33] the
[49:35] meetings which our truste board here
[49:38] signed a declaration and there's not a
[49:41] person that's ever attended my meetings
[49:43] but what I publicly announced that this
[49:45] money was taken up in our and my
[49:48] meetings were directed to this
[49:51] church and now they say because I placed
[49:54] it to the church I was trying to defraud
[49:56] the government and want to give me 20
[49:59] years in Fort leworth Kansas
[50:03] fart I said what is that word wrote over
[50:07] on our courthouses Justice it means no
[50:12] more that it wasn't even wrote
[50:16] there so when everything that your own
[50:20] people told me to do I have did it and
[50:22] now you say that they're not with the
[50:24] government anymore
[50:26] how can you you'll setle one and prove
[50:29] it out that here they'll dig up
[50:30] something
[50:32] else not only
[50:34] that but they're
[50:37] wishy-washy oh amen I made this
[50:40] statement in the federal
[50:43] courts I said if
[50:46] Communism had Christianity in it I'd be
[50:51] a
[50:53] communist but I can't be
[50:56] because it denies Christianity so I have
[50:59] one hand to hold to that's God's
[51:02] unchanging hand
[51:04] knowing that he will respect truth and
[51:07] honor it'll have to come forth prise God
[51:11] and Justice amen but to let you know
[51:15] there is not hopes nowhere only in the
[51:18] coming of the Lord amen that's the
[51:22] truth oh it's such a day that we're
[51:27] such a an awful time when every physical
[51:31] thing even to the church itself the
[51:34] church peoples the church
[51:37] denominations they're so concerned about
[51:41] their little their little differences
[51:43] till they won't even Fellowship one with
[51:45] the
[51:47] other I'm not taking warning that the
[51:50] coming of the Lord is at
[51:53] hand man such as Billy grim and Jack
[51:57] Schuler or Roberts and many of the Great
[52:00] advances and Charles Fuller who has an
[52:03] Outreach to the whole
[52:07] world they do everything that they can
[52:10] to warn the coming of the
[52:15] Lord those on
[52:18] man those man who tried to do right is
[52:22] the man that our own government tries to
[52:25] tear to Pieces amen the
[52:29] true I said to
[52:32] someone Mister 28 years of my life I've
[52:37] laid on the altar of God to try to do
[52:41] right and I want someone to look at me
[52:44] in the eye and tell me if I ever beat
[52:47] anyone out of anything I ever stole
[52:50] anything in my life by the grace of God
[52:53] I'm clear amen that means to order that
[52:56] in must snap of your finger amen you're
[53:01] guilty anyhow and you're a dictator in
[53:03] your church you snap your finger and
[53:05] your church does what you tell him to
[53:10] do oh I said how unjust can man
[53:15] be he said you gave people
[53:18] gifts when their homes burnt here's your
[53:21] check where you give widows hundreds of
[53:26] dollars and paid their rent and done
[53:28] things like that said did you go to your
[53:30] church board and tell him you were going
[53:32] to do such I said no
[53:35] sir why didn't you I said the Lord told
[53:39] me in his
[53:40] word don't let your right your left hand
[53:44] know what your rights are
[53:47] doing he said then you're trying to
[53:49] plead Your Case by Bible and we're
[53:52] judging you by law I said which is the
[53:55] highest law man are
[53:58] God's I'll take God's
[54:03] law just a few two years ago I've been
[54:07] on my vacation was on my road bank here
[54:11] in Indiana the speed laws are 65 miles
[54:14] an hour in the daytime and that's on the
[54:17] free highways the
[54:18] freeways and it's 60 M an hour at night
[54:22] if the sun goes down that's in Kansas
[54:26] that's so in Illinois That's So in
[54:28] Colorado that's so in Idaho that's so in
[54:31] Wyoming and all wrote back after sitting
[54:34] in a snow drift for several days in a
[54:37] blizzard and I just gotten an elk and I
[54:39] was on my road
[54:41] home to give it to my
[54:44] friends and I had to hurry to try to
[54:47] beat another blizzard was just behind
[54:49] her I'd be set up again and the meat
[54:51] would ruin and I crossed out of Wyoming
[54:54] come over into to Nebraska I was about
[54:57] 30 Mi up inside the
[54:59] road and all of a sudden I look back and
[55:02] I seen the police's uh red
[55:05] light and I never was arrested in my
[55:08] life so I just went on I looked down I
[55:10] was doing 60 M an hour out on 30 or 40
[55:13] miles from a any any kind of a
[55:17] city and just going down the highway big
[55:21] four lane
[55:22] Highway and I noed 60 m I looked back
[55:25] and he continued to stay behind
[55:28] me and I just watched and I seen the red
[55:31] light flickering I thought well why
[55:33] don't he pass me he's got plenty of
[55:35] room and I kept waiting I run my window
[55:38] down and I heard a
[55:40] sirene well I thought I'm over as far as
[55:43] I can get and he pulled around and
[55:45] stopped
[55:46] me I got out of the car I thought maybe
[55:49] some message that I didn't pick up on
[55:52] the radio maybe at home my wife or
[55:54] family family I got out of that car just
[55:57] as innocent as I could
[55:59] be he said I guess you wonder why I stop
[56:02] you I said I do sir and he said you were
[56:06] breaking the speed
[56:07] laws said do you know how fast you were
[56:10] going I said yes sir I said I was going
[56:13] 60 M an hour he said that's right and
[56:17] that's against the
[56:18] law I said is it 65 and no sir said it's
[56:22] 55 here you were doing miles over the
[56:25] speed limit oh I said I'm so sorry I
[56:29] didn't mean said give me your driver's
[56:31] license just show me your license and I
[56:33] took them from my pocket and just as
[56:37] soon as he seen that word
[56:39] revered his eyes gleam with
[56:43] fire he grabbed out his book and started
[56:46] writing me a ticket for
[56:49] $224.50 I said are you going to give me
[56:52] a ticket said you're right I'm going to
[56:54] give you you a
[56:56] ticket well I said sir it's all right
[57:00] but I didn't see anything he said oh
[57:02] there's a sign right outside the state
[57:04] line you should have seen
[57:06] it I I said I've been sitting in a four
[57:09] snow drift for 4 days and I probably
[57:12] just never saw it sir and he said all
[57:14] right you got any cash on you I said
[57:17] just about
[57:18] $12 well I said you're going to stay
[57:21] right here until you pay it
[57:26] about 10:00 at night or
[57:28] 11: I said sir I told him all what was
[57:31] wrong the meat and so forth that didn't
[57:34] mean a thing to him so I had to sign a
[57:37] bonifide statement that I would send him
[57:39] the money when I got home I wrote the
[57:42] judge that of the little city that the
[57:45] Squire that I was ascended to and I told
[57:47] him I said sir I put 20 about 25 years
[57:52] at that time 26 years in the service of
[57:56] the Lord trying to convert criminals to
[58:01] the Lord Jesus to try to protect your
[58:04] life as an officer to try to make better
[58:08] communities and a better place to live
[58:11] and decency for our families I put 20
[58:17] something years in that service and I
[58:20] just crossed over your line I feel that
[58:23] you should forgive me
[58:26] F I said but your officer would not even
[58:29] considered it all which I maybe he's
[58:32] supposed to do that and carry out his
[58:34] duties but I'm asking you as a judge it
[58:38] isn't the money it's the principal my
[58:41] first spine to ever pay and this has to
[58:43] come out of money that people give me to
[58:46] live on through the church I said if
[58:49] you'll be so kind as to forgive me for
[58:52] it I'll appreciate it however here is
[58:54] the check that's been notorized that you
[58:57] might know that it's it's all right
[59:00] brother he just signed his name across
[59:02] and tuck it cold
[59:03] bloodly
[59:05] why
[59:06] why I'm done through rotten politics and
[59:11] religious
[59:13] Prejudice some of them get by with
[59:18] murder There It Is God won't let his
[59:21] church exist very long under such things
[59:24] amen and the world is
[59:31] corrupted and the politics is corrupted
[59:35] and the church is
[59:38] corrupted what we need to do more about
[59:41] it is God fearing people to get together
[59:45] and call on the name of the
[59:47] Lord Lord yesen that's what the brandom
[59:51] Tabernacle needs to do oh I would just
[59:55] looking and seeing I had lot ahead of in
[59:57] and thinking of how much we could
[1:00:00] stresser all the way that the churches
[1:00:04] are going how they let down upon the
[1:00:07] morals of the people how they let them
[1:00:10] live and go to dances and The Rock and
[1:00:15] rolls and dress any way they want to and
[1:00:18] everything and still go on just the same
[1:00:21] compromising
[1:00:23] preachers what we need his oldfashioned
[1:00:26] godsent Heaven Barn
[1:00:28] preachers who will tell the truth
[1:00:31] regardless who it
[1:00:32] hurts like John who said the ax is laid
[1:00:35] to the root of the tree and every tree
[1:00:38] that not bringeth forth good fruits is
[1:00:40] hewing down and cast Into the
[1:00:43] Fire we need preachers prophets like
[1:00:46] that who bombard and use the judgments
[1:00:50] of God for
[1:00:52] amination to tear up and this wicked
[1:00:55] condition that we're living in you can
[1:00:58] never rid sin by patting it on the
[1:01:02] back you can never rid sin by educating
[1:01:05] people our programs has become
[1:01:09] demolished and have
[1:01:12] failed there's only one remedy for sin
[1:01:15] and that is Christ is that remedy and
[1:01:19] not Christ through intellectual
[1:01:21] confession but through the baptism of
[1:01:24] the Holy Ghost to a new life and a
[1:01:28] regeneration that's the only remedy for
[1:01:31] sin only remedy for our nation it's only
[1:01:34] remedy for our church it's only remedy
[1:01:35] for the
[1:01:38] people here's sometime AG go I guess
[1:01:42] many of you people who travel has been
[1:01:44] there I've stayed all night there many

[1:02:48] suffering for the cause of Christ to
[1:02:51] pass legitimate money through a church
[1:02:53] and morning give him 20
[1:02:56] years in federal

[1:05:15] rotten our country is our nation is our
[1:05:18] people our prayer changes
[1:05:22] things but we're not in Ed in prayer
[1:05:24] meeting no more we got so many other
[1:05:27] things we have to do so we
[1:05:32] think and then not only that was that
[1:05:36] race Court condemned but it also was
[1:05:39] draw up that they could not have in the
[1:05:43] state of Arkansas nothing like that
[1:05:46] anymore for years and years to
[1:05:48] come why because of people that are
[1:05:52] called by his name assemble themselves
[1:05:55] together and
[1:05:58] pray oh what we need today is a calling
[1:06:02] together of getting ready I'm not
[1:06:06] depending on the preacher but you as an
[1:06:10] individual before God make yourself
[1:06:13] ready for the coming of the Lord to
[1:06:16] escape all this corruption amen no
[1:06:20] matter what they call you and what
[1:06:22] action they take that doesn't change God
[1:06:25] one B God will do it just the same he's
[1:06:28] depending and waiting on
[1:06:31] us oh my some people say well I go to
[1:06:36] church on Sunday morning I listen to our
[1:06:39] pastor which is a fine preacher that's
[1:06:41] good I appreciate that and
[1:06:45] you are the America the world whoever it
[1:06:48] is but it takes more than a good message
[1:06:51] from the pulpit it takes your
[1:06:55] life it takes you to get
[1:06:59] ready in Revelations the 19th Chapter
[1:07:02] and the seventh verse the Bible said
[1:07:05] that speaking of the bride of Christ she
[1:07:09] has made herself
[1:07:13] ready she made herself
[1:07:16] ready and you as a member of this bride
[1:07:21] you've got to make yourself ready
[1:07:26] some time ago a minister was preaching
[1:07:30] and and there was a man who had been
[1:07:32] tending his church for oh quite a
[1:07:35] lengthy time and he came that morning up
[1:07:37] to the Altar and he said pastor I now
[1:07:41] wish to give my testimony and my
[1:07:45] surrender to the Lord Jesus which I have
[1:07:48] done last
[1:07:50] night and the Pastor said well uh I am
[1:07:55] sure glad to hear about that John to
[1:07:59] know that you have decided to finally
[1:08:02] come and give yourself to the Lord
[1:08:04] because we don't want to hurt your
[1:08:06] feelings but we know that you have been
[1:08:08] very
[1:08:09] Wicked and we know you have mistreated
[1:08:12] your family you gambled away your money
[1:08:15] and you drank it up and live a horable
[1:08:18] life and your family went without and it
[1:08:21] gives my heart Joy this morning to know
[1:08:24] that you have come forward now and going
[1:08:27] to surrender yourself to the Lord Jesus
[1:08:30] to become a different person to serve
[1:08:33] him he said thank you Pastor he said
[1:08:37] then just what the I want to ask you
[1:08:41] something what sermon did I
[1:08:45] preach or what text that I
[1:08:51] use or what song was sung in in the
[1:08:54] church and the
[1:08:55] hymns that made you so decide to do
[1:08:59] this and as the man looked at him in the
[1:09:02] face with the tears running off his
[1:09:05] cheeks he said pastor it was none of
[1:09:08] your sermons though it's good as they
[1:09:10] were it was none of the choir singing or
[1:09:14] the specials though as good as they
[1:09:18] were he said then would you tell this
[1:09:20] congregation why you have made this
[1:09:22] decision he said I work with a man who
[1:09:26] is a Christian and I've said everything
[1:09:30] to him I've called him a Holy Roller
[1:09:34] I've called him a religious fanatic and
[1:09:36] everything and it does bother him a bit
[1:09:39] but he lives such a life till finally in
[1:09:43] my heart all long he has w a place that
[1:09:46] I want to be like that man and that's
[1:09:49] the reason I asked him to lead me to
[1:09:51] Christ I wanted the Christ that he
[1:09:55] serves you
[1:09:57] see God does work through the pastor to
[1:10:00] get his church ready he works through
[1:10:03] the songs to get his church ready and he
[1:10:06] works through
[1:10:07] you to get his church
[1:10:10] ready if your pastor would fail and
[1:10:13] continually to fail you'd hunt you
[1:10:16] another
[1:10:18] Pastor quickly you would do that if your
[1:10:21] choir didn't sing right are your soul
[1:10:23] wasn't right you would say to the
[1:10:25] director the one who has the music don't
[1:10:27] let them sing the more they just make me
[1:10:30] nervous to
[1:10:31] sing but what about you as an individual
[1:10:34] how do you fail in your daily living how
[1:10:37] do you tally up with God what God says
[1:10:40] for you to be a shining light that sits
[1:10:42] on a
[1:10:43] hill no one can pass that way around
[1:10:46] your way without knowing about Jesus
[1:10:49] what type of Life do you live one of
[1:10:51] those types of of mean and sing and
[1:10:55] aggravating and different are can you
[1:10:57] speak of the peace and the love that you
[1:11:00] have found in
[1:11:02] Christ she has made herself ready I
[1:11:07] showing you the wickedness in the time
[1:11:10] would not would fail me to Go Through
[1:11:12] the Ages and show that each time like in
[1:11:14] babbling on the night of the rting and
[1:11:16] dancing and drinking and so forth and
[1:11:19] what happened and down through the age
[1:11:21] has been that way and every age God had
[1:11:24] thunderbow
[1:11:26] prophets and signs and wonders to
[1:11:29] condemn the thing in the midst of all
[1:11:32] popularity and stand alone for God not
[1:11:36] only that but what if I would speak of
[1:11:38] the time of little Stevens not a
[1:11:41] prophet not a
[1:11:43] pastor just the member of the body of
[1:11:48] Christ how that this little fellow stood
[1:11:51] before the Sanhedrin Council that
[1:11:54] morning and spoke out to those who were
[1:11:57] condemning him and said you stiff necks
[1:12:02] uncircumcised in the heart and ears you
[1:12:05] do always resist the Holy Ghost as your
[1:12:08] fathers did so do you he wasn't a pastor
[1:12:13] you can't expect your pastor to do it
[1:12:15] all you can't expect your truste board
[1:12:17] to do it all or your Deacon board you've
[1:12:21] got to make yourself ready
[1:12:24] it's an individual Affair and remember
[1:12:27] His coming is so sudden that the church
[1:12:30] will go in the twinkling of an
[1:12:33] eye and if we see sin on every hand and
[1:12:37] judgment pending in the battleships of
[1:12:39] God's Wrath coming how we escape
[1:12:44] this signs are
[1:12:46] appearing Jesus is
[1:12:49] coming and great wonders are being done
[1:12:52] every mon Outpost is poting towards his
[1:12:56] soon appearing and it'll happen in a
[1:13:00] moment how are we standing this morning
[1:13:02] as we take
[1:13:04] inventory if we should be spoke to this
[1:13:07] morning and the Lord Jesus should
[1:13:09] descend from the heavens this morning
[1:13:12] with the shout and the Trump of God
[1:13:15] would we be found
[1:13:17] ready as a church body amen would we be
[1:13:20] found ready as an individual to jar with
[1:13:23] the those who are raised from the dead
[1:13:25] who have proven themselves ready no
[1:13:28] matter whether we are ready or not the
[1:13:30] Lord Jesus will come just the same at
[1:13:33] the appointed time we must be ready and
[1:13:37] we must do it
[1:13:39] now it is no time to
[1:13:43] wait we must redeem the time and be
[1:13:47] ready sometime ago a story just before
[1:13:51] closing that struck me as I heard it
[1:13:54] many many years
[1:13:57] ago this
[1:13:59] secret coming of the
[1:14:02] Lord sudden secret going of the
[1:14:07] church watch there'll be two in the
[1:14:09] field I'll take one and leave
[1:14:13] one there will be two in the
[1:14:16] bed I'll take one and leave one showing
[1:14:21] that the coming of the Lord will not be
[1:14:23] just at any certain corner but it'll be
[1:14:26] universal one will be in the field
[1:14:28] working daytime the other in the bed
[1:14:30] sleeping on the other side of the world
[1:14:33] it'll be a universal
[1:14:36] Rapture and it will come with the Shout
[1:14:39] with the voice of the Archangel and the
[1:14:42] Trump of God shall sound in the dead and
[1:14:44] Christ shall rise and she'll be called
[1:14:47] away
[1:14:49] secretly oh I love
[1:14:52] that the great bridegroom coming in the
[1:14:55] bride got herself ready waiting for that
[1:14:58] secret moment that she doesn't even know
[1:15:01] herself but she's ready and dressed and
[1:15:04] waiting for it we see signpost in the
[1:15:08] world that she's ready for judgment we
[1:15:10] see signs and wonders in the church
[1:15:12] great things taking place what kind of
[1:15:16] people should we

[1:18:38] raner and he owned a mammoth big
[1:18:42] Ranch way in the northern part of
[1:18:44] Colorado near the mountain
[1:18:48] section as you all know I done a little
[1:18:51] ranching in my life of riding and so
[1:18:54] forth one of my calls to God was sitting
[1:18:58] on a parable Texas wheel
[1:19:02] spers with a rifle L on the saddle and a
[1:19:05] pistol on my side but I heard down trees
[1:19:08] blowing sound like a boy said Adam where
[1:19:11] are
[1:19:12] you I looked up towards the stars and he
[1:19:16] old slim an old cowboy from Over Texas
[1:19:19] blowing through a comb with a piece of
[1:19:21] paper down at at the cross where my
[1:19:24] savior
[1:19:25] died it was down there for cleansing
[1:19:29] from sin I
[1:19:31] cried there to my heart was his blood
[1:19:35] applied glory to his name I pulled the
[1:19:39] blanket over my face and tried to hide
[1:19:41] myself because God was looking down in
[1:19:44] those
[1:19:45] Hills it's on one of those ranches where
[1:19:49] the great packing companies buy their
[1:19:51] cattle run them into the mountains and
[1:19:54] then bring them out at their caves or
[1:19:56] barn and in the fall of the year and
[1:19:57] brand them and sell off some of the old
[1:19:59] herd and the steers and so forth and go
[1:20:02] ahead into the accumulate their great
[1:20:06] herds of
[1:20:07] cattle and on this certain
[1:20:10] Ranch the owner are the
[1:20:13] caretaker what we call there the top the
[1:20:17] foreman he had about five daughters they
[1:20:21] were all beautiful women young
[1:20:26] Sangle and there was a little lady there
[1:20:30] which was a cousin to these girls that
[1:20:32] her father and mother had both
[1:20:35] deceased and she was brought over there
[1:20:38] to be a to live with her her
[1:20:41] uncle and those girls they wasn't those
[1:20:45] fancy type of frilly FRS you know and
[1:20:48] and um and they just Tu this poor little
[1:20:51] girl and they just treated her like she
[1:20:53] was some animal all the hard work poured
[1:20:57] right on her she washed the dishes she
[1:21:00] cleaned up she fixed the bunk she she
[1:21:02] had to do it all and they just stayed
[1:21:04] around with polished fingernails and
[1:21:07] manicure the stuff on their lips and all
[1:21:09] fixed up you know just prissy and
[1:21:12] especially did they do this when they
[1:21:15] heard that from
[1:21:17] Chicago the big Packing Company who own
[1:21:22] the out
[1:21:24] his young single son was coming to visit
[1:21:27] the
[1:21:28] ranch how did they Dyke out in good
[1:21:33] clothes and did they dress and make
[1:21:36] ready for his
[1:21:38] coming and each night the conversation
[1:21:41] would be they were going to B this young
[1:21:46] man and marry him who would then they
[1:21:49] would own the ranch themselves for the
[1:21:52] son would fall air to
[1:21:55] all so they made themselves
[1:21:58] ready so you see there is a ready to be
[1:22:01] made you make yourself ready by joining
[1:22:04] church or something that ain't all
[1:22:06] that's required you got to have oil in
[1:22:09] your
[1:22:11] lamp just you're dressing saying we'll
[1:22:14] build a big church we'll belong to a
[1:22:16] better denomination we'll we'll build
[1:22:18] the pipe oring to the Lord we'll make
[1:22:20] plush seats that is what God
[1:22:23] requires amen righteousness is what God
[1:22:27] requires in his son Christ
[1:22:30] Jesus that's the garments for the Bible
[1:22:34] said the white clothes which he is
[1:22:36] adorned in is the righteousness of the
[1:22:39] Saints
[1:22:41] amen so she these girls thought they
[1:22:43] would make themselves ready for the
[1:22:45] coming of this young man of course that
[1:22:48] poor little cousin that reminds me of an
[1:22:50] off cast somewhere you could appreciate
[1:22:53] her she was a beautiful woman but oh my
[1:22:58] she was a nice little girl but she was
[1:23:00] not even considered among them not as a
[1:23:03] relative now that's about the true
[1:23:05] picture of the real church today before
[1:23:08] the
[1:23:11] denominations not even
[1:23:14] considered a bunch of in denominational
[1:23:17] a bunch of
[1:23:19] outcast so the poor little fell went
[1:23:22] ahead working and when the young man
[1:23:25] arrived they didn't know it but he come
[1:23:29] looking for a
[1:23:31] wife he was sick and tired of the city
[1:23:35] girls who just stayed all doled up and
[1:23:39] oh you know hung around the barrooms and
[1:23:43] uh roll around in The Cadillacs and the
[1:23:46] different things they they were just
[1:23:47] sick and tired of it he thought i' go
[1:23:50] out west and Hunt me a a real girl
[1:23:52] that'll be a real mother to my babies
[1:23:55] and somebody who will not hang at all
[1:23:57] the sewing circles and the and the
[1:23:59] societies and things but it'll just be a
[1:24:01] real
[1:24:03] mother what did he find when he got
[1:24:05] there but the same
[1:24:08] thing that he had condemned in
[1:24:12] Chicago I wonder if the Lord Jesus will
[1:24:14] find a church just a
[1:24:16] denomination just by
[1:24:18] name a church no are in the Nam not
[1:24:23] ready to go oh they got fine FRS they
[1:24:26] got the biggest churches the biggest
[1:24:28] this and all these things but God don't
[1:24:32] want
[1:24:33] that he wants you as an individual they
[1:24:37] may have the best pastors they may have
[1:24:40] the finest Deacon
[1:24:41] board but he wants you with all
[1:24:45] L he's coming to C that alled bride
[1:24:50] away and as
[1:24:53] this boy looked up on him he was
[1:24:54] disheartened and that night they were
[1:24:57] having something on the order and then
[1:24:59] days it's been a long ago they called
[1:25:01] the Charleston which is just like a rock
[1:25:03] and roll and they were going to throw
[1:25:06] one of those big parties many of you
[1:25:07] people remember that old Charleston
[1:25:10] dance they did back when I was a kid
[1:25:12] when I was out
[1:25:13] there and so they were all had their
[1:25:16] little black and white clothes on you
[1:25:18] know to do the oh it was called
[1:25:20] Charleston's and black box that's what
[1:25:23] they were calling and they had them two
[1:25:25] tone clothes and they were going to do
[1:25:28] these dances and but this boy was sick
[1:25:31] of that
[1:25:33] stuff he was hunting for a real
[1:25:36] girl so he slipped out other party he's
[1:25:40] watching him he went in to look at him
[1:25:43] so is another son that I know
[1:25:46] of another son will come to your church
[1:25:49] he'll Son of God he'll come there he
[1:25:52] he'll look around he'll see you're fine
[1:25:53] dressed he'll he'll know that you're a
[1:25:55] good member but he's looking for
[1:25:58] something
[1:26:00] different from this IR regular trend of
[1:26:04] church so as he looked around after all
[1:26:07] he so discouraged he walked out the door
[1:26:09] and going back Walking In The Moonlight
[1:26:11] towards the bunk house he heard somebody
[1:26:15] calling huming and he looked around and
[1:26:17] here went this little girl with a great
[1:26:20] big pan of dish waterer way in the night
[1:26:23] barefooted that throw the dishwater out
[1:26:26] and as soon as he saw her something
[1:26:30] another said that's
[1:26:32] her that's the
[1:26:35] one so he put himself in a way and when
[1:26:38] she that's when she come back along the
[1:26:40] crow fence well E standing there and she
[1:26:43] almost
[1:26:46] fainted he said how do you

[1:28:15] week or
[1:28:16] two and he looked all around everywhere
[1:28:20] and he never said no more but he kept

[1:28:29] watched for her he couldn't fight her he
[1:28:30] know she' had to do the dishes and so
[1:28:32] forth so the dirty work and all could be
[1:28:35] thrown
[1:28:36] off that's the way the real Church of
[1:28:39] God has to take it sometime the Dirty
[1:28:42] Work all the Scandal names and all of
[1:28:46] the things that's mean to be thrown at
[1:28:50] it she's a Great Speckled

[1:29:37] feel the big man's
[1:29:40] son asking her now if she would be his
[1:29:47] wife just

[1:29:53] when they looked out the window and saw
[1:29:56] holding hands with that little despised
[1:30:01] cousin a man that they tried to back
[1:30:04] with all their big fine frocks and
[1:30:06] Frills and carrying
[1:30:09] on and he said will you marry
[1:30:13] me oh she said sir I'm not worthy that's
[1:30:18] the way the real Church feels about it
[1:30:20] am I'm not worthy I can if I can just
[1:30:24] wash your dishes it'll be all
[1:30:27] right are you willing to take that
[1:30:31] place could you wash the dishes from the
[1:30:35] supper would you be willing to be called
[1:30:38] fanatic or would you be willing to be

[1:31:02] circles and are you willing to take the
[1:31:05] way make yourself ready for the coming
[1:31:08] of the Lord if you have if you do you'll
[1:31:11] be waiting for him to come you'll Joy at
[1:31:15] his coming it won't be a Dreadful thing
[1:31:16] it'll be the most gracious moment that
[1:31:18] you can think of the coming of the Lord
[1:31:21] praise God all those that love his
[1:31:25] appearing so when he left he told her
[1:31:27] he'd be back at a certain
[1:31:29] time said when you begin to see there a
[1:31:32] winter said when you begin to see those
[1:31:35] trees begin to Bud
[1:31:37] y that mosquit and stuff begin to take
[1:31:40] on New Life said then I'll be back about
[1:31:45] Springtime I understand I couldn't say
[1:31:47] it was true but the girl only got about
[1:31:50] a175 cents a week for her
[1:31:54] labor but she saved every penny of
[1:31:59] it why she was getting ready for the

[1:32:21] was happy happy she didn't mind washing
[1:32:24] the dishes she didn't mind ironing the
[1:32:27] clothes or sweeping out the bunk house
[1:32:29] or what
[1:32:30] more she was
[1:32:33] engaged to the boss of the ranch why do
[1:32:37] we care what the world says a real

[1:33:59] finally when the hour come she begin to
[1:34:02] see this the buds begin to come on the
[1:34:05] trees she knew he'd be there at
[1:34:10] anytime and he said I'll try to make it
