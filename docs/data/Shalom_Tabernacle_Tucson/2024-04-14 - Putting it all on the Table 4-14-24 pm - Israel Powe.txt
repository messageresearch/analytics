talks about Lord you'll just bless us encourage us Lord to just not alone just help with the of testifying giving things to people overseas and giving them opportunities and or just sending the pastors here to help them as well Lord but also our our personal uh reasons Lord you put us on Earth to testify and in our everyday life Lord May those things we here tonight encourage us to do what you put us to do here as well Lord not just what's over in different countries and but also just put it in our heart to strengthen us to do these things Lord even if we get discouraged Lord even

Jesus tonight Lord Lord Jesus we appreciate everything you do for us Lord Jesus thank you Lord or we just ask these things humbly in the name of our Jesus Christ amen amen you can be seated if You' like I was just meditating on that song as brother Chris was singing this morning as the deer panth for the water and just thinking about that and it maybe maybe you don't understand what that means we take for granted and we sing the lyrics sometimes but just thinking about that the deer's not thirsty is why he's longing for the water it's not just Bo i' really like a drink but it's it's life or death to him when he's longing for that water he's been wounded by by something they're smelling that blood that's coming from him but he knows if he can get to that water that he can live and that needs to be our desire so when David is saying As the deer Longs for the water that's how I long for you oh God it's a matter of life or death I have to get to that water and so it's the same thing with us tonight it's not that we have to get to that water we have to get that water in US amen so let's just sing that chorus together I'm longing longing for Jesus Keep she I'm long in longing for Jesus I have a long in my heart for him just to be near him to feel his [Music] presence I have a longing in my heart for Him brother Miguel could you get ready while we sing it one more time yes I am

while we're all standing we'll go straight into the word tonight and read this scripture and then we'll uh touch on the missionary report and um and then uh we'll we'll tie in a little message uh Lord willing by the by the help of the Lord tonight that I hopefully will be a a help to you all so um Genesis the 22nd chapter if you'll turn in your Bibles Genesis the 22nd chapter while I'm thinking about it I want to make sure to extend my appreciation to brother Ezekiel and sister Lulu for the the uh young people's uh service the other night uh Friday night had the Bible study there at their home and just a wonderful time there with the young people and everyone who was able to to be there and uh also was thinking too um I think maybe Brother Scott and brother Brent worked uh worked real hard to get um to get a new camera up and running so if you look at the live stream you're going to see a lot better quality picture on the live stream just a wonderful job I was I was looking at it uh earlier today and very very nice job so we appreciate these things that that the Lord does for us Genesis 22nd chapter it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here am I and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Mariah offer him there for a burnt offering upon the mountains which I tell thee of can you imagine the Lord asking you to do something like that Saints and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and clav the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went under the place which God had told him then on the third day Abraham lift lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off and Abraham said unto his young men abide here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder in worship and come again to you amen and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son he took the fire in his hand and a knife and when they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said my father and he said here I am my son and he said behold the father fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for the burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they both went or so they went both of them together and they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of Heaven said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing that thou Hast not withheld thine son thine only son from me may God add His blessings to the reading of the word let's let's just bow our heads father we thank you for this word tonight Lord and Lord God we know that heavens and earth will pass away but this word will never pass away L we know it's an anchor that holds we know it's a tie poost and we know it's an absolute to the Bride of Jesus Christ tonight and Lord we ask that you would speak to us in the further part of this service and bless these few thoughts Lord I pray and Lord clear my mind oh oh God I pray that you would bind my lips before I speak anything unpleasing to you and we'll commit it into your hands now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you may be seated and I'll just put a little title on this tonight of putting it all on the table putting it all on the table and if you want to turn over to the slideshow we'll we'll take a a look at this uh tonight and so uh as many of you um know that we were recently over Easter weekend from the uh flew down on March the 28th and was there uh with the Saints in Jamaica uh until April the 2nd when we come back and so um you know it's it's kind of a a strange thing um that I I had on my heart I I was I felt in my spirit and I was praying about uh I felt like we should have some sort of a missionary Outreach as a church uh I believe that churches should pursue a missionary Outreach and do y'all believe that tonight Saints and and so I was praying about that and and no sooner it was literally within a week of praying about those things that brother Israel took the trip to Warz uh Mexico and it had quite an impact on him as I'm sure it has us all uh and and kind of um uh you know it lit a fire there and so immediately after that um this uh this uh brother uh Jonathan Miller who was the pastor there in um in the the church in Jamaica keep in mind this is the oldest Message Church in Jamaica it's been there since 1963 and somewhere along the line brother uh Israel met him you met him in Florida didn't you brother Israel and uh and and had been acquainted with him from that time and he was asking brother Israel to to come down and of course he was Easter time brother Israel wasn't able to make it and it worked out to where I could go and so uh you know I I think it's just um a good lesson for all of us that um you know many times if there's something you feel and you feel like the church needs to do something or you feel like that we as a Believer a body of Believers need to do something really complaining about it doesn't do anything but praying about it does and so I think if we would pray more earnest ly that God will lead the church uh I believe that God will lead the church don't you I I'll I'll tell you this I I come here because uh I can sit down on Sunday morning and relax and know that I'm going to hear the word of God come across this pulpit and uh there's and I have absolute confidence in that and you know what a blessing that is to have that kind of confidence that that you're going to come to church and be able to Feast on the things of God and and so you know is there things that we could always do better every one of us have things that we could do better and those are things that to me we need to commit to the Lord and pray through and so this was an opportunity and and it was a a real blessing to be able to go and so uh it was over the Easter weekend and uh let me get to the second slide here if you want to go ahead and and turn it down here this was entering into Jamaica and you can see that beautiful water as I it was that was taken out out of the plane as we were coming into Jamaica and I think many times when you talk about Jamaica that's the Jamaica that people have in mind that's what they think about is the is the beautiful beach and some beautiful water at a resort somewhere but that's uh that's a lie that's not Jamaica and uh that's that's tourist Jamaica so if you fly right into Montego Bay or you fly right into Kingston uh and you can go right from there to a resort you'll probably see some beautiful water like that and has some sandy beaches and have all kinds of amenities but that's not what the people in Jamaica are dealing with on a day in and day out basis as a matter of fact it's it's it's it's hot it's just it's real hot and uh and it's real humid which we don't know nothing about in Phoenix or in Tucson but but I I I remember it well from being back east and so uh when we landed there uh in Jamaica I started I beat it up like a teag glass and uh I stayed beat it up until I left Jamaica it was hot it was humid there were uh mosquitoes Galore everywhere and so it was it was really rough and uh and there's no in in the places where we went there's no air conditioning or or uh you know not even hot water which which if you're in that kind of heat and humidity taking a cold shower is not the worst thing in the world I can assure you but uh these are people that are very very poor uh and the things that we take for granted um you know it's it's amazing uh how soft we get as a people and uh but these these folks don't have hardly anything and so entering into Jamaica you can see on the next slide uh the traffic is is terrible in the in the island and so Jamaica we flew into to Montego Bay and the church was only about 11 miles away from Montego Bay uh but it took over an hour to get there that 11 miles drive because of the immense traffic and because of the conditions of the roads and and you can see how narrow this road is uh and you can see that they're driving on the wrong side of the stupid thing and and that the and that the steering wheels on the wrong side of the car and and so it was just a kind of a it was kind of a strange sensation to be driving on the wrong side of the road but uh potholes you can kind of see the condition of the asalt there and and and what you know that the roads are in disrepair and there and that's one of the better roads there uh and it go and we so we go up into the mountains past Montego Bay and it's again very very poor there's about three million people on the island and uh the Island's roughly about the size of Connecticut so but with much of the Island being uninhabitable the the people are very concentrated and so uh we were uh you know it was very very uh uh driving was very difficult and to to further multiply the problems the people in Jamaica drive like wild people and uh and they're very easygo very laidback but when they get behind the wheel something happens to them and and they they just drive like crazy and and uh people uh you they drive through the parking lots they fly through the parking lots and and people just weave in and out of the traffic and and people are walking and they're just you know we're missing them by inches and by centimeters I mean we were just almost hitting uh everybody we went by and so it was kind of a nerve-wracking I I told my wife if you ever go to Jamaica I'll just have to blindfold you and then take it off when we get wherever we're going and so and all of the crazy driving and people jumping in and out of the roads and people on bicycles and motorcycles and people walking in the middle of the street and just all of that I never saw one accident I never saw one wreck uh everybody got where they were going don't ask me how and so uh that's just kind of kind of a little bit so entering into Jamaica this was uh the next slide is a this was uh we the the church only had metal folding chairs you know the old metal folding chairs that's what they had to sit on and so uh and they just had a few of them and so we had to actually rent some chairs for the meetings and and what we rented was plastic lawn chairs and so we went to a person's home in a wealthier area there uh and we rented those plastic uh lawn chairs so the people would have a place to set for the meetings and so these meetings were three four hours long and the people were on metal folding chairs and plastic lawn chair lawn chairs and nobody complained everybody was just as happy happy and I you know I it kind of condemned me that we sat in a a padded Pew with a with a air conditioner on and and and can't hardly grunt out an amen and these folks were just happy to be worshiping the Lord and it's 110 degrees in there and 200 people shoved in a room half this size with no air conditioning and a metal roof and so and they just worshiped the Lord and so what a lesson it was to me and so uh you know the the economics are kind of um kind of different there one US dollar equals $49 Jamaican dollars so that's the that's the uh The Exchange on that and so a bucket of chicken there at KFC was $5,300 if you could find a KFC and there was one in town in Kingsport right out I mean in uh Montego Bay right outside of the airport and so uh a $5,300 bucket of chicken so um uh and then uh when we took up the offering and I'm and I'm so happy to say that we that the night we took up the missionary offering we took up over $1,200 to carry down to help this church and that's I was so proud to present that to those folks and and somebody uh there was a check in there for $240 and so I I deposited that check into my account and then when I got to Jamaica I went to an ATM machine to withdraw that $240 to give to them well I withdrew it in Jamaican funds and it was $36,000 that I pulled out of the ATM machine so uh that was how much $240 was in Jamaican currency and so you know there's just some different things about the culture uh one of the things that struck me was uh that the the Jamaicans you know the Montego Bay is the is the birthplace or where Bob Marley come from and and that's s got some Reggae uh background there of course but the and so I expected that however I didn't expect that the Jamaican culture they love old country music and so I'm not talking about the church folks I'm talking about when we're driving through town and there was bars and you know dance places and it's just it's rough but but they they got all that stuff you know and they would be blasting old Merl hagard kind of country music and I thought how in the world did that get down here and and so come to find out the very first radio station that would ever was in Jamaica was in 1950 and it played old country music and so the first radio station that they ever had played a bunch of old country music and so they got to listening to old country music and it stuck and so uh when I got in brother Miller's van and he was carrying me uh back to uh to the church area there to his home um the he had he was playing some gospel music and it was uh um oh she lived over there bias Brandy Loretta Lynn it was Loretta Lynn old Loretta Lynn singing gospel music and so I just thought that was kind of kind of funny that that that had kind of stuck in there so but this was just some pictures that I took that was close to the man's house you can see how beautiful the water and the and you know it's right close to the ocean and and uh and and so it's it's got a beauty to it it's very rugged uh next side shows a a Fruit Stand and there was all kinds of stands like this and you can see when I say a stand it's just sticks throw up and a a piece of canvas or tarp thrown over it and brother Miller would not allow me to pass this stand without getting me a coconut and so they they they bought me a coconut with a straw there to have and I didn't tell him but I I can't stand coconut but you know I uh I I took it and liked it you know so amen so that was but uh but but there was a lot of stands like this around it seemed like everybody was trying to do anything they could to make a few dollars like uh a lot of just and I don't think there's any regulation on it so they were just in odd places there would just be a stand up there that that somebody was selling something and all of these uh fruits and things uh none of that's imported of course it's all grown there on the island a lot of it's just out in the open wild it's not uh not necessarily a mango Orchard or whatnot it's just uh there'll just be mango trees here and there scattered throughout and so and the fruit was very very good so uh but uh the the next slide they don't have water in Jamaica they got water and uh so I thought I thought that was funny but they uh they speak English sort of and everybody there speaks English but it's got that Jamaican accent and and so people ask do they really say Yaman after everything and they say Yaman after everything so y was the the the preachers when they preach say Yaman and the the people when you talk to them say Yaman and I come back singing Yaman so you can't it it's really it's really catchy but they do have a a Jamaican Creo that that is like that is a language there and so it's kind of a mix of that and English uh but there was no I didn't have to preach with a translator I guess all that old old country music that they was listening to Growing Up helped them they understood me fine so um they didn't have a problem at all sound like they thought it was Merle Haggard I guess and so but uh but yeah it was uh it was interesting trying to they you know they talk fast and I I couldn't understand an H hes are pronounced a you know like a Amma he was asking for Amma he kept brother George passed me to Amma and I said I don't have a clue what you're talking about and he finally pointed out he was asking for a hammer so uh uh but but we got through it all just fine so um so the next slide shows every year they ask me if I wanted a bun and cheese a bun and cheese and so it's a Jamaican Tradition at Easter that everybody gets a bun and cheese and so that bun is actually like a loaf of some kind of spiced bread it's almost like a cinnamon raisin bread but with no raisins and then they slice that and they and they uh eat it with cheese now that says cheese but it's some kind of proc processed can of cheese something like a velita and so everybody everywhere at Easter time in Jamaica has a bun and cheese and so they sent me back home with a bun and cheese and uh so if you want to try it I got some at the house um so the next slide I just kind of got into this is kind of a different way of life and you'll notice like very poor so that's a tile shower but they didn't have money for a a a shower faucet so that's literally just a CPVC cut off glued in there and it only need one cuz they don't have any hot water so it's just cold water running and this is a video here this young man's not a Believer uh he just lives there in the community but I wanted you to watch what this young man's doing that's 10 tons of gravel right there and so just go ahead and play that video and so those bags he's filling them up and you can see got them all filled there and they uh they can't get the they can't get they couldn't get the truck any higher up on the side of the mountain so they just had to dump it there so this young man sat out there they just dumped it on Thursday when I got there and this young man sat out there and by the time I left on money see that the top of that mountain there behind that house is where he packed every one of those bags on his shoulder and uh that that kid probably weighs 115 PBS and was bagging up those rocks and packing it to the very top of that mountain so it's just a little different than what we're used to and um and so uh it it struck me by the you know 10 tons of it or so and by the end of the weekend or when I got ready to leave he had he had uh he moved every bit of that gravel up to the top of that mountain on his back so uh the next slide shows uh go ahead and hit it again the next slide there's trees this is in the community and there's just various fruit trees everywhere through so you had a that was of course a coconut and a banana tree and then right in front of brother Miller's house was an avocado tree which I didn't even know avocado grew on trees and uh there was uh mangoes of course and some other fruits that I wasn't familiar with uh and you know we noticed that if if somebody had in the in the county there if they had a cow they don't have a pasture for it or whatever it just be tied to a rope and they tie the rope to a tree and then every day they'd move the move the Rope somewh where else to let the cow graze and there was also many times on the island in town and in out in the country and everywhere there was a lot of goats running wild and uh and chickens running wild and I thought well I asked brother Miller I said who's uh who's goats are those are they just wild goats he's like no that's somebody's goats he said they'll just go home at night and I said well I mean what keeps somebody from getting them he said if you get caught stealing a goat on Jamaica they'll kill you and and uh and he said and the uh and the police won't say anything about it cuz you stole the goat so uh apparently it's a big offense to steal a goat in Jamaica and so because of that you don't have to worry too much about stealing goats uh they'll they leave them alone so next slide uh shows uh just a little bit about the church and the surrounding area so you can see this is the church uh and brother Chuck we're going to get into some pictures here that Health that a that a building inspector probably doesn't need to see so uh you can just close your eyes as we go through this so uh but the church again it's been there since 1963 when when brother Brown they first heard the message it's the oldest Message Church in Jamaica you can see it's just a it's just a block and concrete building with a with a metal roof and the metal roof you can see there by that picture is just in disrepair and uh very very bad and I'll I'll show you some more pictures uh later on but but basically this roof has already caved in once and they've pushed it back up and scabbed uh some some some splices on the uh on the trusses there to hold it up but it's just hanging up there by a thread so hit the video there and this just kind of will pan around and show you the the community and the and the area that we were at so basically what happened here was uh you can you can go ahead and play it there uh basically what happened was the the original pastor of this church bought this parcel of land and he built the church there and then he gave uh he gave access to all of the Believers that was at the church that they could just come and build on the church's land and so the little Community or there there there's the church right there on the on the right hand side that's the back side of the church and so all of these houses were originally church members uh and they just came in and they built so many of the people that live right around the Church go to that church uh but what's happened is as we've seen in the message here uh that some of the some of the grand you know sons and the daughters and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren they they fell away and they don't serve the Lord and so you've got kind of a mixture there of Believers and and then family but not family that comes to church anymore and so that was kind of the dynamic that we that we dealt with there and so um just go to that next next slide there it shows the front of the church if you want to uh if you want to take a look at the cry room that cry room in that church would be a bench right on the other side of that porch wall there and and so you know don't complain about our cry room um and um so the next picture shows kind of the inside of the of the church here and um let me get to the right picture right frame here um and so uh you can see that's a nice floor they they uh brother Miller had been had come a couple times to the states to a convention in the in I think it was South Carolina where they have a a convention that basically it's where uh you know ministers from the states and and missionary minded ministers they meet and and people that need help come and they try to meet there and and um they you know try to help churches where they can well brother Miller had been a couple of times and had never gotten any assistance and so he went back and told the church you know what whatever we're going to do to this church we're gonna have to figure out a way to do it ourself and I like that you know you want to you want people that can try that's trying to help theirself and so you can see they they installed this floor uh and and if you'll notice this is very very poor they don't have much but what they do have is immaculately clean you could eat off of that floor and they kept it that way throughout the whole meetings and brother Miller's house he was very very poor and didn't have much but what he had sister Patricia's wife kept it immaculately clean and so uh you know you don't have to have a whole lot of wealth to take care of something and so uh they I believe I heard that brother brandham said anything that has any material value to it at all is worth taking care of and so I certainly believe that to be the truth is there a video on that I can't remember um no video okay go to the next slide there so uh go ahead and hit that I think this might be a video so before the service starts you can hear this music about an hour before service they go down and they turn this music on and just play it there's the inside of the church that was after we got some plastic chairs in there and uh and that's kind of what we were what we were dealing with to worship and when they turned that music on in that little community in that in that block building with that metal roof it just blasts for miles across the and so it's kind of like a church bell to tell everybody church is coming and I and and uh and Jamaicans are on a different time service started at 10: and everybody got to there at 10:30 or 11 and um so they're worse than they're worse than Shalom Tabernacle ain't they and and so they got there about they got there about an hour late and so uh so you can just kind of see what we're what we're dealing with there and um but it's it's it's just an interesting kind of dynamic uh the next slide will show you this stuff that we take for granted this is a truck full of water now the there is Municipal Water going up into the mountain but the line going up into the mountain is is very very small and um because it's so small and provides water to too many homes you there's no water pressure at all so what everybody has to do is put a giant sistern on top of their roof and they had to get a pump and they they pump it all the time and hopefully they get the sister filled up enough to keep up with you know the demand for water but there's just it's just not enough to supply everything so what they have to do on something like this where we're going to have special services and there's going to be a couple hundred people there using the water they'll never be able to supply enough so they have to truck in some water and fill the sistern up so I think that's a little video there you can you can play that and uh but that's that's kind of the situation that they're in that's just things that we take for granted that you can see the black tanks on top of everybody's home that's a that's a water tank and that's a that is an non oia approved ladder made out of a couple of pieces of bamboo there and uh and then you'll see I'll pan it over and show this is a sister that's what it looks like right there every home has got at least one of those on there you wouldn't have any water so uh so that's kind of the way they they uh they do that and uh so the next slide I'll show you uh when I so we had Friday we had five Services We Had a Good Friday service on Friday night and then Saturday we worked on the church uh as soon as as soon as I gave them that love offering that you all provided they immediately went to work trying to repair and do things to the church so in this particular uh instance here he's standing on top of a couple of drums there brother Chuck that is not OSHA approved and um and he's wiring in some new lights that they bought with the money that we took to them because there was no lights in this what they want to make this is a Sunday school slf Fellowship room on the side of the church and so they don't have a place where they can have Sunday school right now but that's what they want to turn this into and you can see that to run those wires they had to uh they had to Jackhammer up the wall there to run the wire through that concrete block and and then that brother on that uh on that rickety ladder and the other brothers on that homemade scaffold there and they're trying to run those wires those Brothers worked on that church from the time I got there until the time I left they never stopped working on that church uh on that church and so the brother in red there's the pastor that's brother Jonathan Miller and that's his son-in-law up on the scaffold uh uh there he's a young evangelist brother and then this other brother here is a deacon there at the church uh that's on the ladder there and and uh and so really really fine bunch of brothers so looking at some of the needs of the church on the next slide there you can see uh in this top Corner this was a fan that was in the pastor's study and uh you can see that the bracket is broke and it's hanging by the actual wires uh that that keep the fan going and I was just praying the whole time lord don't let those wires snap while I'm here uh because that fan was all it was keeping me alive in that Pastor study back there and so uh uh uh but it that's that's just what they're forced to deal with on this bottom right hand corner you can see where the roof has caved in snapped those trusses and uh they pushed it back up and they scabbed a couple of tubby on each side to to hold the roof in place temporarily there and that's what they're that's what they're dealing with now those joist uh those trusses are probably over 8 foot apart and uh which is nowhere near what it needs to be and like a good strong wind or a storm would would take that roof off um um and so the next slide kind of shows the this is the you know the just rebar and and and lines and stuff shoved through the wall there and and just things that are in disrepair about the church and those were the kind of things that they immediately started working on trying to get fixed when we showed up and so uh the next slide shows that's that room I was talking about here that they built on there obviously there's no windows there's no doors uh but they purchased those while we were there to try to get that up and running and then uh they would also use that like I said for Sunday school for fellowship and for overflow if they had a house full um and you can see that the the the concrete floors are very rough and so that's why the ceramic tile because uh it just would be too much work to try to get the floor smooth enough uh to put down anything else so basically the best thing they can do is put some put that uh put mortar down and and and put do the ceramic tile and uh I think it's you know it's it's you can tell in the church it's just like whatever they had so this and this color this and that color this and that color this and that color they're just doing the best they can so that sink there is in the is in the restroom and you can see that that's just that's not a faucet it's just a a PEC cut off that they put in the sink there just to to cut off it's just very very po go ahead and hit the um hit the video and you can see I'll just kind of pan it around so that you can see the the repairs that are needed in the church there uh and so there's brother there's brother Miller there in the blue shirt the pastor worked hard the whole time I was there this is that roof uh so you can hear the saws going and stuff in the background they were working the whole time I was there trying to get the church going that down rod on that ceiling fan brother Chuck's a 2x4 scabbed on the trusses that's about to fall in and so uh uh that's just uh that's where they're that's what they're and you know did it stop them from worshiping the Lord not at all um so the next slide shows a sister that lives next door to the church and she has been going to church for many many years but she's had a leg amputated she's been been sick or had sickness and had a leg amputated and the sister can't get out of her house and she can't go to church because that's that's the we'll go back that's the uh that's the house so that ladder is the only way in and out of her house it's on the side of a mountain and so she wants to go to church uh but she can't get out I mean you know she can't get out there and so uh but that's the home that she lives in and that's kind of the shape that she's in I walked up to pray for her on Sunday night uh after one of the services I I walked up to pray for her uh and I had prayer with her there and then uh somehow or another them brothers got her into that church on uh Monday morning we had service is on Monday there so uh but she was able to get there so just looking at some of the people uh this little girl here this is uh this is Izzy and Izzy uh is uh brother Miller's granddaughter her parents are in the states and they come over to the states and their visa expired so they can't get back if they get back they'll never get back and so they're trying to get their paperwork in order but this little girl hasn't seen her parents in over a year so she's living down there with them you can play the video and see this uh she's a doll and uh what you doing girl what you doing tell them what your name is tell them what your name is he yeah yeah tell everybody hi hi I'm GNA send this back I'm gonna send this back to the States yeah so Izzy hadn't seen too many white guys and uh and was absolutely fascinated and kept asking me over and over why was I red and uh I said girl I'm hot and I go on you know and uh and so she was just fascinated uh she was just fascinated with me every mole every Freckle everything on me she kept picking out and uh she was just a a real sweet little girl I really enjoyed her being there and uh uh and so you know what kids is just kids wherever they are so the next picture will show you this uh brother in The Pink Suit right here looking fine is uh that's brother Mike and brother Mike's a 6 foot6 Beast of a man that's the Deacon there at this church and brother Mike stood at the back door and I complimented him because brother Brown said uh you remember when that he talked about that guy getting shot out of the pulpit that Pastor getting shot out of his Pulpit he said if you had a couple of good deacons back there he said they'd have had that gun out of his hand before he ever got in there and uh I'll tell you having a big old man like that in the back door just makes you feel better and uh uh because it is a rough area and they know I am from the states and that you know they they would assume that I've got money and so I never felt in danger there uh because the church folks took such good care of and stayed stayed right with me and uh but you know that stuff is out there and that's a reality so uh but just a fine man there that's brother Miller on the left and this is a little shop remember I told you everybody's just trying to do anything they can to make make ends meat to try to get you know generate some revenue and he had a open room in the bottom of his house and he just put a little store in there and he's got fabric softener and soft drinks and and uh you know crackers and bread and a few little odds and end things there in that little store and and people would just walk up to the house and and he'd run down and unlock and sell them you know just little little things here and there and so uh but that's just uh just kind of what he's trying to do to to to make it by there so the next uh slide this was just go ahead and play the video there this was a bunch of kids they were all fascinated with me and uh it just shows you if you so show a kid a camera Watch What Happens so here they come yeah oh yeah I'm G to send this back to the States yeah so uh th all those kids were so sweet and when I would get done preaching at night uh they would come up to the platform and every one of them would give me a hug and uh before I left the platform and I don't know what that was they wasn't hugging anybody else uh and uh the they com they commented that the kids was that they really loved me and and so I really loved them of course but uh it was almost like they just wanted you to bless them and so you know the kids would come up give me a hug and I would just have a little prayer with them and and they would leave and they did it every night that I was there at every service so uh and so this is a little picture of choir practice I just wanted you guys to I think you'll enjoy this you can hear them go ahead play [Music] Israel I think this is a song you like that they ended up singing this [Music] [Music] High all [Music] [Music] so you just can feel the worship in their singing and uh this was a thong I I think this might have been a Third Exodus Assembly song uh and it was uh it's a the the tagline of that song is the third pool Ministry and so this picture on the right hand side somebody at the church painted this church ages uh on the back wall of the church there and again they don't they don't have anything but what they got they try to make it as nice as they possibly can and and so just some real talent there in the church uh and so I was just videoing those sisters as they were uh as they were you know getting their choir practice there and they ended up singing that in the in the service so uh now getting into the services here uh uh there it's on there's a couple of services on YouTube if you want to if you want to look at them uh they they put all of them out there brother Miller uh does them on Facebook live but it's just filmed with like a iPhone and it's the quality is very very poor it's hard to make out anything really uh but there are two Services uh that's at this YouTube this spoken word Apostolic Tabernacle which uh when you do the acronym is SWAT so it's like a SWAT team if you want to but SPO spoken word Apostolic Tabernacle and that is brother Keith Reed's church and so many of you may have heard of brother Keith uh but he's from down in Kingsport Jamaica and his church came up for the services the last two Services they came up and they they filmed it and it's really good quality you got a nice camera and so if you go to spoken word Apostolic Tabernacle uh Inc on YouTube you can see those two services from Monday and it's uh it's wor it's a blessing to hear the music and the worship and and uh so if you wanted to check that out you you you would certainly be uh you certainly be welcome to do that um so this video just go ahead and play this is this some worship [Music] there's my Deacon brother in the middle of the door big guy back there [Music] [Music] so you know a couple of things here with this uh and y'all y'all may not be ready for the next video but once they got it cranked up but I was in the office at a pastor's study with the door shut and my Apple watch went off and told me that it was over 95 DB um and that I might be suffering with hearing loss and that was in the pastor study with a door shut so when you open the door and walk out I I cannot describe to you how loud it was and uh I loved it and so um it was quite it was quite a blessing now you know into the services and sa I I hesitate to even share some of this but I I I mean this is what happened so to the best of my knowledge but there was many miracles that happened while we were there in the services and I will say this for the glory of God that this is nothing to do with me this you could be the worst preacher in the world and preach in an atmosphere like this and uh and and God just does things when people have expectations and when people are when people Worship the Lord and when people have faith to just simple Faith just to Simply tell them what the word is and they just believe it and accept it God does things Saints and so as I go through some of these things I I I I don't I really don't want I don't really want to but I want you to know the things that the Lord did and uh but it has nothing to do with me I'm a man and and so um they didn't happen because of me they happened because of the people and there was such a faith and such a anointing there in those services and you know it's just uh it's just a was just a real blessing to be a part of and so um so the church is is it been there since 1963 so most of the area has heard about the message and uh many of the people have fell away over the last four or five years they've just stopped coming they they live right there in the community they live next to the church and they've just stopped coming and um so the church needed a restoration um and just a Revival so to speak and so I mean we've seen that Saint you've seen people that just you know over the last five years they've just stopped you know they they went along good maybe they went along good their whole life but all of a sudden they just stopped and and and and so that's what this church was dealing with and brother Miller was very you know disturbed by that you know he's like brother George he was my Deacon he just quit coming to church one day and then this brother over here and this sister here and this sister over here and this sister over here they just they just stopped coming and um you know those things are spirits Saints and so uh but we had many people came back to church that had fallen away and U and so I I know uh it was it was either six or eight people brother Miller was telling me about that had hadn't been to church in years and they came back to church during these services and and and and renewed their their vow to the Lord and so we saw people come in on crutches and walk out carrying them we saw people in wheelchairs that walked out pushing them and um and and and we saw one night in particular we had a a prayer line for the people and I asked brother Miller to lead the line and brother Miller told me that the Lord told him uh not to do it but to have me do it he said because the Lord told him you know these people but he doesn't and so there were people that came through the prayer line that uh that brother Miller told me that in my prayer I was praying things that the thing it was a fast line it wasn't asking for prayer they were were just laying hands on them and praying and they said those prayers were exactly what was going on in the people's life now I say that that's not nothing to do with me I don't know those people but it was an anointing on those services and so uh one sister in particular that I had prayed for and he said when I prayed I told her that uh she was nervous and she would the devil was trying to tell her she was going to lose her mind and he said she' had a nervous breakdown two years ago and that the devil had been just tormenting her about that since and so then another sister came up and I told her she was uh uh praying for her family and he said her husband had quit coming and and and she and she the next service she was there and her husband was with her and so and he called me yesterday and told me that many other things like that had happened where were people that were prayed for and had been healed and restored there was one brother that came in that limped in uh and we prayed for him and he ran out and um and so you know and just a just a a lot of things like that happened and then the other thing was that uh the brothers that came in from other churches there's eight message churches in Jamaica and seven of those eight had people there at these services so it was a wonderful Unity uh that that they all turned up all but one Church turned up had people there and they just were fellowshipping together and so when you have expectation and visitors and fellowship you know how it is Saints you got special meetings going on it was just a really special time and so the the brothers were saying uh many of the brothers from the churches said that that that what they heard and keep in mind we we had Friday service and we had two services on Sunday and we had two services on Monday and because Monday they call it they call it Easter Monday in Jamaica it's a holiday also should be a holiday here shouldn't it and um and so everybody turned up on Monday and many of the brothers said that the things that their pastors were preaching on Sunday they heard reiterated on Monday and so they felt good that it was in the same line of CH thought and the same channel y'all know how Lord does that where where you've been listening to a tape and you come in and you hear it preached on the same thing or or you or you or you heard something preached on and then the next tape you listen to brother Brown's talking about it and or you you know been talking with somebody in your family about something you come to church and the things preached all over that's that's what we like is when when uh when when God does things like that and so we just saw so much of that that I I don't have time to go into it uh one of the things that was really striking to me is it was a sister there that had a the a powerful voice it was like she was like it was like a it was like an artha Franklin kind of voice it was just this powerful powerful voice and she sang on Sunday morning very anointed and really blessed the service and and um so that Monday I was hoping that she would sing again and so I was waiting for to sing waiting for to sing waiting for to sing and it was the last service on Monday night and she hadn't sang and so as soon as I got up to the platform I said I wonder if we could take time for one more special and I asked that sister sister can you sing for us again and she did and the Holy Spirit fell in the service just so beautiful because she was so uh had such a powerful voice and brother Miller told me after the service he said brother George I was heading down here to ask her to sing he said the Lord told me don't ask her he said if the L he said he said if the Lord wants her to sing the Lord will make a way for her to sing and he said then the first thing you said when you got up in the Pulpit was can you come sing sister and so just a lot of things where you could find that the Lord was working on all ends at the same time and so it was really a blessing so let's play this next video here uh they cranked it up a little bit there and uh [Music] all right so uh so just the the you can listen to those full services like I said on YouTube if you'd like to we'll also post some pictures sister Aaron said she can put them up on the The Church website so uh I'll have some more pictures and so forth for you there so uh then the next slide there is uh oh yeah that's that's a little action shot there and uh so that's kind of the end of that slideshow uh and I would just say this and and I we don't have time to preach tonight this it's too it's too long at this point but I I would just say this I read that scripture there uh uh about Abraham and and and and Isaac and and I would just say this saints that there there is a law to things and um there is a law of of sewing and reaping and and it's not I mean it's not it's it's a law of God and and even secular businesses understand this law even secular businesses understand that for some reason or another when they give money away they get money more money back it's a it's a law and and and we understand that better than anybody as as Christians and um and so in this instance here you know you think well uh many times we kind of focus on our s and we focus on our needs and we focus on what we're looking for and and and even we focus on uh uh uh what our church needs what this church what inside these four walls need but but the Bible said blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy and so if you want Mercy yourself you have to first be merciful and so I I just feel like Saints in this shape right here these These are laws brother Israel preached on the tithing not just money but time right you're know you you know do we tithe our time and and those type things and and and Saints I would just feel like that if you want a strong church then help somebody else have a strong church and God will make your church strong and and and I feel like if we want a church building and we need a church building here Saints and I feel like if we want a church building Let's help somebody else with their building and I believe God will provide us a building yall believe that that's how God works Saints and and and we noticed here with Abraham that that Abraham he didn't have to give his son Isaac but he had to be willing to give his son Isaac he had to be willing to do it it was his he had to be willing to give what he had to do to to and and because and and the Lord told him because you have done this because you haven't withheld your son I know you fear me and then the next verse I didn't read it tonight but he said because of that I'm going to bless you amen and your seed after you and you know we find many times in the scripture it's like that little woman that that only had she had this much meal and she had this much oil and and she was going to make that for her and her son and she was going to die and and and but that Prophet come through the land and he said bring me something to drink and bring me a little cake and she said I ain't got but just this much meal and I'm going to die he said but make me a cake first is that right and and and you know what if she hadn't made him a cake she'd have starved to death but because she gave her all to God and because she put God first that barrel of meal never went empty and it never went dry and God don't have no financial problems amen and you know so many times we focus on oursel and what it opened my eyes to is to stop focusing on myself and focus on others that's Christianity isn't it amen and so um you know I I I I want to read this this one quote to you here and then and then I'll go ahead and close um me find it here brother Bram said and be certain of God 5978 he said seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all other things will be added unto you he said put God first put his word first put his Spirit first put him first he said but instead of that we put him last and on this scripture he said he talked about that little woman he said bring me a little cake first he said what's she going to do see if she's obedient to the word he said bring me a little cake first now to be obedient to the word there's a quote in end time evangelism uh that brother brandham says you are always in the will of God doing missionary work now now how many things can you say that you're always in the will of God doing so we talk about these things Saints this is something we don't have to second guess we know that this is the will of God Amen and he says this he says see if she's obedient to the word she turns and starts not knowing what she's doing men and women who are led by the spirit of God sometimes do things that they don't know they're doing have you seen that he said she turned and started to the house and then she heard that voice again that glorious word come from his mouth thus saith the Lord and she knew who it was then she said the barrel will not go uh he said the barrel will not be empty neither shall the Cru run die until the day the Lord God sends Raina on the earth why she was willing she put God first she was sure that God would do something she held on brother brandom said amen so Saints we just got to put it all on the table and we can't have parts of our life that we're not willing to put on the table and and you know many times when you see that we struggle we struggle in places if we struggle as a church or we struggle as an individual when you many times I've set in counsel with people and and it's so glaringly obvious the thing that that's causing them trouble maybe it's a job but but they're just not willing to put that job on the table but it's a it's a matter of priority that that that if a job's keeping you out of the house of the Lord get a new job is that right get a new job but but that's got you got to be able to put it all on the table or maybe you got a hobby that's that's causing you problems that's dragging you down some kind of way but you're not willing to put that put that hobby on the table or or or you know you got maybe it's your cell phone you're not willing to put put down it's causing your problem but you're not willing to put that thing on on the table or or or there's any number of things that causes problems and we got to be willing to put it all on the table and you say well brother George you got to get rid of all those things I'm not saying you do you just got to be willing to if God wants you to amen amen so I I'll close with that Saints I I uh I took too long on that but I I really feel like uh the the trip was a real eyeopener for me and I feel like anything we can do to help those
