[1:08] on the fifth
[1:16] seal verse number nine and when he had
[1:19] opened the fifth seal I saw under the
[1:22] altar The Souls of them that were slain
[1:24] for the word of God and for the
[1:27] testimony which they held and they cried
[1:30] with a loud voice saying how Longo Lord
[1:33] holy and true does thou not judge and
[1:36] avenge our blood on them that dwell on
[1:39] the earth and white robes were given
[1:42] unto every one of them and it was said
[1:44] unto them that they should rest yet for
[1:46] a little season until the fellow
[1:49] servants also and their Brethren that
[1:51] should be killed as there they were
[1:54] should be fulfilled amen let's sing only
[1:58] believe
[1:59] [Music]
[2:04] only
[2:07] believe
[2:09] only
[2:12] believe that all things are
[2:18] possible
[2:19] only
[2:23] Bel
[2:24] only
[2:26] [Music]
[2:27] be all
[2:30] [Music]
[2:33] believe all things are
[2:38] possible
[2:40] only
[2:42] be bless you may be seated brother
[2:47] Brandon now we see that the Devils
[2:50] changing
[2:51] four um four Beast meant what power they
[2:57] was revealed uh to the what power how he
[3:00] revealed to the world and how they ended
[3:04] on his pale death horse now let's look
[3:07] at God's powers of this Beast to combat
[3:12] them the first Beast of God that he went
[3:16] out to meet the Antichrist with the
[3:18] Antichrist Spirit when it's said it's
[3:20] just his teaching now remember when the
[3:22] Antichrist first road he was in a
[3:26] Teaching Ministry
[3:34] the Antichrist rolled first in a
[3:37] Teaching Ministry and what's the one
[3:40] that went to Mee him the
[3:43] line the line of the tribe of Judah
[3:46] which is the
[3:48] word when his false teaching went forth
[3:52] the true word went to Mee
[3:54] himl that's the reason we had an irus
[3:56] and a polyart and and and and and uh
[4:00] those fellas of St Martin when that
[4:03] Antichrist was riding with his false
[4:05] teaching God sent his teaching out the
[4:09] word the line of the tribe of Judah
[4:12] which is the word made manifest in the
[4:15] Holy Spirit Hallelujah and the Holy
[4:17] Spirit there to manifest himself which
[4:20] is the word that's the reason the early
[4:22] church had healings and miracles and
[4:25] visions and
[4:27] power is because it was The Living Word
[4:31] in the farm of the line of the tribe of
[4:33] Judah right now to combat that amen now
[4:37] you got it he sends his power Antichrist
[4:41] God sends his the word Antichrist false
[4:44] teaching the true teaching went with it
[4:47] to combat it that was the first now this
[4:52] was the first church
[4:54] Apostolic that went to me him now the
[4:57] second beast that the Antichrist out was
[5:01] a red Beast which was to he wrote on was
[5:05] to take a pieace and from the earth and
[5:08] and War now the second one that went to
[5:12] comb him was the ox
[5:16] Beast the ox means a labor a beast of
[5:21] burden and um now if we could just stop
[5:25] this let me get let me so you be sure to
[5:27] see this that that's kind of might be a
[5:28] little puzzling to you well let's get
[5:30] thyo here watch and see if it isn't a a
[5:33] a laboring church you see and to the
[5:36] angel of the Church of
[5:38] thara write these things sayth the Son
[5:42] of God
[5:44] who his eyes are like the flames of fire
[5:48] and his feet are like fine brass I Know
[5:51] Thy
[5:53] Works see becoming all works now see
[5:56] because that's the the one was riding
[5:58] with and charity and service see it's
[6:02] all just and faith and patience and thy
[6:08] works again twice thy works and the last
[6:13] to be more than the first see that shows
[6:16] that the thyra age after the Antichrist
[6:20] got settle down and come into the thyra
[6:23] age the little church could do nothing
[6:27] but just just simply lay
[6:30] and another thing the ox is also is a
[6:35] beast of
[6:38] sacrifice see they give their lives just
[6:41] as freely as they could give them in the
[6:43] Dark Ages a thousand years there the
[6:46] Catholicism controled the world and they
[6:49] just went right in yes or no they didn't
[6:52] mind
[6:53] dying if it was death that's all right
[6:56] amen they wouldn't died anyhow why the
[6:59] very Spirit of the
[7:03] age that's the reason I'm that's the
[7:05] reason irus that's the reason poar John
[7:10] Paul those great mighty
[7:15] men out there combating that
[7:19] thing Paul saw it he said I know that
[7:23] after my departing if wolves are going
[7:25] to enter in among you Brethren teaching
[7:28] perverse things
[7:30] and'll draw you away look at that Stern
[7:33] little old Apostle standing there his
[7:36] BackBeat full of
[7:37] Stripes his eyes
[7:40] watering but he could see farther than
[7:43] the that scope playing it out down Earth
[7:45] they see 120 million light here's a
[7:47] light space he can see Plumb into
[7:51] eternity there he
[7:53] was and he predicted it and said that's
[7:56] what would take place and said also went
[7:58] on down to the other age to
[8:01] come I notice there he was along after
[8:04] him St John lived the longest and when
[8:07] St John was trying to take all the
[8:09] sacred Epistles Anointed with the Holy
[8:11] Ghost and put them together to make the
[8:13] Bible the Roman Empire CAU him and put
[8:16] him on the aisle of patmas he was out
[8:17] there on the aisle of patmas for the
[8:19] word of God sake polart was helping him
[8:23] translate I read the other day the
[8:25] letter that Mary herself wrote to poar
[8:29] and abiding not arring him but
[8:31] commanding him for being a gallant man
[8:35] that who could teach and accept the
[8:37] teaching of Jesus Christ the who was
[8:40] borned of her from God Mary's own note
[8:45] that she had wrote to
[8:47] pcarp pcarp was fed to the lines you
[8:50] know no he burned it it's too late for
[8:52] aernal line loose in the arena and so
[8:55] they tore down a bathroom and old Bath
[8:57] House IR put him in a in an arena Ena
[9:00] and and burning and on his road coming
[9:02] down he's walking with his head down the
[9:05] Roman Centurion said you're an old man
[9:08] and well respected why don't you
[9:09] denounce that thing he just kept looking
[9:11] towards heaven and a Bo spoke from
[9:14] somewhere they couldn't understand word
[9:16] said poar don't fear I'm with
[9:19] you hallu why he was standing by that
[9:24] word and when they begin to pile the
[9:26] boards on him to burning him there's a
[9:28] heavenly music come down and and the
[9:31] anthems from some Angelic somewhere sang
[9:34] the song he never even one time batted
[9:36] an eye to the
[9:39] father that's Gall
[9:41] man that's man who can stand a Martyrs
[9:45] down Through the Ages there suffered
[9:49] terribly what was the they were under
[9:51] the inspiration the spirit of God the
[9:56] power Hallelujah I don't forget this
[9:58] church and you brother on tape I want
[10:01] you to examine
[10:04] this how could man do anything else
[10:07] besides the power of God that have been
[10:09] released to
[10:11] them I'm going to set this box up here
[10:14] to represent
[10:16] that if God sends a certain Spirit among
[10:19] them that's the only thing that they can
[10:22] work by is the spirit that works among
[10:25] them now we'll prove to you by the
[10:27] history of the church and by the the
[10:31] opening of the seals and the powers that
[10:33] let loose and watch exactly the church
[10:36] responded to the the anointing and they
[10:38] couldn't do nothing else that's
[10:41] right now the first of that line that
[10:44] word that pure unadulterated word the
[10:47] second and thara was the ox and it was a
[10:52] a big burden uh Beast of Burden pardon
[10:56] me and it was also a sacrificial
[11:00] beast and wasn't that exactly the poor
[11:02] little Church of Rome had settled down
[11:05] there to A Thousand Years of Dark Ages
[11:08] and anything that didn't profess to be
[11:10] of the Roman Church was put to death
[11:12] immediately and they had to labor going
[11:15] from place to place you
[11:17] Masons I call your attention you
[11:20] remember the sign of the
[11:23] cross ah you know what I'm talking about
[11:26] yes now notice
[11:29] now if you if you notice that was
[11:32] packing and preserving that
[11:35] Bible see and they had to labor among
[11:38] one another there you are the ox and
[11:42] when it come time we read it last night
[11:45] see when the thing went forth the
[11:48] sacrifice come and they had to go he
[11:50] said don't you hurt the wine and
[11:53] oil what did they do they willingly
[11:55] walked up there and died they didn't be
[11:58] care because the the spirit of the
[12:00] church and that they were
[12:03] sacrifice labor and they walked up this
[12:06] say freely as they could walk Anointed
[12:08] with the true spirit of God of that
[12:11] age and died like Heroes as sacrifice
[12:14] thousands times thousands 68 million of
[12:19] them on the record Ox sacrifice oh my do
[12:25] you understand it okay all right
[12:29] now sacrifice it only could labor in
[12:34] that age to combat the great opposition
[12:38] for that 1,000 years now the third Beast
[12:42] that went out from the devil was this uh
[12:46] Black Horse see now the third Beast that
[12:50] went out power from God to combat
[12:53] him to combat the powers of the black
[12:56] horse was a man
[12:59] cunning smart with the wisdom of God you
[13:04] know a man is smarter than any of the
[13:07] Beast he's smarter caus he out witht him
[13:11] mostly he's cunning
[13:14] shrew see and the the age from the Dark
[13:18] Age now coming out from the Dark Age
[13:21] down this other side when this black
[13:22] horse is riding when they charge for
[13:25] their their sacrifices and everything
[13:27] they' done and money just so you know
[13:29] how it was now the next thing went out
[13:33] to combat that was the Beast with the
[13:36] face of a man smart educated
[13:40] shrewd fine anointed but that Spirit of
[13:45] that day you notice it now I went to
[13:49] comb him with a cunningness of God's
[13:52] wisdom with him that was the age of the
[13:57] Reformation Martin Luther John Wesley
[14:00] and so forth see it was a Reformation
[14:04] swinging and uh oh who all Knox Calvin
[14:08] and who all see went out it was a
[14:10] kindness and now you watch exactly from
[14:13] the Dark Age from the Reformation this
[14:16] way watch it was the shrewdness of man
[14:20] you drop your windows just a little bit
[14:22] I be people getting kind of little warm
[14:24] maybe in there if you just pull the
[14:25] windows down it's a little bit C it I
[14:27] know me you're preaching getting hot I
[14:29] you're bound to be out there
[14:31] notice it was the
[14:34] shrewdness of man now you understand
[14:37] that third
[14:39] Beast that Satan sent out he becomes
[14:43] shrew too watch Major wheat for a penny
[14:46] three majors of barley for a penny see
[14:49] oh my see the money-making scheme the
[14:53] shrewdness to get the gold of the world
[14:55] and the wealth to brought into it
[14:57] exactly fulfilled that's what begin to
[15:00] charge for prayers and for made a place
[15:02] called Purgatory play their ancestors
[15:04] out and or you had to will your deeds
[15:06] and everything your property the church
[15:09] was state was the same and the church
[15:11] taking your property over and um don't
[15:14] you see some of these evangelist this
[15:16] they still has that same anointing
[15:18] [Music]
[15:19] on that's right making old people give
[15:22] up their pensions and de their homes
[15:25] over to certain things W brother amen am
[15:30] true I don't want to get on that see but
[15:32] now I stay right with this I look back
[15:35] see where I'm going now notice that man
[15:38] that's up to them that's up to them I
[15:41] don't have one thing to do with me I'm
[15:42] just responsible for this year now
[15:45] notice the the Beast come to combat it
[15:49] now was man and we all know that this
[15:54] Beast of man this power of man in his
[15:58] inter uals recognize that that koser
[16:02] that Martin Luther had in his hand when
[16:05] he was climbing those steps it said this
[16:08] is the blood of Jesus Christ this is the
[16:12] body of Jesus Christ and Luther throw it
[16:15] down and said it's Bread and
[16:18] Wine it's not the body of Christ because
[16:21] it's been exalted in setting at the
[16:23] right hand of God making intercession
[16:26] see wisdom
[16:29] He
[16:30] Man and when John Wesley come along Ed
[16:34] just swingle had come in and Calvin and
[16:38] they got the church to a place on
[16:40] security till they didn't want more
[16:42] revivals whatever was going to be is
[16:43] going to be that was
[16:44] all and they just Liv any kind of lives
[16:48] the Lutheran church is so twisted and
[16:51] the angland church oh my the whole
[16:53] country become corrupt just like it is
[16:57] now the churches Twisted when uh King
[17:01] Henry the VII and come into England and
[17:04] after Bloody Mary and all these things
[17:07] taking place and then the church was so
[17:09] full of violence and Corruption man
[17:12] claiming Christianity and living with
[17:14] four or five wives or doing anything
[17:15] they wanted to do and carrying on and
[17:18] filth John Wesley studying the scripture
[17:21] and watch it it was reveal to him that
[17:23] the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies a
[17:27] Believer and you shouldn't then what did
[17:29] he do he come out in another Reformation
[17:32] he saved the world in his day like
[17:34] Luther did see what was it that man
[17:37] beast power going on give man wisdom of
[17:40] understanding that the thing is wrong
[17:42] that isn't the blood of Jesus Christ
[17:44] that isn't the the body of Jesus Christ
[17:46] that represents the
[17:48] body that's a still great fuss between
[17:51] Catholic and Protestant now it's the
[17:52] only thing you can't get together on
[17:53] right now everything else didn't get
[17:55] together on with that these counsil are
[17:59] having notice now but this but they
[18:02] couldn't get together on that see that
[18:05] one is the blood and says it's a literal
[18:09] blood that the priest has the power to
[18:12] change this bread to the literal Body of
[18:14] Christ that's what the little Tabernacle
[18:16] is in the the church you know that
[18:18] reason they make signs and any kind of
[18:21] pagan offer is they go by you know and
[18:23] bow theirself and Kip their hats and so
[18:25] forth that is not to the building it's
[18:28] to that c that's in the the
[18:30] Tabernacle and notice how Satan trly
[18:34] pull that but see at that time upon the
[18:38] man's being see God put a spirit of
[18:43] wisdom upon man to understand that's
[18:45] wrong now that was to combat the third
[18:49] Beast that had got the church so corrupt
[18:52] that he was riding that it was terrible
[18:54] the reformers uh uh what did they do
[18:57] then they in the Farmers age they
[19:00] brought the church from its pagan
[19:02] ceremonies of idolatry back to God again
[19:07] see that's what the Beast went for that
[19:08] kind man Rider to do it now but read now
[19:13] verse three and Revelations 3 and two
[19:16] just a minute I got it marked down here
[19:18] for some
[19:19] reason now this is comes in now the
[19:22] Lutheran age in the reformers age
[19:25] Revelations 3 and 2
[19:29] what they did they organized as soon as
[19:32] Luther got his church started on he
[19:34] organized it all right same thing Wesley
[19:37] did same thing Pentecost did exactly
[19:40] organize it and what do they do they
[19:42] take up the same system that they come
[19:45] out of see I watch this Revelation
[19:48] speaking of this Sardis Church to the
[19:49] angelist church is the first verse of
[19:51] course see Be watchful and strengthen
[19:55] the things which remain that is the word
[19:58] word that you've been
[19:59] taught see the things that remain that
[20:02] are ready to die he's right then ready
[20:06] to start back in an organization just
[20:08] like the Catholic Church you come out of
[20:10] see for I have not found thy works
[20:14] perfect before God there you
[20:17] go there's the there it goes right back
[20:20] again don't you see why organizational
[20:23] systems is
[20:26] wrong who started did God did the
[20:31] apostles the Roman Catholic Church did
[20:35] it now just let any historians say
[20:38] different it's not there they are they
[20:40] say they're the mother church and they
[20:42] are but they organize the thing and put
[20:45] a system with man's head to it we didn't
[20:49] take one man like they did we take a
[20:50] whole Council of man put them together
[20:53] then you really got a
[20:56] confusion that's right yeah how can a
[21:00] council anyhow it's just like we think
[21:03] democracy is right I believe it is too
[21:05] but it'll never work right you can't
[21:08] with a bunch of Ricky around here to run
[21:10] it how in the world you going to get it
[21:13] right
[21:15] can notice the real thing was a Godly
[21:20] King notice the
[21:22] Beast the third Beast now was a
[21:26] cunningness of a man he representing the
[21:29] reformers that went forth from the idol
[21:32] of taking say this is the bread this is
[21:34] the wine see the Antichrist is still got
[21:36] something symbolizes Christianity he's
[21:39] got to because he's against you see and
[21:41] then if he's got to be against something
[21:43] if he come all along say well I'm a
[21:44] Buddha well that has got nothing to all
[21:46] do that's just a heathen to begin with
[21:48] but the Antichrist is cunning he's got
[21:50] all kinds of things that represents
[21:52] Christianity want God to off on the
[21:54] other side something against the
[21:55] original doctrine of it see that's what
[21:57] may seem Antichrist see so the reformers
[22:00] when the Beast went forth in the form of
[22:03] a of a man to combat that I don't forget
[22:07] this class don't forget it see remember
[22:12] all the days of your life see these
[22:15] beasts are correct it's thus sayth the
[22:19] Lord notice idolatry brought the the man
[22:26] Beast went forth with the power of God
[22:30] by wisdom that God gave him and brought
[22:32] the church from idolatry back to God but
[22:36] in the we find out in that same church
[22:39] age when they started to denominate to
[22:42] do the same thing that they did in the
[22:44] beginning Rome did now she's going to
[22:48] make daughters to that church and what
[22:50] does she say said now that you're I
[22:53] haven't found you perfect and you got
[22:55] the strength in that little strength you
[22:56] got left now now listen to him warn him
[23:01] in Revelations again 3:3 that's get well
[23:04] I believe I got it just a few minutes
[23:05] ago remember from how thou H has
[23:11] received and heard and hold fast and
[23:14] repent just otherwise remember that you
[23:18] come out of such a corruption as that
[23:20] amen
[23:22] see and look here if therefore Thou
[23:26] shalt not watch I will come unto thee as
[23:30] a
[23:31] thief huh and thou shalt
[23:34] know and thou shal not know what hour I
[23:38] will cometh upon thee on down he's going
[23:40] to move the Candlestick see so that's it
[23:43] what is the light of the church and she
[23:44] went right into the same organizational
[23:47] system of pagan darkness that she come
[23:48] out of and there she remains
[23:52] today well honest hearted people
[23:54] thinking that that's the truth just the
[23:56] same as Catholics are and the
[23:57] Protestants like the Catholic one that's
[23:59] a six of one a half a dozen the other
[24:01] exactly according to the Lord man's with
[24:03] you

[1:07:26] and take a wife unto my son Isaac and
[1:07:30] the servant said unto him pre-venture
[1:07:33] the woman will not be willing to follow
[1:07:35] me unto this land must I need bring thy
[1:07:39] son again unto the land from when thou
[1:07:42] camest and Abraham said unto him
[1:07:45] beware thou that thou bring not my son
[1:07:48] there there again the Lord God Of Heaven
[1:07:51] which took me from my father's house and
[1:07:53] from the land of my kindred which spake
[1:07:56] unto me and that swear unto me saying
[1:07:59] unto thy seed will I give this land he
[1:08:01] shall send his Angel before thee and
[1:08:04] thou shalt take a wife unto my son from
[1:08:08] then amen Luke chapter 14
[1:08:27] in verse
[1:08:45] 16 and then he said unto him a certain
[1:08:48] man made a great supper and bade many
[1:08:51] and he sent his servant at supper time
[1:08:55] to say to them that were bidden come for
[1:08:58] all things are now ready and they all
[1:09:00] with one consent be to make excuse the
[1:09:04] first one said unto him I have brought a
[1:09:06] piece of ground and I must need go see
[1:09:09] it I pray thee have me excuse another
[1:09:12] one said I've brought five Yol of oxen
[1:09:14] and I go to prove them I pray thee have
[1:09:17] me excused another said I have married a
[1:09:20] wife therefore I cannot come so that
[1:09:22] servant came showed his Lord the things
[1:09:26] then the master of the house being angry
[1:09:29] said to his servant go out quickly into
[1:09:32] the streets and the lanes of the city
[1:09:36] and bring in hither the poor the MIM and
[1:09:39] the Halt and the Blind and that servant
[1:09:42] said Lord it is done as thou has
[1:09:45] commanded yet there is room the Lord
[1:09:47] said unto the servant go out into the
[1:09:51] highways and hedges and compel them to
[1:09:54] come and that my house may be filled for
[1:09:58] I say unto you that none of those men
[1:10:00] which were bidden shall taste of my
[1:10:02] supper let us pray Lord Jesus we ask
[1:10:05] your blessings upon your
[1:10:08] word blessings upon your people we pray
[1:10:12] we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you
[1:10:16] may be seated we're going to take just
[1:10:19] for a moment uh this morning to speak of
[1:10:22] the subject or the title is Lord I'm at
[1:10:26] your
[1:10:27] service Lord I'm at your
[1:10:30] service and we're speaking of this model
[1:10:33] servant
[1:10:36] eleazer the model servant brother random
[1:10:38] calls him the model servant of the Bible
[1:10:42] Lord I'm at your
[1:10:44] service and this is really what the Lord
[1:10:47] wants to hear from all of us today is
[1:10:51] Lord I'm at your service you know a
[1:10:54] servant
[1:10:56] a faithful servant
[1:10:59] is um very hard to
[1:11:03] find very hard to find a faithful
[1:11:07] servant you can find a lot of people
[1:11:09] that are willing to go but they'll have
[1:11:11] an agenda behind it and they'll be a
[1:11:15] part of something and they'll attachs to
[1:11:18] something but many times these people
[1:11:22] are looking at what they can get out of
[1:11:24] it how do I enrich myself how do I EMB
[1:11:28] better myself but a faithful servant has
[1:11:34] instructions to follow the one who is
[1:11:37] sending him I like how Jesus says it in
[1:11:39] St John Chapter 13 we usually read it
[1:11:43] during our communion service let's take
[1:11:44] it there
[1:11:46] quickly that he that is
[1:11:49] sent the servant is not greater than his
[1:11:53] Lord can we turn there quickly we got
[1:11:55] time St John Chapter
[1:12:00] 13 and verse number 13 you call me
[1:12:06] master and Lord you say well for so I am
[1:12:09] if I then your Lord and Master have
[1:12:11] washed your feet you also ought to wash
[1:12:13] one another's feet for I've given you an
[1:12:16] example that you should do as I've done
[1:12:19] to you so he gave us an example to
[1:12:22] follow him verily verily I say unto you
[1:12:24] the servant is not greater than his Lord
[1:12:28] neither he that is sent greater than he
[1:12:31] that sent him so this sending the
[1:12:36] servant has to be sent and every one of
[1:12:40] us have been sent with a commission and
[1:12:44] that mission is much bigger than us you
[1:12:48] know we get embarrassed at what we
[1:12:51] believe many times because we're we're
[1:12:54] too focused on our ourselves and I think
[1:12:56] that's part of the problem is that we're
[1:12:59] embarrassed on how it's going to make us
[1:13:01] look but it's not about us he sent us to
[1:13:06] represent something so much bigger than
[1:13:09] us we're just simply
[1:13:11] Messengers we're placed here for a
[1:13:13] purpose we have a motive we have a goal
[1:13:17] that he has for our lives and when we
[1:13:20] can keep that Focus zeroed in properly
[1:13:24] our praise our worship and everything
[1:13:25] we'll do will be healthy it'll be it'll
[1:13:29] be
[1:13:30] stabilized won't be no funny rubs or
[1:13:32] funny feelings I won't take it hard
[1:13:35] because you stepped on my toes I will
[1:13:37] I'm a human being but you know that's
[1:13:39] part of the deal part of the deal is
[1:13:41] that some folks will step on your toes
[1:13:45] they won't like you because they didn't
[1:13:47] like him they're going to reject you
[1:13:50] because they rejected him and that's
[1:13:52] part of the package that's the reality
[1:13:54] of of it you're called to this work as a
[1:13:59] servant we don't send
[1:14:02] ourselves we are sent by something
[1:14:05] greater than ourselves the one that
[1:14:07] sends us that's who we're responsible to
[1:14:12] and this um model servant of the Bible
[1:14:16] elzer will take him just for a moment uh
[1:14:19] for a subject this morning this is what
[1:14:22] came up on my heart yesterday and uh I
[1:14:25] trust we can deliver it to you this
[1:14:27] morning this um scripture that we read
[1:14:30] in Luke chapter 14 is a scripture that
[1:14:34] brother bandam uses when he preaches the
[1:14:36] message is your life worthy of the
[1:14:40] Gospel so here a great man is making a
[1:14:44] feast for his son a great wedding and
[1:14:47] then he bids people to come and with one
[1:14:51] cons one consent they begin to make
[1:14:54] excuses as to why they can't even come
[1:14:57] um this um is your life is worthy of the
[1:15:01] Gospel it highlights a number of things
[1:15:04] in that message um and maybe what I'll
[1:15:10] do is
[1:15:12] um before I go in there because I didn't
[1:15:15] give you these sis in the back but in
[1:15:18] the
[1:15:19] message
[1:15:22] um ashamed brother brandom is dealing
[1:15:26] with this eleazer and how the Lord
[1:15:29] revealed to him that he his message was
[1:15:33] a type of the elaser and so in the order
[1:15:37] of things in 1963 Christ is the mystery
[1:15:40] of God revealed brother vom releases the
[1:15:43] threefold mystery that God had hid in
[1:15:46] the back part of his mind and this
[1:15:50] mystery is the foundation of why we have
[1:15:54] to go through what we go through what
[1:15:56] we're doing what church is all about
[1:15:58] this is a Plan of Redemption you're
[1:16:01] included into it you're part of it and
[1:16:04] it it was hid in his mind and then he
[1:16:07] revealed It Through the Ages can I get a
[1:16:09] witness and so this is Christ's great
[1:16:14] mystery he Reveals His threefold purpose
[1:16:16] and then one year later in the message
[1:16:19] the
[1:16:19] Masterpiece he went to California to pay
[1:16:23] tribute to Amy simple mcferon a woman
[1:16:26] preacher and her life and while in there
[1:16:29] he went in Forest Lawn to see this great
[1:16:32] statue of Moses and that struck him and
[1:16:35] touched him and it brought forth this
[1:16:38] message the Masterpiece in the message
[1:16:40] the Masterpiece he that was July of 64
[1:16:44] he reveals that earlier in the year July
[1:16:48] the 3 he had a vision and this is the
[1:16:52] first time we see this vision of the
[1:16:54] Bride played it here many times it's
[1:16:56] about seven minutes eight minutes or so
[1:17:00] and I want to play that vision for you
[1:17:01] one more time this morning if we can get
[1:17:04] that ready sis um it's in the message to

[1:18:00] tell the vision I don't know what I can
[1:18:03] interpreted but I I'm going to tell the
[1:18:05] vision for my first time I fell into a
[1:18:08] trance and when I did there was somebody
[1:18:11] with me I didn't see the person it was
[1:18:13] just the
[1:18:15] voice and uh I looked and as I I looked

[1:18:25] I look coming to me and I seen the
[1:18:31] most the most prettiest bunch of clean

[1:18:41] different they all had long hair and
[1:18:44] they were longer sleeves and skirts and
[1:18:47] so forth young women it look kind of I'd

[1:19:24] a dozen or more just I don't know how
[1:19:26] many was a breast but there just a group

[1:19:44] notice Sam coming up and when they come
[1:19:46] up each one look like got worse I never
[1:19:50] seen such a filthy bunch in my life and
[1:19:53] when he said next I heard a noise and it
[1:19:56] said next said Here Comes the American
[1:19:59] group now I am an
[1:20:02] American but this this made me sick I am
[1:20:06] not uh eloquent enough to in a mixed
[1:20:11] audience to say what was taking place uh
[1:20:15] uh uh and you'll have to read between
[1:20:17] the
[1:20:18] lines but when the women were coming the
[1:20:21] leader of them was a
[1:20:23] witch she had a great long nose and a
[1:20:25] great big mouth and all of them was
[1:20:28] dressed with some kind of lower clothes
[1:20:30] down here but the top just had a strap
[1:20:33] that just a little about half inch strap
[1:20:35] that moved up and went around them like
[1:20:37] this and each woman had a something on
[1:20:39] an order many of you years ago used to
[1:20:42] remember when we used to cut that paper
[1:20:44] you know newspaper and make an old fly
[1:20:46] bush how many remembers you know well I
[1:20:48] think you Us in carnivals you know
[1:20:49] hanging down like a fringe paper lace
[1:20:51] paper they had something holding below
[1:20:54] them like
[1:20:55] this holding blow them all this part was
[1:20:58] exposed and each one had hair cut up
[1:21:01] real short and Fry looking things all
[1:21:04] over it like that real shortcut hair and
[1:21:06] full of
[1:21:07] makeup absolutely nothing but look like
[1:21:10] street
[1:21:12] prostitutes and they were walking with
[1:21:14] this paper and the
[1:21:17] vulgarity now the paper was what was ho
[1:21:19] in front of them but when they pass the
[1:21:22] review stand in the back of them
[1:21:25] and to see the way they were going
[1:21:28] on in their foremost in their back part
[1:21:31] and how they were acting I said is that
[1:21:34] the
[1:21:36] church and there she went and they were
[1:21:38] singing this year twisting Roll songs
[1:21:40] you know what you call going down sing
[1:21:43] going by I said is that the
[1:21:46] church and I was standing there and in
[1:21:48] my heart I was crying and this
[1:21:52] witch the my notion it's nothing else in
[1:21:55] the world but she's a she's that World
[1:21:58] Council of churches leading him right
[1:22:00] straight down the road where she was
[1:22:02] going they went off to the
[1:22:05] left and disappeared in
[1:22:08] chaos still beating this music and
[1:22:11] making real funny sounds and shaking
[1:22:14] their bodies one side and then the other
[1:22:16] side and then like that car like got
[1:22:19] walking and I just started to bow my
[1:22:21] head and he said wait the bride must
[1:22:24] come
[1:22:25] again and I look and here they come
[1:22:28] again and they passed by a sweet looking
[1:22:31] little ladies that's all looking around
[1:22:33] at me as say pass by I noticed each one
[1:22:35] was dressed different and one in the
[1:22:37] back had kind of long hair hanging down
[1:22:40] and had it rolled around like this might
[1:22:41] have been German or something like
[1:22:43] that and I watched him and then as he
[1:22:46] started leaving two or three of them in
[1:22:48] the back car to get out of step and I
[1:22:50] was going to holler at him and they
[1:22:51] trying to get back and step again and I
[1:22:53] seen him just the vision just fade out
[1:22:55] and change
[1:22:56] from now here is the interpretation
[1:23:02] thereof the reason I remember I had just
[1:23:06] got through writing I hadn't finished I
[1:23:08] hadn't wrote these notes yet but in
[1:23:11] preaching this morning I caught what it
[1:23:14] was right in my
[1:23:16] sermon did you notice the church only
[1:23:18] came in view now that's the truth
[1:23:20] friends the heavenly father who writes
[1:23:23] the word knows that I tell the
[1:23:26] truth I don't I just say the truth and
[1:23:29] not knowing it till just a few minutes
[1:23:31] ago look like or just recently see did
[1:23:35] you notice the Bride come in view
[1:23:38] twice the first seene the
[1:23:41] second both of them exactly the same one
[1:23:45] and the reason they were D dressed in
[1:23:47] different parts she'll come from All
[1:23:49] Nations it'll make up the
[1:23:52] bride each one had long hair and old
[1:23:54] makeup and real pretty girls and they
[1:23:56] were watching me that representing the
[1:23:58] bride coming out of all Nations see each
[1:24:01] one represent a nation as they March
[1:24:04] perfectly in line with the word see then
[1:24:07] I have to watch her she'll get out of
[1:24:08] Step of that word if I don't watch when
[1:24:10] she's passing by if she gets by maybe
[1:24:12] it'll be my time when I'm over see when
[1:24:15] I'm finished or whatever it is watch
[1:24:17] they was getting back trying their best
[1:24:19] getting back this getting line is
[1:24:20] looking out somewhere else watching
[1:24:22] about that church and just went out of
[1:24:24] and to chaos but two the front ones
[1:24:27] never the back ones just two or three of
[1:24:29] them was kind of stepped out a little
[1:24:31] bit to the right hand side it looked
[1:24:32] like was trying to get back in line as
[1:24:34] he went by as this passed me Old Forest
[1:24:36] here at the wall pass me I was standing
[1:24:38] there and then I just seen all move out
[1:24:40] and leave but you notice the church only
[1:24:44] came into to view once each Nation the
[1:24:47] church but the Bride come in twice see
[1:24:50] see what it was now I'm not aning but
[1:24:52] look at with my message this morning not
[1:24:54] knowing that
[1:25:00] see we can say praise the
[1:25:03] Lord how many can you really say praise
[1:25:05] the Lord the Lord now that was a vision
[1:25:08] concerning you and I that's a vision for
[1:25:11] the first time that was released to the
[1:25:14] people as brother brandham is relating
[1:25:17] that
[1:25:18] experience uh to the people about this
[1:25:21] vision of this bride coming forth
[1:25:25] twice and um that is pretty tremendous
[1:25:30] when you look at in throughout the
[1:25:32] message he
[1:25:33] only um identifies the Bride As the
[1:25:37] Alpha and Omega because of this Vision
[1:25:40] that he gave and he does that in the
[1:25:43] message the Masterpiece he says this
[1:25:45] here in paragraph 198 in the message the
[1:25:50] Masterpiece he says all others never
[1:25:53] appear
[1:25:54] no more they went out never to come back
[1:25:58] again but the bride came back cuz she
[1:26:01] was Alpha and
[1:26:04] Omega God the great sculpture had made
[1:26:07] him a masterpiece for it is a piece of
[1:26:10] his first masterpiece like he made in
[1:26:13] the Garden of Eden he took a piece from
[1:26:16] and made another piece and that was
[1:26:17] marred and Fa now he's been all this
[1:26:21] time building it up again and he brought
[1:26:24] forth this masterpiece and was smitten
[1:26:27] in order that part that was smitten was
[1:26:29] in order to bring back again that
[1:26:32] Masterpiece again so the Masterpiece and
[1:26:37] the Son of God the Masterpiece and the
[1:26:41] bride and it's a piece of himym which
[1:26:44] must be the fulfilling of the word the

[1:27:02] would be a piece of the word bone of my
[1:27:05] bone Flesh of My Flesh we are word from
[1:27:11] beginning to the end this is what we're
[1:27:13] becoming a part of the word that's the
[1:27:15] most important part of the service
[1:27:18] really is the sacred part is the
[1:27:21] preaching and the ministering of his
[1:27:23] word word becoming life upon your life

[1:27:51] Abraham's promises that God made to him
[1:27:54] that he'd have a son Isaac we hear more
[1:27:56] and more about Abraham and how God would
[1:28:00] bless his
[1:28:01] seed and and here Abraham is coming to
[1:28:04] the point of death the Lord is warning
[1:28:07] him of that and now he has to go find a
[1:28:10] bride for his son not ishmail but for
[1:28:14] his son Isaac the promised son so he's

[1:28:19] responsibility and lay it in the hands
[1:28:22] of a faithful servant so elzer you're
[1:28:25] going to be my eyes you're going to be
[1:28:28] my
[1:28:28] discernment you're going to be my heart
[1:28:32] you're G to go where I'm not going to go
[1:28:34] but I want you to swear to me that
[1:28:37] you'll call a bride from this area this
[1:28:41] location she's got to be related to me
[1:28:44] she got to be willing to go and she's
[1:28:46] got to have the character so this was
[1:28:47] the tremendous
[1:28:49] responsibility if you if you think of it
[1:28:52] this this young man
[1:28:54] um gentleman elaser of Damascus if you
[1:28:58] read another scripture um some say that
[1:29:01] he was acquired maybe as a servant in in
[1:29:04] Abraham's lifetime whatever it was um
[1:29:07] Abraham was considering that this would
[1:29:10] be the heir in his house he was thinking
[1:29:14] that this eleazer would fall air to him
[1:29:17] and the Lord revealed to him no it's not
[1:29:20] going to be elzer but I'm going to give
[1:29:21] you a son even in your old age so this
[1:29:24] is a very faithful man this eleazer of
[1:29:29] Damascus this was the very faithful
[1:29:31] individual that Abraham would think to
[1:29:35] entrust this great decision to and so we
[1:29:40] see him appear in Genesis chapter 24 now
[1:29:44] just take your Bibles real quick again
[1:29:46] and let's read verses 12- 15 as
[1:29:51] eleazer is now on his his journey to go
[1:29:55] pick a bride for Abraham it's almost
[1:29:59] easier to make a decision for yourself
[1:30:02] because if you mess up well it's my bad
[1:30:05] I'll eat the cost I'll take the hit but
[1:30:08] when but when you're going on in
[1:30:10] representation for somebody greater than
[1:30:13] you and you're spending their money and
[1:30:16] you're you're using their name and
[1:30:19] you're going in their under their um uh
[1:30:24] power then there's a little more stress
[1:30:27] because if you mess up everyone's going
[1:30:30] to know about it everyone's going to
[1:30:32] know that you missed the mark and so but
[1:30:35] eleazer I like what he does in verses
[1:30:38] number 12 he he said he begins to pray
[1:30:43] first he takes these 10 camels to a
[1:30:46] country he's never been
[1:30:48] before verse 11 and he made his camels
[1:30:50] to kneel down without the city by the
[1:30:53] will of water
[1:30:54] and at the time of evening even the time
[1:30:57] that women go out to draw water so he
[1:31:00] goes to a place where the women are
[1:31:02] going to be drawing water he knows the
[1:31:04] time that they're going to be coming he
[1:31:07] come from a long journey he's a stranger
[1:31:10] he places his camels all 10 of them down
[1:31:13] around the well and then he prays and he
[1:31:16] said oh Lord God of my master Abraham I
[1:31:21] pray thee send me good speed this this
[1:31:24] day show kindness unto my master Abraham
[1:31:29] behold I stand Here by The Well of water
[1:31:33] and the daughters of the men of the City
[1:31:35] come out to draw water and I don't know
[1:31:38] who any of these women are these are
[1:31:41] just women from the city I don't know
[1:31:43] their last name I don't know who is who
[1:31:45] or what is what I'm a blind man here but
[1:31:49] oh Lord show me Grace and show me mercy
[1:31:52] today and he let and let it come to pass
[1:31:55] that the damel to whom I shall say let
[1:31:58] down thy picture I pray thee that I may
[1:32:01] drink and she shall say drink and I will
[1:32:05] give thee thy camels drink also let the
[1:32:08] same be she that thou has appointed for
[1:32:12] thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I
[1:32:15] know that thou H has showed kindness
[1:32:18] unto my master so he didn't go in the
[1:32:22] local paper there
[1:32:24] he didn't go to the local media site or
[1:32:27] the local you know place where you can
[1:32:29] find a clean girl find someone to marry
[1:32:33] for Isaac he goes on his knees I want
[1:32:37] you to look at the miracle and the
[1:32:39] chance that this man takes showing up
[1:32:42] into the City and asking God to answer
[1:32:47] the prayer for his servant Abraham he's
[1:32:52] looking for a bride he needs something
[1:32:55] miraculous to happen something deeper or
[1:32:58] greater than him must must take place
[1:33:01] you know the responsibility is on him
[1:33:05] but now when God gives you an
[1:33:08] impossible responsibility then he's the
[1:33:12] one who can make the impossible possible
[1:33:16] amen so if God is requiring the church
[1:33:19] to live a clean holy life then the holy
[1:33:23] God that made the requirement can live
[1:33:26] that life through the believer today
[1:33:28] that you can live a clean and holy life
[1:33:32] amen because that's the requirement
[1:33:34] we're required to take Jesus's place
[1:33:38] today we're required to lay hands on the
[1:33:41] sick and they shall recover we're
[1:33:43] required to preach the gospel we're
[1:33:45] required to represent this glorious word
[1:33:50] that is coming our day and that's a
[1:33:52] tremendous requirement if you really
[1:33:54] internalize it if you take it seriously
[1:33:57] then you know some people are looking
[1:33:59] for an excuse like these servants I
[1:34:02] gotta go I got to go I got to do this I
[1:34:04] can't do that right now well I tried and
[1:34:06] didn't work but this servant really said
[1:34:08] he he ask he said if if it doesn't work
[1:34:11] am am I he says you're released from it
[1:34:14] I you swear to me if you if you can't
[1:34:16] find it then then you're released from
[1:34:19] this oath but swear to me that you won't
[1:34:22] bring a daughter just from the children
[1:34:25] of men swear to me that it'll be a
[1:34:28] quality uh girl for my son Isaac so this
[1:34:32] burden and this weight and this
[1:34:34] tremendous responsibility is laid upon
[1:34:37] him now we know that in the message that
[1:34:40] brother brandham tells us that um the
[1:34:43] message ashamed brother brandham he is
[1:34:48] going through the Public Service Company
[1:34:52] and he has a dream
[1:34:54] that he's back at the Public Service
[1:34:56] Company and he keeps you know getting
[1:35:00] his money mixed up it's just a dream as
[1:35:03] a serviceman he got his personal money
[1:35:05] mixed up with the company's money while
[1:35:08] he was on the job and so this begin to
[1:35:10] stress him out and he had this dream one
[1:35:14] time and then he prayed as Lord what
[1:35:16] have I done and when the city had uh uh
[1:35:19] had did wrong to him according with with
[1:35:22] his property he said I just let it go I
[1:35:24] won't Soo him he had a lawsuit against
[1:35:26] the city but he said I'll let that go
[1:35:28] because I'm still bothered by something
[1:35:31] I did on the Public Service Company and
[1:35:34] it's bothering me so the dream happens
[1:35:36] again he still happening this dream and
[1:35:39] then he remembers while he was at the
[1:35:41] Public Service Company the company would
[1:35:43] give him 50 cents worth of a breakfast
[1:35:48] to eat it was part of all of the
[1:35:50] employees would get 50 cents to eat
[1:35:53] brother random says I didn't eat that
[1:35:55] much I'd only eat 10 cents of it and
[1:35:57] that's the ticket he would turn in 10
[1:35:59] cents and then he said at the great
[1:36:01] meeting with his company the supervisor
[1:36:04] said who's the knead turning in only 10
[1:36:07] cents everybody else is turning in 50
[1:36:10] cents and he says well I don't eat that
[1:36:13] much he says well turn it in anyways he
[1:36:15] says but I don't eat that much he says
[1:36:17] turn it in everybody else is doing it
[1:36:20] you do it too so with that peer pressure
[1:36:22] it was a supervis ER he goes ahead and
[1:36:25] he turns in 50 cents worth of a
[1:36:27] breakfast that he didn't eat so he'd eat
[1:36:30] the 10 cents and the rest of it he said
[1:36:32] he'll give it to other children around
[1:36:35] and so um and he was thinking that God
[1:36:38] was holding that against him and that
[1:36:40] was like 40
[1:36:42] cents 40 cents difference that was
[1:36:46] causing him distress and this you know
[1:36:48] and so he he kept on and the Lord was
[1:36:52] sending him this dream about the uh uh
[1:36:54] and he said well maybe that's what the
[1:36:56] Lord has against me because I keep
[1:36:59] getting this dream about me mixing up my
[1:37:02] money on my job and so the Lord's trying
[1:37:06] to speak to him so finally he keeps
[1:37:09] dreaming this dream and then the message
[1:37:12] of Shame he says that he finally goes to
[1:37:15] the Lord in prayer and one day the the
[1:37:18] Holy Spirit leads him to pick up his
[1:37:21] Bible First he cries out Lord what have
[1:37:24] I done what have I done wrong why am I
[1:37:27] still having this dream that I've
[1:37:30] misused the money at the Public Service
[1:37:32] Company and the Lord is putting his
[1:37:35] pressure on him and showing him and he
[1:37:37] says he went and got his Bible and he
[1:37:40] takes his Bible he closed his eyes and
[1:37:43] he just let it fall open and he put his
[1:37:45] finger it was Genesis chapter 24 and
[1:37:48] verse 7 now revealing to him that he
[1:37:54] didn't rat on the job but the stress and
[1:37:57] the pressure that comes with the
[1:38:00] ministry that you have it requires that
[1:38:04] that elaser had this stress and this
[1:38:08] pressure to go find a bride for his
[1:38:12] maker find a bride for his master and he
[1:38:16] was the model servant you know a model
[1:38:20] servant a real servant and we're all
[1:38:22] called to that
[1:38:23] if we are real servants they really
[1:38:28] care they really don't take things for
[1:38:32] granted that it means something to
[1:38:36] them the words that are
[1:38:39] spoken the tally that must be accounted
[1:38:44] for the the weights and the
[1:38:48] balances the quotes and am I getting it
[1:38:52] right I mean if you are really a true
[1:38:58] gospel parent or preacher or parishioner
[1:39:03] whatever you are you really want to get
[1:39:06] it right and people that are made up of
[1:39:09] this caliber they they they pay
[1:39:13] attention to the
[1:39:14] details and they hold it very dear to
[1:39:18] them when they make a wrong when there's
[1:39:21] an error they want to make that right
[1:39:24] how many you know what I'm talking about
[1:39:27] sure they want to make sure these things
[1:39:29] have been have been have been dealt with
[1:39:33] that I'm handling the word right that
[1:39:36] I'm not taking it for granted what would
[1:39:38] you think if if there's a vision and
[1:39:40] there's many what what would you think
[1:39:42] if there's a vision that God gave and
[1:39:45] you don't give it the proper attention
[1:39:49] that he wanted you to give it would
[1:39:51] wouldn't you say wouldn't you say
[1:39:54] there's some accountability to that I
[1:39:56] gave you that Vision but you you put it
[1:39:59] to the side and said it didn't mean
[1:40:01] anything or does it mean as much to you
[1:40:04] and this is what ministers do this is
[1:40:07] what people do they'll take portions of
[1:40:10] the word of God and they'll use it for
[1:40:13] their own Advantage but when you got to
[1:40:16] take all of the word of God then you're
[1:40:19] going to C it's going to cost you some
[1:40:21] friends it's going to cost you you some
[1:40:24] you know some
[1:40:25] relationships it might cost you some
[1:40:28] membership but you got to stay true to
[1:40:30] the
[1:40:31] word and this man
[1:40:35] eleazer I believe we'll see him again I
[1:40:38] don't know if he was circumcised I
[1:40:39] believe he was circumcised he would have
[1:40:41] been part of the group that went to
[1:40:43] deliver lot he was part of the group
[1:40:46] that was there with Abraham's growth
[1:40:49] from just uh uh no a Barren man to a man
[1:40:52] having children he was there he was a
[1:40:54] very important man I believe we'll see
[1:40:56] him
[1:40:57] again huh yeah I think so we'll see this
[1:41:01] elzer again here he is placed with this
[1:41:04] responsibility and I and this is what I
[1:41:06] want to place on you uh this morning the
[1:41:11] question is in the message is your life
[1:41:15] worthy of the
[1:41:18] Gospel is your life worthy of the
[1:41:22] visions
[1:41:24] is your life worthy of over 1,200
[1:41:28] recorded
[1:41:29] sermons is your life worthy of the
[1:41:34] Gospel the
[1:41:38] Bible now the Bible was written with all
[1:41:42] of the energy and instructions of a well
[1:41:46] detailed author someone who cared pinned
[1:41:51] it the way he pinned it put it together
[1:41:54] the way he put it together and it's not
[1:41:56] to be handled Loosely or lightly but
[1:41:59] many people
[1:42:00] do but we want to live a life that's
[1:42:03] worthy of the
[1:42:05] gospel and then we want to be able to
[1:42:07] stand before him and say Lord I'm at
[1:42:11] your
[1:42:12] service

[1:49:16] pressure on Rebecca and her family says
[1:49:19] no you need to make a decision now you
[1:49:22] need to make this decision and this is
[1:49:25] what a model servant will do he'll be
[1:49:29] steadfast for a
[1:49:32] decision he needs to find that decision
[1:49:37] that has been made he needs to have a
[1:49:41] Cornerstone something to found upon well
[1:49:45] maybe I kind of maybe somewhat I'm kind
[1:49:48] of thinking about it well no the
[1:49:50] messenger and the word of God puts the
[1:49:53] pressure on you on where do you stand in
[1:49:55] the word where do you stand in these
[1:49:58] things that God is trying to reveal to
[1:50:01] his church where do you stand in all of
[1:50:04] the word of God or all of the
[1:50:07] quotations I'll drop back here just for
[1:50:09] a minute I was reading a quotation about
[1:50:13] that brother brandham talks about those
[1:50:15] servants the Ravens that they kept the
[1:50:18] voice of Elijah alive during the famine
[1:50:22] and that's a quotation that brother bam
[1:50:24] makes and so in that
[1:50:26] quotation we're ref we're being
[1:50:29] referenced as Ravens doesn't mean we're
[1:50:33] all Ravens in all types and shadows but
[1:50:35] in that particular uh reference there
[1:50:39] he's showing that they were the servants
[1:50:42] that kept Elijah's voice alive during
[1:50:46] the time of the famine so a Believer
[1:50:48] doesn't have a problem with that why
[1:50:51] because that's what he said
[1:50:53] that's the reference point it is I don't
[1:50:56] have my own quotations to bring we're
[1:50:59] preaching something that has already
[1:51:02] been brought to us and it's our job to
[1:51:05] stay with that word man that's what a
[1:51:08] true servant will do he'll keep you
[1:51:10] steadfast for a decision to stay with
[1:51:13] the word what word this word you know I
[1:51:17] was I mentioned this in the church in
[1:51:19] Phoenix about reading in between the
[1:51:22] lines and I went back again to read some
[1:51:24] more quotations on it because I did a
[1:51:26] study on it some some years ago and then
[1:51:30] I went back to read it again and brother
[1:51:32] bam was talking about how your Bible is
[1:51:34] a love letter and that when you fall in
[1:51:37] love with the author then you can read
[1:51:39] between the lines it's a love letter and
[1:51:43] then he gives an example he said that
[1:51:46] job specified his burying place because
[1:51:50] you got to read between the Lin to find
[1:51:53] out why Jacob wanted to be buried there
[1:51:56] and all the prophets wanted to be buried
[1:51:58] and Abraham buried his dead there read
[1:52:01] between the lines you'll see that the
[1:52:02] resurrection happens there so but a
[1:52:05] prophet had to show us that didn't he
[1:52:07] and then he also brings out the example
[1:52:10] of Abraham and Sarah being turned young
[1:52:13] again so you got to read in between the
[1:52:15] lines how did she make this journey
[1:52:18] after 80 years old how did a young man
[1:52:21] looking for a new bride pick Grandma to
[1:52:24] be his wife you got to read in between
[1:52:26] the lines we saw those scriptures our
[1:52:29] whole life in the denomination we never
[1:52:31] read that between the line but when the
[1:52:33] prophet reads between the line then we
[1:52:37] can read between a
[1:52:40] line and them is the only lines we can
[1:52:42] read in between just keep it real see
[1:52:46] because now brother bam said read in
[1:52:49] between the lines so let me take what he
[1:52:50] preached on the seven seal let me read
[1:52:52] in between the lines
[1:52:54] stop that's not how you read in between
[1:52:56] the line you read in between the lines
[1:52:58] as he read in between the lines this is
[1:53:02] where the other doctrines come from
[1:53:05] because brother so and so is Reading in
[1:53:07] between the lines and you ain't getting
[1:53:09] it and brother so so over here is
[1:53:11] Reading in between the lines and then
[1:53:13] they ain't getting it and everybody's
[1:53:15] reading in between the line to where
[1:53:17] they not even saying what a it's not
[1:53:19] even a quote anymore
[1:53:23] so that's a little study for you to
[1:53:25] do you can do it yourself reading in
[1:53:28] between the lines and then you go tell
[1:53:29] me how you going to go read in between
[1:53:31] the lines yourself and come up with
[1:53:34] something that the prophet didn't bring
[1:53:37] stop so we read in between the lines as
[1:53:40] and there's a quote where he says the
[1:53:43] prophets were able to read in between
[1:53:47] the lines that's what he
[1:53:49] says so we see this the model servant is
[1:53:53] interested in every
[1:53:55] word and those that follow this model
[1:53:58] servant Rebecca will be interested in
[1:54:02] every word all right let's go a little
[1:54:05] bit further it's 11:40
[1:54:13] okay lean her brother said just give her
[1:54:17] 10 days to make up her mind she's the
[1:54:19] one that's going to have to make up her
[1:54:21] mind give her 10 days
[1:54:22] so the true servant the model servant
[1:54:26] said no let her go now so they decided
[1:54:30] for Rebecca to make up her own mind and
[1:54:33] that's what you've got to do tonight
[1:54:35] you've got to make up your own mind you
[1:54:37] can't take the mind or what somebody
[1:54:39] else has said it's got to be your
[1:54:41] attitude towards the message that you
[1:54:44] hear you can't take if the doctor turns
[1:54:47] you down he said you're going to die now
[1:54:50] you either you got to believe what he
[1:54:52] said said your mother says if you go
[1:54:54] down to the angelist temple brother bam
[1:54:57] continues on so I just to save a little
[1:54:59] time that was in the message time of
[1:55:02] decision so you have to make up your
[1:55:05] mind and so I'm bringing this how am I
[1:55:08] bringing this I'm bringing this at
[1:55:09] brother brandham elzer was a model
[1:55:11] servant obviously brother brandham was a
[1:55:13] model servant preachers pastors and
[1:55:16] teachers have to be model servants then
[1:55:19] the believer too has to be a model
[1:55:21] servant and a faithful servant that can
[1:55:24] say Lord I'm at your service these
[1:55:28] principles they transferred to the
[1:55:31] believer the qualities in elaser
[1:55:34] transferred to the qualities that was in
[1:55:37] Rebecca they're related they're
[1:55:39] connected and those qualities have to
[1:55:41] translate to the gospel preacher of
[1:55:44] today and the believer of today they
[1:55:47] have those same qualities you see the
[1:55:50] way brother brandham handled the word
[1:55:52] word he had to be every word if it's not
[1:55:55] in the word he wouldn't accept it that
[1:55:57] has to come over into the believer's
[1:55:59] life today can you all see that so we we
[1:56:03] all should be model servants men and
[1:56:05] women young and old preachers non
[1:56:07] preachers
[1:56:09] amen amen I get one or two amens it's
[1:56:11] okay what what is it June or July where
[1:56:15] we
[1:56:18] at oh my yes sir the time of decision
[1:56:23] brother bam continues on and he says
[1:56:25] this
[1:56:29] here paragraph number
[1:56:32] 16 all right I'm just going to close
[1:56:34] just now
[1:56:35] okay who said no don't close thank you
[1:56:39] one two two I got two or three in the
[1:56:41] witness of two or
[1:56:43] three everything else be EST staish so
[1:56:47] let me let me get this out all right but
[1:56:49] I'm going to close here in just a moment
[1:56:51] I'm not going to hold you long Lord
[1:56:52] would help me but I want to lay this out
[1:56:55] here this this is in the message the
[1:56:57] time of decision paragraph number 16
[1:56:59] brother man says this here God's looking
[1:57:02] for men today that will move when the
[1:57:05] spirit
[1:57:06] moves and anywhere that he may sin
[1:57:10] that's a model servant did we get that
[1:57:13] so what is a model servant it's Romans 8
[1:57:17] Sons and Daughters of God are led by
[1:57:20] what
[1:57:22] by the spirit of God a Son of God is Not
[1:57:26] led by other groups of
[1:57:29] people you see these massive groups
[1:57:32] leaving from one Church going to another
[1:57:35] I'm not criticizing those who do it but
[1:57:37] it's just curious to me how did
[1:57:39] everybody make the same decision to
[1:57:41] leave at the same time as a big group
[1:57:43] like that and we supposed to be serving
[1:57:45] the lord
[1:57:48] individually ask yourself that question
[1:57:51] if the Lord leads you to go from point A
[1:57:54] to point B let him lead you but don't
[1:57:58] follow a group of
[1:58:03] people yes sir I know I'm at home
[1:58:07] now God's looking for men today that
[1:58:10] will move in the spirit move this is a
[1:58:12] challenge this is a challenge let's be
[1:58:15] honest if everybody else is doing it
[1:58:18] this way all the other preachers all
[1:58:20] other groups everybody else is doing it
[1:58:21] this this way isn't it easier to do it
[1:58:24] that way just to follow that way sure
[1:58:27] sure do I get that pressure sure do you
[1:58:30] get that pre peer pressure is what it's
[1:58:32] caused not just in school it's in every
[1:58:34] Walk of Life if you're a human being you
[1:58:37] there's a pressure to be like and
[1:58:40] accepted by your
[1:58:42] peers but thank God for the Holy Ghost
[1:58:46] when the Holy Ghost comes a man is led
[1:58:50] by the spirit of God
[1:58:52] and when God moves that man it don't
[1:58:55] matter who leaves or who likes he stays
[1:58:59] with the moving of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:01] because God reveals it to him it's a
[1:59:05] revelation I love this about
[1:59:08] eler he prayed his prayer it seems like
[1:59:11] internally he prayed his prayer and he's
[1:59:14] he's he's depending on God to lead him
[1:59:17] in this decision to find this bride not
[1:59:22] even for
[1:59:24] himself it was for his
[1:59:27] master he's depending on it and God
[1:59:31] vindicates it doesn't he what happens
[1:59:34] this little girl comes
[1:59:36] out sees El eer out there with those 10
[1:59:40] camels many of us would have missed it
[1:59:43] right there 10
[1:59:45] camels I mean some of us can't even
[1:59:47] offer a brother a drink let alone 10 of
[1:59:50] his dogs or his camels or or 10 of his
[1:59:53] kids or his
[1:59:55] boys I mean but the character I've
[1:59:58] noticed this can I drop this in real
[2:00:00] quick I noticed this just as a
[2:00:02] contractor going into homes most of the
[2:00:05] S most of the women that will offer us
[2:00:08] something to eat or to drink over the
[2:00:10] years are typically
[2:00:14] women no I've been not say it I'll just
[2:00:18] leave it alone I always take little
[2:00:19] notes like that but there they seem to
[2:00:21] be like like I gotta say it now
[2:00:26] sis they seem to be like um like
[2:00:30] stay-at-home type
[2:00:32] moms and I've noticed
[2:00:34] that they have a care or
[2:00:38] concern of course we got a contract of
[2:00:40] course we getting paid of course the
[2:00:42] deal has been made but they look out the
[2:00:44] window to see who's
[2:00:46] thirsty and then they offer something
[2:00:50] without somebody asking them to do it
[2:00:54] it's character character sees a need and
[2:00:58] it goes do what needs to get done before
[2:01:02] anybody asks him what can you help me
[2:01:04] with this can you open the door can you
[2:01:06] do this over here that's what character
[2:01:08] is that's where Rebecca
[2:01:10] was Eliezer posted that sign out look
[2:01:13] whoever Waters my camel whoever gives me
[2:01:17] water and all the little Honeys and
[2:01:19] little bunnies and little sweeties
[2:01:23] probably would have lined up where we
[2:01:24] going where how much money you got what
[2:01:27] that much are you kidding me sure I
[2:01:30] water a camel get my nails done
[2:01:36] afterwards they ain't the
[2:01:39] deal the deal is here's the
[2:01:43] opportunity you're going to go offer
[2:01:45] this man a drink of water and then I
[2:01:47] want to give you your camel some water
[2:01:50] all of them Ellers just set back watch
[2:01:52] her do it 1 2 3 4 8 n 10 camels she
[2:02:00] watered
[2:02:03] them thank you C and I do too think
[2:02:07] about yourself think about watering 10
[2:02:11] men 10 cups of
[2:02:13] coffee I'm just looking for one but look
[2:02:17] at 10 cups of water for me but this is
[2:02:20] 10 camels
[2:02:22] and this little girl comes out she had
[2:02:26] to be of the same cloth as Isaac she had
[2:02:28] to be the same cloth as the god of the
[2:02:31] Bible she had to be in the same cloth as
[2:02:34] the Eternal one who knew her name she
[2:02:37] come skipping out there doing her thing
[2:02:40] her daily task her daily chore and then
[2:02:42] she sees an opportunity there's a
[2:02:44] stranger offer him some water going Hey
[2:02:47] sir would you like some water huh sure
[2:02:49] I'm quite thirsty can I get some water
[2:02:51] for for your camels too all of them yes
[2:02:55] and he in his heart's like yep that's
[2:02:59] her I don't even know I don't need to
[2:03:01] ask any more question that's her that's
[2:03:05] character that's got to be the one and
[2:03:09] this is what character does it is led by
[2:03:13] the
[2:03:14] spirit you're led to do things not for
[2:03:17] the money you're led to do it because
[2:03:20] you're a son or daughter to of God and
[2:03:23] and and all of this as I said on
[2:03:26] Wednesday a couple Services ago that all
[2:03:28] of this has to be
[2:03:30] motivated by Divine
[2:03:33] love you know when you really love the
[2:03:37] sinner I don't have the quotes with
[2:03:40] me when you really love the sinner
[2:03:43] brother mam says don't just pray for him
[2:03:46] he said go talk to them when you really
[2:03:50] get a l for The Sinner then that'll
[2:03:54] motivate you to go and contact him
[2:03:59] create a way a space to go see him not
[2:04:04] even just Sinners out there what about
[2:04:06] visitors that come into our mid people
[2:04:09] visitors come off the streets people
[2:04:11] come through here two three four times
[2:04:14] and we don't know their names we don't
[2:04:17] even think to even ask because we got to
[2:04:19] go get lunch with brother so and so or
[2:04:21] we got to go get but look around look
[2:04:25] around don't know what that person is
[2:04:27] going through they need that connection
[2:04:30] you're the one that needs to connect
[2:04:31] with them
[2:04:32] amen amen
[2:04:34] Saints and so
[2:04:38] this servant is led by the spirit and
[2:04:42] they're steadfast for a decision and
[2:04:45] they're led by the spirit and now this
[2:04:47] true servant this is what he has to
[2:04:50] contend with this my last quote here
[2:04:53] it's in the message super
[2:04:56] sign let let let let's take time of
[2:04:58] decision one more time paragraph 25 and
[2:05:01] he says this here every true and every
[2:05:04] true servant of God that sent out has
[2:05:06] got a whole book full of divine promises
[2:05:10] that he can offer to the
[2:05:13] bride I'm so glad of that he's got gifts
[2:05:16] in there for her he will not he will not
[2:05:19] hold any of them back he will give every
[2:05:22] one of them freely a true servant a
[2:05:26] model servant a servant that God can can
[2:05:30] put trust in he won't try to hide it
[2:05:33] back from her because he knows that she
[2:05:36] is the oncoming Queen there's no good
[2:05:39] thing withheld from them that'll walk
[2:05:42] upright before him so a real servant
[2:05:45] doesn't hide any of the scriptures or
[2:05:48] the quotes we don't hide any of them
[2:05:49] they're all valid amen amen
[2:05:54] somebody look at these two things that
[2:05:56] brother bam said that this servant has
[2:05:57] to contend
[2:06:00] for and the super sign paragraph 134
[2:06:04] notice elaser found the woman he know
[2:06:08] that was
[2:06:09] her and notice he had to deal with two
[2:06:12] people her mother and the brother the
[2:06:17] Father the rest of them had nothing to
[2:06:19] say mother and brother so has the
[2:06:23] messenger the Holy Ghost of God in this
[2:06:26] last day picking out the bride he's had
[2:06:28] to deal with the church that calls
[2:06:31] itself the mother Catholic and the
[2:06:33] brother the preacher that's exactly had
[2:06:37] to deal with those two they was the one
[2:06:41] that kicked up a fuss about
[2:06:43] it now
[2:06:46] preachers are good people a lot of them
[2:06:50] are but preachers can be problems
[2:06:54] too don't say Amen so loud cuz you know
[2:06:57] I'm setting you up
[2:06:59] right preacher the preacher is the
[2:07:01] problem he's the problem the preacher
[2:07:04] but but all of us got some little
[2:07:06] preacher in us we preaching right out
[2:07:09] there in the parking lot we call them
[2:07:11] parking lot
[2:07:13] prophets parking lot
[2:07:16] preachers sisters who preach brothers
[2:07:20] who preach preachers who preach and
[2:07:23] everybody's preaching and you got to
[2:07:25] deal with this Catholic this mother he
[2:07:29] calls it the Catholic we call it the
[2:07:31] system we call it that denominational
[2:07:34] system and then the preacher you got to
[2:07:36] deal with these interpretations that are
[2:07:38] out there but a real servant is led by
[2:07:41] the spirit of
[2:07:43] God and we thank God for it and we
[2:07:47] appreciate
[2:07:48] it because
[2:07:51] we want to fall in line to be a model
[2:07:56] servant someone that's not speaking of
[2:08:02] himself so a model servant maybe looks
[2:08:06] like
[2:08:07] this in this congregation here
[2:08:11] today there's an area in Tucson that
[2:08:14] needs to hear the word for the first
[2:08:19] time who who is available from this
[2:08:24] group here I know we know how to point
[2:08:26] out who's supposed to be doing
[2:08:28] what we're famous for that well brother
[2:08:31] s he's the one that goes to those people
[2:08:33] or this they can go over there but out
[2:08:35] of this group here who could God
[2:08:40] call like just tap them on the shoulder
[2:08:43] and say you know I need you to go get a
[2:08:46] bride for me as Abraham did to elaser
[2:08:50] over into a country I need to swear to
[2:08:52] me you won't speak of yourself you
[2:08:55] depend on you and you go get a bride for
[2:08:57] me how many of us here are willing to do
[2:08:59] that or are we are we disengaged in that
[2:09:03] part of the
[2:09:04] ministry is it just the Sunday morning
[2:09:07] where we're in the message where we
[2:09:09] receive receive receive and then one day
[2:09:13] we get to go into the Rapture or is
[2:09:15] there still work to be done and if there
[2:09:17] is work to be done who's supposed to be
[2:09:19] doing that work is it is it only the
[2:09:21] brothers is it only the sisters is it
[2:09:24] only the preachers or pastors is it the
[2:09:27] brothers in for five years or 10 years
[2:09:29] who's supposed to be doing that
[2:09:32] work a model
[2:09:35] servant will be
[2:09:37] sent and he'll lay aside his own agendas
[2:09:42] that's what I'm trying to do in my life
[2:09:43] today lay aside my own agendas my own
[2:09:48] you know hopes and dreams and what I
[2:09:50] want and try to find the mind of the
[2:09:53] Lord for my
[2:09:55] service
[2:09:58] Lord I'm at your
[2:10:01] service can can you say that
[2:10:04] today can you come to his Altar and say
[2:10:08] Lord I'm at your service maybe you want
[2:10:12] to use me in a way you've never used me
[2:10:14] or anybody else before
[2:10:18] maybe but are you willing to do that
[2:10:22] you know this elaser seemed like a very
[2:10:26] very good man to have in your
[2:10:30] house seemed like a faithful man the
[2:10:33] Bible calls him the faithful servant in
[2:10:36] all of Abraham's house you know what
[2:10:39] does that word faithful mean faithful
[2:10:41] means remaining loyal and
[2:10:46] steadfast true to the facts or the
[2:10:50] original
[2:10:52] that's what that word faithful mean one
[2:10:54] of the meanings true to the facts or the
[2:10:57] original remaining loyal and steadfast
[2:11:01] you know some people they're very
[2:11:04] intense but they don't have any
[2:11:07] consistency with that intensity so when
[2:11:09] you see their intensity they look strong
[2:11:12] they look like a leader they look like
[2:11:14] but they don't they don't hold out it's
[2:11:16] not faithful it's not
[2:11:18] steadfast but a a faithful servant is
[2:11:22] steadfast not just the intensity of
[2:11:25] getting things started or being the
[2:11:27] loudest Voice or even appearing like a
[2:11:29] leader uh that's what what what about
[2:11:33] what about being
[2:11:36] consistent when the
[2:11:39] crowd isn't saying Amen on the Sunday
[2:11:42] morning for
[2:11:44] you does that happen
[2:11:47] sometimes I got to get out of here real
[2:11:49] quick
[2:11:51] what happens when what happens when it's
[2:11:54] not friendly for you to be in charge of
[2:11:56] whatever you're in charge the Sunday
[2:11:59] school class is normally 30 to maybe 40
[2:12:02] and then you show up there's only
[2:12:05] five I guess we should
[2:12:08] cancel not not a model servant what's a
[2:12:12] model servant a model servant shows up
[2:12:15] and is ready to be called
[2:12:18] upon even without prior
[2:12:24] notice what's the Bible say about that
[2:12:27] that a Workman should be instant win in
[2:12:31] season when and when else and out of
[2:12:34] season you're supposed to live ready
[2:12:37] live ready live ready to
[2:12:42] serve it might be your Rebecca
[2:12:45] moment it might be your camel watering
[2:12:49] moment this little girl watering these
[2:12:52] 10 camels giving her time to this man
[2:12:55] she don't even know probably never see
[2:12:57] him again but she's watering those
[2:12:59] camels but in the divine revelation
[2:13:03] she's actually watering her own camels
[2:13:07] those camels are hers and she's watering
[2:13:11] this one camel number one camel maybe a
[2:13:13] little pat on the camel this one paddle
[2:13:15] on the shoulder little camel what you
[2:13:17] going to get paid Rebecca we don't know
[2:13:20] you see this man again probably not what
[2:13:22] you doing it for because it needs to be
[2:13:25] get done you must have been raised in
[2:13:26] the right house yeah my dad and mom are
[2:13:28] good people watering this man's camel
[2:13:31] watering this man's camel and come to
[2:13:33] find out these camels are
[2:13:36] yours plus and where you going you won't
[2:13:40] have to water no more
[2:13:43] camels that's how it turns like that you
[2:13:47] show the character first and then the
[2:13:50] blessing comes afterwards and look at
[2:13:54] elaser a model servant in the Bible how
[2:13:57] about you and I
[2:13:58] today
[2:14:00] are are you willing are you a model
[2:14:02] servant can you say within your heart
[2:14:06] Lord I'm at your service you know if I'm
[2:14:09] invited to preach at a denomination I
[2:14:12] can go in there with the with the
[2:14:13] mindset I'm going to go give them the
[2:14:15] word I'm going go take the message in
[2:14:17] there if they reject the pillar of fire
[2:14:19] they're serpent SE I can take that
[2:14:21] attitude I can say well I got the word
[2:14:23] I'm in the message they invited me go
[2:14:25] burn them out of there blast them out
[2:14:27] give them the word test or or I could

[2:14:37] with these people today how do you want
[2:14:40] to use me in this group today I think
