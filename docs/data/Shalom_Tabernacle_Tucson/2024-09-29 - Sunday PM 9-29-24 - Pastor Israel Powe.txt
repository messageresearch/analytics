encourage them as our prayer we commit ourselves to you right now and ask for uh your guidance your leadership and your anointing to come upon us we pray we ask in Jesus name amen amen God bless each of you so happy to be in the house of the Lord with you this morning this evening once again I we like to welcome you to the house of the Lord and appreciate the song specials very very nice always good to hear that singing we'd like to go into the word just for a few moments and um ask you to stand turn your Bibles into St Mark chapter 7 talk about this approach just a little bit in verse number 24 and from then he rose and went into the borders with Tyrie and sidon and entered into a home and would have no man know it but he could not be hid for a certain woman whose daughter had an unclean Spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet the woman was a Greek sosian by nation and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter but Jesus said unto her let the children first be filled for it is not me to take the children's bread and to cast it unto the dogs and she said she answered and said unto him yes Lord yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs and he said unto her for this saying go thy way the devil is gone out of thy daughter and when she was come to her house she found the devil gone out and her daughter laid upon the bed amen amen we'll take one more scripture in Romans chapter 8 I think verse 30 is what I want but let's take verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom we did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called then he also Justified whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us isn't that nice amen may God add a blessing to the reading of his word it always encourages us when we read seated amen you may be seated we're going talk about approach just a little bit as this morning talking how the blood speaks and here this little woman had a daughter and she had a devil an evil or an unclean Spirit as the Bible calls it and this unclean Spirit um no doubt did what unclean things do it causes troubles it causes problems the evil spirit is not um it's not something any of us desire or want but we have to fight through them and we've had all of us have had evil spirits and that's why we need to be born again by the Holy Spirit to take that evil spirit out of us and it's a shame that many people don't realize or recognize that they need to be born again they think because they didn't do any wrong they didn't commit any crimes that we call Big sins or great sins that um that they're okay I'm not bothering anyone I didn't hurt anyone I'm not stealing I didn't physically hurt anyone but every man needs to be born again and when you can look in the word and you can see God as your healer and you can see him as a deliverer you can see him through the Old Testament and the Great Signs wonders and miracles you'll see all those things in there and if you'll keep looking you you'll see yourself in there and when you see yourself you'll see your sin and you'll see how black your sin is and that's what the word of the Lord turns the light on on how dark your sin is and then when you can see that you're a sinner and then you can see Calvary that somebody saved you then it's all over then but you got to see that that and you have to recognize God is not going to repent for you or me repentance is something that you have to do and um we'll see as we grow closer to the Lord that that repentance it develops even greater and greater the sins get heavier and heavier and you could get by with doing things and no one in the church no one in the entire world would ever know that you were even guilty but God would know it and then your conscience would know it and then you'd have to make that right amen and so this woman had a tremendous problem and she brought this brought this problem to the right person and the right person we know is the Lord Jesus Christ brought him brought her she comes into the presence of the Lord Jesus and She lays out her reest Quest and calls on him Lord um she first calls him son of David have mercy on me she was a Greek she was of a different Nation they had some strict laws and boundaries there that they didn't they didn't cross up the Jews or the Hebrews were very strict on who they ate with who they were seen with what house they would go into and here this woman is a Greek um an unclean Nation by title when God Called Moses and the children of Israel out of Egypt he told him not to be partaker with the the evil Nations and all their unbelief and things that they did and here she is an outsider she is not one of the end group looks like she wasn't even invited but she presses her way to get to the right person and the right person is the Lord Jesus and you know when you get into his presence he just might throw a test your way he loves to test he he loves to test test faith and we would think that you know a woman like this or a visitor coming and outset her we would make everything comfortable for her and for this Outsider so there was no nobody would say anything to offend her so she couldn't turn away and put a bad name upon the group that wasn't the case at all she comes in the presence of the right man the right group where the healing was taking place she heard about it and she got a utter rebuke now I don't know how many church members the ones that I've come across and even myself even myself look at yourself and say even myself how many church members can deal with what this little woman dealt with we are so touchy and fickle that can't nobody even look at us wrong before we leave out of a place offended and people that you know love you too let alone strangers coming into a place looking for some help uh to for her not it's not for me it's for my daughter she got a devil I heard heard others were getting touched and healed can I get a can I get a slice of that can I get a touch of that can I get a piece of that and he called her and her people a dog that had to hurt wasn't expecting that not from the Lord Jesus not from the master the Healer he calls her and her people a dog put yourself in her shoes some of us are looking for somebody to do something to us so that we can have a reason to walk around with an attitude but she's not playing Church she's not playing games she just wants results I I if you gonna call me a dog and my daughter get healed call me a dog that's fine I want my daughter to be healed that's what I'm here for and I'm here to hear the word of the Lord I'm not here it be nice to make more friends but I might not make more friends but if I don't make make more friends and people don't like me but I can still hear the word of the Lord thank you Lord Jesus I want to hear his word so this is the approach that got her that moved her into a next level of rare people rare Believers rare comers and she now is getting Jesus's attention you know everybody most people could have walked away but not her she stays right with it and she makes a statement Jesus drops a statement then she makes a statement what do she say she didn't argue with him didn't disagree with him didn't try to prove her Point really really we're not that dirty we're kind of clean Lord she didn't come like that or none and she said what she say you got me Lord that's true but even the dogs you created them too they got to eat too even the dogs eat from the master's table can I get a crumb Lord and these words caught Jesus and he said for this say he didn't pray for her he didn't go see her daughter he just said for this saying that devil has left your daughter brother banam goes further and tells us so say right things say say good things as we said this morning speak better things because your words really mean something and there are confession let's take a few messages here brother Ram talks about the approach to any Divine gift and paragraph number 81 just above it a little bit paragraph 80 says right out of the city I can hear some of them saying now look where are you going now she pushed on by them old critics went right on out Jesus hadn't gotten town yet and she got to where he was this is talking about Mary and Martha now watch look like she would have had a right to abraid him look like she'd had a right to scold him and say why didn't you come Oh I thought you could heal if she would the miracle would have have never taken place it's your approach to a Divine gift what br brings the results it's the way you come to it isn't that right the way you approach anything she come in the right approach she came out she fell down on her knees she said Lord did didn't this regard his T title Lord if thou would have been here my brother had not died oh my that touched him she knew if she could get right into his heart she'd get what she wanted said Lord if if thou would have been here my brother would not have died but even now Lord whatever you ask God God will do it I like that even now Lord he's dead he's been buried four days Undertakers Tak have taken him out there and in bombed his body put him away he's been dead four days and he's just mortifying in the earth there but even now whatever you ask God God will do it so let's look at that just a moment and St John chapter 11 the gospel the ministry of the Lord Jesus is here St John 11 saw how he dealt dealt with this woman and her daughter and these are two of his friends Mary and Martha verse number five verse number four and uh St John 11 when Jesus heard that he uh when Jesus had heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified thereby now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus and when he had heard therefore that he was sick he Abode two days still in the same place where he was then after that saith he to his disciples let us go in Judea again his disciples say unto him Master the Jews of late sought to Stone thee there and goest thou thither again Jesus answered are there not 12 hours in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him these things said he and after that he said unto them our friend Lazareth sleepeth but I go that I might awake him out of his sleep his disciples said Lord if he sleep he doeth well so they didn't understand and so here he is he waits a few days uh Lazarus is now dead and verse number 23 verse number 19 will say many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in their house then said Marthur unto jesuslord if thou had been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee now I want you to think about where this this little sister her brother is dead now it's been four days that that they already uh buried him and bombed him they've already had the memorial and everything and Jesus finally shows up and look at her attitude her attitude was Lord if you'd have been here when my brother was sick when we was calling for you when there was still a hope a chance if you'd have been here my brother would not have died that's a beautiful compliment that's a lot of Faith Lord if you was here this none of this craziness would have happened but he's dead now but even now Lord whatever you say God will do it now this moves God these kind of words these little exercises of faith when the bad news has come and things undesirable has come your way and it looks like the finality of whatever you're trying to accomplish look like it's over with there's no hope it uh it's too late I I can't see it happening that's still you still got a hope sis you still got a hope my brother to to speak the right thing to keep the right right attitude all at all times just keep the right attitude because the right attitude is how we approach any Divine gift with the right attitude will determine the results that you get from it and this is a hopeless case one is this woman is outside of the race of the Hebrews of the Jews and here is a woman whose brother is dead for 4 days now but but see they their approach was correct because their attitude was right and the reason why you walk upon on people the way you do is because your attitude isn't right and if your attitude is right then your approach will be right your attitude is the way you think is what's going on up here is what's going on in your heart that's your attitude you drive with it you ride with it and then finally you come in contact with the situation then we see what your attitude is by your approach approach and the approach that these two women had or these two cases had just beautiful lovely so we'll continue here in the message uh the ministry of Christ paragraph 61 brother bam says this speaking of this about Martha again Mary and Martha she just pressed right on through never paid any attention she got out to where Jesus was now naturally she had a right to up braid him look like why didn't you come to my brother listen close why didn't you come when we called you we know you saw my text message why didn't you answer it when I sent it let me get back to the quote here why didn't you come when I when we called you now we left the church we left everything we left our priests we went against his will we we kept we kept you in our home we paid you out of our money we fed you with our food we give you clothes and when my brother was sick we sinned for you and you turned your back on us and went away every bit of that would have been truth but brother let me tell you something now it's your attitude towards any Divine gift your approach to that attitude determines what you're going to get out of of it you just come to God in the wrong way Jesus just come walking into the city but she didn't do that she ran out to him she fell down at his feet she says Lord that's what he was Lord if thou would have been here my brother would not have died amen and the message continuing for the faith paragraph three the prophet says this I just want to read a couple of these he is the same Lord Jesus you notice in his ministry he only raised three from the dead in his ministry here on Earth he raised jeras his daughter the woman son that was buried Lazarus 3 is a confirmation he could have done more if the father would have showed him now let us be reverent as and let us take the right attitude towards the Lord Jesus for be it assured that your attitude towards any any Divine gift will determine what what results you get from it amen now amen so God bless you richly let's take this last one this is with this woman that had this daughter with the devil in the message persever in 1964 paragraph 111 the prophet of God says she said truth Lord but the dogs can eat the crumbs that's under the children's table that's got it that got it she was not a hot house plant she was not a hybrid Bunch so-called Believers that we have the crop of today she had genuine Faith she admitted he was right but she wasn't after even all the bread that the children can eat she just searching for crumbs we either get the yes or we don't have any at all we'll walk away from it and then say we got faith they don't treat me right I'll walk out that's no faith that's not faith faith is there what am I trying to say to you friends we're going to have a prayer line here one of these nights and I want to see not one stretcher one wheelchair one crutch or nothing but what's laying here on the floor and them walking on out see unless you come with the right kind of of approach you're not going to get anything that's right you're just walking right through somebody slapping a hand on you and going on out that's no good you've got to know what you're come he that cometh to God Must Believe now watch remember she had never seen a miracle she was a Greek she was a gentile she had never seen a miracle yet she had faith that there was such a thing year after year day after day we see Miracles and just can't hold on an hour or two she was like the Rahab Harlot Rahab the Harlot Rahab didn't want the Gentile woman she didn't want to see how Joshua wore his clothes or see how Joshua I have heard and I believe that's all she heard and she believed Jesus said for this saying she had the right approach to the gift of God remember she was the first Gentile that a Miracles ever performed on because of her faith faith admits the word is Right humbles itself same as it does today amen so we know that Faith admits that the word is right and then there is our approach to that Divine gift any Divine gift now here's a few quotes I had put together I've had them for some time several months and I've never printed them out I had them together I think I've quoted it maybe once or twice but here's a series of quotes where brother bandam is in a prayer line or dealing with the gift of God in his life and he catches people off guard and and pronounces their healing and then tells them that they had more faith than they perhaps realized and how many of us have more faith then we realize our minds we might say things that we shouldn't say but if you're Bel a Believer then you have faith you have to have faith if you're a Believer can I get one witness how many Believers here tonight if you are a Believer you have faith don't let the devil or anything contrary tell you anything different I am a Christian I have faith I have faith in the God that I serve and my faith is the power that pleases the Lord without faith it's impossible to please him so as a Believer I have the faith and sometimes it's laying there sometimes it seems quiet sometimes we don't see it like we want but it's there and brother random brings it out in this message here Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 1962 he says if God will tell me what your need move up just a little bit he says now see see the way you get to a gift it's your it's your approach to it one time when Jesus was talking to the people a woman touched His Garment she felt virtue but a w a Roman soldier put a rag on his head and hit him on the head and said if you can see Visions or prophesy tell me who hit you he didn't feel no virtue it's your approach if God will tell me what your need is uh being that you're in contact with the spirit of God now will you believe then that pury will leave you that's right isn't it you got more faith than really you thought you had now you're really now you're really know that something's anointing you now when I said that that just boosted your faith wasn't that right now you look at me as God's Prophet you're not from this city you're not from around here here you come from a big place it's Detroit amen sorry sis that's paragraph 101 in the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says if God would tell me what your need is being that you're in contact with the spirit of God now will you believe then the plur will leave you that's right isn't it you got more faith than really you thought you had amen all right all right we'll take the next one he says here in the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 1962 this is paragraph 107 this man sitting right back here yeah right behind brother sthan there has trouble with his legs if you believe me with all your heart sir you got more faith than you thought you had raise up your hands all right it's over if you'll believe it amen let's say praise the Lord amen prophet of God continues in the message Faith 1956 uh you can find them sis if you put more faith than and and and hold those quotes like that in the brackets whatever paragraph 96 do you believe that lady setting right there yes you had more faith than you thought you had see faith is a subconscious Thing lady faith is not a mental act see it's something that you subconsciously do it people try to look to their intellects for Faith When Faith doesn't lay in here reasons lay here Faith lays in the soul now the trouble with your foot and leg you believe that Jesus Christ will make you well you do you accept it believe it had a little arthritis too but Jes Jesus Christ makes you well you believe it all right then you can have it amen amen she just kind of had to come to herself for the angel of the Lord was standing over her see Jesus said if thou can't believe how many like to have one of those moments where you need to come to yourself cuz the angel of the Lord is upon you Lord I'm ready for you to just anoint me at any time bless me one more time Lord I'll make you feel welcome you can you can stop by my Pew anytime and bless me and let me lose myself and if I get too happy to dance then Lord let me dance and say Amen Let me if I want to shout let me get a shout out of there oh my we need more of those moments where the anointing would touch us just one more time amen paragraphs 262 in the message the eagle stirreth here is a lady sitting right out here can't you see that light over that woman she's got a gallbladder trouble she's going to miss it God help Miss small do you believe God will heal you of that Gall blad trouble the sister says amen then stand on your feet you had more faith than you thought you had I don't know the woman that was God's grace if we are strangers wave your hands like

blessing where the Lord is talking to you the Lord told her to go on with her message praise the Lord all right we didn't get it on the screen so y'all couldn't say Amen we'll get it next time then you'll say Amen paragraph 115 the prophet of God says this this is my last quote on this part okay he says how many's been in the me reads raise your hand see that done raise your hands everywhere certainly it will it's perfect it's God sometimes people have more faith than they think they have you try to make yourself have faith don't do that just humble yourself a man sitting right there the light's still around him right there it surprised him he had that much Faith that's right but he had it and it just isn't that right sir if that's right raise up your hand the man that's healed right down here that's right so there it goes again it's just living that simple Christian life isn't that it it's not trying to make yourself do anything you just take God at his word simply his word says it and then you quote that and you repeat that and then you go on and don't try to worry about the details or making something happen he's already taking care of it for you and so um this scripture that we read in Romans chapter 8 he that justified is also now glorified um brother brandom makes the statement about the Rapture uh brother Bates had read it last week and it just really blessed me and I want to read it again for you tonight because I think it connects with you having faith in you now and that everything you have need of is in you when how many are saved when now how many are healed when you're now healed and it's already done now and he's already got it taken care of we have to go through the motions but as Believers we say as the scripture says it's all ready done it's nigh it's already it's yay and amen in God it's a settled thing in heaven his word is and we get that settled in our mind and our heart that's the way we'll speak and he says this in the message show us the father this is my last quote and God bless you amen paragraph 83 God in his word you believe God is in his word every seed of God every word of God is a seed you believe that now it's just like a seed you planted if it's wheat it'll come up wheat every word of God is every Divine promise of God will come to pass exactly if you'll put it in the right kind of a ground and let it grow do you believe that place it there say Lord by his stripes I was healed I am healed I accept it Lord I'll never say nothing else I tell you brother that spits the dust in the devil's face right there for it's thus sayeth the Lord I'll stay right there live or die I'll stay right there that's my convictions that's my stand that's where on Christ the solid rock I'll stand all other grounds is sinking sand stay right with it yes indeed it'll produce just what it said just like a little here a lot of you people around here have a lot of I notice out here fruit orchards where you raise a lot of apples you take a little apple tree when it's just about that big just a little bitty Sprout did you know every bushel of apples every Apple every Blossom every leaf that'll ever be on that tree is on it right then did you know that you know you might gather 200 bushes of apples off that tree and every one of them is in that little tree when it's that big if it isn't where does it come from tell me who put them on there it's in the tree when it begins and that's just the way what do we have to do with the tree you take the tree you plant it in the ground and then you have to water it and as you water it it doesn't do nothing but drink drink drink it has to drink more than its portion and more it drinks the bigger it swells up it just pushes out limbs then it pushes out leaves then it pushes out blossoms then it pushes out apples is that right and that's the way a Christian is we are planted together in Christ Jesus who is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life we're planted in Christ and we just drink and drink and drink and push out and everything we have need of for the Earthly Journey divine healing the power of God all these other things is in every individual in here that's received the baptism of the Holy Ghost for you're planted in Christ Hallelujah the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir and everything you have need of in this life Journey even the Rapture is right in you then don't resent that that's the truth the Rapture is in us now our prove it by the gospel those that he has called he justified those who he justified he hath glorified Hallelujah then in heaven today where're glorified in the presence of God say with me right now I'm just pushing out to it amen glory to God in his word you believe it all right so if the Rapture is in me now then somebody tell me what else is in me it's some good things in me oh yes I'm a Believer the Rapture is in me now and I'm just pushing out for healing pushing out all the blessings and divine things everything I have need of as a Believer is in me right now and that's enough for me to say Thank You Lord and give him the praise for it my head was down like this now my head is up like this my hands down now my hands are up like this it'll change your praise it'll change your worship it'll change your approach when these things are revealed to you as they should be a believer is a winner why because we already won the battle is already over the victory is won that's why we can sing Victory songs and praise songs it's not not question marks but it's a definite complete work that Calvary Paid It All what's the old hymn say that Jesus Paid It all all to him I owe sin had left the Crimson Stain but he washed it white as snow and now I'm a son or daughter of God With the blessings of God on my life and I can I can do that
