[9:08] Trusting fully trusting in my Savior's

[9:14] Doing what I can for heaven's holy love.
[9:20] Cuz I'm getting ready to leave this
[9:24] world.
[9:26] Getting ready to leave this world. I'm
[9:32] getting ready for the gates of world.
[9:38] Keeping my record right. Watching both
[9:42] day and night. I'm getting ready to

[9:56] In each earthly trial I can
[10:01] oh sure that up in heaven I shall find a
[10:06] place.
[10:08] I'm getting ready to leave this world.
[10:13] I'm getting ready to leave this world.
[10:19] I'm getting ready for the gates of
[10:24] pearl.
[10:25] Keeping my record right, watching both
[10:30] day and night. I'm getting ready to
[10:34] leave this world
[10:37] to prepare a mansion. Jesus said, "I'll
[10:41] go."
[10:43] If it were not true, I would have told
[10:46] you so.
[10:49] Just a little while to linger here
[10:52] below.
[10:54] Then I'm getting ready to leave this
[10:59] world. I'm getting ready to leave this

[11:47] Amen. We'll give our Lord a hand of
[11:49] praise this morning. We go to the key of
[11:52] seas.
[11:55] Once my heart was distressed, the
[11:58] Jehovah's dread frown.
[12:02] Though in the pit where my sin dragged
[12:06] me down, I cried to the Lord from the
[12:10] deep. My reclaim
[12:13] tenderly brought me out to throw
[12:17] [Music]
[12:20] me out of the mighty clay.
[12:25] He set my feet on the rock to stay.
[12:31] He puts a song in my soul today,
[12:36] a song of praise. Hallelujah.
[12:42] He placed me upon the strong rock by his
[12:47] side. My steps were established. And
[12:51] here I'll find. No danger of falling.
[12:57] won't hear. I remain but stand by his
[13:01] grace unto the crown again.
[13:05] For he brought me out of the fiery clay.
[13:12] Sets my feet on the rock to stay.
[13:17] He puts a song in my soul today.
[13:23] A song of praise. Hallelujah.
[13:29] He gave me a song which was a new song
[13:33] of praise. By day and by night, it's
[13:37] sweet notes I will raise. My heart's
[13:41] overflowing.
[13:43] I'm happy and free. I'll praise my
[13:48] redeemer who has resued me. Next verse.
[13:53] God of his wonderful mercy to me. I'll
[13:58] praise him till all men his goodness
[14:02] shall sing.
[14:04] Sing of salvation and hope and abroad
[14:09] till many shall hear the truth and trust
[14:13] in God. Call him brought me out of the
[14:18] fiery clay.

[14:39] Amen. You may be seated this evening.
[14:44] [Music]
[14:53] Amen. We'll go to E flat.
[14:57] [Music]
[14:58] I've had many tears and sorrows.
[15:02] I've had questions for you.
[15:06] There have been times I knew right from
[15:10] wrong.
[15:12] [Music]
[15:14] But in every situation,
[15:18] God gave blessed consolation
[15:22] that my trials only come to make me
[15:27] strong.
[15:30] It's been through it all.
[15:35] Through it all,
[15:39] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[15:43] I've learned to trust in God
[15:47] through it all.
[15:51] Lord, through it all,
[15:55] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[16:01] [Music]
[16:04] I've been a lot of places.
[16:08] I've seen a lot of faces.
[16:12] There have been times I felt so all
[16:16] alone.
[16:17] [Music]
[16:20] But in my lonely hours,
[16:24] those precious lonely hours,
[16:28] Jesus let me know I was his own.
[16:35] And it's been through it all. All
[16:40] through it all,
[16:44] I've learned to trust in Jesus. I have
[16:48] learned to trust in God.
[16:52] Oh, through it all.
[16:56] Oh, through it all,
[17:00] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[17:08] Now I thank God for the mountains.
[17:12] I thank him for the valleyies.
[17:16] I thank him for the storms he's brought
[17:20] me through.
[17:25] For if I never had a problem, I wouldn't
[17:30] know that he could solve them. I never
[17:34] know what faith in God could do.
[17:40] So, it's been through it all.
[17:45] Oh, through it all.
[17:49] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[17:53] I've learned to trust in God.
[17:57] Through it all,
[18:01] Lord, through it all,
[18:05] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[18:12] Amen. Sister Sharon, I'm going to pull
[18:14] on you tonight to sing a special. We'll
[18:16] continue to sing that chorus as she gets
[18:18] ready. And brothers, if you'll help.
[18:20] It's been through it all.
[18:25] Through it all,
[18:29] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[18:33] I've learned to trust in God.
[18:37] Lord, through it all.
[18:42] Oh, through it all,
[18:46] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[18:53] Amen. God bless you.
[19:12] I bless you.
[19:21] [Music]
[19:24] For I
[19:27] will take you
[19:30] from the nations
[19:34] and bring you to
[19:37] your own land.
[19:41] And I'll be

[21:40] a fountain
[21:43] filled with blood drawn from
[21:49] Emmanuel's
[21:51] things.

[21:58] show.
[22:00] May my sin is nothing but the blood
[22:07] of Jesus.

[25:16] [Music]
[25:23] So many times I've questioned
[25:27] certain circumstances,
[25:31] things I could not understand.
[25:39] Many times my trials
[25:42] and weakness blur my vision
[25:46] and my frustration gets so out of hand.
[25:54] Always then I am reminded
[25:58] I've never been forsaken.
[26:02] I've never had to stand one test alone.
[26:09] As I look at all the victories,
[26:13] the spirit rises up in me. Through the
[26:18] fire, my weakness is made strong.
[26:26] He never promised that the cross would
[26:30] not get heavy
[26:32] and the hill would not be hard to climb.
[26:40] [Music]
[26:41] He never offered
[26:44] victories without fighting, but he said
[26:48] help would always come in time.
[26:55] Just remember when you're standing
[26:59] in the valley of decision
[27:03] and the adversary
[27:05] says give in.
[27:09] Just hold on.
[27:14] Our Lord will show up
[27:18] and he will take you through the fire
[27:22] again.
[27:27] He never promised that the cross would
[27:31] not get heavy
[27:34] and the hill would not be hard to climb.
[27:42] He never offered
[27:45] us victories without fighting. He said,
[27:50] "Help would always come in time."
[27:57] Just remember when you're standing
[28:01] in the valley of decision and the
[28:06] adversary
[28:07] says,
[28:11] "Just hold on.
[28:16] Our Lord will show up.
[28:20] He will take you through the fire again.
[28:25] Just remember,
[28:28] just remember when you're standing
[28:32] in the valley of decision.
[28:36] And the adversary
[28:38] says, "Give in.
[28:42] Just hold on.
[28:47] Our Lord will show up
[28:51] and he will take you through the fire
[28:55] again.
[28:57] Amen. Let's give our Lord a hand of
[28:59] praise this evening. Amen. You may be
[29:02] seated.

[29:39] near forever.

[30:18] before.
[30:21] I can't see my family gather
[30:26] sweet faces all familiar.
[30:30] There's no one or feeble anymore.
[30:37] This old lonesome heart is crying. Think
[30:42] I'll spread my wings for flying.

[40:38] prayer, Lord, that you'll move us closer
[40:41] to that. It's in Jesus mighty name we
[40:44] pray.
[40:46] Amen.
[40:47] Amen. God bless you saints. So good to
[40:51] be in the house of the Lord with you.
[40:53] Can you say praise the Lord?
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Well, we're so happy to have each of you
[40:58] and happy to be here with you. I took a
[41:00] very quick uh trip, long but quick trip
[41:03] to Montreal. There was a a youth
[41:06] conference for just youth that were over
[41:10] 28, 28 and above. I'd never been a part
[41:13] of anything like that. They had a roundt
[41:16] discussion and all kind of things like
[41:18] that. And I was very very apprehensive
[41:20] about going and um wife Sharon was going
[41:24] to come. She backed out at the last
[41:25] minute. But um uh I ended up going, but
[41:30] I made it back in time to be in the
[41:31] house of the Lord with the saints in
[41:33] Mesa on Sunday. So, it worked out. I
[41:35] worked it that way. So, I'm here with
[41:36] you uh tonight and uh that was very nice
[41:40] there in Montreal. I spoke one time and
[41:44] um I learned a lot. I always take notes
[41:47] in these kind of events and so something
[41:49] new. I've never seen a venue like that
[41:52] before, but it was interesting to say
[41:54] the least. So, I appreciate brother Joe
[41:57] for holding the fort down for us always.
[42:00] And um that's it. I can just say brother
[42:04] Joe cuz there was two brother Joe's
[42:06] brother Galante and brother Joseph
[42:09] Robson. Thank you so much. And did you
[42:12] enjoy that tape this morning?
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure you did. Good to see you,
[42:16] brother Jonathan. Bless you and each of
[42:19] you. Amen. So, let's go right to the
[42:22] word. There's a scripture I like to take
[42:25] in Zechariah chapter 13 and the sisters
[42:31] in the back
[42:33] are going to help me out and I think
[42:36] they are
[42:38] going to do a good job.
[42:41] Amen. just the the the some of our
[42:44] regulars are not there,
[42:47] but um
[42:51] but I'm sure they'll do just fine. Amen.
[42:54] In Zechariah chapter 13, if you'll stand
[42:58] with me for the reading of the word,
[42:59] verses number 6 and 7,
[43:03] if you have a Skullfield Bible, it's
[43:05] page 978.
[43:08] Amen. Does that help sometime? Yeah.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll do it more if I remember.
[43:14] 978,
[43:17] book of Zechariah,
[43:19] chapter 13, verse number six. And one
[43:22] shall say unto him, what are these
[43:25] wounds in thy hands? Then he shall
[43:28] answer,
[43:29] those with which I was wounded in the
[43:32] house of my friends. Awake, oh sword,
[43:36] against my shepherd, and against the man
[43:38] that is my fellow, sayaeth the Lord of
[43:41] hosts. Smite the shepherd, and the sheep
[43:45] shall be scattered, and I will turn my
[43:48] hand upon the little ones. Amen. Jesus
[43:54] quoted this scripture in Matthew 26 and
[43:58] also in Mark chapter 14 verse 27.
[44:03] And he, not that he failed, but he uh
[44:08] did not mention, I will turn my hand
[44:11] upon the little ones. He's going to his
[44:14] crucifixion, and he tells his disciples,
[44:17] all of you will be offended at me
[44:20] tonight. All of you. Smite the shepherd
[44:23] and the sheep will scatter. He's quoting
[44:26] the scripture in Zechariah. The prophet
[44:28] of God takes this scripture and goes a
[44:31] little bit further into these little
[44:35] ones. And that's the title of the
[44:36] message tonight, the little ones. God
[44:38] bless you. You may be seated.
[44:41] This is related to the message we
[44:44] brought on a coming church also and the
[44:48] removing of a candlestick
[44:51] that that if you fail to repent that was
[44:57] the um that was the uh not condemnation
[45:01] but that was the judgment. If you fail
[45:04] to repent I will remove the candlestick.
[45:08] Revelations chapter 2, he says,
[45:11] "Remember from where you have fallen,
[45:14] repent
[45:16] or else I will remove the candlestick."
[45:19] Now, Brother Madam tells us in the
[45:21] church age's book in a couple different
[45:23] places where that that uh that
[45:27] candlestick was the leader, the
[45:31] messenger for the age. He also he also
[45:34] types it as your pastor a shepherd to
[45:37] the church that if a church fails to
[45:40] receive the word of that pastor or try
[45:44] to control him then God will move that
[45:47] pastor to a place where he would be
[45:49] received. Okay, that's those quotes I
[45:52] read for you last Sunday. How many
[45:53] remember some of those? Some of some of
[45:56] them are I have all of them here but not
[45:58] just to save a little time. But then he
[46:01] goes even further. And as I take this
[46:04] this thought on the little ones, it is
[46:07] in Matthew 25:32
[46:10] where the Lord Jesus is talking about
[46:12] the sheep and the goats and how he's
[46:16] going to separate them. And and then he
[46:19] goes and talks about how you were in
[46:22] prison, you came to see me. How you fed
[46:25] me when I was hungry. How I was thirsty,
[46:27] you gave me drink. And he says, "In so
[46:32] much," he says, 'Lord, when do we do
[46:33] these things to you? He says, "In so
[46:35] much you have done it unto the least of
[46:38] these, you have done it unto me."
[46:42] &gt;&gt; And brother Madam takes this scripture
[46:44] in several places and uses it and
[46:48] applies it to the believer.
[46:52] So I know we've heard many times where,
[46:54] "Touch not my anointed, do my prophets
[46:56] no harm." Correct? And I believe that I
[46:59] believe that speaking and and attacking
[47:03] a a pastor or leaders or even your
[47:07] parents or whatever that there's a great
[47:09] danger in that and we should have
[47:11] respects.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:14] Also that applies to believers also.
[47:19] If you offend a believer, Jesus said,
[47:23] uh, be better that a millstone be hanged
[47:26] about your neck than to offend one of
[47:29] the least of these. And he's not just
[47:31] talking about the little children that
[47:33] came up that he dedicated.
[47:36] He was talking about those um that were
[47:40] in prison, those that were hungry, those
[47:43] that needed want. It's it's a group of
[47:46] people that are if you look at the the
[47:49] different examples, they're the least
[47:51] fortunate. They're poor. They're needy.
[47:54] They're Jesus in the office of these
[47:58] people. And if you offend them, it'd be
[48:02] better that a millstone be hanged about
[48:04] your neck. Isn't that something? Think
[48:07] about that. And so he, Brother Brandham,
[48:10] says it in a couple different places,
[48:12] and I'll just go right through it. and
[48:14] in um it gives the example and the
[48:18] message fellowship
[48:22] 1960. So before I do that, let me let me
[48:26] deal with the scripture there in
[48:27] Zechariah chapter 13 and let's see what
[48:30] the prophet of God says about this
[48:32] scripture. All right,
[48:35] it's in the message
[48:39] six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to
[48:41] Daniel, paragraph number 92. Now, Jesus
[48:45] quoted that scripture. See, smite the
[48:47] shepherd and scattered the sheep. But
[48:50] notice the next paragraph. He just
[48:52] quoted that much of it. But watch what
[48:54] the next sentence, it says, the next
[48:57] part of it. And I will turn my hand to
[49:00] the little ones. What the Benjamin group
[49:04] that's coming up now? I will turn my
[49:07] hand to the little ones. Smite the
[49:11] shepherd Israel first. Israel smote the
[49:15] shepherd, scattered the sheep to all the
[49:17] world. But God said, I will turn my hand
[49:20] back to get them little ones at the last
[49:23] day.
[49:25] when when reconciliation
[49:27] for iniquity has been made.
[49:33] Amen. So the Benjamin group, who's the
[49:35] Benjamin group? That's Joseph's little
[49:38] brother. Remember him? Remember Joseph?
[49:43] Remember the testimony of the brothers
[49:46] hating him without a cause. And then
[49:49] finally, the Lord raises him up to great
[49:52] power and great position. And now he's
[49:56] asking about his little brother
[49:59] Benjamin. Brother Vanam tells us that
[50:01] this Benjamin is 144,000.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; G he brings that type and shows us. And
[50:07] he said that's this little Benjamin
[50:10] group that's growing up now. Where when
[50:14] are they coming up? Tomorrow. Are they
[50:16] in existence now?
[50:18] You better believe it.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; The Benjamin group is in existence and
[50:24] they're over over there in the homeland
[50:27] and everybody's going to start hating on
[50:30] them.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. The world will turn against
[50:34] Israel. But this little group, this
[50:37] little Benjamin group that's rising up
[50:40] now, it's an interesting thought to
[50:43] think that that is actually taking place
[50:45] supernaturally
[50:47] while the churches are fussing and
[50:49] fighting over whatever they're fighting
[50:51] over.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; And we should be maturing under the word
[50:56] of the hour.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Benjamin is growing.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; And God has a word for Benjamin. Amen.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will not forget Israel. I
[51:06] will not forget Benjamin."
[51:09] Okay, so we know we can see that
[51:11] scripture. Now this
[51:14] uh brother Brandham is taking talking
[51:17] about the least ones and he makes this
[51:21] comparison with the least one and he
[51:23] says this in fellowship 1960.
[51:28] He says, "Now notice this now how he
[51:31] comes. They come into the kitchen. What?
[51:33] To eat. You eat in the kitchen. That's
[51:36] your first. Next, you go into the room
[51:37] to talk things over. Recognition, making
[51:40] all your confession. But then when you
[51:42] go to the bedroom is when you're
[51:45] married, life is completed. It's ready.
[51:48] Then life is for the little ones and so
[51:52] forth. That's what the church is when it
[51:55] comes through justification,
[51:57] sanctification
[51:59] into the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[52:02] She's in travail. The church is then to
[52:07] bring forth little ones
[52:10] crying, "My God, my God, see Aba
[52:15] Father." That's how we come through
[52:17] these those elements in the presence of
[52:19] God for fellowship. Fellowship is only
[52:21] recognized under the blood. So should
[52:24] the church be bringing forth little
[52:26] ones?
[52:27] &gt;&gt; I just read it for you.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; The church should be bringing forth
[52:32] little ones. Now he um goes forward
[52:38] paragraph 249 in the message Revelations
[52:40] chapter 4 and he says this here, the
[52:43] soul of man is the nature of the spirit
[52:45] and the spirit dwells in the heart of
[52:48] man.
[52:49] Now, now what is the outer courts?
[52:53] That's the flesh. See, that's the first
[52:56] thing you come to the flesh. You got to
[52:59] consume that first. You got pass beyond
[53:02] the flesh. I don't feel like getting up
[53:05] and going to church. The roads are too
[53:07] slick. It's too hot. Oh, church. I don't
[53:10] know. That's the flesh. All right. Now,
[53:14] you got to consume and walk through
[53:17] that. God has to get through that. The
[53:21] next time he come, he comes into the
[53:22] soul. That's the nature. Or what will
[53:25] the Joneses say about me? Oh my, you
[53:28] know, my church will kick me out if I do
[53:30] something like that. See, but you got to
[53:32] walk through that.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Walk through that."
[53:37] &gt;&gt; And when you walk through that, then he
[53:39] goes into the heart
[53:42] &gt;&gt; and there's where he's thrown.
[53:45] That's the Holy Spirit in you. Jesus
[53:49] said, "It'd be far better that a
[53:52] millstone was hanged at your neck and
[53:54] you was drowned in the depths of the sea
[53:57] than to even offend one of these little
[54:00] ones that believe in me. Not do them any
[54:04] harm, just even to bring offense to
[54:06] them. Just upset them about something.
[54:11] Huh?
[54:12] It'd be better that you had your own
[54:14] self drowned or had never been born on
[54:17] the earth than to even bring an offense
[54:19] to one. Did he mean it?
[54:23] Could he lie,
[54:25] sir?
[54:27] &gt;&gt; How many people in here tonight, y'all
[54:29] going to help me preach or no?
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[54:34] &gt;&gt; All right.
[54:36] Did the apostle say it? No. No. Jesus
[54:40] said it. Jesus said, "If you even bring
[54:43] an offense to one of them, these little
[54:46] ones that believe in me." So you see
[54:48] now, Brother Brandon brings this, the
[54:50] Holy Spirit is enthroned in the
[54:52] individual not to just do them harm,
[54:54] just to offend them.
[54:57] You got to be careful
[55:00] talking about people, hurting people.
[55:02] You say, "Well, he's not a minister."
[55:04] Doesn't matter if he's a believer.
[55:07] Don't offend those little ones. Prophet
[55:11] brings it out right here. All right. In
[55:14] the message, why I believe it said in
[55:17] the scripture, in so much as you done
[55:18] unto the least least of my little ones,
[55:22] you've did it to me, so I am the least
[55:26] one. So, brother Vam is using this
[55:28] example and taking this scripture from
[55:31] Matthew chapter number 25
[55:37] and using it multiple ways.
[55:40] How many remember that story he was
[55:43] giving about the gentleman in the
[55:46] drugstore during the time of the
[55:48] depression? I believe it's in the
[55:50] message the paradox. He said this
[55:53] pregnant lady came in for her medication
[55:56] and he heard her his son he was training
[55:58] his son to be a drugist and the son said
[56:02] you know this is how much it's going to
[56:03] cost and this mother said we don't have
[56:06] the money. The dad said we don't have
[56:07] the money. He told him, "Well, go down
[56:10] the down the block there and stand in
[56:12] line and they'll have some uh money
[56:14] support so you can come back and get
[56:16] it." And the old um drugist was in the
[56:19] back there and he says something told
[56:22] him, "No, don't do that. Go stop them."
[56:25] So he sends his son out to stop her and
[56:27] he stop her and bring bring her back.
[56:29] Says, "Come on back, ma'am. We'll just
[56:31] give you this um this prescriptions
[56:34] because you having to stand in line for
[56:36] all of that. um that would be very hard
[56:38] for you to do. And he's telling us a
[56:40] story to brother Brandham. He says when
[56:41] he took those drugs and he went to place
[56:45] it into to her hand, he saw nail scarred
[56:48] hands.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; And then when he looked up, it was our
[56:52] Lord Jesus.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Brother Bam, do you
[56:55] believe that?" He says, "I absolutely
[56:57] believe it." He said it was a paradox.
[57:01] It was that scripture, in so much you
[57:03] have done it unto the least of these.
[57:06] So, we don't know when these moments
[57:07] arise, do we?
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[57:10] &gt;&gt; You know, the the scripture makes it
[57:12] clear. You came and saw me when I was in
[57:15] prison. You saw me. You fed me when I
[57:17] was hungry. You gave to me. He said,
[57:19] "Lord, when do we do these things?"
[57:21] Well, when you in so much you did it
[57:23] unto the least of these, you were doing
[57:26] that unto me. And then he turns to the
[57:29] goats and he says, "You did not come and
[57:32] see me. You did not come and feed me.
[57:35] you didn't come visit me when I was
[57:37] serving. Says, Lord, when do we not do
[57:40] these things to her? Says, when you
[57:41] didn't do it for these.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; That's pretty strong. Now, I want you to
[57:47] embrace that. That's pretty strong. When
[57:50] you didn't do it to these, that's the
[57:52] sin of omission.
[57:55] Omitting to do something that you should
[57:57] do. We're always talking about
[57:59] commission. What you've committed. Don't
[58:01] do this. Don't do that. What about the
[58:03] things that we are not doing? And so I
[58:06] think getting us zeroed in on what our
[58:09] great mission is and what we're supposed
[58:13] to be doing,
[58:15] then we are commissioned.
[58:19] That's not um waiting for something to
[58:22] happen. We're going out there to make
[58:24] things happen because he's called us to
[58:27] go preach the gospel. Amen. Not just
[58:31] pray for the sinner, go talk to them and
[58:34] preach the gospel to them.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Bannon brings this up also in
[58:39] the message Paradox. He was talking
[58:40] about the great St. Martin even before
[58:43] his conversion. And this is what helped
[58:46] start him on his great conversion.
[58:50] It's time of the winter. He had his uh h
[58:54] soldiers coat on. It was extreme
[58:57] temperatures. and he saw this beggar out
[59:00] on the street there and St. Martin takes
[59:03] his coat and he cuts it in half and he
[59:05] gives it to the beggar and he looked
[59:08] pretty odd. A pretty crazy looking
[59:10] soldier with half of a garment but he
[59:12] did it to help this poor man.
[59:15] That night, the Lord appeared to him in
[59:18] a dream with that coat on, half of that
[59:22] coat on, and that struck Martin, and
[59:25] that started his ministry. Knowing that
[59:28] you do this to the least.
[59:33] Now, we'll do it to people who have
[59:35] power and authority and maybe wealthy.
[59:37] We'll listen to them. We'll spend time
[59:39] with them. We'll spend time with people
[59:41] that we consider important. But these
[59:44] are the people, the poor, the needy, the
[59:46] less in the the less fortunate, these
[59:49] little opportunities that we have to
[59:53] give to the little ones. Amen.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; So those are some nice some quick
[59:59] examples that the prophet has brought to
[1:00:02] us. So, I like this thought where where
[1:00:06] where he he opens up this scripture in
[1:00:08] Zechariah 13
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; and he's talking about how little
[1:00:13] Benjamin is growing and coming up. And I
[1:00:17] believe that the result of what's going
[1:00:19] on in the message churches today and the
[1:00:22] church world today, I'm talking about
[1:00:24] 2025,
[1:00:26] you can look out there and the word, the
[1:00:29] Bible, the message will tell you why
[1:00:33] things are going the way they are.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; I believe there is an answer and it's in
[1:00:38] this message.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; You see the craziness going on. You see
[1:00:42] the dynamics change. You see, people
[1:00:44] will argue with you about things that
[1:00:46] they never would argue about. They
[1:00:49] question even the gifts of the spirit
[1:00:52] and question whether you should even go
[1:00:54] to church or not. I think the answer for
[1:00:57] all of that behavior is in the word.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; That's why it's here for us so that we
[1:01:03] can have the answer to guide us so we're
[1:01:05] not walking around blindly just letting
[1:01:07] the day go by and just like I don't know
[1:01:09] what's going to happen. Well, well, you
[1:01:10] know, whoever they vote for, then I'll
[1:01:12] be happy. And if they don't vote, then I
[1:01:14] won't be happy. No, no, no. That's not a
[1:01:15] believer. A believer is focused. He's
[1:01:18] centered. He's going somewhere. He's
[1:01:20] going in a direction. And we know
[1:01:24] there's a great persecution coming. We
[1:01:27] know they're going to get more upset and
[1:01:31] more hostile against the true church of
[1:01:35] the living God. They did it to our Lord.
[1:01:37] They did it to the shepherd. They're
[1:01:39] going to do it to the sheep, too.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Are we ready for that?
[1:01:45] Or is our worldly uh treasures more
[1:01:50] important?
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; I believe that there's a growing church
[1:01:56] growing now.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm one of the seeds of
[1:02:03] Malachi 4.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:07] Amen. I I you know that's that's my
[1:02:09] belief. You can have that belief too.
[1:02:12] But I believe that this message has
[1:02:14] changed my life.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; It has changed my life. It is the reason
[1:02:21] why I am moving the way that I move.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; What's important to me, why I'm
[1:02:28] studying, why I'm after it, what I my
[1:02:31] heart is, and what my goals are. It's
[1:02:33] because this message has come into my
[1:02:36] life
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; directly
[1:02:39] and it's having an effect on me.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; I'm better than I was five years ago.
[1:02:46] I sure hope I'm better tomorrow than I
[1:02:49] am today.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go backwards.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness, somebody?
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; I want to go forward. And when you see
[1:02:58] me in five years, I want to be better
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; than what I am today.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; That's the effects of the word of God.
[1:03:08] That's what it does. It was in its
[1:03:11] infancy, little Benjamin, but Benjamin
[1:03:13] is growing. So, there's a true church
[1:03:16] growing as well. Let's take a little bit
[1:03:20] of this. Now, now brother Vanom takes
[1:03:24] this is kind of lengthy and it really
[1:03:26] blessed my heart when brother uh Joseph
[1:03:29] from Nigeria was here and he read that
[1:03:32] uh quote out of the end time sign seed
[1:03:36] and it really blessed me. So let's take
[1:03:38] that in 1962 the prophet of God says
[1:03:41] this and he's talking about the magis.
[1:03:44] He's talking about the flying saucers
[1:03:46] that the Pentagon was dealing with in
[1:03:49] this time of the of of of our history.
[1:03:52] And paragraph 152, he says, "Listen, how
[1:03:55] many and every one of you seen the
[1:03:58] nation has been shook up just recently
[1:04:01] about signs. Did you see what this man
[1:04:04] in orbit the other day? He found things
[1:04:07] up there he never science don't even
[1:04:10] know what they are." when he passed
[1:04:12] around the Earth. Yet they've looked and
[1:04:15] looked and looked, but they didn't see
[1:04:17] them. He thought his orbit was coming to
[1:04:19] pieces. It wasn't so. His orbit was all
[1:04:23] right. Lights.
[1:04:25] Look what's been over. You've seen it in
[1:04:27] the radio. You saw it on television.
[1:04:30] It's been in the newspaper. Flying
[1:04:32] saucers everywhere. And the Pentagon let
[1:04:35] it out the other day. And about six
[1:04:37] weeks ago, it wasn't fictitious. They
[1:04:41] even showed it on television how they
[1:04:43] caught those saucers with intelligence
[1:04:46] lights that come down hanging over the
[1:04:49] Pentagon like that all over Washington
[1:04:52] DC. They caught it on radar and had
[1:04:55] pilots up there that come right in
[1:04:57] around them, surround them, move away
[1:05:01] with lightning speed and intelligence.
[1:05:05] What is it? Jesus said there will be
[1:05:07] fearful signs, sights in the heavens,
[1:05:11] men's hearts failing, fear, perplexity
[1:05:14] of times, distress between nations.
[1:05:18] Don't you see that seed time is here
[1:05:20] now? The harvest time, the things that
[1:05:24] the Bible said would come to pass. That
[1:05:27] seed that's been planted, don't you see?
[1:05:30] It has taken life and living.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; That's what's the matter.
[1:05:36] Now just one thing more listen before
[1:05:38] now listen close don't fail to find this
[1:05:42] now before the first coming of Jesus the
[1:05:46] astronomers of India magis I missionared
[1:05:50] in India talked with the magi about this
[1:05:52] they were watching they were astronomers
[1:05:55] they were watching the heavenly bodies
[1:05:58] and they say God always declares himself
[1:06:00] in the heavenly body before he does in
[1:06:03] the earth before he does anything. And
[1:06:06] they said, "Why when this three wise men
[1:06:09] went to worship the king that was to
[1:06:11] rule the earth, a baby king, they
[1:06:14] followed a star." Your scripture says,
[1:06:17] he said, "But frankly, there was three
[1:06:20] stars came together and made this one
[1:06:23] star." And they say that the Christian
[1:06:27] astronomer that I was talking to or
[1:06:29] magi, he said that means that there were
[1:06:32] three races of people that this man died
[1:06:35] for. The only three races there is Ham,
[1:06:38] Sham, and Jeff's people. When his gospel
[1:06:42] has been preached to Ham, Sham, and
[1:06:44] Jeff's people, they come together in his
[1:06:47] gospel, then the return will be that's
[1:06:50] all right if he wants to believe that.
[1:06:52] Three is a number of perfection. But
[1:06:54] what do I believe that the three was?
[1:06:57] What do we believe? It was a three of
[1:07:00] perfection, showing that the Trinity of
[1:07:03] God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost was
[1:07:06] made manifest in a man, Jesus Christ.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; The one perfect man. All other men had
[1:07:14] failed. Everything else had died. But
[1:07:17] here come a man that couldn't die.
[1:07:19] Perfection that even death couldn't kill
[1:07:22] him. rose up again. Three is the number
[1:07:26] of perfection. We all know that three is
[1:07:29] God's number in his numerology. God is
[1:07:32] known by his number. Three is
[1:07:34] perfection. Seven is worship. 24 is
[1:07:38] worship. 40 is temptation. 50 is
[1:07:40] Pentecost. Jubilee, see forth. All his
[1:07:45] numbers, his numerals of God is
[1:07:47] perfected in perfection. Now, three is a
[1:07:51] number of perfection. Just before
[1:07:54] skip down to ver paragraph 159. Now, now
[1:07:57] what's happened? We see a roar in the
[1:08:00] paper across the television out across
[1:08:02] the nations where five stars just fell
[1:08:05] in line with the world. What's five? A
[1:08:09] number of grace. Every time those stars
[1:08:12] come, then something happens on earth.
[1:08:14] What taking place? Five stars fell in.
[1:08:19] What was it? introducing what since then
[1:08:23] you just look what's taking place
[1:08:26] Germany almost washed off the map some
[1:08:28] of the mag said that the world would
[1:08:30] burst like a watermelon every
[1:08:33] distressful thing that's prophesied by
[1:08:36] them for the last days looks what h look
[1:08:39] what h look what's taking place England
[1:08:43] the other day a storm that blowed away
[1:08:45] 70,000 houses one day disasters
[1:08:49] everywhere There California, Los Angeles
[1:08:52] like to wash into the ocean. What is it?
[1:08:55] Beginning of sorrows. Earthquakes has
[1:08:58] picked up everywhere. Why is it five
[1:09:01] stars come in line? Grace, God's grace.
[1:09:06] What's happened?
[1:09:09] An infant church. Hallelujah.
[1:09:12] A bride. Infancy that the power of God
[1:09:16] has be to fall on her. She is taking
[1:09:20] form a bride for this bridegroom.
[1:09:24] That three stars meant his perfection of
[1:09:28] the heavenly father of the trinity
[1:09:30] becoming one on earth among us. God's
[1:09:34] offices becoming one office. What
[1:09:38] happened now? It's the church of the
[1:09:40] living God coming together under the
[1:09:42] word of God. And the astronomic
[1:09:45] astronomic heaven is announcing her
[1:09:48] approach.
[1:09:50] Amen.
[1:09:52] Might not believe that, but it's the
[1:09:54] word just the same. Yes, sir. Who
[1:09:58] controls the heavens?
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Who set the stars and the lights and
[1:10:04] their patterns? Who who who has them
[1:10:07] orbiting the way that they do? You know,
[1:10:10] the June sun is the June skies is not
[1:10:13] the same as the November skies. They're
[1:10:16] always reading. It's always moving. How
[1:10:19] well I understood more of that when
[1:10:22] Sharon and I took this tour up on Mount
[1:10:24] Lemon. Dubai gave us a tour, got us a
[1:10:27] tour up there. Very interesting. One of
[1:10:29] the guys was talking and he was I asked
[1:10:31] him about that star with the magis. He
[1:10:33] says, "Yeah, that was a tremendous
[1:10:35] star." And I says, "You know what I'm
[1:10:37] taught is that those there were three
[1:10:39] stars." He says, "Yes." I says, "Those
[1:10:41] three stars became one star, Father,
[1:10:44] Son, and Holy Ghost, the Lord Jesus." He
[1:10:46] said, "Wow, I never saw that." I says,
[1:10:48] "Yeah, I just came up with that myself."
[1:10:53] He says, "Man, I never I never thought
[1:10:54] of that. This guy's searches the
[1:10:56] heavens. He searches the skies." Just a
[1:10:59] little seventh grader gave me that
[1:11:01] information.
[1:11:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:06] Woo my what's happening in the closing.
[1:11:10] I might say this friends, the church is
[1:11:12] coming forth. This is paragraph 162. God
[1:11:16] is going to have a church without spot
[1:11:20] or wrinkle. Now, do you believe that?
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:24] You know that scripture, that prophecy
[1:11:26] that I've been reading out of communion
[1:11:29] that brother Balam says God's going to
[1:11:31] dwell with his people and that church is
[1:11:34] coming up the road. You just remember
[1:11:36] that. That's prophecy to me. I'm hanging
[1:11:39] on to that. I'm believing that. I
[1:11:41] believe that as the prophet told us that
[1:11:45] Ramsy's was growing
[1:11:48] at the same time that Moses was growing.
[1:11:53] When Ramsy's was growing down in Egypt,
[1:11:56] his political power to put pressure on
[1:11:59] the Hebrews and bring a great and
[1:12:02] tremendous crisis to them. God was
[1:12:05] dealing with Moses out in the desert,
[1:12:07] too. And as this world has lost its
[1:12:10] mind,
[1:12:12] they're crazy.
[1:12:14] They have no sense. the arguments, it
[1:12:18] just doesn't make any, it has no
[1:12:21] foundation to it at all.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about college degrees
[1:12:27] on the college campuses, great minds,
[1:12:30] they have lost it,
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; and yet they're advancing in science all
[1:12:34] the time. They're constantly making
[1:12:37] things better and faster and more
[1:12:40] tremendous.
[1:12:42] And the church is growing, too.
[1:12:45] [Music]
[1:12:47] And when I said the church, I'm talking
[1:12:48] about a person.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about individuals.
[1:12:53] I believe it's growing too. So the
[1:12:57] prophet brings in this day that shall
[1:13:00] come that there will never neither be
[1:13:03] day nor night. It'll be the evening
[1:13:06] time. It'll say and it says in the
[1:13:10] prophecy that that there shall be light
[1:13:12] in the evening time. We're still in the
[1:13:15] evening time. The prophet is not here
[1:13:19] with us that we can go and have a
[1:13:21] private interview with him. And many of
[1:13:24] the witnesses that walk with him,
[1:13:26] they're not here either. Those
[1:13:28] candlesticks have been removed from us.
[1:13:32] And the great leaders and the great
[1:13:34] teachers and the preachers that have
[1:13:36] gone on before us, they're being taken
[1:13:38] from us one by one.
[1:13:41] But there's coming a church that's going
[1:13:44] to take every word of God. And God is
[1:13:48] going to have a church without spot,
[1:13:51] blemish, or wrinkle. All that God was,
[1:13:54] he poured into Christ. All that Christ
[1:13:57] was, what did he do? He poured it into
[1:14:00] the church.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Didn't die in 65 or 77 or 84 or 2020. It
[1:14:10] didn't die. The church is still growing.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; It's more powerful to me than it's ever
[1:14:16] been.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Others are leaving. Some of us are going
[1:14:20] deeper into it.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Some of us are more encouraged than ever
[1:14:24] before.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Who am I talking to tonight?
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Who's on fire tonight?
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; How many know that this word is true?
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; How many know that this is the rapturing
[1:14:36] grace? is right here.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not discouraged. I'm encouraged.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not getting ready to quit. I'm
[1:14:46] trying to start again.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to remember what the Lord has
[1:14:50] done for me.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; I was lost. I was indifferent. I was
[1:14:54] bound. I couldn't help myself. But a
[1:14:58] power came down from heaven and changed
[1:15:01] my life.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; That's the reason I'm here today.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:06] [Music]
[1:15:08] Nobody didn't paint a picture. Nobody
[1:15:10] sent me to a seminar,
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; but I repented of my sins.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost got a hold of me
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; and did for me what I could never do for
[1:15:21] myself. And that same power is still
[1:15:25] here today.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; It's in the word of God. Amen.
[1:15:30] Glory.
[1:15:31] Glory.
[1:15:33] So, let's talk to you little ones.
[1:15:36] You little ones, huh? That didn't get to
[1:15:40] get into Brother Banner's meetings.
[1:15:42] Wouldn't you love to be there?
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; But why you didn't go?
[1:15:49] Why didn't you go?
[1:15:52] You couldn't go. If you was there, you
[1:15:55] would have went, right? But you're here
[1:15:57] now. So, what you going to do?
[1:16:00] Oh my.
[1:16:03] You're going to take this word here and
[1:16:06] it's going to explode in you and the
[1:16:10] world can't stop it.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; You don't have to ask permission to
[1:16:16] praise the Lord.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; You don't have to ask permission to say
[1:16:20] amen to God's word. Once that seed drops
[1:16:24] into a fertile heart, it's got to come
[1:16:28] forth. It must come forth.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; And that's what's happening. That's
[1:16:34] what's happening to us.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm kind of pregnant."
[1:16:44] No, no, no, no, no. You got to have that
[1:16:46] baby, sis.
[1:16:50] You got to have You got to have birth.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; It's already started.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Can't go back now, brother. to go back
[1:16:58] and do what? Go back where?
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Ain't nothing going on out there. It's
[1:17:03] crazy foolishness. They lost their mind.
[1:17:06] Nothing is sane except what's in the
[1:17:09] word of the Lord.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; I thank God I'm on the road. I believe
[1:17:13] I'm on the road and we're coming
[1:17:16] forward. Now hear what brother Brandham
[1:17:19] says in the anointed ones at the end
[1:17:20] time 1965. I'll close at these last two
[1:17:24] or three quotes.
[1:17:26] He says paragraph 45, now the sun comes
[1:17:29] across and ripens the grain. Now it
[1:17:32] cannot ripen it all at once. As it goes
[1:17:36] on maturing,
[1:17:38] it constantly ripens until it comes to a
[1:17:43] full ear.
[1:17:46] So is it today with the church. It
[1:17:49] started in its infancy back in the dark
[1:17:52] ages where it was under the ground. It's
[1:17:55] grown now into maturity
[1:17:58] and we can see it perfectly how that God
[1:18:01] through nature always. You cannot
[1:18:05] disturb nature. That's what's the matter
[1:18:08] today. We're flying bombs out there in
[1:18:11] that ocean, breaking it, busting it
[1:18:13] around with atomic bombs. You're just
[1:18:15] breaking more of that dirt off all the
[1:18:18] time, dropping into it. You cut down the
[1:18:21] trees, storms will take you. Dam up the
[1:18:25] river, it'll overflow. You've got to
[1:18:28] find God's way of doing things
[1:18:31] and stay in it.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; We've denominated people in the
[1:18:36] churches, organizations. Look what we
[1:18:38] got. Stay in God's provided way of it.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; How many wants to do that tonight? Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Stay in God's provided way of it.
[1:18:51] Here the prophet said in the third
[1:18:53] Exodus,
[1:18:54] what's this new pope saying? Four things
[1:18:57] that he wants. One of them is to unite
[1:18:59] the Protestant and the Catholic
[1:19:01] together. To any intellectual person,
[1:19:04] that's the thing to do. But according to
[1:19:07] the Bible,
[1:19:09] it's the wrong thing to do.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said they would do that.
[1:19:14] Let's go a little further. At this time,
[1:19:17] Ramsy's in Egypt was growing. His power
[1:19:20] is growing. The natural man Ramsy's was
[1:19:24] growing.
[1:19:25] The natural man, the antichrist, is
[1:19:27] growing now through politics. He's
[1:19:31] already got to the White House. In
[1:19:34] religion, he's got all the people so
[1:19:36] scrupled up to actually they'll fall
[1:19:38] right for it. That's right. and the
[1:19:41] denominational leaders. Practically
[1:19:43] every church that there is in the nation
[1:19:45] is already in the confederation of
[1:19:47] churches.
[1:19:49] Ramsy's is growing and they're all
[1:19:52] uniting together. And that's why that's
[1:19:55] what they'll that's what they'll have.
[1:19:56] And what does it do? It makes a power a
[1:19:59] beast just like the first one. Then
[1:20:02] there's a persecution coming upon all
[1:20:05] those who won't unite with it and a
[1:20:09] boycott. Somebody say boycott.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; It'll be too late then.
[1:20:15] You've already took the mark. That's
[1:20:17] right.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Don't say I'll do it then. You better do
[1:20:20] it now.
[1:20:23] Ramsy's was growing. But remember, while
[1:20:26] Ramsy's was growing into power in Egypt,
[1:20:29] God had Moses in the wilderness. He was
[1:20:33] growing too.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Ramsy's had a political system. God had
[1:20:37] a spiritual system
[1:20:40] under a prophet,
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; ready to come down to speak to the
[1:20:45] people. They're both growing again.
[1:20:48] It'll be a showdown one of these days.
[1:20:52] The time ain't far off when there will
[1:20:55] come a showdown.
[1:20:57] As the natural, as the scripture says,
[1:21:00] the natural type, the spiritual, you
[1:21:02] can't get away from it. There it is.
[1:21:04] It's right before your eyes. It's truth.
[1:21:07] Look at the church now calling out,
[1:21:09] coming into power, the Holy Spirit
[1:21:12] coming down, the mysteries of God being
[1:21:14] revealed, set in order. And right here,
[1:21:18] she's already in the White House. And
[1:21:21] the church is pulling itself together.
[1:21:24] Amen. Not a denomination out of the
[1:21:27] bondage of iniquities, away from the
[1:21:29] Amorites of people. That's free.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Are you free tonight?
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; How many love the Lord?
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Are you growing?
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Ramsy's is growing. The political system
[1:21:44] is growing. this gentleman that was
[1:21:47] killed and shot on the college campus
[1:21:50] and people online rejoiced behind that.
[1:21:54] They loved it. They laughed at it. They
[1:21:56] made jokes about it.
[1:21:58] It just shows you the the where the
[1:22:01] heart of the people are. Just hard and
[1:22:05] harsh.
[1:22:07] You don't want that hard harsh spirit to
[1:22:09] come on you.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; You want a heart of flesh where you know
[1:22:12] how to repent.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember the the if you fail to
[1:22:16] repent, I'll remove the candlestick.
[1:22:18] Brother Vanam says that the light that
[1:22:19] you have will turn into darkness if you
[1:22:22] don't. You notice people sitting in
[1:22:23] churches holding grudges against one
[1:22:25] another like little baby fouryear-old,
[1:22:28] 5-year-old little crimes, nursery
[1:22:31] crimes.
[1:22:32] We're supposed to be growing in the
[1:22:34] power of the spirit.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be supposed to be
[1:22:37] mature sons and daughters of God.
[1:22:40] We're supposed to be speaking to the
[1:22:43] circumstance,
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; speaking to the storm,
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; and still congregations
[1:22:52] that will not repent.
[1:22:55] They remove the candlestick.
[1:22:57] They remove the messenger from their
[1:23:01] messages, from their ministries.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; They're disassociating him,
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; from their ministries.
[1:23:09] they're doing. They want to draw more
[1:23:12] the the people out there, the great
[1:23:14] greater crowds, and don't want to offend
[1:23:16] anybody.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Like, brother Brandham came on his own.
[1:23:20] Like, that was his own personal choice
[1:23:22] to come.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; God sent brother Brandham.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; God sent him so he wouldn't smite the
[1:23:30] earth with a curse.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; God sent Elijah to save you. Amen.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Be like you being ashamed of your mama
[1:23:40] and your daddy.
[1:23:42] Shame on a ministry. Ashamed of this
[1:23:46] messenger.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; You're ashamed of Apostle Paul.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Shamed of Moses. Ashamed of who told you
[1:23:53] how to uh cross the farmer's fence?
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Brother Bam told us how to
[1:23:59] cross a farmer's fence. Huh? Yes, sir.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Did he?
[1:24:05] You listen to enough tapes, he'll teach
[1:24:06] you. He'll show you. But they removed
[1:24:10] this candlestick. They removed him and
[1:24:12] their light has turned into darkness.
[1:24:16] And that's that's what's going on right
[1:24:18] now. This is I have to read the message.
[1:24:19] I have to say, "Okay, speak to me.
[1:24:21] What's going on here?" I I can't just go
[1:24:23] along with the crowd. I can't say,
[1:24:25] "Well, this is just normal." Because
[1:24:26] it's not normal.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; I've never seen this before. I've never
[1:24:30] seen the dynamics that's going on. So, I
[1:24:32] pray. I say, "Lord, what's going on
[1:24:34] here? What is where are we at? Then you
[1:24:36] pick up the message. Bam. There's the
[1:24:40] answer.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; They have removed the Did I wake y'all
[1:24:44] up?
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Well, at least I didn't do what George
[1:24:47] did.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; I need to get me a little little thing
[1:24:56] like from Brother George and do that.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Y'all excuse me. All right.
[1:25:04] But when something explodes off of your
[1:25:07] Bible, out of the message, and it gives
[1:25:10] you the answer, oh, that's what's going
[1:25:12] on. I see what's going on now.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; They've removed the candlestick and the
[1:25:17] church ages. Brother Vanam says, then
[1:25:19] God will remove its faithful messenger
[1:25:22] and the faithful shepherds, and he'll
[1:25:24] leave them to theirelves.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; It's a quote.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what's going on. And the
[1:25:30] ones that did have light, it turned into
[1:25:33] darkness.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; They started with taking the pictures
[1:25:38] out and stop quoting from him. What they
[1:25:40] going to do next? What they going to do
[1:25:41] next?
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; What they going to do next? Cuz they're
[1:25:44] not done.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; But we have repented, haven't we?
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; And so the Lord doesn't remove that
[1:25:54] light from us because our heart stays
[1:25:58] repented. And with a repented heart, the
[1:26:00] Lord will not turn away. He will speak
[1:26:02] to you if your heart is right. I believe
[1:26:07] that. I believe it's a wicked hour. I
[1:26:09] believe it's a dark hour. I believe it's
[1:26:12] not an hour that I can figure it out.
[1:26:14] But I am led, sons and daughters of God
[1:26:17] are led by the spirit of God. And the
[1:26:19] answers are right here for us.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; This is what's taking place.
[1:26:26] Ramsy's is growing and so is the church.
[1:26:28] The power of God is growing.
[1:26:32] Can I take one more quotation
[1:26:34] in the seven church ages? The messenger
[1:26:36] says this here.
[1:26:39] I'm sorry, third Exodus. Let me finish
[1:26:41] that quote. Paragraph 150. But remember,
[1:26:43] while Ramsy's was growing in the power
[1:26:45] in Egypt, God had Moses in the
[1:26:48] wilderness. He was growing too. Ramsy's
[1:26:51] had a political system. God had a
[1:26:53] spiritual system under a prophet ready
[1:26:56] to come down to speak to the people.
[1:26:59] They're both growing again.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; It'll be a showdown one of these days.
[1:27:05] That time ain't far off when there will
[1:27:08] come a showdown.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; As the scripture says, the natural
[1:27:14] types, the spiritual, what's a showdown?
[1:27:16] That's like that's like going through
[1:27:19] the final four and then the last two
[1:27:22] teams are standing after the playoffs.
[1:27:26] All the little mediocre
[1:27:29] challenges and tests have been well
[1:27:32] done. This is the Super Bowl.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; this is two champions in the 12th round.
[1:27:41] And that 10th, 11th, and 12th round is
[1:27:44] called the championship rounds.
[1:27:47] This is where we are at right now. This
[1:27:50] is the 11th hour showing up. 11th hour
[1:27:54] worker.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; This is that little bride member that
[1:27:58] heard the word and now it's coming to
[1:28:00] her senses.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; This is that boy. This is that girl.
[1:28:04] This is that pastor. This is that church
[1:28:06] that woke up and said, "You know what?
[1:28:09] God have mercy on me. Please, Lord,
[1:28:14] don't leave me. Fill me with the power
[1:28:18] of the Holy Ghost for the rapture and
[1:28:21] the great power that's coming.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Wake up, somebody.
[1:28:28] Wake up. Shalom. Wake up my sister. Wake
[1:28:32] up my brother. This is what that is.
[1:28:36] In
[1:28:38] exposition of the seven church ages, the
[1:28:40] messenger says this here. It's written
[1:28:42] like this.
[1:28:44] And yet it is the harvest time. Then
[1:28:48] there must come upon the scene in this
[1:28:51] age those who will bring the wheat and
[1:28:54] tears to maturity.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:29:00] The tears are already maturing very fast
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; under what? Corrupt teachers
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; who turn the people from what?
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Word.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; What word are we talking about? The
[1:29:15] Baptist word,
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; the Pentecostal word that turn them from
[1:29:20] the word. The word of this day. They
[1:29:22] turn them from the word and they're
[1:29:24] maturing very fast
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; under corrupt teachers.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; These are the tears. I didn't write it.
[1:29:31] This is the prophet said it.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Tears are already maturing very fast
[1:29:36] under corrupt teachers who turn the
[1:29:38] people from the word. But the wheat also
[1:29:41] must mature. And to her God is sending
[1:29:46] the prophet messenger
[1:29:49] with the vindicated ministry that he
[1:29:52] might be accepted by the elect.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; They will hear him as the first church
[1:29:59] heard Paul and she will mature in the
[1:30:02] word until becoming a word bride. Amen.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; The mighty works will be found in her
[1:30:08] that are always attended upon the pure
[1:30:11] word and faith. Can you say, "Praise the
[1:30:15] Lord?"
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Is that you?
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Two groups maturing here.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; There's a Ramsay group and the Moses
[1:30:22] group. There's the tear group and the
[1:30:25] wheat group. There's the false group and
[1:30:28] there's a true vine. and they're
[1:30:31] maturing under the prophet
[1:30:34] messenger.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; We are those little ones, aren't we?
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; We're the 11th hour worker.
[1:30:43] We are the bride that was in its infancy
[1:30:48] being born that he talked about. You
[1:30:51] know, the bride is going to have a
[1:30:53] revival.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; There will be a bride revival. I believe
[1:30:56] that. I believe that. I believe that. I
[1:30:58] believe that. I'd rather believe that
[1:31:00] than believe the other options you might
[1:31:03] have out there.
[1:31:07] We need a revival, don't we?
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Some people don't want a revival. You
[1:31:12] know who don't want a revival?
[1:31:14] The devil. That's
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; The devil wants you to stay exactly the
[1:31:20] way you are.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Like you already got it. You're already
[1:31:23] in. You heard that tape already. Yeah,
[1:31:24] you preached that already. Yeah, we
[1:31:25] heard that already. A tape again.
[1:31:30] That's the carnality.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; But the believer come in looking for a
[1:31:34] amen moment. Where can I say amen?
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Looking for a minute to jump off.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Run the owls.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all ain't ran the owl in a
[1:31:46] long time.
[1:31:49] Like maybe ever.
[1:31:52] We've kept these aisles nice and wide so
[1:31:54] you can run them. All right.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Don't run them because I said run them.
[1:31:59] You run them when your fire gets lit.
[1:32:02] And God bless you. I know you're running
[1:32:04] the owls in your spirit.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; All right. We want to see you run them
[1:32:11] by living a life that's worthy of the
[1:32:13] gospel. Amen. So, God bless you richly.
[1:32:16] The bride is growing and and she's
[1:32:20] growing even right now. I believe that
[1:32:23] with all all my heart. I believe that
[1:32:25] this prophecy has to be fulfilled that
[1:32:28] God's going to dwell with his people.
[1:32:30] And so that's our desire. Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let us pray.
[1:32:38] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[1:32:40] word tonight.
[1:32:41] We ask your blessings upon the people in
[1:32:44] the word, those that heard the word, the
[1:32:47] saints
[1:32:48] that maybe couldn't be here tonight. I
[1:32:51] pray you'll bless them,
[1:32:53] oh God, that they would begin to mature
[1:32:58] under the prophet messenger
[1:33:02] that you sent in this hour.
[1:33:05] It's not me promoting anything. It's
[1:33:08] what you did. Behold, I send unto you. I
[1:33:12] send you. I, God, sent you,
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet.
[1:33:19] Lord, I receive that. I just humbly I
[1:33:22] receive it and and and I want to be
[1:33:24] humble with it, Lord. I want to take it
[1:33:26] and just really embrace it with all of
[1:33:29] my heart. Grant it, Lord. Make it real
[1:33:33] to me. Stir it up in my spirit once
[1:33:37] again, Lord. Take a stand. See politics.
[1:33:42] This great pope that came out of
[1:33:44] America.
[1:33:46] Wow. What a prophecy. never knew that
[1:33:49] before. Never heard of such a thing. But
[1:33:52] we have been warned.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; And we've seen these things coming to
[1:33:56] pass and science and its progress.
[1:34:00] The the vehicles that are driving
[1:34:03] themselves
[1:34:04] and all of the science, how it's
[1:34:06] progressed
[1:34:08] as told to us through prophecy.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; But the church is growing also.
[1:34:16] and she's growing right now. And that
[1:34:19] church is one or two, few here, a few
[1:34:23] there. A as your grace would allow us to
[1:34:26] grow. Lord, may I stand in that position
[1:34:31] as a true bride member that heard the
[1:34:34] call, that heard the voice that's coming
[1:34:37] under this great ministry. Lord, forgive
[1:34:41] us of our sins and may we repent where
[1:34:44] we have fallen short. of this grace,
[1:34:47] Lord. Lord, put it in our hearts to be a
[1:34:51] witness of these things
[1:34:53] to tell somebody about your salvation,
[1:34:58] your grace, your mercy.
[1:35:01] Grant it, Lord Jesus. We give you the
[1:35:04] praise, all the glory, all the honor in
[1:35:07] Jesus name.
[1:35:10] Amen.
[1:35:12] Amen. God bless you.
[1:35:16] power.
[1:35:19] The name of the Lord
[1:35:24] though save and red brother Scott
[1:35:29] shall not be defeated.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints.
[1:35:38] [Music]
[1:35:43] We've got the power
[1:35:48] in the name of Jesus.
[1:35:53] We've got the power
[1:35:58] in the name of the Lord.
[1:36:03] Though Satan raes,
[1:36:08] I will not be defeated.
[1:36:12] We've got the power
[1:36:17] in the name of the Lord.
[1:36:21] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[1:36:23] praise for that this season. Amen. If
[1:36:26] you'll stand with me. I try to uh take
[1:36:30] from the service and get some ideas for
[1:36:32] songs for afterwards when he calls up.
[1:36:34] And the only thing kept sticking was
[1:36:36] this old world can never hold me.
[1:36:39] This old world
[1:36:42] can never hold me
[1:36:46] anymore.
[1:36:49] and I'll be gone.
[1:36:52] For I made
[1:36:55] my conse
[1:36:56] ation
[1:36:59] and I have
[1:37:02] garments on.
[1:37:05] This old world
[1:37:08] can never hold me
[1:37:12] anymore.
[1:37:14] And I'll be gone
[1:37:18] for I made
[1:37:21] my consecration
[1:37:25] and I have my wedding garments on this
[1:37:29] old world. know this old world
[1:37:34] can never hold me
[1:37:38] anymore.
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:37:40] And I'll be gone
[1:37:44] for I may
[1:37:47] consecration
[1:37:50] and I have my wedding garment on.
[1:37:56] And this world is not my home. I'm just
[1:38:00] a passing crew. My treasures are laid up
[1:38:06] somewhere beyond the blue. The angels
[1:38:10] beckoning me from heaven's open floor.
[1:38:15] And I can't feel at home in this world
[1:38:19] anymore.
[1:38:21] Oh Lord, you know I have no brain like
[1:38:26] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[1:38:31] what will I do? The angels begging me
[1:38:37] from heaven's open door. And I can't
[1:38:41] feel at home in this world anymore.
[1:38:46] Well, they're all expecting me. And
[1:38:50] that's one thing I know.
[1:38:53] I fixed it up with Jesus so many years
[1:38:57] ago.
[1:38:59] I know he'll see me through. Though I am
[1:39:03] weeping
[1:39:05] and I can feel at home in this world
[1:39:09] into the last verse, the sobering glory
[1:39:13] land we will live eternally.
[1:39:17] The saints on every hand are shouting
[1:39:22] victory.
[1:39:24] The song of sweetest praise bring back
[1:39:27] from heaven shore. And I can't feel at
[1:39:32] home in this world anymore.
[1:39:36] Oh Lord, you know I have no like you.
[1:39:45] Lord, what will I do? The angels
[1:39:49] beckoning me from heaven's open door.
[1:39:54] And I can't feel at home in this world
[1:39:59] anymore.
[1:40:00] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[1:40:06] you.
[1:40:07] Heaven's not my home. Then Lord, what
[1:40:11] will I do?
[1:40:14] Brother Caleb, would you come and
[1:40:15] dismiss tonight?
[1:40:20] Still at home in this world anymore.
[1:40:25] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[1:40:30] you. My treasures are laid up somewhere
[1:40:36] beyond the blue.
[1:40:39] Angels beckon me from heaven's open
[1:40:44] door. And I can't feel at home in this
[1:40:49] world anymore.
[1:40:51] Just
[1:40:53] glory land. will live eternally.
[1:40:58] The saints on every man

[1:41:05] the song of sweetest praise drip from
[1:41:09] heaven sure and I can't feel at home in

[1:44:24] me more one last time.
