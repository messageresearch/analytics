this into your hands now in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord Saints so good to be in the house of the Lord and presence of the Lord we just greet you in the lovely name of our Lord and savior the Lord Jesus Christ amen we'd like to go right into the word we'll stand and take our Bibles I'd like to welcome our visitors any visitors we greet to feel and we just want more of that in our lives amen amen so we are going to take the scripture in Exodus chapter what I like to do with this scripture is today Exodus 23 from verse number 20. to save a little time I would just take a couple of verses there and then we'll go to Saint John chapter 6. behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thy enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries amen Saint John chapter 6. verse 67 very familiar portion of scripture is Jesus is asking his disciples a question then said Jesus unto the twelve will you also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God Jesus answered them have not I chose you 12 and one of you is the devil he spake of Judas is Carrot the son of Simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve will you also go away that's the title of the message this morning Jesus asked this question to his disciples will you also go away let us pray one more time Father in heaven we thank you for the words that we just read I pray that you're moving my thoughts from anything contrary to you and may you take full control of the service this morning Lord let the Holy Spirit take full control and meet our needs we pray let it the words be seasoned with salt and Grace and with your mercy and that's what we need Lord we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated just a little bit of an announcement tonight brother Bob Willard will be with us to minister there in um in Mesa the uh um the Tabernacle there The Landmark Christian fellowship and he's here in the city this morning and I pulled him to come and be with us tonight so we're looking forward to that amen will you also go away now this particular message and I know I certainly agreed any visitors here I see some people that I maybe never saw before maybe I'm not real familiar with them but God bless you and we certainly trust that something will be said that will bless you and help you in your Christian Journey that's the motive that's our intentions but this scripture here where our lord Jesus is asking his disciples the question to get the full context of what's going on you got to go to verse number one of Saint John chapter 6. these are two days that of of events taking place here and Jesus ask a question first there is a great multitude following him and this multitude is following him because of the Miracles and of the healing uh people follow things for a reason there's something a human attraction that causes you to follow another group or another man or a woman or whatever it may be and this large group of people we later find out it was over 5 000 people that was coming to his ministry and for the local church here our church here just to say a few things about you know the third pool we're going to talk a little bit about that here this morning just for a few moments and I think we could see the first second and third pool right here in Saint John chapter 6. what are these pools for you that don't know the first pool as brother Branham describes and his ministry was a sign in his hand this is where the Lord the angel of the Lord came to him and told him about these Ministries that were given to him to go to the people he would take his left hand showing that it was closest to his heart and he would take the right hand of the patient and be able to detect diseases in their life the patient's right hand showing that they had confidence and they believed him the second poll was he had the uh the prophesying or the ability to determine the secrets of the heart known as discernment able to pick up pick up those um uh the the you know the angel told them if you'll be sincere the secrets in the heart the third pool was the spoken word or the opening of the word and even God using him in a great and tremendous signs wonders Miracle creation and so forth a control of Nature and those things these three fools will call them healing and then prophesying one he starts with a multitude of people coming to him and the reason they came to him was for the Miracles in healing and um the people the the miracles signs wonders in healing will resonate to any man any black man any white man any poor man any rich man this is debate this is human connection this is where we connect as human beings I need help and you can help me and there's a connection there and so this caused this great crowd this great multitude of people to follow Jesus because of the Miracles the signs and wonders and remember all of these attributes of healing prophesying the opening of the word or the mystery of the word being revealed which is the highest order all of those things we've seen that displayed throughout the Bible they're all throughout the Bible there's nothing new but when brother Branham coins it first pull second pull in third pool he was directly pointing it to the ministry that the Lord had given him and others that have gone on before him amen and so when we say the first pull or the second pool or the third pool that's a it's a lot that goes into that and to be like if you ask me whether Israel what is the Holy Ghost well that's a very big uh that's a very big conversation to have because the Holy Ghost encompasses the adoption it encompasses justification so justification a man could still be smoking cigarettes living in the world and the Holy Ghost can still be working with him and then a man has the adoption or the placing in his life God is still working with him with the same Holy Ghost that's quite a range a man preaching In a Pulpit and a man smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol or whatever but it's still the working of the Holy Ghost so the point is there's a lot that goes into it we say the Holy Ghost we're talk what holy ghosts are we talking about the realm on the flesh or the realm and the soul is it the Holy Ghost Upon A True Believer is it the Holy Ghost throughout the ages and so there's a a lot that goes with it just like if you say a car or what kind of a car four-cylinder six-cylinder gas diesel sports car or you know a soccer mom's car what kind of car are we talking about because we know they're not all the same they all have different purposes right and when you say a man even talking about a man what kind of man are you talking about a saved man an old man a young man is he 30 is he 60 what kind of man are we talking about so when we talk about the third pool or we talk about the Holy Ghost it's a very big subject to cover and there's a lot that goes to it and it's only going to be interesting to you when you can see yourself in it amen and we all have a part in it amen amen all right so this uh great testimony here in day one with our lord Jesus he tests Philip with the question the Bible says that he knew all along what was going to take place he sees this large crowd of people coming to him and he asked Philip the question where shall we buy bread and food for all of these people now he knows they ain't got enough money to buy it he knows he can't uh uh so there's no place to buy the food but he'll pose a question you have to catch what he's trying to do and what he's trying to say and so he asked this question he sees a great company there he's setting it up because he knew what he was going to do and then another disciple gets involved and that's Andrew and he he somehow finds a little boy with two with two small fishes and five barley loaves he just finds him he's not like the Lord didn't say hey pick that little boy out no he let them he poses the question and then now the the dynamic of how we're going to feed all these people they're coming out here to hear you how are we going to do all of this and the Lord is setting it up he's setting up a blessing and I think he might be setting one up for you too it's usually surrounded around some question in your life some direction some point of reference in your life where you are today let me say this here in a hundred years none of us will be here a hundred years from today everybody's sitting in here will not be here if time just goes on can I get a witness we all got an appointment to leave from here and and that's really the reality is how much time do I have before I leave from here now you have plans in your life I do you do we all have plans in our life of what we're going to do tomorrow but we don't know what tomorrow holds and things can change in just a moment's time here it is day one and the multitudes are coming to him he needs an answer to feed all of these people he asked him a question a little boy just happens to bring a couple fish a couple breads for a sandwich Maybe looked like it was just enough for him somehow I like this boy fish sandwich so they grabbed this young boy out of the crowd he's like what did I do wrong now what you got in that lunch pail young man well don't you don't even want to know my name we don't need to know your name what you got in that lunch Bell give me your lunch man they take the boys lunch from him in his hands it was just a meal maybe his mom and dad gave to him I think one place brother Madam said he skipped school he he probably was thought he was in trouble but the Lord the the disciples take his lunch from him and of the Lord Jesus Christ jesus takes this bread and his fish and he tells his disciples to go order the people to sit down put them all in order five thousand of them sediment company he gives thanks over the bread he gives thanks over the fish and he begins to give it to his disciples so he's over here he blessed it and he just turned around give us to the disciples and the disciples run and give it to the people and he's doing this for quite some time you can imagine 5 000 people if something else is going on here you know when people you know how before people eat you know how they chat and then after everybody get their food how they stop talking and then after you stop talking everybody's fooled and you start talking again you start looking around like where did all this food come from 5 000 people ain't nobody got nothing to eat but this boy so he takes it from the crowd blesses it and then gives it back to the crowd this is your Bible and this is in day one and so this great miracle takes place he's the disciples are Distributing in it the people they are they all had plenty to eat and then I want you to add this up in your math class you that go to school you got 5 000 hungry people two fish five loaves of bread Everybody Eats and when we're done we got 12 full baskets left over brother Joe give me the equation to help me work this one out what kind of math what kind of gr what kind of trigger number what kind of a math is this we have more at the end than what we came in with it's because they gave what they had to the right man and the man that had the power to multiply what they had he made it bigger better greater than they could ever imagine it was something they had never seen before it was a miracle that was going to blow their mind something that that never had happened before was now taking place and they'll never ever forget this one right this is how the Lord does it he's setting it up very gratefully after this great Mass the Great Master did this great miracle before the people here's what the conclusion of the matter is in Saint John 6 20 right in there 19 or 20. the conclusion of the matter is that all the people said this is a prophet and not only is this a Prophet this is that Prophet That was supposed to come to the world that's what they said in day one they were going to grab him make him a king grab him make him a ruler grab him and force him to take ownership and Jesus took off he got wind of it he perceived it and he took off to a mountain and hid from the crowd the meantime the disciples jump into the boat uh the the Bible says that the winds and waves they were waiting for Jesus he didn't come it got dark it was late at night they jump into the boat the winds and the wave start to kick up a storm they they uh travel eight furlongs uh about a mile about four miles or so that they traveled on the sea the scriptures were very clear how far they were off into the water away from the sea Bank there and here comes Jesus walking on the water and then they invite him into the boat immediately after they invite him into the boat they're back on land again tremendous Miracle wasn't it right Saints how many Saints here know this is the word Saint John chapter 6. and here he is now they're questioning where where were you the the other crowd they're on the other side of the of the sea now and they can see that the the disciples aren't there and Jesus isn't there so the Bible says that they hire other ships from Tiberius to go to Capernaum across the river across the sea to get where Jesus was that's what they did scripture says so they finally ketchup to them and they start to ask him these questions again this is day two now they're on the other side they took up shipping from to Capernaum St John 6 24. Jesus they uh they they started asking him questions where were you what's going on and Jesus says you sought me not because of the miracle but you sought me because of the fishes in the Loaves and he he gives his first statement there he says labor not for meat natural but labor for the meat that is spiritual and say that to you this morning there is a natural concern that we all have here today in our own life as I said a hundred years from today none of us will be here 50 years from today a good portion of us won't be here 30 years from today there's a little smaller portion but I know for sure unless some great great miracle happens a hundred years from today you are not going to be here but you're going to be somewhere and our existence will continue on somewhere and so the time now is really the time the answer the questions where will I be in a hundred years from today what does my future look like really and isn't that important what I'm stressing over today because in the end it's all going to be over whatever you're going through right now it has the expiration date that's right that's exactly right it's a test it's the trial but it comes so it can go and then other things happen and life continues on and Jesus begins to tell the disciples that don't labor for natural things but labor for the Eternal things and then they ask him this question well Master what shall we do that we can work the works of God what can we do to do the works like what we just saw you do yesterday and what we heard about you did with walking on the water what can we do to work the works of God and Jesus says this is the work of God is to believe on him whom God has sent I wonder if we can believe on him whom God has sent sometimes we want to do more for God we want to do more for the kingdom we want to do something and the the the man always is trying to save himself so he's constantly looking for some works that he can do to make him a good man or a good girl but there is no good man in the sight of God there is no good girls in the sight of God because he's the only thing that is good and unless he put his hands on your life you can never be good and you can never rise up above from where you are unless God comes into your pathway and crosses up with you and find you somehow some way to make things a little bit different for you and when he comes into your life more questions will come but he's got all the answers for the questions in your life and he tells them to believe on him whom God has sent and it seems like a simple thing to do but it's very difficult to believe in what God has done who God has sent it's it's been the challenge throughout all of your Bible references all of the prophets all of the great moves of God they've had the people have had a challenge to believe even Moses believe John the Baptist Ezekiel Isaiah many of the prophets it's a great challenge to believe what they're saying is true he gives them this quotation that I am the bread of God and the bread of God is he which Cometh From Heaven so they're asking him show us a sign and our fathers in the Old Testament in the wilderness Moses gave them bread that was a sign Moses fed the children of Israel can can you show us a sign he says I am the bread of God he says first he says the bread of God is he that comes down from heaven then he says I am the bread of God that cometh down from heaven so is his discourse is getting a little bit deeper it's going a little bit further he went from the signs the Wonders the miracle now he's going into some teaching areas he's going into identifying who he is in the scripture and you know to be honest for those of us who have come into the message and heard the signs wonders and miracles if we be honest the the probability of the flashiest part about the message are the Miracles that's the that's what tickles our ear that to hear about some woman getting delivered of cancer or some paralytic receiving strength in their body but that's really just on the bottom of what God wants to do the highest order is for God to speak to you the highest order is for his word to come alive to you because that will never go away you know a man can get cancer today and be healed tomorrow and then die of cancer 10 years down the road did you know that people get healed of all kind of diseases and ailments and then years later they get sick again they get hurt again they have problems again but when a man gets a revelation of who Jesus Christ is that will endure when he's in his 50s in his 60s in his 80s what he's got to cross over to the other land the Revelation in his heart will never leave from him so what's the highest order if I were to ask you would you like to see a miracle today of course we all do but what do you need more to see a miracle or to become a miracle Hallelujah when the word of God opens up in your soul you become a miracle now you see things you never saw before amen I'm not discrediting Miracles I believe in them I need one I'm looking for him always but the highest order is for God to reveal this word and here Jesus is walking them as we would say into a corner I mean it looks like if it was a boxing match he's just body blow body blow body blow walking them into the corner and he's got a knockout punch for him if I were to express it that way you all excuse me and here he is The Works of God is is to do the will of God to believe on him on God's sin the bread of God is he who came down from heaven then I am the bread of God then he goes further and he says don't murmur that I said that I'm the bread but I am the living bread he says it again he knows you're struggling and what he's saying remember they wanted to make him a king yesterday today they're struggling with his quotations so now they're he's moving into showing him that he's the bread he says I will give you my flesh to eat for in my flesh there is life and he says how can you give us your flesh he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you Saint John 6 53. now he was in the synagogue when he said this when he says this the disciples around him there's a large group of them that said to themselves this is a harsh hand this is hard this is a little it's a little too much I like the healing part I like the walking on the water part I like the loaves in the fishes part eating your flesh and drinking your blood that's a little hard but this is the same Jesus and he's moving on he's moving up from the first phase to a second phase and then the second phase over into his third phase he's got something to tell you he's got something to share with you and so the conclusion is many of his disciples went back and walked with him no more then Jesus looks to his disciples 12. and he asked this question the title of our message this morning will you also go away he lost a lot already Jesus did looks like it do you think Jesus's feelings was hurt on The Human Side probably yeah you lose friends you lose people that have confidence in you you lose people that wanted you to be a king yesterday then you drop all the way down to I don't know what you're talking about man this is too much you're going off on the deep end now and you know he took two fishes and Five Loaves do you think he could have did it with one fish and one loaf do you think he could have did it with no fish and no loaves he just took that boy's list to show you it don't matter yeah I can take it if you give it to me I'll bless it if you give it to me I'll bless it if you keep it yourself you'll be you'll be you'll be hindered you'll be insufficient you'll never come to your com you never come to the place that God called you try to work it out yourself you'll come up lost you'll come up short-handed but if you give it to me ain't no blessing like the Lord's blessing on your life God begins to bless you he'll multiply you and where do you where do you want God to multiply you can I take 15 more minutes Saints what do you want God to multiply you huh under the first pool second pool or the third pool really though what do you want God to multiply you I want God to multiply my understanding of his word I want him to open up the book to me I want him to make it real to me not just I can argue it but I can live it and become the word that he sent in this day it's a beautiful word isn't it and there's a lot that goes with it um will you also go away now in this first second and third pool as brother random is talking about it here he takes a span of it gets eight and a half years eight years seven months from when he first mentions the third pool in 1956 January 1956 until in 1965 and he he shares many things in that eight year span like I said when you talk about the Holy Ghost or a human being or automobile there's a lot that goes with it we're just taking out a few of the Highlight points because we know that the third pool is a promise that's a promise to the believer and that's that's the land of promise let's look at it like that there's promises in the word that is the territory that belongs to the believer that we want to inherit and we need a certain maturity level before we can have some of these uh uh promises revealed to us we want the power to create how many want that he said I promise Lord I wouldn't change if I had the power to create I promise I would change it's like if I if I want 10 million dollars I promise all y'all will still be my friends I wouldn't Chase I promise I wouldn't change you say that but when you go into the bank and you see all those zeros behind the one you might have to get some more friends because your friend the friends here ain't living like that you think you would you stay the same we say that but we've never been there so let's be honest you don't know if you would change or not can y'all be honest with me this morning how do you know if you became a multi-millionaire that it's possible that you would change so that's just being honest because you you thinking broke man thoughts now when you when you become a millionaire you don't think like broke men think no more so let's be honest I have to wrestle with this myself I don't know Lord I know I want to change no I wouldn't change but I realized I don't know what happens hey man because you don't know what you would do with the power that was given to you you think that every Minister every man can have the character to handle the spoken word power foreign just be honest with ourselves and this is why we got to lay on our face before God Lord don't bring something on me that I can't handle I think I want that but if it's gonna mess me up in my mind then don't let it come my way don't bless me with something that's gonna curse me later on just let me stay in your hands Lord amen mm-hmm and so this this third pool will look at it as the land a land of promise that is to us to the believer in eight years and seven months brother random is talking about different aspects of it interesting interestingly in Revelations chapter 13 I like Revelation chapter eight I'd like you to read a scripture with me there and verse number one Prophet is going to be going into the greatest message of his life was the revelation of the set a little warm in here but it's better than outside maybe I think so Revelation chapter 8 verse 1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour brother Branham takes this scripture as he's bringing the revelation of the seventh seal here's part of what he says here about that seven seal go into the message the revelation of the seven seal paragraph two 42. he's talking about this hour of half an hour of Silence there's a reason why God doesn't reveal things all at one time there's a reason why you think you want the answer right now but he don't give you the answer right now there's a lot of you know dark things that he'll he'll withhold from you I think of Joseph and Jacob Jacob loved his son Joseph and Joseph was sold as a slave down in Egypt and his brothers came back and said he was dead and that man went through the funeral service in years of rejection because his son Joseph had died prematurely and God up above looking at Jacob grieve for years but his son was alive all along in prison down in Egypt and God never opened Jacob's eyes he heard it it hurt his heart he went down almost to the Grave with that sorrow and that grief and God never showed him more until it was time for Joseph to reveal himself to his brothers that night the very night they were coming to tell Jacob the Lord comes to him in a dream say by the way son tomorrow you'll get good news your son really is a lie it's like Lord why could you just show me that well he couldn't get the part that you have to play out of it if he would have showed you that he had to let you go through that and let you grieve and go through all of that to bring out another promise working up over here and God works that way in secrecy he opens up some of his word today and then he'll reveal it back from you that's how he operates doesn't tell you the whole story in the beginning because he's got to bring out characteristics in your life got to develop a prayer life in you he's got to develop patience in you he wants you to be a real son or daughter of God there's some things you can't Google all right you got to pray it in way to steal you don't got the answer you gotta wait on no more and trust him and believe him and know that God's gonna work it out for you amen so look at this seven seal John couldn't even write it paragraph 240. no he was forbidden to write here so you see he didn't write it but this is silence in the Four and Twenty Elders that stood before God they're harping with their Harps they quit playing their Harps the Angels Hustler singing in heaven think the holy cherubims and seraphims that Isaiah saw in the temple three sets of wings two over their face two over the feet flying day and night they were before God singing Holy hope no Praises no altar Services no nothing there was silence hush deadly silence in the book of redemption was broken up think of it it's broke the lamb breaks it you know what they were awed by it I believe they didn't know there it was they just stopped you're right about it even write a symbol about it why this is why there was no activity in heaven it might give away the secret do you see it now if it's so great it must be included because it's got to happen but when the seven Thunders now notice when the seven angels come forth to sound their trumpets there was one Thunder the man knocks on the pulpit once when Israel was gathered there was one truck there was a trumpet time shall be no more the last trumpet one Thunder but here are seven straight Thunders right in a row one two three four five six seven that perfect number seven thunders in a row uttered making one two three four five six seven a hold of it he might do great damage there's one thing he don't know now he can interpret anything he wants to and impersonate any kind of a gift I hope you're learning but he can't know this it's not even written in the word Church Say Amen it's a total Secret you know that's amazing how some people think they know what it is too let me think I think I know what it is let me think let me think he hit hit your head make the thoughts come faster right let me think let me think I think I know what it is no you don't know what it is no man knows what it is Satan doesn't know what it is so when you hear somebody preaching saying they know what it is what you gonna do pray for him don't get mad at them pray for him you say you should get a hold of it but he can't know this it's not even written in the word it's a total secret the Angels everything shut up if they made one move it might give something away they just shut up quit harping everything stopped oh my what was that other quote I gave you there says in the seventh seal yes here it is paragraph 258 continuing on in this uh seven seal if you want something to happen uh you have to take my word for this if I'm planning on the line tell everybody everything and I've tried I tell you I tell people I'll do a certain certain thing and watch the devil cut off every will he can to get there see to beat me to it but if I can get the Revelation from God and just don't say nothing about it then it's different now where are we at we're in Revelations chapter 8 verse 1 right the half an hour of Silence remember Satan will try to impersonate he will try to impersonate everything that the church will do he's tried to do it we notice it through the Antichrist but this is one for him to know it it's the third pool he just knows nothing about it see he does it understand it but there's a secret lace beneath that so what scripture did I just read there Revelations 8 verse 1 half an hour of Silence it was silent for a purpose for a reason to withhold the great mystery of the coming of the Lord in the last day final the last day close up of all things a seal up of everything there's a great Secret in there that we don't know none of us know we try to know we and and Satan will impersonate it he'll go he'll go he'll get quotes on and he'll try to come up with the answer through quotes he'll try to go through any kind of means to come up and ask me to find my place in these things all right let's take my time is always I got 15 more minutes my time is almost gone but y'all sang a little long so help me out here a little bit as far as I know paragraph number 16 present stage of my Ministry brother Madam says this here as far as I know that every Vision that he's ever given me has been fulfilled except the one that I'm the change in my Ministry to where I'm to pray for people in a little place like a little room under a tent or a big Auditorium or something that looked like to me like a tent remember that two or three years ago right and what would take place down there and he told me my Ministry of the first poor remember about catching the little bitty fish and missing it second one was small fish but then he told me on the third pool don't fail see heightened up in the room a little bit I like that when that happens when all right everybody ain't smiling that's all right but it but but it continues on in the message Look Away to Jesus this is a year later so let it develop he says I have come to a place in my Ministry to where I have to say something in paragraph 27 Jesus said that what he heard that was what he spoke and he said I called you my friends and a friend tells his friends all things listen Look Away to Jesus 1963 continues on says this here now you all love the Lord so now I'm going to say something to you paragraph 38. now that I've said all along and that is the thing that we've looked forward to for so long for as least many years four or five years or maybe longer the third pool has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is now remember there will be never be an impersonation of that because it can't be see it cannot be now it's in existence and I have warned of this that soon right at this time is now it's just happened so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until the council begins to tighten up when it does when that does the Pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of his power see see see now I must continue in evangelism I want to stop here just a moment now remember he says that it can't be impersonated so this bypasses all of First Corinthians 13 and 14 in First Corinthians 12 all the gifts all of the other gifts of the Spirit nine spiritual gifts Satan can impersonate any gift any inspiration anything he can impersonate but he can't know this so this is exclusive from anything else any other gift he can't impersonate he can't know this he'll try but he can't impersonate this do I have a prayer in church here this morning for you have had the word you know what to look for how to stand I must continue on in evangelism and Friends of Mines keep still just keep moving on for the hour is approaching swiftly what hour see that when something is going to be done now you might see some little odd things happen for me nothing sinful I don't mean but I mean something odd to the regular Trend because where I reach now in the ministry I'm dropping back here watching the spot watching that spot and waiting for the time to use it but it's going to be used and everyone knows that for as certain as the first was identified so has the second been identified we know where it is so the third pool is here it's so sacred that I mustn't say much about it as he told me in the beginning said this say nothing of it you remember that years ago it speaks for itself see but I've tried to explain the others and I made a mistake this will be the thing that to my opinion I don't say the Lord tells me this this will be the thing that will start the rapturing faith for the going away see see I must lay quiet just for a little while and I remember who was listening to this tape you might see changing my ministry right there is coming a Time upon in this nation to where this nation is going to exercise all the power that the Beast had before it which was Pagan Rome would it become paparone see that this nation will do that Revelations 13 plainly explains it the lamb come upon the Earth the other beasts come up out of the water thickness multitudes of people this lamb come up where there were no people a lamb represents religion the Lamb of God remember it spoke you have to be in this Council of churches or you won't be able to have Fellowship now this is going to happen Saints this is already in the motion to happening now we're seeing this clearly I've always wondered why I have such a an attraction to the Holocaust museums when I get a chance to go see them it's just really strikes me that men can do this to other men like to a race of people and in one of the museums it said there were some in one of the plaques that says something like this when they persecuted the Greek when it persecuted the Jews well I was in the Jews so it didn't bother me but when they came to persecute me there was nobody left to help me because everybody was gone and that's really looking in the mirror you see people act that way well they're coming after the Jehovah Witnesses whatever that's not us they're coming after the enormous whatever that's not us they're coming after the Baptist well whatever that's not us us is next right now brother random brings it out like this and I hope this settles in very sweetly into your heart he says that that Roman power that caused Hitler to do what he did and all the other nations stood back and watched this one man go crazy against the Jews and there's other civil Nations seeing it happening from afar act like they didn't see it but it had to happen and that those those are two hundred thousand thousand Horsemen were released and Hitler released the Mussolini released them and they went upon the Jew natural that's just the highlight of what's going to take place to the bride spiritual now this is very very serious this is a very very uh uh Awakening time this is the hour if I ever was on fire for God I should be on fire for God today if I ever was gonna make a move towards his word I need to make that move today amen this is the hour this is the time listen to the urgency that the prophet is giving and as he speaks on this third pool and he talks about how this nation is going to exercise the power to come against the true church again I mean they're coming against businesses now you can't do anything righteous or holy let somebody some group is going to be offended and not just offended they want you out of business they want to come after you I'm not saying something you don't already know that Spirit has been released we know that so let me finish this quote and then I'll close all right it's a tightening paragraph 49. paragraph 48 well it's practically that way now you can't go to a church and preach unless you have a fellowship car his brothers already doing that to Brothers now that's right brother George know I'm talking about sir you can't go and preach in just any message Church first of all if you preach you out of the word will of God anyways some of these places right huh it's true that's what's going on right now and now on purses like ourselves we're going to be cut out all of that all together that's exactly because they won't be able to do it it's tightening and then when that time comes and the Press comes to a place to where you're pressed out they watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pool who is he talking to me he's talking to me and when you read it he should be talking to you watch the third pool that seems to be I don't know when but it's real real close I might be building a platform for somebody else to step on I may be taking before that time I don't know that time may be this coming week the holy spirit will come and bring Christ Jesus he may come next week he may come yet tonight I don't know when he will come he doesn't tell us that now wow what an admonition what a word that was in um look away to Jesus 1963. can I go a little bit further look at what the prophet the warning the prophet gives in this Feast of the trumpet's message so he's quoted frady's there it's a spiritual place you get a chance to read it Revelations chapter 9 verse 13. I'm not an interpreter of a scripture the prophet is he said what that meant and notice what happens under the Sixth trumpet they were turned loose on the Jews the persecution of the Jews Supernatural Devils nearly 2 000 years then Loose by Stalin Hitler upon the Jews you say well that isn't Roman it's the same spirit they've done the same things they did to the Christians so you see them happening to the Jews it don't bother you it's the same Spirit that's what they did to the Christians well I ain't a Jew it ain't bothering me you next should be sober in the room the people there should be Sovereign should be the people that's following this angel this messenger amen oh that Mercy you know this life ain't all we got we got to leave here one day and I want to be ready I'm going to be ready when it's time for me to go don't you paragraph 163 there is that Roman Empire bound there by what the ecclesiastical Powers which Rome Pagan Rome becomes papal Rome was found there in the traditions of Christian what part of Christian superstitions and how to Rome putting it together all these worship of women all these other kind of stuff Christmas days holidays and holy days and things it's been bound with the tradition that it cannot let loose because it's against Christian principles still the same ungodly Pagan spirit and that Spirit caught into the nations of the world according to the Prophecies of his vehicle and arrested them continue on to paragraph 181 I'm trying to close right now all right paragraph 181 I hope that God opens your eyes to this now who's he talking to the Branham Tabernacle the followers of this message I hope that God opens your eyes to this now because I realize this is just not speaking to this church here this tape goes worldwide I don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings but just to tell you the truth now the ecclesiastical realm has been opened from the natural Revival of the old Pagan Rome went forth on the Jews those Jews which has always been their enemy lying with teeth and everything is stomped down and broke out the people Rome always been God's enemy and it was bringing them to a Slaughter just like they did the the other and the hour to call the bride how Loosely ecclesiastical Church Spirit loose upon what not upon the denominations upon the bride here you'll get it the bride will not go through that time the Bible says not the church Whispers can't you see that Brethren so how close are we or how many will stay with the word Henry can say like the Apostle Peter Lord to whom shall we go for we know and we are sure that thou art the Christ I like to close this message and this time I'm closing for rear I'm not closing a preacher clothes I'm closing closing all right what does it mean when the preacher says he's getting ready to close absolutely nothing but I'm closing now and I'd like to close with this here in Exodus 23 verses 20 through 33. this is Israel leaving from a great Promised Land he's sending them out with the messenger or leader to lead the way all right if you know this is true Say Amen somebody help me preach here all right can you help me how many is happy love the Lord look they're out of Junction and and so he's calling the people they were slaves in Egypt they were you know they did go over here go do that go to this where you're going to live your name your slave number is this this is where y'all and then they leave from that in the great Exodus and he establishes the laws and liberals off but as he's commissioning them he lets them know to follow this angel and he says behold I will send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I prepared so God I will send an angel his angel to send you to lead you to a place now this message is to encourage your heart to stick with that Angel's teaching and stick with that Angel's leadership because the doctrine of the Angel is the doctrine of the Lord it was the Lord that sent the angel and he says Be Be Be fearful of him and he will not pardon your transgressions but if you if you stick with him he'll keep you in the way and not only will he keep you in the way he'll take you to the place to my place that I'm trying to bring you to now we are all going somewhere every one of us are headed somewhere and every one of us is on the journey but who is leading you it's the question and where are you going I'm so glad that God sent an angel in this last day to send before me that I don't have to go out and try to figure it out but I gotta I got a message to follow I got a messenger to follow and that messenger had an angel that led him to the place that God wants me to be amen amen and therefore where can I go Lord for you alone have the words of eternal life there's a lot of people in the park pull you out of this way come over here hear this something you never heard before come over here see this something you never said before this brother got a revelation of what the third pull is and this one got a revelation on the third pool they can't know what the third pool is did I read the quotes for you did you say Amen to him well the quote still said if I read it again is it going to change so I'm going to stick with the angel and the angel is taking me somewhere he's taking me to a place and what place is that that's the place where God wants me to be and I believe God wants you to be somewhere too I pray that you'll find that place God bless you let's pray Lord Jesus we thank you for your word this morning we thank you for the admonition Lord as I left out some of those warnings of persecution to come and have we seen it how it looks on the natural that persecuted the natives and many of those in these European countries were persecuted the Romans persecuted many of the gypsies you see the Africans persecuted we've seen the Jews persecuted we see so many groups of people it's the Roman Spirit that's been released out of the river Euphrates and there's a tremendous pressure upon us today demon powers trying to anoint us to get out of the way but Lord we want to stay in the way that the angel has called us to that we'll hear that voice will stick with that word Lord until you call us to the place that you want us to be I don't know exactly all the details store but you've given me the word that I know where to stand and how to stand Lord you alone have the words of eternal life and we see o God that there's some flesh eat my drink my blood but Lord we know where the words of Life are and that's where we stand today I encourage the people Lord to stay with this message stay with the angel that brought it to believe it with all of their heart Lord and not to impose this great ministry into the hands of others that were not called to this Lord I pray that we would take he develop in our life oh God it's my prayer may you grant it and what you hear may it be a Sweet Sweet Sound in your ear can you sing I Love You Lord oh I love I love you Lord and I live my voice [Music] sure you oh my soul [Music] oh take joy my king my king and what you hear may it be a swing tree sounds your ear amen how many know that these things are true if you just look in the world in nature you just look out in politics and you see what's going on with things that were that we know that are right are being attacked anything that's wholesome and right anything like that's been it's under attack gradually we say Well they're not closing our church down well not yet that spirit is out there and where should I be as a gospel preacher as a believer in the word where should I be oh God help me God help me I I see the warning I see the signs we see what's going on and we can't stop it it's gonna happen we've been thoroughly warned we know what to look for we know how to stand I say like I say like Peter Lord where I'm going to go I I know you have the words of your life I I am sure that thou art the Christ the son of living God and he gave his life he gave his life for this gospel will you go away also God help us to take a stand for this word It's A persecuted word it's a word that's dripping with blood but it is the right word so God bless you amen let's stand and we'll close with that song oh it's blind it's dripping with blood blood it's dripping with blood this Holy Ghost Gospel [Music] it's dripping with blood [Music] the blood of desires [Music] who died for the truth there's only the hospital amen let's raise it up maybe [Music] first one to die for this Holy Ghost

the blood of disciples [Music] the truth holy ghosts is dripping with love hallelujah amen amen you know we we certainly think that we would be able to pass the test if we're put under the squeeze I I met this doctor here here in the city Dr akong a Congo Samson is from Kenya and he wrote a little book on his persecutions in the Middle East it's an African man I sat and had lunch with him and he shared his testimony I'm reading this book on some of the persecution he went through and they tortured him so bad in one of these uh countries I can't think of I can't think of the name of the country right now that he actually recanted and accepted Muhammad as a prophet he said the pain the torture was so great he took these iron bars and ran it through his the muscles of his calves and turned him upside down and and he was beaten I met this man I know him and a very humble gentleman medical doctor and he felt so bad that he actually he thought he had it in them they squeezed him they squeezed him the pain was so great that he that he said okay I give up I accept Mohammed as a prophet and he said that and when they got they gave him his freedom sent him out of the country he said he lived under that condemnation for many many years but then God began to heal him and strengthen his testimony and then I started to think about you know the torture and the pain that a man would go through for for the gospel of the Lord Jesus and I I think I could take the test but there might be something in me that might be a little weak and I don't want that weakness in me I'm just being for real I don't want I don't want nothing in me that can break I want to be faithful to the end and you know where that faithfulness starts it starts right here it starts right here every time I pick up the Bible can I be faithful in these small things I'm supposed to be a pastor I'm supposed to be a minister I'm supposed to be an example but if I was really squeezed down to the test if it hurt that bad where they're torturing me that bad what would I do but this is where it starts right here because they're not torturing me now I have the freedom to praise him right now if there's anything in my life that shouldn't be if there's a breaking point in me all the way to the end yes that's what I want to be if he gave me spoken word power if I had the power to create would I use it right I'm I'm not that clean I don't think my heart has some weak places I'm my temper my attitude I God help me I gotta be honest things I got God help I want to be honest while there's blood on The Mercy Seat because there is help from the helper and he's got the power to make me what I need to be and that's the value of a of a time like this that's the value amen let's sing that song God bless you I trust the words of the Lord will bless your heart today started out with five thousand then they left and 70 left then he got down to his disciples and he asked will you go also you my boys you my man would you go also one of them was the devil God have mercy God have mercy let's sing that song make me what I ought to be help me to be more like thee amen and that's our prayer oh make me what I ought to be help me help me to be more like this bid me come up bid me come up higher oh make me [Music] what I are to be then help me Lord help me to be more [Music] oh make me what I are to be
