And if it's a bad emotion that you're not ready for that day, well, make it a good emotion before you leave here tonight. Amen. There's no sense in in playing church anymore. It's it's it's too late and it's it's it's not worth it. Satan doesn't have anything to offer compared to what he has to offer. Amen. But there is coming a day where every knee will bow, every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. Maybe we could just stand and sing that. He is Lord. He has risen from the dead and he is Lord. as our brothers come for the offering tonight. For he is Lord. Yes, he is Lord. Yes, he has risen from the dead. that he is Lord. Oh, every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. [Music] Can we all bow our heads in prayer? Father, we're thankful, Lord, that you're the Lord of our life. We're happy, Lord, to bow a knee, Father, and Lord, just contact you. Lord, you have everything in control, Lord, of our lives, Lord, many needs here tonight perhaps, Father. And we pray Lord for the service for brother Israel Lord the family Lord every musician Lord every teacher Lord all those that labor and ministry of helps Father we pray your hand upon her mightily Lord we think of Sister Waver Lord as she's up in years and just barely hanging on Father Lord we don't know her appointed time but Father if there's still time on the clock. We ask you, Lord, to comfort her and bring her healing and help her in every way she has need of. Father, Lord, tomorrow, Lord, I face a surgery, I pray your mighty hand would just bring me through, Lord, and guide the doctors, Lord, for every unspoken request, for every heart that's lifted to you now, Father. We pray you'd bring mighty deliverance, Lord, that you grant the desires of every heart. Father, tonight we pray your word would be more precious to us than ever. Lord, let it become Christ in us shining through. Father, Lord, and those that may not be here, be with everyone and we'll give you all the praise and the glory. Father, we also think of Natalie McGawan. Lord, help her through this time of pneumonia. And there's other things, Father, others factors, but you've brought her this far. We pray Lord that you would later unto all that you have for us. We thank you for everything. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we ask. Amen. Amen. Just singing that song. You can't help but think of the hundreds of times that we sung that when we went to Tucson Tabernacle years ago. That was one of Brother Green's theme songs. It was He is Lord. And you just you think about that, you start thinking about what a day that'll be when we see our loved ones as well. And we're looking forward to that, but it's going to pale compared to to seeing him. So maybe we just sing that one more time. Brother Zach has a has a special for us tonight. Yes, he is Lord. Yes, he's my Lord. Oh, he has risen from the dead and he is Lord. Every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. Amen. You can be seated. [Music] I am a poor.

Um but he told me he worked an 18 hour shift and he worked backtoback shifts so that he could be here tonight. So next time you're feeling tired, think of Shawn. And I just appreciate the sacrifice he's making. 18 hours um probably no sleep for a while and and here he is helping and and hasn't gone to sleep yet. So amen. You know, there's a song I wonder if we have that sounds like home to me. Just if we have that like to sing that. If not, we'll we'll do something else. [Music] Start with the verse if we could. You just have the chorus. Well, maybe I will sing. the uh the verses to that then. All right. Somewhere just across the Jordan River. There's a place of everlasting joy and peace. [Music] Oh, where the stream of life is flowing there forever. And a crown of life is waiting there for me. And that sounds like home to me. Like where I want to be. There will be no tears to fill our eyes again. And the hills will echo with their story as we sing of his grace and gloryy where the saints of God will be. Oh, that sounds like home to me.

Like to stand and go right to the word. We're going to listen to this message. Brother Rom preach Jehovah Gina and in the scriptures Genesis chapter 22. I think he was on a series because he he mentioned that never got to his and he's been reading the scripture over and over, but it doesn't I don't think he actually reads it in the sermon, but he will be referring to out of Genesis chapter 22, the offering of Isaac in verse number one. And it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him,"Abraham," and he said, "Behold, here I am." And he said, Take now thy son, thy only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee in the land of Mariah, and offer him therefore a burnt offering upon one of the mountains, which I will tell thee of." And Abraham rose up early in the morning, saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, claved the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place which God had told him. Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off. And Abraham said unto his young men, "Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you." And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son. And he took the fire in his hand and a knife, and they went both of them together. And Isaac spake unto Abra his father and said, "My father." And he said, "Here I am, my son." He said, "Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?" And Abraham said, "My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering." So they went both of them together. Amen. Thank God for the reading of his word. Let's sing Only Believe. We believe [Music] that all things are possible. Oh, [Music] only [Music] all things are possible. All things. Say, Lord, I believe. Oh Lord, I believe. [Music] &gt;&gt; I believe all things are possible. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe [Music] all things are possible. Lord, God bless you. You may be seated, brother. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you very much. [Applause] I'm sorry that I had such a raspy throat today. But this is 4 months straight in service and it just seems I could just go from one to another. I wonder if you can hear me. Can you hear me? Can you hear me up in the balcony? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Um I guess my zeal is eating up my wisdom. I preach a lot then all hours I pray and then another thing I get hot really easy and when I'm speaking as I say that about my hair coming out that's not a natural thing that was an accident a barber did it was going to put some stuff on my hair to take the dander out is [Applause] carbolic acid. So, medicine's all right, but you want to know who's giving it to you. One ghost killed the father. So, and one treatment fixes me all up. So, just know who's giving it. That's the same way I think about salvation. I want to know where it comes from. I want to know somebody's talking about has had an experience of what they're talking about. That's what makes it so real. When Jesus become so real to us, I'm I'm standing probably a little too close to this. A little more conscious of my horses than I guess I should be. But as far as I know, I don't have no cold. It just preach for each four month straight all the way to the frozen regions of the north to the jungles of the south and just change one day one place and couple days somewhere else and that does it constantly speaking outside all kinds of weather. So we're happy to be here, happy to be in Colia. This has been indeed to me a great thrilling time to visit the Colinas. And as I said the other night, I believe like the wine at the wedding supper, the Lord left the best for last. I don't mean that uh any disregards to other states. They've all been very nice and the whole world that I visit has been very nice. But I've certainly the Carolina people has found a warm place in my heart that'll be there until I meet you in the rapture. This little pastor here, Brother Jeffrey, what a wonderful little character. He, brother, I believe Pardon and Brother Dixie, the three pastors that I've met in the association of in these revivals, how wonderful they've been to me. How I appreciate them all. So glad that has ministers like that. Just got a chance a few minutes ago to shake hands with some of the closure behind it. Just a good old warm panel handshake. I like it like that. Don't you? We forgot that. I hope my wife forgives me. She said that I call her up here but she faint. She's so vual. She's like me. So I was very vaguely once, but I had to get out of it for the Lord. So, but she is very vual. And I called her on the platform one time. She seen me go into visions many times at the house. She just stepped out of the room. But the first time she was ever on the platform is a few months ago. Mr. Mohler kind of tricked her into it and got her to the platform. One ning had already come on. She said, "I I I don't desire." And so, but if there's any credit to be given to the brand family, let it go to her. She's the one who deserves it. She stands between me and the public. 37 years old, almost completely white. And a real mother, sweetheart. Why? I trust that all you boys when you get married, you get a wife like God gave me. And I'm so happy for my children. Billy, Paul, little Rebecca, Sarah, and little baby Joseph. We greet you all and we thank you for your kindness. A few moments ago, they taken up a love offering for me. I didn't have to do that. Wasn't asked to. Just a courtesy. I could have been all a millionaire. You know that if id just taken what was given. One offering, one bank was over a,500,000. I refused to look at it. When agents brought it to me, said I don't want people's money. I want their confidence. I can win them to Christ. I'd rather have. You got some lovely homes. You I've been driving around your city, some fine places, but you know, I'd rather and I I appreciate that. Oh, you don't know how glad I am to see God prosper someone. I love it. But the Lord has given me a home. It's a parage. It belongs to the church that I used to pastor. I just live there. But I I tell you, I'd rather have favor with God than anything I know. And I can't have favor with God and not favor with you all. You are the one who works with me in Christ. If you didn't believe me this afternoon, there would be nobody here. What good would my message do to the people if there's nobody here to receive it? What good would it do if it fell on the hearts that were stony and didn't believe it? See, you're just as much into it as I am or the rest of it. All together, we're co-workers in Christ Jesus. As I was speaking about my wife a few moments ago, thought first I let it pass by, but it's just too good. She'll tell me about that on the road home this afternoon. You know what? I I just I like oldfashioned things. That's the reason I like the oldfashioned gospel. I believe that when you handshake, it's just not reach out. I like one of them real good old times. See, like we used to have love seems to be failing in our generation. I was down sometime my wife and a lady said, "How do sister Brad?" I see my wife turning. I looked around. I said, "Honey, that lady spoke to you." She said, "I spoke to her." I said, "I didn't hear it." She said, "I smile." Oh. I said, "Honey, that's not a that old little silly pot and greetings is not a hello." I said, "I I like to hear somebody hello. I I like to where you really speak and use the oldfashioned way." I remember brother Bworth, Dr. FForth, if he ever comes this way, greet him. He's a lovely brother. And he had retired. He not retired. He just quit. He thought his ministry is over. That's been about seven or eight years ago. And now he's one of my managers. So he is down was having a campaign down in Florida and there was some kind of a duchess or something was left had the ground. So in the afternoon when he started leaving he said, "Brother Brand Duchess is back here." Now friends, I didn't know then what a duchess is. I don't know anymore today. I don't know what one is, but it was some kind of a woman back there and she was dressed. She had enough jewels on her arms to send a dozen missionaries around the world like that's not necessary. and she had a pair of specks on a stick holding out that far from her. Now, you know, nobody can see through glass and she's looking out like that and she said, "Are you Dr. Ray?" I said, "No, I'm not." I'm rather you call me Brother Dale. And she I had her hand like this. She said, "I am charmed to meet you. We shoved our handful down. I said, "Well, sister, get it down here so I know. You know, I just wonder how people put on when after all you're just 6'." I standing by a big museum here some time ago. I love art, music, and in this museum, there's two young fellas looking at analysis of a human body of a man that weighed 150 pounds. You know how much you're worth if you weigh 150 lbs? You're worth 84 cents. You got whitewash about you to sprinkle a human's nest. Just a little bit of calcium and so forth is worth 84 cents. Thank you, sister. With the $1,000 be cool on nose turned up and rained and drowned and thinking you're somebody when you're only worth 84 cents. That body's that boy stand there said, "Well," one looked toward said, "John, we're not very much after all, are we?" Oh, this is my chance. I tapped him on the back. I said, "That's true, boys. That you got a soul that's worth 10,000 words. Take care of that soul. Let the 84 cents go. Watch that soul before it forever. And that's true, friends. Now, with this in mind, and I'm I'm ashamed to even try to read that same text again. I've been two times on it. Never did get to it. You're such a wonderful audience. I believe I could stay on that same text months. I remember one time at my church at home, I preached nearly a year on Job and I had him on the ash sheet back there for about 4 months. Some nice lady, very diplomatic. She was too nice, I guess, to come up and tell me, but she wrote me a nice little letter. She said, "Reb I'm sure enjoying every one of messages, but when you go to get job all day, she Well, I was waiting for a climax. Got several souls to the altar when Joel got off the edging. I just love the Old Testament. It's nuggets and every one of them point to Christ Jesus at Calvary. Now, friends, if there's been any blessing or anything in our come has been, we don't go unless we're led to places. And I know it's been a blessing to us. Not only have you been blessed, but we've been blessed by coming. And now I trust to God that the meetings will mean lots to him. That you people who've been saved will join some good spiritually church. And all these pastors, I pray that their ministry will be blessed exceedingly abundantly. all you people prosper health. God bless you all. Till I see you again, pray for me. And if I have to go before I see you again, won't you do me a favor? If I go and my bodies can be buried, when they let me down to the ground, they're going to say only believe. So when you hear on the radio or news or somewhere that I'm gone, stop this few minutes and I'm only leaving. I believe I'll come out for my mama dead someday. Most all brands when they get old, some of them live long lives. My grandmother was 110. My grandfather died at 97. My grandmother on my mother's side, she died young. the scarf on her, but she was the one that was a half breed Cherokee Indian. And my grandfather died about four years ago on my mother's side being somewhere in his 90s. My father went at 52. I don't know when that will come but usually when they get old the brand it's just a nature like Isaac went blind Jacob went blind both of them prophets and so forth just seem to render family strain the Brandoms when they get old they go to shake pause I expect if I leave something gre preach my last sermon Pray for the lick person. I hope I'm an old man with me. Jesus tries. I come all the way through every broad patch, every hard place. I come down to the river and I can feel its dashers coming. The foam coming in from out there and I know what time has come. Standing with the gray hairs hanging around my shoulders and shaking with the stick in my hand. Home helmet. Lay it down. Stick the old sword deer back in the sheath of eternity. Scream out, "Father, send out the light bulb coming over this morning. He'll be there. I don't worry about that. That's been settled for 25 years. It's more settled today in my heart than ever was. I know who I am believing. I'm persuade he's able to keep that which I committed to him again today. I hope to see you over there and until then I've got a trip to Africa many places coming when the winds are blowing hard the hot breezes across the country and I'm standing in challenge of which doctors and so forth. Will you promise to be praying for me? I'll pray for you. Now let us speak to him. Our heavenly father, we thank thee today for Jesus, thy son, closing this revival, not closing it, Lord. May it just be beginning. May the influence of your visit with us never leave these people until Jesus comes. Then start an oldfashioned revival throughout the city and the state. every church, all the full gospels, Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Nazarines, whatever they are. Father, send a great revival to us. Bless these handkerchics who are here before us. Oh, eternal God, let your spirit come upon each of them and bless them that they'll be healed as they go to their destination. when they're laid up on the sick folks that they're intended for. May diseases leave their body. Bless us. Love the audience. Lord, bless Brother Jeff. God, be with these other pastors. Be with all these members, other churches everywhere, all the pastors of the city and throughout the regions. Grant these things to us. Father, give us just a little voice to speak, a great meeting service. May many find their way to Christ. let him be healed or we ask it in Jesus name thy son. Amen. The same text Genesis 22. Satan says you can't finish it. I can't. by God. We brought Abraham from the time that he was called of God and was brought to a place where he had received the promise in figuratively. Last night we left his El Shadi, God speaking to him. Then we got over to God promised you Sarah and Abraham and showed a sign what he was going to do for all his children. How many was sure last time I see your hand? Do you believe it? Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That our hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness. All around my soul gives way and is all my hope and stay. On Christ's solid rock we stand over the grounds is sinking silence fails. Everything else fails. God's word can fail. I was with a great doctor here not long ago, doctor of science. He gave a a degree to a boy, a young fellow, a friend of mine. And after he embraced him as receiving his degree in science, he was from Washington. and he embraced him and paid this thing on him and he said, "Son, after all these years of study in science, he said in Washington or somewhere some hall of science, I forget how many books was written on the latest science." He said it would take you at least two years if you read day and night to read them all through. And by the time you got them all read through, then you had to discard everything that you learned. It's that fast. To them, things that scientifically proven now would be scientifically proven to be wrong. Then I stood waiting. That night, that same man in Streetport, Louisiana, sat in my meeting. I see him. I said, "I'm glad to have the doctor here with us tonight." And I heard his remark what he said that this young student who's here now with us a leader of this music here tonight on the platform. But if he would take two years, how science will absolutely prove that the things that they once proved to be right, they prove again to be wrong. When I went to school, they told me the sun set perfectly still and the world went around it. That scientifically proved to be a lie. Now the sun runs also. That's right. See, so I suppose Joshua, he wasn't so ignorant after all when he prayed for God as the sun. See, it always comes back to the book. Here some time ago, science said, "Oh my, isn't that awful that that Bible says that God said as a man thinkketh in his heart?" There's no mental faculties in his heart to think about. But you know what? Last year they found out God was right. The soul lives in the heart and not in the mind. That's right. So God was right. As a man thinkketh in his heart, so is he. Not as his intellectuals introduced to him, but as his soul tells him, it can't fail there. Now, so I said to that science, I said, "Sir, them books will fail and always will fail, but I can tell you a book that you'll never have to take back anything it ever said. It'll always be proven to be true. That's God's word. &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth will pass away, said Jesus. But my word shall never fail. I love that. Abraham trusted in God's word. And we're the children of Abraham today because we trust in God's word. We believe it regardless what people says and what theologians say and educators say, science says. If it's contrary to the word, every man's words a lie. God's true. It's the way I believe it. And no matter how strange it may seem, I believe it to be true anyhow. Now, want you to notice Abraham. Now, we're going to finish up the text just for a few minutes before we start the prayer line. Could you imagine this little boy Isaac being born? Abraham and Sarah now about 115 years old was Sarah and about 11 125 years old was Abraham waiting. Here's the promised child. The pretty little boy about 16 years old, little hair hanging out over his shoulder. A handsome little lad. how he loved his father and mother and just as obedient. You know, children, that's what you ought to be to your father and mother. I think it's awful when you hear young people say, "My old man and my old woman." I don't believe you people in Coran, you little children say that. We up in the Northlands where I come from, they say it. And it's too bad they ever said it. Listen, that's not the old man and old woman. Someday when the floors is squeaking and cracking and a casket's going out and you look and see a grayheaded person laying there, it won't be the old man, but your daddy, that's your mother. You honor them. Now, that's the first commandment was promised. Honor your father and mother, which may lengthen the days on the earth that the Lord giveth thee. So little Isaac being so sub subject in subjection to his father and mother because he was a type of Christ as he was the subject to the father perfectly and how he minded his father and mother and one day God said now Abraham you know way down years to come there's going to be a people all kinds of scientific things and they're going to try to disprove my word but I want to double my word. After I swore I'd keep it, I'll let you live to see the day when you was 100 years old and I turned you back to a young man of about 25, 35 years old. Again, you and Sarah and he brought forth this child. You see my hand, I'm going to give an example for the people of Charlotte today for everywhere else. This how I keep my word. I'll tell you what I want you to do. Abraham, I want you to take your little boy and go to a certain mountain where I'm going to show you. And I want you to take him up there and lay him on an altar and offer him up for a sacrifice. I want you to kill him, Abraham, because in him I'm going to bless all the world. Doesn't that sound strange? How is that boy? How's Abraham now actually waiting all a hundred years to receive his child and the child being born as the last ser no more that was all of them and how could this be now after he's waited all this time in the young man here now about 16 now take him up and destroy the only hope that you of my promise being fulfilled. Wish I had just a little more voice. I just like to show you something here. Sometime God takes away everything. Let the doctor tell you you're going to die. That's right. Prove it. Scientifically show you you're going to die just to show his mercy to you. Doctor says that cancer we got nothing for it. You know, I heard on the radio the other day that there has never been one successful cancer operation. That's right. We haven't got nothing far. We have in the medical science. God has in his hands. Moses brought the children of Israel all the way through the land of Egypt. And when he come out of Egypt, just think 2 million people. And when they left Egypt, there wasn't a feeble person among them. How did he for 40 years fight cancer, tuberculosis? How many babies is born overnight? How many houses did Dr. Moses have to visit? How many broken arms and out there in that desert running around? How much pneumonia? How much malaria drinking out of ponds and whatever they could get to? How much bacteria did they pick up in those germs and things in the waters? Say doctor, wouldn't you like to look into Moses medicine kit and find out what he kept that people all well and not even their clothes got thr how many like to look in Dr. Moses medicine kit? Would you like to see it? I know where it's at in the Bible. Would you like to hear it? Raise up your hand if you will. Just a minute. I'll show you just exactly where we're at. We see what Dr. Moses said. Dr. Moses had one prescription. He kept them all well. I'm the Lord that healed all thy diseases. That's the only prescription he used. And it worked on every case. say that's a good thing for a doctor to pack in his briefcases. &gt;&gt; I'm the Lord who heal all night. That's what Moses used. And he kept uh people alive for 40 years and not a feeble one among them. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Because he used God's word. You can't go wrong as long as you're using the word. Stay with the word. Now God said to Abraham, "Take your little boy out there and I'll show you a mountain and you go up on this mountain and kill him." Now what if Abraham said, "Now wait a minute. Was that vision true?" Let me study. Was that vision true? Now God said, "Take my boy and kill him." Now how am I ever going to be the father of nations? And that's my seat and that's the promise. How? How am I ever going to be the father of nation when God is destroying the only hope I have here? Is that the only hope I have? No. I still got his word. He promised me back there that he'd do it. And through Isaac, all the world would be blessed. So said, I listen to Abraham now. I received him as one from the dead. I'm persuaded that God's able to raise him up from the dead. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Even with a horse throat, I feel religious. &gt;&gt; Sure. Abraham said, "If I received him as one from the dead," what? The seed in his own body was dead, 100 years old. The deadness of Sarah's womb, they were both sterile to begin with. And then if God performed a miracle and put this germ of life in there, he received him from the dead as one being dead. Then God's able to raise him up from the dead. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Perfect type of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Oh my. That would make Presbyterian shout. &gt;&gt; Think of that. Certainly. Abraham stared not at the promises of God through unbelief, but was strong giving praise to him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I can imagine it was on Sunday afternoon when he spoke to him. on Monday morning. How's he going to do? Poor little Isaac. He looks at him. Oh, he loves him. But I can't look at that. I got to think of obeying God. So he couldn't tell Sarah cuz you know the ladies are the weake of the vessel. So he sometimes you had to watch. So I I can't tell Sarah cuz she wouldn't understand. Sarah never was too strong anyhow in the faith because she lacked. She didn't believe the promise. But Abraham held her because the man and woman are one. The woman cannot be saved in the Old Testament only by the man because it was circumcision and she had to be joined to her husband in order to receive it. But in the last days, God poured out his spirit and the women are circumcised in the heart. Just like the man now, but she believed her husband and called him Lord. So he said, "Now I can't I I can't tell Sarah." So he maybe say Sarah, Isaac and I are going to take a little trip. We'll be back. How are we coming back? God's able. If he said so, he'll bring us back. That's good. So he saddles up a mule the next morning, cut some wood, laid it on the mule's back. He's going out in the desert. And now look, he walked three days. And at the end of the three days, he lifted up his eyes and saw the mountain where God showed him in the vision way off. I watched an ordinary man ought to walk 25 miles a day. When I was patrolling for 5 years, I walked 35 miles a day through the woods, 10 hours, year in and year out. And today while man's got gasoline feet nearly and could do that what could a man days who only transportation he had nearly was either by a little slow mu or he could out walk himself nearly so only way he had was travel by foot and now Abraham let's say he walked 25 miles a day and he was 75 miles back now and he lifted up his eyes and perhaps maybe another 25 to 30 mi away. He saw the narrow said, "Yep, that's the one God showed me the vision." Now he said to the servants, the boys is with him. Listen to this now. He said, "You all tried here. While the boy and I go yonder to worship, the boy and I will return. Oh my. What? With a knife in his belt and in his heart to do the will of God was going to kill his own son. You wait here. The boy and I are going yonder to worship. The boy and I will return. How? He know God would keep his word somewhere. On they go up to the top of the mountain. Now watch. When he got to the mountain, he took all this wood and laid it on Isaac's back. Wonder why he done all those things? Because he was a figure of Christ. Isaac packed the wood up the hill that he himself was the sacrifice to lay on. Christ packed the cross up the hill where he the sacrifice is to be laid on. Abraham shadow of God the father given his only begotten son for our sins. Abraham was giving his only son for uh obedience to God. Notice now as he go up the hill, Abraham packing the fire. And when he got up there, he said, "Father," he said, "Here I am." He said, "Here is the wood and here is the fire. Here is the altar, but where is the lamb for the sacrifice? Oh, could you imagine that father's heart pumping hard? His only child. Where is the sacrifice? Abraham choking back the tears. Think of your own self. Choking back the tears. Well, let's turn and look towards heaven. He said, "My son, God will provide for himself a lamb for the sacrifice." Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not emotional much, but that just gets me. God will provide for himself a sacrifice or a lamb for the sacrifice. So, turn around, Isaac. Turn your back to me, son. He did. Isaac thought, "What's this? It's leather cards taking my hands. Surely father understands what he's doing. Around his feet, went some cards, tied him together. He looked over. Abraham, looked at him, brushed back the hair out of his eyes, kissed him on the cheek. God be with you, my son. Laid him up on the altar, looked back, choking back the tears. Little Isaac, obedient to death, not asked him a question. Abraham pulled a big knife from his the sheath from the knife from the sheath, brushed back the hair away from his little neck, looked up to God and started to take the life of his own son. Just as he raised his hand, the Holy Ghost called his handb for I know now that you love me, not even to spare your own son. And about that time, oh God, a sacrifice bladed. A little ram, not a female, not a yo, a ram was caught in the wilderness by his homeworks. What was it Jehovah Gi had provided of him? Where'd that lamb come from? Where did that lamb come from, friends? You know what it was? Well, he was 100 miles from civilization. Where did it come from? Besides that, he's way up on top of the mountain where there's no water. Where did it come from? It wasn't a vision. hour. He took the ram, loosed Isaac, his son, laid the ram up, and cut it short, and blood run out of it. It was a real ram, not a myth, neither a vision. It was a real ram. What was it? The God that I spoke to the other night had brought himself down in flesh, had brought a ram there. &gt;&gt; Jehovah Gyra had provided a ram for the sacrifice. I say to you this afternoon, my Christian friend, that Jehovah Gyra, still exist. &gt;&gt; And that's lamb which was a type of the Lord Jesus Christ that came down from glory, made itself a little lower than angels to suffer death for all. Has provided for everything that you have need of this afternoon, and has provided for your salvation. He's providing for your healing. And besides that, he said, "I'll not leave you. I'll pray to the father and he'll send you another comforter, which is the Holy Ghost. He will abide with you forever. And the things that I do shall you also, even more than this, for I go to my father." &gt;&gt; Jehovah Jalai has provided a sacrifice this afternoon for your sin. Jehovah Gyra has provided the same lamb this afternoon for your sickness. Can you believe it? And will you believe it? When Jesus is here on earth, he said, "A little while and the world won't see me no more because I come from God spirit." And now I in the world a little while. And now I go back to God. Then I'll come again and be with you in the form of the Holy Ghost in you to the end of the world. And he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also. Now he shared God has provided a way for you. God's provided a sacrifice. He's Jehovah Jarai who provided for Abraham carried through. And you are the seed of Abraham as long as you're in Christ Jesus. You are the seed of Abraham. And you're hes of the same promise by the same God only in a more positive way than Abraham was. You got about 2,800 years of experiences to look back through others and see what he's done. And if the Old Testament provided that, how much better did the new covenant a better thing that we without them would not be made perfect or them without us rather would not be made perfect. God has provided. I trust that you will believe it with all your heart as we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank God for his word tonight. Amen. So nice. Um, Sister Mother Wheeler passed on just a while ago and um, I got this news from brother Chris. So, we want to keep the Wheeler family in prayer. So, remember them. Very special request. First Corinthians chapter 11. as we go to the table of the Lord and um stand with me in verse number 23. The brothers can help move the altar in I guess you'll plan to do that appropriate time. Thank you. Let's sing a chorus of Amazing Grace. [Music] Secret grace the sound that [Music] I [Music] was lost. But now, [Music] but now I see. &gt;&gt; Can we lift our hands and just praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Praise Lord. We give you praise tonight. We worship you Lord in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; It's still over Gyra. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Amen. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread, when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me. And after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you to show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily, eateth and drinkkeeth, damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chasened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore my brethren, when you come together to eat, one for another. If any man hunger, let him eat at home, that you come not together unto condemnation, and the rest will I set in order when I come. Amen. This is one of the orders that the Apostle Paul was bringing to the church. He brought order to the communion service. I like how he says to be chasened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. And every time we hear the word of God, it is chasening us, sharpening us, and making us ready for that soon rapture. Amen. So, let us t one for another. You pray for me, I'll pray for you. Um, many times I would take this service over to Mother Wheeler, Sister Jackie. I go right into their home, read this little service, and have a communion service for them. And for the few months. I haven't been able to go and do that, but I believe she continued. Brother Dan Evans would go and she was just a witness of she couldn't get up and leave from the house, but she held on as a believer. It was so sweet to see her and served the communion to her. Sometimes I would sing one song and she would always say, "I don't know why I'm still here." should always be talking like that for years. Well, now she's gone on to get her reward. We believe. Amen. And so, let's t one for another as we bow our head in silent prayer. Heavenly Father, in my hands I hold this bread that was made for this service and we consecrated it, Lord, by asking your blessing on it. Lord, we know that it's just the ingredients from the grain to the bread. service, but it has a type and a meaning behind it. It's a type of your word. It's a type of your body. It's a type of the bitter price that was paid at Calvary. Lord, as we partake of it tonight, we know that it represents your body. It's just a representation. And you commanded us to do it until you call us home. And you said in that great kingdom, in the land in the millennium, in the great wedding supper, we would eat and drink of the vine over there. But Lord, until we come, you told us to tar. And this bread is made for that service that you commanded us. Lord, we just want to be obedient. We ask that you'll bless everyone that would take their hand down to pick this up and put it in their body. And may they be putting in more of the obedience to your word in their spirit. May they receive the blessings of that. May they receive the strength that comes from the word of God. It's our prayer shows to the believers that we believe every word now. Blessed father in Jesus name. Amen. Heavenly Father, in my hands I hold the cup of the New Testament of your blood. It's the blood of the grapes. It represents your body. It represents your blood tonight. And we ask that you would bless it. May everyone that partake, Lord, receive the blessings that comes with being obedient to your word. We know this is divine healing. We know that this is a promise. And father, may each one receive that blessing, not just a ritual. Lord, let it be life to us. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless. You may be seated. Follow the directions of the ushers. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Amen. This portion of bread will be burned with fire before the rising of the sun. Amen. Let's all stand and take our Bibles. Turn to St. John chapter 13. Verse number two. The supper being ended, the devil helmet now put into the heart of Judas the Scariot, Simon's son, to betray him. Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands, that he was come from God, and he went to God. He riseth from supper, laid aside his garments. He took a towel and girded himself. Let's read al together verse number five all the way through. And after that he pou water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter. And Peter said unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter? Peter saith unto him, "Thou shalt never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me." Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus said to him, "He that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet, but is clean every wit, and ye are clean, but not all. for he knew who should betray him. Therefore said he, "Ye are not all clean." So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, "Know ye what I have done to you. You call me Master and Lord, and ye say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If you know these things, happy are ye if you do them. Amen. Thank God for the reading of his word. It's so nice to hear the voices read the word of God. Amen. Just a closer walk with thee. Let's sing a little bit of that. I am weak, but thou are strong. Jesus [Music] keep me from all and I'll be satisfied as long as I walk. Let me along close to thee. Oh, just close with thee. Hallelujah.
