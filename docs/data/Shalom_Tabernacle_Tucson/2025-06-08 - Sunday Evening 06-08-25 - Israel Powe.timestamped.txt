[9:29] life. But I know in whom I have
[9:34] believed and he knows my name.

[21:21] name, Jesus.
[21:24] [Music]
[21:25] How I love to praise your
[21:30] name,
[21:32] Jesus. You're still the first, the last,
[21:36] the
[21:38] same. Oh
[21:41] Jesus, you died and took away my shame.
[21:47] You're the
[21:49] sweetest, the sweetest name of all. And
[21:53] you're the soon and coming
[21:56] king,
[21:59] Jesus. You're the soon and coming
[22:04] king. Lord
[22:08] Jesus, we need the love that you can
[22:13] bring. Oh
[22:16] Jesus, we lift our voices up and sing.
[22:23] You're the sweetest. Let's stand and
[22:25] sing that verse one more time as the
[22:27] deacons come for the offering. You're
[22:29] the soon and coming king,
[22:34] Jesus. You're the soon and coming
[22:40] king.
[22:43] Jesus, we need the love that you can
[22:47] bring.
[22:49] Oh
[22:52] Jesus, we lift our voices up and
[22:57] sing. You're the
[23:00] sweetest, the sweetest name of
[23:06] all. Do we have any prayer requests with
[23:08] Joe?
[23:12] Amen.
[23:15] Amen. Amen. We we had a big list of
[23:18] prayer requests this morning and just
[23:20] touch on a few right now. First is a
[23:22] praise
[23:23] report from Nash Silva. All pain went
[23:27] away. Praise the Lord. Wonderful. Amen.
[23:29] We're thankful for that.
[23:31] Let's just continue to remember brother
[23:33] Bobby Figueroa, Sister Lorie Snow,
[23:36] Brother Snow, Fred Fasil from the
[23:39] Sacramento Church, Brother
[23:41] Tovar from the Phoenix area, of course,
[23:44] Brother
[23:45] Israel, Brother John as he's recovering,
[23:49] the musicians, the
[23:51] travelers, or just pray generally for
[23:54] everyone, each of us together, for one
[23:57] another. Amen. Let us bow our
[24:00] hearts. Father God, we're thankful that
[24:02] you take our burdens and our cares.
[24:05] Thankful, Lord, that you have your hand
[24:07] upon those that we have been lifting up
[24:10] before you. Father, you said the prayer
[24:13] of faith would save the sick and the
[24:16] Lord would raise them up. Father, we
[24:19] also know that we're to do just one
[24:22] thing, and that's believe.
[24:24] Father, it covers a lot, but Lord, we're
[24:28] not of those that draw back, but we
[24:29] believe unto the saving of the soul and
[24:32] body.
[24:33] Father, Lord, take this request, Lord,
[24:36] send thy mighty angels, Lord, where all
[24:39] may be in their homes, in their beds,
[24:42] whatever the situation is, Father, and
[24:45] just, Lord, give them a charge like,
[24:48] Father, a battery in a car. Help them to
[24:51] know, Father, that there's prayers being
[24:53] made for them. Encourage everyone,
[24:56] Father. Lord, we're just grateful to be
[24:59] able to be here and share burdens,
[25:01] Father, knowing that you care, Lord
[25:04] Jesus. Take all unbelief away from us,
[25:07] Lord, as we would hear the word of God
[25:09] tonight. Let us embrace it, Lord, with
[25:12] new revelation, Lord, new
[25:15] inspiration, and we'll give you all the
[25:17] praise and the glory for it. In the name
[25:19] of Jesus Christ, we ask it.
[25:23] Amen. You're the
[25:25] sweetest, the sweetest name of
[25:31] all. Yes,
[25:33] [Music]
[25:35] Jesus. How I love to praise your
[25:41] name, Jesus.
[25:44] You're still the first, the last, the
[25:49] same. Oh
[25:52] Jesus, you died and took away my shame.
[25:58] You're the
[26:00] sweetest, the sweetest name of
[26:05] all. Amen. You can be seated again.

[26:10] volume? Let's go to the key of G if we

[37:05] of the blood. We're not ashamed, oh God,
[37:08] to take a stand for you in this hour. I
[37:12] pray, Lord, you'll give us the courage
[37:16] that is needed to overcome right now.
[37:19] It's very dangerous and a lot of fear on
[37:22] every hand. But give us faith, Lord, to
[37:25] take a stand for you as our prayer. Oh
[37:28] God, bless us we pray. Thank you Jesus
[37:31] for this great opportunity. Lord
[37:34] remember the saints that are on the
[37:36] stream. Lord bless everyone. We ask in
[37:39] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless each
[37:43] of you this evening. We're happy to be
[37:46] in the house of the Lord with you again
[37:48] tonight. Amen. Aren't you happy to be
[37:51] here? Amen. Praise the Lord. I went over
[37:55] to the old building there on Broadway
[37:57] the other day and uh there is no
[38:00] building
[38:01] there and I just felt kind of funny
[38:04] sitting there and looking at that empty
[38:06] space but it's you know that's how life
[38:08] is. Time is like that. Nothing stays the
[38:11] same. You got to keep moving on. Amen.
[38:14] And so but I'm glad to be here tonight
[38:16] with you in this lovely place of
[38:18] worship. And we just like to go right
[38:20] into the word and uh continue from this
[38:24] morning just a little bit asking the
[38:27] Lord to help
[38:29] us. I want to take a scripture in
[38:32] Proverbs 28 and in Psalms
[38:37] 32. I certainly love talking about Rahab
[38:42] and what the Lord did for
[38:45] her and
[38:47] Ruth, two
[38:50] Gentiles, which that's all of us. I
[38:52] don't think there's any Jews in here.
[38:53] Any Hebrews? Any Jewish people? No. Huh?
[38:58] Brother Lazy. Yes. Brother Lazi's his
[39:00] mother was a Jew. But for us Gentiles,
[39:03] they represent us very well, don't they?
[39:07] In Proverbs
[39:10] 28, we'll take a
[39:14] scripture. I trust it'll be a blessing
[39:16] to you
[39:25] tonight. Verse
[39:27] number 13.
[39:30] He that coverth his sins shall not
[39:33] prosper, but who so confessth and
[39:36] forsaketh them shall have
[39:40] mercy. He that coverth his sin shall not
[39:43] prosper, but who so confessth and
[39:46] forsaketh them shall have mercy. Let's
[39:51] take Psalms 32 just for a
[39:55] moment.
[40:05] Verse one. Blessed is he whose
[40:09] transgression is
[40:11] forgiven, whose sin is
[40:14] covered. Blessed is the man unto whom
[40:17] the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and
[40:20] whose spirit there is no guile. When I
[40:23] kept silence, my bones wax old through
[40:25] my roaring all the day long. For day and
[40:28] night, thy hand was heavy upon me. My
[40:32] moisture is turned into the drought of
[40:34] summer. Sa I acknowledge my sin unto
[40:38] thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid.
[40:42] I said, I will confess my transgressions
[40:46] unto the Lord, and thou forgavest the
[40:49] iniquity of my sin. Sa for this shall
[40:54] everyone that is godly pray unto thee in
[40:58] a time when thou mayest be found. Surely
[41:02] in the floods of great waters there
[41:04] shall not come nigh unto him. It goes on
[41:08] to the Lord being in his hiding place.
[41:11] Beautiful portions of scripture. If you
[41:13] hide your sin, you will not prosper. But
[41:15] then there is a there is a way for your
[41:18] sins to be covered and that is under the
[41:21] blood. That's through our confession. So
[41:25] we ask the Lord Jesus to bless us. God
[41:27] bless you. You may be
[41:29] seated. We ended
[41:32] with speaking on Ruth just a little bit
[41:36] and um talking about Rahab, of
[41:40] course. And we're in the book of
[41:42] Ephesians talking about our
[41:45] inheritance. Amen. And how that
[41:48] inheritance is what belongs to us. And
[41:53] we brought out to you that the position
[41:56] for the believer is a prayed up
[42:00] position. Just one little piece of the
[42:01] scripture is our portion to be prayed
[42:05] up. And the prophet brings out and the
[42:08] scriptures bring out this great
[42:10] inheritance. These are the things that
[42:13] belong to us. And um I read a few of
[42:17] those
[42:18] definitions, but it's
[42:21] um um a quality, a
[42:24] characteristic, a predisposition
[42:27] genetically from one parent or
[42:30] ancestors to receive or be left with.
[42:35] a situation, an object from a
[42:39] predecessor or former
[42:41] owner. It is to receive money, property,
[42:47] or a title as an heir at the death of a
[42:50] previous
[42:51] holder. And so these um positions and
[42:57] places in the scriptures that belong to
[42:59] the believer, we inherit those. We they
[43:04] belong to us as a believer. Amen. And
[43:07] these are the heavenly places that the
[43:09] scriptures are speaking of. The apostle
[43:12] Paul is trying to show us and brother
[43:15] Brandham is bringing to us that Joshua
[43:17] was a type of the Holy Spirit. And I
[43:21] like how he says it in the message the
[43:25] adoption.
[43:26] He says this here in adoption number
[43:32] two, paragraph
[43:34] 19. The prophet says, "Then did you
[43:38] notice Moses, the great miracle
[43:39] performer that brought down Israel down
[43:42] through the land and brought them up to
[43:44] the promised land, but did not place
[43:47] their inheritance to
[43:50] them." He did not give them their
[43:52] inheritance. He led them up to the land,
[43:54] but Joshua divided the land to the
[43:57] people. Is that right? And Christ
[44:00] brought the church up to the place to
[44:02] where their possession was made to them,
[44:05] was given to them, just the Jordan to
[44:07] cross. But the Holy Spirit is the one
[44:10] who sets the church in order. The Joshua
[44:14] of today puts the church in its order,
[44:18] giving to each one gifts, places,
[44:21] position, and he is the voice of God
[44:25] speaking through the inner man that
[44:29] Christ has saved the Holy Spirit. Now,
[44:33] do you get that much of it? Now, we're
[44:35] getting over in the book of Ephesians.
[44:38] Now the same way he
[44:40] positionally places placing the church
[44:43] where they belong. Now Joshua placed
[44:46] them in the natural land. Now the Holy
[44:50] Spirit is placing the church
[44:54] positionally in the land that they in
[44:57] the position that they belong in their
[45:00] inheritance. So who's doing the placing
[45:02] here? Is it the pastor?
[45:06] Is it yourself?
[45:08] Is it someone else? Some great person.
[45:11] No, it's the Holy Spirit.
[45:14] And I think if we came with that motive
[45:17] and knowing that it's the Holy Spirit
[45:19] that's trying to persuade you one way or
[45:23] the other, we might approach our service
[45:26] a little different and the vessels that
[45:29] God may use in bringing you the word of
[45:33] the Lord. It is not your pastor trying
[45:36] to do anything to you. It is the Holy
[45:40] Spirit that is trying to place you in
[45:44] the position according to the
[45:46] scriptures. And it's so beautiful that
[45:49] he speaks to the inner man. He speaks
[45:52] within that inner man to place that
[45:54] believer. It's the Holy Spirit that
[45:56] wants you to find your place. Amen.
[46:02] Now we know that Israel their position
[46:05] in the scripture was they went from
[46:07] Egypt then the wilderness and then into
[46:10] Canaan land. Three stages of the
[46:12] journey. So we the believer that are in
[46:14] Christ. We're not in Egypt. We're not in
[46:17] the wilderness. We represent Israel in
[46:20] Canaan land. Here we are now fighting
[46:25] for the blessings that God has given to
[46:28] us.
[46:29] It's not heaven. It's not the
[46:32] millennium. It's Canaan land. We're
[46:35] fighting for a position. We're fighting
[46:38] for our loved ones. Fighting for the
[46:42] Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit for all
[46:44] of the great things that take place in
[46:46] our life. The Holy Spirit, the Christian
[46:49] is in that battle. And the only thing
[46:53] that would hinder us from attaining and
[46:56] achieving is sin in our lives. Is that
[46:59] right? It's the unbelief that would
[47:02] cause us to falter. As we've been
[47:04] bringing to you the last couple of
[47:06] times, sin is unbelief. Now, here what
[47:10] brother Adam says in the message
[47:11] Perseverance
[47:13] 1964, paragraph number 94. And he says
[47:16] this here very clearly. A real Christian
[47:20] fights for his position. He has to stand
[47:24] alone, him and God. And he fights every
[47:28] inch of ground. So you don't have to
[47:31] baby them around. That's what's the
[47:33] matter with the Pentecostal church
[47:34] today. We got Pentecostal babies that
[47:38] just been sprinkled and sprayed with
[47:40] this and that and the other till it's
[47:42] run out to a bunch of hybrids. What we
[47:45] need today is a house cleaning from the
[47:47] pull pit all the way to the janitor and
[47:50] starting over again and get some genuine
[47:53] faith born into people. Yeah. And
[47:56] brother Madam continues on um that this
[48:00] is the Christian's position that we
[48:03] fight for our position that we're not
[48:05] babies and we fight for every inch of
[48:08] ground. Nothing is going to be given to
[48:10] us for free. Amen.
[48:13] The Holy Spirit moving in our midst,
[48:16] moving in our lives has to be a fight.
[48:19] We're going to fight for that. Not going
[48:21] to be given to us. And this is what we
[48:24] do. And this is what the true believer
[48:27] does. He finds
[48:30] himself seeing himself in the word of
[48:33] God. He takes the extra time to pray, to
[48:37] study, to search out the scriptures to
[48:41] see where he may be weak or may be
[48:45] faltering. Uh the true believer is
[48:48] really concerned that they're walking in
[48:50] the perfect will of God. Amen. That's
[48:53] the true believer. And we are trying
[48:55] with all of our heart knowing that it's
[48:57] the end time knowing that there's a
[49:00] great promise of a great power to surge
[49:04] and take the church home. It's mentioned
[49:07] in many different ways. The gift, signs,
[49:09] wonders, miracles. But yet even the
[49:11] third pull, the manifestation of the
[49:14] last day move of God that is going to
[49:18] happen saints that is in the word is
[49:21] very clear. I want to be part of that.
[49:25] And I believe the group that's prayed up
[49:27] will be a part of it. There'll be a lot
[49:30] of churches filled and people sitting
[49:32] doing whatever they've been doing,
[49:34] church normal, church usual. But there's
[49:36] a true bride of Jesus Christ that
[49:39] they're reading the message again.
[49:41] They're reading their Bible again.
[49:44] They're taking it to heart and they're
[49:46] really believing God with all of their
[49:48] heart. And I believe that it starts
[49:50] right here. an oldfashioned Sunday night
[49:54] service starts on a Wednesday prayer
[49:57] starts on the Sunday morning starts
[50:00] right there that this believer is
[50:03] finding his position. Now I read this
[50:05] scripture in Proverbs and in
[50:08] Psalms talking about he that hideth his
[50:11] sins will not prosper. You know, this is
[50:16] where this great man Achin comes into
[50:21] play. Um, we'll take a scripture here
[50:24] just for a moment and it's found in the
[50:28] book of Joshua, the last chapter of
[50:39] Joshua, I believe it's 22.
[50:45] in verse number 20.
[51:04] Yes. And these are the children of
[51:07] Israel. They were upset with Dan and uh
[51:13] the halft tribe of Manasseh and um
[51:16] another tribe Gad I believe it
[51:18] is. And uh because they had erect
[51:22] erected an altar on the other side of
[51:25] Jordan. If you remember that was the
[51:27] agreement that they would help Israel
[51:30] uh uh possess the land in Canaan land.
[51:34] But they were cattle farmers and they
[51:37] had a little better spot on the other
[51:39] side of Jordan. And their agreement was
[51:43] that they would help their brethren
[51:44] fright and get their property and then
[51:46] they would go back. Well, they went
[51:47] back. And when they went back, they
[51:49] wanted to erect an altar there. And when
[51:51] they did, it made all the other Hebrews,
[51:55] the Israelites, upset. And the reason
[51:58] they got upset is this man aching him.
[52:02] They bring him up. Now he's already dead
[52:04] and gone. And they bring up the sin of
[52:08] Bel Pora, how that angered the Lord. And
[52:12] then they bring up this sin of Achen in
[52:15] verse 20. And it says this says, "Did
[52:17] not Achen the son of Zarah commit a
[52:20] trespass in these thing? And wrath fell
[52:24] on all the congregation of Israel? and
[52:27] that man perished not alone in his
[52:32] iniquity. And so it made them quite
[52:35] aware
[52:37] of not just our sins but other sins. And
[52:41] and this is probably one of the points
[52:44] that I want to bring out tonight is
[52:46] that, you know, it's one thing if you do
[52:48] wrong, but if you cause someone else to
[52:51] stumble,
[52:54] don't you feel like that's another level
[52:57] of crime against God?
[53:00] I mean, if I if if you decide you didn't
[53:03] believe or you decided you didn't like
[53:05] it and you wanted to move a certain way
[53:08] and go a certain way with how you're
[53:09] going to do whatever you decide to do.
[53:13] But then I told you if you do that and
[53:16] that's your choice to do that. But if
[53:17] you do that, here's a list of people
[53:20] that's you're going to hurt. You are
[53:22] going to hurt them if you do that. And
[53:25] it brings in another level of
[53:27] responsibility.
[53:29] So these Hebrews, these Jews when they
[53:33] saw Dan and this tribe doing this, they
[53:37] are well aware what happened at Belor.
[53:39] How many people died at that sin? And
[53:43] here is Achin now, the son of Achin, son
[53:46] of Zimry, son of I forget his Corser or
[53:49] Zim. He was of the tribe of Judah. He
[53:52] committed a trespass. And the sin that
[53:55] he committed, I mean, you think I mean,
[53:59] he just he really didn't hurt anybody
[54:01] personally. He just stole a piece of
[54:04] gold and he stole a little Babylonian
[54:07] garment and he hid it to
[54:10] himself. It was a secret sin that he
[54:12] covered to himself and no one else knew
[54:15] about it. And the Lord saw it. Of
[54:18] course, many of the Israel did not see
[54:21] it. Obviously, they didn't see it
[54:23] because they go on in the battle to take
[54:26] Ai and then 36 men lose their life
[54:29] because of this sin. And when Joshua
[54:32] wasn't aware, Joshua says, "Lord, what's
[54:34] going on? We've never lost a battle.
[54:37] We've never lost a man. What's going on
[54:40] here?" So, he goes and he goes to the
[54:42] Lord. He says, "Lord, what's it going to
[54:44] be when the nations begin to hear that
[54:47] we really can't
[54:49] fight? we really don't have a defense
[54:52] like we thought we did. And the and the
[54:54] Lord says, Joshua, don't don't come at
[54:56] don't come at me that way. The only
[54:59] reason why you got problems is because
[55:02] something is wrong in your church
[55:05] now. And the Lord knew who they were,
[55:06] but he says, "You go find him. You go
[55:10] figure it out and go through the
[55:11] discipline of running through the camp
[55:13] and finding out what's going on here cuz
[55:15] something is wrong." Amen. And so they
[55:18] go through that and they take the tribes
[55:20] and the tribe was taken. The tribe of
[55:21] Judah was taken and then this family was
[55:23] taken and then it's narrowing down. I
[55:26] wonder what Achen was doing all that
[55:28] time. It's like are they going to catch
[55:29] me?
[55:31] You know you're the sinner. And and
[55:33] here's the thing. If Achen did that
[55:36] wrong, and we all do wrong. If Achen
[55:39] came back from Jericho after doing
[55:43] wrong, making it in his mind to do what
[55:46] was wrong, but then somehow he comes to
[55:48] himself, he says, "You know what? You
[55:49] did wrong. You need to go make that
[55:51] right." Now, if he would have went and
[55:54] made it
[55:55] right, I believe the Lord would have had
[55:57] a place for him. I believe the Lord
[56:00] would have forgave
[56:01] him. But they moved on into another
[56:05] battle and another campaign with this
[56:07] sin. and he let the armies go forward
[56:10] and he wasn't even and and he and he let
[56:12] it all take place and he was hiding this
[56:15] sin. It's called the unconfessed sin.
[56:19] It's called the secret
[56:22] sin. How many of you ever had
[56:25] one? Let's be real. Let's be honest.
[56:29] Let's be clear. It's a temptation for us
[56:33] to hide our sin. When we've done wrong,
[56:37] it's very difficult for a man to stand
[56:39] up and say, "I was wrong.
[56:43] Please forgive me."
[56:45] But it is necessary for every man,
[56:49] woman, boy, or girl. If you're a
[56:51] Christian, you've got to come to that
[56:53] place to say, "I was wrong. Amen. I made
[56:57] the wrong judgment.
[56:59] I was wrong. I was
[57:02] greedy. I was wrong. I did that. was
[57:05] wrong. Please forgive
[57:09] me. That's a part of your heritage.
[57:12] Sage Achen did wrong. And if he would
[57:15] have confessed it, he probably would
[57:17] have found some grace and we could have
[57:20] spared your family. We could have spared
[57:22] these 36 men. So let's say there's 40 to
[57:26] 45 people, innocent people that died
[57:30] because one
[57:35] man did that which was wrong.
[57:39] Now, brother Brandham brings this up in
[57:41] the adoption message and he says this
[57:45] about
[57:46] Achen about the unconfessed sin and he
[57:49] says
[57:50] this why this needs to be taught. He
[57:54] says it in the adoption number
[57:56] one 1960 brother Brandham says this
[57:59] paragraph number 53 and now after you
[58:02] are in that don't mean that you're out
[58:06] free from war you still have to fight
[58:08] for every inch of ground you stand on.
[58:11] So see, Canaan did not represent the
[58:13] great heaven because war, troubles,
[58:16] killings, fightings, and so forth. But
[58:18] it did represent this that it must be a
[58:21] perfect
[58:22] walk. There's where the church is
[58:25] failing today on that walk. Do you know
[58:29] that even your own behavior can knock
[58:32] somebody else out of getting healed?
[58:36] Your misbehavior of unconfessed sins of
[58:39] you believers can cause this church to
[58:43] bitterly fail. And at the day of
[58:46] judgment, you'll be responsible for
[58:49] every bit of it. Oh, you say, "Now wait
[58:52] a minute, brother Bannon." Well, that's
[58:53] the truth. Think of it. Joshua after he
[58:56] crossed over into the land, God gave him
[58:59] the promise, just think, to fight an
[59:01] entire campaign without losing a man,
[59:04] without even getting a scratch, without
[59:06] having to have a nurse, a first aid, a
[59:09] band. Amen. God said, "The land's yours.
[59:13] Go fight." Think of fighting a campaign
[59:16] and there's no Red Cross around at all.
[59:20] There's nobody going to get
[59:23] hurt. and they slay the ammorites and
[59:26] the Hittites, but there wasn't one heard
[59:28] among any of them until sin come in the
[59:31] camp. And when Achen took the Babylonian
[59:34] garment and that gold wedge, hid it
[59:37] under his camp, then the next day they
[59:39] lost 16 men, Joshua said, "Stop. Stop.
[59:44] Wait a minute. There's something wrong.
[59:47] Something wrong here. We're going to
[59:48] call the seven-day fast. God made us a
[59:52] promise. There will be nothing hurt us.
[59:54] Our enemies fall at our feet. There's
[59:56] something wrong here. Something went
[59:57] wrong somewhere cuz we got 16 dead men
[1:00:01] laying here. They're Israelite brothers
[1:00:04] and they're
[1:00:06] dead now.
[1:00:10] So, pretty striking, isn't it? The
[1:00:13] secret sin. What's the secret sin? It's
[1:00:15] the unconfessed
[1:00:17] sin. It's even the sin that you know you
[1:00:20] should make something right and you
[1:00:21] don't.
[1:00:25] It's easier to easier to to, you know,
[1:00:28] we're going to bump into each other all
[1:00:29] the time. We're going to, you know,
[1:00:31] we're going to we're going to say
[1:00:32] something, do something, you know,
[1:00:34] mishandle something. We're human beings.
[1:00:37] I don't know. Last time I checked, I
[1:00:39] haven't not any angels in this
[1:00:43] church from the pull pit all the way
[1:00:45] through. Even the little ones in the
[1:00:47] nursery, no angels here. We're going to
[1:00:49] make mistakes, aren't we?
[1:00:52] Yeah, but there's a way that we we
[1:00:53] handle those mistakes. We don't cover
[1:00:55] them. We don't act like it didn't
[1:00:58] happen. Huh? We actually we actually
[1:01:02] confess
[1:01:03] it and we keep the church clean that
[1:01:07] way. We keep our dealing with one
[1:01:10] another clean. We keep our attitudes
[1:01:12] clean as we approach one another because
[1:01:16] with that little wedge, it starts it
[1:01:18] starts to grow and it starts to
[1:01:20] animosity and funny feelings and then
[1:01:22] you start shunning a brother or sister
[1:01:25] or family and those little things they
[1:01:27] they uncover. And that's why we need to
[1:01:29] we need to confess those things and keep
[1:01:32] everything clear and clean before your
[1:01:36] brother and your sister. Amen.
[1:01:40] We don't want that. that there's enough
[1:01:41] challenges out there in the world and
[1:01:43] you don't come to church to build
[1:01:45] another grudge in the church. It's
[1:01:48] enough of those outside.
[1:01:51] Huh? We want it clear. We want it clean.
[1:01:54] And do you think Satan wants us all to
[1:01:57] stay clear and clean before one another?
[1:02:01] Do you think Satan wants us all to have
[1:02:04] the respect towards one another like we
[1:02:07] should? You think Satan is going to
[1:02:10] leave us alone just because we want to
[1:02:13] do better? He's not leaving you alone.
[1:02:16] He's on your track.
[1:02:19] He wants to get you involved in some
[1:02:23] kind of foolishness with brother or
[1:02:25] sister and then keep moving on like
[1:02:28] nothing happened.
[1:02:31] Unconfessed
[1:02:33] sins. And then there's the secret sins.
[1:02:38] You do those sins, you hide them, you
[1:02:42] don't make them right before the Lord,
[1:02:44] and you continue moving on. It is
[1:02:47] actually hurting other people when you
[1:02:48] do that. It's hurting this church. It's
[1:02:52] hurting your
[1:02:54] family. It's hurting your
[1:02:56] ministry. It's hurting your gift and
[1:02:59] your
[1:03:00] talent. Yes, we've seen a few places in
[1:03:04] the Bible. Remember when David numbered
[1:03:06] the people? He wanted to number Israel
[1:03:10] and find out how many people were in
[1:03:12] Israel. He numbered them. And his
[1:03:14] servant is is one of his chief captain
[1:03:16] says, "David, it's the heritage of the
[1:03:18] Lord. Why do this? Why are you want to
[1:03:21] know how many people are in there?
[1:03:23] You're not going for war. You're not
[1:03:25] asking for a census. It's you just want
[1:03:27] to know." And the Lord warned him.
[1:03:29] David, don't do this. He number them
[1:03:31] anyways. He numbered him and God got mad
[1:03:33] at him and began to strike the people of
[1:03:37] Israel. People started dying. It's like
[1:03:40] why? What's going on? What happened?
[1:03:42] David numbered the people. Well, other
[1:03:45] people were dying because of it. Yes.
[1:03:48] Then he had to go and make it right,
[1:03:50] didn't he? Remember there was a famine
[1:03:52] in the
[1:03:53] land. There was a a famine over the
[1:03:56] whole land there. And David intreated
[1:03:58] the Lord and says, "Lord, why is there a
[1:04:00] famine? We're not getting rain when
[1:04:02] we're supposed to get. And they went to
[1:04:04] the Lord and the Lord said, "There's
[1:04:07] some
[1:04:09] famine because the way you guys treated
[1:04:14] Saul, the way they buried him, the
[1:04:17] there's a group of people, they didn't
[1:04:18] bury him
[1:04:19] properly. These are enemies now." And
[1:04:22] David went to those enemies and found
[1:04:24] out and he says, "What can we do to make
[1:04:27] things right with you?" Because the Lord
[1:04:29] is holding it against, we're talking
[1:04:30] about Saul now. We're talking about a
[1:04:33] backsliding king,
[1:04:36] a king that didn't have the anointing
[1:04:38] and God is holding it over the entire
[1:04:41] nation. It's in a famine and a drought.
[1:04:43] And David says, "Lord, why? Why? What's
[1:04:45] the drought for?" The drought is because
[1:04:47] of what they did to Saul. Saul's people
[1:04:50] are are or this this enemy territory. I
[1:04:53] can't get it just right, but I can find
[1:04:55] it for you. It's very accurate. And then
[1:04:58] they go and make it right with these
[1:05:01] people and they take Saul's
[1:05:04] sons and go and deal with him properly
[1:05:07] and then the famine leaves. And so we
[1:05:09] see these cases. Joshua, Caleb, all of
[1:05:13] Israel had to go through the land 40
[1:05:15] extra years because the people wasn't
[1:05:18] ready. And here is Achin's sin that he
[1:05:22] kept hid a secret sin. I'll ask it one
[1:05:26] more time. Don't answer it, but just
[1:05:28] think about the question and the answer.
[1:05:31] Have you ever had a secret sin that you
[1:05:35] kept
[1:05:36] hid and you kept
[1:05:39] covered and you had to hide it and you
[1:05:41] can't talk about it because it's a sin
[1:05:43] and you know it's a sin and it's not
[1:05:45] right and you kept it covered. You know
[1:05:47] that thing will bind you up. You can't
[1:05:50] praise the Lord properly. That's right.
[1:05:52] No, you can't. You can't really even go
[1:05:55] forward with the Lord properly with a
[1:05:59] secret sin, an uncovered sin, a sin
[1:06:02] that's been
[1:06:03] unconfessed. But it's so nice when the
[1:06:05] Lord makes an opportunity for you to
[1:06:07] uncover that sin and then you're set
[1:06:11] free. I'm reminded of
[1:06:14] this when I was in Liberia. One of the
[1:06:17] brothers there, brother Amos, he's from
[1:06:18] Nigeria, young minister, and he he gives
[1:06:22] a testimony of a young man in their
[1:06:25] church. This young man was working for a
[1:06:29] uh a particular boss and this boss had
[1:06:34] caught him, a supervisor had caught him
[1:06:38] stealing chicken from from the job
[1:06:42] there. And so he the supervisor told
[1:06:47] this this boy, you know, that was wrong
[1:06:50] what you did. He said, "Yeah, it's
[1:06:51] wrong." He says, "Please, please don't
[1:06:52] rat me out. Don't tell on me." And so
[1:06:54] fine, I won't tell on you, but you got
[1:06:56] to do me some favors. And so this
[1:06:59] supervisor had this guy doing all kind
[1:07:01] of little favors, extras for him. And
[1:07:05] when the guy wanted to resist it, it
[1:07:06] says, "No, no, that's not fair." He just
[1:07:09] say, "Chicken.
[1:07:13] And we say no more. Okay, I got to do
[1:07:15] it. Had him under the gun like that. And
[1:07:19] it it kept kept like a like a puppet. It
[1:07:21] was playing this kid. And every time he
[1:07:24] you know he wanted him to do some kind
[1:07:26] of favor and the guy resist says no
[1:07:28] that's not fair. Say
[1:07:30] chicken. They mean I'm going to go tell
[1:07:32] the boss about that chicken that you
[1:07:36] stole. And he hung her down. He hung
[1:07:38] down and one day he ended up talking to
[1:07:41] someone and told him about, "You know
[1:07:43] what? You need to just make that right
[1:07:45] with the
[1:07:47] boss." So one day he mustered up the
[1:07:49] courage and he goes into the boss's
[1:07:52] office because he was act he was
[1:07:54] actually a Christian. I get the story
[1:07:57] right now. He was a believer and he was
[1:08:00] working on this job and it was just it
[1:08:01] would have just been so you know
[1:08:04] embarrassing for him as a believer to be
[1:08:07] caught doing such a thing. So he tried
[1:08:08] to keep it hidden. So this this
[1:08:10] unbeliever had him under the gun that
[1:08:13] way. And finally he heard the message in
[1:08:15] the church service about making
[1:08:17] everything right and making everything
[1:08:19] clear and clean and just making it
[1:08:21] right. So he goes to his boss. It was
[1:08:23] one of the hardest things he had to do.
[1:08:25] But he confessed to stealing. I mean,
[1:08:28] it's a dirty bird
[1:08:31] anyways. But look how Satan is playing
[1:08:33] the game over him over a piece of meat
[1:08:37] that you
[1:08:40] stole. And he goes and he confesses to
[1:08:43] the boss. And the boss tells him, "You
[1:08:45] know what? I'm so glad you told me that.
[1:08:47] We're we're square. We're good. It's
[1:08:49] fine. You're not fired. You'll keep your
[1:08:52] job. I I I appreciate that. And so he's
[1:08:56] cleared up with the boss. All the chains
[1:08:58] is off of him. And this supervisor came
[1:09:01] to him and tried to run that threat over
[1:09:04] him again. He says, "Chicken," he says,
[1:09:07] "It's all been taken care of now. No
[1:09:11] more holds on me."
[1:09:14] And when you have a secret sin, that's
[1:09:17] from this pew and that's where all the
[1:09:19] pews going in the back. And this one
[1:09:21] going all the way in the back. And even
[1:09:22] the ones on the stream, I think they're
[1:09:24] over here
[1:09:26] tonight. There's an unconfessed sin. You
[1:09:28] can't be free.
[1:09:32] Can somebody help me preach?
[1:09:35] What do you got to do? How do you deal
[1:09:37] with an unconfessed sin? You confess it.
[1:09:41] You go make it right. And then when you
[1:09:44] make it right, now you're free. You're
[1:09:46] clear. You're clean.
[1:09:49] your conscience is clear. And Achen, if
[1:09:52] he would have confessed it, he would
[1:09:54] have gone on with the
[1:09:56] Lord. But he did not confess it. He
[1:09:58] tried to hide it. And he caused other
[1:10:01] men to die because of it. And this is
[1:10:03] the seriousness of what's taking place
[1:10:06] here. Now, the prophet tells us this is
[1:10:10] the reason why this needs to be taught.
[1:10:14] Did I read that already?
[1:10:16] There's a reason why this needs to be
[1:10:21] taught. We're failing on that walk. And
[1:10:25] brother Bannon goes forward in that and
[1:10:28] tells us these things. Let's take the
[1:10:30] message as I was with Moses paragraph 60
[1:10:34] 1960 paragraph 116. Now what a great
[1:10:37] leader Joshua became. Never losing a
[1:10:39] battle less something went wrong in the
[1:10:41] church. When Achen took a wedge, it
[1:10:44] wasn't
[1:10:45] Joshua's faith that did it. It was he
[1:10:48] took a Babylonian garment, a wedge of
[1:10:51] gold out of the camp. And when he did,
[1:10:52] it hindered the whole
[1:10:55] battle. One member suffers, all members
[1:11:00] suffer. What God is coming to one of
[1:11:03] these days, brother, is a church without
[1:11:06] spot or wrinkle. He's coming to a
[1:11:09] spiritfilled church that divinely love
[1:11:12] of God so welded their hearts together
[1:11:15] that they walk as one.
[1:11:18] Amen. Presuming 1962, Achen thought this
[1:11:22] little old wedge, it won't make any
[1:11:24] difference. The rest of the ladies are
[1:11:26] cutting their hair. I'll do the same
[1:11:28] thing. It won't make any difference. But
[1:11:30] what did it do? It never brought
[1:11:32] pleasure to his family. It brought death
[1:11:36] to every one of them. And when we
[1:11:39] compromise on any commandment of God to
[1:11:41] please the people, we kill the the thing
[1:11:44] right there. One little wedge, one
[1:11:47] Babylonian garment, stop the marching
[1:11:51] army, brother. One thing that we permit
[1:11:54] the church to do that's wrong, one thing
[1:11:57] that we won't call out against and make
[1:12:00] the people straighten up, it'll stop the
[1:12:02] march of the
[1:12:04] church. Amen.
[1:12:08] How many wants to fight for your
[1:12:09] position?
[1:12:11] How many know that if Achen fails, we
[1:12:14] all fail?
[1:12:17] And if there's a sin in the camp, I'm
[1:12:19] not interested in it being covered.
[1:12:23] How about you?
[1:12:25] Well, I don't want to, you know, I don't
[1:12:26] want to say I don't want to, you know,
[1:12:28] it's got to be confessed. It's got to
[1:12:29] come out. It's got to come clean. I
[1:12:31] don't want it here. You don't want it
[1:12:33] here.
[1:12:35] Huh? Is that right, saints? That's a
[1:12:38] believer's position. And these other
[1:12:40] believers are now more accountable. So,
[1:12:43] when these brothers want to erect this
[1:12:45] altar, they needed a reason for it. cuz
[1:12:47] you already know what happened when
[1:12:49] Achen did what he
[1:12:51] did. This is that
[1:12:55] accountability that we all owe it to one
[1:12:58] another.
[1:13:00] They might say you're a little nosy.
[1:13:02] They might say you always in business.
[1:13:05] Stop asking so many questions, Brother
[1:13:07] John. Why are you checking up? Why are
[1:13:10] you looking to see who what I'm doing
[1:13:12] and where I'm going? Hey, hey, you're
[1:13:14] part of this group. You're part of my
[1:13:16] family.
[1:13:19] to mind your own business. You are my
[1:13:21] business.
[1:13:26] And it starts by me praying for you and
[1:13:29] having a burden for
[1:13:30] you. If I really care about you, I won't
[1:13:34] gossip about you. I'll come I'll pray
[1:13:37] for you and I'll come with come to you
[1:13:40] not with some funny feeling. I come to
[1:13:42] you with a scripture or some
[1:13:45] quotations that here brother sister
[1:13:48] maybe you don't know this but here want
[1:13:50] you read that and it might help you and
[1:13:54] that's between me and you that's it
[1:13:58] if I love you
[1:14:02] whole church doesn't need to know what
[1:14:03] we talked about
[1:14:06] huh
[1:14:08] no not if I really care if I really care
[1:14:11] the The only one that needs to know is
[1:14:12] you. I saw it on you. I saw you doing
[1:14:14] something. I saw some little behavior. I
[1:14:16] saw you and now not my responsibility to
[1:14:19] get on the phone and tell everybody
[1:14:20] else. I need to go to you and say,
[1:14:22] "Brother, maybe you're not aware,
[1:14:24] sister. Maybe you're not aware, but
[1:14:25] here's a little quotation. Here's here's
[1:14:27] a tape. Listen to this tape. Here's a
[1:14:30] few scriptures for you. Why don't you
[1:14:32] read those?"
[1:14:33] I think that's the right attitude.
[1:14:37] I think that's what believers do.
[1:14:40] I believe that's what the message
[1:14:42] supports
[1:14:44] is this kind of behavior right here
[1:14:46] because that's our
[1:14:48] inheritance and we stay with that
[1:14:52] inheritance. So we know it's the Holy
[1:14:53] Spirit placing us. It's God that giving
[1:14:56] us this ground and this position that we
[1:15:00] stay in. And then we see Achen how he
[1:15:03] compromised that with his secret sin.
[1:15:05] Now let's talk on this this ground in
[1:15:07] this position of the believer just for a
[1:15:09] moment as brother Bham gives an
[1:15:16] example as he got into
[1:15:20] Ruth and he talked
[1:15:23] about that minister that got off of his
[1:15:26] ministerial grounds.
[1:15:29] Look at this in the message kinsman
[1:15:35] redeemer. And anytime that a believer
[1:15:37] gets off of his god-given ground, many
[1:15:40] times in politics, this election coming
[1:15:42] up and so forth, a good man can be a
[1:15:46] good man and he'll wander off on those
[1:15:48] grounds like a certain minister I know
[1:15:52] run to be mayor of the city. And when he
[1:15:56] did, got off of his ministerial ground
[1:15:59] and Satan overtook him. If any Christian
[1:16:03] gets off of those grounds, well, I'll
[1:16:05] just go down tonight, sit with the boys
[1:16:07] in the pool room a while. I'll do no
[1:16:10] harm. I'll just take one little drink.
[1:16:13] You're off your ground. Come back.
[1:16:17] You're only setting your course for
[1:16:21] trouble. Oh, all the rest of the girls
[1:16:23] smoke. I'll just try one. You're off
[1:16:26] your grounds. Don't do that. Stay in the
[1:16:30] homelands. Well, everybody over here,
[1:16:32] they call me old folky. They call me
[1:16:34] oldfashioned. They stay here. Stay there
[1:16:37] anyhow. That's your place. Stay in
[1:16:41] Christ. Are you receiving that tonight?
[1:16:44] Are you Naomi? Because of the famine
[1:16:47] wandered out from the lands and went to
[1:16:49] Moab, finding bread. She didn't have to
[1:16:51] do that because the rest of them stayed
[1:16:54] in Judea, Bethlehem. Bethlehem means the
[1:16:58] Bethl house of God, house of praises.
[1:17:01] And they stayed there and she wandered
[1:17:02] away with her husband, her two sons,
[1:17:05] married a Moabitete girls. But if God
[1:17:07] has ordained something to be done, it'll
[1:17:11] happen anyhow. That's the reason I
[1:17:13] certainly believe in predestination,
[1:17:16] God's fornowledge of things. Then we
[1:17:19] find over there death struck the family.
[1:17:22] They started back. The boy died. Both
[1:17:25] boys died and the father died and Ruth
[1:17:27] started back. Oprah and
[1:17:30] Naomi. So, Brother Vanna was talking
[1:17:33] about minister getting off of those
[1:17:36] ministerial
[1:17:38] grounds. What about a believer?
[1:17:41] What about a a Jew is supposed to be in
[1:17:44] his homeland and sometimes they leave
[1:17:46] that homeland because there's greener
[1:17:48] territories or more opportunity in other
[1:17:51] places. But God promised to bless Israel
[1:17:54] in the promised land in the homeland.
[1:17:57] Stay there. When you leave from there,
[1:18:00] you're in a vulnerable position. The
[1:18:02] protection leaves you. And this is what
[1:18:04] this morning Boaz told Ruth. Stay in the
[1:18:08] field that I called you to. There's your
[1:18:11] protection. Stay with the original
[1:18:14] message that God has given to us. That's
[1:18:17] our protection. Amen. Amen. Stay with
[1:18:21] the Lord Jesus Christ. Stay with
[1:18:25] Christians.
[1:18:28] I know it's a temptation for young
[1:18:30] people to get caught up in some other
[1:18:35] friendships.
[1:18:37] It comes under the banner or the heading
[1:18:40] of a friend or a friendship or a
[1:18:42] co-orker or someone that is a nice
[1:18:45] person that you're familiar with. And
[1:18:48] this happens to old people too, not just
[1:18:50] young people. But you'll find yourself
[1:18:52] hanging out with people, you know, they
[1:18:56] maybe swear just a little bit, few curse
[1:18:58] words, few uh things that are contrary,
[1:19:01] and you get used to hearing
[1:19:05] it. We're not to just separate ourselves
[1:19:08] from them, but we we should approach
[1:19:10] those areas very prayed up. Very prayed
[1:19:14] up. you get into those atmospheres, it's
[1:19:18] going to affect you. It will influence
[1:19:20] you.
[1:19:24] Amen. And so we stay on our
[1:19:27] grounds and before you know it, you have
[1:19:32] their ways and the way they do and the
[1:19:34] way they talk and then you'll find
[1:19:37] yourself maybe doing a little bit like
[1:19:40] how they're doing. And you now you're
[1:19:43] being
[1:19:47] influenced. This doesn't just happen to
[1:19:49] young people. This happens to preachers
[1:19:51] and ministers, too. It happens to groups
[1:19:54] and churches. I've seen it. You know,
[1:19:56] people approach the word a certain way
[1:19:57] and they handle it a certain way and
[1:19:59] then you start getting around that, then
[1:20:02] you feel like that's the way it's
[1:20:04] supposed to be handled. No, no, no. You
[1:20:05] got to stay with, you know, you you the
[1:20:07] just walk, they live by faith. You got
[1:20:09] to have a revelation of what you're
[1:20:11] doing.
[1:20:12] You have to know what you're doing. And
[1:20:14] when God reveals something to you, you
[1:20:16] got to stay with that and be respectful
[1:20:19] to all people. But don't let people infl
[1:20:22] Don't follow other
[1:20:24] people follow other
[1:20:28] people, people that are not Christians,
[1:20:30] people that don't follow the
[1:20:33] word. Huh?
[1:20:35] Our influence comes from the word of the
[1:20:38] Lord.
[1:20:40] I know this is old. We heard it before
[1:20:42] this. But this is the truth. This is the
[1:20:45] reminder. This is where you know I I you
[1:20:48] know Achen I want you to think about
[1:20:50] Achen just for a moment. Achin had
[1:20:54] overcame so much to be where he
[1:20:57] was. This young man was a part of the
[1:21:01] greatest army under the greatest general
[1:21:03] that the world has ever known. Joshua
[1:21:06] was a part of that
[1:21:07] ministry. He made it through the
[1:21:09] wilderness. however old he was, he comes
[1:21:12] across and now he's with Israel
[1:21:14] overtaking and you're a part of an army
[1:21:17] that doesn't lose
[1:21:20] Achen and you get in a situation where
[1:21:23] you I don't know what happened. And I
[1:21:24] don't know what's going on in your life
[1:21:26] where you felt like it was
[1:21:29] okay to take a little piece of gold and
[1:21:33] a little Babylonian garment, whatever it
[1:21:37] was, and then hide
[1:21:40] it. Was it worth it?
[1:21:43] Aching? That's a secret sin we're
[1:21:46] talking about.
[1:21:49] And with all of his conscience and all
[1:21:53] of the time between going to the next
[1:21:55] battle, he had opportunity after
[1:21:57] opportunity after opportunity to make it
[1:22:00] right. And if he would have made it
[1:22:01] right, he would have saved some
[1:22:04] lives, but he didn't make it right. And
[1:22:06] now he's a he's a testimony. When you
[1:22:08] look up Achen in the scripture, he's
[1:22:11] tagged as the troubler of Israel.
[1:22:15] you do it in your strong research or
[1:22:18] your concordance, your Bible
[1:22:19] concordance, and look up Achen and look
[1:22:22] how they describe him. It's not it's not
[1:22:25] it's not a it's not a beautiful
[1:22:26] testimony at all. He's known as the
[1:22:30] troubler of
[1:22:34] Israel. He's known as the troubler of
[1:22:37] Shalom
[1:22:39] Tabernacle. He's the problem.
[1:22:50] But his
[1:22:52] example becomes a stepping stone for us.
[1:22:57] Is that right?
[1:23:00] It becomes a stepping stone for us. We
[1:23:02] see what he did and we don't want to go
[1:23:04] down that path of the
[1:23:07] unconfessed sin. Can I take one more on
[1:23:09] that? We take one more and then
[1:23:13] we'll by God's grace we'll close just
[1:23:15] now. All right. Praise the
[1:23:21] Lord. Yes. Jesus Christ the same
[1:23:25] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:23:28] 1954, paragraph number six. Look, if a
[1:23:32] person has got unconfessed sin and
[1:23:36] something in their heart, you could pray
[1:23:38] for them all night long and it'll never
[1:23:40] do no good. That demon will hold right
[1:23:44] there. Or if that person was supposed to
[1:23:47] do something that didn't do it, and God
[1:23:49] put that disease on them to bring them
[1:23:52] to reconciliation or to correction, you
[1:23:56] just can't do it. That's all. And then
[1:23:59] what if he did do it and God gave a man
[1:24:03] the authority to take sickness off of
[1:24:05] there and would take it off when God put
[1:24:08] it on them for a purpose or God didn't
[1:24:11] put it on them. He let the devil do it.
[1:24:15] God doesn't make people sick. Sometimes
[1:24:19] he permits the devil to do it. But God
[1:24:23] couldn't do it himself because he's
[1:24:24] mercy can't be mercy and death. He's
[1:24:27] life or death one. And he's life through
[1:24:30] Satan comes
[1:24:33] death. So we see the danger of the
[1:24:37] unconfessed
[1:24:38] sin. Huh? So what do we do? We confess
[1:24:42] our sins, don't
[1:24:44] we? We make those things right.
[1:24:48] We keep our we keep
[1:24:53] our keep our faith clear and clean. Just
[1:24:58] keep it light. Keep it nice and just no
[1:25:02] issues there. Just roll it off. Let it
[1:25:04] roll off. Don't let people hang you up
[1:25:07] and get you bothered and get you tied up
[1:25:09] with this and that. Just keep moving on
[1:25:11] in the grace of God. Keep your faith
[1:25:14] free from that little un those little uh
[1:25:19] sticky
[1:25:20] places, things that
[1:25:22] don't really promote
[1:25:26] faith. Amen. How many can say amen to
[1:25:30] that?
[1:25:35] Yes. Can I
[1:25:41] close?
[1:25:47] Woo. In the message, since you didn't
[1:25:49] answer, I'll answer it for
[1:25:51] you. Questions and answers, 1959. I I
[1:25:55] wanted to read this one. This is talking
[1:25:57] about us being in Canaan land and being
[1:25:59] on our ground. And here's what brother
[1:26:02] Brandham says. What are you doing?
[1:26:04] Paragraph 176. What are you doing? What
[1:26:06] do What do you do in Canaan? They were
[1:26:09] possessing their rights. glory. They
[1:26:12] were possessing their rights and they
[1:26:15] could not possess their rights till they
[1:26:18] got into Canaan. They didn't own nothing
[1:26:22] in the
[1:26:23] wilderness. Then when they come into
[1:26:26] Canaan, then they had
[1:26:28] rights. And we've got rights. When you
[1:26:31] receive the Holy Ghost, you're in
[1:26:33] Canaan. You have to fight for it. Every
[1:26:36] inch of ground, you have to fight for
[1:26:39] it. Yes, sir. That's the reason people
[1:26:41] say, "Brother Brandham, you pray for me
[1:26:43] today." All right, we'll see. Get over
[1:26:46] in Canaan once, brother. And you'll
[1:26:49] realize where you belong. Watch prayer
[1:26:53] start being turned around. Yes, sir. You
[1:26:57] say, "Look here, Satan. This is mine.
[1:27:00] I'm a possessor of this." God said, "So
[1:27:04] move out." That's right. That's right.
[1:27:07] Move off my ground. See your ground.
[1:27:11] Satan says I an abstract deed to it.
[1:27:15] Move out. You don't. I'll serve notice
[1:27:17] on you by the Holy Spirit's guidance. He
[1:27:21] moves out. Sure. He has
[1:27:24] to. That's a believer now. That's a
[1:27:27] believer in Canaan land. That's you and
[1:27:28] I. Once we know our ground, we know our
[1:27:31] rights. It's a birthright. It's an
[1:27:34] inheritance. It belongs to us. And
[1:27:36] that's how we approach it. Amen. God
[1:27:39] bless you. Lord be with you. Let us
[1:27:42] pray. Musicians come
[1:27:56] please. He that coverth his
[1:27:59] sin shall not prosper.
[1:28:04] But when I acknowledged my
[1:28:07] sin, he was faithful to forgive
[1:28:10] me. Dear Lord Jesus, we thank you for
[1:28:14] these. There's so many jewels of truth
[1:28:18] that lays in your
[1:28:20] word. And this little example here, I
[1:28:24] can recount and I know of many that can
[1:28:28] really
[1:28:29] understand what it means to live under
[1:28:32] unconfessed sin and to live in a place
[1:28:37] that is not clear. It's foggy. It's not
[1:28:42] full of
[1:28:43] faith. It's something that's hidden.
[1:28:45] It's not free. It's bondage.
[1:28:49] But Lord, you're faithful to forgive us
[1:28:52] if we acknowledge our
[1:28:56] sin. And Lord, we don't want to be in
[1:28:59] denial. We want to acknowledge our
[1:29:03] carnality and thereby ask you to perform
[1:29:08] a great change in our life as we turn it
[1:29:12] all over to you. I can't help myself. We
[1:29:16] can't help oursel. We can't change our
[1:29:19] ways, but you can,
[1:29:21] Lord. But we can present. We can
[1:29:26] confess and and place it in your hands.
[1:29:28] And then he gives you the the great Holy
[1:29:31] Spirit, the free will, the free course
[1:29:34] to begin to work on the areas of our
[1:29:37] life that we need
[1:29:39] it. We know a chain is as strong as it
[1:29:43] weak weakest link. And Lord, I can say a
[1:29:46] church is as strong as its weakest
[1:29:49] member. So Lord, strengthen every member
[1:29:54] of the church of the living
[1:29:56] God. Strengthen that believer, that man,
[1:29:59] that woman that's
[1:30:02] not what they should be in their faith.
[1:30:05] Lauren. Oh God, we
[1:30:09] pray that we would have the courage like
[1:30:12] Joshua be strong and of good courage
[1:30:16] that you will anoint us with the courage
[1:30:19] Lord to stand for you in such an evil
[1:30:23] day. Father, we commit each one into
[1:30:26] your hand Lord tonight. We thank you for
[1:30:30] the great gospel of truth satisfies our
[1:30:34] souls. It meets the needs of our life.
[1:30:37] It encompasses every age group, every
[1:30:40] social
[1:30:41] status, every race, every gender. It's
[1:30:44] the word of God. It deals with every
[1:30:48] single aspect of our life from the
[1:30:50] beginning to the end of our life. Lord,
[1:30:53] there's nothing greater. And so, we'll
[1:30:56] promote that tonight. We stand on that
[1:30:59] tonight. We look into that tonight,
[1:31:01] Lord. We pick it up. We read it again
[1:31:05] and again and again. And pray that you
[1:31:07] would open our understanding to it that
[1:31:11] we can walk in these principles, the
[1:31:15] principles of life. May you grant it,
[1:31:17] Lord Jesus.
[1:31:19] Oh God, rebuke any evil that's trying to
[1:31:22] influence us in any way, any negative,
[1:31:26] anything that's
[1:31:27] contrary. And Lord, if there be any
[1:31:31] secret
[1:31:32] sin that I've done today, Lord, please
[1:31:37] forgive, reveal it.
[1:31:39] Lord, don't let me hide it.
[1:31:42] Lord, let me uncover it in your
[1:31:46] presence and ask you to make me more
[1:31:50] like
[1:31:51] thee. Lord
[1:31:53] Jesus, don't let me hide it like Adam
[1:31:56] hid himself after sinning, but let him
[1:31:59] come forth and confess this is what I
[1:32:02] did wrong. I'm wrong. I'm
[1:32:05] wrong. Please help me,
[1:32:08] Lord. Let that be our attitude today.
[1:32:12] May you grant it,
[1:32:13] Father. It's in Jesus name we pray and
[1:32:16] we thank you.
[1:32:19] Amen. Love the
[1:32:22] Lord. I want to
[1:32:24] live. I want to
[1:32:27] live the
[1:32:30] way he wants me to live.
[1:32:36] I want to
[1:32:39] give till there's just no more to
[1:32:46] give. I want to
[1:32:51] love love
[1:37:59] We just love your word, Lord. What it
[1:38:01] brings out in us, Lord Jesus. A living
[1:38:04] word, Lord. A spirit, your spirit, Lord,
[1:38:09] dwelling up among us, Lord.
[1:38:10] [Music]
[1:38:12] making us perfect through you, Lord
[1:38:16] Jesus. Dear Lord, we appreciate your
[1:38:18] word. We heard tonight, Lord
[1:38:21] Jesus. May it go to our heart, Lord. May
[1:38:25] we any unconfessed sin, Lord. Bring it
[1:38:29] to our mind, Lord. May we make it right,
[1:38:32] Lord
[1:38:34] Jesus. Thank you so much, Lord, for
[1:38:38] everything you've given us, Lord.
[1:38:40] opportunities that you've given us.
[1:38:44] Thank you, Lord. Just ask that you be
[1:38:46] with
[1:38:48] us. Just guide us through this week,
[1:38:50] Lord. We ask this in Jesus Christ's
[1:38:53] name. Amen.
[1:38:59] My
[1:39:12] [Music]
[1:39:25] god. knows my every
[1:39:32] thought. He sees each tears and
[1:39:38] long and he hears me when I
[1:39:45] call. Yes, he hears me
[1:39:49] when I call.
[1:39:53] [Music]
[1:39:58] And
[1:40:00] there
[1:40:02] is a
[1:40:07] river that
[1:40:10] flows from
[1:40:12] deep within.
[1:40:19] Oh,
[1:40:21] there
[1:40:23] is a
[1:40:28] fountain that
[1:40:31] frees the
[1:40:33] soul from sin.
[1:40:36] [Music]
[1:40:40] So
[1:40:42] come
[1:40:44] to this
[1:40:50] water. There
[1:40:52] is a
[1:40:55] mass supply of life.
[1:40:59] [Music]
[1:41:01] Yes,
[1:41:04] there
[1:41:05] is a
[1:41:11] river that
[1:41:14] there
[1:41:16] shall run dry. Do we have the verse?
[1:41:19] There was a thirsty one.
[1:41:22] There
[1:41:24] was a
[1:41:27] thirsty
[1:41:31] woman who was
[1:41:35] drawing
[1:41:37] from the
[1:41:42] well. Well, her
[1:41:45] life was
[1:41:47] ruined and wasted.
[1:41:53] and her
[1:41:55] soul was
[1:41:57] bound for him.
[1:42:05] Again, she
[1:42:08] led a
[1:42:13] master who
[1:42:16] told
[1:42:18] her great
[1:42:20] [Music]
[1:42:23] things. He said,
[1:42:26] "If you'll
[1:42:28] drink from his
[1:42:33] waterers, you will
[1:42:36] never
[1:42:39] thirst again.
[1:42:41] [Music]
[1:42:47] There
[1:42:49] is a
[1:42:54] river that
[1:42:56] flows from
[1:42:59] deep
[1:43:01] [Music]
[1:43:04] within. Oh,
[1:43:08] there there is a fountain.
[1:43:15] that
[1:43:16] frees the
[1:43:19] soul from
[1:43:21] [Music]
[1:43:23] sin. Oh, just
[1:43:26] [Music]
[1:43:27] come
[1:43:29] to this
[1:43:34] water. There
[1:43:37] is a
[1:43:39] bless of God.
[1:43:46] Oh,
[1:43:48] there
[1:43:50] is a
[1:43:55] river that
[1:43:58] never
[1:44:00] shall run
[1:44:05] dry. Amen. Didn't you enjoy that
[1:44:09] tonight? Amen.
[1:44:12] I've shared with a number of people that
[1:44:15] feel like God never lets me get away
[1:44:17] with
[1:44:18] anything. And I am just so thankful for
[1:44:20] that because he says that those that he
[1:44:23] loves, he rebukes and
[1:44:25] chasens. And he says, "Be zealous,
[1:44:28] therefore, and repent." And I'm just so
[1:44:30] thankful
[1:44:31] that his arm is not too short to reach
[1:44:35] wherever Satan tried to pull me from.
[1:44:38] And he's a God of mercy. He's a God of
[1:44:42] forgiveness. And Amen. If he's got his
[1:44:45] arms wide open for you
[1:44:47] tonight. Amen. Just sing that chorus.
[1:44:50] Think about his love. The key of
[1:44:53] F. Just think about his
[1:44:58] love. Oh, just think about his goodness.
[1:45:06] Just think about his
[1:45:11] grace. That's what's brought us through.
[1:45:18] [Music]
[1:45:20] For as high as the heavens
[1:45:26] above, so great is the
[1:45:30] measure of our
[1:45:33] father's
[1:45:37] [Music]
[1:45:39] love. Oh, great is the
[1:45:43] measure of our
[1:45:46] father's love. love. Oh, think about it
[1:45:50] as we sing it again. Oh, think about his
[1:45:55] love. Think about his
[1:45:58] goodness. Think about his
[1:46:01] [Music]
[1:46:03] goodness. Oh, just think about his
[1:46:10] grace. That's what's brought us through.
[1:46:19] For as high as the heavens
[1:46:25] above, so great is the
[1:46:29] measure of our father's love.
[1:46:34] [Music]
[1:46:37] [Applause]
[1:46:38] Oh, so great is the
[1:46:42] measure of our
[1:46:45] father's
[1:46:51] love. No one knew how alone I was
[1:46:57] [Music]
[1:46:59] feeling and the emptiness I tried so
[1:47:04] hard to hide.
[1:47:08] Though I laughed and said my life was
[1:47:12] fine without
[1:47:16] you. I was covering up the secret tears
[1:47:21] I had cried.
[1:47:24] But then one day someone told me of your
[1:47:32] mercy and the love you showed on a hill
[1:47:36] called
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:39] Calvary. Oh there you died.
[1:47:44] You purchase my
[1:47:48] redemption when you broke sin's power
[1:47:52] and set my spirit
[1:47:56] free. I'm
[1:48:00] amazed how you love me.
[1:48:05] Oh, I'm
[1:48:08] amazed how you
[1:48:12] came through your
[1:48:15] preious blood I found
[1:48:20] pardoned. And my
[1:48:23] sins are washed. They are all washed
[1:48:28] away. All my
[1:48:31] sins are
[1:48:33] washed
[1:48:37] away. Yes, it's true. There have been
[1:48:40] days when I've failed
[1:48:45] you, Lord. You know the many times I've
[1:48:49] gone
[1:48:52] astray. But I've learned your love is
[1:48:57] stronger than my
[1:48:59] [Music]
[1:49:01] weakness. And your ear is open every
[1:49:06] time I pray.
[1:49:09] No one else has ever cared for me like
[1:49:15] you,
[1:49:18] Lord. Under friends could never be as
[1:49:22] close to
[1:49:25] me. I'm not afraid to face the problems
[1:49:30] of tomorrow.
[1:49:34] Oh, you are
[1:49:37] everything I'll ever
[1:49:41] need. I'm
[1:49:45] amazed that you love
[1:49:49] me. I'm
[1:49:53] amazed how you
[1:49:57] care. Through your
[1:50:00] preious love. I found
[1:50:05] pardon. And my
[1:50:07] sins are washed. They're all washed
[1:50:12] away. Oh, my
[1:50:15] sins are
[1:50:17] washed
[1:50:19] [Music]
[1:50:21] away. Oh, I'm
[1:50:25] amazed that you love me.
[1:50:28] [Music]
[1:50:29] Oh, I'm
[1:50:33] amazed how you
[1:50:35] [Music]
[1:50:37] came through your
[1:50:40] preious blood. I found
[1:50:45] pardon. And my
[1:50:47] sins are washed. They're all washed
[1:50:52] away. Oh, my
[1:50:55] sins are washed.
[1:50:58] [Music]
[1:51:02] away. Hallelujah. Give him a praise
[1:51:07] offering. Let's sing one more before we
[1:51:09] go to the key of
[1:51:12] G. Oh, I've been
[1:51:17] changed,
[1:51:19] [Music]
[1:51:21] healed,
[1:51:22] free, and
[1:51:25] delivered. And delivered. I found
[1:51:28] joy. I found
[1:51:32] joy. Found
[1:51:36] peace. I found
[1:51:41] grace and favor. Let's confess that one
[1:51:44] more time. Oh, I've been
[1:51:49] changed. I've been
[1:51:52] healed. I've been free.
[1:51:57] I've been
[1:52:00] forgiven. I found
[1:52:05] joy. I found
[1:52:08] peace. I found
[1:52:13] grace and favor. And right now is the
[1:52:18] moment. And right now is the moment.
[1:52:24] Today is the day. I've been
[1:52:30] changed. I've been
[1:52:34] changed. And I've waited for this moment
[1:52:39] to come. And I won't let it pass me by.
[1:52:50] And I won't go back. Can't go back to
[1:52:55] the way I used to be before his presence
[1:53:01] came and changed
[1:53:04] me. Oh, I won't go back. Can't go back
[1:53:11] to the way I used to be before your
[1:53:16] presence came and changed me.
[1:53:20] [Music]
[1:53:25] All my
[1:53:26] [Music]
[1:53:28] shame, all my
[1:53:32] guilt, my
[1:53:35] sins, they're all
[1:53:40] forgiven. There's no more
[1:53:44] chance, no more fear.
[1:53:49] My
[1:53:51] past, my
[1:53:53] past is
[1:53:56] over. Yes. All my
[1:54:00] shame, all my
[1:54:05] guilt, my
[1:54:07] sins. Lord, they are all forgiven.
[1:54:13] There's no more
[1:54:16] chains, no more
[1:54:18] [Music]
[1:54:20] fear. My
[1:54:23] past, my past is
[1:54:30] over. And right now is the moment.
[1:54:36] Today is the day I've been
[1:54:42] changed. I've been
[1:54:45] changed. And I've waited for this moment
[1:54:51] to come. And I won't let it pass me
[1:55:00] by. Oh, I won't go back. Can't go back
[1:55:07] to the way it used to be before your
[1:55:12] presence came and change
[1:55:17] me. I won't go back. Can't go back to
[1:55:23] the way it used to be before your
[1:55:27] presence came and changed me.
[1:55:36] I've been
[1:55:43] changed.
[1:55:45] Hallelujah. Blessed be your name, Lord
[1:55:48] Jesus.
[1:55:51] Hallelujah.
[1:55:53] Hallelujah. Blessed be your name, Jesus.
[1:55:56] [Music]
[1:55:59] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:56:04] I've been
[1:56:06] changed. Oh, I've been changed. I've
[1:56:09] been
[1:56:12] changed. I've been
[1:56:16] healed. I've been
[1:56:21] free,
[1:56:24] delivered. I found
[1:56:28] joy. I found peace.
[1:56:34] found
[1:56:37] grace and
[1:56:40] favor. Yes, I've been
[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:49] changed.
[1:56:51] Hallelujah. Amen. It's been good to be
[1:56:53] in the house of the Lord today. Amen.
[1:56:56] You're dismissed. We'll sing one as we
[1:56:57] go. I love him better every
[1:57:02] day. I love him better every
[1:57:08] day. Close by his side. That's where I
[1:57:12] will
[1:57:14] abide. I love him better every
[1:57:19] day. I love him better every day.
[1:57:27] I love you better every
[1:57:31] day. Lord, close by your side. That's
[1:57:35] where I will
[1:57:37] abide. I love you better every
[1:57:42] day. Yes, Lord, I love you better every
[1:57:48] day. Lord, I love you better every day.
[1:57:55] and close by your side. That's where I
[1:57:59] will
[1:58:01] abide. I love you better every
[1:58:07] day. I love him better every
[1:58:12] day. I love him better every
[1:58:18] day. Close
[1:58:22] by I will
[1:58:25] abide. I love him better every
