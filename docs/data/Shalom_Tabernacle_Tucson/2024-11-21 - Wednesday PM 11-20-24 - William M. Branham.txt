expect to I don't expect to talk very long tonight maybe 30 minutes or 40 upon a little subject here that I would like to first read a scripture found in the book of Psalms Psalms 105 and reading down to the 15th verse inclusive while I read this Psalm I want you to listen real close to the reading of the word because God's word will never fail oh give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people I just think of that give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the People Sing unto him sing Psalms unto him talk ye of his wondrous Works Glory ye in His holy name let the hearts of them that Rejoice that seek the Lord seek the Lord and his strength seek his face Evermore remember His Marvelous works that he has done his wonders and his judgments of his mouth oh ye Seed of Abraham his servant ye children of Jacob his chosen he is the Lord Our God his judgments are in all the Earth he has remembered his Covenant forever the word which he commanded to a thousand generation which Covenant he made with Abraham and his oath unto Isaac and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law and to Israel for an Everlasting Covenant saying unto thee will I give the land of Canaan the lot of your inheritance when they that when when they were but a few men in number yay very few and strangers in it when they went forth from one nation to another and from one Kingdom to another he suffered no man to do them wrong yay he reprove Kings for their sake saying touch not my anointed and do my prophets no more hallelujah praise our God I want to take a a subject from there of respects reading here David crying out to the Lord respects is what we owe to God and that's one thing that I would like to uh drill this to the heart of every person here tonight that in all things that we see going on we must give respects to it amen we must respect it and David said that when they were very few men of Israel perhaps Abraham Isaac and Jacob who is speaking on very few men that he rebuked Nations and Kings for them God rebuked the Nations and Kings saying touch not my anointed and do my profits no harm over in Ecclesiastes the 12th chapter and the 13th verse it's written like this see let us share the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the full duty of man the conclusion of the whole matter is to fear God and when you cannot have respect until you have fear you've got to have fear of God Solomon said also in the Proverbs that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom amen the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom now that don't mean that you're afraid of him but that means that you're giving him respects and reverence and when you respect God you fear God you fear that you might displease him in some way you fear L you would do something wrong you wouldn't want to I fear my mother I fear my my wife I fear my church I fear all of God's servants unless un I should put a stumbling BLX somewhere in their way I fear the people I fear the people of the city unless I should do something wrong that would cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian see you've got before you can have respect you've got to have fear and God demands it he demands respects God does he demands it and fear brings it and we know that fear brings respects now you take for instance a man he's a farmer or maybe he's a a shop worker and uh nobody pays any attention to him but let him get a job on the police force and come down the street as a a policeman with his badge and uniform on or maybe someone wouldn't speak to him the day before hello there John how are you see why is it it's kind of an awe our fear our respect because of it maybe he gets elected to be the mayor of the or maybe who would President Kennedy tonight be if he wasn't President Kennedy what if he was just a same man he is but yet he was a worker worked at col Gates down here for uh $40 a week see he'd come through the city here and nobody would pay much attention to him on his own Associates but being he's a president of the United States he deserves a respect you see and that and because that God is God am he deserves a respect that's right Hallelujah and he we've got to respect him and give a fear to him and that brings respect God has demanded that for himself and for all his servants amen God demands respect for his servants he uh his servants how we know that they are his servants because he vindicates these servants by his word he takes these servants and makes them Servants of God and proves that they are servants by making his word work through them servants then as you respect that servant you respect God so when I respect you and you respect me and we respect each other then we're respecting God did not Jesus say in so much as you have done un the least of these my little ones you have done it unto me and it would be better for you that a millstone was hanged at your neck and you were drowned in the depths of the sea than to offend one of them where I say you behold their FA Angels always beholds my father's face which is in heaven now we know that they are that we being children of God that we are a part of God and God demands this respects then God shows who his children are he he shows it by wonders and signs and that it's been done now we're going to start now and call into question some of these people now if I was going to say for one to start with I think of of let's take Noah for a moment now Noah had a revelation from God yet it was contrary to anything that science would prove to be true but yet he had spoke to God and God had spoke to him and he went about preparing an ark where the scoffers and mockers as the Bible said that they would be in the last days like it was in them days that those scoffers scoffed at Noah well they thought that he was out of his head because he was building an ark so but God brought judgment upon them scoffers because they would not listen to the messenger of God and come into that Ark under his preaching then God sent his Divine judgments on the earth first he made a preparation for all who would receive it to escape it and then if they did not Escape it there's only one thing left if they won't take God's preparation of Escape then there's only one thing that's Divine judgment amen you can only do two things it lays either Mercy or judgment you have to accept one of the other that's where we stand tonight we either take God's mercy or we stand his judgment there's just no way of getting around it God always makes a way of Escape for those who desire to escape then he's got what's left over has to stand the Judgment not because of God wants them to but because they have chosen that way themselves see they make their own choice that's where we stand tonight friends the same thing we can either take God's way of Escape or we can stand in judgments either one we want to do aren't you happy tonight that you have tucked the way of Escape amen because all that refuse the way of Escape will have to come under judgment then there is another man I'd like to speak of that was a great Mighty Prophet by the name of Moses the people Israel should have understood according to the scripture that God was going to deliver them and was going to bring them out of Egypt but as soon as God got his man ready and sent him down into Egypt they had no respects for him they turned him out and said will you slay us as you did the Egyptian which caused them to stay in bondage uh extra 40 years they stayed in bondage because they refuse to respect the deliverer that come to deliver them that put them back in bondage again not because God wanted to stay the time was exactly right but they stayed 40 years over because they refuse to accept God's provided way of Escape how I believe that that's what's the matter tonight same thing see that they refuse the way out and and God was determined and had told Abraham and them in his Covenant as we read David singing of it tonight he had promis them that he was going to do a certain thing so God's going to keep his promise he was going to bring him out anyhow but perhaps nearly another generation died off the old generation laughed at Moses and so forth and would not accept the message that generation 40 years died off and Moses come into another generation see what I mean if they don't accept it then God will let that generation die out and he'll bring in another generation to do it amen so they had refused it and then we find out this next Generation to come up when Moses went down there to vindicate himself you know Moses was scared to go down again Moses is 80 years old now and he' been gone 40 years and when he talked to God at the burning bush he said who will I tell them it sent me God had no name he said who will I tell them that sent me so I say the god of your fathers appeared to me they'll say who is the god of our fathers well what do I tell him he said you tell them that I am that I am you tell them that I am that I am all that and he said what is that in your hand Moses he said a thick and he threw it down and turned into a serpent he put his hand in his bull turned to leprosy and went back and healed he said go down and take these signs and perform them them before the people and it'll be an Vindication they'll know by these signs that I sent you for deliverance amen oh brother Hallelujah God always does that God always gives Supernatural signs see and now when he came down and called the people and done his signs before them all Israel believ every one of them and they went right straight to the Palace the for deliverance and then the Pharaoh decided he would not give him deliverance and God turned judgment loose on pharaoh and we know what happened in Egypt strange after they had seen all those signs happen and then they come to the Red Sea and found out that the very God that performed all those signs here at the Red Sea doubted God the very first thing that he was able to make a way of Escape now there's where we make our mistakes one of little sickness strikes us one a little disaster a little trouble strikes somewhere in a way then we go to Falling Away a young convert somebody will make fun of him and say well you ain't nothing but a Holy Roller well I hate to be called a Holy Roller you see see there you are you get that doubt that's the time to stand there amen that's the time to respect the messenger that's the time to to give glory to God hallelujah and Moses said I've done these already 10 10 Miracles before you God's give you 10 Miracles and then you're afraid of to see certainly how much more would it take for you to believe hallu he walked back and stuck his rod and held it before the Sea and the storms came down and blo across the other side and they went across and as soon as he got over there immediately be to complain they had no bread just same thing then God rain bread out of heavens for then they complained they had no water and just one complain after another and I noticed you say well maybe they were the unconverted type well maybe they were there was a mixed multitude went with them true but I want to bring another thing into your uh into your remembrance if God sent the messenger and Vindicated by the signs that he was a messenger sent from God then it's up to them to obey this messenger amen exactly they must obey the messenger GL right and have respects to that messenger look at Joshua and Caleb they stayed right by his side amen yes sir whatever Moses in they was in it too whether Moses right or wrong they stayed right with him anyhow see because they know that was God's messenger and there one day we find out that even Mariam a prophet and Aaron the high priest made fun of moses' wife because she was an Ethiopian and thought was there enough women of our own group to marry instead of going down there and marrying that woman that wasn't Moses choice that was God's choice for Moses amen and when they made fun of it that angered God in such a way until he struck maram the prophecies full of leprosy Moses's own sister what about that her a prophet but what was she doing she was making fun in an ear reverence to God's messenger amen the messenger of the Covenant of that day and she was irreverent and also Aaron the high priest the very mouth Tee of Moses yeah right he was with her and Aaron then when he saw his sister struck with Leprosy he went in and told Moses would you let your own sister die and Moses went into the Tabernacle and fell before the Lord and be to weep call out for God Mercy for his sister and the spirit of the Lord came down and said call Aaron and maram to stand here before me oh Hallelujah God demands respect God sends his message you listen to it you reverence it don't care if they call it a bunch of holy rulers or whatever they call it let the world do what they want to but you give respects amen so there stood Mariam God said call Mariam and call mooses call Aaron here your brother and sister to stand before me and when they come in before God God said don't you fear God said that to the high priest and to maram the prophet said if there be any A man among you spiritual or prophets I the Lord will make myself known to him I speak to him in Visions reveal myself and dreams to him and so forth if he's spiritual or propit but said my servant Moses I speak lip to ear with him amen said don't you fear God in other words you talk about Moses you're talking about me if you can't respect Moses you don't respect me said haven't I proved among you that he's my servant Hallelujah and you have no reverence for him at all what that would be a lesson for the people of this day oh amen no respect no honor now he said because you didn't do that that's the reason you got leprosy that's the reason these things is went said because you ought to know that this is my servant you do know it amen So when you say something against him you're saying it against me amen so Moses prayed for her life to be spared and God did spare her life she didn't live very long long afterwards she died but she did get cleansed of her leprosy and is out of the camp for seven days you know for for having for a purification getting herself uh cleaned again from her leprosy God healed her but what he was trying to get to them is this you've got to respect what I do amen and if that was the attitude of God in that day and God can't change God wants us to respect what he's doing amen he demands it said you either respect that or something else is going to happen a man told me the other day he said I poor man sweeps up over here in the market for a living he's had a breakdown in very bad shape he's Lutheran by faith and they had communion he's too a unable to walk to the church so he tuck a cab said it cost him 80 cents to go down 80 cents to come back his neighbor very ungodly seen him praying The Lord's Prayer one morning laughed at he made fun of him he said to this neighbor he said to this man he said where'd you go in a cab this morning said it was communion I went out to the church he said what is communion said when we take the bread and the wine he said I had mine too this morning at the table with a slice of light bread and a pine of whiskey see I know of three boys one time that mock communion in the church no other them and they went went up in a the hotel room and got some ham sandwiches and um a bottle of whiskey and had their communion up there making fun of the communion they had in a Pentecostal Church less than three months from then all three was two one of them was dead and two was in the insane institution you can't disrespect God you've got to respect God if you don't believe it just keep still keep away from it or either do that or come reverently and respect it don't make fun of people in the spirit don't talk about people that's worshiping in the spirit of God let them alone I was standing right there on the corner preaching some years ago as a boy preacher and there was a woman came by she's Catholic with faith but I know her her husband is Catholic she was nothing and a very handsome Pretty Woman nice looking about 20 years old 22 I knew her as a girl here in the city and she came by and stood there and she said I wouldn't let my pet cow have the religion that William Brandon's got and the next night before I could get to her her she was dying in the hospital and don't know yet what killed her she was dying out there in the hospital and her husband came to get me he said he was a Catholic and he come he said come quickly and say a prayer for my wife she's been calling for for you all evening she's dying well I said I will go and I got in the car and left the meeting and started to the hospital and I run up on the steps I met the nurse and she said she's already dead and he said come say a prayer for her anyhow I said she's dead said say a prayer any I won't do any good now said well come look at her and I went down she had a that reddish black I give be called arban hair very pretty woman few freckles across her face here with a great big brown eyes and that woman that nurse said Billy she died in such Agony until she screamed out your name as loud as she could and said tell him to forgive me till the freckles stood out on her face like warts and those big eyes had set way out and the eyelids are half closed over of course you know what happens when a person dies they're both kidney and Bows move and she was lar just steaming all over and died in such agony because not because she disrespected me but she disrespected the gospel that I was preaching and God was working signs and wonder some time ago in new ay while I was standing there talking to a sinner leading him to Christ a big old ru-h handed man in a garage a man was a friend of mine his son-in-law run the garage next door I was standing there preaching at a dinner hour eating a sandwich and talking to him about God through the daytime I'd find somewhere where I'd go at dinner time and try to win and soul to Christ he said Mr Bram he said I just a boy preacher myself he said Mr brand said my mother had that kind of religion that heartfelt religion and the tears was running down his cheeks I said how long she been gone said years she always prayed for me I said the god that heard her prayers is trying to answer him right now for her and this man walked in there he said El is drunk said hey Billy listen said anytime you want to come over my garage said you come but said don't bring that old ho wrot a religion of yours over there I turned and looked at him I said anywhere Christ is not welcome I'll not be and so he turned around and said oh get next to yourself boy now I just heard in my heart a voice say you reap what you sow it'll be better for you that a millstone was hanged at your neck and drowned in the depths of sea and his own son-in-law that very same afternoon run over him with a two ton chevret truck loaded down and masing down in the ground see You' got to respect God you've got to do you God demands respect and he demands it and so Mariam ought to know better so Mo art Aaron to know better then knowing this that Moses was led by the spirit of God to do what he was going to do baptist Minister wrote me a letter a couple days ago up here oh if he didn't rate me go he said a guy that's as lazy as you are I'm Ministry that would be equal to Elijah the prophets he said and then to see you sitting around home doing nothing so Billy is acting his secretary at the time he wrote him a letter about it and then he thought well I believe I'll just answer him he said but he thought he better let me read it before he answered it but it had a lot of diplomacy in it he said now this is not my dad this is me said you just said that uh Daddy had a Ministry like that of Elijah and said you said he sat out on a cek bank some with a fishing pole in his hand are up in the mountain with a rifle in his hand said what would you say about Elisha when he set three years by the side of the brook but don't you know that they're led by the spirit of God to do what they're doing amen see everybody wants to run it their own way but man must be led by the spirit of God and we must give it respect that's all amen you're other day a precious Soul you're in the city seen another brother he said where feel that he said he's gone up in Canada he said I guess going to hunt and he said yes he's going to hunt all nonsense to such stuff all right that man not knowing that I was under the power of the Holy Spirit by a vision of thus sayith the Lord to go hallelujah what would you do at the day of the Judgment what good would it do to me go to bedside of that man and pray for me the first place he doesn't believe me and and people when they come around and say these things like I don't know it they don't believe it though they pat you on the back and call you brother yet you know they don't believe it see they don't believe it and you can have not one thing you can do for them they'll call for you to come pray but it doesn't any good cuz you see they disrespect it you've got to believe it watch those who really believe and watch what happen you've got to respected Jezebel in the days of elah how she disrespected Elijah how she Elijah was actually her pastor sure oh she wouldn't receive that goodness know she was a she was a atheist or Infidel Idol worshiper and she had her own Pagan priest but yet Elijah was her pastor God sing there to be Pastor he was pastor with if he did ball her out and tell her all of her sins yet he was her pastor she wouldn't receive it at all but and she disrespected him she hated him sure she did what happened to her God let the dogs eat her in the street amen that's right because what she disrespected the message that Elijah was preaching God demands respects you got to have it you ever get anything from God you're go to respect God and you must do it from your heart the bottom of your heart you must do it but she disrespect respected God as she disrespected his Prophet now she know Elijah was a prophet they didn't have anything in Israel could keep up with Elijah why his visions and everything was perfect before God and he but he condemned them Mercy yes he go on every denomination everything else and everything is called sin he condemned it from the least to the greatest amen King and all he didn't pull any punches for none of them all right but they had to know he was a prophet they just couldn't keep from knowing that yes sir even Ahab tried to accuse him for the drought and he did pray God to send the drought yes he did and he said I have power now close the heaven it'll not even rain or du won't fall what I call for could you imagine that little Jezebel that painted up face stoping up down that floor that old hypocrite that old hypocrite causing all these little children out here to suffer and all like that Elijah was trying to bring him back to God trying to win a nation back to God see it look like she could tell the people and you mean to tell me you'd believe on a man like that that would close the lands up like this and not even rain or due and all this hypocrisy or his witchcraft out there whatever she want to call it and he's nothing but just a a witch or sus or something he's closed the heavens it ain't won't rain making all these people suffer and you say then that's the will of God it was the will of God Amen no matter what see you must look at what you must respect God regardless of what he does he knows what he's doing doing am did look bad children suffering people suffering cattle dying sheep dying no water nowhere the nights was hot and sulty the sun was as bright as brass in the skies through the daytime for 3 years and 6 months Elijah s up on the mountain said not even do a fall till I call from oh how they hated him and when he they had found him he said you're the one that's troubling Israel are you old Elijah looked back in his face said nay not me but you're the one that's troubling Israel that's right even Ahab didn't have respect for him you know what Elijah told Ahab said because you shed the innocent blood of neot so the dogs will lick your blood too in the street and they did amen because they disrespected God's messenger exactly right they disrespected it now Mariam disrespected it Aaron disrespected it no matter who you are Christian are not Christian you've got to still bring respects to God and respect what he's doing or suffer the consequence it's either receive it or going into judgment either one you want to how I can stand with testimony for hour after hour of what I've seen in my lifetime what I've seen in any other countries and other parts of the Nations and so forth the things that's taking place place but to Omit that just so that you'll get the the idea of what I'm trying to say to you you must respect it I've seen young people sit in a meeting and snigger and life in a meeting and less than 24 hours be crushed into the streets I've seen young people sat in a meeting in one year when I was in a place and next maybe within six months go back to the same place and practically every one of them was gone or land stricken somewhere with diseases and things yeah that's right you have to respect it remember a certain young girl one night Tennessee and I was going out the door preaching in a big Baptist Church was going out the door I felt led that night to call her to come to Christ well she laughed in my face when I called her to come to Christ she had be one of the Deacon's daughters and stand at the door that night she waited for me and I come out she said I want you to know something right now don't you never embarrass me like that again I said God was calling you she said nonsense sense I'm young so I got plenty of time for that said my Daddy's got enough religion for all of us at home I said not enough for you sister everyone has to have their own religion she said if I want anybody to talk to me about that I'll get somebody's got some sense not somebody like you I said go say what you wish you you don't bother me but someday you'll regret it not long after that passed through the same city here she come down the street with her underskirts hanging down slopping with a cigarette in her hand and offer me a drink a whiskey same thing here's her testimony she said you remember the night you call that said that was the truth she said the spirit of God was testifying to me that night trying to get me to come and said since then I could see my mother Soul frying hell like a pancake and laugh at it that's what happened see you've got to respect God all you got to do it brother that's all Jezebel disrespected it and remember another time there's some ear River children theyve been raised up in a home Elijah after his days of course the people hated him because he call that famine in the Land There were some people had taught their children that Elijah a man like that been translated taken into heaven he got killed somewhere and they just bearded him and hid him they they didn't believe it so Elisha took his place now he was a messenger of the day now after Elijah had been taken up so he passed down through a certain city and the children Little Children of that City run out making fun of him and said say you old Baldhead why didn't you goow up like Elijah did see they didn't believe Elijah went up there it is it wasn't a disrespecting the man it was disrespecting his message he was a successor to Elijah to Elijah he had the anointing the spirit of Elijah was up on him he went up there and done the very same things that Elijah did all right hallelujah amen Jesus said he that GTH on me the works I do shall he do also Hallelujah these signs shall follow them they disrespected it and they disrespected Elijah because he believed in elishah because the spirit was upon him and he turned around and smoked the jarden with his manlin opened up the jarden went up and done the same kind of Miracles that Elijah did and even all the preaches up at the school the prophet said the spirit of Elijah rest is up on Elijah Hallelujah know abroad in the country and the people I bet the L say look at that bunch of holy rulers ftic saying that man went to heaven without dying horses come down we didn't see any certainly they didn't certainly not they didn't we didn't see any hores we didn't hear any chariots anywhere nonsense the old fellow died and they buried him and then they trying to make a lot of uh cadu over just like they say today the same thing like they said about Jesus they said while they come and stole his body at night time they even pay soldiers to testify that but he raised him the dead and Elijah was tuck up in a CH to fire with horses of fire with this young Prophet walking along there going down through the city he lost his hair as a young man he was going down so these little children run behind him said hey why didn't you go up with Elijah said you old Baldhead you see and they were given disrespect and what did Elijah do he turned in the power of the spirit and cursed those children what happened two sheep bears come from the woods and kill 42 of them right disrespects irreverence you can't do that you've got to respect God if they have them kids that said now if their father and mother said now look children they say that Elijah was taken up now we don't know about that but anyhow I I I don't know whether it's so or not but I tell you the best thing to do is just don't say nothing about it just go ahead when he passes we hear he's coming down through the city today go to have a street meeting up there if he does if you children on the road to school today mean you say how do you do Reverend how do you do sir or something like that speak to him but instead of that no doubt they've been told at home all I heard Papa and Mama sit at the table and laughing one other saying what do you know they said that old holy roll was taking up could you ever believe anything like that and they said this a little baldheaded fell just as baldheaded as a pumpkin up there you over we're about 35 years old and here he's coming down through there day you go to whole street you expect us to believe such nonsense as that why isn't nothing but a little just a a mockery that's all it is because he won't come to our churches he's just like Elijah was he won't come to our churches we he'll probably some kind of Witchcraft hoodo hes that he's got like Elijah they didn't believe him so the little children was taught that at home if they've been taught reverence and respect that have walked out there before that prophet of God and I ask for prayer for themselves J but they had been taught to snigger and laugh and to make fun about like the children of today more too many of them today would make fun at a street meeting they make fun at the preaching of the Gospel so Elijah cursed them in the name of the Lord not because of the children but because of the irreverent parents that have brought the children up that way to disrespect God to she bears come out and kill 42 of them now that's irreverence God demands respect when they disrespected his Prophet they disrespected him no matter how much they didn't believe they already kept their mouth shut stay away from it but all they had to put in their nickel were they had to say something that they ought not have said and what happened to them let's take some people who did respect it let's take the shunamite woman to the same Prophet Elijah she was actually not an Israelite she was from shuna but she believed in God and she seen this man pass through the town heard him speak she's seen the signs that he done it's totally history I don't know where it's true or not that one day a bunch of wild dogs was trying to catch a little girl now this isn't scripture it's just a story that are read and said this shite woman was standing on the corner and she saw that these dogs was going to kill this little girl and this holy man was passing to town and he raised up his staff to God and cried out for Mercy for them little children like that and the dogs turned and went away from them whether it was sore or not sounds like it could be I don't know but anyhow this woman said when the Bible when she she perceived that this was a holy man she perceived something had happened she seen what he was and perceived that he was a holy man from God and instead of disrespecting him like Jezebel did she respected him she said to her husband we are well able to do this I pray thee let's build him a little house out here somewhere let's give him a little place far he's weary I watch him he's getting old and notice his gray hair as it hung down in his beard his a old staff his little skinny arms as he walked along the little flabby arms like that and here he come walking along packing a little Cru of oil on his side with a piece of sheep skin wrapped around him in the hot sun his body looks scared and red and uh I pray thee let's make him a little station to stop here let's get the contractor and come out here and build him a little place and Putt him up because I perceive that his Spirit by his he's a holy man he's a man of God what the difference now her husband agreed she he said darling I've noticed that man too I've listened at him I've watched him I've seen his works I know he's the holy man of God so we'll just do that so they called the contractor build him a nice little place and put him a little bed there to rest so he can lay down and rest fixed him a place to wash his feet got some water and things and fixed it in there and when the prophet came by of course i' blessed his soul to see that something had been done for him he said to Gesa go call her and asked her what could I do for her could I speak to the king to the chief chap he she said I dwell among my people and there's nothing I have eat of but Gesa said she has no children and her husband is well stricken in age he's old they have no children and I imagine Elijah laying on this little bed that she had blessed him by making had his feet all washed and his beards all washed out and thing laying there no doubt for what he's seen the vision of the Lord because they always did that so they said go call her and tell her to stand here before me oh Hallelujah go call her because she has she's respected God go tell her to come here when she stood in the door he said thus sayith the Lord about this time next year you'll bear a baby GL and about that time next year she had the baby then Satan when he got to be about 12 years old his father had him out in the field one day and Satan said I'll get rid of that child so he just give him a son stroke and he died in his mother's arms did that discourage her no sir she said saddle a mule and go farward don't stop go up to Mount Caramel to the mountain because he just passed through here other day there you are that's respect that's respect and her husband said you're going to the man of God said it's neither new moon or Sabbath he won't be up there and she said all will be well just sadle a mu and let me go on and so away they went and they got up into the mountain and and when old Elijah looked out of the cave and he come out there and looked at he said this looks like that shunamite woman coming said she must be grieved he said go meet her and when it said she's grieving in her heart and God's never told me nothing about it see God don't have to tell you everything see so he don't even tell his profits everything he just he just does what he wants to do he's God now Elijah said God what if elij just said this why didn't you tell me why she's coming why didn't you tell me all about it you had never seen a thing but it was all right with Elijah whatever it was and what if she had come up and said she'd say you said you was a servant of God you hypocrite I do believe you ain't nothing but a Holy Roller it'll never happen see God tries us sometimes see what we'll do so instead of that she run right up to his feet and worship like she was to God and she said and she revealed to him what was the matter and Elijah said take my staff and go lay it on the child and when he did the woman said as the Lord God liveth in your soul will never die Hallelujah thou servant of God I'll not leave you I'm going to stay here to God sense division amen oh Elijah stayed there a little while longer gted up his loins and tucked his staff and here he went he went into the room where that baby was laying a dead baby walked up and down the floor like that a few times because of a reverent woman a woman that respected him a man that respected him and believe him to be a man of God he walked back and forth up and down the floor until God answered amen then he laid himself up on the baby in his SE seven times and picked it up and give it to the mother walked on out back up the cave he went because she respected the man of God Amen God what about Martha she was always amen
