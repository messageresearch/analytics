[5:46] Lord Jesus, that was

[5:54] &gt;&gt; from the foundation of the world, Lord,
[5:57] in your mind, Lord Jesus, you planted a
[6:01] seed, Lord,
[6:04] and your enemy planted a seed, Lord,
[6:07] but your seed prevailed
[6:12] through each book of the Bible, Lord.
[6:16] from Genesis to Revelation. Lord, your
[6:19] seed prevails.
[6:22] Lord Jesus, we just thank you, Lord,
[6:24] that you kept us in mind.
[6:29] You kept us in your grace. You kept us
[6:32] in your love, Lord.
[6:34] You washed us in your blush, precious
[6:37] blood, the sacrifice on Calvary
[6:41] that bought us and kept us.
[6:45] Lord Jesus,
[6:47] just appreciate you so much, Lord.
[6:51] Lord, we just ask, Lord, tonight, Lord,
[6:54] just
[6:56] give us more. You give us more of the
[7:00] understanding, Lord, you want us to
[7:02] have, Lord.
[7:04] May the seed in us, Lord, not stay a
[7:07] seed, Lord, but may it just branch out,
[7:11] Lord, and grow into what you saw from
[7:15] the foundation of the world. Lord,
[7:18] we just love you, Lord. We just ask,
[7:21] Lord, you just be with us with us
[7:23] tonight, Lord, and the word spoken

[13:42] We talk of faith when
[13:47] we're up on the mountain,
[13:51] but talk comes so easy.
[13:56] When life's at its best,
[14:00] it's down in the valley
[14:05] of trials and temptations.
[14:10] That's when faith is
[14:14] really put to the test.
[14:18] God on the mountain.
[14:22] He's right in the valley.
[14:27] When things go wrong,
[14:32] he'll make them cry.
[14:36] The God of the good times,
[14:40] he's still God in the bad times.
[14:44] For the God of the day,
[14:48] he's still God in the night. For the God
[14:52] on the mountain, the God on the mountain
[14:57] is still God in the valley.
[15:02] When things go wrong,
[15:07] he'll make them right.
[15:11] And the God of the good times,
[15:15] he's still God in the bad times.

[30:02] friend, Brother Bates. He's from the
[30:04] church there, the Saints, the Northern
[30:06] Lights Tabernacle. Northern Lights
[30:09] Tabernacle, brother.
[30:11] I We stole her. Yeah. I don't believe in
[30:15] proceliting, but if I did,
[30:20] &gt;&gt; yeah, you did it right.
[30:22] All right. So, Brother Ike McGowan is a
[30:25] pastor and him and his dear wife, Sister
[30:28] Karen, they would have loved to be here
[30:30] during our special meetings. they were
[30:32] not able to as they're working through
[30:34] the final process of her healing there
[30:38] in in in Texas and I spoke with brother
[30:40] Ike a little bit and they just working
[30:43] those details out and brother Bates
[30:45] comes from that little church there
[30:48] beautiful saints brother Davis is one of
[30:51] the assistant pastors there and we we al
[30:55] always appreciate brother Jonathan Davis

[31:13] give the Lord a hand of praise as he
[31:15] comes. Amen.
[31:22] Thank you, brother Israel. I just feel
[31:24] right at home here.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Feel so comfortable. That was a really
[31:28] good presence this morning that was
[31:30] here. Yes, sir.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about. You know, I
[31:33] think
[31:35] &gt;&gt; if you, you know, sometimes as a
[31:37] minister, you know, I'll be at home
[31:38] praying hours before service and he
[31:41] meets you there. Sometimes I'll be back
[31:43] in the study and the songs are going and
[31:44] he'll meet you there. But he always
[31:46] never fails to meet me here. Sometimes
[31:48] he leaves me hanging till I get here,
[31:50] &gt;&gt; but he always meets us here, doesn't he,
[31:51] brother?
[31:52] &gt;&gt; You know, and then when he comes, then I
[31:54] feel like, okay, now I you know how
[31:56] brother Bram, I'm not I'm not comparing
[31:57] myself to brother Bram at all. just by
[31:59] even the skin on the bottom of his feet.
[32:00] But he'd say, you know, I'm waiting for
[32:02] something.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; We can't do anything without him. And so
[32:06] we we invite him. And I think we know
[32:08] he's here. We just want to make him
[32:09] welcome. He came with you. So he's here.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; We you know, we brought him with us. You
[32:14] brought him with you.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to turn in our
[32:17] scriptures. Appreciate Brother Poe. Good
[32:19] friend of mine. Someone I just came to
[32:22] love. The first time I I met him and
[32:23] heard him speak. I instantly in my heart
[32:26] just um we're kind of kindred spirits
[32:28] here.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Two pe's in the pod.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Love this man.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Got a good pastor, but you know the
[32:35] devil doesn't want to keep it that way.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; So you pray for this man. Hold his hands
[32:39] up. You know, he's just a man, but he
[32:42] God placed him here and I know his
[32:43] heart. So you keep him in prayer
[32:46] &gt;&gt; and uh he doesn't tell me nothing, but I
[32:49] I'm just enough to pick up. I know what
[32:50] it is to try and, you know, labor for
[32:52] group of people.
[32:55] I think sometimes being a pastor is kind
[32:56] of like being a shepherd. It's nice to
[32:59] have sheep and they're all fuzzy, but
[33:00] there's a lot of clean up to do. So,
[33:03] that's part of a pastor's job as well.
[33:06] Yes, sir.
[33:08] Get the shovel out. All right. Let's go
[33:11] turn in our Bible to the book of Let's
[33:13] just go turn to Ephesians first. We're
[33:15] going to go to the book of Ephesians
[33:17] and chapter 3. just um little tonight.
[33:21] We'll keep it brief. Got the We got the
[33:24] the cool crowd here tonight. This is the
[33:26] Is this the cool the cool crowd? We got
[33:29] all these young people here.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Good. Well, then we can just share
[33:33] from our hearts.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Don't have to worry about nothing.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Just preach the word of God. So,
[33:39] Ephesians chapter 3, we'll just start
[33:42] reading out this first verse here and
[33:43] read down to verse 13. Ephesians 3.
[33:47] For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of
[33:50] Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
[33:52] if you have heard of the dispensation of
[33:54] the grace of God, which is given me to
[33:56] you, word,
[33:58] &gt;&gt; how that by revelation
[34:00] &gt;&gt; he made known unto me the mystery, as I
[34:03] wrote a four in few words, whereby when
[34:05] you read, you may understand my
[34:07] knowledge in the mystery of Christ,
[34:09] which in other ages was not made known
[34:11] unto the sons of men, as it is now
[34:13] revealed unto his holy apostles and
[34:14] prophets by the spirit, that The
[34:17] Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of
[34:19] the same body and partakers of his
[34:20] promise in Christ by the gospel.
[34:23] Whereof I was made a minister according
[34:25] to the gift of the grace of God given
[34:28] unto me by the effectual working of his
[34:30] power
[34:32] &gt;&gt; unto me who am less than the least of
[34:34] all saints. Is this grace given that I
[34:36] should preach among the Gentiles the
[34:38] unsearchable riches of Christ
[34:41] &gt;&gt; and to make all men see what is the
[34:44] fellowship of the mystery. which from
[34:47] the beginning of the world hath been hid
[34:49] in God, who created all things by Jesus
[34:52] Christ, to the intent that now unto the
[34:54] principalities and powers and heavenly
[34:56] places might be known by the church, the
[34:59] manifold wisdom of God,
[35:02] according to the eternal purpose which
[35:04] he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord, in
[35:07] whom we have boldness and access with
[35:09] confidence by the faith of him.
[35:11] Wherefore, wherefore I desire that you
[35:13] faint not at my tribulations for you,
[35:16] which is your glory. Let's just pray.
[35:19] Gracious heavenly father, just reading
[35:20] the power of this word, a letter written
[35:24] by Apostle Paul, but it was written by
[35:26] you. He described it. Father, I had it
[35:29] scribed and now we get to read these
[35:30] words, and we're so thankful for that.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; We love you, Father. We ask that you
[35:35] would come, the inside teacher, and just
[35:37] break it to us, Lord. Help us, Father,
[35:39] just to see you in a in a mightier way.
[35:42] That we might know you in the power of
[35:44] your resurrection. And it might just
[35:45] change and transform our lives. That we
[35:48] could be more like you. That we could
[35:50] take this light to a lost and dying
[35:51] world. And they might know you as we
[35:54] know you. We ask it in Jesus Christ's
[35:55] name. Amen. You may be seated. Kind of
[35:59] interesting.
[36:00] I don't mean this to pick at anybody,
[36:02] but to some of the spirits that are out
[36:03] there that would criticize maybe us
[36:06] playing a tape of the prophet in our
[36:08] church, would they also criticize us for
[36:10] reading a letter of Paul in church?
[36:12] &gt;&gt; I wonder.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Why are you reading the letter of Paul?
[36:18] &gt;&gt; You know, why would you take he was a
[36:22] man just like brother Maram? If you can
[36:24] believe that Paul was God's man
[36:27] &gt;&gt; and you could read his letter and and
[36:28] it's part of the Bible,
[36:30] &gt;&gt; then I believe that we'll we'll think
[36:32] about the the mystery of Christ that was
[36:33] brought to us in this age.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; You know, I I think that um
[36:41] you know, the more I I've said this
[36:43] morning that the deeper it gets to me,
[36:45] the more I go in the message, but the
[36:46] simpler it gets.
[36:48] The message has never changed. is Jesus
[36:50] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[36:52] forever.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; You know, and I think there's there's
[36:57] something that if you think about this
[36:59] message,
[37:01] it's it's so powerful when you see that
[37:03] there's one thing that God wanted you to
[37:06] see
[37:07] and he had it hidden.
[37:10] It was a mystery. What does the word
[37:11] mystery mean? something Rand said that
[37:14] that's been revealed that was previously
[37:16] hidden but still has an element of
[37:17] supernatural or mystery about it.
[37:20] We can't always understand everything
[37:22] that God does, especially the
[37:23] supernatural. But I want to read you
[37:24] this out of the crisis. The mystery of
[37:26] God revealed um 630728
[37:29] paragraph 102 says, "Now God's secret
[37:32] mystery." This is what Paul was talking
[37:34] about this. He wanted everyone to see
[37:35] the fellowship of this be in fellowship
[37:37] around this mystery.
[37:39] What is our fellowship? Why do we come
[37:41] together? What brings us what is it that
[37:42] brings us together? What what is it that
[37:44] we commune around?
[37:47] Where the carcasses, the eagles gather?
[37:49] What is it we're feeding on? What is it
[37:51] that really? He says now this the secret
[37:53] mystery he had before the world began.
[37:55] So before there was ever a world, he had
[37:56] this thing hidden in himself.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Now back in the back part of God's mind,
[38:01] there was something he was trying and
[38:03] was going to achieve and he had a motive
[38:06] in doing it in order to let himself be
[38:08] expressed because first there wasn't
[38:11] even a moon, star, atom, molecule or
[38:12] anything. He was God, but he exactly
[38:15] wasn't God at that time because God is
[38:16] an object of worship and there was
[38:18] nothing to worship him. And now God had
[38:20] a purpose and a hidden mystery. And
[38:22] that's what I want to speak on to the
[38:23] church this morning. The hidden mystery
[38:25] of God that he had in his mind before
[38:27] the world ever began and how this
[38:29] unfolded itself right down to this
[38:31] present hour that we're living. See,
[38:34] &gt;&gt; then you'll understand clearly on what I
[38:36] believe what is being done.
[38:38] So this thing that God had, the whole
[38:40] purpose of everything that God created
[38:43] was to express one thing, all of it, all
[38:47] of creation, all the stories in the
[38:49] Bible, everything was one thing that he
[38:53] wanted you to see. Just one.
[38:57] God's great mystery of how it's a
[38:58] secret. He kept it a secret. Nobody knew
[39:00] anything about it. Even the angels
[39:01] didn't understand it.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; See, he didn't reveal it. That's the
[39:04] reason under our seventh mystery when
[39:06] the seventh seal was opened there was
[39:08] silence. Jesus when he was on earth they
[39:10] wanted to know when he would come. He
[39:12] said it it not even the son himself
[39:14] doesn't know when it's going to happen.
[39:16] See God has this all to himself. It's a
[39:19] secret. And that's the reason there was
[39:20] signs in heaven for a space of a half
[39:22] hour and seven thunders utter their
[39:23] voices. Now we we have how many of you
[39:26] have heard all these mysteries?
[39:28] There's the thunders mysteries and the
[39:30] this mysteries and those mysteries and
[39:32] all that. that Christ is the mystery of
[39:34] God revealed.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Who has believed our report? And to whom
[39:39] is the arm of the Lord revealed?
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; God hiding in simplicity.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Acting out something. And everybody goes
[39:46] off about all the details and they miss
[39:49] this hidden one thing he wants you to
[39:50] see.
[39:52] See, he said it's in the reason there
[39:53] was signs in him for a space of half
[39:54] hour, seven uttered voice and John was
[39:56] even forbidden to write it. See the
[39:57] coming of the Lord. Now look at this.
[40:01] this one thing he hasn't REVEALED YET OF
[40:02] HOW HE WILL come and when he will come.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Not just it's a mystery of how he is
[40:08] going to come.
[40:10] Oh,
[40:12] how many of you seen him?
[40:14] You know there's this doctrine out there
[40:16] called Peruia.
[40:18] All that really means is that his
[40:20] presence
[40:21] because you know like there I think I
[40:24] can't remember what u what group it was
[40:25] back in the early 1900s but they were
[40:28] he's coming he's coming he's coming and
[40:30] when he didn't show up physically they
[40:31] said oh he came spiritually and they
[40:32] called it peruia it was not it was
[40:35] before the message they had this Peruja
[40:36] term it's a Greek word that just means
[40:38] his appearing or his presence brother
[40:40] Brandham preached the presence of God
[40:42] unrecognized
[40:44] &gt;&gt; brother Brham preached the real Peruja
[40:46] &gt;&gt; but people just go off and they want to
[40:47] say they want to make it spiritual if
[40:49] they can't do it this way or that way.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; But but he had to come in a way to his
[40:55] bride where we could see him.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; So he could reveal himself to his bride
[41:00] so we we would know who he was.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; He wanted to reveal himself to somebody
[41:05] that wouldn't be deceived by all the
[41:07] stuff that was going to come when he
[41:09] took his prophet off the scene.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Someone who says, "No, that's not my
[41:12] husband because I know my husband. He
[41:14] revealed himself to me." Yes sir.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; So he had to reveal himself in mercy
[41:19] before he comes in judgment.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; And so this whole entire message was
[41:24] something that God was doing and
[41:25] expressing. This wasn't brother
[41:27] Brandham's idea.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Something that some man came up there
[41:30] and read his Bible and was just a good
[41:31] man and and and it was even more than a
[41:34] prophet. It was Jesus Christ saying, "I
[41:38] have hidden something that I wanted to
[41:40] hold off until the end." And I kept it
[41:42] sealed up from everybody
[41:44] &gt;&gt; of how he was going to come and when he
[41:46] was going to come.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Now look what this next this next part
[41:50] is.
[41:52] He said how he come and when he come.
[41:53] It's a good thing he doesn't know. He
[41:56] showed or revealed it. And every type
[41:58] that's in the Bible.
[42:01] Every Bible story, every type has been
[42:04] hiding this one thing.
[42:07] See how simple it really is? You mean I
[42:09] I could see this great mystery if I He
[42:12] hid it in the type of Moses. He hid it
[42:14] in the type of Noah.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; In every age, it's been a one-man
[42:18] message.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; He sends on the scene someone that
[42:22] represents him, the word, to the word
[42:23] that needs to be redeemed for that age
[42:25] and pulls them out.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; It's been the same in every age. Yeah,
[42:32] &gt;&gt; there was someone he in Moses's day he
[42:34] said I personal pronoun have heard the
[42:38] cries of my people and I personal
[42:41] pronoun have come down to deliver them
[42:43] Moses you go
[42:45] &gt;&gt; and brother Brand said that was God
[42:46] going in the form of a man
[42:50] &gt;&gt; we don't worship brother Brandham
[42:52] &gt;&gt; but we know THAT IT WAS GOD
[42:54] &gt;&gt; EXPRESSING himself
[42:56] &gt;&gt; because who was Moses who was Noah
[43:00] Butterbraham said, "If you don't see
[43:01] Jesus Christ in every scripture of the
[43:02] Bible, go back and read it again. You've
[43:04] missed it."
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Because the whole thing was was was
[43:07] hiding and revealing one thing that he
[43:09] had in his heart, one purpose.
[43:13] I just love that
[43:17] he has showed or revealed it in every
[43:19] type of in the Bible. Therefore, THE
[43:20] ENTIRE BIBLE is a revelation of God's
[43:23] mystery in Christ. H
[43:25] the entire Bible is an expression of one
[43:28] goal that God had one purpose he wanted
[43:30] to achieve in the entire Bible and all
[43:32] the acts of the believers in the Bible
[43:34] has been in type and expressing what
[43:35] God's great goal is and now in this last
[43:37] day he has revealed it and shows it and
[43:40] God's help will see it right here this
[43:42] morning what the Lord has in his mind
[43:44] all along and has expressed it. But
[43:47] Abraham said in this message Christ is
[43:48] the mystery of God revealed. He said if
[43:50] you ever miss it come back to this tape.
[43:52] Have you heard him say that?
[43:55] go back and listen to it and don't don't
[43:57] go out there and try to struggle with it
[43:58] and figure it out. Just say, "Lord,
[43:59] reveal yourself to me.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; I'm your child." And he'll give it to
[44:03] you.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; It's it's you know, it it can start with
[44:07] a I met this 10-year-old. You're you're
[44:10] 10, right? What was your name again?
[44:12] Rachel. So, I met Rachel. She's 10. Do
[44:15] you know Jesus? Yes, you do. Can you
[44:18] talk about all these great mysteries?
[44:19] Probably not. But you know him. and he
[44:23] will lead you once he reveals himself to
[44:24] you and you say, "I accept that." Then
[44:26] he'll give you more. You'll just keep
[44:27] accepting it. You'll never stop and say,
[44:29] "No, I don't believe that." Because
[44:30] you're a Christian.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; You're a believer. Believers believe the
[44:33] word. They say amen to every word.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; And so, you can't say, you know, because
[44:39] people say, "I just want Jesus and I
[44:41] do." It's Jesus only. That's what I
[44:43] believe. It's not Jesus plus anything.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; It's not even Jesus plus his bride
[44:47] because she is him. It's just him. We
[44:49] are Jesus. if we get in his you know
[44:52] right
[44:53] &gt;&gt; but you can't know Jesus apart from his
[44:55] word
[44:57] &gt;&gt; because he is the word in the beginning
[44:59] was the word and that's what was made
[45:00] flesh and walked among us full of grace
[45:02] and truth
[45:03] &gt;&gt; and went around doing what he did
[45:05] revealing who God was
[45:08] &gt;&gt; oh man don't you just love this
[45:10] &gt;&gt; amen
[45:11] you know it takes them it takes a you
[45:13] know because I think I was telling you
[45:16] like when um brother Brand preached the
[45:19] seals
[45:20] And then you know he starts with God of
[45:22] simplicity.
[45:24] God hiding in simplicity but revealing
[45:26] himself in the same. You watch a
[45:28] minister get up here in humility and in
[45:31] simplicity God can hide himself. But all
[45:33] a sudden God comes and you realize that
[45:34] wasn't that man. That's right.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; I remember Frank Dutton was a pastor of
[45:39] our church for years up there and his
[45:41] son D Ben Dutton was just, you know, the
[45:43] black sheep of the family and uh Ben was
[45:46] just, you know, he went to college and
[45:47] big big guy and like to fight in school
[45:50] and when he got back from college he got
[45:52] a a degree in criminal justice and he
[45:54] liked because they kind of think I'm not
[45:56] intellect but I'm really not but you
[45:58] know that they he he wanted to come
[46:00] cross with me a little bit
[46:01] intellectually and so we'd have
[46:02] conversations. Jesse remembers Ben, you
[46:05] know, watched him grow up. And one day
[46:08] he goes, he goes, "Jim, I know it's
[46:10] real." Because he says, "We know my
[46:12] dad." He's so add he can't keep a
[46:15] thought for five seconds.
[46:17] He goes, "Next shiny thing." You know,
[46:18] but he says when he gets behind the
[46:20] pulpit, he says, "It's like a
[46:21] quarterback in the pocket."
[46:22] &gt;&gt; He goes, "What is that?" Here's his own
[46:25] son recognizing something because he
[46:27] knew his dad better, you know, than a
[46:29] lot of people would. You know, sees all
[46:31] the backsides and the humanity of the
[46:33] man. But when when God comes on the
[46:35] scene and can hide himself in
[46:36] simplicity, he can reveal himself in the
[46:38] same.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; And God likes to do that. He likes to
[46:40] hide himself in the simple things.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; What makes God so great is he can become
[46:44] so simple that my friend Rachel can know
[46:47] him in the power of his resurrection
[46:49] &gt;&gt; and have faith in his word and move God
[46:51] on the scene. Right?
[46:55] You know, and so what I want to do this
[46:58] morning or this evening is just to think
[46:59] about this mystery that we have
[47:01] fellowship around and what it is to us.
[47:06] All right. So now let's get into another
[47:08] one.
[47:09] The unveiling of God 640614.
[47:14] He's talking about his daughter Becky
[47:17] and she was in this play called Carmen.
[47:18] It was a Shakespeare thing. They acted
[47:20] that in the in the school where she just
[47:22] graduated a few weeks ago. Now, maybe
[47:23] one person played three or four parts in
[47:25] order to do that. He changed his mask.
[47:27] Sometimes he comes out, he's this
[47:29] character. The next time he comes out,
[47:30] he's another character. But it's the
[47:31] same person all the time. And that's
[47:34] God. He changed himself from a pillar of
[47:36] fire to become a man. Then changed
[47:38] himself from that back in spirit again
[47:40] that he might dwell in man. God acting
[47:42] in man. What he really was. Jesus Christ
[47:44] was God acting in man.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; You want Jesus Christ? It's God acting
[47:50] in flesh.
[47:52] God was acting out the part of Noah. God
[47:54] was acting out the part of Moses. God
[47:55] acted out the Hebrew children in the
[47:57] fiery furnace.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; That was shadows and types. But then
[48:00] here comes in the fullness of time. And
[48:02] here comes Jesus Christ, the son of God.
[48:05] And in him was all the fullness and the
[48:07] whole expression of what God was.
[48:10] And he went to Calvary.
[48:12] But you know what? You were in him. Then
[48:16] &gt;&gt; hidden in that man was you.
[48:20] He hadn't separated the bride out of him
[48:22] yet.
[48:23] Oh, where did she come from?
[48:26] Who is the bride?
[48:28] We said that this morning about Adam.
[48:30] Called their name Adam.
[48:33] Male and female created he them and
[48:34] called their name Adam.
[48:37] And he said, and pick up your pen and
[48:39] write. How many you've read that?
[48:40] &gt;&gt; He said the reason why that he gave Adam
[48:43] a wife was to reproduce himself.
[48:46] And he said the reason why he gave
[48:48] Christ the bride was to reproduce
[48:49] himself.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; And if he's the word, then he has to
[48:53] reproduce the word.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; And when that word comes in you, a
[48:57] tabernacle that he could redeem.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; And he could hide himself in simplicity
[49:01] in that. That's what give him glory.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; He wanted to he wanted to take a
[49:06] tabernacle that needed redemption. We s
[49:09] we read that this morning in the church
[49:10] age book 103. He predestinated you that
[49:13] he needed redemption so he could give
[49:15] himself reason and purpose of being.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[49:22] &gt;&gt; He said in the church age book
[49:25] that she is his work beaten gold.
[49:29] And he's going on he said and whatever
[49:30] she is he whatever he is she is to
[49:33] manifest. You remember that part?
[49:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. And he goes down and
[49:37] finally he says in fact in her in her is
[49:40] summed up and manifested the entire
[49:42] wisdom and purpose of God.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; How can we fathom? He says we can't. We
[49:45] have to accept it by faith.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; So he knew that he was going to
[49:49] predestinate part of his word that would
[49:51] fall out there in this dirt. That's you
[49:54] flesh.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; That he could redeem that by his word to
[49:58] his word.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; And that you would be standing here
[50:01] today representing him on this earth.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[50:07] You know, and it doesn't always appear
[50:08] like what we should be. We read that
[50:10] scripture this morning. Now we are the
[50:12] sons of God,
[50:13] &gt;&gt; but we it doesn't really appear what we
[50:15] but he said, but one day we'll be like
[50:17] him because we're going to be in his
[50:18] we're going to see him face to face.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; So what we are we're struggling through
[50:22] this body that we're waiting for its
[50:23] redemption.
[50:26] We're waiting for the redemption of this
[50:28] body.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; But we are now the sons of God. We are
[50:31] now we're sitting in the heavenly places
[50:32] in Christ. We have this word right here.
[50:35] But we're waiting for a body change. How
[50:36] many wants the body change?
[50:40] Oh, but see now you remember I'm just
[50:42] going to give you a little quick little
[50:44] quick Sunday school lesson. Go back into
[50:47] the Old Testament. The the he was
[50:49] hitting in all these types. And Moses
[50:51] built this tabernacle. How remembers
[50:54] that? And all it was was just a a tent
[50:57] out in the wilderness. A tent to for
[51:00] God.
[51:01] See the type? Why wouldn't he just have
[51:04] Solomon build him a temple?
[51:07] But really, he was dwelling in a tent.
[51:09] And David had in his heart to build him
[51:11] a temple. He goes, "Why are you dwelling
[51:12] in a in a tent?" You know, when he goes,
[51:15] God said, "Look, I don't dwell in a
[51:16] temple made by man's hands." No,
[51:18] &gt;&gt; but go ahead. I'll let you build it. He
[51:21] says, "But a body hast thou prepared
[51:22] me."
[51:24] &gt;&gt; So this tent, you you go in there in the
[51:26] outer court and it's all subject to the
[51:28] weather. And then you go into the next,
[51:30] the holy place. And then it was a little
[51:31] bit more sheltered and you see the
[51:32] candlesticks and all that. But then
[51:34] there was the holy of holies,
[51:38] right? That was a type of something. God
[51:41] was acting out something.
[51:43] Where was he going to place his word?
[51:45] Behind some badger skin in a tabernacle
[51:49] showing that his whole plan. So now
[51:50] think about how you had to approach God
[51:52] to get there.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; You had to bring a sacrifice.
[51:55] Hallelujah. Man, I'm not a preacher, but
[51:57] I feel like I could preach right now.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; You had to bring a sacrifice because it
[52:01] required blood to come back and
[52:02] fellowship again with this word that you
[52:04] always were,
[52:06] &gt;&gt; but he had to bring you there.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; And so when you went in there, they had
[52:10] this this this altar
[52:12] &gt;&gt; and you had to kill the priest had to
[52:14] kill this lamb and blood was all over
[52:16] the altar. It was a messy thing
[52:19] &gt;&gt; and it was a mercy seat.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Mercy was available.
[52:23] But then they had to cleanse the
[52:25] sanctuary.
[52:26] You ever heard of cleansing of the
[52:27] sanctuary? Go look it up. Go type it in
[52:30] your message search. Butterbrand said he
[52:32] had to cleanse the sanctuary washed by
[52:34] the water of the word.
[52:37] See, and then once the cle that that was
[52:39] then now a judgment seat.
[52:42] And when we get our new body, it's no
[52:44] longer going to be a mercy seat because
[52:47] his purpose of cleansing his sanctuary
[52:49] where he's going to dwell is done.
[52:52] So through seven church ages, he's been
[52:53] revealing what was in him.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; On Calvary, when he got smitten, out
[52:58] comes seven church ages, showing each of
[53:00] those colors of the rainbow that was
[53:02] hidden in that diamond. Here's my
[53:04] attributes. Here's my gentile bride.
[53:06] Some from this age, some from that age,
[53:08] some from this age, but this is me. This
[53:10] is my bride. This is who.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hallelujah.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; She was hidden in him the entire time.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; He kept it a secret. But Greg, okay, now
[53:20] we're going to read another scripture.
[53:22] Okay, let me finish this this quote real
[53:24] quick. So he's talking about Carmen. He
[53:26] changed his mask. He comes out this
[53:27] character, but it's all the self-same
[53:28] person. And that's that's God. He
[53:30] changed himself from a pillar fire to
[53:31] become a man, then changed himself back
[53:32] again, right? And so he he might dwell
[53:35] in man. God acting a man. What he's
[53:37] really was Jesus Christ was God acting a
[53:39] man in a man. In a man, that's what he
[53:40] was. He changed from the pillar of fire.
[53:42] Then he come in which was a veil in the
[53:44] wilderness that God hid from Israel.
[53:45] Moses seen the shape of his body, but
[53:47] really he was hid all the time behind
[53:49] this pillar of fire, which was a logos
[53:50] that went out from God. But it's the
[53:52] same person all the time. The same
[53:54] person, God all time. In his way, he
[53:57] reveals himself to his people. And doing
[53:58] this, notice, see, he's revealing
[54:00] himself. What did he come in this form
[54:02] in our day for the same pillar of fire?
[54:04] The same pillar of fire.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; The same pillar of fire,
[54:08] &gt;&gt; the same logos,
[54:10] &gt;&gt; why would people be embarrassed about
[54:12] putting this picture on your wall?
[54:15] IT'S A PICTURE OF GOD.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; AND his prophet
[54:21] &gt;&gt; vindicating the word came to a prophet
[54:23] and that's how it came to us.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; You receive this word because you
[54:28] received a prophet.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; You can't receive the prophet, you can't
[54:32] receive the word.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; It's that simple.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; You want Jesus? How many want Jesus?
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Then we have to receive the one he sent.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; You want to do the works of God? Receive
[54:43] God. the one that God sends to you.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; And you were born to receive it because
[54:48] every age there was those who could
[54:50] receive the message for their day.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; It wasn't very many.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; No. Noah's day was a very few. Moses's
[54:59] day, two, one in a million. Got into the
[55:01] promised land. Yeah. It's it's 120 in
[55:04] the upper room. Out of all Jesus's walk
[55:07] across, you know, his ministry, 120 in
[55:10] the upper room. How many out of this
[55:12] age? I don't know, but I believe there's
[55:13] a couple in here.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Just just say, "I'M ONE OF THEM."
[55:19] &gt;&gt; ONE OF THEM.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; You know, the doubter might start
[55:22] doubting, but he's a dissolver of
[55:23] doubts. Just say, "Lord, I want to move
[55:26] all this away and let that come forth
[55:27] right from here."
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Just say what he said.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Confess his word. Love that. So, now
[55:33] let's read another scripture.
[55:34] Colossians. Where are we on time?
[55:37] Okay, we're doing good. Colossians
[55:38] chapter 1.
[55:41] See, because because when you see this,
[55:43] it takes away all this mysterious thing
[55:46] about
[55:47] Godhead and everything else, but God has
[55:48] to reveal it to you. It's sovereign. I
[55:50] can't reveal it to you. I'm just going
[55:51] to get you where you can find it, right
[55:52] here in the word. But you ask God to
[55:54] show you this. It's really simple. When
[55:56] you see it, you say, "Oh, I see that."
[56:00] Colossians chapter 1. Now, Abraham used
[56:02] this text for his crisis, the mystery of
[56:03] God revealed. He also um used it in
[56:06] knoweth it not.
[56:08] You should listen to him read it and
[56:09] knoweth it not. and knoworth it not that
[56:11] little message and if you remember that
[56:13] brother Neville had just asked brother
[56:15] Bram to speak like ad hoc he come in he
[56:17] says brother Bram and he's up there he
[56:18] goes um he said I was reading somewhere
[56:20] that was interesting to me where was
[56:21] that at he goes oh yeah here so brother
[56:23] Bram just contacts a scripture and
[56:24] preaches a whole entire message on
[56:26] knoweth it not but in in the middle of
[56:29] that message because he was he was
[56:31] reading that about um our church age
[56:33] that they were blind naked miserable
[56:35] poor and didn't know it said knoweth it
[56:36] not but in the middle of that he reads
[56:38] this scripture and you should hear him
[56:39] read it on there. Go play that part of
[56:42] the tape and knoweth it not and listen
[56:44] to brother Ram talking about this
[56:45] scripture we're going to read. He goes,
[56:46] "Who is this?" HE GOES, "BUTTER RAM ON
[56:49] TAPE." You know, just this is such a
[56:51] powerful scripture. So, we're going to
[56:52] start verse 12.
[56:54] Giving thanks unto who?
[56:56] &gt;&gt; The father. Okay, now we're talking
[56:59] about God the Father, which hath made us
[57:02] meat to be partakers of the inheritance
[57:04] of the saints in light, who hath
[57:06] delivered us from the power of darkness,
[57:08] and has translated us into the kingdom
[57:09] of his dear what?
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Son. So now, we were talking about the
[57:13] father. Now we're talking about his dear
[57:15] son.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; How many gods do we have? One. Okay, now
[57:19] listen to this. In whom, the son, we
[57:23] have redemption through his blood, even
[57:25] the forgiveness of sins. We talked about
[57:26] that this morning, right? We're
[57:28] forgiven.
[57:30] Who is this? The son who is the image
[57:34] &gt;&gt; of the invisible God, the firstborn of
[57:37] every creature.
[57:40] So this invisible God now had an image.
[57:43] He was expressing himself to the world
[57:45] through Jesus Christ who was the
[57:46] firstborn of every creature.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; The part of the body of Christ. If
[57:50] you're part of the body of Christ,
[57:51] you're Jesus. You're part of his body.
[57:54] You're just one of the members.
[57:56] Now listen.
[57:58] For wait, who is this now? This son
[58:00] we're talking about. For by him, who?
[58:02] The son.
[58:03] WERE ALL THINGS CREATED. WHAT?
[58:05] &gt;&gt; All things.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; How many things were created by the sun?
[58:09] &gt;&gt; All things
[58:11] that are in heaven. Where? And on earth,
[58:15] whether they're visible and in
[58:16] invisible, whether they be thrones,
[58:18] dominions, principalities, or powers,
[58:20] all things were created by him and for
[58:23] him.
[58:24] So then who is the son?
[58:26] &gt;&gt; He's God.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; It's just an office that he was going to
[58:30] put where we could see him because we
[58:32] couldn't see the invisible God. So he
[58:33] had to become visible. So the word
[58:35] became made flesh so we could see who he
[58:38] was. And when you saw Jesus, they saw
[58:41] Jesus. They saw here's a simple ordinary
[58:43] little man, God hiding in simplicity,
[58:44] but look what he did.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; And and somebody saw that and said
[58:49] that's the one. I'm going to follow
[58:51] that.
[58:52] When you saw Jesus in our day come the
[58:55] word hidden in flesh again in a redeemed
[58:57] body you just said that's it that's
[59:00] God's voice I'm following it you were
[59:03] ordained for this
[59:04] &gt;&gt; to be part of this mystery now listen a
[59:07] little further
[59:09] and brother said when he's preaching
[59:11] this there in north he goes he says then
[59:13] before there was father son or holy
[59:14] ghost he was because he created all
[59:17] things thrones dominions powers
[59:19] principalities whether it was father son
[59:20] or holy ghost he created that he's the
[59:23] author of all of it. Now, so let's go a
[59:25] little further. And he is before all
[59:28] things and by him all things consist.
[59:32] Do you see who Jesus is? It's this
[59:35] invisible great God that had this this
[59:37] attribute in him that he wanted to
[59:38] express. And so out come this entire
[59:40] Bible showing what he had hidden in him
[59:43] which was Christ in you, the hope of
[59:45] glory. That's the mystery. That's the
[59:49] mystery that God had that HE COULD TAKE
[59:50] THIS WORD THAT'S CREATED HEAVEN AND
[59:52] EARTH AND PUT IT IN you
[59:54] &gt;&gt; a redeemed vessel
[59:56] &gt;&gt; and say this is my bride because she is
[59:58] the word.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; She says nothing but the word. She
[1:00:02] believes nothing but the word.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; She says amen to every word because she
[1:00:05] is the word. Brother Brand said the
[1:00:06] reason why the bride can't be deceived
[1:00:08] is because she is that word.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; She He said she doesn't know nothing
[1:00:12] else. She can't believe nothing else.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Right. You can't be deceived not because
[1:00:18] you know you have some intellectual
[1:00:19] power. It's because you are the word.
[1:00:21] When you let the word go through you,
[1:00:23] you are the word.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Now listen, he goes a little further.
[1:00:27] And he is the head of the body, the
[1:00:29] church. Let's just stop there for a
[1:00:31] minute
[1:00:33] there. Brother Bram said, there's only
[1:00:35] one provided place of worship.
[1:00:37] There's only one place we can come and
[1:00:39] fellowship around this mystery.
[1:00:42] And you know, you have all these, you
[1:00:43] say, well, why are there so many
[1:00:44] churches? That's okay. Churches are all
[1:00:47] good. I'm not against any churches. It's
[1:00:49] just a place where we can come and
[1:00:50] gather together. Bunch of rock tumblers
[1:00:52] is what I call them. Getting these rocks
[1:00:54] all He knows what church to put you in.
[1:00:56] He knows where to place you. But when we
[1:00:58] go up in the rapture, he said, "All
[1:00:59] these stones will come together
[1:01:00] perfectly."
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; You know, when they built the temple,
[1:01:03] there wasn't a sound of a sammer, a
[1:01:04] hammer, or saw. That was all done in the
[1:01:06] rock core. That's where we're at right
[1:01:07] now.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; We're getting all the rough edges
[1:01:09] knocked off us. We're getting everything
[1:01:10] ready for the rapture. But when he calls
[1:01:12] us and we go in this this this this
[1:01:14] building is going to fit perfectly
[1:01:15] together. You're going to be right in
[1:01:17] your place where you're supposed to be
[1:01:18] and all the believers from every church
[1:01:19] is going to be in that.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Right? So the church is just a rock
[1:01:23] quarry place where God put you for a
[1:01:25] while so we can get some of those things
[1:01:27] knocked off. Iron sharpens iron, brother
[1:01:29] Caleb, he'll come and say, "Brother
[1:01:30] Bates," you know, and he'll knock a
[1:01:31] little iron off of me and I'll knock a
[1:01:33] little back off of him. And but I love
[1:01:35] that because, you know, he made us that
[1:01:37] way. We're just men. We're just men and
[1:01:38] women. We're just humans. But but I like
[1:01:41] this because the head we have fellowship
[1:01:45] when we're our body connected to the
[1:01:46] same headship.
[1:01:50] So all these parts that are moving right
[1:01:52] now are all tied to this headship.
[1:01:53] That's the intelligence making it move.
[1:01:56] Your intelligence isn't making my hands
[1:01:57] move.
[1:02:00] So if we had the same head then we had
[1:02:02] the same revelation. If we had the same
[1:02:05] re that doesn't mean we're in the same
[1:02:06] spot. we progress, but it means that we
[1:02:09] had the same absolute.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; And so if I come to somebody and they
[1:02:14] they they they say, "Well, I can't
[1:02:15] believe that what brother said." Well,
[1:02:16] then I'm sorry you're not hooked to the
[1:02:18] same head I'm hooked to.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; I I love you, but I can't fellowship
[1:02:22] with you around this mystery because you
[1:02:23] can't acknowledge the same headship.
[1:02:25] That's
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; We're all one body. There's no shisms in
[1:02:28] this body. We're part of the body of
[1:02:30] Christ.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; It is his revelation. It's his word.
[1:02:33] It's his revelation. We just get
[1:02:35] attached to it because we are part of
[1:02:37] it. And then if we are then that's what
[1:02:39] said the evidence that you have the Holy
[1:02:41] Ghost is that you say amen to every
[1:02:43] word.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; You might not understand it but you'll
[1:02:46] say amen to it.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[1:02:50] blood. H that's a hard saying, you know.
[1:02:53] Well, then you're going to see the son
[1:02:54] of go. They started walking away. Goes
[1:02:56] to his 12. You're going to go to where
[1:02:57] are we going to go?
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Thou alone has the words of life. We're
[1:03:00] hooked to this headship. I don't
[1:03:01] understand it, but I'm going to believe
[1:03:02] it.
[1:03:04] I'm going to have a tent. People are
[1:03:06] like, "What? He said it.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; WHAT DO I DO WITH IT?" I just believe
[1:03:10] it.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; He's going to get a bear. It's twice as
[1:03:13] big as one as his den. Well, he broke
[1:03:15] the vision. He did. I don't They can say
[1:03:16] all they want to say. I don't need to
[1:03:17] do. All I know is what he said. I just
[1:03:19] say, "Amen."
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; I don't have to worry about it.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; There's no fuss. There's no fight.
[1:03:23] There's no pressure. I just rested it.
[1:03:26] I'm resting on it.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "Say what's on the tapes."
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so if there is something in us
[1:03:34] that's part of this body, the mystery of
[1:03:36] Christ is in you. You're just going to
[1:03:37] say amen to what he said. He's testing
[1:03:39] us.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; He's giving you the word test.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Will you will you believe it no matter
[1:03:43] what?
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; He told Abraham, "You're going to have a
[1:03:46] baby by Sarah. She was barren."
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; And he let him go 25 years. Getting
[1:03:51] harder and harder and harder and harder
[1:03:53] to see it physically actually going to
[1:03:55] happen. But he believed it anyhow. Did
[1:03:58] he have his struggles? Like we we talked
[1:04:00] about this morning. He battled. The same
[1:04:02] devil wanted to sift him. He went with
[1:04:04] Hagar. He got Ishmael. He had all those
[1:04:06] things happen. He laughed. But when God
[1:04:08] wrote the record, he said he didn't
[1:04:10] stagger.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; He grew stronger in the faith.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; He believed God.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; That's what he's going to write about
[1:04:17] you.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; You didn't stagger. Well, yeah. You say,
[1:04:20] "Well, you don't see my struggle." I
[1:04:21] don't have to see your struggles. God
[1:04:23] knows.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; If you got that seed in here, it's going
[1:04:26] to say amen to every word.
[1:04:29] And and in the mystery of Christ is that
[1:04:31] word in us. We'll read a little further.
[1:04:33] It's right here. So that headship is so
[1:04:36] important. Who is the beginning, the
[1:04:38] firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:04:39] things he might have the preeminence. So
[1:04:41] give him the preeminence.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; When we come the church, give him the
[1:04:44] preeminence. What? What? And who is he?
[1:04:47] The word revealed in this hour.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; We're not ashamed of it.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; It's our life.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; It's him. It's Jesus Christ.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; It's our absolute. It's my everything.
[1:04:58] It's my all. I've given everything for
[1:04:59] this.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; I I've st my life on it.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; For it pleased the father that in him
[1:05:07] the son
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; should all fullness dwell.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Where's there any other fullness then?
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Where's there any other god then?
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; And having made peace through the body
[1:05:20] blood of his cross by HIM TO RECONCILE
[1:05:22] ALL THINGS UNTO HIMSELF. By this I say,
[1:05:24] whether they be things in heaven or
[1:05:25] thing or on in earth or things in
[1:05:27] heaven.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; And you THAT WERE SOMETIMES alienated
[1:05:30] and enemies in your mind by wicked
[1:05:33] works, yet now hath he reconciled.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; We were his enemy
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; by our wicked works, separated from him,
[1:05:41] but he made a way to cleanse the
[1:05:43] sanctuary.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; So that he could dwell in there.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; So then what? We have to give him
[1:05:48] everything. We have to say I'm this is
[1:05:50] not my idea. It doesn't matter about
[1:05:52] what I think. It's his idea.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; I'm hooked to this headship. This finger
[1:05:55] doesn't get a thought.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; It's not sitting there going, I don't
[1:05:58] want to go over there and grab that
[1:05:59] thing. It's just just it obeys the
[1:06:00] headship.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Headship says live this way. We just
[1:06:03] live this way.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; We got that life in us. You know, have
[1:06:06] you ever laid on your arm
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; and it you cut the blood off
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; and then the head's telling to move and
[1:06:12] it's it can't there's no connection
[1:06:13] because the blood's been cut off.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden you you know you you
[1:06:18] get restored back to the blood again.
[1:06:20] You get restored back to the father. You
[1:06:21] get restored to the headship and all a
[1:06:22] sudden it starts tingling and hurting a
[1:06:24] little bit.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; But man, I'm telling you what, it'll
[1:06:26] start working again. And now I can I can
[1:06:28] I can communicate with my headship.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; He has preeminence.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; We have to keep the blood flowing. And
[1:06:33] go back to Calvary if you've missed it.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; It's where it all started right there
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; where he made a bleach for us to be
[1:06:40] washed so he can cleanse his sanctuary
[1:06:41] so he could live in you.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Go listen to invisible union of a bride.
[1:06:47] Washed by the bleeding word. Washed by
[1:06:48] the water of the word. No fault in you.
[1:06:50] the perfect sinless spotless bride of
[1:06:52] the living God.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; How? By his word and you accepted it. He
[1:06:58] said, "How can you be washed if you
[1:06:59] won't? Let the word do it." So let the
[1:07:01] word have preeminence in your life. Here
[1:07:03] we go a little bit further.
[1:07:06] And you that were sometimes alienated to
[1:07:07] enemies in your mind by wicked works.
[1:07:08] Yet now the reconciled. So don't be
[1:07:10] putting other people out because they're
[1:07:11] enemies because they that you were an
[1:07:14] enemy once.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; We had that conversation.
[1:07:17] And now, you know, maybe maybe God can
[1:07:20] bring them in like he did you.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; So, just be careful. Be careful who
[1:07:24] you're talking about. It might be a Saul
[1:07:25] of Tarsus that might be Paul. It might
[1:07:27] be even Saul in the Old Testament who
[1:07:29] still went to paradise with Samuel. Even
[1:07:32] though he backslid, was chasing David
[1:07:33] around, he was still God's.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Careful who you talk about.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; I have too much to worry about myself to
[1:07:40] worry about anybody else.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; My biggest I saw a little cartoon the
[1:07:44] other day. This guy was down there
[1:07:45] praying, "Lord, smite my enemies." And
[1:07:47] he said, 'Lord, smite my worst enemies
[1:07:49] with a plague of locust. And all a
[1:07:50] sudden, locus all over him. He goes,
[1:07:50] "Uh, let me rephrase that." His worst
[1:07:53] enemy was himself, right? No, this is
[1:07:57] the guy I got to worry about. This
[1:07:58] flesh,
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; keep him down. Keep him dead.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:03] Yeah. So now in this body of flesh that
[1:08:05] through death TO PRESENT YOU HOLY AND
[1:08:08] UNBLAMEABLE AND UNREPROVABLE in his
[1:08:11] sight.
[1:08:12] That's what he did all this for, was for
[1:08:14] you.
[1:08:16] If you continue in the faith grounded
[1:08:17] and settled, and be not moved away from
[1:08:19] the hope of the gospel which you have
[1:08:20] heard, which was preached to every
[1:08:21] creature under which is under heaven,
[1:08:23] where have I, Paul, made a minister, who
[1:08:25] now rejoice in my suffering for you, and
[1:08:28] fill up that which is behind of the
[1:08:29] afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for
[1:08:31] his body's sake, which is the church,
[1:08:32] where have I made a minister according
[1:08:34] to the dispensation of God, which is
[1:08:35] given to me to for you to fulfill the
[1:08:37] word of God, even the mystery WHICH HAS
[1:08:40] BEEN HID from ages and FROM GENERATIONS,
[1:08:42] BUT NOW IS MADE MANIFEST TO HIS SAINTS,
[1:08:45] to whom God would make known what is the
[1:08:47] riches of the glory of his mystery among
[1:08:48] the Gentiles which is Christ in you.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. This mystery, this
[1:08:53] mystery
[1:08:56] was Christ in you.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; This word that created heaven and earth.
[1:09:00] This one that the son that was the
[1:09:03] kingdom of his dear son. And where's the
[1:09:05] where's the king's throne at?
[1:09:09] Where does he reign from? He sits and he
[1:09:11] reigns from the throne in my heart. Why?
[1:09:14] Because the word sits right here.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; This is now the control tower. Not this.
[1:09:20] Not reasoning, not motions, not
[1:09:22] conscience, not all my memories, but
[1:09:24] right here, the word of God. I just say,
[1:09:26] "Amen. I believe the word."
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; I don't have to understand it because
[1:09:30] there's no reasoning cap capabilities
[1:09:32] down here.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; You know that there's no reasoning in
[1:09:35] here. It's just faith or doubt.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; It doesn't sit there and go, I wonder if
[1:09:39] Well, how could that be? When maybe that
[1:09:40] what? No. There's just I believe the
[1:09:42] word.
[1:09:44] You know, so when you hear these things
[1:09:45] that people make doctrines out of, well,
[1:09:47] if they're from the word of God, they're
[1:09:48] the word of God. They've been doing that
[1:09:50] for ages with the Bible. They did it
[1:09:51] with the message. So you hear all these
[1:09:53] things where they take a mystery and
[1:09:54] they make some mysterious thing where
[1:09:55] you have to have them. No, it's Christ
[1:09:57] is the mystery of God revealed to you.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; And how he reveals himself to you, you
[1:10:02] just take that and say amen and say,
[1:10:03] "Lord, show me more." And I'll say amen
[1:10:04] to it because I'm one of yours. I'm
[1:10:06] giving this place right here where it's
[1:10:08] a preeminent in my life where this word
[1:10:10] is my headship.
[1:10:13] So now he goes on and says um Christ in
[1:10:16] you the hope of glory. That's what it
[1:10:18] is. Who whom we preach warning every man
[1:10:19] and teaching every man in all wisdom
[1:10:21] that we may present every man perfect in
[1:10:22] Christ Jesus. That's what he was trying
[1:10:24] to do. That's what brother Brand was
[1:10:25] trying to do. He wanted to present you
[1:10:26] perfect as a bride to Christ.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; And he knew that it was going to be a
[1:10:32] struggle because he knew the devil was
[1:10:34] coming and all these distractions and
[1:10:35] all these false teachers and all this
[1:10:37] stuff and these, you know, antichrist
[1:10:39] spirit was going to come. But he said,
[1:10:41] 'I know the seed word of God will not
[1:10:43] fail because it's God's word. And where
[1:10:46] do he place it? Right here. Christ in
[1:10:47] you, the hope of glory. That's the
[1:10:48] mystery. The fellowship that we have is
[1:10:50] that we're believers. We have the same
[1:10:52] headship. I'll just read you a couple
[1:10:54] more things and then we'll be done. Who
[1:10:56] is this? Mazdc 652021E.
[1:11:01] Now notice, praise God for opening these
[1:11:02] seals is my prayer to know these things.
[1:11:04] Aren't you glad he opened the seals and
[1:11:06] revealed Jesus Christ?
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; He's just the word. He's the same
[1:11:08] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; He revealed it in every type in the
[1:11:11] Bible. And here we are. Now it's our
[1:11:13] turn. These are the these are the the
[1:11:15] flesh of this generation that he's using
[1:11:17] to act out his part. His final his final
[1:11:20] act.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; All the ages look to this age
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; because it's the top of the pyramid.
[1:11:25] It's the it's going to bring the
[1:11:26] headstone. Aren't you excited? Does that
[1:11:29] make you excited?
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; I love sister Sharon. She just she
[1:11:34] always has the same look on her face,
[1:11:37] but it's just like receiving the word
[1:11:39] and smiling about it. She's kind of
[1:11:41] quiet, not like her dad. He's a little
[1:11:44] more a little more noisy,
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; but I like it, sister. God bless you. I
[1:11:50] feel that. You know, we're all part
[1:11:52] we're connected to the same headship and
[1:11:54] we can feel that.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; That's really good. Okay. So, what he
[1:11:58] said comes into view. So, he says, "Now
[1:11:59] the true revelation of Melzdc comes into
[1:12:01] view." What? He was God the Word before
[1:12:03] he became flesh. God the word because he
[1:12:06] had to be. No one else could be immortal
[1:12:07] like him. See, I had a father, brother.
[1:12:09] You did, too. Jesus had father and
[1:12:11] mother, but this man had no father or no
[1:12:13] mother.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus had a time he started. This man
[1:12:15] didn't. Jesus gave his life. This man
[1:12:17] couldn't because he was life. And it's
[1:12:19] the selfsame man all the time. I hope
[1:12:22] God reveals it to you. The selfsame
[1:12:25] person all the time.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus was hiding himself through
[1:12:30] all the entire Bible, showing his
[1:12:31] redemptive story through a one-man
[1:12:34] message in each age. But all that was a
[1:12:37] type of this age when he could finally
[1:12:39] bring his bride up and go, "Now this is
[1:12:40] her. I had this hidden me the entire
[1:12:42] time. I had hidden in me."
[1:12:46] So Satan was like looking like, "Who are
[1:12:48] these people?
[1:12:50] How is this possible?"
[1:12:53] You know, I I was able to get all the
[1:12:54] other wives to fail. I got Eve to fail.
[1:12:58] I got Israel, you know, to fail as a
[1:12:59] wife of God. I got the Jews to fail. You
[1:13:02] know, when Jesus came, I got him to fall
[1:13:05] in in in Ephesian church age when they
[1:13:07] started relaxing, drifting and the
[1:13:08] dickens came in and conquered the
[1:13:10] church. I was able to get in there and
[1:13:12] put my seat in there and make a bunch of
[1:13:15] hybrid church members.
[1:13:17] How is it that there's a word in this
[1:13:19] last age that won't spoil her skirts of
[1:13:21] purity
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; because she can't be nothing else?
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. MAN, I love that. Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Man, I just I as someone like me, a
[1:13:30] nobody from Alaska that was just a dead
[1:13:31] drunk in the gutter when he found me.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; But now I'm a dead badger and behind
[1:13:35] here is a shikina glory.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; I I start to think some days I get up in
[1:13:40] the morning, I go, "DO YOU REALIZE, JIM
[1:13:41] BATES, THAT RIGHT here is the one that
[1:13:43] created heaven and earth
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; and your little problems about your
[1:13:46] bills or this or that and the other?
[1:13:47] What What are YOU THINKING?
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; GET OUT OF HIS WAY."
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. And I don't care what happens.
[1:13:53] You can take You can take it all, but
[1:13:54] just give me Jesus. You can have my
[1:13:56] houses, my cars, my jobs. You can take
[1:13:58] everything. Just give me Jesus.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Because what what could be compared to
[1:14:02] this?
[1:14:03] There's nothing. We're almost there.
[1:14:05] We're right at the finish line, folks.
[1:14:06] We're right here.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Right around the corner. Okay, let me
[1:14:12] read this and then I think we're going
[1:14:13] to wrap up. This is out of trying to do
[1:14:15] God's service without being God's will.
[1:14:19] 65 11127b.
[1:14:21] How many ever seen the picture of a cow
[1:14:24] in the bush? that you have to look and
[1:14:26] look and you know have you ever seen
[1:14:27] those ones where you have to kind of
[1:14:28] like there's like a pattern you got to
[1:14:30] go like this all a sudden boom there's
[1:14:31] some 3D pictures in there hidden
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; and all a sudden you're like whoa you've
[1:14:34] seen those
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; those pretty cool you're like well all
[1:14:38] that artist put all that together to
[1:14:40] hide one thing in there and then you
[1:14:41] have to look at it a certain way and all
[1:14:42] a sudden you see it and that's all you
[1:14:43] can see look at whatever says here he
[1:14:45] goes see that painter or he said like a
[1:14:47] picture of Christ in a bush or a sky or
[1:14:49] the clouds see that painter has got that
[1:14:51] so fixed up till you have to look at it
[1:14:53] a certain way well then once You see it,
[1:14:55] you can't see nothing else but that.
[1:14:58] Every time you look, there it is. How
[1:14:59] many seen those pictures? Well, sure you
[1:15:01] have. Well, that's the way Christ is
[1:15:03] himself. The gospel, the message is once
[1:15:06] you see the message of the hour, there's
[1:15:07] nothing else you can see but that.
[1:15:17] got all the creation. He spent all this
[1:15:19] time making this creation and all this
[1:15:21] time crafting all the stories in this
[1:15:23] Bible, but all of it was hiding this one
[1:15:25] thing.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; And all a sudden, you see it and you go,
[1:15:28] "Oh, I see it. It's Jesus. I can't
[1:15:30] explain it to nobody, but I see it.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; It's it's just it's the deep call to the
[1:15:35] deep."
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; I I RESPOND TO THIS WORD. I RESPOND TO
[1:15:38] THIS MESSAGE. I BELIEVE IT.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something?
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; You can't see nothing else.
[1:15:46] the rest of it's just a filler.
[1:15:49] Everything else is gone. You mean all
[1:15:51] these other things? And the people out
[1:15:52] here, you know, they're talking about
[1:15:53] all these details, but they miss him.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; They're arguing about what color his
[1:15:57] eyes are. Well, no, it's this kind of
[1:15:58] blue. No, it's that kind of blue. No,
[1:15:59] it's this kind of, you know, what color
[1:16:00] of hair did he have? Well, you know, but
[1:16:02] they miss him.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; They can argue about all the details,
[1:16:07] but that's just a filler. That's just
[1:16:09] something he was veiled in so that you
[1:16:11] could see who he is. This word for this
[1:16:13] hour.
[1:16:15] Don't get caught up in all this arguing
[1:16:17] and fussing over little details. Just
[1:16:19] say, "No, it's Christ and I believe it
[1:16:21] all."
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; And if you're in this word, you should
[1:16:24] know your mate. Brother said that.
[1:16:26] That's feast of the trumpets. That's a
[1:16:27] freebie. Feast of the trumpets. He said,
[1:16:29] he said, "How is a bride going to know
[1:16:30] her mate, the revealed word, lest she's
[1:16:31] constantly in the word to know who he
[1:16:33] is?"
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; You find him when you get in the word.
[1:16:35] So get in the word.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; It's your life. It's everything to you.
[1:16:38] You're part of it. Why wouldn't you want
[1:16:40] to be into it studying it? Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Get into Christ.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Enter in.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Push play and hear the voice every day.
[1:16:49] If you can read your Bible,
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; say, "Lord, I this is me.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; I was hidden in you and this is me. I
[1:16:57] want to know more about it." And guess
[1:17:00] what? eternity is going to continue to
[1:17:01] reveal it on and on and on. Whatever's
[1:17:03] whatever's in eternity, there's no
[1:17:05] beginning or ending. So I I heard
[1:17:06] brother Brandon say all of eternity. And
[1:17:08] so I'll say all, but there's no all
[1:17:10] because eternity has no beginning or
[1:17:11] end. I think brother Brand just we have
[1:17:13] to use our little vernacular to be able
[1:17:14] to describe what we know. We're we're
[1:17:16] creatures of time. There's always
[1:17:17] yesterday and tomorrow, but with him
[1:17:18] it's just I am
[1:17:21] not I was or will be. I am.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; That's what you're part of.
[1:17:27] See now he says the rest of us just a
[1:17:28] filler. See once you see the message
[1:17:31] that's in Noah's time when Noah his
[1:17:33] group see when they saw the message
[1:17:34] nothing else mattered. Get in the ark.
[1:17:36] Right? When Moses's group saw it nothing
[1:17:38] else mattered. When John's group saw it
[1:17:40] nothing else mattered. When Jesus group
[1:17:41] saw it, nothing else mattered. When the
[1:17:42] apostles group saw it, nothing else
[1:17:43] mattered. When Luther's group saw it,
[1:17:45] Wes's group, Pentecostal group, nothing
[1:17:47] else mattered. But what about our day,
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; See, he he he predestinated you for this
[1:17:55] age.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; And once you see it, nothing else
[1:17:57] matters.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; I I hear them all talking now, and I
[1:18:01] just feel like it's, you know, what was
[1:18:03] that Charlie Brown's teacher on the
[1:18:05] phone?
[1:18:07] It's like I I just It's soundproof to me
[1:18:08] now. I'm in the inner veil with Christ,
[1:18:10] the word, and all these people out here
[1:18:12] going, but what about this? What about
[1:18:14] too late for me? Sorry.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; I don't see nothing else. I can't hear
[1:18:18] nothing else. Nothing else matters.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; I found it.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; The girls in Alaska used to sing a
[1:18:25] little song, you know, I found him. What
[1:18:27] my soul, my soul had craved. Hallelujah.
[1:18:30] You know, I found it.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; The woman at the well, she was sitting
[1:18:33] there one day in her cage, a eagle in
[1:18:36] her cage, beating her head against the
[1:18:38] thing. married five times, living with
[1:18:40] some guy, no hope by the law. SHE WAS
[1:18:42] DONE.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; SHE WAS DONE. THE LAW SAID, "YOU'RE AN
[1:18:46] ADULTERESS. You're going to hell."
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Society had put her out. She
[1:18:53] couldn't go to the well at the same time
[1:18:54] as the other women. The church had put
[1:18:55] her out, and she probably put herself
[1:18:57] out, but Jesus didn't put her out. I
[1:18:59] have needs to go by Samaria because
[1:19:01] there's a little eagle there that was in
[1:19:03] me hidden before there was a world that
[1:19:05] I got to go bring a message to and she's
[1:19:07] going to receive it.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; And one day he came to her AND SHE SAYS,
[1:19:10] "OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; I FOUND IT. BUT MY SOUL IS CRAVED.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; The deep calls to the deep." That's all.
[1:19:19] It's that simple. There was something
[1:19:20] needed to be quickened.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; And it quickened you to the word
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; and the word is our absolute. It's our
[1:19:25] headship. I don't care if if my friend
[1:19:28] Rachel come to me and said, "Brother
[1:19:29] Bates, didn't brother Bram say,"Yes,
[1:19:31] ma'am. That's my absolute. I don't care
[1:19:33] who's packing it."
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm submitted to the word.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Now, you'll bring people will come to
[1:19:40] you with a quote. Now, that's just a
[1:19:41] devil. It's written. Well, it's also
[1:19:43] written, devil. It's also written.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; That's what I love about your pastor.
[1:19:47] He's got such a balance in this message.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Keep him in prayer.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Devil always tries to pull you one way
[1:19:52] or the other, but that's finding a
[1:19:54] balance in this message. That's only the
[1:19:55] Holy Spirit can do that.
[1:19:58] See, so we were predestinated for things
[1:20:00] to happen for this day.
[1:20:03] That's the mystery of Christ. The
[1:20:05] fellowship we have is that he revealed
[1:20:06] to you message and that's all you can
[1:20:09] see and nothing else matters. We have a
[1:20:11] headship. We have an absolute that
[1:20:13] should give us something to rejoice
[1:20:14] about. I had one more quote out of
[1:20:16] Masterpiece, but we won't read it now.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; You want to read it?
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Read it. Okay, we're going to read it.
[1:20:24] Well, I sound like I got some believers
[1:20:26] in here.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; I remember when I You guys I I I think I
[1:20:30] shared a little my testimony with you,
[1:20:31] but I used to play in a rock band back
[1:20:33] in the 80s and up in Alaska and it had
[1:20:35] big hair. You sisters would be jealous.
[1:20:38] I had hair that looked like you put
[1:20:39] curlers in it. I'm not joking you. I'll
[1:20:40] show you a picture after church if you
[1:20:41] don't believe me. It literally looked
[1:20:43] like you put curlers in it.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; And I was embarrassed about that. So,
[1:20:46] I'd feather it out. And
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; but you know, in in that state of mind,
[1:20:50] I I was still one of God's eagles.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:54] And you know, and I didn't know he was
[1:20:55] coming to me, but he was.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; I was an enemy to God with my my
[1:20:59] actions.
[1:21:01] But something on the inside of me
[1:21:02] quickened when he came to me. And out of
[1:21:05] all the people on the planet he could
[1:21:06] have picked, why did he pick me?
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; You know, addicted to everything, just
[1:21:11] doing dumb stuff.
[1:21:13] But man, I'm telling you what, it
[1:21:14] changed my life just listening to one
[1:21:16] tape.
[1:21:18] It was a lead guitar player of my rock
[1:21:19] band that handed me my first tape.
[1:21:22] He didn't he didn't he his not even in
[1:21:24] this message but he gave me my first
[1:21:26] tape. There's a man here can turn on a
[1:21:27] light.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; I played that in my little truck and I
[1:21:30] had a stereo that would just rock the
[1:21:32] coffee off the top of the roof because I
[1:21:33] mean I had the the the blooper and the
[1:21:35] beater in my back. You know I could get
[1:21:36] a massage by the bass drum pedal.
[1:21:39] I'm I'm serious.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; I mean I had to open my windows at crack
[1:21:43] when I first turned it on because the
[1:21:44] air compression in there would like blow
[1:21:46] your eardrums out. Yet I put the prophet
[1:21:49] on that stereo.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a man that can turn on the
[1:21:52] light. That's my first tape. There's a
[1:21:53] man here that can turn on the light.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; I drove around listening to that for
[1:21:56] three days. And I started going, "Wait,
[1:22:00] I haven't smoked.
[1:22:02] When was I having my last cigarette?" I
[1:22:03] was smoking like probably a pack and a
[1:22:04] half to two packs a day.
[1:22:07] I haven't done any drugs.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; I haven't drank any alcohol.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; I go to work and they go, "What happened
[1:22:11] to you?" I go, "What do you mean?" They
[1:22:12] go, "You stopped swearing." Every other
[1:22:14] word was a swear word. I didn't have to
[1:22:17] quit anything. That was a miracle that
[1:22:18] God knew I needed.
[1:22:20] And it was the word coming to me and
[1:22:22] saying, "You're my son.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take you up out of that
[1:22:25] mirror. I'm going to wash and cleanse
[1:22:26] you up and I'm going to fill you with my
[1:22:28] Holy Ghost and give you out there
[1:22:29] because this is me. You were hidden. You
[1:22:32] were you were one of my attributes." So
[1:22:34] this masterpiece,
[1:22:36] he says, "Behold my servant, the
[1:22:38] masterpiece that I have betrayed." So
[1:22:39] now he's talking about a masterpiece
[1:22:40] that God built through all these types
[1:22:42] in the Bible. He was building something
[1:22:44] that he had hidden. This invisible God
[1:22:48] there. So he said he he stands right
[1:22:50] before me a perfect there his own image
[1:22:52] reflecting God. So he created this image
[1:22:54] Jesus Christ and he looked down at it
[1:22:56] and he said it's perfect.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; He he said it's perfect.
[1:23:01] He said he said St. John 14 when you see
[1:23:04] me you see the father and he said in the
[1:23:06] beginning was the word was God and the
[1:23:07] word was God. Here there was that word
[1:23:09] made flesh. This very image of God. Now
[1:23:11] it was reflecting what God had in his
[1:23:14] mind all the time and said this is it.
[1:23:16] That's right.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; He stepped into it.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; He smoteed it.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "Speak." I love that.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; But I'm just going to skip down a little
[1:23:26] bit of this. He said, you know, in in in
[1:23:27] the word reflected in the masterpiece,
[1:23:29] in his own likeness, God back in his own
[1:23:30] likeness. The word form being reflected
[1:23:32] in the image of a man, the masterpiece,
[1:23:34] you know, the builder himself. He
[1:23:36] stepped into this. But I'm going to jump
[1:23:38] down here now and to about let's see
[1:23:41] paragraph
[1:23:43] let's go to paragraph um
[1:23:48] I'm I got some of this kind of skipped
[1:23:50] out on here so I'm just going to have to
[1:23:51] read it. You're gonna have to find it.
[1:23:52] So sorry you guys in tape room in the
[1:23:56] audio visual room. Let's see. He says
[1:23:57] here he says he spoke to the prophets
[1:23:59] that they were a potential image. see
[1:24:00] that he was hiding himself a potential
[1:24:02] image
[1:24:04] as he was bringing up to the head but
[1:24:06] when he came into the head it was all
[1:24:07] the image of God he was portraying
[1:24:08] himself then smitten for us now he's the
[1:24:11] masterpiece to us the gift of God Christ
[1:24:13] eternal I hope we never forget that you
[1:24:15] don't ever forget that he smiled him on
[1:24:17] Calvary for you
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; now listen what he says a bride that he
[1:24:22] might take him a bride so when his
[1:24:24] masterpiece was perfected then he had to
[1:24:26] smite it to take from him another piece
[1:24:28] not another creation but the same
[1:24:30] creation.
[1:24:32] What he was the beginning of the
[1:24:34] creation of God. By thing by him are all
[1:24:36] things created. By by him all things
[1:24:38] consist. But he was just taking another
[1:24:40] piece of himself.
[1:24:44] Now my brother, don't think bad about
[1:24:46] this, but think a minute. If he took
[1:24:47] from him the original creation to make
[1:24:49] the bride for him, he never made another
[1:24:50] creation. He took a part of the original
[1:24:52] creation. Then if he was the word, what
[1:24:54] must the bride be? It's got to be the
[1:24:56] original word. living God in the word.
[1:24:59] Now we see him stricken, smitten of God
[1:25:01] and afflicted the perfect lamb, sinner
[1:25:04] slain, a perfect masterpiece. Now for
[1:25:06] nearly 2,000 years, God has been asking
[1:25:08] him make again making him a masterpiece
[1:25:10] because he struck Adam. See, he struck
[1:25:12] Adam to get Eve out. He struck Jesus to
[1:25:14] get you out.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; And now he's building another
[1:25:17] masterpiece.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Now she's the one that's been smitten
[1:25:20] and rejected
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; just like he was. If they hated him,
[1:25:24] they're going to hate you. They
[1:25:25] persecuted him. They're going to
[1:25:26] persecute you. All that live godly in
[1:25:29] Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
[1:25:30] Right?
[1:25:32] It's just because it's the word in you.
[1:25:33] They're not rejecting you. They're
[1:25:36] rejecting the word.
[1:25:38] They love you,
[1:25:40] right? Oh, come on, man. Be one of us,
[1:25:43] man. Come and party with us. Come hang
[1:25:44] out with us. But that word's not
[1:25:46] welcome. Leave that at the door.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Sorry. I can't go where he can't go.
[1:25:51] That's right.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; I I had friends in the world that
[1:25:54] thought were my friends. They the league
[1:25:56] guitar player, my rock band. Soon as I
[1:25:58] took to this message, they started
[1:26:00] dropping like flies. If I didn't have
[1:26:02] some pot to smoke or something, they Oh,
[1:26:05] we don't have any use for gym anymore.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; I had something the lily of the valley.
[1:26:08] I had something better.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; You want to get high? This is the kind
[1:26:12] of high you don't come down from.
[1:26:15] You You want to have peace? This is a
[1:26:17] piece that doesn't leave.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Another masterpiece he struck at
[1:26:23] Calvary, got him a piece off. So, this
[1:26:25] New Testament has just been God
[1:26:27] revealing now the word in you, the ones
[1:26:32] he was redeeming
[1:26:34] to get back what he what was in him all
[1:26:36] along. This buying back what he already
[1:26:38] he had lost it, he's bringing it back to
[1:26:42] that word where what you always were in
[1:26:43] his mind.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Never did it in the first place.
[1:26:45] justified, spotless, sinless.
[1:26:48] The the sanctuary has been cleansed.
[1:26:50] It's almost done. When he's completely
[1:26:52] cleansed the sanctuary, Brother said
[1:26:53] it's no more a mercy seat. It becomes a
[1:26:56] judgment seat. And if you get into the
[1:26:57] Revelation series, you'll see where
[1:26:58] Brother said he's going to come take his
[1:27:00] own throne. His father's throne was
[1:27:02] spirit God, the invisible in the
[1:27:04] heavens. He said his throne was in
[1:27:06] flesh. He's coming to dwell with his
[1:27:09] people. a thousand-y year millennium
[1:27:11] where it's going to be the bride and the
[1:27:12] groom together ruling and reigning for a
[1:27:14] thousand years
[1:27:16] with him in with him forever. Oh man.
[1:27:20] Hallelujah. I feel drunk right now just
[1:27:21] thinking about it. This is better drunk
[1:27:24] than I ever had. I'm not going to have a
[1:27:26] hangover in the morning.
[1:27:28] Hallelujah. It's the truth. A
[1:27:31] masterpiece for 2,000 years in making
[1:27:33] another m a bride for Christ. Another
[1:27:35] masterpiece. In so doing, he does it by
[1:27:37] his never-changing method. The same way
[1:27:39] he made the masterpiece, his word.
[1:27:40] That's the way he makes his masterpiece.
[1:27:42] So, he's making you by the word because
[1:27:44] you are the word and you have to let
[1:27:45] this word go through you.
[1:27:47] Just yield yourself to the word. Satan
[1:27:49] comes, just go back to the word.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. God gave you his
[1:27:53] word. That's all you need. I love that
[1:27:55] in the church age book where he said,
[1:27:56] "How can I overcome?" He said, "It's not
[1:27:59] so much what, but how." You don't have
[1:28:01] to worry about what the enemy is as long
[1:28:03] as you know how. And it's always the
[1:28:04] word.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; How did Jesus overcome? By the word. He
[1:28:07] comes to you and tries to tell you
[1:28:09] you're no good. Just give him the word.
[1:28:10] God said, "I'm righteous."
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; You know, he became sin for you, your
[1:28:14] unbelief. We read that this morning
[1:28:16] about the unbelief that you could be his
[1:28:18] righteousness.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; I remember going through one of my
[1:28:22] biggest battles in life.
[1:28:24] And I was really, really going through
[1:28:26] it. And the brothers at church knew it.
[1:28:27] And so they were all kind of treating me
[1:28:28] with kid gloves like, "Hey, brother
[1:28:29] Bates, is everything okay?" I told his
[1:28:31] brother, I said, "Let me ask you a
[1:28:33] question." Said, "Can you tell me how
[1:28:34] righteous God is?"
[1:28:36] He's like, I said, that's how righteous
[1:28:38] I am.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; It's not anything I did to deserve it.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; But he said, he said
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; he took my sin and I could be his
[1:28:46] righteousness.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Put that coat on.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Not mine. He gave it to me. He dressed
[1:28:54] me with it. It's not my right. It's his
[1:28:56] righteousness.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:00] That's why there's that's why you can't
[1:29:02] sin because his seed remains in you.
[1:29:05] It's because I can just say, "Look, I no
[1:29:07] I've accepted the word of the Lord.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; I've accepted it." And now I can say,
[1:29:15] "I'm sinless, spotless, brought living
[1:29:17] God." Not because anything I did,
[1:29:18] because I am in him. And in him there is
[1:29:22] no spot or blemish. If you can find
[1:29:24] fault in this message, then you're in
[1:29:26] trouble.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; But there's no fault in this sacrifice.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Not any. It's perfect. Let's stand
[1:29:31] together.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that little song. Um, I've
[1:29:35] accepted the word of the Lord. What is
[1:29:36] that?
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Can't you see why I'm happy?
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can't you see why I'm happy?
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; You guys want to know why Brother Bates
[1:29:45] is happy?
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz somehow by God's grace, God rich in
[1:29:48] mercy.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; God rich in mercy.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "Hey son, I want to give you
[1:29:54] something.
[1:29:56] I've accepted it." He just give it to
[1:29:57] us. A gift. You just got to accept it. I
[1:30:00] like that. You know that picture of
[1:30:02] Jesus knocking at the door? Where's the
[1:30:04] doororknob at? On the inside. The the
[1:30:08] answer to everything is right there.
[1:30:10] He's knocking. You just got to open the
[1:30:11] door and accept it. Let him in. Okay,
