[3:01] Can we all stand? We'll open up a word
[3:03] of prayer for the adult Sunday school.
[3:06] Let's bow our hearts. Heavenly Father,
[3:09] Lord, we're privileged and grateful to
[3:11] be here this morning. Lord, we pray that
[3:14] you would just have your way in every
[3:15] life. everything that would be said and
[3:18] done this day, this place of worship.
[3:21] Father,
[3:22] Lord, we're mindful, Lord, that in the
[3:25] book of Acts, you said there were some
[3:26] more noble than others
[3:29] in that day.
[3:31] Receive the word with all readiness and
[3:34] also searched the scriptures daily to
[3:37] see if those things were. So, let that
[3:39] be our portion, Father. Let that be our
[3:41] attitude and discipline to to do that,
[3:44] Father.
[3:46] Lord, build up a most holy faith,
[3:48] praying in the Holy Ghost, Lord, hearing
[3:51] your word and making it a part of us.
[3:54] Pray for the young children in their
[3:55] class that all would go well for them.
[3:58] You draw them closer also,
[4:00] Lord. And we'll give you all the praise
[4:02] and the glory for it. In the name of
[4:04] Jesus Christ, we ask. Amen.
[4:07] We're going to be continuing with
[4:10] Leodysian church age from the book of
[4:12] Revelation chapter 3.
[4:15] verse 14- 22 and we'll be starting at
[4:17] paragraph 129. It be about 20 minutes.
[4:21] Let's sing. We believe.
[4:30] Holy
[4:31] believe.
[4:32] [Music]
[4:35] All things are possible.
[4:40] Only
[4:42] believe.
[4:45] Only
[4:47] believe.
[4:50] Only
[4:52] believe.
[4:56] All things are possible.
[5:00] [Music]
[5:01] Only
[5:03] believe.
[5:06] You may be seated, brother Brennan.
[5:09] go on back into the in an organization.
[5:12] Don't uh it's the same thing now. That's
[5:15] the same thing taking place in this
[5:17] church is yours. He wants you either hot
[5:19] or cold.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; You don't want no lukewarm. That's why
[5:23] Pentecost has got to a lukewarm
[5:24] condition. Now get on the piano once a
[5:27] while, a few drums and bang around a
[5:29] little bit and get enough music.
[5:30] Somebody get kind, you know, kind of
[5:31] saying praise the Lord. Hallelujah. And
[5:34] the music goes downhill.
[5:40] Oh my. This makes God sick of his
[5:43] stomach.
[5:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[5:48] &gt;&gt; All right.
[5:50] There's not much going on then as a as a
[5:54] red-hot revival going on in them, but
[5:57] they had uh plenty of mechanical
[5:59] machinery in this church. You see,
[6:02] because they was rich and all getting uh
[6:05] together and making big meetings and
[6:06] everything. there's having a good time
[6:08] in this church. That's all true, but
[6:09] it's all mechanical machinery. But no
[6:13] warmth of the Holy Ghost. See, look here
[6:15] at what he said in here. See, I know thy
[6:18] works, thou art neither cold or hot. I
[6:20] would that you were cold or hot. And
[6:22] because you're lukewarm, neither cold or
[6:24] hot, I'll spew thee out of my mouth.
[6:26] See, now he said, I would that you were
[6:29] cold or hot. And because you're not, uh,
[6:30] I just have to get rid of you. That's
[6:32] all. Just sweep you out of my mouth.
[6:34] Now, they had plenty of money. They had
[6:36] great buildings. They had great things
[6:37] going on. But they didn't have no warmth
[6:39] of the Holy Spirit. Oh, they had a m a
[6:42] regime. Oh my. They got a united church
[6:46] together. Boy, they got the biggest
[6:47] buildings they ever had and the things
[6:49] going on, but no Holy Spirit. See,
[6:51] that's what God sent for the church, the
[6:54] Holy Spirit. Now, as we continue on in
[6:56] this 16th verse, they have all kinds of
[6:59] committees. Oh, we got a great regime of
[7:01] that. the old ladies aid society and the
[7:04] the young man's peuckle game and and the
[7:07] bunko game on Friday night and uh the
[7:10] basketball game on Sunday afternoon and
[7:13] oh the baseball game on so and so and oh
[7:16] we just got the the man's chattering
[7:18] society and oh we got all kinds of
[7:21] things I tell you she's loaded down
[7:23] societies and clubs and beatings and
[7:26] whatever but no warmth of the Holy
[7:28] Spirit.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, you got a big regime, but you
[7:31] haven't got nothing there to warm up.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; You're warming up to the world, but not
[7:35] to God.
[7:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; That means you're lukewarm.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; Boy, you got more members than you ever
[7:41] had. Sure, boy. Well, we get a million
[7:43] more in 44, said the Baptist. But, but
[7:46] what have you got? A big machine.
[7:49] &gt;&gt; Right in the same church where that
[7:50] remark made. They had to dismiss 15
[7:53] minutes, give the pastor a chance to go
[7:54] outside and all the deacons and all of
[7:55] them smoke and come back in again. My
[7:57] God,
[7:58] &gt;&gt; there you are.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; The Bible plainly condemns that stuff.
[8:04] If you defile this body, the doctors
[8:06] condemn it and says it's full of cancer.
[8:08] Then they'll get on the radio and say,
[8:10] "A thanking man's filter." As Billy Grim
[8:13] said, he's a fool to think that way and
[8:15] think.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; Thinking man's filter. A thinking man
[8:19] wouldn't smoke it at all.
[8:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. It take a second thought.
[8:23] But he tells the women it makes them
[8:24] real skinny, you know, so they can wear
[8:26] some of these new kind of dresses they
[8:28] got. Boy, that sells it. More women
[8:31] smoke cigarettes than there is men now.
[8:33] And a woman will smoke three to one
[8:34] cigarettes to a man. It's exactly right.
[8:36] Course she wants to get thin. She don't
[8:38] realize that's TB and cancer and stuff
[8:40] making her that way. It's baby form
[8:42] coming into her, eating her up like
[8:44] that, killing her. Not a thing can come
[8:46] out of it but evil. That's right.
[8:49] &gt;&gt; See, but it's a thing in man's filter.
[8:53] Oh my. No, no. Oh, they say, "But we
[8:56] have, Brother Brandham, I defy that. We
[8:59] got great meetings." Look what Billy
[9:01] Grims had across the country. Oh, sure.
[9:03] A big regime. Hard evangelist, paid song
[9:06] leaders.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The hard evangelist. Well, how
[9:10] much will you give me if I come hold
[9:11] that revival?
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:13] &gt;&gt; Well, if you can't produce so many
[9:14] thousand dollars, I won't come at all.
[9:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. And who you going to let
[9:19] lead the singing? Well, you go and hire
[9:20] so and so. He's a great soloist. You
[9:23] hire him to he'll draw half a crowd. He
[9:25] will himself.
[9:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:26] &gt;&gt; Paid soloist, paid evangelist. While it
[9:29] comes to a place that soul saving is a
[9:31] business.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; Soul saving is not a business of the
[9:35] church. It's the power of the Holy Ghost
[9:37] in the church.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; Soul saving. You don't buy it with
[9:41] money.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[9:45] &gt;&gt; No.
[9:47] All of it is is works. Works. Works.
[9:50] paid evangelists, paid song leaders,
[9:52] paid choirs, everything else. God don't
[9:55] want that. It's all works.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; God don't want works. He wants the Holy
[9:59] Spirit working in you. That's right.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; 17th verse says, "Because thou sayest, I
[10:05] am rich, increased in goods, and have
[10:07] need for nothing. And knowest not that
[10:09] thou art wretched." Oh, knowest not that
[10:14] thou art wretched, miserable, poor,
[10:17] blind, and naked. Amen.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; They thought they were rich. This
[10:24] Pentecostal and this last age church,
[10:26] they thought and outwardly they were.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. They are rich. Just think of
[10:33] the church used to be a few years ago
[10:35] stood out on the corner, cast about from
[10:37] place to place, had a hard time. But now
[10:41] they got some of the biggest buildings
[10:42] there is. You see where the assemblies
[10:44] of God out here? It used to have their
[10:46] place in an ordinary wooding building
[10:47] something like this here and now they're
[10:49] putting up a $6 million bill and they
[10:54] say Jesus coming right away.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; Your works prove that you don't believe
[10:59] that.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; Hypocrisy.
[11:04] &gt;&gt; Building million-doll buildings and
[11:06] things like that and saying Jesus is
[11:07] coming right away. The poor missionaries
[11:09] on the field without shoes on their
[11:10] feet.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; Real God-fearing missionaries. Amen.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; No shoes on their feet and live off of
[11:16] two rations of rice a week. Eat two
[11:20] times a week to pack the gospel through
[11:22] jungles and things like that to take it
[11:24] to their brethren. And we building $6
[11:26] million buildings in a church with big
[11:28] stained glass windows and everything
[11:30] else and putting it on that. Or you even
[11:33] got so much money as sometimes they got
[11:34] loan associations right in their
[11:36] churches.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; Doctor in there to examine their
[11:41] evangelists or their missionaries. And
[11:43] somebody wants to go out to the field,
[11:44] they give him a doctor's examination to
[11:46] see if he the psychiatrist to see if
[11:48] he's all if he's mentally got his IQ's
[11:51] right. You see
[11:53] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost examines that.
[11:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:55] &gt;&gt; You don't need a psychiatrist.
[11:57] &gt;&gt; But rich, you have need of nothing. Oh,
[12:00] sure. You got plenty of money outwardly
[12:02] plenty rich. have large buildings,
[12:05] stained glass windows, and eloquent
[12:08] preachers. Oh my,
[12:11] I tell you, they're really eloquent.
[12:14] They stand talk all night and say
[12:16] nothing. See, when they come up, I mean,
[12:18] about things they ought to say. See,
[12:20] stand up and some of this stuff talk
[12:22] about a little so and so and miss so and
[12:25] so and you know how it is. Paid singers.
[12:29] That's right. All right. but
[12:33] come into the pull pit.
[12:36] Eloquent preachers if they aren't
[12:37] dressed in a tuxedo suit with a collar
[12:40] turned around and some kind of a
[12:41] frocktail coat on while their
[12:43] congregation feels real embarrassed.
[12:45] And those singers come out there, them
[12:47] women,
[12:49] short bobbed hair like Jezebel,
[12:52] &gt;&gt; enough paint on their face to paint a
[12:53] bar. Soon as you get that robe off, they
[12:56] wear shorts and man's clothes. And the
[12:58] Bible said if a woman puts on a garment
[13:00] pertains to a man it's abomination in
[13:02] his son.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Walk down the street with her nose up.
[13:06] If it rain you drown him.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; Smart elix arrogant hightempered jazzy
[13:11] bells.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; That's the reason we ain't no revival.
[13:14] It's a big piece of machinery work. Oh
[13:16] might have a voice like an archangel.
[13:18] God will make you answer for that.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; These Elvis Presley's and so forth and
[13:24] Ernie Fords or ever what they call them
[13:26] out. hear these fine voices and use it
[13:28] for the devil. God said, "I'll require
[13:30] that at their hands."
[13:32] &gt;&gt; The reason I respect blind Fanny Crosby,
[13:35] she never sold her gift out to the
[13:37] world. She kept it with God.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; Many of these people are eloquent
[13:41] singers, eloquent man, great man, and so
[13:44] forth. Instead of using her talent for
[13:46] God, the devil's perverted them. They're
[13:47] over there working for him. Amen.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; Personalities, radio, television
[13:51] personalities selling their stuff out
[13:54] out there for the world instead of
[13:55] giving it to God.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; Some of them come to church, go to
[13:59] church, wear a big fine robe, come out
[14:01] there and sing like that, go right back
[14:03] and sing rock and roll the next night.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; Such as singers that we know belong to
[14:09] certain churches. Get out there and make
[14:12] them pictures and movie pictures. Get
[14:14] out there and sing rock and rolls. The
[14:15] kings of rock and roll and claim to be
[14:17] religious. It's a trick of the devil.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; One man had enough enough good common
[14:23] sense up here that said he's going to be
[14:25] a preacher. Get on Sunday morning and
[14:26] preach and he go down there on and get
[14:28] on the radio broadcast and sing rock and
[14:30] roll songs and everything like finally
[14:32] took a pistol his brains out. I respect
[14:34] the man for doing it. That's right.
[14:37] That's right. He had more he had as much
[14:39] sense as them hogs did anyhow. When they
[14:40] got the devil in them, they run down the
[14:41] water and choke. Some people don't even
[14:44] have that much. I know you I hate to be
[14:46] that hard, but brother, sister, you got
[14:48] you got to bow the thing down and make
[14:50] it a fit man. This is the day that we're
[14:53] living.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; I guess that Jesus called Herod an old
[14:57] fox and John called him a generation of
[14:58] vipers.
[15:01] All right.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; They have large buildings, stained glass
[15:04] windows, eloquent preachers, paid
[15:06] singers. Yes, sir. What have they got in
[15:09] it? What's in it? Nothing of the Holy
[15:12] Ghost.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; Stand up there and go out and wear
[15:16] shorts and come in and sing in the
[15:17] choir. You miserable hypocrite.
[15:21] [Music]
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; Right. And you preacher that'll go to a
[15:27] meeting because they give you more money
[15:28] than they do at some other place.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; You're not a fit to be in a pulpit.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Money. If you can't appropriate so many
[15:39] thousand dollars, well, we can't come.
[15:41] our our our managers and things will
[15:43] come around. If you can get up the
[15:44] money, we'll come. If I can't get full
[15:46] cooperation with everybody, I won't
[15:48] come. If everybody don't fully
[15:50] cooperate, all the churches so I have
[15:52] plenty of money to make my debts meet, I
[15:53] won't come, brother. A real man of God,
[15:57] the Holy Ghost, let him
[16:01] eat soda crackers and drink branch.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; He's a real servant of God. But people
[16:06] tie themselves up with broadcast and
[16:08] radio and television, all kinds of
[16:10] things the world. So they got to have
[16:12] that kind of money.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly right. See,
[16:16] &gt;&gt; that ain't God.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; No.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, you're rich have need of
[16:20] nothing." Sure. But the very thing you
[16:22] had need of, you didn't have,
[16:24] &gt;&gt; but you didn't know it. See, rich have
[16:26] need of nothing. Paid to do the things
[16:28] that they're doing. Card playing. Oh,
[16:31] you say we got big congregations. Oh,
[16:34] sure.
[16:35] Yes, sir. Vegas congregation. Well, you
[16:38] know, the mayor of the city comes to our
[16:39] church. That's right. Well, you know, so
[16:42] and so when they come to town, they come
[16:44] to our church. We have all the celebrity
[16:47] in our church. Yes. And let the poor,
[16:50] sainted, needy come into the church and
[16:53] they're rebuked to you.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; You don't even want them there. You're
[16:57] afraid somebody say amen while you're
[16:58] preaching.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. like a little lady I've
[17:02] read one time and a little book up here.
[17:04] She'd come into a church of her
[17:06] children, she'd raised them in an
[17:08] oldfashioned church back in the woods
[17:10] somewhere where they were really godly.
[17:12] So the a young fellow come in one day
[17:14] and married the girl, said he belonged
[17:16] to the outside church, you know, one of
[17:18] the big churches of the same
[17:19] denomination out in the city. So he told
[17:21] the mother he was a Christian, so he
[17:22] married the daughter and take her out.
[17:24] Well, finally he got her weaned off from
[17:26] the little country church back in the
[17:28] mountains to out here in this great big
[17:30] fine church. Same name, but back there
[17:32] they had the Holy Ghost out here. They
[17:34] had nothing. So then when they come in
[17:36] this great big fine church. So mother
[17:38] said one day she was coming down to to
[17:40] see her daughter. Well, they wondered
[17:42] what in the world they do with her. So
[17:44] when she come down, she looked like
[17:45] something out of a relic book. one of
[17:47] them little high neck dresses, you know,
[17:48] and long sleeves and her hair peeled
[17:50] back. Her onion face stick like that
[17:54] peeled back, you know, she come down.
[17:55] She says, "Well, hallelujah, honey. How
[17:57] y'all getting along?" Well, she said,
[18:00] "Now in the morning, Sunday said, y'all
[18:02] going to meeting a
[18:04] husband said, "What will we do with
[18:06] her?" Said, "We can't take her over
[18:08] there like that." And said, "Well, I
[18:10] don't know what to do." Well, I said,
[18:12] "Mother, I tell you, we Oh," she said,
[18:14] "But honey, I could have stayed out of
[18:15] church. Surely there's a certain search
[18:17] certain church down here. Oh, she he
[18:19] said so said I seen over on the corner
[18:20] there. I'll just go over. And he said,
[18:23] "Oh, well, we'll just have to do it." So
[18:25] when they went in, they let her go in
[18:27] first.
[18:29] Shamed of her.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; Here she come across the street, that
[18:32] little skirt, you know, the Bible under
[18:33] her arm. A brother, she might not had
[18:35] her name in who's who,
[18:38] &gt;&gt; but I imagine she had her name on the
[18:39] lamb's book of life.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; That was the name. When she walked in
[18:43] the church, she sat down back there,
[18:45] took her seats on, opened up the Bible,
[18:47] and she be to read, and everybody be to
[18:49] look around. Thought some kind of an
[18:50] antique had dropped out somewhere.
[18:52] Looking over like that, oh my, with all
[18:55] their fine clothes on, you know, the
[18:57] typical lady of seeing and their fine
[19:00] dresses and so forth. Looked back, seen
[19:02] his little mother sitting there, big
[19:03] smile on her face, you know, reading the
[19:04] Bible. Yeah. And the pastor, after a
[19:06] while, after got through all the other
[19:08] things, he finally had about 15 minutes
[19:10] to talk. So he got up and he said, "The
[19:12] Lord is good." She said, "Praise God.
[19:15] That's right. Hallelujah."
[19:17] And everybody stretched their neck like
[19:18] a gander. Look around. Who was it? And
[19:21] after a while, he said,
[19:25] he said, "Christians in every age should
[19:30] be violent, great, fine Christians or
[19:33] something on that order." She said,
[19:34] "Praise God, that's right."
[19:38] And you all looked around.
[19:40] looked over to his deacon board and the
[19:42] deacon board got the audi goes back and
[19:44] takes a little woman with the army and
[19:46] walks her out the door said you're
[19:48] interrupting the pastor
[19:50] [Music]
[19:53] &gt;&gt; you're dead and don't know it
[19:57] &gt;&gt; yes
[19:58] &gt;&gt; oh watch your stained glass windows
[20:00] going to mount to
[20:02] &gt;&gt; watch your fine plush pews and watch all
[20:04] your big congregation going straight to
[20:06] hell as a Martin to its
[20:08] or if you don't have the spirit of God,
[20:10] you're lost.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Unless you're born again, you cannot see
[20:13] the kingdom.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; That's bitter. It's like I used to take
[20:17] castor oil. I said, "Mama, I can't even
[20:19] stand it." She said, "If it don't make
[20:21] you sick, it don't do you no good." So,
[20:23] I guess that's about the way this do.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, if you would speak to them. Oh, uh,
[20:31] big fine buildings and so forth. Oh,
[20:33] they they uh they you go to church. You
[20:36] have to say go to church and say, "Well,
[20:38] I tell you, you are Pentecostal." Oh,
[20:41] yes. Sure. We're Pentecostal. You
[20:43] believe been born again? Yes. Well, I
[20:45] want to show you something. Oh, look at
[20:47] this building. You know how much this
[20:48] building cost? That cost three quarters
[20:50] of a million dollars to put this up. You
[20:52] know, we used to didn't have it that
[20:53] way. We We used to be down there at the
[20:55] alley. Mhm. And they look around, you
[20:58] find out all these great things that
[20:59] they got. Yes, sir. And then they say,
[21:02] "Oh, we we got all these big things."
[21:04] But they have no burden for lost souls.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; They always want to show you how much
[21:10] filling they got. Look at our Sunday
[21:12] school record. How big it is. What good
[21:14] does that do to you? They have not the
[21:15] Holy Ghost.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; Rich increased in goods.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; Have nothing. That's what he said. You
[21:23] think that but don't know that you're
[21:24] poor, wretched, miserable, blind,
[21:27] &gt;&gt; naked, and don't know it. See,
[21:29] &gt;&gt; that's it. Oh, sure. They say, "You know
[21:32] what? We used to be the little church we
[21:34] used to use is in the back part. This is
[21:36] the big one now." And I'll tell you, no
[21:38] burden for souls, but they got to see
[21:40] that all these things are taken care of.
[21:42] The ladies aid and all these other
[21:44] things all has to be taken care of, but
[21:46] no burden for lost souls.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. What this church has got into,
[21:53] they were not burdened for souls, but
[21:56] they were burdened with wealth.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. They had the wrong burden.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; They had a burden for their wealth, but
[22:04] not a burden for lost souls. The
[22:06] scripture said, "You didn't know that
[22:08] they were wretched. Oh, miserable,
[22:12] blind."
[22:14] They think that they could take money
[22:16] and convert the world. Oh, if we could
[22:19] just get a program on that we could get
[22:21] a lot of money here, I believe we could
[22:23] go convert the world. If some of the
[22:25] rich people in our church, brother
[22:26] Brandon, if we could just get them to
[22:27] dig out and I believe that we could
[22:30] start a society that would um that would
[22:32] go around and and convert the world. We
[22:34] could take airplanes and drop literature
[22:36] all over Africa and things like that. If
[22:38] we just had some money, brother, the
[22:40] world, it won't be converted by money.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; The world will be converted by the Holy
[22:45] Ghost.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; Powerful preaching of the Holy Ghost and
[22:49] the cross will be the only thing that'll
[22:50] convert the world.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; God's program is not money. It's the
[22:54] Holy Ghost.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; That's what God's program is for the
[22:57] lady of church age or any other church
[23:00] age. Yes, sir. They want the Holy Ghost.
[23:03] Oh, they say we are have gold. It was
[23:06] gold. All right. But not the right kind.
[23:09] They had plenty of gold but not the
[23:11] right kind. Now, so they were commanded
[23:15] by Jesus, I know you have rich and have
[23:18] gold and have need of nothing, but I
[23:20] counsel thee to come by of me. Gold
[23:24] tried in the fire, a different kind of
[23:27] gold. Yeah. A gold that's tried in the
[23:30] fiery furnace, that went through the
[23:32] fire of death, that went through
[23:34] Calvary, come out. A lot of this gold
[23:37] you got now is tarnish you. It'll caner.
[23:40] It'll rust. If you can mark down this
[23:42] James St. James 5 1-4 and you'll get
[23:46] what it is. Say, "Go ye you rich man now
[23:48] at the coming of the Lord. Weep and howl
[23:50] for your miseries has come up for you on
[23:52] your goals cankered in you." See, that's
[23:54] the kind of gold that caners. But the
[23:56] goal that Jesus gives is the Holy
[23:59] Spirit. The golden oil of the spirit
[24:01] pours into your heart and and oh my
[24:06] house of you come buy me gold if you
[24:08] want get rich. Oh
[24:11] yes. Also, they were blind. Now, that's
[24:15] a bad way to be. I don't think these
[24:18] Christians were so blind as he was
[24:19] nearsighted.
[24:21] Hallelujah. I believe they were
[24:23] nearsighted. The only thing they could
[24:24] look at was their big buildings. Only
[24:26] thing they could look at was their big
[24:27] congregation. Only thing they look at
[24:29] was a well carnished choir with all its
[24:32] big robes and things. I think they were
[24:34] just nearsighted.
[24:36] They couldn't see over their nose
[24:37] hardly. I don't think they were blind.
[24:39] They were just nearsighted. All they
[24:41] could see was their what? You know what?
[24:44] We belong to the so and so. They're big
[24:46] denominations, their big crowds, many
[24:48] members, their Sunday school, their fine
[24:51] buildings.
[24:53] But they had need of the Holy Ghost.
[24:55] Jesus said,
[24:56] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[24:57] &gt;&gt; They needed the Holy Ghost. So the Lord
[25:00] said to them,
[25:02] I if you are eyes are so bad and you're
[25:06] so nearsighted, you can't see nothing
[25:08] but your big building here and your big
[25:10] fine congregation and you're the mayor
[25:12] of the city and all coming to your
[25:13] church, you got the celebrity and you
[25:15] forgot me. But if you are that blind and
[25:18] your eyes is that sort, I'll say some
[25:20] eyes.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; See, it's strange them doctors of
[25:26] divinity didn't have any of that, isn't
[25:28] it? Amen.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; They had a lot of perfume
[25:31] &gt;&gt; and a lot of theology,
[25:32] &gt;&gt; but they needed eyesight.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; All right. God's Holy Spirit
[25:38] &gt;&gt; to massage. Let them look for the coming
[25:40] of the Lord.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; Let them look at the Bible. Let them
[25:43] look at the word.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; They know how to say, "Amen."
[25:47] Just exactly right.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; They had the perfume.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; They had all the ointments,
[25:54] &gt;&gt; but they needed eye savage.
[25:56] said you need a little sab to go on your
[25:58] eyes. It'll open them up.

[40:46] for a safe return.
[40:49] Amen. Want to welcome my mother-in-law.

[41:06] Amen. Thank you for your prayers.
[41:10] Amen. It's not the same, you know, when
[41:11] you're missing church. Just
[41:15] I don't know. I just
[41:17] I was telling the church up there, you
[41:19] feel like backsliding,
[41:21] you know, I just miss you so much and
[41:24] just uh it's just different, you know,
[41:26] to be all together and this with the
[41:28] same expectations, you know.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; We want to receive something from God
[41:33] and from his spirit and from his word.
[41:35] Just like let's just pray all together
[41:37] and just welcome the Holy Spirit this
[41:39] morning. Precious heavenly father, we
[41:42] love you so much, heavenly father.
[41:45] Father, we thank you, Lord, for having
[41:47] us all together, Lord, with the same
[41:49] expectations. Lord, we just want more
[41:52] and more of you, Lord Jesus. Give us
[41:56] everything you have for us this morning,
[41:58] Lord. Bless our brothers and sisters,
[42:01] Lord. Father, it's so good. It feels so
[42:05] good, Lord, to have you in our lives.
[42:07] Father, it is so good, Lord, to feel you
[42:10] in our bodies, Lord, in our spirit,
[42:12] Lord, in our souls. Heavenly Father,
[42:14] bless each and everyone this morning
[42:16] Lord and let us welcome you Lord Jesus.
[42:20] Father help us Lord to receive you Lord
[42:23] Jesus once again. Father bless us in

[43:12] Amen. Just want to sing of course before
[43:14] we're seated. Longing for Jesus.
[43:16] Just thinking of that this week where
[43:19] you know you we have friends, we have
[43:21] family in this life that we get away
[43:24] from him for a while and we just we want
[43:26] to be around him again.
[43:30] Maybe maybe some of us in our marriage,
[43:32] we can look back and say there were
[43:33] times where we just could not wait to
[43:35] see that person. And you know, hopefully
[43:37] it's still that way, but you know, there
[43:40] we certainly can remember when we first
[43:41] fell in love and we just wanted to be
[43:44] with that person and that's just all we
[43:46] cared about is what what can we do? And
[43:48] sometimes it's just you don't need to
[43:50] talk. It's just just being around them,
[43:52] just feeling their presence. And I
[43:54] think, you know, that's the way God
[43:56] wants us to be with him. and and from
[43:59] his vantage point, how often does he
[44:00] look down and see us where that's our
[44:03] desire is just Lord, I have a longing in
[44:05] my heart for you. Just to be near you,
[44:07] just to feel your presence. So, he's
[44:10] here this morning. Let's make him feel
[44:11] welcome with our praise.
[44:13] I'ming
[44:16] [Music]
[44:18] longing for Jesus.
[44:22] [Music]
[44:25] I have a long
[44:29] in my heart
[44:33] for
[44:35] him.
[44:39] Just to be near
[44:43] him,
[44:46] just to feel his presence.
[44:53] I have a long
[44:57] in my heart
[45:01] for
[45:02] him.
[45:08] Yes, I am.
[45:12] I'm longing
[45:14] for you, Jesus.
[45:19] [Music]
[45:21] I have
[45:23] I long
[45:25] in my heart
[45:29] for
[45:30] him.
[45:35] Just to be near him
[45:41] and to feel his presence.
[45:49] I have a glory
[45:53] in my heart.
[45:57] [Music]
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated this morning
[46:07] and I can tell you I just was rejoicing
[46:10] in the back right before I came out.
[46:13] Sister Lorie Snow come in. It was It was
[46:17] so good to see her.
[46:20] What a wonderful treat.

[46:26] He does miracles so great.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; So good to have you here, Lord. And we
[46:35] sure miss you. And we know that he who
[46:38] started the work is going to be faithful
[46:39] to complete it.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And his own good time. He knows
[46:44] what's best for us. He knows why we go
[46:46] through the trials we do. But it's so
[46:48] good to be with you again and just to
[46:50] see your smiling face. Looking forward
[46:53] to some of those cheesecakes again as
[46:55] well.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is so good.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; You ask me why I'm happy. I'll tell you
[47:05] why. It's because my sins are gone.
[47:10] You ask me why I'm happy. Oh well, I'll
[47:14] just tell you why.
[47:17] It's because my sins are gone.
[47:22] And when I meet the starers who tell me
[47:26] where they are,
[47:30] I say my sins are gone.
[47:34] will run to people
[47:37] on the cross of Calvary.
[47:40] Just as far remove as our pieces from
[47:44] God
[47:47] in the sea of God's forgone.
[47:52] [Music]
[47:59] did was at the old time altar where God
[48:04] came in my heart
[48:07] and now my sins are gone.
[48:12] The Lord took full possession.
[48:15] The devil is
[48:19] I am so glad my sins are gone.
[48:25] underneath the blood on the cross of
[48:29] Calvary. Just as far removed as darkness
[48:33] is from dawn
[48:37] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[48:40] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[48:45] My sins are gone. Now when Satan comes
[48:48] to tempt me, when Satan comes to tempt
[48:51] me,
[48:53] tries to make me down.
[48:57] I say my sins are gone.
[49:01] Well, you got me in trouble, but Jesus
[49:06] got me out.
[49:08] I am so glad my s are gone.
[49:14] There
[49:16] are light on the cross of Calvary.

[49:35] My sins are gone.

[59:09] prayer request and for the offering,
[59:10] just want to share a little testimony
[59:13] with you. something that Joy and I were
[59:15] listening to last night. And then we
[59:17] just want to sing a song before before
[59:19] your brother's come. Just wait just a
[59:20] minute. We just want to sing a song
[59:22] before. Sorry I wasn't clear on that.
[59:26] But Joy was playing a little um a little
[59:29] video of a testimony by Corey Tenboom,
[59:32] which I think about all of you have have
[59:34] heard of Corey Tenboom, concentration
[59:37] camps, the story of the hiding place.
[59:40] And um they were interviewing her and
[59:42] she was just saying one of one of the
[59:44] periods that she remembered she was put
[59:46] in solitary confinement for a while. I
[59:49] think it was about three months of
[59:50] solitary confinement and she was just
[59:52] like Lord I just I need somebody
[59:55] and you know just this is this is almost
[59:58] more than I can bear. And
[1:00:02] the next day a little aunt comes walking
[1:00:06] in the in in the cell the room with her
[1:00:08] there. I said, "Well, it's it's some
[1:00:11] company." And she just observed the ant
[1:00:14] a little bit, talked to the ant and and
[1:00:16] and visited with it and and you just
[1:00:19] just talking and and she noticed that
[1:00:22] every time the ant got scared or sensed
[1:00:25] there was trouble or danger, it went
[1:00:27] into a little hole in the wall. I said,
[1:00:30] "Oh,
[1:00:32] you have a little hiding place you go
[1:00:34] to."
[1:00:37] And she she's like, you know,
[1:00:39] I I need a hiding place. And she felt
[1:00:42] God just speak to her and said, I'm your
[1:00:45] hiding place.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; And I just wanted to sing this song.
[1:00:50] Lord, you are my hiding place. The words
[1:00:53] to this are just so beautiful. You
[1:00:55] always fill my heart with songs of
[1:00:58] deliverance. Whenever I am afraid, I
[1:01:01] will trust in you.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:06] Just sing this before the brothers come
[1:01:07] on.

[1:01:12] my hiding
[1:01:14] place.

[1:01:34] I will trust in you.
[1:01:42] I will trust in you.
[1:01:49] Let the weak say.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Through him we can say I am strong.

[1:02:00] of the Lord I will trust in.

[1:11:45] need of in our life. And we don't look
[1:11:48] to a man. We don't look to one another.
[1:11:50] But we look to you.
[1:11:52] We look to the hills from which cometh
[1:11:55] our help. Our help comes from the Lord.
[1:11:58] And Lord, every one hearer needs your

[1:13:03] evening we have a good friend of the
[1:13:05] ministry here. Brother uh Robert
[1:13:07] Figareroa will be speaking for us this
[1:13:10] evening. as brother Bobby's daddy
[1:13:13] there'll be ministering for us and
[1:13:16] brother Robert means so much to me. just
[1:13:20] have a unique friendship and um it's a
[1:13:24] wonder I don't call on him more but it
[1:13:26] seems like the men's prayer breakfastes
[1:13:29] he's always been available for the last
[1:13:31] few years to minister for us for the
[1:13:33] prayer breakfast and we were
[1:13:35] fellowshipping and they don't have an
[1:13:36] evening service so I told him to come on
[1:13:39] over and let us pull on you and squeeze
[1:13:42] it all out of you
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; and so we're going to come expecting and
[1:13:46] I always receive something from brother
[1:13:48] Robert when he ministers. Amen.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; And so we'll be uh ready for that and
[1:13:53] thank the Lord for those that are in
[1:13:55] gathering in Phoenix today. We trust the
[1:13:57] Lord will bless them and um give them
[1:14:00] what they have need of. And we're
[1:14:02] getting a little late start but um
[1:14:07] but it's never too late to get through
[1:14:11] what the Lord has placed upon our
[1:14:12] hearts.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; And so with any service, it's Lord, what
[1:14:15] do you want to do? And sometimes we have
[1:14:18] our schedule, but we want the Lord's
[1:14:20] schedule, don't we?
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; We want what he has for us. Amen. So,
[1:14:25] let's stand to our feet and we'll turn
[1:14:28] into scripture.
[1:14:32] Mark
[1:14:34] chapter 13
[1:14:37] verse number 34.
[1:15:01] We've been waiting for mom to get moved
[1:15:03] down and she's here. So, we're so happy
[1:15:05] to have her. God bless her.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Mark 13:34.
[1:15:12] For the Son of Man is as a man taking a
[1:15:17] far journey, who left his house, and
[1:15:20] gave authority to his servants, and to
[1:15:23] every man his work, and commanded the
[1:15:26] porter to watch.
[1:15:29] Watch ye therefore, for ye know not when
[1:15:32] the master of the house cometh, at
[1:15:35] evening, or at midnight, or at the
[1:15:40] crowing, or in the morning,
[1:15:44] lest coming suddenly he find you
[1:15:47] sleeping. And what I say unto you, I say
[1:15:50] unto all. Watch.
[1:15:54] Amen. Let's take one more scripture in
[1:16:00] Romans.
[1:16:01] Let's take Galatians chapter 4 and then
[1:16:03] I'll have you seated.
[1:16:06] Galatians chapter 4
[1:16:09] verse
[1:16:10] number 1 and two.
[1:16:14] Now I say that the heir
[1:16:18] as long as he is a child differereth
[1:16:20] nothing from a servant, though he be
[1:16:22] lord of all. but is under tutorers and
[1:16:26] governors until the time appointed of
[1:16:30] the father.
[1:16:31] Let us let us let us pray. Lord Jesus,
[1:16:36] we ask your blessing on this portion of
[1:16:37] the word that we read tonight uh this
[1:16:40] morning rather and we ask that you would
[1:16:43] bless it to our heart, our hearing, to
[1:16:46] our understanding, open it up. Lord,
[1:16:49] there's no way that we can learn
[1:16:51] anything if you don't give it to us.
[1:16:54] And Lord, may we not be distracted by
[1:16:57] anything other than you. May you possess
[1:17:01] and attain our full attention for these
[1:17:04] few moments, Lord. And may the Holy
[1:17:07] Spirit write down the notes in our
[1:17:09] spirit that we need to leave the service
[1:17:12] with, Lord, that we can meditate on it
[1:17:16] and really embrace what the spirit is
[1:17:19] trying to say to the church. Bless the
[1:17:22] little ones, even the youngest one among
[1:17:24] us. Bless the oldest one, even the
[1:17:27] elder, the oldest one among us, Lord.
[1:17:30] And every heart, may they receive their
[1:17:32] portion from you is our prayer. In Jesus
[1:17:35] name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[1:17:39] May be seated. We've been talking on the
[1:17:41] orders of adoption or the orders of
[1:17:46] being placed. really we all have
[1:17:50] received some orders for placement to
[1:17:53] find our place and um in this portion we
[1:17:59] are going to talk a little bit more
[1:18:00] about the authority that's been given to
[1:18:04] the servants for the son of man is as a
[1:18:07] man taken a far journey who left his
[1:18:10] house and gave authority to his
[1:18:12] servants. Good to see you Doug. Happy to
[1:18:15] see you again. He was missing for a few
[1:18:17] months and he called me
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; three months
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; for three months. He was missing and he
[1:18:23] was trying to he was in a little trouble
[1:18:25] and he was trying to remember my number.
[1:18:27] He had most of it but one or two digits.
[1:18:30] And then he finally uh got out of that
[1:18:33] situation and he called me and he said
[1:18:35] he's going to be in church. And then he
[1:18:38] uh his family came together to help him
[1:18:41] move from where he was. He said he
[1:18:43] started to think uh what the Lord has
[1:18:46] done for him and he prayed and he asked
[1:18:49] the Lord to um deliver him from the
[1:18:52] negative influences in his life.
[1:18:55] And so we join with you, Doug, that the
[1:18:58] Lord will raise you up out of that.
[1:19:00] Amen. So this authority given to
[1:19:04] servants, this is a man taken a four for
[1:19:07] our journey. And um this authority, how
[1:19:12] does it work? You know, I when you go
[1:19:14] into the courthouse and you walk into
[1:19:18] that building where lawyers and victims
[1:19:23] and criminals and um there's attorneys
[1:19:28] that are there, it it just the whole
[1:19:31] atmosphere
[1:19:33] is you know that somebody's in control.
[1:19:36] You can't just run up to the front in a
[1:19:38] courthouse. I'm talking about you can't
[1:19:40] just stand up and start talking when you
[1:19:42] feel like talking. There's an order to
[1:19:45] it
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; because somebody there has the authority
[1:19:48] to keep that little jurisdiction
[1:19:52] moving a certain way. Now that same
[1:19:54] judge, he would be the supreme authority
[1:19:57] of his court and everybody respects him.
[1:20:01] He can't be addressed by his first name
[1:20:04] or hey man or hey what's up and you're
[1:20:07] talking all that language. You might
[1:20:09] that's might be how you talk in the
[1:20:10] streets but when you come to court your
[1:20:12] attorney will tell you you can't come in
[1:20:14] here talking like that.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's an authority that
[1:20:19] that courthouse possesses and that judge
[1:20:22] is the one that's ruling that little
[1:20:25] space for that little time. Now, you
[1:20:27] might see that judge in the Walmart or
[1:20:30] getting gas or wherever you might see
[1:20:32] him in public. He doesn't possess that
[1:20:34] same authority. But in his courtroom and
[1:20:38] you come into those doors there, it that
[1:20:41] authority has been given to him to use
[1:20:44] it and exercise it properly. You know,
[1:20:47] as I was thinking on this, going deeper
[1:20:50] in my mind and my thoughts and just
[1:20:52] thinking what the message is trying to
[1:20:54] bring us to and um one of the friends of
[1:20:59] mine, he um he um that I went to high
[1:21:04] school with, he's a twin. Him and his
[1:21:05] sister were the same age and she just
[1:21:10] recently died. And so a group of my
[1:21:12] other friends went to this funeral and
[1:21:15] um they told me Israel at the funeral,
[1:21:19] it was so embarrassing how he said the
[1:21:23] minister got up and spoke and he did a
[1:21:25] good job and he spoke on some things
[1:21:27] that were very good, but then they gave
[1:21:29] that few moments for 10 people to speak
[1:21:32] and then like 15 people got up and as
[1:21:35] the people got up and the different ones
[1:21:37] come up behind the pull pit and start
[1:21:39] sharing stories and cursing and swearing
[1:21:43] and just the disrespect that they
[1:21:46] weren't taught. And so these two friends
[1:21:49] of mine were grieved by that. And so we
[1:21:51] were talking about how, you know, it it
[1:21:54] was it was the it was the responsibility
[1:21:57] of the elder, deacon, whoever
[1:22:00] that was running that to stop that first
[1:22:04] that first action of cursing and bad
[1:22:07] language just to stop the service and
[1:22:10] put it in check. That that would be his
[1:22:13] job to do that. It might be
[1:22:15] uncomfortable. It might be embarrassing.
[1:22:17] We might even know who he is talking
[1:22:19] about, but it was necessary be just like
[1:22:22] a police officer. You're sitting in the
[1:22:24] doughnut place eating with him and
[1:22:26] chopping up. Okay, not donuts because we
[1:22:29] always tease police with donuts, but
[1:22:31] we're at the McDonald's eating and we're
[1:22:33] just chopping it up and he's a police
[1:22:35] and I'm there and I break out and start
[1:22:37] breaking the law. You know what he's
[1:22:39] going to have to do?
[1:22:42] He's going to have to stop eating and
[1:22:44] arrest me. Right.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; If he's really if he's really a real
[1:22:49] police officer
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; now, if he's if he's if he's the fly by
[1:22:52] night, if he's not a real police
[1:22:54] officer, he'll just let it go, turn his
[1:22:56] eye. But a real police officer will
[1:22:58] break up the uncomfortable of the nice
[1:23:00] smooth and stop it. Hey, look, man. I
[1:23:02] got put your hands behind your back.
[1:23:05] You got to go with me today.
[1:23:08] And this is how authority works. The
[1:23:11] authority has been given.
[1:23:14] And the prophet of God tells us that the
[1:23:17] Jews were taught that laying on of hands
[1:23:22] was the way to get their requests
[1:23:25] answered from the Lord. But the Gentile
[1:23:28] was taught authority.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Who was a gentile? He was a Roman. Who
[1:23:33] was this centurion? He's a man over a
[1:23:37] hundred other men. And this is uh what
[1:23:42] brother Brandham says in the message.
[1:23:44] I'm going to go back and read
[1:23:47] a couple places from last week. And he
[1:23:50] says this here.
[1:23:52] Of course, he talks about how the church
[1:23:56] doesn't know their authority, but he
[1:23:59] says he's trying to get the people
[1:24:02] to believe
[1:24:05] in the gentile way.
[1:24:07] If I can get it for you a higher level.
[1:24:10] This is in the message what visions are
[1:24:13] 1956
[1:24:15] paragraph number 10. He says now in
[1:24:17] these handkerchiefs being I have more
[1:24:19] success with the handkerchiefs I guess
[1:24:23] than anything else especially with
[1:24:27] American people. American people got an
[1:24:31] idea in their head that somebody has to
[1:24:34] touch them or do something to them or
[1:24:37] lay hands on them. Where they ever got
[1:24:39] that? Just a Jewish tradition. And I'm
[1:24:43] trying to get you to believe the gentile
[1:24:47] way of it. See, the Jews says, "Now come
[1:24:51] here, lay your hands on my little girl.
[1:24:53] She'll live." Jarius, that was a Jew.
[1:24:56] But the Romans said, "I'm not worthy
[1:24:58] that you'd even come under my house,
[1:25:00] come under my roof." Said, "I'm a man
[1:25:03] under authority, and I say to this man,
[1:25:05] go." He goeth. Everything under me has
[1:25:09] to mind me. And he recognized the
[1:25:12] supreme authority that Jesus had over
[1:25:16] diseases.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; You just speak the word and my servant
[1:25:20] will live. Now there you are. Now Jesus
[1:25:23] never said too much about Jarias only he
[1:25:26] got what he asked for. He went and laid
[1:25:28] hands on the daughter. But he said to
[1:25:30] these people there that followed he said
[1:25:32] now that's great faith. I haven't found
[1:25:36] faith like that in Israel. See now we
[1:25:39] want the greater faith. We want to run a
[1:25:44] higher level. The Lord Jesus wants us to
[1:25:49] believe him. Amen.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; So here the prophet is trying to get us
[1:25:54] to believe the gentile way. Remember in
[1:25:59] his ministry of the first, second, and
[1:26:01] third pull. His first pull was the sign
[1:26:05] in the hand. The second pull was the
[1:26:09] knowing of the intents of the heart
[1:26:12] through discernment. And his third pull
[1:26:14] was the speaking of the word.
[1:26:18] And you know, there's a time where
[1:26:20] brother Bannam is being taught what
[1:26:22] these three pools are. He's being shown
[1:26:27] who and how they work, how they operate.
[1:26:30] And in the message, the adoption, as
[1:26:32] we've been through, that four-part
[1:26:35] sermon and series that he brings in
[1:26:37] there is in 1960. It's clear that he
[1:26:41] still was tutoring, being tutored, being
[1:26:45] taught what this great power is. And you
[1:26:49] know, there is something about a
[1:26:51] soldier. And there's something about a
[1:26:55] uh a person of authority when you come
[1:26:58] in their presence. It's not just the
[1:27:00] uniform that they're wearing. It's not
[1:27:03] that just the title that they have. If
[1:27:06] they properly have achieved that title
[1:27:09] and they properly have attained that
[1:27:12] position, what is it that that really
[1:27:15] garers the respect? Well, to me as I was
[1:27:18] thinking about that, what really gives
[1:27:21] you know where I respect them is their
[1:27:25] experience
[1:27:27] and not only their experience, their
[1:27:29] training.
[1:27:31] You've got to respect the training
[1:27:35] because you can take the same human
[1:27:37] being, same size and stature, same uh
[1:27:41] mental qualification, same got the same
[1:27:43] kind of muscles, same kind of everything
[1:27:46] except one is trained and the other one
[1:27:50] is not.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; And the scriptures are to train us to be
[1:27:56] soldiers. That's what the teaching is.
[1:27:59] And we have to learn how to accept the
[1:28:03] higher level, the gentile level of
[1:28:06] believing. It's not something that comes
[1:28:08] overnight.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; It's not something you can just think
[1:28:11] and desire that you want it. There's a
[1:28:14] time element there of the training that
[1:28:16] has to happen. And we see this in
[1:28:18] brother Banner's first pull, his second
[1:28:20] pull, and his third pull. That's that's
[1:28:24] amazing. I looking at this um football
[1:28:28] great quarterbacks that we know, Tom
[1:28:30] Brady and this other one Patrick
[1:28:32] Mahomes, they won their first Super Bowl
[1:28:35] after 10 or 11 years or more of playing
[1:28:39] the game of football. So from little
[1:28:42] ones coming up, then they go through
[1:28:43] high school, then they go into college,
[1:28:46] a lot of people want to be quarterback.
[1:28:48] It's a lot of people that want to win
[1:28:50] the Super Bowl, but there's a process
[1:28:52] that goes with it. And here they are
[1:28:55] these years and years label later and
[1:28:58] then the competition changes every
[1:29:00] round. You get higher
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; and where locally you might have been a
[1:29:05] star in your town. Well now you got to
[1:29:08] go against people from multiple towns
[1:29:11] and not only multiple towns from people
[1:29:13] from around the world. These are the
[1:29:16] talents that are the best in the world.
[1:29:21] This is what we would call elite talent.
[1:29:24] And you can't uh uh uh uh you can't
[1:29:27] achieve the goal of being elite and you
[1:29:31] didn't practice. You didn't go through
[1:29:33] nothing. You never the game was never on
[1:29:35] the line. You know, out here in your
[1:29:38] backyard, of course, you can hit that
[1:29:40] three-pointer shot. There's nobody in
[1:29:42] your face. The game is not on the line.
[1:29:45] Of course, you can hit a free throw out
[1:29:48] here in the local YMCA,
[1:29:51] but let the game be on the line. Let it
[1:29:53] be the last game in the season. Let the
[1:29:56] fans and the atmosphere and the
[1:29:58] environment and your coaches and your
[1:30:00] team counting on you to knock that shot
[1:30:03] down. It's a lot of pressure now.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; You maybe hit that shot many times in
[1:30:09] your life, but now you're under
[1:30:10] pressure. And this is what moves just a
[1:30:14] regular player over into the elite
[1:30:17] status. You know, these NASCAR drivers,
[1:30:20] they're really athletes, too. A NASCAR
[1:30:23] driver are no joke.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; They can make a turn at 200 miles an
[1:30:28] hour. How many of you have ever driven
[1:30:32] 150 miles an hour? Anybody ever been in
[1:30:35] a race car before? Yeah. It's probably
[1:30:37] nice. It's probably something that is
[1:30:40] either you're like, "Woo, don't ever do
[1:30:42] that again." Or like, "Oo, let's do that
[1:30:44] again." That's that's one of those
[1:30:48] things that I mean, you can't practice
[1:30:50] that out nowhere on Speedway or Grant or
[1:30:53] going to You can't practice that. You
[1:30:56] got to be in a specialized environment
[1:30:59] to learn how to even go at 150. But not
[1:31:02] just 150. Get to 200. Get to 350. get to
[1:31:06] 200 miles an hour and then make a turn.
[1:31:12] Ain't nobody in this room can do that.
[1:31:14] Although there's human beings that can
[1:31:16] do it. And the human beings that can do
[1:31:19] it, brother Bobby, they have been
[1:31:21] trained to do it. They have been under
[1:31:24] rigorous training, specialized training,
[1:31:29] moments, hours, days of trying to get
[1:31:33] this down because
[1:31:36] that power
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; is part of it. How fast it can go and
[1:31:43] the the horsepower it develops and it's,
[1:31:46] you know, it can do all of this. But
[1:31:48] now, do you have the character and the
[1:31:51] experience to handle that kind of power?
[1:31:54] And that's what it comes to. This this
[1:31:56] Bible is powerful.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't nothing more powerful than this.
[1:32:01] But do you have the character to hold it
[1:32:04] and to make it work in your life?
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; It ain't going to happen overnight.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; It ain't going to happen without a
[1:32:11] prayer life.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; It sure ain't going to happen if you
[1:32:14] can't make it into his presence. You got
[1:32:18] to be in his presence
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; and let him develop the skills of a
[1:32:24] welltrained
[1:32:26] soldier. I'm talking about an elite
[1:32:29] class of a soldier. I'm not talking
[1:32:32] about any kind of a of a believer. I'm
[1:32:36] talking about a believer
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; that has enough faith for his body to be
[1:32:42] changed
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; and to go in the rapture.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Somebody,
[1:32:54] how many's going in the rapture?
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Is that everybody? Is everybody going in
[1:33:01] the rapture? Everybody in Tucson?
[1:33:04] Everybody that wants to go, are they
[1:33:05] going in the rapture? Is that an elite
[1:33:06] group?
[1:33:08] That's a special forces.
[1:33:11] You know, I'm told of the um this
[1:33:14] specialized military group, the um
[1:33:20] the Navy Seals is a rigorous training.
[1:33:24] And I'm told that many of those
[1:33:27] specialized forces,
[1:33:29] they that there's like a 70 to 80%
[1:33:32] dropout.
[1:33:35] It's a lot of people start,
[1:33:37] but it requires
[1:33:40] more than just a desire.
[1:33:44] It require I mean I would love to wear
[1:33:46] that badge,
[1:33:48] but it would be like a front
[1:33:51] if I wore the badge, but I really didn't
[1:33:54] go through the training. Who wants that?
[1:33:56] That's a stolen valor. Who who who wants
[1:33:59] the stolen valor? Who who wants to say
[1:34:02] they're part of the bride, but they
[1:34:04] really don't have the ingredients to
[1:34:05] even be they can't even make it. You
[1:34:08] know, we talking about a third pull
[1:34:10] speak the word and we don't even have a
[1:34:12] first pull prayer life.
[1:34:15] And we want a third pull power and we
[1:34:18] don't even have a prayer life that will
[1:34:20] match the first pool.
[1:34:26] And so
[1:34:28] any soldier that makes it through that
[1:34:30] training, they went through it. They
[1:34:32] passed the test. And if there is a
[1:34:34] member of the bride of Christ that's
[1:34:36] going to make it in the rapture, you
[1:34:39] have got to be tested.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; You've got to go through the training.
[1:34:46] It's rigorous.
[1:34:48] It's specialized.
[1:34:50] And it's beautiful, isn't it?
[1:34:53] Now, I'm just going to take a few
[1:34:56] moments and I got a portion that I would
[1:34:58] like to play for you, but I I have to
[1:35:01] get through this part here. All right.
[1:35:03] This higher level that the prophet is
[1:35:05] talking about, it's it's so beautiful
[1:35:08] how he brings it in his own ministry and
[1:35:12] his own life.
[1:35:14] I like how he brings this in the message
[1:35:18] 1950 diseases and afflictions.
[1:35:22] Paragraph number 82.
[1:35:26] Remember he has a calling in his life.
[1:35:29] And remember with his calling came with
[1:35:32] the first, second, and third pull. I
[1:35:35] want to just say a little bit more about
[1:35:37] that. And I hope it will help you to
[1:35:40] embrace it a little bit more when we
[1:35:42] talk about the first, second, and third
[1:35:43] pull because brother Badam says that the
[1:35:46] third pull was a vindication of his
[1:35:50] ministry. I want you to think of that
[1:35:53] that that pillar of fire over his head
[1:35:57] was a vindication. Yes, it was a
[1:35:59] vindication that he was a man sent by
[1:36:01] God. This Malachi 4 being fulfilled,
[1:36:05] that picture right there. and it gives
[1:36:06] signs and wonders. But then he comes to
[1:36:09] the end towards the end of his ministry
[1:36:11] at the third point and he says this is a
[1:36:15] vindication
[1:36:17] like it's a complete vindication
[1:36:20] of my ministry
[1:36:23] after being tested in 1950. This is what
[1:36:26] he says here. That's what he said. If
[1:36:30] you get the people to believe you then
[1:36:32] be sincere when you pray. No demon can
[1:36:36] hold over there. Then he has to know the
[1:36:40] master. Then I know he told me that. And
[1:36:44] when I can get the patient up to the
[1:36:47] place till their faith comes to this,
[1:36:52] that's what gives me a perfect faith.
[1:36:55] I've never seen it fail. And it never
[1:36:58] will fail. It can't fail. Praise the
[1:37:01] Lord. So here, brother Random is telling
[1:37:03] us that that great commission that was
[1:37:06] given to him, if you can get the people
[1:37:08] to believe you, how many remember that
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; nothing will stand before your prayer,
[1:37:13] not even cancer. If you can get the
[1:37:16] people to believe you, then nothing will
[1:37:19] stand before your prayer. So, it's your
[1:37:22] job, Reverend Brham, to get the people
[1:37:25] that's listening to you to believe
[1:37:30] what you're saying is the truth. You
[1:37:33] have to have the gift of becoming
[1:37:36] believable.
[1:37:39] Make me believe that what you're saying
[1:37:41] is true.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; What? What is you saying? An angel came
[1:37:46] to me. Is that what you're saying? Yes.
[1:37:49] my peculiar birth. It's always been with
[1:37:51] me.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. He called me and told me not to
[1:37:55] drink, not to smoke. Yes. And then this
[1:37:59] happened when I was a teenager.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. And this happened when I was
[1:38:03] converted.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. And then I went to the cave and he
[1:38:09] met me there and he told me if I can get
[1:38:13] you to believe what I'm saying nothing
[1:38:17] will stand before my prayer. Now brother
[1:38:20] says now when he sees the people get to
[1:38:23] this place here what place is that where
[1:38:26] they believe him
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; then he says now I have perfect faith.
[1:38:34] It's beautiful.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. It's a lovely layer.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's lovely how it's laid out. Can
[1:38:44] I get a witness?
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; So, his job first phase to get the
[1:38:50] people to believe you. And then when you
[1:38:52] see that the people are believing you or
[1:38:54] they believe in me now, I got perfect
[1:38:56] faith. I don't care what it is, it's
[1:39:00] going to happen because he had perfect
[1:39:01] faith. Beautiful. So he's trying to get
[1:39:04] the people to a place to believe. Now
[1:39:08] what believe is that?
[1:39:11] In the big grand scheme of things, you'd
[1:39:14] have to say that he's trying to get the
[1:39:16] people to believe
[1:39:19] the highest level there is to believe.
[1:39:24] Huh? And that highest level to believe
[1:39:28] is not the Jewish way. The highest level
[1:39:33] is to speak the word.
[1:39:36] Now, brother Bam had this vindication in
[1:39:39] his life. Five definite vindications of
[1:39:43] the third pool.
[1:39:46] Now, this um as I've said before
[1:39:51] that I believe that brother Brandham was
[1:39:53] a fully adopted son of God.
[1:39:57] an example for us to look at as what an
[1:40:01] adopted son looks like. What does a man
[1:40:05] look like that's been fully adopted?
[1:40:07] Now, here brother Brandham takes the
[1:40:09] message in um um it is the rising of the
[1:40:13] sun and he says this here paragraph 91.
[1:40:18] He was waved on the at the day of
[1:40:20] Pentecost when there came a sound from
[1:40:22] heaven like a waving mighty rushing wind
[1:40:24] and was waved over the people the
[1:40:27] Pentecostal people that was up at
[1:40:29] Pentecost waiting for the blessing to
[1:40:32] come and to be waved again.
[1:40:36] We realize in the last day according to
[1:40:39] Luke 17:30 in the Sunday again in the
[1:40:43] day that the sen of man will be revealed
[1:40:47] or waved again over the people. Now who
[1:40:50] is the son of man? In the beginning was
[1:40:53] the word. The word was with God and the
[1:40:56] word was God and the word was made flesh
[1:40:58] and dwelt among us. And if all the
[1:41:01] teaching that we have and confirmation
[1:41:04] of the word of God by word of God by
[1:41:07] signs by wonders we see today that in
[1:41:10] the book of Luke here that we just
[1:41:12] quoted Luke the 17th chapter 30th verse
[1:41:16] Malachi 4 and the different scriptures
[1:41:18] that we're acquainted with that the word
[1:41:21] again is waved over the people.
[1:41:25] Paragraph 94. As Christ was the first
[1:41:27] one to raise from all the prophets and
[1:41:30] so forth, although typed in many places,
[1:41:33] he was the first fruits of those that
[1:41:35] slept. In the bride coming of Christ,
[1:41:39] coming out of the church, there will
[1:41:41] have to be a sheath waved again in the
[1:41:45] last days. Waving of the sheath. What
[1:41:50] was the sheath? The first one that come
[1:41:54] to mature.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; The first one that proved it was a
[1:42:00] wheat, that proved it was a sheath.
[1:42:04] Hallelujah. I'm sure you see what I'm
[1:42:06] talking about.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Do you see what he's talking about?
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; What's he talking about? Jesus with
[1:42:12] sandals on on the seas of Galilee or is
[1:42:16] he talking about the word being made
[1:42:18] flesh in your generation again? is the
[1:42:21] first one that come to maturity. It's
[1:42:24] amazing how people have a problem with
[1:42:26] talking about that one that came to
[1:42:28] maturity and yet we're trying to preach
[1:42:30] to people that we should come to
[1:42:31] maturity. When our first brother, the
[1:42:34] one that's an example of maturity, come
[1:42:37] up through the stages and now he's the
[1:42:40] first one to come to maturity and it is
[1:42:44] waved over the people.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; They don't want to wave it over the
[1:42:48] people now. That's on them. But I want
[1:42:52] it to wave over my life.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, wave the sheath over me.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Every time I'm in my truck playing it
[1:43:00] every time I'm at home hearing it. Every
[1:43:03] time I'm in service, wave the sheath
[1:43:06] over me because this is what a son looks
[1:43:10] like.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; This is what a real son that's come to
[1:43:14] maturity look like. the gentile age, the
[1:43:17] the the whole church denominational
[1:43:20] system. Never seen a man like this.
[1:43:24] Never seen a maturity come up like this.
[1:43:29] Very, very rare. Hadn't seen it before.
[1:43:33] And so, uh, they couldn't deal with
[1:43:35] them. What they're going to do with a
[1:43:37] group of us coming to that maturity.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Amen.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; So it was the first one that come to the
[1:43:47] maturity. Now look at what brother
[1:43:48] Brandham says here in 1963.
[1:43:52] He's talking about this third pool. It's
[1:43:55] November. It's towards the end of the
[1:43:56] year. And look at what he says. Just one
[1:43:58] brief statement about it. And he says
[1:44:00] this. And Lord, we don't know what this
[1:44:02] third pool as we have referred to it
[1:44:06] will be. I don't know what. But we know
[1:44:09] one thing that the first pool was
[1:44:12] perfection. The second pool being the
[1:44:16] five was grace.
[1:44:19] So the prophet is making this statement
[1:44:21] here. Now
[1:44:27] he goes into the message
[1:44:30] blasphemous names
[1:44:33] and and here's what he says here in
[1:44:35] blasphemous names.
[1:44:38] Remember blasphemous names is the
[1:44:40] message right after the stature of the
[1:44:43] perfect man. These two messages are put
[1:44:46] together at the same time. Is that
[1:44:49] right? He bringing the understanding of
[1:44:53] what Peter's virtues were in the
[1:44:56] pyramid.
[1:44:58] So I had a picture of that that pyramid
[1:45:01] quickly. I think I have one in my Bible
[1:45:04] here
[1:45:05] where the prophet is talking about add
[1:45:07] to your faith virtue, knowledge,
[1:45:09] temperance, and all those fine things.
[1:45:13] Right?
[1:45:14] Oh my, I won't take time to do it.
[1:45:23] Somebody got it for me. Thank you.
[1:45:25] Statue of a perfect man. So now he's
[1:45:27] preaching this message. It's like he
[1:45:30] preached the adoption message in 1960.
[1:45:33] Here it is a few years later and he
[1:45:36] preaches um the stature of a perfect
[1:45:39] man. He takes the scripture in second
[1:45:41] Peter chapter 1. Add to your faith
[1:45:43] virtue, knowledge, temp, and all those
[1:45:45] things. Then he comes back a day or so
[1:45:47] later and preaches a message blasphemous
[1:45:51] names.
[1:45:52] And he goes forward and this is what he
[1:45:55] says in that message blasphemous names
[1:45:58] paragraph
[1:46:00] 166.
[1:46:02] He's bringing in the adoption or the
[1:46:05] placing of a son. I still have a little
[1:46:07] more time. Now, in the Old Testament,
[1:46:10] when the son was adopted or placed into
[1:46:13] the family, his name was just as good as
[1:46:16] a check as his daddy's was. Yes, sir.
[1:46:20] They didn't have a they they had a ring
[1:46:22] them days, a sign, a signate, and um
[1:46:27] Brother Bam makes a spitting sound. He
[1:46:29] spit on it, place it. There was a signet
[1:46:33] that just wore his daddy's ring, his
[1:46:36] signant. And that was just as good as
[1:46:38] his daddy's. Now when Jesus had been
[1:46:41] obedient Jesus to God, God placed him
[1:46:44] positionally that this is him. Now when
[1:46:48] the member is born by the Holy Ghost
[1:46:50] into the family of God and has proven to
[1:46:53] have these virtues in him that God can
[1:46:56] see virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[1:46:59] patience, brotherly kindness and
[1:47:01] godliness in him, then God seals him or
[1:47:06] places him. And there you see the sons
[1:47:11] and daughters of God. He's talking about
[1:47:13] the manifestation of the sons and
[1:47:17] daughters of God.
[1:47:19] Paragraph 175, he says this in that same
[1:47:22] message, blasphemous names. He says,
[1:47:24] "But when these things are operating in
[1:47:27] you by God, then you're sealed. Then
[1:47:30] there's no put on about it." So what is
[1:47:33] it? We want those things not just around
[1:47:37] us, not just we heard about it, not here
[1:47:40] and there, but we want them actually
[1:47:42] operating in us.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; And when we see those things operating
[1:47:46] in us, the the prophet tells us, watch
[1:47:50] him for a little while,
[1:47:52] sit back and see how he's about the
[1:47:55] father's business.
[1:47:58] And um when those things are operating
[1:48:01] in you and that's a a a pivotal point
[1:48:04] there. Now you can move from being a
[1:48:07] rookie up to the next level of a
[1:48:11] soldier. Before you had the uniform, but
[1:48:15] we didn't give you no gun.
[1:48:18] We got to make sure you can you got you
[1:48:20] can handle different situations. Can you
[1:48:22] talk your way out of a conflict? You
[1:48:25] know, I think some people get a gun too
[1:48:27] quick because if you don't have no gun,
[1:48:30] you learn the beautiful art of
[1:48:31] negotiating with folks.
[1:48:34] Yeah, you'll figure it out. You better
[1:48:36] figure it out cuz you ain't got no gun.
[1:48:38] But when you got a gun and you haven't
[1:48:40] been matured, the first thing you do,
[1:48:42] somebody look at you wrong, you put your
[1:48:43] hand on your gun. Like, man, are we
[1:48:45] there?
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Was this a moment to pull out a gun on
[1:48:48] somebody?
[1:48:50] We just got a, you know, a bad spot in
[1:48:53] traffic and you want to pull a gun out
[1:48:55] on somebody.
[1:48:58] This is why you need to go around with
[1:49:00] your little uniform. Then maybe we'll
[1:49:01] give you a badge and then maybe you go
[1:49:03] through some testing. We might give you
[1:49:05] a gun with no bullets
[1:49:10] and then move right on up into the
[1:49:13] ranks. And this is how any business
[1:49:15] works. This is how it works in the
[1:49:17] military. This is how it works. And
[1:49:20] anything that you call elite, you know,
[1:49:22] one of the things they they they talk
[1:49:24] about in the the special forces, they're
[1:49:27] they're they go into this special
[1:49:30] operations and they're they're they're
[1:49:33] really made for really unique conflict.
[1:49:39] Now, they're all soldiers. Yes, you join
[1:49:41] the army, you join the military, you
[1:49:42] join the navy, but then in the navy you
[1:49:45] have these special forces that are
[1:49:48] developed that come out of the group of
[1:49:51] just general populated uh soldiers and
[1:49:55] there's testing that has to be done and
[1:49:58] there's tears to it and there's training
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; and so just you know having the
[1:50:04] authority is is is it comes because of
[1:50:07] the training and the experience. You're
[1:50:09] highly trained and then you're
[1:50:11] specialized and then you deal with
[1:50:13] direct action and then you you got to
[1:50:16] deal with unconventional
[1:50:19] uh uh scenarios and how conflicts
[1:50:22] develop and how they happen and you
[1:50:25] can't just be a new person jumping in on
[1:50:28] the scene. Somebody's life is on the
[1:50:30] line. It's a specialized unit.
[1:50:34] And so are we the bride of Christ. He's
[1:50:37] called us to a specialized
[1:50:40] training.
[1:50:41] Our faith ought to be the highest faith
[1:50:44] than any other group of human beings on
[1:50:47] this planet.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; And it has nothing to do with our skin
[1:50:51] color or our nationality. But it has
[1:50:54] everything to do with our training and
[1:50:57] our experience.
[1:50:59] I've had an experience with God. This is
[1:51:03] what David went to Saul with. One day I
[1:51:06] was hurting my father's sheep and a bear
[1:51:10] came up and a lion came up and the Holy
[1:51:13] Spirit used me and I got the job done
[1:51:16] and that was his experience. And then he
[1:51:19] moved to the next level and he went out
[1:51:21] and he fought a giant and he defeated
[1:51:24] the giant, his experience and his
[1:51:27] calling and qualifications. How many of
[1:51:30] you have had an experience? If you're a
[1:51:32] believer today, you have to have had an
[1:51:36] experience that made you a believer.
[1:51:40] A believer is something supernatural.
[1:51:43] Amen. To believe God's word, something
[1:51:46] supernatural had to happen to you. Can I
[1:51:49] get a witness here this morning?
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; It's not by chance. It's not a nothing.
[1:51:54] It's a something.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; I am a believer.
[1:51:58] Something supernatural
[1:52:01] happened to me and made me a believer in
[1:52:06] God's word.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; And then you get your skills developed
[1:52:15] on how to witness.
[1:52:18] You know in the scripture is 1 Timothy 3
[1:52:22] verses 1-7. It's talking about the
[1:52:26] office of a bishop which is a pastor or
[1:52:28] a shepherd.
[1:52:30] One of those qualifications in there
[1:52:32] that he must not be a novice
[1:52:35] because being a novice and that word
[1:52:37] novice it means a person that is new.
[1:52:42] He's inexperienced in the field or
[1:52:44] situation. And that Hebrew word there,
[1:52:47] forget the Greek word, but it's a Hebrew
[1:52:49] word
[1:52:50] 5194.
[1:52:52] And it means one of the literal
[1:52:54] translations means it's uh to be newly
[1:52:57] planted.
[1:52:59] That's what a a novice is. And the Bible
[1:53:02] talks about that a a bishop must not be
[1:53:06] a novice, newly planted. And it tells
[1:53:09] why. because you might fall into the
[1:53:13] trap of the devil and condemnation
[1:53:15] there. Moreover, he must be a good
[1:53:18] report, not a novice. Verse six, lest
[1:53:21] being lifted up with pride. He fall into
[1:53:24] the condemnation of the devil. So,
[1:53:27] there's an experience that comes with
[1:53:30] this role in this office. As I said,
[1:53:33] these great superstar quarterbacks,
[1:53:36] they've had years of training. these
[1:53:40] NASCAR drivers and these highly
[1:53:42] technical athletes that we see, super
[1:53:45] athletes that the world, some of these
[1:53:47] people we have never seen, a physique
[1:53:51] like that, that big, that tall, that can
[1:53:54] run that fast, that skilled in that
[1:53:58] position. And the world looks at that
[1:54:00] and it's highly skilled. We're all human
[1:54:02] beings. Yes, we all love the game. Yes.
[1:54:05] But this one has excelled to far above
[1:54:09] others. And we can say that about this
[1:54:13] messenger.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; We ain't never seen this before.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; The church has never seen this before.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Since or even since he left in 1965.
[1:54:23] What what what can compare to what that
[1:54:26] ministry was?
[1:54:28] It's amazing how the intellectuals that
[1:54:31] now come against this great messenger.
[1:54:35] But what was his first uh task of duty
[1:54:39] was to get the people to do what?
[1:54:41] Question him, factcheck him, make sure
[1:54:46] he see if he's telling the truth or not.
[1:54:48] If I can get the people to what? To
[1:54:51] believe me. and and and I found out over
[1:54:54] the last five years or more, maybe 10,
[1:54:57] maybe five to seven years, everybody
[1:55:00] does not believe this prophet.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; It's proven because this is what he said
[1:55:06] and they're not doing what he said
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; or they'll even argue against what he
[1:55:11] said or reinterpret what he said and
[1:55:14] we're still not at the place where we
[1:55:16] have believed him. You say you you say,
[1:55:19] "Brother Israel, we preached that for
[1:55:21] years. Believe the prophet. Come to
[1:55:22] church. Believe the prophet. We want
[1:55:24] something more. Oh, do you? I in this
[1:55:28] last day, look at the nonsense that
[1:55:30] swept through this city of unbelief. A
[1:55:34] direct negative force against this
[1:55:37] ministry right here. And what did it do?
[1:55:40] That they all stay solid? That they all
[1:55:42] stay sane? That they all hold their
[1:55:45] position? No, they didn't. Many left.
[1:55:48] Many fell away. many ministries got rid
[1:55:51] of the messages, took the pictures down,
[1:55:54] stopped quoting from it because it's too
[1:55:57] messagy.
[1:55:59] And then you have to ask yourself the
[1:56:00] question, did they really believe?
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; And his first task, his first order as a
[1:56:07] soldier, his first job as nobody else
[1:56:11] did it like him. Nobody he can he can uh
[1:56:14] you know you know draw strength from
[1:56:16] anybody but the Lord on how to do this.
[1:56:18] Lord, how am I going to get the people?
[1:56:20] How many people had an angel come to
[1:56:22] them? How can I say it, Lord? How can I
[1:56:24] develop it? Please show me how. And over
[1:56:27] the years and years and years of
[1:56:30] consistent preaching and staying with
[1:56:33] the word, there is a little bitty group
[1:56:36] that believed that what he said was
[1:56:38] true.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, absolutely.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; If somebody in those days didn't believe
[1:56:46] back then, nobody would be here today.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; This is why I thank the Lord for the
[1:56:50] elders that have gone on. I really do.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Somebody had to believe it.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Somebody had to be a quote unquote
[1:56:57] message church with no headquarters, no
[1:57:01] main bishop.
[1:57:03] Somebody had to do it. I thank God for
[1:57:04] the ones that did.
[1:57:07] So this specialized units that God has
[1:57:11] called up in this last day
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; comes with a lot of training, doesn't
[1:57:19] it?
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Specialized training. What's some of the
[1:57:24] training they do for a new vehicle that
[1:57:26] comes out? Huh?
[1:57:29] How many of you have a new car? I'm not
[1:57:31] going to embarrass you. How many has a
[1:57:32] 2024 and above or 2025? One, two,
[1:57:36] couple.
[1:57:41] Do you think they'll have a new model in
[1:57:42] 2026?
[1:57:45] Do you think they know what it looks
[1:57:47] like?
[1:57:49] You know, to to develop a new model is
[1:57:52] like three to five years in the making.
[1:57:57] Put that together. So your 2025 model
[1:58:02] probably really only is only a 2020
[1:58:04] model
[1:58:06] because it's being developed.
[1:58:11] It has already been designed. They're
[1:58:14] not waiting till November and December
[1:58:18] to start, you know, let's work on this
[1:58:19] design for 2026.
[1:58:22] Are you serious? When when do they start
[1:58:25] working on the design? You read it.
[1:58:27] years in the making and are constantly
[1:58:30] tweaking that model. They're tweaking it
[1:58:33] for is it market ready?
[1:58:36] Is it ready for is it going to meet the
[1:58:39] demands of the day? How did 2025 model
[1:58:42] do? And then we'll kind of know if we
[1:58:44] need to tweak 2026 and we got 2027, 2028
[1:58:49] on the way too.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Think about it, saints. Let me ask you
[1:58:56] something. Are you market ready?
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to be a member
[1:59:04] representing a member of a bride of
[1:59:06] Christ? I'm not talking about comparing
[1:59:08] oursel with other churches. I'm talking
[1:59:10] about comparing ourselves with what this
[1:59:13] brother said on the tapes.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the tape ministry. How
[1:59:19] many churches are a real church? How
[1:59:21] many pastors are real pastors? What
[1:59:23] about the gifts of the spirit? What
[1:59:25] about the Holy Spirit working? What
[1:59:27] about calling this the sons and the
[1:59:30] daughters of God? What about it, saints?
[1:59:33] Huh?
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; These great powerful motors that they're
[1:59:40] making today that they build and all the
[1:59:44] horsepower, you got to be trained to
[1:59:46] know how to use that power, how to drive
[1:59:50] that vehicle. You know, some of the
[1:59:53] testing they do, they they do a
[1:59:55] vibration test and then they do shock
[1:59:59] testing and they ch test it in the
[2:00:01] environment. I'm talking about it ain't
[2:00:03] even on the streets yet. This is all in
[2:00:06] the back room. This is all the testing
[2:00:09] that's taking place before anybody on
[2:00:12] the market has seen this vehicle yet.
[2:00:15] It's in the making. It's working. It's
[2:00:17] being built. It's being tweaked. It's
[2:00:19] being, you know, manipulated. all right
[2:00:22] now. It's testing its um ability to run
[2:00:28] into other things and it's crash tested.
[2:00:31] It's can it absorb the shocks? Can it
[2:00:35] handle vibrations? Can it go cross
[2:00:39] country? Is it a long haul? What kind of
[2:00:42] vehicle is this? Because I need to put a
[2:00:44] guarantee behind it when I put it on the
[2:00:47] on on on the public showing.
[2:00:50] What about you and I? I think I think I
[2:00:54] think Joseph I think I love the
[2:00:56] character of Joseph. I think Joseph was
[2:00:59] a secret weapon that nobody knew really
[2:01:01] who he was.
[2:01:03] This man was being built. He's rubbing
[2:01:06] shoulders with prisoners. He's coming in
[2:01:08] different homes and God is using him and
[2:01:11] blessing him. His daddy missed him. His
[2:01:13] brothers missed him. His mother, all of
[2:01:15] them didn't know who he was. and all of
[2:01:17] the turmoil and all of the foolishness
[2:01:19] and all of the craziness. Then finally
[2:01:22] the day came where God unveiled a secret
[2:01:26] weapon.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; A secret weapon to save the land of
[2:01:31] Egypt.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; I needed somebody in Egypt that can
[2:01:35] interpret a dream.
[2:01:38] Somebody with character, somebody that
[2:01:41] has the authority,
[2:01:43] somebody that knows what they're talking
[2:01:46] about.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; I really believe with all my heart,
[2:01:53] we're talking about the manifestation of
[2:01:55] the sons and daughters of God.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; I believe that that will take place and
[2:02:01] it's possible that it is taking place.
[2:02:05] This is not a Facebook showing.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; This is not for the internet to say,
[2:02:11] "Oh, that church, they're manifesting
[2:02:13] it. Brother Israel, brother whoever,
[2:02:16] brother so and so, they're manif."
[2:02:17] That's not what this is.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:02:26] If God came down in his love and mercy
[2:02:29] and started working through the sons and
[2:02:32] daughters of God in this little lovely
[2:02:35] little city of our own, wouldn't you
[2:02:38] want to be a part of that?
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; And if you are a part of it, do you have
[2:02:42] to tell everybody?
[2:02:45] Do you want the credit for being the
[2:02:48] first one?
[2:02:51] Come on, somebody. It's being made right
[2:02:54] now.
[2:02:55] You can have it right now.
[2:02:58] [Music]
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Probably going on in some little country
[2:03:04] they can't even read and write,
[2:03:07] but they believe this word with all
[2:03:09] their heart.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Oh no, no, no, brother Israel. If this
[2:03:12] going to happen, it's going to happen.
[2:03:12] Going to come to the American church.
[2:03:14] Really?
[2:03:16] You know, he identified the American
[2:03:18] people that their problem is they got to
[2:03:21] have somebody. He identifies them. I
[2:03:23] just read the quote for you. The
[2:03:25] Americans want, you know, the prayer
[2:03:27] cloth did so well with the Americans
[2:03:29] because they wanted something in their
[2:03:30] hand. But he went overseas
[2:03:34] without the AC and air conditioning and
[2:03:37] 24-hour clean water and 24-hour
[2:03:39] electricity. He went over there and
[2:03:42] stood at the platform and did it one
[2:03:45] time.
[2:03:47] and them precious humble hearts rose up
[2:03:50] and received it the gentile way, the
[2:03:53] higher way.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; What are we trying to do, saints? Where
[2:03:57] are we trying to go back to?
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; God is moving us forward
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; and he's giving us a tremendous example.
[2:04:06] Oh my,
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; God bless you so much.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandon brings this third
[2:04:10] pull so beautifully and he gives us an
[2:04:13] example.
[2:04:14] And so, in 19 I read it for you there.
[2:04:17] He said, "We don't know what it is. We
[2:04:19] don't know what it is. It could be." And
[2:04:22] then Sister Brandham has this tumor.
[2:04:28] And that happened
[2:04:30] near December, the time of Christmas.
[2:04:33] And he spoke that word over her and it
[2:04:37] manifested the third pole. Now, can we
[2:04:39] take a little bit of time this morning?
[2:04:42] And I want to play this portion of the
[2:04:44] tape. And for those of you
[2:04:47] that just take a note of it if you can,
[2:04:50] if you desire, I believe it'll bless you
[2:04:52] and it help you because we we you hear
[2:04:54] us talk about the third pool. Brother
[2:04:56] Vanam, in this message, it's a very big,
[2:04:58] deep, vast subject. But this little
[2:05:02] portion here and look away to Jesus
[2:05:04] covers a lot of what he's talking about.
[2:05:07] And it's it's it's like this to me.
[2:05:09] Either I'm going to take what brother
[2:05:10] Brandham said or what somebody else
[2:05:13] said.
[2:05:14] And I choose to take brother Brad's
[2:05:16] thoughts on it.
[2:05:18] All right.
[2:05:21] This is in the message. Look away to
[2:05:22] Jesus. We'll go quickly.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus said that what he heard that was
[2:05:28] what he spoke. And he said, "I called
[2:05:30] you my friends." And a friend tells his
[2:05:33] friends all things. Paul said in Acts
[2:05:37] 20:27,
[2:05:39] "I have not shun to declare to you the
[2:05:43] whole council of God."
[2:05:46] And may I join in tonight and say the
[2:05:48] same thing with that great saint of old.
[2:05:51] To the best of my knowledge, I have not
[2:05:55] I have not shunned but declared to you
[2:05:58] the whole council of God. Someone
[2:06:02] was playing one of the tapes the other
[2:06:04] day. Just because it made somebody
[2:06:06] angry, they shot at him through the
[2:06:07] window and a woman wounded.
[2:06:10] So perhaps someday I'll seal my
[2:06:13] testimony. But when that time comes and
[2:06:17] I'm ready to go
[2:06:19] until my time comes, there's nothing
[2:06:21] going to hurt me until that time.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Now, we believe in the same gospel just
[2:06:27] the way the Bible is written. It's
[2:06:29] zeroed. And and if the gun is exactly
[2:06:33] zeroed and in tune, if it strikes the
[2:06:35] target the first time, it'll strike it
[2:06:38] the second time and every time. If a
[2:06:40] tree or limb vine puts out a branch and
[2:06:44] that branch bears a certain fruit, the
[2:06:47] next time the
[2:06:49] the vine puts out a branch, it'll bear
[2:06:51] the same kind of fruit. And if Jesus is
[2:06:55] the vine and we are the branches and the
[2:06:58] first branch church that that vine put
[2:07:01] out, they wrote a book of acts behind
[2:07:03] it.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; And that first branch baptized in the
[2:07:07] name of Jesus Christ.
[2:07:10] And they had the living God among them
[2:07:13] that did the same things among them that
[2:07:15] he did when he was on earth. Therefore,
[2:07:17] the people taken notice to them, though
[2:07:19] ignorant and unlearned that they had
[2:07:21] been with Jesus because his life was
[2:07:24] through them. As I've said, if I had the
[2:07:27] spirit of of Beethoven in me, I would
[2:07:29] write songs. If B if I if Beethoven
[2:07:32] lived in me, I'd be Beethoven. See, if
[2:07:35] Shakespeare lived in me, I'd be
[2:07:36] Shakespeare. I I'd write poems and and
[2:07:40] plays and so forth. If Shakespeare lived
[2:07:43] in me and if Christ lives in me, the
[2:07:46] works of Christ you'll do. It's got to
[2:07:49] be. And what is Christ? The word. He
[2:07:52] said, "If ye abide in me, my word in
[2:07:54] you, then ask what you will. It'll be
[2:07:58] done because the word's there. Just
[2:08:00] needs the light and the light makes it
[2:08:02] live." So now
[2:08:05] I am going to say something to you now
[2:08:08] that I haven't said all along.
[2:08:12] That is the thing that we have looked
[2:08:15] forward to for so long or at least many
[2:08:18] years, four, five years or maybe longer.
[2:08:21] The third pull has now been vindicated.
[2:08:25] And I'm sure you all know what it is.
[2:08:28] Now
[2:08:29] remember, there'll never be an
[2:08:31] impersonation of that because it can't
[2:08:33] be. It cannot be. Now it's inexistent.
[2:08:40] And
[2:08:41] I have I am warned of this that soon
[2:08:47] right at this time now it's just
[2:08:50] happened so it could identify its
[2:08:53] presence among you
[2:08:56] see but it will not be used in a great
[2:08:59] way until this council begins to tighten
[2:09:04] up and when it does when that does the
[2:09:09] Pentecostals and so forth for can almost
[2:09:11] impersonate anything could be done. But
[2:09:14] when that time comes, when the squeeze
[2:09:16] comes down, then you'll see what you've
[2:09:19] seen temporarily be manifested in the
[2:09:21] fullness of its power.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:09:28] I must continue in evangelism.
[2:09:32] Just as I was commissioned first, I must
[2:09:35] continue on. Therefore,
[2:09:37] you've had the word and you know what to
[2:09:40] look for, how to stand. I must continue
[2:09:43] on in evangelism. And friends of mine,
[2:09:48] keep still and just keep moving on for
[2:09:51] the hour is approaching swiftly. See
[2:09:55] that when something is going to be done
[2:09:58] now, you might see some little odd
[2:10:01] things happen from nothing sinful. I
[2:10:04] don't mean that. But I mean something
[2:10:06] odd to what the regular trend because
[2:10:09] where I've reached to now in the
[2:10:11] ministry I'm dropping back here watching
[2:10:14] that spot and waiting for the time to
[2:10:18] use it.
[2:10:20] But it's going to be used
[2:10:23] and everyone knows that for as certain
[2:10:27] as the first was identified so has the
[2:10:31] second been identified. And if you'll
[2:10:33] think real closely, you who are
[2:10:36] spiritual, as the Bible say, hears to
[2:10:37] him that has wisdom. The third is
[2:10:39] properly identified.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; We know where it is. So the third pole
[2:10:44] is here. It is so sacred that I'm
[2:10:47] mustn't say much about it as he told me
[2:10:49] in the beginning said this. Say nothing
[2:10:53] of it. You remember that years ago?
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; It speaks for itself.
[2:10:58] But you I've tried to explain the others
[2:11:00] and I made a mistake. This will be the
[2:11:02] thing that to my opinion, I don't say
[2:11:05] the Lord tells me this. This will be the
[2:11:07] thing that'll start the rapture in faith
[2:11:09] for the going away.
[2:11:11] And I must lay quiet for just a little
[2:11:14] while. Now remember, and who's listening
[2:11:17] to this tape, you might see such a
[2:11:19] change in my ministry right away.
[2:11:20] Dropping back, not going up, dropping
[2:11:23] back. We're right at the age now, and it
[2:11:25] can't be can't go any further. We have
[2:11:27] to wait just a minute until this happens
[2:11:30] over here to catch up. Then the time
[2:11:32] comes. But it's thoroughly identified.
[2:11:35] There's coming a time upon in this
[2:11:38] nation to where this nation is going to
[2:11:41] exercise all the power that the beast
[2:11:43] had before it which was pagan Rome when
[2:11:45] it become papome.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; That's this nation will do that.
[2:11:50] Revelations 13 plainly explains it. The
[2:11:54] lamb come up out of the earth. The other
[2:11:55] beasts come up out of water, thickness
[2:11:57] and multitudes of people. This lamb come
[2:11:59] up where there was no people. A lamb
[2:12:02] represents uh religion uh the lamb of
[2:12:05] God. And remember it spoke like a lamb.
[2:12:09] It was a lamb and then after a while it
[2:12:12] be received power and spoke like a
[2:12:15] dragon
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; and exercised all the the dragon power
[2:12:19] the dragon had before him. And the
[2:12:21] dragon is Rome always. So don't you see
[2:12:25] Roman denomination
[2:12:29] a marked Protestant denomination
[2:12:32] a image unto the beast making a power
[2:12:36] that'll force all Protestants like a
[2:12:38] union. You'll have to be into this
[2:12:41] council of churches or you won't be able
[2:12:45] to have fellowship or to to well it's
[2:12:48] it's practically that way now. You can't
[2:12:50] go to a church and preach unless you
[2:12:52] have a fellowship card or some
[2:12:54] identification. And now on persons like
[2:12:57] ourselves, we're going to be cut out of
[2:12:58] all that alto together. That's exactly
[2:13:00] because it won't be able to do it. It's
[2:13:02] tightening. And then when that time
[2:13:05] comes and the press comes to a place to
[2:13:07] where you're pressed out, then watch
[2:13:10] what I'm fixing to tell you in a few
[2:13:11] minutes. Watch the third pull then. And
[2:13:14] it'll be absolutely to the total lost,
[2:13:17] but it it will be for the bride in the
[2:13:19] church. Now, we're closer than it seems
[2:13:23] to be. I don't know when, but it's real
[2:13:26] real close.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; I may be building a platform for
[2:13:31] somebody else to step on.
[2:13:34] I may be taken before that time. I don't
[2:13:36] know. And that time may be this coming
[2:13:38] week that the Holy Spirit will come with
[2:13:42] and bring Christ Jesus. He may come this
[2:13:45] next week. He may come yet tonight. I
[2:13:48] don't know when he will come. He doesn't
[2:13:50] tell us that. But I do believe that we
[2:13:53] are so close that I would never die with
[2:13:55] old age. Yet at 54 years old, I'll never
[2:13:58] die with old age until he's here.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; Unless I'm shot, killed, or something
[2:14:03] other some way killed. this old age
[2:14:05] wouldn't kill me until he's come. And I
[2:14:07] believe that, and I want to say this,
[2:14:09] I've never said it before, but according
[2:14:12] to scripture, according to what he said
[2:14:15] 30 years ago, 33 years ago on the river
[2:14:18] down there in 1933, rather what he said,
[2:14:21] everything has happened just exactly. I
[2:14:25] may not do it, but this message will
[2:14:27] introduce Jesus Christ to the world. For
[2:14:30] as John the Baptist was sent to forrun
[2:14:32] the first coming, so is the message to
[2:14:35] forrun the second coming. And John said,
[2:14:38] "Behold the lamb of God that takes away
[2:14:40] the sin of the world." So it's it
[2:14:43] paralleled it in every way and I know it
[2:14:45] will the message will go on. Now
[2:14:49] there's been some great things take
[2:14:51] place along the road. This morning I was
[2:14:54] having interviews in the room here
[2:14:57] and a a young fellow by the name of
[2:15:00] Autry. He's probably still in here
[2:15:02] tonight. He's from San Anton, Texas. He
[2:15:05] come asked if we was going to Dallas
[2:15:07] coming from California if we could drop
[2:15:09] in one night at their uh tabernacle just
[2:15:13] for one night and they're looking it up
[2:15:15] uh the next day or two to see if we can
[2:15:16] do that. And he was telling me about I'd
[2:15:19] never been to Sanon since that first
[2:15:21] meeting. Now the first meeting when I
[2:15:23] come to San Anton I was there I think
[2:15:26] with brother Coot and the uh and the
[2:15:29] international Bible school and I forget
[2:15:31] the auditorium we had the service in and
[2:15:34] it's either my first night or second
[2:15:36] night I think the first night when I was
[2:15:38] walking to the platform someone's raised
[2:15:42] up in the building way back in the back
[2:15:45] and spoke with tongues like a a machine
[2:15:48] gun firing and no more and sat down just
[2:15:51] a moment or to to one raised on the
[2:15:53] platform and give the interpretation
[2:15:56] and I stopped at what he said and I said
[2:15:59] to the man do you know this man said no
[2:16:03] sir and he said uh I said how'd you come
[2:16:06] here he said the people I work for was
[2:16:09] at uh was here tonight and they brought
[2:16:12] me he's a was a cowboy
[2:16:14] and I said what do you do he said do you
[2:16:17] know him said no sir I never seen him
[2:16:20] and I said what are you and he was a a
[2:16:22] merchant in the city and what they said
[2:16:25] in the the now I was always before I
[2:16:29] learned better I was a little skeptic of
[2:16:31] speaking in tongues. I thought a lot of
[2:16:33] it was flesh and it might be but when
[2:16:36] this was said that interpretation
[2:16:40] was exactly what the angel of the Lord
[2:16:42] said down on the river 11 years before
[2:16:44] that
[2:16:46] John the Baptist was sent to forerun the
[2:16:49] first coming of Christ. You're sent the
[2:16:51] forerun the second gy
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; there it was when that angel that light
[2:16:56] has been thoroughly identified both by
[2:16:58] the church by the word by science and
[2:17:01] everything has identified that light for
[2:17:03] its first time to appear in public
[2:17:05] standing right over where I was at by
[2:17:08] 2:00 in the afternoon at the foot of the
[2:17:10] bridge right right down here at the foot
[2:17:12] of spring street in the water now that's
[2:17:14] been many many years ago and exactly
[2:17:18] what it said has come to pass to the
[2:17:20] dock
[2:17:21] This brother uh here was telling me this
[2:17:23] morning he married a girl out of the
[2:17:25] church her sister Noi's uh daughter. Now
[2:17:28] I don't know I guess a young man or you
[2:17:30] hear a brother uh Audrey I don't know he
[2:17:33] was from Sanon I don't know whether he's
[2:17:35] here or not uh he was here this morning
[2:17:37] and he was telling me I believe it was
[2:17:39] his grandfather during that meeting had
[2:17:42] been an epileptic all of his life and
[2:17:44] was brought there. That's the first
[2:17:47] beginning of the ministry when it said
[2:17:50] that if the discernment was put their
[2:17:53] hands upon mine and what would be said
[2:17:56] would be what it was. And I told you and
[2:17:59] many are witnesses tonight that it would
[2:18:01] come to pass that I would know the very
[2:18:03] secret of their heart. You remember that
[2:18:05] before it ever happened about five or
[2:18:08] six years later that taken place and up
[2:18:11] in Canada for its first time and that
[2:18:14] happened. Then he said, "If you'll keep
[2:18:15] being sincere, it'll just keep going."
[2:18:18] And now the third thing has taken place.
[2:18:21] See, just constantly moving on. And he
[2:18:25] said his father was brought into the
[2:18:27] line and told of this epilepsy and so
[2:18:29] forth and a prayer prayed for him. And
[2:18:32] that's been 16 years ago. I think it is
[2:18:36] about 16 or 17 years ago. And he says he
[2:18:39] never has had a seizure of it since. And
[2:18:41] he's pretty 85 years old. Never had a
[2:18:44] seizure since.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; What is it? Jesus Christ. The same
[2:18:49] yesterday, day and forever. Is Margie
[2:18:51] Morgan in the building? Sister Margie
[2:18:53] Morgan, a lady that was eaten up with
[2:18:55] cancer, a nurse. How many remember
[2:18:58] Sister Morgan? If she's here, she can't
[2:18:59] get in. She was nursing. You see, on the
[2:19:03] cancer list in Louisville, the woman's
[2:19:05] been dead for about 16, 17 years.
[2:19:10] On the cancer list in Louisville. When
[2:19:13] Jim Tom Robinson, the attorney,
[2:19:16] Christian attorney, heard about it, he
[2:19:18] went to the Baptist hospital to check
[2:19:20] and see if he's right because his
[2:19:21] father's on the board trustee at the
[2:19:24] Baptist hospital and they looked up the
[2:19:26] case and the woman was supposed to been
[2:19:28] dead years ago and she's nursing here at
[2:19:30] the Jeffersonville in the hospital when
[2:19:33] she stood right here when they had to
[2:19:35] hold her up not even in her own mind but
[2:19:38] it was thus sayaeth the Lord and she's a
[2:19:40] living. She went to nursing in
[2:19:42] Louisville and a fellow down here
[2:19:46] Shimp's candy place. Is Mr. Shimp here
[2:19:49] tonight? I'd like for him to tell it if
[2:19:50] he's here. Sunny Shimp, great healthy
[2:19:53] man. Many times and I used to I hate to
[2:19:57] say this, but it's the truth. Pop used
[2:19:59] to give me a dime if I worked all week.
[2:20:02] And I'd come to town and park my bicycle
[2:20:05] around at brother Mike Eaggan's place,
[2:20:09] one of the trustees here with Jimmy
[2:20:11] Pool. I think his son is here tonight,
[2:20:13] Jim and I, and Ernest Fischer. And we
[2:20:15] would go downtown and go to the picture
[2:20:18] show uh for a nickel. And we used to see
[2:20:22] the old steel pictures with little kids
[2:20:24] and one about 8 10 years old. We had
[2:20:26] that William S. Hart. Many of you guys
[2:20:28] don't remember him, the old actor. Steel
[2:20:31] pictures. I couldn't read. I just had to
[2:20:33] watch what was going on. And uh you
[2:20:35] would have to spill it all out. I
[2:20:37] couldn't make it, but I'd watch what he
[2:20:38] was doing. I'd have an extra nickel. How
[2:20:41] many remembers getting a penny ice cream
[2:20:43] cone? All right. I could get three ice
[2:20:45] cream cones and two pennies worth of red
[2:20:47] hots. I couldn't hold the ice cream
[2:20:50] cone. So, I'd eat them and get me two
[2:20:52] pennies worth of red hots. It' be almost
[2:20:54] a half a pound of them thing. And shimps
[2:20:56] made them. And I go in there and sit
[2:20:58] back and watch William Asshart. And this
[2:21:01] young fella, a little older than I,
[2:21:04] stricken down with a disease that five
[2:21:07] noted specialists of Louisville passed
[2:21:09] him by weighing about 45 pounds and was
[2:21:12] dying. Miss Morgan was nursing him and
[2:21:15] he was in such a condition. He had some
[2:21:18] many things. His lungs was gone, his
[2:21:20] throat was gone, his little arms was
[2:21:22] just about that big around. and he was
[2:21:25] laying there dying and Miss Morgan was
[2:21:28] hard to come on the job. So she said to
[2:21:30] him, "Uh, I was once the cancer patient
[2:21:34] and began to tell him." He said, "Who'
[2:21:36] you say, Billy Brand?" Why? He said,
[2:21:39] "I've sold him a many a bunch of red
[2:21:41] hots and ice cream cones." He said,
[2:21:44] "Wonder if he'd come pray for me." And I
[2:21:46] went over to pray for Juny um uh Shimp.
[2:21:50] And uh if you'd like to talk to him,
[2:21:52] it's Shimp's Candy right next door or
[2:21:54] second door from Lero's Theater down the
[2:21:56] street. Shimps Candy. All of you here
[2:21:58] know where that's at. M one of the
[2:21:59] oldest establish in Jeffersonville. And
[2:22:02] while laying there dying with five
[2:22:05] specialists giving him just hours to
[2:22:07] live was thus saith the law,
[2:22:12] you'll not die, but you'll sell me again
[2:22:16] red hots.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; Over the counter. Glory to God.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Long I know he got well, but long had I
[2:22:23] forgotten that. And wife and I was going
[2:22:27] down to buy some candy when we got here
[2:22:29] at Christmas. And how I don't know that
[2:22:32] we ever thought of shimps cuz usually
[2:22:34] you go over here some of these
[2:22:36] drugstores and pick it up. But we
[2:22:37] stopped in front of shims. When I went
[2:22:39] in, his sister looked and she said,
[2:22:41] "Well, brother Brown," she said, "you
[2:22:43] remember Juny." I said, "Yes." And there
[2:22:46] a great big strong healthy looking
[2:22:48] fellow. And I walked toward the counter,
[2:22:51] looked at it, looked down like this. I
[2:22:53] said, "I'll take a pound of those red
[2:22:56] hots." And he said, "Yes, sir." So his
[2:22:59] sister was waiting on my wife. And so he
[2:23:02] got them out. I said, "I used to eat
[2:23:04] them a long time ago over here in the
[2:23:06] picture show. Keep my head down." And he
[2:23:08] said, "Yes." Said, "Man, the kids buy
[2:23:10] that. They still buy." I said, he said,
[2:23:12] "My father made that. Fixed up that
[2:23:14] farm." I said, "I really like him." And
[2:23:16] I after he got all fixed up in the hand
[2:23:18] to me, he says, "Anything else?" And I
[2:23:21] said, "I don't know." And raised up. Oh
[2:23:24] my. He said, "Brother Brandon,"
[2:23:28] I said, "Here's a red hot, I told you,
[2:23:30] thus sayaeth the Lord."
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; About five years ago, he said, "Brother
[2:23:37] Brandon, I am so completely healed.
[2:23:40] There's not even one effect. I'm teeny
[2:23:43] bit hard hearing in one ear. I guess
[2:23:45] he's in his 50s. He said I'm teeny bit
[2:23:47] hard hearing in one ear because they
[2:23:49] give me so much antibiotic when I was in
[2:23:52] there. Amazing grace of Jesus Christ.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; I haven't got much time now to say
[2:23:59] something else, but I I I want to make
[2:24:01] this statement.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; How many remembers about the squirrels?
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; All right. That was a puzzling scripture
[2:24:11] in my life that I I never could
[2:24:14] understand that. And there was another
[2:24:16] that puzzled me. That's when Moses could
[2:24:19] tell God a better way than God know how
[2:24:21] to do anything. When Moses said they
[2:24:24] have people who say your God was able to
[2:24:26] bring you out but not able to keep you
[2:24:28] and Moses threw himself in the breach.
[2:24:31] Then later I found out that Moses that
[2:24:34] was Christ in Moses standing for the
[2:24:36] people. See? So then on this scripture
[2:24:39] and I never would preach on it if you
[2:24:41] say to this mountain be moved and you
[2:24:44] know the story. So I'll bypass that. Now
[2:24:47] little did I know what that was leading
[2:24:49] to and I think that brother Woods and
[2:24:53] Brother Fred and them are here in the
[2:24:55] building which was present when that
[2:24:58] happened or right after it happened
[2:25:00] there. Brother Rodney and brother
[2:25:02] Charlie from down in Kentucky. Sister
[2:25:05] Woods's brother-in-l was present when it
[2:25:07] happened down in Kentucky, which was the
[2:25:10] second time it happened. Just simply
[2:25:14] speaking into existence things that
[2:25:16] wasn't seeing all time and backing up
[2:25:20] the scriptures encouraging.
[2:25:22] The third time it happened was had he
[2:25:25] right? Is Hattie here tonight? That's
[2:25:27] Edis. How many knows Hadty right?
[2:25:29] Brother Woods and I were sitting there
[2:25:31] when it happened and when the Holy
[2:25:33] Spirit said give her what she wants and
[2:25:37] I was talking about that how do them
[2:25:38] squirrels come into existence and I said
[2:25:41] it's the only thing it is he's Jehovah
[2:25:43] Gyra just when Abraham needed a ram God
[2:25:47] provided that ram
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; and he provided the squirrels he could
[2:25:52] speak a squirrel just into existence
[2:25:54] because he's creator just the same as he
[2:25:56] could speak the ram Abraham never asked
[2:25:58] for He was just simply going on to do
[2:26:01] it. But it showed that Jehovah Gyra was
[2:26:02] there. When I said that, a humble little
[2:26:05] woman for the first time this ever
[2:26:07] happened. The third pull up on a human
[2:26:10] being was a little humble woman that
[2:26:14] making about $200 a year for a living.
[2:26:18] Well, she got out of her little farm,
[2:26:20] her husband dead, two children that had
[2:26:23] turned kind of wild, and come and
[2:26:26] donated $20 of that to the building of
[2:26:28] this tabernacle. And media give me some
[2:26:31] money that morning for groceries, $20.
[2:26:33] And I was going to give it back to her
[2:26:35] that day while I was down there so she
[2:26:37] wouldn't have to pay it, but she
[2:26:38] wouldn't take it. And when she's sitting
[2:26:40] back in the corner and when I said,
[2:26:42] "Only thing I know is he's still Jehovah
[2:26:45] Gyra." And little Haddie said the right
[2:26:47] word. She said, "That's nothing but the
[2:26:51] truth." And when she said that, Brother
[2:26:53] Bankswood, here's one that was present.
[2:26:55] That room felt like it was coming apart.
[2:26:58] And the Holy Spirit said, the same voice
[2:27:01] that spoke about the squirrel said,
[2:27:02] "Give her what she asked for."
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; I said, "Sister Hattie, as a witness
[2:27:09] before God, this is it." Now, if there's
[2:27:13] any doubt in your mind,
[2:27:15] you ask what you want to, and if it
[2:27:18] ain't laid in your lap, then I'm a false
[2:27:20] prophet.
[2:27:22] She said, "Brother Brandham," everybody
[2:27:24] was crying. Said, "What shall I ask?" I
[2:27:27] said, "You're poor and you live on the
[2:27:29] hill over there with no money. You might
[2:27:31] ask for that.
[2:27:34] You got a little crippled sister sitting
[2:27:36] here, Edith, that we prayed for for
[2:27:37] years.
[2:27:39] You might ask for her healing."
[2:27:41] I said, "Your father and mother is old
[2:27:43] and broke down, you might ask for them.
[2:27:47] Whatever you ask for, Sister Haddie, see
[2:27:50] now
[2:27:51] if it happens or not, right now."
[2:27:55] And I said, "He's just told me." The
[2:27:57] same voice said, "Give her what she
[2:28:00] asked for."
[2:28:03] And she looked around. She said, "What
[2:28:04] shall I say, brother Benam?" I said,
[2:28:06] "Say what your desire is. Think of your
[2:28:08] greatest desire and say it.
[2:28:11] And her boys was even snickering and
[2:28:12] laughing.
[2:28:14] And she said, "The greatest desire I
[2:28:16] have is the salvation of my two sons." I
[2:28:18] said, "I'll give them to you in the name
[2:28:19] of Jesus Christ." And there they went.
[2:28:22] And they've been faithful in this church
[2:28:24] with communion. That little fella
[2:28:26] sitting out washing feet with the man
[2:28:27] and things like that. We all are witness
[2:28:29] of that. She had a real choice. Her
[2:28:34] mother has to die. So does she. All of
[2:28:36] them. But what she asked will be
[2:28:38] eternal. Amen.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; And the salvation of her children.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; That was the third time it happened. The
[2:28:44] fourth time it happened, I just
[2:28:45] explained it here. The last time I was
[2:28:47] here, was up on the mountain
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; were that storm raging. How many heard
[2:28:52] it? All right. Were the storm raging and
[2:28:55] God being my judge standing here going
[2:28:58] down the mountain when David Wood, he's
[2:29:00] here somewhere, I guess. That made me a
[2:29:02] sandwich. And it was quite a one. I
[2:29:04] think he's trying to get even with me
[2:29:05] for the one I made for his daddy a few
[2:29:07] years ago. He had baloney and and meat
[2:29:10] and everything mixed together. I put it
[2:29:13] in my shirt and it rained and just got
[2:29:15] just a big wad of dough. And I was
[2:29:17] coming down the mountain. It's so
[2:29:19] stormy. I couldn't even see my hand
[2:29:20] before me hardly. And I know just one
[2:29:22] thing. You're turned around cuz that
[2:29:23] wind's just whirling. Now there's
[2:29:25] witnesses here to that. One of them is
[2:29:28] one of our faithful deacons, which is
[2:29:30] Brother Wheeler. Are you here, Brother
[2:29:32] Wheeler? Where is he at? Uh, you're
[2:29:34] right here. Brother Wheeler. Brother
[2:29:36] Man, a Methodist preacher from New
[2:29:38] Albany. Is he Brother Man in tonight?
[2:29:40] Uh, don't know whether he is or not.
[2:29:42] Brother Banks Woods, are you here?
[2:29:44] Brother Banks, he's in the recording
[2:29:46] room. All right. And um, and David Woods
[2:29:50] and Brother Evans was there, I believe.
[2:29:53] Is that right, Brother Evans? Brother
[2:29:54] Evans stand against the wall was there
[2:29:56] and how they broadcast for days. Two
[2:29:59] days before that, a mighty blizzard was
[2:30:02] sweeping the land. Brother Tom Simpson
[2:30:04] is here tonight. When coming down out of
[2:30:06] Canada, they asked him to bypass there
[2:30:08] because he couldn't get through. A
[2:30:09] blizzard was coming. Brother Tom, are
[2:30:11] you here? Where are here? He's sitting
[2:30:13] right here. And there the clouds come up
[2:30:16] and I said, "Brethren," everybody rushed
[2:30:19] out. There was nobody back there out of
[2:30:21] a hund and something man back there.
[2:30:22] There's nobody back there but our little
[2:30:24] group and the cowboy, the rider.
[2:30:27] and we was going to stay. I called
[2:30:30] Sister Evans and had her call the wife
[2:30:32] and tell her to tell Tony if I didn't
[2:30:34] get out get somebody else to hold the
[2:30:36] breakfast for the businessman and up on
[2:30:38] the mountain that that day I said now
[2:30:41] when it first little rain starts or
[2:30:43] anything take for the camp I said within
[2:30:45] 10 to 15 minutes you can't see your
[2:30:46] hands before you when that blizzards and
[2:30:48] it'll dump 20 foot of snow just a little
[2:30:51] bit o over the mountain that's how
[2:30:53] people you read in the paper how they're
[2:30:55] back there and perish and everything but
[2:30:57] we knew how to get out and they know
[2:30:58] where we was at. And so we felt led to
[2:31:01] stay. And um so up on the mountain when
[2:31:05] that blizzard started, I started going
[2:31:07] down and I was just about a half a mile
[2:31:09] from where it started. And the voice of
[2:31:10] God said, "Turn and go back." And I went
[2:31:14] back as he told me after waiting for a
[2:31:16] while eating that sandwich that David
[2:31:18] give me and went back up there and sat
[2:31:21] down. And while I was sitting there in
[2:31:23] that wind twisting and blowing the
[2:31:25] treetops leaning way over into sleep and
[2:31:27] snow flying like that, a boy said, "I am
[2:31:30] the God of creation."
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; I looked up. I thought, "Where was that?
[2:31:35] That was a wind maybe." He said, "I
[2:31:38] created the heavens and earth. I steal
[2:31:41] the mighty winds upon the seas." And
[2:31:43] went on talking. I jumped up and took
[2:31:45] off my hat. And he said, "Just speak to
[2:31:48] the storm and it'll cease. Whatever you
[2:31:52] say, that's what'll happen.
[2:31:55] I said, storm, you cease and sun, you
[2:31:58] shine normally for 4 days till we're out
[2:32:00] of here. And uh no more and set it until
[2:32:04] the sleet snow and everything stopped in
[2:32:06] a moment or two. The hot sun is shining
[2:32:08] on my back. I seen the winds blowing
[2:32:10] like this come back from the north
[2:32:12] coming down. I mean, from the east,
[2:32:13] coming from the east, it was coming from
[2:32:15] the west. The winds changed and come
[2:32:16] back this way. the clouds like a mystic
[2:32:18] thing lifting up into the air and the
[2:32:20] sun was shining in a few minutes.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; Then the Lord Jesus spoke to me a little
[2:32:23] later on about my wife down there as you
[2:32:26] know about where I went up there. I've
[2:32:29] never been home on anniversary yet.
[2:32:32] We've been married 22 years. The first
[2:32:34] anniversary at first our wedding I took
[2:32:36] her on a hunting trip because I couldn't
[2:32:38] afford take the hunting trip and and uh
[2:32:40] and go on a honeymoon too. So I I kind
[2:32:43] of put it together. And so then um and
[2:32:45] I've been hunting ever since and I felt
[2:32:47] the way I treated her. Now that was the
[2:32:51] fourth time it happened. Now here's
[2:32:53] something I I want to say. I must tell
[2:32:57] exactly the truth
[2:32:59] about 16 years ago. I was in California
[2:33:03] with brother John Sherid and I was
[2:33:05] having a meeting and a media and I and
[2:33:09] brother Sher and sister Sher and I was
[2:33:10] staying in a hotel and a man named Paul
[2:33:13] Malikin who stood right here in this
[2:33:14] tabernacle many times. He's a wealthy
[2:33:16] Armenian and his wife had give birth to
[2:33:20] a child up at Fresno, California where
[2:33:22] they lived and was come down brought his
[2:33:25] wife down and called me at the hotel and
[2:33:27] said can I bring my wife up brother I
[2:33:29] said yes you may. Next day I was going
[2:33:30] to Catalina. So um they brought his wife
[2:33:34] up and the little lady was so sick and
[2:33:37] she I said, "Put your hand on mine,
[2:33:39] sister Maliki." And I said, "We'll see
[2:33:40] if the Lord will tell us." And as soon
[2:33:42] as she laid her hands up on me, I said,
[2:33:45] "Oh, it's milking." She said, "I don't
[2:33:48] seem to have any symptoms." I said, "You
[2:33:49] watch in two days, there's doctor in
[2:33:51] there for milk." Like little Jimmy Pool
[2:33:54] here, his little baby the other day come
[2:33:56] in with that heart attack they thought
[2:33:58] is an asthmetic attack. And I put my
[2:34:00] hand on him. I said, "Watch him for a
[2:34:02] couple days. He's got measles. It's
[2:34:03] coming through. It's a fever." I met him
[2:34:05] last night and said, "He's broke out all
[2:34:07] over and measles." See, now talking to
[2:34:10] Sister Malikin with a hand. She said,
[2:34:13] "That's amazing thing to watch that,
[2:34:15] Brother Brand." She said, "Does that
[2:34:17] work on every hand?" I said, "Well, if
[2:34:19] there's something wrong with the
[2:34:20] patient." I said, "Now here, I put my
[2:34:23] hand on." Many of us stood and watched
[2:34:24] it and it didn't do it. I said, "Here,
[2:34:26] there's nothing wrong with my wife." put
[2:34:28] her hand. Look here, honey. Put your
[2:34:30] hand on mine. She's studying there. My
[2:34:31] wife, she put her hand on mine as Suz
[2:34:33] did. I said, "You have a cyst on the
[2:34:35] left ovary. You do have female trouble."
[2:34:38] And she said, "I don't feel any
[2:34:40] different." I said, "But you have it."
[2:34:42] Becky was two years old, my daughter
[2:34:44] that just played a while. She was two
[2:34:46] years old. Two more years, Sarah come on
[2:34:49] the scene. And when she is a cecerian,
[2:34:52] and I asked Dr. Dilman, our doctor down
[2:34:54] in in Carden to when you have her open,
[2:34:59] look at that leftovering. And he did. He
[2:35:02] said, "Nothing wrong that I saw. I put
[2:35:04] my hand. It's still there." Four years
[2:35:06] later, come Joseph. I asked him, "Look
[2:35:09] again. Nothing wrong as I seen. Put my
[2:35:11] hand. It's still there." So, we just
[2:35:14] forgot about it. Now, this is something
[2:35:16] that I have to say. I don't like to say
[2:35:18] it, but it just has to make the truth.
[2:35:20] See, and that's what you want. always
[2:35:22] tell the truth no matter what takes
[2:35:23] place.
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; Years had passed would never notice it.
[2:35:28] And I say this not because she's sitting
[2:35:31] there because I say it when she's not
[2:35:33] there. And you know that.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; I don't believe there could be a better
[2:35:36] wife in the world than my wife. And I
[2:35:37] hope she always remains that way. And I
[2:35:39] want to be a loyal husband. And I hope
[2:35:41] that every young man in this building
[2:35:43] when he gets married gets a wife like my
[2:35:45] wife. I don't know how long we'll live
[2:35:47] that way, but I hope the rest of our
[2:35:49] days on earth, we've been very happy
[2:35:51] together. God was the one who told me to
[2:35:53] marry her. At the same time, her not
[2:35:55] knowing I was trying not to marry her,
[2:35:57] not because I didn't love her, but
[2:35:59] because I didn't think I was able to
[2:36:00] make a living far and she's a fine woman
[2:36:02] and I just didn't deserve that. And she
[2:36:04] went out to pray and opened up the
[2:36:06] Bible. And guess she said, "Lord, I've
[2:36:08] never did this before, but give me a
[2:36:10] scripture that'll help me. If I got to
[2:36:12] forget him, I've got to forget it." Open
[2:36:13] the Bible. when she went out in a little
[2:36:15] shed and prayed. And when she opened the
[2:36:17] Bible up, Malachi 4, behold, I send unto
[2:36:20] you Elijah the prophet before that was
[2:36:23] that was 20 something years ago knowing
[2:36:25] nothing about the ministry of this day.
[2:36:27] And I was couldn't believe I was laying
[2:36:29] down the river there and he woke me up
[2:36:31] one night. I heard him stand there at
[2:36:33] the door. He said, "Go get her and your
[2:36:35] wedding shall be this coming October the
[2:36:38] 23rd." And that's just exactly what I
[2:36:40] did. And we've lived happy by the grace
[2:36:43] of God. We've never had one word. She's
[2:36:45] been a sweetheart.
[2:36:48] One day I come in and she's had to raise
[2:36:50] these children by herself. Me gone in
[2:36:52] the ministry. Not many women would put
[2:36:54] up with that. You know that. That'd be
[2:36:56] hard. And I come in and she said
[2:36:59] something. We got Joseph back there and
[2:37:01] he's a he sure is a boy and he put some
[2:37:05] of the gray hair in his mother's head as
[2:37:07] well as I did. So he was a real old boy
[2:37:11] and he had done something real bad and I
[2:37:13] said to her uh she said to me, "Bill,
[2:37:16] give him a licking."
[2:37:19] I said, "I just ain't got the nerve, you
[2:37:21] know."
[2:37:22] And she said, "Yes, if you had to put up
[2:37:25] with it." And she slammed the door right
[2:37:27] in my face.
[2:37:29] Well, I thought that's all right. Poor
[2:37:32] little fella didn't mean that. I just
[2:37:34] went on out to wash my car. And when I
[2:37:37] got out there, the Holy Spirit didn't
[2:37:39] like it.
[2:37:42] He said, "Go tell her." I believe it's 2
[2:37:44] Chronicles 22nd chapter. I I I thought
[2:37:49] first I just imagined I just kept on
[2:37:52] washing and it said it again. Go tell
[2:37:55] her to read this. Now I went in got to
[2:37:58] Bible and read it. It was where Mo or
[2:38:01] Miam the prophetist
[2:38:04] made fun of her brother Moses for
[2:38:07] marrying an Ethiopian girl and God
[2:38:10] didn't like it and he said been better
[2:38:12] than her father spitting her face and
[2:38:14] and to to done that. So Miriam broke out
[2:38:16] with leprosy all over. And so Aaron come
[2:38:19] told his sister said come told his
[2:38:21] brother said she's dying with leprosy.
[2:38:24] And so Moses running to intercede for
[2:38:26] her at the altar. And when he did the
[2:38:28] pillar of fire come down God. He said go
[2:38:32] call her and Aaron and bring him here.
[2:38:35] And Aaron was in a tube. So he said call
[2:38:38] him and come here. He said, "If there be
[2:38:40] one among you, God speaking out of them
[2:38:42] that's spiritual or a prophet, I the
[2:38:45] Lord will make myself known to him. I'll
[2:38:47] speak to him in visions and reveal
[2:38:49] myself to him by dreams and and reveal
[2:38:52] dreams and so forth."
[2:38:54] He said, "But my servant Moses, there's
[2:38:58] no one in the land like him."
[2:39:00] He said, "I speak with him from lip to
[2:39:03] ear." He said, "Didn't you fear God?"
[2:39:08] See, God didn't like it.
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; Well, when I seen that, I run in and she
[2:39:13] was in the other room. I knocked on the
[2:39:14] door. She had shut herself up and I told
[2:39:17] her I want to speak to her. And I went
[2:39:18] in there and talked to her, tried to
[2:39:20] tell her what it was. I said,
[2:39:21] "Sweetheart, you know how I love you,
[2:39:24] but God didn't like that. You ought to
[2:39:27] have said that." Immediately after that,
[2:39:30] she tuck a trouble in her side.
[2:39:34] We took her over to the doctor here in
[2:39:36] Louisville. Dr. Arthur Sheen
[2:39:40] and he found a tumor on the left ovary
[2:39:45] that I'd found 15 or 16 years before.
[2:39:48] Tumor on the left ovary about the size
[2:39:51] of a walnut. I said, "What about it?"
[2:39:53] Doctor said, "Let's see what happens."
[2:39:56] Bring her back again a few month about
[2:39:58] two months or something. We tuck her
[2:40:00] back. It had grown from a walnut to
[2:40:02] about size of a lemon. said, "Better
[2:40:05] come out till they get soft and turn
[2:40:07] malignant." I said, "Well, my" I said,
[2:40:10] "We're we're going to Tucson. The Lord
[2:40:12] has sent me out to Tucson." He sent her
[2:40:14] up to a female specialist. He didn't
[2:40:16] want it on his hands. So, he must have
[2:40:18] told him about my ministry cuz he um the
[2:40:22] female specialist said, "I'll have to
[2:40:23] come out." So, he said, we told him was
[2:40:25] going to to Tucson. He said, "Well, I've
[2:40:27] got a specialist there, a dear friend of
[2:40:29] mine. He used to live in Tucson. He
[2:40:31] said, "I'm going to send you to him." So
[2:40:32] he wrote a note and sent it to him and
[2:40:34] said Miss Bram's a nice lady and went on
[2:40:36] like that said sent her the diagram of
[2:40:38] how big the tumor was and so forth it
[2:40:40] turned tumor then and said how big it
[2:40:42] was and said I know you know you know I
[2:40:46] think he thought calls me a divine
[2:40:48] healer that's all you know how to put it
[2:40:49] but said I have agreed that it could
[2:40:52] come out it should if it has to be taken
[2:40:54] out take it out but it's testing our
[2:40:56] faith constantly we prayed and more we
[2:40:59] prayed the bigger the tumor road. I got
[2:41:02] to a place though it was sticking out on
[2:41:04] her side. We kept it quite a few of the
[2:41:06] people here knew it trying to see what
[2:41:08] would happen. On and on it went. Finally
[2:41:11] when I come down from Canada from where
[2:41:13] I let the Lord let me lead that tribe of
[2:41:15] Indians to Christ and going back to
[2:41:17] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:41:18] this spring the Lord will now come down
[2:41:22] and it's time for to go when I was in
[2:41:24] New York or down here to have another
[2:41:26] opera to have the operation or be
[2:41:28] examined for the last time. I went on to
[2:41:30] New York and when I come back, I stopped
[2:41:32] in here and went up after I had the
[2:41:33] meeting here, the last meeting. I went
[2:41:35] up there and called her from Brother
[2:41:36] Woods and she said, "Bill, I can't even
[2:41:39] stand my clothes to touch it. It was
[2:41:42] just way out like this on her side
[2:41:43] then." And her leg on that side, she
[2:41:46] could just hobble along. The worst week
[2:41:48] she had ever had. Now, she's sitting
[2:41:49] there listening at me. Worst week she
[2:41:52] had ever had. And she said, "I've got to
[2:41:54] go day after tomorrow for that
[2:41:56] examination." I thought, "Oh, God, if
[2:41:59] they cut it out, they'll keep us from
[2:42:01] going home at Christmas." And I done
[2:42:02] told the people I'd be there. And I
[2:42:04] said, "What a time. Oh my." I thought if
[2:42:08] tell him if he's going to operate, we'll
[2:42:09] let it go a little longer to after
[2:42:11] Christmas. Then I got thinking it might
[2:42:13] be malignant. And back over here, you
[2:42:15] know, that's a bad thing. Run back into
[2:42:16] the kidneys. If it straight goes
[2:42:18] malignant, it kill you. So then I
[2:42:21] thought, what can I do? and immedi said
[2:42:23] well now you call me said the day that I
[2:42:26] got in Streetport which would be the day
[2:42:27] after that when I got in Streetport she
[2:42:29] had to go for the examin and um so she
[2:42:31] said wait till you have your first night
[2:42:33] at at and then come back cuz the
[2:42:35] difference two hours in time then call
[2:42:37] me when you come back at the meeting
[2:42:38] I'll tell you what I've got to do and I
[2:42:40] said all right so I went on and the next
[2:42:43] morning before left I was going to get
[2:42:44] Billy and Lois they're both sitting
[2:42:46] present and always we got an old stool
[2:42:50] there that brother Palm recovered for us
[2:42:52] sure not long ago and we always get
[2:42:54] around that stool and pray whenever
[2:42:55] we're old ottoman like you know foot
[2:42:58] stool whenever we get around there pray
[2:43:00] when I'm going on a meeting we ask God
[2:43:01] to help us and I've been up there a
[2:43:04] couple days and I I was lonesome the
[2:43:06] house the kids gone her gone you know
[2:43:09] many of you know I had to go through
[2:43:10] that one time go back to an empty house
[2:43:13] only I buried that wife home
[2:43:17] and I it all over again and I got out I
[2:43:20] thought well I'll pray and then go pick
[2:43:22] up Billy Loris and go on. So I got down
[2:43:25] to pray. I said, "Lord, I miss them this
[2:43:27] morning around here." I said, "I pray
[2:43:29] that you'll help them and bless them.
[2:43:31] May we come back to this place again."
[2:43:34] And now I said, "They're out there
[2:43:36] because that you sent me there on a
[2:43:37] vision and you fulfilled it. Now I'm
[2:43:39] wanting to wait to see what you're going
[2:43:41] to tell me to do next." I said, "I'll
[2:43:43] pray for be merciful to her." And I
[2:43:46] said, "Help me in the meeting down
[2:43:47] there." And then I kept I said, "Lord,
[2:43:50] don't let it be malignant and let that
[2:43:52] doctor wait till after the first year to
[2:43:54] take it out. I I just hate to see her."
[2:43:58] I said, "Lord,
[2:43:59] she didn't mean what she did that
[2:44:01] morning. She didn't mean that." I said,
[2:44:03] "Lord, not one time has she ever said
[2:44:07] one word about me going in the meeting
[2:44:09] months or whatever it was. Not one time
[2:44:11] has she ever opened her mouth about it.
[2:44:13] She's always sent my clothes to the
[2:44:14] cleaners and washed my shirts and had
[2:44:16] everything ready to go on a meeting.
[2:44:18] Then she wonders how she can serve God.
[2:44:21] You women,
[2:44:24] as you serve your husband, you serve
[2:44:26] God, of course. And now, and then when I
[2:44:29] come in all tired and wore out, people
[2:44:32] coming from everywhere. I'd have to go
[2:44:34] out somewhere on a fishing trip or hunt
[2:44:35] trip. Well, many women would have blowed
[2:44:37] up at that. What she do? Got my hunting
[2:44:40] clothes ready for me to go.
[2:44:43] let me go. I said, Lord, she didn't mean
[2:44:45] that now. I said, she's had to be cut
[2:44:47] open three times on account of she's a
[2:44:49] Syrian. And I said, I Lord, I I hate to
[2:44:53] see her have to do it again. Just then I
[2:44:55] heard something in the room.
[2:44:57] I looked up and a voice said, "Stand
[2:44:59] up." Said, "Now, whatever you say,
[2:45:02] that's the way it'll be."
[2:45:05] Now, wait a minute. I said before the
[2:45:09] doctor's hand shall touch her, the hand
[2:45:12] of God shall take the tumor away and it
[2:45:15] won't even be found. That settled it to
[2:45:18] me.
[2:45:19] &gt;&gt; I never called her. We went that long,
[2:45:21] went got Billy Lewis, went shreport.
[2:45:22] Next night I called her, she's happy.
[2:45:24] She said, "Bill, I want to tell you now
[2:45:26] here she is and she can verify this." I
[2:45:29] had to hob her way over there. went in
[2:45:31] the room with the nurse and Mrs. Norma
[2:45:33] put her clothes on for the gown for the
[2:45:35] examination. The doctor came out and she
[2:45:37] could hardly get on the table. The tumor
[2:45:40] hanging up there so big and when she the
[2:45:44] doctor come in was talking to her and he
[2:45:46] come over to raise back the sheet to
[2:45:47] touch her and just before he touched her
[2:45:52] it left
[2:45:54] and the doctor didn't know which side it
[2:45:57] was on.
[2:45:59] He said, "Wait a minute." With the draw
[2:46:02] diagrams and all the pictures and
[2:46:04] everything else, he couldn't find one
[2:46:07] trace of it.
[2:46:08] &gt;&gt; He examined her over and over, he said,
[2:46:10] "I might not be able to explain it, but
[2:46:12] Miss Brandon, that tumor isn't there,
[2:46:16] &gt;&gt; and she's never had one symptom of it
[2:46:20] sent."
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; What was it? Notice just exactly the way
[2:46:24] it's saying. before the doctor's hand
[2:46:27] can touch it.
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; One split second in his hand would have
[2:46:31] touched it.
[2:46:33] &gt;&gt; How perfect is the word of the Lord.
[2:46:37] &gt;&gt; Now there's my wife and we're both
[2:46:39] before God. But before the doctor's hand
[2:46:43] could even touch her body on the road
[2:46:45] coming to her like that, something
[2:46:48] happened. the tumor left
[2:46:51] &gt;&gt; and they couldn't he he said I believe
[2:46:53] it was when he sweetheart I want to
[2:46:54] reassure you Miss Brandon is that right
[2:46:57] the way he said it that's right
[2:46:59] &gt;&gt; that that tumor isn't there
[2:47:03] &gt;&gt; you don't have any tumor
[2:47:05] &gt;&gt; what was it just exactly according to
[2:47:08] the word of the Lord that was
