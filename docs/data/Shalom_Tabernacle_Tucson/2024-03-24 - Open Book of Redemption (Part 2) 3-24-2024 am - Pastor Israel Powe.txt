========================================

blessings that you give us Lord and Lord a place to worship this morning Lord our hearts are souls are hungry for your word father we come to be fed at your table Lord Jesus we expecting Lord Lord that you'd feed us and we thank you Lord for your word father have the preeminence in our life today Lord in the Sunday School classes everything that would be said and done in the preaching of your word Lord we just dedicate this time to you thank you for the health that you've given us to be here Lord in a ready mind willing and able father Lord may we worship in spirit and Truth today and be and so you may be pleased with our worship father and our lives we thank you for it in the name of Jesus Christ we ask amen Revelation 6 verse 5 and 6 and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see and I beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of Bley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine I believe we left off at about paragraph 190 if that's correct last week we'll go for approximately 20 minutes let's sing only believe only be only believe all things are possible only believe only be only be all things are possible only you may be seated brother Brena now and John walked up to see what it would be what did he see he seen a black horse and his rider had a balel or scales in his hand now that's the first thing he saw when the lamb announced it uh broke the seal then the other beast and beasts were taking a turn about announcing come see John where he was standing maybe like this he walks over here when his lamb open walked over usually the Thunder strikes as we've seen the first seal and he watches to see what takes place and he sees a man coming first on a white horse he watches him ride down on down to John sees him come to the end he sees him come down he's White Horse got a bow in his hand and the rider has and he has no Arrows with it the next thing he sees he gets a crown rides right on through then we find out then the light there comes again he opens another and looks now here comes a a red horse this man has a sword in his hand rides right on down through the scriptures see with his sword in his hand and was to kill and take peace from the earth now the lamb opens another seal another one of the living creatures like a man say come see now he walks up see what this is and what he does there comes a rider on a black horse now last night we found out that the same Rider that rode the White Horse was the same one on the Redwood and the voice said in the midst of the called out to see to have come to see what it was he was uh in this living creatures and he saw this black horse and when the voice in the midst of the four beasts called out a measure of wheat for a penny and and uh three measures of barley for a penny but see it thou hurt not the the oril and the wine this rer let's discuss him if you notice the first Rider who he was and we found out last night scripturally that the second writer was exactly the same man only he on another heart what happened it changed his ministry see right we found out he was an antichrist amen and he changed his position we found out that when he first just was a white horse he would come ad doing now we've taken every one of these right back in the scriptures I watch where we're at tonight that other Church age now we're come down to the Third Church age now just Z the Third Church age is this Z like with third horse First Church age why what the nians had a Doctrine see this the first one all right and then the first thing we know this nickan Doctrine it becomes sanctioned and was right went into action and they crown this fell then this Spirit Antichrist become in in carnate in a man see and we find out later on he becomes an incarnate devil too the demon goes away and the Devil comes in and just as that church is that kind of antichrist Church progresses so has the Bride come along amen with different things too justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost is moving right on see that's not only they taken their Revival first in the church is taken it at last their first three years the first three stages of them and went through the Dark Age then the Third three station comes a church out from justification sanctification baptism holy ghost in incarnate God made manifest the moment here he comes in as the Antichrist as the false prophet then the Beast then the Dark Age and the church comes out of that Dark Age justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost Incarnate Word [Music] the and he goes down he goes down the church goes up it's just as perfect as it can be oh it's beautiful I just love it this writer is the same one but another stage of his ministry the first stage of White Horse see he was a just a teacher just an antichrist teacher he was against the word of God now how can you be an antichrist anybody that denies that every word of this isn't true to be taught just the same as an antichrist because they deny the the the the word and he is the word now First Stage White Horse he was just a teacher but an antichrist spirit in its Doctrine and its quality it was innocent it couldn't hurt nothing seemed like just going on that's why Satan comes in oh he's slick bird they told he said now you know you're looking for wisdom you don't know what's right and wrong so now if your eyes were open you would know what and said the fruit is very pleasant it's good it's it's Pleasant to the eye you should take it now you don't know what it is or not do you no I don't but God said not to do it but oh well I know but God said he we done he said surely you won't do that just sweet as it could be look what it did watch this Antichrist Spirit rise up amongst the early church a doctrine of nickel adans niol conquer the L make a holy name or just well we just want Fellowship while you're scattered out here nobody knows where nobody's at I think we all to have an organization just be different see we go put oursel together we work to make a lodge out of it that's what it is amen there is no such thing as the Christian Church of Methodist that's not a church that's a l Baptist that's not a church it's a lodge there's only one church that's the mystical body of Jesus Christ and you're born into that that's right by predestination that's right all the father has given me will come no man can come unless the father calls me and all he's give me will come to me so that that's it he just the lamb sits there making making intercession till the last one comes in the little bell rings and he walks out and takes his possession so brings his church home his subjects and cast his enemy into the lake of far and all of his subjects go in there with him and that's it then we walk out in the Millennium same riter now this first stage he was innocent and second now after you went a little bit higher a little more than that the second stage the Bible said he be given given a crown and they crowned the man a Superman see crowned him and then the Bible didn't call him a pope the Bible called him a false prophet why yeah of course he was be a false prophet by his Antichrist spirit that taught Antichrist against the original word because if you taught against the original word it was Antichrist and the word is God say Christ but then in the N see a counseling was made and Constantine give him all the property and then what did he do then he see Satan giving his throne and Authority the Bible said so as we went through it now the next thing we find out that the devil controls all politics that ever has been or ever will be we find out in Matthew 4:11 and now we find out then that Satan already had politics but he's trying to get the church so he goes down to deceive it he gets his Superman Works him into an organization and crowns him viker a Christ Christ acted instead of God Amen see this guy's a biker instead of God see it's the same instead of God what he's supposed to be a biker under Christ now now when he did that then what did he do then he Satan tuck his political power which he was already over and took the religious power which has already been crowned and put him together and then he made him another Crown over hell and then had past on if they pay enough money to get them out so now he's he's back over Heaven over Purgatory as he wants to call it such thing the Bible see but he had to make something the Bible said it come out of the bottomless pit and returns back the same way and on Earth the ruler now what was he given in first he had a bow but he didn't have any Arrow but now he's got a mighty sword in his hand he can do something now then he jumps off his White Horse the white horse rides on out now he straddles what a red horse blood blood red horse he really rides that one oh sure now he's giv great power and a great sword to kill then he rides his blood red horse we see from the second seal that was broke last night he taken peace from the earth and did kill one another and his own martyrology of the Roman Catholic Church shows that they put 68 million Protestants to death from the time of St hippo of a St Augustine of Hippo until 1580 something 68 million Smucker's great reform if you want to read it do reform 68 million recorded on the martyrology when one of their so-called Saints got the Revelation that anybody that disagreed with the Roman Church should die as a heretic that's just set him around then boy he went to spill in the blood he he jumped on his white his red horse and he went to ride oh now his great power comes he was made biker of heaven and uh worshiped his God ruler of the Earth by uniting the church and state Together made him ruler on Earth give him a crown over that he could pray the souls out of purgatory he could uh also uh inter he was just like God on Earth instead of God to together he had great power to kill whomever did not agree with his command who's going to say anything to him Church can't stand nothing he's head of IT State can't stand nothing he's head of it so they died by the million all them little Church's brother was busted up and killed and murdered and fed to lions and everything else see a dragon roam give him his seat and Authority the Bible said so so he rode his tighted red horse through human blood to it to come around red horse now John sees him on a black horse he changed something else I have to to say this just the way it comes to me amen amen and if it come to me and didn't compare with the rest of the scriptures then God never give it see the scriptures has to ever one it's just one a great big big thing like that scripture has to agree with scripture and anything's contrary to the scripture if that angel of the Lord told me anything it wasn't scriptural I wouldn't believe him amen I said they're in Chicago the day when all them hundreds of ministers was anybody there at that meeting sure that meeting in Chicago I said now you all talk about you got you thought just twisting in here and something about like it's in this room now I said what is that you got it against me I said the Holy Spirit showed me three nights ago wh every one of you'd be in we

of them sat there and I went three days before and I said you're going to have to cancel that place it's a a stormy night I was having a meeting he said go stand to that window and that third little door there and I went there and stood right in there I looked out like that he said they got a trap set for you they go to ask you to speak at that Ministerial Association the greater Chicago said they got a trap set for you on your teaching of my word he said now they're going to cancel off that place so they ain't going to get they're going to get to a place where found said here it looks I

know that's that's well you got the pap sh also but there you are you see now now here is the mystery of this and now it when it reveal to me early this morning for daylight then I went quickly to the scripture and begin to look search up there it was three of them so far has been absolutely supernaturally revealed now here is the mystery of the black horse according to what it was revealed to meise Lord he has started riding him in the time of the Dark Ages that's what the dark harsh represented the dark ages for it was a time of midnight to the True Believers amen that was left watch now in that church age at middle Church age the dark Church age watch how it says you just have a little strength is a midnight to them for the True Believer now watch practically all hope had been taken from the true church for this fell controled both church and state what are they going to do see Catholicism had taken over both church and state amen and all didn't agree with Catholicism was killed amen amen that Tre is on a dark horse and watch what a dark thing you done see then you see and you just you know your history watch it and you well you won't have to even know it to know this now why all hope was gone that's his black horse now he had rode in on his White Horse cunning then he GI power he took peace slaughtered the millions that's what he was going to do as you rode on through he still does it see now here he is on his black horse now coming forth Dark Age that was at time just about the time after the church got set up and got in power they smothered out everything else and went through about hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of year is what every reader knows as the Dark Ages how many knows that the Dark Ages there's your Dark Horse am representing that Dark Age now all Hope's gone no hope at all everything look dark for the little Believers now that's the reason it's represent a dark horse his balances are his scales in his hand you see calling out measure wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see actually that is wheat and barley is natural staff of life that's what bread and stuff's made from but you see he was charging for this yeah what it means that he was charging his subjects for the kind of the hope of life that he was standing out to by making he started in that very time of making them pay for prayers charging for prayer they still do it no venius because what was he doing capturing the wealth of the [Applause] world the scale weighing out measure of wheat or a penny three measures of barley for a penny the rider on a black horse see he was making stripping his subjects of their money when the Bible predicts that he holds about the wealth of the world as we said last night about Russia and all that they just take all the money just strip the people for everything they got there you are now notice you see where that old money taken in church comes from wait to build an organization a big something million dollar here you see what the mother of it is thank you Lord oh my I'm so glad yes sir all right it's been his grace that's all all right all right it's a midnight time do you understand that now and here he is charging for the kind of life that's his barley and stuff natural wasn't spiritual now he was barley so and uh barley bread and wheat bread he was charging for that kind of a life that he was giving to his subjects charging for Prayer by the priest to pray people out of purgatory charging I'm taking this right out of History charging for I guess it's novenia I guess what everybody what

thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book Nether e to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof amen let us pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings upon the word this morning ask you to bless our feeble efforts Lord and may your name be glorified may your word not return void father to the one that hears it today May it benefit them and help them in their Christian Journey that's my prayer father The Young Ones the old ones Lord may they each one receive receive their portion from you is my prayer in jesus' name amen God bless you God bless you you may be seated the open book of redemption we started that on Sunday night and uh kind of want to move into that a little bit further the open book of redemption now the Old Testament reference that we read There was of King um Josiah this young man was just a um you know his life was spared to even become the king at 8 years old is when he became a king at at the tender age of 18 or 16 years old he started to want to make his direction towards the things of the Lord and before him he had examples the other kings there was good ones and bad ones but the one that he set his heart after was King David which was the first born of the Kings of Israel he wasn't the first king but he had that position as the firstborn Kings of Israel and so as he makes his direction towards doing that there's a lot of Reform a lot of Reform he's changing laws he's moving what's important to what wasn't important he's changing the ideas of the people he's really going in a different direction and when he turns 26 years old you know the Bible says when he was 16 that's when he began to to make these reformations and here he is 26 years old he has it in his heart and his mind and to rebuild the house of the Lord so he's going to put his resources in rebuilding the house of the Lord making it important again while he's doing this his men the workers find the book and this book is the book of Moses the laws of Moses and they take that book and they uh the Hokah the priest finds it then he gives it to the Scribe shaan and then shaan gets it to the hands of the king and when it gets into the hands of the king and they read it it has an impact over his life this young man tears his clothes what did he read now this book like any other book it could be a comic book it could be a law book of the library it could be a book with scribblings in it you don't know what's in the book until you open it and read it is that right so all books have the same value when they're just sitting on the shelf they don't mean nothing to nobody until it's open and read but in Revelations chap 5 this uh John in the vision he sees uh one sitting on the throne which was God and in his right hand he's holding a book and then a large Angel proclaims who is worthy to open the book or even to even look at the book and and to read what's in the book and no man was found worthy to look at the book to read the book so John starts to cry why are you crying John why are you crying it's a book it's just a book nobody can read it nobody's worthy to read it why are you crying it's because this book is the book of redemption and if nobody can read it and nobody can open it now the angel is really call calling for somebody to open it and read it who can open it somebody has to open this and read this because if if you don't open it if you don't read it I'm lost not only am I lost all of us are lost can I get a witness this is an important book this is something very emotional very very important happening in the life of John the Revelator as he sees this motion taking place no one's able to open the book no one is found worthy and brother Brandon brings it like this he says it's not that there wasn't worthy men there a worthy people there but there was no one worthy to open the book amen and uh uh uh uh Daniel was there Ezekiel was there Moses was there job was there all of the prophets of the ages gone by were there these are worthy people fine people good Brothers but they're not worthy to open the book now what is this book brother bam tells us that the book of redemption The Book of Life in The Book of Revelations the seven seal book is actually the word of God he says it is the Bible amen so let me read for you in a message M the first seal in paragraph number 31 brother vam says this John turning he saw a lamb coming out it must have been bloody and cut and wounded it had been slain it a lamb that had been slain of course it was still bloody if you have cut the lamb killed it the way the lamb was anyhow it was hacked of pieces on a cross Spears in his side Nails in his hands and feet Thorns over the brow he was in awful condition and this lamb come forth and went over to him that sat upon the throne that held the complete title deed of redemption and the lamb goes and takes the book out of the hand of him that sets upon the throne and and took and opened the seals and open the book you see the book actually was PL standing written before the foundation of the world this book The Bible was really written before the foundation of the world and Christ being the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the members of his bride their names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world but it's been sealed up and now it's being revealed whose names were in there all about it what a great thing John when he saw it he said everything in heaven everything underneath the Earth everything heard him saying amen and blessings and honor he just really was having a great time for the lamb was worthy like some of you did this morning in the worship service some of you saying amen and praising the Lord just having a wonderful time praising the lord it's all appropriate it's all in your Bible what you going to do when you get over there fold your arms be looking around no you're going to be praising the Lord you're going to be saying something like thank you Jesus Lord I appreciate you amen and so this book of redemption is the Bible brother random tells us this I read these quotes for you a couple times here in the past and I think I read them last night but I just want to or or Sunday night just want to read them again for you to show you that the book is actually the Bible was planned before it even got here on the earth now the Bible like this wasn't in the format that it was planned and written in because this didn't exist until later on it was Scrolls and brother Brandon brings out those Scrolls and he says the book actually was sealed on the outside with Seven Seals this book The Bible sealed with Seven Seals and just going to uh we'll we'll go a little slow not that I have anything more than anyone else but I have the quotations of the prophet and I'll share those things with you why this was so important this book of redemption brother vam uses that term title deed of redemption and so that that's not in your Bible that this is what the prophet brought to us it's the title deed of redemption it's showing the origin of man where what Adam lost in the garden now I don't know any Theologian and I don't know anyone else all we know is in the Scriptures it talks about that Adam had authority over all of creation he named them he was the first he was in charge he was the god of the Earth but we don't see all the details what that Authority means until we come into the message brother bham shows us that his authority was that he can speak to the mountains and actually move the mountains he can speak to the trees and move a tree like how you move a tree is different than Adam moving a tree when you move a tree you need a shovel and a pick and some good Brothers to invite them over to help you move some of this dirt we can move them but we need help don't we that's not what Adam needed Adam had the ability he had the control over the migration of the fishes and the birds he had control over all of nature he wasn't not a he wasn't an ignorant man he wasn't a low IQ just a dumb knot on the on the log he was a very in intelligent man he was the first spoken word of God God's creation His Highest order was a man he went from creation from the Lis all the way up to his Masterpiece which was Adam and whoever Adam was wherever he is he's still alive somewhere and we going to meet him someday those of us that plan on going over there oh my think of this man Adam and he was the original man and he loses this Authority because of not of deception but he willingly gave up all of his rights to the throne through the Earth and he gave all those rights of because of sin now brother vam continues in the message the invisible Union of the bride of Christ paragraph 308 he says this here there is your name on The Book of Life The Book of Life is the word of God because the word is God and God is the only thing that is life so your name was represented in the Bible before the Bible become on word what who said that what he saying look at your neighbor and say read it again brothers everybody didn't say that that's all right we watching you paragraph 308 there is your name on The Book of Life The Book of Life is the word of God cuz the word is God and God is the only thing that that is life so your name was represented in the Bible before the Bible become on word and if you're here to do that won't it vindicate that word beautiful that's right in the message works is Faith expressed the prophet of God says this in paragraph 120 the Baptist believe there's two separate books talking about the book of life and the Lamb's Book of Life he said the B apst believe there's two separate books in one way it is two separate books and another way it isn't two separate books I'm two separate people I'm body I'm Soul and Spirit three separate people but only one makes me a being modern events made clear by prophecy 1965 the prophet says this now the Bible is a different book from any other sacred book there's no book like the bible let me stop here don't you let the devil fool you in a conversation and try to equate your Bible to the Holy Quran or any other writing historical writing there is no book like the Bible we believe that now I I'm not a I'm not a uh I'm not a historian to know different grammars and what Hebrew is and aramic and so forth but by revelation God called me to know that this book the Bible is what we're all resting upon and I will stand in the face of anybody smarter than whoever or whatever to declare that because the truth is what's revealed to you it's not so much what you can explain all the time and when you stand up for what's truth guess who's standing with you the author of Truth stand in right with you so in any discussion with anybody whoever they are wherever they're from if you're quoting the word you're right where you need to be right and there's no need to be ashamed of that and I believe we need to raise the value of our Bibles raise the value of reading it opening it up and reading it again and the power that is Unleashed when you read the good book The Words that are there will change your life start right there start right there you want to get closer to God you want God to deal with you start with just reading your Bible just do that and watch how God begins to bless you and anoint you it's a supernatural book it looks natural but it's supernatural it's powerful when you open it up something already begins to happen and you begin to read it and quote out of there it'll do things for you that you don't think or you're not aware of what it's doing is that powerful it is God in word form that's what it is so don't ever be ashamed of God the god of Heaven the god of Earth the god of the good book don't ever be ashamed of that amen amen amen Saints so the prophet takes this in now the Bible is a different book from any other sacred book there's no book like the Bible because the Bible is God in word form it's a word it's a thought expressed God's thinking expressed it his words through the prophets they wrote the Bible which is in word form and Jesus called it a seed and any seed will bring forth of its kind if it's in the right condition the right atmosphere now this book this book of Prophecy it is foretelling future events now the book contains the entire revelation of Jesus Christ you don't add to it or take from it right and every Revelation must come by it can I get how many Saints in here how many Bible Believers in here every Revelation must come by if it ain't coming by the Bible I don't need to hear it you don't need to you just tell them to keep moving you don't add to it or take from it every Revelation must come by it see it must be the word so we see that this book the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ it's the book of redemption it's the book that holds the answers to life we call it the book of life it's not only the book of all life it's the book of your life in specific now you have a relationship in this great book it's a book of mystery it also is a book of History it's a book of his story and history it's the book of not just everyone's life but your life it it gets into those details of your life you know like today you know knowing the laws of this land you know there's SE there's several kind of laws that we should know or or we have access to through the attorneys and the attorneys study the law we don't know all the laws we kind of have a good idea about certain things but when we really want the details you have to hire an attorney you know attorney for real estate law attorney for criminal law an attorney for all kinds of laws that are there and those laws are written in Book for all of us the average human being probably don't know all the rights afforded to them until they talk to an attorney right is this right or is this wrong well I don't know talk to an attorney and then the attorney you're not going to do it for free now the attorney will counsel you on which direction you should take is that right and that's you know he's not making up the law he's just telling you the law that's in there and so um the good book The Bible has been sealed with Seven Seals and God has sent prophets Through the Ages to reveal the details of this tremendous book The Bible it's a lifetime there there is no student that can study it through all the way and be done studying it doesn't exist like I'm done studying The Book of Revelation so let me move on to my next no it doesn't work that way it's a lifetime study because it's a it's the book of life itself and all of the changes that happen it actually has the answers for politics it has the answers for what's going on in the future and in the past all of the issues of Life why people why people have lost their mind out here in society the Bible has the answer to that where are we going when we the Bible has the answer to that why are some people like this and some people the Bible has the answer to why do people suffer why is there pain pain in the earth why is there evil why is there good the Bible has the answer because it is The Book of Life amen and the prophet brings the revelation of what Adam lost in the garden to us so profoundly what he lost in the garden is he lost his inheritance he lost the idal deed he lost that power and the authority over the animal creation where he had a relationship with them the lion and all the other animals now they're afraid of him after the fall what happened so he loses this his inheritance and the the losing of this inheritance is what we want to talk about just for a few moments here he loses this Authority now hopefully by God's grace we will come back to what Adam lost uh as a Son of God we're being redeemed redeemed means you were here you were lost and now you're coming back to where you were before talking about Mankind so we start by the first man Adam I know the Jehovah Witnesses don't believe that Adam will be saved they believe he's eternally lost L they don't believe in hell but he won't be there on the other side that's what many of them believe I believe that's what their teaching is but we know that Adam was not deceived he was playing the role of Christ to Eve his bride when he saw the sin take place he took on the role of a kinsman redeemer and so what he did was he could have left her stranded out there and been like well Lord I got you know several other ribs can you give me a different one now you know she was blonde give me one that's redhead or or something like that give me somebody else Lord she she don't you know could but he loved her she was part of him and I'm teasing I'm a little joking but why didn't he just do that because she was a part of him so she's all messed up and here he is he's all in the clear and she tells him she tells him what her and the serpent did and how her eyes are old open and it was a great thing and so forth and he knew exactly what he was doing when he leaves all of this beauty that's right and comes down into humanity and get ugly sticky and this carnal Nation nature comes all over him when he partakes of this fruit did it deliberately he's a real man that's a beautiful thing that he did looks horrible when the book opens up to you you'll see that was a beautiful thing what Adam did we might see him do it again actually we will see him do it again but he won't be the first Adam he'll be the second Adam doing exactly the same thing to buy back the human race and all of humanity so what did Adam lose he loses this his inheritance now when Adam sin paragraph 99 in the breach between the seven Church ages brother brandom says when Adam sinned by heeding his wife's reasoning instead of holding on to God's word that's what made Adam sin his wife reason with Satan and then produced the product to Adam and Adam turned loose the word and sold out he lost also his inheritance when he lost his Fellowship in right to life remember the day you eat thereof that day you die and when he lost his life he also lost his inheritance in life because he had completely Supreme control of the earth he was a god of the earth God is the god of the universe everywhere but his son had this Earth under his own control he could speak he could name he could say he could stop nature he can do anything he wanted to see but when he did that he lost his inher itan Adam could say let this mountain here be moved over there and it would do it Adam could say let this tree be plucked up and planted over here it would do it see for he had complete Supreme control as a minor God under God our father because he was a Son of God now couldn't we stop here just a minute and get a real sermon amen yes we could actually then if the blood is cleansed it back what about now see look what the Son of God the second Adam did the works that I do shall you do also Adam lost his inheritance the earth now it passed from his hand to the one he sold out to Satan he sold his faith out into God from God to Satan's reasoning therefore his eternal life his right to the Tree of Life his right to the Earth belonged to him and he forfeited every bit to the hands of Satan he passed it from his hand to Satan therefore now it has been returned and has been polluted and the seed of Adam has destroyed the inheritance that Adam should have had and that's the Earth that's right so brother vom here is showing us that from Adam's hands it goes to Satan's hands and then Satan's hands he now has control over the earth now if you go further into the message you'll see that brother bam tells us that Satan's dirty hands could not hold this book but he still has certain rights upon the Earth and he's in the form of a squatter now so the Earth has been redeemed by Christ it's back into the hands of the original owner and for thousands of years the Bible now God has sent prophet phets and those prophets lives in writing became the word of God which is already predestinated and written in heaven but it had to be a manifestation on the earth so Moses comes on the scene Abraham all of the prophets we have the Exodus we have all of the happenings and the wars and the history and all of this is taking place under the under um God bringing Redemption back to the hands of man so now now we see in part what the book of redemption is to those that receive it it is life to them it starts a Reformation in their life but yet there's still a promise that this book needs to get back into the hands of mankind so this is uh Revelations chapter 5 this is the scene that we're seeing when John sees this vision and there's on the Throne God in his right hand a book and the angel proclaims who is worthy to take the book now brother Bram goes further and he takes what this Worthy is this what what um what this scene was it was a vision and that all of the host of all the prophets that went on before were there but none of them were worthy because they were all born under a sexual birth which was the original sin this is why Jesus had to be born of a virgin so when he's proclaiming who is worthy no one was found worthy no man couldn't be an angel couldn't be a created being it had to be a man and no man that was on the earth came on the earth except with a sexual desire outside of Adam and our lord Jesus those were the two men Adam didn't come by sexual birth it was a spoken word and so here now the angel is calling for who is worthy to take the book now when John sees this great scene there is no answer for him there is no man that is worthy to take the book now just to to clarify a little bit about this what Worthy is this this word worthy comes from the word worth and um the word worthy means deserving such as merits having Worth or Excellence equivalent with of before the thing deserved so it's the equivalent is having the worth that's equivalent to the thing that's deserved so and it comes from the word worth and that word worth we talk about worthy no man was worthy that word worth means value you take the word down it's a Latin root virtuous from the root Viro which primar it it means strength this word worth means strength it also means importance and another nice definition from the the older uh uh definitions in the uh the Webster's uh uh dictionary diary that I like it is the quality that renders a thing useful or which will produce an equivalent good in some other thing it's the quality that renders a thing useful or which will produce an equivalent good and some other things so it wasn't that there wasn't worthy people there but there there was there was no one worthy to take this book because this is the book of all of redemption The Complete Book of redemption now who was there was also Noah Daniel and Jo and I'll bring this out just for a moment in Ezekiel chapter 14 if you could turn there quickly we'll look at these this you know maybe we won't waste time there of course we're not wasting any time reading the Bible but I let us turn there quickly all right this always stood with me one year I was going through the Bible and I remember this Ezekiel chapter 14 I can't take time to find it maybe they have it for me or somebody have it read it for me Ezekiel Chapter 14 verse number 14 what does it say you have it Levi oh they have it here thank you though these three men Noah Daniel and job were in it they should deliver but their own Souls but their righteousness by by their righteousness sayith the Lord now if you take the full context it goes down in all the way to verse 20 if you take the full context the Lord is talking about a people or a city that have sinned and their sin is so great that even if and the Lord names these three now this is in the Book of Ezekiel but he names Noah Daniel and Joe and showing you that these are some pretty worthy gentlemen Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord who was more righteous than job Jesus spoke of him and Danel the Lord he was man well thought of and beloved and here the Lord now through Ezekiel is talking to Israel he says he's talking about the sin is so great on the land that three if these three men were living in the city it still wouldn't save the city they would only save their own life and it even goes down it says they wouldn't even save their children's life this is how bad sin is but to show you the worthiness of some of the Bible characters so when we when we think of this that no man was found worthy it's not that that they didn't have any worth not that there was no worthy people there but who was able to take this book of redemption who was able to claim the uh to bring back salvation to the Lost no man was worthy no man so this broke John up it caused him to weep to cause him to cry and in his weeping the angel told him don't weep John don't don't don't weep because the the the the lamb has prevailed the lion has prevailed there there's a battle that took place and the lamb has prevailed Hallelujah and the lamb is worthy oh my oh he'll turn your Sorrows into gladness and he turned job he turn turned John sorrow into gladness when he found out that he no man was worthy but don't weep there is a lamb that's worthy and when he turns and look to see this lamb a lion comes forth and this lamb was bloody and he was able to take the book this is the value of Calvary I don't care how revelated you get you'll never get more revelated than the cross mess message the preaching of the Cross Jesus died for you my brother my sister you're here today because of the Cross somebody paid the price so that you can even say Amen you couldn't even pick up your Bible but somebody made a way for you to pick up your Bible made it available to you to read and he alone was worthy he's the only one that's worthy of Our Praise he's the only one that we' ever Bow Down and Worship as lovely as we love our prophets how many love your prophets in the bible you love them all of them we love them people of God but there's nobody we love like the Lord Jesus Christ there's nobody like the Lord Jesus Christ that's worthy of our praise our lifegiving and our worship ship yes that's what our ministry is all about amen and so this lamb now takes the book and redeems through the cross there's a Redemption that's the price that's paid is his own blood now so there is a law to this why after all the years throughout the ages there was no man that was found worthy because in the levitical laws Leviticus 25 I believe and 26 right in there there are laws and then these laws were expressed in the Book of Ruth how many remember Ruth's story remember Ruth's story Ruth was married into the Commonwealth of Israel she married a man who had a brother and he was married and she had a father-in-law and a mother-in-law and they're all living and they're living outside of Israel sickness strikes the home and the her father-in-law dies then her brother-in-law dies and then her husband dies so you're left with these three women Oprah Ruth and who was the third one huh are you sure amen thank you you Naomi these three sisters three women major change in their life now it's a major change how we going to go forward how we going to move forward so Naomi somehow gets it in her spirit that she needs to go back home beautiful you know the Lord will will put opportunities or allow things to happen in your life to turn your direction where you need to go has done that for you before Oh yes and sometimes it's not convenient it's not cute it's not even worth talking about it's you're just glad to be where you are today I'm so glad to be where I'm at I I don't need to tell you every place that I've been right right but I'm here today by his grace and when you think about where you come from my goodness what have Grace never found you what have you still still stuck out there in your mess stuck out there in your ideas and in your plan but Grace Finds you and puts you in a oh my a place where there's hope there's a future a place where you have a plan for your life amen and this is these three girls here these three and so the opportunity arises and Naomi's got to leave so Oprah makes a decision to go back Ruth makes a decision we don't fully know why she has she's not a Hebrew but she makes a decision to attach herself to Naomi and she attached herself to Naomi in such a way that you know Naomi says you know what I have nothing to offer you I'm broke I have no kids I have nothing to offer you go back and start your life over again Oprah did it you can do it know and Ruth says no I'm not gonna leave you listen listen young lady you're still a young girl you can Remar you can start over go back and and Ruth sets it straight she says look where you go I'm going to go your God will be my God I'm going to praise and worship like you where they bury you that's where they going to bury me you know when somebody tells you that that's a beautiful you know they're going to be with you that you know get our burial plots next to one another because when you die and they bury you that's where they going to bury me no options who what if another offer there'll be no other offer I'm with you so she attaches herself to Naomi brother brandham said by faith now I want you to notice that this is The Book of Life the book of Ruth's life being revealed to her now she makes this decision by faith she attaches herself to somebody who's broke and have nothing to offer she only did it by faith there was no future prize there was no she was just faithful she made a decision by faith and she was faithful to her mother-in-law and it really paid out for for her didn't it is that right so they go back we know the story The Ruth and Redemption they find a field she's gleaning in that field and after gleaning so many years she finds favor with the owner of the field she's being watched and don't know she's being watched she's being protected and cared for it don't know she's being protected and cared for but things just seems to be falling her way maybe she's lucky maybe she won the lottery maybe she was going to win a prize you know no prizes here there is no luck here it's called Providence it's called predestination it's called This is what was supposed to take place and she's in boaz's field what you doing in this field of all the fields you guys pick why you pick this field I don't know and you're just there and the Lord begins to bless you in that field little handful she's working hard every day and she gets a handful every now and then she like woo man I'm lucky today no that was by design for Boaz went to the Reapers and said don't bother her don't mess with her and if there's anything left over leave some on purpose while she's Gathering it is that the god that we serve you know he knows who you are he knows what you're going through Hallelujah he knows the sacrifices that you are making and there's no sacrifice that you can make that our Lord does not see that sacrifice so he's watching after Ruth now the prophet of God deals with this and I tie this into the book of redemption because he does in the um in the in the seven sealed message he says this here I can get it for you here in just a moment yes the Revelations chapter 5 part one for I read that 2 Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the foundation of God standing sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his how many thank God that the Lord knows you Ruth making her decision a type of the church the the Gentile Church she decided and crossed over into the land not a lot of times we methodists and Baptists we think that's all you have to do she had just got started she hadn't got nowhere yet she just got over into the land now the next thing she had to do she had to work she become a legalist she had to work out her own salvation with fear and triing like you did she went out out into the field and put her clothes upon her she went out into the field and gleaned behind the maidens in order to get sustaining food for the day is that right what was she doing she was trying to find favor with Boaz so she worked her way through the stage of legalism and that's exactly what the church did the lutherans believed it by faith coming to the land but the Methodist taught sanctification which was the legalistic standpoint of it you got to do something I got to quit I've I got to let my hair grow out said the women of course they don't do it no more but they they did do it let the hair grow out they had to quit wearing the pants and paints in their faces they didn't wear their skirts wrong and short like others did they had to do something see that's what she did the state of justification the state of sanctification now when finally she found favor with Boaz what happened then Naomi told her you wait here while Boaz does the work of a kinsman redeemer cuz he's the only one that can do it he's our next of kin Ken Redeemer and you just wait here don't go in the fields no more don't do this that or the other you just wait until the kinsman redeemer has fulfilled and she rested that's exactly what the church has come to in this last stage of Pentecost in the beginning of Pentecost they all worked up and they had to do this they shook them and everything else now what now what is the church doing the true church is just resting what is rest here it is rest is the Holy Spirit the Sabbath day the Seventh Day Advent is wanted to tell us you know about being the seventh day Sabbath or something like that in Hebrews the 4th chapter we which have entered into his rest has ceased from our works as God did from his so the Sabbath is the rest and when Ruth was resting it was a type of the church resting in the promises of God we have the earnest now of our Salvation we're not worried whether we're going over there or not we're going that's right God said so God promised it and we've got the earnest done been received Christ has accepted us no way to get away from it now we're there amen all we have to do is just wait until he's done doing the kinsman redeemer we have the earnest of it right now waiting for the time that when he comes back and then what next thing Ruth was Ruth was rewarded now look at this paragraph 117 that's what the church did it entered into justification under Luther it went into sanctification under Wesley went into the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the last days and now resting with the earnest of our inheritance that we know that something happened in us we've passed from Death unto life and waiting groaning with nature for the time when we will receive im an immortal life and Immortal fullness our bodies will be redeemed everything redeemed we're just waiting for him to return back from the gate amen then what Ruth was rewarded that's when we'll be rewarded that's what this seven sealed book is going to open up to us what is these things they're Mysteries they're not wrote in the word they have to be revealed by the Holy Spirit but if you'll notice actually they are revealed all down through the scriptures but they've been hid from the people when we get to the role after a while you'll see how it was fixed then you'll know just how them things open up so here Ruth's life typed out what the church is going through it looks hidden it looks like just a story of a this little girl a story of redemption in her own life but it's really your story too it was written and then it's Rewritten again and then it plays over again and then it plays over again you see this taking of the book the opening of the book and the revealing of the book happened in these lives now Ruth received this great reward by the decisions that she made look at Ruth Ruth started out poor and broke with her mother-in-law and she ended up owning the field that she used to work in she ended up being owner of the field that she was scrapping for her life in it was hard for her do you think God knew that she was going to end up owning that she's there counting how many measures she's getting or had a good day today she's counting where she's going to G how she going to glean she's going back to her mother-in-law counting up all these and she was gleaning in the field sweating working it out you're the owner Ruth she didn't know she was the owner and that's that's the way this the book unfolds to her and that's when you know your rightful position in Christ now what's another Old Testament example of This Book of redemption it's the Jubilee year and brother randam brings that in the same message as well Revelations chapter 5 and he brings in this law in Leviticus when it comes to a Hebrew slave or even coming to your land there were laws so when the Book of Ruth was written to Israel in order for Boaz to catch Ruth as his bride he had to be a near Kinsman this was a law this is an Old Testament law and this law was established by God and this is the beauty of the god that we serve he's a leader and he leads by example he creates a law and then he gets under and subjects himself under his own law so he does doesn't break the rules because it's him he created the law and then he has to live by the laws that he created and this is why the the role of redemption had to be a virgin born a son of Adam that knew that was not purchased that was not that did not come here by sexual birth so he had he couldn't send an angel he couldn't send someone else he had to do it himself he's the only one that could do do it so he came in the life of a virgin and in the the office of his son the Lord Jesus Christ to pay the price of redemption why is he going through all of this because he made that law and that law he subjects himself to that very same law aren't you glad about that you know in the beginning when he spoke his word brother brandom says he spoke the word then he had to believe his own word just like you have to believe his own word amen and so the rules don't change even for God he's too righteous he's too holy he's establishes a requirement and then he subjects himself to those same requirements beautiful isn't it so that's what he does in the life of when he came robed in flesh as a the Lord Jesus Christ he's now the the Virgin born son of God and he's going to play the role of a kins a redeemer book of Ru calls him a goel he must be willing he must be able and he must be of a near kin it couldn't just be someone else he had to be the nearest kin and this is what Boaz was so Boaz wanted to marry Ruth but in order to get Ruth he had to marry Naomi and so he goes after Naomi redeems Naomi and Naomi was attached to Ruth or Ruth was attached to Naomi so look at all the wealth that Ruth gets for her simple decision back in another country to attach herself to something that looked like it wasn't going nowhere but she did it by faith and God rewarded her mightily same thing with you today so the Jubilee can I take 10 more minutes before we close are everybody got enough water everybody done going to the bathroom all right God bless you so this Jubilee is also a Act of redemption this is when a Hebrew has lost what belonged to him now let's take it in Leviticus chap 25 vers number8 quickly Thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years in the space of seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 4 and9 years so this is that 50e of rest that the land should get and also there were the the smaller jubilees after six years the seventh year was a year Jubilee this is that this is the the the the law for the land and for the servants that they can go free after 50 years verse number 12 for it is the Jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field in the year of this Jubilee you shall return every man unto his possession now you had something you lost something and you're living in slavery now the Jubilee year has come it is sounded now you can go back to what you lost you shall return every man unto his possession well as a man what did we lose as sons of Adam what did we lose we lost that original Authority that Adam had the faith that he had the knowing the authority that he have he didn't speak into creation as far as I can see but he had the authority over with the spoken word to move things and move things and move things and we can see that Moses uses this spoken word Authority when he's delivering Israel out of Pharaoh's hand and then we see the spoken word Authority given of creation given to our lord Jesus in this spoken word when he has control over the winds and waves and so forth and then now we see it again under the ministry of the seventh angel now the Bible has been sealed with seven mysterious seals and that's the complete Revelation the complete understanding of the full counsel of God so this book The Bible Through the Ages it's a savior it's not fully revealed or known or wouldn't be known until the seventh angel comes and he reveals the Mysteries that are in the book those seals had to be loosed off of the Bible we said brother Israel he you know one of the revelations that he loose was no eternal hell he talked about how that uh one of the other things was uh the serpent seed that was another mystery to be revealed and the um the order of the church and what the iniquity of of uh the the uh the Antichrist spirit and how that was to be revealed he preached that in in earlier years the mystery of marriage and divorce all those things those Mysteries were given to him and you say well Brothers well he he only preached the seven seal message in 1963 and he was already preaching the revelation of the of the the godhead and the revelation of the serpent seed in earlier years well it's because that those Mysteries belong to the ministry of the seventh angel now whether they came out in this series is the seven seal series a few years before many years after those Mysteries belong to the seventh angel he doesn't become the seventh angel when he starts to preach this series he was already the seventh angel and the M the mysteries of God should be finished Revelations 10:7 so in Revelations chapter 5 the book is closed no man is found worthy in Revelations 10 there's an open book now and so what is this that's this message that has been opened up in this last day the Mysteries that have been revealed in our last day and so brother branam when he goes through his seven seal uh uh h h a set of sermons remember what he said about his Bible he said his Bible became a new book right now it wasn't a new book as far as new information but it is now revealed to him greater mysteries of who the seventh that that constellation that happened to him that constellation and all of his life Mysteries like the thing I wondered about my whole life so as he's coming to a revelation of who Jesus is he's actually coming to a revelation of who he is where does he fit in the Plan of Redemption and that's what the book of the Bible will do to you too it's not just Bible stories of Moses and Noah and John the Baptist it's the story of your life it answers the mystery of your life it brings into Clarity who you are and this great purpose in the Plan of Redemption so when this Jubilee year would sound after 50 years everything you lost you can go back and you're free now to go get those things that you lost aren't you glad about that think about that just for a moment every 50 years this don't happen too many times to an individual I don't know how many times you can be 50 after 50 years and you say well I'll catch up on it on the next 50 years you probably won't be here it's like a once in a lifetime event the sounding of this word and when you hear it it will have an effect upon your life when you hear it that's the sound that you can go free yesen now it's just a book to other people it's just a book to you but when it's picked up in red is open up to you now the mystery of who you are now opens up and where does the Plan of Redemption lay it lays in you so first we know what Adam lost and then we see the law that require that was required to bring that back through the Jubilee year through Ruth Our Father God who who who who who who submitted himself to his own laws and he brought the book back he paid the price and now he calls us to receive the benefits that are in the book that's our position today is to receive what Christ has already died for and redeem for us now he purchased his healing for us he purchased deliver in the spirit and freedom peace of mind he's given that to us that's not those are not lottery tickets that we win it's actually purchased for us when you when you're healed it's not because you won a prize not because you were lucky you you were healed because somebody paid for your healing and you were designed to be healed it's actually the the book The Book of entitlement it's the book that is the title deed you're entitled to the Deeds you're entitled to the promises that are in there that's why it's called the title deed book of redemption so this book of redemption we receive that and we thank God for it now I like what brother bam says here as I prepare to wind this message down you know he's talking about the Jubilee Year I'll bypass that for a moment and in the the breach between the seven Church a and the Seven SS paragraph 39 he says this here now it's wrote mysterious because no man nowhere knows it God Alone Jesus Christ see it's a book of M A mysterious book it's the book of redemption we'll get into that in a little while now we know that this book of redemption will not be Thor really understood it's probed that through six Church ages but at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound his mystery he winds up all the Loose Ends that these fellows probed at and the mystery comes down from God as the word of God and reveals the entire revelation of God then the godhead and everything else is settled all the Mysteries serpent seed whatever more is to be revealed so this happens to you the individual is that right that's what a revelation is it's not a revelation of of uh uh who the next president is going to be you know how we get oh I know who it is I you know I know I I know who's going to be the next president and then like what value is that is it going to make you pray more what you want a prize now because you're the first one to know I mean you got to 50-50 chance and some of them had thus said the Lord on who the next president was and then guess what happened huh they do it all the time but this isn't the revelation of these things out here this is the revelation of who you are in the word as God opens his word to you it reveals to you who you are and then you know that you have the rights to to uh Salvation you have the rights to the Holy Ghost you receive the rights to all that God has promised in the book of redemption because these are the promises that are deeded to the Believers that receive it this is our this is our ownership it our name is identified in there somewhere it's written in there it's not fully understood all at one time but day by day he reveals more to us is that right so in the seven seal book he says this here he's talking about the lamb being on the throne and um in the breach paragraph number 200 I just love this statement here he says now oh wouldn't that be glorious thing if our sinful thoughts tonight could be laid aside long enough to accept him and he would Advance all the way from Glory tonight to make himself known to any of you and what is he showing he's talking about that when when John cried out uh who is worthy and the angel says don't weep John for the the lamb let's turn to there real quickly just one more time Revelations chapter 5 and he says and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and behold and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having been seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four Beast the 424 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song so they they said the lion would come forth word John don't weep don't weep John the Lion's coming forth and when John turned to see this lion it was a lamb a bloody lamb that was Calvary that was what Jesus did at Calvary now brother brandham asked the question where did this lamb come from and I'll close with this one last point and show you how this operation of the Lamb Works cuz he's has to be on the right hand of the throne in heaven and brother Rand says in one paragraph 195 in the the breach he says notice where it came from where did it come from it come from the father's Throne where he had been seated since he had been slain and raised again he raised up and sat on the right hand of God ever living to make intercessions amen raised there today as an intercessor with his own blood to make intercession upon the ignorance of the people now that's the one I'm depending on he still was covered with bleach the bleach of the forgiveness of sin John looked at the lamb the lamb looked like he had been slain and then he noticed he was wounded cut bruised and bleeding a bloody lamb that's what took our place isn't it strange a simple lamb had to take our place he saw the lamb he proceeded out John hadn't saw him because he had been way back into the eternities even making intercession and showing that those who had come to God under the offering of the blood of bulls and and of goats a substitutionary offering cuz then he believed it it pointed to him and the blood had not been shed yet so he was there to clear them he was there to clear you and I and oh God I hope he is there tonight for every sinner the lamb been slain how can Jehovah see anything but the bloody lamb standing there and the lamb proceeded out into the vision now as it had been slain notice he come from the father's Throne oh think where did he advance from to this Vision he come from Glory where he's seated at the right hand of God he Advanced forth to John out of Glory oh would not it be a glorious thing if our sinful thoughts tonight could be laid aside long enough to accept him and he would Advance all the way from Glory tonight to make himself known to any of you now isn't that nice to know that he will leave the throne tonight today whatever hour to make himself known to you he's seated at the right hand but he leaves the throne to take the book he leaves the throne to bring the re Revelation in 1963 he leaves the throne every time a sinner comes to Christ he comes to the throne he'll meet you to reveal himself to you and what is he revealing to you his word his book what book is it it's the book of redemption that's our rights to this morning so he took the book now we can take the book we can take back all that God has restored back back to us because this word is a word of restoration it brings us back to what Adam lost the same Authority the same power the same life now we have to believe that we have to believe that in order for it to work for us we believe that God has called us to it he gives us that Authority you know and it's like you know I won't I don't want to stand in the way of someone who has the faith to speak to the storm maybe I can't or maybe I don't have the faith that Enoch had but what if someone did have that Faith what if someone is preaching that faith and instead of being a hater let them go if they're happy let them go they believe they can have all of their family saved and you just think well some of mine's a serpent seed well you keep your unbelief to yourself you know if you believe some of your family serpent seed that's on you but if I'm a Believer I don't believe there's no serpent seed there then I can claim that and that's what that's what you know you know it's like amen keep your unbelief to yourself you know you come in and you you're you're trying to claim a promise for healing and then someone comes up and say you know there's no answer for that you know you got to go on you know you got to do with the do hey you know what you know you should keep your unbelief to yourself you know if if it's not going to happen for him let God reveal to him it's not going to happen to him but you shouldn't be the bearer of bad news you should be the bearer of good news somebody believe that's going in the Rapture somebody believe they're not going to taste death why would I be well you know what you're looking like you about to die now what kind of what kind of person would I be just a pure hater keep your unbelief to yourself you say you a brother comeing you I see this God has this for me God has that for me God has this for me you talk to one of them old Saints they be like I don't see that at all you tell them man keep it to yourself keep your unbelief to yourself you know it's the book of life it's the book of Redemption on those that receive it now we don't all come to maturity the same way things I'm seeing today I didn't see a few years ago five years ago 10 years ago and so you catch up with your friends you're like I don't see that brother isra I don't think it applies that way well that's on you yes but this book is a book about my life is that right it's opening up to my life love reading about Moses John the Baptist is one of my favorite characters love reading about Elijah I love reading about the Hebrew boys and Daniel and the Lion's Den and Noah and then and in the ark and then Israel crossing over the Red Sea Joshua fit the battle and all the great promises but what about my battles what about my victories what about how he set me free he didn't set me free with some abstract word he set me free with this word and this is the book of life not just the book of any life it's the book of my life let me read this quote here and I'll let you go all right it's in it's in I just have to quote it to you brother brandham says it let's see if I can find it here quickly it's in Revelations chapter 5 says he says that you are sealed with the book if you can find that you're sealed your name you are sealed in the book the book was sealed with Seven Seals and you're sealed with the book he says that beautiful I don't have it here take my word for it there it is maybe it is now this book was sealed with Seven Seals now it was the Bible it was sealed with Seven Seals and now watch how it was done no that's not that's not the quote it's it's it's another one we'll get it to you another time but you are sealed until the day of your Redemption you know the scripture Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed unto when the day of what
