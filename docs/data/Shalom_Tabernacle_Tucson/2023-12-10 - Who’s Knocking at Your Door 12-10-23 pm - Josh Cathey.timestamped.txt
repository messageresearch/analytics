[34:25] want to go ahead and make ready for us
[34:26] this
[34:47] evening amen somebody say praise the
[34:50] Lord
[34:51] tonight amen I wanted to sing a song but
[34:54] before we did just say a little
[34:55] something about this song this
[34:57] song is a question who am I and just
[35:01] after the tape that we're listening to
[35:04] this morning I just don't want there to
[35:06] be anything that's a stumbling block to
[35:09] somebody as we are as we are singing
[35:13] this so just a couple things along those
[35:15] lines um so these are just a couple
[35:19] quotes one that uh brother brandom said
[35:22] there's not a person living but would
[35:25] like to look past over the C of times of
[35:27] where did I come from who am I where am
[35:30] I going of all the fine books that's
[35:32] been read the Great Master selections
[35:35] that's been made there's only one book
[35:37] that reveals who you are where you come
[35:39] from and where you're going that's it
[35:42] and then we heard this morning in the
[35:44] first
[35:44] seal and he says I hope the church truly
[35:48] understands it what I mean you people
[35:50] I'm I'm going to call you bride see so
[35:53] we're singing this song Who Am I it's
[35:55] like well weren't you listening this
[35:56] morning morning and um so then later
[35:59] that year this is from a the message is
[36:03] your life worthy of the Gospel after he
[36:05] preached the first seal he's talking
[36:07] about Jesus in his humility he says look
[36:09] at Jesus talk about us humbling
[36:12] ourselves when God himself became a baby
[36:15] instead of coming in a little crib
[36:17] somewhere in a decent home was born out
[36:20] there over a manure Pile in a stable
[36:23] amongst balling calves they wrapped him
[36:26] in swaddling clothes was off the neck of
[36:28] a yoke of an ox the poorest of the
[36:31] poorest and yet the creator of heavens
[36:33] and earth one cold rainy night they said
[36:37] Master we'll go home with you he said
[36:39] the foxes have holes the birds have
[36:41] nests but I don't even have a place to
[36:43] lay my head he says god Jehovah humbled
[36:47] himself and became a man represented in
[36:50] sinful flesh to redeem you and me who
[36:52] are we then he was our example who am I
[36:57] nothing so as we sing this tonight it's
[36:59] not that we don't know who we are but
[37:01] it's like Lord why me why did you do
[37:04] this for me Lord It's is Amazing Grace
[37:07] and that's what I just want to sing
[37:09] about tonight is that amazing
[37:11] grace that he's letting us know who we
[37:14] are where we're going and we're going to
[37:17] thank him the whole way Lord thank you
[37:18] for your Amazing
[37:21] Grace well when I
[37:25] think of how he
[37:28] came so far from
[37:33] [Music]
[37:35] Glory he came and
[37:37] dwelt among the
[37:42] lonely such as
[37:47] I to suffer
[37:50] shame and such
[37:53] disgrace and on Mount C
[37:57] R take my
[38:01] place and then I
[38:04] ask
[38:06] myself this
[38:09] question Lord who am
[38:14] I oh who am
[38:18] I that king would bleed and die
[38:25] for
[38:28] who am I that he would
[38:33] pray not my will thine
[38:39] Lord the
[38:41] answer I may never
[38:47] know just why he
[38:50] ever loved me
[38:54] so and to an Old Rugged Cross he would
[39:01] go for who am
[39:07] I and when I'm
[39:11] reminded of his
[39:13] words I'll leave you
[39:19] never if you'll be
[39:22] true I'll give to
[39:25] you life
[39:29] forever and
[39:31] ever I wonder
[39:35] what I could have
[39:38] done to
[39:42] deserve God's only
[39:46] son he'll fight my
[39:50] battles until they
[39:52] one for who am I
[40:01] who am
[40:04] I that a king would
[40:08] bleed and die
[40:13] for oh who am I that he would
[40:21] pray not my will thine
[40:25] Force
[40:27] the
[40:29] answer
[40:31] I I may never

[45:39] seated so this
[45:42] scripture brother brandom he refers to
[45:44] this scripture in a few different ways
[45:46] through the tapes he calls it one of the
[45:49] saddest pictures in the entire Bible he
[45:52] also calls it a pitiful thing you think
[45:56] about th this picture right here is is
[45:59] up there with some of the it's up there
[46:00] with him hanging on the cross that
[46:02] picture it is one of the saddest
[46:04] pictures he says in the entire Bible
[46:08] said behold I stand and knock and I I
[46:10] have a hard time believe can you believe
[46:11] that we serve a God that no matter what
[46:14] we've done how far we went that he he
[46:17] will still stand and knock at our
[46:19] heart's door that he will still continue
[46:22] to be there for us Time After Time and I
[46:26] have a a story I'd like to tell you it
[46:28] kind of reminded me of it the other day
[46:30] I was playing with Nolan in the floor
[46:33] and I think there was a stack of pillows
[46:34] right there and he had rolled over and
[46:37] as he was rolling over he was about to
[46:39] fall and bust his head so I reached out
[46:41] and I put my hand there and I softened
[46:43] his blow you know I caught him I caught
[46:45] him in his time of trouble coming down
[46:48] and then next thing I know that big old
[46:49] fat foot comes around and kicks me right
[46:51] in the face right after I catch him so I
[46:53] thought that might be a a billion of how
[46:56] the Lord feels with us sometimes he's
[46:58] there to soften our blow he's there to
[47:00] catch us when we fall and the next thing
[47:02] you know we're right back at it we're
[47:04] right back doing the same exact thing
[47:06] sometimes I have a it's a very familiar
[47:09] quote here it's in Ador and Ador in 63
[47:12] February 23rd it says now I can't think
[47:15] of the artist that painted this picture
[47:17] of Jesus knocking at the door he's some
[47:19] Greek artist I just can't think of the
[47:21] man's name at the time but he had spent
[47:23] practically a lifetime painting this
[47:25] picture
[47:26] and you see before it can be hung in the
[47:28] Hall of Fame it has to go through the
[47:29] Hall of critics first any great picture
[47:32] must do that it must face the critics he
[47:34] said oh I wish I had the the something
[47:37] that it takes to throw that before this
[47:39] audience this morning do you realize
[47:41] Pentecostal people as we cool off that
[47:43] God has taken us through the Hall of
[47:45] critics
[47:46] today he says the church has to go
[47:48] through the Hall of critics before it
[47:50] can go in the Hall of Fame as a bride
[47:53] sure can you stand it are you ready to
[47:56] come up with the scripture and stand
[47:58] Gallant to your testimony in the love of
[48:00] Christ he said are you taking back going
[48:03] out with the world like the Bible said
[48:05] Deus forsaken me loving this present
[48:07] World there is where the church is
[48:09] standing today waited in the balance
[48:12] that's the reason becomes Leo deia he
[48:15] said this picture as the artist painted
[48:16] it when it went to the hall of critics
[48:19] they could find nothing wrong and
[48:21] finally a great critic came up and he
[48:23] said there is one thing wrong with your
[48:26] picture he said it's true Jesus with the
[48:28] lantern in his hand coming by night in
[48:30] the darkness of sin that's a good
[48:31] picture he said his expression with the
[48:34] expectations of somebody to come to the
[48:36] door when he's knocking said that's
[48:38] wonderful and the look upon his face as
[48:41] he is longing to hear from the inside
[48:43] but sir there is no latch on the door if
[48:47] he did come how could Jesus get in
[48:50] because there's no latch on the
[48:52] door oh said the artist I painted it
[48:55] thus
[48:56] for the latch is on the inside he said
[48:59] Jesus cannot come in just by his will
[49:02] it's got to be your will to let him in
[49:05] he said lo I stand at the door and knock
[49:07] If any man will hear my voice and come
[49:11] in let me in I will come in and will Su
[49:13] with him and he with me brother brandham
[49:16] said that's the picture we're looking at
[49:18] now he said what does a man knock on a
[49:20] door for what makes a man knock at a
[49:23] door he is trying to gain entrance he's
[49:25] trying to come in there maybe there is
[49:28] something he wants to talk to you about
[49:30] or maybe he wants to speak to you about
[49:31] some business or something or maybe he
[49:33] wants to give you something there is
[49:35] some reason or he wouldn't be knocking
[49:38] at the door and that would my title
[49:40] tonight would be who's knocking at your
[49:43] door so brother Brandon there speaking
[49:46] about a man knocking at a door to gain
[49:48] entrance the first thing I thought of
[49:50] when I heard that on the tape I thought
[49:52] of one of those exterminator guys one of
[49:54] those bug guys that they come by and
[49:55] they knock on your door and they want to
[49:56] exterminate your house for you they want
[49:58] to go around and spray and so those guys
[50:02] they they come to you and they have a
[50:03] plan they unveil a plan to you and now
[50:06] their plan that they unveil to you it's
[50:08] it's usually a quarterly plan it's
[50:10] usually we'll come back this day then
[50:12] three months later we'll come back then
[50:13] three months later but for me that
[50:16] that's the physical house for the
[50:17] spiritual house for my spiritual house I
[50:19] need a every day every second every hour
[50:22] plan and that is what Christ offers us
[50:24] when he's knocking at the door that's
[50:26] his offer he's not offering to come back
[50:28] quarterly and help out he's offering to
[50:30] be there every second of Our Lives to
[50:32] help out amen and people call they call
[50:35] Jesus the great physician and he is the
[50:37] great physician but that's not the only
[50:39] occupation that he holds in our life
[50:41] Jesus is a great exterminator too he
[50:44] comes to rid your home of those pests
[50:46] that you have he's here to exterminate
[50:49] our spiritual houses but that's not all
[50:50] he is he's he's the Builder of that
[50:52] house he's the architect of that house
[50:55] he's the Exterminator you know he he's
[50:57] all of it to our spiritual home but some
[51:00] things about
[51:01] exterminators what they like to do is
[51:03] they like to walk that property first
[51:04] they like to get a good idea where
[51:06] they're at and what they're going to see
[51:07] so when they walk the property they're
[51:10] looking for different things in the yard
[51:12] they they want to know how stuff is
[51:13] getting in and why it's getting in a
[51:15] pretty if you have ants in your yard if
[51:16] you have ant mounds here here here in
[51:18] the front and backyard there's a pretty
[51:20] that's a pretty good indication there
[51:22] might be some ants in the house or they
[51:24] might be trying to get in the house
[51:26] house and he'll walk around and he'll
[51:28] see a crack in the side of your home
[51:29] here or maybe in this certain spot it's
[51:31] not sealed well and then the the main
[51:34] thing the the biggest thing for pest
[51:36] being in your home is a weak
[51:39] Foundation but all these things all they
[51:41] are is wear and tear on the house from
[51:43] different storms the house has been
[51:45] through from different things that's
[51:47] been thrown at this home over and over
[51:50] again and the the foundation of a home
[51:53] it's it's a crucial part of the home and
[51:55] it's crucial to keep it without cracks
[51:58] to keep it free of pests and most of the
[52:00] time what coincides with that weak or
[52:02] crack Foundation is a pest
[52:05] infestation I got a couple of quotes I'd
[52:07] like to read about the foundation he
[52:08] says in the stature of a perfect man he
[52:10] says notice you must be born again he
[52:14] says and when you're born again you
[52:16] can't be born again without having faith
[52:19] that's right so you see on my chart here
[52:21] I got the very Foundation faith is the
[52:24] foundation of all of it for without
[52:27] faith it's impossible to please God he
[52:29] that cometh to God now he don't say he
[52:32] said he that cometh to God he don't say
[52:34] maybe they got to do this he that he
[52:36] that cometh to God uh this might be the
[52:38] right way to go he said he that cometh
[52:40] to God must believe that he is and a
[52:44] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[52:47] him he doesn't leave any wiggle room
[52:49] right there they they must believe this
[52:52] and then again in the Statue of a
[52:54] perfect man he says so you you must have
[52:55] faith for a foundation he said all
[52:59] Christianity all you are all you'll ever
[53:02] be is based upon faith in the word
[53:05] that's the reason I believe the word see
[53:08] the stronger the foundation the stronger
[53:10] the home will stand the less pest that
[53:12] you will have in that home the less that
[53:15] you the less the exterminator will have
[53:17] to do the less work he'll have to do now
[53:21] you'll always know when the
[53:21] exterminators come too because when he
[53:23] starts spraying on the outside the
[53:25] things on the inside start shifting
[53:27] things start moving around you know you
[53:29] get Justified you get Sanctified things
[53:31] start moving around there's changes that
[53:34] start happening the inside starts moving
[53:36] around a little bit and then sometimes
[53:39] the Exterminator he's been before he's
[53:41] been to your home but you didn't follow
[53:43] his guidelines of how to keep your home
[53:46] pest free yeah he's been he sprayed but
[53:49] and he gave you guidelines on how to
[53:51] keep it pest free but sometimes we
[53:53] ignore those guidelines sometimes we
[53:56] look past them we don't think anything
[53:58] about you know in the I don't know if
[53:59] you do it here but where I grew up in
[54:02] Arkansas you know if we had some
[54:03] leftovers in the fridge and we don't
[54:04] want them no more we just walk out on
[54:05] the back porch and fling them in the
[54:08] yard that's a pretty good way to get
[54:10] some pests in your yard get some
[54:12] raccoons around there get get all kind
[54:14] of stuff in your backyard but what do
[54:16] you expect you're attracting them what
[54:19] you're doing is causing them to come
[54:20] into your yard and then they're going to
[54:22] figure out pretty soon that this this
[54:24] food that keep showing up right here
[54:26] it's coming from in that house and
[54:28] they're going to think well if I could
[54:29] just get in that
[54:30] house how much better off would I be
[54:33] amen but you're not ever going to fool
[54:35] him either the Exterminator he's a
[54:39] professional he walks in and if he sees
[54:41] bugs and different things that attracts
[54:43] the bugs he knows what he's looking at
[54:45] he's been there before he's experienced
[54:48] but him being experienced and him being
[54:51] there before that's good news for us
[54:54] because the biggest lie that the enemy
[54:56] will tell you is that you're alone in
[54:58] whatever you're going through he'll tell
[55:00] you this is never this has never been
[55:02] conquered before this has never been
[55:04] beaten before and you're not going to
[55:06] beat this that's what he'll love to tell
[55:08] you so the Exterminator experience that
[55:11] he's seen this before is actually a good
[55:12] thing because then you know this has
[55:15] been beaten before this has been
[55:17] conquered before it's it's the same old
[55:19] bug he's exterminated before and when
[55:22] Christ comes into our house and sees
[55:24] these things inside of us he looks at
[55:27] and he says that's no bit that's the
[55:29] same old sin that's the same old demon
[55:32] that I've exterminated
[55:34] before and it's not it only seems like a
[55:36] problem to us sometimes because those
[55:38] lies those little lies in our ears we
[55:40] start buying in but that's all they are
[55:42] is lies they're
[55:45] Bluffs then after struggling with these
[55:48] different pests one of the biggest
[55:49] mistakes that someone can make is not
[55:52] accepting the Exterminator help that's
[55:54] true saying come back again it's not a
[55:57] good time for me I've had a you know
[55:59] maybe come on a Friday afternoon that
[56:00] you don't want to deal with you've had a
[56:02] long work week and you're not you're not
[56:04] looking at dealing with that you're you
[56:05] want to go sit on the couch you want to
[56:07] relax but that's the biggest mistake you
[56:09] can make brother brandom always talked
[56:11] about it happens at an unexpected time
[56:14] maybe it's you comeing to church one
[56:16] night and you you've been on autopilot
[56:18] you're going to church you're going
[56:19] Wednesday night you're going Sunday
[56:21] morning Sunday night but you're really
[56:23] on autopilot just cruising along there
[56:27] and that's the unexpected time that it
[56:28] happens at just cuz you don't don't
[56:31] don't rely to always feel good and then
[56:33] get blessed you're probably going to
[56:35] feel bad and then get blessed is
[56:37] probably what's going to
[56:39] happen but the Exterminator he's got a
[56:41] business and a lot of the time he's more
[56:44] willing to accept your business than you
[56:46] are to give
[56:47] it he's more willing to accept it and it
[56:50] reminds me a story of that soldier that
[56:52] brother Brandon would talk about the one
[56:54] that I believe believe he had the one
[56:56] with the pardon I believe he had left
[56:58] the uh the Battlefront or he had left
[57:00] the battle and then they had thrown him
[57:02] in prison for that he was a guilty man
[57:06] and his friend had heard of it and I I
[57:08] like to focus on that mediator the
[57:10] friend right there in the middle to me
[57:12] in that story that's Christ for
[57:15] us his friend could not stand it that he
[57:18] was in prison that he was in these
[57:20] chains of bondage even though he was
[57:22] guilty he was completely guilty he had
[57:25] done he he had done the thing that got
[57:27] him there he he was completely guilty
[57:30] but his friend could not stand to see
[57:32] him there so what his friend does is
[57:35] goes and sees him and then he goes and
[57:37] finds Abraham Lincoln can you imagine a
[57:40] struggle that he went through to get to
[57:41] the president of the United States makes
[57:44] me think of the struggle that Christ
[57:45] went
[57:46] through carrying that cross up to
[57:48] Calvary hanging on that cross those
[57:51] Nails piercing his
[57:53] flesh all these things to think about
[57:57] all these things he went through just
[57:59] for
[58:00] us he had love in his heart thinking to
[58:03] me while doing that just for me just for
[58:07] you amen and it's the same with that
[58:10] mediator in the story he loved his
[58:11] friend he didn't want to see his friend
[58:14] die he loved him so he went and found
[58:16] the president and he got that pardon in
[58:19] his hand and can you imagine how happy
[58:21] he was going back to his friend with the
[58:23] pardon in his hand
[58:26] can you
[58:27] imagine how joyous it is to the Lord
[58:29] coming to us with the pardon in his hand
[58:32] and saying this is free you can have
[58:35] this what that must feel like for him
[58:38] how how happy he was through his love
[58:40] that he could die for us so that we
[58:42] could have that pardon but then you go a
[58:45] little bit further and the man got there
[58:47] and his friend wouldn't accept a pardon
[58:50] he wouldn't take
[58:51] it can you imagine how that made the man
[58:54] feel that went and got that that went
[58:56] and struggled that who knows what he
[58:58] went
[58:59] through there was a slap in the face to
[59:02] him he went spent all that time through
[59:05] love to get that pardon and then the man
[59:08] rejected it but let's say we did accept
[59:11] his health brother brandom it's a door
[59:14] to the heart in
[59:16] 58 he says but you might say to me
[59:18] brother brandom I've already did that
[59:21] when Jesus knocked at my heart I let him
[59:23] in he said well that's good but when he
[59:26] come into your heart did you welcome him
[59:28] to your entire being he said there's
[59:30] many people excuse me there's many
[59:34] people that will welcome Jesus in as
[59:35] Savior but can he be your lord and Lord
[59:40] is
[59:42] ownership now you think about this if
[59:44] you had cash and you just you just went
[59:46] to a dealer and you just bought a car
[59:47] outright just cash money you just laid
[59:49] it down that car is yours when you drive
[59:51] it all to lot when you own a car you
[59:53] don't just own the engine and the tires
[59:55] you own all of that car every bit of
[59:57] every inch of that car is
[1:00:00] yours that car now now you can paint it
[1:00:03] how you want to you can put different
[1:00:05] tires on it you can put different
[1:00:07] headlights in it that car is yours it
[1:00:09] belongs to you you have ownership of
[1:00:10] that car that car is subject to your
[1:00:15] will and that's how we have to be with
[1:00:17] Christ we have to be subject to his will
[1:00:20] it has to be
[1:00:22] ownership he goes on he says the Lord
[1:00:24] has complete control you would plenty
[1:00:26] welcome him to keep you out of hell and
[1:00:28] torment says you would welcome him as
[1:00:31] your savior but are you willing to
[1:00:33] welcome him as your lord to take over
[1:00:34] full control in the heart there is
[1:00:37] little doors like in your house if I
[1:00:38] come to your house to visit you and you
[1:00:40] welcome me in and said brother brandom I
[1:00:42] give to you this house and all that's
[1:00:43] within it but then you take me by the
[1:00:46] hand and say you see this door I don't
[1:00:47] want you going in there and you see this
[1:00:49] place now don't go in there and this
[1:00:51] place don't go in there then I'm just
[1:00:53] partially welcome
[1:00:56] says and that's the way people usually
[1:00:58] receive the Lord Jesus as partially
[1:01:00] welcome but he wants to come in and be
[1:01:03] welcome now let's examine some of these
[1:01:05] doors one of them is a little door self
[1:01:09] you know that's an important little door
[1:01:10] you say oh yes Jesus I'll receive you as
[1:01:12] my savior but now don't meddle in my
[1:01:14] business says that's the attitude of
[1:01:17] lots of Christians soall now now I want
[1:01:21] to live my own life but I don't want you
[1:01:24] I want you to keep me from hell he said
[1:01:27] but don't meddle in my
[1:01:29] Affairs well then Jesus can't have the
[1:01:32] preeminence and now when he said Affairs
[1:01:34] he didn't he didn't say sinful
[1:01:36] Affairs you know just because something
[1:01:40] isn't sinful in essence doesn't mean
[1:01:42] that we can't make it sinful to
[1:01:45] ourselves it's about priorities if
[1:01:48] Christ isn't the number one priority
[1:01:50] then whatever's above him it's that's an
[1:01:53] idol to us
[1:01:56] that's not correct he has to be the
[1:01:58] number one priority in our lives at all
[1:02:01] times these say no matter what the hobby
[1:02:03] it you think of maybe it's watching a
[1:02:06] watching a football game maybe it's
[1:02:07] going to a football game maybe it's
[1:02:09] going and doing something some hobby you
[1:02:12] have and now maybe you feel an unction
[1:02:15] to go get on your knees and pray or
[1:02:17] maybe to get in the scripture maybe
[1:02:19] listen to a tape getting the word but
[1:02:21] then you also feel that same function to
[1:02:23] go do that Hobby
[1:02:25] right and now when you choose that hobby
[1:02:28] you you say well maybe going and going
[1:02:30] and watching a game that's harmless but
[1:02:32] when you start choosing that harmless
[1:02:34] hobby over what the Lord's put on your
[1:02:37] heart to do it stops being so harmless
[1:02:40] at that
[1:02:41] point it starts causing more harm than
[1:02:43] it does good and then it snowballs and
[1:02:46] it continues and
[1:02:48] continues now the prophet said that's
[1:02:50] the attitude of lots of so-called
[1:02:52] Christians you know once we let him in
[1:02:56] in our house that doesn't mean it's over
[1:02:57] just yet you know those things that got
[1:02:59] kicked out they'll eventually want their
[1:03:02] home back can we turn to Matthew chapter
[1:03:05] 12 just real
[1:03:07] quick
[1:03:09] verses 43-
[1:03:23] 45
[1:03:27] verse 43 says when the unclean spirit is
[1:03:29] gone out of a man he walketh through Dry
[1:03:32] places seeking rest and findeth none
[1:03:35] then he saith I will return into my
[1:03:36] house from when I came out and when he
[1:03:39] has come he findeth it empty swept and
[1:03:41] garnished then goeth he and taketh with
[1:03:44] himself seven other Spirits more wicked
[1:03:47] than himself and they enter in and they
[1:03:49] dwell there and the last state of that
[1:03:52] man is worse than the first
[1:03:54] even so shall it be also unto this
[1:03:57] wicked generation brother brandham says
[1:04:00] if you don't have the good man of the
[1:04:02] house standing there which is your faith
[1:04:05] protecting that door they'll come right
[1:04:07] in after they've been kicked out I
[1:04:10] believe he says in demonology somewhere
[1:04:12] he says as Faith kills it unbelief
[1:04:16] resurrects
[1:04:17] it you know the enemy when you whether
[1:04:20] it's a filling or a refilling yeah the
[1:04:24] enemy had you whether it's either one of
[1:04:26] those he had you in something that's why
[1:04:28] you're seeking the Lord on these
[1:04:30] matters once he's gone and he ain't got
[1:04:33] you more in that spot he wants to get
[1:04:34] you back into that spot so he's going to
[1:04:37] push and push he's going to try and
[1:04:39] break that door down so he can get you
[1:04:41] back in that same exact thing you were
[1:04:43] in bondage over to begin
[1:04:45] with and that's when it takes some Faith
[1:04:48] that's when it takes the strong
[1:04:50] Foundation you've accepted the helper
[1:04:52] now let him help amen so now when he
[1:04:55] comes in and starts working don't follow
[1:04:57] him around and lock some doors as a
[1:04:59] quote said don't don't say no stay out
[1:05:01] of this room stay out of that room don't
[1:05:03] protect the stuff you want him to
[1:05:05] actually get rid of he can't do his job
[1:05:08] right an exterminator you think if you
[1:05:10] follow an exterminator around your house
[1:05:13] you say oh no sir I'm going to keep this
[1:05:14] shut I'm going to this closet over here
[1:05:16] I'm going to keep it shut that could be
[1:05:17] the room that the pest are getting in
[1:05:19] from that's how they're getting in your
[1:05:21] house in the first place and you just
[1:05:22] shut them out of that
[1:05:24] amen he can't do his job correctly he
[1:05:27] can't actually help you in that
[1:05:30] case some rooms haven't been cleaned in
[1:05:32] years I'm sure all of ours have been
[1:05:33] cleaned within the last few years but
[1:05:36] some some people's house some rooms
[1:05:38] ain't been cleaned in years but in that
[1:05:40] room it'll have the most dust and bugs
[1:05:43] and you know things you don't want to be
[1:05:45] around in it and in some rooms are very
[1:05:49] personal you know that sometimes I
[1:05:51] remember when I was real little my my
[1:05:53] parents they would would watch something
[1:05:55] it was called hoarders it was a TV show
[1:05:57] called hoarders and it was these people
[1:06:00] it was almost like a like a a drug
[1:06:03] addiction but it they would treat it
[1:06:05] like an intervention like their families
[1:06:07] would go to their house and they'd get
[1:06:08] these they'd call somebody and they'd be
[1:06:10] big camera crew show up and they would
[1:06:12] show these people's houses and there
[1:06:14] would be stuff stacked to the ceiling
[1:06:17] they had like a path like a a twot wide
[1:06:20] path you could get through their house
[1:06:21] and they had just a bunch of useless
[1:06:24] stuff a bunch of baggage they didn't
[1:06:27] need up to the ceiling and sometimes our
[1:06:30] spiritual houses can get like that we
[1:06:32] can become spiritual
[1:06:33] hoarders we can hold on to things too
[1:06:36] long that's right hold on to things we
[1:06:38] don't need when all you got to do is
[1:06:40] toss it out the door it's as simple as
[1:06:43] that those people coming in were wanting
[1:06:45] to help them and most of the time on
[1:06:47] that show they refuse to help most of
[1:06:50] the time when their their family they
[1:06:52] would get somebody they they would do it
[1:06:53] for for free that they would come and
[1:06:56] they would unpack that house for them
[1:06:58] for free clean it out and they would
[1:07:00] still reject the help they still would
[1:07:02] not accept what those people wanted to
[1:07:04] do for
[1:07:05] them it gets stacked up so tall
[1:07:08] sometimes it's almost impossible to move
[1:07:10] it gets heavier and heavier brother
[1:07:13] brandham says in the door to the
[1:07:16] heart he says here Pride keeps us from
[1:07:19] doing it he said we're afraid somebody
[1:07:22] will say something against us when the
[1:07:24] spirit blesses many are ashamed to say
[1:07:27] Amen there is many who in their office
[1:07:30] work the Lord Jesus could have healed
[1:07:32] them of
[1:07:33] diseases and they're afraid to testify
[1:07:36] to the glory of God because of
[1:07:39] Pride says many are afraid to stand and
[1:07:41] say I have received Christ as my
[1:07:45] personal Savior and have been filled
[1:07:47] with the Holy Spirit
[1:07:50] ashamed sometimes we don't want to mess
[1:07:52] with our status and now at this point
[1:07:55] I'm talking about maybe in the office
[1:07:56] maybe on the job you don't want to mess
[1:07:59] with that picture of how somebody has
[1:08:00] you in their head cuz if you start
[1:08:02] becoming a Christian you start telling
[1:08:03] about Divine Healing you start telling
[1:08:05] about some of these other things you
[1:08:07] might turn into a freak pretty
[1:08:10] quick it might happen real
[1:08:13] fast but what are you trying to give
[1:08:15] them you're trying to give them healing
[1:08:17] what if you talk to them about salvation
[1:08:19] you might turn into a freak but what are
[1:08:21] you trying you're trying to give them
[1:08:22] Christ you're trying to show them
[1:08:24] Christ
[1:08:26] amen and it I I don't care about what
[1:08:29] they see I care about what God sees when
[1:08:31] he's looking at me does he see a servant
[1:08:33] trying to go help someone else or
[1:08:35] someone that's too ashamed someone
[1:08:37] because of Pride might be too scared to
[1:08:39] help another Soul that's lost to reach
[1:08:42] out and try and pull them
[1:08:43] in amen and we think of back to the
[1:08:47] house we think of these different sizes
[1:08:49] of these different
[1:08:50] rooms you know pride is a master bedroom
[1:08:54] if we had to give it a room in a house
[1:08:55] Pride it's a master bedroom but not
[1:08:58] everybody's house is the same you know
[1:09:00] Pride to me might be a master bedroom
[1:09:02] but to you may be a
[1:09:03] closet these things are bigger in our
[1:09:06] lives they take up more room in our
[1:09:09] house but the houses aren't built the
[1:09:11] same as we said earlier they have they
[1:09:13] haven't all been through the same storms
[1:09:15] seen the same
[1:09:17] things so coming out that master bedroom
[1:09:20] would be a master bathroom has two rooms
[1:09:23] connected to one
[1:09:24] another that would be shame in Proverbs
[1:09:28] 11:2 it says when Pride cometh then
[1:09:30] cometh shame it says but with the lowly
[1:09:34] is wisdom you know pride and shame those
[1:09:36] are door stoppers those are rooms that
[1:09:38] we get locked into sometimes shame is a
[1:09:41] room you get locked into and you are it
[1:09:44] the devil will shame you so much about
[1:09:46] something you've done in your life or
[1:09:48] about something you cannot conquer till
[1:09:50] you are too scared to take a step
[1:09:52] spiritually until you can't move until
[1:09:55] you're Frozen
[1:09:58] spiritually and but as we know it Satan
[1:10:00] he he he perverts everything anything
[1:10:03] God does he perverts
[1:10:05] it shame is just a perverted form of
[1:10:08] conviction in Satan's hands said the
[1:10:11] Lord uses conviction he doesn't use
[1:10:14] shame in that way and the difference
[1:10:16] that Shame Shame says that you are the
[1:10:20] mistake conviction says you've made a
[1:10:22] mistake
[1:10:25] the Lord doesn't call you the mistake
[1:10:27] Satan calls you the
[1:10:29] mistake
[1:10:31] amen and that conviction will just say
[1:10:33] that you made a mistake God's conviction
[1:10:36] in our life it says you made a
[1:10:39] mistake shame will push you farther away
[1:10:42] from the Lord conviction push pushes you
[1:10:45] towards the
[1:10:47] Lord and the two they can feel really
[1:10:50] similar in your life when they're
[1:10:52] working they can feel very similar
[1:10:54] conviction and shame
[1:10:56] can brother brandom talks about faith
[1:10:58] you know he spoke of Faith as a
[1:11:00] foundation but he also speaks of Faith
[1:11:03] as a door he says in a door to the heart
[1:11:06] he said then there's another little door
[1:11:08] in the heart oh there's many of them but
[1:11:10] I just want to hit some of the main ones
[1:11:12] another little door in the heart when
[1:11:14] Jesus comes in is the Door of Faith oh
[1:11:18] many will say I'll accept him as my
[1:11:21] personal savior but I don't believe all
[1:11:23] the words
[1:11:24] inspired says then you're keeping your
[1:11:26] door closed he can't bless you at
[1:11:29] all and you say oh I believe that he
[1:11:32] saves me from sin but I just can't
[1:11:34] believe that the days of Miracles are
[1:11:36] the same today as they were then then
[1:11:40] you're keeping the door closed he can't
[1:11:42] do a thing for you it's like saying I'm
[1:11:45] a message believer but I don't know if
[1:11:47] all the message was inspired I don't
[1:11:49] know if it's all the truth and now the
[1:11:51] prophet says if that's the way it is he
[1:11:54] can't bless you at all that's right this
[1:11:57] healing we hear about on the tapes what
[1:11:59] the prophet tells us to be the truth he
[1:12:02] can't do a thing for you he
[1:12:05] says brother brandham says if that's how
[1:12:07] you're feeling you're keeping your door
[1:12:09] closed but it's it's by your actions
[1:12:11] it's by your fruits we can say all day
[1:12:14] that we believe this word that we
[1:12:15] believe what the tapes say that we
[1:12:17] believe what the scripture says but we
[1:12:19] have to live this word we have to live
[1:12:23] what we believe it's saying
[1:12:25] amen there's a saying that says talk is
[1:12:28] cheap you know you have to live it you
[1:12:31] can say all day I'm a Christian but if
[1:12:33] none of those fruits if none if if your
[1:12:35] life doesn't reflect that Christ has to
[1:12:38] reflect in our lives each one of us this
[1:12:42] word that we're saying that we believe
[1:12:44] we have to be a reflector of it how will
[1:12:47] others ever see it that's true how will
[1:12:49] anybody else we may be the only Bible
[1:12:51] some people see right in their whole
[1:12:55] life we are physical manifestations of
[1:12:59] of what Christ wants in this day we his
[1:13:01] hands and his
[1:13:03] feet we have to show people what this
[1:13:06] scripture is PE people have seen I've
[1:13:08] heard countless times people I've worked
[1:13:09] with they I ask them why are you not in
[1:13:12] church anymore because we'll get to
[1:13:13] talking and they'll tell me because of a
[1:13:15] bad experience they've had in church of
[1:13:17] something that happened to them
[1:13:19] something that one of the brothers said
[1:13:20] one of the sisters said what their
[1:13:22] Pastor did but they got to understand
[1:13:25] they were not living that they were they
[1:13:28] were not they were not trying to be what
[1:13:30] the word says they're supposed to be
[1:13:32] I've heard that so much from people that
[1:13:34] that's probably the number one I'll call
[1:13:36] it I don't I'll call it an excuse of why
[1:13:38] people will not attend church in the
[1:13:41] world yeah is because of that right
[1:13:44] there they've seen so much bad on the
[1:13:45] inside they're they're scared to go
[1:13:50] back and our faith it's not about how we
[1:13:53] feel
[1:13:54] either not at all it rests on the
[1:13:57] Promises of God not the lies of the
[1:13:59] enemy our faith does you know feelings
[1:14:03] feelings has gotten the church message
[1:14:06] churches churches out there in a lot of
[1:14:09] trouble there's Methodist churches that
[1:14:11] are letting homosexuals get up and
[1:14:14] Minister they're letting different
[1:14:16] things like that in behind their pull
[1:14:18] pit because it feels right but if those
[1:14:21] feelings don't dovetail don't don't
[1:14:23] directly line up with the word of God we
[1:14:26] have to toss those feelings
[1:14:28] out they're okay feelings are okay but
[1:14:30] they have to align with the word of
[1:14:33] God
[1:14:35] Amen and speak to the Rock brother
[1:14:38] brandham says oh that just as soon as
[1:14:40] you have your first trial come in the
[1:14:42] meeting see the Holy Spirit go back out
[1:14:44] and have a tummy ache and say well maybe
[1:14:46] I never got healed shame on you surely
[1:14:49] you got healed if you believe it your
[1:14:52] feeling ings has nothing to do with it
[1:14:56] it's your faith is what we look at
[1:14:58] that's what God sees is your faith not
[1:15:01] your
[1:15:02] feelings he said Jesus never did say did
[1:15:05] you feel it he said did you believe it
[1:15:08] that's the
[1:15:09] idea excuse me and just as soon as that
[1:15:13] exterminator leaves we sometimes think
[1:15:15] that we're seeing more bugs than we saw
[1:15:18] before yeah sometimes they start running
[1:15:20] around and we think what nothing even
[1:15:22] happened
[1:15:23] he didn't even fix anything I got the
[1:15:25] same old problem I still had before but
[1:15:28] that's because of how pesticides work
[1:15:30] and exterminator uses pesticides and
[1:15:33] what they do is they stir the bugs up
[1:15:35] they get the bugs
[1:15:36] moving so it can look like they are more
[1:15:39] bugs actually than before but in reality
[1:15:42] all those bugs are doing are coming near
[1:15:44] the pesticide and dying
[1:15:46] off is that right they're coming near
[1:15:48] and dying off that pesticide is
[1:15:50] attracting those bugs in to kill it or
[1:15:52] push them them out of your
[1:15:54] home another door I'd like to speak of
[1:15:56] is a door of
[1:15:58] fear and to me that would be the
[1:16:00] basement
[1:16:01] door the door of that basement that's a
[1:16:04] door of fear in each of our hearts
[1:16:06] that's the dark basement that's where
[1:16:07] you keep all them things that you don't
[1:16:09] want up in your house all them things
[1:16:11] maybe some just ugly stuff you don't
[1:16:13] want in your house and there's usually a
[1:16:15] lot of bugs in them creepy crawly bugs
[1:16:17] in the basements but all the kinds of
[1:16:19] pests that are usually crawling around
[1:16:21] in our spiritual basement
[1:16:23] there's worry there's anxiety there's
[1:16:26] depressions over things and they're all
[1:16:29] crawling around down there in the dark
[1:16:30] and any chance they get they want to
[1:16:32] bust up through that basement door and
[1:16:34] get into that house and they want to
[1:16:36] start moving around they want to start
[1:16:37] trying to rule your life is what they
[1:16:39] want to try and do and all these pests
[1:16:41] they're coming in from the same crack in
[1:16:44] the foundation of that basement and
[1:16:45] that's
[1:16:46] doubt if faith is the foundation then
[1:16:49] doubt is the crack in that
[1:16:52] Foundation and all these other things
[1:16:54] they're just children of doubt they're
[1:16:55] just side effects things that come along
[1:16:57] with doubt worry anxiety depression
[1:16:59] they're all children of
[1:17:02] Doubt amen if if if our faith if my
[1:17:05] faith I'll say mine if my faith was
[1:17:07] strong enough I would never have to
[1:17:09] worry about worry again right or fear or
[1:17:13] doubt or anxiety
[1:17:15] depression amen but you know what fear
[1:17:17] is I heard
[1:17:19] a a famous quote one time is from a
[1:17:21] basketball player that what no Good
[1:17:23] Michael Jordan he said limits like fears
[1:17:26] are often Just an Illusion that's a
[1:17:29] quote that he would say he said limits
[1:17:31] like fears are often Just an Illusion
[1:17:33] and you know what what an illusion is at
[1:17:36] the root of it it's a
[1:17:38] lie it's phony that's right it's not
[1:17:41] true at the root of an illusion any any
[1:17:44] magician any of it it is a lie it's
[1:17:47] tricking you into thinking that
[1:17:49] something like that's actually happening
[1:17:51] but it's not
[1:17:54] brother brandham said in the way to have
[1:17:55] Fellowship he said that's the trouble
[1:17:58] with man tonight that's what the trouble
[1:18:00] with people tonight you're scared he
[1:18:02] said that's the biggest curse there is
[1:18:04] on the Full Gospel people or any other
[1:18:07] people is because they are
[1:18:09] afraid says God has made the provision
[1:18:12] but you're afraid to take his word for
[1:18:15] it if you was wasn't afraid tonight why
[1:18:18] you would take your healing by faith and
[1:18:20] know that God promised it and the thing
[1:18:23] would just go Plum away from
[1:18:25] you he said afraid scared and I've
[1:18:28] noticed it and that's the reason I'm
[1:18:30] such a believer in healing I know that
[1:18:33] if you can get away from that scare and
[1:18:35] get love in its place something's going
[1:18:38] to happen there's only two faculties
[1:18:40] that govern a human and one of them is
[1:18:42] Faith which bringeth results and the
[1:18:45] other is fear which has no value in it
[1:18:47] at all faith is of god fear is of the
[1:18:50] devil fear Makes You Weary
[1:18:53] fear makes you wonder and if I was going
[1:18:56] to die in the morning what good would it
[1:18:58] do me to get all stewed up about it what
[1:19:01] if I was going to be electrocuted in the
[1:19:03] morning and my life had to end tomorrow
[1:19:05] morning what good would that do me to
[1:19:07] worry about it well you say what good
[1:19:10] would it do to have faith faith can sign
[1:19:13] my
[1:19:14] pardon he said sure there's value in
[1:19:16] faith don't be weary don't be scared
[1:19:19] don't be upset just have faith and
[1:19:21] believe and the only way you can have
[1:19:24] faith you have to have love first for
[1:19:26] love produces faith for perfect love get
[1:19:29] it perfect love casts out all fear amen
[1:19:33] amen Psalm 34 says I sought the Lord and
[1:19:36] he heard me and delivered me from all my
[1:19:42] fears we have to realize though not
[1:19:44] everything that knocks on that front
[1:19:46] door is here to help it'll say I'm here
[1:19:48] to help but not everything that knocks
[1:19:50] on there is actually there to help who's
[1:19:52] our the story of the Trojan Horse with
[1:19:55] the Greek soldiers and the City of
[1:19:57] Troy so what happened there it was a
[1:19:59] giant wooden horse built by Greek
[1:20:01] soldiers they were on the outside of the
[1:20:02] city and the City of Troy was a waldof
[1:20:05] city and the Greek soldiers could not
[1:20:08] defeat the city of troit the the wall
[1:20:10] the
[1:20:11] door was the only thing that were saving
[1:20:14] those people in the city of troit and so
[1:20:16] they stayed inside their city but what
[1:20:18] the Greek soldiers did they built a
[1:20:20] giant wooden horse and they pushed it up
[1:20:23] to the front of the gate and what they
[1:20:24] had done is when they built the horse
[1:20:26] there was a bunch of soldiers inside of
[1:20:29] it and the people of Troy when they
[1:20:31] looked out they thought it was a peace
[1:20:32] offering they thought it was a sign that
[1:20:35] they had won the war that it was over
[1:20:38] and so what they did they didn't go out
[1:20:40] there and test it in any way they didn't
[1:20:42] go out there and knock on it see if
[1:20:43] anybody's inside of it they just
[1:20:45] welcomed it straight in they just
[1:20:47] brought the giant horse right inside the
[1:20:50] city and what they did right there is
[1:20:52] they they let the enemy in through
[1:20:56] deceit the enemy was so Sly and so
[1:20:59] subtle that he just snuck right in and
[1:21:01] when those those people in the city of
[1:21:03] Troy when they were sleeping that night
[1:21:05] the people broke out of that horse and
[1:21:07] overran the
[1:21:10] city the people of Troy open their door
[1:21:13] to the wrong
[1:21:14] thing it looked nice it looked like it
[1:21:18] could be something really nice maybe a
[1:21:19] monument in the city of a victory but it
[1:21:22] turned out to be their
[1:21:24] demise it turned out to harm them
[1:21:27] instead of help them 1 John 4:1 says
[1:21:30] beloved believe not every Spirit but try
[1:21:33] the spirits whether they are of God we
[1:21:36] must test these Spirits these things
[1:21:39] that we have the these spirits that we
[1:21:41] see on our phones that we see walking up
[1:21:43] and down the street they're we're in
[1:21:45] spiritual warfare today we're surrounded
[1:21:47] by it he wants to take you over
[1:21:50] spiritually cuz that's that's what's
[1:21:52] going to live eternally he don't care
[1:21:54] about this flesh I mean he likes to hurt
[1:21:55] it and harm it but he wants his Spirit
[1:21:59] flowing in you he don't want the Holy
[1:22:00] Spirit flowing in you that's right he
[1:22:03] don't want that at
[1:22:05] all but we got to be so careful he's
[1:22:08] became so subtle but after that
[1:22:10] exterminator comes you can expect behind
[1:22:12] him maybe a crooked salesman comes
[1:22:14] through maybe somebody's wanting to sell
[1:22:16] you something that it ain't the real
[1:22:18] deal now that Exterminator what he came
[1:22:20] and brought his Services they were the
[1:22:22] real
[1:22:23] they help you can see Improvement and
[1:22:25] you want him coming back I saw a story
[1:22:28] the other day it was in the San Diego
[1:22:31] newspaper and I just thought it it
[1:22:33] seemed like it went right along with
[1:22:35] this it said a man so this is a this is
[1:22:37] a man it's uh the owner of the home is
[1:22:41] his aunt and he was at home with his
[1:22:43] aunt this day and he said a man
[1:22:44] unexpectedly knocked on my aunt's door
[1:22:47] this month and presented an iPad with
[1:22:48] her name her birth date and address and
[1:22:51] the cost of her monthly home security
[1:22:53] bill so this man that showed up at her
[1:22:56] door he could tell her everything about
[1:22:58] herself he told her everything he knew
[1:23:00] it all and I thought it was kind of
[1:23:02] ironic that this was over the home
[1:23:04] security system in this
[1:23:06] story says he confirmed that she was
[1:23:09] still with her current alarm company and
[1:23:10] quickly asked if he could come inside to
[1:23:13] take a look at her situp the salesman
[1:23:15] said he was there to upgrade her system
[1:23:19] and lower her
[1:23:20] bill a that like the enemy he's always
[1:23:22] offering something better he's always
[1:23:25] offering that grass is greener on this
[1:23:26] side it's a little bit better over here
[1:23:28] this this ENT entertainment I have to
[1:23:30] show you it's a little bit better than
[1:23:32] kneeling in
[1:23:35] prayer says his friendly demeanor
[1:23:37] apparent knowledge of her account and
[1:23:39] the language of his offer led her to
[1:23:42] believe he worked for her existing
[1:23:44] provider says she's also a trusting
[1:23:46] person and this right here this next
[1:23:48] part this is the biggest mistake in my
[1:23:50] opinion that the lady made says she let
[1:23:52] him in and listened to what he had to
[1:23:55] say that was her biggest mistake that
[1:23:57] she made in this whole situation she
[1:23:59] didn't ask one question to him that it
[1:24:01] shows before he came in she she didn't
[1:24:04] she didn't dig a little deep and see if
[1:24:06] it was actually beneficial to her she
[1:24:08] just let him right in so he could talk a
[1:24:11] little bit
[1:24:12] longer after observing her current
[1:24:14] system the salesman was sure he could
[1:24:17] offer a better price and quoted her in
[1:24:19] amount that was about $10 cheaper
[1:24:21] despite including a new alarm panel and
[1:24:23] a doorbell camera says he had limited
[1:24:26] offers to give out however and could
[1:24:28] only guarantee the price if she signed
[1:24:31] right then he asked if there was
[1:24:34] somewhere they could sit down together
[1:24:35] and review the terms that's what the
[1:24:38] enemy like he likes to review the terms
[1:24:39] with you these terms that he thinks he
[1:24:42] has you on this sickness in your body
[1:24:44] these battles in your mind he likes to
[1:24:46] review these terms he wants to hear you
[1:24:48] confess these terms to him and talk
[1:24:51] about them he he wants to hear you brag
[1:24:53] on his handiwork all this stuff he's
[1:24:56] been working towards been been planning
[1:24:58] in your life for you he wants to review
[1:25:00] these terms he wants to hear you say it
[1:25:02] back to him a lot of the time confess
[1:25:04] how sick you are confess how bad off you
[1:25:06] are that's what he
[1:25:08] likes and then this right here this is
[1:25:11] where the the nephew comes in he says
[1:25:13] listening from the other room I stepped
[1:25:16] in and started asking questions isn't
[1:25:18] that just like that little that little
[1:25:20] small voice it'll step step in and it'll
[1:25:22] start asking those
[1:25:24] questions it'll say the the enemy will
[1:25:28] be saying you're sick but that still
[1:25:29] small voice says but you've been healed
[1:25:32] you ain't no
[1:25:34] more says as to exactly he worked for
[1:25:37] the man went on a complicated tangent of
[1:25:40] Lies deceit delusion that that's what
[1:25:42] the devil has a complicated tangent he's
[1:25:45] going to feed you a line of complicated
[1:25:47] tangent when you ask him what are you
[1:25:49] doing here and you start quoting that
[1:25:51] scripture to him that's what he's going
[1:25:53] to give you back he said about his
[1:25:55] company merged with my aunt's provider
[1:25:57] over a decade ago and now want to
[1:25:59] upgrade old customers we asked why her
[1:26:02] current company would allow him to do
[1:26:04] this but the salesman implied the two
[1:26:06] companies were working together handling
[1:26:08] different parts of the
[1:26:10] business after he insisted for a while
[1:26:13] longer that the deal had to be done
[1:26:15] today now here's their best decision and
[1:26:18] if you notice they made this decision
[1:26:20] together now when she let him in the
[1:26:22] door it was just her decision it was
[1:26:24] just her the nephew wasn't around that
[1:26:26] still Small Voice she she just let him
[1:26:28] in said we excuse the man from the house
[1:26:33] now they did that together so there's
[1:26:35] the difference right there says a Google
[1:26:38] search quickly revealed that his
[1:26:39] business had no remaining ties to her
[1:26:41] current provider despite his apparent
[1:26:44] knowledge of her account the man hadn't
[1:26:46] been offering an upgrade to her existing
[1:26:48] situp he was offering a different deal
[1:26:50] from a direct competitor
[1:26:53] so he it lied the whole time just got in
[1:26:56] the house it was his mission to get in
[1:26:59] the front door and then to Li his way to
[1:27:02] get in control of that house of
[1:27:05] security we must be so careful to test
[1:27:08] these things we never we never want to
[1:27:10] let something in that's going to push
[1:27:12] that Holy Spirit
[1:27:13] Away we don't want to grieve that holy
[1:27:15] spirit because we let something in that
[1:27:17] doesn't doesn't agree with it amen now
[1:27:20] brother brandham said he said if there's
[1:27:21] a question don't do it but when he says
[1:27:25] that that doesn't mean like if a brother
[1:27:28] is if he's questioning whether he should
[1:27:30] wear deodorant before church that
[1:27:31] morning that's not the kind of question
[1:27:33] we're talking about put the deodorant on
[1:27:35] brother that's wear it we're talking
[1:27:38] about scriptural stuff spiritual things
[1:27:41] amen the prophet said and believest thou
[1:27:44] this he said listen when Jesus leaves
[1:27:46] your house watch for sickness to come
[1:27:49] trouble heartaches disappointments don't
[1:27:51] you believe that when Jesus leaves your
[1:27:53] house trouble's coming in just as soon
[1:27:55] as he
[1:27:57] leaves but also that moment before you
[1:28:00] let Jesus in there's going to be quite a
[1:28:01] bit of trouble just like in war if
[1:28:05] there if if both the sides know of a
[1:28:07] stronghold that if either side they know
[1:28:10] if either one of them captures that
[1:28:12] stronghold then that war is
[1:28:14] over they they will they will command
[1:28:16] the rest of the
[1:28:18] war so when one side's approaching that
[1:28:21] stronghold
[1:28:22] the other side is going to unleash
[1:28:24] everything it has at that opposing side
[1:28:28] so that it may not reach it and that's
[1:28:30] exactly how the enemy does it when he
[1:28:32] knows you're getting close to that
[1:28:34] blessing when you have a service like
[1:28:35] this morning and he can see people
[1:28:38] blessed and see people moving forward
[1:28:40] and see people growing in the
[1:28:43] Lord just being refreshed in the Holy
[1:28:46] Spirit then he's going to send a barrage
[1:28:49] your way then Monday that that was
[1:28:52] Sunday Monday it's going to be serious
[1:28:55] you going have to put on your whole
[1:28:57] armor and you're going to have to walk
[1:28:59] through it but it's always worth it when
[1:29:02] you get out on the other side it is
[1:29:04] always worth it every single time that's
[1:29:07] right that's right but you can always
[1:29:10] expect once you let that Holy Spirit in
[1:29:11] the door Something Wicked will come
[1:29:13] knocking now also when we see a neighbor
[1:29:17] you know we just let the Exterminator
[1:29:18] come into our house when we see a
[1:29:19] brother or sister doing the same thing
[1:29:23] don't scoff at them for it you know we
[1:29:25] we just let the Exterminator come into
[1:29:27] our nasty bug ritten house to get the
[1:29:30] PED out so when you see somebody else
[1:29:32] doing the same thing that's right pray
[1:29:34] for them help them don't when they come
[1:29:36] down here don't think oh what did they
[1:29:38] do wrong don't think oh what kind of
[1:29:40] trouble are they in what kind of sin
[1:29:42] have they been hiding don't think that
[1:29:45] think I'm happy for that brother I'm
[1:29:47] happy for that sister amen because maybe
[1:29:50] you've watched him struggle for money
[1:29:52] and finally the thing you have been
[1:29:54] praying for happened and now when it
[1:29:56] happened we want to look at them like
[1:29:57] they're terrible like they've done
[1:29:59] something
[1:30:00] wrong but pray for him if that
[1:30:03] exterminator has exterminated your house
[1:30:05] you know what it's like so maybe even go
[1:30:07] over lend a hand give some advice some
[1:30:09] words of encouragement help them along
[1:30:12] because it's going to be so hard on them
[1:30:14] the enemy is going to be attacking them
[1:30:16] from the moment they get off their knees
[1:30:17] right there probably while they're on
[1:30:19] their knees
[1:30:20] amen
[1:30:22] right brother Brandon said and God being
[1:30:25] misunderstood he said and now there's
[1:30:26] many many times at this that people
[1:30:29] misjudge one another and it is a bad
[1:30:32] thing to do you say why she's got short
[1:30:34] hair she's wearing her dresses too short
[1:30:36] that that's not the Holy Spirit upon her
[1:30:39] don't do that don't do that that's not
[1:30:41] right you don't know what's in that
[1:30:43] woman's heart he said you don't know
[1:30:46] nothing about it you know that the Holy
[1:30:48] Spirit would make her conduct herself a
[1:30:49] little better now that may be true but
[1:30:52] I'll tell you as soon as soon as you and
[1:30:55] I let God do the judging of that and let
[1:30:58] you and I just pray for that person that
[1:31:00] God will show them the light that's like
[1:31:03] hindsight is 2020 we can all look back
[1:31:06] in our lives and we can clearly see what
[1:31:08] we should have done different in so many
[1:31:10] situations I notice sometimes we we have
[1:31:14] about 2010 Vision towards other Li
[1:31:16] others lives you know we can see it
[1:31:19] clear as day we can not or other
[1:31:21] churches
[1:31:22] other people in the message other
[1:31:24] beliefs in the message you know we got
[1:31:26] 2010 Vision when it comes to that we can
[1:31:29] see clearly and we can identify brother
[1:31:31] you're wrong here sister you're wrong
[1:31:33] here you should have done this different
[1:31:35] here but then when it comes to looking
[1:31:36] at our lives in the mirror when it's
[1:31:39] reflecting back and you're looking at it
[1:31:40] then we need bifocals all of a sudden
[1:31:43] then we need contacts we got to slap the
[1:31:46] contacts in put the bifocals on maybe
[1:31:47] get a magnifying glass maybe a telescope
[1:31:50] sometimes to identify in our lives
[1:31:53] what's going
[1:31:56] on I think a true Christian is honest
[1:31:58] with
[1:32:00] theirself I think God puts that in your
[1:32:02] heart I think that's part of growth as a
[1:32:03] Christian you learn how to be honest
[1:32:05] with yourself it's not always fun to
[1:32:07] face these sins or things in our life
[1:32:10] secret sins that besit us but you got to
[1:32:12] be honest about it true or else it will
[1:32:14] linger there and it will stay there
[1:32:16] forever as long as you'll let it those
[1:32:18] pests they will stay in your house and
[1:32:21] usually multi as long as you'll let them
[1:32:22] stay
[1:32:24] there but let's pray for one another be
[1:32:26] kind to one another this isn't a it's
[1:32:28] not a rat race to see who the best
[1:32:30] believer is you know I mean we're
[1:32:33] everybody you're running beside we're on
[1:32:35] the same team so let's let's join hands
[1:32:37] and run together if there's fast ones
[1:32:40] let them wait back with the slow ones
[1:32:42] carry them forward give them a helping
[1:32:44] hand now we strive for those things we
[1:32:47] want to do the best we can for the Lord
[1:32:50] but we don't leave others behind in the
[1:32:51] way wake of it we carry them with us as
[1:32:55] musicians come I'd like to read just one
[1:32:57] more quote it in the door in a
[1:33:10] door it says now that still little voice
[1:33:14] that knocks out your heart's
[1:33:17] door it might knock so many times till
[1:33:20] it may be very faint right now but let's
[1:33:23] just be honest just honest with God and
[1:33:25] ourselves for just one minute that
[1:33:28] little knock way down there that said I
[1:33:30] better curve my ways I'd better be
[1:33:32] different I'd better straighten up I
[1:33:34] know these things in me I know there's
[1:33:36] things in me I look here I examine my
[1:33:38] life with this word I see I'm wrong in
[1:33:41] many things look around see how good
[1:33:44] it's his goodness that knocks at the
[1:33:47] door he said no matter what you done how
[1:33:50] much we've sinned how much we've turned
[1:33:52] it away how much we said later on we'll
[1:33:54] do it he is still in the midst of All
[1:33:57] That
[1:33:59] Knocking he said and if any man or woman
[1:34:02] will just open your heart I'll come in
[1:34:04] and Su let's see what he wants this
[1:34:07] morning will you while we bow our heads
[1:34:09] now that is there a knock at your heart
[1:34:12] today is there something that's bothered
[1:34:15] you something that a struggle a
[1:34:17] Temptation well the Lord's on the other
[1:34:19] side of that door right he's wanting to
[1:34:21] come in and help he's wanting to come in
