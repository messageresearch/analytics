[21:52] thought did a wonderful job Sunday night
[21:54] and so enjoyed that been feasting on

[22:06] Brother Israel who was uh um leaving the
[22:10] West uh West Cape heading to Rwanda for

[22:24] y'all just keep praying for him if my
[22:26] math is right he's will have preached up
[22:29] to eight Services while he's been gone
[22:31] so um and it takes a lot out of you to
[22:34] do that so let's just keep the keep uh
[22:36] keep our pastor lifted up in prayer and
[22:39] he asked that we send you his greetings
[22:42] tonight so God bless you Matthew the
[22:44] 26th chapter and the 47th verse we'll
[22:49] read for a little text tonight Matthew
[22:55] 26:47 and when you got that say Amen am
[22:58] amen amen and while he yet spake Lo
[23:01] Judas one of the 12 came and with him a
[23:04] great multitude with swords and staves
[23:08] uh from the chief priests and Elders of
[23:10] the people now he that betrayed him gave
[23:13] them a sign saying whomsoever I shall
[23:16] kiss that same is he hold him fast and
[23:20] for withth he came to Jesus and said
[23:23] hail master and kissed him and Jesus
[23:25] said unto him friend wherefore art thou
[23:27] come
[23:28] then uh then came they and laid hands on
[23:32] Jesus and took him and behold one of
[23:35] them which were with Jesus stretched out
[23:37] his hand and Drew his sword and struck a
[23:40] servant of the high priest and smote off
[23:42] his ear well that Peter didn't play did
[23:45] he then said Jesus unto him put up thy
[23:49] again thy sword into his place for all
[23:52] they that take the sword Shall Perish
[23:55] with the sword thinkest thou that that I
[23:58] cannot now pray to my father and he
[24:01] shall presently give me more than 12
[24:04] Legions of angels but how then shall the
[24:07] scripture be fulfilled that thus that
[24:10] thus it must be amen and may the Lord
[24:14] add His blessings to the reading of the
[24:16] word and let's just bow our heads
[24:18] Heavenly Father we're so grateful to be
[24:20] back in the house of the Lord tonight
[24:23] we're grateful to be assembled with your
[24:26] your children with Believers with the
[24:28] purchase of your blood and Lord we ask
[24:32] oh God tonight that you would break to
[24:34] us the bread of life that you would Lord
[24:37] bless this service bless your people and
[24:40] and Lord bless your word to our hearts
[24:42] we pray and we commit it into your hands
[24:44] I ask you to watch over me and bind my
[24:46] lips before I would speak anything
[24:48] unpleasing to you and we commit it unto
[24:51] thee in the name of the Lord Jesus
[24:53] Christ we ask it amen and amen God bless
[24:56] you you may be seated did and I'll just
[24:59] take a little text tonight on the mirror
[25:01] of God's word the mirror of God's word
[25:05] and I come across this thinking and I
[25:07] believe it might have been brother
[25:10] clever on Sunday maybe Sunday morning
[25:13] and he was singing that song about
[25:15] 10,000 angels He could have called
[25:17] 10,000 angels wasn't it Sunday morning
[25:19] brother John and he could have called
[25:21] 10,000 angels and I began to think about
[25:24] what kind of character what kind of a
[25:27] man our lord Jesus must have
[25:31] been and to know that all power in
[25:35] heaven in Earth was given to him and to
[25:38] know that uh he could have easily called
[25:43] 10,000 angels and he could have easily
[25:46] not gone through the things that he went
[25:48] through but he went through those things
[25:51] for a purpose and there was such a
[25:54] beautiful character in Jesus that that
[25:58] he was able to do the things that should
[26:01] be done not just the things that he
[26:03] wanted to do and it's so striking to me
[26:07] how amazing is the Lord Jesus tonight
[26:11] amen this was not just some other man
[26:15] this was the almighty God tabernacled in
[26:19] the son of man is that right this wasn't
[26:22] just a man like me or you this was God
[26:25] made flesh and dwelling Among Us brother
[26:27] Chuck this was a special man this was a
[26:30] sinless man this was a man full of
[26:34] power and he was the creator of this
[26:37] Earth the Bible said all things were
[26:39] made by him is that right and and so he
[26:42] was the creator of this Earth but yet he
[26:45] was being rejected by his own creation
[26:48] can you think about that tonight Saints
[26:50] what if we went home tonight and and
[26:52] those of you that's got kids what if you
[26:54] went to your house tonight and your
[26:55] children were there and they and they
[26:57] told you Dad or Mom we we don't want you
[27:00] around here anymore you're you're not
[27:02] welcome in this house anymore you're not
[27:05] welcome to be here anymore you can't eat
[27:07] this food in this house anymore and and
[27:09] and and we're not going to listen to you
[27:11] tell us what to do anymore and and and
[27:13] we're actually actually going to punish
[27:15] you for trying to tell us the right
[27:17] things to do we're actually not going to
[27:19] listen to you and we're going to punish
[27:21] you and don't you even open your mouth
[27:23] anymore what if your kids said that to
[27:26] you now you would say you better go
[27:29] check that in mail and see whose address
[27:32] this is cu this house belongs to me and
[27:35] I'm going to do what I want to in this
[27:36] house and you better go look at them
[27:38] receipts and see who it is that bought
[27:40] all that food I bought that food I'm
[27:42] going to eat that food if I want to is
[27:45] that right Saints amen that's you and I
[27:48] but that's not what our Lord
[27:50] did amen he could have called 12 Legions
[27:54] of angels uh but where would we be
[27:57] tonight night if he had have done that
[27:59] where would you and I be if he' had took
[28:01] the easy way out that he could have done
[28:03] but he died for you and me is that the
[28:06] truth tonight Saints that's the gospel
[28:08] truth and there's a quote I don't know
[28:10] who wrote it but it says because we can
[28:13] do a thing does not necessarily mean
[28:15] that we must do that thing because we
[28:17] have the power to do something doesn't
[28:20] mean we must do it is that right and
[28:22] Jesus had all power in Heaven and Earth
[28:24] and he had but he had that beautiful
[28:27] character to know how to handle the
[28:29] power that he had amen and see character
[28:32] is what makes all the difference brother
[28:34] brand said power without character was
[28:37] satanic is that right but we know that
[28:40] the character is what makes a man to
[28:42] where he can handle the power that he's
[28:44] given and you see people that power when
[28:47] they come into power you find many
[28:49] people if they don't have that kind of
[28:51] Godly character that power will change
[28:54] them it'll make them into something that
[28:56] they didn't used to to be if you if you
[28:58] watch sometimes when a man uh is trying
[29:01] to be a police officer and and and you
[29:03] watch certain ones if you find a man
[29:05] that he's not he doesn't have a good
[29:06] character when he gets that badge in his
[29:09] hand it changes him doesn't it amen if
[29:12] you watch what happens to some people
[29:14] when they get promoted and they become a
[29:16] boss if they don't have a good character
[29:19] when they get that Authority it changes
[29:22] them it makes them something that it
[29:24] didn't used to be and I'll tell you uh
[29:27] if if don't have the character it'll
[29:29] make it go to their head if you watch
[29:31] people sometimes if they start to get a
[29:33] little bit of money if they don't have
[29:35] that character that money will change
[29:38] them is that right Saints and money will
[29:41] will change you power will change you
[29:43] Authority will change you but Jesus had
[29:45] this beautiful character that he knew
[29:47] how to handle that power that he had is
[29:51] that right and so we find many times
[29:54] that men can't handle the power that's
[29:58] given to them many men you'll find can't
[30:00] handle the power of being the head of
[30:02] their home even and you find many men if
[30:05] they're weak what they'll do is push off
[30:08] hard decisions that they should be
[30:10] making and they'll push them off on
[30:11] their wife because they have the power
[30:13] to do that and they'll let their wife
[30:15] make the decisions they should be making
[30:17] and then when it goes wrong they can
[30:18] blame their wife for
[30:21] it all
[30:24] right but but they they but many people
[30:27] can't handle being in a position of
[30:29] power or authority because they don't
[30:32] have the character to match the power
[30:34] they've been given and they can let it
[30:36] go to their head they had a saying when
[30:38] I was in retail brother Chuck they said
[30:41] the quickest way to fire somebody was
[30:43] promote them because if they wasn't
[30:45] ready for the promotion then then very
[30:48] soon they would do something to get
[30:50] themselves in trouble and they get fired
[30:52] for it and we saw it happen many many
[30:54] times I would watch people that one like
[30:56] store store of the Year and that store
[30:58] manager would win store of the year and
[31:00] and you'd find it 50% of those store
[31:02] managers wasn't around this time next
[31:04] year because they got to thinking they
[31:06] were something and they started making
[31:09] mistakes so people have to have the
[31:12] right kind of character before they can
[31:14] handle success or authority or money or
[31:17] power
[31:19] amen but the most powerful man that ever
[31:22] lived gave his
[31:25] life for people that did even love him
[31:28] back is that right is that our Lord
[31:31] tonight isn't he marvelous tonight's
[31:32] thing isn't God good to us tonight it's
[31:36] amazing what God did for us today and
[31:39] the most powerful man that ever lived
[31:41] lived for others and this wonderful
[31:44] character that he had he was riled upon
[31:46] but he riled not back they smoted him on
[31:48] the chicken he did nothing back to him
[31:50] yet he had power to lay his life down
[31:53] and he had power to pick it back up
[31:56] again but he let a Roman soldier spit in
[31:58] his face he he he he he endured mocking
[32:02] and shame and he did all of those things
[32:04] and he had the power not to have to do
[32:06] any of it but the character that was in
[32:09] him constrained him now I tell you
[32:11] Saints many people if they had that kind
[32:13] of power if somebody smoked them on
[32:15] their
[32:16] cheek
[32:19] poof they'd be
[32:21] gone is that right Saints but not this
[32:24] man amen because of this great character
[32:28] this great love that was that was for us
[32:30] is what kept Jesus nailed to the cross
[32:33] his great love is what led him to
[32:35] Calvary it wasn't it wasn't that he had
[32:37] to do it no one could make him do
[32:39] anything he had to become obedient to
[32:42] death amen because of the power that was
[32:46] in him and I'll tell you Saints could we
[32:48] allow oursel to be spat upon like him
[32:51] could we love our enemies like he loved
[32:53] can can we turn the other cheek like he
[32:55] turned the other cheek can we live our
[32:57] lives in service for others can can we
[32:59] give without expected
[33:02] return come on somebody see many times
[33:06] people want to do things but only if
[33:08] they'll be recognized for doing it they
[33:12] want to do but they want to be
[33:14] recognized for what they've done amen
[33:16] but the word tells us to do those things
[33:19] in secret and the father that seiz Us in
[33:21] secret will reward us openly but many
[33:24] times people only want to do something
[33:26] for the Lord if somebody else will see
[33:28] them doing something for the Lord and we
[33:30] will'll give them a pat on the back for
[33:32] doing it Saints if somebody Pats you on
[33:34] the back for doing it that was your
[33:37] reward is that right Saints you remember
[33:40] when they stood praying he said verily
[33:42] they have their reward everybody sees
[33:44] them amen but do your arms in secret and
[33:47] the Father which Sees In Secret will
[33:49] reward you openly is that what the
[33:51] gospel says and so we find it some
[33:54] people want to pat on the back and and
[33:55] and the Bible says that if you want
[33:57] recognition you have the reward already
[34:01] but we're laying up Treasures in Heaven
[34:04] Saints amen but this great love is what
[34:08] kept Him nailed to the cross now the
[34:09] Bible said he was in the world and the
[34:11] world was made by him and the world knew
[34:14] him not and he came to his own and his
[34:17] own received him not he made the world
[34:20] and he came to it and the world rejected
[34:22] him the very world that he created is
[34:25] that what the gospel say tonight and he
[34:28] had the power to call 10,000 angels but
[34:31] he forfeited that power to do what was
[34:33] right for you and I praise God tonight
[34:36] he gave up that power to do what's right
[34:39] for you and me tonight amen that's the
[34:42] gospel story he forfeited his rights to
[34:45] fulfill the scripture to redeem
[34:47] us he forfeited his rights to save all
[34:50] of us tonight thank you Lord amen he
[34:52] didn't have to do it he did it to save
[34:55] you and me tonight he did it because
[34:58] before the foundation of the world he
[35:00] saw you and he had a Plan of Redemption
[35:04] and he those that you were what kept Him
[35:07] you and I were what kept Him nailed to
[35:09] that
[35:10] cross amen he died for you and me praise
[35:15] God tonight Saints thank the
[35:17] Lord and Philippians the 2 chapter the
[35:20] fifth verse says let this mind be in you
[35:23] which was also in Christ Jesus who being
[35:26] in the form of God thought it not
[35:28] robbery to be equal with God but made
[35:31] himself of no reputation and took upon
[35:34] him the form of a servant and was made
[35:36] in the likeness of men and being found
[35:38] in fashion as a man humbled himself and
[35:42] become obedient unto death even the
[35:45] death of the
[35:47] Cross amen Saints if he hadn't committed
[35:50] his Spirit to God he he had never been
[35:52] able to
[35:53] die amen he had to become obedient ience
[35:57] to death for you and I so here's a man
[36:00] who had all power in Heaven and Earth
[36:02] but he never felt the need to make a big
[36:04] name for himself he never felt the need
[36:06] to show off he never felt the need to
[36:08] boss people around but rather he was
[36:10] born in a stable over a manure pile with
[36:13] a swaddling cloth wrapped around him he
[36:15] became a servant to the people he was
[36:17] raised a carpenter son amen is that
[36:20] right Saints and he lived his life for
[36:23] others yet he was so powerful that he
[36:25] had to allow him self to die but he had
[36:28] the power he had that beautiful
[36:29] character to go along with it and that's
[36:32] our example today amen so we might have
[36:35] the right to do something but we forfeit
[36:38] those rights to serve him amen you might
[36:41] have the right by the law to drink or to
[36:43] smoke or do other things but we forfeit
[36:45] those rights Amen to do what's
[36:49] right amen now brother Bram talked about
[36:51] the little boy from
[36:53] Kentucky that went to visit his
[36:55] grandmother
[36:57] and he said he he' never seen a mirror
[37:00] before but on the back side of the door
[37:02] in his grandmother's house he said he
[37:04] saw a mirror and he was kind of Lonesome
[37:06] and he wanted the little boy to play
[37:07] with him so he started walking toward
[37:09] the little boy and and he said he began
[37:11] to look into this glass and he got up
[37:13] close and he turned around he said why
[37:15] mama that's
[37:17] me is that right Saints and he said and
[37:21] that's what we want to look at tonight I
[37:23] want to look uh I want to look at me and
[37:26] I want you to look at yourself and as we
[37:29] look into God's Great mirror of his word
[37:32] let us be able to identify ourselves
[37:35] with some that's gone that we're going
[37:37] to speak about some characters of the
[37:39] other times and I want to see myself in
[37:42] God's looking glass is that your prayer
[37:44] tonight I want to see myself in God's
[37:47] looking glass cuz if anything will show
[37:49] you where you're standing he said it's
[37:51] this book amen he said there's no book
[37:54] like it cuz it's all truth and I don't
[37:57] say that other books are not true but I
[37:59] know this one is true it's all truth
[38:03] because it's the word of God so the
[38:05] prophet says to us to look at ourselves
[38:08] in the mirror of this word right
[38:11] here is that right Saints and he said
[38:14] whatever the word said we should look
[38:16] like that's what we should look like
[38:19] amen so whatever kind of man or woman
[38:21] the word of God says we should be that's
[38:24] what we want to be is that your prayer
[38:25] tonight Saints what whatever the word
[38:27] says I should be that's what I want to
[38:29] be and if the word says I should have
[38:31] joy then I want to have joy and if the
[38:33] word says I should have longsuffering
[38:35] then I want longsuffering and if the
[38:37] word said I should have peace then I
[38:39] want peace amen amen and if the word
[38:43] said I should have love I want love if
[38:45] it says I should have goodness I want
[38:47] goodness if it says I should have
[38:48] gentleness I want gentleness if it says
[38:51] I should have meekness I want meekness
[38:53] if it says I should have oh God if it
[38:55] says I should should have patience I
[38:58] want patience I want to look in the
[39:00] mirror of God's word and look back at
[39:03] myself and see where I measure up
[39:05] tonight amen oh come on somebody tonight
[39:09] and we want to be all that the word says
[39:11] we should be and we should identify
[39:14] oursel he said with the characters of
[39:17] The
[39:17] Bible oh my identification paragraph 116
[39:22] he says we want to make this Bible our
[39:25] looking glass and let ourselves be
[39:28] molded by his character having his
[39:31] character his mind letting the mind that
[39:34] was in Christ be in us his mind was
[39:37] always his uh what was his mind to do
[39:40] the mind that was in Christ always to
[39:43] stay with the father's word amen no
[39:47] matter what looked glossy and what
[39:48] looked this way it didn't make any
[39:50] difference to him the father's word is
[39:52] what counted everywhere that he met the
[39:55] devil oh I love his Saints not to be
[39:57] just a hearer of the word of God but a
[40:00] doer of the word of God not just to to
[40:02] feel good cuz we heard a tape but to but
[40:05] to feel good because we live the life
[40:07] that's on that tape that's it amen
[40:11] Saints and he never used his power to
[40:14] defeat him talking about the devil he
[40:16] used the word because that was him he
[40:19] was the word amen amen did you ever
[40:21] think he never wrote a book when he was
[40:23] here on Earth as far as we know he never
[40:26] wrote but one time and that was in the
[40:28] sand then he erased it out probably
[40:29] afterwards why didn't he write write a
[40:31] word because he was the word see he
[40:34] lived the word we don't need so many
[40:36] books when you become a written Epistle
[40:39] of God see see that's what God wants you
[40:41] to do images of him amen you know in the
[40:46] Heathen world how the Heathen puts up an
[40:48] idol and they prostrate themselves
[40:50] before the idol and work themselves into
[40:52] such an emotion till they believe that
[40:55] they can hear that Idol speak back to
[40:57] him it's a mental Affair but how vice
[40:59] versa from God's truth God wants you he
[41:03] don't want an idol you are the living
[41:05] image of
[41:08] God and you prostrate yourself before
[41:11] God and he FS you with
[41:13] himself and you express him as a Looking
[41:17] Glass his church that's beautiful Saints
[41:21] and his mind is his word and we become
[41:24] the word as we receive the word is that
[41:26] what the message teaches and so as we
[41:28] receive the word we become that word
[41:31] tonight and we become and as we become
[41:33] the word it's quickened To Us by his
[41:36] Spirit Hallelujah Glory we become then
[41:40] living images of
[41:43] christen amen written Epistles read of
[41:47] all men amen Romans 12:2 says be not
[41:51] conformed but be ye transformed by the
[41:55] renewing of your mind mind that you may
[41:57] prove what is that good and acceptable
[42:00] and perfect will of God Amen that's why
[42:03] we assembled here tonight brother will
[42:05] that's what we come here for it's for
[42:07] the transforming of our
[42:10] mind amen
[42:12] amen oh God identification paragraph 86
[42:16] he says wonder if we Christians could
[42:19] think that tonight wonder if we can look
[42:21] in God's looking glass or what the
[42:24] requirements is of a Christian and
[42:26] identify ourselves that way I wonder if
[42:30] we could I wonder if we can identify
[42:32] ourselves tonight with John
[42:34] 3:16 and oh all the other kind of
[42:37] scriptures Mark 16th chapter and all
[42:39] these other places that over in
[42:41] Galatians I believe and the different
[42:43] places second Thessalonians where the
[42:45] fruits of the spirit and so forth wonder
[42:47] if we can identify ourself he said so
[42:50] the prophet straightly charges us to
[42:53] examine ourselves by the word of God
[42:57] and to make sure that we can identify
[43:00] that word in our life amen and so as we
[43:05] do when we see things in our life that
[43:07] doesn't measure up to God's word that's
[43:09] where we take that to him he said we
[43:12] prostrate oursel before God and we say
[43:15] God make me a Living
[43:17] Image oh
[43:19] God so many times we hear the word but
[43:22] we must be constantly examining Our
[43:24] Lives to make sure we measure up to
[43:27] God's
[43:28] word amen I was just thinking on this
[43:31] character I wanted I want God's
[43:34] character in me I want to have the
[43:36] character that Christ had I I want to be
[43:40] that kind of a Believer I I don't want
[43:42] to be the kind of believer that's one
[43:43] way one day and another day another day
[43:46] if if you talk to somebody else that
[43:48] maybe doesn't know me from church what
[43:50] kind of person would they say I am am I
[43:52] the same person there that I am here
[43:54] that's what I'm talking about tonight
[43:55] say is that character that reflects
[43:58] through US
[44:01] amen and brother brandom goes on into
[44:04] this great character that Jesus had he
[44:06] had so much power that if he hadn't said
[44:09] the name of Lazareth remember brother
[44:10] Billy Paul's testimony brother it's in
[44:13] the message brother BR said if he hadn't
[44:14] said the name Lazarus all that were in
[44:17] the grave would have come forth that's
[44:20] power Saints if he didn't say if he just
[44:23] said come forth all that were in the
[44:26] grave would have come
[44:28] forth that's power but he was so special
[44:32] because he had the character to know
[44:34] what to do with all that power and he
[44:37] said power apart from character is
[44:39] satanic now brother Brown said in
[44:41] identification in in the 40th uh
[44:44] paragraph he says now Jesus gave us the
[44:46] example of what we ought to be looking
[44:50] at and he says when he reflected his
[44:52] life to us through the word what we
[44:54] should see when when we look into God's
[44:57] mirror we should see ourself identified
[45:00] with
[45:02] him he said that is a perfect example
[45:05] but now but we find out that as we go
[45:09] along through life that our character
[45:11] molds the image that we are each one
[45:15] knows that you as you live so is your
[45:18] character molds to what you
[45:20] are now you've seen people that you just
[45:24] love to be around
[45:27] yet they might not exactly be in your
[45:28] bracket of
[45:30] society and again they might be of A
[45:32] different race the color or the brown or
[45:35] the yellow but there's just something
[45:38] about that
[45:39] character that you just love to be in
[45:42] their
[45:44] presence that's the kind of person we
[45:46] want to be tonight Saints the kind of
[45:49] person that has such a character that
[45:51] people are drawn to us to be in our
[45:54] presence they want to be in our presence
[45:56] that's I know people like that brother
[45:58] Billy Paul was that kind of person that
[46:00] you just wanted to be in his presence
[46:04] you just felt better just looking at him
[46:07] is that right Saints and there's there's
[46:09] a few people that I know like that but
[46:12] that I'm envious of those people that's
[46:14] what I want Saints is that your desire
[46:17] tonight he said he said but there's just
[46:20] something about that character that you
[46:22] love to be in their presence because
[46:25] each person is a little Dynamo of their
[46:27] own and you put out an
[46:31] atmosphere and he said then you see
[46:33] people that were their noble people but
[46:36] yet you always glad to get away from
[46:40] them now that's true too Saints amen
[46:44] it's just they create such an atmosphere
[46:48] around where you are nothing against
[46:51] them they're nice people but you just
[46:53] don't like that atmosphere that they
[46:56] they're they're in and their character
[46:59] creates whatever they are and it makes
[47:02] them what they are now we all know
[47:05] people that when you see them come in
[47:07] the door you tense up a little
[47:11] bit I I mean we all know people I I've
[47:14] been stuck with people before that I
[47:15] wish somebody would have pulled a fire
[47:17] alarm to get me away from them right but
[47:21] Saints I got to thinking about this and
[47:23] I I question myself am I ever the kind
[47:27] of person that produces the kind of
[47:29] atmosphere that somebody can't stand to
[47:32] be around
[47:35] me now I've just had to be honest with
[47:38] myself am I ever that person am I ever
[47:41] the person that somebody's looking to
[47:43] pull the fire alarm to get away from
[47:46] me so Jesus was our example and his
[47:50] character was reflected to us through
[47:53] the word and he said our character molds
[47:56] us into an image the right character
[47:59] molds us into the image of Christ and
[48:02] the wrong character molds us into the
[48:04] image of the world and some people have
[48:06] such a character that we just want to be
[48:09] around them is that what the message
[48:11] teaches we love to be in their presence
[48:14] because we see the image of Christ in
[48:16] their life now I remember years ago when
[48:21] I was a sinner that several people there
[48:23] was some friends of mine at work and
[48:25] different places they would try to talk
[48:27] to me about the Lord and I was such a
[48:29] rank sinner when they would try to talk
[48:32] to me I I I would I'd let them have it
[48:35] I'm ashamed to say I there's no telling
[48:37] what kind of Filth was coming out of my
[48:38] mouth but I did not want to hear anybody
[48:41] talk to me about the Lord I didn't want
[48:44] to hear it it was probably my own
[48:47] condemnation but I didn't want to hear
[48:49] it and I didn't want to hear it from
[48:51] them but one day when I got around bry's
[48:55] grandfather father and and and uh I
[48:57] don't guess nobody here knows him he's
[48:59] gone on to be with the Lord now but he
[49:01] was such a gentle soul he was such a
[49:05] humble man he had such an atmosphere
[49:08] about him brother Josh you know mama you
[49:10] know he had such an atmosphere about him
[49:13] he had such a spirit about him that you
[49:16] just love to be around him and he talked
[49:19] to me about the Lord and I listened
[49:23] because he was such a man I couldn't say
[49:25] nothing negative to
[49:29] him that's the kind of man I want to be
[49:32] tonight amen somebody that can talk to a
[49:36] sinner and get through to them because
[49:38] of the atmosphere that I
[49:40] projected is that right
[49:43] Saints amen and that's why Christ had to
[49:46] Forfeit his rights and become obedient
[49:49] to the death of the Cross his character
[49:51] compelled him to make our place to take
[49:54] our place as the kinsman
[49:57] redeemer he saw the condition that we're
[50:00] in and he knew there was going to be no
[50:02] way that God and man could ever be
[50:05] reconciled is that right Saints and
[50:08] identification he says this this
[50:10] condition that the world is in today
[50:13] it's never it was never it's never the
[50:16] desire of God he didn't mean that at all
[50:20] but when he seen that creation had
[50:22] fallen now his own loving character
[50:25] molded himself into the person of Christ
[50:28] his character molded himself into the
[50:32] person of Christ and God's own character
[50:35] of Love projected himself in the man
[50:39] Christ and as Paul speaking think it not
[50:42] robbery but making himself equal to God
[50:44] rather his own character molded that
[50:47] kind of a person oh no one could ever do
[50:49] that but God this was done so that he
[50:52] could pay the penalty of the fall of his
[50:55] his creation thank the Lord Jesus look
[50:58] at that amazing character he he died so
[51:01] that he could pay a debt that he did not
[51:04] oh amen he paid a penalty for not for
[51:07] himself but for his
[51:10] creation the same creation that that
[51:12] rejected
[51:13] him amen he says uh paragraph 48
[51:18] identification he says now therefore his
[51:20] loving character of love oh for us it
[51:23] makes plain John 3:16 for God so loved
[51:26] the world that he gave his only begotten
[51:28] son that whosoever believeth in him
[51:31] should not perish but have eternal life
[51:33] God projected himself and become a man
[51:36] that he might have upon him the form of
[51:39] his Creation in other words he changed
[51:41] his tent he spread it amongst human
[51:44] beings thank the Lord tonight Saints so
[51:47] how can you and I have the same how can
[51:51] we get this great character that Jesus
[51:54] had well the answer is is we
[51:58] can't you can't have the character Jesus
[52:01] had you you can't develop the character
[52:03] that Jesus had you can't do it but
[52:07] brother Bram said paragraph 58 you
[52:09] cannot no way ever produce a character
[52:13] like
[52:15] that only accepting that character in
[52:19] you a church cannot do that a Creed
[52:23] cannot do that a denomination cannot do
[52:25] that an education cannot do that it must
[52:28] be a birth it's got to be a dying out
[52:33] and let God in by the grace of Christ
[52:36] and mold this type of character in you
[52:40] is that what he said saints that you
[52:42] become him and your life in his is the
[52:46] same then you are Sons and Daughters of
[52:49] God I can't develop that kind of
[52:51] character myself I can only die out to
[52:54] myself and receive his character into
[52:59] me amen so we can never produce the
[53:03] character that Jesus had so we can only
[53:05] be reborn with that character we can
[53:08] only have a new birth to have that
[53:10] character in us and then the old things
[53:13] pass away and then All Things become new
[53:16] and we let the grace of Christ mold his
[53:18] character into each one of
[53:21] us amen so the question isn't how can I
[53:25] develop that character it's how can I
[53:27] die out to myself and receive that
[53:30] character from
[53:32] Christ now brother Brown said in
[53:34] identification 111 he says and now
[53:37] remember after Jesus doing this nobody
[53:40] else could do it nobody else could do it
[53:46] we are invited now Church think of this
[53:49] just a minute we are invited to shape
[53:52] our own character to his by by his
[53:57] grace we are invited think of it to
[54:00] become characters like this if we are
[54:03] ready to lay our character down and the
[54:07] molding that we had heady high-minded
[54:10] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[54:12] God false accusers incontinent despisers
[54:15] of those that are trying to do right
[54:16] having a form of godliness and denying
[54:18] the power of the word how can God come
[54:21] into a place like that that's what we
[54:23] were Saints that's what we that's a
[54:25] character we
[54:26] had and then he says but he watches over
[54:30] his word to vindicate it to make it come
[54:32] to pass and the word is pushed out how
[54:35] can he identify himself with something
[54:37] like that we've got to take the entire
[54:41] Full
[54:44] Gospel we
[54:46] must and now being that we have
[54:48] identified ourselves as Full Gospel
[54:50] people let's mold our character we're
[54:53] invited to be molded in His image that
[54:56] we might reflect his presence and the
[54:59] works that I do shall you do also the
[55:03] life that I live so shall
[55:05] you you're invited by God to take him as
[55:09] an example and let our character be
[55:11] molded like his what a thing
[55:16] M
[55:20] amen just a couple more here and then
[55:23] we'll
[55:24] close
[55:25] brother Brown said this and this is in
[55:27] the saman church
[55:30] age let me skip down just a little safe
[55:33] some
[55:34] time now let me read this he says
[55:37] according to Paul he has left this his
[55:40] church a measure of
[55:44] suffering that they too by their faith
[55:46] in God while suffering for
[55:49] him would come to a place of perfection
[55:55] so brother Brown said that that that God
[55:58] has left this church a measure of
[56:01] suffering that while we are
[56:04] suffering we we we will come to a place
[56:08] of perfection through that
[56:12] suffering he says why did he want this
[56:15] James 1 2 and4 said my brethren count it
[56:18] all joy when you fall into diverse
[56:21] Temptations knowing this that the trying
[56:24] of your faith worketh patience but let
[56:27] patience have her perfect work that you
[56:29] may be perfect and entire wanting
[56:31] nothing why does he stand by the reason
[56:36] is in Romans 8:17 and 18 and CH and if
[56:39] children then HS Heirs of God and Joint
[56:42] HS with Christ if so be that we suffer
[56:45] with him that we may also be also
[56:48] glorified together for I reckon that the
[56:51] sufferings of this present time are not
[56:53] worthy to be compared compared with the
[56:56] glory which shall be revealed in
[56:59] us so the Bible said that we might have
[57:02] to suffer a little bit but there's no
[57:05] comparison with The Suffering that we
[57:07] got going on right now there's no
[57:09] comparison with The Joy and the glory
[57:12] that'll be
[57:13] revealed amen he says unless we suffer
[57:17] with him we cannot reign with him you
[57:21] have to suffer to
[57:23] rain you have to suffer to rain he said
[57:28] the reason for this is that character
[57:31] simply is never made without
[57:37] suffering is that what the word says
[57:41] character is never made without
[57:46] suffering character is a victory not a
[57:52] gift a man without character can't Reign
[57:56] because power apart from character is
[58:00] satanic but Power with character is fit
[58:03] to rule and since he wants us to share
[58:07] even his throne on the same basis that
[58:10] he overcome and is sat down in his
[58:12] father's Throne then we have to overcome
[58:16] to sit with him and the little temporary
[58:19] suffering that we go through now is not
[58:22] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[58:25] Glory that will be revealed in us when
[58:27] he comes aren't you happy about that
[58:29] Saints oh what Treasures are laid up for
[58:32] those who are willing to enter into his
[58:34] kingdom through much tribulation so so
[58:37] the word teaches us that it's not going
[58:39] to always be easy that there is going to
[58:42] be trials that there is going to be
[58:45] tests that there is going to be
[58:47] tribulation but that all things work
[58:50] together for good to those that love God
[58:52] and are called according to his purpose
[58:54] and that all those things go to build a
[58:57] great character in you and I
[59:01] today is that what the word said saint
[59:03] it's not a victory it's a gift and
[59:06] without it we're not fit to rule because
[59:08] uh we have to endure temporary suffering
[59:11] and we have to overcome as he overcame
[59:14] and we suffer with him so that we can
[59:16] reign with
[59:17] him amen and I'll tell you Saints there
[59:19] ain't going to be no complaining when we
[59:22] get on the other side there ain't going
[59:24] to be no body here upset because of
[59:26] everything we had to go through on this
[59:28] side when we're on the other side it'll
[59:30] all be for it'll all be for the right
[59:32] cause amen there won't be there won't be
[59:35] no tears over there there won't be no
[59:37] complaining about how tough it was over
[59:40] there right amen that's right amen we
[59:45] won't be taking any of this world's
[59:47] Goods with us but we will be taking
[59:50] something with us when we meet the Lord
[59:52] Brother Bram said in the lat s Church
[59:53] age he said we better re be real careful
[59:56] now to see that we take something that
[59:59] will make us right before God oh my amen
[1:00:03] we better be careful to make sure we
[1:00:05] take something that'll make us right
[1:00:08] before God so then what will we take
[1:00:11] with us we will take our character
[1:00:14] brother that's what we will take with us
[1:00:17] now what kind of character will you take
[1:00:19] with you will it be like his whose
[1:00:22] character was molded by suffering and
[1:00:24] the fiery furnace of Affliction or will
[1:00:27] it be the softness and character of this
[1:00:30] characterless lot to sin people it's up
[1:00:33] to each one of us for in that day every
[1:00:36] man will bear his own
[1:00:41] burden so he said you're going to take
[1:00:43] your character with
[1:00:45] you oh God amen amen let me check my
[1:00:50] time
[1:00:51] okay two more quotes and then we'll
[1:00:54] we'll go to prayer tonight Saints is
[1:00:56] this all right tonight
[1:00:58] Saints amen I know everybody's tired
[1:01:01] it's Wednesday night y'all y'all G
[1:01:04] yourself up and amen let's get through
[1:01:08] this last couple of of uh of quotes here
[1:01:12] in the message I know brother Bram says
[1:01:15] this about
[1:01:17] troubles he says and why does God let
[1:01:20] troubles come he said God harnesses
[1:01:24] trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes
[1:01:29] it obey him amen and those troubles
[1:01:32] bring us into a closer fellowship with
[1:01:36] God amen amen there ain't no prayer like
[1:01:40] a troubled prayer there ain't no prayer
[1:01:43] like one when everything's going wrong
[1:01:46] you never seek God quite like you do
[1:01:48] when everything's going crazy in your
[1:01:50] life there's no prayer like a sincere
[1:01:53] prayer and there's no prayer more
[1:01:55] sincere than when you're in the depths
[1:01:57] of Despair that's right when you don't
[1:01:59] know how you're going to make it through
[1:02:01] the day when everything is stacked
[1:02:03] against you that's a sincere
[1:02:06] prayer amen and God uses that he hardest
[1:02:10] is that he puts a bent in its mouth and
[1:02:13] he uses that to bring us into a closer
[1:02:15] fellowship with him amen amen he uses
[1:02:19] that to build in this Godly character
[1:02:23] that Jesus had
[1:02:25] Hallelujah is that what he does Saints
[1:02:28] thank the Lord for it tonight amen now
[1:02:32] we ask God many times in our prayers for
[1:02:35] comfort and for peace right Amen in the
[1:02:40] message I know he says this as the
[1:02:43] musicians come he
[1:02:46] said there had been no
[1:02:48] rainbow until the flood came but after
[1:02:52] Noah was pressed into that condition
[1:02:54] that he was in to float 40 days and
[1:02:57] nights in a storm and the little Ark
[1:02:59] pitching up and down in the water it was
[1:03:03] after the flood was over that he saw the
[1:03:06] rainbow for its first
[1:03:08] time the Covenant of Hope the Covenant
[1:03:12] of promise and after he had went through
[1:03:14] the tribulation then he saw the promise
[1:03:18] after he had went through the
[1:03:20] tribulation then he saw the promise
[1:03:23] that's the way you see the Promise after
[1:03:26] you've gone through the
[1:03:29] tribulation can you say Amen tonight he
[1:03:32] said I've liked that poem or Psalm must
[1:03:35] I be carried home to heaven on a flowy
[1:03:38] bed of ease While others fought to win
[1:03:41] the prize and sail through bloody
[1:03:44] Seas he says we ask listen this Saints
[1:03:48] we ask for comfort and
[1:03:52] peace and God gives us the best he could
[1:03:56] give us trials and
[1:03:59] tribulations that's better than comfort
[1:04:03] and peace
[1:04:06] amen now we might not understand that
[1:04:09] Saints but that's what the word says
[1:04:12] tonight we ask God for comfort and peace
[1:04:16] and he gives us better than comfort and
[1:04:19] peace he gives us trials and
[1:04:23] tribulations because it's through those
[1:04:25] trials and tribulations that we're drawn
