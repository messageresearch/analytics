[7:40] Lord Jesus. Father, God, I just want to
[7:42] say thank you, Lord, for allowing us to
[7:43] be in this house once again. Lord, just
[7:46] thinking back to everything our prophet
[7:47] has taught us. And Lord, the message we
[7:50] heard this morning, what our prophet
[7:51] taught us that one day these doors would
[7:53] close. Father, may we take advantage,
[7:56] Lord, while we still have the time. And
[7:58] Lord, asking, Father, that the things
[8:00] that were spoken this morning, Lord,
[8:03] Father, we've heard them in our minds.
[8:05] And Lord, it would take you to take
[8:07] these words and anchor them with your
[8:08] spirit into our hearts, Father, to help
[8:10] us live a life where the gospel, Lord
[8:13] Jesus, that it would bring forth fruit,
[8:15] Lord God, that we could be a light in
[8:16] this end time, Father. Each and every
[8:18] one of us have a need here. We humbly
[8:21] ask that your Holy Spirit would just
[8:22] cleanse our thoughts. Forgive us of our
[8:24] sins and our shortcomings even Lord as
[8:26] we forgive those that trespass against
[8:28] us. Help us to get ourselves out of the
[8:30] way, Lord, that you could come in and
[8:32] have the preeminence. Father, may you
[8:34] bless our brothers elite songs, any
[8:36] special that's sung, Father, help us to
[8:39] enter into create an atmosphere that you
[8:41] would feel welcome. We give you thanks,

[21:56] be
[21:57] the
[21:59] God bless you all here tonight.
[22:02] I'm going to read this. Please remember
[22:04] brother Bobby words for strength as he
[22:08] goes through his treatments. So this is
[22:11] Barbara's brother. So let let's remember
[22:13] him and uh that uh all pain be taken
[22:17] away and and he would be in comfort and
[22:20] and comfort the family and and let the
[22:25] will of the Lord be done. We we want him
[22:27] to be healed but whatever God wants
[22:30] wants to do. So we'll keep him in prayer
[22:33] and also the the people that are
[22:36] traveling also for traveling mercies
[22:39] and uh being the the great communion
[22:42] night tonight.
[22:44] you know that I was thinking at work
[22:46] about this communion week and I was
[22:50] thinking
[22:52] that uh the prophet said remember his
[22:56] death
[22:58] and the prophet taught us that
[23:02] Jesus died at the garden of Gethsemane.
[23:05] He gave up his will, right?
[23:09] His human will because he had a will
[23:12] because he said, "Not my will but thy
[23:15] will be done." And he he was able in the
[23:18] garden of Gethsemane, he died to that
[23:21] will to that human will. So he when he
[23:24] went to the cross, he was already dead
[23:27] in his human will. He was already dead.
[23:29] That's why the that's why he could be so
[23:33] obedient. It was the the God that was in
[23:36] them took over. And really, that's what
[23:40] we got to come to. We got to come to
[23:42] that where we can be able to die to our
[23:47] human will.
[23:49] That God because we have an attribute
[23:51] inside of us like the woman at the well.
[23:55] We have an attribute
[23:57] and that attribute is going to take over
[23:59] when we can die to our human will. And
[24:02] that attribute is the word of God inside
[24:04] of us.
[24:06] So help us. Help us here this evening,
[24:09] Lord. We we're in a we're in
[24:12] great expectation like this like this
[24:14] morning. We're hearing that something's
[24:15] going to happen. You know that it's the
[24:18] lull before the storm. So help us help
[24:21] us to get ready for what's coming.
[24:24] And uh let's not be scared. Let's let's
[24:28] take courage. We're a very privileged
[24:30] people.
[24:32] So with that, let's let's go to the Lord
[24:36] in prayer.
[24:38] Heavenly Father, Almighty God, I come to
[24:41] thee this
[24:43] evening here. There's a great communion
[24:45] night, Lord, knowing that we have to
[24:48] come to a death, Lord. Even I heard the
[24:51] the prophet said, "The Brandom
[24:53] tabernacle
[24:55] needs a killing along with me in it." He
[24:58] wasn't talking about a physical death.
[25:00] He's talking about what Jesus went
[25:02] through in the garden of Gethsemane,
[25:04] which is his will. We need to let go of
[25:07] our human wills that your word can take
[25:10] over our lives. Oh God, we love you,
[25:13] Lord. We pray for uh brother words,
[25:16] Lord, that you would help him, Lord.
[25:20] Make him comfortable, take away all
[25:22] pain, Lord, and give him peace in his
[25:24] heart. And the loved ones are ones that
[25:26] are hurting. I know sister Barbara loves
[25:29] him a lot. Give her peace, Lord. I pray
[25:31] thee, Lord, that everything is going to
[25:33] be done according to your will, Lord. We
[25:36] love you and we appreciate you, Lord. We
[25:38] want to thank you for giving Sister
[25:40] Heather a job, Lord. I was so happy when
[25:42] I heard that. Thank you, Father. We love
[25:45] you and appreciate you. Be with us here
[25:48] this evening, Lord. Be with brother uh
[25:51] Israel. Whatever you have for us
[25:53] tonight, Lord, we're here with open
[25:56] hearts, Lord. And we know that your will
[25:58] is going to be done. This great
[25:59] communion night. Prophet also taught us
[26:02] that it's a it's an inventory time to
[26:05] check up on ourselves, Lord. That to
[26:07] make things right, Lord, and and try to
[26:10] live right for you, Lord. That our wills
[26:12] can be disappeared, Lord. That's my
[26:14] that's my desire, Lord. That my own
[26:17] human will would be done away with and
[26:19] that germ that's inside of me would come
[26:22] forth and take over, Lord. That's my
[26:24] desire. Thank you, Lord. We bless you.
[26:27] We give you honor and glory, Lord. We
[26:28] ask all these things in the name of the
[26:31] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[26:36] Amen.
[26:39] [Music]
[26:43] Mine's off. Brother Sean, if you could
[26:46] come and prepare to sing for us tonight.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Happy to be in the
[26:56] house of the Lord tonight. Amen.
[27:00] Because of his amazing grace that we're
[27:01] here today. Amen.
[27:05] [Music]
[27:07] Amazing
[27:14] grace,
[27:16] how sweet
[27:18] the sound

[27:54] my fears
[27:56] relieved.

[29:17] endures,
[29:19] [Music]
[29:20] the earth shall soon
[29:25] dis
[29:27] like snow.
[29:29] The sun
[29:31] forbear
[29:32] to shine.
[29:36] My God
[29:39] who called me here
[29:43] below.
[29:45] He will be
[29:47] forever.
[29:52] My chains are gone.

[31:28] I'm found.
[31:29] I was blind,
[31:32] but now
[31:34] I see.
[31:38] Let's all stand together tonight.

[35:06] &gt;&gt; How many is glad to be here?
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Something's fixing to happen.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Fixing to hear the word of the Lord.
[35:14] Right.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I have a good friend here, a
[35:19] good friend to this church.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; A good friend in the good in the Lord, a
[35:25] minister, Brother Armando Rivera. And he
[35:28] brought with him another good friend of
[35:30] mine, my old friend, Brother Alex
[35:33] Moreno. God bless you. Stand, Brother
[35:36] Alex. He's from the Sacramento area in
[35:39] California.
[35:43] It's been many, many years.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to hear that he's still
[35:48] on the battlefield for the Lord.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to ask brother Arando
[35:52] come to come and greet you and uh just
[35:55] say hello. And as he comes, let's give
[35:59] the Lord a hand of praise.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[36:11] I'm happy to be in the house of the
[36:13] Lord. Amen.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I was reading the prophet said
[36:17] when you are in the church, you have
[36:20] protection.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; He said there is protection when you are
[36:23] in the church.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; So, we have protection.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; If we're not in the church, then we are
[36:28] without protection.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; No matter what happens, we are
[36:31] protected.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you. It's good to be here.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:40] I just stay here. Amen. So that's his
[36:42] wife and some of the children coming in.
[36:44] God bless them richly. Amen. We're going
[36:47] to listen to a portion of the message um
[36:50] desperations
[36:52] starting from paragraph 43 to 155. And
[36:57] um I want to sing a little bit of this
[36:59] song. We'll stand. It's kind of a hand
[37:00] clapping song. I'm on the battlefield
[37:03] for my Lord. Amen. I'm on
[37:07] [Music]
[37:08] for my Lord. Yes, I am. Oh, I'm on the
[37:14] battlefield.
[37:16] Oh, my Lord.
[37:19] One day I promise him that I I'm going
[37:24] to serve him.
[37:27] Oh, I'm on battlefield
[37:32] for my Lord. Yes, I'm on the battlefield
[37:38] for my Lord.
[37:43] I'm on the battlefield
[37:47] for my Lord.
[37:51] And I promised him that I
[37:56] would serve him for the rest of my life
[38:00] on the battlefield.
[38:04] for my Lord. Won't you play that?

[39:01] and I promise him that I
[39:05] I'm going to serve him until I die.
[39:10] I'm on the battlefield
[39:14] for my Lord.
[39:19] Amen.
[39:22] You ever get a song in your spirit and
[39:24] you just got to let it out?
[39:26] That one was in my spirit, so I had to
[39:29] let it out. So, God bless you. Um, we're
[39:32] going to go right to this message here.
[39:34] Brother Random is taking the scripture
[39:36] in Jeremiah chapter
[39:39] 29. So, if you want to turn there as we
[39:43] prepare to go there and we'll sing that
[39:47] old hymn that always introduced the
[39:49] prophet. It's the dinner bell for the
[39:52] believer.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Only believe. Brother Al stole used to
[39:56] say that it's the dinner bell for the
[39:58] believer. Ding ding ding. When you hear
[40:00] only believe, amen, you're going to hear
[40:02] the word of the Lord. Remember he used

[41:35] [Music]
[41:37] Lord,
[41:40] [Music]
[41:42] God bless you. You may be seated,
[41:43] brother.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to give you my text while
[41:48] you're you're you're turning. My text
[41:51] tonight is desperations.
[41:55] And uh desperation.
[41:58] And now you know what desperations is.
[42:01] And now we're going to read from
[42:04] Jeremiah the 29th chapter, the 10th
[42:07] verse.
[42:09] For thus saeth the Lord, that after 70
[42:13] years be accomplished at Babylon, I will
[42:16] visit you and perform my good word
[42:19] toward you in causing you to turn to
[42:23] this place.
[42:25] For I know the thoughts that I think
[42:28] toward you. Isn't that sweet?
[42:31] Sayaeth the Lord.
[42:33] though
[42:35] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[42:39] give you accepted end.
[42:43] Then shall you call upon me,
[42:46] and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I
[42:50] will hearken unto you,
[42:54] and ye shall seek me and find me when ye
[42:58] shall search for me with all your heart.
[43:05] and I will be found of you, sayaeth the
[43:07] Lord, and I will turn away your
[43:10] captivity, and I will gather you from
[43:14] all nations, and from all the places
[43:17] where I have drove you, sayaeth the
[43:19] Lord, and will bring you again unto unto
[43:23] the place which I cause you to be
[43:26] carried away captive back to Pentecost.
[43:32] I put that in myself. It doesn't say
[43:35] that's what I was meaning to the church.
[43:37] Luke 16 again 15th verse
[43:44] all the 16th verse. The law and the
[43:47] prophets were until John. Since that
[43:51] time the kingdom of God is preached and
[43:55] every man presses into it.
[44:01] every man presses into it.
[44:06] Not just simply walks into it easily,
[44:08] but it's got to be pressed into.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; See, now when you seek me with all your
[44:16] heart, then I'll be found.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; And he promised that he would return and
[44:22] bring the people from scattered all over
[44:24] the earth after those seven years back
[44:27] into Jerusalem where they left from. And
[44:29] he did it just that way. That's right.
[44:32] Now, we're going to talk on on
[44:35] desperations for a few minutes now.
[44:39] Usually, it takes a state of emergency
[44:42] to throw us into desperation.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; It's too bad it has to do that.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; But human beings are so slothful in
[44:51] their mind that it takes an emergency.
[44:54] Something arises.
[44:57] And when they do, then it throws them
[44:59] into that desperation.
[45:02] And really in doing that, in
[45:05] desperation,
[45:06] it brings out that real thing that you
[45:10] are.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; It shows what you're made out of in the
[45:15] time of desperation.
[45:17] It usually pulls out all the good things
[45:21] that's in you.
[45:23] In time of death, I've heard people when
[45:26] they know they were dying and things
[45:29] that they kept secret all their life,
[45:31] they in desperation, they were trying to
[45:34] confess it. See, and trying take this
[45:37] and make it right. Go, please go do See,
[45:41] in desperation,
[45:43] they ought to have done that beforehand.
[45:45] See, not wait till the time of
[45:47] emergency.
[45:49] Will you do so and so for me? The
[45:52] emergency causes desperation when we
[45:55] ought to do it without the emergency.
[45:58] Now, we notice tonight that we're taking
[46:02] the symbols of the Passover
[46:06] and the Passover was taken in emergency
[46:11] in times of desperation.
[46:15] You notice in in uh Exodus the 12th
[46:18] chapter and the 11th verse of the 12th
[46:21] chapter, I believe it is, it says, "Eat
[46:24] this Passover with the shoes on your
[46:27] feet, with your loins girded up and with
[46:31] the staff in your hand. See, you're
[46:34] eating in desperation."
[46:37] They had seen the great hand of God.
[46:40] They saw all of his miracles. And then
[46:43] they come under the sign of the token.
[46:48] And while they were under the sign of
[46:50] the token, they' taken the communion in
[46:53] in desperation.
[46:55] For they knew at that time God was
[46:58] fixing to strike the judgment.
[47:01] And it was a shaking time.
[47:05] It was a time where every man was
[47:07] examining himself
[47:09] because the word of the prophet had not
[47:13] failed one time. It had been proven to
[47:16] be true. Whatever he said, it kept him
[47:19] just exactly the way he said it. The
[47:22] pillar of fire was still there. And then
[47:25] the prophet had announced that God would
[47:29] only pass over when he saw the token at
[47:32] the door.
[47:34] And it was a desolation. I'd imagine the
[47:37] children were when they saw those big
[47:40] black wings drop down from the sky like
[47:43] a smoke settling over the city, the
[47:45] screams coming from every house. The
[47:48] children might have went to their daddy
[47:49] and said, "Daddy, are you sure that
[47:52] we're under that token?" And he could go
[47:54] to the door, look up on the post a
[47:56] little, said, "Son, that's according to
[47:58] his word.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Remember, I'm your oldest child. Daddy,
[48:02] are you positive? I am positive. That's
[48:06] according to what the prophet told us.
[48:07] And he has the word of the Lord.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Say, when I see the blood, I'll pass
[48:12] over you. Take a lamb for the house. I
[48:14] brought all you children in. You're my
[48:16] oldest, but my firstborn. That's the one
[48:18] that's dying all out in there. But there
[48:20] is a blood. That's what thus sayeth the
[48:23] Lord was. So rest, my son. Rest at ease
[48:28] because God made the promise. See? Well,
[48:31] daddy, why you got your shoes on? Why
[48:34] you got the staff in your hand? Why have
[48:37] you got a piece of bread in one hand and
[48:39] a lamb in the other hand? Why is them
[48:41] bitter herbs and things? What are you
[48:44] eating? What's the sweat running off
[48:45] your face about, son? This fixing a
[48:48] stripe. See, it was in a time of
[48:53] desperation.
[48:55] Now, I believe that we're living in the
[48:58] days that we're or otherwise the days
[49:01] that we're living in should cause the
[49:04] church to go completely into
[49:06] desperation.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; I believe since the message this morning
[49:12] from God, not me. I believe that order
[49:15] to draw into our congregation into
[49:17] desperation
[49:20] &gt;&gt; that we have played long enough. Amen.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; We've went to church long enough.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; We got to do something.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; How is it that we can see other great
[49:32] signs and wonders done on others than
[49:34] what about us?
[49:36] &gt;&gt; It's just Paul's in a state of
[49:39] desperation
[49:41] &gt;&gt; that we are determined
[49:44] before God. the signs of his coming
[49:47] should bring this entire congregation
[49:50] when we've read it from the word and the
[49:53] Holy Spirit has told us go at a certain
[49:55] place such and such a thing will happen
[49:58] not tell us what it was but it would
[50:00] happen we go there it happens that way
[50:03] the newspapers pack it the magazines
[50:06] pack it show the picture of it come back
[50:08] here and see those great mysteries
[50:11] hidden in the Bible open up to us on a
[50:14] new field that we never know before and
[50:16] perfectly blends into the coming of the
[50:19] Lord Jesus.
[50:22] Then at the end of the message, see the
[50:24] action of the great Holy Spirit. See him
[50:27] come down visible before people. Even
[50:28] take pictures of it. See it working and
[50:32] showing that it's not a man. It's not
[50:35] just a preacher. It's not a certain
[50:37] congregation. It's the Holy Spirit
[50:41] &gt;&gt; showing the same thing it did when it
[50:43] was embodied in the body of Jesus
[50:45] Christ. Now it's embodied in the body of
[50:48] his bride.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; It should throw us into desperation.
[50:54] Those people had seen the hand of God
[50:57] and that night of the communion they
[50:58] took it with in desperation because they
[51:02] know that something was fixing to
[51:03] happen. And we know something's fixing
[51:05] to happen.
[51:07] I remember the coming of the Lord will
[51:09] be a sudden secret going away.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; You'll come and take her like a thief in
[51:14] the night. And I think that if somebody
[51:18] all of a sudden there's members of our
[51:20] family gone and you're left behind,
[51:23] &gt;&gt; it should throw us into desperation.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; That by the grace of God, we'll not be
[51:29] left back behind
[51:30] &gt;&gt; because anything I don't want, don't be
[51:32] don't leave me, Lord. Amen.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; A few days ago, I was hearing Mel
[51:37] Johnson sing that song, remember me when
[51:40] tears are falling down.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. Remember me when friends are not
[51:45] around. When I cross over this river
[51:48] Jordan, when you're calling the road,
[51:50] remember me.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; And on the lamb's book of life, I want
[51:55] my name wrote. I want him to remember me
[51:59] when the ro called.
[52:01] and it throws me into desperation.
[52:05] That is like Paul said, after I preach
[52:07] the gospel, shall I be a a store away?
[52:10] Shall I be a a cast off? It could
[52:13] happen. So it chose me into a desperate
[52:16] state, desperation to think of after all
[52:20] these years of preaching, would I could
[52:23] I a place come where I could fail him?
[52:26] What's the next move? What must I do
[52:29] next? And it throws me into a nervous
[52:31] stage that what can I do? It throws me
[52:34] to the mountains and to the valleys.
[52:37] It's hard
[52:39] &gt;&gt; because when I'm with the people, I've
[52:43] got to be all things to all man that I
[52:46] might win some to Christ. Yet put that
[52:48] token always before me thing.
[52:52] And I see things that's coming up and
[52:54] you can't tell the people.
[52:57] You see different things and you're
[52:58] forbidden. Then visions that they call
[53:01] on and sometimes you'd be sorry if you
[53:03] did tell them and you know better than
[53:06] to do it. And then you go so far in
[53:08] visions to everything becomes a vision.
[53:11] It throws you into a nervous stage. You
[53:13] you look say now I'm out of vision like
[53:16] right here. Is this a vision? Where am I
[53:17] really standing at? You you overwork
[53:20] yourself. You over tax yourself and you
[53:23] find out things about people that you
[53:24] wish you didn't know. The people that
[53:27] desires these things to know these
[53:28] things, they don't realize what that
[53:31] type of ministry costs.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; You don't know what goes with it.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Then it throws into desperation. Lord
[53:40] God, I don't have to answer. Jack Moore
[53:44] said to me one time, I'd hate to have to
[53:46] answer like you have to at the day of
[53:47] the judgment.
[53:49] that God has put these people into your
[53:52] hands and you're going to give an
[53:54] account for every one of them.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; You're going to answer for your
[53:57] ministry.
[53:59] That's been about 15 years ago or maybe
[54:02] 18. And since then, I've been in
[54:04] desperation. What will I do? Let me say
[54:07] only what you say, Lord.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Let me tell them what's the truth or
[54:11] don't say nothing. It throws me in
[54:13] desperation. Then seeing these signs
[54:15] coming, seeing the Holy Spirit take us
[54:17] out there and bring these seals and lay
[54:19] them in like that. Bring the church ages
[54:21] and lay them in. Then come down in a
[54:23] great big pillar of fire back there and
[54:25] reveal himself. Then come down on the
[54:27] next thing on the seven seals and reveal
[54:30] it even put it in the papers and
[54:31] magazines. Then come in and take the
[54:33] angels of God, them seven angels with
[54:35] seven messages and confirmed it exactly
[54:38] what the Bible said.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:41] Then during that time come up and
[54:43] bringing those seal of those signs
[54:46] flashes of the end time and bring it up
[54:48] to the people and tell them what it was
[54:49] and all about it and the Lord working
[54:51] right there showing himself present and
[54:53] then right now like this morning come up
[54:56] and require that token on every person
[55:00] &gt;&gt; then you're my people. You're the ones
[55:03] that I love these and them listen to the
[55:05] tapes and so forth. Then you see what
[55:08] desperation puts me in.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Desperation.
[55:12] Signs of his coming should throw every
[55:15] member of Christ into desperation. Now
[55:19] about our souls, about our our our
[55:23] welfare for hereafter. Well, what are we
[55:25] going to amount to if we gain the whole
[55:26] world?
[55:27] &gt;&gt; What are we what are we living for?
[55:30] &gt;&gt; What are you worth for?
[55:32] &gt;&gt; What are you eating for? What are you
[55:33] struggling for to live? What are you
[55:35] living for to die?
[55:38] And you're not fit to live until you're
[55:39] fit to die.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[55:44] And we see so many miracles of healing.
[55:47] It should put us into desperation.
[55:51] If that little boy am I looking at Miss
[55:54] Peck and Paul now? Is this Mrs. Peck and
[55:56] Paul? Are you the one that had the boy
[55:58] here or something? Well, here's a woman
[56:00] sitting around here I was talking about.
[56:02] I just have to look over and see her.
[56:03] Now, if God can do that for that little
[56:07] boy,
[56:08] &gt;&gt; it ought to throw you into desperation.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Uh, a man from New Albany, he may be
[56:13] here tonight. He's a friend to my
[56:15] brother, uh, Roersonson
[56:18] had a little boy here. I think his wife
[56:20] had cancer once and was healed. And and
[56:22] now the little boy's got asthma was so
[56:24] bad. He's just in bad shape. Little
[56:28] fella almost cancer throat himself. See,
[56:32] and then
[56:33] Uh he brought the little boy. Yeah. I
[56:36] see his hand up in the back back there.
[56:38] Was praying for her this morning. You
[56:40] see desperation.
[56:43] When the wife was about to die with
[56:45] cancer, he know that God could heal her.
[56:48] And if God could heal the wife, God can
[56:50] heal the boy.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; And throws it into a state of
[56:54] desperation. See, you must come. And
[56:57] when you're desperate, then God's going
[56:58] to listen to you.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; But if you're just sloping, you don't
[57:01] care whether it does or not. Well, then
[57:02] that's different. You say you do, but it
[57:04] takes desperation to do it.
[57:07] I believe that the reason we don't have
[57:10] desperation is because it's a lack of
[57:13] love. God, the love of God, I think that
[57:16] the love of God causes desperation.
[57:19] If God is in you, the token inside of
[57:24] you, and you see the conditions of times
[57:27] and people waiting in sin the way they
[57:29] are, it'll throw you into desperation. I
[57:32] believe it will. Now, the word plainly
[57:35] states, if you don't put this down in
[57:37] Galatians 5 and 6, that faith workketh
[57:41] by love.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; See, faith workketh by love. And the
[57:46] only way that you can have faith is have
[57:48] love uh first because after all faith is
[57:53] love's incentive incentive. That's
[57:55] exactly what what faith is. It's an
[57:58] incentive to love. Now you if you don't
[58:01] have love, you can't have faith. See,
[58:04] how can you have faith in your wife if
[58:06] you don't love her?
[58:08] &gt;&gt; That's in theio. Now, how about agold to
[58:11] God?
[58:12] &gt;&gt; How can it be if you don't love God?
[58:15] &gt;&gt; If you said you love your wife and never
[58:17] tell her about it, never sit down and
[58:20] make love to her, express her to her,
[58:22] kiss her, hug her, and tell her she's
[58:24] the best cook in the country and all the
[58:25] things that you know and how pretty she
[58:27] is and how much you love her. If you
[58:29] don't do that, she'll never know it.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; That's the way if you do love her, you
[58:34] express it.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; That's the way we do to God. and we love
[58:38] him. We tell him about it. We sit down
[58:40] and we adore him and worship him. And
[58:43] see, love drives us to that. Now, what
[58:46] if something's got to be done for your
[58:48] wife? What I throw you into desperation
[58:51] to get it done?
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; What if somebody says your wife's got
[58:54] cancer? What if somebody says your your
[58:57] wife's got TV, she's fixed to die, yet
[59:00] you you you'll do anything. See, it'll
[59:02] throw you into desperation. That's the
[59:05] same thing that it is. We must have love
[59:08] before we can have faith. And faith,
[59:11] when we have genuine love, what does it
[59:15] do? It pushes our faith out on the
[59:18] battlefront for God.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Genuine godly love for God and for his
[59:25] word and for his people will push faith
[59:28] out there.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Love just takes a hold of faith and
[59:31] just, oh, let's go.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; And out it goes. because that's what
[59:35] love does.
[59:38] John 14:23, Jesus said, "If a man loves
[59:42] me, he'll keep my words."
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Now, you can't keep his words without
[59:46] having faith in what he said.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; So, you see, if he loves God, then he
[59:52] keeps God's word.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; If he said, "I'm the Lord." And he'll
[59:56] leave, he believes that.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Love makes him believe it because love
[1:00:00] dominates all. Though I speak with
[1:00:02] tongue of man, shows have not love, it's
[1:00:04] nothing. See, though I have faith to
[1:00:07] move mountains and have not love, it's
[1:00:08] nothing. Love dominates all cause. God
[1:00:11] is love,
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; a God of love. Now, yes, sir. If Jesus
[1:00:17] said, "If a man loves me, he will keep
[1:00:19] my words," we know it is true that God
[1:00:22] will meet a desperate soul.
[1:00:26] We all know that.
[1:00:28] But it usually takes something to drive
[1:00:30] us into that uh to that despair to the
[1:00:34] desperation. It takes something to do
[1:00:37] it. We find out in James 5:15
[1:00:41] that the Bible said that the affectional
[1:00:45] fervent that's desperation
[1:00:48] affectional fervent prayer of a
[1:00:51] righteous man availth much. Amen.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; When a righteous man, a good man gets in
[1:00:58] travail
[1:00:59] or soul travel
[1:01:03] or travail, I I think travel is a better
[1:01:06] word.
[1:01:07] Travail or travel, either which one you
[1:01:09] want to call it. But when a a soul gets
[1:01:13] in in desperation, intervailing
[1:01:17] and affectional fervent prayer of a man
[1:01:21] that can show the token, it does
[1:01:23] something.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Notice what the Bible said here also in
[1:01:27] James 16:16 says, "If confessing our
[1:01:31] faults,
[1:01:34] getting right, making ready for it,
[1:01:36] confess our faults one to another."
[1:01:39] Amen.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Having no faults that ask people to pray
[1:01:44] for you, confessing our faults one to
[1:01:46] another and praying one part or the
[1:01:48] other.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; There you are with love. Love that I got
[1:01:52] confidence I can confess to you my
[1:01:55] wrong. You can confess to me your wrong.
[1:01:58] I love you well enough and I'll pray for
[1:02:00] you and you pray for me. And we'll stay
[1:02:02] with it with a special fervent prayer
[1:02:04] until it's answered.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; That's that's desperation. That's what
[1:02:09] we should have all the time. Let's take
[1:02:12] some scriptural examples of that. What
[1:02:15] happened now for another about 15
[1:02:17] minutes? The Lord will Jacob.
[1:02:20] He was the man. He was first a kind of a
[1:02:23] carefree boy. He thought in his own mind
[1:02:27] that he knew that the birthright meant
[1:02:30] everything to him. And he didn't care
[1:02:32] how he had to get it. Just so he got it.
[1:02:35] And after he got it, he thought
[1:02:36] everything was all right because he had
[1:02:39] the birthight. He thought the thing was
[1:02:41] settled
[1:02:43] up to his brother when he was hungry
[1:02:45] coming in from the field from working
[1:02:47] with the cattle and hunting the deer.
[1:02:50] And his brother he needed a big pot of
[1:02:53] pottish wild peas and and things
[1:02:56] together. Might have been very tempting
[1:02:58] when a man's hungry had to walk it all
[1:03:01] day. And his brother said, "I'm just
[1:03:03] about ready to feed. give me some of
[1:03:04] this. And he said, "Well, uh, if you
[1:03:06] swear to me, I get the birthright." See,
[1:03:09] he didn't care how I done it. Just so he
[1:03:11] got. And he thought when he got the
[1:03:13] birthight, that's settled. Pentecost.
[1:03:16] That's why you failed.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; You thought because you were born of the
[1:03:22] spirit.
[1:03:24] Born of the spirit of God, the
[1:03:25] birthright. That settled it. But it only
[1:03:28] starts it.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember in the message of of
[1:03:32] hear ye him how that the child after it
[1:03:35] was born in the family become a son. It
[1:03:39] had rights to the birthright but it had
[1:03:41] to be proven
[1:03:43] child
[1:03:44] and then it if it did not prove out to
[1:03:47] be an obedient child to the father's
[1:03:49] will then it must be uh did not get the
[1:03:54] the was not uh become heir. It aired
[1:03:58] nothing. Yet it was a son, but he aired
[1:04:01] nothing if he wasn't interested in the
[1:04:03] father's work. And so when the Holy
[1:04:06] Ghost fell upon the Pentecostal people
[1:04:09] and they begin to restore back the gifts
[1:04:11] and things that was in the church, they
[1:04:13] thought because they were born of the
[1:04:15] spirit that settled it. But you see,
[1:04:17] there's a placing of a son. And after
[1:04:20] this son proved to be a real son, then
[1:04:22] he was taken to a public place and then
[1:04:25] was set up and changed robes and set up
[1:04:27] there. And then there was a placing of
[1:04:29] the son that he had and of everything
[1:04:31] the father had.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; God did the same thing by his son on
[1:04:34] Mount Transfiguration. He was
[1:04:36] overshadowed by the the uh cloud and was
[1:04:40] transfigured and his rain had shine like
[1:04:43] the sun. And a voice said, "This is my
[1:04:46] beloved son in whom I'm well pleased."
[1:04:48] Moses and the law had failed and this is
[1:04:51] him.
[1:04:52] He was placed.
[1:04:55] See, now Jacob thought because that he
[1:04:59] had the birthight that everything was
[1:05:01] made. So did the Pentecostal people and
[1:05:03] they began to organize the the oneness
[1:05:06] and trinitarians and all kinds of
[1:05:08] organizations and fussing and pulling
[1:05:10] one another proved that the token wasn't
[1:05:13] shown.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Malice, envy, strife. See? Well, that's
[1:05:18] where it got to. Now, see, Jacob thought
[1:05:22] the same thing, but in fear one night of
[1:05:25] his own life, desperation took a hold of
[1:05:28] him.
[1:05:30] when he thought that just across that
[1:05:32] river yonder my brother's waiting to
[1:05:35] kill me. He's going to see the
[1:05:37] birthright that he had gotten was the
[1:05:39] thing was going to cause his death. And
[1:05:42] sometimes that very thing
[1:05:45] that you receive as the Holy Spirit and
[1:05:48] is and are born again of the spirit. If
[1:05:51] you don't watch that same thing will
[1:05:53] condemn you at the end.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. The very waters that saved
[1:05:58] Noah condemn the world. Amen.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; The thing that that you would call
[1:06:03] fanaticism might be the very thing that
[1:06:05] condemns you at the end of the road.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Now, Jacob knew that his life was closed
[1:06:12] at the end.
[1:06:14] He had a messenger come told him that
[1:06:16] his brother with 400 armed men was
[1:06:19] coming to meet him. Notice he was on his
[1:06:22] road. Fear took a hold of him. He sent
[1:06:25] man on ahead with ox and cattle and
[1:06:28] sheep to make a peace offering with
[1:06:30] Esau. Then after that he started another
[1:06:33] group with another load of stuff. Then
[1:06:34] he started another group with another
[1:06:36] load of stuff trying to meet him first
[1:06:38] to try to turn his wrath. Then he got to
[1:06:41] thinking that won't stop him because
[1:06:43] he's probably richer than I am. He
[1:06:45] doesn't need it. Then he took his wives
[1:06:47] and his little children and set them
[1:06:49] across that Esau would see them little
[1:06:51] children and his wives and surely on his
[1:06:53] own little nieces nephews he would not
[1:06:56] slay. Then he still couldn't do it. God
[1:06:59] knows how to get a man.
[1:07:01] Jacob crossed the brook got down on his
[1:07:04] knees.
[1:07:06] No he kind of been a kind of a little
[1:07:08] shyer before that. Excuse expression but
[1:07:11] kind of a little he was a Jacob. Jacob
[1:07:14] needs a deceiver and that's what he was.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; But they somehow had to happen to him
[1:07:20] there in desperation
[1:07:23] there when death laid before him. There
[1:07:25] may be men and women sitting here
[1:07:27] tonight. That's death lays right before
[1:07:30] you.
[1:07:32] And the only way that you'll ever be
[1:07:34] able to achieve the thing that you're
[1:07:35] wanting is to desperately come. I must
[1:07:39] have it tonight. Amen.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; I get it now or I'm finished.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Tomorrow's too late. I must have it now.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; When you pray for the baptism of the
[1:07:49] Holy Spirit, the token, don't say,
[1:07:51] "Well, I'm going to try." Lord,
[1:07:54] I'm a little tired. Oh, mercy. Stay in
[1:07:56] your seat.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Don't even Don't even make an attempt.
[1:07:59] If you come say, "I'll pass through the
[1:08:01] prayer line. Put the oil away. I see if
[1:08:03] it does me any good." Might as well sit
[1:08:06] where you're at.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; I told you get to that place.
[1:08:10] until the whole church gets your place.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; That is between death and life. You've
[1:08:15] got to have it now or parish.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Then God will move on the scene.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; It takes desperation to bring God on the
[1:08:22] scene.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Jacob cried like never before.
[1:08:27] Desperately he called until he got a
[1:08:30] hold of God.
[1:08:32] And when he did, he wrestled. Not for 15
[1:08:35] minutes.
[1:08:37] He wrestled to keep him in his soul all
[1:08:40] night long.
[1:08:42] And still he knew he didn't have the
[1:08:44] blessing.
[1:08:45] And he was able to hold on until the
[1:08:50] blessing come.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; He wrestled desperately until the
[1:08:55] blessing come. Then and when he seen
[1:08:59] until God came on the scene and then in
[1:09:02] despair,
[1:09:03] I'll not let you go.
[1:09:06] When you begin to feel the blessing
[1:09:08] coming out on me now people say, "Glory
[1:09:09] to God. I got it now." Now you're
[1:09:11] deceived.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Somebody say, "Oh, I just feel so
[1:09:16] good, brother. I went I prayed. Oh,
[1:09:18] shivers run over me and that might have
[1:09:21] been God. I saw a great light before
[1:09:23] me." That still might have been God, but
[1:09:24] that ain't what I'm talking about.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; The Bible said in Hebrews the 6th
[1:09:29] chapter,
[1:09:31] the rain fallth on the just and the
[1:09:34] unjust.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:37] Just the same. Now you take wheat and
[1:09:41] take weeds and put them in the field and
[1:09:44] the rain is actually sent for the wheat.
[1:09:48] But the rain falls on the weeds the same
[1:09:51] as it does the wheat. And the rain is
[1:09:53] the weeds is just as happy about the
[1:09:55] rain as the wheat is. And it's the very
[1:09:57] same rain. Amen.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; The very Holy Ghost can fall upon an
[1:10:04] unbeliever
[1:10:06] and make him act just exactly the same
[1:10:09] way a believer acts.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; But by the fruits they are known.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm speaking of. That's a
[1:10:16] token.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; And David and Jacob rather in
[1:10:20] desperation
[1:10:22] he said, "I know. I feel you. You're
[1:10:26] here with me. But I'm not going to let
[1:10:29] you go. Somebody seems to find the first
[1:10:32] little sensation. Jump up, down, up, up,
[1:10:34] down, and say, "I got it. I got it. I
[1:10:35] got it." Oh, no.
[1:10:39] No. Jacob stayed there until something
[1:10:43] happened
[1:10:45] that made him walk different, made him a
[1:10:48] different person
[1:10:50] because he stayed until that happened.
[1:10:53] And he was able. The Bible said he held
[1:10:56] until he prevailed.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; How can a man prevail over God?
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; But you can do it.
[1:11:06] You can do it. A man can prevail over
[1:11:09] God. One time there was a man named
[1:11:11] Hezekiah. Had been told by the prophet,
[1:11:14] "Thus sayeth the Lord, you're going to
[1:11:15] die." Hezekiah turned his face to the
[1:11:18] wall and in desperation he wept out.
[1:11:22] Lord, consider me. I've walked before
[1:11:24] you with a perfect heart, and I need 15
[1:11:26] more years after God had told him
[1:11:31] that something's going to happen. He's
[1:11:33] going to die. And in desperation, he
[1:11:36] changed the program of God.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Desperation, he wept bitterly in
[1:11:42] desperation. Jacob stayed there until
[1:11:46] the blessing came and changed his name.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. from a deceiver to a prince with
[1:11:52] God.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Even the nation was called by his name.
[1:11:58] Yes, sir.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; What was it? The results was because he
[1:12:02] got desperate about the thing.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; And the next day when he met Esau, he
[1:12:06] didn't need any guards.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; He walked right out and met him.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; See
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; why? He had gotten desperation till he
[1:12:14] got the assurance. And you get desperate
[1:12:17] until you get the assurance. If you
[1:12:19] don't, don't even come to be prayed for.
[1:12:21] Don't even come to guard the altar. Wait
[1:12:24] till it's between life and death to you.
[1:12:26] Then something happened. Certainly
[1:12:29] desperation. Ruth got desperate one
[1:12:32] time. When she stand,
[1:12:35] would she have to go back to her people,
[1:12:38] to all that she loved and all that she
[1:12:42] she worshiped, her gods and her people?
[1:12:47] Or would she cleave to Nema?
[1:12:50] What must she do? And she got in
[1:12:53] desperation and she cried out, "Where
[1:12:56] you go, I'll go. Where you live, I live.
[1:13:01] Where you die, I'll die. Where you're
[1:13:04] buried, I'll bury. I'll be buried. And
[1:13:07] your God shall be my God. There you are.
[1:13:10] Desperate. God blessed her. Gave her a
[1:13:14] son. Obie forgot Jess. Jess got through
[1:13:19] just come Jesus. Because desperation
[1:13:23] like the little harlot rehab. She was
[1:13:26] desperate. She knowed that deathly
[1:13:28] before she's under judgment and she got
[1:13:31] desperate said I'll hide you spies I'll
[1:13:33] do anything only swear to your god and
[1:13:35] my house will stand
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; there you are he said I if you take this
[1:13:39] token it will eler
[1:13:43] got desperate when a responsibility was
[1:13:45] placed upon him the heart of bride for
[1:13:47] Isaac
[1:13:50] elar of Damascus was a great man he was
[1:13:54] favored by Abraham and he was trusted by
[1:13:57] Abraham to go out and hunt a bride, a
[1:14:00] ripe type of a bride for his son Isaac.
[1:14:03] Through that would bring forth Christ.
[1:14:07] Now, Ela Ezer being a spiritual man
[1:14:10] knowed what it meant. The right kind of
[1:14:15] a woman had to be that that man's wife.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; How would he chose it? And the hour of
[1:14:23] his desperation when he arrived at the
[1:14:25] city, he prayed and said, "Lord God,"
[1:14:28] that's the day when you get desperate,
[1:14:30] go to pray.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Lord God, let the first maid that comes
[1:14:36] forth and waters the camel and gives me
[1:14:38] a drink be that. He prayed in the hour
[1:14:41] of his desperation.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Rebecca, the beautiful maid came water
[1:14:46] the camel and then he said, "Don't delay
[1:14:48] me in my weight." She had to come to a
[1:14:51] time of decision. Whether she would go,
[1:14:54] she was a type of the bride. Was she was
[1:14:56] she go and marry a man who she's never
[1:15:00] even seen. Now, that's a great thing.
[1:15:04] Never even seen him. Yet, you'd only
[1:15:06] heard by his servant. That's a type of
[1:15:09] the bride. You've never seen Christ, but
[1:15:11] you hear by his servants what he is.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; You sell out everything. You leave your
[1:15:15] homes, everything else it takes to go to
[1:15:18] find him. Now notice, as she made the
[1:15:20] decision, the tie for the bride, left
[1:15:22] her denominational home, see
[1:15:26] Jonah
[1:15:28] th overboard in the time of a storm
[1:15:33] in the bottom of the sea, in the belly
[1:15:34] of the whale. All hopes of survival was
[1:15:39] gone. But it happened to come on his
[1:15:41] mind
[1:15:43] that Solomon in dedicated the temple
[1:15:45] said Lord if the people be in trouble
[1:15:48] anywhere and they'll turn towards this
[1:15:50] temple and pray then here and turning
[1:15:53] over in the belly of the whale manag to
[1:15:56] get somewhere to his knees I imagine
[1:15:59] with the bomb of the whale all over him
[1:16:02] very praying in desperation
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; and in that desperate just a few breaths
[1:16:09] of oxygen is all he had in the whale's
[1:16:11] belly. And in that few breaths that he
[1:16:14] was drawing, maybe he didn't know which
[1:16:16] way he was, but said, "Lord, I believe
[1:16:18] I'm looking up for Dodger Temple." And
[1:16:21] with just a few breaths to go, in
[1:16:23] desperation, prayed
[1:16:27] under those circumstances. Never been
[1:16:29] done before, but he was desperate.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; He prayed and God kept him alive for
[1:16:34] three days and nights and delivered him
[1:16:36] at the place to deliver his message.
[1:16:39] desperation.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Hannah, a barren woman in the Bible, she
[1:16:45] wanted a son
[1:16:48] and she got to fasting for him and she
[1:16:51] fasted and prayed until even the priests
[1:16:54] at the temple thought she was drunk.
[1:16:58] She was in such desperation
[1:17:01] with the rest of the women watching what
[1:17:03] kind of a bonnet the other one had wore.
[1:17:05] And you know how it goes. and the other
[1:17:07] one seen what kind of clothes they had
[1:17:09] on and talking about the things going on
[1:17:10] on the farm. But not Hannah. She stepped
[1:17:13] right through the whole crowd and went
[1:17:15] to the altar. She'd been fasting. She
[1:17:17] wanted her reproach taken away. What a
[1:17:20] difference it is. It's almost a reproach
[1:17:21] to have a child.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; That it was a it was reproach not to
[1:17:26] have one. And she got on her knees and
[1:17:29] she noticed the dignity of the temple.
[1:17:31] She never noticed the dignified priest
[1:17:33] as he walked out. She was in such
[1:17:36] distress, sort of tears rolling down her
[1:17:38] cheeks and she was crying in
[1:17:40] desperation. Oh Lord God, give me a son.
[1:17:44] Give me a son. Notice she wasn't
[1:17:47] selfish. When God heard her and answered
[1:17:52] her prayer and gave her a son,
[1:17:56] she gave him back to God. And because
[1:17:59] that she was willing not to be selfish
[1:18:02] after Darth answered her prayer, he gave
[1:18:05] her a prophet.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; That was an extra blessing. Oh, he's
[1:18:11] just full of them.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Those little extra things that he gave.
[1:18:15] Not only a son, but a prophet. And there
[1:18:17] had been no open vision for many, many
[1:18:19] years in Israel. Samuel the first
[1:18:23] prophet for many, many years. Because a
[1:18:26] mother got desperate
[1:18:29] that she could have no children and she
[1:18:31] was past the age of probably 60 70 years
[1:18:34] old and she prayed with desperation. She
[1:18:38] must have this child. Why is it? God had
[1:18:41] spoke to her. No doubt.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; You can't be desperate. The God speaks
[1:18:45] to you. Oh church, rise and shake
[1:18:48] yourself.
[1:18:50] Pinch your conscience. Wake yourself up
[1:18:54] in this hour. We must be desperate or
[1:18:56] perish.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; There's coming forth something from the
[1:19:00] Lord.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Anoint thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; There's coming forth something and we
[1:19:07] better get desperate.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; It's between life and death. It'll pass
[1:19:12] through us and we won't see it because
[1:19:15] that she wasn't selfish. She was given a
[1:19:18] prophet. The Shonomite woman had a
[1:19:21] little boy that the prophet had spoke
[1:19:24] the word of the Lord over though she was
[1:19:26] old and her husband old. They had no
[1:19:29] children but she was kind to this this
[1:19:31] prophet and she knew that he was a man
[1:19:34] of God. She perceived that he was
[1:19:35] honorable a real man. He come into the
[1:19:39] house husband not there and whatever
[1:19:41] more he was a holy man. They could see
[1:19:44] that he was an honorable person. She'd
[1:19:47] watched him do signs and wonders. She'd
[1:19:49] heard him tell things that happened. He
[1:19:51] was an honorable holy man. She said to
[1:19:54] her husband, "I perceive that this man
[1:19:56] that stops with us is a holy man."
[1:19:59] The lady of the house. She know that he
[1:20:01] was a holy man. And she built a little
[1:20:04] house out there for him so he wouldn't
[1:20:06] be embarrassed. He could come by when he
[1:20:08] wanted to and so forth. She put a a
[1:20:09] little bed out there and a and a jug of
[1:20:12] water and so forth so he could wash
[1:20:13] himself and have something to drink. and
[1:20:15] she'd probably send a maid out or
[1:20:17] somebody to book her with with some food
[1:20:19] to feed him and come by and bid the the
[1:20:21] day to him or something. And so when
[1:20:24] Elijah saw this kindness done to him and
[1:20:28] it's written, "What you do to my little
[1:20:29] one, you do it to me."
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; So, uh, she saw that the woman was
[1:20:34] honoring God as she honored this
[1:20:36] prophet, as she seen God in the prophet.
[1:20:39] And so, uh, she wanted nothing for it.
[1:20:42] It wasn't her heart for anything. She
[1:20:44] just done it because she loved God. She
[1:20:46] didn't do it for any blessing. She just
[1:20:48] done it. Now, now Elijah said, "Go ask
[1:20:52] her shall I speak to the king for I'm a
[1:20:54] personal friend or the chief captain. I
[1:20:56] know him real well as some favor,
[1:20:58] something I could do for her. I want to
[1:21:00] give her something for a while. She's
[1:21:02] been to me. She's she's fed me. She's
[1:21:04] let me sleep in the beds and and she's
[1:21:06] been real nice to us. Now, what can I
[1:21:08] do?" She said, "No, I just run among my
[1:21:10] people. We're we're well off. We have a
[1:21:12] living and that's all. We don't need
[1:21:13] nothing. And Gahasa said to him, "But
[1:21:16] she doesn't have any children."
[1:21:19] No more. Gahesa saw it. No doubt. The
[1:21:21] prophet saw a vision. For he said, "Thus
[1:21:24] sayeth the Lord, go tell her in the
[1:21:26] appropriate time or the proper time. A
[1:21:28] year from now, she'll embrace a son."
[1:21:31] And the son was born. When he's about 12
[1:21:34] years old how that old couple must have
[1:21:36] loved this little boy, their only child.
[1:21:39] And one day is out cutting wheat with
[1:21:41] his daddy. Must have been about the
[1:21:43] middle of the day. He had a sunstroke, I
[1:21:45] suppose, because if you're going to
[1:21:46] holler in my head, he got sicker and
[1:21:48] sicker. His daddy had to take him from
[1:21:50] the field. And it's such an emergency
[1:21:52] there that he sent a servant, sent him
[1:21:54] in. The mother held him on her lap until
[1:21:56] noon time and he died. Notice her only
[1:22:01] child that had been given to her by the
[1:22:04] Lord through the prayer and the promise
[1:22:07] of a prophet. and thus sayeth the law.
[1:22:10] She know there was something wrong
[1:22:12] somewhere. It just wouldn't work. How
[1:22:15] would God give her that son and let her
[1:22:18] love come to that baby? Yet she never
[1:22:20] asked for it. She was too old to have
[1:22:22] it. The hand of God had to pronounce it.
[1:22:24] A man spoke at the prophet. And there
[1:22:27] this baby in this condition had died,
[1:22:29] her only son.
[1:22:32] So she said to the servant, "Sat on me a
[1:22:35] mule and you ride and don't you stop. If
[1:22:40] anybody's tries to stop me, don't you
[1:22:41] say a word and you drive straight to
[1:22:44] Mount Carmel up there in a cave
[1:22:47] somewhere pulled back. There's a servant
[1:22:49] of the most high God. The one who told
[1:22:51] me thus sayeth the Lord will have the
[1:22:53] baby. I want to know why gods did this."
[1:22:56] So he said, "Go straight forward and
[1:22:59] don't check that new lady mind. This is
[1:23:01] hard as everything's in him. Let him run
[1:23:02] till you get there. Desperation.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet raised up, looked and
[1:23:09] said, "Here comes that shinomite and
[1:23:12] something wrong with her. God's kept it
[1:23:14] from me. I don't know what's wrong."
[1:23:16] Said, "Go beat her." I got hurry.
[1:23:19] There's something wrong. Desperation set
[1:23:21] in on the prophet. Desperation on the
[1:23:23] woman. See, they were coming together.
[1:23:25] One wanting to know what the word of the
[1:23:27] Lord was. The other didn't know what the
[1:23:28] word of the Lord was.
[1:23:30] There you are. One to know it, the other
[1:23:32] didn't know it. The woman wanted to know
[1:23:34] it, and the prophet didn't know it.
[1:23:36] Said, "God's kept it for me. I don't
[1:23:38] know what to tell her when she gets
[1:23:39] here." So, she's almost there. Then he
[1:23:42] raised up his hand. He said, "Is all
[1:23:44] well with thee? All well with the
[1:23:46] husband? Is all well with the child?"
[1:23:48] Now, the woman had reached the end of
[1:23:51] her desperation.
[1:23:53] She said, "All is well."
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; All is well. Her desperation's over. She
[1:24:05] had found the servant of the Lord.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; If you had been there, she's still been
[1:24:10] in desperation.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; But you see, he was there. She said,
[1:24:14] "All is well."
[1:24:17] Elijah thought, "Well, what's going on
[1:24:19] now?" So, she run up and fell down at
[1:24:21] his feet. That looked kind of uncommon.
[1:24:23] So, Gahesa just lifted her up. Said,
[1:24:26] "Let her alone. Don't do that.
[1:24:29] Elijah said to his servant, "Don't do
[1:24:31] that. Let alone there's something wrong.
[1:24:33] God keeps it from him." Then she
[1:24:35] revealed to him that the baby was dead.
[1:24:38] Now the prophet didn't know what to do.
[1:24:39] He said, "Ghesa, take this staff that
[1:24:42] I've walked on." He know that whatever
[1:24:44] he touched was blessed
[1:24:46] cuz it wasn't him. It was God in him. He
[1:24:50] knew who he was. He knew that he was a
[1:24:53] prophet. So he picks up this staff and
[1:24:55] said, "Gesa, you take this and you go
[1:24:59] and lay it upon the child. If anybody
[1:25:02] speaks to you, you get desperate.
[1:25:05] Don't you sleep nobody and let go. Just
[1:25:07] keep going on. Don't speak to nobody.
[1:25:09] Put it up on the child." But the woman,
[1:25:12] that didn't end her desperation. That
[1:25:15] didn't satisfy what she come for. She
[1:25:17] said, "As the Lord God lives, I'm I'm
[1:25:20] not going to leave you until you go
[1:25:22] minister to the child."
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; And Elijah got desperate. Here he went
[1:25:30] down the road, him and the woman. And
[1:25:32] when they got there, the all the people
[1:25:34] were out in the yard screaming and
[1:25:35] crying. And the woman had done the most
[1:25:38] appropriate thing could be done. She
[1:25:39] tucked the baby and laid him on the bed
[1:25:41] where Elijah had laid him.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; That was as good as that. and he didn't
[1:25:46] wake up there so the thing wouldn't
[1:25:48] work. She wanted to know something
[1:25:50] different. The prophet went in now he's
[1:25:53] in desperation. Now what's he going to
[1:25:55] do? And we find that the Bible and he
[1:25:58] walked up and down the floor.
[1:26:01] Desperate. I don't know nothing else to
[1:26:04] do, Lord. Yeah, I am. You told me to
[1:26:07] speak back to that woman. And thus
[1:26:09] sayeth the Lord is exactly the way I
[1:26:11] told her because you told me. Now there
[1:26:14] she's in trouble and I don't know what
[1:26:16] to do. There lays a dead boy. What can I
[1:26:18] do, Lord? No doubt the Holy Spirit said,
[1:26:21] "If the God is in you, then lay yourself
[1:26:23] on the baby." First thing you know, he
[1:26:25] stopped, run, put his hands upon his
[1:26:27] hands, his nose upon its nose, his lips
[1:26:30] upon its lips. And when he laid himself
[1:26:32] over, the baby sneezed seven times.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Desperation was over.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. The baby come to life
[1:26:41] because of desperation drove the woman
[1:26:44] to the prophet and desperation drove the
[1:26:46] prophet to the baby
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; and desperation both of them drove God
[1:26:50] on the scene
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; with love of God and love for his people
[1:26:54] brought the love of God down and throw
[1:26:56] faith out on the battlefront and the
[1:26:58] work was done
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; case closed. Amen. That said desperation
[1:27:03] does it. Certainly she wasn't going to
[1:27:06] leave. Blind Barnameus
[1:27:09] thought Jesus was going to pass him by
[1:27:12] sitting out there at the gate blind
[1:27:15] beggar for arms. The first thing you
[1:27:17] know he heard a noise. Jesus is passing
[1:27:20] by. He said who passes by? Somebody
[1:27:22] shoved him down. He said please
[1:27:24] somebody. Who's passing by? One of them
[1:27:27] maybe a kind little disciple woman said
[1:27:29] to him said sir
[1:27:32] don't you know who that is passing by?
[1:27:34] No. I hear some of them say there's a
[1:27:35] whole graveyard full of dead people up
[1:27:37] here. If you raise the dead, go raise
[1:27:38] them. Is it a blasphemer or somebody?
[1:27:41] No. Have you ever heard of that prophet
[1:27:44] of Galilee, that young prophet called
[1:27:46] Jesus of Nazareth? No. Well, you know in
[1:27:48] the Bible it says in our scrolls that
[1:27:51] the son of David will be raised up to
[1:27:53] settle. That's him. Is that him?
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Is that him? But he's passing by.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Desperation drove him to scream.
[1:28:05] Oh Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy
[1:28:08] upon me.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Pass me not, oh gentle savior. Hear my
[1:28:13] humble cry. While all others are
[1:28:15] calling, do not pass me by.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, some of them said, "Shut up.
[1:28:21] You make too much noise." But he was
[1:28:23] desperate.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; If he got by, he might never have
[1:28:26] another opportunity.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; We might not either. That's right.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; This might be the last night.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Desperation, he screamed out. Oh Jesus.
[1:28:36] No matter who told him to stop, he cried
[1:28:39] just the same. That much more louder.
[1:28:41] When they told him to shut up and made
[1:28:43] him get louder. He was desperate. Nobody
[1:28:46] could stop him. Thou son of David, have
[1:28:50] mercy on me. And he screamed in
[1:28:52] desperation. And the son of God with the
[1:28:55] sins of the world upon his shoulders
[1:28:57] going to Jerusalem to be offered up
[1:28:59] right then for a sacrifice for the world
[1:29:02] stopped in his tracks.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Desperation,
[1:29:06] a desparing cry stopped the son of God.
[1:29:10] Said, "What would you have me do for
[1:29:12] him?" Oh, said, "Lord, that I might
[1:29:15] receive my sight." Said, "Go your way.
[1:29:17] Your faith saves you."
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; That was enough.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Desperation. When desperation is to
[1:29:24] receive something, the faintest little
[1:29:26] touch, faith grabs it.
[1:29:29] You just said, "Now, wait a minute. Wait
[1:29:30] a minute. Hold on. Just let me see if I
[1:29:31] can see now. I don't see my hands for
[1:29:33] many years. Let's see if I can see it."
[1:29:34] I don't see nothing yet. When Jesus
[1:29:37] said, "Thy faith has saved thee." That
[1:29:40] was enough.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; That's all he wanted. Desperation calls
[1:29:46] for a subject. And when the subject, no
[1:29:48] matter how faith it is, it's received.
[1:29:51] It's believed right there because faith
[1:29:53] catches when desperation is pushing it.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; See, love in there, mixes with it, and
[1:29:58] brings it to it. Desperation does. Blind
[1:30:01] Barnameus caught the vision quickly.
[1:30:04] Peter is all steamed up one night on the
[1:30:08] sea when he got in desperation and he
[1:30:11] begin to cry out, "There's something
[1:30:13] wrong. I see a spirit come walking to
[1:30:16] me." The ship was about to go down. He
[1:30:19] said, "If it be you, Lord, let me come
[1:30:21] to you on the water and he stepped down
[1:30:24] out of the ship and started." And he got
[1:30:26] scared when he got started. And he
[1:30:28] started to sink in desperation,
[1:30:31] though a mistake in trying to follow the
[1:30:34] commandments of God.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; I hope the church gets it.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; The man was doing what God told him to
[1:30:44] do.
[1:30:46] Now you Christians tonight, you're in
[1:30:48] the line of duty trying to follow the
[1:30:52] leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; and a cancer grabs you or a a death
[1:30:58] grabs you, a cancer, tumor, whatever it
[1:31:00] is. In the line of duty, you have the
[1:31:03] same right that Peter had.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, save the oral perish. Desperation
[1:31:10] called out and a hand reached and picked
[1:31:12] him up.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; You have the same name, but he screamed
[1:31:19] out, "Save me, Lord."
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; He heard my desparing cry from the
[1:31:26] waters lifted me. Now, safe am I. Praise
[1:31:30] the Lord.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; That's it. When you cry out, maybe this
[1:31:33] woman, mother, whatever it was to her
[1:31:35] little son or grandson or nephew,
[1:31:38] whatever it was, cried out in despair,
[1:31:41] got hurt.
[1:31:43] Then we find out that in the sinking God
[1:31:47] he hurt him. In the line of duty he
[1:31:49] started to sink. He failed. No matter if
[1:31:53] you fail that don't have nothing to do
[1:31:54] with it. We all fail. We're failure to
[1:31:58] begin with. But we got somebody standing
[1:32:00] down with a strong hand who can reach us
[1:32:03] and take us above the water.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; If you made a mistake, some woman made a
[1:32:08] mistake. Some man made a mistake. Some
[1:32:10] boy girl made a mistake. Don't sink.
[1:32:13] Scream out
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; in the spirit of the Lord. Save me or
[1:32:17] I'll perish.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Get desperate about it. God will hear
[1:32:21] you. He always hears a desperate soul.
[1:32:23] That's what I'm trying to tell you
[1:32:24] about.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Our dear Lord, Jesus himself in the
[1:32:29] world's greatest battleground,
[1:32:32] Gethsemane.
[1:32:34] He cried out in despair.
[1:32:38] Should he take the sins of the world? Or
[1:32:41] should he just remain on earth with his
[1:32:44] beloved disciples? What he wanted to do?
[1:32:47] But what's his humility as he humbled
[1:32:50] himself? Not my will but thine be done.
[1:32:54] Humbled himself to the word, the
[1:32:55] promised word of the God of heaven.
[1:32:58] Notice then he went a little further.
[1:33:01] And if he went a little further, how
[1:33:03] much more ought we to go a little
[1:33:05] farther?
[1:33:06] And notice the scripture says here in
[1:33:08] Luke that he prayed earnestly.
[1:33:13] Brother and sister,
[1:33:15] if Jesus had to pray earnestly, how much
[1:33:17] more have we got to pray earnestly?
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; If Christ the God of heaven made flesh
[1:33:26] had to pray earnestly, then how much
[1:33:29] more are we sinners saved by grace? Pray
[1:33:32] earnestly.
[1:33:35] [Music]
[1:33:36] If if the decision
[1:33:40] throw the son of God into despair,
[1:33:44] what will it do to you and I?
[1:33:46] Desperately, we must cry. God in these
[1:33:49] last days has manifested himself so to
[1:33:52] us by his great signs and power should
[1:33:55] make us desperate. That's right.
[1:33:58] and is willing to heal us and save us or
[1:34:01] to throw us all into desperation to get
[1:34:03] to that healing stone.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. Look, if Florence
[1:34:09] Nightingale,
[1:34:11] the great granddaughter of the late
[1:34:13] Florence Nightingale that founded the
[1:34:15] Red Cross, you see her picture in the
[1:34:17] book, weighed about 30 lbs. Cancered eat
[1:34:20] her up in London, England. They brought
[1:34:22] her from Africa, London, England. And
[1:34:25] there in despair,
[1:34:28] brother Boss wrote back to her and said,
[1:34:30] "We can't come to Africa." She wrote
[1:34:33] back, I had to nurse her right and said,
[1:34:35] "I can't be moved. I can't do it."
[1:34:39] Showed the picture. You've seen the
[1:34:40] picture.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Only we had to put a little piece over
[1:34:42] it. It just had a small card around. I
[1:34:45] thought maybe somebody putting the book
[1:34:46] might criticize because she was her body
[1:34:48] was so exposed there. And we put a
[1:34:51] little thing across her here. She just
[1:34:53] had a a little rag towel laying across
[1:34:55] across her hips. But up above there was
[1:34:58] nothing. And even but we thought we put
[1:35:00] a little piece of paper in there and
[1:35:01] photographed the photograph back to
[1:35:03] keeps people who not got right kind of a
[1:35:06] position in their mind thinking that
[1:35:08] they wouldn't criticize me putting that
[1:35:10] picture in paper. And then when the
[1:35:14] doctor said that she can't even move and
[1:35:17] she knowed I was going to visit England,
[1:35:19] she had them to put her on a stretcher
[1:35:23] and pack her to a plane and bring her to
[1:35:26] London, England and send a guard out to
[1:35:29] the plane before going down to
[1:35:30] Buckingham Palace. Send a guard out
[1:35:32] there to come pray for her. And she was
[1:35:35] so far gone
[1:35:37] until she couldn't even speak to me they
[1:35:41] had to raise her hands to put it in
[1:35:43] mine.
[1:35:45] You know how London is some of you
[1:35:46] soldiers been there. It's always so
[1:35:48] foggy
[1:35:49] and I knelt down there by the side of a
[1:35:51] window and she the tears running off.
[1:35:55] She wanted to I don't know how she even
[1:35:58] got enough moisture to let tears come.
[1:36:01] It's just only bone skin over and her
[1:36:05] her legs up here at the hips wasn't over
[1:36:07] about looked to me like about 2 in
[1:36:09] across or 3 in her veins was collapsed.
[1:36:12] How she's living I don't know. You've
[1:36:14] seen her picture later. I knelt down by
[1:36:17] the side of the bed. Now she was
[1:36:20] desperate. Whether I could come or not,
[1:36:22] they're going to bring her anyhow.
[1:36:25] And I got down there. My heart was a
[1:36:28] bleeding within me. uh the faith of that
[1:36:30] poor little dying creature and I prayed
[1:36:34] with all the heart that I had and while
[1:36:36] I started to pray a little turtle come
[1:36:38] through on the window be to walk up and
[1:36:41] down could I thought it was a pet I
[1:36:44] hadn't been in England about an hour
[1:36:46] just coming from the airport down there
[1:36:48] and I thought it was a pet and when I
[1:36:50] raised up said amen it flew away and I
[1:36:53] started to ask the brethren did they
[1:36:56] hear that dove and they were talking
[1:36:57] about it And when I start to say that
[1:37:00] you see what that devil means to come
[1:37:02] out, thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; you'll live and not die.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; She's living today.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Desperation. Amen. Desperation
[1:37:14] drove the woman to take a stand. Glory
[1:37:18] to God.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Desperation.
[1:37:22] A race that she got there at the same
[1:37:24] time I did. And a token from God. He
[1:37:26] sent a dove to give thus.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Desperate.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; When Sister Hetty Waldro of Phoenix,
[1:37:35] Arizona,
[1:37:37] she's coming up the sidewalk in my first
[1:37:39] meeting. The intern and her husband is
[1:37:42] bringing her cancer of the heart.
[1:37:44] She made her stand to try to get there
[1:37:46] to the meeting, but she was so bad she
[1:37:50] was couldn't breathe no more. The blood
[1:37:51] is dropped back to her heart. Well, the
[1:37:53] cancer eat into her heart. a cancer of
[1:37:56] the heart.
[1:37:58] That's about 18, 19 years ago, maybe 20.
[1:38:02] 1947 is when it was now.
[1:38:06] She said to her husband and turn, "If
[1:38:09] no, I die in this line. Take me up
[1:38:12] there."
[1:38:14] Desperation.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; She lost conscious. I don't think she
[1:38:18] was dead. She claimed she was. Now, she
[1:38:20] might have been. She may hear this tape
[1:38:21] and see now I I I she claimed she was
[1:38:25] dead. I don't know. They told me she's a
[1:38:27] dead woman coming up the line. And when
[1:38:29] the woman come by, she was lifeless.
[1:38:33] And when they brought her up there, the
[1:38:35] word of the Lord came and I went and
[1:38:38] laid hands up on her and she rose up
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; and went home walking.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; This has been about I'd say safely 18
[1:38:48] years ago. And she's just as healthy and
[1:38:51] hotty. She'll be at Tucson to meet me
[1:38:54] when I get down there.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Desperation going on the road till we
[1:39:01] get down there.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; He healed others. He'll heal me,
[1:39:05] willing.
[1:39:07] Let our hearts be filled with love in
[1:39:08] this day. That be earnest in a
[1:39:11] desperation. After a while, it may be
[1:39:13] too late. Jas one time had a little
[1:39:16] daughter that was dying. He was a
[1:39:19] borderline believer. He believed Jesus,
[1:39:21] but he's afraid to confess it because
[1:39:23] they put him out of the synagogue. But
[1:39:26] the doctor come one morning and says,
[1:39:28] "She's dying now." Desperation set in.
[1:39:32] He couldn't afford as his position to be
[1:39:35] caught with Jesus of Nazareth because
[1:39:38] he'd lose his position as a priest. But
[1:39:41] I'll tell you, when emergency come, it
[1:39:43] throw him to desperation. I can see him
[1:39:45] hunting for his little preacher's coat
[1:39:47] and hat and slipped it on. Here he come
[1:39:49] down through the crowd, pressing around
[1:39:50] where there's a woman just touched his
[1:39:52] garment and so forth. And there's all
[1:39:53] shout, but he went and said, "Master, my
[1:39:55] little girl's laying at the point of
[1:39:56] death. Master, master, my little girl's
[1:40:00] laying at the point of death." And if
[1:40:01] you just come lay your hands on her,
[1:40:03] she'll live. Oh my. Desperation makes
[1:40:05] you say things sometimes. Makes you do
[1:40:07] things. It puts you into action. His
[1:40:10] daughter was saved by the desperation.
[1:40:14] Let's be desperate. Like that little
[1:40:15] woman with a blood issue. The Bible said
[1:40:17] she'd spent all of her money with the
[1:40:19] physicians and yet they couldn't help
[1:40:21] her. She starting time of menopause to
[1:40:24] flooding and a blood issue and they
[1:40:27] wouldn't stop. They maybe stole the
[1:40:29] farm, the mules, the horses, whatever it
[1:40:31] was. And nothing could help her. And
[1:40:33] their priest had told her never go
[1:40:35] around such as that. But one morning she
[1:40:37] looked down. She lived up on the bank up
[1:40:39] there where a farm was and she seen a
[1:40:41] great bunch of people gathered around a
[1:40:43] man down there and they said, "What is
[1:40:44] that?" Said, "That's Jesus of Nazareth."
[1:40:46] Desperation said in
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; she said, "I'm kind of insignificant. I
[1:40:51] But if I can only touch the border of
[1:40:54] his garment, I'll be made well."
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; And she passed by every critic and
[1:40:59] everything else. But then she got to the
[1:41:02] spot. She touched his garment in
[1:41:05] desperation. And when he did, he turned
[1:41:08] and said, "Who touched me?"
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; And they all denied it. But he looked
[1:41:13] around. He was possessed with a great
[1:41:15] gift of God. He was God. And he found
[1:41:18] the little woman and told her blessed
[1:41:20] issue had stopped.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Desperation drove her to do that. It was
[1:41:25] desperation. The girl drove the queen of
[1:41:27] the south. She heard that the gift of
[1:41:30] God was working through Solomon.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Desperation drove her to that.
[1:41:35] desperately. That's human beings like
[1:41:39] you, like me. They wasn't any different
[1:41:42] from you and I. They had five senses to
[1:41:44] eat and drink and so forth like we do.
[1:41:46] Live and die. They were human beings. It
[1:41:50] drove her into such desperation till she
[1:41:52] took part of her kingdom.
[1:41:55] It drove her to a place that she didn't
[1:41:56] think about that Ishelites would rob her
[1:41:59] on the desert. Her 90 days on the back
[1:42:02] of a camel across the Sahara Desert.
[1:42:05] desperation. She's going anyhow.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; And when she got there, there was
[1:42:10] nothing help from Solomon but what he
[1:42:12] told her. The things that she wanted to
[1:42:13] know. Desperation. Jesus said she'll
[1:42:16] rise in the day of the judgment, but
[1:42:18] this generation condemnth
[1:42:20] are greater than Solomon this year.
[1:42:22] Desperation.
[1:42:24] In closing, I might say this.
[1:42:30] Not long ago down in Mexico, I seen
[1:42:32] something desperate. I just got to the
[1:42:35] platform there in a big arena and people
[1:42:38] been there since 9:00 that morning and
[1:42:40] it's nearly 10:00 that night. An old
[1:42:42] blind man the night before totally blind
[1:42:45] for about 30 years received his sight.
[1:42:47] Was going around the city that day
[1:42:48] testifying
[1:42:50] and all a rick of clothes laying for
[1:42:53] maybe 30 40 yards that high. this old
[1:42:56] shaws there maybe 40 50,000 people there
[1:42:59] and old hats and shawls who they belong
[1:43:01] to I guess they have to decide that
[1:43:03] among them they're pouring down rain and
[1:43:06] they let me down a rope over a wall I
[1:43:08] got on the platform the min the man that
[1:43:11] sat here that brought in him and his
[1:43:13] daughter come down from Michigan a few
[1:43:15] minutes ago talked about brother A we
[1:43:18] remember him here he's on the streets of
[1:43:20] glory tonight brother A was there and
[1:43:22] took his over coat off and stood in the
[1:43:25] and give it to brother Jack Moore to put
[1:43:27] on because Jack was shivering a
[1:43:28] southerner who's about to freeze that
[1:43:30] cold rain there in Mexico and there he
[1:43:32] was standing there and really Paul come
[1:43:35] to me my son said daddy you'll have to
[1:43:37] do something there's a little Mexican
[1:43:38] woman down there with a dead baby that
[1:43:40] died this morning I ain't got enough
[1:43:42] ushers to hold her out of the line
[1:43:46] laying hands on that blind man give me
[1:43:48] sight laying hands on her dead baby but
[1:43:50] give it sign she was a Catholic
[1:43:55] And she they couldn't hold her back. And
[1:43:58] brother Espinosa told her that we have
[1:44:00] no more prayer cards. You'll have to
[1:44:02] wait till another night. She said, "My
[1:44:04] baby's dead. It's been dead since this
[1:44:05] morning. I must get in there."
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; And she was coming prayer card or not.
[1:44:10] And they lined up about 300 ushers there
[1:44:12] and she'd go right on her legs and jump
[1:44:14] up on top of her backs and run with this
[1:44:15] dead baby and fall down among them. Did
[1:44:17] it make any difference to her? She was
[1:44:18] trying to get there. She was desperate.
[1:44:21] God had spoke to her heart that God
[1:44:23] could give sight to give life.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my, she was desperate. Something was
[1:44:28] burning in her.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Oh sick people, you let that burn in you
[1:44:32] for a few minutes. Watch what happens.
[1:44:34] That kind of a desperation. Amen. The
[1:44:37] God that could heal this little boy the
[1:44:39] other night could heal that day of
[1:44:40] cancer, heal this man, this park, get
[1:44:43] all the tens of thousands. He that
[1:44:46] undisputable evidence raising the dead
[1:44:49] and healing the sick and everything
[1:44:51] else. If he's God can do that, he's God
[1:44:53] yesterday, he's God today.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; You're desperate. Then you'll get
[1:44:58] something done. Then in that
[1:45:00] desperation, she kept rushing. I said to
[1:45:03] brother Jack Moore, I said, "She don't
[1:45:05] know me. She's never seen me. She don't
[1:45:07] know who it is up here on the platform."
[1:45:08] That little Catholic woman couldn't
[1:45:11] speak a word of English. How does she
[1:45:12] know who it is? I said roll down, pray
[1:45:14] for the baby, and that'll satisfy and
[1:45:15] she'll go on. Said they won't call. It's
[1:45:18] just constant roller down there. She'd
[1:45:19] jump up and everybody be screaming.
[1:45:21] She'd run over top her shoulders and
[1:45:22] fall right down on them. She'd gain a
[1:45:24] few feet and then they try to put her
[1:45:25] back out and here she come right through
[1:45:26] the lace homeless baby upset users and
[1:45:29] everything else. They make her she's
[1:45:30] getting up there. She had to get there.
[1:45:33] It don't make a difference what it was.
[1:45:35] She's going to get there. Had to
[1:45:36] minister. Now, isn't that just a story
[1:45:38] like the Schumanite woman? Only that
[1:45:40] wasn't 3,500 years ago. That was about
[1:45:42] three years ago or four. See, they can
[1:45:45] be the same thing tonight. When the same
[1:45:47] desperation rises, I'll throw love and
[1:45:50] faith up there to the battlefront to
[1:45:52] claim what you want.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Because it's a promise of God that you
[1:45:55] can have it.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; I turned me the minister, the evangelist
[1:46:02] at the place, I turned. I felt sorry for
[1:46:06] the woman, but there's no desperation.
[1:46:08] See, I turned and thought, well, your
[1:46:10] brother Jack will pray for her and that
[1:46:12] that settles it. I turned. I said, as I
[1:46:14] was speaking, now Faith looked out there
[1:46:17] and there was a vision. I seen a little
[1:46:19] baby sitting a little blackfaced Mexican
[1:46:21] baby with no teeth. It was laughing at
[1:46:24] me, sitting out there. I said, "Wait a
[1:46:26] minute. Wait a minute." Her desperation
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; drove the Holy Spirit to Jesus.
[1:46:36] Jesus,
[1:46:37] show me her baby. Sitting there and sent
[1:46:40] the spirit back.
[1:46:43] I said, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[1:46:45] Bring me the baby." Here she come with a
[1:46:47] little wet soaking blue and white
[1:46:49] blanket, a little dead form about that
[1:46:51] long. She fell with a crucifix in her
[1:46:53] hand or a rosary to say these Hail
[1:46:55] Marys. I told her, "Put it up. That's
[1:46:57] not necessary. And she come up close to
[1:47:00] where I was and she spinning hard.
[1:47:01] Padre, which means father. I said,
[1:47:03] "Don't say that. Don't say that. Do you
[1:47:06] believe?" And he said it in Spanish to
[1:47:08] her. Did she believe? Yes, she believed.
[1:47:10] He asked her, "How would she believe?"
[1:47:12] She said, "If God can give that old man
[1:47:15] his sight, he can give my baby the
[1:47:17] life."
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Desperation to it.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Not a thing on my part. I just saw the
[1:47:26] vision. And I said, "Lord Jesus, I saw a
[1:47:29] vision of a little baby. It might be
[1:47:31] this one about that time." He kicked it.
[1:47:33] [Applause]
[1:47:35] I said, "Follow her to the doctor. Get a
[1:47:37] rap written statement from the doctor.
[1:47:39] That baby died." And the doctor wrote
[1:47:41] the statement, "That baby's respiration
[1:47:44] heart stopped this morning in my office
[1:47:46] at 9:00. Die with double pneumonia."
[1:47:51] Oh, the babies are living in Mexico
[1:47:53] tonight, as far as I know.
[1:47:55] The desperation sitting on a little
[1:47:58] mother's heart, crying for her child
[1:48:00] that had seen God do heal a man's blind
[1:48:03] eye and know he could raise a dead baby.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Desperation. When thou seekest me with
[1:48:10] all thine heart, they're not hearing.
[1:48:13] See the kingdom, the law, and the
[1:48:16] prophets were until John. Since then,
[1:48:19] the kingdom of heaven's been preached,
[1:48:20] and man press into it.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't just stand up and
[1:48:25] say, "Pick me up with the collar, Lord.
[1:48:27] Push me in." You press into it.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; You get desperate
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; between life and death.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Wish I had time for another story, but I
[1:48:39] was thinking right now of a woman, a
[1:48:41] girl dug a wrong road and how she turned
[1:48:44] new pages and things. I said, "Sister,"
[1:48:46] she got up and said, "I I believe I'll
[1:48:48] be all right." I said, "No, no, stay
[1:48:50] there." Then first thing you know she
[1:48:52] started praying a little bit and
[1:48:53] directly she got louder and louder after
[1:48:55] a while she got desperate said oh God
[1:48:58] save me
[1:49:00] alcohol synonymous couldn't cure it
[1:49:03] nothing else could do it but that big
[1:49:05] black eyes looked at me the tears
[1:49:06] dropped over her cheek something's
[1:49:08] happened
[1:49:09] yes sir
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; something happened she got desperate
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; let's be desperate about this between
[1:49:17] death and life
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; you can't get desperate don't come
[1:49:20] through here. If you are desperate, come
[1:49:22] here and watch you. You'll get it as
[1:49:24] soon as you get here.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Let us pray.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; In desperation,
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; watch for the kingdom of God. It'll come
[1:49:37] up on you.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; And we thank God for the word.
[1:49:50] We can give the Lord a hand of praise
[1:49:51] for his word.
[1:49:54] [Applause]
[1:49:59] As we prepare to go to the table of the
[1:50:01] Lord,
[1:50:02] let us sing that song. All is well. All
[1:50:07] is well.
[1:50:09] [Music]
[1:50:12] All is well.
[1:50:19] All is well
[1:50:26] we have heard
[1:50:29] message shalom
[1:50:33] all is well
[1:50:40] for
[1:50:43] bless
[1:50:45] Perfect
[1:50:46] breast
[1:50:49] [Music]
[1:51:00] for all is well.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; How many believe that all is well?
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, she was at the very
[1:51:09] darkest time of her life
[1:51:12] and she went through all the trouble to
[1:51:15] get her dead baby to the prophet and the
[1:51:18] prophet asked her, "Is all well?" And
[1:51:22] she said, "All is well."
[1:51:24] And we have that testimony tonight. Is
[1:51:26] that right?
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:32] Corinthians chapter 15. Let's all turn
[1:51:35] there as we go to the uh table of
[1:51:38] Corinthians 11. Sorry. We'll stand to
[1:51:41] our feet.
[1:51:57] Of course, everyone is welcome. I know
[1:52:00] that
[1:52:02] we have visitors here tonight and if
[1:52:04] they wasn't prepared to take the supper
[1:52:07] that's fine
[1:52:09] but the Lord is good to us.
[1:52:13] 1 Corinthians 11
[1:52:17] verse 23.
[1:52:19] For I have received of the Lord that
[1:52:22] which also I delivered unto you, that
[1:52:24] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[1:52:27] he was betrayed, he took bread, and when
[1:52:29] he had given thanks, he broke it and he
[1:52:32] said, "Take, eat. This is my body which
[1:52:35] is broken for you. This do in
[1:52:37] remembrance of me." And when he uh and
[1:52:41] after the same manner also he took the
[1:52:43] cup and when he had sucked, saying,
[1:52:45] "This cup is the new testament in my
[1:52:48] blood. This do ye as often as you drink
[1:52:52] it in remembrance of me. For as often as
[1:52:54] you eat this bread and drink this cup,
[1:52:57] you do show the Lord's death till he
[1:53:00] come. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat
[1:53:02] this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:53:04] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:53:07] body and blood of the Lord. But let a
[1:53:09] man examine himself, and so let him eat
[1:53:11] of that bread, and drink of that cup.
[1:53:14] For he that eateth and drinkkeeth
[1:53:15] unworthily, eateth and drinkkeeth
[1:53:18] damnation to himself, not discerning the
[1:53:21] Lord's body. For this cause many are
[1:53:24] weak and sickly among you, and many
[1:53:26] sleep. For if we would judge ourselves,
[1:53:28] we should not be judged. But when we are
[1:53:31] judged, we are chasened of the Lord,
[1:53:34] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:53:36] world. Wherefore, my brethren, when you
[1:53:39] come together to eat, tear one for
[1:53:42] another. If any man hunger, let him eat
[1:53:45] at home, that you come not together unto
[1:53:47] condemnation, and the rest will I set in
[1:53:50] order when I come.
[1:53:53] Amen. So, we'd like to take a moment to
[1:53:57] pray for one another. You pray for me,
[1:54:00] I'll pray for you. Pray for the one next
[1:54:03] to you, behind you.
[1:54:05] Pray for your families. Pray for the
[1:54:09] church and all the needs in the body of
[1:54:12] Christ that you can think of. Someone
[1:54:15] that is not here, pray for them. Someone
[1:54:18] on your heart, in your mind, pray for
[1:54:20] them. Pray for me. I'll pray for you.
[1:54:23] Let's all pray for one another. Silent
[1:54:26] prayer.
[1:54:59] Heavenly Father, in my hands I hold this
[1:55:02] bread that was made for this service,
[1:55:04] Lord. It was prepared
[1:55:09] without any leaven, Lord.
[1:55:12] And it was prepared for this service
[1:55:16] that represents your body. It is not
[1:55:18] your body. It represents your body. It's
[1:55:21] a symbol. You commanded us to do it. And
[1:55:26] Lord, we do it in obedience to you. And
[1:55:30] because of that obedience, Lord, there's
[1:55:32] a blessing when we partake. We believe
[1:55:35] there's a promise. And we pray, Father,
[1:55:38] that all that partake, as they examine
[1:55:41] their lives, may you bless them. and may
[1:55:46] the blessings that come with the
[1:55:48] obedience
[1:55:50] and all the types and shadows of the
[1:55:52] lamb in the Old Testament
[1:55:55] giving strength to the bodies for the
[1:55:57] travelers the clothes didn't even wear
[1:56:00] out Lord the prophet of God said the
[1:56:03] spiritual and physical strength
[1:56:07] is in these oracles tonight and Lord we
[1:56:12] receive that by faith We ask you bless
[1:56:16] it for this service in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:56:25] Heavenly Father, in my hands I hold the
[1:56:27] cup of the New Testament of your blood,
[1:56:30] the blood of the grapes.
[1:56:32] The grape was pressed. It was squeezed
[1:56:34] and the life was taken out and it
[1:56:38] produced the blood of the grape. It goes
[1:56:41] through the process to ferment.
[1:56:44] Life returns back into it
[1:56:48] and it has a stimulation.
[1:56:51] And Lord Jesus, it's a type of your
[1:56:54] blood
[1:56:56] that was shed at Calvary.
[1:56:59] And Lord, we bless the cup. We bless the
[1:57:01] wine. We bless these elements. And may
[1:57:04] everyone that partake of it, Lord, not
[1:57:06] be a formal or a form or tradition, but
[1:57:11] may it be life unto us as we receive it,
[1:57:14] Lord.
[1:57:16] So many testimonies of healing after
[1:57:20] this service. And Lord, may others even
[1:57:23] tonight be healed as they partake of the
[1:57:27] bread and the wine. Lord, you served
[1:57:30] this to Abraham after he delivered Lot
[1:57:33] and Melzdc. And Lord, we are here
[1:57:37] tonight for you to serve it to us
[1:57:40] tonight. Bread and wine. May each one
[1:57:43] that partake receive the blessing. I ask
[1:57:47] the blessing on the cup in Jesus name.
[1:57:49] Amen. You be seated. Please follow the
[1:57:53] directions of the usher.
[1:57:59] Okay.

[2:10:18] This portion of bread that remains will
[2:10:20] be burnt with fire before the rising of
[2:10:23] the sun. Amen. Let's stand. Take our
[2:10:26] Bibles
[2:10:28] and turn into St. John
[2:10:31] chapter 13.
[2:10:38] I had lunch by myself today
[2:10:41] and um
[2:10:43] just fulfilling a gift card that we had
[2:10:47] and I saw some saints from one of the
[2:10:49] churches here in town.
[2:10:52] And after I got ready to leave, I sat
[2:10:56] down and and spoke with them just a
[2:10:58] little bit. They called me to come and
[2:10:59] sit down. And after we fellowshipped a
[2:11:02] little bit and they said, "Brother
[2:11:04] Israel, Brother Paul, we want you to
[2:11:06] know that we love you
[2:11:08] and we believe the message."
[2:11:11] They wanted me to know that they believe
[2:11:13] the message. So I said,
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, it's so good to hear
[2:11:16] that. I I like hearing that."
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. St. John chapter 13 verse two
[2:11:23] supper being ended the devil having now
[2:11:26] put into the heart of Judas's scariot
[2:11:28] Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing
[2:11:32] that the father had given all things
[2:11:33] into his hands and that he was come from
[2:11:36] God and went to God he riseth from
[2:11:38] supper he laid aside his garments he
[2:11:41] took a towel and girded himself after
[2:11:44] that he poured water into a basin and
[2:11:47] began to wash the disciples eat and to
[2:11:50] wipe them with the towel wherewith he
[2:11:52] was girded.
[2:11:54] Then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter
[2:11:56] saith unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my
[2:11:59] feet? Jesus answered and said unto him,
[2:12:03] what I do, thou knowest not now, but
[2:12:06] thou shalt know hereafter? Peter saith
[2:12:08] unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet.
[2:12:12] Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not,
[2:12:15] thou hast no part with me. Simon Peter
[2:12:19] saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only,
[2:12:22] but also my hands and my head. Jesus
[2:12:25] said to him, he that is washed needeth
[2:12:28] not safe to wash his feet, but is clean
[2:12:31] every wit, and ye are clean, but not
[2:12:33] all. For he knew who should betray him.
[2:12:36] Therefore said he, ye are not all clean.
[2:12:40] So after he had washed their feet, had
[2:12:42] taken his garments, and sat down again,
[2:12:45] he said unto them, "Know ye what I have
[2:12:48] done to you? You call me Master and
[2:12:51] Lord, and you say, well, for so I am. If
[2:12:55] I then, your Lord and Master, have
[2:12:57] washed your feet, you also ought to wash
[2:13:00] one another's feet. For I have given you
[2:13:04] an example, that you should do as I have
[2:13:08] done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto
[2:13:11] you, the servant is not greater than his
[2:13:13] Lord, neither he that is sent, greater
[2:13:16] than he that sent him. If you know these
[2:13:19] things, happy are ye if you do them. So
[2:13:23] the Lord gives us an example. And we're
[2:13:26] not greater than our Lord.
[2:13:28] If the Lord washed the disciples feet,
[2:13:31] we're not greater than our Lord.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; And he said, "You'll be happy if you do
[2:13:35] that." So, we're happy to do that. Let's
[2:13:37] sing. There's like three songs that
[2:13:39] Brother Brother Man referenced on that
[2:13:41] tape there. They were all hymns. All is
[2:13:44] well with the Shunomite, Pass Me Not, O
[2:13:46] Gentle Savior with the the Blind Man.
[2:13:50] And then he quoted Love Lifted Me. So,
[2:13:53] let's sing a little bit of that. Love
[2:13:55] lifted me. As before we dismiss, the
[2:13:58] sisters will go to the room next door.
[2:14:00] The brothers will remain. I was singing
[2:14:06] and said far from the peaceful sure
[2:14:15] we sang within
[2:14:18] seeking to rise. Oh
[2:14:24] my
[2:14:26] god.
[2:14:33] [Music]
[2:14:40] Now say
[2:14:43] I receive on your heart.
[2:14:48] [Music]
[2:14:50] Oh, love
[2:14:53] that.
[2:14:57] And when
[2:14:59] nothing else could help
[2:15:06] me,
[2:15:09] love
[2:15:11] me.
[2:15:13] Yes, it was lovely
[2:15:20] when
[2:15:22] nothing else
[2:15:29] lifted
[2:15:31] me.
[2:15:34] And all my heart
[2:15:38] I give.
[2:15:40] ever to him.
[2:15:43] Let me hear you sing it with all your
[2:15:45] heart again.
[2:15:48] [Music]
[2:15:50] Amen. Ever is gracious.
[2:15:55] His love is love so
[2:16:01] true.
[2:16:03] There is my soulless song.
[2:16:08] Faithful loving
[2:16:11] service to him.
[2:16:18] All your heart
[2:16:20] love
[2:16:23] me.
[2:16:26] Love
[2:16:28] me
[2:16:31] when
[2:16:33] nothing else
[2:16:40] me
[2:16:43] love
[2:16:46] me.
[2:16:47] Yes, it was lovely
[2:16:50] [Applause]
[2:16:55] when
[2:16:56] nothing else
[2:17:00] [Music]
[2:17:03] lifted
[2:17:06] me.
[2:17:08] [Music]
[2:17:09] Amen.
[2:17:11] God bless you, Richie. We had a
[2:17:12] wonderful time with brother Armando on
[2:17:15] Friday. They welcomed us and brother
[2:17:18] Andy was there, my wife and brother Art,
[2:17:20] sisters and his wife. We had a wonderful
[2:17:24] time. That's why I don't hardly have any
[2:17:26] voice because they pulled it out of me.
[2:17:29] And so we certainly appreciate him and
[2:17:31] his fellowship. And so you sisters will
[2:17:34] dismiss. Brothers will remain here to
[2:17:35] watch. Sisters next door. God bless you.

[2:40:02] and I think it'll be a blessing to us.
[2:40:03] Amen. Come forward, brother.
[2:40:12] Uh first of all, I want to ask you to
[2:40:16] forgive me for not taking the supper or
[2:40:20] participate in communion. But uh I it's
[2:40:23] not me alone. I have my wife and a
[2:40:25] friend and you know and uh to me this is
[2:40:28] very intimate
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; and I want to respect that.
[2:40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't I don't want no other
[2:40:35] thoughts to come up.
[2:40:39] Uh I've been sad for for about a week or
[2:40:44] two maybe
[2:40:46] and I work hard
[2:40:50] uh for souls.
[2:40:52] Uh it's a very tough job
[2:40:55] &gt;&gt; to take soul from the devil.
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; You know that's why churches are kind of
[2:41:01] empty because nobody wants to do that
[2:41:02] job.
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to clean babies.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:41:07] &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to, you know, do all that
[2:41:09] work. Everybody wants them, you know,
[2:41:11] like when they already know how to tie,
[2:41:14] how to offer, you know, that they
[2:41:16] already know them. They want them
[2:41:17] already productive.
[2:41:23] So when
[2:41:24] so you know doing this clean up with
[2:41:27] babies is hard.
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; And uh and uh so there was a there was a
[2:41:34] beautiful girl 20 years old
[2:41:37] that came uh with a family. His bro her
[2:41:41] brother is right there. Can you stand?
[2:41:43] uh
[2:41:45] uh Jixon that's the brother and uh the
[2:41:49] whole family
[2:41:51] and uh you know they they they want to
[2:41:54] work and all like that so we allow her
[2:41:57] to go to work to this place
[2:42:00] and it wasn't that long you know when
[2:42:02] the devil did his job because I I tell
[2:42:06] people that the devil has good preachers
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; they know how to preach
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; and they know how to really changed
[2:42:13] people's minds
[2:42:15] you know and so this girl about I think
[2:42:19] it is two weeks ago two weeks ago
[2:42:22] something like that she left she left
[2:42:25] the house she left the house of the
[2:42:27] family to go with this with these people
[2:42:31] I don't want to say other words but I
[2:42:33] have other words for these persons you
[2:42:35] know but uh I'll say these people
[2:42:39] you know and uh because they're are
[2:42:40] demonpossessed brothers Do you believe
[2:42:43] that
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; there's no other thing? How can you say,
[2:42:46] you know,
[2:42:48] &gt;&gt; and so they they start talking with this
[2:42:50] girl, you know, and and she was going to
[2:42:53] church, baptized, everything. And then
[2:42:57] all of a sudden her mind changed
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; and she left. She went and the brother
[2:43:04] the brother with whom she was leaving
[2:43:08] called me. She said, "Pastor, uh, my my
[2:43:11] sister left, you know, and then
[2:43:13] everybody start like the heart, you
[2:43:15] know, and I already knowing the the the
[2:43:19] system, you know, the the the the the
[2:43:21] movement. I I knew what was going on,
[2:43:24] you know, and so she left and and things
[2:43:28] just went on and on and on and uh and so
[2:43:31] I I've been dealing with this and coming
[2:43:34] with brother Alex. There were I was on
[2:43:37] the phone like three times I think
[2:43:38] brother Alex you know and brother Alex
[2:43:40] says huh they are not leaving you alone
[2:43:43] you know and she and he's like they're
[2:43:45] not and I'm like yeah yeah and I said
[2:43:47] brother Alex right now forgive this
[2:43:49] expression but I said right now I am
[2:43:52] like Rambo
[2:43:54] I have a weapon a 60 mm you know gun and
[2:43:58] I am in a trench
[2:44:00] &gt;&gt; cuz right now I'm fighting you don't
[2:44:02] know what powers I'm fighting it's not
[2:44:05] just the human. It's powers, you know,
[2:44:07] &gt;&gt; and I was, you know, I was coming and
[2:44:09] then they she went to to this to the
[2:44:13] sister and they negotiated with her, you
[2:44:16] know, kind of to stay with them and like
[2:44:18] that to get out of that place and uh and
[2:44:21] they called me and they said, "Brother
[2:44:23] Armando, pastor, the uh this girl uh my
[2:44:28] sister says that she want to stay now
[2:44:30] here." And I said, "Well, that's fine,
[2:44:32] but we I I got to deal with something
[2:44:34] else. There's not just coming.
[2:44:37] &gt;&gt; I I I got to there there has to be
[2:44:40] conditions,
[2:44:42] &gt;&gt; you know, and I'm happy that she was
[2:44:44] doing that decision, but at the same
[2:44:46] time, it's like, is this just going to
[2:44:48] be like that?"
[2:44:49] &gt;&gt; So, and I and I said to her, you know,
[2:44:52] this is the condition. And they have me
[2:44:55] on a speaker. And so she told the the
[2:44:58] the the brother-in-law said, "Let me
[2:45:01] talk to to the pastor." So she got the
[2:45:03] phone and told me, she said, "No, I'm
[2:45:06] not staying. I'm not going to stay under
[2:45:08] conditions."
[2:45:10] And boom, my heart went back again,
[2:45:12] brothers. I'm like, "Man, this is
[2:45:15] getting hard, you know." And at that
[2:45:17] time, I was driving. I think I was by uh
[2:45:20] by uh Pik the Yeah. Pikachu pig and I
[2:45:27] was you know and I said Lord this is too
[2:45:30] much
[2:45:32] father you please this devil you know
[2:45:36] father this I need your intervention
[2:45:39] Lord and this needs to be settled now
[2:45:42] and and I got to do this please father
[2:45:45] I'm putting this in your hands you know
[2:45:47] and and only people who have who have uh
[2:45:51] you know fought for souls and Satan has
[2:45:54] come and take them. You know, you know
[2:45:55] what what how hard it is. You know, uh
[2:45:59] parents who have lost children to Satan,
[2:46:02] you know, they know how hard what a scar
[2:46:04] left in the heart,
[2:46:06] &gt;&gt; you know, and so I said, "No, Lord, this
[2:46:08] is it cannot be this way." And so I left
[2:46:11] it like that and I was come I know I was
[2:46:12] coming to church,
[2:46:14] &gt;&gt; you know, and and and then the the Lord
[2:46:16] I said, "Lord, you know, I'm going to
[2:46:18] church. are going to your place of
[2:46:20] worship, you know, and and so I I came
[2:46:22] and and then I was sitting over there
[2:46:25] and I put my phone on silent,
[2:46:28] you know, and just uh vibration and
[2:46:31] there were two phone calls in there. I
[2:46:34] didn't pick them up. I said, "Lord, we
[2:46:36] are worshiping you and I'm not going to
[2:46:38] get out."
[2:46:40] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, you're going to take
[2:46:42] control of this thing.
[2:46:44] So when I when you were uh doing the
[2:46:47] washing and everything, I took time to
[2:46:49] get out. So when I got out, I called the
[2:46:52] number and it was an unknown number cuz
[2:46:56] she even had a new phone number and I
[2:47:00] called the number and she said, "Pastor,
[2:47:02] I'm calling you to let you know that I
[2:47:04] am staying
[2:47:07] that I am back
[2:47:10] &gt;&gt; and that tomorrow I'm going to go and
[2:47:12] pick my things
[2:47:14] from the other place."
