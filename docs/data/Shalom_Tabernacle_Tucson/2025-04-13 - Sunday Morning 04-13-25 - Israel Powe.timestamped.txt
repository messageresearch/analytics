[0:01] Good morning everyone. Can we all stand
[0:04] and we'll open up in a word of
[0:06] prayer. I was glad when they said unto
[0:08] me, let's go into the house of the Lord.
[0:11] Good to see
[0:13] everybody. Heavenly Father, we're
[0:15] grateful to be here this morning.
[0:17] Father, Lord, you've made us overcomers
[0:21] and you said, Lord, we'd be granted to
[0:23] eat of the hidden
[0:24] manner because of that, Father. So this
[0:28] morning, we're going to partake of that.
[0:30] We're going to hear that, Father. And we
[0:32] pray, Lord, that your blessing would
[0:34] just be upon every life to draw us
[0:36] closer to you, Father. Lord, to bring us
[0:39] into remembrance of the things that you
[0:41] have spoken. Bless the children in their
[0:44] class this morning. And Lord, everything
[0:47] that would be said and done. We're so
[0:49] grateful, Father, that you have given us
[0:52] this place, Lord, and the labor and the
[0:55] gifts and the Father, everybody, Father,
[0:58] that has blessed us. So, and Lord, we're
[1:00] just asking, Father, that you be here in
[1:03] the presence of thy holy spirit in a
[1:06] great way today. You'd answer prayer,
[1:08] Father, save, heal, and deliver, Lord,
[1:11] as needed. And we'll give you all the
[1:13] praise in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:16] Amen.
[1:18] We're going to be continuing with the
[1:20] Pergamian church
[1:23] age found in Revelation chapter 22 to
[1:27] verse 17. And we'll start at paragraph
[1:30] 237 and we'll end after 281.
[1:34] Can we sing only
[1:37] believe? Only
[1:42] believe.
[1:43] Only
[1:47] believe. All things are
[1:52] possible.
[1:54] Only
[1:57] believe.
[1:58] Only believe.
[2:03] Only
[2:07] believe. All things are
[2:12] possible.
[2:14] Only
[2:16] believe. You may be seated, brother
[2:19] Brandham.
[2:24] All right. Let's go just a little bit
[2:26] farther now. All
[2:28] right. All right. He said now that these
[2:32] was the doctrines of Balum. Now what did
[2:34] Balam do when he found out that he
[2:36] couldn't uh that he couldn't curse
[2:39] Israel? He told Baleo it would be a good
[2:42] idea then for him to invite these people
[2:47] to the festival of the god. They had a
[2:51] they had a a great uh festival up there
[2:54] they were where they were going to have
[2:56] and they um uh the uh festival was
[3:00] called the feast of
[3:02] Ba P E O R Bora I suppose Pora Bora it
[3:09] was a a feast to uh worship and Balam
[3:14] said now I'll tell you Bailo I'll give
[3:17] you a good idea if you'll Yes, you if
[3:21] you God won't curse them. That's all
[3:22] there is to it. So, I'll tell you what
[3:24] we'll do. We can't get rid of them, but
[3:26] if you'll just invite them over, you'll
[3:29] swing the whole thing your way. See,
[3:32] exactly exactly what Constantine did,
[3:36] perfectly. That's really the doctrine of
[3:39] Balum. What did they do? They then
[3:42] bail's teaching come down amongst Israel
[3:44] and they invited all the Israelites up
[3:47] to this big feast, the big blowout they
[3:49] had. Oh, some big party shindig of a
[3:52] thing up there. They had and when they
[3:54] got up there while these Israelite
[3:57] people begin to see these pretty sexy
[3:59] dressed Moanite women.
[4:02] Yes. Wasn't like their common girls down
[4:04] there. Amen. Oh, they look so pretty. my
[4:09] how they were made and oh how they could
[4:12] show themselves and they fell for it and
[4:16] begin to commit
[4:18] adultery. And Balam knowed if God
[4:22] wouldn't curse him, he'd take him over
[4:24] on this denominational side and cause
[4:26] the angry God to kill him anyhow. Let
[4:28] God kill him
[4:29] this ever get him out of the way of the
[4:32] truth. And as soon as you walk out and
[4:34] join our church instead of receiving the
[4:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost, you're dead.
[4:44] Not for you, but on here. I'm let that
[4:46] soak a little while.
[4:49] Dead. You have a name. Said to Luther,
[4:52] you're the Sardis age. The word Sardis
[4:53] means dead. You have a name that you're
[4:56] alive, but you're dead.
[4:59] That's what God said. Yes. See, and when
[5:03] they commit a spiritual fornications up
[5:05] there, the church married from the
[5:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost to a
[5:09] denomination, they become dead.
[5:13] There you are. That's what the Bible
[5:15] said. That's what God said speaking to
[5:18] the churches.
[5:20] Now, I'll just read something here to
[5:22] you that uh and God, what did he do? And
[5:26] now when they did this evil thing and
[5:30] they were in
[5:31] adultery, God killed 42,000 of them at
[5:35] one
[5:37] time.
[5:39] 42,000 for committing
[5:41] adultery. And what is it spoke of here
[5:44] in the church? The spiritual adultery.
[5:48] Amen.
[5:49] That you profess to be a Christian and
[5:51] still living like the world. Amen. Oh,
[5:55] help us, Lord. Oh,
[5:56] brother, receive ye the Holy Ghost.
[6:01] Get away from these old creeds and
[6:03] things. They're dead.
[6:05] Recite the Apostles Creed or some kind
[6:07] of a creed and say a few prayers, wrote
[6:09] out of a prayer book or something like
[6:11] that. Jesus never tell his people to say
[6:14] a prayer. He said, "Pray."
[6:18] Amen. Hallelujah. Pray. All right.
[6:23] Now, Constantine's feast, just like
[6:27] Balum, now watch like Balam's pagan
[6:30] feast, Constantine had a pagan
[6:33] feast. All
[6:35] right, Pergamus was in
[6:39] vine. And
[6:42] um notice now this I got something wrote
[6:46] down here. I'm going to leave it alone
[6:47] right
[6:49] now. All right. And I just trying to
[6:51] catch this note here of the something I
[6:54] put. Pergamus was
[6:57] invited. All right. They was invited to
[7:00] a feast after the nine council. They was
[7:04] invited to the feast of winter solstice
[7:10] which means the sun worship of the sun
[7:13] which was a pagan god which fell on
[7:17] December the 21st the shortest day in
[7:20] the year and the years the same time
[7:24] doesn't change till December the
[7:27] 25th all heathens celebrated it the son
[7:31] god's
[7:33] birthday. The son, God's birthday, was
[7:35] the shortest day in the year, December
[7:37] the 21st. And anyone that ever read the
[7:40] history of the churches know that
[7:42] heathens worshiped on that day. It was a
[7:44] celebration. Well, the Romans had they
[7:46] had the big gains, the Roman circus. How
[7:49] many seen this here? Whatever it was
[7:51] here, not long ago, they had been here.
[7:53] See, now the Roman circus, that's what
[7:55] the Romans had on that Sunday in
[7:58] commemoration of the birthday of the son
[8:01] god. See, and now and they made a big
[8:05] feast up there and invited the
[8:08] nickelians to come
[8:10] up. Oh, isn't it perfect? Amen. The
[8:13] teaching of Balum that you have in you.
[8:15] telling Pergus what they had the big
[8:19] races there they thought that these
[8:23] Nickeladians thought well that's fine
[8:26] this big feast is celebrating amulet yes
[8:29] so then with the invitation to the this
[8:33] the so-called archbishop or whatever he
[8:35] was then and everything they've taken to
[8:38] make it a continual thing to bring in
[8:43] fornications bring in adul adultery
[8:46] forming up uh the Catholic Church which
[8:50] is every Protestant denomination a
[8:53] member of it
[8:55] organization. God has no organization
[8:58] and hates the very name of it. The Bible
[9:01] said so. Praise the Lord. And when they
[9:05] did that, what happened? They they said
[9:08] now they had to have a spiritual
[9:11] application. So they changed the Lord
[9:14] Jesus s o n of God's birthday from April
[9:19] which all good scholars know in anybody
[9:23] with spiritual revelations that he was
[9:25] born in nature time like when lambs and
[9:27] everything else is born in April way
[9:31] back up to the 25th day of
[9:35] December and still worship Christmas.
[9:38] Not Santa Claus and what still more
[9:41] pagan festivals added to it. That's us
[9:43] all.
[9:46] There you are. Invited Balum. You have
[9:49] the doctrine of Balum among you. There
[9:51] it is.
[9:53] Oh, God. Just reveal it. Father,
[9:56] see the birthday from April until now.
[10:00] The historian says that all evidence
[10:04] that Jesus was born in the month of
[10:06] April when all other life comes forth,
[10:09] but they changed it back to the 25th day
[10:12] of December, 5 days after, see after the
[10:18] pagan god so they could put their
[10:20] ceremonies together. Paganism and
[10:23] Christianity and Catholicism is nothing
[10:26] in the world but a bunch of pagan
[10:28] superstitions and Christianity's offcavs
[10:32] put together. Amen.
[10:34] That's right. That is true. The
[10:37] Protestants that knucked it is just
[10:39] exactly the daughter of the mother
[10:42] prostitute. Exactly.
[10:45] Now God, help us to be real protesters
[10:49] against anything that's not God.
[10:55] Oh, and to make the spiritual
[10:58] application with it. Do you know what
[11:00] the bishop said? The bishop said, "We
[11:03] have a right to do this
[11:05] because he is the son of righteousness."
[11:12] H oh they get a loophole like that old
[11:16] father son holy ghost Matthew 28:19
[11:19] same
[11:22] kind sure they got a loophole they have
[11:24] to have some kind of a spiritual
[11:25] application you see but it don't the
[11:27] Bible said in the mouth of two or three
[11:29] witnesses let every word be established
[11:31] God said it that he says it three times
[11:33] if God take up the vericate something
[11:35] else he tucked Peter James and John
[11:36] everything he done he had two to three
[11:38] witnesses to prove everything he done
[11:40] all the way through the scripture
[11:41] That's right. But you see those little
[11:43] things has to come there so they can
[11:45] pick it up to be that God in order
[11:47] before the foundation of the world.
[11:49] There they got it. The spiritual
[11:51] application because he is a so n of God.
[11:53] We'll just take the pagan su n's
[11:56] birthday and make it s o n's birthday
[11:58] because he is a son of
[12:01] righteousness. You know, Protestants
[12:03] still fall for that. Something like
[12:04] that. Sure they would take it right away
[12:07] to the scripture and it somewhere else.
[12:09] Oh. Uh, let's just stop for a
[12:12] minute. All right. Here's one little
[12:15] thing I'd like to get. Let's get the
[12:17] last of this verse here right quick. Can
[12:18] we do it? Amen. Yeah. Well, I'll hurry
[12:21] real real quick now and we'll hit the
[12:22] highlights of it. All right. Where are
[12:25] we at now? But a few things I have
[12:27] against you, Balum. That's right. I got
[12:28] that. So has uh also the doctrine of
[12:31] Nickel. Repent else I come quickly and
[12:34] fight against thee with the sword of my
[12:36] mouth. He that has an ear, let him hear
[12:39] what the spirit saith unto the churches.
[12:44] My here when Constantine did this, it
[12:48] was when they fixed up this great
[12:50] festival. I I just I started to move.
[12:53] Wait, man. I'm going to wait for read
[12:54] that because the Holy Spirit keeps
[12:55] moving back. That's the reason I did
[12:56] what I did then. So, don't you hold that
[12:59] back. Amen. Here it comes. Amen. Amen.
[13:02] Come on. All right. Praise the Lord. The
[13:05] reason when they fixed up this big
[13:07] thing, I won't tell you what happened so
[13:09] that you'll understand. That was the
[13:11] birth of
[13:13] postmillenniums because the church had
[13:15] gotten
[13:16] rich. It was rich as it could be and it
[13:20] was what? Powerful. It was over the
[13:23] state. State and church was
[13:26] together. Ah God with a kingdom. And
[13:29] didn't Jesus say that every one of these
[13:32] nations was his? Amen. told Jesus so
[13:36] showed him the kingdoms of the world and
[13:37] said they're ever one mine and I do with
[13:39] them anything I want to and then unite
[13:41] God and the devil together.
[13:44] Oh, you can't do it. Amen.
[13:48] Certainly you
[13:49] can't reason the state is organized.
[13:51] God's not this organization. Praise the
[13:54] Lord. Certainly not. You can't do it.
[13:56] But they had it then. They had their
[13:58] church called Christianity. They had it
[14:01] united with the nation. the whole
[14:03] emperor of Rome, all of it, the big
[14:05] bishop up there over all of it, which is
[14:08] for after a while called a pope, but he
[14:10] was a he was a bishop then and um
[14:12] Bonaface III was the one who become the
[14:15] first pope. Then we find out that here
[14:17] he's set up there as really a pope over
[14:20] a god they had in human form. They had a
[14:23] great altar. They had fine riches. They
[14:25] had great powerful marvel altars and
[14:28] deck with gems and so forth all over it.
[14:31] And they had big churches. They
[14:33] controlled the state. And you know what?
[14:35] The word went out at that was the
[14:37] millennium that all the promises to them
[14:40] poor Jews that God had forsaken him,
[14:43] which he said he could never do it.
[14:45] Amen. And tried to bring in the
[14:47] millennium before the coming of the Lord
[14:50] Jesus. Amen.
[14:52] When Jesus comes, when the millennium
[14:54] sets in,
[14:56] that's a birthplace of postmillennium.
[14:58] And that's reason. The Catholic doesn't
[14:59] teach the coming of Jesus to this day.
[15:02] It's all in the church. This is
[15:03] millennium. The church owns everything.
[15:06] This is it. See, postm millennium. Oh
[15:10] my. Without the return of Jesus
[15:14] Christ. This lasted into the
[15:16] assassination of Constantine which come
[15:19] uh between 312 and and uh AD 312 and
[15:24] 606. Then Bonafice III was made the
[15:29] universal bishop or pope over the whole
[15:32] universal
[15:35] church. I believe we finish this verse
[15:37] and I'll have it. Praise God. And I just
[15:40] help just for a minute. 17th verse. He
[15:43] that has an ear, let him hear what the
[15:45] spirit says. to the churches. To him
[15:48] that overcomemeth will I give to eat the
[15:51] hidden
[15:52] mana, and will give him a white stone,
[15:57] and in the stone a new name written
[16:00] which no man knoweth, save he that
[16:04] receiveth. Would you rather wait till
[16:05] tomorrow night or have it now?
[16:11] Heavenly Father, I pray that you'll let
[16:13] the people understand now in the name of
[16:16] the Lord Jesus that they might
[16:18] understand everywhere and where the
[16:19] tapes go that they might know that I I
[16:23] say this because it is the divine
[16:27] interpretation thou has given. Amen.
[16:34] He that overcomemeth. The first thing I
[16:37] want you to remember that each one of
[16:40] these messages is addressed not to the
[16:44] church but to the angel of the church.
[16:48] Look back here. The first one the church
[16:50] of unto the church to the unto the angel
[16:54] of the church of Ephesus. That right?
[16:57] All right. The next church age the eth
[16:59] verse. unto the angel of the church of
[17:02] Simia.
[17:03] All right. And the 12th verse, unto the
[17:06] angel of the church of Pergamus. Is that
[17:10] right? The message is addressed to the
[17:13] leader of the church. Amen. God helped
[17:16] that guy that'll pull away from that
[17:18] message. Amen. But it was given to an
[17:21] angel and the angel was in his hand
[17:24] under his own control giving thriving
[17:27] power from him from his right hand.
[17:30] Amen. They're his right hand that is
[17:33] there in supreme power while they're
[17:36] here on the earth because they are the
[17:38] lights from him giving the light to that
[17:40] church. Amen. Amen. Amen. unto the angel
[17:44] of the church addressed to the star of
[17:46] the age that is
[17:50] responsible. The angel of the church is
[17:54] responsible.
[17:56] Amen. If he doesn't preach the word,
[17:59] right? And that angel will have to
[18:02] answer in the judgment.
[18:06] How many remembers the vision here not
[18:08] long ago uh about look here when it was
[18:11] when I was laying there on the bed and
[18:13] the Holy Spirit come and I looked back
[18:15] my wife there and there I was laying
[18:17] there and went up into the presence
[18:19] there and I seen all those people you
[18:21] remember me telling that all of you do
[18:22] see and I said well are they he said
[18:26] they are yours and I said all them
[18:30] Brandhams he said no there was millions
[18:32] of them he said that's your
[18:34] converts And I said converts to that
[18:36] woman that she was admiring so there
[18:39] young and beautiful said she was past 90
[18:42] when you led her to Christ and I said oh
[18:45] I said then I was afraid of this and he
[18:48] said we are waiting here for the coming
[18:51] of the Lord. I said I want to see him.
[18:53] He said you can't see him now but saidon
[18:56] he will come. We're waiting for him. But
[18:59] when he comes, he will come to you
[19:01] first and you'll be judged according to
[19:05] the gospel you preach and we will be
[19:08] your
[19:10] subjects. Well, I said, "You mean I'm
[19:12] responsible for all these?" All of
[19:15] us. I said, "Well, will ever one?" He
[19:19] said, "You were born a leader." And I
[19:21] said, "Well, will everyone be
[19:23] responsible?" He said, "Ever?" I said,
[19:26] 'What about St. Paul? Said he'll be
[19:29] responsible for his
[19:30] age. Well, I said, 'I preached the same
[19:33] gospel he did and millions of voices
[19:36] raised said we are resting upon that.
[19:38] Amen.
[19:41] Resting. So the angel of God, the
[19:45] messenger to the church is
[19:47] responsible if he preaches not the word.
[19:51] All right, hidden man. Let's give the
[19:54] interpretation the best we can. What
[19:56] does hidden mana type? Hidden mana was a
[20:00] mana that was kept in the place or a
[20:03] showbread in the Bible that was only for
[20:06] the priest. How many know that? See, now
[20:09] it wasn't for they had a bread for the
[20:12] congregation, but there was a special
[20:14] bread for the priest. Is that right?
[20:16] This is a special bread.
[20:20] A special bread hidden mana. What is it?
[20:25] Who is our mana? Christ.
[20:28] All right. St. John the 6th chapter 48
[20:32] to the 50th verse. If you're putting it
[20:33] down, Jesus said he was the bread of
[20:35] life that come from God out of heaven.
[20:37] The mana. Well, what is the hidden mana?
[20:40] The mana that isn't given to all of the
[20:43] congregation. The revelation is poured
[20:46] out upon the angel of the church. The
[20:50] revelation of the word
[20:54] see
[20:56] revelation of the word is given to the
[20:58] angel of that age for it's hid from
[21:01] everywhere and revealed back the hidden
[21:05] mana to it's addressed to the angel of
[21:08] the church.
[21:10] See you get it. It's a little bigger
[21:15] revelation of what Christ is. Maybe a
[21:18] little higher call. Wonder if Luther
[21:21] recognized that. Wonder if Wesley did in
[21:24] his day. Oh, wonder if St. uh uh Martin
[21:31] recognized it. Ireneius, now you know
[21:34] the church didn't even canonite those
[21:36] men. They wasn't saints to them, but
[21:39] they was the one who had the signs
[21:40] following. They took their their own
[21:43] bishops and so forth for Canaanite.
[21:46] Well, here not long ago, a woman went to
[21:48] get the life of St. Martin at a English
[21:52] bookstore and when she said St. Martin
[21:56] and the person took the rack out said he
[21:58] isn't known very much in history. He
[22:00] wasn't canonized. See, till yet this
[22:03] day, but God has his name. Amen. God
[22:06] knows who he is. See, that's the
[22:08] difference. Somebody wants their name in
[22:09] some big something, but God's people
[22:11] want to shun that kind of stuff. They
[22:13] don't want great big things and great
[22:15] big something. They want to be humble.
[22:18] The humility, the way the way up is
[22:21] down. He that humbles himself shall be
[22:24] exalted. He that exalts himself shall be
[22:26] a base. Humble himself. Don't try to be
[22:28] a big something. Try to be a little
[22:30] something. But be what you are. See, be
[22:34] little in the sight of God. Be little in
[22:36] your own sight. Everybody else is above
[22:38] you. Let him the greatest among you. Be
[22:40] minister to all.

[31:44] morning. We have the promise where two
[31:46] or three are gathered in his name. He's
[31:48] there in the midst of us. And whether
[31:51] that's you in the way of church, whether
[31:53] it's while we're here, he's in our
[31:56] conversation. He's in our worship this
[31:58] morning. Let's just make him our guest
[32:00] of honor if we could today.
[32:02] Amen. So good to see the dingwalls back
[32:05] with us. Told brother Israel maybe
[32:07] somebody could disconnect the battery or
[32:10] something to just so they could take a
[32:12] while to figure out how to how to get
[32:14] out of here. But sure good to see you
[32:16] guys again. The smiling faces. Amen.

[33:11] Father, I ask and bless the song leader,
[33:15] the musicians. Lord, the one singing,

[33:21] service, the deacons, the trustees, each
[33:23] one, Father, just our pastor, the
[33:26] family, and just Lord, we just think of
[33:29] Easter week that we're coming up on here
[33:32] and the sacrifice you made. Lord, the
[33:36] stripes you took upon your back for my
[33:37] healing, Lord. The blood you shed to
[33:41] save us, Father. You didn't have to come
[33:45] and die in such a horrible way, Father.
[33:47] But you chose to to redeem us, Lord. So
[33:51] thankful this morning, Lord. And so
[33:53] thankful for that power in the blood,
[33:55] the power in your name, Lord, that we
[33:58] can call on. We can put needs before
[34:01] you, Lord, and just come what may, Lord.
[34:04] We can just trust in you and rest in
[34:06] you, Father. Yes. Once again, Lord, just
[34:11] walk the aisles, Lord, and speak to each
[34:13] heart. I pray just ask these things now
[34:15] in Jesus name.

[39:23] Lord and right, oh, just keep on the
[39:27] firing
[39:29] line. And if you win, my brother, then
[39:33] you must fight. Just keep on the firing
[39:38] line.
[39:41] There are many dangers that we all must
[39:45] face. If we die of fighting, it is no

[39:54] no place. Oh, keep on the fiery
[39:59] land. Oh, you must fight. Be brave

[40:25] he can trust. So keep on the fiery
[40:31] line. If you wear a crown then bear the
[40:35] cross. You
[40:37] must keep on the firing
[40:42] line. And life is but to labor for the
[40:46] master
[40:47] dear. Help to banish evil and to spread
[40:51] good
[40:55] cheer. Service here. Oh, keep on the

[41:44] line. And when we see the soul that we
[41:48] have helped to
[41:49] win, leading them to Jesus from the
[41:53] paths of sin. With a shout of welcome,
[41:58] we'll all march in. Oh, keep on the fire
[42:03] and
[42:04] light. Oh, you must fight. Be brave
[42:09] against all
[42:11] evil.

[43:29] streets of glory. I'm going to walk
[43:31] those streets of
[43:34] glory. Since I
[43:36] lay my burdens
[43:39] down, going to walk the streets of
[43:45] glory since I

[47:27] [Music]
[47:32] me. Amen. I gave them a different song
[47:34] in the back. I apologize for that. Let's
[47:37] sing the one I gave you before we have
[47:39] the brothers come up for the prayer
[47:41] request. Victory is mine. Victory is
[47:46] mine. Victory today is
[47:52] mine. I told Satan just get thee behind.
[47:58] All for victory today is mine. Healing
[48:03] is mine. Healing is mine. Understand?
[48:07] Healing is mine. Oh, healing today is
[48:14] mine. I told Satan just get thee
[48:20] behind. He today is
[48:25] mine. Well, when I woke this morning, I
[48:29] didn't have a doubt. And I knew that the
[48:33] Lord would bring me
[48:36] out. So I got down on my knees. I said,
[48:40] "Lord, help me please." And I got up
[48:44] singing and shouting, "The
[48:46] victory." Brother Joe, victory is
[48:50] mine. Victory is
[48:53] mine. Victory today is mine.
[49:00] I told saints to get thee
[49:04] behind. Victory today is
[49:13] mine. God bless you, saints. It's
[49:16] something about getting down on your
[49:18] knees and claiming the victory. Sure. So
[49:20] good to be at church this morning.
[49:21] Welcome to our visitors. We tried to
[49:23] melt Brother Kim yesterday, but it's
[49:25] good to see him. Our sisters in the
[49:26] back. So, God bless you. In the way of
[49:30] announcements, there will be choir
[49:32] practice this afternoon. So, if you'd
[49:34] like to be involved in that or have
[49:35] questions, please see Brother
[49:37] Levi. We'll be taking an offering after
[49:40] the in the end of this service this
[49:42] morning for Liberia Church. So, uh
[49:45] consider
[49:47] that. The way of prayer requests, we
[49:49] sure want to thank the Lord for helping
[49:51] our precious sister Lori. He's basically
[49:53] raised our sister from the dead
[49:58] [Music]
[50:02] and amen. Just love the Lord and her
[50:05] precious sister and we've known her so
[50:08] long
[50:09] and and it really hits home. It hurts
[50:12] you and she's in a different state
[50:13] seeing her family in there and and
[50:16] passed out on the side of the road. They
[50:17] took her in and it was just touch and go
[50:20] there for a moment. But our precious
[50:21] Lord raised her up. Believe we'll see
[50:24] her real soon. So, let's give the Lord a
[50:25] hand, clap, and praise. It is
[50:32] good. They said she's doing much better
[50:34] and we still got to pray for her kidneys
[50:36] and her breathing. They did take out the
[50:38] breathing tube, so we we know she's on
[50:40] her way home. It'll be some time, but uh
[50:44] we just continue to hold her up for a
[50:45] complete recovery this morning.
[50:48] Understand Bethany is back McFaten, but
[50:50] Edward is driving uh the U-Haul and
[50:53] things home. So, pray for a safe trip.
[50:55] Pray for our brother Edward McFaten to
[50:58] get home here safely. Certainly always
[51:01] want to hold up the pastor. Let's pray
[51:02] for brother Israel this morning that
[51:04] he'd speak the words of life. I know if
[51:06] you come expecting to hear from heaven,
[51:08] you will. We have a mighty creator that
[51:10] can meet all needs. And so, we hold
[51:12] those before him. And certainly this
[51:15] trip to Liberia starting tomorrow, a
[51:17] long lengthy trip just to get over
[51:19] there. So pray for our brother. He'll be
[51:21] rested, get on a different time zone
[51:23] very easily. I know he'll be a blessing.
[51:25] So pray for our pastor. Is there
[51:28] something else that should be mentioned
[51:29] this
[51:30] morning? Um I know there's a need on
[51:33] your heart, a desire, maybe a family
[51:35] member, a financial, physical touch that
[51:38] you need. Let's just bring that before
[51:40] the Lord this morning that he he sees
[51:42] those needs and we go to him in faith
[51:45] believing Lord God we're such a blessed
[51:46] people this morning and hard to convey
[51:49] all the love the things that you've done
[51:52] for us Lord in the past just this week
[51:54] and that you're doing for us right now
[51:56] Lord to increase our faith and put us on
[51:58] the straight and narrow where we need to
[52:00] be purged and need help Lord and
[52:02] direction. We claim that this morning we
[52:05] come to hear from heaven and we know
[52:06] that we will. We're so thankful for it
[52:08] today, oh God.
[52:10] And we're so thankful for the touch that
[52:14] you've helped our sister Lori, Lord,
[52:17] with her heart condition and these
[52:18] things the devil has tried to hurt and
[52:21] harm her, but you've blessed her this
[52:23] morning, Lord. And you've blessed us,
[52:24] and we're so thankful for it. We pray
[52:27] you just see her through, Brother Randy,
[52:29] and the the church, the the family and
[52:31] the church there that is helping her.
[52:33] We're thankful for that. and and we pray
[52:35] for her and their the just a complete
[52:38] we're believing for a complete recovery
[52:40] for our sister, for her kidneys, Lord,
[52:43] to work 100%. We pray that today and we
[52:45] claim that for our sister and for her
[52:47] breathing. They've taken this tube out
[52:49] and now she can do it on her own with
[52:51] your help, oh God. So pray for sister
[52:54] Lorie Snow this morning and for brother
[52:56] Edward McFaten on his way home. Would
[52:58] you give him safety, Lord? that it's
[53:02] tiring at times to to take these long
[53:04] trips. And so we pray that you give him
[53:06] strength and in the awareness and the
[53:09] help that he needs. And and for brother
[53:11] Israel, Lord, we're thankful for him.
[53:12] We're thankful for his family. Sister
[53:14] Sharon, Sister Cararissa, Levi, Aaliyah.
[53:18] Lord, we know you've called each one of
[53:20] them. We're thankful for them. And as he
[53:21] goes on this trip, Lord, to Liberia,
[53:23] you've called him over there and he's
[53:26] answered the call, Lord. And so we pray
[53:27] that you'd touch him through the trip
[53:31] over there. And then while he's there,
[53:32] Lord, make him a blessing. Heal the
[53:35] brokenhearted, Lord. Raise those from
[53:37] the dead that need that and the the dead
[53:40] spiritually, Lord. We pray that you'd
[53:42] bring them to newness of life in Christ
[53:44] Jesus. We're so thankful, Lord, for it.
[53:46] And we'll collect tithes and offerings
[53:48] at this moment and then at the end of
[53:50] service for specifically for the Liberia
[53:53] church, Lord, and for this trip. And
[53:55] we're thankful to do that this morning
[53:57] as cheerful givers unto thee. We love
[53:58] you and thank you. Precious name of our
[54:00] Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[54:02] All God's people say,
[54:12] "Amen." Amen. Maybe we could sing that
[54:14] chorus. There's nothing that my God
[54:16] can't do.
[54:18] [Music]
[54:20] There is
[54:25] nothing. There's
[54:30] nothing. There is
[54:33] nothing my
[54:36] God can do.
[54:47] and
[54:51] wonders. There is
[54:54] nothing, no
[54:57] nothing that my God can do. Sing it one
[55:01] more time before you're seated. There's
[55:07] nothing There's
[55:12] nothing There's
[55:15] nothing that my
[55:18] God can do.
[55:21] [Music]
[55:28] mirles and
[55:34] wonderers there's
[55:36] nothing no
[55:39] nothing that my
[55:42] God Amen you can be seated if you'd
[55:47] like and we have
[55:51] some to
[55:54] [Music]
[55:56] Someone to
[55:59] share all our
[56:02] troubles like no
[56:05] other can
[56:10] do. You'll come
[56:12] down from the
[56:15] sky, brush the
[56:18] tears from your eyes.
[56:22] You're his
[56:23] child and he
[56:26] cares for
[56:30] you. Thankful for that this morning.
[56:33] We've
[56:34] someone to
[56:37] care. There's
[56:40] someone to
[56:42] share all our
[56:45] troubles like no
[56:48] other can do.
[56:54] He'll come
[56:56] down from the
[56:58] sky, crush the
[57:01] tears from your
[57:04] eyes. You're his
[57:07] child, and he
[57:10] cares for you.
[57:16] My
[57:17] soul in sad
[57:21] exile was out on life
[57:27] scene so
[57:29] burdened with sin and
[57:34] distress. Then I heard a sweet
[57:37] voice. Then I heard a sweet
[57:43] voice saying, "Make me your
[57:46] [Music]
[57:48] choice." Then I
[57:51] enter that
[57:53] haven of rest.
[57:57] [Music]
[57:59] Oh, I've
[58:01] anchored my
[58:04] soul in the
[58:06] haven of
[58:09] rest. I will sail the wild
[58:14] seas no more.
[58:21] And the
[58:22] tempest may
[58:25] sweep or the
[58:28] wild stormy
[58:30] day. But in
[58:33] Jesus I am
[58:36] safe ever
[58:41] more. Then I
[58:44] yielded
[58:46] myself to his
[58:49] tender
[58:52] embrace and
[58:54] faith. Taking hold of the word.
[59:03] My
[59:05] feathers fell
[59:07] off and I
[59:10] anchored my
[59:13] soul. The
[59:15] haven of
[59:18] resting, my Lord.
[59:24] I have
[59:26] anored my
[59:28] soul in the
[59:31] haven of
[59:34] rest. I will sing the wild
[59:39] seas no more.
[59:46] The
[59:48] tempest may sweep for the
[59:54] while,
[59:56] but in
[59:58] Jesus I am
[1:00:01] safe ever more.
[1:00:04] [Music]
[1:00:08] Song of my soul.
[1:00:12] Since the
[1:00:14] Lord made me
[1:00:17] whole has
[1:00:19] made the old
[1:00:22] story so
[1:00:25] blessed of
[1:00:28] Jesus of
[1:00:30] Jesus who will
[1:00:33] save
[1:00:35] whosoever will
[1:00:38] have a
[1:00:40] home in A
[1:00:43] haven of
[1:00:48] rest. Oh, I have
[1:00:52] an
[1:00:54] soul in the
[1:00:57] haven of
[1:00:59] rest. I will
[1:01:02] send white
[1:01:05] seas no more.
[1:01:11] And the
[1:01:13] tempest may
[1:01:15] sweet or the
[1:01:18] wild stormy
[1:01:20] day. But in
[1:01:23] Jesus I'm
[1:01:26] saved ever more. Let's sing that one.
[1:01:29] How precious the
[1:01:31] thought and how
[1:01:34] precious the
[1:01:37] thought that we all
[1:01:40] may
[1:01:42] recline like
[1:01:45] John the
[1:01:48] beloved and
[1:01:53] blessed on
[1:01:55] Jesus strong
[1:01:57] arm where No
[1:02:01] tempest can
[1:02:03] harm
[1:02:06] secure in the
[1:02:09] haven of
[1:02:13] rest. Oh, I have
[1:02:16] anored my
[1:02:19] soul in the
[1:02:22] g of rest.
[1:02:25] I will say the white
[1:02:30] seas no
[1:02:35] more. The
[1:02:38] tempest may
[1:02:40] swing or the
[1:02:43] wild stormy
[1:02:46] day. In
[1:02:49] Jesus I'm
[1:02:51] safe ever more. Just continue to
[1:02:54] worship. Sing it one more
[1:02:56] time. Yes, I've
[1:02:59] anchored my
[1:03:02] soul in the
[1:03:05] haven of
[1:03:07] rest. I will
[1:03:09] sail the wild
[1:03:13] seas no more.
[1:03:19] Oh, the
[1:03:20] tempest may
[1:03:23] sweet or the
[1:03:26] wild stormy
[1:03:29] day. In
[1:03:31] Jesus I'm safe. Just continue to worship
[1:03:35] him as the musicians plays or pastor
[1:03:37] comes this morning.
[1:03:39] [Music]
[1:04:09] Hallelujah.
[1:04:10] [Music]
[1:04:44] Heat. Heat.
[1:04:52] [Music]
[1:05:27] Amen. Let's bow our heads for a word of
[1:05:29] prayer.
[1:05:31] Dear Lord
[1:05:33] Jesus, we come gathered here in your
[1:05:35] name this
[1:05:36] morning. Father, asking for your
[1:05:39] presence to come now and speak to our
[1:05:42] hearts, Lord. We give you the praise for
[1:05:45] the opportunity to come into your
[1:05:48] presence. We don't deserve it, Lord, but
[1:05:51] we certainly need it more than ever
[1:05:55] before, Lord. We need you every moment,
[1:05:59] every hour of the day, Lord. Just asking
[1:06:01] you to pour out your Holy Spirit upon
[1:06:05] us, oh God. And bless each heart that's
[1:06:08] gathered and made the effort to
[1:06:10] sacrifice to be here, Lord. May they
[1:06:12] receive their portion. Bless the saints
[1:06:14] in Mesa this morning. Those that are on
[1:06:17] the stream and those that would like to
[1:06:20] be here, oh God, remember them. And each
[1:06:23] one may receive their portion today as
[1:06:25] our prayer in Jesus name. Amen. Can I
[1:06:29] get a little more volume, please? Thank
[1:06:30] you. So happy to be in house of the Lord
[1:06:33] with you all today. Amen. We count it a
[1:06:36] privilege to be here with you and we
[1:06:38] trust that each one will receive their
[1:06:41] their portion. Amen. We have a number a
[1:06:44] couple of visitors with us. Two young
[1:06:46] ladies in the back. Why don't you two
[1:06:48] sisters stand? I know you love that.
[1:06:51] So God bless you.
[1:06:56] These are the girls, uh, Levi or Kesa
[1:06:58] and Aaliyah and our family's friends.
[1:07:01] And I would introduce their names, but I
[1:07:03] forgot their names. But Christa
[1:07:09] and Anna. Okay. You know, they talk
[1:07:13] clearly at home, but they get in here
[1:07:14] and whisper like Christa and Anna. We're
[1:07:17] so happy to have them. I think one's
[1:07:20] from New York, a pastor there, Brother
[1:07:22] Monday Royce Church. I know him very
[1:07:24] well from um from the islands there. And
[1:07:28] then our sister Anna, her I think
[1:07:31] they're in Colorado, Idaho. Idaho.
[1:07:34] Idaho. All right. And so God bless them
[1:07:38] and God bless each of you. Amen. Are
[1:07:40] there any other visitors here today?
[1:07:44] Who? Brother No, no, no. That's that's
[1:07:47] home folks right there. So, we're so
[1:07:50] happy to have brother Kim and and his
[1:07:52] dear wife, Sister Hedi, and we would
[1:07:56] have them, Sister Hedi, come up and
[1:07:58] speak, but she probably wouldn't like
[1:08:00] that. I'm just teasing a little bit. So,
[1:08:03] so happy to have each of you. Brother
[1:08:05] Kim is here with us and always a big
[1:08:08] help. I sent him a voicemail here a week
[1:08:11] or so ago. He didn't answer and I said,
[1:08:13] "Hello, can Kim come out to play?"
[1:08:17] And so we wanted to get him back out
[1:08:20] here. So he's here and we certainly
[1:08:22] appreciate him. We appreciate each of
[1:08:24] you. Amen. So let's go right into the
[1:08:27] word of the Lord. Uh just a quick
[1:08:30] announcement tonight. Brother David
[1:08:32] Musgrove from Charity Tabernacle will be
[1:08:34] ministering for us here at the church.
[1:08:37] That'll be his first time preaching for
[1:08:39] us. Very good friend of ours over the
[1:08:42] years, an elder in the message here. and
[1:08:46] um he greeted us and was so glad to uh
[1:08:50] congratulate us on our church and we
[1:08:52] spoke a little bit over the years. We've
[1:08:53] always stayed in contact and I've spoken
[1:08:56] for him a number of times but this will
[1:08:58] be the first time he'll be over here
[1:09:00] with us. So the Lord willing we will
[1:09:02] have him tonight. Amen. So we look
[1:09:05] forward to that. So let's take our
[1:09:07] Bibles and turn in the scripture two
[1:09:10] places in the New Testament. Ephesians
[1:09:12] chapter 5 and Galatians. Thank you. Oh,
[1:09:16] please. Thank you. All right. Thank you.
[1:09:20] All right.
[1:09:21] Perfect. Thank you,
[1:09:25] brother. Ephesians chapter 5 and then
[1:09:29] Galatians chapter
[1:09:39] 3. Uh, so when you all move your seats,
[1:09:42] I don't see you for a little while. So I
[1:09:45] think we normally have, you know, people
[1:09:47] where they sit. They usually sit the
[1:09:49] same place. And um, some of you have
[1:09:53] moved your
[1:09:54] seat, but we will find you after a
[1:09:57] while. The Lord
[1:09:58] willing, God bless you. Ephesians
[1:10:00] chapter 5
[1:10:03] verse let's take
[1:10:07] um just one scripture I believe that I
[1:10:09] want
[1:10:11] there verse number 30 for we are members
[1:10:15] of his body of his flesh and of his
[1:10:21] bones it's talking about marriage
[1:10:24] talking about husbands loving their
[1:10:25] wives and
[1:10:27] wives their love and submitting to their
[1:10:30] husbands as Christ did to the church.
[1:10:33] But then verse 30 says, "For we are
[1:10:36] members of his body, of his flesh, and
[1:10:40] of his bones." If we uh Galatians
[1:10:43] chapter 3, take one more scripture
[1:10:53] there and verse number
[1:10:56] 13. Christ hath redeemed us from the
[1:10:58] curse of the law, being made a curse for
[1:11:02] us. For it is written, Cursed is
[1:11:05] everyone that hangeth on a tree, that
[1:11:08] the blessing of Abraham might come on
[1:11:12] the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that
[1:11:15] we might receive the promise of the
[1:11:17] Spirit through faith. Brethren, I speak
[1:11:21] after the manner of men, though it be
[1:11:22] but a man's covenant, yet if it be
[1:11:25] confirmed, no man
[1:11:27] disolith or addeth thereto. Now to
[1:11:31] Abraham and his seed where the promise
[1:11:34] is made, he saith not and to seeds as of
[1:11:39] many, but as of one and to thy seed
[1:11:44] which is Christ. Amen. Um by God's
[1:11:48] grace, we want to take our title um a
[1:11:52] super race. A super race. And this is
[1:11:56] still in line kind of coming through
[1:11:58] what we were talking about with Israel
[1:11:59] and their great journey. How the L Lord
[1:12:02] has purged us and cleansed us. I think
[1:12:04] last week Sunday we spoke on our sins
[1:12:07] have been purged and we've talked about
[1:12:10] how you know the Lord purges. He takes
[1:12:13] this away and negativity out of our life
[1:12:16] and all those things. But it's so nice
[1:12:18] to have your sins taken away from you
[1:12:21] and not just to be forgiven to be
[1:12:23] justified. How many remember that? To be
[1:12:26] justified. To be declared righteous.
[1:12:30] Amen. And so that's our title this
[1:12:33] morning, a super race. May God bless
[1:12:37] you. You may be seated. Thank you.
[1:12:41] as I was going through
[1:12:45] um continuing and
[1:12:48] fellowshipping on the things that I've
[1:12:50] been talking about this great purge and
[1:12:52] how
[1:12:54] sometimes you need to lose something in
[1:12:57] order to gain something greater.
[1:13:01] And sometimes cutting things away or
[1:13:04] losing something or something taken from
[1:13:07] you or something's missing from you, it
[1:13:11] always seems negative, but it's actually
[1:13:14] many times that's what you need. That's
[1:13:17] what we all need. We need those times in
[1:13:19] our life. And there's seasons, right?
[1:13:22] There's seasons where we gather things.
[1:13:25] We're accumulating. We're getting fat.
[1:13:27] We're getting rich. We're acquiring. And
[1:13:30] then there's seasons where we got to let
[1:13:33] some things go. Just let that go and let
[1:13:36] this one go and move and let that job go
[1:13:38] and let that go. And you you have to
[1:13:43] have you really need the grace of God
[1:13:46] during those junctions of your life
[1:13:48] because men, they like to cabbage down
[1:13:51] and they like a little comfort zone and
[1:13:54] they like the temperature just right and
[1:13:56] they want all their friends just right.
[1:13:58] They want to be able to trust everybody
[1:13:59] that's in their circle. They don't want
[1:14:02] nobody, you know, they want everything
[1:14:04] just right. And we kind of build that
[1:14:06] and we create that safe space. We don't
[1:14:10] hang out with people that's going to
[1:14:11] violate us. Put it that way. We create
[1:14:14] these safe spaces, but the Lord moves
[1:14:18] you
[1:14:20] sometimes into places that are
[1:14:22] uncomfortable.
[1:14:25] And the eagles have to go through this
[1:14:27] and the little bitty birdies have to go
[1:14:29] through this. They come out of that egg
[1:14:32] shell. They It's a big trauma. There's a
[1:14:34] new world and they're squeaking and
[1:14:37] crying and mama's bringing them food and
[1:14:40] it's get and their feathers are coming
[1:14:42] in and they start to mature and they
[1:14:45] start feeling pretty good in that nest.
[1:14:48] But there's a junction coming for them
[1:14:50] that those little bitty birdies have to
[1:14:52] leave from there. And that's that's not
[1:14:55] comfortable, but it's necessary. And we
[1:14:59] all need those. We all have those times
[1:15:00] in our life. And Israel, we see that is
[1:15:03] expressed through their life and how God
[1:15:06] has used them and used them for our
[1:15:08] example. I like this thought of being
[1:15:11] justified as brother Brandham brought it
[1:15:13] to us. He takes Romans chapter
[1:15:17] 5:E1 and um therefore being justified by
[1:15:21] faith and he takes that word justified
[1:15:24] and he goes deeper with it, doesn't he?
[1:15:26] He goes into the message invisible union
[1:15:28] of the bride and he says the bride is
[1:15:31] not only forgiven,
[1:15:34] she's justified. So for example, he
[1:15:37] says, say you heard I did something
[1:15:39] wrong and then you come to come come to
[1:15:41] find out that I actually didn't do it
[1:15:43] and then you come, you say, "Brother
[1:15:44] Vandom, I forgive you." He's like,
[1:15:46] "Forgive me? I was never even guilty."
[1:15:49] And that's a hard thing for our mind to
[1:15:52] receive when
[1:15:53] actually we have photos and evidence
[1:15:56] that you were guilty.
[1:15:59] There's some people on the streets, they
[1:16:00] know you was guilty. There's your past
[1:16:03] that will witness that you're guilty.
[1:16:06] But brother Brandham brings in and the
[1:16:08] Bible brings to us the book of life and
[1:16:12] then the lamb's book of life. And in the
[1:16:15] lamb's book of life, there are no
[1:16:19] recordings of your past life.
[1:16:23] In fact, it they're recordings of your
[1:16:25] past life, but your original past life.
[1:16:27] I'm talking about before the foundation
[1:16:29] of the world. That recording is in the
[1:16:33] lamb's book of life. And this is
[1:16:35] something how Satan always points us
[1:16:37] back to our
[1:16:40] recordkeeping as we are under our first
[1:16:43] birth. He keeps track of that. And then
[1:16:46] when we come to the Lord Jesus and get
[1:16:49] saved, you know, he always uses that
[1:16:51] little wedge. Yeah, but before you were
[1:16:53] a Christian or remember you made a
[1:16:54] mistake or remember last time, remember
[1:16:56] you failing. He's always pointing back.
[1:16:59] But as a believer, we tried to encourage
[1:17:02] you last week to go back before you ever
[1:17:06] sinned. What about that? What about that
[1:17:09] information? Do we have information on
[1:17:12] where we was before we ever sinned?
[1:17:15] Before we ever got here? Where were we?
[1:17:19] We were in him,
[1:17:22] a part of him, not just a little side
[1:17:26] piece. He we were actually a part of
[1:17:30] him. We were in him from before the
[1:17:33] foundation of the world. Now this first
[1:17:36] birth is a challenge for us because we
[1:17:39] all have come through it and we all have
[1:17:42] the pains associated with the first
[1:17:45] birth. our first birth. Many of us, if
[1:17:49] we could change something about oursel,
[1:17:52] it probably would be, many of us carnal
[1:17:55] people would start on something on the
[1:17:57] outside. If I could just be a little bit
[1:18:00] smaller, a little bit taller, a little
[1:18:03] bit, you know, more, you know, handsome
[1:18:06] or a little more pretty. My hair was
[1:18:08] just a little bit longer, a little bit
[1:18:10] thicker, little bit more brown or a
[1:18:13] little more red. eyes are more blue just
[1:18:15] a little bit. You know how we are. And
[1:18:19] we'll constantly pick apart our outer
[1:18:23] something in our birth. If I can just I
[1:18:25] wish I didn't have so many siblings or I
[1:18:28] wish I had my own
[1:18:30] room. Come on now. You big families now.
[1:18:33] Don't get quiet on me. I wish I I was
[1:18:36] you know that family is perfect. If I
[1:18:38] had a dad like that. If I had a mom like
[1:18:41] that. If my wife was like, if my husband
[1:18:44] was like that, you know, and it's um
[1:18:46] it's constant that we play these games
[1:18:50] um with
[1:18:52] ourselves like um even our race,
[1:18:56] something
[1:18:57] physical. And you know there, believe it
[1:19:00] or not, there's a group of people that
[1:19:03] spend a good portion of their life
[1:19:05] always guilty about something. They feel
[1:19:08] bad like always
[1:19:12] everything was their fault.
[1:19:15] And there's some people that don't feel
[1:19:16] guilty about nothing.
[1:19:20] Yes. Oh yes. There's people like that.
[1:19:23] It's never their
[1:19:24] fault. But then there's other people,
[1:19:26] it's always their fault. And you know,
[1:19:29] these are weaknesses that come under our
[1:19:32] first birth. But we thank God for what
[1:19:35] we call the new birth.
[1:19:38] Being born again.
[1:19:41] Have you been born again?
[1:19:44] Oh, what a feeling. What an opp what a
[1:19:47] what a time when a man or a woman has
[1:19:49] been born
[1:19:51] again and you take on his righteousness.
[1:19:55] Now in the Old Testament, this first
[1:19:58] birth was a challenge because if you
[1:20:01] were not born correctly, your whole
[1:20:05] existence could be under judgment. God's
[1:20:08] laws didn't have a place for you if
[1:20:12] there was something very nefarious.
[1:20:14] Maybe you're a bastard child. The
[1:20:16] scriptures talk about that. Or um you're
[1:20:19] born in a household of
[1:20:21] unbelievers or your generation did
[1:20:24] something. And there's a curse coming
[1:20:26] down from that
[1:20:27] generation. And even a priest, he
[1:20:30] couldn't have certain physical ailments
[1:20:33] and markings. He under that first birth,
[1:20:36] he wouldn't qualify just because of
[1:20:39] something, a birth defect. And this is
[1:20:42] the Old Testament. The Lord put these um
[1:20:45] the these are realities. And we know
[1:20:47] that. And so we we we we go and we look
[1:20:52] at um the new birth and the scriptures
[1:20:55] we just read there that we are his body.
[1:20:59] We become a part of his body, bone and
[1:21:03] flesh of him and that he take that we
[1:21:06] take
[1:21:07] on Abraham's seed. So what was he trying
[1:21:11] to do? He was highlighting out of all of
[1:21:15] the seeds of the earth. He was going to
[1:21:17] take a
[1:21:18] man, a little brown man, a little white
[1:21:21] man, a little black man, whatever shade
[1:21:24] his cup copper colored skin, whatever
[1:21:27] shade Abraham was. I'm going to take you
[1:21:31] Abraham and bless your seed and give
[1:21:35] them a law and make myself known to
[1:21:38] them. And then I don't want your seed
[1:21:40] mingling with other nations and other
[1:21:42] seeds. I want to keep this a pure seed.
[1:21:46] And so we see that ingrained in people.
[1:21:48] Brother Vanam takes this message a super
[1:21:50] sign. I'm going to highlight it for you
[1:21:52] to for this week or month if you have a
[1:21:54] chance to get it. It's I put it out
[1:21:56] there. It's a book there that you can
[1:21:58] get and read and the tape you can listen
[1:22:00] to. And he talks about how Hitler in
[1:22:05] Germany wanted to breed a super race. He
[1:22:10] said Stalin and Russia tried to
[1:22:12] accomplish a super race. He said that
[1:22:16] Pharaoh and Egypt wanted to breed a
[1:22:20] super race. And um but we
[1:22:25] are by the help of the Lord, we can show
[1:22:28] you that we are that super race that God
[1:22:33] has bred down through the ages. He took
[1:22:38] Abraham and from Abraham, Abraham had a
[1:22:41] son named Ishmael. And then from
[1:22:44] Ishmael, that seed went a certain way.
[1:22:46] And then from Isaac, and then through
[1:22:49] Isaac, Isaac had sons, Esau and Jacob,
[1:22:53] Esau went a certain way. But then we're
[1:22:55] going to take Jacob. And then from Jacob
[1:22:57] on down the 12 patriarchs and through
[1:22:59] those seeds and through those lines and
[1:23:02] through um Jacob's seed there, uh Christ
[1:23:07] comes through um through the seed of
[1:23:10] David there. And uh um the tribe is
[1:23:13] escaping my name right now, the tribe of
[1:23:15] Judah. He he he picks that tribe of
[1:23:18] Judah coming down and he's, you know,
[1:23:21] bringing out and breeding and bringing
[1:23:23] out um a
[1:23:28] superchild that Isaiah's prophecy of
[1:23:30] virgin shall
[1:23:32] conceive would be
[1:23:34] fulfilled. And here he was born and now
[1:23:38] Christ has purchased a church through
[1:23:42] Calvary. Look at somebody and say
[1:23:44] Calvary.
[1:23:46] Don't let if you get somewhere in your
[1:23:48] life and you can't see the cross, then
[1:23:50] you need to get back to the cross.
[1:23:53] Whatever job, whatever relation,
[1:23:54] whatever church, wherever you at, always
[1:23:57] keep the cross in your viewpoint.
[1:24:00] Calvary. Yes. Because that's where it
[1:24:03] all takes place. That's where the sin
[1:24:06] question was dealt with. So at Calvary,
[1:24:09] he purchases a church. He purchases
[1:24:12] people. Through Calvary, we find
[1:24:14] salvation. And from salvation, now, not
[1:24:18] just the church, he's going to call out
[1:24:20] a bride. Now, here the prophet God takes
[1:24:23] in the message the super uh um the super
[1:24:28] sign. And he says this here, 1962 July.
[1:24:34] I'll take let's see what the prophet of
[1:24:37] God says here. Page number 19.
[1:24:42] Paragraph 125. He never come with the
[1:24:45] salute of heaven. He never come as an
[1:24:49] angel. He come as Abraham's seed to show
[1:24:53] the last day super sign. Oh God. Oh yes.
[1:24:58] To make a super seed, a super
[1:25:02] race. the race that had been promised,
[1:25:06] Abraham's race, to bring forth a super
[1:25:10] seed that we've been talking about a
[1:25:13] super Christrist. What did they do to
[1:25:16] him when he come on earth? They made fun
[1:25:18] of him. They called the spirit that was
[1:25:20] working in him where he could discern
[1:25:22] spirits and so forth. They said, "It's
[1:25:24] the devil, Beelzebub, fortune teller."
[1:25:26] And in that physical part, the body
[1:25:28] part, they hung it on a tree and put him
[1:25:30] to death. But he was a super sign.
[1:25:34] He rose up again on the third day for he
[1:25:37] trusted the word of God. David said
[1:25:40] under inspiration, "I will not leave his
[1:25:43] soul in hell, neither will I suffer my
[1:25:46] holy one to see corruption." Therefore,
[1:25:48] Jesus knew that the scriptures spoke of
[1:25:52] him that he would not see corruption.
[1:25:55] Corruption sets in every 72 hours on a
[1:25:58] dead body. We know that and he knows
[1:26:02] sometime between that he would raise
[1:26:04] from the dead and he rose up from the
[1:26:07] dead for he was a super sign. Can I get
[1:26:12] a witness here this morning? The
[1:26:14] prophets were signed. Sure. But they
[1:26:17] died and went into the grave. But Jesus
[1:26:19] was the super sign.
[1:26:23] He come out of the grave. Amen. Super
[1:26:27] race. Yes sir. A super Christ.
[1:26:33] So that's our heart. That's our theme
[1:26:36] here this morning. We have been born by
[1:26:41] the spirit of God.
[1:26:43] He is breathing in us a super race.
[1:26:48] Now I know you thought your race was the
[1:26:50] best one.
[1:26:52] Hallelujah. Let me take my glasses off
[1:26:55] so I can really see who who's who's got
[1:26:59] the best race in
[1:27:01] here. I don't want to be honest in
[1:27:05] church. This is the best race that you
[1:27:08] can be a part of is this race right
[1:27:11] here.
[1:27:13] The one that come through the lineage of
[1:27:15] Abraham and he died. This race, this
[1:27:19] member of this race died. went into the
[1:27:23] grave and got up back up out of the
[1:27:26] grave with all power in his hands.
[1:27:30] Now, your race might be smart and your
[1:27:32] race might be able to sing and your race
[1:27:34] might be able to dance. Your race
[1:27:37] accomplishes this. I don't know no other
[1:27:39] race that got up out of the grave.
[1:27:41] There's only one that got up out of the
[1:27:44] grave with all power in his hands. And
[1:27:48] from that, he's breeding now a super
[1:27:50] race. And that's the people. That's the
[1:27:54] people of God that we're talking about
[1:27:56] this morning. Amen. Praise the Lord. A
[1:27:59] super race. The prophet of God deals
[1:28:02] with this in a word to the
[1:28:06] church as
[1:28:08] he says, "As we near the
[1:28:11] headstone, he talked about it in the
[1:28:13] spoken word is the original seed." But
[1:28:15] we'll we'll we'll go from that just for
[1:28:18] a moment. Let's let's deal with this
[1:28:19] first birth just for a moment. This
[1:28:22] this bastard child, it's found in
[1:28:28] Deuteronomy 23 and verse two that this
[1:28:31] bastard child should not enter into the
[1:28:34] congregation of the Lord for several
[1:28:37] generations. This is the child that was
[1:28:39] born an illegitimate birth.
[1:28:44] But you know, if you if you if you go
[1:28:46] deeper into the word, we'll find that in
[1:28:49] Hebrews chapter 12 tells us what a
[1:28:53] bastard child
[1:28:54] is. And a bastard according to Hebrews
[1:28:57] chapter 12 is he who is without
[1:29:02] correction. They don't receive
[1:29:04] correction. They render themselves a
[1:29:07] master child. You know, and and you
[1:29:10] know, this is something that we bring
[1:29:12] all the time. And this is something that
[1:29:15] you will experience in your Christian
[1:29:17] journey. Every time you pick up the
[1:29:20] Bible, every time you come into his
[1:29:23] presence, he's doing something hopefully
[1:29:27] to correct, to straighten out, to heal,
[1:29:30] to nurture, to fix, or to put bomb on
[1:29:34] something that was corrected. It's
[1:29:36] always something about making you a
[1:29:38] better person. And you can't become a
[1:29:40] better person remaining as you are.
[1:29:43] Something has to change. There's a you
[1:29:45] know you have to move from this to that.
[1:29:47] There's a stages and we go through those
[1:29:50] times. We have a highlights and then we
[1:29:52] have our low downs. We have our good
[1:29:55] days and sometimes we have some very bad
[1:29:57] days and we're very we're put under
[1:30:00] pressure. And I don't know another age
[1:30:02] that doesn't have you know this age is
[1:30:05] just so much pressure. Just pressure
[1:30:07] from on every level. Pressure for
[1:30:10] everyone. Pressure to perform. Pressure
[1:30:13] to not pressure to just to get it right.
[1:30:17] Pressure to not, you know, do the wrong
[1:30:19] the wrong thing. Pressure to make sure
[1:30:22] that everybody's included. You didn't
[1:30:25] offend anyone. Pressure. It's a pressure
[1:30:28] all the time and everybody's under it.
[1:30:30] How many you know what I'm talking
[1:30:31] about?
[1:30:33] constantly trying to, you know, appease
[1:30:37] and make things, you know, how they
[1:30:39] should be. And that's just working
[1:30:41] within yourself. If you're a
[1:30:44] conscientious person, you're constantly,
[1:30:46] you put the pressure on yourself many
[1:30:49] times to get things right. And that's
[1:30:52] the age that we're in. We're constantly
[1:30:54] under this pressure. But, you know, this
[1:30:57] is what this is by
[1:30:59] design. And this is the hour that we
[1:31:02] live in because we're nearing the
[1:31:06] headstone. And as the headstone nears,
[1:31:08] it gets tighter and tighter and tighter.
[1:31:11] And that's where people fall off. That's
[1:31:14] where the people start to expose
[1:31:16] themselves. The the manifestation of the
[1:31:19] seeds come into fruition. We can now see
[1:31:24] people doing things we would never
[1:31:25] thought they would do. groups, churches,
[1:31:30] ministries, doing things we've been
[1:31:32] never thought. But then sometimes even
[1:31:34] us, we don't even know what's really in
[1:31:36] us, but the pressure will bring it out
[1:31:39] of us. And we try to hide it, but we
[1:31:42] really shouldn't hide it. We should let
[1:31:44] the pressure bring it out while there's
[1:31:47] a remedy just in case something needs to
[1:31:50] be repaired. Amenise. Amen. So this um
[1:31:56] this this bride and this you know this
[1:32:00] um baster
[1:32:02] child that that really as you go deeper
[1:32:05] into it it's someone that that cannot or
[1:32:09] will not receive
[1:32:12] um they go without it let's say I mean
[1:32:16] even a even if a child I mean maybe he
[1:32:19] doesn't even know he needs to be
[1:32:20] corrected that's remember some of the
[1:32:22] worst kids I can think of is a child who
[1:32:26] has never got a
[1:32:28] spanking or correction. Okay, let's say
[1:32:30] it that way. I don't want to get an
[1:32:32] abuse charge here. Okay, a child who's
[1:32:36] never been corrected or a man or a woman
[1:32:40] that has never gone through their life
[1:32:42] without correction. Could you imagine
[1:32:44] what that would be? What would that look
[1:32:47] like? And so in the word of God, could
[1:32:49] you imagine a child of God, a Christian
[1:32:53] that goes without correction? Well, the
[1:32:57] Lord declares it as a bastard child.
[1:33:02] It's pretty strong. Let's read it just
[1:33:04] for a moment. Hebrews chapter 12
[1:33:14] quickly. Verses 6 through 6 through 12.
[1:33:18] For whom the Lord loveth, he
[1:33:22] chastineth and
[1:33:24] scourgeth. Every son whom he receiveth.
[1:33:28] If you endure chastening, God deal with
[1:33:31] you dealeth with you as with sons. For
[1:33:35] what son is he whom the father
[1:33:37] chestineth not? That's a question. But
[1:33:40] if you be without chastisement, whereof
[1:33:43] all are partakers, then are ye what?
[1:33:49] Bastards. And not sons. One translation
[1:33:52] says, "And not true
[1:33:55] sons." I like that.
[1:33:58] then you're bastards and not a true son,
[1:34:02] not true
[1:34:03] sons. Furthermore, and the scripture
[1:34:06] goes on, how we have fathers who has
[1:34:08] chastised us and used this and exercised
[1:34:10] this upon us
[1:34:13] um in the naturals, how much more the
[1:34:16] father of spirits. And so this is uh
[1:34:21] something that brother Brandham deals
[1:34:22] with this. He they got it into questions
[1:34:25] and answers about high breeding and
[1:34:28] wasn't so from the beginning. He makes
[1:34:30] this statement here and high breeding
[1:34:31] paragraph 107. High breeding was such a
[1:34:34] horrible thing in the Old Testament. A
[1:34:36] bastard child could not enter into the
[1:34:38] congregation of the Lord. 10
[1:34:40] generations. Nothing to breed him out.
[1:34:43] Only that sin. Think 10 generations. 400
[1:34:48] years before ille illegitimate child
[1:34:50] could ever come into the kingdom of God.
[1:34:53] There was no serum to take care of him.
[1:34:56] He had to just breathe it out through
[1:34:58] the families. 400 years before
[1:35:01] illegitimate child could come into the
[1:35:03] congregation of the Lord. But
[1:35:06] today, since the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:35:09] has been shed, you've been interbred by
[1:35:13] all different kinds of ideas. The Holy
[1:35:15] Spirit is here this morning to breed you
[1:35:19] back to the original, bring you back to
[1:35:22] Pentecost, breed you back. and we sit
[1:35:26] together this morning in heavenly places
[1:35:30] in Christ Jesus.
[1:35:32] Amen. Some of you sit here and maybe
[1:35:34] say, "Well, you know, I'm not a pastor
[1:35:35] child." But if you get your family tree
[1:35:37] out and go looking back a few
[1:35:39] generations, you might want to close
[1:35:41] your
[1:35:42] mouth. Uh I mean, the the dysfunction is
[1:35:46] just on on every level. It was the
[1:35:48] original sin. And so that sin has just
[1:35:51] caused so much chaos and so much trauma.
[1:35:54] And so this is why you had to be born
[1:35:58] again. This is why we need the new
[1:36:00] birth. And not only one time we need the
[1:36:03] new birth. We need the Holy Spirit to
[1:36:06] continue to birth in us as brother
[1:36:09] Brandham brought us in the stature of a
[1:36:10] perfect man. And it also blasphemeth
[1:36:13] names. You're birthed into this, into
[1:36:17] this, into this. Seven virtues that we
[1:36:20] need to be birthed into. Can I get a
[1:36:23] witness? Yeah. Because we need the
[1:36:26] breeding of the old man out of us and
[1:36:30] the new man bred in us through the word
[1:36:32] of life. This is why when I say make a
[1:36:35] statement like justified, you never done
[1:36:37] it in the first place. Your flesh wants
[1:36:40] to say, "Yeah, right." But the scripture
[1:36:43] says therefore whom he has justified.
[1:36:47] When God declares a man just, who can
[1:36:49] say different? When God says I don't
[1:36:52] impute any sin, who can say different?
[1:36:55] When God says I don't
[1:36:58] remember, who can remember
[1:37:01] their sins and their iniquities I will
[1:37:05] remember no more. That's what the word
[1:37:08] says. Yes, sir.
[1:37:11] Amen.
[1:37:12] So, you need to hear that. And when you
[1:37:14] hear that, it's breeding.
[1:37:17] It's the breeding. It's the Holy Spirit
[1:37:20] breathing into you what the word of God
[1:37:23] says
[1:37:25] because your family tree, you listen to
[1:37:28] that ancestry.com. You look at that. You
[1:37:32] go look up this and this and that and
[1:37:34] for and this and that. You need to get
[1:37:37] into these seven seals. You need to get
[1:37:39] into this message.
[1:37:42] You need to get into the Bible.
[1:37:45] Their sins and their iniquities I will
[1:37:48] remember no more. Oh my. Thank you,
[1:37:53] Jesus.
[1:37:55] Oh yes.
[1:37:58] So, but now we have the new birth. The
[1:38:01] prophet of God takes the spoken word as
[1:38:03] the original seed. And this is part
[1:38:05] number one I believe in paragraph number
[1:38:08] 161 and he's talking about high breeding
[1:38:11] of the
[1:38:13] word say you breed it you ain't got
[1:38:16] nothing but a denominational bastard
[1:38:18] child that's all anything deny the
[1:38:22] word so see how he tied that anything
[1:38:26] deny the word excuse me sisters I want
[1:38:29] you I just got to say just the way it
[1:38:32] says it here see and that's the way it
[1:38:34] is. All of God's sons must be the same.
[1:38:39] Yes, sir. To be born of the word and
[1:38:42] spirit brings us back to the spoken word
[1:38:46] again. Amen. Isn't that what we're
[1:38:49] trying to get back to? The spoken word.
[1:38:52] Amen.
[1:38:55] I mean, your family album is great.
[1:38:58] That's beautiful. But the spoken word is
[1:39:01] what we're trying to get back to.
[1:39:06] Amen. The prophet of God moves forward
[1:39:09] in the message Jehovah Gyra. He says
[1:39:11] this here said, "Great testings."
[1:39:14] Paragraph
[1:39:15] 121, "Great testings." Now, Abraham
[1:39:18] after all of these wonderful things, he
[1:39:20] was tested after he received the
[1:39:22] blessing. Abraham was tested. Now,
[1:39:25] there's where people fail. Now, listen
[1:39:27] real close now. Don't miss it. The Bible
[1:39:30] said every son that cometh to God must
[1:39:32] be
[1:39:33] chassened, chasti, chastised, whipped.
[1:39:37] If we cannot stand a chastisement, we
[1:39:39] become bastard children and not the
[1:39:42] children of God. It proves that our
[1:39:45] faith wasn't what we said it
[1:39:48] was. We haven't got what we profess to
[1:39:52] have. Now we're getting down in some
[1:39:54] real good Calvinism now. So we have to
[1:39:58] watch that. Now notice, every son that
[1:40:01] cometh to God must be chasened, chastise
[1:40:05] the word, whip him, and cut him to
[1:40:09] pieces. Knock every creed out from under
[1:40:12] him. See, tried and see if he is the son
[1:40:16] of God. So who does the
[1:40:18] whipping now? This is not mama and
[1:40:20] daddy. This is not pastor whipping you.
[1:40:24] This is not you whipping yourself. This
[1:40:26] is the word of God taking all the creeds
[1:40:29] and unbelief out of you. Aren't you
[1:40:32] interested in that at all cost? Don't
[1:40:35] you want the unbelief taken out of you
[1:40:38] to where there's no unbelief anywhere in
[1:40:41] you? And when you stand before him, when
[1:40:44] the Son of Man returns, will I find
[1:40:47] faith? Will I find people that believe
[1:40:50] my word?
[1:40:52] not halfway believe, not part-time
[1:40:54] believe, but I don't want any unbelief
[1:40:57] in me, Lord. So, let your word,
[1:41:01] not the reverend, not this one, let your
[1:41:04] word whip it all out of me.
[1:41:08] Because I am a son of God.
[1:41:11] I am a child of the most high God. His
[1:41:15] royal blood is flowing through my veins
[1:41:18] and I am bone of his bone.
[1:41:21] flesh of his flesh.
[1:41:25] Amen.
[1:41:27] And that's the flesh that we eat upon.
[1:41:29] Is that right?
[1:41:31] Oh my. Questions and answers. They asked
[1:41:34] a question about a baby born out of
[1:41:36] wedlock. Can they go in the rapture? And
[1:41:38] brother goes on in paragraph 188. He
[1:41:41] says, "But you see, there was nothing
[1:41:43] there strong enough to forgive that sin.
[1:41:45] The blood of the Old Testament did not
[1:41:46] forgive sin. It covered sins. But the
[1:41:49] blood of Jesus Christ divorces it.
[1:41:52] That's different. Now, when the blood of
[1:41:55] Jesus Christ comes in, it's different.
[1:42:03] So, when you go to fill out another
[1:42:05] application and they ask you your
[1:42:08] race, create your own little space
[1:42:12] there. No, don't do that. You got to,
[1:42:14] you
[1:42:15] know, but it would be nice though. Put
[1:42:19] your own little space. I'm part of the
[1:42:21] super race. Like, oh, what you talking
[1:42:23] about? Tell them come on to our church
[1:42:26] and come find out what we talking about.
[1:42:29] Amen.
[1:42:32] Glory to God. Amen. Amen. Now, because
[1:42:36] we're a part of this race, because we're
[1:42:39] a part of his body, we are on our way to
[1:42:43] the great wedding supper in the sky.
[1:42:46] We've been called to that feast. We're
[1:42:50] part of him. He made us a part of him.
[1:42:55] Now, let's take in
[1:42:58] this building. The the Lord types this
[1:43:03] building with the pyramid and the statue
[1:43:05] of a perfect man. And in 1961, let's
[1:43:13] see. Let's take God hiding in I'm sorry.
[1:43:16] God hiding in
[1:43:18] simplicity. No, that's not
[1:43:21] it. It is. Let me get it for you here.
[1:43:44] I have it back there. Paragraph 182,
[1:43:49] 1961, 210. The prophet of
[1:43:52] God makes this statement here. All
[1:43:55] right.
[1:44:07] All
[1:44:07] right. What title was that, sis? Abraham
[1:44:11] in his covenant.
[1:44:12] [Music]
[1:44:15] Yes. The prophet makes this statement
[1:44:21] here. Now, you love the Lord.
[1:44:25] All right.
[1:44:40] And what did he say about how he would
[1:44:42] continue this faith of the seed? He tore
[1:44:45] Christ apart, took his body up, and set
[1:44:47] him up there as a bloody sacrifice,
[1:44:50] setting at the right hand of God.
[1:44:56] obsessions upon our confessions. A high
[1:44:59] priest that can be touched by the
[1:45:01] fillings of our infirmities, the same
[1:45:03] yesterday, today, and forever. And his
[1:45:05] spirit was upon his spirit was upon him
[1:45:09] is back in the church, doing the same
[1:45:13] works that he did, carrying on the same
[1:45:16] thing, right?
[1:45:18] shaping up the church for that headstone
[1:45:21] to come on it someday. Hallelujah.
[1:45:26] So, we're being shaped. We're being
[1:45:29] shaped. How many How many can receive
[1:45:32] that? We are being shaped for what? For
[1:45:35] the headstone to come.
[1:45:39] Now, he goes into the adoption message
[1:45:41] here. um paragraph uh uh adoption number
[1:45:46] four and paragraph number 32 he makes
[1:45:50] this statement here. Now we're coming
[1:45:52] right down
[1:45:55] um to where I believe this woman here
[1:45:59] raised her hand that she had studied the
[1:46:01] pyramid. You know the pyramid never was
[1:46:03] capped was it? Never had a capstone put
[1:46:06] on it. They never they couldn't even
[1:46:08] find it. They didn't know what ever
[1:46:10] happened to it. Why? Why wasn't the
[1:46:12] capstone put on it, the headstone, the
[1:46:14] top of it? Because he was rejected when
[1:46:17] he come. He was the rejected stone.
[1:46:19] That's right. But it will be capped.
[1:46:22] That's right. And then those stones that
[1:46:25] fit around that headstone will have to
[1:46:28] be stones that'll be so completely like
[1:46:33] that
[1:46:34] stone. It'll fit in joint every
[1:46:37] everywhere. The pyramid is so perfect
[1:46:41] you can't run a razor blade between them
[1:46:44] where them stones go together. Such
[1:46:48] beautiful masonry.
[1:46:50] Look at your neighbor and say,
[1:46:52] "Beautiful
[1:46:53] masonry." That's what you are.
[1:46:57] Yes. Some of them weigh hundreds of tons
[1:47:00] up in the air and so perfectly set
[1:47:04] together. That's the way God's bringing
[1:47:06] this church. We are fitly joined
[1:47:09] together. One heart, one accord. Now,
[1:47:12] somebody say, "Well, the Lutheran back
[1:47:13] there ain't nothing." Don't you believe
[1:47:16] it? The Lutheran will come forth in the
[1:47:17] resurrection just the same as the rest
[1:47:19] will come forth in the resurrection.
[1:47:21] Baptist, Presbyterian, all of God's
[1:47:23] children will come forth in that
[1:47:25] resurrection. That's the reason today
[1:47:28] people say, "Oh, well, there'll be a
[1:47:29] sweeping revival that'll go out here and
[1:47:32] save hundred 100 million Pentecostals.
[1:47:35] They'll all get saved and there'll be
[1:47:37] the rapture. You're
[1:47:39] mistaken. The that rapture will be
[1:47:41] hundreds of thousands. That's right. But
[1:47:44] they're being made up in 6,000 years of
[1:47:47] salvation, too. See, 6,000 years back,
[1:47:50] man walks in the light. Brother Adam
[1:47:53] continues on. Paragraph 34. Now notice
[1:47:55] then the coming of the Lord Jesus is so
[1:47:58] close at
[1:47:59] hand until the spirit from way down here
[1:48:03] just barely justification,
[1:48:06] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:48:08] Spirit and now right into the time of
[1:48:11] the coming of the headstone. The church
[1:48:14] has got to be so perfectly like Christ
[1:48:19] until Christ and the church can unite
[1:48:21] together the same spirit. And if the
[1:48:25] spirit of Christ is in you, it makes you
[1:48:27] live the life of Christ. Act like the
[1:48:30] life of Christ. Do the works of Christ.
[1:48:33] He that believeth on me, the works that
[1:48:35] I do shall he do also. Jesus said that.
[1:48:38] See, now we're going to have we're going
[1:48:42] to have we got a ministry coming that's
[1:48:46] just exactly like the life of Christ.
[1:48:50] What does that ministry identify? the
[1:48:53] coming of the Lord.
[1:48:56] Look in the world today. Brother Madam
[1:48:58] continues on
[1:49:01] in that message. He goes
[1:49:05] forward. And so this is the time that
[1:49:07] the sons and daughters of God were to be
[1:49:11] made
[1:49:13] manifested. Tell me of a time that they
[1:49:16] were to be manifested. if it isn't this
[1:49:19] time.
[1:49:21] He amen.
[1:49:24] He tells us
[1:49:27] this in that same message, adoption
[1:49:30] number four, he says, "When was the time
[1:49:32] that the sons of God was ever to be
[1:49:35] manifested outside of this time?" Now,
[1:49:39] when were there ever a time in history
[1:49:42] there was to manifest a time to deliver
[1:49:45] all nature? Nature. The nature itself is
[1:49:48] groaning, waiting for the time of the
[1:49:51] manifestation. Why? Before the atonement
[1:49:54] was made, before the Holy Ghost was ever
[1:49:56] poured out, before all the Old Testament
[1:49:58] on down there, there couldn't have been
[1:50:01] manifestations. It had it had to wait
[1:50:04] till what time? This time. Now all
[1:50:09] things has been brought coming shaping
[1:50:13] up to the headstone to the manifestation
[1:50:16] of the sons of God. Coming back in the
[1:50:19] spirit of God coming into these men so
[1:50:23] perfectly until their ministry will be
[1:50:26] so close like Christ till it will join
[1:50:30] him and his church together.
[1:50:34] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. You
[1:50:37] know, that's what we're looking forward
[1:50:40] to.
[1:50:41] I am not satisfied with staying the way
[1:50:45] I am. And I'm really grateful what the
[1:50:48] Lord has done for me. I am really
[1:50:51] thankful to be saved and to know that
[1:50:55] I'm headed for eternity, able to look
[1:50:59] the Lord in the face and say, "Lord,
[1:51:00] I've done what you asked me to do. when
[1:51:04] you put it on my heart to do it, I did
[1:51:06] it. And that's a beautiful place to be.
[1:51:10] And that's wonderful to be in a place
[1:51:11] where like if you die, you get to go to
[1:51:14] heaven.
[1:51:16] We're where who's going to complain
[1:51:18] about that? I I am grateful for that. So
[1:51:20] So don't get me wrong, I am very
[1:51:22] satisfied with being a Christian. Amen.
[1:51:25] But as science has progressed over the
[1:51:29] years, over the last 40 years, when I
[1:51:32] came into the word, what we were doing
[1:51:35] scientifically and what we're doing
[1:51:37] today, they're far well advanced. They
[1:51:40] don't have the pride to say this is it.
[1:51:43] Scientists at least have the humility to
[1:51:45] say, you know what, we can do it faster.
[1:51:48] We can make it smaller. We can do it
[1:51:50] better. But church folks, many times
[1:51:54] they get into this attitude like they've
[1:51:58] arrived. When there's explosions
[1:52:02] happening every day in your Bible,
[1:52:05] every time you listen to a tape, another
[1:52:07] dynamic explosion is ready to take off
[1:52:10] if you can receive it.
[1:52:13] And I don't want to be I don't want to
[1:52:15] be set down and set back and so laidback
[1:52:19] that I can't get deeper into the word
[1:52:22] that God I'm not talking about a new
[1:52:24] word. I'm talking about the old time
[1:52:27] word. Go into that and let an explosion
[1:52:31] take off.
[1:52:33] And find God in there. Find some faith
[1:52:37] that you never had before. Find some
[1:52:40] wisdom that you never had before. walk
[1:52:42] in an atmosphere that you've never
[1:52:44] walked before as a son or a daughter of
[1:52:47] God because you're not from your mama
[1:52:49] and your daddy. You are his flesh, his
[1:52:52] bones. His life is living in you. You
[1:52:57] are the super race.
[1:52:59] You're the manifestation of Abraham's
[1:53:01] seed.
[1:53:03] Amen. We don't hold our heads down. We
[1:53:06] pick our heads up again. Let's go back
[1:53:09] to Hebrews again for a moment. Hebrews
[1:53:11] chapter, where were we at? 12.
[1:53:14] Somebody help the preacher preach. Where
[1:53:16] were we at this? Say it out.
[1:53:19] Hebrews 12. Let's turn there
[1:53:27] quickly. Brothers and
[1:53:29] sisters, we is we are sons and daughters
[1:53:34] of the most high God.
[1:53:37] That's my daddy.
[1:53:40] He created the heavens and the earth. He
[1:53:42] created the solar system. My daddy did
[1:53:46] it all. I'm one of his sons.
[1:53:50] Yeah. I have a little problem here. I go
[1:53:52] to my dad. And my dad got the power to
[1:53:57] change anything I'm going through. I'm
[1:54:00] talking about my father, my heavenly
[1:54:03] father. That's who I identify. I am a
[1:54:06] son of God.
[1:54:09] We're sons and daughters of God. Amen,
[1:54:12] somebody.
[1:54:15] Hebrews chapter
[1:54:18] 12 talking about
[1:54:20] this
[1:54:25] correction. No verse 11. Now no chest
[1:54:28] for the present seemth to be what?
[1:54:32] Joyous, but what? Grievious.
[1:54:35] Nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the
[1:54:37] peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[1:54:41] them which are exercised thereby.
[1:54:45] Therefore, one translation says,
[1:54:50] "Therefore, lift up the hands which hang
[1:54:55] down and the feeble knees, and make
[1:54:59] straight paths for your feet, lest that
[1:55:02] which is lame be turned out of the way.
[1:55:06] But let it rather be healed." Lift up
[1:55:09] your head,
[1:55:11] sister, brother. Lift up your head.
[1:55:17] You're not an
[1:55:18] American. You're not a Canadian. You're
[1:55:21] not African.
[1:55:23] You're not Jewish. You're not Jew
[1:55:25] Egyptian. You're not none of that. You
[1:55:27] are son of God. You're a daughter of
[1:55:30] God.
[1:55:33] A race that Satan doesn't know what to
[1:55:36] do with. A race of people that he can't
[1:55:39] stop no matter what he does. Their
[1:55:42] original father went into the
[1:55:44] grave. We had him. We whipped him. We
[1:55:47] beat him all night long. We put him in
[1:55:49] the grave. It was over with. Yay. The
[1:55:51] darkness can the demons and devils can
[1:55:53] party now. But no, within three days he
[1:55:56] got up
[1:55:57] again with all power in his hands and he
[1:56:02] set it up on high. He gave gifts unto
[1:56:05] men. And a few days later, the spirit
[1:56:08] came back upon the little church and
[1:56:10] they were filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:56:13] they went through Jerusalem
[1:56:16] laying hands on the sick, casting out
[1:56:19] devils, raising the dead.
[1:56:22] They said Jesus is in them people.
[1:56:26] Why? We're sons and daughters of God.
[1:56:31] Our journey didn't start here. Amen.
[1:56:35] Talking about happy birthday. You don't
[1:56:36] even know when your birthday was.
[1:56:39] It's before the foundation of the world.
[1:56:42] Glory.
[1:56:44] I'm a Gemini. I'm a Capricorn. You was
[1:56:47] born before the foundation of the world.
[1:56:53] Give somebody high five real quick.
[1:56:57] Amen.
[1:57:00] Yes.
[1:57:01] That's what we talking about.
[1:57:04] That's the astrology we're talking about
[1:57:06] this morning before the foundation of
[1:57:09] the world. It's a super sign.
[1:57:14] It's a super people.
[1:57:16] It's a super race.
[1:57:19] We got a super anointing.
[1:57:22] It's a super word. Our Bible is a super
[1:57:27] book. It's the best of all books. And
[1:57:31] when that word is in my life, I become a
[1:57:35] super being,
[1:57:37] a superchild of God.
[1:57:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:42] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:57:47] He made us this.
[1:57:50] This is what the word of the Lord
[1:57:51] declared for us.
[1:57:53] Now in this spoken words the original
[1:57:57] season I prepare to close
[1:58:00] here the prophet of God is
[1:58:04] laying as the spirit of God moved him to
[1:58:07] pick up his pen. Remember
[1:58:10] that.
[1:58:14] And he says this
[1:58:18] here. Spoken word is the original
[1:58:22] seed. Paragraph 414 or
[1:58:27] 4 or 352 whichever one depending on the
[1:58:31] book I
[1:58:34] think. Excuse me saints. All right.
[1:58:42] Here's what the prophet
[1:58:44] says. All
[1:58:49] right. Oh
[1:58:52] my. Excuse me just a
[1:58:57] moment.
[1:59:00] That's okay.
[1:59:07] in pick up your pen. The spirit moved
[1:59:09] the prophet to write this and he says
[1:59:13] now here's what I'm trying to say to
[1:59:14] you. The law of reproduction to bring
[1:59:16] forth of its kind. Genesis 1:11. These
[1:59:20] last
[1:59:21] days true church
[1:59:24] bride comes to the
[1:59:26] headstones will be the super
[1:59:30] church a super
[1:59:32] race as the nears the great headstone.
[1:59:37] There will be so much like so much like
[1:59:40] him even they will be in his very image.
[1:59:47] That's right.
[1:59:50] Now, is that true or not?
[1:59:53] So, what does he look like?
[1:59:56] Well, look around.
[2:00:00] I remember I was in a going to a camp
[2:00:02] meeting. This little kid was little
[2:00:04] child was at at a camp meeting. We were
[2:00:06] all riding with different people from
[2:00:08] different locations. Little white little
[2:00:10] kid. He was sitting in my truck or my
[2:00:13] car.
[2:00:15] I noticed him looking at my hands. And
[2:00:18] then he looked at his hands and he
[2:00:20] looked at my hands and he looked at me.
[2:00:23] He says, "Brother Israel, what color is
[2:00:28] God?" He's trying to figure this out.
[2:00:30] You know, he's
[2:00:32] looking and I told him he's whatever
[2:00:34] color he's dwelling in.
[2:00:38] So, it depends on who he's in. That's
[2:00:40] what color he is.
[2:00:43] And so you want to see what the Lord
[2:00:44] looks like, then look around. Look
[2:00:47] around the people that's in the word
[2:00:49] that's staying with the message. That's
[2:00:52] the bride of Jesus Christ. This is the
[2:00:55] race of people that we talking about,
[2:00:57] the super race. Amen. Amen.
[2:01:01] Well, uh uh um it'll be a super race as
[2:01:04] it nears the great headstone. They will
[2:01:06] be so much like so much like him even
[2:01:08] they will be in his very image in the
[2:01:12] order to being united with him they will
[2:01:14] be one they will be the very
[2:01:17] manifestation of the word of the living
[2:01:20] God denominations can never produce
[2:01:25] this they will produce creeds dogmas
[2:01:28] mixed with the word and brings a
[2:01:31] hybrid
[2:01:33] product drop down
[2:01:35] Then from a little group of the true
[2:01:38] seed of the word, God will present
[2:01:40] Christ a beloved bride, a virgin, a
[2:01:43] virgin of his word. And through them and
[2:01:46] by them will be fulfilled all that has
[2:01:49] been promised for his word in the virgin
[2:01:53] who knows no man-made creeds or dogmas.
[2:01:56] Praise the Lord. So there's so much more
[2:02:02] in there. Here I want to take one more
[2:02:04] quotation on this on this dynamics here.
[2:02:09] The prophet of God is
[2:02:12] um talking about the the church shaping
[2:02:17] up that we're waiting for the
[2:02:22] dynamics. See if I can find it here for
[2:02:24] you
[2:02:27] quickly. And that's how the Lord works
[2:02:29] through
[2:02:30] us is birth after
[2:02:34] birth. It's
[2:02:37] anointing. It's
[2:02:39] more of his word being fulfilled and
[2:02:42] revealed to
[2:02:44] us. Is that right?
[2:02:47] The denominations can't produce what
[2:02:50] we're talking about.
[2:02:52] They will produce a lot of people.
[2:02:54] They'll produce a basketball team or
[2:02:57] sports team. They'll produce lots of
[2:02:59] entertainment. They'll produce groups of
[2:03:03] people that um only go so far in the
[2:03:08] word, but they can never
[2:03:12] produce a bride getting ready for the
[2:03:18] rapture. They can't produce it. They
[2:03:20] don't have what it takes.
[2:03:23] Um the Lord sent to us this great and
[2:03:25] mighty move of God, this
[2:03:27] message to get a bride ready, a people
[2:03:31] ready.
[2:03:33] And through not just the the
[2:03:35] birth, we get the new birth and the Holy
[2:03:38] Spirit, we get forgiven of our sins, but
[2:03:40] then he begins to birth more truth to us
[2:03:46] and we're getting deeper and deeper.
[2:03:48] We're growing in his grace and his
[2:03:50] truth. Amen. How many can say amen
[2:03:54] to that process that you know the Lord
[2:03:58] has his life? He has your life under his
[2:04:02] control. He has orchestrated your life
[2:04:06] and he has it all in his hands. He's
[2:04:09] he's working out all the details and he
[2:04:11] brings things in to your way and you
[2:04:14] know everything that you don't like
[2:04:16] about yourself. The new birth takes care
[2:04:19] of all of that. The word birth takes
[2:04:22] care of all of the
[2:04:23] inconsistencies, all of the areas of
[2:04:26] your life that you failed and you falter
[2:04:28] and the things you don't like about this
[2:04:30] and you failed and and this and that.
[2:04:32] But in the mind of God, he doesn't
[2:04:34] remember your iniquities because he's
[2:04:37] declared you just
[2:04:40] justified. He declares that just like he
[2:04:43] said in the beginning
[2:04:46] uh in the beginning he said let there be
[2:04:48] light and there was light and when he
[2:04:52] says you have no sin you have been
[2:04:54] justified then that's what it is it's a
[2:04:58] creation you're part of that original
[2:05:01] creation and he was that firstborn son
[2:05:06] spoken word son with no sin in his life
[2:05:09] and he lived a life above of sin. I was
[2:05:12] listening there's talking about this
[2:05:14] gentleman
[2:05:15] um Mr. Todd, Mike Todd. He's a
[2:05:18] well-known preacher and he's talking
[2:05:20] about for years and years he's never
[2:05:22] committed sin. He hasn't lied in 14
[2:05:24] years. He has all these boastful claims
[2:05:27] and then people that left the ministry
[2:05:29] said he's the biggest liar that they
[2:05:32] know. It's like if you haven't lied for
[2:05:35] 14 or 15
[2:05:37] years, you don't need to tell that to
[2:05:39] everybody. Well, you trying to prove
[2:05:41] something because maybe something going
[2:05:43] on
[2:05:44] there. But you know what? In the in the
[2:05:47] in and there's a reality of people,
[2:05:50] there is a there's a group of people
[2:05:53] that has never told a lie. They have
[2:05:56] never sinned.
[2:05:59] Who are those people?
[2:06:02] Some mysterious group of people. Yeah,
[2:06:04] there's this group of people that are
[2:06:05] justifi they're mysterious. They're way
[2:06:07] over there somewhere. No, my brother,
[2:06:09] son, they're here. They're
[2:06:13] here. And when I can see them in the
[2:06:15] mirror of his word and see that that I
[2:06:19] am what he's talking
[2:06:22] about. Oh God have mercy. God help us be
[2:06:26] a part of this super race. God bless you
[2:06:29] so much richly.
[2:06:32] This message here, super sign, it's in
[2:06:34] the back there. You can get a book of
[2:06:35] it. Listen to it. I like to hear the
[2:06:37] tape. It is nice to read because when
[2:06:41] you read this, you won't get any popups
[2:06:45] or
[2:06:46] advertisements. You won't get no
[2:06:48] notifications only from the Holy Spirit.
[2:06:51] All the notifications will come from
[2:06:53] above when you got a book in your hand.
[2:06:56] All right? So, they're free. They're
[2:06:58] right out there. God bless you so much.
[2:07:00] Let us pray. Musicians, come please.
[2:07:02] Amen. Heavenly
[2:07:04] Father, we ask your blessings
[2:07:07] upon Lord. We tried to deliver this word
[2:07:10] and thank you for touching me in my
[2:07:12] body. But Lord, your word is is life to
[2:07:16] us. It's so true, Lord. It really is.
[2:07:20] The only thing that is true is what you
[2:07:22] said is
[2:07:23] eternal. What you've declared that is
[2:07:26] eternal. It is.
[2:07:29] And Lord, we're part of your body.
[2:07:33] were flesh of your flesh, bone of your
[2:07:37] bone. Lord, you said through the prophet
[2:07:40] there in the first
[2:07:41] seal, I'm going to call you
[2:07:45] bride. He was preaching to the saints,
[2:07:48] talking about these great
[2:07:50] things. He referred to us as the church.
[2:07:53] He he brought God hiding in simplicity.
[2:07:56] And then he brings
[2:07:58] in justification and the bleach of the
[2:08:01] blood and the
[2:08:03] breach. And then in that first seal, he
[2:08:06] he says, "I I'm speaking to the bride."
[2:08:08] He says, "I'm going to call you
[2:08:11] bride, Lord. I receive that this
[2:08:14] morning. I I receive that. I've called
[2:08:19] myself
[2:08:21] things. Others have called me things.
[2:08:24] I've named myself what I think I am. But
[2:08:28] to hear the word call me
[2:08:31] bride. Oh, that's what I identify with
[2:08:35] this morning. May each one hear that
[2:08:38] call, hear that
[2:08:40] voice. May you grant that to them.
[2:08:42] Everyone we pray. It's in Jesus name we
[2:08:46] ask it. Amen. God bless
[2:08:52] you. Glory.
