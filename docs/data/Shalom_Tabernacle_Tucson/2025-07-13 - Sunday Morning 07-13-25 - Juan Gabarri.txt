========================================

[Music] Good morning everyone. Can we all stand? We'll open up in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful Lord. We're honored to be here this morning coming before you, Lord, for this portion of just a 20 minute portion of Sunday school, Lord, to hear some of the best preaching, Lord, that you've allowed us to hear, Father. Lord Jesus, you said, Lord, did you stand at the door and knock? And if any man hear your voice and open that door, you'll come into him. Lord, what more could we ask than for you to come into us, Father? It's so simple. Give us a personal revelation, Lord, of you, Father, in our lives, Lord, and what you want to achieve through us, Father. Be with the children in their Sunday school class, Lord, everyone that may be on the way. Lord, we just dedicate this time to you, Father, this Sunday, all that would be said and done. and we thank you for it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. We're going to be starting the Leoysian church age spoken of in Revelation um chapter 3 and I believe that was um well you you see it in your text. I don't have the exact verse, but anyway, we're going to start with paragraph 43, Brother Brandon preaching, and end at paragraph 73. Can we all sing only believe? Only believe, only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. only believe. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; We believe that the Lady Oian church started in AD 1906. I predict now remember predict especially you listen at the tape. I don't say it will be but predict that it will end by 1977. that the church will go completely into apostasy and shall be ousted out of the mouth of God and the second coming or the rapture of Christ might come anytime. I can miss that a year. I can miss it 20 years. I can miss it a 100 years. I don't know where but I just predict that according to a vision he showed me and taking the time the way it's progressing I say it'll be sometime between 33 and 77 at at least this great nation is going to strike a war that's going to blow it to bits. See now that's pretty close. &gt;&gt; It's awful close. Now I could be wrong. I'm predicting. Everybody understand? Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the Lord showed me a vision of the great powerful woman in 33 19 and 33. It's on paper. How that Roosevelt cause he helped cause the world to go to war. How that Musculenia would make his first invasion to Ethiopia and he would take it but he'd come to a disgraceful end. And how that then the threeism Nazism, fascism, and communism would all wind up in communism. And how many in here remembers me just keep have you standing straight over like say watch Russia watch Russia the king of the north watch Russia king of the north watch Russia king of the north how many's heard me say just wave that over and over over the old-timers you see back in the early part of the church just stand there and wave it over and over watch Russia the king of the north see what he would do for all those isms will heap up into Russia then I said that This nation would finally go to war with Germany and Germany would be built in a concrete wall. That was imagine all 11 years before it was ever started to build it. 11 years before &gt;&gt; and I said the Americans will take an awful beating at that line. Some of these brethren here was at that line. Brother Royerson and them asked them what happened. &gt;&gt; Yes, they did. &gt;&gt; They sure did. All right. But finally I said we will overcome and we'll be one of the winner in the war between us and Germany. Now I said then after that time it science would really progress. They did the media atomic bomb and everything. I said during their progression they would make a cars would constantly begin to shape like an egg. You remember the big old hood on the 1933 the big back come down like this the spare tire on the back of it. Look how it is now. See, streamline. See, like an egg. And I said, "Finally, they'll invent a car that you only have to have a steering wheel in." I seen a family going down the C road and a glass top car. Great big fine looking roads and fine car. And they were sitting looking at one another and the car was running by itself going right around the curves and everything. And they've got the car right now. It's already invented. They've got the car. And I said, "Then oh, how science will progress in that day." I said, "Then I seen a They're going to permit women and are permitting women to vote and by voting they'll elect the wrong man some of these days and you did it the last election &gt;&gt; cuz the woman's votes at le Kennedy we know that. See between the crooked machines and things fixed up FBI exposed and how could anybody do something about it? &gt;&gt; Why ain't something sad? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Afraid somebody lose their job. You see it's just a bunch of politics rotting to the core. That's right. That's all. &gt;&gt; Sure. There ain't no ain't no isn't no excuse me. &gt;&gt; There is no salvation in this nation. That's right. &gt;&gt; There's no salvation in any nation. Salvation's in Jesus Christ. Amen. That's &gt;&gt; right. Now, I'm thankful for America. I'd rather live here than any place in the world because outside of Canada, Canada and United States is twins. Uh we know that neighboring nations, wonderful place. But I I believe I'd rather live here than anywhere I know of because it's my home. I'm glad that I am an American and thankful for it. But I tell you, it certainly needs a counter revival. &gt;&gt; It sure does. And it will not get it. &gt;&gt; No sir, she'll never rise again. No sir, she's gone. You remember about five years ago in Chicago? That's on tape. You got it, Jean. I said they'll either accept it this year or they'll constantly drop down and they've done it and they will do it till she'll finally meet her in. But there'll be a powerful woman. Now remember this is on tape too. A powerful woman, great woman. She'll either be president or it'll be a woman representing the Catholic Church, which I think it is, will take over here someday and she'll rule this country. This nation is a woman's nation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Flag was made by a woman. It's number 13. She started out 13 stars, 13 stripes, 13 columnies. Everything's 13. 13. 13. Right on down. 13 stars on her silver dollar. Now everything's a 13. It's number 13. The appears in the 13th chapter of Revelations. Completely 13. Everything is woman, woman, woman, woman, woman right on down. She's took over all the offices. She's tuck over Hollywood. She's tuck over the nations. She's tuck over the offices. She's stuck over everything there is. Equal rights for the man, votes for the man, cusses like a man, drinks like a man, anything else. And the just bait for the Catholic Church for the worship of a woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're already worship a woman anyhow. &gt;&gt; She's the best ill woman is the best bait the devil ever had. &gt;&gt; She's worse than all the barrooms that ever was. She can send more souls to hell in all the barrooms in the country. That's right. A good woman is a jewel in a man's crown. Said the wisest man on earth. A man ought to honor a good woman. &gt;&gt; But an evil one is water in his blood, and his blood is his life. &gt;&gt; You man's got good wives. You don't know how you ought to thank God for a good wife. &gt;&gt; For if God could have gi a man anything better for a helpmate, he'd have done it. &gt;&gt; But a woman is the best helpmate that God could give a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when they turned, she was the one in the Garden of Eden that Satan chose for his tool. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't take the man. He took the woman. Why didn't he go to Adam to give him passions? He come to the woman, give her. See, cuz that was the one he chose. God tucked the man and Satan tucked the woman. Look right on down. In the end when Babylon is set up in the beginning hoses to Babylons a woman when come on down into the age now it's ending up the gentile age Babylon started like that and ends up with a woman worship Mary in the church. What a day we're living in. &gt;&gt; Yes. Now uh the lady oa that the ladyan age the word means lukewarm it's increase with goods and thinks she has need of nothing but the Bible says that she's wretched blind miserable and naked What a condition. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The reward to them that overcome in this church age is to sit on the throne with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now the uh star or angel or messenger of this church age is unknown. Now the first church age messenger who was that? Paul, Ephesus, Sernia, Arinus, Pergus, St. Martin, Tatara, Columbbo, Sardis, Luther, Philadelphia, Wesley, and in the this Lady Oian, we don't know yet and probably won't know until it's all over. But I just like to give my quotation of what this angel will be, what we're looking for. Would it be all right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be that we got a little time. I just wrote a little quotation here. What I thought the angel of this Lady Oian church ended up now. He will be at the end of the age like the rest of them. Like the Bible. You'll be at the end of the age. Not the first of it. At the end of it. The angel always comes to rebuke them for what they've done. To the to the angel of the church of Leoa. Write these things. See to the angel of the church of Samia. Write these things. See each one is to the angel at the end of the age. Paul the end of the age and on down. End of the age. The lapover. End of the age. End of the age. That's what makes it laugh. See to the angel speaking what was this lap over here to the angel the end of that age. See picking up right here made the lap like stair steps going up the seven church ages. Now this angel that comes in this day I want to I've got something written here. I just like to read it. But he will be known the last part of the age. And because we are so close to that, so close to the light age that probably he's on earth now. Don't know him. He will be a a mighty prophet that will be rejected by the church world for they will go right on in their sins and finally be spewed out of the mouth of God. Out of the mouth of God's presence. I believe it will be one like Elijah. I'm going to give my reasons why. Now, let's just turn over here in the book of Malachi. Just a moment. I'm going to give you why I think it will be one anointed with the spirit of Elijah. Now, I want you to put on your your grace cap. Now, you &gt;&gt; Malachi the 4th chapter. Now, listen as I read it. You in your Bible. Now, think real close now for the next few minutes now before we go into the church age. For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, ye, all that do wickedly shall be stubbles, and the day that cometh, thou shall uh burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, and it shall leave them neither root nor a branch. &gt;&gt; What's he saying? He's speaking over to a day coming. Will you agree on that? &gt;&gt; Amen. to a day of the coming of the Lord. But unto you, now watch now he's speaking back to Israel. Now what did he say? For behold, the day cometh way over that shall burn. But to you that fear my name, the son of righteousness shall rise with healing in his wings, and you shall go forth and grow up as calavs of the stall. And you shall tread down the wicked, for they shall be ashes under the souls of your feet, and that and the day that I shall do this, sayeth the Lord of hosts, not the day that he shall burn the earth will tread upon the ashes. That's millennium, of course. See, remember the law of Moses my servant which I commanded him and Horeb for all Israel's with the statutes and judgment. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming and great and dreadful day of the Lord. and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. The ending of the Old Testament. Now Jesus said Matthew 17:10, speaking of this, all the Jews are looking for that coming Elijah. Now watch what Jesus said about it. Matthew 17:10. We'll begin at the ninth verse. Matthew 17:9. And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, "Tell no man to tell the vision to no man." See, don't tell this. You know it, but keep it to yourself. Tell no man the vision until the son of man be risen from the dead. Don't tell it. And his disciples asked him, saying, why then said the scribes that Elias must first come? Why is it that Elias must first come before this Christ is to come, the son of righteous? Why did they say this? Here you're already here. And the scribe said that that Elias would come first. Now watch. And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall come shall first come and restore all things. But I say unto you that Elias is come already, and you knew him not. &gt;&gt; See, he didn't say who he was. See, but have done unto him whatsoever ye listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer them. And the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now John the Baptist was the Elias that was to come. Now watch, I get back to Malachi the fourth chapter again. Now remember, he said here that before the great and noble terrible day of the Lord shall come, I will send to you Elijah the prophet. the uh fifth verse. But I will send unto you the prophet. I will send to you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the &gt;&gt; what do we find in the Lord's day at the end of the age. &gt;&gt; That's when the world is going to be burned. You remember how he tuck him with a white uh wig on, you know, and and his breast and girded about the paps. You remember that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we proved by the Bible it wasn't a Sabbath day, neither a Sunday. It was the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's the day that he comes as a judge and will smite the earth for the curse. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And I will send to you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now watch the compound coming of Elijah. Now, if you'll notice, all scripture has a compound meanings, but it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed to babes such as will learn. Don't you believe that? &gt;&gt; Now, hold Malachi 4 right there. And now, let's go back to Matthew 2 just a minute. Just right across the page. Matthew 2. [Applause] I believe I ought to meant Luke 2 instead of Matthew 2. I got it wrote down here, but I was hurrying just a few moments ago and the Holy Spirit was in the room only. I just had me a big time. So, I meant Lord bless uh two. Let's see if this would be a Now, let me study here just a minute. Matthew 2. That ain't where I'm looking for, is it? &gt;&gt; I just submitted. I'll get it. If you just let me have just a little bit of time here cuz I want you to be sure to see it that the scripture has a compound meaning to it. &gt;&gt; The adoration of an return to Nazareth, the Passover, the ministry of John. Now, let me see if I can Luke. I was reading somewhere and I I mean Mark instead of Luke might have been Mark but I want you to get this scripture so that you'll know that it is the work of the Lord that he does do this in this manner. I'll tell you where I'm looking for. Where the out of Egypt I have called my son. Somebody with a mar reading that could get it right quick or find it. Out of Egypt I have called my son. I have called my son. Just a moment. &gt;&gt; Luke 117. &gt;&gt; Luke 11:17. Thank you, brother. That's right. Luke 1. Mark Luke 117 instead of two. I won't forget the 14th. That's where That's it, brother. That's exactly right. Luke 11:17. All right. Now, now you can mark it down. Now, what it is, it's out of the blessings of the Lord that was blessed. And thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth. For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. This man that comes forth will be taught from his birth, not to drink or to have anything to do with sin like that. &gt;&gt; You get it? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. And he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers of the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just and make ready a people prepared for the Lord. Now, now we realize that he was prophesied and John was that person. Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; John was the Elijah of that day that was to come. Now, we also know that scripture sometimes means two things. It'll say one thing like over there in Matthews where it said, "Out of Egypt, I call my son." All right. I'll be That's what I was hunting for. Out of Egypt, I've called my son. And then if you run that son reference there, he was did not it went back into Hosea which did not mean Jesus his son. It was was uh Israel his son out of Egypt he called Israel but it had a compound meanings and a greater understanding to it when meant and talked about for for Jesus coming which is a greater than than Israel when he called uh Israel out. All right. [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Oh yeah. [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Oh, [Music] heat. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hello him.

We know he does everything good for his people.

Sister Dana is visiting this morning. and our friends, the Castillos, Brother Mark and his family, different ones from New Mexico. We sure welcome you. Just want you to be right at home.

Uh we've been bringing the McGraz um before the church in prayer for their health uh situation there in Phoenix. We want to continue to uphold them and we've got some missing still and traveling and different needs. Whether Sean's going to be traveling to North Carolina this week, he he asked that we would remember him and maybe you've got a desire on your heart. Just bring that in faith before our precious Lord. He'll give you everything that you need according to his perfect will. Dear God, we're so thankful to be in church this morning. We appreciate our pastor so much, his family. And so we hold them up in prayer, Lord, that you just help, guide, keep him, Lord, the word this morning as it comes forth. Bless this brother, Lord, that'll be speaking. Brother Mark and Lord, each one here this morning, we put all our faith, our hope, our trust in you, Lord. A concrete foundation knowing it's unmovable, unshakable. Lord, in the wind of political change and upheavalss and things in the world, wars, rumors of wars, we know these things must be, Lord, towards the end. And we know you're coming as soon. We come expecting, Lord. We pray that we could be attentive this morning. Help us to just rem be still and know that you are God because you'll be speaking to us, Lord, this morning. We believe that with all of our hearts. And so we want to sit still and just hear that as we sang early, be humble, oh God, because then you can minister to us because we're going to listen and hear something from heaven that will help us along the road. We'll collect tithes and offerings, Lord. Not that you need it. You own everything, but you want a cheerful giver and to trust in you and to work these things, Lord, through. And so we give it all to you in the name of our Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. And all God's people say, "Amen. Amen. Brother Trevor has a special in the guitar for us this morning. We'll sing a song as he gets ready with with that. Sets up the microphone. Whatever he may need, but this is one that brother Chuck can sing extra loud. Song is a special force. Bombs of victory. Grounds of glory I shall wear. Give me just a minute, sister shar. Here we go. I saw a wayward traveler in Tatagon was glad struggling up the mountain. See that he was sad. His back was heavy laden. His strength was almost gone. But he shouted as he journeyed. Deliver us will come in palms of victory. Crowns of glory, arms of victory I shall wear. I saw him in the evening. The sun was sinking home. He had overcome the mountain. They had reached the veil. Oh, he saw the golden city, his everlasting home, and he shouted loud, "Hosana, deliver us will come." Then palms of victory, crown of glory, palms of victory I shall wear. gaze and all that city just saw a narrow flood. A band of holy angels came from the throne of God. They for him on their minions say for the national and join him in his triumph for deliverance has come. Stand. Palms of victory on crowns. Glory. Palms of victory. Oh, what a day this will be. Oh, it seems I hear the angels around the throne. So grand. They're shouting, "Glad, hosana, we've reached the promised land." When we have reached that city, our race on earth will all shout loud hosana deliverance has come upon the victory. Crowns of glory [Music] of victory I shall wear. [Music] Trevor's already set up. You can be seated. Amen. God bless you. [Music] [Music] [Applause] Amen. and let's stand together this morning. We all know what song that was he was playing. I'm so thankful that he loves me. He promised he'd never leave me, never forsake me. But &gt;&gt; there's times where I look back in my life, there were times where I left him. And but he loves me so much. He was waiting that place that I left him. Maybe for some of you, it was back in Sunday school when we were singing that. Yes, Jesus loves me. He loves you so much. She's still waiting for you there this morning. Come back to you with He's got open arms waiting for you this morning. Let's just sing that as we turn the service over to our pastor this morning.

I have not come alone. I've come with my wife, my sister Ben. &gt;&gt; God bless her. She always has problems flying. She doesn't like airplanes. I heard that's a sufferer. Every time she climbs into a plane, She needs a double faith here with me this morning, which is very important to me &gt;&gt; because she has made a great sacrifice for the love of me. Every time that I travel, I like to travel with my wife. We have five sons, men. Three of them are married. Two are still single and they're all serving the Lord. We're very happy for that. &gt;&gt; I bring greetings from my family &gt;&gt; and also from the Madrid tabernacle, &gt;&gt; the local ministry there &gt;&gt; and also the governing body &gt;&gt; in Spain. There's 20 churches of the message there. 45 million people. So the proportion compared is very small because the light has already passed over Europe. But we're happy has already passed over the designated seed there that are believing the glorious message brought us through William Brennham. There is a seed that has been promised. And whether the devil like it or not, God calls his seed, the seed has to answer if we are here because we have answered to the voice of God. God bless you. I appreciate the pastor, brother Israel Pope. He doesn't know me. But I I thank for his confidence. I want to be a blessing this morning. &gt;&gt; I want to come with rare thoughts. God gave us a message. That's what we're all believing because the faith of the rapture is found in the message. That's going to help the bride &gt;&gt; is the message. I thank brother pastor Mark &gt;&gt; and his family. He invited me that's coming this weekend &gt;&gt; and I'm very happy for that opportunity to be in this. God bless every one of you. Welcome in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I invite you to stand to your feet those that can. &gt;&gt; I would like to speak a very simple theme this morning. And I wish to entitle it like a lamb. &gt;&gt; That's why I invite you to open your Bibles, &gt;&gt; the book of Isaiah 53 &gt;&gt; from 1-7. And there will be a second scripture. Revelations 13:8 in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. You can say amen. Who has be a report? &gt;&gt; And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? For ye shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground. He hath no form nor comeliness. And when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. And we hid as it were our faces from him. He was despised and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath bore our griefs and carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. He was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned everyone to his own way. And the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He opened not his mouth. &gt;&gt; He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter. That is our thought this morning. &gt;&gt; As a lamb. As a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb. So he opened not his mouth. Revelations 13 &gt;&gt; and verse 8. Amen. and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Marvelous heavenly father, &gt;&gt; we thank you this morning. You've given us physical strength, turn the pages of the Bible and be able to read them. But we need &gt;&gt; the supernatural element, &gt;&gt; your Holy Spirit to be able to bring forth the word. &gt;&gt; We don't want this morning that blood and flesh intervene that it be your holy spirit that can bring the word because we know only the word can overcome. But the Holy Spirit is the word quickens it. That's why when you were on earth or the word you went to be anointed the anointed word of the hour. Anoint us Lord and help us this morning in the name of the Lord. Lift the fo, heal the sick, help the sinner to repent. Help us to have a time. There's those that trouble in the mates that we can say our hearts burn within us within us as we when he speak to us. Our heart may it burn also can see. Thank you. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated. I want to speak this morning about a a theme as we have titled it as a lamb. Not that he was a literal lamb, but he came with the characteristics of a lamb. As a lamb, he was taken to the slaughter. And all of us, we were scattered. Not that one yes or one no. All of us were scattered. Because we came to the world under a condition that was not the right place. That's why we were scattered. But there's something good. Didn't say we were scattered like goats, like sheep. And the sheep is the only one that will return back to the fold that all of us we have scattered. But as a sheep, as a sheep listens to the voice of the pastor and follows him. We give thanks to God that this morning we are listening the voice of God, the voice of God, his word as a sheep doesn't matter. How scattered a sheep can be the sheep recognize the voice of the pasture and will return back to the fold. And we're going to put a base here. I understand that it's very normal that when you don't know a person that's new that one doesn't know who one is we could be very attentive and I like this we're going to speak in the first seal here verse 24 of put a base here brother Brandham here he is saying the book was written and planned before the foundation of the world or that is to say the poor was written and was pre-planned in God's thoughts before the foundation of the world. So we want a God that plans. We don't know how to plan. Well today we plan something and then we wake up with another thought. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do the other. And when the moment comes what we had planned before, we don't follow through with say we we fail in our form of planning. Sometimes we overcome sometimes we don't accomplish but God something his plan is perfect. The plan of God is not modified. Brother Brandham said does not learn it. &gt;&gt; The God doesn't learn it &gt;&gt; because he's eternal. &gt;&gt; As he is eternal, he can't learn something. He knows it all. God knows all things. And when he planned this in his thoughts, God's plan is perfect. And he doesn't change his ways of thinking. respect to his word because God is perfect. His word is perfect and what he thought to be expressed &gt;&gt; and manifested. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Look speaking of a plan of God in his thought. God didn't have time to think &gt;&gt; because God is eternal. And God's mind there's no time. &gt;&gt; Brother Random says God could know it. How many how many one can can I count the the the birds the mosquito see how how many times you how many mind do we have do you think we know these things but he every thought that we have he could plan all things there and God's plan &gt;&gt; God's plan &gt;&gt; is perfect &gt;&gt; is perfect &gt;&gt; and God's plan has to be unveiled as he thought it can try to bring it forth differently change &gt;&gt; manipulate God's thought but he cannot be it cannot change can he manipulate it all has to work forth &gt;&gt; according to God's thoughts Bible says was planned the book was planned and written before the foundation of the world. Well, that's to say this book that we have here physically this Bible was planned and was written before we even had God already had it in his mind. that random sins. God wrote three Bibles. He wrote it in Zodiac. It was in the in the heavens. And God began to create in the universe. And when God created the universe, it was the first Bible. But we today understand that Bible. But this Bible is functioning according to this Bible. Because when there's a movemental supernatural first on the earth. The Bible says that God first moves that in the comes to manifest it on the earth. That's to say, but the Bible in the heaven is still villages. There there's still movement there. There's still fulfillment at the same time that it fulfills up there. The same that it fulfills down here. So God wrote a second Bible in the pyramids there. It's a written Bible. Why is that written only symbols? It is written in measurements. It's written in inches. Why? If you're going out to Egypt and you you pay entrance, you'll be able to see the the permit on Egypt, you're going to see the the the kids. You're going to see all the measurements. You won't understand these things. Am I going to understand God's wisdom? He has planned it to write a Bible that would have symbols that I would have measurements. People like us understand God is still now through his word. Look, it says the book before the foundation of the world. The same book, &gt;&gt; the Bible is truth before the foundation of the world. Christ being the lamb was dead before the foundation of the world. The question is, when did Christ die? before the foundation of the world. The Bible says before the foundation of the world, the prophet tells us before the foundation of the world, you and I as believers have to say that Jesus died before the foundation of the world before the foundation of the world. There was no beginning. That's what the prophet says. Well, Christ died. Christ died in his thoughts in God's thoughts. If God's thoughts are eternal and Christ in the thought of God, that's to say that God of the world, he already had a book. had a book, but that book was a a familiar book. Look, in Spain, there's a book they call the family book. But when a child is born, the father has to go to the registry and register with papers in the hospital there where it says the name of the child, the hour he was born, what he's going to be called, they take it to the registry. And there in the registry, They give him a book that they call the family or that is to say the book of a family. Every child that is born has to be written in that book. And that is something that makes you think that God our father had a book. Amen. book, family book, but to be able to write in it to his sons, &gt;&gt; he needed ink. &gt;&gt; It's just a book. Oh, I'm I'm going to go now. If there's something in white to write on, you know, a blank sheet, there's something in white, you know. &gt;&gt; No, there's no white sheets here. &gt;&gt; Well, let's just pretend. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. is English. By the way, &gt;&gt; this is my family book &gt;&gt; and this is God's family book. &gt;&gt; But it was a book &gt;&gt; that had nothing written on it. &gt;&gt; But he had to inscribe them his sons the names. The scripture says our name they were written about the life of the lamb before the foundation of the world. Then God and his thoughts a book there family needs to write the names to write &gt;&gt; the name of his son. doesn't have no ink. They have no ink. They have no way to write &gt;&gt; and he has to write this name with an ink &gt;&gt; so special can be erased. Never. There's no devil. There's no hell that can erase a name has been written in the life of the before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; There's my family book, &gt;&gt; but it's blank. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; and God needs something to write the name. &gt;&gt; So, he in his mind knows he needs ink. &gt;&gt; He needs ink. And as he needs eat, he decides to sacrifice a lamb. We need to sacrifice a lamb in God's mind in God's thoughts. The lamb cannot sacrifice himself. Cannot die by himself according to the lawical law. That must be sacrificed. by a high priest. Now in God's mind, he already has the book of the family. &gt;&gt; He has to write the name there, but he has no ink. He needs in his mind sacrifice a lamb to sacrifice a lamb. He knows that the lamb sacrifice itself. A high priest, a high priest. that has no beginning, that has no ending. Because if he was in God's eternal father, he needed a high priest, eternal priest. And Abraham one day just after the battle with that high priest, that high priest said that he had no father. He had no mother. The days have ended. bread of cup. He tells us the high priest, the all powerful God, the only one like a sacrifice, a lamb, God's thoughts. Now, we have a book. We have the lamb. We have the high priest to sacrifice the lamb. The lamb is sacrificed. Their names are written they are written. &gt;&gt; He seals the book &gt;&gt; of redemption &gt;&gt; with seven seals. &gt;&gt; Oh no. What God thought has to be manifested. &gt;&gt; What God thought has to be manifested in God's mind. But it didn't do no good. It was only beating God's mind, it needed to be to bring that manifestation of that lamb so that he would die in a real form for this. So for God, he he located Adam in the Garden of Eden. And boy, here you have the book. &gt;&gt; Here you have the names. Now you have to bring them. You have to call every name. You have to call every name. You don't have to come through sexual act to be a spoken word of God. So for the word manifest these things. &gt;&gt; So Adam gave him time to manifest not even one name &gt;&gt; and like he didn't give him time. any name because Satan entered. Now the Bible says Adam was not deceived and his woman was deceived. &gt;&gt; So Adam being eternal and seen that his woman had fallen from eternity through sin that God said not to Adam has responsibility responsibility to maintain himself in eternity in order to come out of that eternity to participate in the sin to be able to redeem Eve. Brother said, &gt;&gt; Adam knew that the only way to redeem Eve is that he could participate on that sin. Because Adam made in the image of God, he could not fall. He could not be lost. Adam said, &gt;&gt; Adam knew that he had a lamb. Adam knew that he had a lamb. You and I, we know that we also have a lamb. And that lamb is the lamb of God taking away the sins of the world. And when Adam &gt;&gt; and Eve did what they didn't have to do, &gt;&gt; Adam participates like Jesus was his eternal we had already fallen. We already instituted him. So Jesus could say in his condition or he come from eternity and into time space of every one of us to be able to redeem us. What do you think God did? God had to do the the the sign that he showed in Adam and he did the same thing. And Adam knowing what he had done. Satan didn't deceive Adam because Adam was the word of the representation of God. But when they fell, they made themselves a covering. Brother Ram says &gt;&gt; that they hid. But before they hid, they were afraid. &gt;&gt; Before they walked fine, &gt;&gt; how do you think it fits? &gt;&gt; It's good. It's good. We win him. &gt;&gt; If God comes down, &gt;&gt; you won't know. &gt;&gt; We made us a good cover to the sight measurement. But the prophet says that when he descended in the evening time, when God descended in the evening time and they heard God speak, they found out that the covering was no good. That's why we need to listen to God that he will teach us our covering that they're no good. The presence of God. So, Adam, when he hears the voice, he begins to be afraid. Oh, &gt;&gt; he never knew what fear was. Never. Adam wasn't afraid. They know what fear was. They know what fear. But now they legs are trembling. Oh, Eve, what's happening to us? But God is looking for us. And now this is no good. They they hid the prophet says &gt;&gt; and God &gt;&gt; Adam &gt;&gt; Adam where art thou and when God calls us and he finds us it was God's justice righteousness he came down righteousness to destroy Adam and Eve The prophet says, "God's righteousness, every man's punishment. Adam, come out. Come out." &gt;&gt; And Adam, &gt;&gt; hello. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; No, I'm not going to come out. I'm going to stay in this position because Adam knew that he became in this condition, he was going to die. And Adam was waiting that God to do something for him. He wanted righteousness. &gt;&gt; It was God's love. Then &gt;&gt; the prophet says &gt;&gt; in the message, &gt;&gt; a conference with God. &gt;&gt; 19 paragraph. Abraham says &gt;&gt; something should be done or all will go into chaos his own creation and God selected a certain tree. God selected a certain tree. He called Adam and Eve for them to unite and he calls them there. The prophet said that he were hidden but God called them. to a place of conference. Brother himself says the place where God called them together for there was a tree. &gt;&gt; Well, there was a tree. &gt;&gt; Oh, is that to say that God selected a tree? &gt;&gt; He took a lamb, sacrificed it, &gt;&gt; took that bloody skin. &gt;&gt; Why a tree? Because the scripture was showing the truth love of God to be sacrificed in a tree. And God see that type in the Garden of Eden to select a tree because the prophet says that the cross is made of wood and the wood comes from a tree. You see what God was showing &gt;&gt; a type in the shadow of God a lamb Adam and Eve on a tree showing the lamb of God and he would come. He would be sacrificed upon a tree is perfect. &gt;&gt; God is perfect. God was hidden hiding &gt;&gt; and God come out. &gt;&gt; Adam no cannot come out like this. No. &gt;&gt; No. But when God sacrificed the lamb for Adam sacrificed the lamb for him &gt;&gt; behind the tree and his blood was shed. Adam was listening. Adam knew something was happening that God was sacrificing his lamb. And when God &gt;&gt; throw the skins forward by that behind that place, &gt;&gt; oh Eve, &gt;&gt; glory to God. &gt;&gt; They took those those tunics, those and now they dress. They say, "Are you doing now?" They could relocate themselves before God because they had a covering not a religion but the covering of blood. What we need is a bride that that can be the covering the blood under the covering of the word. The prophet says had his lamb. People had his lamb. Had their lamb. &gt;&gt; Even the disciples, &gt;&gt; they had their lamb. Jesus was there. &gt;&gt; The Bible says as a lamb, not a physical lamb, but Jesus had he had to have all the characteristics of a lamb. And there Peter was there and Pedro said, "Lord, &gt;&gt; we know you are lamb you have to die. I want you to stay with us." But says that Satan took Peter Jesus would not be sacrificed. Why? Because while the lamb was still alive, the sins would remain on them. While the lamb was still alive would remain over the people. Then they didn't need a live lamb. They needed a dead lamb. That's why Jesus Satan take Peter Peter says no let for us we want you sorry Jesus said Satan depart from me because you're a stumbling. Why was he a stumbling? Because your lamp my lamb lies no good. We needed it in lamb that would give his life for us to be able to rescue the shedding of the blood. There is the remission of sins. We needed was to be redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Blood of the lamb. The blood of Jesus Christ. The blood of Jesus Christ that cleanses us from sus Christ sins. Glory. &gt;&gt; A church without blood is a church without emotion. A church without blood, a church that's dead. And God does not have a dead church. A living church has a living church and true as a lamp. God show and every type every shadow the lambs that were dying uh Abel's lamb Adam's lamb every lamb that was going and dying a type a shadow of the true lamb when we go to Exodus chapter 12 God says to Moses Moes, &gt;&gt; Moses, &gt;&gt; Moses, &gt;&gt; this month &gt;&gt; shall be the first month of the month of the year for you Israel or to say it would be the first month for Israel. It is the month of April. And now you're gonna take the the 10th day of April. You're gonna take a lamb. &gt;&gt; A lamb brother said that number 10 is the number of the world. That's why the lamb was selected before the foundation of the world. Hello. &gt;&gt; Are we okay? &gt;&gt; Come in. &gt;&gt; We're good. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; we're good. Okay. &gt;&gt; The lamb was selected before the foundation of the world. Okay. &gt;&gt; The 10th day. &gt;&gt; Take the lambord. Take the lamb. And you're going to sacrifice him on the 14th. I said to the pastor, "If I had a a writing board because it's only preached with a the chuck board, but we're okay. We're okay. We take the the theme of what the the 10th day, God tells Moses, take a lamb, not only for you, but for you, for the family of Israel. And if one family is small, let them together with another small family and that way they'll be will take place and the 14th day you shall sacrifice that lamb the lamb according to the law according go to God's commandments had to be a male the first of the sheep. Listen, I know you know these things already. I'm just reminding you what I already spoken through prophet and what the scriptures tell us. The 14th day, the 14th day had to be sacrificed. That lamb Yes without no defects, a male had to be sacrificed in between the evening time. &gt;&gt; The first evening is from 12 to 3 in the afternoon. in Israel's time time frame that's what it is 12 to 3 and the evening sacrifice it was from 3 in the evening till six so Jesus to die in between the two evenings had to die at 3:00 here's a clock can you write number 12's here 12. Is it noon? Yes. Here we have three. It was the the ninth hour. Here we have the sixth hour. And below we have the end of the day. Okay. Okay. Here it was the lamb of the morning. Here the evening lamb from three. Jesus died in between both times to fulfill the scripture which was at the ninth hour. When Jesus or God is showing these things to us, when we go to Exodus, chapter 12, we find that the lamb is taken on the 10th and then for four days the lamb had to be observed. So it would have no defects. If we see &gt;&gt; Jesus he was selected &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. The 10th day. Now four days had to pass by &gt;&gt; so that he could be sacrificed. So from the fall of Adam until Noah was two days. From Noah &gt;&gt; to Jesus &gt;&gt; was two more days. So now we have four days because because Peter says that for God a thousand years is as one day. So the lamb Jesus had to be observed for four days for thousand years so that you could see that he had not one defect. &gt;&gt; He was seeing Abel. &gt;&gt; Was he perfect? &gt;&gt; Was he perfect? &gt;&gt; Was he perfect? Was he seen in Noah? &gt;&gt; Was Noah perfect. &gt;&gt; Was he perfect? There &gt;&gt; was he seen in Jacob. &gt;&gt; Was he perfect? Abraham. He saw himself in Abraham, the prophet. Was he perfect? &gt;&gt; He was being seen in Joseph. &gt;&gt; He was perfect. Wow. But all the critics say they begin to observe to see if there was some defect &gt;&gt; in that lamb. When the scriptures tell us that Jesus comes as a lamb and he has to have the characteristics of a lamb of a lamb. Not that he was a literal lamb, but he had to fulfill all the characteristics of a lamb of a lamb. When the angel Gabriel presents herself to Mary, oh blessed art thou, Brandham says that Mary was hearing not because she had heard or seen but she because a strange feeling she felt was following her. That's to say she could feel something in that moment. But what did God do? Before Mary or the angel met with Mary, it's that Mary Brenam says went to a service. She went to a service and just rightly the pastor &gt;&gt; preached. He preached &gt;&gt; the pastor preached. The pastor &gt;&gt; preached &gt;&gt; the pastor &gt;&gt; I mean preach &gt;&gt; pastors preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pastors preach perfection 4:11. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:11. &gt;&gt; Perfection. &gt;&gt; Perfections. Perfect. &gt;&gt; Can you believe it? &gt;&gt; Can you believe it? The pastor, brother says he preached the scripture of Isaiah 9. A virgin shall conceive as gave forth birth to a son. Why the Holy Spirit did anoint the night the pastor to preach that message? Because it was the time so that that scripture could be fulfilled. It was a time so that the scripture could be fulfilled. How many virgins were there in the church? How many virgins were there? &gt;&gt; There was a bunch of them. &gt;&gt; But one of them when the pre the the pastor preached, how can it be a virgin? What was it? It was the Holy Spirit preparing her so that she could fulfill the scriptures. Oh, that's to say that God can help her through your pastor to bring you the promises so that you can fulfill scriptures. And when Mary comes out, comes up, you see that she's she's broccabited and observes Mary, he asks, "What's what's wrong?" Oh, nothing's wrong. Nothing's wrong. Mary, what's wrong with you? &gt;&gt; Is that what the pastor preached? &gt;&gt; I don't understand it. And I begin to feel strange now. I believe it. I understand. But I I I I don't understand. I believe it. But I don't understand it. How can it be that a virgin woman? The rest virgins, they went to the barber shop or salon to celebrate a birthday. They went to a fiesta. But Mary was there restless &gt;&gt; for that prophecy. &gt;&gt; The angel &gt;&gt; was in that reunion. &gt;&gt; Gabriel was in that service. The angels of God are in this service. Brother said it. Brother said, "Not the worship of angels because we don't worship angels." But God does have angels &gt;&gt; that administer in your favor. &gt;&gt; You don't you remember that Jesus said, "You're going to turn me in. You're going to crucify me. The son of man that shall be betrayed, but remember of the third day, I will raise again from the dead. in several occasions. Jesus warned him that he was going to resurrect. Jesus dies. They take him to the the the tomb on the third day. He resurrects. Hello. &gt;&gt; Wow. The scriptures say that the angels said to him to the woman, "Who are you looking for? &gt;&gt; We're looking for Jesus of Nazareth. And the angels told them, did you not remember that in such and such a meeting, he told you that he would resurrect?" The question is, were the angels there at the meeting? Were they listening? &gt;&gt; Were they listening to the sermon? Oh, &gt;&gt; don't you think that when you're walking? Oh, Lord, I have this problem. I have this doubt. &gt;&gt; Oh, you know how tremendous problems that I got. And you're you're conversing with the wife with your brother. And you go to church. Oh Lord, how you going to help us? Oh Lord, how do I get out of this problem? And you're sitting down and the pastor comes. Listen, he's in his office and and at the moment there's the thought that comes and he changes his message. Huh? All night steadying this message although it's steady. &gt;&gt; Huh. I'm going to stick to my message and something that pushes him. No, &gt;&gt; change that part of the message, &gt;&gt; but he doesn't know why. &gt;&gt; But God knows. Oh, when the pastor is preaching then he he he hits upon your problem and you call the wife. Did you tell the pastor something? No. Lord, did you tell the pastor something? The wife says, "No, &gt;&gt; no, it wasn't the brother. It wasn't the sister. The only one that has angels says is the bride of Jesus Christ. And those angels, &gt;&gt; they're the protectors of our life. &gt;&gt; Who told you that? &gt;&gt; Who told you that? What? What? No. &gt;&gt; The angels walked. When you go to church, the angels walked with you on your side. Because the Bible says that angels of God, they encamp around those that seek him and those that they fear him. &gt;&gt; So Mary was uneasy and Gabriel there in service dealing with Mary's heart. Don't worry, &gt;&gt; you don't understand. Brother Brandham says that when Moses went to Egypt to deliver his people and he wanted to do it without having his son circumcised. The scripture says it and brother Brandham says it the angel of the Lord was going to kill was going to kill Moses. Does did you read that in the scripture? &gt;&gt; Oh, that's to say the angel was going to kill Moses. Now, God prepares a scene. God prepares a scene. Who told Sephra to take a stone? Who told Sephra to take a stone? How many rocks were there? &gt;&gt; Well, those rocks are different forms. But one rock was so sharp to cart the the foreskin of a child had to be something special didn't take a rock and this is not good. No angel hold on hold on hold a minute there. I got to take a rock here. No &gt;&gt; something told Sephra take the rock and cut off the foreskin of the child. She didn't see the angel, but she did feel the revelation of what she had to walk through to find the precise rock that death would not kill Moses. Did God prepare this scene? God prepares every scene of your life. You think every scene of your life is prepared. It's organized. every circumstances, every inclusive thing in every every trial, in every tribulation, in every circumstances. You think God doesn't know. He knows all that there is. But you cannot see is that the angels of the Lord are encamped about all these people &gt;&gt; to inspire &gt;&gt; that you &gt;&gt; do the right thing. Maria Mary. Okay. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Love. Thank you. Thank you. We'll see you tomorrow. They weren't married yet. Mary and Joseph. Mary went home. Had to take out the and go to the the basket and go to the the well and she feel that someone's watching her. Is it some kind of thieves maybe are watching me? And she begin to move quickly around about to try to get rid of to to lose what was following her. But I'm saying there's nothing that can't separate the angels of the Lord because they have a a job, a boss. Let let that a son of God, a daughter of God be persecuted by the devil. And watch how fast God makes himself present to help his children. How is he going to place us? He knows where we're at. And and Mary, you know, looking walking. Abraham says that she went into to to alley &gt;&gt; without an end, a dead end. Does that sound right from the situations in your life that have no solution like Israel and Egypt from desert? &gt;&gt; Desert the enemy coming &gt;&gt; death. Where is there an escape? There was no escape. But that God opens the door. God opens the door where there is no door. &gt;&gt; You You don't believe it? &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Well, there was a gentile woman. &gt;&gt; And Jesus told the disciples, "Do not the way of the Gentiles. Don't go through the way of the Gentiles because I have come to find or to seek and to save the lost sheep of Israel. And they go into a place. And there was a woman gentile. Oh, a serious woman. Son of David. Son of David. Just saw her. Brother Brandham says she was not calling in the office that responded to him because for her he was not the son of David. But someone told her, "Hey, something supernatural said, hey, the son of David is not for you. &gt;&gt; Call him Lord." And then she said, she said, "Lord, Lord, &gt;&gt; my and Jesus and all the disciples was going to do, you know what he did? That Jesus opened the way there was no way." Why? Because he is the way and the truth. So there was no road. He made a road. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we think God's going to treat us good and we receive a slap. He said, "Woman, he didn't say woman." He said, "Woman, what do you want?" Hey, mama, my daughter's sick. Oh, &gt;&gt; what are you doing here? It's not right to give the bread of the children &gt;&gt; to the dogs says &gt;&gt; he called her a dog. &gt;&gt; If the pastor through the preaching &gt;&gt; calls us pigs We we get all bent out of shape. &gt;&gt; If they call us crows, &gt;&gt; keep on. That woman didn't back off. &gt;&gt; Oh, she didn't say, "Oh, Jesus. Oh, who are you? Oh, why? Why you give me lack of respect?" &gt;&gt; No. Someone told the woman, "It's true. You're a dog. You're a gentile. You cannot eat of the bread because it's for the children. It's for Israel. But I'm going to tell you." And she was all the scene was at a standstill. And Jesus was watching. He was observing how there how there was an angel there influencing that woman and Jesus was waiting for the moment. He has a reason. The Lord has he has a rightful reason. You are a dog. You're a gentile. You have no right to sit at the table and eat the bread because it's for the Jews. &gt;&gt; But I'm going give you a little &gt;&gt; hint. I give you a little uh uh tip of something that happened before a pre there's a pre vision. There was also back then a dog like you named Ruth the Moabitete. Her could not eat of the bread that was in the camp of Boaz, but she could eat from the crumbs that fell from the table. And the woman said, "Lord, that's true, I cannot eat from the bread there, but Ruth, according to the law, that gentile like I'm a gentile could eat from the crumbs, the give it to me at least the crumbs." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Wow. Jesus said, "Great is your faith." God wants to see what kind of level of faith we have if we believe only at the end of the month. Do you know that the the most best service are the ones that are that are charged? When the when the dollar is in your pocket, the most glorious reunions in the church, we all come happy. I'm going to happy to that place by faith in God &gt;&gt; when the money goes disappearing. &gt;&gt; I'm going happy to church to serve the Lord when there's nothing. Our life cannot depend on what we have economy uh economy in in the economy. We have to depend of the God that's so great that's here Jesus. We're going to be closing now the time that we have that I'm preaching &gt;&gt; because I'm now in the future the and on the 21st is when I go back to to Spain and I'll go back because in in back in my land we're eight hours ahead right now. Right now it's already nine o'clock in in my hometown coming into the future. On the 21st I'm going to go back into the past. Jesus according to the scriptures had to come as a lamb. That's why when the angel presents himself to Mary Mary accepts the word and and she's begun of the spirit overshadows when when she gives forth birth. She she gives forth birth and there's a scent or fulfill that she has to come back to the earth from the origin of the birth and it was to fulfill the scriptures because the scripture had to be born in Benary when when Mary and And Joseph, &gt;&gt; Joseph, as a good as a good man, as a good husband, &gt;&gt; he wanted the best for his wife. &gt;&gt; So he called a star of a hotel. Hotel &gt;&gt; a hotel. Oh, he he wanted to find a five-star hotel &gt;&gt; and and and the keeper came out. &gt;&gt; Good evening. &gt;&gt; Good evening. &gt;&gt; Is there logic for us for me and my wife when the keeper there sees Mary that she's pregnant? The scriptures say that the keeper said for you there's no place. When he says for you there's no place that's to say that for others there is but for them. Now why was there no room in a hotel? Because the lambs brother Brandham said are not born in a hotel. Lambs are born in a stable. And Jesus being the lamb of God was not going to be born in a hotel. He had to be born in a stable. When Jesus is born, &gt;&gt; the angels arrive. They're in Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; There they see there all the leaders are there. They see him and they pass over them &gt;&gt; and they go to the mountains and there in the mountains were pastors. &gt;&gt; Why does the devil want to take away the pastors? &gt;&gt; When the pastors, brother Brandham says, why did it have to be shepherds? Why a shepherd? Why a shepherd? Because a shepherd knows how to take care of his sheep. That's what the prophet said. It was a pastor, a sheep, a shepherd. &gt;&gt; And the shepherds, they went &gt;&gt; to see the lamb because a pastor smells like a lamb. Kyifas did not smell like a lamb. &gt;&gt; He smelled like perfume cologne &gt;&gt; with his tremendous vestures. It could go into a a stable &gt;&gt; because it's filth. &gt;&gt; But the pastors, &gt;&gt; thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm at home. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Jesus is taken there being the lamb, &gt;&gt; he begins his ministry. &gt;&gt; He goes to Jordan gets close to Jordan. &gt;&gt; And there was a man named John. &gt;&gt; Repent ye therefore generation of vipers, &gt;&gt; repent. The Bible says that the baptism of John, &gt;&gt; it was of repentance. Repent ye. And when he does, he gets a turn. He sees Jesus there. If my baptism is for repentance, &gt;&gt; then you got then what does he have to repent of? Huh? Okay. Wait, wait, wait a moment. Why? Why? Why have you come here? &gt;&gt; I have to be baptized by you. &gt;&gt; That so it's written. You were baptized with the Holy Spirit and fire. What are you doing here? My My baptism is for repentance. It's for the sinners. &gt;&gt; And you, what do you have to repent of? &gt;&gt; He says, John, &gt;&gt; settle down. &gt;&gt; It's necessary that the scriptures be fulfilled. And brother Brandham says that to be fulfilled is that a lamb before being sacrificed had to be washed by Jesus. He was a lamb. And when John understands this, &gt;&gt; he he washes the lamb. Look, Jesus fulfilled two purposes. Enjoyed it. Brenham says speaking of the scripture Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever that he that was yesterday was a prophet was an eagle. I say it was an eagle who was a prophet that was yesterday. The prophet says he was a lamb and a high priest and that is to come is a king is a lion. the eagle, &gt;&gt; lamb, &gt;&gt; and the lion, the prophet, &gt;&gt; the high priest, and the king when Jesus is the lamb. And as a lamb, he has to be washed. You know why Jesus had to go to to John so that John could wash him? &gt;&gt; The the the lamb had to be washed by a high priest. And John the Baptist came through the the the the lineage of a high priest. So John the Baptist came through the lineage of the high priests, but John the Baptist was was showing the priesthood that was coming now was not one according to that of Aaron. Now the high priestship that came was according to the high ship or the the Melkisedc the priesthood of Melkisedc. And when Jesus is in front of of Caiaphas and Caiaphas tells him are you the son of God? Are you the one that the high the son of God? He said you have said it &gt;&gt; rips his his vesture. Do you know why he ripped his vesture? Because the limit, the the lay of the high priest, a high priest, a super high priest that would rip his garment on that same day, his high priest shipped because he had ripped that covering because he was showing that the his his ship had finished office and he was giving a movement to the new high priest that was coming. according to Melkisedc Jesus in Jordan washed as a lamb. But not only was he a lamb, he was a high priest. And as a high priest, high priest before he administers, has to be washed. Not only washed, had to be anointed. That's why Jesus said being the high priest he is washed in Jordan and he's also anointed when the anointing the fill of fire the locust the the rose of Sharon comes to anoint him. John understands that Jesus is someone special that he washed the lamb. When the lamb comes out, Juan doesn't signal because he understands the scripture now. And he signals and he says, "Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. When the lamb grows, a lamb according to the law before being sacrificed had to be bound." You remember with is with Isaac when and Abraham takes Mount Eram and and he binds Isaac is because the lamb had to be tied up. That's why Jesus in Gethsemane before being sacrificed they also tied him up the lamb had to be without no defects. They interrogated him. They went to go to pilot and the pilot there goes a lamb to pilot now. Wednesday is Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Four days, the lamb was being examined. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet says it. Pilot examines him. He take him to Herod. He goes bound up to Herodas. &gt;&gt; Herod. take him back to to Pilate. There goes a lamb back to Pilot. What was taking place here? They're examining the lamb and pilot. And he placed the lamb in front of the people and said to them, "I don't find no defect in this lamb. He's ready to be &gt;&gt; sacrificed. as a lamb. That's what Isaia says is as a lamb. He was taken to the slaughter house and as a lamb because not only was he a lamb, but he was as a lamb, but also like a sheep. Hey, how come that that Jesus said as as a sheep before his accusers? Because a lamb cannot give forth light because he's the male, &gt;&gt; but a sheep can give forth life. And Jesus as a as as a sheep as a lamb as a sheep had to give light that's why on Calvary what took place there. It was a parting of him. But says for a life to come forth there's to be water, blood and life. Abraham says that Jesus on Calvary he shed water &gt;&gt; blood and his life. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Because to Jesus they made him a uh society. Oh, they gave him a a C-section. &gt;&gt; You and I, we were in Jesus &gt;&gt; and a Roman centurion. &gt;&gt; He He nailed his spear there. &gt;&gt; Spearino. &gt;&gt; Oh, the name of Gino. &gt;&gt; He He name was Gino. He he put forth his advance &gt;&gt; and he passed through the heart. pass the heart and he took it out and water came out, blood and also life came out because from there brother Ben says came out the bride of Jesus Christ you and I come from Calvary. Amen. You and I we come from Calvary. Jesus as a lamb &gt;&gt; had a a party. &gt;&gt; He gave forth birth to a bride. redeemed bride &gt;&gt; through the blood. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter &gt;&gt; how the devil comes at your life. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter in what situation you might find yourself. You have a promise from God that he that has begun the work in you. How many has God began the work in you? Lift your hand. If God has done something in your life, has he done something in your life? Has he has he started something in your life? My Bible tells me, my Bible tells me that he's begun something in me. He will perfect it. It doesn't depend on you. It doesn't depend on me, it depends on him. Because the Bible says that even though you don't want to you don't want he the Bible says will produce in us. He will produce in us the desire how to do by his goodwill. Maybe you don't want to now. But God will begin to produce in you a desire to to make do what you want to do. And you're going to do it. May God bless you. We stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Mark. &gt;&gt; Marvel, marvelous God, &gt;&gt; we thank you, loving God, for your word and for your help. Amen. We are so needy of you. Try to have spoken words of encouragement, something that can help. But we are so insufficient. &gt;&gt; Bless Lord &gt;&gt; this church. &gt;&gt; Bless the offices. &gt;&gt; Bless the pastor and his family &gt;&gt; that your grace. May he continue to take control of this place and be able to express the the the theme this morning that I brought forth. May your Holy Spirit that one that does know can take what has been said and place it in their hearts at in every place where they need to be added in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Help us to understand that you as a lamb you carried every one of our sins that you as a lamb to our sicknesses. &gt;&gt; Don't permit that any person leave from this place sick or leave as a sinner but permit that the Holy Spirit bring healing. upon every person. Lift our faith. &gt;&gt; Thank you for everything. Thank you for brother Mark. Thank you for the opportunity in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. How many send greetings to Madrid, Spain? Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. [Applause] We certainly appreciate the word of the Lord this morning. That was the word for us this morning and we certainly enjoy that. Amen. Is there anyone here that needs special prayer? Uh we like to make that available to you and um I'd have our brother pray for you if there's someone that needs that. And let's sing that song, The Great Emancipator. [Music] Once my heart so fed better by the binding chains of sin. [Music] Oh, but the pretty manipator. Oh, he said be free to worship him. I'm singing glory, glory, hallelujah. [Music] Let it be his holy name. So glad that he the great immaculate [Music] dance the song of the redeemed and like a lost lamb I was praying.

Amen. and and give you the opportunity to consecrate uh these words that you heard, consecrate the words that you heard to your life. How does this apply to your life? Were these just words so we can dismiss the service? Or was there something in there that was eternal speaking to your heart and your life? and everyone here that has a need in your life. Lord Jesus, the great lamb who took away all the sins of the world, he's here to meet those needs. Of course, the altar is open for you to come if you want to come forward publicly and pray. But if you're sitting there in your seat today, this opportunity, we let them come and go so many times. And I I don't want to be responsible for that. I want to give you the opportunity to just settle something in your heart and in your mind of that the angel of the Lord is watching over every scene in your life. All the scenes. He was there all the time. He's there right now. And he will meet the need in your life if you'll only let him. He's a gentleman. He won't force, but he'll give you the opportunity. And today, this morning, a scene is being set for you. And we're just going to um with your head bowed, every eye closed. If there's a need in your life and you want to dedicate that to the Lord, I don't know what it is. I really don't know, but I feel in my heart to do this and there's a need in your life. Why don't you slip up your hand to him today for a special request for the Lord Jesus to reveal the angel of the Lord to let him come out in the forefront and reveal himself to you. Lord Jesus sees all of those hands. I'm going to ask brother Juan and brother Mark to come back up here. And I want my brother to pray for these hands that are raised here. And if you have a need, if you need a touch in your body, you know, he's the healer of your body, they'll lay hands on the sick. They shall recover. Those are divine promises that our Lord Jesus made. He was wounded for our transgressions. With his stripes, we are healed. The healing is in the room today for you. Amen. With those heads bow bowed and brother Juan and brother Mark, why don't you pray the prayer of faith for them? Amen. most powerful almighty God. You that are the God of Abraham, &gt;&gt; the God of Isaac, &gt;&gt; and the God of Jacob, the God that knows our thoughts and our needs.

The God that said all that you ask believing &gt;&gt; you shall receive it. &gt;&gt; Father to know the hands that are lifted, &gt;&gt; those that are raised up and you know their needs in their hearts.

We have spoken of you. We have spoken of your word. We believe you are the same and forever and ever. Your holy spirit is here to bless to help. Father, help us. That is my prayer.

Ask brother John to come and sing a little bit. Let's sing that I bless your name. Sister Heather shared with me a testimony in 1 Chronicles 21 or 22. 1 Chronicles 20 where the Israel begin to pray. They the the great battle was raging and they were being threatened and the Lord told them they would not have to fight. But while they began to praise the Lord and worship the Lord, the Lord set ambushes and he defeated the entire army. And I believe that sometimes we can just praise and worship him and he's already fought the battle for us. But he deserves our praise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we praise him? &gt;&gt; Is he worthy first? &gt;&gt; Who who alone is worthy? It's only the lamb that is worthy to receive praise. So let's just praise him just for a moment in this song just before we go. Brother John, you prepare to come. I bless your name. I bless your name. I [Music] bless your name. I bless your name. Let's sing that first verse on that. In prisoners sh [Music] all pray that night and in their pain they began to sing. Their chains were loose [Music] and they were free. They sang, "I bless your name. I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you honor. [Music] Give you praise. You are the life, the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. And some midnight hour, some midnight hour. If you stood, [Music] you're in a present in your mind. Reach out and praise. [Applause] Unify those chains. [Applause] [Music] and they will fall in Jesus name. [Music] I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you honor. Give you praise. You are the life, the truth, the way. Let's sing that again.

Jesus, lamb of God, you are my strength when I am weak. You are the treasure that I see. You are my all in all. seeking you as a precious jewel. Lord, to give up I feel a fool. You are my all and all. [Music] Jesus, you're the lamb. Oh God, worthy is your name. [Music] Jesus, lamb of God, worthy is your name. The second verse, taking my sin, my cross, my shame. Taking my sins, my cross, my shame. Rising again, I bless your name. You are my all. How many can say this today? Lord, when I fall down, you pick me up. And when I fall down, you pick me up. When I am dry, you fill my cup. You are my all in all Jesus. [Music] You're the lamb of God. Worthy is your name, Jesus. [Music] You're the lamb of God. Worthy is your name. [Music] Precious heavenly father, if the feeling and the anointing at this moment is as it is, yet in our earthly condition, Father, what will it be when we are there gathered around the throne? The prophet says that when we are there, the bride of Jesus Christ gathered around the throne to crown you, that the angels will be there with their heads bowed. They don't know what it is to be lost. They don't know what it is to be redeemed. They don't know the struggles of life, the hardships, losing a loved one, father, depression. They don't know what suicidal thoughts are, Lord. And they'll just bow their heads and they'll wander in amazement. What did these people go through that they can stand here and they can praise your name, Father. What a blessed people we are, Lord, to we have been redeemed by your precious blood, Father. Lord, we're so blessed to be living in this glorious hour, Father. the most darkest, the most gruesome hour, Father, but it is the most glorious hour because one day, Lord, you're coming for a bride. But until then, Father, we need you to guide us to speak to us, Lord. We need your word to keep quickening us, Father, until the last message is preached, till that song is sung. Father, the last sick person has been healed, Lord. Father, bless this sanctuary. Bless the ministry. Bless your people. Bless brother Juan Gawad in his ministry. Lord, his people in Spain. Bless them, Father. They are your bride also, Lord. And we commit them into your hands. Dismiss us not from your presence, but from one another. And may we come back this evening, Lord, with expectation of receiving our double portion, Lord, because your word is the same yesterday, today, and forever. We ask all these things in the precious name of Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're dismissed. If you'd like to go, we'll just sing that chorus. A couple more. Just continue to worship. Enjoy his presence today. Jesus, you're the lamb of God. Worthy is your name. [Music] Jesus, [Music] lamb of God. Worthy is your name. Jesus, worthy is your name. Yes, worthy is your name.
