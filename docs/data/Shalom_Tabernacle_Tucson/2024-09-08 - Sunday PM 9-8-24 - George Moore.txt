Guadalupe Lopez he's having his uh 45th anniversary September the 26th 27 28 that Saturday um I'm going to try and go down down there to respect him and honor such a great ministry he's invited um us to be there and so I put that invitation on the board there I am more sentimental towards these Ministries that have stood the test of time for many many years because it's not easy to do and he's one of our brothers and so I want you to pray for that remember that little Fellowship there amen and so some I told him I would go I told him my wife would be going with me if she can and then maybe a few Saints will go down there and be a part of those meetings in AWA a Prieta brother water amen so welcome you each of you to the house of the Lord as brother George comes let's sing that one more time it's in Jesus name we Press [Music] On Jesus name we press [Music] on Hallelujah dear Lord with the price clear before our eyes we [Music] find amen amen God bless you Saints amen a little quiet tonight can you say praise the Lord amen we're so happy to be back with you in the house of the Lord thank you musicians and uh while we're all standing we'll just turn in our Bibles to numbers the 20th chapter and we'll get to work tonight so was thinking this afternoon what a nice uh weekend I've had Friday night um had the opportunity to go to Phoenix and be with the Saints there at uh Jericho uh Tabernacle and I think while I was in Jericho I believe brother isra Israel was in Jerusalem and uh so we had had a nice time there I woke up that morning I thank you all for your prayers and come through uh what what I guess was Co and then as soon as we got to feeling a little better from Co the back went out and Friday morning I didn't know how I was ever going to make it to Phoenix to preach and I asked brother Israel to pray and by the grace of God we made it and had a wonderful service there with those Saints and so we're thankful to the Lord for that and then very nice uh very very nice wedding yesterday yesterday I enjoyed that and you know I'm I'm always a little bit nervous these these message weddings uh uh you never know it's like uh many times seems like people want to be in the message all the way up to their wedding day and then then we kind of forget about being in the message but I just thought that was uh the presence of the Lord was there yesterday and it was just a very nice atmosphere and I enjoyed that and and enjoyed being there and uh if you're going to if you're going to start a a wedding if you're going to start a marriage out right it'd be the best thing to do be start it uh with the Lord first in your life amen and so I certainly appreciate that and then uh this morning U such a wonderful service this morning I I appreciated uh appreciated that message from Brother Israel look you think you you might think you want to be a pastor uh right up until it comes com staring a message like that down and nobody wants to come preach that message and but my how it was uh it was is what I needed and certainly I think all of us make us check up you know it's uh I'd have probably run Niles my back felt a little bit better but uh I uh I sure enjoyed it and and it's a good reminder to me and so I know it was uh you all as well and so I I certainly enjoyed and appreciated that so numbers the 20th chapter the seventh verse I touched on this a little bit Friday night but I want to go a little direct a little different direction tonight numbers the 20th chapter and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water Thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shal give the congregation and their beasts drink and Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he commanded him and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the Rock and he said unto them here now ye Rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock and Moses lifted up his hand with his Rod he smoke the rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron because ye believe me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them this is the water of merbah because the children of Israel strove with the Lord and he was Sanctified in them can we just bow our heads father we thank you tonight for the reading of your word we thank you for the message that we've heard today Lord we thank you for Lord the songs that have been sung the specials Lord we thank you for all the good things that you've provided for us Lord and and we just want to give you the praise and the honor for that Lord Jesus and father we just count it a privilege to be here Lord and just thinking about our brother Brent sister Patricia Lord I just pray oh God you go with them this week Lord and Lord light their path we pray Lord I just ask that you would watch over the further part of this service I pray you would oh God use me in some way to be a help to your people bind my lips before I'd speak anything unpleasing to you and will committ it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you may be seated and title of the message tonight is there ain't no other way and uh all dou double negatives and bad grammar and all that Saints there ain't no other way tonight and I uh I was thinking about this and how that Moses smoked this rock the second time and and it was a very serious offense when he did this so much so that the Lord said because you've done this you won't be allowed to go into the promised land and brother brandham said that when he did it he broke the the whole plan of God because he said it signified that Christ was smitten twice and he said Christ only had to be smitten once and he said it was speaking of in another place brother Bram said that it was speaking of the weakness of the blood not that not that the blood was weak but that it was insinuating that the blood was not strong enough and in another place he said that it spoke of the weakness of their faith in the atonement their weakness in their faith in the atonement and I touched on that the last time we spoke here a couple weeks ago uh about how brother brandom said that if there's only one that's going to make it you be that one and we've got to have ultimate faith not in our own selves but we got to have faith in the atonement that was made for us and he said Christ had to only be smitten once in another place he said it spoke to the weakness of the word not that the word was weak but that it was insinuating that there could be weakness in the word and says there is no weakness in the word of God tonight there is no weakness in the blood of Jesus Christ tonight there's no weakness in the atonement that was provided for you and me at Calvary there no weakness in it and amen and there's no other way that we can be saved tonight outside of God's provided way and brother brandham said in this day he said I indict this generation for crucifying the Lord Jesus Christ a second time amen and I I touched on it the last time I spoke here but that's I've been running across many people in my travels and different places and and young people old people people that's been in the message for years and years people that's just coming into the message and they still wandering around not even sure if they're saved not even sure if they're good enough not even sure if they're going to make a Rapture or not not even sure that their children are going to be saved and Saints I I don't understand how we can sit here tonight in this message and not know that our family's saved did he not not preach a token message to us did he not did he not apply did he not teach us how to apply the blood to our families and we can't sit around wondering how that blood's going to work we just trust that it will work amen if anything we ought to be trying all we can to obey the word in fullness because full obedience to the word of God entitles us to the token and if we fully obey the word we are entitled to the Token on our family is that right Saints so I don't understand these things and I we can't go any other way than God's provided way there's no way to go in the Rapture than the way he brought it there ain't no other way now remember there was a man that made it into the wedding without the wedding garment y'all remember that in the Bible and the King said friend where is your wedding garment and the man was speechless Saints I don't want to be speechless on that day I want to know where the wedding garment came from I want to know on whom I have believed I want to know that I've met God's qualifications that I've come God's provided way and I got an answer but he was speechless and the King said bind him hand and foot and cast him into outer Darkness showing that it's not the works of our hands or the works of our feet brother Brown said that that there was one door that you had to go through and when you went through that one door you were handed your wedding garment but he said this man came in some other way maybe come in through a window or something but Saints says no other way and there ain't no other way that we can receive that wedding garment but God's provided way is that right tonight Saints amen it can't be some denomination it can't be some mental uh conception it can't be some kind of Doctrine somebody come up with it it can't be some some kind of work that somebody tells you you have to do it it can't be any of those things it can only be according to the provided way amen and if we find oursel trying to do it on our own trying to clean oursel up or trying to get herself good enough it's it's trying to Smite that rock a second time you don't have to get yourself good enough he already paid the price for you to be good enough and there ain't no other way if you work yourself up and live good enough in your own self you're still lost outside of the blood of Jesus Christ can you say Amen tonight is amen now what if your children those of you that's got children if you don't you can just imagine with me but what if your children wanted to take a trip somewhere and they had no idea how to get there and so you went to Great Links to provide them stepbystep instructions on how to get there and not only that but you went and paid the fair that was necessary to deliver them to the place they wanted to go so you told them how to do it and you paid for them to be able to do it and then your children decided that they didn't want to go the way they didn't know how to do it themselves but they just didn't want to listen to the way you said do it I mean somebody else's kids not your kids your kids listen to everything you say and do it exactly the way you said do it but but what if that happened well Saints that's what we're talking about when we're talking about the gospel we don't have to wonder about the Plan of Salvation God has given us the Plan of Salvation we don't have to wonder about how to live a Christian Life the message teaches us how to live a Christian Life we don't have to wonder what it takes to be justified what it takes to be Sanctified what it takes to receive the Holy Ghost because the message teaches us what it takes so we got the plan out in front of us and not only do we have the plan in front of us but then Christ died and paid the price and made an atonement and provided the way for us to be able to attain that it's one thing to know what to do it's another thing to actually do it and he told us what to do and then he provided a way for us to do it tonight is that what he did Saints anything we try to do outside of what he taught us to do what he told us to do and what he paid for us to do shows our weakness in the faith of the atonement so you you see your faith has got to be what Christ did for me is all I need the price that he paid is all I need right the blood that he shed is all I need and nothing else is going to work nothing else can take its place amen now brother Brown said in influence of another I read this for you a couple weeks ago he said I want to say this right now the blood of Jesus Christ is all sufficient allu sufficient meaning whatever the need is the blood is sufficient for that need come on somebody tonight whatever the need is the blood is sufficient whatever the struggle is the blood is sufficient or the trial the blood is sufficient or the or the problems in your family the blood is sufficient what whatever the need whatever the hour you're facing the blood is all sufficient whatever the sickness the blood is sufficient whatever the whatever the the the problem you're facing whatever job situation you got the blood is sufficient whatever mental illness whatever oh God the blood is sufficient whatever demon you're fighting the blood is sufficient he said Christ never died for serpens no no but they they were created beings he never died for angels He died for s siners he never died for holy people he died for Unholy and as long as you think you're holy he never done you no good but when you realize you're nothing then he died for you oh God oh God who did he die for in here tonight Saints he died for you he died for me and that was sufficient can we talk about Papa Cox again I'd be a Christian brother Brandon if I could just get good enough and brother brandham said you tell me you look around and you find where you can get good enough and tell me that place is cuz I want to go too he said he said Christ never come to save good men he come to save bad men and when you think you're good he didn't come to save you he come to save them that he knows are bad he we ain't even got to hide it Saints he knows what we are he knows what you were he knows the life that you lived he knows where you're at today oh my there ain't no other way Saints there ain't no other way we don't got to Smite The Rock again once was enough to take my sins away once was enough to heal my broken body once was enough to give me joy enough to give me peace enough to save my family once was enough oh god there ain't no other way way he is the way and the truth and the life and it's enough amen and I'll tell you we got to be careful how we talk about ourselves we got to be careful how we talk because because you might feel like you're not a good enough Christian and you might feel like you're not a good enough believer but but we can't show a lack of faith in the atonement you're not good enough cuz you feel like you're good enough you're good enough because the price was paid the atonement was made and my faith isn't in my good enough my faith is in what he did and there ain't no other way to live your life I've lived both ways I live for the devil and I've lived for the Lord and I tell you this is the only way there ain't no other way to get your healing outside of the Lord Jesus Christ there ain't no other Joy outside of This Joy right here there ain't no other peace outside of this right here Saints there ain't no other way there's no other way to be delivered when I was in doing prison work I was going to say when I was in prison I wasn't in prison I was I was preaching in the prisons and you know they try to get these brothers to go through the the same like a Christian training and Christian principles and Christian thoughts and and Christian steps with Saints you cannot take an unconverted person and get them to live by Christian law it don't work it's just another set of rules it's another book of laws to them well they couldn't follow the law to begin with that's why they in prison and then you hand them another set of laws and expect them to straighten up what they miss is the conversion Saints because when you're a sinner you're living for yourself and you're doing everything you want to do everything you big enough to do but when you become a Christian you still do everything you want to do this message isn't bondage Saints this message is freedom I don't have to struggle to live this message amen God changed my nature to where the message is natural come on somebody tonight there's no other way there's no other Joy outside of This Joy There Ain't No Other Love outside of this love amen you think you got friends in the world you ain't got no friends in the world when you when I give my heart to the Lord all my buddies they all left one by one I didn't run them off but what we wanted to do changed they didn't want to go to church with me they they didn't want to talk about the things I wanted to talk about I got to where I wasn't no fun no more oh but I'm having a blast now Saints I'm having a ball it's the best time of my life every day that I get to live for the Lord amen there's no happiness in the world there's no happiness in the things of the world there's no happiness in drugs and and fashion and alcohol there's no F there's no happiness and being popular there ain't no other way than this way now everybody is following somebody everybody's following somebody and I that's what social media is built on if we're on the internet today brother Israel let's just get on the internets I know brother Israel is a big supporter of the internet now but social media is built on it it's people people that follow other people they want you to follow them that ought to scare us to death to follow somebody they call them influencers that are to scare us to death because if they're not in this message then what kind of influence is it what kind of influence are they influencing us what kind of influence is it see many times it's a bunch of idiots following another bunch of idiots oh here I go you can get people to believe anything but the truth if you say it convincingly enough somebody will listen to you if you say it like you know what you're talking about somebody will follow you and this is what we find that sheep are L they're made to be led our Natures are to be led we're made that way way and the devil knows we're made that way and and the devil knows we're made to follow yes but it's easy to allow ourselves to follow the wrong example instead of the right one and if you want to get yourself in trouble go ahead and start following what everybody else is doing if you want your life to turn out a mess try to be a people pleaser yes you know I've got a brother in the flesh back in Tennessee and and he is by all purposes a better guy than I am he he's he's more talented than I am he's got a better personality than I do he can even cook better than me Josh he's a great guy if you ever met him you'd love him you'd want to swap me out for him he's a great guy he's funny he's got one downfall and that's said he can't say no and whatever anybody else is doing that's what he's doing so if he was with somebody and they said hey let's pull over and Rob this bank right here he say what sounds like a good idea to me and he can't say no s we got to get comfortable saying no and it's got him in so much trouble because he wasn't able to stand don't ever get yourself in a a situation where you're doing what everybody else is doing where you're following to to to to try to appease somebody else where you go against your own convictions to try to make somebody else happy if you got an amiable personality you'll have to fight that somewhat you have to be very cautious against that and some people you know I we're all made different some people don't care whether you like them or not that's not always good either but we got to be able to tell people know if it's for the wrong thing see if you try to be popular you you're going to allow yourself to get pushed into a corner we got to get comfortable telling people no you say well they might get mad and leave me well you know they wasn't with you to begin with anybody that's trying to make you do something contrary to what they know you believe they wasn't with you no way they were only there to try to facilitate your downfall they're only there to see if you'll compromise on what you say you believe okay now is that right Saints if you got a real friend they won't push you to do contrary to what you believe now the Bible tells us a little bit about that I want to read some of those scriptures to you tonight Exodus the 23rd chapter and a second verse it says this it says thou shall not follow a multitude to do evil let me read it again Thou shalt not not follow a multitude to do evil neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to rest judgments so the Bible said we don't follow a multitude to do evil we don't follow what the crowd's doing I don't care if they got five million followers on Instagram we don't follow them to do evil is that what the Bible say I don't care what kind of influencer they are we don't follow them to do evil nor do we air on the side of the crowd just to fit in nor do we change our judgment the Bible said here is that what it said we don't alter our judgment to try to fit in with what everybody else is doing right is right no matter whether it's popular or not right is right no matter whether people want to hear it or not right is right no matter whether the the popular opinion or the crowd's headed that way we stand for the truth tonight Saints and there ain't no other way than this way right here now you might not have as much followers as somebody else but I'll guarantee you you'll have followers in heaven Proverbs the 16 or Proverbs the first chapter 10th verse I love this one it said my son if sinners in ice thee consent thou not let me read it again my son if Sinners entice thee consent thou not if they say come with us and let us lay weight for blood let us uh lurt privately for the innocent without cause let me skip down to the 15th verse it says my son walk not thou in the way with them refrain thy foot from their bath so so you say well brother George I I'm not doing anything wrong it's it's the it's these other people that I'm following are doing wrong well the Bible said that you don't even consent to doing wrong and Saints if you're going along with it and not doing anything about it you're consenting to it see Paul didn't Stone Stephen but he consented to the stoning and it haunted him the rest of his ministry didn't it amen you say well well I'm not following evil maybe you're not following evil in person but you can follow evil on the internet Romans the 12th chapter I love this second verse y'all know it be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God can I say it like this whatever you're following is transforming you whatever you're following is transforming you whatever you're looking at is Renewing Your Mind so so if you're following evil and looking at evil your mind is being transformed come on somebody tonight and there's many voices trying to tell us all that there's a a better way that there's another way that that that you you don't have to you don't have to believe this message this message was from from from 1965 or this message you know what this message was is from the foundation of the world there's all kinds of voices telling you there's another way but I came tonight to tell you there's only one way Ephesians 5 11th verse says and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them now here's the part we miss is the reproving them and I'm guilty and you're guilty we're all guilty sometime of maybe not saying something we need to say see people will try to slip stuff in on you to see how you'll react to see how you'll take it to see if you really believe what you say you believe it they try to slip it in there and see what your reaction is to it the Bible said reprove them amen God help me not to stand silent amen I'll tell you right now the devil don't mind offending you don't be scared to offend the devil them little amalekites they're cute until they grow up 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter be not deceived evil Communications corrupt good manners evil Communications you can try your best parents you can try your best to raise your kids right try to do right try to act right and live right evil Communications will corrupt them evil Communications will corrupt you as well you know parents you can tell who your kids have been around if they've been around that certain little little boy or girl with that smart mouth when they come back they'll pick up on that and they'll start getting that little smart mouth Spirit on them too well it works in all things it even works on adults you can tell who preachers have been around a lot of times amen evil Communications corrupt good manners the Bible plainly declares though that we can follow the right example we can the Bible said in First Peter the 2 chapter 21th verse it said for even here unto were ye called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps there's the influencer I want to be following right there amen that that's the that's the influence that I if I want to follow somebody and I don't do good following nobody but if I want to follow somebody there's who I need to follow right there we need to follow in the footsteps of Christ Corinthians 11th chapter be ye followers of me Paul said even as I also am of Christ Paul didn't have a problem telling you you need to follow him I don't have a problem saying I need to follow William brandom same Prophet same kind of prophet is that right I'll preach the same message Paul preached we're resting on it amen is that right I don't have a problem saying I'm following William brandom now that's gotten to be offensive in message churches I don't know how how do you believe the message without believing the message I got to pull up brother Wesco brother Israel he said how you going to say what the prophet say without saying what he say how are we in the message if we don't believe the message Hebrew uh first Thessalonians 6 uh 1 Thessalonians 1 chapter 6 verse and ye become followers of us and of the Lord so followers of us and of the Lord having received the word in much Affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost amen Hebrews the 13th chapter 7 s th verse not the eighth seventh verse says remember them which have rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow not just preaching the word but living the word come on somebody tonight considering the end of their conversation well what's the end of their conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever there ain't no other way Saints so if you're going to follow somebody follow somebody that tells you Jesus Christ is a same yesterday today and forever follow somebody that's walking like Jesus that's talking like Jesus there ain't no other way the only influencer I want in my life is the Holy Ghost there's no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved there's not one thing brother Brown said that you can do to be saved if you could Christ died in vain there's not one thing that anybody else can do either there's not one influencer in this world that has the words of eternal life even in our attempts to serve the Lord there ain't no other way than God's provided way there's no new doctrine coming that's going to save us there's no new message coming that's going to save us we have the message and this message will introduce us to Jesus Christ there ain't no new work that can save us there's no new preacher that can save us you could even listen to tapes 24/7 and they can't save you unless you do what the tapes say to do and if you play it like it's noise in the background it ain't doing you no good but you got to listen you got to hear you got receive and you got to act upon it everpresent water from the Rock brother Brown says now here God teaches us a great thing God teaches us here a lesson Christ was smitten once given us a Pentecostal experience oh God one time for all amen so if he was smitten once given a Pentecostal experience then there's still a Pentecostal experience today cuz it's once for all now when that rock was smitten it did not have to be smitten again it was only smitten once Moses made a mistake by smiting it the second time showing the weakness of his faith in the in the atonement but when Christ was smitten once we know he won't have to be smitten again well what was Moses doing Moses was setting up something new trying to make a new thing and that's the way our clergyman has done today they've tried to make something new and Saints we see it all over the place all in the message where the people are the the the clergy feels like they got to come up with something so you got to come to them for it you don't have to come to the clergy for it you already got the word Saints I don't have to invent something new the it's already been given it's already been paid the message is already with us I don't have to come up here and preach something you ain't never heard before to try to make you have to oh you got to hear Brother George oh i' never heard anything like it before if you say that about anybody that's probably a red flag amen if you ain't heard it before after all these years there's something wrong Saints it's probably not in the message I don't care about hearing nothing new God God called me to this word god called me to this message and this message is enough Saints it's good enough it's powerful enough I don't need this message plus something else I don't need Christ plus something else I needed God's provided way and if there was anything else we needed he would have brought it and it still be in the message one more time with private interview I read this for you a couple weeks ago sister Bruce said I have never had an experience that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot on and I see hundreds and hundreds of people battling with whether they got the holy ghost or not because they haven't had the experience that they were looking for not the experience that he said would come but they don't have the experience that they mentally had worked up in their mind that I'm going to go to the Altar and the and the corridors of Heaven is going to open and an angel's going to come and lay a scepter on me and say I give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost or an experience or a sensation and I believe in all of those things but you could have an experience or a sensation and not have the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost can give you an experience or a sensation she said I don't have an experience that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot on he said all right notice this ordinarily a human being is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies is that right Saints is that what you were were you born in sin shaped in iniquity comeing the world speaking lies nobody had to teach you how to tell that first lie amen it just come it come right out of you that's all of us Saints brother Bram said if you got a belly button you was a renegade to begin with amen every one of us was he said that's the nature of a human being Sister Bruce said yes and he said that was your nature and he said it changed once and he said what changed it and she said Christ and he said there you are sister that's it he said you see how simple it is Saints look at what you were look at how you lived look at the things you used to do and look at what you are today now you might not you might still be working we're all working you might still be struggling we're all struggling we're we're still in this old fleshly nature amen you're still battling this every day but look at where you came from what did that he said Christ did that and he said I am persuaded that he which begun a good work in you will keep it until that day but we try to make everything so complicated sa there ain't no other way outside of Jesus Christ he said Jesus said they bind heavy burdens and Grievious to be born and they lay them on men shoulders they they come up with new things they come up with more than that you got to do to be good enough more that you have to do to be a believer and you got to believe this certain Doctrine or go to this certain church or listen to this certain tape you want the easiest job in the world Saints it's picking out a good tape but you got to listen to this one or you got to go to this church or you got to worship this way you're not worshiping loud enough or or over here you're worshiping too loud you got to quiet it down a little bit or you got to do it this way you got to do it that way and they bind these burdens and lay them on the people's shoulders but if it ain't in the message then it's just an opinion the world tries to do it the influencers try to do it the politicians try to do it sa it's so messed up even Trump can't fix it the government tries to do it the the the the schools try to do it everybody's trying to lay a burden on man's shoulders something that they have to do but there ain't no other way we don't have to Smite The Rock again now we're just drinking from The Rock now we're just drinking I I don't have to wonder how I need to live how I need to act what a real Christian is I don't have to wonder about it anymore Saints it's plain I don't have to wonder about how to dress myself I don't have to wonder about how to conduct myself I don't have to wonder about how to do church it's plain Saints it's all there all we're doing is drinking from The Rock tonight there's no guess work in this in five minutes time you can search the message and find almost anything you want to that you're wondering about that's how accessible it is to us but it's the nature of man to try to do something himself it's it's it's in the garden it's it's man running trying to sew fig leaves together and and he told him the whole time it's not the Fig leaves it's the blood amen I like it like this Saints if you got an idea you got something I need to do just show me the quote just show me where the Prophet said it if you show me where the Prophet said it guess what I will believe it because I believe every word is said oh come on somebody tonight show me the quote and and and in this day and time if they don't have the quote for it they'll just tell you well I it's a revelation you just got to get the Revelation brother George Well if if it's a revelation that's not in the word of God I don't want it you can go ahead and keep it oh amen when Moses smoked the rock the second time br said he he s the Bible said he Sanctified himself instead of sanctifying God in his anger and I feel sorry for him because he dealt with a lot Moses dealt with a lot if anybody had a right to be angry it was Moses I mean how much could God do for a people and them complain constantly they saw him open the Red Sea they saw him deliver with their plagues that was in Egypt they saw all of it as soon as they get over there they don't even cross the Red Sea yet they're already complaining then they get out in the wilderness complaining some more whining and crying some more oh you brought us out of here we like them garlic pots back in Egypt now when he got no water to drink and in his frustration he smok that rock the second time and he said here now ye Rebels must we fetch you water out of the rock well it ain't we we ain't got nothing to do with it it's Christ and and it was a mistake and God said because you didn't sanctify me because you didn't lift me up before the people amen Saints none of this is us you you might have a gift the Lord might have blessed you with something but that was the Lord that gave it to you there ain't there ain't nothing in me to sanctify there there's no good in me I I know what I was without the Lord and it's filth Saints amen and if you have a gift or you got a calling or there's something in your life and you're special in some kind of way it's not you it's him we sanctify him amen so many times we're trying to sanctify ourselves we try to clean ourselves up we want to be able to point to something that we did Saints it's not repent and be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost plus anything else it's you do the repent then the baptizing and and then Christ gives the Holy Ghost amen you know for a group of people that should be firmly against organized religion and against denominations we sure seem to start new ones all the time Saints one message is all we need this word is enough we don't have to DEC at it anymore we don't have to make it more flowery so the people will receive it we don't have to worry about it offending somebody Saints it doesn't offend the bride the message does not offend the bride did the message offends you it does not offend the bride we don't have to change it we don't have to decorate it we don't have to polish it up we don't have to smooth it out the message is enough the message why brother Brown said if you here's what it is if you ever seen anything in a pawn shop and then you go and redeem it from that pawn shop you cannot redeem it the second time it's already redeemed and if someone gives you a ticket where the price has been paid and that article is redeemed it's it's redeemed you don't have to pay for it a second time and he said as where Moses made his sin by striking the rock a second time instead of speaking to it see he smote it the first time what did it speak of the weakness of the blood of Jesus that he'd have to be smitten for each individual Christ was smitten for our healing and we just speak speak to the Rock now and it brings forth its healing but you see we've been taught wrong all this laying on of hands and Sensations and never build your he said never build your hopes of Salvation upon a sensation because you can have all kinds of Sensations but build it upon the word of God there's where you can beat Satan any time upon the word it's thus sayeth the Lord so see brothers and sisters no work can save me cuz I'm already saved no work can save you because you're already saved you you can't be bought out of the pawn shop you all already been bought you you you you already you you can't no work can heal you you've already been healed I mean you don't need some man to give you a ticket you already got your ticket the tickets already paid for the destination is already determined tonight Saints and you don't you don't have to have somebody do something else for you it's already done tonight it's already finished and there's no weakness in this Blood no weakness in this message there's no weakness in God's word there's no weakness in the atonement it's already done it's already paid and we're just drinking tonight and speaking tonight and there ain't no other way Saints outside of the way that's been given can the musicians come says we're not saved because we feel good we're saved when we've met the qualifications of the word we're not not healed when we feel like we're healed we're healed because we met the qualifications of the word we're healed because the price has already been paid come on somebody tonight well it's according to the word we're not laying on hands because of sensation we lay on hands because the word tells us to I Don't Preach because because I'm trying to take the prophet's place I preach because the prophet told me to preach yes sir it's the word that we're following tonight Saints and the word is enough come on tonight Saints we met God's qualifications amen I hate the devil I hate all this fear I hate all these lies say before the foundation of the world God had you in his thoughts he knew what you'd be he knew the battles you'd fight he knew the troubles you'd have he even knew where you'd mess up where you'd fall short he knew all of that before the foundation of the world and and and out of of out of Sovereign Grace he said despite all of it I'm paying the price for them tonight I'm paying for them and the accuser will say well look what they did over here look what they did over there he said I I don't know what you're talking about because I already paid for all of that it's already done we got nothing to be scared of today you know sometimes you get up in the morning you got to let the devil know whose side you're on sometimes out loud talking to yourself like a crazy person and saying I know devil that I've met the qualifications I was there when my heart went into his hands I remember the day that my life changed I remember the hour that I gave it over into his hands and I'm convinced that nothing can separate me I know what I was and I know where I'm at today I know that there was a blood Shed from me because his word declares that it was shed for me I know that my debt was paid because the word declares it was paid and I know that it's sufficient and I know that there ain't no other way and I know that I don't have to Smite that rock a second time I know that once was enough and I'm not counting on my own good works I'm counting on the price that was paid for me can we bow our heads and just play something tonight just with our heads bowed you just want the devil to know tonight what side you're on you just like the devil to know devil my price has been paid my heart belongs to Jesus my trust is in the Lord My Hope Is In Jesus Christ and I don't care what kind of Lies you're trying to tell I'm not counting on what I do I'm counting on what he did I'm counting on what the word says and I'm not looking to what I see with my eyes I'm looking to what my soul declares to be the truth I'm looking looking at a promise that was made to me and I am persuaded I am convinced that the one that started this work in me will never fail me the one that started his work will go with me he'll be in me all the way even until the day of the coming of the Lord I'm convinced that he's enough I'm convinced tonight and I I I just want you to know as you see the uplifting of my hand I am on the Lord's Side I belong to Jesus I give myself to him I am his property I am the purchase of his blood I belong to him tonight Lord Jesus you see the hands you know the hearts and Lord God nothing in my arms I bring simply to thy cross I cllean Lord It's my desire to live better than I've ever lived to be closer to you than I've ever been to serve you better than I ever have it's my desire oh God

a city that is to come a city whose Builder and maker is God we're looking Lord for the opportunity to be with you and it's worth every trial it's worth every test it's worth Lord not being accepted
