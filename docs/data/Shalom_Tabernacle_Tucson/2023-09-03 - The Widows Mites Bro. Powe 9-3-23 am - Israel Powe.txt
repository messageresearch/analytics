TRANSCRIPT
========================================
wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seems good in thy sight amen God bless you let's sing only [Music] believe only believe oh be all things are possible only [Music] believe only be live only believe all things are possible let's lift our hand and say Lord I believe make a confession oh Lord I believe Lord I believe that all things are possible Lord I [Music] believe Lord I believe Lord amen all things are possible Lord I be bless you may be seated brother brandham and the people of today who believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit now the church says these people are Fanatics they're nothing but a bunch of worked up emotional panic stricken uh uh people but little do they know that the word of God teaches that it's a promise and to Noah no matter how much they said the old man was off at his mind that he was scientifically wrong and and midly he was wrong but the Noah it was the word of the law and Noah stayed with it and the wise and prudent uh stumbled over the Simplicity of it and lost their being what a a a rebut now it is to that generation many people say if I would have Liv back there no You' have took the same attitude because today in the very same thing being reproduced again today only in another form AR they stumble over today just like they did then no doubt in them days they had plenty of preachers but Noah was inspired of God and Noah could look out and see that what was fixing to happen and know that an adulterous and wicked generation like that that God would not let stand so what can we do today but see the same thing a modern Sodom and gomorah wicked adulterous people so Polished in scholarship that they stumble over the Simplicity of God's manifestation of his being and his word showing his word there's not a person in the world Rosella that and can say that that we don't see with us the very word of God made manifest the very promise of the last days the very evening lights that was to shine we are privileged people to see that and where the high polished world it's hid from them Jesus said to God the father he said it pleased you to hide it from him even so father you have hid it let them with their wisdom you see it was wisdom that started the ball rolling in the muck of sin at the beginning for Eve was seeking wisdom when she met Satan and Satan give it to her see and wisdom is contrary to the word we are not asked to have wisdom we're asked to have faith in what's already been said so see but but today the scholars polish it up in such a way and set it over and put their own interpretation to it always have they do the same thing today it's in the same measure now people uh but uh uh people then missed it just as they miss it and do it today same thing they do the same thing for they for the reason they missed it for they were too smart to believe it amen see now the message while so simple that the smart was too smart to believe the Simplicity of the message oh my God made it so simple and truth that the smart and intellectuals miss seeing it because it was so simple well that's what makes the greatness of God so great because being the greatest can make himself Simple Man today showing that they are not of God they're great and trying to get greater and express themselves greater as big Bishop doctor holy Pope everything making themselves something that they're really not and God being so great brings himself down simp [Music] Simplicity is greatness we can build a jet plane we can fire a rocket to the to put a a a missile in orbit and we can do all these things yet but we cannot build one blade of grass what about that but instead of trying to come back and see what makes that grass and accepting the very God that created the grass we're trying to build a missile that'll get there quicker than somebody else can build one we are so smart and intellectual in our churches so we can build a million doll building or1 million doll building but yet and trying to build one better than the methodists or the Baptist Bill one better than the Presbyterians and the Pentecostal God in the Rat Race but but the thing of it is is this we are yet we are so smart and so set on our ways until we fail to Humble oursel to realize the god that's in the little mission on the corner Hallelujah that's right Hallelujah well that's they stumble in Simplicity they've always done it now they they they were too smart to believe such a simple message it wasn't polished enough for their scientific researches that they had it wasn't it wasn't brilliant the message was enough for their educational program that they had in that day see they' studied to know that there was a God and they studied to know that he was great and they tried to build themselves up great with him when the way up is always down now who knows whether the North Pole is the North or the South Pole is North the North Pole is the South the South Pole of the north which is up and which is down we're hanging in space we say the North Pole is up how do you know South Pole might be North see you don't know so let's remember and this word said then how would you say brother Brandon that Up Is Down on the basis of Jesus Christ's word he said he that humbles himself shall be exalted but he that exalts himself shall be abased be brought down so then uh actually uh Up Is Down Down is up as the old Saint said in Chicago that a man a certain Minister from a certain organization got up for some Pentecostals he had all these intellectual uh things together he got up there and used words that the Pentecostals know nothing about and he got up there and he seen it wasn't going over with the Pentecostal people and he went up with his chest stuck out and he was holy doctor or so and so you know from certain big school there in Chicago and he looked around there Pentecostal looking at one another they didn't even what he was talking about so educated so smart brilliant they didn't know it was something like a certain a senator or a man that just run recently for president and was defeated tuck Coots told me when I was preaching Mama Ford's funeral and was telling about the Resurrection The guarante of the Resurrection just as sure as the sunrises so shall I Rise just as sure the grass dies in the fall and the leaf falls from the tree comes back again when the earth corrects itself around the orbit it's got to rise again tuck said I appreciated that message Billy brother nille and I were sitting together in the car and I said tuck he said I appreciate your messages I said tuck I have no education I said he said that's a good part about it see and I he said he went to see well I guess the man forgive me I don't mean Atley Stevenson you know said he heard him 15 minutes Mr Stevenson is such a brilliant speaker supposed to be you know on tell tuck said I guess he's got a college education he said he sat there and went to sleep and said he went to sleep listening to him in 15 minutes but said with a college education I didn't understand but few very few words he said they were so highly polished he said you never seen me sleep in one of your services did you brother BR see it's the Simplicity of it just simple that's where God laid now they were they were too smart in that day to catch the meaning of God's simple way of doing things it wasn't polished for him it's got to be polished it's got to be highly Chrome or they miss it now but the great Jehovah was hid in his word and he made himself known to the people that believe in his word by saving them and bringing to pass a simple message the simple message of Noah God brought it to pass now notice that now then again in Moses day notice another time of Deliverance when God is just about to do something to deliver his people God sends a message to the people and it's so simple as we'll catch in the breaking into these seals that's my purpose of bringing this first that we find out that the breaking of those seals is so simple the the the smart missed a million miles Hallelujah I hope that God anoints me far see see it just goes over the top that's I thought this message this morning would be appropriate to lay a foundation on the Simplicity of God see how God hides himself in Simplicity just think they can break atoms and do everything else but when it comes to touch and life they can't even tell where it come from a simple blade of grass and God's hid in it they can fire rock it to the moon and and shoot a radar over there or whatever more and yet can't explain the life in a plade of grass that's right see it's because it can't be explained it's so simple they Overlook that now notice Moses in the day that God was going to deliver the children of Israel according to his word he what did he do he chose a simple family we have no record of them see just the son of Levi is all we know and so U we um and his wife just an ordinary uh probably mud Dober as the world would think out there making brick for the enemy he just an AR AR slave in Israel but God chose that family to bring forth the deliverer just an ordinary Jewish Family he never went and got royalty and celebrity or something or even got some priest he took a common ordinary family see Simplicity notice what he done then he brought forth a child a simple human being he never he could have he could have ordained the son if he wanted you to deliver him he could have ordained the wind to deliver him he could ordain an angel to deliver him oh Hallelujah God can do whatever he wants to do but how do you know that brother Brandon God won't leave his program that's the reason we know that this day it's got to be simple see now always works in Simplicity yeah but God in the beginning that could have made the son preach the gospel or the winds preach the gospel or an angel preach the gospel but he ordained man for that purpose and he never changes it he never ordained in he never ordained denominations he never ordained groups of man he ordained man to preach the gospel not Machinery Mechanical Devices or any Angelic being it was man and when he brought Deliverance to the people down there he sent a simple human being born of a simple family and a bunch of slaves oh my what a God he is unfolding himself in Simplicity now notice and he had him trained in worldly wisdom so that he could fail and show that it isn't wisdom that will ever be delivered by it's by fa that we are delivered he let him go in and get such an education until he could teach the Egyptians wisdom he was so smart God was with that simple family who could perhaps maybe not write their name and Moses was tuck into the highest of schooling with such a great education till he could teach the wi of the teachers he could teach the genius yes and God let him get that way so he could display himself in humility to show that wisdom has nothing to do with it and Moses miserably failed in his genius he let him get that way for his purpose so he had failed and he did fail and he fell so to show not by power not by might not by the wisdom of EG ofp not by the wisdom of our schools not by the power of our seminaries but not by the amounts of our organization not by the power of our scholarly teaching but by my spirit say God his wisdom was vanished and at its end when he met God in the burning bush there he took off his shoes and humbled himself to humility and forgot all about his wisdom God bringing Deliverance had to train him in wisdom to let him fall to show that you cannot lean upon the arm of your own understanding or anybody else's understanding let him fall to Show's hand can you see it God's purpose in doing so was to display himself in humility and he let Moses become the highest until he was he' be the next Pharaoh he was a Mighty General amen according to history he conquered Moses himself the countries around and then when he turned to the work of the Lord with all of his talent God let him take a headlong topple so that he could put him out on the desert and beat all that out of him and then appear to him in humility and send him down with a stick in his hand to deliver the people when he couldn't do it by a military training by an education by a scientific education and by a military force he could not do it and he give him an old Crooked Stick off the desert and he did it with it God in humility Simplicity God was in the stick and in Moses as long as Moses had the stick then God had it because God was in Moses sure notice not by power nor by by might but by my spirit but by the simple Faith Moses had an understanding that he was to be the deliverer from the teaching of his mother and he trained himself in military might to do so but it failed see he had the understanding he had the education but that didn't work so he had to forget it all and come to the simple thing of taking God at his word and then he delivered delivered the people that's God delivers by what faith in his word always has been we could take a look if we had time we got about 20 something minutes yet we had we could take a a look at Cain and Abel how that that Kain tried to please God by some beauty another way people think by by great fine dressed congregation by a priest with with uh ministers with robed in robed choirs and all the the put on that pleases God can you see where it come from Cain tried the same thing and he built him an altar no doubt that he made it pretty and the man was sincere he worshiped he thought as long as I'm sincere it doesn't make any difference it does make a difference you can be sincerely wrong notice he he built this Altar and more like put flowers and fixed it up and put beautiful fruits and thought surely a great holy clean beautiful God will accept that sacrifice but see he done it with his own wisdom he done it by his own thoughts and that's what it is today he he they do it by their own wisdom by their schooling by their education and ethics that they have learned but Able by Revelation by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice nothing clean about it as far as it looked humanly speaking the little fell grabbing him by the neck and wrapping a Vine around him like that and pull him along to this altar there's nothing so beautiful about it laying him up on the Altar and hacking his little throat with a a sharp rock until his blood flying all over him blading dying it was a horrible sight see to see it it was simp in Simplicity he know that he was born of his mother and father's blood born in his mother's Blood by his father's blood and it was blood that caused the fall so it was blood that would take it back so he offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice because it revealed to him and some of the Brethren today who think they eat apples and pears and I seen the most radical thing of the day in the paper they said now they prove that it wasn't an apple there eve eat that I I think they claim it was an ocot so oh see where that Spirit comes from [Music] oh [Music] J [Music] in [Music] [Music] h [Music] h [Music] all [Music] I [Music]

bless each of you so happy to be in the house of the Lord with you this morning we' like to ask you to stand we take the Bible I just have one place in or two places in the scripture I'd like to take and St Mark chap 11 so nice to see each of you in the house of the Lord this morning we had a wonderful time in the meetings there were brother Bob I think a few stayed back for the morning but I see a few that pressed their way out to be here so appreciate that good to see each of you mark chap 11 very familiar portion of scripture in verse number 22 and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your faith also which is in heaven your father also which is in heaven May forgive you of your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses brother Banner makes a statement with that scripture he says so faith is based on forgiveness I'd like to take one more scripture found in Mark chapter 12 just the next chapter over in verse number 41 this is where we'll take our text uh this morning we'll title it the Widow's might and Jesus said over verse 41 and Jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were Rich cast in much and there came a certain poor Widow and she threw in two mites which make a farthing and he called unto him his disciples and sath unto them verily I say unto you that this poor Widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all all her living amen let's bow our heads for word of prayer Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on this word this morning bless father as it comes forth that the things that would be said would be helpful to your people it would lift them up it would strengthen them so that when we leave from here from the youngest one to the oldest one they can say it was good to be in the house of the Lord Lord let each one receive that testimony we pray and ask in Jesus name amen a Widow's might God bless you you may be seated amen and these two portions of scripture of course very simple portions in the word of God but they go deeper as we were have been talking and speaking on the third pole and how brother brandham had this great vision expanded a 9-year period that he spoke of the third pool that Vision had three parts to it the first part was he saw with the Mexican children the second part he saw himself fishing and trying to thread the eyelid in the shoe with the wrong end it caused impersonations under the second pole and then the third pole it went deeper into this vision of a tent and a great secret that was there there and then it went further into a great blast that he had as a vision six and seven angels coming to him that was the purpose of him coming to Tucson Arizona and then he was out in the mountains praying the sword appears in his hand this is your third pull this is the King's sword the angel revealed to him that the sword in the hand was the word of God can we all say Amen so we know it's a very nice beautiful subject it's something that we shouldn't be afraid of we should thank the Lord for it actually and there's a lot to it and I understand that people can take it you know it's like you know when Satan wants to hide what God has for you but then God hides things too and he reveals them in his time and so sometimes we want to know things that we shouldn't know and then there's things that we need to know that Satan doesn't want us to know so it can get complicated and the the great Mysteries they have to be revealed and so when somebody's hiding something and they tell you a story you ask them a question and they tell you a part of the story they're hiding they might give you a lot of evidence around you like the mountaintops of what took place but they don't go down into the valley and open up what really took place and so that's the way it is with the word of God many times you'll see Life High mountaintops of EV of what the third pull is but then there's some deeper areas that we simply don't know and we don't want to be discouraged at The Valleys that we don't know let's be encouraged on the mountaintops that we do know amen hope that makes sense in a little way and I trust that these things will bless you one of the as it pertains to us one of the Little Blessings of this great third poll is how does it pertain to us how does it relate to us like I always tease kind of you know a family album or family photos they're not really interesting if you don't see yourself in those family pictures you know everybody's got a picture or something or whatever when you want to see yourself in there and so that's what the Bible and that's what any you know truth how does that relate to me I mean I come and I see all the great magnificent happenings in the Old Testament and the New Testament but there's nothing left for me now I mean what does that how does that pertain to us and so this this part of and I'll be very clear there I mean I'm leaving out a whole bunch a whole lot as it pertains to the third pool but the part that I want to talk about is this little Widow and her name is Sister Hattie rright we all well familiar with her aren't we most of us are what do we know her by we know her because she said that's nothing but the truth very simple statement it was unconscience when she said it I mean she was conscious of what she was saying but she wasn't conscious of the repercussions and the power that was behind it brother Brandon brings her story in after reading this scripture in Mark 11 he also brings in uh brother uh Banks as he said um the right thing he was in the boat he said let's go tell that old sister that we got saved and the Holy Spirit liked those words it was just something that set it off and then brother bam he describes it as a super anointing in one place heus it that powerful anointing that came down upon him into the boat and he spoke to the little fish I give you your your life back so this is all in this message my new ministry then I don't think I brought the all my God help me but then I read it for you last week in my new ministry at the end there brother random says maybe your prayer might be the right prayer to say something to get that anointing to come down again so we know there's an unconscious part to this great anointing and but before I get into that that and I apologize my sister in the back deer I didn't give you these quotes but there's like three quotes I want to read on uh what brother bam talks about the law of contrast how there's a contrast to the good and to to bad to light Into Darkness that God actually designs our life that way and we're taking this message the life story 1953 paragraph number two brother brandom says this here we know you know we don't enjoy the UPS unless we have the Downs is that right did you realize we wouldn't have any mountains if we didn't have any valleys you wouldn't appreciate the sunshine if there wasn't any night is that right and a person sometimes very very good health maybe they don't know how to appreciate unless they had a real sick spell sometime and almost died then they would they can appreciate your good health so you have to it's uh what is called it's the law of contrast I believe brother bam continues on in the message the ark and he says this here paragraph 151 don't be scared God is driving the winds God is ding driving the ark he has all things provided why Noah wouldn't have had any victories there wouldn't have been storms and trials if we're just put through a little safe tunnel to run through there's no joy the storms of life what makes us have the joy we would never know what daylight was unless we had some dark we never know what the hilltop was L we had a mountain we never know what good health was unless you had some sickness youd never know how to enjoy salvation unless you was once a sinner God has made all things the law of contrast he loves you Amen in the message um a blessing Prophet brother banam says this here if you just put in law of contrast this you'll find it pretty quick it's in the blessing Prophet paragraph number seven the law of contrast he says this here paragraph number seven of a blessing Prophet you love the Lord this morning here's what the prophet says and now tonight we find Israel in a backsliding condition Israel had its ups and downs it was a very type of the church today sometimes they were on the housetops the next time they were down in the valley that's what takes to make a APR appreciate the good thing there's what they call the law of contrast the black man of Africa never knowed that he was black his skin until he seen David Livingston and he said then he realized his skin was black because Livingston's was white it's a contrast you would never know how to appreciate a day if you didn't have a night you would never know how to appreciate the sunshine if you didn't have a cloudy day you would never know how to appreciate righteousness unless you had some unrighteousness you would never know how to appreciate good health unless you had some foul Health some bad Health it's only those and that's the reason I think that we'll appreciate heaven so much because we've liveed on earth once and I think the law of contrast the reason that we appreciate the holy spirit so much tonight is because we live so long in a church that told us that there was no such a thing the reason we appreciate it tonight because we've had the other side and that's the way God has intended it to be because his people has had their ups and downs you never know how to appreciate a Mountaintop unless you've been in the valley and so you never know how to appreciate apprciate good water unless you drink some bad sometimes and then all the way through it's a law of contrast how many can say Amen to that what is your contrast today God operates in the ups and the Downs he's still God the God on the Mountaintop is the god in the valley the god when you got money is the same God when you broke the god when you got that smile on your face and friends all around you and you're feeling encouraged and you feel saved is the same God that's with you when you don't feel saved and you're discouraged and all hell look like it's coming against you he's still the same God God intends it this way this is what makes us different than the angels on the other side we will have a song that the Angels can't sing Our Song will be the song of redemption I once was lost but now I'm found I once was sick but now I'm Healed I know what it was to know what stress was and problems and Troublesome times were but now that's all over and that's why we'll enjoy Heaven even more we appreciate the good because there is something bad that we don't appreciate you know was I was at the house there I was uh I noticed this pack rat that got on the side of our house there and um and I you know it was only one and I could see that I would see and when it started to rain I started to look out and I noticed it would pop his head out I think it was a female rat and you know when you see a rat it's like oh kill it I mean you see a cardinal it's like oh a cardinal or you know you see another little animal it's you appreciate it when you see a rat I mean it's like we just detest it why is that I mean we see a squirrel we don't think that way but a rat it's like ooh get him kill him and so I was out to kill this rat and but as I as I the daily I would notice that it was moving more stuff into this hole so it started to Peak my interest so each night I noticed it had more stuff packed up underneath one of my ladders I mean and then when it started to rain this one rat started moving more stuff each night I would go out at night and I flash my light cuz you know snakes are out and I flash my light and I look and it would pop his head out I said oh there you go I see you and then I go back and then the next day a glove be moved over there it even moved the rat trap over there yeah it was a disarmed rat trap I'm no no joke this rat moved the rat trap in front of his little hole there and was building this little Nest so I started to build a little I started to appreciate this rat I mean he had it like character he was working harder than some people in the neighborhood and I won't even go any further than that he was working every night I saw it's work it's handiwork and I thought man and it was kind of a clean looking rat I didn't see any others it wasn't in my house house it really wasn't messing with my stuff so about two weeks I let this thing build itself up and it had this little hole there and then finally we went to go clean it up with some guys one of those guys was here the other Sunday and we prayed for him Marcos and then the rat ran out and we killed it yeah and I actually felt bad for killing this rat I never felt bad about killing a rat before but this this one I kind of felt bad for because it had it was working it was just living it was just being what it was now the rat story is not in my notes today but I just just thinking of that the the character and the you know how you can appreciate something that has some kind of value and who decides that a rat is less valuable than a squirrel you know the history of it is we you know they're they're they're they're terrible they're horrible they're they're disgusting we get that we understand that but I can say not all rats are the same now Let the church say Amen you all excuse me but I am at my home church so um this this this widow's might that we read here in the scripture it's so many lessons in here and as we as we take sister Hatty Wright's testimony we'd have to say if we're believing children we'd have to say that God knew sister had he right before the foundation of the world can we say that when he wrote the Book of Genesis he knew who she was and he knew that this great ministry would culminate in her becoming a famous person amongst th those of us who believe to the unbeliever maybe right in her name own neighborhood maybe some in her distant relatives they might not know how famous she is but any believer that follows this Pillar of Fire here knows who sister hadti right is it's very interesting that not that God chose her but look look who he bypassed and he did it on purpose he he chooses of all people he chooses a widow and this little Widow had her own troubles and her own struggles now if you as I was going through this message and I was searching in the scripture a little bit you'll see how God has always had a sensitive spot for the widdow and Deuteronomy 24:20 and 22 says when thou beatest thine Olive Tree thou shal not go over the bows again it shall be for the stranger for the fatherless and for the Widow when thou gather The Grapes of thy Vineyard thou shallal not glean it afterwards it shall be for the stranger the fatherless and for the Widow and thou shall remember that thou was a bond man in the land of Egypt therefore I command thee to do this so God is instructing Israel in their laws that when I bring you out of Egypt and I start to bless you and I bless your crops in your fields and I start feeding you when you go to gather from this abundance of fruit if some of it falls on the ground leave it there because somebody's coming up behind you that has less than you remember that you were a slave in Egypt remember that you come from a long way I brought you from Al remember that don't take it all leave some for the stranger leave some for the orphan leave some for the Widow it was was on the strength of this law that Ruth was able to come back as a stranger to Israel with Naomi and gather something to eat she lost everything Ruth was a was a widow can I get a witness Exodus 2222 says you shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child Luke 4 2526 says I tell you a truth many widows were in Israel in the day of Elias When Heaven Was Shut Up 3 years and 6 months when a Great Famine was throughout all the land but unto none of them was Elias sent save unto serea a city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow Acts chapter 6 is where we see the deacons being Incorporated and why did the we we feel the need to incorporate the office of a deacon they're not a part of the fire fold Ministry it wasn't something that God had placed into the church as we see as in Ephesians 4 Ministry and the other Ministries in 1 Corinthians 12 and the gifts of the Spirit but the office of the deacon was developed because of a need in in Acts chap 6 verse1 it says in those days when the number of the disciples were multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the Hebrews because they're widows were neglected in the daily ministration so was the need of the widows and the difference between the two who got more who got less dis develop let us choose men to handle this while we stay with preaching the word James 1:27 tells us that pure pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their Affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world widows widowers however you want to classify that God had a special place for them you know I've always wondered in 1 Timothy Chapter 5 that the Paul is telling Timothy that it's concerning widows he said don't take in any Young widows anybody under 60 don't take them in but he admonished them that if they were widows indeed make sure that they truly are widows because if they're not a true Widow they're just single it's it's what's a widow a widow is a woman that was married and her husband is not anymore he's gone and quite frankly all of us that are married here today will probably uh hold that office if the Lord continues unless the Lord takes you and your spouse together it's a reality you will be a widow or a widower you don't think of it it's not a jacket you could just wear let me just be a widow today no you become a widow you become a widower it's a classification and God uses this classification on purpose they're lonely people they have their struggles they had a husband they had a wife and then there's not there no more there's a loneliness there how many know that I'm saying the truth amen all right now now if if you can't feel for a widow or a widower just keep living because the Bible tells us to and I I was sharing this with the church in in in place there at Landmark the day I was talking with this Barber in the barber shop it was an older gentleman in his late 80s I believe he told me he was married three or four times I think he was on his fourth wife he told me but all of his wives had died before him one live for a couple of years died died on I thought wow I asked him what was that like he said he said it's the most uh you know uh helpless feeling you can think he said it's like someone closes the door in your face and you can't go back and say hey I got one last thing I need to tell you or one last conversation it's over death closes the door and you know you're married there's a union there and then when that Union is broken it and one of them is gone it's it's a it's a tight and tough can be a tough position amen but you know the scriptures are very clear on on how to treat a widow but in in 1 Timothy chapter 5 tells that if she's a true Widow then you can take them in and watch them because if she's not a true widow she doesn't have this headship in her life she'll become a Tattler gossiper and get into things that she should not get into and can be uh uh you know negative towards the flock and so Paul is is instructing the church on how to deal with that so that's a little background on the wiow all right now Sister Hatty Wright was this she was a widow Not only was she a widow or a widow she was a mother she had two children that reached in the age of her of teenage so this is kind of the background these are the some of the Shadows that we want to bring to you this morning on her life brother random opens up her life to us in the message my new ministry 1959 paragraph 167 speaking of sister Hattie he says this here sister had moer she just lost her husband I married a couple some years ago they got two fine children and brother watt was killed his own boy found him under his tractor mashed to death and the little boy had a break and some something happened to him brother wood and I went down there one night stayed into the night where his mother and Uncle were staying with him and the Lord let him be well and he's sitting present this morning his mother was interested in him that teenage just be to get out with the world 15 years old or something his little brother coming on 12 13 years old that's an inter that's a beautiful detail wouldn't you saying so this young man a 15-year-old I wouldn't know what this would feel like to go out and see my father smashed under a tractor I'm the one who finds this at 15 years old there's a trauma there there's a break there now this man is taken from the family she becomes an instant widdow not because she asked not because you know she made a wrong decision it was an accident it happened as all accidents happen and now her whole life changes now it's a different classification a wife to a widow it's a different it's a different set of circumstances you got two boys that it takes men to raise men correctly but she has to take this role now you go further and one of the other messages it was this way for 2 years brother mam says it created a break in the boy now this boy breaks is probably going to affect his younger brother too but there it created a break in this boy and here his mother trying to keep them together they're Christians and we all understand let me go a little bit further all right brother random continues and says this here skip down sister to um the next message and speak to this mountain just as I'm on that point then we'll go back speak to this mountain 1959 paragraph 54 this is Brother brand I'm giving the background of who sister hadie is a little quiet this morning but it should be sobering thoughts right amen are you with me or are you all right okay paragraph 54 he says this here but that little Afflicted girl setting there I never could understand it why he couldn't give me a vision for that girl Mr wood and I were eating dinner there and I went down he makes the communion wine for the tables at the church I went down to pick it up and this little girl said to me she said brother brandom would you get me a rabbit before you go back I said sure Edith brother wood and I will go out and get your rabbit so here is Sister Edith is Sister Hattie's sister and sister Edith was born with this infantile paralysis she was in this condition of her entire life in other messages brother bam talks about how she would just be in agony and pain and she was just Disturbed and then finally one day they went down to pray for her and it stopped her nerves from being so bad but God never healed her and all of the great fine miracles in brother B's life God never gave him a vision for Edith he never understood that and this is what he's talking about he says for Edith I mean they love him they they gave a they gave brother brandom a room in in in that he can go to when he went to their home there and why he wouldn't heal her you know he prayed and asked God for a vision so this is what he's talking about so the the the the um um um the right home it was Mother right and brother right they had these two daughters Edith and sister Hattie Hattie was married to this gentleman and had two children and in that home they did their farming and so forth and so brother Ram is talking about how they made the communion wine he was going there to pick up that communion wine there were friends of his and just going to go see them and sister Edith wanted brother brandham to hunt and grab a rabbit for them and so that's that's kind of the background amen Mrs Wright had dinner ready for us her now her daughter is a widow woman they're poor you just don't know how poor they are you people around here in California don't know what poor people is till you get into something like that now he's talking about his friends now she lives in a little two room Shanty way up in the head of the Hill her husband was killed two years ago on his own tractor an alcoholic turned over and broke his neck and the little boy found him and she's got two teenage children that's kind of going astray with no father and that poor little old woman quiet humble little Christian oh I never heard her raise her voice in her life and she was dinging on them old heels up there raising that old crawfish ground trying to raise a little patch of corn to take care of those children oh it was such a p pitiful sight and we were sitting at the table talking and they just love me they got a room up there that I just call my room when I go there used to Pastor the Baptist Church there at miltown and so I just had a room where I would stay with the rights and I said talking about Visions I said now you know I told them about what would have happened I said now like it has to have something the only thing I know it'll have if it ever happens like that it'll be a faith that God will have to give me because when that anointing comes on me just seems like super faith I said Rises it up in me something that there's not a shadow of a doubt and I said oh how I trust I said just like I've been having visions when the Lord would tell me in a vision go down at a certain thing and a certain why am I there would be no question in my mind just go do it never fails so it just got to go got to happen so you got to believe what you're doing you got to have faith and confidence and I have in the Visions when the vision listen this might sound radical but the if the Lord God who's here on this platform now can tell the secret of every heart in here or tell you what will be or what won't be you know that you see it night after night if he tell me that George Washington was going to raise from the grave tomorrow out at the National Cemetery I'd invite the whole world to come see it get done that's exactly right I believe him he's never failed me I've seen Vision since I was 18 months old and not one time has it ever failed and it never will because it's God don't let nobody change your mind on that like none of the vision failed none of the Visions failed none of the Visions failed he's taking off the scene except that one failed don't you let the devil fool you God uh prophets don't make mistakes the Visions don't fail uh what fails is people what fails is your expectation but God's word ain't going to fail and if you quote what God Said in this word it's not your business to make it work God will make it work it's your business to say Amen to what he said if he said you're healed it's not your business how you going to get healed just say what God Said about you you're already healed by his stripes and you can claim any promise Amen Let The Devil fool you we're in a we're in a time where people are switching and changing and prove this and prove that God don't have to prove nothing his existence is evidence enough the sun rises it sets the mountain ranges his creation his handiwork you have to suppress Express the knowledge that there's a Creator out there if you say there is no God we know there is a God in his name what's his name Jesus Christ amen not not another name amen Give the Lord a hand of Praise there's no name like that name the Lord Jesus Christ that's God's name they didn't know it before but we know it today yes sir amen and so God sends these visions and brother bam continues on he says in paragraph 56 and so then I was talking like that and I said now if the Lord would tell me a certain thing would happen like your little crippled sister sitting here little Edith and they were poor people but I was welcome I had a big old bowl of beans Pinto beans baked with cornbread sliced onions and I can eat that so I was raised on it how many knows what he's talking about how many don't eat beans and cornbread well you ain't eaten yet if you don't I know exactly what he talking about and I was just eating away and having a good time and mother R had baked me a big cherry cobbler you know out of the the little tree that I used to help her pick it out of there Mrs Wright in her 80s and she's 70 something with that Afflicted girl I just do anything for those people I could and we were talking about the building the new church up there the Tabernacle and Miss Wright said to me how's the pledges coming on up at the Tabernacle I said brother right I'm not there enough to know so you know what said Haddie wanted to pledge $50 towards that church and brother robertonson the trustee or the church or one of them the chairman wouldn't let her give it said because that' take her about six months to dig $50 out of them Hills over there said but she give 20 and brother banam she wants I thought you know what I got $20 here in my pocket me to give it to me to pick up some eggs and I said I'll just give her that 20 before I leave back she's away from here and and you'll never know it so I bought her ice boxes and things cuz I felt so sorry for her up there that little old mother trying to work way on that hill and so I thought I'll just give her this $20 is what I'll do when I leave I'll just slip it so she'll just get it and that's her $20 she paid in on the Church of there so I thought I'll just give her that so when I said something said to me but your lord stood One Day by the side of a wall and seeing rich men putting thousands of dollars into a treasury and little Widow come by and she only had three pennies all her living and now what would you have done if you had stood there you'd see that little W put them three pennies in you'd run over and say oh no sister don't do that don't do that because we got plenty in here we don't need that but Jesus never told her not to do it he let her go ahead and do it because he know he had something for her down the road see little something better you see so he just let her God loves a cheerful a cheerful Giver can we say Amen to that oh I got to give this I'm mandated to give it God is not concerned about your begrudgingly giving few little dollars that you could give but he loves a cheerful Giver what is this example of this woman with the two mights tell us it's not the amount that you give but it's the amount you're not giving it was she gave her all she gave all that she had and it it caught Jesus's attention and he pulled his disciples together and pointed it out to her of the rich they gave more than her but really she gave more because the percentage of what she had to what she gave outweighed what any rich man gave and Jesus pointed that out and the prophet now takes this scripture in the New Testament our Lord Jesus a parable picks it up and applies it to Sister Haddie just happens to be a widow just coincidence maybe just happens to be the church was building a new building so they can preach the seals she pledged 50 they only took 20 two tens two mites maybe uhuh you know it it doesn't really matter what you give if your heart ain't in it it ain't right anyways if you're giving for somebody to give you credit or Pat you on the bat like you did your duty God's not God owns everything I mean you're not you can't be god-given none of us can be God giving he gave his all amen and when it comes time for us to give to God why we get so tight why we get you know we get so Frugal our budget comes into play when you want to go play you ain't got no budget but when it's time to give to the Lord oh I'm preaching nice this morning yes yes I'm preaching this morning uhhuh all right but this this is what this this uh this testimony gives us here of this widow she gives all that she has Jesus points it out brother brandham is pointing this out like on purpose he's opening up This Woman's life her husband was killed he was an alcoholic he he uh was the father to those children now he's gone and this is the background for sister Hattie now let's go a little bit further all right here what the prophet of God says here in the message I'll pick this back up in my new ministry paragraph number I think it's paragraph number two no paragraph 180 my new ministry paragraph 180 the brother R was giving this testimony we we all know sister hadie she said that's nothing but the truth but I thought it was beautiful to see what her background was to see her situation to see the turmoil in her life she's a widow her children are going astray they probably have a good reason to go astray the one son sees dad killed like that is a big wreck and they need that strong man they need that and this is all G and all of this is working now brother bandam in my new ministry says this here paragraph number 180 say the super anointing swept over me just up a little bit says tell Hattie that she's found Grace in the sight of God who would have thought said tell her to ask whatever she will then you speak it by this gift into existence whatever she ask speak it into existence I looked at sister Haddie the first time it was ever performed on a human being I said sister Hattie ask what you will God is going to give it to you brother bam continues paragraph had he said to me brother banam what do you mean very simple very ignorant didn't have it figured out she says brother B what do you mean I said ask anything your heart desires and it should be produced right here that you'll know that the Lord God Of Heaven answers and his scriptures are true yes amen my first time with the new gift my first anointing I could hardly hear her and she looked around we had been talking about her little crippled sister I said oh no doubt in my heart within a few minutes little Edith will be jumping to the glory of God Haddie looked around all around she said brother Bill my greatest desire is for the Salvation of my two boys voice what why there couldn't have been a greater thing she could have asked for $10,000 she could have got it she would have got it what if it would have been some millionaire he would have asked for another million God know what she was going to ask for amen all right how many thank God for that so what does this do this opens up to us this is God now these are not just Bible stories these are not just little testimonies we hear on the tape or we look in the book you got to see yourself in Sister Hattie amen uhhuh you got to you got to see the Simplicity see some of us can't see see us as poor as she was or less fortunate as she was or like this we see ourselves but we got look what God chose look at the look at the station in life that God used as an example I'm going to for the first time upon a human being who am I going to use as an example for this third pool Ministry upon a human being who am I going to choose over the entire Globe he had thousands and millions of people to choose from and he chooses not an associate member of the Brandon Tabernacle not an associate pastor I'd say not a not one of the other contemporary Ministries and great ministers and great brothers and families that have the well-rounded testimony as a Believer look at what he chooses look at what God chooses does that shake you does that awaken you to something he's going to use a human being aren't you interested in what kind of human being God chose and the circumstance that led up to it had nothing to do with your IQ had nothing to do with how smart you are what you have and what you don't have it had everything to do with saying what was right and when she said the right thing brother bam says she didn't say it from up here she said it from her heart amen amen what is in your heart what is your greatest desire huh that's a deep one that's a deep one right what's your greatest desire well Monday I would like this Tuesday I like this I like this I want this over here I want I I I I what was Sister Hattie greatest desire brother brandom the greatest desire on my heart you asking me I would love to see my sister walk again I love to see my parents I love to see my financial situation change but what's Eternal what will last in the eternities what will go beyond this life over into the other land well I can spend eternity the salvation of my two boys couldn't ask for anything greater there is nothing Greater by the way huh I can come up here and preach her any member can come up here and preach her anybody can preach a great Griff you can see the dead raise you can have an anointed service where people would run the building you can see signs wonders and miracles that we all be great that'll be nice any gift of the spirit on display that'll be great there's nothing greater than seeing a sinner repent and come to the Lord Jesus nothing greater nothing ever will Outlast a sinner finding his way back home glory amen that's what's greater religious people can't see that wealthy people can't see that but Believers like sister Hattie could see it ain't that beautiful oh my let me take this one last quote all right the prophet of God says this in paragraph 183 in the message see if I can find it here quickly oh see don't you love the Lord no we just read that the first time she said that on a human being first time the new gift my first anointing I said oh no doubt in my heart within a few minutes little Edith will be up Jumping All right so now did it stop with sister Edith is the question does God still honor that even today did it go beyond sister Edith yes it did brother brandom says let me get these two quotes for you here and then we'll close all right H somebody said keep preaching who said that so I like that somebody said take your time did somebody say that or I just heard that maybe I just I wanted to hear it anyway thank you thank you thank you that's a good believer right there all right take your time squ in our seat yes sir all right so the prophet of God takes the message um in these two quotes as I was with Moses and paragraph 145 he's talking about sister hadie here again and then he says this here as I was with Moses paragraph 145 little old sister hadie right there sitting in the back of the building with her heart off the things of the world she was believing she said brother brandham that's nothing but the truth she didn't just say it from here God spoke out of her heart I said Hattie ask what you will I'll give it to you she said what must I ask I said you got an old father and mother sitting here you got a crippled sister she's still sitting in that chair you can ask for her you can ask for your mother and father you're poor you don't have any money ask what you want to she says well I don't know what to ask said I just don't know she said my greatest desire is the Salvation of my two boys I said I give you your boys in the name of Jesus Christ and they both converted love the Lord Jesus both been baptized in his name serving God daily with all their heart Ed Dalton sitting here somewhere right down here about his children the same thing so it went extended to brother Ed Dalton how many you know the Dalton brother Jim Dalton is the oldest son of brother Ed but the Jim shared these testimonies uh with us he's a living witness of this brother mam continues in the queen of the South 1960 paragraph number 91 just a step up from that he says yeah I see one man I know this Baptist brother sitting over here brother Dalton I want to say something I'm expecting brother Dalton you see why I'm lining him up there about how many heard the story The squir worlds and things you all did down here I guess and so forth a new ministry taking a hold in my life that's what I got these here for tonight to try it I seen it happen about three or four times the first time it ever happened on a mortal being the second time it happened was to this Baptist brother sitting over here he setting there at the church his children teenage Reckless as they could be and we've been praying for his children all at once the same Jehovah Gyra turned around I said I give you your children in the name of Jesus Christ so we see that gift didn't just stay with sister Haddie it extended to brother Dalton and his family brother Ed Dalton what do we take from this we see that this Faith saying the right things is uncommon conscious we see that many times our faith we're unaware of it as brother bam told us many times it's an unconscious thing it's something that we have and we don't really realize it's not something that we manipulate either we believe it or we don't and when we say something that's from our heart that is true it could set the stage for God to do something great and marvelous for you he can do that for you this morning I believe that you can do that in your prayer time he did this um in a home a little home meeting there listening to a testimony did it for brother Dalton we can see this example through the message we see that God used this background of this Brokenness and the the Family Matters and family troubles that God moved on the scene and we all truly want to see our loved ones saved as well I believe that God is still the same God this morning that he ever was and that we can say it from our heart and brings in this principle brother Dalton Jim Dalton told me I can't remember the amount but he said that uh his dad had gave a preacher $100 they were trinitarian preacher I got the testimony on my phone I'm sorry I didn't think of this right now but brother Jim told me he said his dad they were struggling at the time and he gave this preacher $100 toward this ministry and he said it was right after that that the lord gave them the revelation of water baptism in the name of Jesus it was just like a little gift that he gave to towards the Lord and it opened up so many other things that God had blessed him with and then down the line they come into the message and here we see this great gift on display in the giving it's not the amount you give some people give sparingly but God likes a cheerful Giver cheerful in your praise in your Worship in your time and your ministry to help others if you have a Ministry that helps other people you'll always have a crowd to talk to you'll always have a group of people to minister to because people need help they respond to love they respond to people that can help them and if we try you know the order of the first and second third pools wasn't the doctrine first it was the Loaves and the fishes first it was love is something attractive to people something that encourages people and if that's your motive and your objective when you see another man or another woman doesn't matter their station in life if you're looking at an opportunity to help them then there's a connection there cuz all human beings want to be loved and they need that connection then you can take them to to the next level and then the next one you got to catch the fish before you clean the fish amen and after you cleaning you can give them to me and I'll eat them so that's that's the simple analogy is that you know the first pull was to a great number of people to help them everybody can identify with the bait on the hook and the bait on the hook was healing Divine Healing love something that was a human connection and then it goes further into that and we see that that God uses these traumatic uh situations in the background the the Shadows the you know he uses the you know the light and the Darkness he uses these situations and it's just beautiful how he used a widow woman in our text today just the Widow's might she gave $20 to pledge towards a tabernacle when brother bam said she couldn't even afford 50 cents really she she pledged $50 she couldn't afford 50 cents he said they took $20 he wanted to give it back to her something said don't give it back because God's got something more for her up the road who won in this who won look who gave and look who received amen I can never give back to God what he's given to me even the thought the possibility that he would hear my prayer this morning is enough don't you love him God bless you so much we trust the Lord will bless you we trust that you can see yourself in
