[1:22:00] and God bless you I want to read the
[1:22:02] quote that we had in this pamphlet here
[1:22:04] and then I'll have brother Ferguson come
[1:22:06] it's in the message doors and door
[1:22:09] 1965 paragraph 51 brother brandom says
[1:22:12] they always miss it man is forever
[1:22:16] praising God for what he did do looking
[1:22:19] forward what he will be and ignoring
[1:22:23] what he is doing that's just the nature
[1:22:25] of man and he hasn't changed his nature
[1:22:29] the man of the world so we find that our
[1:22:32] message is today the message that we
[1:22:35] have of come out of Babylon and be free
[1:22:39] and be filled with the spirit and your
[1:22:42] lamps trimmed and clear look up our
[1:22:45] Redemption is Drawing Near these things
[1:22:48] are foreign to many people who breathe
[1:22:52] and call call our lovely lord's name but
[1:22:54] yet in the midst of all of that we don't
[1:22:56] have nothing against those people those
[1:22:59] denominational people they're all right
[1:23:02] they're fine there are Associates in the
[1:23:05] gospel because Jesus said no man can
[1:23:08] come to me except my father draws
[1:23:10] him and all that the father given me
[1:23:13] they will come so we're only responsible
[1:23:16] for sewing seeds some fell by the
[1:23:18] wayside some different kinds of ground
[1:23:21] some fell over and brought H 100 fold so
[1:23:25] we just seed sers God is the one who
[1:23:29] directs it when it's falling and now we
[1:23:32] pray that maybe this morning there will
[1:23:35] be a little seed drop along somewhere
[1:23:38] that might encourage someone and that's
[1:23:42] the purpose of these meetings that a
[1:23:44] seed would drop somewhere and encourage
[1:23:48] someone amen and I'm looking forward to
[1:23:51] being encourag encouraged I I think we
[1:23:54] have some friends from the St Carlos

[1:26:04] souls yes and talk with my wife and
[1:26:08] brother Markham and brother Fay that
[1:26:09] came with me and first time brother Fay
[1:26:12] has come to these
[1:26:14] meetings and first time brother maram
[1:26:17] has come and we were just having a a
[1:26:21] jubilee in all so and certainly thanking
[1:26:24] God for the time and enjoyed so much our
[1:26:27] brother whisper and his ministry and
[1:26:30] he's got just a little different way of
[1:26:31] presenting it and we really enjoyed it
[1:26:34] and last night I excited the Mee and I
[1:26:36] was just amazed to see the direction
[1:26:39] that he took and the things what the
[1:26:41] Lord led him to speak to us it was just
[1:26:43] such an honor and such a privilege for
[1:26:46] us amen and I I kind of feel little to
[1:26:48] stand after hearing men like him and
[1:26:50] brother Paul durkon I think I was
[1:26:53] sitting in the meeting yesterday I say
[1:26:55] My Oh My My I said I you know I I feel
[1:27:00] like brother Brandon you know when that
[1:27:01] old colored preacher was preaching and
[1:27:03] brother Brandon someone asked him how
[1:27:05] you a preacher he say no sir and you
[1:27:08] asked me this morning brother Fus I he a
[1:27:10] preacher I would have to tell you after
[1:27:13] hearing these brothers I have to say no
[1:27:15] [Laughter]
[1:27:17] sir what a blessing and we we certainly
[1:27:20] and I can say with on my heart of the
[1:27:22] blessings that the Lord has given me and
[1:27:24] I really certainly appreciate that God
[1:27:26] has given me the privilege to be
[1:27:28] associated with you all in this life
[1:27:30] amen in Israel I mean brother Israel
[1:27:33] what a a blessing I'm proud to have him
[1:27:35] as a a son-in-law and even when he was
[1:27:37] with us back in Quebec he spent two
[1:27:40] years or so with us we could have see
[1:27:42] that there was something in his life how
[1:27:45] God dealt with him how we stood with
[1:27:47] this message and the things that the
[1:27:49] Lord has done for him you know we have a
[1:27:51] a path that God leads us through you
[1:27:54] know how we go through it's just like
[1:27:56] when brother vam spoke those squirrels
[1:27:57] in existence and one of the brothers was
[1:27:59] talking about it I think it was
[1:28:01] Brother Where The Whisper spoke about it
[1:28:04] and brother randam said the squirrel
[1:28:06] will appear here it will travel here it
[1:28:09] will stop here so this the path of that
[1:28:12] squirrel was already designated you
[1:28:15] couldn't do anything but appear here
[1:28:17] travel here and stop here and we don't
[1:28:21] realize it that's our path in life is
[1:28:24] ordained of God Amen we go here and you
[1:28:27] know this is the way it is and when you
[1:28:29] know we see these things unfolding
[1:28:31] before our eyes and you might have a
[1:28:33] little tug in your heart to do certain
[1:28:36] things and many times you don't even
[1:28:38] recognize it's the Holy Spirit and
[1:28:40] that's where brother Brandon in the
[1:28:42] message thinks that I would be you know
[1:28:43] he's talking about the call of the Holy
[1:28:45] Spirit when God calls you and it's not a
[1:28:48] call like a physical call it's not like
[1:28:51] we standing here and saying
[1:28:52] brother Paul sister Molly could you all
[1:28:55] come it's not like that it's not like we
[1:28:58] standing and saying brother Bill better
[1:29:00] bill could you come sometimes we think
[1:29:03] that God does that through us no but bam
[1:29:06] said he tugs at your heart you see
[1:29:08] there's a pull in your heart and if he
[1:29:11] pulls in your heart there's something
[1:29:12] got to respond and what responds is love
[1:29:16] because you don't realize it but it was
[1:29:17] a seed of love in your heart for God way
[1:29:20] when you were little it was in you the
[1:29:22] time and there was something when he pul
[1:29:23] because if he if I call let's say I call
[1:29:25] here I call this wall I said come come
[1:29:28] come the wall can't come why there's
[1:29:30] nothing to respond but when Jesus says
[1:29:33] come unto me come see if I tell you come
[1:29:38] if I tell Israel Israel come and he
[1:29:41] comes what am I asking him to do come to
[1:29:45] where I am come Jesus saying come oh we
[1:29:48] could talk about that that's not my
[1:29:49] message
[1:29:50] though we just deviate but just to
[1:29:53] mention a little bit was really you know
[1:29:55] it really touched my heart to see the
[1:29:57] Lord took Alberto Billy
[1:29:59] Paul and but a billy and I we have a lot
[1:30:02] of history and things that we share
[1:30:04] together and I never forgot
[1:30:07] that back in I think it was in
[1:30:10] 2000 brother Coleman had a a big
[1:30:13] convention back in Harrisburg
[1:30:16] Pennsylvania and Brother David Sanger
[1:30:18] had a a convention with brother vly Paul
[1:30:20] and I in Lebanon in Pennsylvania Lebanon
[1:30:23] and Harrisburg is probably about 15
[1:30:25] minutes difference and where a Coman
[1:30:27] meeting finished around finished the
[1:30:30] Friday and so um brother Billy Paul went
[1:30:35] to give his testimony on the Thursday
[1:30:39] and so I was in Baltimore at the time I
[1:30:41] came up to Baltimore I was in the
[1:30:42] meetings and kind of HIIT behind it was
[1:30:45] the last time I met but thean in this
[1:30:46] life was able to shake his hands we were
[1:30:49] good friends and shook his hands and
[1:30:51] stuff when he saw me said brother F what
[1:30:53] are you doing here I said I'm so happy
[1:30:55] to see you brother Coleman so we hugged
[1:30:56] each other and brother Billy PA gave his
[1:30:59] testimony and then it was the Saturday

[1:32:20] morning but the believe Paul was going
[1:32:21] to give it his
[1:32:22] testimony and one of us was talking and
[1:32:24] all of a sudden brother the P Paul
[1:32:26] stopped talking and he look at he just
[1:32:29] he was driving and he just glanced at me
[1:32:31] like this and he said brother Ferguson
[1:32:34] he said do you know what is happening
[1:32:36] here with the bo with us I says I know
[1:32:40] brother Billy Paul I recognize something
[1:32:41] is different here he said yes he said
[1:32:44] the same angel that was with brother

[1:32:49] now oh brother
[1:32:53] to be in the presence of that
[1:32:55] angel then brother Billy Paul I don't
[1:32:57] know if was anyone here during those
[1:32:59] meetings in Pennsylvania Lebanon brother
[1:33:01] Ram was there okay brother lar you were
[1:33:04] there during the meetings in
[1:33:05] Pennsylvania back in I think it was
[1:33:07] 2000 it was the first time I met brother
[1:33:09] Wesco in my life and brother B Paul went
[1:33:12] in and he gave his testimony and while
[1:33:14] he was giving his testimony he said the
[1:33:15] angel of the Lord he said the same Angel
[1:33:17] was here and that night the Saturday
[1:33:19] night we prayed the tape and we start
[1:33:21] the pray meeting and in the pray meeting
[1:33:24] that night Paul looked he said but
[1:33:26] Ferguson that angel was with us and we
[1:33:30] heard from that time we started what was
[1:33:33] called the meetings right across in
[1:33:35] different parts of the United States
[1:33:37] especially in mon we went to to to to
[1:33:40] Florida together but Billy and I and we
[1:33:43] prayed for literally hundreds and
[1:33:45] hundreds and hundreds of people
[1:33:47] sometimes in the pray line in mon I
[1:33:49] remember brother Paul being there we had
[1:33:51] up to four sometimes 500 people and the
[1:33:54] strange thing will be and sometimes you
[1:33:56] know sometimes people will think well
[1:33:58] you know I've been accused sometimes of
[1:34:00] things you and you know you've been
[1:34:01] accused and people don't understand and
[1:34:03] they well you know I said I told Brother
[1:34:06] Billy Paul maybe I'd like to get back
[1:34:08] you know and just hide myself he says no
[1:34:10] no no no no he said you stand with me
[1:34:12] and what he will do is
[1:34:14] this he'd always do this in all the par
[1:34:17] lines where he had just come to my left
[1:34:20] is well he have me to stand at his left
[1:34:23] he would stand here those of you who
[1:34:25] came to the meetings you remember and he
[1:34:27] would be here and he'd put one hand in
[1:34:28] me and one hand and the others as we
[1:34:31] pray together and I said brother Billy
[1:34:33] he says no he says I want you when we
[1:34:35] when we were at brother Coleman's
[1:34:37] meeting I was way in the back and he
[1:34:39] didn't know I was there he said if I
[1:34:41] knew you were there he said I would have
[1:34:43] had you come right up right near me he
[1:34:45] says and pray with me because what
[1:34:47] happened is the we were able to blend
[1:34:51] our F together in just perfect harmony
[1:34:54] and then God was able to do wonderful
[1:34:57] things it's like when we went to the
[1:34:59] means
[1:35:00] in in Florida and I don't know how many
[1:35:03] if is anyone here that was at nans at r
[1:35:06] Wesco when we went for the first time in
[1:35:08] Florida back in 2001 brother Ram was
[1:35:11] there is anyone else was there but we
[1:35:13] had people came in from Arizona we had
[1:35:15] from Chicago oh my that church was
[1:35:17] backed there was just no room my was
[1:35:20] just my my my and when we had it when we
[1:35:23] started a pray line our brother Bill
[1:35:25] Leighton which many of you know brother
[1:35:27] Bill he dropped dead and his wife is the
[1:35:29] nurse and they took his body and put it
[1:35:31] in the back room of that church and the
[1:35:34] man was past thought he was dead but but
[1:35:37] Bly
[1:35:38] Paul he had brother bram's Bible and the
[1:35:42] Bible that brother Billy Paul had was
[1:35:44] brother bram's old Bible that you hear
[1:35:47] and said the pages were taken out well I
[1:35:50] had the privilege once of looking into
[1:35:52] that Bible I don't want to take too much
[1:35:53] time on this all of this and in the
[1:35:56] Bible brother brandham wrote in his own
[1:35:58] handwriting and there were Visions
[1:35:59] brother bill that I read and saw in that
[1:36:02] Bible these Visions are spoken off on no
[1:36:06] tape never heard of it and brother Billy
[1:36:08] Paul turned to me I remember one night
[1:36:10] we were in cville together I'm just
[1:36:11] beating around you know I'm talking
[1:36:13] about like this we were in cville
[1:36:16] together and there was brother Matty
[1:36:17] huning in with us there was brother mat
[1:36:20] Brother Joseph Billy Paul and I and I
[1:36:23] think David Randon was there too and we
[1:36:25] were eating at a restaurant at the Texas
[1:36:27] roadh house never forgot but the Joseph
[1:36:29] was teasing me he was cracking those
[1:36:31] peanut shells and throwing it in my hair
[1:36:33] you know now I don't have much here but
[1:36:35] I had a little bit more you know put
[1:36:36] throwing it all in my hair and stuff so
[1:36:38] was and then we were coming back and we
[1:36:40] had a big old van that we had red and
[1:36:42] come back to the to the voice of God
[1:36:45] compound but Billy Paul took the Bible
[1:36:47] and he says you look at me he said
[1:36:49] brother Ferguson I want to share some
[1:36:50] things with you to you he opened that
[1:36:53] Bible and the first time in my life I
[1:36:55] saw brother Bam's Bible and brothers
[1:36:58] sisters you have scriptures that brother
[1:37:01] bam wrote to tying with other
[1:37:03] scriptures I looked at it and of course
[1:37:06] you know I've always prayed and ask Lord
[1:37:07] let me forget anything but I don't want
[1:37:08] to forget your word and as I looked into
[1:37:11] the Bible brother Paul there were
[1:37:14] visions and brother Paul said he said
[1:37:15] brother Fon do you know why I want to
[1:37:17] share this with
[1:37:19] you because at that time I around the
[1:37:21] world telling the people we got to try
[1:37:25] our responsibili to try and see what
[1:37:27] that Prophet say and line up with he
[1:37:30] said brother Ferguson he says you went
[1:37:31] around the world he said bringing these
[1:37:33] things and helping he says and I want to
[1:37:35] share this with you he said to show you
[1:37:38] that is it's a confirmation that the
[1:37:40] stand that you have taken for the
[1:37:41] message is correct because the stand
[1:37:44] that we take for the message it has to
[1:37:46] be a correct stand in the message the
[1:37:49] position we take you all understand
[1:37:51] Church you all understand I'm talking to
[1:37:53] you all kind of from my heart and
[1:37:55] sometimes I come among you and I you
[1:37:56] know we talk as family together you know
[1:37:59] and I read some of those visions and
[1:38:00] brother B Paul look at Brother Joseph he
[1:38:02] said Bud he said I would like the five
[1:38:05] page of the school feed like this he
[1:38:07] said I would like he said to see some of
[1:38:09] these Visions released to the people of
[1:38:11] course there are many visions that we
[1:38:12] aware we are aware of and I have not
[1:38:15] gone around trying to repeat these
[1:38:18] things that brother brandham had that
[1:38:20] was found it's found on notet tape and
[1:38:23] even when he gave brother the the notes
[1:38:25] to brother Vale to write the church is
[1:38:28] book there was a whole bunch of visions
[1:38:30] that brother bam gave to brother Vale
[1:38:32] because a lot of people does not realize
[1:38:35] how much brother Bam's Ministry even his
[1:38:38] preaching Ministry centered around the
[1:38:40] visions that God gave him a lot of
[1:38:43] people does not see that element of it
[1:38:45] all so to brother of Vil there was given
[1:38:48] and then brother of vale before he died
[1:38:50] shared with us some of the visions that
[1:38:53] brother brandham had given to him that
[1:38:55] brother brandham wrote that is found on
[1:38:57] not tape but here's how we fail so
[1:38:59] brother B Paul looked at it he said
[1:39:01] buddy brother he said Bud he said I
[1:39:03] would like if maybe one day he said that
[1:39:05] these Visions here this would be
[1:39:07] released to the public but thus far we
[1:39:09] have never released it it's not been
[1:39:11] released so I have no
[1:39:14] intentions I have never shared any even
[1:39:16] my wife as much as I love her she's try
[1:39:19] to pick and pull from me sometimes you
[1:39:20] know how it is you know but fry I'm your
[1:39:22] wife you know I've kind of locked it in
[1:39:25] my heart you know you know how it is you
[1:39:28] understand how that is so but anyway we
[1:39:30] have a treat and there's some things I
[1:39:32] want to share with you that might seem a
[1:39:34] little bit different a little bit if I
[1:39:35] would call it we're going to hit and a
[1:39:37] little couple of little thoughts this
[1:39:38] morning and yesterday talking to the
[1:39:41] ministers um brother Israel and I think
[1:39:44] brother uh whisper mentioned it a little
[1:39:46] bit last night too it might have been
[1:39:48] nice for the rest of you all to hear a
[1:39:50] little bit of what was said during the
[1:39:52] Ministries meeting so this morning I'm
[1:39:53] going to try to combine a little bit of
[1:39:55] it I mean as we go forward and trust the
[1:39:58] Lord but we're going to see some things
[1:39:59] that seem contradictory and I want you
[1:40:00] all to stop and think very closely uh
[1:40:03] don't jump to conclusions just hold back
[1:40:05] wait to see how it will reconcile see it
[1:40:08] will
[1:40:09] go because sometimes I ask you all
[1:40:11] questions and it's not to put traps for
[1:40:13] you not a bit of it but it's just to see
[1:40:16] how you will react to some of it you
[1:40:18] understand how it is see so this morning
[1:40:20] we could do that now I'll try my best
[1:40:24] and hurry okay and sometimes in the
[1:40:26] meeting some folks tell me that there Ro
[1:40:28] of ferus you know you share little
[1:40:30] testimonies with us of course you know
[1:40:32] as is well mentioned I know I'm I'm
[1:40:33] aware of the fact that you know I've
[1:40:35] been a missionary and the work that God
[1:40:37] has used in you know that God has helped
[1:40:41] me in a little in a little way to be
[1:40:42] able to Speare ahead the Revival and
[1:40:45] central Africa which is the biggest
[1:40:47] Revival move of God of in this message
[1:40:49] anywhere in the world
[1:40:52] and so huge that the fires has been
[1:40:54] building in different countries and I
[1:40:56] had to go in into those countries during
[1:40:57] the time of the war you know I was there
[1:41:00] just after the tootsies and The Hoots
[1:41:02] war in
[1:41:03] Rwanda uh we helped to smuggle some of
[1:41:05] to help some of the brothers to get out
[1:41:07] of that uh so we were instrumental in
[1:41:10] that and you know different things that
[1:41:13] so I was there in Angola brutal War I
[1:41:15] was in the Congo during the times of the
[1:41:18] war and had to go in during that time
[1:41:21] and the real truth of it is I told you
[1:41:23] all God prepares this man for his job
[1:41:24] like for instance you know I grew up in
[1:41:26] one of the the worst ghettos in the
[1:41:29] islands and danger and killing and
[1:41:31] murder and stabbings and stuff you know
[1:41:34] I I was there I grew up I was there was
[1:41:37] a little boy I you know we were in gang
[1:41:40] Warfare we didn't we didn't have guns
[1:41:42] but we had knives and you know I even
[1:41:45] was in a telling one of the brothers in
[1:41:47] Phoenix he was amazed to hear this I was
[1:41:49] in a machete fight one day
[1:41:51] and on my hand here is a mark of the
[1:41:54] machete I got cut right across my hand
[1:41:57] the machete in my hand saved my life
[1:42:00] because when that guy came with the
[1:42:02] machete I had to block it like this and
[1:42:04] I slid it down and I cut him right
[1:42:06] across his hands here I nearly took his
[1:42:08] whole wrist off so I knew what was all
[1:42:10] of that and then I stood back when the
[1:42:12] blood was on his hand and the blood was
[1:42:14] on my hand I said if we don't stop I
[1:42:16] said I will kill you or you will kill me
[1:42:18] I said and I said if you chop me I said
[1:42:20] a little bit more I said I'm going to go
[1:42:21] into you I said regardless to what I
[1:42:23] said so we so we decided to stop but we
[1:42:25] went into all of this so the how you
[1:42:28] grew up your Youth and everything God
[1:42:31] has that we can't say you know one is
[1:42:32] better than the other you know God has
[1:42:34] this for specific purpose or Reason
[1:42:37] different things and I was grow up in
[1:42:40] that so I become Fearless in my heart in
[1:42:42] myself I remember going into the New
[1:42:45] York City several years ago and it was
[1:42:46] very bad and went to Harlem and one
[1:42:48] night 2:00 in the morning and my brother
[1:42:50] was amazing you know I put on a little
[1:42:52] funny hat on my head you know I had on
[1:42:54] an old black dark shirt spotted tie I
[1:42:58] think I look like a gangster myself and
[1:43:00] I walked in to get some food and the
[1:43:01] people who were in the store were
[1:43:02] trembling they thought I was one of the
[1:43:04] bandits you know they were worried about
[1:43:06] me see and it's like that you know you
[1:43:08] grow up and you're Fearless you know you
[1:43:10] you don't have that fear and therefore
[1:43:12] if I have to go in then I go in see and
[1:43:16] of course we can go back and share many
[1:43:18] testimonies you probably heard my
[1:43:19] testimony how God say me from a shark
[1:43:22] yeah remember that testimony I've shared
[1:43:24] it with you sometimes how many of you
[1:43:26] never heard that testimony how God saved
[1:43:28] my life from a
[1:43:30] shark huh you remember s you've been
[1:43:34] there you you you you Paul you remember
[1:43:37] that story yeah you know CU God is I
[1:43:40] mean the Lord we serve he's a god of
[1:43:42] Miracles you see and so many things that
[1:43:45] he has done I mean my hand here I I had
[1:43:48] the marks here and my wife was there and
[1:43:50] my cut right here from it and where I
[1:43:53] was I was hit with
[1:43:55] 25,000 volts of electricity wow now you
[1:43:58] talk about a cat having Nine
[1:44:04] Lives what God has done for us see and
[1:44:08] uh even the doctors even the specialist
[1:44:10] the specialist in hydroc up the you know
[1:44:12] they made a study because the three
[1:44:14] specialist they were talking about this
[1:44:17] and one specialist say well because I
[1:44:19] was up on the tree and they can't Hydra
[1:44:21] couldn't deny it because they knew it
[1:44:22] was 25,000 volts of electricity so
[1:44:25] nobody could deny it so I was up there
[1:44:27] on on the on an aluminum ladder cutting
[1:44:29] the tree and that electricity the
[1:44:33] aluminum the uh the aluminum the the
[1:44:36] tree I was that I was cutting up there
[1:44:39] it hit the high tension wires the
[1:44:41] aluminum wire the aluminum um ladder
[1:44:44] went this way electricity came down I
[1:44:47] raised my hand up like this it hit me
[1:44:49] right through here I saw like a a a
[1:44:51] Darkness went around me like a million
[1:44:53] miles an hour and then the light
[1:44:55] followed after the darkness which I went
[1:44:57] into the message and wouldn't have time
[1:44:58] to talk about that but then I fell off
[1:45:00] the tree and I didn't remember what
[1:45:02] happened and then the the the specialist
[1:45:05] in Hydro corbec of course when I fell
[1:45:07] off the street this hand right here with
[1:45:10] the with the shock of the electricity
[1:45:11] and all what happened the bone here came
[1:45:14] out so all that was holding my hand here
[1:45:17] was just the skin the bone here this
[1:45:20] bone here was broken and my finger came
[1:45:22] out of its socket this finger here was
[1:45:25] broken this stem here was broken so this
[1:45:29] came out of the socket CU after this I
[1:45:31] can't I never got back my hands here so
[1:45:33] tree specialist from Hydro Quebec talked
[1:45:35] about it and the Tre specialist said one
[1:45:39] specialist said what saved my life is
[1:45:42] the electricity went right through my
[1:45:44] body and grounded another specialist
[1:45:47] said what Sav your life is when
[1:45:49] electricity hit him it shrim off the
[1:45:51] tree because the government wanted to
[1:45:53] make a research to find out how my body
[1:45:56] was able to to to with stand 25,000
[1:46:00] volts of electricity so they want to pay
[1:46:02] me to make a study on my brain and on
[1:46:04] every organ of my body because there's
[1:46:07] no scientific research there's no R it
[1:46:11] happened to ran two weeks before me and
[1:46:14] it just he he just fed on the tree so
[1:46:17] then the other specialist told it to
[1:46:19] others he said look man he said what you
[1:46:21] saying doesn't even make sense he said
[1:46:23] it takes a fraction he said 25,000 volts
[1:46:26] of electricity he said it takes a
[1:46:28] fraction of a second he said to bring
[1:46:30] your blood to boil and point he says no
[1:46:33] human being could could could withstand
[1:46:36] 25,000 volts of electricity but here is
[1:46:39] one standing before
[1:46:41] you and it's not because of me it's
[1:46:44] because of him amen so we are grateful
[1:46:47] to God now we got to get to the word now
[1:46:51] and um I told you I'm going to have to
[1:46:55] to try to hurry all
[1:46:57] right so is well if you if you see me
[1:47:00] going too long you should sit somewhere
[1:47:01] up here and you just you just pull on my
[1:47:04] um on my
[1:47:07] coat okay all right so God bless all of
[1:47:12] you are you ready now for the word of
[1:47:14] the Lord so we yes there's one thing I
[1:47:17] wanted to share with you all concerning
[1:47:18] brother Bly Paul I knew there was
[1:47:20] something
[1:47:21] there it was concerning that famous
[1:47:24] prophecy that people think around the
[1:47:27] world that it didn't happen and I shared
[1:47:29] a little bit with the ministers
[1:47:30] yesterday it's when brother banam called
[1:47:33] brother Billy and told Brother Billy he
[1:47:34] said Billy said where you standing he
[1:47:36] said I'm in Los Angeles he said ex but
[1:47:38] Billy Paul shared that testimony he said
[1:47:40] exactly there he said I'm standing in
[1:47:42] front of M he said you will not be an
[1:47:44] old man he says in sharks will be
[1:47:46] swimming around there so of course all
[1:47:49] of us Associated back that with the fact
[1:47:51] that when Los Angeles will California
[1:47:53] will sink you know we all felt that way
[1:47:55] for years and then I had an artic about
[1:47:58] the Tim Po had put out on the net that
[1:48:01] there was an earthquake there he said
[1:48:03] sometime in the 70s and that there was
[1:48:06] memos from the owner of the make company
[1:48:10] and he put out an article like that so I
[1:48:11] tell myself before I really go forward
[1:48:13] to say it I got to make an investigation
[1:48:16] so my daughter Grace she is a research I
[1:48:19] would specialist she was trained for
[1:48:22] that so she went back in the AR of Los
[1:48:25] Angeles and she made a Toral research on
[1:48:27] the net she knows how to going into it
[1:48:29] and what to do and then she came up with
[1:48:31] an article that she write for me and
[1:48:33] that is back in
[1:48:36] 1971 there was an eclipse of the moon of
[1:48:38] the Earth and the moon the earth and the
[1:48:41] the the Sun and the Moon pulled on
[1:48:43] opposite sides of the earth and the
[1:48:45] scientist says that this caused an
[1:48:46] earthquake in Los Angeles and what it
[1:48:49] did is it busted the dam in Los Angeles
[1:48:51] and the waters from the dam came in and
[1:48:54] it met and the waters from the ocean
[1:48:55] came in and the waters destroyed the
[1:48:58] hospital they said there was some
[1:48:59] articles said it was I think 62 and some
[1:49:02] say it was 65 people that died there's
[1:49:05] no you know there's two different uh
[1:49:07] reports on it but anyway it came right
[1:49:10] up to the May building and there was a
[1:49:12] memo from the owners of the May building
[1:49:15] telling the the workers telling the
[1:49:17] workers that not to go into the basement
[1:49:20] because there could be sharks swimming
[1:49:21] there so that was back in
[1:49:24] 1971 and brother Billy Paul was 36 years
[1:49:28] old and he said he was not an old man so
[1:49:32] you know sometimes we think that the
[1:49:34] prophecy didn't was not fulfilled but it
[1:49:37] was and the God we give the honor and
[1:49:40] the praise for everything all right let
[1:49:42] us let us stand at this time for a word
[1:49:46] of
[1:49:48] prayer Lord
[1:49:51] God we Feel So Unworthy as we think of
[1:49:54] how great you
[1:49:55] are and father as we enter into into
[1:49:58] your word let the anointing of your
[1:50:00] spirit come upon this
[1:50:01] congregation upon your unworthy servant
[1:50:04] Lord and the father we have spent many
[1:50:08] times here in this meetings and we pray
[1:50:10] that you'll bless brother Israel father
[1:50:12] as he tries to Faithfully stand behind
[1:50:14] this pulpit and this congregation here
[1:50:17] father may you bless them oh God Of
[1:50:19] Heaven let your Holy Spirit pour out in
[1:50:22] a mighty way Lord upon all of us as we
[1:50:25] look to you and thank you in Jesus name
[1:50:27] amen now we are going to go into this
[1:50:32] little message that I want to entitle it
[1:50:34] the reconciliation of all things it will
[1:50:38] time with what we were saying yesterday
[1:50:40] to the ministers and then from there by
[1:50:43] the grace of God we will move
[1:50:46] on now we want to look at this
[1:50:50] scriptures
[1:50:51] of um 2
[1:50:55] Corinthians chapter 5 from verse
[1:50:58] 17 and Paul's speaking
[1:51:00] here verse 17 to 21 therefore If any man
[1:51:04] be in Christ 2 Corinthians 5:17 to
[1:51:09] 21 therefore If any man be in Christ he
[1:51:11] is a new creature old things are passed
[1:51:14] away behold all things have become new
[1:51:17] and all things are of God who were
[1:51:19] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[1:51:23] and had given to us the ministry of
[1:51:26] reconciliation to it that God was in
[1:51:28] Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:51:31] himself not imputing their trespasses
[1:51:34] unto them and had committed unto us the
[1:51:37] word of
[1:51:39] reconciliation now then we are
[1:51:42] ambassadors for Christ as though God did
[1:51:45] beseech You by us we pray you in Christ
[1:51:48] dead be be reconciled to
[1:51:53] God for he had made him to be sin for us
[1:51:57] who knew no sin that we might be made
[1:51:59] the righteousness of God in him and then
[1:52:03] we will take another scripture here
[1:52:05] which is Colossians chapter
[1:52:08] 1 uh from verse 17 to 23 Colossians
[1:52:12] chapter
[1:52:13] 1 uh verse 17 and he is before all
[1:52:16] things and by him all things consist and
[1:52:20] he is the head of the body the church
[1:52:21] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[1:52:23] the dead that in all things he might
[1:52:25] have the preeminence for it pleased the
[1:52:28] father that in him should all dwell this
[1:52:31] full that all dwell DW all fullness
[1:52:34] dwell excuse
[1:52:36] me can someone bring me a little bit of
[1:52:38] water okay I think I have some water
[1:52:40] here could you bring me a little bit of
[1:52:41] water please thank you and having made
[1:52:44] peace through the blood of his cross by
[1:52:47] him to reconcile all things unto himself
[1:52:49] self by him I say whether it be things
[1:52:52] in Earth or things in heaven and you
[1:52:55] that were sometimes alen and enemies in
[1:52:59] your mind by Wicked Works yet now ha he
[1:53:03] reconciled in the body of his flesh
[1:53:06] through that to present you holy and in
[1:53:08] unblamable and irrova in his sight if he
[1:53:12] continue in the faith grounded and
[1:53:14] settled and be not moved away from the
[1:53:16] hope of the Gospel which you have heard
[1:53:18] and which was preached to every creature
[1:53:20] which is under heaven where of I Paul
[1:53:22] are made a minister uh there's another
[1:53:26] scripture I would like to read for you
[1:53:30] just before you
[1:53:32] sit um this is a very important
[1:53:35] scripture for our
[1:53:37] study goodness yeah I think I um it's on
[1:53:41] the table thank you is well I forgot it
[1:53:44] and it's found in 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:53:47] 15 and Paul speaking here first
[1:53:51] Corinthians we will refer back to this
[1:53:53] scripture a little later on as we get
[1:53:55] into our
[1:53:58] study 1 Corinthians chapter 15 thank you
[1:54:01] thank you and we will read here from
[1:54:04] verse
[1:54:06] 26 but now is Christ risen from the dead
[1:54:10] and become the first fruits of them that
[1:54:12] slept for since by mind came that by
[1:54:16] mind came also the resurrection of the
[1:54:19] Dead for as in Adam all died even so in
[1:54:23] Christ shall all be made alive but every
[1:54:27] man in his own order Christ the first
[1:54:29] fruits afterwards they that are Christ
[1:54:32] at his coming oh god of
[1:54:35] Heaven bless your word Lord bless your
[1:54:39] people Inspire our hearts we pray in
[1:54:41] Jesus name
[1:54:44] amen God richly bless
[1:54:48] you you can be seated God bless you all
[1:54:52] what an honor and a privilege to be here
[1:54:55] amen amen and we thank the Lord now this
[1:54:58] morning we want to talk a little bit
[1:54:59] about the
[1:55:00] reconciliation of all
[1:55:03] things okay how God brings it and
[1:55:07] yesterday in the Ministries meeting we
[1:55:09] spoke a little bit about it and we
[1:55:11] showed where there's a
[1:55:14] Reconciliation where a pastor could
[1:55:17] reconcile individuals if there's a
[1:55:19] problem between you you could be
[1:55:20] reconciled and then there's a
[1:55:22] Reconciliation between us and God like
[1:55:24] the reconciliation of us with each other
[1:55:27] and then there's a reconciliation with
[1:55:29] you and I with God and then there's a
[1:55:31] Reconciliation of the word of God with
[1:55:34] the word of God when we see that
[1:55:36] statements maybe God make a statement
[1:55:38] over here and you know the Bible said
[1:55:40] something over here it says something
[1:55:42] over here that seems to contradict
[1:55:43] itself then how these two things
[1:55:46] reconcile or as brother bam uses the
[1:55:48] word to be able to EXP express it he use
[1:55:50] the word that these things death tail
[1:55:53] now before we go into the reconciliation
[1:55:55] of all of that I have something a
[1:55:58] question for all of
[1:56:00] us this is not a trap
[1:56:04] please I want to ask you a question we
[1:56:08] have heard now this is going to sound
[1:56:09] very contradictory to what you've been
[1:56:11] taught okay we've been heard all along
[1:56:16] since we've been in this
[1:56:18] message that we cannot be
[1:56:20] deceived and I believe it but I want to
[1:56:24] ask you a
[1:56:25] question were you
[1:56:30] deceived were you ever
[1:56:35] deceived silent
[1:56:38] quiet that's all right
[1:56:44] huh were you
[1:56:47] deceived now this something I want to
[1:56:50] share with you here because I want to I
[1:56:53] want to tie this
[1:56:57] deception with
[1:57:00] debt what you call a dying Church which
[1:57:03] a lot of people don't know what the
[1:57:04] church when it's dies what it means and
[1:57:07] when an individual is dead spiritually
[1:57:09] they don't know what it means because
[1:57:10] butam said that the last plague that
[1:57:12] hits the church is spiritual de a lot of
[1:57:14] people don't know what it means but let
[1:57:15] me go back to my
[1:57:18] question
[1:57:20] were you deceived no huh no some say no
[1:57:24] some say yes well let's go to the
[1:57:27] [Laughter]
[1:57:33] Bible represent yes let's go to the
[1:57:37] Bible and see what the Bible
[1:57:39] says all right Titus Chapter 3 from
[1:57:43] verse
[1:57:45] three for we ourselves also were
[1:57:48] sometimes foolish
[1:57:52] disobedient
[1:57:56] deceived serving diverse lust and
[1:58:00] Pleasures living in Malice and envy
[1:58:03] hateful and hating other one
[1:58:08] another now this deception that Paul
[1:58:12] speaks of here brother Brandon teaches
[1:58:15] us that we were deceived and how we were
[1:58:18] deceived so both Paul and brother
[1:58:21] brandham deals with this and it is
[1:58:24] necessary for us to see
[1:58:26] this because in order for us to
[1:58:29] understand what happened we have to go
[1:58:32] back to the Book of Genesis because
[1:58:34] Genesis is the beginning of all things
[1:58:37] so we could really see what happened
[1:58:39] there in the deception now both brother
[1:58:42] brandham and Paul takes us back there
[1:58:46] and when we and here Paul also o
[1:58:50] mentions as we go back to it in
[1:58:54] Ephesians 2 verse 1 and 7 Paul tells us
[1:58:58] and you had he Quicken who were dead in
[1:59:01] trespasses and sins now we were dead in
[1:59:05] trespasses and
[1:59:07] sins but when a man is dead there is
[1:59:09] signs that he is
[1:59:12] dead do you know that there is no
[1:59:14] scientific definition for
[1:59:18] that because death according what I
[1:59:21] remember when I was studying as a
[1:59:22] biochemist and they said death is the
[1:59:24] cation of of living activities but even
[1:59:27] in the de there's still stuff going on
[1:59:29] there that looks like
[1:59:34] life do you know that the man is De and
[1:59:37] there's still stuff going on in that
[1:59:40] body so really they don't know what that
[1:59:43] really is but this message tell us that
[1:59:45] that is separation from life now if we
[1:59:48] want to go back a little bit to the Book
[1:59:50] of Genesis to see really what happened
[1:59:53] in the Book of Genesis so that we could
[1:59:55] understand this
[1:59:57] deception because we were deceived and
[2:00:00] how we were
[2:00:01] deceived now it's hard to understand to
[2:00:05] to understand this but this is necessary
[2:00:08] for us to see it if we are able to see
[2:00:10] the reconciliation of God how God
[2:00:12] reconciled us so we want to go back to
[2:00:15] the Book of Genesis and see what
[2:00:17] happened with our with with Eve and Adam
[2:00:20] back in the Book of
[2:00:21] Genesis now we go to Genesis CH 3 from
[2:00:25] verse
[2:00:26] 1 and the Bible says here now the
[2:00:29] serpent was more subtle than any beast
[2:00:31] of the field which the Lord God had
[2:00:34] made now this serpent we all understand
[2:00:37] that Satan incarnates himself three
[2:00:40] times in the Bible now everything runs
[2:00:42] in threes the prophet of God says so
[2:00:45] Satan incarnated himself three times in
[2:00:47] the Bible First he incarnates him self
[2:00:49] in the Beast which is here this is an
[2:00:51] incarnation of Satan in the Beast the
[2:00:54] second time Satan incarnates himself is
[2:00:56] in Judas and the third time that he
[2:00:59] incarnates himself is in the Beast where
[2:01:01] when he comes to the Beast brother bam
[2:01:03] says you all know he comes to the pope
[2:01:05] and in the heart of the pope is a
[2:01:07] devil and then he tells the devil to
[2:01:09] leave and the devil leaves and then
[2:01:10] Satan himself came in the Bible tells us
[2:01:13] in St John Chapter 13 if I remember
[2:01:16] right that Satan entered into the heart
[2:01:19] of Judas now the being Satan is not
[2:01:24] everywhere this is what a lot of people
[2:01:26] think in their mind well Satan is
[2:01:27] everywhere Satan the being cannot be
[2:01:30] there is only one being that is
[2:01:32] everywhere and that is God and God can
[2:01:34] be in more than one place at the same
[2:01:36] time and God of course gave brother bam
[2:01:38] that gift that brother Bam could be
[2:01:39] standing at the ppit and he's back 25
[2:01:42] years or he's back 30 years in the life
[2:01:44] of someone like God could take Moses and
[2:01:46] put him right back to the dawn of
[2:01:48] creation and then Moses could write all
[2:01:50] what he saw and he did the same thing
[2:01:52] with John when he took John John was
[2:01:54] right on the a of atmas but he took John
[2:01:57] and transported him into the coming day
[2:01:59] of the Lord so if the being Satan is
[2:02:03] standing right here now he's got demons
[2:02:05] all over the place and his kingdom is
[2:02:07] all over the place but brother Brandon
[2:02:09] clearly tells us that Satan the being
[2:02:12] Satan cannot be in more than one place
[2:02:14] at the same time that is not possible
[2:02:19] when we say Satan is everywhere we are
[2:02:21] making a huge mistake because Satan is
[2:02:24] not God and cannot be in one place at
[2:02:27] the same time if Satan is right here I'm
[2:02:29] talking about the being Satan Lucifer if
[2:02:33] he's standing right near me here
[2:02:34] tempting me he cannot be in the back
[2:02:36] over there he cannot be in Africa he
[2:02:38] cannot be in Europe but he's got demons
[2:02:41] all over the place so the kingdom of
[2:02:44] Satan is all over the place his demons
[2:02:46] but his being Lucifer no amen no no no
[2:02:52] no no so the being Lucifer comes and in
[2:02:57] the heart of the pope is a devil then he
[2:02:59] orders the devil to leave and then
[2:03:01] Lucifer comes in and when he steps in
[2:03:04] that man changes from the Antichrist to
[2:03:06] become the Beast and then we have one
[2:03:09] quotation from the message that brother
[2:03:11] gram was going to preach on the trail of
[2:03:13] the serpent I have a quote I could bring
[2:03:15] from that
[2:03:16] message and he said in the quot he says
[2:03:19] the beast at the beginning and the Beast
[2:03:21] at the end is the same Beast okay so
[2:03:24] Satan incarnates himself three times we
[2:03:26] will not go into that because in this
[2:03:29] age we have the Incarnation of God
[2:03:31] himself in his bride which is wonderful
[2:03:33] and but man de with that in the series
[2:03:35] we will not go into that today okay but
[2:03:37] now if we are to continue here in um in
[2:03:42] Genesis 3 and verse one now the serpent
[2:03:45] was more subtle than any beast of the
[2:03:47] field which the Lord God had made and he
[2:03:49] said unto the woman yeah had God said he
[2:03:51] shall eat he shall not eat of every tree
[2:03:54] of the garden and then in verse two and
[2:03:57] the woman said unto the serpent we may
[2:03:59] eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
[2:04:01] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[2:04:03] which is in the midst of the garden God
[2:04:05] had said he shall not eat of it neither
[2:04:07] shall he touch it l he die amen then
[2:04:10] what happened the Beast told Satan I
[2:04:14] mean Satan and the serpent told Eve and
[2:04:16] the serpent woman he shall not show that
[2:04:19] now when the Su told that to Eve and Eve
[2:04:22] accepted it something happened right
[2:04:25] there Deb stepped in and when she died
[2:04:30] when a person dies spiritually we will
[2:04:32] deal with that because both Paul and
[2:04:34] brother manam deals with it there is a
[2:04:36] spiritual Deb and there is a physical
[2:04:38] Deb and the sign of a Dying church is
[2:04:42] deception and deception is when you
[2:04:44] cannot discern the difference between
[2:04:46] what is right and what is wrong amen e
[2:04:49] did not realize she couldn't discern the
[2:04:52] difference between reasoning and what
[2:04:55] the word of God is therefore she was
[2:04:58] dead now there's another aspect to that
[2:05:02] de that we will look at let me read for
[2:05:04] you a little bit if you're thinking in
[2:05:05] your mind that this is just brother
[2:05:07] fer brother Bram deals with it and Paul
[2:05:10] deals with it and here's where we have
[2:05:12] many Christians they cannot discern and
[2:05:15] people think well if a man if a church
[2:05:17] comes and the church is kind of quiet
[2:05:19] and they're not excited and a lot of
[2:05:21] movement in the church that church is a
[2:05:23] dead church and I've heard that all over
[2:05:25] the time and of course we know that we
[2:05:27] need a little bit of emotion and we want
[2:05:28] to shout and we want to praise the Lord
[2:05:30] but a shouting church does not mean a
[2:05:32] church is alive don't mistake that amen
[2:05:36] a church jumping up and long and
[2:05:37] screaming and screaming that doesn't
[2:05:39] mean that church Could Be As Dead As
[2:05:41] Dead can be it is when the Believers of
[2:05:43] that church has no discernment they
[2:05:46] cannot see the right from the wrong
[2:05:49] and this is what happened to Eve and
[2:05:51] brother Bram deals with it both brother
[2:05:53] Bram and Paul deals with
[2:05:55] it and let me go to the scriptures where
[2:05:57] Paul deals with spiritual de in the
[2:05:59] church so you can see what we're talking
[2:06:01] about and then from here we would move
[2:06:03] slightly into this spiritual death to
[2:06:06] show you before we move into the
[2:06:07] deception to show you how and what
[2:06:10] condition you and I we were all
[2:06:13] deceived yes that's
[2:06:16] right amen now some say Amen to that and
[2:06:20] that's not how you think amen but we
[2:06:24] prove it I'll prove it we'll bring in
[2:06:25] the quotes and the scriptures and show
[2:06:27] it to you thank you Lord okay so now
[2:06:30] let's go to what Paul says here as a
[2:06:32] church and an IND as spiritual Deb hit
[2:06:35] them there are certain symptoms that we
[2:06:37] see and by the symptoms that we see we
[2:06:39] know that death is set in and these are
[2:06:42] not things that we are judging ourselves
[2:06:43] we go to the word of God to identify
[2:06:45] this and we have Christians coming to
[2:06:48] church that
[2:06:49] literally dead and we get to it in a
[2:06:51] while what happens is the church dies
[2:06:54] now not only is the church die but all
[2:06:58] of
[2:06:58] us all of us we also died all of us died
[2:07:04] where did we die we died in Adam because
[2:07:07] the Bible says as in Adam all
[2:07:11] died and Paul deals with that now let me
[2:07:16] let me slow down a little bit on this
[2:07:19] let me expl a little bit to read for you
[2:07:21] so that you could see that we all were
[2:07:24] dead amen all right let's go here and
[2:07:27] look
[2:07:29] at Ephesians chap 2 and verse
[2:07:33] 1-7 and you had he Quicken who were dead
[2:07:37] in trespasses and sins wherein in time
[2:07:40] past you walk according to the C of this
[2:07:42] world according to the prince of the
[2:07:44] power of the air the spirit that work in
[2:07:46] the children of Disobedience whom are
[2:07:48] among whom also we all had our
[2:07:50] conversation in time pass in the lust of
[2:07:52] our flesh fulfilling the desires of the
[2:07:55] Flesh and of the mind and will by nature
[2:07:57] isur of Wrath even as
[2:07:59] others but God who is rich in Mercy for
[2:08:02] his great love wherein he loved us even
[2:08:05] when we were dead in sins had Quicken us
[2:08:10] together with Christ by Grace he is
[2:08:12] saved so all of us we were
[2:08:16] dead and where does that dead go it goes
[2:08:19] right back to Genesis Genesis amen now a
[2:08:24] strange thing happened here when Eve
[2:08:26] opened her heart and she received what
[2:08:29] the devil did Eve
[2:08:32] died and not only did she die she took
[2:08:36] Adam with her and all creation died now
[2:08:39] the language of the Bible is very
[2:08:41] strange when it comes to that because
[2:08:43] the Bible didn't does not tell us that
[2:08:46] that we all died in Eve because we know
[2:08:48] that Eve Eve was the mother of all but
[2:08:51] let me go back and read the scriptures
[2:08:52] which we just read of course the Bible
[2:08:55] tells us for as in Adam all
[2:08:59] died for who as in as in Adam all died
[2:09:04] but now when God created Adam and Eve
[2:09:06] God never called Eve Eve God called the
[2:09:09] both of them
[2:09:11] Adam and then Adam called Eve Eve so
[2:09:15] Adam gave her the name of Eve why did
[2:09:17] Adam call call her
[2:09:20] Eve because she is the mother of so Eve
[2:09:24] is a type of all
[2:09:27] things she types the bride of
[2:09:32] Christ she types the
[2:09:35] prostitutes she's the type of all
[2:09:37] things she's the mother of all Adam is
[2:09:41] not the father of
[2:09:44] all because a woman is designed in such
[2:09:47] a way that she could bring bring forth
[2:09:48] children from different men a man can
[2:09:51] only bring a seed from
[2:09:53] himself yall understand church that's
[2:09:56] why God is typed as a man a woman could
[2:09:59] receive seed from different men that's
[2:10:01] why she could be a prostitute because
[2:10:04] she could bring forth one child here and
[2:10:06] another in other words she could bring
[2:10:08] forth different seeds from different
[2:10:10] things and that's exactly what happened
[2:10:11] with Eve she brought forth seeds from
[2:10:14] different things she brought forth seed
[2:10:16] from Adam and Seed from the serpent a
[2:10:17] woman could do it but a man
[2:10:21] can't she she's designed that way you
[2:10:24] all understand what I'm saying and
[2:10:25] brother B said that was the weakness in
[2:10:28] her oh God help us yes now when the
[2:10:32] devil came to Eve where did Eve fell the
[2:10:35] prophet of God says he said she fell
[2:10:37] because she failed to use the word now
[2:10:41] if Eve had stood there stand her ground
[2:10:44] and said listen old old serpent whoever
[2:10:47] it is talking to me whoever you are
[2:10:49] talking to me listen what you are saying
[2:10:51] is not what God Said but the devil
[2:10:54] brother Bram said studied the human race
[2:10:56] he spoke about it in the message the
[2:10:58] conflict between God and Satan he
[2:11:00] studied the human race so much that he
[2:11:02] found the weak spot and the weak spot
[2:11:05] was human reasoning what we call Common
[2:11:08] Sense and of all the powers that Satan
[2:11:11] has the prophet of God tell us the most
[2:11:14] potent power that Satan has is his
[2:11:16] ability to reason things it looked
[2:11:19] logical but God did not say
[2:11:23] it and when he felt he failed to
[2:11:26] recognize that because when she open her
[2:11:29] heart to listen to the devil and she
[2:11:31] begin to receive it from the devil Eve
[2:11:35] died and Paul gives a warning to the
[2:11:38] Corinthians and brother bham also give
[2:11:40] us a warning for this particular age and
[2:11:43] Paul spoke about it here in 1
[2:11:45] Corinthians chapter 11 as he speak about
[2:11:47] the death of the church church now we
[2:11:49] would look at debt the debt of the
[2:11:52] church and the symptoms that we have
[2:11:55] from the message we have two symptoms
[2:11:57] from the word of God that identifies a
[2:11:59] dying church when a church is dying and
[2:12:03] when an individual is
[2:12:05] dying you all understand so let's look
[2:12:09] at it here in 1 Corinthians chapter
[2:12:16] 11 and Paul speaking
[2:12:20] here and he
[2:12:24] says he says he speaking about the
[2:12:26] Lord's Supper he says here after the
[2:12:30] same man also he took the cup which when
[2:12:32] he had stopped saying this cup is the
[2:12:35] New Testament in my blood this do ye as
[2:12:37] often as he drink it in remembrance of
[2:12:38] me excuse
[2:12:40] me for as often as he eat this bread and
[2:12:43] drink this cup he shall he do show the
[2:12:44] Lord's death till he come wherefore
[2:12:46] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[2:12:48] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[2:12:51] guilty of the blood of the body and
[2:12:52] blood of the
[2:12:53] Lord but let a man examine
[2:12:58] himself and so let him eat of that bread
[2:13:00] and drink of that cup for he that eateth
[2:13:02] and drinketh unworthily eateth drink
[2:13:05] damnation to himself not Discerning the
[2:13:07] Lord's body for this cause many are weak
[2:13:10] and sickly among you and many sleep
[2:13:13] brother gram says this many sleep here
[2:13:14] is really he said in the real
[2:13:16] translation because in the French it
[2:13:18] says many are dead and that's exactly
[2:13:20] what brother brandham
[2:13:22] says they're dead because they have no
[2:13:25] ability no capacity to discern the
[2:13:28] Lord's
[2:13:29] body now I'm going to go a little deep
[2:13:31] into that discern the Lord's body all
[2:13:34] right let's read a little quote what
[2:13:35] brother bam says concerning this year
[2:13:38] Discerning the Lord's body and that they
[2:13:40] are dead are you with are you with
[2:13:42] me because many Christians has no
[2:13:45] discernment right any anything H
[2:13:49] preacher could get up behind the PO and
[2:13:50] preach anything on the congregation
[2:13:51] scream
[2:13:53] amen it's a dead
[2:13:56] Church let's be
[2:14:02] honest another thing when they
[2:14:05] die they fail oh look let me look let me
[2:14:09] deal with this one first see that's why
[2:14:13] you have preachers getting up behind the
[2:14:14] PO and preaching anything and part of
[2:14:17] the reason is this Body of Christ in the
[2:14:19] end time is composed of two parts I'm
[2:14:23] going to read it for you brother says a
[2:14:25] part of the body is dead and a part is
[2:14:27] alive the
[2:14:30] body now if you have life you cannot be
[2:14:37] deceived and if you have debt you can be
[2:14:40] deceived if you have debt you deceived
[2:14:44] am amen because life is light and life
[2:14:50] comes by the word of God there is no
[2:14:53] life outside of the word now look no
[2:14:55] listen listen I know we're making some
[2:14:58] powerful statements and you might have
[2:14:59] questions in your mind but let me go to
[2:15:01] the quotes so you can see for yourself
[2:15:05] okay in the message Discerning
[2:15:08] Discerning the spirit of the Lord
[2:15:09] Brother bam says here we need to discern
[2:15:12] it by the
[2:15:13] word the word is right it takes the word
[2:15:17] God's word is always right we can't
[2:15:19] discern by what people think what
[2:15:22] intellectuals tell us what psychiatrists
[2:15:25] tell us we got to go by What God Says
[2:15:28] man shall not live by Brother alone but
[2:15:30] by every word that proceeded out of the
[2:15:31] mouth of God not Discerning the Lord's
[2:15:33] body many are weak and sick and many are
[2:15:37] asleep dead spiritually dead the last
[2:15:42] plague that H Egypt was death brother
[2:15:44] brother um whisper spoke about that and
[2:15:47] also so I think brother Paul spoke a
[2:15:49] little bit about that when they talk
[2:15:50] about Egypt okay the last he says here
[2:15:53] the last PL that in Egypt was dead the
[2:15:55] last PL that hit the church is spiritual
[2:15:57] death what we need today is a Spiritual
[2:16:01] Awakening A Spiritual Awakening to
[2:16:07] discernment what is discernment when you
[2:16:09] are able to discern this is the word of
[2:16:12] God and this is the reasoning of man God
[2:16:16] did not say it it didn't come from
[2:16:22] God now when this happened with Eve it
[2:16:26] set the whole human race into debt and
[2:16:28] then another thing happened that all of
[2:16:30] us need to look at and I'm going to
[2:16:33] share a little bit with you and that is
[2:16:36] the Bible tell us that we all we all
[2:16:40] went
[2:16:41] astray because here is something else
[2:16:44] that happens when spiritual death hits
[2:16:47] the church
[2:16:48] right and the sign of a dying
[2:16:51] man not only does he not able to discern
[2:16:55] the difference between right and
[2:16:57] wrong which many people don't realize it
[2:17:00] you got a dead Church like I told you
[2:17:02] all before the one preacher told me that
[2:17:04] he said he was inviting me to come and
[2:17:06] preach he said mother Fus no worry you
[2:17:08] can come in and preach anything he said
[2:17:10] our congregation is strin never to
[2:17:12] question the
[2:17:16] ministry
[2:17:21] now I'm going in there to preach the
[2:17:22] were dead at that time I did not realize
[2:17:24] there was a dead church I was preaching
[2:17:28] too it's not that you want to stand up
[2:17:31] there and just to show that you're right
[2:17:32] you know I'm going to go there and
[2:17:33] question the ministry you know because
[2:17:35] some people just love to have an
[2:17:36] argumented Spirit that's not it that's
[2:17:38] not of the Lord and that's wrong and
[2:17:41] I've seen it in congregation where
[2:17:42] people want they love to fight the
[2:17:44] pastor if they could they love to pre
[2:17:46] prove that the preacher is wrong if they
[2:17:47] could that's not the spirit of Christ
[2:17:50] but when we see something contrary to
[2:17:51] the word of God we have to be able to
[2:17:53] have that discernment now how do we have
[2:17:55] the discernment as the church dies
[2:17:58] another element comes in when Adam and
[2:18:01] Eve died in the in the Garden of Eden
[2:18:03] God came down and what did Adam and Eve
[2:18:06] do they ran and hid themselves who did
[2:18:09] they hid themselves from God instead of
[2:18:11] Adam rushing out to said no let's seek
[2:18:13] God let's cry out to god let's cry out
[2:18:16] to God they r hid themselves and brother
[2:18:19] brandham deals with this as the church
[2:18:22] dies and in the church ages he mentions
[2:18:24] that he says that desire to Crow out
[2:18:26] into the spirit desire to know the word
[2:18:30] of the Lord to know the word of the Lord
[2:18:32] all of that Fades so when you have
[2:18:35] individuals in the church and there's no
[2:18:38] cry in their hearts to be able to know
[2:18:42] the word of God there's no cry in their
[2:18:45] hearts father show me your word show me
[2:18:48] you will that is a sign of a dead
[2:18:54] church
[2:18:56] now
[2:18:57] um brother Brandon talking about the
[2:19:00] dead Church here's what he said about
[2:19:04] it and we're going to go a little deep
[2:19:08] into it I'm going to have to watch
[2:19:09] myself now because I'm going to be
[2:19:11] pretty long on this Israel help me right
[2:19:13] because I don't want to take too much
[2:19:14] time because I could go pretty long in
[2:19:16] this and I don't want to do it but uh
[2:19:19] here's what brother bam said of it in
[2:19:22] question and answers here he says now
[2:19:24] this is a striking thing please don't
[2:19:26] take it as a Doctrine but do you
[2:19:29] understand what the scripture says will
[2:19:31] take place when that did time was over
[2:19:33] for look there was seven virgins or 10
[2:19:36] virgins went out to meet the bridegroom
[2:19:39] we have Jesus speaking about these 10
[2:19:40] vergins in Matthew chapter 25 we will
[2:19:43] try not to go to Matthew chapter 25 in
[2:19:46] order to save some time if if we don't
[2:19:47] have to okay I think all of us are all
[2:19:50] of the 10 sleeping ver 10 virgins but
[2:19:53] the B says half of them had Ed their
[2:19:55] lamp and half of them didn't that's the
[2:19:57] part of the body that is dead and the
[2:20:01] part that's
[2:20:03] alive there's five they went out behold
[2:20:06] the bridegroom they all trimmed or walk
[2:20:09] they all trimmed or walk and trimmed
[2:20:10] their lamps to go into the wedding
[2:20:12] supper but you see five of them were
[2:20:15] wise and five were foolish what made
[2:20:17] These Foolish versions so foolish
[2:20:20] brother bam spoke about it and spoken
[2:20:21] with the Original Seed he says the
[2:20:23] foolish version represented the group
[2:20:26] that failed to get all in their lamp
[2:20:29] they didn't go to get the Holy Ghost
[2:20:31] until it was too late and when a man
[2:20:33] cannot move to get what God promised him
[2:20:36] he will not trow for it he will not seek
[2:20:39] it it's a sign of death and that death
[2:20:42] hit all of us that's why listen Church
[2:20:46] it hit all of us
[2:20:48] that's why when Jesus was here he said
[2:20:50] search the scriptures search the
[2:20:52] scriptures so brother bam talking about
[2:20:55] it he said that cry for reaching out in
[2:20:57] the spirit that cry for knowing the word
[2:21:00] of the Lord he talking about the
[2:21:01] Ephesians it all fading out why the
[2:21:04] church is
[2:21:06] dying so you have a church amen when
[2:21:09] time to come and pray that they will get
[2:21:11] another filling of the Holy Ghost they
[2:21:13] will not do
[2:21:15] it you have a church power of the body
[2:21:17] is alive and part is dead and then you
[2:21:19] wonder how come this brother will do it
[2:21:21] and that brother over here wouldn't do
[2:21:22] it the one who is not doing it he is
[2:21:24] spiritually dead it's a sign of death
[2:21:27] look at Adam and Eve
[2:21:31] amen you follow me now so people don't
[2:21:34] know what a dying church is some of them
[2:21:36] is dead and they're talking about a dead
[2:21:38] Church imagine the dead sometime the
[2:21:41] dead calling the church arve dead that's
[2:21:43] right because they don't even know what
[2:21:46] that is they're so blind that's why the
[2:21:48] Bible when when they act spiritual
[2:21:49] discernment the word of God says they
[2:21:51] are blind they are so blind that they
[2:21:53] cannot tell where one one is life and
[2:21:56] what is death they don't know the
[2:21:57] difference they see life and call it
[2:22:04] death you
[2:22:06] following now when the Bible tells us so
[2:22:10] we have the body let me go little
[2:22:11] further with you so you will see brother
[2:22:14] bam in the church ages he said but
[2:22:16] notice revelation chapter 21 describe
[2:22:18] the Lord Jesus as in the midst of the
[2:22:20] church and holding the messengers in his
[2:22:22] right hand because his bride has fallen
[2:22:25] because the church cooperate is now a
[2:22:27] mix a mixture of true and false he does
[2:22:30] not leave it it is his and according to
[2:22:32] Romans 1479 that is exactly right for
[2:22:36] none of us liveth to himself and no man
[2:22:38] died to himself for whether do we live
[2:22:40] we live unto the Lord and whether we die
[2:22:42] we die unto the Lord whether we live
[2:22:44] therefore die we are the Lords for the
[2:22:47] for for to this end Christ both died and
[2:22:49] Rose and revived that he might be both
[2:22:51] lord of the dead and the living but
[2:22:53] theam explains that
[2:22:55] expression he says on the cross he
[2:22:57] brought the whole world of people they
[2:23:00] his he is the lord of the living and
[2:23:02] dead as pertaining to ownership not
[2:23:06] relationship now he is he is he is the
[2:23:09] Lord of everything because he owns
[2:23:12] everything but when you and I come to
[2:23:14] him and we say to him father is
[2:23:18] different because a father means we come
[2:23:21] from him you see a father is something
[2:23:23] that we are burdened from him we are his
[2:23:25] genes we are his seed so when we come to
[2:23:28] him I can say to him father because we
[2:23:30] come from him you are his child you came
[2:23:34] from him but now the one over there he
[2:23:37] can say father father as far as
[2:23:39] ownership is concerned he own all things
[2:23:41] he's Lord because he own all things but
[2:23:43] he has that a relationship that him was
[2:23:45] Lord because he is is not their lord and
[2:23:48] he is not their
[2:23:50] father now I'm not hearing a lot of Amen
[2:23:53] here but when he is your father you came
[2:23:56] from him which we will deal with it now
[2:23:58] what we want to deal with is this
[2:23:59] brother bam
[2:24:01] continues he says and he walks in the
[2:24:04] midst of that body that has within it
[2:24:07] life and death amen now he calls the
[2:24:09] foolish vergins although they will be
[2:24:11] save debt because the foolish version
[2:24:14] right now does not have life they
[2:24:16] receive life at the Judgment if they
[2:24:19] receive life right now they cannot be
[2:24:23] deceived then they fall in the category
[2:24:26] of the elect you follow me but brother
[2:24:29] Bram here in the CH versions he says
[2:24:32] that the foolish versions is a deceived
[2:24:35] church now you and I we were deceived
[2:24:38] and we will deal with that now but once
[2:24:41] life comes into us we can no longer be
[2:24:45] deceived
[2:24:50] for as in Adam all died so in Christ
[2:24:54] shall all be alive shall all be made
[2:24:57] what a man that is alive he could see he
[2:25:00] could tell this is darkness and this is
[2:25:02] life go to the Grave with the dead man
[2:25:03] and asking he don't know the difference
[2:25:06] yes sir he's dead now when we all died
[2:25:10] in
[2:25:11] Adam the Bible tells us this which I'll
[2:25:14] deal with this quickly and then we'll be
[2:25:15] able to move away from this
[2:25:18] quickly the Bible plainly tell us that
[2:25:21] none of us seek
[2:25:22] God we all went
[2:25:24] astray it's the nature of man to rebel
[2:25:27] against God it's his nature you try to
[2:25:31] tell him brother look repent you know
[2:25:33] God has all these things for you he
[2:25:35] stands there and he looks at you he's
[2:25:38] dead now let me let me read it I'll read
[2:25:41] for you a couple of scriptures on that
[2:25:42] of course I don't want to spend too too
[2:25:44] much time on that but we'll just look at
[2:25:46] at it in Psalm
[2:25:50] 53 David in the Psalms he says God
[2:25:54] looked down from heaven upon the
[2:25:55] children of men to see if there were any
[2:25:58] that did understand that they seek
[2:26:01] God every one of them is gone back they
[2:26:06] all become filthy there is none that Doe
[2:26:09] it good know not
[2:26:15] one who could
[2:26:18] say beat their chest and say I am
[2:26:23] righteous I did good none their very
[2:26:28] nature is to rebel against God that's
[2:26:33] right
[2:26:35] amen and they will rebel against God and
[2:26:38] they are rebelling against God look
[2:26:41] Isaiah said the same thing if you want
[2:26:43] to look at Isaiah chapter 53 and verse 6
[2:26:46] and Isaiah says here and as for excuse
[2:26:49] me and Isaiah says
[2:26:51] 53:6 all we like sheep have gone astray
[2:26:55] we have turned everyone to his own way
[2:26:59] and the Lord had laid on him the
[2:27:01] iniquity the iniquity of us all that was
[2:27:04] Isaiah the prophet in the Old Testament
[2:27:06] that's why they all go astray I don't
[2:27:09] care who they
[2:27:10] are he might be a preacher in the buet
[2:27:14] he might be a deacon he might be a song
[2:27:16] leader yes whoever he is he all they all
[2:27:18] went astray and then brother bam told us
[2:27:21] something he I want to share with
[2:27:23] you are you following yes or am I
[2:27:26] getting it am I I don't know if I'm
[2:27:29] getting it a little bit too choppy or
[2:27:31] whatever huh is it all right all right
[2:27:34] and that's why what brother whisper
[2:27:36] preached last night is so essential on
[2:27:38] the new birth because the prophet made a
[2:27:41] statement on that and he says you will
[2:27:44] never agree on the word word of God
[2:27:47] until you're born again
[2:27:50] never
[2:27:52] listen listen Trish I tell you you on
[2:27:54] his truth we ministers a true Minister
[2:27:57] we don't trying to get the people to
[2:27:59] agree with
[2:28:00] us that's not our purpose right that's
[2:28:03] right you think I want you even me I
[2:28:05] don't even want to agree with
[2:28:07] myself I want to agree with
[2:28:10] God that's where he made the mistake
[2:28:13] that's what the Holy Ghost is trying to
[2:28:14] do is to reconcile us to what am not
[2:28:17] only to each other but to
[2:28:19] [Music]
[2:28:21] God you see we want to die to our own
[2:28:24] ideas I don't want my idea no if an idea
[2:28:27] is in Me God help me I don't want it
[2:28:29] amen I want to pray and say God deliver
[2:28:31] me from that you want to you do the same
[2:28:34] we all have that design in our hearts
[2:28:36] you see it sometime a brother might see
[2:28:38] something different to me he look what
[2:28:40] brother Ferguson this is something here
[2:28:41] and I look at it this might be something
[2:28:42] here I might not see it the way that he
[2:28:44] sees it and then I say Lord God Of
[2:28:46] Heaven Am I Wrong show me father because
[2:28:48] if he could bring me something I want to
[2:28:49] be right and we all want to be right we
[2:28:52] want and if we are wrong we want to be
[2:28:54] corrected see I don't want to deviate
[2:28:56] too much but you know to just to show
[2:28:58] you the nature of human beings how they
[2:29:00] go contrer you know they all went
[2:29:04] astray see and we drifted all of us I
[2:29:08] remember there
[2:29:10] was there was but Paul there was a
[2:29:12] little Baptist preacher out there in up
[2:29:14] in Vermillion Bay up in Northwestern
[2:29:16] Haron got up there at the church several
[2:29:18] I went in there and baptized a little
[2:29:19] sister I call sister maryan and it
[2:29:22] created a big Stern area one person I
[2:29:24] baptized imagine that and he got up on
[2:29:27] the radio this Baptist preach he said
[2:29:28] these cult leaders he said this George
[2:29:30] Ferguson coming in from Montreal call me
[2:29:32] by my name he says um to deceive the
[2:29:35] people he said he's a deceiver of men S
[2:29:37] A friend of mine at that time he was he
[2:29:41] owned a a big company up there called
[2:29:43] Red Lake Lumber and the government of
[2:29:44] Ontario had given him the rights to
[2:29:47] exploit 60 square meter 100 kilometers
[2:29:51] square kilometers of line so he was
[2:29:52] logging and Stuff AC course that
[2:29:54] businessman in the bankruptcy and stuff
[2:29:55] after anyway I flew in there because I
[2:29:57] used to fish on lakes and stuff up there
[2:29:59] and so I flew in there one day and I
[2:30:02] went up to this Baptist preacher home
[2:30:03] and I knocked in the
[2:30:07] door at that time we didn't have cell
[2:30:09] phones and stuff you know so he opened
[2:30:11] the door Saturday morning so there were
[2:30:13] some of the members of his church day he
[2:30:14] was having a Bible study with them
[2:30:17] so I told him I said you the pastor yes
[2:30:20] I says well good day Pastor I says I'm
[2:30:22] George Ferguson he says you you who I
[2:30:26] said I'm George
[2:30:28] Ferguson I says you're the pastor he
[2:30:30] said yes I says I heard it you appreci
[2:30:32] that I'm wrong he said yes he said
[2:30:33] you're false he said you're wrong I said
[2:30:36] all right I says I come for you to
[2:30:39] correct
[2:30:41] me I says I promise you I'll come into
[2:30:44] the house take your Bible show me
[2:30:47] anything that you see in the Bible where
[2:30:49] I'm wrong I says and I promise you I
[2:30:52] will I'll accept it I says not your
[2:30:54] explanation not your interpretation but
[2:30:57] I says anything he says no I will not
[2:30:59] open the Bible with you I say sir I says
[2:31:03] you believe I'm wrong yes you're wrong I
[2:31:06] says then please help me if you think
[2:31:08] I'm wrong no I will not discuss the
[2:31:10] Bible the two preachers couldn't you
[2:31:13] would two preachers they couldn't stand
[2:31:15] in in
[2:31:17] with you he said so I will not open the
[2:31:18] Bible he says one Methodist and one
[2:31:20] menite he said one Methodist and one
[2:31:22] menite preacher he said I said well sir
[2:31:24] I says all I'm asking is you believe I'm
[2:31:26] wrong yes you're wrong I says but please
[2:31:29] help me I says I promise you I'll come
[2:31:32] I'll sit I'll listen no I will not open
[2:31:34] the Bible with you I says well I cannot
[2:31:36] force you to correct me I says well I
[2:31:40] turn as members in the church and said
[2:31:41] God bless you I says God bless you
[2:31:43] Pastor and I left well two weeks later
[2:31:45] brother Paul
[2:31:47] there was a sister um that brother who
[2:31:49] was with me there his aunt was going to
[2:31:51] that church and she told him afterward
[2:31:54] she said two weeks later the
[2:31:55] congregation told her pastor you called
[2:31:57] a man a cult leader he came all the way
[2:31:59] here for you to correct him you refused
[2:32:01] to correct him we cannot have a apostle
[2:32:02] like you find yourself another church
[2:32:04] and he kicked him
[2:32:08] out
[2:32:13] now you know sometimes we don't know the
[2:32:15] ways of God is is different and God
[2:32:18] knows exactly what he was doing amen so
[2:32:21] all of us went
[2:32:22] astray and if we as we deviated there
[2:32:25] was nothing in us to seek God we all
[2:32:27] went after our own thoughts our own
[2:32:29] minds we all went and then what happened
[2:32:32] what did God do Jesus came he came to
[2:32:34] seek and to save that which was lost so
[2:32:37] you take an individual
[2:32:39] here all of the children the prophet of
[2:32:42] God says take a a kid don't teach him
[2:32:45] right around just leave alone and he
[2:32:47] will choose wrong why because it's the
[2:32:49] nature it's the nature in mind to Rebel
[2:32:53] he can't help himself he's born like
[2:32:55] that and this all goes right back to the
[2:32:57] beginning with Adam and Eve so we were
[2:33:00] we all went astray and that's the entire
[2:33:03] human race there is none that doeth good
[2:33:06] no not
[2:33:08] one and that's why the prophet of God
[2:33:10] tells us here and of course brother
[2:33:13] whisper was speaking about it and I
[2:33:15] thought that that was
[2:33:18] just um that was just so nice when you
[2:33:21] mentioned that concerning the
[2:33:24] um the
[2:33:27] um what he mentioned concerning the the
[2:33:30] new birth last night because the prophet
[2:33:32] tells us here and let me just read it
[2:33:34] for you quickly are you with me this
[2:33:36] morning well you're a little bit quiet
[2:33:37] on me this morning usually you are on me

[2:33:42] I'm going to read it for you it's in the
[2:33:43] Statue of a perfect man and brother
[2:33:46] whisper really went deep into that and
[2:33:49] let's see the statue of perfect man let
[2:33:53] me see here maybe I'm missed I'm missing
[2:33:55] it somehow uh just excuse me here just
[2:33:58] one second and he says you will never
[2:34:01] you will never agree on the word of
[2:34:05] God until you're born

[2:34:11] goodness

[2:34:17] huh on the screen on the screen yes here
[2:34:19] it is yeah just go wrong a little bit
[2:34:21] brother let's read it
[2:34:23] here he said brother whisper read it he
[2:34:27] says first you must be born again and
[2:34:29] then when you are born again you have
[2:34:31] faith you believe the word until you
[2:34:33] born again you'll
[2:34:36] argue you will do what AR when you hear
[2:34:39] them arguing against it why do you think
[2:34:41] they're arguing against it amen you will
[2:34:44] say well he's got a different IDE it to
[2:34:46] me no it's simply because he's still
[2:34:50] dead it's not that he's aging with you
[2:34:53] he's aging against the word because if
[2:34:56] you if you bring the word and you says
[2:34:57] brother here here here's the word of
[2:35:02] God read it yourself like what I did
[2:35:04] with the bah remember my my remember my
[2:35:07] bah story I don't want to go back into
[2:35:08] that again you're looking at me kind of
[2:35:11] strange now remember my B story amen huh
[2:35:15] amen how many how many of you all never

[2:35:19] don't want to go into that many so you
[2:35:21] but whisper you never heard that b
[2:35:23] story where I'm in
[2:35:26] trouble all right I I'll go
[2:35:29] quick we were at the meetings once
[2:35:31] brother Paul and coming into our
[2:35:33] church was a bah so after the service he
[2:35:37] came up to me and told me he says I am a
[2:35:39] bah well what he didn't know is that I
[2:35:42] know what the bah
[2:35:44] believe
[2:35:46] so I told him I said well I know that
[2:35:48] you know the Muslims killed bahah Baha
[2:35:51] the founder of of the bah Church in
[2:35:53] Jerusalem I said I don't agree with them
[2:35:54] murdering him he said yes he was a mar
[2:35:56] because the bah believe in what is
[2:35:58] called the evolution of religions so
[2:36:00] they believe in Hinduism the Hindus and
[2:36:02] then the Muslim the Christians and then
[2:36:04] the Muslim and the final Revolution they
[2:36:06] said is a b anyway so I know what they
[2:36:08] believe so I told him I says I says you
[2:36:11] I said Do you believe all the Bible he
[2:36:13] said yes I believe all the Bible I said
[2:36:15] sure to be a good B you have to believe
[2:36:17] all the Bible he say sure he said I
[2:36:19] believe all the
[2:36:21] Bible I says do you believe that the
[2:36:24] fullness of the godhead was in Jesus
[2:36:26] Christ he says no I don't believe that
[2:36:28] of course I know that the B doesn't
[2:36:29] believe that I know that so I says well
[2:36:33] if if I show you a scripture where the
[2:36:36] Bible says that the fullness of the
[2:36:38] garden was in Jesus Christ would you
[2:36:40] accept it he said the Bible doesn't say
[2:36:42] that I says but if the Bible say it
[2:36:45] would you accept accept it he said well
[2:36:47] if the Bible say it he says I will
[2:36:49] accept it he said because the Bible
[2:36:50] doesn't say it I said but if the Bible
[2:36:53] say it would you accept it he said yes
[2:36:55] he said if the Bible said he says I will
[2:36:57] accept it I says give me your word as a
[2:37:01] b that if the Bible said it you will
[2:37:05] accept it he said to me I give you my
[2:37:08] word and I that if the Bible said it I
[2:37:12] would accept it but I didn't wanted to
[2:37:15] take the chance
[2:37:16] I open my bible to Colossians chapter
[2:37:23] 2 and I handed him my Bible because
[2:37:26] brother PA I didn't wanted to take the
[2:37:28] chance I didn't want brother whisper to
[2:37:30] read it because he could said I'm
[2:37:32] reading something into the
[2:37:34] Bible so I wanted him to read it so he
[2:37:37] opened the Bible he began to read where
[2:37:40] the Bible says
[2:37:41] here in Colossians chapter 2 and verse 8
[2:37:45] it says beware I said read it iist read
[2:37:48] it
[2:37:49] loud he said read it loud beware as any
[2:37:52] man SPO you true philosophy and vain
[2:37:54] deceit after the tradition of man after
[2:37:56] the rements of the world and not after
[2:37:58] Christ and then the second verse he said
[2:38:01] be for in him God all the fullness of
[2:38:03] the godhead B and ready right back he
[2:38:06] closed the Bible he looked at me he says
[2:38:09] I know the with you I said I said you
[2:38:13] don't agree with me I said you just read
[2:38:16] it in the Bible he says no no no no no
[2:38:21] no I says you just read it in the Bible
[2:38:25] you read it in the Bible he said if I
[2:38:28] accept it I would have to give up my
[2:38:30] mind I says then give it
[2:38:35] up then you me he says no no
[2:38:40] no he says no no no and out of the
[2:38:43] church he ran saying no no no and some
[2:38:47] of the little children you know they're
[2:38:48] talking at one another to make promises
[2:38:51] and one little kid told you the kid he
[2:38:52] says I don't want your word as a I do
[2:38:55] not want your
[2:38:57] word but that's how human beings
[2:39:01] are this is not just limited to the
[2:39:05] B you see and we go back to that quote
[2:39:08] and until the you take a preacher behind
[2:39:10] the
[2:39:12] prophet he might have a a wonderful
[2:39:14] Ministry yes was say gifts and cording
[2:39:16] of repentance he may have a wonderful
[2:39:18] Ministry to preach but unless that man
[2:39:21] is born again he will
[2:39:25] never agree with the word why doesn't
[2:39:28] why wouldn't he never agree with the
[2:39:29] word because Paul says as an Adam all
[2:39:34] died so in Christ only in Christ in
[2:39:39] Christ will all be
[2:39:41] made will all be
[2:39:44] made
[2:39:47] amen outside of
[2:39:49] Christ there is no
[2:39:51] life outside of Christ we are
[2:39:55] dead you see a church and then in him we
[2:39:59] find our life now as we find our life in
[2:40:03] him we want to come to this point now
[2:40:09] quickly of the
[2:40:12] deception you and I let me read it again
[2:40:15] for
[2:40:17] you all right it's in Titus you can put
[2:40:21] it on the board brother
[2:40:25] Titus
[2:40:29] amen Titus Chapter
[2:40:32] 3 for we ourselves also were sometimes
[2:40:35] foolish
[2:40:37] disobedient let's read it
[2:40:39] together could we read it together no
[2:40:42] it's not brother Ferguson now could we
[2:40:44] read it all together for for we
[2:40:46] ourselves also were sometimes foolish
[2:40:50] disobedient deceive see serving diverse
[2:40:54] lust and Pleasures living in Malice and
[2:40:57] envy hateful and hating one
[2:41:04] another how were you
[2:41:11] deceived now we look at the
[2:41:15] reconciliation of God to reconcile us so
[2:41:19] we're going to go into the message to
[2:41:22] see that when God deals with
[2:41:25] sin there two statements two words in
[2:41:29] the Bible that describe and Jesus speak
[2:41:32] about it how God deals with
[2:41:36] sin are you
[2:41:38] following one of those words is pardon
[2:41:41] or
[2:41:42] forgiveness Jesus speak about it himself
[2:41:47] self in
[2:41:50] Matthew 12 and verse
[2:41:53] 51-32 if we want to look at the
[2:41:56] scriptures quickly all right and here is
[2:42:00] when God calls a
[2:42:02] man the first thing is that God deals
[2:42:04] with the man in Repentance in order to
[2:42:06] forgive him of his
[2:42:08] sins now God forgives you of your sins
[2:42:13] and in Matthew chapter
[2:42:17] 12 are you
[2:42:19] following Matthew chapter
[2:42:21] 12
[2:42:26] here and verse
[2:42:32] 31-32 Jesus
[2:42:34] speaking and he says wherefore I say
[2:42:37] unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy
[2:42:41] shall be forgiven unto men but the
[2:42:43] blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall
[2:42:45] not be forgiven unto
[2:42:47] men and whosoever speaketh a word
[2:42:49] against the son of man it shall be
[2:42:51] forgiven him but whosoever speak it
[2:42:53] against the Holy Ghost it shall not be
[2:42:55] forgiven him neither in this world need
[2:42:57] in the world to come so all there is
[2:43:00] forgiveness for all manner of sins
[2:43:02] except the blasphemy of the Holy Ghost
[2:43:04] we're all aware of
[2:43:05] that but then the Bible also speak Paul
[2:43:09] spoke about it in Romans 5 and verse1 he
[2:43:12] says therefore being justified by faith
[2:43:15] and justification and pardon does not
[2:43:17] mean the same thing now let us look
[2:43:20] quickly at

[2:44:15] Union of the Bride I'm going to read it
[2:44:16] for you but maybe before I read it
[2:44:19] there's something else I wanted to share
[2:44:20] oh God help me

[2:44:25] this morning all right all right that
[2:44:27] the Lord will already help me I wish I
[2:44:29] could have it like brother whisper and
[2:44:32] brother brother Paul Duron I remember
[2:44:35] brother Billy Paul used to say to me he
[2:44:36] said watch him when he begin to get
[2:44:38] those notes and he can't find
[2:44:40] him brother B always used to tease me on
[2:44:43] that one see but um um I I trust it will
[2:44:48] be a help to you now let's look at this
[2:44:51] word
[2:44:53] here forgiveness when God pardons you of
[2:44:56] your sins okay and the word pardon if
[2:45:01] you try to say in hurry what does the
[2:45:03] word pardon means does anyone
[2:45:07] know when God pardon you what does he do
[2:45:09] does anyone
[2:45:12] know huh he forgives you but what is the
[2:45:18] pardon
[2:45:21] huh
[2:45:26] huh no that's justification all right
[2:45:29] I'm going to read it for
[2:45:32] you it's an experience when you go to
[2:45:35] Pardon he says in the message all things
[2:45:37] he all things we can speak of all things
[2:45:39] but all things are house through Christ
[2:45:41] and if he Spar not his own son to bring
[2:45:43] this to us how much more will it will he
[2:45:45] bring it if we willing to receive it now
[2:45:47] I can't speak of all things but I want
[2:45:49] to speak of one certain thing of all
[2:45:51] these things and I think that's an
[2:45:53] important thing that is pardon I love
[2:45:55] the word pardon actually the word
[2:46:00] means don't forget this now a release
[2:46:04] from
[2:46:06] guilt so what is the
[2:46:10] pardon I want to ask you a
[2:46:13] question are there Christians in the
[2:46:15] meeting here that are still feeling
[2:46:19] guilty are you still
[2:46:23] guilty well you're quiet this
[2:46:26] morning are you guilty or aren't you
[2:46:29] guilty guilty not guilty how could you
[2:46:31] be guilty if you're
[2:46:34] pardon all right let's go little further
[2:46:38] actually the word means the Reas some
[2:46:39] guilt now let me share a little
[2:46:42] experience with you let's take our
[2:46:44] brother Geor he's a good friend of mine
[2:46:46] and we love him a
[2:46:47] lot okay come R
[2:46:51] George let's see brother George and I
[2:46:53] have a little fight and brother George
[2:46:56] punched
[2:46:57] me now brother George is bigger than me
[2:47:00] see boy I wouldn't you know that time SP
[2:47:03] a lot of punch in it see yes sir let see
[2:47:07] he punches me and oh my and then he says
[2:47:10] to me but the first would you forgive me
[2:47:12] for it I said yeah said I forgive you
[2:47:14] for it
[2:47:15] I forgive you yes but you
[2:47:18] know you know R George you did it see
[2:47:21] you did it you did it wouldn't do it but
[2:47:24] you brother George you did
[2:47:26] [Laughter]
[2:47:30] it so you're just an example see uh so
[2:47:34] brother bam says but then there's a
[2:47:37] difference because when God forgives you
[2:47:40] he's not just saying sister
[2:47:43] Molly H sister Holly thank you li see
[2:47:48] that's why you know I tell you something
[2:47:50] my wife and my daughters corrects me
[2:47:51] sometime I pronunciation and my little
[2:47:53] daughter my she loves to correct me when
[2:47:56] she was a little girl anytime I make a
[2:47:58] mistake and she would love to just
[2:48:00] correct Daddy when he's wrong to see so
[2:48:03] you know they're just sweethearts and
[2:48:04] Sharon's somewhere in the back too
[2:48:05] Sharon even joined in the freight too
[2:48:06] and she'd correct me sometimes but she's
[2:48:08] a little bit prudent you know when she
[2:48:10] corrects me on my pronunciation but Mama
[2:48:12] lets me know and that's good so let's
[2:48:15] say if God would look at her and you
[2:48:16] would have
[2:48:17] said
[2:48:18] sister
[2:48:20] Holly because of my great love for you I
[2:48:24] forgive you now I could say to brother
[2:48:28] George I forgive you but when God
[2:48:31] forgives it is not just a word it's not
[2:48:35] just you and I reading a Bible I'm
[2:48:37] forgiven it is an experience and brother
[2:48:40] Bram says here and what an experience
[2:48:43] that is to every everyone who has had an
[2:48:47] experience of it to be released from
[2:48:55] yeah how you released then you can say
[2:49:00] Lord oh you can lift your hands could
[2:49:03] you lift your hands this morning and
[2:49:05] said father I thank you I glorify you
[2:49:10] because I have been released from guilt
[2:49:16] all right amen we can go on on that but
[2:49:19] I'm going to spend more time on it but
[2:49:21] then when you really when you pardon
[2:49:22] there something goes with pardon how do
[2:49:23] you know you're pardoned I
[2:49:26] release how do you know you're pardoned
[2:49:28] How Do You Know You released some guilt
[2:49:31] feel it no it's not just that you feel
[2:49:33] it it's more than
[2:49:35] that who knows how you know that how do
[2:49:38] I know that God forgive me of my
[2:49:41] sins
[2:49:43] forgiveness
[2:49:45] yes but he said it to many people and
[2:49:47] they will not to never receive it how do
[2:49:48] you know you receive it accept
[2:49:52] a oh
[2:49:54] my wow all right let me give you the
[2:50:00] answer I W keep you in suspense but
[2:50:02] please church don't forget these things
[2:50:05] amen it's very important because when
[2:50:07] you go before the Lord as you walk as a
[2:50:09] Christians you want to meditate on these
[2:50:10] things do not let these things slip from
[2:50:12] your mind now here there's one more
[2:50:15] thing I like to speak of here in our
[2:50:16] pardon and that is after we receive
[2:50:19] pardon that's in the message all things
[2:50:21] paragraph 126 you could project it on
[2:50:23] the board for us if you could there's
[2:50:25] one more thing I'd like to speak of here
[2:50:27] in our pardon and that is after we
[2:50:31] receive our pardon we receive Purity
[2:50:34] with that pardon that's what that's what
[2:50:37] John says when he says that he is
[2:50:39] faithful to forgive us our sins and to
[2:50:43] cleanse us so brother says now if you
[2:50:46] just making out now he says here that is
[2:50:50] after we receive our pardon we receive
[2:50:52] Purity with that pardon now if you're
[2:50:54] just making out like you got pardoned
[2:50:56] you haven't got Purity now you say how
[2:50:59] can you prove that brother bandam then
[2:51:00] brother manam goes on to express it so
[2:51:03] if you receive pardon and a release from
[2:51:06] guilt how do you know that God has
[2:51:09] farted you is when you are cleansed of
[2:51:13] that sin now if that sin is still in
[2:51:16] your life and you not cleansed from that
[2:51:18] sin you cannot claim pardon because when
[2:51:21] God releases you from guilt there is an
[2:51:24] experience and in that experience of
[2:51:27] being released from sin is
[2:51:31] a purity that's what Peter is saying he
[2:51:35] is faithful enough to to forgive us our
[2:51:37] sins and to cleanse us from all
[2:51:41] unrighteousness so when we claim that
[2:51:44] God God has forgiven us when we claim
[2:51:47] that we have been released from guilt
[2:51:51] which is a wonderful experience then
[2:51:53] without release of guilt is a
[2:51:55] Deliverance is a purity that comes in
[2:51:58] our lives praise God Amen and amen and
[2:52:03] amen and
[2:52:05] amen all right now that is wonderful
[2:52:10] amen and to God we give praise
[2:52:16] honor and thanks for that that God has
[2:52:20] given
[2:52:21] us Purity amen all right but now let's
[2:52:26] take a step we're going to take a step
[2:52:29] further than that because when we get
[2:52:32] into God forgiveness excuse me here I'm
[2:52:36] getting my things mixed up here please
[2:52:38] pray for me that the Lord will help me
[2:52:41] amen when we go into this we go to we
[2:52:44] take another step and I'm going to try
[2:52:46] to finish in a little bit I won't keep
[2:52:47] you too long we take another step and
[2:52:50] that is we go into what we
[2:52:52] call
[2:52:54] justification being justified by
[2:52:58] faith all right let's see what brother
[2:53:00] BR says and then we're going to tie it
[2:53:01] up to show you the deception in a little
[2:53:03] bit are you
[2:53:05] ready all right now let's see here all
[2:53:07] right now we now we have it now you
[2:53:10] remember that the Bible speak about the
[2:53:12] book of life now we're not going to go
[2:53:13] into the book of life it's going to be a
[2:53:14] too long and too you know too deep for
[2:53:16] us to go into now so there's there's one
[2:53:20] book of life the Lamb's Book of Life and
[2:53:23] it has two parts to it yes one part
[2:53:26] contains your natural life before you
[2:53:29] were born
[2:53:30] again see and it's a record The Book of
[2:53:33] Life is a record it's called a book of
[2:53:34] life it's got names in it but it's a
[2:53:36] record it's record so we go here he says
[2:53:39] now your old book is gone with your old
[2:53:41] Unions that's your old book because a
[2:53:42] part of that book names could be
[2:53:44] released could be released from it are
[2:53:46] you following or are you
[2:53:47] sleeping all right so that part is gone
[2:53:50] so now you're going to the new book your
[2:53:52] new life in Christ now he says now your
[2:53:55] name is in your old has been transferred
[2:53:57] now you say do you mean to tell me that
[2:53:59] my old book God put it in the sea of
[2:54:00] forgetfulness you stand perfectly before
[2:54:02] God but bom goes on and on and on I'm
[2:54:05] going to skip some of that he says now
[2:54:07] you are not only
[2:54:10] forgiven brother but
[2:54:13] you're you what let's say it together
[2:54:15] you are Justified and he says here Glory
[2:54:19] justification Romans 51 says yeah Romans
[2:54:22] 51 says therefore being justified by
[2:54:24] faith Look up the word the word doesn't
[2:54:28] mean
[2:54:30] forgiven justification doesn't mean
[2:54:33] forgiven forgiven is a release of
[2:54:37] guilt but justification doesn't mean
[2:54:40] that at all that's right and that is why
[2:54:43] the denominational Church that preach
[2:54:45] forgiveness does not have the revelation
[2:54:47] of justification even when Luther
[2:54:50] preached justification there was still a
[2:54:53] mystery around it and that mystery
[2:54:55] stayed until this
[2:54:59] day and then brother brandham in The
[2:55:01] Invisible Union of the bride and in the
[2:55:03] Rapture message after the open of the
[2:55:06] seals open up to us what justification
[2:55:08] is so he says here he said Look up the
[2:55:11] word justification the word doesn't mean
[2:55:13] forgiven the word means Justified it
[2:55:16] does not mean you're forgiven for
[2:55:18] instance you heard I got drunk and done
[2:55:21] some evil things and everything then you
[2:55:23] come around and say to me you found out
[2:55:24] I didn't do them then you come and say
[2:55:27] brother brandom I forgive you forgive me
[2:55:29] I didn't do it at the first place see
[2:55:31] now if I didn't if I did do it I'm
[2:55:34] guilty you could but you could forgive
[2:55:37] me and I wouldn't and I wouldn't be
[2:55:39] guilty so if you forgive me then I'm not
[2:55:42] I'm I won't be guilty but yet I'm not
[2:55:44] justified because I actually did it so
[2:55:48] if I did something and I'm forgiven I am
[2:55:51] not justified you all understand please
[2:55:54] church it's so important if I did
[2:55:56] something like brother George come and
[2:55:58] he punched me come back come back
[2:56:00] brother
[2:56:02] George all right all right brother
[2:56:04] George I forgive you but he can never be
[2:56:08] justified why because he did it he could
[2:56:11] be forgiven but not justified so if you
[2:56:13] did wrong
[2:56:14] you did wrong in the eyes of God you
[2:56:17] could be forgiven
[2:56:19] but oh Church please got it please all
[2:56:23] right you can be forgiven but you cannot
[2:56:26] Bei all right now listen brother bam
[2:56:29] continues but the word justification is
[2:56:32] though you never did it amen it's not
[2:56:35] even regarded at all how is it done in
[2:56:38] God's book of the sea of forgetfulness
[2:56:40] your old book and marriage is divorced
[2:56:42] and dead it's not even in the memories
[2:56:43] of God Amen you are Justified therefore
[2:56:46] being justified it was accused you were
[2:56:53] accused you were
[2:56:56] accused let's say it
[2:57:00] together let's put ourselves there
[2:57:03] better B says put yourself there I was
[2:57:06] accused but I I never did it so when you
[2:57:13] never did it then you're Justified
[2:57:15] that's right now let's go a little
[2:57:19] further you were accused you never done
[2:57:21] it in the first place the old Union is
[2:57:23] in the sea of God's forgetfulness you
[2:57:25] wasn't married to it to begin with he
[2:57:27] the bridegroom bore your shame I wish we
[2:57:29] had time to go into that to show you
[2:57:31] what happened back there with Eve and
[2:57:32] Adam but we won't have enough time he
[2:57:34] took your place for he was predestinated
[2:57:36] for him to be in his for you were pred
[2:57:38] he took your place where you were
[2:57:39] predestinated for him to be in his bride
[2:57:42] therefore before the foundation of the
[2:57:43] world the Bible say says you were
[2:57:44] predestinated seed all right so you
[2:57:47] didn't do it how come all of this
[2:57:50] happened then brother random goes right
[2:57:52] back now to what Paul is saying he says
[2:57:55] how did you come to do this you were
[2:57:57] deceived into
[2:57:59] it you were
[2:58:07] what you were deceived into
[2:58:10] sin here the prophet goes on you were
[2:58:14] deceived into it by your first marriage
[2:58:16] to your adulterous parent Eve it is no
[2:58:21] fault of your
[2:58:25] own could you raise your hand and give
[2:58:27] God praise for
[2:58:30] [Music]
[2:58:34] thaten by your natural birth you come
[2:58:37] after the thief who committed adultery
[2:58:40] that's the reason you were born an
[2:58:42] adulterer you you a sinner to begin with
[2:58:45] that's right you were deceived into it
[2:58:47] you had no you it ain't your fault you
[2:58:52] never did
[2:58:56] it that's now if we say
[2:59:00] this when God
[2:59:02] determined you never did
[2:59:06] it then God say you
[2:59:09] are but if God says you're forgiven
[2:59:14] then that aspect of the word of God is
[2:59:17] saying you did it and you're guilty
[2:59:21] therefore you're forgiven so the Bible
[2:59:23] deals with these two aspects of God
[2:59:25] dealing with sin you're forgiven you're
[2:59:28] Justified but God forgives
[2:59:33] you are you listening God forgives you
[2:59:38] you forgiven yes sir all right you can
[2:59:40] say Lord I'm forgiven and then what
[2:59:42] happened as he forgives you for what you
[2:59:45] did he justifies you and when he
[2:59:48] justifies you he declares that you never
[2:59:55] did then you say how could it
[3:00:00] be how could it be amen that God could
[3:00:04] say I never did
[3:00:06] it it it has nothing do with you and I I
[3:00:09] would remember you did it yes sir you
[3:00:11] could remember you I did it
[3:00:14] but God says no you didn't do it and
[3:00:18] then when the nature of Jesus Christ
[3:00:20] comes in
[3:00:23] us when as we are
[3:00:26] transformed we are changed we are
[3:00:28] transformed for what we were into the
[3:00:30] nature of Jesus Christ then the Bible in
[3:00:33] the Book of James tell us man could
[3:00:36] justify we can justify one another by
[3:00:39] the works we see God justify you because
[3:00:42] you believe in him I can justify you
[3:00:44] because I see The Works in you and a lot
[3:00:47] of Christians are not justifying one
[3:00:49] another when we supposed to justify
[3:00:52] based on the
[3:00:54] works all right oh my look I I think I'm
[3:00:59] losing you am I am well look the Bible
[3:01:03] says being justified by faith amen and
[3:01:07] then James says we're justified by works
[3:01:12] brother bam says we justify based on the
[3:01:15] fact man justify you based on the fact
[3:01:18] of what he sees one is man justifying
[3:01:21] you the other is God justifying you let
[3:01:24] me give an example
[3:01:25] Amen brother George comes let's take him
[3:01:28] again that's my friend all right let's
[3:01:32] say I say brother George okay I forgive
[3:01:36] you but then I keep you know it's in my
[3:01:40] mind it's in my mind all the time every
[3:01:43] time I
[3:01:45] see oh boy he punched
[3:01:47] me and then one day something happened
[3:01:50] to me I decide now I got to forget about
[3:01:53] all of this Lord help me I forget about
[3:01:55] it I have to see my brothers if he's
[3:01:57] he's he's forgiven he didn't do it
[3:02:00] brother George no brother you made a
[3:02:01] mistake there he didn't mean to do it
[3:02:03] and it was not your fault now he's
[3:02:06] Justified I can justify him brother
[3:02:08] George it was no fault of yours brother
[3:02:11] true brother you know you did it was not
[3:02:13] your fault you made a mistake yes amen
[3:02:16] amen amen and there has to come a time
[3:02:20] when we got to be able to justify one
[3:02:24] [Applause]
[3:02:26] another
[3:02:28] hallelujah
[3:02:30] hallelujah yes sir not just forgive sir
[3:02:36] but yes you said brother Ferguson I
[3:02:40] never thought of that that's in the
[3:02:42] Bible That's in the
[3:02:45] message right
[3:02:48] Aaliyah huh that's my granddaughter see
[3:02:51] right Kisha that's my door see God turns
[3:02:55] around and he he justifies you and then
[3:02:58] you can justify one another amen you
[3:03:00] could even justify a
[3:03:02] pastor by the
[3:03:06] works now if there's no works in the man
[3:03:08] you can't justify him
[3:03:11] right right right you you don't see
[3:03:13] repentance in him you don't see a desire
[3:03:16] to change you can't justify
[3:03:20] him that's good that's good but when you
[3:03:24] see the man that's what the Bible says
[3:03:26] the prophet said it you see the man he
[3:03:30] repent of his sins but B says when he
[3:03:31] comes to the Altar and repent of his
[3:03:33] sins he said if you don't forgive him
[3:03:35] you should go to the altar yourself
[3:03:37] there has to come a time and the church
[3:03:38] has to move forward in the message in
[3:03:41] the revelation of the message
[3:03:46] am and we have little grudges against
[3:03:48] one
[3:03:49] another when we hold these things in our
[3:03:51] hearts yes sir he did it to
[3:03:53] me old brother
[3:03:55] George you he gets up there and say he's
[3:03:58] a Christian he said he love the Lord and
[3:04:01] boy one day he got mad at me and boy he
[3:04:02] smacked me across my face but I forgive
[3:04:04] him you
[3:04:08] know we brother Ram we got to go beyond
[3:04:10] that now amen he came and he made it
[3:04:13] right and by The Works he did I
[3:04:16] according to the scriptures should not
[3:04:18] only forgive him but I should justify
[3:04:21] him why I have to act like God I have to
[3:04:25] follow the footsteps of God where God
[3:04:28] forgive I forgive where God Justified I
[3:04:31] have to step in
[3:04:32] too we canot we canot separate ourselves
[3:04:36] from God in that way in the work of
[3:04:39] redemption God brings us in to us is
[3:04:41] given also the ministry of reconcil
[3:04:43] ilation God brings us into it we have a
[3:04:46] part to play we have a role to play and
[3:04:50] our part is important to God that's why
[3:04:53] Jesus says if you do not forgive your
[3:04:55] heavenly father will not forgive you but
[3:04:58] then we go a step further to not only do
[3:05:00] we forgive we
[3:05:04] [Applause]
[3:05:11] justify do you see it amen
[3:05:14] now the next part of the message I
[3:05:16] cannot go
[3:05:20] into we will not have I shared it with
[3:05:23] the
[3:05:24] ministers and we will not
[3:05:27] have time to
[3:05:29] secret to go into it right Israel we got
[3:05:33] to let you all go it's almost
[3:05:35] 1:00 all
[3:05:37] right
[3:05:42] huh
[3:05:45] well they're going to p on
[3:05:47] me only if you
[3:05:50] say what that part I told them I want to
[3:05:54] stop here the part of the message I
[3:05:56] shared maybe you could share it with
[3:05:58] them on you know the mistakes of the
[3:06:03] Prophet we won't have enough
[3:06:06] time so I need to stop huh right so you
[3:06:11] better come
[3:06:14] so the ministers will probably share it
[3:06:16] with you so I give them that privilege
[3:06:17] right brother Paul all right do you love
[3:06:20] him with all your
[3:06:21] heart now let me ask you
[3:06:23] this we don't want to be like the the
[3:06:26] Dead Sea receiving the waters and not
[3:06:29] given that's
[3:06:30] it it's called The Dead Sea for nothing
[3:06:32] it's not called the Dead Sea for nothing
[3:06:34] it's
[3:06:36] dead so we don't be hearing the meeting
[3:06:38] just receiving that's why Jesus says
[3:06:40] when you pray you know you
[3:06:42] forgive
[3:06:43] and if God justify you what would you
[3:06:45] justifying he said brother fuson I
[3:06:47] didn't realize I could justify my
[3:06:49] brother yeah you
[3:06:50] could say brother George you didn't mean
[3:06:52] it brother you really didn't mean it it
[3:06:54] was not your
[3:06:56] fault you know I heard Christians say
[3:06:58] that when I say that I told myself it's
[3:06:59] so nice for them to say that they talk
[3:07:02] to one another said you know he repented
[3:07:03] he asked me to forgive him and truly
[3:07:04] speaking he did it but you know it was
[3:07:06] not his fault he made a mistake and he
[3:07:08] really didn't mean to do it but Bram
[3:07:09] said you could say that all your life
[3:07:11] Lord God Of Heaven I did not mean to do
[3:07:16] it prise the
[3:07:18] Lorden now there are some things you
[3:07:20] want to forget amen
[3:07:23] amen there's some things you want to
[3:07:25] forget you listen to baseball who won
[3:07:27] and who didn't want for you could forget
[3:07:28] that but these points that you're
[3:07:31] hearing today is important for you
[3:07:33] because they determine your walk with
[3:07:35] God so when you do anything that's not
[3:07:38] right you could come before the Lord and
[3:07:39] say I did not mean to do it why
[3:07:43] because you did not do it wellfully you
[3:07:45] did it because you were deceived into it
[3:07:47] that's the deception that Paul is
[3:07:49] talking
[3:07:52] about you see
[3:07:54] it see and it goes right back to who to
[3:07:58] Eve that's you see a church and you
[3:08:02] could say Lord I didn't mean to do it
[3:08:05] forgive me Father I didn't mean to do it
[3:08:07] the first thing you did you said Lord
[3:08:08] forgive me amen I don't say Lord justify
[3:08:11] me I said Lord forgive me
[3:08:13] and then he forgives me and he makes the
[3:08:16] decision I justify you I ask for
[3:08:18] forgiveness you ask for forgiveness he
[3:08:21] justify now you come to me and says
[3:08:23] brother Ferguson justify me no if
[3:08:25] brother George hit me smack bup in my
[3:08:27] face but brother Ferguson just no he
[3:08:29] said I did it brother Ferguson but I
[3:08:30] didn't mean to do it now brother I
[3:08:32] accept what you say you forgiven by his
[3:08:35] works I justify
[3:08:41] him wonderful isn't he Israel come along
[3:08:45] all right do you love him with all your
[3:08:48] heart isn't he precious oh praise the
[3:08:51] name of the Lord amen you know I've
[3:08:55] asked the church sometimes I said why do
[3:08:57] you all stay quiet in me this said
[3:08:58] brother Ferguson we want to get every
[3:09:00] word with you're saying it's so precious
[3:09:02] and that's why we still are quiet and
[3:09:04] then you know I understand uh God God
[3:09:07] bless you all I want to say this I love
[3:09:08] you all with all my heart and what your
[3:09:11] pastor said this morning means a lot to
[3:09:13] to me and I've been coming among you all
[3:09:15] and it's what I did with veratu in Paris
[3:09:17] you know veratu started off many years
[3:09:18] ago and he was a little
[3:09:20] bashful little Christian boy and I saw
[3:09:23] him back there maybe 35 years ago Chris
[3:09:27] Cross in Paris and he was just a little
[3:09:28] bashful person and he would I met him
[3:09:31] you know and it was very hard in Paris
[3:09:32] at the time no message Church nothing I
[3:09:34] said right at you because I saw that
[3:09:36] Ministry in him I said where at you God
[3:09:38] will use you he said me brother F he
[3:09:40] says I don't think so I said where at
[3:09:42] you God will use you and every time I
[3:09:44] criss cross Paris I went to visit with
[3:09:46] him you know exalted the church helped
[3:09:48] him and his the Lord blessed him and his
[3:09:50] church grew into the largest church in
[3:09:52] all of Europe of the message you see how
[3:09:55] God has blessed him and I look at Israel
[3:09:56] and see you know when Israel was there I
[3:09:58] I encourag him here in tcon Israel I
[3:10:01] want to encourage you you know I could
[3:10:02] see not because he's my son-in-law it
[3:10:04] has nothing to do with the flesh I could
[3:10:05] have seen something that was in in him
[3:10:08] amen I saw that and what I saw now you
[3:10:10] see it manifest in itself and how happy
[3:10:12] I am to come and to see that Amen to see
[3:10:15] a little germ to see that seed as it
[3:10:18] come to flation and it come to full
[3:10:20] manifestation how happy we are as we
[3:10:23] glorify the lord it's not what we are
[3:10:25] it's what he has made us amen what he
[3:10:27] has determined for us to be and we love
[3:10:30] one another with a love that's eternal
[3:10:32] love amen that nothing could ever
[3:10:34] separate that love in our hearts amen
[3:10:37] how wonderful amen because God has given
[3:10:39] us friends you know I could look at like
[3:10:42] I look at brother W but a whisper and I
[3:10:44] could say but a whisper you're my friend
[3:10:46] I could say I choose but a whisper to be
[3:10:47] a friend that's my choice but when God
[3:10:50] brings us his friends then that's a
[3:10:52] friendship for all eternity amen nothing
[3:10:54] going separate us amen that's why when
[3:10:56] the Bible says there's nothing to
[3:10:57] separate us from the love of Christ look
[3:10:59] if I take Israel here is finishing up
[3:11:01] now he's got the love of God I got the
[3:11:03] love of God we love one another what
