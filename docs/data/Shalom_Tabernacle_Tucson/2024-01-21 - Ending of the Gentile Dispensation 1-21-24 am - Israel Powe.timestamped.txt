[2:50] brother
[2:52] brandom
[2:54] now remember don't and don't forget now
[2:58] that he does nothing
[3:00] until he reveals it and don't forget
[3:03] also that he does it in such a simple
[3:06] way that the wise and The Prudent miss
[3:10] it now if you want to mark that down
[3:12] that's Matthew 11:25-26
[3:15] and remember he does nothing till he
[3:18] reveals it and he reveals it in such a
[3:20] way that the smart educated people miss
[3:26] it remember it was wisdom that the world
[3:30] desired instead of the word when the
[3:34] first sin did what it did
[3:37] amen don't forget that
[3:40] now oh how grateful we should
[3:44] be to think that now just look at the
[3:48] things that
[3:49] happens look at the things that he's
[3:52] told us look that you're in this
[3:54] Tabernacle you people that we've been
[3:57] raised up here with now I'm I'm going to
[4:00] ask to tap or go ahead take it but look
[4:04] I'm just going to say this to the
[4:05] Tabernacle people you it's been
[4:08] here I charge any of you in the name of
[4:13] the Lord Jesus the ever to put your
[4:17] finger on one thing of the hundreds of
[4:20] things that's been told before they come
[4:23] to pass and say they did not come to
[4:25] pass amen tell me one time
[4:30] that on the platform out there wherever
[4:33] it was that he ever spoke anything that
[4:37] wasn't perfectly just exactly that way
[4:41] amen prise God how could a human mind be
[4:45] that way certainly
[4:48] not when he appeared down down on the
[4:51] river 33 years ago this coming June in
[4:56] the form of a light you old timers
[4:59] remember that I told you since a little
[5:02] boy that voice and that light and people
[5:06] thought is kind of a little bit off of
[5:07] the head part I would have probably
[5:09] thought the same thing somebody said it
[5:12] but now you don't have to wonder about
[5:14] it
[5:15] now and the church has been wondered
[5:17] since
[5:19] 1933 down the river that day where I was
[5:22] baptized in hundreds of people I
[5:25] remember that may boy told me said
[5:27] you're going down to duck those people
[5:29] Billy Little Jim Mar down here I think
[5:32] he's dead now I think he got killed out
[5:34] there some woman shot him but he he
[5:36] asked me you going down to duck those
[5:38] people I said no sir I'm going to
[5:40] baptize them in the name of our Lord
[5:43] [Music]
[5:45] Jesus and there was a woman going along
[5:48] in the group she said to another woman
[5:51] she said um uh made a remark something
[5:54] about it she said well I wouldn't mind
[5:56] to be duck said that's all right I don't
[5:58] care I said go back and repent you're
[6:01] not fit to be baptized in the name of
[6:03] Jesus
[6:05] Christ This is not nothing to play with
[6:08] it's the gospel of
[6:11] Christ revealed by a
[6:14] commission the word just now if you
[6:17] saying nonsense and foolishness you
[6:19] could have plac it somewhere else but
[6:21] remember it's promised in the word that
[6:24] this would
[6:27] happen and just exact what it would be
[6:30] and here it
[6:32] is then down there that day when it was
[6:35] standing at the river and the angel of
[6:39] the Lord that I told you that it looked
[6:41] like a a star or something in a distance
[6:44] then it got close and told you how the
[6:46] Ember light look and there it come right
[6:49] down on the River where was
[6:53] baptizing when businessman down here in
[6:55] the city said what did that mean I said
[6:57] that wasn't for me that was for you you
[6:59] I
[7:01] believe that was for your sake that God
[7:04] did that to let you know that I'm
[7:06] telling you the truth by being a kid a
[7:08] boy like about 21 years old they they
[7:11] wouldn't believe that you see because
[7:13] it's too much for a kid and then I was
[7:17] thinking brother Roberson here one of
[7:19] our trustees I se here a few minutes ago
[7:21] he was telling me the other day about
[7:23] being in Houston when the picture there
[7:26] was taken that you see and I was uh on
[7:29] that debate I was starting to say
[7:31] something about the other night brother
[7:33] Roy was the only with one more man was
[7:36] the only person in the group that had a
[7:37] recorder one of the oldfashioned wire
[7:39] recorders I see brother Roberson now in
[7:42] his wife so and this Miss Roberson was
[7:46] sick brother Roy was a veteran his legs
[7:49] blowed and Lady mouth were dead he was
[7:52] an officer in the in the Army and a a
[7:56] German 88 hit this tank that he was with
[8:00] and then just killed the man and blo him
[8:02] to pieces and laid him out for dead for
[8:04] a long time and they said he never would
[8:07] walk because both legs was severed the
[8:09] nerves in them and things my he can
[8:12] almost out walk me but what was it there
[8:16] was something that he
[8:19] seen and he went to Houston and he was
[8:22] telling me about his wife and he's got
[8:24] the he's got the wire he's going to fix
[8:26] on a tape and if the services is over
[8:29] here while he's going to play it for you
[8:30] all I hope and on the Old Wire tape
[8:33] there he's got my services H in Houston
[8:37] and then uh his wife he said got her on
[8:40] there and he never noticed it till the
[8:42] other day she was U oh she was so sad
[8:46] she was sick and she wanted to get into
[8:47] the prayer line they never knew me I
[8:50] never seen them in my life so she was
[8:52] sitting at a a window that day looking
[8:56] out and so dreary you know and upset and
[9:00] wishing she could get a prayer carard to
[9:01] get in the line and happen to be that
[9:04] night she got in the line or night after
[9:06] or something I believe the same night
[9:08] and she got in the line and when she got
[9:11] up on the platform the Holy Spirit told
[9:14] her so now you're not from here you're
[9:16] from a city called New Albany and said
[9:20] you were sitting at a window today
[9:22] looking out and all worried about
[9:23] getting a prayer card there it is on the
[9:26] tapee years ago and then at the
[9:29] beginning of the meeting when the Holy
[9:31] Spirit was there that's the first of the
[9:34] meeting was was only having about 3,000
[9:36] people then we went to 8,000 then to
[9:39] about 30,000 so then in the um while I
[9:43] was speaking at the one of the very
[9:44] first meetings I said I don't know why
[9:47] that I'm saying this that's on the tape
[9:50] but it's we are this is going to be one
[9:54] of the highlights of my time something
[9:57] is going to happen during this meeting
[9:59] is going to be greater than anybody's
[10:01] seen yet and it was just about eight or
[10:05] n 10 nights after that when the angel of
[10:08] the Lord appeared before around 30,000
[10:11] people and cut down the picture was
[10:12] taken there it is right now which is
[10:14] copyrighted in Washington DC as the only
[10:17] supernatural being that was ever
[10:19] photographed in the world Amen and I
[10:22] talked about you know saying sometime
[10:25] under the discernment say a person is
[10:27] shadowed to death there's a dark hood of
[10:30] a shadow they're fixing the D and up
[10:33] here at East Pines or Southern Pines I
[10:35] believe it is just when I was there in
[10:37] the last meeting a little lady sitting
[10:39] there and Something Told her take that
[10:41] picture right quick when I speaking to
[10:42] the lady and there it
[10:45] was I think it'll be on the bullet board
[10:47] has been for quite a while there's that
[10:49] dark Hood hanging right over the lady
[10:51] she showed another picture as soon as
[10:53] the Holy Spirit announced it it was gone
[10:55] said you're going to be healed the Lord
[10:57] healed you the cancer is gone
[10:59] there it was and she was healed amen
[11:02] there you are see it just goes to show
[11:05] that God knows what's the time of day it
[11:10] is we don't we just have to obey
[11:14] now we can just keep on talking but
[11:17] let's get down here now just a minute
[11:19] and touch this back seal so we can blend
[11:21] this one in with it now just to review
[11:24] for a few few moments the the other the
[11:27] first seal we noticed in the breaking of
[11:30] the first seal
[11:33] Satan uh has uh a super religious man
[11:40] did you notice that white horsh
[11:43] Rider which they it was thought to be
[11:46] that that was a their early church going
[11:49] for oh my that's been taught through the
[11:53] years but it couldn't be you just watch
[11:56] when the rest of them when they get them
[11:57] all tied together then the supps that
[12:00] now and I don't know what the rest of
[12:02] them's going to be as yet but I know
[12:05] it's got to come just perfectly in there
[12:07] because it's the
[12:09] truth it's the truth that was the
[12:13] hierarchy Church of Rome exactly these
[12:18] people who think that the Jews are the
[12:20] Antichrist there are certainly a million
[12:23] miles off the
[12:24] line you never think the Jews are an
[12:27] antichrist they're were blinded
[12:29] purposely that we might have a way to
[12:31] get in giving us a time of repentance
[12:35] but the Antichrist is a gentile amen
[12:38] certainly is an impersonator amen of the
[12:42] truth anti against now this great
[12:48] Superman oh
[12:51] how uh he become a great man and and
[12:55] then finally was throned and then after
[12:59] Throne he was crowned and now he after
[13:03] that he was worshiped in the Ste of
[13:07] God Amen now look before that ever come
[13:12] I want to ask you something who was that
[13:15] what was that on Paul in 2 Thessalonians
[13:19] 2:3 that said that man would
[13:25] come why did that man look down through
[13:28] the and see it he was God's Prophet
[13:32] certainly why was he said the spirit
[13:35] speaks expressly that in the latter
[13:38] times that they depart from the faith
[13:41] and would give heed to seducing you know
[13:43] what seduce is a seducing spirit in the
[13:47] church that is clergy
[13:51] amen seducing clergy
[13:55] Spirit workings of devils
[14:00] hypocrisies in the
[14:02] church heavy High minded wisdom you see
[14:07] smart
[14:09] intelligent having a f of godliness just
[14:12] go say well we're Christians we should
[14:14] go to church having a form of godliness
[14:16] but denying the revelations the power
[14:19] and the working of the spirit from such
[14:23] turn
[14:24] away now notice he said for this is the
[14:28] sort that will go from house to house
[14:31] and will lead silly women I don't mean
[14:33] Holy Ghost women silly women that's LED
[14:37] away with divers lust divers lust they
[14:40] just like to get in every little thing
[14:42] that they can get into in all kinds of
[14:43] societies and live any way they want to
[14:45] and still we go to church we're just as
[14:47] good as anybody dances parties cut their
[14:50] hair paint dress anything we want to
[14:52] still we're we're Pentecostals we're
[14:54] we're just as good as anybody oh your
[14:55] own Works identify you
[15:02] notice but he said man of reprobate mind
[15:07] concerning truth what is the truth the
[15:09] word is Christ concerning the truth oh
[15:13] you make you you're a woman driver
[15:15] you're a woman hater you do this that no
[15:17] sir that's not right that's a falsehood
[15:22] I do not hate women no sir they're my
[15:25] sisters if they are sisters but the
[15:28] thing uh uh love is corrective if it
[15:31] isn't corrective It Isn't
[15:33] Love if it is then if it's love it's
[15:37] it's a felio love and not AG goppel I
[15:39] tell you that they might have a little
[15:41] felio love for some nice looking lady
[15:43] but a goo love is a different thing
[15:46] that's a love that straightens a thing
[15:48] out and meet God y or somewhere we can
[15:50] live eternally see amen I didn't mean
[15:54] that maybe in the way it sounded but I
[15:56] you know what I hope you understand all
[15:59] right now but remember he said as jambis
[16:02] and jambis with stood
[16:06] Moses so will they amen amen but their
[16:11] Folly was soon made
[16:14] manifest why when Moses was commissioned
[16:18] to do something that seemed
[16:20] radical but he went down there just as
[16:23] honest as he could be and God told him
[16:26] to take this uh step
[16:29] and to throw it down and it would turn
[16:30] to serent and then he did it to show him
[16:33] what it would take place and before
[16:35] Pharaoh he stood out there just as God
[16:37] had commissioned him and throw down his
[16:39] stick and it turned to a serpent and no
[16:42] doubt Pharaoh said a cheap magician
[16:44] trick so he goes and gets his his
[16:47] jambers and jambers said we can do those
[16:49] things too and he threw down the sticks
[16:51] and they become
[16:53] serpents now what could Moses
[16:56] do what was it it was a showing that
[17:00] every genuine thing of God the devil's
[17:03] got an impersonator
[17:05] for they impersonate to throw the people
[17:08] off the track what did Moses do say well
[17:11] I guess I made a mistake I better go
[17:13] back he just stood still for he carried
[17:16] out his commission to the
[17:18] letter then the first thing you know
[17:21] Moses serpent eat up the other one see
[17:24] did you ever think what become of that
[17:25] other
[17:26] serpent where did he go to Moses picked
[17:30] up the stick and went on out with it he
[17:31] worked miracles with it and that serpent
[17:34] was on the inside of this
[17:37] other
[17:40] amen that's wonderful isn't yes sir
[17:44] now
[17:46] Antichrist comes into light
[17:50] gradually I want you to no now when you
[17:54] hear now to my Catholic friends just sit
[17:56] still just a minute
[17:59] and now and then we're going to see
[18:01] where the Protestants where we all are
[18:03] see notice the first church when the
[18:08] Catholic Church says that they were the
[18:10] first original Church they're exactly
[18:16] right they were they began at
[18:20] Pentecost that's where the Catholic
[18:22] Church
[18:24] began now I once didn't hardly believe
[18:26] that I read history and I found out it's
[18:28] right they begin at Pentecost but they
[18:32] begin to drift and you see where they're
[18:34] at and if Pentecost
[18:38] drifts with the speed it's drifting
[18:41] now they won't have to go 2,000 years in
[18:45] a hundred years from now they'll be
[18:47] farther away than the Catholic church
[18:50] is that's
[18:52] right but notice how this white horsh
[18:56] Rider now we just backgrounding a little
[18:58] till he hit this seal now notice the
[19:01] white horse rider when he went out he he
[19:05] serves in three stages the Devil is a
[19:08] appr here the night is in a trinity just
[19:11] like God but it's the same devil all the
[19:14] time Amen in three stages notice the
[19:17] stages in the first stage he come in the
[19:21] Holy Ghost fell and people had
[19:23] everything in common and the spirit of
[19:26] God was upon them and the
[19:28] Apostles uh went from house to house
[19:31] breaking bread with the people and there
[19:33] was great signs and wonders wrought and
[19:36] and then the first thing you know Satan
[19:38] begin to cause a murmur to come up then
[19:41] after a while these slaves and the poor
[19:44] of the land what receed the Holy Ghost
[19:46] they went out into different places
[19:48] testifying they testified to their
[19:50] masters and after a while they begin to
[19:53] come all like Army captains and um and
[19:57] different people people of celebrity
[19:59] begin to see the galloper and the
[20:01] Miracles and signs that these men done
[20:04] so they accepted Christianity well then
[20:08] you see when he embraced Christianity
[20:10] and go down there to a place where
[20:11] they're meeting in a little old dark
[20:13] Dungy Hall and clapping their hands and
[20:15] shouting speaking in tongues and getting
[20:17] messages well he can ever take that to
[20:20] his his uh competitor or whatever it is
[20:23] in his business he never believe it like
[20:25] that certainly not so he's got the to
[20:28] dress it up so they begin to get
[20:30] together and begin to think now we'll
[20:33] Farm something a little different and
[20:35] the Jesus right immediately at the first
[20:39] church age he told him in the second
[20:41] chapter of uh Revelation here I have
[20:45] somewhat against you
[20:48] because these Deeds of the
[20:52] nians nickel conquer the Ley in other
[20:57] words they want to make instead of
[20:58] everybody be one they want to make some
[21:01] holy fell they want to make some kind of
[21:03] a they wanted to pattern and paganism
[21:06] from where they come out and they
[21:07] finally done it now watch first nicadan
[21:12] the nicadan was called in the Bible
[21:15] Antichrist because it was against the
[21:19] original doctrine of Christ and the
[21:24] apostles I don't want to call this man's
[21:26] name he's a great man
[21:29] but I was at his meeting here a few
[21:30] years ago and he knew I was there cuz it
[21:33] shook his hand and he said oh you know
[21:37] we have such today that they call
[21:40] Pentecostals and he said U they they
[21:43] rely upon the book of
[21:45] Acts and he said you see the acts was
[21:47] only scaff work for the
[21:50] church would you imagine a man that
[21:54] studyed the Bible a gallant old man and
[21:57] was study the Bible Way that fellow has
[22:00] and then would make a remark like
[22:02] that it sound it even doesn't sound like
[22:07] the holy spirit is around it's got not
[22:09] to be nowhere because anybody with
[22:11] common understanding would know that the
[22:14] Acts of the Apostles was not Acts of the
[22:17] Apostles it was the acts of the holy
[22:19] spirit in the
[22:21] apostles don't you know how we pattered
[22:23] out in the church ages a them Beast

[1:11:11] sign of thy coming and of the end of the
[1:11:14] world and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:11:18] them deceive for many sh for many shall

[1:12:06] Offray
[1:12:08] another another and many false prophets
[1:12:12] shall rise and shall deceive
[1:12:22] many verse Alto together but he that
[1:12:25] shall endure until the end the same
[1:12:29] shall be saved
[1:12:31] amen verses 1 and two of the same
[1:12:34] chapter I'll read and Jesus went out and
[1:12:36] departed from the temple his disciples
[1:12:38] came to him for to show him the building
[1:12:41] of the temple and Jesus said unto them
[1:12:45] see ye not all these things verily I say
[1:12:48] unto you there shall not be left here
[1:12:51] one stone upon an another that shall not
[1:12:55] be thrown down amen let us pray Lord
[1:13:00] Jesus we ask your blessings on your word
[1:13:02] bless your people we pray in Jesus name
[1:13:07] amen amen you may be
[1:13:10] seated we're just going to speak a
[1:13:12] little bit on the the ending of the
[1:13:15] Gentile
[1:13:16] dispensation we've been talking on it
[1:13:19] the last couple of services on the
[1:13:22] idolatry in the last days that there
[1:13:25] will be this uh idol worship and the
[1:13:29] forced worship and there's always been
[1:13:32] our lord Jesus has given us the warnings
[1:13:35] before as the word of God always warns
[1:13:39] us before the people of God are not
[1:13:41] waiting to get ready she's getting ready
[1:13:45] she's not waiting for the new whatever
[1:13:48] regime the new president to come in and
[1:13:51] then find out how things are going to be
[1:13:53] better this way or that way that's not
[1:13:56] what the believer looks to it's there
[1:13:58] it's part of it we go through the
[1:14:00] motions but we know really what's going
[1:14:02] to take place because the word of God
[1:14:04] warned us of this and we are here
[1:14:07] because we're supposed to be here and
[1:14:10] it's supposed to be exactly what you see
[1:14:13] going on nobody is surprising our Lord
[1:14:17] he knew these things would be here just
[1:14:19] exactly and there there are some
[1:14:21] perilous times I got to be honest with
[1:14:23] you we're seeing things that we've never
[1:14:24] seen before things that will shake
[1:14:28] oldtimers Shake any newcomer it's a
[1:14:32] wonder that anybody would be saved but
[1:14:36] Jesus said for the elect's sake he um he
[1:14:42] would not be
[1:14:43] deceived so the elect cannot be deceived
[1:14:47] but it's going to be so bad and so cold
[1:14:50] and so harsh and so challenging je that
[1:14:54] if you were if you were not elected you
[1:14:56] would be deceived too and it's just that
[1:14:59] simple we think we got it all together
[1:15:02] well he has it all together and he
[1:15:05] included Us in his plan and so we thank
[1:15:08] the Lord for that aren't you glad he
[1:15:10] thought of you without the Lord we could
[1:15:13] we could do nothing we couldn't amen and
[1:15:16] so we certainly couldn't believe him we
[1:15:19] certainly couldn't love him except he
[1:15:21] showed us grace and mercy
[1:15:23] and so we want to go through a couple of
[1:15:26] uh things here this morning and I want
[1:15:29] to First identify to you from the
[1:15:32] scriptures and the message who the enemy
[1:15:35] is who is our great enemy what is his
[1:15:38] plan and tactics what is he doing and
[1:15:41] then how are we supposed to prepare
[1:15:43] ourselves knowing these things Jesus
[1:15:47] told us many times in the scripture I'll
[1:15:50] just go there right now where he
[1:15:54] is talking about how time is at
[1:15:58] hand and in Revelations chap 1 verses 1
[1:16:02] through3 it says the revelation of Jesus
[1:16:05] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[1:16:08] unto his servants things which must
[1:16:11] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[1:16:14] signified by his Angel unto his servant
[1:16:16] John who bear record of the word of God
[1:16:20] and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and
[1:16:23] of all things that he saw blessed is he
[1:16:27] that readeth and they that hear the
[1:16:29] words of this prophecy so you're there's
[1:16:31] a blessing just right
[1:16:34] there and keep those things which are
[1:16:37] written therein for the time is at
[1:16:43] hand Revelations 22: 6 and 7 says he
[1:16:48] said unto me these sayings are faithful
[1:16:51] and true and the Lord god of the Holy
[1:16:54] prophets sent his angels to show unto
[1:16:57] his servants the things which must
[1:17:00] shortly be done behold I come quickly
[1:17:05] blessed is he that keepeth the sayings
[1:17:07] of the prophecy of this book so here our
[1:17:10] Lord is telling us that the time is at
[1:17:12] hand behold I come quickly Revelations
[1:17:16] 2210 says and he said unto me seal not
[1:17:20] the Saints of the prophecy of this book
[1:17:23] for the time is at hand blessed is he
[1:17:28] that readeth and they that hear the
[1:17:30] words of the prophecy and keep those
[1:17:32] things which are written therein for the
[1:17:34] time is at hand so we see this
[1:17:41] time and the doors of the Gentile
[1:17:45] dispensation closing we see there's a
[1:17:48] Time window there you know you have the
[1:17:51] beginning of the day you have the middle
[1:17:54] of the day and you have the ending of
[1:17:56] the day you'll see 5:00 twice 4:00 twice
[1:18:01] and it's good to know which five o'l it
[1:18:03] is is it am or
[1:18:06] p.m. you sleep so deep you'll wake up
[1:18:08] you don't know what time it is you know
[1:18:10] how deep you sleep the only time you
[1:18:13] know what time it is someone like a
[1:18:15] clock or a watch or calendar has to tell
[1:18:18] you what time it is because we've been
[1:18:21] sleeping so deep and some sometimes I
[1:18:23] think we get our time switched up we we
[1:18:27] think that this is the time to be
[1:18:30] building a name for ourselves or a
[1:18:32] career and we've drilled that into our
[1:18:35] children their careers and the love of
[1:18:38] money and success and in this nation in
[1:18:42] this country we do it all the time don't
[1:18:43] worry we know the balance we got the
[1:18:45] balance but really where we all going we
[1:18:49] put all of our energy into success and
[1:18:52] and reading and and uh all of the things
[1:18:56] that the world calls important but one
[1:18:59] of these days the time is going to be at
[1:19:03] hand and the time will be over remember
[1:19:06] brother Billy Paul's dream we shared it
[1:19:08] with you throughout the message here a
[1:19:12] number of times in the
[1:19:14] message what message is it
[1:19:17] in thank you I've been asking that and
[1:19:20] so everybody knows it there's a man that
[1:19:22] can turn on the light and in this dream
[1:19:24] brother Billy Paul says his dad eyes of
[1:19:27] fire and he says that before now in
[1:19:31] daylight Jesus will be here prise God
[1:19:34] the time is over there's not too many
[1:19:37] people can make those claims but a
[1:19:40] prophet can amen Revelations 10 1-7 the
[1:19:43] angel came down and says there'll be
[1:19:45] what no more time no more amen now we
[1:19:49] don't know the time I don't know
[1:19:51] Reverend so and so doesn't know Pastor
[1:19:53] Elder so and so doesn't know even Jesus
[1:19:56] didn't tell the disciples he just gives
[1:19:58] them prophecies and promises that were
[1:20:01] to be fulfilled and it's our job to get
[1:20:04] ready it's our job to take it seriously
[1:20:07] this is a drunken age they drunk on
[1:20:11] whatever it is pleasure and whatever you
[1:20:15] think feels good to you you can change
[1:20:17] the rules of the game they're changing
[1:20:20] it all the time and the world will tell
[1:20:22] tell you what's important and your
[1:20:24] family members will tell you what's
[1:20:26] important but God's word really is the
[1:20:29] one that tells us what is important amen
[1:20:32] and as we look into the word of God the
[1:20:33] word of God identifies who our enemy is
[1:20:37] and I'm I'm just a small
[1:20:40] fry here as a small little voice to
[1:20:44] encourage you to stay ready for the
[1:20:47] coming of the Lord amen things that we
[1:20:50] see going on is not just
[1:20:53] um it's not just um you know things as
[1:20:59] usual I mean the politics and all of the
[1:21:02] different pressures and Powers that's
[1:21:05] trying to get you involved in whatever
[1:21:07] they're talking about out there and get
[1:21:09] you all caught up on your job and sign
[1:21:12] up for this and you know resist this and
[1:21:16] you know stand to get this where you
[1:21:18] know they want you to put this bumper
[1:21:20] sticker on your vehicle or wear some
[1:21:22] t-shirt or some hat of what they talking
[1:21:25] about out there this is what we talking
[1:21:27] about right here the message of the hour
[1:21:30] has come and God's not sending this
[1:21:33] message so we can play games with it no
[1:21:35] sir no sir so let's identify who this
[1:21:38] enemy is this morning just for a few
[1:21:41] moments and then we will let you go is
[1:21:45] all right and
[1:21:48] paragraph 181 in the Feast of the
[1:21:50] trumpets brother brandom says this I
[1:21:53] hope that God opens your eyes to this
[1:21:55] now cuz I realize this is just not
[1:21:58] speaking to this church here this tape
[1:22:02] goes worldwide and I don't mean to hurt
[1:22:04] anybody's feelings but just to tell you
[1:22:06] the truth now the ecclesiastical realm
[1:22:10] has been open from the natural Revival
[1:22:13] of the old Pagan Rome went forth on
[1:22:16] those Jews which has always been their
[1:22:19] enemy the lion with teeth and everything
[1:22:23] it stomped down and broke out the people
[1:22:26] Rome has always been God's enemy and it
[1:22:30] was turned loose In The Same Spirit by
[1:22:34] the dictators of the world because the
[1:22:36] religious system was still holding now
[1:22:40] it's been loosed so here brother banam
[1:22:43] is telling us that Rome has always been
[1:22:47] God's enemy amen another place he says
[1:22:50] that the Rome has always been the enemy
[1:22:52] of the church you say Rome the Roman
[1:22:55] Kingdom and that's politics they don't
[1:22:58] bother you know they had power they
[1:23:00] don't really bother anyone it's you know
[1:23:02] these other things but we'll see that
[1:23:04] they're all connected brother bam
[1:23:06] continues in that same message just up a
[1:23:09] little bit further in paragraph 161 he
[1:23:12] says
[1:23:13] this and notice what happens under the
[1:23:16] six trumpet they were turned loose on
[1:23:19] the Jews the persecution of Jews
[1:23:23] Supernatural Devils nearly 2,000 years
[1:23:27] then loosed by Stalin Hitler upon the
[1:23:31] Jews you say well that isn't Roman it's
[1:23:35] the same spirit amen they done the same
[1:23:39] things they did to the Christians in the
[1:23:42] old Pagan Roman days now watch the
[1:23:46] natural Israel and the spiritual church
[1:23:48] now as we separated here turn loose on
[1:23:52] the Jews you say well the Jews ain't my
[1:23:55] problem the Jews we watch the Jews the
[1:23:58] True Believer does we know the Jews are
[1:24:00] God's people they're God's time piece
[1:24:05] and if people have a problem with the
[1:24:06] Jews they got a problem with God it's
[1:24:09] like if you have a problem with my
[1:24:11] children me and you got issues
[1:24:14] too right those are his
[1:24:17] children amen and you know this these
[1:24:21] little political things that come up and
[1:24:22] they rise up and what's going on and
[1:24:25] this group and that group and we see
[1:24:28] this what the spirit has done when it
[1:24:31] was released upon them in a political
[1:24:34] realm is this little old man a little
[1:24:37] man at off Hitler a German um had was
[1:24:42] wanted to build a superior race and he
[1:24:45] went after them
[1:24:46] Jews and persecuted and the entire world
[1:24:49] saw it and they act like they didn't see
[1:24:52] it
[1:24:53] they laid quiet and we continued on as
[1:24:56] usual and then he started moving and
[1:24:58] taking more property and more land then
[1:25:01] the rest of the world got interested
[1:25:03] same thing with um this other uh Stalin
[1:25:07] brother random says that that Spirit was
[1:25:10] released upon the Jews you go into a
[1:25:13] holocaust museum you see the hatred that
[1:25:16] was one man that put upon another man
[1:25:20] it's it just break your heart to see the
[1:25:23] the maliciousness and the pure hatred
[1:25:27] one man against
[1:25:29] another but that spirit is connected
[1:25:33] with the same enemy that the church has
[1:25:36] as an enemy our enemy has always been
[1:25:40] wrong the prophet identified it for us
[1:25:44] amen let's go a little bit
[1:25:46] further in the
[1:25:49] message conference paragraph 62 1960
[1:25:54] brother bham says this here all right
[1:25:56] now did you notice do you know what the
[1:25:59] name kof means in Russia dirt or clay he
[1:26:03] was heading up them kingdoms you know
[1:26:06] what eisenh har means the head of this
[1:26:09] iron iron and Clay they couldn't mix
[1:26:11] together took his shoe beat it there's
[1:26:14] no mixing together they can't mix they
[1:26:17] wouldn't cleave one to
[1:26:19] another do you see friends the next
[1:26:22] thing left is the stone to be cut out
[1:26:26] the coming of the Lord to roll into this
[1:26:29] image and mash it to pieces and all
[1:26:33] these kingdoms will be ground and blowed
[1:26:37] away like the Sha on The Summer's
[1:26:39] thrashing floor we're at the end time
[1:26:42] brother sister can't you see where we're
[1:26:44] at listen thus saith the Lord
[1:26:50] repent I predict three curtains in the
[1:26:54] name of the Lord there's one called the
[1:26:57] Iron Curtain which will be Russia watch
[1:27:00] Red China that'll be the bamboo curtain
[1:27:03] they're horrible but watch the purple
[1:27:07] curtain that's rising in the United
[1:27:10] States amen and over the world the Roman
[1:27:14] Empire the cruelest of all of them
[1:27:18] remember in the name of the Lord get
[1:27:21] away from it come away from anything
[1:27:25] that's attached to it flee to the Rock
[1:27:29] the coming of the Lord is at hand we
[1:27:33] need a conference I need a conference to
[1:27:36] talk these things over with God the
[1:27:39] church is at the end of her word end of
[1:27:42] her road let us pray now here's a
[1:27:45] Vindicated Prophet crying out from his
[1:27:49] heart to get away from it get away from
[1:27:52] what how do you know what to get away
[1:27:55] from it's the spirit that Roman Spirit
[1:27:59] the denom denominational Spirit a hat
[1:28:03] hatred Spirit a political Spirit they're
[1:28:07] all
[1:28:10] connected and so we have to know who our
[1:28:13] enemy is so that we can know how to
[1:28:17] stand and what to stand against let's go
[1:28:20] a little bit further we remember
[1:28:23] Daniel's um interpretation of the dream
[1:28:28] in Daniel chapter 2 remember the king
[1:28:31] had this great he had an image of of
[1:28:35] gold it was bright and shiny it it lit
[1:28:39] everything up and this dream that he had
[1:28:42] was of the future kingdoms of the
[1:28:45] Gentile
[1:28:47] world and when he woke up from this
[1:28:49] dream it troubled him so much that he
[1:28:52] needed an interpretation but he couldn't
[1:28:54] remember the dream it wouldn't retain to
[1:28:56] him it just troubled him so he called
[1:28:59] his men they couldn't do it and then he
[1:29:02] promised to put them to death if they
[1:29:04] couldn't do it so it was an element that
[1:29:06] needed to be interpreted it and when you
[1:29:09] don't know and then somebody else knows
[1:29:12] the person that does know it raises the
[1:29:14] value of that
[1:29:16] person we don't know what's going on
[1:29:18] everybody's going to die what's going on
[1:29:20] but now God sends the answer and he
[1:29:23] sends it to his Prophet Daniel and
[1:29:27] Daniel Comes To The King and he says I'm
[1:29:29] no better than anyone else but the god
[1:29:31] of heaven will now reveal to the king
[1:29:35] what the future will be I want you to
[1:29:37] notice about this great King
[1:29:40] Nebuchadnezzar you know God put him in
[1:29:42] his place and God allowed him to rise in
[1:29:46] great Authority and power the Bible said
[1:29:48] so God gave him this great great Kingdom
[1:29:52] and all the other nations were under him
[1:29:54] God gave it to him he wasn't a Jew but
[1:29:57] he had several dreams that wasn't the
[1:29:59] only only dream he had other dreams that
[1:30:01] God had give him and Daniel would
[1:30:04] interpret and you see this you know the
[1:30:07] this relationship that God has with
[1:30:09] other people sometimes and we don't
[1:30:11] fully understand it you know like like
[1:30:15] we told you before aimc with with with
[1:30:18] when he took Sarah when God prevented
[1:30:21] him from sinning against him he says
[1:30:24] Lord you know the Integrity of my heart
[1:30:27] in a dream you know that I was and the
[1:30:29] Lord says yeah I know the Integrity of
[1:30:31] your heart that's why I'm revealing to
[1:30:33] you what you need to do so you won't sin
[1:30:36] against me why is God interested in a
[1:30:40] foreign King sinning against him well
[1:30:43] that's God's
[1:30:45] business it's not your business we don't
[1:30:48] know what God is doing and you know what
[1:30:51] when the king come out of all of that he
[1:30:52] went to Abraham he says man what you
[1:30:54] doing he told me that was your sister I
[1:30:57] asked you you lied to
[1:31:00] me you know what Abraham said we knew
[1:31:02] that you didn't fear
[1:31:06] God like how did you know
[1:31:09] that how did you know God didn't speak
[1:31:11] to me by dreams you didn't even ask
[1:31:15] me and so we do the same don't we but
[1:31:19] God has these covenants and
[1:31:21] relationships with other people we don't
[1:31:23] fully understand it but he's got a
[1:31:25] purpose and a plan he gives
[1:31:27] Nebuchadnezzar these series of dreams
[1:31:30] and in this dream he sees the kingdoms
[1:31:33] of the Gentile Kingdom gold and and then
[1:31:36] the second kingdom was silver me and
[1:31:38] Persians Darius and then the brass under
[1:31:42] the Greek Alexander the Great and then
[1:31:45] the last Kingdom would be the Roman
[1:31:49] Kingdom in the dream he SS a Stone come
[1:31:52] out that was cut out of the mountain
[1:31:54] without hands and it smashed the entire
[1:31:58] Gentile Kingdom to powder the dust went
[1:32:02] through and blew it like the shaft and
[1:32:04] there was a mountain that rose that rain
[1:32:07] for Everlasting all of time we know that
[1:32:11] that was Christ brother bam tells us so
[1:32:15] this King sees the beginning and ending
[1:32:19] of the Gentile Kingdom now
[1:32:22] here what the prophet of God says
[1:32:24] here we'll
[1:32:26] go right here for a moment all
[1:32:33] right in the message Mark of the Beast
[1:32:38] 1954 paragraph 125 he says we got two
[1:32:42] things under consideration now watch
[1:32:45] this Beast it had four different
[1:32:48] characters in
[1:32:50] it and if you you'll take Daniel 7 you
[1:32:53] who are marking it down Daniel 7 Daniel
[1:32:56] saw the same vision 800 years before
[1:32:59] this saw the vision he saw those beasts
[1:33:04] separate one from another in the
[1:33:06] beginning of the Gentile ruling and here
[1:33:09] they are John seeing it and the end of
[1:33:13] the Gentile ruling so here brother bam
[1:33:15] is telling us that Daniel and John see
[1:33:19] the same thing when d Daniel sees it
[1:33:22] these beasts are separated when John
[1:33:25] sees it it's a horrible Beast that took
[1:33:28] control and power over everyone but it's
[1:33:30] still the same Beast we just read it for
[1:33:33] you send this message here let me quote
[1:33:35] it for you again the mark of the beast
[1:33:37] 1954 he said if you'll take Daniel
[1:33:42] 7 and um he saw the same vision 800
[1:33:47] years before this and saw the vision
[1:33:49] dropped down he says and here they are
[1:33:51] John seeing it and the end of the
[1:33:54] Gentile ruling all four of those beasts
[1:33:57] represented in one them same old Devils
[1:34:01] demons that possessed each kingdom of
[1:34:04] the Romans down through and the Greeks
[1:34:07] and so forth on down through the Gentile
[1:34:10] dispensation has come right down and all
[1:34:13] met up in one Beast we'll find him
[1:34:16] directly and see who he is all those the
[1:34:20] leper the lion
[1:34:22] and the the dragon how many knows what
[1:34:25] the dragon is the dragon represents
[1:34:29] Rome all right so we know who our enemy
[1:34:34] is right Saints our enemy is
[1:34:38] Rome
[1:34:40] romanism
[1:34:43] denominationalism
[1:34:46] uhhuh all right so this
[1:34:50] Beast now is gathering together his
[1:34:56] subjects and you see this Gathering take
[1:35:00] place with all of the
[1:35:03] darkness that we've never seen before
[1:35:06] it's like everybody now is Under The
[1:35:09] Same Spirit you know it used to be on
[1:35:12] the streets there you hear certain music
[1:35:15] and you can know or I know what the kind
[1:35:17] of people just listen to this
[1:35:19] music y'all ain't going to say nothing
[1:35:21] but it's true you know that kind of
[1:35:24] music it was a strong guitar be a punk
[1:35:26] rocker all right it was rap music it's
[1:35:29] one of the homies right but now they all
[1:35:33] playing the same
[1:35:34] music and they all look the same amen
[1:35:38] and they all dressed the
[1:35:41] same they wear their clothes the
[1:35:44] same and you see this Darkness gathering
[1:35:48] together you see it a a TR tremendous
[1:35:52] coldness on the hearts of the people out
[1:35:55] on the streets there people are just so
[1:35:57] mean now they're gotten harder and
[1:36:01] harder I mean if you can break the ice
[1:36:03] with them then they they'll get to like
[1:36:05] you a little bit but it's harder and
[1:36:07] harder to break the ice you know people
[1:36:10] look at you and they look at you and
[1:36:11] they're ready to
[1:36:13] go I mean we're just buying something at
[1:36:15] Walmart are you ready to go in the
[1:36:17] Walmart we don't even know each other
[1:36:20] what you so mad about
[1:36:22] but that's what the age is is just
[1:36:24] produces this because of what the the
[1:36:26] stuff that they're feeding on Hollywood
[1:36:29] is not producing a love for God in
[1:36:34] righteousness Hollywood is not producing
[1:36:37] you to desire to be at a prayer meeting
[1:36:40] amen the Hollywood is not going to
[1:36:42] encourage you to pick up your
[1:36:45] Bible Hollywood is not going to show you
[1:36:48] what time it is really what time it
[1:36:53] is it's a tremendous
[1:36:56] agenda and we can say it like this every
[1:37:00] law that's being passed today Satan is
[1:37:03] the king he's the prince of every
[1:37:06] government brother bam tells us and
[1:37:09] every law being passed today and every
[1:37:12] single trouble you hear going out there
[1:37:14] is all leading to these prophecies to be
[1:37:18] fulfilled amen we can argue all we want
[1:37:21] to and get red or get all steamed up
[1:37:25] it's going to happen just exactly the
[1:37:27] way the word said it's going to happen
[1:37:29] is that right Saints all right now
[1:37:33] brother brandom says in this message
[1:37:36] here beginning and ending of the Gentile
[1:37:40] dispensation he says this
[1:37:44] here we'll take paragraph number 38 he
[1:37:50] says
[1:37:53] and the Bible said in the last days that
[1:37:55] Satan would go about like a roaring
[1:37:58] lion he's gathering together all of his
[1:38:01] enemies all of his friends are
[1:38:05] enemies and congregating them
[1:38:08] together heaping up under a big head the
[1:38:12] mark of the beast in the ecclesiastical
[1:38:15] realm the confederation of churches all
[1:38:18] in uniting and making themselves a great
[1:38:22] organization the same as
[1:38:25] Catholicism and the world Empires are
[1:38:28] uniting themselves together and forming
[1:38:31] up a big head over there in the
[1:38:34] political Realms called
[1:38:36] communism and the life of God is
[1:38:39] pressing
[1:38:41] on what's Happening the same time to
[1:38:44] make it the Christian Church the Church
[1:38:47] of the Living God is being
[1:38:49] anointed power is coming to her she's
[1:38:53] receiving the holy

[1:39:37] North Healing campaigns are going on
[1:39:40] around the world healing campaigns
[1:39:43] Hallelujah and are receiving the Holy
[1:39:47] Ghost so we see that both the enemy our
[1:39:53] enemy and we the church are both
[1:39:56] receiving
[1:39:57] Powers amen Satan is gathering his dark
[1:40:01] Forces and it's going to get darker and
[1:40:05] darker and darker amen we the true
[1:40:08] church have received the greatest
[1:40:11] message that ever hit the earth don't
[1:40:13] let the devil fool you or discourage you
[1:40:18] that nothing's going on it's going on
[1:40:20] all the time amen if you're in this word
[1:40:23] today you ought to be the most happy and
[1:40:26] grateful person because God is open your
[1:40:29] eyes to what the truth is we know just
[1:40:33] one prophecy we want we know that just
[1:40:35] any kind of gift don't have the
[1:40:37] authority of the word we've seen that
[1:40:40] we've seen signs and wonders and
[1:40:42] miracles take place among denominations
[1:40:45] and people who believe and partly
[1:40:47] believe but for us who are the bride it
[1:40:50] doesn't move us us why because we have
[1:40:53] received this great end time message you
[1:40:57] know he's preaching this in 19 in the
[1:41:00] 50s the early 50s
[1:41:03] 1955 and this great tremendous gift that
[1:41:07] never failed it brought an energy to all
[1:41:11] of the Full Gospel
[1:41:12] churches and they grew in numbers and
[1:41:16] some of them was our great great
[1:41:18] grandparents or great grandparents and
[1:41:20] some family member and somebody got it
[1:41:23] somebody caught it somebody that first
[1:41:26] generation of pastors that caught a
[1:41:28] revelation where there were no message
[1:41:31] churches but they had a revelation they
[1:41:34] didn't have all the tapes they had one
[1:41:37] or two or some but it was
[1:41:40] enough and then the tape Ministry grew
[1:41:43] greater and then they got more and then
[1:41:46] they were able to establish churches and
[1:41:49] now you can go all over the world and
[1:41:51] find what we call a message
[1:41:54] church thank God for it how many you
[1:41:57] know it hasn't always been that way it
[1:42:00] had to grow up into that but the church
[1:42:03] has received a tremendous message of
[1:42:06] this day and Satan has gathered his
[1:42:10] forces his Darkness because light now is
[1:42:14] pushing it it gets darkest just before
[1:42:17] the day break amen Jesus said the day is
[1:42:21] at hand the time is at hand even at the
[1:42:25] door we're not in the beginning of the
[1:42:27] Gentile
[1:42:29] age we're right at the closing of that
[1:42:32] age the door is
[1:42:37] closing like in the days of Noah get
[1:42:40] into the
[1:42:42] ark very simple message didn't need to
[1:42:45] know geometry but geometry was involved
[1:42:49] you didn't know how to build but
[1:42:50] building was involved you didn't need to
[1:42:53] know all the particulars of the species
[1:42:55] of the wood that was the prophet's
[1:42:58] job your job was to follow him amen and
[1:43:04] the door was getting closer to
[1:43:08] closing and as he preached Faithfully
[1:43:11] his message his ministry maybe was in a
[1:43:14] great ministry as others out there but
[1:43:18] it was very unique he's building a boat
[1:43:22] because it's going to rain like it's
[1:43:24] never rained before and he's preaching
[1:43:27] this with
[1:43:28] conviction and he preached it for 10
[1:43:31] years and then 20 years and then 30
[1:43:35] years he's out on the plane there
[1:43:37] somewhere where God told him to build it
[1:43:40] 40 years later the old man still taking
[1:43:43] his same text every Sunday morning but
[1:43:47] he was faithful to the
[1:43:49] message yes
[1:43:51] what was the
[1:43:52] message not look at me what was the
[1:43:56] message he was like get into the ark
[1:43:59] it's going to
[1:44:01] rain and he preached it Faithfully
[1:44:04] didn't he how he's going to give him
[1:44:06] high five when you see
[1:44:09] him I'mma give Noah a high five and Noah
[1:44:13] I've been preaching on you brother God
[1:44:16] bless you he stayed faithful and look at
[1:44:19] his ministry considered a a fair look at
[1:44:22] his ministry who got who were the new
[1:44:25] converts his
[1:44:30] family that's what God gave him he gave
[1:44:32] him his
[1:44:33] family but he stayed faithful when the
[1:44:37] numbers grew around the ark he stayed
[1:44:40] faithful when it got unpopular and they
[1:44:43] left around the ark he stayed faithful
[1:44:46] he stayed faithful and the Animals
[1:44:48] started coming in and hearing it yeah I
[1:44:51] remember the testimony I shared this
[1:44:53] with the group in Phoenix God bless
[1:44:55] brother Ard and the Saints there in
[1:44:57] Phoenix I remember this testimony from
[1:44:59] Brother Chango up
[1:45:02] in he's in the um from the Congo there
[1:45:05] he gave this testimony at brother
[1:45:07] Ferguson's dedication and he was
[1:45:09] responsible for baptizing thousands of
[1:45:12] Believers hundreds of churches this
[1:45:15] precious little brother he came out
[1:45:17] there and he he gave one of his
[1:45:19] testimony he said that
[1:45:21] one Village he went into he wanted to go
[1:45:23] preach and they wouldn't let him into
[1:45:25] the
[1:45:26] village and so they told him he couldn't
[1:45:28] come so they kept him outside of the
[1:45:30] village so what did he do he went
[1:45:31] outside of the village and he started
[1:45:33] preaching to the
[1:45:35] trees and he told the trees to
[1:45:39] repent it's coming the Judgment of God
[1:45:42] is coming he says he says when he pre
[1:45:44] started preaching conviction to the
[1:45:47] trees his voice hit from the trees and
[1:45:50] went over into the
[1:45:52] village and the people heard the message
[1:45:55] and they came out of the village and got
[1:45:58] saved so if they won't hear you go
[1:46:01] preach to a tree
[1:46:03] somewhere preach it to your animals
[1:46:06] preaching to the
[1:46:08] hippopotamus and the giraffe they heard
[1:46:11] it didn't they there's a lot of
[1:46:13] hippopotamus but there was one that was
[1:46:15] doing his thing whatever hippopotamuses
[1:46:17] do and they saw Noah's arguing he like
[1:46:20] H let's move on over
[1:46:24] here break that down for me what you
[1:46:26] where you going we all doing this over
[1:46:28] here another little pig he oink oink
[1:46:31] like what are he doing getting over
[1:46:32] close to the ark and then finally two by
[1:46:35] two they started coming in
[1:46:38] amen that's right where the carcass
[1:46:41] is Heen the Eagles will come where the
[1:46:45] word is preached where the carcass is
[1:46:48] the Eagles will be gathered
[1:46:51] and he stayed with his
[1:46:53] message until finally Noah didn't have
[1:46:57] anything to do with it his family didn't
[1:46:59] have anything to do with it but finally
[1:47:02] one day God closed the
[1:47:04] door sealed them up
[1:47:10] inside nothing can get out nothing can
[1:47:14] get
[1:47:15] in and that's the do that's where we're
[1:47:18] at
[1:47:19] Saints I I don't have anything else to
[1:47:21] tell you I can't cry it out hard enough
[1:47:24] I can't remind you more enough I can't
[1:47:28] tell it you know strong enough of the
[1:47:31] last days that we're living in amen if
[1:47:34] it ever was a time for us to be getting
[1:47:37] our hearts right before God now is that
[1:47:40] time amen and so the Christian church
[1:47:45] has received this glorious message
[1:47:47] hasn't she and this message has gathered
[1:47:52] us and given to us a
[1:47:57] power
[1:47:59] right it's brought us
[1:48:02] together it's the strength that we have
[1:48:07] received as Darkness has gathered the
[1:48:10] light has also gathered can you say
[1:48:13] praise the
[1:48:14] Lord now brother brandom continues
[1:48:17] on he says
[1:48:20] he says that that that uh um that the
[1:48:24] Bible says the last days Satan would go
[1:48:26] about like a roaring lion he's gathering
[1:48:29] together all his enemies all of his
[1:48:32] friends our enemies and congregating
[1:48:35] them together heaping up under a big
[1:48:39] head the mark of the
[1:48:42] beast so brother Adam continues on I go
[1:48:46] a little bit further in the spoken word
[1:48:48] is the Original Seed he says this like
[1:48:51] this here he
[1:48:52] says now he's talking about Billy Graham
[1:48:55] and the three seeds that were planted he
[1:48:57] says Billy Graham May preach everywhere
[1:48:59] Oral Roberts them Godly men may preach
[1:49:01] everywhere the Lord may send me to seow
[1:49:04] some seeds somewhere else some feeli but
[1:49:07] I believe our nation is sold down and I
[1:49:10] believe she's ready for the Harvest
[1:49:13] now when the spirit Falls and there
[1:49:17] becomes a move amongst the people them
[1:49:20] denominations will swing together just
[1:49:23] as certain as I'm standing in the pulpit
[1:49:27] and the Church of God will be ousted and
[1:49:30] they will make it such a racket until
[1:49:33] they'll Confederate it and put a boycott
[1:49:37] on anybody that doesn't belong to them
[1:49:40] Rome will rule the world for just an
[1:49:43] hour she'll rule for a little pce not
[1:49:47] communism
[1:49:48] romanism will rule the world with the
[1:49:51] cooperation of the
[1:49:53] protestantism in a denominational form
[1:49:56] of church which God has rejected that's
[1:50:00] as close as I know the word of
[1:50:05] God how many can hear that warning this
[1:50:08] morning there will be there will be a
[1:50:11] move and there's moves happening all the
[1:50:14] time and now the churches they all look
[1:50:17] the same you used to be able to know
[1:50:20] what a Baptist was but they're all non-
[1:50:23] denominational
[1:50:24] now they all praise and worship is all
[1:50:28] the
[1:50:29] same they've all Blended together they
[1:50:33] have a praise
[1:50:35] team black SE a black ceiling with

[1:51:38] that got to get that
[1:51:40] paper got to pay them
[1:51:42] bills right certainly God gave me this
[1:51:47] job that's why I can't make it to church

[1:51:52] Sunday I'm too blessed I'm too blessed
[1:51:56] brother Warren I'm too blessed to make
[1:51:59] it to
[1:52:01] church y'all got me on something else

[1:52:06] roll them at me I'm talking about the
[1:52:08] word don't get mad at me tell me the
[1:52:12] prophet didn't preach that tell me he
[1:52:14] didn't live it not only did he preach it
[1:52:18] he lived it right before for
[1:52:20] you praise God and I think it's high
[1:52:24] time we take these things very
[1:52:26] serious I think we need to relook our
[1:52:29] service in worship to him amen
[1:52:33] amen the church has received this great
[1:52:36] power that's this message my job is to
[1:52:40] highlight the message to
[1:52:42] you that is so beautiful it's the Mana
[1:52:47] from on high this is why we can sustain
[1:52:51] in such a dark time this is why we're
[1:52:54] still alive because we got food to eat
[1:52:57] in the time of the famine this is why
[1:53:00] we're still here because we reive this
[1:53:03] great message now that we've got this
[1:53:06] great message it's our
[1:53:10] responsibility to lay in the presence of
[1:53:14] it and that's my final Point here this
[1:53:17] morning I want to land on that right
[1:53:19] right there before you can lay in the
[1:53:22] presence you need to receive that
[1:53:25] presence which is called the baptism of
[1:53:28] the Holy
[1:53:29] Ghost every member every brother every
[1:53:34] sister must have it in so much that it
[1:53:38] would change your
[1:53:41] ways I'm not talking about the Holy
[1:53:43] Ghost that just makes you feel good to
[1:53:46] dance and to shout I'm talking about the
[1:53:48] Holy Ghost that will change your
[1:53:51] ways change your
[1:53:53] behavior change your thinking and the
[1:53:56] way you think and process things amen he
[1:54:01] said the Holy Spirit fell down in the
[1:54:03] meeting but if no one was changed then
[1:54:06] Lord help us the true baptism of the
[1:54:09] Holy Ghost will lead you to believe
[1:54:12] every
[1:54:13] word is that right Saints the word of
[1:54:17] your day that Holy Spirit comes to lead
[1:54:22] you to that word and in that word is the
[1:54:25] preparation for the day we know we're at
[1:54:28] the end time we know we're right at the
[1:54:30] door and the door of the Gentile age is
[1:54:34] closing as Jesus says it's even at hand
[1:54:38] in that great warning in MA in Matthew
[1:54:40] chapter 24 he says let no man deceive
[1:54:45] you for many will
[1:54:48] come and say this is Christ or go over
[1:54:51] here in the desert or move go do he says
[1:54:53] believe it
[1:54:54] not remember I told you
[1:54:58] before Jesus
[1:55:00] said so he gives us this warning before
[1:55:03] and then the the prophet delivers this
[1:55:06] message
[1:55:08] remember and we brought it here a couple
[1:55:11] of times that that great persecution
[1:55:13] part of it was forced
[1:55:15] worship and coming against us in these
[1:55:19] doors will be
[1:55:20] closed you know it's it's a quote now
[1:55:25] it's a prophecy now but when it starts
[1:55:27] to be fulfilled we don't even know what
[1:55:29] that looks like I mean we don't know
[1:55:31] what it looks like for the government to
[1:55:33] switch and change on us but they've done
[1:55:36] it
[1:55:37] before you know the the the the Shadrach
[1:55:41] meach and ab bedo had gain um a great
[1:55:46] prestige in that Kingdom they're in a
[1:55:48] foreign land but God raised them up in
[1:55:50] their careers but they kept their
[1:55:53] testimony until one day they wanted
[1:55:55] those boys to bow down in worship an
[1:55:58] image they had already been in good
[1:56:00] graces with the King they had moved up
[1:56:03] because Daniel promoted them as God
[1:56:06] blessed Daniel Daniel blessed his boys
[1:56:10] as we would say his followers they had
[1:56:14] prayer meetings together and Daniel was
[1:56:16] promoted he promoted them too and made
[1:56:18] them princes and then the laws change
[1:56:22] strange they change remember this nation
[1:56:26] it used to be in God we
[1:56:29] trust liberty and justice for all how
[1:56:33] many remember that except for you and
[1:56:36] you and you and liberty and justice for
[1:56:37] all except for that group and that group
[1:56:39] and that group freedom of religion
[1:56:42] remember
[1:56:44] that remember we can we can put our
[1:56:47] thumbs in our lapel and say at least
[1:56:49] we're a Godly
[1:56:55] Nation but you see they turned didn't
[1:56:58] they they turned on
[1:57:01] God and this quote that we read for you
[1:57:04] that the Beast is rising in this country
[1:57:08] and we think it's not associated all of
[1:57:10] these little conflicts and uprisings you
[1:57:14] know the the hoodlums and then the the
[1:57:16] the people that want rights for every
[1:57:18] single thing that's out there they're
[1:57:20] ready to fight over everything and some
[1:57:22] of us even get involved in that they're
[1:57:24] all
[1:57:26] connected all of
[1:57:28] them it's all part of the same grand
[1:57:32] scheme to unite all the dark Forces to
[1:57:36] come against the True
[1:57:38] Believer the laws are going to change on
[1:57:41] us they're going to close these
[1:57:44] doors one
[1:57:46] day and then those of us who really
[1:57:50] enjoy to be here we'll really know what
[1:57:52] it
[1:57:53] means the benefit and the power of
[1:57:56] coming together Jesus said forsake not
[1:58:01] that's right the assembling of yourself
[1:58:04] together don't forsake it and then we
[1:58:07] love that scripture my Ox is in the
[1:58:09] ditch like wait a
[1:58:12] minute that's an exception to a rule you
[1:58:17] can't make that your rule that can't be
[1:58:20] your first response my Ox is in the
[1:58:22] ditch right Jesus gave that example
[1:58:25] didn't he and Luke I was talking with
[1:58:27] the young people about this and Luke he
[1:58:29] says which of you if you had an ox on
[1:58:31] the Sabbath day he fall or an ass he
[1:58:33] fall into a ditch which of you wouldn't
[1:58:35] go straightway deliver him and many of
[1:58:38] us like Bingo got
[1:58:39] it Ox in the ditch
[1:58:42] man can't make it Ox in the ditch well
[1:58:46] you put them in the ditch the age put
[1:58:49] put them in the
[1:58:50] ditch the age opened everything up on
[1:58:55] Sunday first was Monday through Friday
[1:58:58] then they start squeezing out Saturday
[1:59:00] then took Saturday and then they took
[1:59:03] over Sunday
[1:59:09] too y'all coming back
[1:59:12] tonight brother Ike's gonna be speaking
[1:59:14] tonight we look forward to him so you
[1:59:17] get me out of here we have I come I this
[1:59:20] is the truth I think I believe with all
[1:59:22] my heart there's a tremendous warning I
[1:59:25] can't put my finger on it completely but
[1:59:29] I'm still heartbreak heartbroke over
[1:59:31] what happened during covid in those
[1:59:34] years in politics and I saw Believers
[1:59:37] change yes I heard it from some pulpits
[1:59:41] in this message and and me too I failed
[1:59:44] it hurt me and looking back at what
[1:59:46] happened and you think what's coming is
[1:59:49] is going to be worse than what already
[1:59:50] happened put it together Saints amen put
[1:59:54] it
[1:59:56] together
[1:59:58] amen it's the time now to make ready the
[2:00:01] door is closing but what is our job now
[2:00:04] is to lay in the presence of the
[2:00:09] son brother Branham after laboring his
[2:00:12] whole life in delivering this message
[2:00:16] 1,200 plus sermons from the Tabernacle
[2:00:20] all across the United States and even
[2:00:23] other countries it was recorded now he's
[2:00:26] coming look like on the the decline of
[2:00:29] his
[2:00:30] ministry his tape Ministry to the people
[2:00:35] and you'll look at those last few years
[2:00:37] of his message he's not really bringing
[2:00:40] a lot of new
[2:00:42] material he's just bringing you into
[2:00:46] fullness of what God has already done
[2:00:49] he'd already preached the great
[2:00:51] tremendous do serpent seed and the
[2:00:54] original sin and you know the mystery of
[2:00:57] iniquity and denominationalism and he
[2:01:00] preached all that and here he is
[2:01:02] now tying up this final visions and
[2:01:06] bringing those things in here from
[2:01:09] 1964 until God calls him off the scene
[2:01:12] he starts making this statement about
[2:01:15] laying in the presence of the
[2:01:17] son that's the 11th Hour worker message
[2:01:22] that's the message to us the
[2:01:25] believer it's for us we have the message
[2:01:28] it's been gathered it's given to us now
[2:01:30] we got to lay in the presence of that
[2:01:32] message can we look at it just for a
[2:01:35] moment
[2:01:37] 1965 paragraph
[2:01:40] 89 so when you watch nature now we see
[2:01:44] where every age and directly designated
[2:01:47] out there where in the the last age the
[2:01:49] shuck has pulled away we've had 15 years
[2:01:53] nearly 20 now years of the message
[2:01:57] sweeping across from Nation to nation
[2:02:00] and this morning hooked up across this
[2:02:03] nation see no organization it can't
[2:02:06] organize there's nothing ever been like
[2:02:08] it or will be after see the thing that's
[2:02:14] to matter with the message today is
[2:02:17] those who obtain it in their heart
[2:02:19] Hearts must lay in the presence of the
[2:02:21] son to get
[2:02:24] ripened see you can pick up the message
[2:02:27] and then let the sun bake all the
[2:02:30] greenness out of you making matured
[2:02:35] Christians see what I mean God is coming
[2:02:38] soon to receive his church and we must
[2:02:41] have that type of Christians for him to
[2:02:43] receive the wheat has got to get
[2:02:47] ripe look at your neighbor and say get
[2:02:50] ripe I didn't say get right I said get
[2:02:54] ripe get
[2:02:57] ripe get ripe get
[2:03:00] ripe lay in the presence of the
[2:03:04] sun invisible Union paragraph 190 and
[2:03:08] the life comes out of denomination goes
[2:03:10] into the grain then what happens when
[2:03:12] the grain begins to grow to get bigger
[2:03:15] so it can cover over something the
[2:03:18] denomination pulls away from it why
[2:03:20] ain't we got a denomination out of this
[2:03:22] there never will be it's the grain it
[2:03:26] can't go no further farther we're at the
[2:03:29] end time so what does it have to do now
[2:03:31] lay in the presence of the son to be
[2:03:35] ripened that's exact the word to be
[2:03:39] ripened into our your heart to bring
[2:03:43] forth and live what we're talking about
[2:03:46] amen trying to do God a service without
[2:03:48] it being his will paragraph 258 the very
[2:03:51] word Prophet means he is a revealer of
[2:03:53] the word of God the interpretation only
[2:03:56] comes to that that's why today we're in
[2:03:58] such a need of this great person that's
[2:04:00] supposed to be sent to us in the form of
[2:04:03] the Prophet Elijah because it will be
[2:04:06] the revelation of God made known to us
[2:04:09] by
[2:04:10] Vindication showing that it's the day
[2:04:13] and the hour and that's been always will
[2:04:16] be rejected just like the shuck will
[2:04:19] first you'll be accepted because the Shu
[2:04:22] only holds the wheat until it's able to
[2:04:24] get forth to the sun Pentecost will only
[2:04:28] shelter the message given an open door
[2:04:30] until it gets scattered and then the
[2:04:33] shuck will pull away and the wheat will
[2:04:34] lay in the presence of the sun see to
[2:04:37] ripen it won't be any
[2:04:40] denomination just remember brother Jack
[2:04:42] here is a historian many of you here
[2:04:45] there's never been a Revival about 3
[2:04:46] years after Revival they start
[2:04:49] denomination is that right and this last
[2:04:51] great miracle move of God in the last
[2:04:53] days it went 20 years and it's a million
[2:04:57] miles from a denomination going further
[2:05:00] away all the time the Shuck's pulling
[2:05:01] away no cooperation no nothing with it
[2:05:05] always it pulls away from it there can't
[2:05:08] be no more it's a wheat now but we're
[2:05:11] plenty green that's right have to lay in
[2:05:15] the presence of the son to be mellowed
[2:05:20] up that's all of it plenty green we
[2:05:22] haven't got the
[2:05:24] sincerity the sacredness the thing we
[2:05:28] ought to have in our midst to know that
[2:05:31] the spirit of the Living God moving in
[2:05:33] his word and showing us the things
[2:05:38] yet let me move back to one quote that I
[2:05:41] missed back here I want to read this for
[2:05:43] you and brother banam
[2:05:47] says about
[2:05:51] the time that this messenger
[2:05:54] comes when he
[2:05:57] comes that will be the time that the
[2:06:00] door should be
[2:06:04] closing prophet of God makes this
[2:06:06] statement here I want to read it for you
[2:06:08] all
[2:06:09] right how many love the
[2:06:13] Lord all
[2:06:15] right of course we thank the Lord
[2:06:21] for his goodness to us you see I got
[2:06:24] this
[2:06:28] here this just shows us the time that
[2:06:31] we're
[2:06:37] in oh my Lord help me is
[2:06:40] see I want to get this one to you maybe
[2:06:43] it's
[2:06:47] here
[2:06:57] yes the spoken word is the Original Seed
[2:07:01] he says this
[2:07:03] here God is Promised be careful God has
[2:07:07] promised Malachi 4 for this last day and
[2:07:11] Malachi 4 has not yet been fulfilled but
[2:07:14] it must be F fulfilled for it is a gerti
[2:07:18] word of God spoken through Malachi the
[2:07:23] prophet Jesus referred to it it is to be
[2:07:27] just before the coming of Christ the
[2:07:30] second time listen close now all
[2:07:33] scripture that has not been fulfilled
[2:07:36] must be before that time the Bible is to
[2:07:40] be finished to be finished the Gentile
[2:07:43] dispensation is to be finished with the
[2:07:47] church age when this anointed messenger
[2:07:52] arrives of course he'll plant the seed
[2:07:55] of the entire
[2:07:56] Bible excuse me from the serpent seed to
[2:07:59] the messenger in the former Reign then
[2:08:03] he will be rejected by the
[2:08:04] denominational people as his forefather
[2:08:07] John and Elijah as was spoken of Our
[2:08:10] Lord but here the prophet is showing us
[2:08:13] how close the time is that the age
[2:08:16] should be complete and finish when this
[2:08:19] messenger has has arrived has he come
[2:08:23] sure he has come it shows us that we're
[2:08:25] right at the ending the closing of time
[2:08:28] the darkness Gathering and yet light
[2:08:31] Gathering and I believe that this it
[2:08:33] should encourage us Brothers really to
[2:08:37] take our position in the word of God we
[2:08:41] sisters to really take our position in
[2:08:44] the word of God a young man a young
[2:08:46] woman take your position
[2:08:49] in the word of God this is the time
[2:08:53] we've been warned by Jesus the signs the
[2:08:56] Wonders the Miracles and now it's the
[2:09:00] prophet telling us that we need to lay
[2:09:03] in the presence of the son let me read
[2:09:04] two more quotes two three more quotes
[2:09:09] and we will close God's only provided
[2:09:13] place of worship paragraph number 40
[2:09:16] this is November of 65 say I believe the
[2:09:19] church is beginning to hear the message
[2:09:23] and begin to understand but friends
[2:09:26] listen we've got to lay in the presence
[2:09:28] of the sun we got to be
[2:09:31] ripened our faith isn't right
[2:09:35] intellectually we're hearing the message
[2:09:36] that God has give us seeing the signs
[2:09:39] that he showed us and proving it by the
[2:09:41] Bible by the Bible it's there but oh how
[2:09:44] the church needs to lay in his presence
[2:09:47] till it tenders up you know and get
[2:09:50] sweet in the spirit so that it can bathe
[2:09:53] down sometime in speaking the message
[2:09:57] you get harsh have to break it in like
[2:09:59] that because you got to clinch your nail
[2:10:02] to make it hold brother R continues in
[2:10:05] the same message paragraph 285 now
[2:10:07] Church we're teaching
[2:10:10] now drop down to 286 the thing of it is
[2:10:13] just tell the people to come seek the
[2:10:14] Lord Jesus then you yourself lay right
[2:10:17] in his presence just make love to him oh
[2:10:22] Lord Jesus Son of God I love you tender
[2:10:25] My Heart Lord take away all the filth
[2:10:28] and the love of the world and let me
[2:10:31] live holy in this present world before
[2:10:34] you now the word of God is so rich it's
[2:10:38] so deep and compressed and there's many
[2:10:41] great truths in there doctrines
[2:10:45] timelines his historical points and I I
[2:10:49] can't understand it all and I don't
[2:10:50] believe no man understands it all but
[2:10:53] the portion that we do understand I
[2:10:55] believe we all understand this the
[2:10:57] importance of laying in the presence of
[2:11:00] the son the s o n laying in the presence
[2:11:05] of this
[2:11:07] ministry the message of the hour lay
[2:11:11] there and let it mature you lay there
[2:11:14] and let it change your behaviors and
[2:11:17] change your attitude
[2:11:19] God doesn't expect us to memorize the
[2:11:21] whole Bible or even know everything even
[2:11:24] what I spoke this morning there's
[2:11:26] portions of it that some will get we'll
[2:11:29] get more we'll get other portions of it
[2:11:31] the prophet preached it the Bible
[2:11:33] predicts that these things would be here
[2:11:36] but it all wraps up into laying in the
[2:11:39] presence of the son because this is
[2:11:41] where our maturity will begin to ripen
[2:11:44] and It prepares us for the things that
[2:11:47] are to come
[2:11:49] darker days are out there but greater
[2:11:53] lighter days are in here for the
[2:11:57] believer we get stronger that gets more
[2:12:01] wicked they'll finally turn against us
[2:12:04] and the love of many will wax cold
[2:12:06] brother will betray one another you
[2:12:09] can't find trust faithfulness nowhere
[2:12:12] Jesus warned of us us of that and we see
[2:12:15] it today we see it in small forms
[2:12:18] friends you had for many many years
[2:12:21] sometimes that's gone the Lord allows
[2:12:23] all of that but he that endures to the
[2:12:26] end the same shall be saved be
[2:12:30] encouraged Saints take the word of the
[2:12:32] Lord stay in the presence of that word
[2:12:36] in so much that it changes your
[2:12:38] behavior amen God bless you God bless
[2:12:42] you richly let me take one
[2:12:44] more modern events made clear by by
[2:12:49] prophecy oh he says the Shu held it but
[2:12:53] now the Shu pulls away and has to and
[2:12:56] remember 20 years has passed by and no
[2:12:59] denomination has come out of it and it
[2:13:02] won't we are at the end of
[2:13:05] denomination the wheat's taking shape
