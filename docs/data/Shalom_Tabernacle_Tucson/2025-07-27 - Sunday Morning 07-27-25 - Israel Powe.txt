========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Can we all stand? We'll open up a word of prayer for the adult Sunday school. Let's bow our hearts. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're privileged and grateful to be here this morning. Lord, we pray that you would just have your way in every life. everything that would be said and done this day, this place of worship. Father, Lord, we're mindful, Lord, that in the book of Acts, you said there were some more noble than others in that day. Receive the word with all readiness and also searched the scriptures daily to see if those things were. So, let that be our portion, Father. Let that be our attitude and discipline to to do that, Father. Lord, build up a most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, Lord, hearing your word and making it a part of us. Pray for the young children in their class that all would go well for them. You draw them closer also, Lord. And we'll give you all the praise and the glory for it. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask. Amen. We're going to be continuing with Leodysian church age from the book of Revelation chapter 3. verse 14- 22 and we'll be starting at paragraph 129. It be about 20 minutes. Let's sing. We believe. Holy believe. [Music] All things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. [Music] Only believe. You may be seated, brother Brennan. go on back into the in an organization. Don't uh it's the same thing now. That's the same thing taking place in this church is yours. He wants you either hot or cold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't want no lukewarm. That's why Pentecost has got to a lukewarm condition. Now get on the piano once a while, a few drums and bang around a little bit and get enough music. Somebody get kind, you know, kind of saying praise the Lord. Hallelujah. And the music goes downhill. Oh my. This makes God sick of his stomach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; All right. There's not much going on then as a as a red-hot revival going on in them, but they had uh plenty of mechanical machinery in this church. You see, because they was rich and all getting uh together and making big meetings and everything. there's having a good time in this church. That's all true, but it's all mechanical machinery. But no warmth of the Holy Ghost. See, look here at what he said in here. See, I know thy works, thou art neither cold or hot. I would that you were cold or hot. And because you're lukewarm, neither cold or hot, I'll spew thee out of my mouth. See, now he said, I would that you were cold or hot. And because you're not, uh, I just have to get rid of you. That's all. Just sweep you out of my mouth. Now, they had plenty of money. They had great buildings. They had great things going on. But they didn't have no warmth of the Holy Spirit. Oh, they had a m a regime. Oh my. They got a united church together. Boy, they got the biggest buildings they ever had and the things going on, but no Holy Spirit. See, that's what God sent for the church, the Holy Spirit. Now, as we continue on in this 16th verse, they have all kinds of committees. Oh, we got a great regime of that. the old ladies aid society and the the young man's peuckle game and and the bunko game on Friday night and uh the basketball game on Sunday afternoon and oh the baseball game on so and so and oh we just got the the man's chattering society and oh we got all kinds of things I tell you she's loaded down societies and clubs and beatings and whatever but no warmth of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, you got a big regime, but you haven't got nothing there to warm up. &gt;&gt; You're warming up to the world, but not to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That means you're lukewarm. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Boy, you got more members than you ever had. Sure, boy. Well, we get a million more in 44, said the Baptist. But, but what have you got? A big machine. &gt;&gt; Right in the same church where that remark made. They had to dismiss 15 minutes, give the pastor a chance to go outside and all the deacons and all of them smoke and come back in again. My God, &gt;&gt; there you are. &gt;&gt; The Bible plainly condemns that stuff. If you defile this body, the doctors condemn it and says it's full of cancer. Then they'll get on the radio and say, "A thanking man's filter." As Billy Grim said, he's a fool to think that way and think. &gt;&gt; Thinking man's filter. A thinking man wouldn't smoke it at all. &gt;&gt; That's right. It take a second thought. But he tells the women it makes them real skinny, you know, so they can wear some of these new kind of dresses they got. Boy, that sells it. More women smoke cigarettes than there is men now. And a woman will smoke three to one cigarettes to a man. It's exactly right. Course she wants to get thin. She don't realize that's TB and cancer and stuff making her that way. It's baby form coming into her, eating her up like that, killing her. Not a thing can come out of it but evil. That's right. &gt;&gt; See, but it's a thing in man's filter. Oh my. No, no. Oh, they say, "But we have, Brother Brandham, I defy that. We got great meetings." Look what Billy Grims had across the country. Oh, sure. A big regime. Hard evangelist, paid song leaders. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The hard evangelist. Well, how much will you give me if I come hold that revival? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, if you can't produce so many thousand dollars, I won't come at all. &gt;&gt; That's right. And who you going to let lead the singing? Well, you go and hire so and so. He's a great soloist. You hire him to he'll draw half a crowd. He will himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paid soloist, paid evangelist. While it comes to a place that soul saving is a business. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Soul saving is not a business of the church. It's the power of the Holy Ghost in the church. &gt;&gt; Soul saving. You don't buy it with money. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; No. All of it is is works. Works. Works. paid evangelists, paid song leaders, paid choirs, everything else. God don't want that. It's all works. &gt;&gt; God don't want works. He wants the Holy Spirit working in you. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; 17th verse says, "Because thou sayest, I am rich, increased in goods, and have need for nothing. And knowest not that thou art wretched." Oh, knowest not that thou art wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked. Amen. &gt;&gt; They thought they were rich. This Pentecostal and this last age church, they thought and outwardly they were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. They are rich. Just think of the church used to be a few years ago stood out on the corner, cast about from place to place, had a hard time. But now they got some of the biggest buildings there is. You see where the assemblies of God out here? It used to have their place in an ordinary wooding building something like this here and now they're putting up a $6 million bill and they say Jesus coming right away. &gt;&gt; Your works prove that you don't believe that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hypocrisy. &gt;&gt; Building million-doll buildings and things like that and saying Jesus is coming right away. The poor missionaries on the field without shoes on their feet. &gt;&gt; Real God-fearing missionaries. Amen. &gt;&gt; No shoes on their feet and live off of two rations of rice a week. Eat two times a week to pack the gospel through jungles and things like that to take it to their brethren. And we building $6 million buildings in a church with big stained glass windows and everything else and putting it on that. Or you even got so much money as sometimes they got loan associations right in their churches. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Doctor in there to examine their evangelists or their missionaries. And somebody wants to go out to the field, they give him a doctor's examination to see if he the psychiatrist to see if he's all if he's mentally got his IQ's right. You see &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost examines that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't need a psychiatrist. &gt;&gt; But rich, you have need of nothing. Oh, sure. You got plenty of money outwardly plenty rich. have large buildings, stained glass windows, and eloquent preachers. Oh my, I tell you, they're really eloquent. They stand talk all night and say nothing. See, when they come up, I mean, about things they ought to say. See, stand up and some of this stuff talk about a little so and so and miss so and so and you know how it is. Paid singers. That's right. All right. but come into the pull pit. Eloquent preachers if they aren't dressed in a tuxedo suit with a collar turned around and some kind of a frocktail coat on while their congregation feels real embarrassed. And those singers come out there, them women, short bobbed hair like Jezebel, &gt;&gt; enough paint on their face to paint a bar. Soon as you get that robe off, they wear shorts and man's clothes. And the Bible said if a woman puts on a garment pertains to a man it's abomination in his son. &gt;&gt; Walk down the street with her nose up. If it rain you drown him. &gt;&gt; Smart elix arrogant hightempered jazzy bells. &gt;&gt; That's the reason we ain't no revival. It's a big piece of machinery work. Oh might have a voice like an archangel. God will make you answer for that. &gt;&gt; These Elvis Presley's and so forth and Ernie Fords or ever what they call them out. hear these fine voices and use it for the devil. God said, "I'll require that at their hands." &gt;&gt; The reason I respect blind Fanny Crosby, she never sold her gift out to the world. She kept it with God. &gt;&gt; Many of these people are eloquent singers, eloquent man, great man, and so forth. Instead of using her talent for God, the devil's perverted them. They're over there working for him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Personalities, radio, television personalities selling their stuff out out there for the world instead of giving it to God. &gt;&gt; Some of them come to church, go to church, wear a big fine robe, come out there and sing like that, go right back and sing rock and roll the next night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Such as singers that we know belong to certain churches. Get out there and make them pictures and movie pictures. Get out there and sing rock and rolls. The kings of rock and roll and claim to be religious. It's a trick of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One man had enough enough good common sense up here that said he's going to be a preacher. Get on Sunday morning and preach and he go down there on and get on the radio broadcast and sing rock and roll songs and everything like finally took a pistol his brains out. I respect the man for doing it. That's right. That's right. He had more he had as much sense as them hogs did anyhow. When they got the devil in them, they run down the water and choke. Some people don't even have that much. I know you I hate to be that hard, but brother, sister, you got you got to bow the thing down and make it a fit man. This is the day that we're living. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I guess that Jesus called Herod an old fox and John called him a generation of vipers. All right. &gt;&gt; They have large buildings, stained glass windows, eloquent preachers, paid singers. Yes, sir. What have they got in it? What's in it? Nothing of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Stand up there and go out and wear shorts and come in and sing in the choir. You miserable hypocrite. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And you preacher that'll go to a meeting because they give you more money than they do at some other place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're not a fit to be in a pulpit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Money. If you can't appropriate so many thousand dollars, well, we can't come. our our our managers and things will come around. If you can get up the money, we'll come. If I can't get full cooperation with everybody, I won't come. If everybody don't fully cooperate, all the churches so I have plenty of money to make my debts meet, I won't come, brother. A real man of God, the Holy Ghost, let him eat soda crackers and drink branch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's a real servant of God. But people tie themselves up with broadcast and radio and television, all kinds of things the world. So they got to have that kind of money. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly right. See, &gt;&gt; that ain't God. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, you're rich have need of nothing." Sure. But the very thing you had need of, you didn't have, &gt;&gt; but you didn't know it. See, rich have need of nothing. Paid to do the things that they're doing. Card playing. Oh, you say we got big congregations. Oh, sure. Yes, sir. Vegas congregation. Well, you know, the mayor of the city comes to our church. That's right. Well, you know, so and so when they come to town, they come to our church. We have all the celebrity in our church. Yes. And let the poor, sainted, needy come into the church and they're rebuked to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't even want them there. You're afraid somebody say amen while you're preaching. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. like a little lady I've read one time and a little book up here. She'd come into a church of her children, she'd raised them in an oldfashioned church back in the woods somewhere where they were really godly. So the a young fellow come in one day and married the girl, said he belonged to the outside church, you know, one of the big churches of the same denomination out in the city. So he told the mother he was a Christian, so he married the daughter and take her out. Well, finally he got her weaned off from the little country church back in the mountains to out here in this great big fine church. Same name, but back there they had the Holy Ghost out here. They had nothing. So then when they come in this great big fine church. So mother said one day she was coming down to to see her daughter. Well, they wondered what in the world they do with her. So when she come down, she looked like something out of a relic book. one of them little high neck dresses, you know, and long sleeves and her hair peeled back. Her onion face stick like that peeled back, you know, she come down. She says, "Well, hallelujah, honey. How y'all getting along?" Well, she said, "Now in the morning, Sunday said, y'all going to meeting a husband said, "What will we do with her?" Said, "We can't take her over there like that." And said, "Well, I don't know what to do." Well, I said, "Mother, I tell you, we Oh," she said, "But honey, I could have stayed out of church. Surely there's a certain search certain church down here. Oh, she he said so said I seen over on the corner there. I'll just go over. And he said, "Oh, well, we'll just have to do it." So when they went in, they let her go in first. Shamed of her. &gt;&gt; Here she come across the street, that little skirt, you know, the Bible under her arm. A brother, she might not had her name in who's who, &gt;&gt; but I imagine she had her name on the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; That was the name. When she walked in the church, she sat down back there, took her seats on, opened up the Bible, and she be to read, and everybody be to look around. Thought some kind of an antique had dropped out somewhere. Looking over like that, oh my, with all their fine clothes on, you know, the typical lady of seeing and their fine dresses and so forth. Looked back, seen his little mother sitting there, big smile on her face, you know, reading the Bible. Yeah. And the pastor, after a while, after got through all the other things, he finally had about 15 minutes to talk. So he got up and he said, "The Lord is good." She said, "Praise God. That's right. Hallelujah." And everybody stretched their neck like a gander. Look around. Who was it? And after a while, he said, he said, "Christians in every age should be violent, great, fine Christians or something on that order." She said, "Praise God, that's right." And you all looked around. looked over to his deacon board and the deacon board got the audi goes back and takes a little woman with the army and walks her out the door said you're interrupting the pastor [Music] &gt;&gt; you're dead and don't know it &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; oh watch your stained glass windows going to mount to &gt;&gt; watch your fine plush pews and watch all your big congregation going straight to hell as a Martin to its or if you don't have the spirit of God, you're lost. &gt;&gt; Unless you're born again, you cannot see the kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's bitter. It's like I used to take castor oil. I said, "Mama, I can't even stand it." She said, "If it don't make you sick, it don't do you no good." So, I guess that's about the way this do. &gt;&gt; Oh, if you would speak to them. Oh, uh, big fine buildings and so forth. Oh, they they uh they you go to church. You have to say go to church and say, "Well, I tell you, you are Pentecostal." Oh, yes. Sure. We're Pentecostal. You believe been born again? Yes. Well, I want to show you something. Oh, look at this building. You know how much this building cost? That cost three quarters of a million dollars to put this up. You know, we used to didn't have it that way. We We used to be down there at the alley. Mhm. And they look around, you find out all these great things that they got. Yes, sir. And then they say, "Oh, we we got all these big things." But they have no burden for lost souls. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They always want to show you how much filling they got. Look at our Sunday school record. How big it is. What good does that do to you? They have not the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Rich increased in goods. &gt;&gt; Have nothing. That's what he said. You think that but don't know that you're poor, wretched, miserable, blind, &gt;&gt; naked, and don't know it. See, &gt;&gt; that's it. Oh, sure. They say, "You know what? We used to be the little church we used to use is in the back part. This is the big one now." And I'll tell you, no burden for souls, but they got to see that all these things are taken care of. The ladies aid and all these other things all has to be taken care of, but no burden for lost souls. &gt;&gt; Amen. What this church has got into, they were not burdened for souls, but they were burdened with wealth. &gt;&gt; That's right. They had the wrong burden. &gt;&gt; They had a burden for their wealth, but not a burden for lost souls. The scripture said, "You didn't know that they were wretched. Oh, miserable, blind." They think that they could take money and convert the world. Oh, if we could just get a program on that we could get a lot of money here, I believe we could go convert the world. If some of the rich people in our church, brother Brandon, if we could just get them to dig out and I believe that we could start a society that would um that would go around and and convert the world. We could take airplanes and drop literature all over Africa and things like that. If we just had some money, brother, the world, it won't be converted by money. &gt;&gt; The world will be converted by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Powerful preaching of the Holy Ghost and the cross will be the only thing that'll convert the world. &gt;&gt; God's program is not money. It's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what God's program is for the lady of church age or any other church age. Yes, sir. They want the Holy Ghost. Oh, they say we are have gold. It was gold. All right. But not the right kind. They had plenty of gold but not the right kind. Now, so they were commanded by Jesus, I know you have rich and have gold and have need of nothing, but I counsel thee to come by of me. Gold tried in the fire, a different kind of gold. Yeah. A gold that's tried in the fiery furnace, that went through the fire of death, that went through Calvary, come out. A lot of this gold you got now is tarnish you. It'll caner. It'll rust. If you can mark down this James St. James 5 1-4 and you'll get what it is. Say, "Go ye you rich man now at the coming of the Lord. Weep and howl for your miseries has come up for you on your goals cankered in you." See, that's the kind of gold that caners. But the goal that Jesus gives is the Holy Spirit. The golden oil of the spirit pours into your heart and and oh my house of you come buy me gold if you want get rich. Oh yes. Also, they were blind. Now, that's a bad way to be. I don't think these Christians were so blind as he was nearsighted. Hallelujah. I believe they were nearsighted. The only thing they could look at was their big buildings. Only thing they could look at was their big congregation. Only thing they look at was a well carnished choir with all its big robes and things. I think they were just nearsighted. They couldn't see over their nose hardly. I don't think they were blind. They were just nearsighted. All they could see was their what? You know what? We belong to the so and so. They're big denominations, their big crowds, many members, their Sunday school, their fine buildings. But they had need of the Holy Ghost. Jesus said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; They needed the Holy Ghost. So the Lord said to them, I if you are eyes are so bad and you're so nearsighted, you can't see nothing but your big building here and your big fine congregation and you're the mayor of the city and all coming to your church, you got the celebrity and you forgot me. But if you are that blind and your eyes is that sort, I'll say some eyes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, it's strange them doctors of divinity didn't have any of that, isn't it? Amen. &gt;&gt; They had a lot of perfume &gt;&gt; and a lot of theology, &gt;&gt; but they needed eyesight. &gt;&gt; All right. God's Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; to massage. Let them look for the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let them look at the Bible. Let them look at the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They know how to say, "Amen." Just exactly right. &gt;&gt; They had the perfume. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They had all the ointments, &gt;&gt; but they needed eye savage. said you need a little sab to go on your eyes. It'll open them up. [Music] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Glory. [Music] Good morning. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Good night. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Good day. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat.

You knew everything so great. There is no one else like you. [Music] There is no one else. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I just think what he did for me, what he's done in my life, &gt;&gt; that is a miracle that's so great. &gt;&gt; I think we can all say that this morning. Lord, you've done miracles so great. &gt;&gt; You brought me out of the miry clay. &gt;&gt; You loved me when I was unlovable. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to do anything else for me. He's worthy of my praise throughout eternity just for what he's done. &gt;&gt; Brother Ezekiel, would you come this morning? So good to see you. I know you were traveling for a bit and we missed you. miss the little spark that you and your family bring. And we just thank God for a safe return. Amen. Want to welcome my mother-in-law. She's now in Tucson again. So, sister Chris has moved here as of yesterday. So, Amen. Just expect to be seeing her a little more often, three times a week. So, Amen. Amen. Thank you for your prayers. Amen. It's not the same, you know, when you're missing church. Just I don't know. I just I was telling the church up there, you feel like backsliding, you know, I just miss you so much and just uh it's just different, you know, to be all together and this with the same expectations, you know. &gt;&gt; We want to receive something from God and from his spirit and from his word. Just like let's just pray all together and just welcome the Holy Spirit this morning. Precious heavenly father, we love you so much, heavenly father. Father, we thank you, Lord, for having us all together, Lord, with the same expectations. Lord, we just want more and more of you, Lord Jesus. Give us everything you have for us this morning, Lord.

Father, help us, Lord, to receive you this morning, Father. Help us, Lord. Let us create, Lord, that atmosphere, Lord, where you can come down in a mighty way. Heavenly Father, Father, we pledge this place the service into your precious holy hands, Lord, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Just want to sing of course before we're seated. Longing for Jesus. Just thinking of that this week where you know you we have friends, we have family in this life that we get away from him for a while and we just we want to be around him again. Maybe maybe some of us in our marriage, we can look back and say there were times where we just could not wait to see that person. And you know, hopefully it's still that way, but you know, there we certainly can remember when we first fell in love and we just wanted to be with that person and that's just all we cared about is what what can we do? And sometimes it's just you don't need to talk. It's just just being around them, just feeling their presence. And I think, you know, that's the way God wants us to be with him. and and from his vantage point, how often does he look down and see us where that's our desire is just Lord, I have a longing in my heart for you. Just to be near you, just to feel your presence. So, he's here this morning. Let's make him feel welcome with our praise. I'ming [Music] longing for Jesus. [Music] I have a long in my heart for him. Just to be near him, just to feel his presence. I have a long in my heart for him. Yes, I am. I'm longing for you, Jesus. [Music] I have I long in my heart for him. Just to be near him and to feel his presence. I have a glory in my heart. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated this morning and I can tell you I just was rejoicing in the back right before I came out. Sister Lorie Snow come in. It was It was so good to see her. What a wonderful treat. &gt;&gt; We sang that song earlier. He is great. He does miracles so great. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So good to have you here, Lord. And we sure miss you. And we know that he who started the work is going to be faithful to complete it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And his own good time. He knows what's best for us. He knows why we go through the trials we do. But it's so good to be with you again and just to see your smiling face. Looking forward to some of those cheesecakes again as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is so good. &gt;&gt; You ask me why I'm happy.

As the brothers come up for the prayer request and for the offering, just want to share a little testimony with you. something that Joy and I were listening to last night. And then we just want to sing a song before before your brother's come. Just wait just a minute. We just want to sing a song before. Sorry I wasn't clear on that. But Joy was playing a little um a little video of a testimony by Corey Tenboom, which I think about all of you have have heard of Corey Tenboom, concentration camps, the story of the hiding place. And um they were interviewing her and she was just saying one of one of the periods that she remembered she was put in solitary confinement for a while. I think it was about three months of solitary confinement and she was just like Lord I just I need somebody and you know just this is this is almost more than I can bear. And the next day a little aunt comes walking in the in in the cell the room with her there. I said, "Well, it's it's some company." And she just observed the ant a little bit, talked to the ant and and and visited with it and and you just just talking and and she noticed that every time the ant got scared or sensed there was trouble or danger, it went into a little hole in the wall. I said, "Oh, you have a little hiding place you go to." And she she's like, you know, I I need a hiding place. And she felt God just speak to her and said, I'm your hiding place. &gt;&gt; And I just wanted to sing this song. Lord, you are my hiding place. The words to this are just so beautiful. You always fill my heart with songs of deliverance. Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just sing this before the brothers come on. You are my hiding place. You are always hallelujah. Songs of deliverance. How many can say, "Lord, whenever I'm afraid, I'm going to put my trust in you. I will trust in you. I will trust in you. Let the weak say. &gt;&gt; Through him we can say I am strong. In the strength of the Lord I will trust in. You are my high. [Music] You always fill my heart with songs of deliverance. Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in you. [Music] I will trust in you. Let the weak say I am strong in the strength of my Lord. I will trust you. [Music] Now we could stand the brothers. Thank you for your eagerness to help earlier. Sure appreciate our brother Joe. Let's remember brother Joe Robson and and his family as they continue their trip up to Canada. And they'll be a blessing wherever they are. And the rest that are that are traveling that are on the road and brother Ben I don't know which one of you has the request this morning.

You can be seated and let's just let the musicians continue to play that as your pastor comes. Peace of God, just cover me this morning. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Amen. God bless you. Let's pray. Dear Lord Jesus, Thank you for bringing us together once again as we come to this portion of the service. Pray that the great Holy Spirit would move upon us now and bless every heart. We pray we love you, Father. Um we look to you to give us what we have need of in our life. And we don't look to a man. We don't look to one another. But we look to you. We look to the hills from which cometh our help. Our help comes from the Lord. And Lord, every one hearer needs your help. &gt;&gt; And that's coming from you today. Now may we receive it today. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. &gt;&gt; So good to be in the house of the Lord with you this morning. Welcome you to the house of the Lord. Amen. How many's happy to be here? bless you. It's really nice to be here. So nice to see Sister Lori in the back there. I bless her richly and we thank the Lord that um he's in control of everything. &gt;&gt; We don't know what a day we don't know what a day may hold. But we know that he holds it all. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we just find a way to lift our hands and praise him, &gt;&gt; we can praise him through the storm &gt;&gt; and praise him through our great victories and his our future is in his hands. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we welcome each of you. So happy to be here with you this morning. This evening we have a good friend of the ministry here. Brother uh Robert Figareroa will be speaking for us this evening. as brother Bobby's daddy there'll be ministering for us and brother Robert means so much to me. just have a unique friendship and um it's a wonder I don't call on him more but it seems like the men's prayer breakfastes he's always been available for the last few years to minister for us for the prayer breakfast and we were fellowshipping and they don't have an evening service so I told him to come on over and let us pull on you and squeeze it all out of you &gt;&gt; and so we're going to come expecting and I always receive something from brother Robert when he ministers. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we'll be uh ready for that and thank the Lord for those that are in gathering in Phoenix today. We trust the Lord will bless them and um give them what they have need of. And we're getting a little late start but um but it's never too late to get through what the Lord has placed upon our hearts. &gt;&gt; And so with any service, it's Lord, what do you want to do? And sometimes we have our schedule, but we want the Lord's schedule, don't we? &gt;&gt; We want what he has for us. Amen. So, let's stand to our feet and we'll turn into scripture. Mark chapter 13 verse number 34. We've been waiting for mom to get moved down and she's here. So, we're so happy to have her. God bless her. &gt;&gt; Mark 13:34. For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. Watch ye therefore, for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at evening, or at midnight, or at the crowing, or in the morning, lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And what I say unto you, I say unto all. Watch. Amen. Let's take one more scripture in Romans. Let's take Galatians chapter 4 and then I'll have you seated. Galatians chapter 4 verse number 1 and two. Now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differereth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all. but is under tutorers and governors until the time appointed of the father. Let us let us let us pray. Lord Jesus, we ask your blessing on this portion of the word that we read tonight uh this morning rather and we ask that you would bless it to our heart, our hearing, to our understanding, open it up. Lord, there's no way that we can learn anything if you don't give it to us. And Lord, may we not be distracted by anything other than you. May you possess and attain our full attention for these few moments, Lord. And may the Holy Spirit write down the notes in our spirit that we need to leave the service with, Lord, that we can meditate on it and really embrace what the spirit is trying to say to the church. Bless the little ones, even the youngest one among us. Bless the oldest one, even the elder, the oldest one among us, Lord. And every heart, may they receive their portion from you is our prayer. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. May be seated. We've been talking on the orders of adoption or the orders of being placed. really we all have received some orders for placement to find our place and um in this portion we are going to talk a little bit more about the authority that's been given to the servants for the son of man is as a man taken a far journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants. Good to see you Doug. Happy to see you again. He was missing for a few months and he called me &gt;&gt; three months &gt;&gt; for three months. He was missing and he was trying to he was in a little trouble and he was trying to remember my number. He had most of it but one or two digits. And then he finally uh got out of that situation and he called me and he said he's going to be in church. And then he uh his family came together to help him move from where he was. He said he started to think uh what the Lord has done for him and he prayed and he asked the Lord to um deliver him from the negative influences in his life. And so we join with you, Doug, that the Lord will raise you up out of that. Amen. So this authority given to servants, this is a man taken a four for our journey. And um this authority, how does it work? You know, I when you go into the courthouse and you walk into that building where lawyers and victims and criminals and um there's attorneys that are there, it it just the whole atmosphere is you know that somebody's in control. You can't just run up to the front in a courthouse. I'm talking about you can't just stand up and start talking when you feel like talking. There's an order to it &gt;&gt; because somebody there has the authority to keep that little jurisdiction moving a certain way. Now that same judge, he would be the supreme authority of his court and everybody respects him. He can't be addressed by his first name or hey man or hey what's up and you're talking all that language. You might that's might be how you talk in the streets but when you come to court your attorney will tell you you can't come in here talking like that. &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's an authority that that courthouse possesses and that judge is the one that's ruling that little space for that little time. Now, you might see that judge in the Walmart or getting gas or wherever you might see him in public. He doesn't possess that same authority. But in his courtroom and you come into those doors there, it that authority has been given to him to use it and exercise it properly. You know, as I was thinking on this, going deeper in my mind and my thoughts and just thinking what the message is trying to bring us to and um one of the friends of mine, he um he um that I went to high school with, he's a twin. Him and his sister were the same age and she just recently died. And so a group of my other friends went to this funeral and um they told me Israel at the funeral, it was so embarrassing how he said the minister got up and spoke and he did a good job and he spoke on some things that were very good, but then they gave that few moments for 10 people to speak and then like 15 people got up and as the people got up and the different ones come up behind the pull pit and start sharing stories and cursing and swearing and just the disrespect that they weren't taught. And so these two friends of mine were grieved by that. And so we were talking about how, you know, it it was it was the it was the responsibility of the elder, deacon, whoever that was running that to stop that first that first action of cursing and bad language just to stop the service and put it in check. That that would be his job to do that. It might be uncomfortable. It might be embarrassing. We might even know who he is talking about, but it was necessary be just like a police officer. You're sitting in the doughnut place eating with him and chopping up. Okay, not donuts because we always tease police with donuts, but we're at the McDonald's eating and we're just chopping it up and he's a police and I'm there and I break out and start breaking the law. You know what he's going to have to do? He's going to have to stop eating and arrest me. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; If he's really if he's really a real police officer &gt;&gt; now, if he's if he's if he's the fly by night, if he's not a real police officer, he'll just let it go, turn his eye. But a real police officer will break up the uncomfortable of the nice smooth and stop it. Hey, look, man. I got put your hands behind your back. You got to go with me today. And this is how authority works. The authority has been given. And the prophet of God tells us that the Jews were taught that laying on of hands was the way to get their requests answered from the Lord. But the Gentile was taught authority. &gt;&gt; Who was a gentile? He was a Roman. Who was this centurion? He's a man over a hundred other men. And this is uh what brother Brandham says in the message. I'm going to go back and read a couple places from last week. And he says this here. Of course, he talks about how the church doesn't know their authority, but he says he's trying to get the people to believe in the gentile way. If I can get it for you a higher level. This is in the message what visions are 1956 paragraph number 10. He says now in these handkerchiefs being I have more success with the handkerchiefs I guess than anything else especially with American people. American people got an idea in their head that somebody has to touch them or do something to them or lay hands on them. Where they ever got that? Just a Jewish tradition. And I'm trying to get you to believe the gentile way of it. See, the Jews says, "Now come here, lay your hands on my little girl. She'll live." Jarius, that was a Jew. But the Romans said, "I'm not worthy that you'd even come under my house, come under my roof." Said, "I'm a man under authority, and I say to this man, go." He goeth. Everything under me has to mind me. And he recognized the supreme authority that Jesus had over diseases. &gt;&gt; You just speak the word and my servant will live. Now there you are. Now Jesus never said too much about Jarias only he got what he asked for. He went and laid hands on the daughter. But he said to these people there that followed he said now that's great faith. I haven't found faith like that in Israel. See now we want the greater faith. We want to run a higher level. The Lord Jesus wants us to believe him. Amen. &gt;&gt; So here the prophet is trying to get us to believe the gentile way. Remember in his ministry of the first, second, and third pull. His first pull was the sign in the hand. The second pull was the knowing of the intents of the heart through discernment. And his third pull was the speaking of the word. And you know, there's a time where brother Bannam is being taught what these three pools are. He's being shown who and how they work, how they operate. And in the message, the adoption, as we've been through, that four-part sermon and series that he brings in there is in 1960. It's clear that he still was tutoring, being tutored, being taught what this great power is. And you know, there is something about a soldier. And there's something about a uh a person of authority when you come in their presence. It's not just the uniform that they're wearing. It's not that just the title that they have. If they properly have achieved that title and they properly have attained that position, what is it that that really garers the respect? Well, to me as I was thinking about that, what really gives you know where I respect them is their experience and not only their experience, their training. You've got to respect the training because you can take the same human being, same size and stature, same uh mental qualification, same got the same kind of muscles, same kind of everything except one is trained and the other one is not. &gt;&gt; And the scriptures are to train us to be soldiers. That's what the teaching is. And we have to learn how to accept the higher level, the gentile level of believing. It's not something that comes overnight. &gt;&gt; It's not something you can just think and desire that you want it. There's a time element there of the training that has to happen. And we see this in brother Banner's first pull, his second pull, and his third pull. That's that's amazing. I looking at this um football great quarterbacks that we know, Tom Brady and this other one Patrick Mahomes, they won their first Super Bowl after 10 or 11 years or more of playing the game of football. So from little ones coming up, then they go through high school, then they go into college, a lot of people want to be quarterback. It's a lot of people that want to win the Super Bowl, but there's a process that goes with it. And here they are these years and years label later and then the competition changes every round. You get higher &gt;&gt; and where locally you might have been a star in your town. Well now you got to go against people from multiple towns and not only multiple towns from people from around the world. These are the talents that are the best in the world. This is what we would call elite talent. And you can't uh uh uh uh you can't achieve the goal of being elite and you didn't practice. You didn't go through nothing. You never the game was never on the line. You know, out here in your backyard, of course, you can hit that three-pointer shot. There's nobody in your face. The game is not on the line. Of course, you can hit a free throw out here in the local YMCA, but let the game be on the line. Let it be the last game in the season. Let the fans and the atmosphere and the environment and your coaches and your team counting on you to knock that shot down. It's a lot of pressure now. &gt;&gt; You maybe hit that shot many times in your life, but now you're under pressure. And this is what moves just a regular player over into the elite status. You know, these NASCAR drivers, they're really athletes, too. A NASCAR driver are no joke. &gt;&gt; They can make a turn at 200 miles an hour. How many of you have ever driven 150 miles an hour? Anybody ever been in a race car before? Yeah. It's probably nice. It's probably something that is either you're like, "Woo, don't ever do that again." Or like, "Oo, let's do that again." That's that's one of those things that I mean, you can't practice that out nowhere on Speedway or Grant or going to You can't practice that. You got to be in a specialized environment to learn how to even go at 150. But not just 150. Get to 200. Get to 350. get to 200 miles an hour and then make a turn. Ain't nobody in this room can do that. Although there's human beings that can do it. And the human beings that can do it, brother Bobby, they have been trained to do it. They have been under rigorous training, specialized training, moments, hours, days of trying to get this down because that power &gt;&gt; is part of it. How fast it can go and the the horsepower it develops and it's, you know, it can do all of this. But now, do you have the character and the experience to handle that kind of power? And that's what it comes to. This this Bible is powerful. &gt;&gt; Ain't nothing more powerful than this. But do you have the character to hold it and to make it work in your life? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It ain't going to happen overnight. &gt;&gt; It ain't going to happen without a prayer life. &gt;&gt; It sure ain't going to happen if you can't make it into his presence. You got to be in his presence &gt;&gt; and let him develop the skills of a welltrained soldier. I'm talking about an elite class of a soldier. I'm not talking about any kind of a of a believer. I'm talking about a believer &gt;&gt; that has enough faith for his body to be changed &gt;&gt; and to go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Somebody, how many's going in the rapture? &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Is that everybody? Is everybody going in the rapture? Everybody in Tucson? Everybody that wants to go, are they going in the rapture? Is that an elite group? That's a special forces. You know, I'm told of the um this specialized military group, the um the Navy Seals is a rigorous training. And I'm told that many of those specialized forces, they that there's like a 70 to 80% dropout. It's a lot of people start, but it requires more than just a desire. It require I mean I would love to wear that badge, but it would be like a front if I wore the badge, but I really didn't go through the training. Who wants that? That's a stolen valor. Who who who wants the stolen valor? Who who wants to say they're part of the bride, but they really don't have the ingredients to even be they can't even make it. You know, we talking about a third pull speak the word and we don't even have a first pull prayer life. And we want a third pull power and we don't even have a prayer life that will match the first pool. And so any soldier that makes it through that training, they went through it. They passed the test. And if there is a member of the bride of Christ that's going to make it in the rapture, you have got to be tested. &gt;&gt; You've got to go through the training. It's rigorous. It's specialized. And it's beautiful, isn't it? Now, I'm just going to take a few moments and I got a portion that I would like to play for you, but I I have to get through this part here. All right. This higher level that the prophet is talking about, it's it's so beautiful how he brings it in his own ministry and his own life. I like how he brings this in the message 1950 diseases and afflictions. Paragraph number 82. Remember he has a calling in his life. And remember with his calling came with the first, second, and third pull. I want to just say a little bit more about that. And I hope it will help you to embrace it a little bit more when we talk about the first, second, and third pull because brother Badam says that the third pull was a vindication of his ministry. I want you to think of that that that pillar of fire over his head was a vindication. Yes, it was a vindication that he was a man sent by God. This Malachi 4 being fulfilled, that picture right there. and it gives signs and wonders. But then he comes to the end towards the end of his ministry at the third point and he says this is a vindication like it's a complete vindication of my ministry after being tested in 1950. This is what he says here. That's what he said. If you get the people to believe you then be sincere when you pray. No demon can hold over there. Then he has to know the master. Then I know he told me that. And when I can get the patient up to the place till their faith comes to this, that's what gives me a perfect faith. I've never seen it fail. And it never will fail. It can't fail. Praise the Lord. So here, brother Random is telling us that that great commission that was given to him, if you can get the people to believe you, how many remember that &gt;&gt; nothing will stand before your prayer, not even cancer. If you can get the people to believe you, then nothing will stand before your prayer. So, it's your job, Reverend Brham, to get the people that's listening to you to believe what you're saying is the truth. You have to have the gift of becoming believable. Make me believe that what you're saying is true. &gt;&gt; What? What is you saying? An angel came to me. Is that what you're saying? Yes. my peculiar birth. It's always been with me. &gt;&gt; Yes. He called me and told me not to drink, not to smoke. Yes. And then this happened when I was a teenager. &gt;&gt; Yes. And this happened when I was converted. &gt;&gt; Yes. And then I went to the cave and he met me there and he told me if I can get you to believe what I'm saying nothing will stand before my prayer. Now brother says now when he sees the people get to this place here what place is that where they believe him &gt;&gt; then he says now I have perfect faith. It's beautiful. &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. It's a lovely layer. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's lovely how it's laid out. Can I get a witness? &gt;&gt; So, his job first phase to get the people to believe you. And then when you see that the people are believing you or they believe in me now, I got perfect faith. I don't care what it is, it's going to happen because he had perfect faith. Beautiful. So he's trying to get the people to a place to believe. Now what believe is that? In the big grand scheme of things, you'd have to say that he's trying to get the people to believe the highest level there is to believe. Huh? And that highest level to believe is not the Jewish way. The highest level is to speak the word. Now, brother Bam had this vindication in his life. Five definite vindications of the third pool. Now, this um as I've said before that I believe that brother Brandham was a fully adopted son of God. an example for us to look at as what an adopted son looks like. What does a man look like that's been fully adopted? Now, here brother Brandham takes the message in um um it is the rising of the sun and he says this here paragraph 91. He was waved on the at the day of Pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a waving mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people the Pentecostal people that was up at Pentecost waiting for the blessing to come and to be waved again. We realize in the last day according to Luke 17:30 in the Sunday again in the day that the sen of man will be revealed or waved again over the people. Now who is the son of man? In the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And if all the teaching that we have and confirmation of the word of God by word of God by signs by wonders we see today that in the book of Luke here that we just quoted Luke the 17th chapter 30th verse Malachi 4 and the different scriptures that we're acquainted with that the word again is waved over the people. Paragraph 94. As Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth, although typed in many places, he was the first fruits of those that slept. In the bride coming of Christ, coming out of the church, there will have to be a sheath waved again in the last days. Waving of the sheath. What was the sheath? The first one that come to mature. &gt;&gt; The first one that proved it was a wheat, that proved it was a sheath. Hallelujah. I'm sure you see what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Do you see what he's talking about? &gt;&gt; What's he talking about? Jesus with sandals on on the seas of Galilee or is he talking about the word being made flesh in your generation again? is the first one that come to maturity. It's amazing how people have a problem with talking about that one that came to maturity and yet we're trying to preach to people that we should come to maturity. When our first brother, the one that's an example of maturity, come up through the stages and now he's the first one to come to maturity and it is waved over the people. &gt;&gt; They don't want to wave it over the people now. That's on them. But I want it to wave over my life. &gt;&gt; Lord, wave the sheath over me. &gt;&gt; Every time I'm in my truck playing it every time I'm at home hearing it. Every time I'm in service, wave the sheath over me because this is what a son looks like. &gt;&gt; This is what a real son that's come to maturity look like. the gentile age, the the the whole church denominational system. Never seen a man like this. Never seen a maturity come up like this. Very, very rare. Hadn't seen it before. And so, uh, they couldn't deal with them. What they're going to do with a group of us coming to that maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it was the first one that come to the maturity. Now look at what brother Brandham says here in 1963. He's talking about this third pool. It's November. It's towards the end of the year. And look at what he says. Just one brief statement about it. And he says this. And Lord, we don't know what this third pool as we have referred to it will be. I don't know what. But we know one thing that the first pool was perfection. The second pool being the five was grace. So the prophet is making this statement here. Now he goes into the message blasphemous names and and here's what he says here in blasphemous names. Remember blasphemous names is the message right after the stature of the perfect man. These two messages are put together at the same time. Is that right? He bringing the understanding of what Peter's virtues were in the pyramid. So I had a picture of that that pyramid quickly. I think I have one in my Bible here where the prophet is talking about add to your faith virtue, knowledge, temperance, and all those fine things. Right? Oh my, I won't take time to do it. Somebody got it for me. Thank you. Statue of a perfect man. So now he's preaching this message. It's like he preached the adoption message in 1960. Here it is a few years later and he preaches um the stature of a perfect man. He takes the scripture in second Peter chapter 1. Add to your faith virtue, knowledge, temp, and all those things. Then he comes back a day or so later and preaches a message blasphemous names. And he goes forward and this is what he says in that message blasphemous names paragraph 166. He's bringing in the adoption or the placing of a son. I still have a little more time. Now, in the Old Testament, when the son was adopted or placed into the family, his name was just as good as a check as his daddy's was. Yes, sir. They didn't have a they they had a ring them days, a sign, a signate, and um Brother Bam makes a spitting sound. He spit on it, place it. There was a signet that just wore his daddy's ring, his signant. And that was just as good as his daddy's. Now when Jesus had been obedient Jesus to God, God placed him positionally that this is him. Now when the member is born by the Holy Ghost into the family of God and has proven to have these virtues in him that God can see virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness and godliness in him, then God seals him or places him. And there you see the sons and daughters of God. He's talking about the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God. Paragraph 175, he says this in that same message, blasphemous names. He says, "But when these things are operating in you by God, then you're sealed. Then there's no put on about it." So what is it? We want those things not just around us, not just we heard about it, not here and there, but we want them actually operating in us. &gt;&gt; And when we see those things operating in us, the the prophet tells us, watch him for a little while, sit back and see how he's about the father's business. And um when those things are operating in you and that's a a a pivotal point there. Now you can move from being a rookie up to the next level of a soldier. Before you had the uniform, but we didn't give you no gun. We got to make sure you can you got you can handle different situations. Can you talk your way out of a conflict? You know, I think some people get a gun too quick because if you don't have no gun, you learn the beautiful art of negotiating with folks. Yeah, you'll figure it out. You better figure it out cuz you ain't got no gun. But when you got a gun and you haven't been matured, the first thing you do, somebody look at you wrong, you put your hand on your gun. Like, man, are we there? &gt;&gt; Was this a moment to pull out a gun on somebody? We just got a, you know, a bad spot in traffic and you want to pull a gun out on somebody. This is why you need to go around with your little uniform. Then maybe we'll give you a badge and then maybe you go through some testing. We might give you a gun with no bullets and then move right on up into the ranks. And this is how any business works. This is how it works in the military. This is how it works. And anything that you call elite, you know, one of the things they they they talk about in the the special forces, they're they're they go into this special operations and they're they're they're really made for really unique conflict. Now, they're all soldiers. Yes, you join the army, you join the military, you join the navy, but then in the navy you have these special forces that are developed that come out of the group of just general populated uh soldiers and there's testing that has to be done and there's tears to it and there's training &gt;&gt; and so just you know having the authority is is is it comes because of the training and the experience. You're highly trained and then you're specialized and then you deal with direct action and then you you got to deal with unconventional uh uh scenarios and how conflicts develop and how they happen and you can't just be a new person jumping in on the scene. Somebody's life is on the line. It's a specialized unit. And so are we the bride of Christ. He's called us to a specialized training. Our faith ought to be the highest faith than any other group of human beings on this planet. &gt;&gt; And it has nothing to do with our skin color or our nationality. But it has everything to do with our training and our experience. I've had an experience with God. This is what David went to Saul with. One day I was hurting my father's sheep and a bear came up and a lion came up and the Holy Spirit used me and I got the job done and that was his experience. And then he moved to the next level and he went out and he fought a giant and he defeated the giant, his experience and his calling and qualifications. How many of you have had an experience? If you're a believer today, you have to have had an experience that made you a believer. A believer is something supernatural. Amen. To believe God's word, something supernatural had to happen to you. Can I get a witness here this morning? &gt;&gt; It's not by chance. It's not a nothing. It's a something. &gt;&gt; I am a believer. Something supernatural happened to me and made me a believer in God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you get your skills developed on how to witness. You know in the scripture is 1 Timothy 3 verses 1-7. It's talking about the office of a bishop which is a pastor or a shepherd. One of those qualifications in there that he must not be a novice because being a novice and that word novice it means a person that is new. He's inexperienced in the field or situation. And that Hebrew word there, forget the Greek word, but it's a Hebrew word 5194. And it means one of the literal translations means it's uh to be newly planted. That's what a a novice is. And the Bible talks about that a a bishop must not be a novice, newly planted. And it tells why. because you might fall into the trap of the devil and condemnation there. Moreover, he must be a good report, not a novice. Verse six, lest being lifted up with pride. He fall into the condemnation of the devil. So, there's an experience that comes with this role in this office. As I said, these great superstar quarterbacks, they've had years of training. these NASCAR drivers and these highly technical athletes that we see, super athletes that the world, some of these people we have never seen, a physique like that, that big, that tall, that can run that fast, that skilled in that position. And the world looks at that and it's highly skilled. We're all human beings. Yes, we all love the game. Yes. But this one has excelled to far above others. And we can say that about this messenger. &gt;&gt; We ain't never seen this before. &gt;&gt; The church has never seen this before. &gt;&gt; Since or even since he left in 1965. What what what can compare to what that ministry was? It's amazing how the intellectuals that now come against this great messenger. But what was his first uh task of duty was to get the people to do what? Question him, factcheck him, make sure he see if he's telling the truth or not. If I can get the people to what? To believe me. and and and I found out over the last five years or more, maybe 10, maybe five to seven years, everybody does not believe this prophet. &gt;&gt; It's proven because this is what he said and they're not doing what he said &gt;&gt; or they'll even argue against what he said or reinterpret what he said and we're still not at the place where we have believed him. You say you you say, "Brother Israel, we preached that for years. Believe the prophet. Come to church. Believe the prophet. We want something more. Oh, do you? I in this last day, look at the nonsense that swept through this city of unbelief. A direct negative force against this ministry right here. And what did it do? That they all stay solid? That they all stay sane? That they all hold their position? No, they didn't. Many left. Many fell away. many ministries got rid of the messages, took the pictures down, stopped quoting from it because it's too messagy. And then you have to ask yourself the question, did they really believe? &gt;&gt; And his first task, his first order as a soldier, his first job as nobody else did it like him. Nobody he can he can uh you know you know draw strength from anybody but the Lord on how to do this. Lord, how am I going to get the people? How many people had an angel come to them? How can I say it, Lord? How can I develop it? Please show me how. And over the years and years and years of consistent preaching and staying with the word, there is a little bitty group that believed that what he said was true. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, absolutely. &gt;&gt; If somebody in those days didn't believe back then, nobody would be here today. &gt;&gt; This is why I thank the Lord for the elders that have gone on. I really do. &gt;&gt; Somebody had to believe it. &gt;&gt; Somebody had to be a quote unquote message church with no headquarters, no main bishop. Somebody had to do it. I thank God for the ones that did. So this specialized units that God has called up in this last day &gt;&gt; comes with a lot of training, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; Specialized training. What's some of the training they do for a new vehicle that comes out? Huh? How many of you have a new car? I'm not going to embarrass you. How many has a 2024 and above or 2025? One, two, couple. Do you think they'll have a new model in 2026? Do you think they know what it looks like? You know, to to develop a new model is like three to five years in the making. Put that together. So your 2025 model probably really only is only a 2020 model because it's being developed. It has already been designed. They're not waiting till November and December to start, you know, let's work on this design for 2026. Are you serious? When when do they start working on the design? You read it. years in the making and are constantly tweaking that model. They're tweaking it for is it market ready? Is it ready for is it going to meet the demands of the day? How did 2025 model do? And then we'll kind of know if we need to tweak 2026 and we got 2027, 2028 on the way too. &gt;&gt; Think about it, saints. Let me ask you something. Are you market ready? &gt;&gt; Are you ready to be a member representing a member of a bride of Christ? I'm not talking about comparing oursel with other churches. I'm talking about comparing ourselves with what this brother said on the tapes. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the tape ministry. How many churches are a real church? How many pastors are real pastors? What about the gifts of the spirit? What about the Holy Spirit working? What about calling this the sons and the daughters of God? What about it, saints? Huh? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; These great powerful motors that they're making today that they build and all the horsepower, you got to be trained to know how to use that power, how to drive that vehicle. You know, some of the testing they do, they they do a vibration test and then they do shock testing and they ch test it in the environment. I'm talking about it ain't even on the streets yet. This is all in the back room. This is all the testing that's taking place before anybody on the market has seen this vehicle yet. It's in the making. It's working. It's being built. It's being tweaked. It's being, you know, manipulated. all right now. It's testing its um ability to run into other things and it's crash tested. It's can it absorb the shocks? Can it handle vibrations? Can it go cross country? Is it a long haul? What kind of vehicle is this? Because I need to put a guarantee behind it when I put it on the on on on the public showing. What about you and I? I think I think I think Joseph I think I love the character of Joseph. I think Joseph was a secret weapon that nobody knew really who he was. This man was being built. He's rubbing shoulders with prisoners. He's coming in different homes and God is using him and blessing him. His daddy missed him. His brothers missed him. His mother, all of them didn't know who he was. and all of the turmoil and all of the foolishness and all of the craziness. Then finally the day came where God unveiled a secret weapon. &gt;&gt; A secret weapon to save the land of Egypt. &gt;&gt; I needed somebody in Egypt that can interpret a dream. Somebody with character, somebody that has the authority, somebody that knows what they're talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I really believe with all my heart, we're talking about the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; I believe that that will take place and it's possible that it is taking place. This is not a Facebook showing. &gt;&gt; This is not for the internet to say, "Oh, that church, they're manifesting it. Brother Israel, brother whoever, brother so and so, they're manif." That's not what this is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. If God came down in his love and mercy and started working through the sons and daughters of God in this little lovely little city of our own, wouldn't you want to be a part of that? &gt;&gt; And if you are a part of it, do you have to tell everybody? Do you want the credit for being the first one? Come on, somebody. It's being made right now. You can have it right now. [Music] &gt;&gt; Probably going on in some little country they can't even read and write, but they believe this word with all their heart. &gt;&gt; Oh no, no, no, brother Israel. If this going to happen, it's going to happen. Going to come to the American church. Really? You know, he identified the American people that their problem is they got to have somebody. He identifies them. I just read the quote for you. The Americans want, you know, the prayer cloth did so well with the Americans because they wanted something in their hand. But he went overseas without the AC and air conditioning and 24-hour clean water and 24-hour electricity. He went over there and stood at the platform and did it one time. and them precious humble hearts rose up and received it the gentile way, the higher way. &gt;&gt; What are we trying to do, saints? Where are we trying to go back to? &gt;&gt; God is moving us forward &gt;&gt; and he's giving us a tremendous example. Oh my, &gt;&gt; God bless you so much. &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandon brings this third pull so beautifully and he gives us an example. And so, in 19 I read it for you there. He said, "We don't know what it is. We don't know what it is. It could be." And then Sister Brandham has this tumor. And that happened near December, the time of Christmas. And he spoke that word over her and it manifested the third pole. Now, can we take a little bit of time this morning? And I want to play this portion of the tape. And for those of you that just take a note of it if you can, if you desire, I believe it'll bless you and it help you because we we you hear us talk about the third pool. Brother Vanam, in this message, it's a very big, deep, vast subject. But this little portion here and look away to Jesus covers a lot of what he's talking about. And it's it's it's like this to me. Either I'm going to take what brother Brandham said or what somebody else said. And I choose to take brother Brad's thoughts on it. All right. This is in the message. Look away to Jesus. We'll go quickly. &gt;&gt; Jesus said that what he heard that was what he spoke. And he said, "I called you my friends." And a friend tells his friends all things. Paul said in Acts 20:27, "I have not shun to declare to you the whole council of God." And may I join in tonight and say the same thing with that great saint of old. To the best of my knowledge, I have not I have not shunned but declared to you the whole council of God. Someone was playing one of the tapes the other day. Just because it made somebody angry, they shot at him through the window and a woman wounded. So perhaps someday I'll seal my testimony. But when that time comes and I'm ready to go until my time comes, there's nothing going to hurt me until that time. &gt;&gt; Now, we believe in the same gospel just the way the Bible is written. It's zeroed. And and if the gun is exactly zeroed and in tune, if it strikes the target the first time, it'll strike it the second time and every time. If a tree or limb vine puts out a branch and that branch bears a certain fruit, the next time the the vine puts out a branch, it'll bear the same kind of fruit. And if Jesus is the vine and we are the branches and the first branch church that that vine put out, they wrote a book of acts behind it. &gt;&gt; And that first branch baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. And they had the living God among them that did the same things among them that he did when he was on earth. Therefore, the people taken notice to them, though ignorant and unlearned that they had been with Jesus because his life was through them. As I've said, if I had the spirit of of Beethoven in me, I would write songs. If B if I if Beethoven lived in me, I'd be Beethoven. See, if Shakespeare lived in me, I'd be Shakespeare. I I'd write poems and and plays and so forth. If Shakespeare lived in me and if Christ lives in me, the works of Christ you'll do. It's got to be. And what is Christ? The word. He said, "If ye abide in me, my word in you, then ask what you will. It'll be done because the word's there. Just needs the light and the light makes it live." So now I am going to say something to you now that I haven't said all along. That is the thing that we have looked forward to for so long or at least many years, four, five years or maybe longer. The third pull has now been vindicated. And I'm sure you all know what it is. Now remember, there'll never be an impersonation of that because it can't be. It cannot be. Now it's inexistent. And I have I am warned of this that soon right at this time now it's just happened so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this council begins to tighten up and when it does when that does the Pentecostals and so forth for can almost impersonate anything could be done. But when that time comes, when the squeeze comes down, then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power. &gt;&gt; Now, I must continue in evangelism. Just as I was commissioned first, I must continue on. Therefore, you've had the word and you know what to look for, how to stand. I must continue on in evangelism. And friends of mine, keep still and just keep moving on for the hour is approaching swiftly. See that when something is going to be done now, you might see some little odd things happen from nothing sinful. I don't mean that. But I mean something odd to what the regular trend because where I've reached to now in the ministry I'm dropping back here watching that spot and waiting for the time to use it. But it's going to be used and everyone knows that for as certain as the first was identified so has the second been identified. And if you'll think real closely, you who are spiritual, as the Bible say, hears to him that has wisdom. The third is properly identified. &gt;&gt; We know where it is. So the third pole is here. It is so sacred that I'm mustn't say much about it as he told me in the beginning said this. Say nothing of it. You remember that years ago? &gt;&gt; It speaks for itself. But you I've tried to explain the others and I made a mistake. This will be the thing that to my opinion, I don't say the Lord tells me this. This will be the thing that'll start the rapture in faith for the going away. And I must lay quiet for just a little while. Now remember, and who's listening to this tape, you might see such a change in my ministry right away. Dropping back, not going up, dropping back. We're right at the age now, and it can't be can't go any further. We have to wait just a minute until this happens over here to catch up. Then the time comes. But it's thoroughly identified. There's coming a time upon in this nation to where this nation is going to exercise all the power that the beast had before it which was pagan Rome when it become papome. &gt;&gt; That's this nation will do that. Revelations 13 plainly explains it. The lamb come up out of the earth. The other beasts come up out of water, thickness and multitudes of people. This lamb come up where there was no people. A lamb represents uh religion uh the lamb of God. And remember it spoke like a lamb. It was a lamb and then after a while it be received power and spoke like a dragon &gt;&gt; and exercised all the the dragon power the dragon had before him. And the dragon is Rome always. So don't you see Roman denomination a marked Protestant denomination a image unto the beast making a power that'll force all Protestants like a union. You'll have to be into this council of churches or you won't be able to have fellowship or to to well it's it's practically that way now. You can't go to a church and preach unless you have a fellowship card or some identification. And now on persons like ourselves, we're going to be cut out of all that alto together. That's exactly because it won't be able to do it. It's tightening. And then when that time comes and the press comes to a place to where you're pressed out, then watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes. Watch the third pull then. And it'll be absolutely to the total lost, but it it will be for the bride in the church. Now, we're closer than it seems to be. I don't know when, but it's real real close. &gt;&gt; I may be building a platform for somebody else to step on. I may be taken before that time. I don't know. And that time may be this coming week that the Holy Spirit will come with and bring Christ Jesus. He may come this next week. He may come yet tonight. I don't know when he will come. He doesn't tell us that. But I do believe that we are so close that I would never die with old age. Yet at 54 years old, I'll never die with old age until he's here. &gt;&gt; Unless I'm shot, killed, or something other some way killed. this old age wouldn't kill me until he's come. And I believe that, and I want to say this, I've never said it before, but according to scripture, according to what he said 30 years ago, 33 years ago on the river down there in 1933, rather what he said, everything has happened just exactly. I may not do it, but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world. For as John the Baptist was sent to forrun the first coming, so is the message to forrun the second coming. And John said, "Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world." So it's it paralleled it in every way and I know it will the message will go on. Now there's been some great things take place along the road. This morning I was having interviews in the room here and a a young fellow by the name of Autry. He's probably still in here tonight. He's from San Anton, Texas. He come asked if we was going to Dallas coming from California if we could drop in one night at their uh tabernacle just for one night and they're looking it up uh the next day or two to see if we can do that. And he was telling me about I'd never been to Sanon since that first meeting. Now the first meeting when I come to San Anton I was there I think with brother Coot and the uh and the international Bible school and I forget the auditorium we had the service in and it's either my first night or second night I think the first night when I was walking to the platform someone's raised up in the building way back in the back and spoke with tongues like a a machine gun firing and no more and sat down just a moment or to to one raised on the platform and give the interpretation and I stopped at what he said and I said to the man do you know this man said no sir and he said uh I said how'd you come here he said the people I work for was at uh was here tonight and they brought me he's a was a cowboy and I said what do you do he said do you know him said no sir I never seen him and I said what are you and he was a a merchant in the city and what they said in the the now I was always before I learned better I was a little skeptic of speaking in tongues. I thought a lot of it was flesh and it might be but when this was said that interpretation was exactly what the angel of the Lord said down on the river 11 years before that John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ. You're sent the forerun the second gy &gt;&gt; there it was when that angel that light has been thoroughly identified both by the church by the word by science and everything has identified that light for its first time to appear in public standing right over where I was at by 2:00 in the afternoon at the foot of the bridge right right down here at the foot of spring street in the water now that's been many many years ago and exactly what it said has come to pass to the dock This brother uh here was telling me this morning he married a girl out of the church her sister Noi's uh daughter. Now I don't know I guess a young man or you hear a brother uh Audrey I don't know he was from Sanon I don't know whether he's here or not uh he was here this morning and he was telling me I believe it was his grandfather during that meeting had been an epileptic all of his life and was brought there. That's the first beginning of the ministry when it said that if the discernment was put their hands upon mine and what would be said would be what it was. And I told you and many are witnesses tonight that it would come to pass that I would know the very secret of their heart. You remember that before it ever happened about five or six years later that taken place and up in Canada for its first time and that happened. Then he said, "If you'll keep being sincere, it'll just keep going." And now the third thing has taken place. See, just constantly moving on. And he said his father was brought into the line and told of this epilepsy and so forth and a prayer prayed for him. And that's been 16 years ago. I think it is about 16 or 17 years ago. And he says he never has had a seizure of it since. And he's pretty 85 years old. Never had a seizure since. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it? Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, day and forever. Is Margie Morgan in the building? Sister Margie Morgan, a lady that was eaten up with cancer, a nurse. How many remember Sister Morgan? If she's here, she can't get in. She was nursing. You see, on the cancer list in Louisville, the woman's been dead for about 16, 17 years. On the cancer list in Louisville. When Jim Tom Robinson, the attorney, Christian attorney, heard about it, he went to the Baptist hospital to check and see if he's right because his father's on the board trustee at the Baptist hospital and they looked up the case and the woman was supposed to been dead years ago and she's nursing here at the Jeffersonville in the hospital when she stood right here when they had to hold her up not even in her own mind but it was thus sayaeth the Lord and she's a living. She went to nursing in Louisville and a fellow down here Shimp's candy place. Is Mr. Shimp here tonight? I'd like for him to tell it if he's here. Sunny Shimp, great healthy man. Many times and I used to I hate to say this, but it's the truth. Pop used to give me a dime if I worked all week. And I'd come to town and park my bicycle around at brother Mike Eaggan's place, one of the trustees here with Jimmy Pool. I think his son is here tonight, Jim and I, and Ernest Fischer. And we would go downtown and go to the picture show uh for a nickel. And we used to see the old steel pictures with little kids and one about 8 10 years old. We had that William S. Hart. Many of you guys don't remember him, the old actor. Steel pictures. I couldn't read. I just had to watch what was going on. And uh you would have to spill it all out. I couldn't make it, but I'd watch what he was doing. I'd have an extra nickel. How many remembers getting a penny ice cream cone? All right. I could get three ice cream cones and two pennies worth of red hots. I couldn't hold the ice cream cone. So, I'd eat them and get me two pennies worth of red hots. It' be almost a half a pound of them thing. And shimps made them. And I go in there and sit back and watch William Asshart. And this young fella, a little older than I, stricken down with a disease that five noted specialists of Louisville passed him by weighing about 45 pounds and was dying. Miss Morgan was nursing him and he was in such a condition. He had some many things. His lungs was gone, his throat was gone, his little arms was just about that big around. and he was laying there dying and Miss Morgan was hard to come on the job. So she said to him, "Uh, I was once the cancer patient and began to tell him." He said, "Who' you say, Billy Brand?" Why? He said, "I've sold him a many a bunch of red hots and ice cream cones." He said, "Wonder if he'd come pray for me." And I went over to pray for Juny um uh Shimp. And uh if you'd like to talk to him, it's Shimp's Candy right next door or second door from Lero's Theater down the street. Shimps Candy. All of you here know where that's at. M one of the oldest establish in Jeffersonville. And while laying there dying with five specialists giving him just hours to live was thus saith the law, you'll not die, but you'll sell me again red hots. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Over the counter. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Long I know he got well, but long had I forgotten that. And wife and I was going down to buy some candy when we got here at Christmas. And how I don't know that we ever thought of shimps cuz usually you go over here some of these drugstores and pick it up. But we stopped in front of shims. When I went in, his sister looked and she said, "Well, brother Brown," she said, "you remember Juny." I said, "Yes." And there a great big strong healthy looking fellow. And I walked toward the counter, looked at it, looked down like this. I said, "I'll take a pound of those red hots." And he said, "Yes, sir." So his sister was waiting on my wife. And so he got them out. I said, "I used to eat them a long time ago over here in the picture show. Keep my head down." And he said, "Yes." Said, "Man, the kids buy that. They still buy." I said, he said, "My father made that. Fixed up that farm." I said, "I really like him." And I after he got all fixed up in the hand to me, he says, "Anything else?" And I said, "I don't know." And raised up. Oh my. He said, "Brother Brandon," I said, "Here's a red hot, I told you, thus sayaeth the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; About five years ago, he said, "Brother Brandon, I am so completely healed. There's not even one effect. I'm teeny bit hard hearing in one ear. I guess he's in his 50s. He said I'm teeny bit hard hearing in one ear because they give me so much antibiotic when I was in there. Amazing grace of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I haven't got much time now to say something else, but I I I want to make this statement. &gt;&gt; How many remembers about the squirrels? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. That was a puzzling scripture in my life that I I never could understand that. And there was another that puzzled me. That's when Moses could tell God a better way than God know how to do anything. When Moses said they have people who say your God was able to bring you out but not able to keep you and Moses threw himself in the breach. Then later I found out that Moses that was Christ in Moses standing for the people. See? So then on this scripture and I never would preach on it if you say to this mountain be moved and you know the story. So I'll bypass that. Now little did I know what that was leading to and I think that brother Woods and Brother Fred and them are here in the building which was present when that happened or right after it happened there. Brother Rodney and brother Charlie from down in Kentucky. Sister Woods's brother-in-l was present when it happened down in Kentucky, which was the second time it happened. Just simply speaking into existence things that wasn't seeing all time and backing up the scriptures encouraging. The third time it happened was had he right? Is Hattie here tonight? That's Edis. How many knows Hadty right? Brother Woods and I were sitting there when it happened and when the Holy Spirit said give her what she wants and I was talking about that how do them squirrels come into existence and I said it's the only thing it is he's Jehovah Gyra just when Abraham needed a ram God provided that ram &gt;&gt; and he provided the squirrels he could speak a squirrel just into existence because he's creator just the same as he could speak the ram Abraham never asked for He was just simply going on to do it. But it showed that Jehovah Gyra was there. When I said that, a humble little woman for the first time this ever happened. The third pull up on a human being was a little humble woman that making about $200 a year for a living. Well, she got out of her little farm, her husband dead, two children that had turned kind of wild, and come and donated $20 of that to the building of this tabernacle. And media give me some money that morning for groceries, $20. And I was going to give it back to her that day while I was down there so she wouldn't have to pay it, but she wouldn't take it. And when she's sitting back in the corner and when I said, "Only thing I know is he's still Jehovah Gyra." And little Haddie said the right word. She said, "That's nothing but the truth." And when she said that, Brother Bankswood, here's one that was present. That room felt like it was coming apart. And the Holy Spirit said, the same voice that spoke about the squirrel said, "Give her what she asked for." &gt;&gt; I said, "Sister Hattie, as a witness before God, this is it." Now, if there's any doubt in your mind, you ask what you want to, and if it ain't laid in your lap, then I'm a false prophet. She said, "Brother Brandham," everybody was crying. Said, "What shall I ask?" I said, "You're poor and you live on the hill over there with no money. You might ask for that. You got a little crippled sister sitting here, Edith, that we prayed for for years. You might ask for her healing." I said, "Your father and mother is old and broke down, you might ask for them. Whatever you ask for, Sister Haddie, see now if it happens or not, right now." And I said, "He's just told me." The same voice said, "Give her what she asked for." And she looked around. She said, "What shall I say, brother Benam?" I said, "Say what your desire is. Think of your greatest desire and say it. And her boys was even snickering and laughing. And she said, "The greatest desire I have is the salvation of my two sons." I said, "I'll give them to you in the name of Jesus Christ." And there they went. And they've been faithful in this church with communion. That little fella sitting out washing feet with the man and things like that. We all are witness of that. She had a real choice. Her mother has to die. So does she. All of them. But what she asked will be eternal. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the salvation of her children. &gt;&gt; That was the third time it happened. The fourth time it happened, I just explained it here. The last time I was here, was up on the mountain &gt;&gt; were that storm raging. How many heard it? All right. Were the storm raging and God being my judge standing here going down the mountain when David Wood, he's here somewhere, I guess. That made me a sandwich. And it was quite a one. I think he's trying to get even with me for the one I made for his daddy a few years ago. He had baloney and and meat and everything mixed together. I put it in my shirt and it rained and just got just a big wad of dough. And I was coming down the mountain. It's so stormy. I couldn't even see my hand before me hardly. And I know just one thing. You're turned around cuz that wind's just whirling. Now there's witnesses here to that. One of them is one of our faithful deacons, which is Brother Wheeler. Are you here, Brother Wheeler? Where is he at? Uh, you're right here. Brother Wheeler. Brother Man, a Methodist preacher from New Albany. Is he Brother Man in tonight? Uh, don't know whether he is or not. Brother Banks Woods, are you here? Brother Banks, he's in the recording room. All right. And um, and David Woods and Brother Evans was there, I believe. Is that right, Brother Evans? Brother Evans stand against the wall was there and how they broadcast for days. Two days before that, a mighty blizzard was sweeping the land. Brother Tom Simpson is here tonight. When coming down out of Canada, they asked him to bypass there because he couldn't get through. A blizzard was coming. Brother Tom, are you here? Where are here? He's sitting right here. And there the clouds come up and I said, "Brethren," everybody rushed out. There was nobody back there out of a hund and something man back there. There's nobody back there but our little group and the cowboy, the rider. and we was going to stay. I called Sister Evans and had her call the wife and tell her to tell Tony if I didn't get out get somebody else to hold the breakfast for the businessman and up on the mountain that that day I said now when it first little rain starts or anything take for the camp I said within 10 to 15 minutes you can't see your hands before you when that blizzards and it'll dump 20 foot of snow just a little bit o over the mountain that's how people you read in the paper how they're back there and perish and everything but we knew how to get out and they know where we was at. And so we felt led to stay. And um so up on the mountain when that blizzard started, I started going down and I was just about a half a mile from where it started. And the voice of God said, "Turn and go back." And I went back as he told me after waiting for a while eating that sandwich that David give me and went back up there and sat down. And while I was sitting there in that wind twisting and blowing the treetops leaning way over into sleep and snow flying like that, a boy said, "I am the God of creation." &gt;&gt; I looked up. I thought, "Where was that? That was a wind maybe." He said, "I created the heavens and earth. I steal the mighty winds upon the seas." And went on talking. I jumped up and took off my hat. And he said, "Just speak to the storm and it'll cease. Whatever you say, that's what'll happen. I said, storm, you cease and sun, you shine normally for 4 days till we're out of here. And uh no more and set it until the sleet snow and everything stopped in a moment or two. The hot sun is shining on my back. I seen the winds blowing like this come back from the north coming down. I mean, from the east, coming from the east, it was coming from the west. The winds changed and come back this way. the clouds like a mystic thing lifting up into the air and the sun was shining in a few minutes. &gt;&gt; Then the Lord Jesus spoke to me a little later on about my wife down there as you know about where I went up there. I've never been home on anniversary yet. We've been married 22 years. The first anniversary at first our wedding I took her on a hunting trip because I couldn't afford take the hunting trip and and uh and go on a honeymoon too. So I I kind of put it together. And so then um and I've been hunting ever since and I felt the way I treated her. Now that was the fourth time it happened. Now here's something I I want to say. I must tell exactly the truth about 16 years ago. I was in California with brother John Sherid and I was having a meeting and a media and I and brother Sher and sister Sher and I was staying in a hotel and a man named Paul Malikin who stood right here in this tabernacle many times. He's a wealthy Armenian and his wife had give birth to a child up at Fresno, California where they lived and was come down brought his wife down and called me at the hotel and said can I bring my wife up brother I said yes you may. Next day I was going to Catalina. So um they brought his wife up and the little lady was so sick and she I said, "Put your hand on mine, sister Maliki." And I said, "We'll see if the Lord will tell us." And as soon as she laid her hands up on me, I said, "Oh, it's milking." She said, "I don't seem to have any symptoms." I said, "You watch in two days, there's doctor in there for milk." Like little Jimmy Pool here, his little baby the other day come in with that heart attack they thought is an asthmetic attack. And I put my hand on him. I said, "Watch him for a couple days. He's got measles. It's coming through. It's a fever." I met him last night and said, "He's broke out all over and measles." See, now talking to Sister Malikin with a hand. She said, "That's amazing thing to watch that, Brother Brand." She said, "Does that work on every hand?" I said, "Well, if there's something wrong with the patient." I said, "Now here, I put my hand on." Many of us stood and watched it and it didn't do it. I said, "Here, there's nothing wrong with my wife." put her hand. Look here, honey. Put your hand on mine. She's studying there. My wife, she put her hand on mine as Suz did. I said, "You have a cyst on the left ovary. You do have female trouble." And she said, "I don't feel any different." I said, "But you have it." Becky was two years old, my daughter that just played a while. She was two years old. Two more years, Sarah come on the scene. And when she is a cecerian, and I asked Dr. Dilman, our doctor down in in Carden to when you have her open, look at that leftovering. And he did. He said, "Nothing wrong that I saw. I put my hand. It's still there." Four years later, come Joseph. I asked him, "Look again. Nothing wrong as I seen. Put my hand. It's still there." So, we just forgot about it. Now, this is something that I have to say. I don't like to say it, but it just has to make the truth. See, and that's what you want. always tell the truth no matter what takes place. &gt;&gt; Years had passed would never notice it. And I say this not because she's sitting there because I say it when she's not there. And you know that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't believe there could be a better wife in the world than my wife. And I hope she always remains that way. And I want to be a loyal husband. And I hope that every young man in this building when he gets married gets a wife like my wife. I don't know how long we'll live that way, but I hope the rest of our days on earth, we've been very happy together. God was the one who told me to marry her. At the same time, her not knowing I was trying not to marry her, not because I didn't love her, but because I didn't think I was able to make a living far and she's a fine woman and I just didn't deserve that. And she went out to pray and opened up the Bible. And guess she said, "Lord, I've never did this before, but give me a scripture that'll help me. If I got to forget him, I've got to forget it." Open the Bible. when she went out in a little shed and prayed. And when she opened the Bible up, Malachi 4, behold, I send unto you Elijah the prophet before that was that was 20 something years ago knowing nothing about the ministry of this day. And I was couldn't believe I was laying down the river there and he woke me up one night. I heard him stand there at the door. He said, "Go get her and your wedding shall be this coming October the 23rd." And that's just exactly what I did. And we've lived happy by the grace of God. We've never had one word. She's been a sweetheart. One day I come in and she's had to raise these children by herself. Me gone in the ministry. Not many women would put up with that. You know that. That'd be hard. And I come in and she said something. We got Joseph back there and he's a he sure is a boy and he put some of the gray hair in his mother's head as well as I did. So he was a real old boy and he had done something real bad and I said to her uh she said to me, "Bill, give him a licking." I said, "I just ain't got the nerve, you know." And she said, "Yes, if you had to put up with it." And she slammed the door right in my face. Well, I thought that's all right. Poor little fella didn't mean that. I just went on out to wash my car. And when I got out there, the Holy Spirit didn't like it. He said, "Go tell her." I believe it's 2 Chronicles 22nd chapter. I I I thought first I just imagined I just kept on washing and it said it again. Go tell her to read this. Now I went in got to Bible and read it. It was where Mo or Miam the prophetist made fun of her brother Moses for marrying an Ethiopian girl and God didn't like it and he said been better than her father spitting her face and and to to done that. So Miriam broke out with leprosy all over. And so Aaron come told his sister said come told his brother said she's dying with leprosy. And so Moses running to intercede for her at the altar. And when he did the pillar of fire come down God. He said go call her and Aaron and bring him here. And Aaron was in a tube. So he said call him and come here. He said, "If there be one among you, God speaking out of them that's spiritual or a prophet, I the Lord will make myself known to him. I'll speak to him in visions and reveal myself to him by dreams and and reveal dreams and so forth." He said, "But my servant Moses, there's no one in the land like him." He said, "I speak with him from lip to ear." He said, "Didn't you fear God?" See, God didn't like it. &gt;&gt; Well, when I seen that, I run in and she was in the other room. I knocked on the door. She had shut herself up and I told her I want to speak to her. And I went in there and talked to her, tried to tell her what it was. I said, "Sweetheart, you know how I love you, but God didn't like that. You ought to have said that." Immediately after that, she tuck a trouble in her side. We took her over to the doctor here in Louisville. Dr. Arthur Sheen and he found a tumor on the left ovary that I'd found 15 or 16 years before. Tumor on the left ovary about the size of a walnut. I said, "What about it?" Doctor said, "Let's see what happens." Bring her back again a few month about two months or something. We tuck her back. It had grown from a walnut to about size of a lemon. said, "Better come out till they get soft and turn malignant." I said, "Well, my" I said, "We're we're going to Tucson. The Lord has sent me out to Tucson." He sent her up to a female specialist. He didn't want it on his hands. So, he must have told him about my ministry cuz he um the female specialist said, "I'll have to come out." So, he said, we told him was going to to Tucson. He said, "Well, I've got a specialist there, a dear friend of mine. He used to live in Tucson. He said, "I'm going to send you to him." So he wrote a note and sent it to him and said Miss Bram's a nice lady and went on like that said sent her the diagram of how big the tumor was and so forth it turned tumor then and said how big it was and said I know you know you know I think he thought calls me a divine healer that's all you know how to put it but said I have agreed that it could come out it should if it has to be taken out take it out but it's testing our faith constantly we prayed and more we prayed the bigger the tumor road. I got to a place though it was sticking out on her side. We kept it quite a few of the people here knew it trying to see what would happen. On and on it went. Finally when I come down from Canada from where I let the Lord let me lead that tribe of Indians to Christ and going back to baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus this spring the Lord will now come down and it's time for to go when I was in New York or down here to have another opera to have the operation or be examined for the last time. I went on to New York and when I come back, I stopped in here and went up after I had the meeting here, the last meeting. I went up there and called her from Brother Woods and she said, "Bill, I can't even stand my clothes to touch it. It was just way out like this on her side then." And her leg on that side, she could just hobble along. The worst week she had ever had. Now, she's sitting there listening at me. Worst week she had ever had. And she said, "I've got to go day after tomorrow for that examination." I thought, "Oh, God, if they cut it out, they'll keep us from going home at Christmas." And I done told the people I'd be there. And I said, "What a time. Oh my." I thought if tell him if he's going to operate, we'll let it go a little longer to after Christmas. Then I got thinking it might be malignant. And back over here, you know, that's a bad thing. Run back into the kidneys. If it straight goes malignant, it kill you. So then I thought, what can I do? and immedi said well now you call me said the day that I got in Streetport which would be the day after that when I got in Streetport she had to go for the examin and um so she said wait till you have your first night at at and then come back cuz the difference two hours in time then call me when you come back at the meeting I'll tell you what I've got to do and I said all right so I went on and the next morning before left I was going to get Billy and Lois they're both sitting present and always we got an old stool there that brother Palm recovered for us sure not long ago and we always get around that stool and pray whenever we're old ottoman like you know foot stool whenever we get around there pray when I'm going on a meeting we ask God to help us and I've been up there a couple days and I I was lonesome the house the kids gone her gone you know many of you know I had to go through that one time go back to an empty house only I buried that wife home and I it all over again and I got out I thought well I'll pray and then go pick up Billy Loris and go on. So I got down to pray. I said, "Lord, I miss them this morning around here." I said, "I pray that you'll help them and bless them. May we come back to this place again." And now I said, "They're out there because that you sent me there on a vision and you fulfilled it. Now I'm wanting to wait to see what you're going to tell me to do next." I said, "I'll pray for be merciful to her." And I said, "Help me in the meeting down there." And then I kept I said, "Lord, don't let it be malignant and let that doctor wait till after the first year to take it out. I I just hate to see her." I said, "Lord, she didn't mean what she did that morning. She didn't mean that." I said, "Lord, not one time has she ever said one word about me going in the meeting months or whatever it was. Not one time has she ever opened her mouth about it. She's always sent my clothes to the cleaners and washed my shirts and had everything ready to go on a meeting. Then she wonders how she can serve God. You women, as you serve your husband, you serve God, of course. And now, and then when I come in all tired and wore out, people coming from everywhere. I'd have to go out somewhere on a fishing trip or hunt trip. Well, many women would have blowed up at that. What she do? Got my hunting clothes ready for me to go. let me go. I said, Lord, she didn't mean that now. I said, she's had to be cut open three times on account of she's a Syrian. And I said, I Lord, I I hate to see her have to do it again. Just then I heard something in the room. I looked up and a voice said, "Stand up." Said, "Now, whatever you say, that's the way it'll be." Now, wait a minute. I said before the doctor's hand shall touch her, the hand of God shall take the tumor away and it won't even be found. That settled it to me. &gt;&gt; I never called her. We went that long, went got Billy Lewis, went shreport. Next night I called her, she's happy. She said, "Bill, I want to tell you now here she is and she can verify this." I had to hob her way over there. went in the room with the nurse and Mrs. Norma put her clothes on for the gown for the examination. The doctor came out and she could hardly get on the table. The tumor hanging up there so big and when she the doctor come in was talking to her and he come over to raise back the sheet to touch her and just before he touched her it left and the doctor didn't know which side it was on. He said, "Wait a minute." With the draw diagrams and all the pictures and everything else, he couldn't find one trace of it. &gt;&gt; He examined her over and over, he said, "I might not be able to explain it, but Miss Brandon, that tumor isn't there, &gt;&gt; and she's never had one symptom of it sent." &gt;&gt; What was it? Notice just exactly the way it's saying. before the doctor's hand can touch it. &gt;&gt; One split second in his hand would have touched it. &gt;&gt; How perfect is the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now there's my wife and we're both before God. But before the doctor's hand could even touch her body on the road coming to her like that, something happened. the tumor left &gt;&gt; and they couldn't he he said I believe it was when he sweetheart I want to reassure you Miss Brandon is that right the way he said it that's right &gt;&gt; that that tumor isn't there &gt;&gt; you don't have any tumor &gt;&gt; what was it just exactly according to the word of the Lord that was &gt;&gt; amen that's the fifth time five is a number of grace a number of f a th2. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no more doubt in my mind. &gt;&gt; I know what the third pole is and I know what it does. Now be a rever. Just keep quiet. The hour will soon arrive where God is going to do some great things for us. Amen. Let the church say amen. &gt;&gt; God is going to do some great things for us. How many believe that? How many receive that today? The musicians come. Let's bow our heads. Thank the Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we receive this word today.
