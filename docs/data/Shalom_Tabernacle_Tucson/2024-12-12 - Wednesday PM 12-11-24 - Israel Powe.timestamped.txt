[22:27] it into your hands in the name of the
[22:28] Lord Lord Jesus Christ and the church
[22:30] said amen God bless you may be seated
[22:34] title of the message tonight is
[22:36] believing is seeing amen and uh you know
[22:42] we just uh we lost a real soldier in the
[22:45] gospel in our brother Wesco here a few
[22:48] weeks ago and like it is many times I
[22:51] know maybe we didn't I know I didn't
[22:53] appreciate him as much as I should have
[22:56] while he was here with us and remember
[22:58] when we got the news that brother Wesco
[23:00] had passed I was looking at YouTube and
[23:03] looking up some old brother Wesco videos
[23:05] and one of the things he said that
[23:07] struck me was he said the world says sin
[23:11] is believing but the believer says
[23:13] believing is
[23:15] sin and I just thought wow what a
[23:18] profound statement that was that for us
[23:21] believing is sin we uh we look for those
[23:24] things that cannot be seen but yet are
[23:27] still the truth and so I I like that I
[23:31] like to listen to people that know what
[23:35] they're talking about can you say Amen
[23:36] to that tonight I I want to take
[23:38] Financial advice brother brother brother
[23:41] Israel I want to take Financial advice
[23:44] from people that's got a lot of
[23:45] money I don't want I don't want some
[23:48] broke guy giving me Financial advice I I
[23:51] want to talk to somebody that knows what
[23:52] they talking about and I like to take
[23:55] business advice from people that's been
[23:57] successful in business business I
[23:58] remember uh last year I went to a little
[24:01] leadership conference in Atlanta and the
[24:03] man that got up there who spoke uh was a
[24:06] man that had went to college on a debate
[24:09] scholarship and he had uh had done so
[24:12] well with that that actually Ronald
[24:14] Reagan put him on his cabinet he he went
[24:17] to work for the White House and was on
[24:19] Ronald Reagan's cabinet and then when he
[24:21] got done with that he started four or
[24:22] five businesses and sold them all off
[24:25] and was very successful and and so when
[24:27] this man t I I'd listened to what he had
[24:30] to say because he had the proof was in
[24:31] the pudding so to speak and and uh uh
[24:35] then the next time I went to a
[24:36] leadership conference they had a guy
[24:38] there that his claim to fame was he'd
[24:40] worked for Hard Rock Cafe for 15 years
[24:43] and and uh he come in and pretty much
[24:45] just told us what Hard Rock Cafe did and
[24:49] uh I didn't listen to him he hadn't done
[24:50] anything all he did was work for
[24:51] somebody else and told me what they told
[24:54] him and I want a motivational speaker to
[24:57] be somebody that's a something brother
[24:59] John I I want a motivational speaker to
[25:01] be somebody that's motivated thems you
[25:03] see what I'm saying Saints and I I want
[25:05] Fitness advice from somebody that's in
[25:07] shape I I don't like it when the I don't
[25:11] like it when the Surgeon General looks
[25:13] like they're going to pass out with a
[25:14] heart attack I I want I want some I want
[25:17] them to look healthy if they're going if

[25:30] somebody who's got a great
[25:32] marriage all right somebody knows what
[25:34] they're doing somebody knows what
[25:36] they're talking about and that's why I
[25:39] believe this message
[25:41] today because it's not just words on a
[25:44] paper it actually produced the life in
[25:47] the sheath offering that he was talking
[25:50] about and and not only did it produce a
[25:52] life in William brandom but I I found
[25:54] that when you did what William brandham
[25:56] said it produced the same life in me
[25:59] amen I I I like that and the Bible said
[26:02] not to be just hearers of the word but
[26:04] to be doers of the word and I don't want
[26:06] to just hear a book somebody wrote about
[26:08] the gospel I want to see somebody that
[26:11] demonstrates the gospel I want to see
[26:13] somebody that that does what the gospel
[26:15] says do and not only did what he say
[26:18] come to pass in his own Ministry but
[26:21] what he said come to pass in my own life
[26:24] when I did it amen can you say Amen to
[26:27] that tonight am and not only my life but
[26:30] in anyone's life when you when you meet
[26:32] the qualifications that's located in the
[26:35] word you get the same outcome right amen
[26:39] when I did what he said I got the
[26:41] results he promised that I'd
[26:43] get come on somebody tonight when when I
[26:46] did what the Bible said when I did what
[26:48] the message said I got the results that
[26:50] the word said I would get amen it wasn't
[26:53] just somebody writing a book about God
[26:55] it wasn't just somebody's ideas about
[26:57] God it was somebody who lived the life
[26:59] of God and I can stand with a man like
[27:03] that amen now I want you to notice I'm
[27:06] going to pull over here just for a
[27:08] second and a little something I talked
[27:10] about last Thursday in Mesa but in 1st
[27:12] Samuel the 8th chapter uh it was and we
[27:15] won't turn there for time sake tonight
[27:17] but we find in the 1st Samuel the 8th
[27:18] chapter that all the Elders of Israel
[27:20] called together all the people and they
[27:23] said unto Samuel they told him we want
[27:26] uh a king to reign over us they said
[27:29] you're too old and your sons they don't
[27:31] follow in your footsteps and they're
[27:33] they're not doing right and they're not
[27:35] behaving right and you're too old and
[27:37] all the other kings have got all the
[27:38] other nations have got a king and we
[27:40] want a king also and and Samuel asked
[27:43] him have I ever begged you for money or
[27:45] have I ever you know asked for your
[27:46] flocks have I ever taken your kids
[27:48] captive and used them for my own have I
[27:50] ever done any of those things they said
[27:51] no but we want a king
[27:54] anyhow and and and God said go ahead s
[27:58] and let them have it don't be upset they
[28:00] haven't rejected you they've rejected me
[28:02] he
[28:11] said they haven't rejected you but
[28:14] they've rejected me can I get a little
[28:15] bit more volume on the speaker up here
[28:18] please and so God said let them have
[28:21] what they're asking you for but you tell
[28:23] them how it's going to be when they do
[28:25] it and so Samuel told him he said I'm
[28:27] going to do do it we're going to give
[28:28] you a king but just know that he's going
[28:30] to take your flocks he's going to take
[28:32] your herds he's going to take your
[28:34] Vineyards he's going to take your corn
[28:36] he's going to take your children he's
[28:38] going to take your sons and daughters
[28:40] and he's going to use them for his
[28:41] servants and his Warriors He's going to
[28:43] take all your money he's going to take
[28:45] everything you got he's going to take
[28:46] your freedom and they and and it's going
[28:49] to happen and and they say well we want
[28:51] a king anyhow cuz we're going to be just
[28:53] like everybody else is see the people
[28:55] had the best thing that they could get
[28:57] they had Vindicated Prophet with thus
[28:59] sayith the Lord they had the word of God
[29:01] for their day and everything that he had
[29:03] told them had come to pass everything
[29:05] that he had promised had come to pass
[29:07] and he didn't take any of their stuff he
[29:09] didn't take any of their crops he didn't
[29:10] take any of their freedom but because of
[29:12] the pressure to be like everybody else
[29:15] they wanted a king anyways well saints
[29:17] were not like everybody else we're a
[29:20] royal people A A peculiar people is that
[29:24] right Saints we don't have to fit in
[29:26] with what everybody else is doing we
[29:27] don't have to run our church the way
[29:29] everybody else runs it we don't have to
[29:30] have all these programs that everybody
[29:32] else has amen but we got to go the way
[29:35] God leads us amen but they'd rather be
[29:38] like everybody else than to be free
[29:40] Saints they'd rather F fit in than to
[29:43] have their crops and to have their lands
[29:45] and to have their children they'd rather
[29:47] desire to be like everybody else than
[29:49] they turned their back on God when they
[29:51] did
[29:52] it now brother BR says this in rejected
[29:54] King he said and there has never been it
[29:57] has never never been the will of God it
[29:59] never was the will of God or never will
[30:02] be the will of God for a man to rule
[30:04] over one another God rules over man God
[30:08] is our ruler our King is that right now
[30:11] notice when they walked away from the
[30:13] message of their day they thought that
[30:16] Samuel was all washed up they thought he
[30:18] was too old to do them any good and they
[30:21] thought his sons wasn't doing right and
[30:23] they couldn't take his place and Samuel
[30:25] uh he got old and and they didn't think
[30:27] he was he was uh good enough anymore and
[30:29] they started looking around at what
[30:31] everybody else is doing and if you
[30:33] follow the present stage of my Ministry
[30:35] brother brand talks about how Demus did
[30:37] the same thing to Paul and we find out
[30:39] that brother Bram was typing into his
[30:40] own Ministry where they thought he was
[30:42] washed up and they thought that the Lord
[30:43] wasn't dealing with him anymore and they
[30:45] thought because he had lost some of his
[30:47] popularity that God wasn't with him
[30:50] anymore but it was just the word being
[30:52] Vindicated they did it to Jesus they did
[30:55] it to Paul they did it to brother
[30:56] brandom man when Jesus was feeding the
[30:59] 5,000 the Loaves and the fishes he had
[31:01] all kind of people following him but
[31:03] when he gave them the word they walked
[31:05] away is that right Amen brother Brown
[31:09] says this he said men try to seek honor
[31:11] from one another he says and and they
[31:14] honor one another and they dishonor God
[31:16] by doing so he said we try to make big
[31:19] people among us and we're no big people
[31:22] and little people we all little people
[31:24] can you say Amen tonight Saints there's
[31:26] no big people no little people we're all
[31:28] little true all right there's only one
[31:32] big among us and that's our
[31:34] Lord now is this right tonight
[31:37] Saints and we see that somewhat
[31:39] happening in the message
[31:41] today there is no reason there was no
[31:45] reason for those people to doubt
[31:48] Samuel everything he said had come to
[31:51] pass everything God had done through him
[31:53] had come to pass exactly the way God
[31:55] said it there was no reason he hadn't
[31:57] taken anything from him he hadn't done
[31:59] anything bad there was no reason for him
[32:03] to doubt Samuel even though Samuel's
[32:06] Sons weren't doing right and they
[32:07] weren't walking in his ways it it was it
[32:10] wasn't the people's job to correct that
[32:12] it was God's job to correct that but
[32:15] because of the pressure to be like
[32:17] everybody else the people uh they they
[32:19] wanted this King
[32:21] anyway it was God's job God had a plan
[32:25] for those people God had a way that he
[32:27] was going to to do God had something for
[32:29] them but they wanted to get ahead of God
[32:31] and it cost
[32:33] them and we find that they blamed it on
[32:35] Samuel being old and they blamed it on
[32:37] his sons not walking in his ways but
[32:40] actually they were just doing what they
[32:42] really wanted to do
[32:44] anyway and that was just as good an
[32:47] excuse as anything else and we find it
[32:49] in churches many times where something
[32:51] will rise up and people want to do
[32:53] something there's somebody they want to
[32:55] start another church anyways and they're
[32:57] just looking for an excuse something to
[32:59] rise up that they can use as an excuse
[33:01] to do what they already wanted to do
[33:03] anyway that's true and rather than
[33:05] letting the Lord work it all out let the
[33:07] Lord take care of it they try to get
[33:09] ahead of God and go do something out on
[33:11] their
[33:11] own now is this right tonight Saints and
[33:15] in this message we find this there is no
[33:19] reason for us to doubt anything that
[33:22] that Prophet said there's no reason
[33:25] everything he said Has Come come to pass
[33:28] exactly the way he said it so we got no
[33:31] reason to doubt any of the rest of it
[33:34] everything he said happened exactly the
[33:36] way he said it would happen and he
[33:37] didn't beg us for money he he didn't he
[33:40] didn't live one way in front of us and
[33:42] another way in front of everybody else
[33:44] he was he was the same man all the time
[33:46] he he didn't run some kind of a halfway
[33:48] program Saints he he didn't beg for
[33:51] money he didn't have these big programs
[33:52] to support he didn't put these big
[33:54] doctrines and stuff that we can't keep
[33:56] up with on us
[33:58] is that right tonight Saints we're not
[34:00] preaching our own message tonight Saints
[34:02] we're preaching the message of William
[34:06] brand and we don't do anything and we
[34:09] don't push ourself up by pushing brother
[34:11] brandom
[34:13] down see God gave us thus sayith the
[34:16] Lord he gave us a sure word of Prophecy
[34:19] and we don't find anywhere where what
[34:21] that Prophet said
[34:22] failed and we don't find it Saints it's
[34:24] just not there it wasn't a dictator that
[34:27] required everybody does everything the
[34:29] same way he said each church is
[34:31] Sovereign and is that what the prophet
[34:33] said amen but when he went off the scene
[34:37] always man has to have something that
[34:40] they can look at instead of taking God
[34:43] at his
[34:46] word brother R said that man wants
[34:48] somebody that can do their religion for
[34:52] him rejected King he said now that's the
[34:54] kind of man that the people like to
[34:56] choose today the people does not seem to
[34:58] be satisfied with the way that God has
[35:01] placed his church to be governed and
[35:03] controlled by the Holy Spirit okay they
[35:06] wanted somebody some man some
[35:08] denomination some certain people to
[35:10] govern the church and that they'll not
[35:13] be able to throw themselves completely
[35:15] into God's hand to be spiritual and to
[35:17] be led by the Holy Spirit Saints we
[35:19] don't want to be that church tonight we
[35:21] want to be thrown into the hands of God
[35:24] helplessly dependent on the leadership
[35:26] of the Holy Spirit tonight he said they
[35:29] want somebody to do their religion for
[35:31] them somebody that'll tell them just how
[35:33] to do it and all about it so this man
[35:35] seemed to suit the place exactly because
[35:38] he was a very intellectual man and it's
[35:40] a whole lot like today why we choose
[35:42] such people to control our churches to
[35:45] control the Church of God nothing that I
[35:47] have to say against it but just merely
[35:49] to make a point that it's not it is not
[35:51] it was not and it will never be the will
[35:54] of God for such to be God is to rule his
[35:57] people people to govern each individual
[36:00] and Saints what we see today is too many
[36:02] people repeating what other people say
[36:04] and not what brother brandom said and
[36:06] they'll hear one big name preacher say
[36:08] it and they say well he said it so that
[36:10] must be true and they never check the
[36:12] message for themselves true and so what
[36:15] you find is people just repeating the
[36:17] same thing they heard somebody else say
[36:19] but we're responsible as individuals to
[36:22] check it by the word
[36:25] tonight now see this message that We Got
[36:27] Tonight this wasn't somebody just had
[36:29] some good ideas it wasn't just a book of
[36:32] theology a book of theology doesn't
[36:35] produce what this message produced amen
[36:38] this was the Living Word made flesh and
[36:40] dwelt Among Us amen this message is the
[36:44] message that will turn the hearts of the
[36:46] children back to the faith of the
[36:48] original fathers and it's not just
[36:50] someone writing a book about it amen
[36:53] it's a manifestation of the word of God
[36:55] in this last day he said it would happen
[36:58] and it happened he promised that it
[37:00] would happen and it's happened just like
[37:01] he
[37:04] said and so we read it in the Bible and
[37:07] then we see it lived Out Among Us we see
[37:10] it manifested among us and that's got to
[37:13] be our goal tonight Saints is to read it
[37:15] in the Bible and then see it
[37:19] manifested amen this was a man that
[37:22] could make God alive before the people
[37:27] amen is that what you want your life to
[37:28] be amen somebody that can see the Living
[37:31] God in you that the sinner can see the
[37:34] Living God in you that the unbeliever
[37:36] can see the Living God in you that the
[37:38] church member can see the Living God in
[37:41] you that's my desire tonight Saint not
[37:45] just somebody writing a book brother
[37:46] said hear you him he said someone came
[37:48] to me a Lutheran College not long ago
[37:51] and they said they want to accept the
[37:52] Holy Ghost he said 400 and something in
[37:55] this Lutheran college has already got
[37:57] the Holy Ghost and they said brother
[37:59] brandom we heard all about the gifts and
[38:01] we went to someone that wrote a book and
[38:04] he said I hadn't got any of those we
[38:06] just wrote about
[38:08] them he said sure you can write about
[38:11] them but are they
[38:13] real he said sure there're is real as
[38:16] God is real it's his word amen that's
[38:19] what we want tonight say it's not
[38:20] somebody writes about it not even
[38:22] somebody can read it in the message but
[38:24] we want to live it tonight Saints not
[38:26] hearers of the word but doers of the
[38:30] word So for anybody that feels like they
[38:32] got the authority to tell tear down this
[38:34] messenger I would just ask you this
[38:37] where's your Pillar of Fire
[38:39] at cuz I I know where his was where
[38:43] where's your worldwide Healing

[38:56] your visions came to pass cuz I know how
[38:59] many of his came to pass all of them

[39:06] them how many world rde revivals were
[39:09] you the Catalyst for cuz I know how many
[39:12] he
[39:13] started so I'll take the words of the
[39:16] seventh Church age messenger over the
[39:18] words of a newspaper reporter any day of
[39:20] the
[39:24] week I'll take it over a backsliding
[39:27] preacher words I'll take it over
[39:29] Google's words I'll take brother bram's
[39:32] opinion over anybody else's
[39:36] facts I'll even take his
[39:39] ideas over my
[39:41] ideas oh come on somebody tonight over
[39:44] my own ideas that's Our obligation to
[39:47] the word oh I think this right here but
[39:49] when I read it in the word I got to say
[39:51] what the word
[39:54] says glory to God tonight say come on
[39:58] somebody so I'm saying all of this to
[40:01] drive home one point tonight that
[40:04] there's somebody out there right that
[40:06] knows more than we
[40:10] do there's somebody out there that knows
[40:14] what's around the
[40:15] corner there's somebody whose ways are
[40:18] higher than my
[40:20] ways there's somebody out there that
[40:24] that knows the end from the beginning
[40:27] now I don't know the end from the
[40:28] beginning you don't know the end from
[40:30] the beginning but I know who knows the
[40:32] end from the
[40:33] beginning there's somebody out there
[40:36] that knows the exact message that we
[40:39] would need for this
[40:40] day do y'all believe that do y' believe
[40:43] the Lord knew what day we'd be living in
[40:45] today and and and he knew the the
[40:47] challenges that we'd be facing he knew
[40:50] the trials we'd be up against he knew
[40:52] the Devils that'd be in the land today
[40:53] he knew how corrupt everything would be
[40:55] today he knew all of it
[40:57] and he provided us a message to combat
[41:01] that now is that what the Bible said
[41:04] when an enemy comes in like a flood he
[41:07] said I'll raise up a standard against
[41:09] them this is the standard Saints amen
[41:13] amen so the message is enough amen thank
[41:18] you Jesus he knows what it'll take for
[41:20] you and I to be an overcomer in this day
[41:23] he knows what it'll take and provided
[41:25] that for us amen and that person is our
[41:29] Lord Jesus
[41:32] Christ he sees what we can't see he
[41:36] knows what we don't know his ways are
[41:39] higher than our ways his mind is higher
[41:42] than our mind his thoughts oh God are
[41:46] higher than our
[41:48] thoughts and we don't have to see to
[41:53] believe we can just believe to see
[41:58] is that right Saints see there was Falls
[42:01] at the end of the
[42:02] river and we're all going down the same
[42:05] boat we're all going down the same river
[42:07] and there's Falls at the end and we not
[42:10] might not be able to see the Falls but
[42:12] the Lord let us know about the falls and
[42:15] we believe what the Lord says so even
[42:18] though we can't see them we believe and
[42:20] by faith we can't
[42:22] see amen you know you don't have to
[42:25] touch the stove to know that it's hot
[42:27] you can take somebody else's word for
[42:29] that now is that right
[42:33] Saints the Lord knows what's around to
[42:36] been we might not see the trouble that
[42:39] we're going into we might not know the
[42:41] trouble that our family's headed into we
[42:43] might not know the trouble that our
[42:44] church is fixing to go into we might not
[42:47] know those things but there is somebody
[42:49] that
[42:51] does we don't have to know everything
[42:54] going on in the world today but we
[42:56] believe
[42:58] so by faith we can see where we're
[43:01] headed we don't know all the problems
[43:03] that we're going to come up against in
[43:04] our lives I don't know what kind of
[43:06] problems I'm going to fight tomorrow I
[43:08] don't know what kind of problems you're
[43:10] going to fight tomorrow amen I don't
[43:13] know what the future holds but I know
[43:15] who holds the
[43:19] future it's like the man that couldn't
[43:21] understand Divine Healing Hebrews
[43:23] chapter 6 brother Bram said he couldn't
[43:25] understand Divine Healing he said but he
[43:27] had a lantern in his hand and he said I
[43:29] want to say something preacher I just
[43:30] can't accept that cuz I can't see

[44:45] commanded to walk in the light as he is
[44:48] in the light and you make one step in
[44:51] the light and then when you got the
[44:52] light with you the light will shine unto
[44:55] the perfect day it'll keep the path
[44:57] before you brother Brown
[44:59] said oh Saints we got a lantern in the
[45:03] church he said if you just keep walking
[45:05] the light will keep going with you but
[45:07] you got to keep walking amen we don't
[45:10] know what the trouble is we don't know
[45:11] what we're going to fight against but we
[45:13] got to keep walking and if we keep
[45:15] walking the light will keep going with
[45:16] us and every step you take the light
[45:18] will take a step with you thank you
[45:21] Lord amen and I don't know everything I
[45:24] got to go to before I get home but I
[45:27] know home is there and I know the light
[45:29] will lead the way
[45:33] yes we just follow the light that we got
[45:37] Saints fear not we might have it all
[45:40] figured out but I'm so glad that God has
[45:43] a special position yes I'm so glad that
[45:47] he elevates some to a higher level that
[45:50] can see further talked about the
[45:53] eagle he he had wings he could go higher
[45:57] but then he said it wouldn't be no good
[45:58] if you had wings and go high but you
[46:00] couldn't see once you got up there and
[46:02] he said that eagle he had the wings he
[46:03] could go high but then when he got up
[46:05] there he can see far
[46:07] off amen is that the prophet we had in
[46:09] this day amen his job was to go up and
[46:13] see and come back and bring his word of
[46:15] what he saw amen oh my and I might not
[46:20] be called to go up high and see like
[46:21] that but I am called to believe it and
[46:24] by believing it I can see it
[46:27] yes thank you
[46:30] Lord
[46:31] amen I'm so glad saints that God sent a
[46:35] prophet yes that'll help me see what I
[46:39] can't
[46:40] see oh my that'll help me understand
[46:44] things that my mind can't understand
[46:47] amen that way I'm not shocked when
[46:48] things happen cuz I know because
[46:50] something saw it before me and told me
[46:52] it come to pass I'm not shocked by what
[46:55] I see in the world today he said it
[46:57] would happen is that right Saints we
[47:00] know these things are going to happen we
[47:02] know it's going to get
[47:04] worse in this
[47:08] world I'm so glad that God uses these
[47:12] offices
[47:14] amen amen it's not just a prophit though
[47:18] amen God has other offices that he uses
[47:21] I was look at this Revelation book of
[47:23] symbols let's let's read here what
[47:24] brother Brown said nowbody Say Amen to
[47:26] the word or do we
[47:28] not Revelation book assembl brother said
[47:30] your pastor when he stands here on the
[47:33] platform ministering the word of God he
[47:36] is God's angel to the
[47:40] church pastor I already got an amen from
[47:43] you on that he said a messenger to the
[47:46] church he said therefore a pastor should
[47:49] never leave that word but stay with but
[47:52] but stay straight with the word because
[47:55] he's feeding the shepherd's place
[47:57] oh my are you thankful tonight Saints
[48:01] amen cuz the word pastor means Shepherd
[48:04] look it up and find out if that ain't
[48:05] right a pastor is a shepherd and the
[48:08] Holy Ghost has made him overseer of a
[48:11] certain flock to feed them with what the
[48:13] word of
[48:16] God Amen and God puts men in certain
[48:20] places to help see what we can't see do
[48:24] y' believe that tonight Saints amen
[48:26] there be sometimes maybe you don't
[48:28] understand what's being said maybe you
[48:29] don't understand why it's being said but
[48:31] it's something that the church needs to
[48:33] be preparing
[48:41] for so even though we might not be able
[48:43] to see it God uses men yes what it takes
[48:49] to overcome or overcome our belief
[48:52] excuse me what it takes to overcome all
[48:54] belief our faith boy that's a title
[48:56] isn't it
[48:58] what it takes to overcome all belief all
[49:00] unbelief or faith brother BR say this
[49:03] first is Apostles prophets teachers
[49:07] evangelists pastors those five god-given
[49:09] gifts in the church so each one of you
[49:12] who has a Godly Pastor has a gift from
[49:15] God in your
[49:16] church now is that what the word said is
[49:19] that what a prophet
[49:21] taught he said a Shepherd pastor means a
[49:24] Shepherd to watch over the flock to
[49:26] teach them the word of God he said then
[49:29] there's these other nine different
[49:31] spiritual gifts that should be operating
[49:34] in the church to keep the church
[49:37] clean like the ananas and safaris and so
[49:40] forth the spirit of God rise up and call
[49:43] somebody
[49:48] out and tell them that they're living
[49:50] wrong and rebuke that sin openly and
[49:54] that's what the holy spirit is in the

[50:43] the
[50:45] Lord the Saints you might not agree with
[50:47] that but it wasn't me that said
[50:51] that so even though we might not be able
[50:54] to
[50:55] see go God uses different offices
[50:59] different gifts different manifestations
[51:03] to warn us that there's Falls ahead on
[51:05] the
[51:06] river he he anoints his servants to tell
[51:10] us of things to
[51:11] come he's he's telling of things to come
[51:14] and we not we might not be able to see
[51:16] it ourselves but we can believe it and
[51:20] by believeing we can see amen one last
[51:24] thing that God uses and I'm G I'm going

[51:33] St John the 16th
[51:38] chapter y'all love the Lord tonight I'm
[51:41] thankful for these things Sint amen I
[51:44] that means I ain't got to have all the
[51:46] answers and I ain't got to have it all
[51:48] figured out I can just take a step and
[51:51] see what the light leads me to and I can
[51:53] take another step and see how the light
[51:55] leads me amen

[52:38] you believe that
[52:40] tonight God gives us his own life his
[52:44] own Spirit to lead and guide the
[52:49] believer and the spirit will show you
[52:52] things to
[52:54] come it'll check us when we need to be
[52:57] checked it'll stop us when we need to be
[53:01] stopped if we're sincere if if we're
[53:03] sincere and we sincerely want to know
[53:05] the will of the Lord and we sincerely
[53:08] want God's Direction it is the lamp that
[53:11] we hold that lights our path some things
[53:14] can appear good on the outside but on
[53:17] the inside you know it ain't
[53:19] right it looks good it sounds good but
[53:24] something about it checks you oh thank
[53:27] God for it Saints it's the Holy Spirit
[53:29] showing you things to
[53:32] come it'll guide us when we don't
[53:35] understand there I say it'll make you do
[53:38] things you don't
[53:41] understand there'll be things that sound
[53:43] good but you know they're wrong they
[53:45] just feel
[53:47] wrong we might not can see it but we can
[53:51] believe
[53:55] it am
[53:59] amen now in closing I just say this and
[54:02] the musicians you can go ahead and come
[54:05] let's see what time I got 36 minutes
[54:08] Pastor some kind of new
[54:12] record present stage of my Ministry
[54:15] brother BR says this now see Saints we
[54:18] we can't see all this with our natural
[54:20] eyes we we we don't know everything that
[54:23] the future holds but we live by faith
[54:27] amen amen and we believe sir amen pres
[54:31] stage of my minist he said here some
[54:32] time ago I was explaining it I was
[54:35] looking at a television picture just uh
[54:37] sister Joy just something on your
[54:39] heart I was looking at a television
[54:41] picture where they let a man down I
[54:44] think two miles or a mile deep in the
[54:47] ocean and they had Ray lights that went
[54:50] out and they was showing marine life and
[54:54] there come fish by that horrible looking
[54:57] creatures he said that it's it's
[54:59] midnight ink black down there and they
[55:03] had uh phosphorus on their nose and they
[55:07] had no eyes and now they have to be fed
[55:11] so it looked like to find their food
[55:14] they were guided with another sense not
[55:17] sight because they didn't have eyes
[55:20] couldn't use them down there but they
[55:23] were guided with another sense that they
[55:25] could contact to food and I thought if
[55:29] I could have control of that little fish
[55:32] with my sight how much greater could I
[55:35] Supply his food and lead him
[55:38] places he said how much greater my sight
[55:42] is than his radar that he contacts see
[55:46] and I thought if I could just lead him
[55:49] then it come to me if I could only
[55:52] surrender myself to God how much greater
[55:56] is the sight and senses of God who could
[56:00] guide us much more than our
[56:03] eyes then if that little fishy could
[56:05] never come up to the top of the water
[56:07] like other fish because he's pressurized
[56:10] you bring him up he would explode no
[56:12] more than we can go up higher and keep
[56:15] from exploding we are pressurized for
[56:17] the place that we live but now if that
[56:21] little fishy if that little fish could
[56:23] ever come up here and be me
[56:26] would he ever want to be that little
[56:28] fish again down in the midnight
[56:30] Blackness he'd never want to be a fish
[56:32] no more because he's something greater
[56:35] than a fish he's a man his senses are
[56:38] greater his understanding is greater his
[56:41] intelligence is
[56:43] supreme then multiply that by 10
[56:46] million and then you get what it is when
[56:49] you pass from this into the presence of
[56:51] God Yonder where the human being is so
[56:54] much farther than what what we are here
[56:57] you never want to be a human being like
[56:59] this no more down in this pest House of
[57:02] sickness and Corruption it's been that
[57:04] in my heart that I've tried these 30
[57:07] years to preach the gospel around the
[57:09] world to tell people that there is a
[57:13] heaven to gain and there's a hell to
[57:15] shun and there's a God that loves you
[57:18] and a redeeming power that's laying
[57:21] ready to pick you up at any time that
[57:25] you're ready to receive
[57:27] it oh I'm ready to receive it tonight
[57:31] sints I want to be
[57:33] led the way brother Bram talked about if
[57:36] he had the ability with his eyesight to
[57:38] lead that little fish multiply that
[57:40] times 10 million that's how God can lead
[57:43] us can we bow our heads Lord
