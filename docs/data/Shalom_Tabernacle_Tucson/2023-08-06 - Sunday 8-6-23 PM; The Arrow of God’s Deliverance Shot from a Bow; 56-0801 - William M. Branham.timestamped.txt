[35:21] we're going right straight into it and
[35:22] expect God to give us one of the
[35:24] greatest Services
[35:31] when the brother walks to the platform
[35:33] that the Holy Spirit just sweeps over
[35:36] this building and everything every sick
[35:39] person that's ever the tank will be to
[35:40] go knocked by the car student will be
[35:42] healed
[35:43] now how many loves him with all your
[35:47] heart with all your soul with all your
[35:49] mind amen
[35:52] now be ready and be in prayer now while
[35:55] we reach down off this blessed old Bible
[35:57] over the book of Kings we read this
[36:01] and he said open the window each one
[36:05] and he opens
[36:07] then said Elijah shoot and be shot and
[36:11] he says this is the era of the Lord's
[36:15] delivery
[36:16] may he add His blessings to the reading
[36:18] of the word the era of God's Deliverance
[36:23] of all
[36:24] now
[36:26] you know no matter how mysterious it
[36:30] seems God always keeps his word
[36:33] no matter how
[36:35] unreasonable it may seem to people God
[36:39] keeps his word
[36:41] that's right and if God makes a promise
[36:44] of anything God will keep that drunk you
[36:48] and I make a promise we we break it
[36:51] because we don't need to have to do it
[36:52] but sometimes circumstances causes us to
[36:55] do it but when God being uh infant then
[37:00] he knows all the future from the
[37:02] beginning and he can't he don't make a
[37:04] promise that he he knows what's going to
[37:06] happen and he always keeps his promise
[37:09] sometimes it seems like it's it's
[37:11] ridiculous the way that he would go
[37:14] around about to keep his promise but God
[37:17] always says how strange as the people my
[37:20] thought in the days of Noah when he was
[37:22] building away on an ark to save himself
[37:25] and his household that to be rain come
[37:28] down out of here but God Reigns it just
[37:31] the same
[37:31] and I'll think of Moses how that Moses
[37:36] standing up there on the mount by the
[37:38] side of this Burning Bush
[37:41] he lost all hopes of freedom
[37:44] didn't seem like that the freedom that
[37:46] the people is so gallantly stood for one
[37:49] time was ever going to happen
[37:53] but in the life of God standing for that
[37:57] Burning Bush Everything any changed
[38:00] I think it's the same today that many of
[38:04] us lose the sight of freedom I think
[38:08] here is a little boy sitting before me
[38:10] probably an infantile parallel little
[38:12] orange twisted up I look at a lady here
[38:16] with a white team sitting in front of me
[38:18] uh a probably a blind woman lovely young
[38:22] lady laying here on a little and
[38:26] maybe many of you there have cancer
[38:28] heart troubles and diseases that a storm
[38:31] to kill you but you lose all thoughts of
[38:35] Freedom as soon as the doctor says it's
[38:37] insurance
[38:39] why brother if we'd ever come in the
[38:42] presence of God like Moses did why it
[38:45] was a revolutionary why I was
[38:48] revolutionized when the in the life of
[38:52] that angel of God standing on that
[38:55] mountain that day everything that he
[38:58] wanted for his thought never would have
[39:00] happened come to be a reality and I
[39:03] think of men and women today whatever
[39:06] step into the light are the Holy Spirit
[39:08] under the function of God's spirit and
[39:12] the light of God's word everything that
[39:15] God has promised will illuminate to you
[39:17] and be real again
[39:20] why the reason Moses sailed in the first
[39:24] place here's what was the matter it was
[39:26] the lack of having what the burning bush
[39:28] has that's right and what's our failure
[39:32] today is life having what the Holy
[39:35] Spirit has and the Holy Spirit has all
[39:38] good things for us and if we receive the
[39:41] Holy Spirit then all things are possible
[39:43] and it's not only possible but promise
[39:46] good Jesus said ask the father anything
[39:50] in my name I'll do it that's right

[39:56] that's what you will it'll be given to
[39:58] you see when we step into the light of
[40:01] God's word with the unsure the Holy
[40:03] Spirit to shine the light on
[40:05] Brother The Impossible becomes little
[40:08] things in him God asked us to believe
[40:11] these words he stands the Holy Spirit to
[40:14] energize that word when it falls into it
[40:16] that's right
[40:18] and the Holy Spirit brings the word he
[40:22] energizes that and flesh is the same
[40:25] life of God's blessed Thomas foreign
[40:47] and
[40:49] in our text tonight the very uh
[40:54] outstanding text to me
[40:56] that land that had a great line of Kings
[41:00] since the death of Ahab and Elijah had
[41:03] told him of how he was going to die
[41:06] and what God was going to do because he
[41:09] was wicked and how The Jezebel was going
[41:13] to be fed to the dogs
[41:15] because if she did the evil thing that
[41:18] she had done
[41:19] and remember my brothers and sisters
[41:22] you'll reap watch your soul
[41:27] that's God's law that's God's law of
[41:30] nature your reap watch yourself do not
[41:33] dear people you hear Shreveport let this
[41:36] be a warning to you if you believe me to
[41:39] be God's servant listen the best thing
[41:42] for you to do around live Tabernacle and
[41:45] everywhere else is keep an old-fashioned
[41:47] prayer meeting doors and keep the unity
[41:50] of the spirit keep looking up and
[41:52] watching for their coming of the Lord
[41:54] keep all the Wilderness out of it no
[41:57] matter how bad it hurts

[56:17] it's used for God's program all right
[56:20] it was God's way the first way who made
[56:22] the airwaves and so forth but the devil
[56:25] just took it in perverted it
[56:27] solid for us
[56:29] Hollywood got over anything they get a
[56:31] hold of his Rockies of course it can't

[57:22] right then we call ourselves Christians
[57:26] and harmonize our souls such as that no
[57:30] one in the world
[57:31] [Music]
[57:32] or something patterns in our souls
[57:36] during meetings anymore because the
[57:38] world exams
[57:40] all right
[57:41] halfway wishy-washy
[57:44] oh my what a condition
[57:47] and the face of all that now to show you
[57:50] there's a hope
[57:51] this Old King George heard that the
[57:53] prophet was sick
[57:54] and he went on to visit
[57:56] and when he went to Disney he didn't
[57:58] come here Reverend he would come with
[58:01] respect
[58:02] he walked up he had enough of God about
[58:04] him to know that he must visit this
[58:06] Prophet with respect so they walked up
[58:09] and waffled me he said my father my
[58:13] father
[58:14] the Chariots of Israel and the horsemen
[58:17] thereof
[58:19] and when he did see that's the way you
[58:21] ought to get something from God don't
[58:23] come around a meeting like this to make
[58:25] fun don't come around and pack some kind
[58:27] of a tail from one place to another
[58:29] if you do that you'll never get over
[58:31] with God
[58:33] don't read the Bible to fuss about it
[58:35] read the Bible to live it
[58:38] right
[58:39] so then when he went down there anything
[58:43] he respected him he said my father my
[58:47] father
[58:48] the Terrace of Israel and the horse in
[58:51] other words my my father your word more
[58:53] than all the characters and all the
[58:56] horsemeness
[59:00] I'll stay tonight though Elijah was
[59:03] considered a holy Roar
[59:05] a fanatic by the modern world yet his
[59:09] presence in that nation was worth more
[59:12] than all of the horses and shared to
[59:14] have
[59:15] said tonight that a good old-fashioned
[59:19] Holy Ghost candy is more to protect us
[59:23] than all the atomic bombs that we could
[59:25] create in a million years
[59:29] respect
[59:32] he didn't go to say now hey holy war
[59:35] you know what my pastor just told me
[59:37] about you
[59:39] all right he didn't do that he walked
[59:41] down with respect and you went over me
[59:43] and because he come and approached it
[59:46] reverently God has respect you God said
[59:50] now
[59:51] still Elijah Rhymes up and Elijah rules
[59:54] up and they were just about ready in
[59:56] their back spreading conditions to be
[59:57] besieged by another country the syrians
[1:00:01] they were coming to get him and Elijah
[1:00:04] knew that but because this one man
[1:00:07] crumbled himself and come down before
[1:00:10] God
[1:00:11] and said oh my father
[1:00:13] how we need you God respected it and he
[1:00:18] respected Elijah and God respected him
[1:00:21] and if you respect God's Bible and God's
[1:00:24] holy spirit he'll respect you
[1:00:28] amen don't try to protect it or say it
[1:00:31] isn't thought just the reason that's all
[1:00:34] watching now
[1:00:36] and Elijah said go get your bowl
[1:00:43] the East is the way that Jesus Will Come
[1:00:47] I said not alive
[1:00:49] now I want you to put the air into place
[1:00:51] and draw back just as far as you can and
[1:00:55] he did he says shoot and when he's
[1:00:58] shocked what happened to everyone else
[1:01:01] he said get the error when he come back
[1:01:04] he said scratch the ground and he struck
[1:01:06] the ground three times and the prophet
[1:01:09] was wrong with him so why describe it
[1:01:11] more times than that why do you do
[1:01:13] something else about it strike it more
[1:01:15] time since you Struck it three times but
[1:01:17] you only had three victories
[1:01:19] if that's just about what the things
[1:01:21] happen tonight in the Christian church
[1:01:24] we are struck the era of God's
[1:01:27] Deliverance is that it was God sent the
[1:01:30] Arabs delivered to us
[1:01:32] the era of Deliverance is the holy
[1:01:34] spirit that's been sent shot from the
[1:01:37] soul of God's love right
[1:01:40] when eternity Perry was pulled together
[1:01:43] by the court of love God shut the hell
[1:01:45] out delivered into the church overhead
[1:01:48] City Hall
[1:01:49] hello
[1:01:50] and the church was dead in her hands
[1:01:55] the church was given into her hands the
[1:01:58] era of monsters
[1:02:01] amen the holy spirit will deliver the
[1:02:04] church out of any kind of the chaos he
[1:02:07] could get into
[1:02:09] it but what did they do with it they
[1:02:11] picked up the era and the struck three
[1:02:13] times
[1:02:15] King they struck the air like well we'll
[1:02:18] deal to church that's all right we'll
[1:02:21] teach theology that's all right we'll
[1:02:23] teach that college and have an
[1:02:24] organization that's just about as far as
[1:02:26] his son they struck short of many
[1:02:29] lessons
[1:02:30] and the church tonight
[1:02:34] the check tonight is still sharp
[1:02:39] there's a stuck out of the baptism of
[1:02:42] the Holy Ghost it's the power of
[1:02:45] delivered from singing It's such dark or
[1:02:48] you say I'm going to church
[1:02:50] [Music]

[1:03:16] you live about 10.
[1:03:23] oh they just don't say we got a chair we
[1:03:26] got a good teacher we got theology

[1:03:58] they had all kinds of signs wonders
[1:04:00] Miracles divers gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:02] everything they had it but we're
[1:04:05] stocking sharp with it the best of the
[1:04:07] Holy Ghost in the United States has come
[1:04:09] to the Gentiles in the Western countries
[1:04:10] and God shot their delivered to us and
[1:04:14] we have just about struck Among Us and

[1:04:30] strikeless it's given to each
[1:04:32] individuals to strike against the powers
[1:04:38] [Music]
[1:04:40] oh my word

[1:05:13] it's brought into the church line we
[1:05:15] talk about a historical God that's
[1:05:17] what's the matter tonight the church has
[1:05:19] been taught of some historical thing and
[1:05:21] not put it down to a present day what
[1:05:24] good is the god of Elijah if he is the
[1:05:27] same God tonight
[1:05:29] what good is a god of Moses that
[1:05:32] delivered the Hebrew children out of
[1:05:34] Egypt what good is that God in the
[1:05:36] history if he isn't the same God
[1:05:40] what good is the god that walks the base
[1:05:42] of Galilee back on Earth and Open the
[1:05:44] Eyes of a blindness and then condemn to
[1:05:46] speak in here heal the sick Deliverance
[1:05:48] if he is in the same job tonight what
[1:05:51] city is he that's right amen
[1:05:57] what good is he what's good does it do
[1:06:01] to get your boys to education or
[1:06:04] something on the history learn of all
[1:06:06] theology teach in the Bible then if you
[1:06:09] turn around and tell us
[1:06:12] and those things
[1:06:14] [Music]
[1:06:22] already out
[1:06:25] that's the same way as today with all of
[1:06:27] our education with all of our theology
[1:06:29] with all our church denominations we
[1:06:31] fasten people of the pillars at the same
[1:06:35] there's no such thing today they can't
[1:06:37] be healed there's no certain things for
