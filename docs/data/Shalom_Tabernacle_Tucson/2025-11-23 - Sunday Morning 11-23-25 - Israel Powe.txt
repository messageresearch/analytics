========================================

When had come, it would be a everlasting eternal rest. &gt;&gt; God made the world. Hebrews the 4th chapter, God made the world and rested on the seven days. That's right. They come back around. He give that to the Jews for a covenant for a certain amount of time. That's right. But they go and rest one day, go back to first day of the week, start over again. New start over. That ain't the rest that God spoke of when God made the world in six days. when he went to rest, he rested from then on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. That settled it. He didn't come back on the eighth day and start again. It was only a shadow. Now, that was a type like the moon to the sun. But when the sun comes up, we don't need the moon no more. Now, notice this. Oh, in Revelations 11, the woman with the moon under her feet and the sun at her head. Oh, we could go through the Bibles and lead to lead and show you. See? But what is it? When the Bible said in Hebrews the 4th chapter, if Jesus would have given them a rest day, he would have afterwards spoke of it. He would have spoke of a rest day. What day did he speak about a rest? Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew the 11th chapter 22nd verse. Look, then we find that when we come to him, for he said Hebrews 4 that has entered into Jesus rest has ceased from his worldly works as God did from his when he made the world to never return to it again. How long? HOW LONG ARE YOU SEALED BY the Holy Ghost? Until the day of your redemption. &gt;&gt; There's that rest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. comfort, advocate, &gt;&gt; seal, deliver. &gt;&gt; I get kind of excited. &gt;&gt; I get kind of blessed. &gt;&gt; Oh, is it promised for us, Brother Brand? Is it proven by the Bible? All right, let's go to Joel. Find out what Joel said about it. How thankful I am for the blessed word of God. Do you love it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think there if it wasn't for the word, I don't know where we'd stand. All right, we're Joel now. We're going to Joel, the second chapter of Joel, and we're going to start at the 28th verse. Joel 2:28, 800 years before the coming of Christ, the prophet in the spirit. Now listen. And it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh. Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy. Your old man shall dream dreams. And your young man shall see visions. And also upon my servants, and upon my hands made will I pour out in these days. pour out in those days my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens above and in the earth blood fire and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be delivered. What &gt;&gt; Joel? Did you notice in Acts two, Peter tuck up the same verse, said, "Ye man of Israel, hear my words. These are not drunk. The sealed comforting, &gt;&gt; peculiar, marked people. They are not drunk as you suppose." Acts two, seeing that this is the third hour of the day, but this is that which is spoke of by Joel the prophet, saying, it shall come to pass in the last days that I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh. What is it? What is the Holy Ghost? All right. Now, let's notice again promise to the believers. That's what it is. Now, this Holy Ghost, we find out what it is. Just a minute. Who is it promise to to believers? Now let's go to Luke 24 chapter of Luke. Listen what Jesus said in his last words before he left the earth. Luke the 24th chapter. And you just taking this down now. You can mark it down and study it tomorrow when you have more time. Now Luke 24:49. Listen to Jesus speaking at the end when he was ascending up into glory, the ascension. Here's the words he said to his disciples. Behold, I send the promise of my father. What promise? The seal, the son, the comforter, and all these things that I've spoke of times thousands more. I send the promise of my father upon you. What promise? The one that Isaiah said would come with stammer lips and other tongues. I speak to this people. I'll send that rest upon you. &gt;&gt; I'll send what Joel spoke of that it shall come to pass the last day, sayaith God, I'll pour out my spirit upon you. Or I'll send to you and make all nations, all people beginning from Jerusalem. I'll bring in the seed of Abraham under this covenant. I'll seal away every one of them. See, I'll pour out my spirit. I'll send the promise of my father upon you. But carry ye means wait in the city of Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high. What is the Holy Ghost saying? Power &gt;&gt; from on high. &gt;&gt; Not power from the bishop. Not power from the church, but power from on high. &gt;&gt; How did that power come? By joining church, I challenge you to say that that's right. By joining the church, shaking hands with a preacher. No sir. Now, do you Catholic sticking out your tongue and taking the first communion? No sir. How did it come? Power of Mona. Let's read a little farther. Let's go to Acts 1 8. They're assembling together now. Now, they were speaking of Jesus here when they were assembled together and had ordained another to take the Judas's place. Acts 1:8, but ye shall receive power after this, the Holy Ghost has come upon you. What? You become the member of the Brandon Tabernet. No, you become the member of the Methodist church, the Catholic church, the Presbyterian. Not so in the Bible. That's man-made doctrine. But you shall receive power after you have become a preacher. No sir. &gt;&gt; You shall receive power after you get your bachelor of art. No sir. You shall reccome power after you get your DD. No sir. You shall receive power after you're baptized in water. No sir. You shall receive power after you have taken the first communion. No sir. See, that's all man-made stuff. Listen what the Bible said, what Jesus said. Ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you. &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Ghost of power? &gt;&gt; Then after this you shall be witnesses just you 12. You witness at Jerusalem. You shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, Judea, Samir, and to the utmost parts of the earth, &gt;&gt; which has never been reached yet. And when he spoken these things, when he spoken these things, while they beheld him, he was taken up in the cloud and received out of their sight. Now turn right across the page. Watch these prophecies come to pass. And when the day of Pentecost had fully come, they were in one, they were all with one accord in one place. And all of a sudden, the pastor came in. And I got off the line there, didn't I? All of a sudden, the priest come on the altar. And suddenly there came a sound. &gt;&gt; Not just a make believe. It was there. Amen. &gt;&gt; A sound. A minister was approaching the door. The priest had the communion coming out of the holy place. No, never mind. There came a sound from heaven. Not the rustling of a feet. There came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And it filled all the house where they were saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Ghost? Here's where they get power. Here's where they supposed to wait. Here's what happened when they did it. All prophesied from Genesis right on up from Abraham right on through. It would come and how it would come and the results would come. What is it? Promise to the church, to believers. and filled all the house where there was set. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like a fire and it set upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance. &gt;&gt; Now we're going to get on that Friday night. We leave that right there. How is it? It's a promise to the church. Absolutely a promise. All right. Now, now we go to find out after they were filled, they were sealed until how long? How many of yours got the Holy Ghost? I see your hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's more with the Holy Ghost than it is without you to be one of us, brother, sister. When you understand what it is, it's it is the spirit of God dwelling in you to do the works of God. When God ever sent any of his spirit into any of his servants, any of his prophets, any of his teachers, any of his apostles, they were always rejected of the world. &gt;&gt; They were considered crazy in every age there was. &gt;&gt; Even when Paul stood before Griffith, he said, "In the way that's called heresy," what is heresy? Crazy. &gt;&gt; In the way that they call crazy a bunch of nuts, that's the way I worship the God of our father. That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them. Now, after this Holy Ghost fell upon them, it made them so much sweethearts until everything was in common. Is that right? &gt;&gt; My my, what a fellowship. We sing that song time. Oh, what fellowship. Oh, what joy divine. That's it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They didn't care. They didn't care whether the the sun shined or didn't. They didn't ask for a flower bed of bees. Now I'll receive the Holy Ghost, says some people to me, Mr. Brandham, if you will guarantee me that I'll be a millionaire. If you'll guarantee me, I'll find or wells and if I'll uh find gold mines and I I see people teach that and they teach a lie. &gt;&gt; God has not promised those things. A man that ever receives the Holy Ghost don't care whether he begs for bread or not. &gt;&gt; Doesn't make any difference to him. &gt;&gt; He's a heavenbound creature. He don't care. He's got no power here at all. Right? He don't care. Let come let go what may let him criticize, make fun, lose your precious. Why do you care? &gt;&gt; You're on your road to glory. Hallelujah. Your eyes are set on Christ and you're on your road. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't care what the world says. That's what the Holy Ghost is. It's a power. It's a seal. It's a comforter. It's an advocate. It's a sign. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the assurance that God has received you. How much time have I take? I've got just eight more minutes. All right. Let me I got a lot of scriptures here. I don't guess I can get them in, but we we'll try our best. Now, after a man has been filled with the Holy Ghost, is it possible that persecutions and things would cause him to have to come back? And now, he ain't going to lose. He's still a son of God. He'll always be because you're sealed how long? That's right. That's what the Bible says. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Here you are. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Deep. Thank you. Happy I give you all the praise. I want to say thanks. Thanks. I give you thanks for all you have done. I am so blessed. My soul is found rest. Oh, I give you thanks. Let's tell him one more time. I want to say thanks. Let's stand together as we worship him. I give you thanks for all that you have done. I am so blessed. My soul is found rest. Oh Lord, I give you thanks. Thank you, Lord, for the strength you give to simply carry on through life's toils and tests, the worst and best. You never leave me alone. You always ride beside me. when I pray. Since I first began, you've been my dearest friend. I give you all the praise. I want to say thanks. Thanks. I give you thanks for all that you done. Oh, I am so blessed. My soul has found past. Oh Lord, I give you thanks and I give you thanks for this moment. Lord, I give you thanks for this moment. I will continually for each day I live your praise to give. Oh, I'm blessed upon the moment when in my life you made such a change. And since your spirit came, I've not been the same. I just want to give you praise. I'm going to say thanks. Thanks. I give you thanks for all for all you've done. Oh, I'm so blessed. I am so blessed. Lord, my soul has found my soul. I give and even in the bad times. Brother will you come up with our service? Yes. Even in the bad times, when everything's going wrong, even on the mountain, his loving presence makes me strong. Each and every moment, each and every day, I'm going to sing and shout. Won't let the rocks cry out, give you all the praise. I'm going to say thanks. Thanks. I give you thanks for all for all you've done. Oh, I am so blessed. My soul is found. I give you thanks. Amen. &gt;&gt; So grateful, so thankful. &gt;&gt; Let's all just bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we are so privileged this morning to come into your presence, Lord. And Lord, we just ask that you would have your will in your way in every part of our lives. Lord, we just ask, Lord, that this word would come and just manifest itself through us in a greater way. Lord, we're so grateful for your grace and your mercy in our lives. Lord, we're so grateful for the blood of Jesus Christ. We're so grateful, Lord, that you've presented us, Lord, to yourself as the bride, Lord. Oh, we're so grateful, Lord, that you condescended and came down, the great creator, became my savior, Lord, and then stepped in behind this veil. We're so thankful for this hour, Lord, for the word of God that's being made manifest in these closing moments of time. Lord, just give us strength, Lord. Give us, Lord, what we have need of this morning. Lord, we think of a a fighter and a boxer and, Lord, the training and the exactness of the Holy Ghost, how it's teaching us, Lord, as David said, to to teach our fingers to fight. Lord, our our hands to make war. Lord, help us in this hour. We didn't pick this fight, Lord, but we're sure in it. And oh God, we think of a little kid, Lord, in on the schoolyard back in the day, Lord, and the first thing we recognized is all we could do is maybe windmill it, Lord, and just start swinging, Lord. But then now we're coming into a time, Lord, the bride of Jesus Christ, where you're actually teaching exactly what to do, distance and range, when to move forward, when to move back. Lord, just how to walk, just how to step. Lord, help us, Father, to just be completely under your control. Lord, we give you our lives, Lord. We offer this service, Lord. We offer our sacrifices of praise to you. Be in every part, Lord. The music, Lord, the preaching, Lord, the worship. Lord, give us ears to hear and a heart to understand. Lord, help us, Father, to be able to take all of the word of God, Lord, to receive the whole message, Lord, in this hour. Help us, Father. We commit it into your hands and we're just so grateful and we want to give you all the praise and the thanks in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just turn around, shake hands with those that are around you this morning. So good to be here and just what a lovely atmosphere we have. And you can be seated if you like.

So we just thankful for for God's goodness. How many can say I'm thankful for God's goodness in my life. Amen. Thankful that he touched me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you brothers and sisters. Um, I thank the Lord this morning. I am still wearing the pin for the the anniversary which the brother gave me because I'm still in that spirit. &gt;&gt; 36 years ago, I came to the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. and I was 20. And I started reading about Tucson. I started reading about George Smith. I started reading about um Sunset Mountain, Sabino Canyon. I'm reading I started reading about Tucson Tabernacle Green. Pastor Green 36 years ago listening to the voice, reading the books and the testimonies. Then one day I find myself in Tucson. You can imagine the feeling, right? &gt;&gt; I don't know because you have not experienced it, but I'm telling you the experience is no longer the same. and my faith has no longer been the same. I want to appreciate this brother &gt;&gt; and my friend, brother Israel for the way that the Lord has always laid him, guided him. that today under this ministry the message that the prophet says I have heard now I see &gt;&gt; right here &gt;&gt; for the first time I met brother George Smith and I shook hands with him &gt;&gt; and I took a picture and I sent it home and then My phone was flooded with messages. Brother Jonathan, is that brother Joe Smith? I said amen. &gt;&gt; So I have a congregation on social media. So I appreciate this brother. I appreciate this brother. I appreciate this brother. We need to say these things that he can hear them when he's alive. &gt;&gt; I want brother Paul, Paul Rais, wherever you are, I appreciate you &gt;&gt; and my faith when I sit in that corner, my faith is at peace. And um thank you, brother John. Thank you for everything that has happened. And I'm still in the inspiration of that meeting because it really blessed me. I saw pastor uh Ron Peterson. I heard brother Isaiah Brooks 36 years ago. I started hearing the singing of that brother. I took a picture. I sent it home. Brother Jonathan is that brother Isaiah Brooks. I said amen. So you can see that I want to sing the song I pledge allegiance. It has been on my mind for some weeks now and um it's a congregation song. You can join me. I pledge allegiance to the lamb with all my strength with all I am. How seek to honor his command. I pledge allegiance to the land. Howard, how Christians long ago they were brought before the ton throne. They were told that they would spare their lives if they would renounce the name of Christ. But one by one they chose to die the son of God. There would deny it might and quiet. I can almost here. Therefore, I place allees to the L with all my strength. With all I am, I will seek to honor his command. I pledge alce to you the land vest alleges to the land with all my strength. With all I will sing to all command. I pledge alleience to the land.

We sure appreciate our visitors filling some seats this morning. &gt;&gt; I just want to go on record saying, "Sister Lorie Snow, you look fabulous today. &gt;&gt; It's good to see you, Brother Randy, Sister Melissa. I have such a way with words. I've said it in a way where she said, "Well, I thought I looked okay." And then you said, "We've got a long way to go." Oh, but I know you know she knows my heart and just good to be in service with each one. Sister Tila, nice to see you this morning. She writes that she wants to thank you, the prayers, the pastor of the church for the prayers and she's feeling much better after starting injections and the help for the back surgery and just trusting the Lord for total healing. Good to be in church this morning. God bless you. my sister will keep you in prayer and and we know we have some traveling, some out this morning. We're fighting a battle. It's the last season, the last hour. So, just bring that request to Almighty God this morning. Dear God, we're very thankful to be in church. So much to be thankful for, Lord. We don't have the words and the songs, Lord. They just scratched the surface of what our thoughts, Lord, our worship of you today. we could put all the words and the letters of the alphabet and things together, Lord, just couldn't touch what your mighty power is and your goodness to us. Just invite you, Lord, to continue to bless the the church, the saints, Lord, the worship service, these songs that have been sung, Lord, the pledging allegiance to you this morning, Lord, our pastor. We just echo those things about him and his burden. Lord, we know it's a very difficult job. It's a 24/7 job. It's a labor of love. Lord, for him, Sister Sharon, for Carissa, for Levi, for Aaliyah, Lord, we appreciate him so much. And we don't tell them enough, but we want to thank you for them this morning, Lord, for each one that it's a small sacrifice, Lord, to come out and say a few things and sing a few songs, Lord. But now, it's time to hear from heaven. And we just pray for your continued anointing, Lord. We thank you for brother John and his family and just continue to bless the worship. Lord, as we move that forward and then the word, Lord, may our ears be open to hear from heaven. Lord, we bring a a small tithe and offering maybe to the house of the Lord, knowing that you own it all, Father, that we are just stewards of the things that you give to us. Our jobs, Lord, the money, our cars, our houses, it's not ours. We're just taking care of it, Lord, for the kingdom of God, however you'd see fit, Lord. We commit it all to you in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus in thankfulness and all God's people say. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Lori, if you would work your way down. I believe Brother Zach is going to be accompanying her this morning. And let's just sing the chorus that Sister Po's been playing there. In the presence of Jehovah. In the presence of Jehovah, God Almighty, the prince of peace, trles, hearts are made in the presence of the king. Let's sing that second verse. Through his love, the Lord provided. Through his love, the Lord provided a resting place for me. It's a place to find the answer in the hour of distress. There is never any reason to give up in despair. Just slip away. Breathe his name. He will surely meet you there in the presence of Jehovah. Oh God almighty. God almighty. You're my prince, my prince of peace. And in that presence, our trles manage. In his presence, hearts are mened. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Make him welcome this morning in the presence of the king. Amen. You can be seated. While brother Zach is getting ready, I just wanted to thank each and every one of you for the prayers for me. The only reason I am here is because of the prayers of the saints and I thank the Lord for extra days. &gt;&gt; Nothing else just to give him thanks. There may be storms that will move in our way. and trials may come to only test my faith. What I've learned about your favor, your mercy and your grace is they go on forever. They're sufficient for today. When I'm worried about tomorrow, I won't be overwhelmed. And the burdens that I carry, I will choose to lay them down. Cuz what I've learned about your favor, your mercy, and your grace is they go on forever. They're sufficient for today. And hallelujah. Yeah. Halleluah. Hallelu. They're sufficient for today. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yeah. Hallelujah. They're sufficient for today. In the joy and in the sorrow, I find you just the same. And behind my darkest morning, there's a peace I can't explain. I'm so grateful for your mercy, your goodness, and your grace. Cuz they go on forever. They're sufficient for today. And hallelujah. Yeah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Y there's sufficient for today. And hallelujah. Yeah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yeah, there's sufficient for today. One day I'll finally see you and my faith will be my sight and all my present suffering will be gone and out of sight. &gt;&gt; I'll be standing in your favor. your mercy and your grace because they go on forever. Yes, they go on forever. They'll still go on forever. All glory to your name and hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. All gloryy to your name and hallelujah. Hallelu Hallelu. All gloryy to your name and hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There's sufficient for today. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. They're sufficient for today. Hallelujah. Let's all stand together. I am so thankful of that this morning. His grace, his goodness, his mercy is sufficient for me today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sister Lori, just so appreciate that this morning. Couldn't help but think of David, the valleys that he went through. And in his deepest, darkest valleys, he would encourage himself in the Lord. And just the the psalms that we get such encouragement out of when he was going through that trial, he would say, "Great is his faithfulness. His mercy is sufficient for me." &gt;&gt; Just remain standing. We normally have you sit down as the musicians play, but that song that brother Jonathan was singing the second verse. Something about standing and just pledging allegiance to the lamb this morning, with all my strength, with all I am. You know, Jesus will take whatever we give him. But he's asked for more than our strength. He's asked for our heart, our soul, our mind. He'll take what you give him. But &gt;&gt; so don't don't pledge allegiance to more than you're willing to give this morning, but he'd love for you to give him his all your all this morning. And let's just sing that chorus. We'll sing it once and then just keep your hands raised however long they continue to play it till our pastor comes out. Lord, I pledge allegiance to you this morning. With all my strength, with all I am, &gt;&gt; I pledge allegiance to the Lamb. With all my strength, with all I am, I will seek to honor his command. I pledge alance to the lamb. Just remain standing as they continue to play. It is command. Jesus Christ. Praise to God. Amen. be all the And we will see the heart is Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. Good morning. like to welcome you to the house of the Lord. I trust everybody is feeling fine. Amen. We welcome you and I like to see your smiles on your faces and Amen. We know that something good is going to happen this morning. We believe that and so we appreciate each of you the sacrifice you have made to come. The visitors that are here welcome you. As we prepare to go to the word, let's bow our heads in prayer. Dear Lord Jesus, Lord, we can do nothing without you. You're the very source of our life. And the reason we're here today is because you brought us here. You made it possible for us to be here, still alive, trying to serve you with all of our hearts. Oh God, I just commit this service and ourselves into your hands. May you take full control this morning. Minister to us, Lord, as only you know how. It's in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray and we thank you. Amen. God bless you, saints. Amen. So, I certainly appreciate those song specials and uh very very nice. I really enjoy that a number of visitors here today. I don't have a list of them, but I know I heard that Sister Angel was here. God bless her. Um, some folks from the reservation are here. That's Is that brother said? Tell me his name. &gt;&gt; Brother Ted. Brother Ted. Sister Esther. Praise the Lord from the resurre. God bless them. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. Brother John Duncan, our good friend, and a a gentleman that's a brother that's with him visiting for the first time. &gt;&gt; So, we welcome him. welcome them to the house of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Any other visitors that are here, we welcome you. Our good friend, brother um Zephaniah Papiso, he's here from uh the Eastern Cape and uh he's a missionary and he has worked with um the Voice of God Ministries over the years. He does it now, but he speaks the C plowser language. You got to do that click and I don't know how to do it. &gt;&gt; How's How's uh language and his it's his voice on over 70 messages or so that interpreting the message of the prophet and uh he lives in a very rural area and uh but he's been holding up the good faith there and establishing churches and we want to hear from him tonight. And so you pray for our brother Zephaniah and uh this morning and this afternoon. So we thank the Lord for each of you and we'd like to as we're standing to go right into the word and we'll turn. Good to see brother Vidalis and Amen. Amen. This morning and each of you in the scripture in Matthew chapter 13, we greet the saints in Phoenix as well. Brother Art, Brother Stevie, and the saints keeping the doors and the service moving forward there that gather in the name. Um, Matthew chapter 13 in verse number three. And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a swer went forth to sow, and when he sowed, some seeds fell by the wayside. The fowls came and devoured them up. Some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth, forth with they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth. And when the sun was up, they were scorched. And because they had no root, they withered away. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprung up and choked them. But others fell in good ground and brought forth fruit, some 100fold, some 60fold, some 30fold. Notice, everybody brought forth something. Verse nine, who hath ears to hear, let him hear. And the disciples came and said unto him, Why speak thou unto them in parables? And he answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, &gt;&gt; but to them it is not given. For whosoever hath to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance, but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath. Therefore, speak I to them in parables, because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. And then Jesus goes on and quotes Isaiah the prophet. We'll take one more scripture in Revelations chapter 10. Very familiar scripture. Hallmark scriptures for the message believers. Those that follow the message of the hour. That's becoming a little more difficult for some people to even say that you follow the message of the hour. But don't let the devil fool you. Don't you let the devil fool you. He doesn't make the rules. God makes the rules. And he's the one that we serve. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he's led us by a great and tremendous message of this day. In verse number one, I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud. A rainbow was upon his head. His face was as it were the sun, his feet as pillars of fire. He had in his hand a little book open, and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the earth. And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth. And when he had cried, what happened? &gt;&gt; Seven thunders uttered their voices. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that are therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea the things that which are therein that should be time lower. &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse seven alto together. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. And may God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated. Why the mysteries? That's the title of our message this morning. Why the mysteries? We have heard of these great mysteries. Um if you have been in church at any amount of time in your life, you would have come across that word mystery. Mysteries um in your in your Bible and the scriptures are um not silent on what those mysteries are. in Matthew chapter 13 that we read there in the Scullfield Bible, it will lay out those mysteries, what those mysteries are. There's about 11 that Dr. Scoffield writes out and um in the message, Brother Banner goes a little further and he adds some more mysteries that has been revealed even in this day. If you remember, he goes into the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation. The mystery of um the water baptism, the mystery of serpent seed, &gt;&gt; serpent seed, it's one of the mysteries. Scoffield doesn't write that in. And there's several mysteries, but you know, we'll get criticized or many of us can be criticized and be critical. And I have too been critical over coming to a church and most of the language you hear you don't understand. &gt;&gt; Some of the verbiage, some of the some of the the terminology you might you might not understand. And so the pressure has been for whoever the speakers are not to dumb it down but to make it more presentable for the newcomer &gt;&gt; and I believe that's that's a good uh uh uh avenue. I believe that should be there. But we don't do that in lie of or in sacrifice of what the mysteries are. &gt;&gt; And the mysteries are not things that we should run away from. &gt;&gt; The mysteries are the things that we embrace. Just pick up your Bible. &gt;&gt; Just read your Bible. Don't take my word for it. Don't take any other preachers's word for it. you pick up your Bible and look up the word mystery and see what the Bible says about that. Can we do that just for a moment? &gt;&gt; In Mark 4 11, it says, "He said unto them, unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God. But un but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables. Romans 11:25. For I would not, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceit that blindness in part is happen to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in. The Lord help us. We'll get back to that if the Lord would help us. Romans 16 verse 25 says, "Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of what?" &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. According to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began. 1 Corinthians 2:7, "But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, &gt;&gt; even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory." 1 Corinthians 15:51. Want to thank you all in the Thank you, sis, in the back. She's pretty fast and she's getting these up. 1 Corinthians 15:51. But I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But we shall all be changed. &gt;&gt; How many's interested in that? &gt;&gt; How many interested in being changed? &gt;&gt; Well, that's a mystery. &gt;&gt; And Paul said, "I show you a mystery. We're not going to all go to sleep. Some of us &gt;&gt; will still be here &gt;&gt; and we will be CHANGED &gt;&gt; IN THE MOMENT, in the twinkling of an eye. &gt;&gt; Paul showed that to us. &gt;&gt; Embrace it. &gt;&gt; Don't run from it. &gt;&gt; Be grateful for it. &gt;&gt; Says, "Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed." Ephesians 1 verse number nine says, "Having made known unto us the mystery of his will." &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; According to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself. You know, his will is a mystery, but he has showed it unto us. &gt;&gt; Amen. having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself. Ephesians 3:3 says, "How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote a four in a few words." This is the Apostle Paul writing verse four. whereby when we read, we may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:26 says, "Even the mystery which has been hid from ages &gt;&gt; and from generations, but now &gt;&gt; but now is made manifest." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To who? &gt;&gt; To his saints. &gt;&gt; There is no university going to give you this mystery. &gt;&gt; There is no church group. There is no man talking to you going to open up this mystery. But he has given to us &gt;&gt; by his love, by his mercy, by his grace, the revelation of who Jesus is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the revelation of who Jesus is, making known this great mystery. Let me take this scripture in Colossians 4:3 and it says, "With all praying also for us, pray for us that God would open unto us a door of o utterance to speak what? &gt;&gt; The mystery of Christ, which I am also in bound." So, who's the author of the mystery? God &gt;&gt; who's the one that's bringing up the my who presents the word in a mystery. It's God himself. &gt;&gt; So it's not a church. It's not a group of people. Now people can make it mysterious and there's people that can make it confusing but God hides himself in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Then he reveals himself. Remember saints as the prophet told us Matthew 16, upon this rock I will build my church &gt;&gt; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Upon this rock, what is the rock? The rock is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Revelation is to reveal things that are hidden. &gt;&gt; To be a believer, you must have a revelation. &gt;&gt; Revelation is not the same of education. It's not the same of knowledge. It's not the same of you reading. It's not the same as somebody telling you. Revelation was is when God opens your eyes and reveals to you &gt;&gt; who he is. &gt;&gt; Now the entire church is built upon it. We have taken criticism because we preach the mystery. We want it so easy that um and many of us approach God this way like God I need to know this and I need to know it right now and in fact I want to know it without praying without wrestling for it without tearing into my personal time without being hurt for it without being h abused or accused for it. We just want to know the information. &gt;&gt; That's right. But he doesn't present it that way. He presents it in the mystery. And the disciples says, "Why are you speaking to them in parables?" Jesus quotes Isaiah and said, "Because it is given unto you to know the mystery." So, how many love the mystery? The mysteries require the you know know in the scriptures we have keys and we have things that are locked and things that need to be opened up &gt;&gt; and we don't even understand our lives. &gt;&gt; Not just the mystery of who God is or the mystery of the seven seal or the the mystery of you know iniquity and all these great mysteries that need to be unlocked. What about the mystery of who I am? &gt;&gt; WHY DO I HAVE TO suffer through the things that I suffered? Why was I raised in the home I WAS RAISED IN? &gt;&gt; WHO AM I? &gt;&gt; WHY AM I SO concerned about where I'M GOING TOMORROW? THAT is a mystery. &gt;&gt; And your mom and dad can't tell you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't tell yourself. These great mysteries need to be unlocked, unfolded, revealed so that you can walk in the knowledge of who Jesus is. &gt;&gt; You know, the mystery that has been unfolded or unlocked removes the confusion. &gt;&gt; That this age is the most confusing age. There's more confusion than any other age. Even around believers, around people, around the nation, the nation's identity, who a young man is today, a young woman today, what marriage is, and all those things, it's just a confusing time. But when something is revealed to you, the revelation removes the confusion. So you're not spending years of your life trying to accomplish something that absolutely means nothing to you. &gt;&gt; Years of your life spending your wheels trying to BECOME SOMETHING THAT GOD NEVER WANTED you to become. &gt;&gt; But when he reveals to you &gt;&gt; or HE MAKES IT KNOWN TO OR HE OPENS IT UP to you, &gt;&gt; man, you can get up with a purpose. YOU CAN WAKE UP AND MOVE FORWARD WITH A PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK PERMISSION FROM NOBODY. YOU CAN WALK FORWARD IN ALL OF THE PROMISES OF THE ALMIGHTY God &gt;&gt; because he's revealed to you that you're a son of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This may take some time. This may take some struggle. &gt;&gt; This may take some wrestling. Ask our dear brother Joseph in the Bible. Ask him as a young boy the dreams coming to him, spiritual dreams. Ask him about the love his father had for him and the hatred his brothers had for him. Ask Joseph if he had all the answers to his life. HE DID NOT HAVE THE ANSWERS. IT WAS A MYSTERY. BUT WHEN GOD OPENED THE MYSTERY TO HIM, HIS LIFE IS NOW A testimony &gt;&gt; of our Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; moving and working in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is a mystery? Scoffield takes that mystery and it's a previously hidden truth and that is made known. There's still a supernatural element to it as he gives that definition. And let me just read it here quickly. Brother Brandham reads it too. A mystery in scripture is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but in but in which a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation. So Dr. Scoffield lists some of these mysteries that are to be revealed in the last day. And there's a list of them. I'll just read them for you here quickly. And maybe we'll take one of them. One of the mysteries is the mystery of the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 13. That's what we read. The mystery of Israel's blindness during this age. That's Romans 11. The mystery of the translation of the living saints at the end of the age. 1 Corinthians 15. 1 Thessalonians 4:14. The mystery of the New Testament church as one body composed of Jew and Gentile. Ephesians 3, Romans 16, Colossians 4. The mystery of the church as the bride of Christ. Ephesians 5. The mystery of the in-living Christ. Galatians 2, Colossians 1. The mystery of God, even Christ. Christ as the incarnate fullness of the Godhead bodily or embodied. First Colossians 2, 1 Corinthians 2:7. And you can also put 1 Timothy 3:16. And he mentions that one. The mystery of the process by which God likeness is restored to men. 1 Corinth 1 Timothy 3:16. The mystery of iniquity. 2 Thessalonians 2, Matthew 13. The mystery of the seven stars. Revelations 1:20. Is that too much scripture for you? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Did you want to hear the politics? &gt;&gt; Was y'all coming here to hear some news? &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I was supposed to read from the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Man, is this too much Bible for you? &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Where are we at? &gt;&gt; This is not a YouTube channel. &gt;&gt; It's not a session to sit back, somebody to entertain you. &gt;&gt; I JUST QUOTED FROM THE LIVING WORD OF GOD THAT HEAVENS AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY, &gt;&gt; BUT MY word shall never pass away. Can I keep reading the scripture? &gt;&gt; Two more. Revelations 120, the mystery of the seven stars, the mystery of Babylon. Revelation 17:5. So, are there mysteries in the Bible? Yes. Who authors them? &gt;&gt; God does. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, man gets in there and they manipulate and they make things confusing. They make it harder. They try to use it to manipulate people. We agree that's there. But let's go. Where did mysteries originally come from? &gt;&gt; They're in your Bible. &gt;&gt; They're given to us by God himself. And there's a purpose that he gives us these mysteries so that we can speak them so that his plans can be made known. &gt;&gt; Remember, &gt;&gt; a mystery is a previously hidden truth, &gt;&gt; but it's still hidden to many. Right? &gt;&gt; Because it's been opened up to you doesn't mean everybody else has received that revelation. &gt;&gt; The re the revelation of water baptism. There was a particular time in the age that that was revealed. It was called the open door age. &gt;&gt; Brother Adam tells us that and that was revealed in its season between the Philadelphia and the Leodysian church age. that age called it the open door. I have set before thee an open door. And that was the revelation of who Jesus was and the revelation of water baptism. Now, everyone still didn't get to walk through that door. &gt;&gt; Although the door has been open for quite some time. So there the there the mysteries that have previously been hidden, they're still hidden to many. So let let me let me just take this here in the Philadelphia church age and talk about this open door just for a moment because it was a particular time in in in history that it was made known. Now in 1961 the message Messiah brother Brandham says this here paragraph 53. And how was the book of acts wrote? Start reading it. Look how we've contaminated it with all kinds of foolish things of our own. But there will be someone come someday, a light before the going out, this open door that set before the church. Watch and see if it doesn't come some of these days. God will send the Elijah. just as certain as I'm standing in this pull pit, he will send and the Elijah will shake the people right straight back to the original Pentecostal doctrine. &gt;&gt; All right, it continues on in the Philadelphiaian church age. I have it here. Actually, I got it right here. Paragraph 236. Now, this great temptation, he says, this is 1960, December 1960. this great temptation, the hour of temptation that shall come to try the whole world goes into the tribulation. Just in a few minutes, we'll see it goes into the tribulation. And the tribulation did not come in the days of Wesley. So, what age are we in? What's this door set before us? It's between the Wesley, where the church is headed right now, and already into the Leodysian age. But this little place right in here with the last within the last 3540 years has been an open door setting right before the people to come in and God will take the remnant and seal it off and they'll go on into a lukewarm and he'll spew them out of his mouth. The work will be cut short. Up goes the church. And here comes the Antichrist moving in for destruction. Just perfect. Fits with the whole Bible right on around. Now, he continues on in this open door thought. It's the same message that's going up a few more paragraphs. Paragraph 119, he says this here, a open door. What was it? It was the revelation of the supreme deity of Jesus Christ. Not being a second person of a trinity, but being God himself made flesh and dwelling among us. &gt;&gt; And the revelation, now if you notice just in a minute, let's read just a little bit farther. Shut it. Has a little strength. Has not denied my name. The first time the name's been spoke of now since back in this age back here lost its name. Luther come out with the name that he was alive and was dead. That's right. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Here, here comes out the name of Jesus again in between these two ages here in between the open door. Now it's a revelation what he was the deity. The revelations of his deity. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many has that revelation? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, we ought to be thankful for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think because it's been revealed to us, we might not know or be aware that a very small fraction of people know what you know. You are in the minority &gt;&gt; for to be able to even open the Bible &gt;&gt; and understand that that an Elijah was supposed to come. &gt;&gt; You are in the minority to know how to be baptized. &gt;&gt; You are in the minority to know what it means to repent, &gt;&gt; what it means TO BE SAVED, &gt;&gt; what it means to really dedicate your life to the Lord. &gt;&gt; You are in the minority. When you realize that Jesus is the word, &gt;&gt; and when PEOPLE SAY, "I LOVE JESUS AND I WANT JESUS," THEY'RE REALLY SAYING, "I WANT THE WORD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; How many of us ever met Jesus face to face, saw how tall he was, held him in his hand in his corporal body? No. Nobody here did. No. But we know Jesus through what? His word. It's through the word that we know Jesus. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is his word. &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness this morning? &gt;&gt; That's a tremendous revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND WE THANK GOD FOR these revelations because God is the author of them. He uh uh they're there. They're hidden things. There there parts in the in the word that we can't really just open up and tell everybody because if we do, they call us crazy. You know how you are on your job. You can't tell them everything. They want to know the mystery, Brother Joseph, what's going on in your life. They want to know. And sometimes they'll keep asking and keep asking and you're like, "Okay, you keep asking, I'm going tell you." I had this one gentleman. We was doing through work. He was doing a we were talking about the Bible or something. He was asking me who I thought the first twins in the Bible was. I was like, "We probably don't want to go to that one." He's like, "Come on, which one?" Like, he knew who it was. It was Isaac and Jacob. I was like, "Nah, I don't think WELL, COME ON. TELL ME. WHAT'S THE ANSWER?" I SAID, "YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW?" And I told him &gt;&gt; and he received it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's still in a message church over there in Sacramento today. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. They might believe it just like you did. Actually, &gt;&gt; they might believe it just like you did. &gt;&gt; But there's some mysterious things. And God hid it that way. The disciples ASKED HIM, "LORD, TELL US PLAINLY." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU THE ONE OR NOT? &gt;&gt; PILATE ASKED HIM, "MAN, YOUR YOUR LIFE IS ON THE LINE. I GOT THE POWER TO CONDEMN YOU. I GOT THE POWER TO SET YOU FREE. &gt;&gt; DEFEND YOURSELF. HE DIDN'T DEFEND HIMSELF. HE DIDN'T DEFEND HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; So mysteries, God allows the mystery. He brings the mystery on. He allows it. They come from him. They do exist. So what's the problem? The problem is that many of us don't want to do the work &gt;&gt; required to stay long enough in a place for God to reveal himself and to reveal his will. We're always moving. always moving now. I want to know now. I want to know now. Everything, every service that we have had, you know, in cleaning and eating and service and it's all about the time. Speed. Speed. Now. Now. Now. Who can get it quick? Now. Now. Now. And we bring that spirit to the word and want God to reveal it now. It doesn't work that way. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; He has to allow things to develop. I like something that brother Brandham preached a number of time. Timeested memorials. Some memorials you can only give witness of them through time. &gt;&gt; This is why the Bible says a bishop shouldn't be a novice or a newcomer. Why? We need some time. We need to look at you. &gt;&gt; We need to judge you. &gt;&gt; We need to not say amen when you're preaching. We need to not encourage you. &gt;&gt; We need to take something from you. We need to talk about your family. Now go preach. &gt;&gt; Go love everybody AFTER WE DONE GOSSIPED on you. &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY HELP ME HERE. &gt;&gt; YES. CAN YOU TAKE IT? YOU YOU YOU THINK YOU want the mic in your hand. YOU THINK YOU WANT THE LIGHTS ON YOU, BUT CAN YOU HANDLE THE PRESSURE? &gt;&gt; WELL, WE DON'T KNOW. BUT TIME WILL TEST YOU &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE CALLED timetested memorials. &gt;&gt; Some testimonies are just beautiful because you're still alive and you're still here. &gt;&gt; You didn't say you don't have to say nothing. I SAW THE STORM come through. I've heard about the trauma. I HEARD ABOUT THE DRAMA. AND I LOOKED THROUGH THE CROWD AND YOU STILL STANDING THERE. &gt;&gt; THAT SAYS ENOUGH. YOU'RE STILL HERE. &gt;&gt; STILL LIFTING UP THE NAME OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; TIMEESTED MEMORIAL. &gt;&gt; THANK GOD I'M STILL ALIVE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Time tested memorials. Yes. &gt;&gt; But here the prophet deals with this just a little bit &gt;&gt; in a couple of places. I'll read for you. here where getting into the spirit of revelation talks about digging down deep enough to get into the spirit of revelation. Huh? Can I read that for you? &gt;&gt; Hear what the prophet of God says here. It's in the indictment uh 1963 paragraph 265 says this. Let's move up just a little bit from that paragraph. I think I gave you the indictment paragraph 265, but move up just above that just a little bit. Maybe if I'll start reading. He says I didn't bring my laptop up here. But they'll get it. Yes. Move up just a little bit. 264. All right. Thank you. Paragraph 263. I challenge any man to show me, anybody, and I know this tape goes around the world. Any man, any bishop that will come to my study and before this congregation and point their finger to one place, anybody was ever baptized in the name of the father, son, and holy ghost in the New Testament. I'll show you where every person that ever was baptized and those who were baptized different had to come and be rebaptized to get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do about it? Stay out there in your creeds. Stay out there in your dogmas and die. You're guilty with wicked hands. You've took the prince of life, the word of life, and crucified it to the people. Now, what did they do? They didn't know it. Today, men walk ignorantly. &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T KNOW THAT'S THE TRUTH. They think it's some kind of a ism. THEY DON'T DIG DOWN deep enough to get into the spirit of revelation. They don't pray enough. THEY DON'T CALL UPON GOD ENOUGH. THEY JUST lightly take it. Oh, well, I believe there's a God. Sure. The devil believes THE SAME THING. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL BELIEVES IT more than some people claim to believe. &gt;&gt; The devil BELIEVES IT AND TREMBLES. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE just believe it and GO ON, BUT THE DEVIL TREMBLES KNOWING HIS JUDGMENT is coming. &gt;&gt; And people believe it and don't pay no attention. The judgment is coming. &gt;&gt; So they don't dig down deep enough. Some people want questions answered that they didn't even pray about themselves. &gt;&gt; I got a question. I got a question. Did you even pray about that? &gt;&gt; Did you even search the Lord's word about your question? &gt;&gt; And then did you take it to the Lord in prayer &gt;&gt; and get the assurance that prayer brings to you? &gt;&gt; So we're not just praying with the formality. Yeah, I prayed about that. No, you're praying until he answers WITH AN ASSURANCE DOWN in your heart. &gt;&gt; Wait, &gt;&gt; stop or go forward. &gt;&gt; SOME KIND OF INSTRUCTIONS HE'LL GIVE you when you pray about it. &gt;&gt; It's not everything going to be answered right now. challenges me how I am that that way and how we're that way. Well, we want the answers to uh deep problems, developing stories, things that are going on right now. We want the answers right now. Well, you got to pray about it. You got to dig down deep. Dig down deep. Yes, that's what he said. Take a pick. Take a shovel. Does any of you all do most of us know what a pick and a shovel is? &gt;&gt; We know how to keep our nails nice and clean. I'm talking about men supposed to be men cleanest fingernails I've ever seen. Soft hands don't know what labor is. What's a pick? What's a shovel? Man, you need to go dig a ditch. &gt;&gt; LIKE ALL DAY. &gt;&gt; GO DIG a ditch. And this attitude, this softness, this weakness that can't even pray an hour. I I'm I'm going to be real honest with you. It takes It takes some endurance and strength to pray an hour. How many know what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; Yeah. The men come together and pray typically on Saturday mornings. 5 am to 5 a.m. &gt;&gt; If we made it six, would you come? &gt;&gt; What time actually works for you? And whatever time we would make it still wouldn't come. SOME STILL WOULDN'T COME. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TIME. It's something else going on there. to pray for an hour to really get into those layers of prayer &gt;&gt; where you get the world off of your mind and you start getting all these things off of your mind. It takes a little time to dig. You start digging down in the atmosphere of your life, communing with the Lord, DIGGING DOWN WITH THE SCRIPTURES, WITH THE QUOTATIONS, DIGGING DOWN DEEPER AND DEEPER UNTIL GOD &gt;&gt; GIVES YOU a revelation. &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. WHEN GOD OPENS UP A DIAMOND FROM HIS WORD, &gt;&gt; WHEN HE OPENS UP A JEWEL FROM HIS WORD, &gt;&gt; YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR, YOU'VE BEEN FASTING FOR, YOU'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR, THEN HE OPENS IT UP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; No man can take that from you. &gt;&gt; No church can TAKE IT FROM YOU. NO GROUP OF PEOPLE CAN TAKE IT FROM YOU. UPON THIS ROCK, I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH. AND THE gates of hell shall not be able to prevail against it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So God ordained mysteries to be there. Brother Bham opens up that these mysteries or these revelations people don't pray enough for them. So when did he say that? Was that in 1950? This was after the seal, sweetheart. &gt;&gt; You know, we're always looking for an excuse, right? When did he say that? What does it matter? &gt;&gt; Look, IT WAS AFTER THE SEALS. HE SAID IT. HE SAID IT. I DIDN'T HE SAID IT. WE DON'T PRAY ENOUGH. WE DON'T DIG DOWN DEEP ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; To get into the spirit of revelation. &gt;&gt; We want it handed to us. We want our food door dashed to us &gt;&gt; and they can't get it fast enough. Pretty soon we'll ask the Door Dash driver, can you open the door and feed me too? Where are we going with this? &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. &gt;&gt; The open door was an age. It was the time that this revelation of who Jesus was was open. That's just one of the mysteries that the scriptures in Matthew 13 are unfolding to us. So, Brother Bam goes deeper that the that they don't pray enough. They don't call on God enough. They don't dig down deep enough. Say, "Are you talking about me?" No, I'm talking about they they don't dig down deep enough. Them over there, the other group, the other church. Doesn't that make us feel better? Pastor ain't talking about me. No, he's talking about them over there. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the ones that ain't in here, right? &gt;&gt; Ain't nobody saying nothing. &gt;&gt; Who the Who's this quote talking to? &gt;&gt; Them, right? THEY HE NOT TALKING ABOUT ME. HE NOT TALKING ABOUT US. &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; WHO IS HE TALKING ABOUT? THEY DON'T PRAY ENOUGH. THEY DON'T DIG DOWN DEEP ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; WHAT HAS GOD REVEALED TO you &gt;&gt; about what you're reading in your Bible? WHAT HAS HE REVEALED TO YOU ABOUT THIS MESSAGE? WHAT HAS HE REVEALED TO YOU ABOUT THE WHAT THE CHURCHES ARE DOING TODAY AND ALL THE ONSLAUGHT OF CRITICISM TODAY? and the explanations that we're trying to defend the message through an explanation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. But God didn't build his church upon an explanation. &gt;&gt; He doesn't build it up on some some knowledge of some group. &gt;&gt; HE BUILT IT UPON A REVELATION. Upon this rock, I build my church. Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we see there's keys that need to be unlocked. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, give me a key this morning. &gt;&gt; Give me a key that I can go to my job and just start unlocking some things. &gt;&gt; Go to my prayer life and unlock it. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen to that? &gt;&gt; There's a key to the door. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the door. Jesus is the faith. He is all. But you you enter in through the through through through your submission to his word. &gt;&gt; And as you submit to his word, he opens up more of it. And as you receive it, he gives you more. &gt;&gt; Now, the scriptures are really clear. Matthew 11:28 says, "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and do what? Learn of me, &gt;&gt; and ye shall find rest unto your souls, for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4:9, there remainth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works. Let us do what? Labor. Somebody knows their Bible there. Thank you, brother Chuck. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us labor therefore to do what? &gt;&gt; To enter into that rest. &gt;&gt; We just want the rest part. The rest. I'm coming to rest. I'm coming to rest. No. No more works. I don't have to do nothing. Jesus did it all for me. &gt;&gt; Did he repent for you? &gt;&gt; No. He's not going to repent for you. You got to repent for you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You have to make up your decision. Make up your mind. You repent. He that stole steal no more. &gt;&gt; Turn from your wicked ways. Let the things of the world go. You have to let it go. &gt;&gt; You labor to enter into that rest. These modernday movements have presented a gospel where there's no work for the believer and it's just simply not scriptural. You know, you don't work for your salvation, but there are uh by by grace. Ephesians 2:8 says, "By grace are you saved through faith, not of works, lest any man should boast." And then it continues continues on to now to him that workketh is a reward, not reckon of grace, but to him that workketh not, but believe it. His faith is counted for righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Titus 3:5, "Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us." But the scriptures continue to go on. It says, James says, "If you say you have faith with no works, your faith is dead &gt;&gt; because it's being alone." Titus 3:8, "They that which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works." Matthew 5:16, "Let your light shine that they may see your good works." You have works to do, but they're founded upon the great work that he did at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Father, &gt;&gt; he died. &gt;&gt; He died so that I could live right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He didn't die so I can live like the devil. He died so a change can come in my heart AND I CAN LIVE RIGHT, give right, do right, take a stand right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the mysteries are there for the reason. Now one of these mysteries was the blindness that happened to Israel. that these Jews actually cried out for his blood and missed him after thousands of years waiting for the Messiah to come. But in the fifth seal, as the seals are open to us in Revelation chapter 6, let's turn there briefly. And like I said, there's 13 mysteries that Scoffield mentions. Brother Brandham adds the other ones afterwards in that same line of thinking. It goes deeper. But in Revelations chapter number six, verse number N says this. That's not the heater that's on, is it? Thank you. Revelation 6 verse number N. When he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. They cried with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, dust thou judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" and white robes were given unto every one of them. And it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled. Now the messenger preaches this message, the revelation of the seven seals. And he preached that message for who? Who was that sent to? Just the pastors, just the brothers. No sisters need to read this. Young people, you got to be at least 15 to read your seal book. But you read everything else online. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Oh, no. The seals are too deep. What they looking at? What is Nickelodeon telling them? &gt;&gt; I mean, that's a old one. Is anybody looking at Nickelodeon? That's the last one I remember. Huh? What do they call it today? You don't want to tell me, do you? Which one is it that they looking at? These little young people, they want to tell me, but they don't want to tell me looking at that advanced nonsense, can read it, engulf it, be become one, become characters with it, consume it. And then when it comes to your seal book, it it it becomes like, no, that's a deep mystery. You all just talking about mysteries. Learn how to love. You can't learn how to love until you love his word. And his word gave us the seven seals. &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness, somebody? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's just take this one revelation that brother Brandham opens up to us. What is taking place here &gt;&gt; in Revelation chapter 6 under this fifth seal? &gt;&gt; This is one of the mysteries of blindness happening to Israel. These are the most religious people. These were people that were extremely faithful. These were holy people set apart for ages. Ate a certain way, dressed a certain way. Not for 10 years, not for five. I'm talking about for hundreds of years. Their whole life was centered around catching our king is coming. We had David. We had Solomon. WE HAD ALL OF OUR KINGS. Our land has BEEN TAKEN. BUT ONE DAY A KING IS GOING TO COME. AND WHEN HE CAME, THEY MISSED HIM. HOW HOW DID THEY MISS HIM? WELL, there's a mystery why they missed him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And let's share it with you. Okay, &gt;&gt; I have seven minutes. &gt;&gt; Whose church am I in anyway? &gt;&gt; Somebody help me in here. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Here, the prophet of God says this here, paragraph 215. Well, now just a minute. We'll find out. Look, these are not the souls of the bride church. Not at all. We thought that that was the bride church waiting there. Souls under the altar. You see, crying, "How long, Lord, how long?" Let me read it again. When he had opened this fifth seal, I saw on the alt under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony they held. See, the word of God and the testimony which they held. Now, don't move from there just a minute. See, he continues reading. Drop down to paragraph 218. Now, for they at this time, if you notice the fifth seal being open, see the church is gone. It just can't be. The souls under the the early church. Now, please, if you did give this attention now, cuz this is great controversy. So, I want you to listen real close now and you got your papers and things right with it. Now I want you to notice now these cannot be themselves because the souls of the righteous martyed and the righteous people the church the bride has done been took up so they wouldn't be under the altar they would they would be in glory with the bride now watch for they are gone in the rapture in the fourth chapter of revelation they was taken up now who are these souls then that's the next thing who are they in if they're not the early church. This is Israel that's to be saved as a nation. All of them that are predestinated, that's Israel. That's Israel itself. You see, you say, "Oh, wait a minute. You say that it can't." Oh, yes, they are to be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's settle it here just a minute. I got four or five scriptures. I'll take one. Let's take Romans just a minute. And to find out, let's take the book of Romans, the 11th chapter. Romans and we'll find out. Just let us just just read it. Read it ourselves. See, and he takes that. For I would not, brethren, that you should be ignorant of the mystery. Let us should we wise in our own conceit. There you are. That blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fulfilling fullness of the Gentiles we come in. the last gentile bride be brought in for the bride the blindness come to Israel for that purpose. And so all Israel shall be saved as it is written. There shall come out of Zion a deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob. Right? They are Israel. That's under the altar. Watch. Israel was blinded for the very purpose of us being saved. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Now, who blinded them? God. GOD BLINDED HIS OWN CHILDREN. No wonder Jesus standing there at the cross and them Jews howling for his blood. That was his own kids. And he was the scripture. He was his himself the word. And here he knowing that those PEOPLE WOULD HAVE GLADLY received him and that's the reason he BLINDED THEM SO THEY WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM. He come in such a humble way and blinded them to it that they wouldn't receive it. The scripture says they would do it and he blinded was blinded. Jesus pied them even so much he says, "Father, forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. They were blind." Let me ask you something. If God blinds you, would you be able to see? &gt;&gt; Huh? Brother Bam is telling us here, this is showing the grace of God to us. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT IF GOD DIDN'T BLIND THEM, they would have seen him. And he knows they would have seen him. SO HE BLINDED THEM SO he could not so they would not see him. Excuse me. Sorry. Trying to work with this mic here. He blinded them, didn't he? &gt;&gt; He blinded their eyes so they wouldn't see him. &gt;&gt; And why did he blind them? He blinded them so that you would see him. &gt;&gt; So that the Gentiles would see him. &gt;&gt; I don't know. That just done something to me as I was thinking about this great mystery. &gt;&gt; That if God blinds a man's eyes, he can't see. &gt;&gt; But the other side is when God opens a man's eyes, he can't help but see. AND I'M SO GLAD &gt;&gt; THAT HE OPENED MY EYES SO THAT I can see. &gt;&gt; That's the reason these mysteries we received them. &gt;&gt; We received them because they WERE GIVEN TO US TO RECEIVE THEM. HE BLINDED ONE AND HE OPENED THE EYES TO the other. &gt;&gt; You are the ones he opened his eyes to. It is God's amazing grace. &gt;&gt; Everybody can't see what you see. &gt;&gt; Everybody can't walk like you. Everybody can't be you. But we're so glad he made us who we are. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him today? &gt;&gt; Amen. We love him today. &gt;&gt; We give him praise. The Jews couldn't see him, but I can see him. And I'm so glad he opened my eyes. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise and thanksgiving for his goodness for his mercy. &gt;&gt; It's a mystery that I'm standing up here talking to y'all. &gt;&gt; It's a mystery that some of y'all even got a friend. IT'S A MYSTERY THAT I HAVE A FRIEND. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD IN HIS GRACE AND HIS MERCY UNLOCKED A MYSTERY. CLICK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You got some people who you you love and they love you too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a great mystery &gt;&gt; of our lives. May God bless you richly. Let's bow our heads and pray. Amen. Musicians come. Lord Jesus, thank you for your word today. We thank you, Lord, for the mystery that Israel was blinded so that I could come in. &gt;&gt; You blinded Israel so that Israel, me, could come in. &gt;&gt; I think of that. That's so so humbling to think that you blinded your children's eyes so that we could come in. This is just one of many mysteries that you have given to us. &gt;&gt; This mystery is under these seven seals. And the enemy wants us to stay away from them, criticize us for talking about them. But oh God, you've given it to us because your grace allowed us to have ears to hear and eyes to see. Lord, may we receive more, more, more. May we dig deeper into the word of life. Dig deeper and find more keys to our life. Find more answers to our life. Lord, there's questions that come up in this even in this city, even in this church, even in our families. Questions that come up, Lord. Lord, let us not be so impatient that we can't wait on you, that we can't lay it down at the altar. begin to dig deep and deeper and deeper until we reach into those channels of divine revelation that you alone can reveal to us. Oh God, we thank you for the time tested memorial. You test every word before you put it in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Your prophet told us that &gt;&gt; you tested every prophet that wrote every word. You tested THE CHILDREN OF GOD that are in the Bible. You test every son, every daughter, every material that comes into the body of Christ must be tested. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh God, your sons are tested. Your daughters are tested. The youth are tested. The ministry IS TESTED. THE OLD-TIMERS ARE TESTED. THE NEWCOMERS are tested BECAUSE YOU BUILD YOUR KINGDOM WITH REAL MATERIAL. YOU BUILD YOUR CHURCH WITH a revelation. Upon this rock, I'll build my church. Oh God, let it be. Let it be, Lord. that we would embrace that and not be critical of it. We thank you, Father. We ask that your grace and mercy would follow each one from the youngest one here, some of the young people, the newcomers to the oldest one here. Lord, may you bless them today. May they receive these good things down in their soul. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; No greater love ever know Lord. Oh Lord I love you. Lord I love you. Lord, I love I love you, Lord, and I want to serve. Amen. Let's all stand to our feet. You've been so good. So good. So good. Every knee all the grace gater known. Oh Lord, oh Lord, I love you. Amen. And let's bow our heads. I'm going to give you the opportunity to respond to the scriptures, to the word of God in your heart and in your life. The waters are troubled. The word has come forth. This, my brother, my sisters, is probably one of the best atmospheres for you to receive more of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I would love for you to take advantage of that. the atmosphere of believers, the songs of Zion. It's why we come here. And I would ask you even just right at your seat there, right in your heart to really take advantage of this atmosphere to receive a portion of his word and opening it up to your heart and into your life. If you're a young person, if you're older, if whoever you are, he he calls you. He calls you to his word and he opens it up to you. If if you've been a little dilitary or a little slack concerning some of these promises, if you don't dig into them like you should, spend that time in prayer, not just praying for this or job or praying for that, praying actually praying for a deeper revelation, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; of the mysteries to open up in your life. the hidden truths from the foundation of THE WORLD, BUT NOW ARE BEING revealed &gt;&gt; to his saints. To his saints, they're being revealed. And if you every head bowed, every eye closed and you want to be included in this prayer to to make that move to go deeper in the revelation of Jesus Christ just as a to break gravity just to as a Why don't you lift up your hand to him in prayer? God bless all those hands. I see some young hands. I see some old hands. &gt;&gt; I see some some worried hands. &gt;&gt; I see some hands, Lord, that been through. But Lord, we need more of you. Oh God, take every one of these hands &gt;&gt; and the hearts beneath that hand, Lord, and open up the revelation as you've given it to the saints. These are your saints. May you grant it, Lord. May they receive if it's more faith for salvation, for their children, for their life, for their career, for their church, for whatever they're going through, Lord, to receive that in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, you take every hand, you take every heart, and you answer that request in the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. We receive it, Lord. We receive it, Lord. I receive it this morning, Lord. Every blessing, every promise, EVERY TRUTH YOU HAVE FOR ME, LORD, I receive it, &gt;&gt; oh God. May you grant it &gt;&gt; in Jesus name we pray. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Oh let's just give him praise. Let's just thank him. Thank you Lord. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Amen. Thank you Lord. Amen. God bless you. I'll turn this over to a song leader tonight. Brother Papiso will take the to service and he has a um we took an offering there in Mesa. He has two main needs there. A couple many needs. He's in the rural area. And I he never says this. I had to ask him. And I asked him about where he lives and uh you know he just lives in a rural place and uh he could move to a big city but he stays amongst his people. That's where God called him and the little ministry that he does. He used to put brother Brandham on the radio station. They doubled or increased that cost. He had to take it off and he had a little other little PA system to get the word out to the people. And so I've known him since 20 2022. When was that? Yeah, when he first came. And um good brother, solid. I love him. So we'll have an offering to take up for him tonight if you want to bring something to support his ministry and the work there. So God bless you so much. Amen. We'll turn to service. Thank you to me. You met my every need. All the grace you shown. No greater love I've ever known. Oh Lord, I love you. Let's tell him that again. Oh Lord, I love you.
