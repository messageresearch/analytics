[1:46] be you may be seated brother
[1:49] brother just like some guy start trying
[1:51] to fuss with you if you know where to
[1:53] stand know what he believes it's just
[1:56] like taking a rabbit and turning loose
[1:58] in a pen and you got every whole stopped
[2:00] up you stand at the gate he's got to
[2:01] come
[2:03] back he have to come right back to the
[2:05] gate again cuz that's the only way he
[2:06] can get
[2:07] out he'll stick his head to here and
[2:09] almost break his neck go over there and
[2:11] over there can stand watching he come
[2:13] right back that's that's the only way to
[2:16] stay with that
[2:17] word you can B all around your Creed
[2:20] just break your neck everywhere but you
[2:21] got to come right back to
[2:23] [Music]
[2:26] this now see they they they they don't
[2:30] want it they don't want God's word
[2:34] because she held her Traditions she kept
[2:36] the word of God from being of not effect
[2:39] the same now on spiritual Eve she don't
[2:44] want she wants to keep her traditions
[2:46] and get away from the word of God she
[2:49] holds uh again to the denominations and
[2:53] her Creeds in Traditions of her Elders
[2:56] instead of taking the word of God and
[2:58] when the promise of the word in the last
[3:01] days is brought to
[3:04] her she will not receive it because with
[3:08] her Traditions like the Hebrew bride did
[3:13] the real word though
[3:17] manifested
[3:19] proven
[3:21] Vindicated amen amen you won't have
[3:25] it why won't you because there's your
[3:28] time amen
[3:30] she can't do
[3:32] it that's right she can't beat her type
[3:36] see it's predicted she' do it so how you
[3:40] go to keep from anything now the only
[3:41] thing you do just be happy you're in
[3:43] that's all W
[3:45] for Lord all right God promised in the
[3:49] last days that he would manifest and
[3:51] would
[3:53] vindicate his word to her and still she
[3:56] wouldn't do it all that God promised her
[4:02] by his servants the prophets God
[4:05] promised through Jesus
[4:08] Christ God pro Joel God promis who Paul
[4:13] God promis who Malachi John God promised
[4:16] to John the Revelator all them prophets
[4:19] just did exactly what the last message
[4:22] would be to
[4:24] her now if you want to write them down
[4:26] of course you all know them Jesus is
[4:29] John 14:12 and Joel Joel 238 Paul 2
[4:34] Timothy 3 uh Malachi 4th chapter and
[4:38] John the Revelator uh Revelations 10:17
[4:40] 1-
[4:42] 17 exactly what would take place now
[4:45] amen and to the church what is it the
[4:49] Incarnate Word made flesh amongst his
[4:53] people
[4:55] again and they just don't believe it
[4:59] amen you know what Jesus said when he
[5:01] seen when he done them Miracles before
[5:03] them and proved that he was God proved
[5:06] that that what he was doing he was he
[5:08] had done exactly he he said to them he
[5:10] said oh you capernium who is exalted
[5:14] into heaven if the works have been
[5:16] mighty Works have been done in Sodom
[5:19] that's been done in you would be
[5:20] standing today that's right and and
[5:23] Caper him he never done nothing but heal
[5:24] a few people and told them the secrets
[5:26] of their hearts and walked out am that's
[5:29] all see they don't know what Mighty
[5:31] works are they think it has to be a
[5:33] great big program where everybody gets
[5:36] up the judge makes a speech and and the
[5:38] bands playing the colors flying and the
[5:41] well-dressed
[5:43] women tering and all the PHD llds the
[5:47] big call hats and turned around collars
[5:49] and everything they all had to walk in
[5:51] that's something great God says that's
[5:54] foolish and he brings up a little
[5:56] something don't know what difference
[5:58] between Maybe
[6:01] ABCs Harley and performs something it
[6:05] just sets the real Church a fire and the
[6:07] rest them a bunch of Holy
[6:09] Rollers God calls that great and the
[6:11] world calls it foolish the world calls
[6:14] that great God calls that foolish just
[6:17] vice versa and the thing that God has
[6:21] promised God will and has
[6:25] done amen here we are now still she
[6:31] remains as she did the Hebrew Eve she
[6:34] just wouldn't do it you could raise up
[6:36] the
[6:38] dead you could see the spirit of God
[6:40] Jesus came down Vindicated himself to be
[6:43] the Son of God first he started
[6:45] preaching well they thought well kind of
[6:48] odd likee fell uh who is he anyhow well
[6:51] the first thing you know people going to
[6:52] say of course it said before when his
[6:54] Forerunner come John they said are you
[6:56] the Messiah said no but he's standing
[6:58] among you somewhere
[7:00] see why he know when his message taken
[7:04] place what he was to do am he knowed
[7:09] what he was going to do just like Noah
[7:12] kept watching Enoch when Enoch went Noah
[7:15] said better get close to your Ark the
[7:18] time is at hand Noah kept watching Enoch
[7:22] see and John watched for the sign that
[7:27] Jesus told him or God told him to watch
[7:30] he said he's standing right here now
[7:31] somewhere among you I don't know him but
[7:34] I will know
[7:35] him stand there they said why you the
[7:37] Messiah said we were sent from the
[7:39] headquarters said um the elders and all
[7:42] sent us down here if you're the Messiah
[7:44] won't you come up and make yourself KN
[7:45] up there not down here in this bunch of
[7:47] stuff down
[7:48] here just come up there and make
[7:50] yourself know what he said I'm not the
[7:52] Messiah he said I'm the voice of one
[7:55] crying in the wilderness that went as
[7:57] far over their head as they can go they
[7:59] didn't know nothing about him and yet
[8:01] that's all looking for him to come but
[8:03] it couldn't be a guy like that oh my
[8:05] that would be terrible what school are
[8:07] you from
[8:08] none have you got your fellowship card
[8:11] what is
[8:13] it he was anointed of God said one thing
[8:17] I have the ax is laid to the RO of the
[8:19] tree now that's all that's all he had he
[8:23] talked in terms of a Woodsman not the
[8:26] terms of a clergyman viers axes trees
[8:30] and so forth he didn't talk in
[8:32] ecclesiastical terms but Jesus said
[8:35] there never was a prophet like him never
[8:38] a man born of a woman like him until
[8:40] he's day right he was more than a
[8:43] prophet he was a messenger of the
[8:46] Covenant stood right between the the the
[8:49] two dispensations coming in see more
[8:52] than a prophet and so then um then they
[8:56] didn't know him they didn't understand
[8:58] him was kind of odd like s fell so they
[9:00] just missed him see and um when Jesus
[9:03] come then and surely they wasn't going
[9:05] to accept him this Carpenters boy there
[9:07] wasn't nothing like that with a black
[9:08] name behind him of illegitimate even
[9:11] they see a fell like that but U but look
[9:14] what God did he took the unlearned poor
[9:18] fishermen Woodsman farmers and
[9:23] harlots and left the dignitary set there
[9:27] why what why did he do do it why did he
[9:31] do such a thing could you imagine
[9:33] because that them people recognize him
[9:38] to be the
[9:40] word hallelujah now let's just watch him
[9:42] just a minute here's an old ignorant
[9:44] fisherman can't write his name the Bible
[9:47] said he was ignorant and unlearned he
[9:49] brings his fish up and sets it down goes
[9:52] down there and sees what all this noise
[9:53] is about but way down de inning he knew
[9:58] that the Bible say said that the Messiah
[10:01] all Hebrews look for the
[10:03] Messiah because there was to be a
[10:05] scriptural thing happened when he comes
[10:08] there had been a lot of Messiah raised
[10:10] up said I'm he and let him off with the
[10:12] hundreds and and Parish and everything
[10:15] but see that was a throw off the real
[10:16] one when it comes we've had Elijah's
[10:19] Manel and coats and every other thing
[10:22] but that that's that's that's just to
[10:23] throw off the real thing when he does
[10:25] come that's right all kinds of people
[10:28] it's wore the robes and the garments and
[10:30] been buried in all kinds of hoods turned
[10:32] around and everything else I don't that
[10:35] just only vindicates like a bogus dollar
[10:37] shows there's a good one somewhere if he
[10:38] just
[10:39] find so here he come now these
[10:43] dignitaries come out they were so on
[10:45] their substitute well they said now if
[10:48] the Messiah comes he'll certainly come
[10:50] to cesis he'll come to our denomination
[10:52] he'll come to the Pharisees the
[10:53] Sadducees that's what you think he'll
[10:55] come to the Sadducees there they was see
[10:57] the same thing they have today now but
[10:59] when he come it was strange he would
[11:03] come oh very contrary to what they
[11:06] thought but he come according to the
[11:08] word and they didn't know the
[11:11] word let me say that real so you it'll
[11:14] sink way
[11:16] down I want this to get it that's what's
[11:18] the matter with you
[11:21] today you don't know the
[11:23] [Music]
[11:26] word Jesus said you can discern to face
[11:29] the but the signs of time you can't
[11:31] discern so we Moses said if you know
[11:34] Moses you know
[11:37] me didn't know Moses and therefore they
[11:39] didn't know they just know a Creed that
[11:40] they hatch down amen now let's take this
[11:44] old fisherman sets his basket down PS
[11:47] his Gray beard down walks down see who
[11:49] it is brother said come on let's go down
[11:52] here that's that same guy said guy they
[11:53] said the other day I stayed all night
[11:55] with him last night you know John I was
[11:57] talking about yeah that Wild Man Down
[11:59] down there yeah I heard about him well
[12:01] uh old s know I heard about him down
[12:03] there yeah been two three months ago
[12:05] down there yeah what he said and one day
[12:07] he was standing there he said an odd
[12:09] thing he said you know Harry comes right
[12:12] now they said how do you know looked her
[12:13] it's an ordinary fellow standing there
[12:15] he said I see the spirit of God like a
[12:17] dove coming down I hear a voice saying
[12:20] this is him this is my beloved Son in
[12:23] whom I am pleased to dwell
[12:26] in then he walked out the water and back
[12:29] and so forth well there he said he knew
[12:32] him oh I don't know Simon said I've
[12:34] heard all that long of time but here he
[12:36] comes up the down in his heart was a
[12:38] predestinated
[12:39] seed Jesus said so amen right amen walks
[12:43] up to him walks up I'll go down to
[12:44] meeting and see walks up there Jesus
[12:47] standing there just an ordinary little
[12:48] fell walked up and said why your name is

[13:02] life seed struck in there yes sir wait a
[13:06] minute how's that you never did see me
[13:10] neither did you know my dad cuz he' been
[13:11] dead for years but here you come tell me
[13:13] that now I know that the Bible says now
[13:17] I have to not go back what the Elder
[13:18] says but the Bible said that the Messiah
[13:22] would be a prophet there he is that's
[13:26] him one day he passed through Samaria
[13:29] going down through there with a bunch of
[13:30] Jews you left them and this little ill

[14:10] give is
[14:12] life what see why she said um well you

[14:32] Spirit and
[14:34] Truth well she begin to study you know
[14:37] he said go get your husband and come
[14:39] here she said my
[14:42] husband I haven't got any husband I said
[14:45] that's the truth said said you've been
[14:48] running around with five got the sixth
[14:50] one now and said you've had five and and
[14:54] you you know you told the truth watch
[14:56] what was it that light
[14:59] struck that seed been laying there that
[15:02] was spoke by
[15:04] God yes sir the seed was on the earth
[15:08] when God moved the water away and the
[15:10] sun HD it it come
[15:12] up that's all it needed was Sun the life
[15:17] yes
[15:19] sir and then when the Holy Spirit in him
[15:24] moved away her past life sh show it to
[15:29] her that light struck and she said sir I
[15:32] perceive you're a
[15:34] prophet she said we know I know it that
[15:38] when Messiah comes that's what he's
[15:40] going to be and we ain't had a prophet
[15:42] for hundreds of
[15:44] years we have never had a true Prophet
[15:47] for hundreds of
[15:48] years and she said H you tell me about
[15:51] my husband and told me how many have had
[15:54] and so forth well I said I don't
[15:56] understand this said when Messiah cometh
[15:58] well he's to do that but who are
[16:00] you said I'm me that was
[16:04] it a Hallelujah and the priest looked
[16:07] around said well they have to answer to
[16:08] the congregation don't fool that fell
[16:10] he's he's possessed of a
[16:12] devil that's the difference that's the
[16:15] same thing today same thing today it's
[16:18] just exactly y yes sir she she knew it
[16:21] because the light Struck it they them
[16:25] fishermen Woodsman farmers Tax
[16:29] Collectors harlots they seen in him what
[16:33] the simple scripture said he would
[16:36] do and the Pharisees couldn't see
[16:39] because of their tradition
[16:48] amen they couldn't see because of
[16:50] traditions but the prostitute the
[16:54] farmers and all them they saw it all
[16:58] that was
[17:00] predestinated when the doubts rolled
[17:02] away the seed went to Growing that's
[17:04] right what did she do she said well I'm
[17:07] glad I met them oh no brother right into
[17:10] the city she went she forgot about the
[17:12] water she said come see a man who told
[17:16] me the things that I've done isn't this
[17:18] the very thing that the scripture says
[17:20] messiah's going to do isn't this exactly
[17:24] that and the people could see that same
[17:27] thing as Jesus Jesus Christ said in St
[17:30] John
[17:31] 14:12 it will happen again he said it
[17:35] also in Luke when he said as it was in
[17:37] the days of Noah how God manifested
[17:39] himself in a man and told who was behind
[17:41] him and what uh Sarah did laughing in
[17:44] the tent and all these scriptures of
[17:46] Malachi and so forth predicted in the
[17:49] last days am Hebrews 4 said when the
[17:53] word comes back Malachi 4 said it would
[17:57] return back
[17:59] the Hebrews 4 said the word of God
[18:03] discerns the thoughts that's in the
[18:06] heart and they can see it done and walk
[18:10] right away from it their Traditions hide
[18:12] it makes it nonaffective
[18:14] well we're just here that's
[18:20] all you know he could do the same thing
[18:22] today he'd come right on the scene and
[18:24] produce the same things he did then as
[18:26] he said he would see he promised to do
[18:29] it yes amen he promised to do it and if
[18:32] he would do the same thing the lady
[18:36] OFA messenger is supposed to do it and
[18:40] then if the lady of see a church sees it
[18:43] done they'll do just exactly like the
[18:45] Hebrew Church did the
[18:47] [Music]
[18:48] beginning no matter how well Vindicated
[18:51] is oh it do it anyhow oh my now it says
[18:55] that we would return to the original
[18:57] word and be made manifested his promise
[19:00] to restore
[19:02] again the faith original Faith
[19:06] again and if he made himself knowing
[19:10] that he was dwelling amongst his people
[19:12] by doing these things he could even have
[19:15] his picture
[19:16] taken scientifically Pro it and still
[19:20] they don't believe
[19:22] it he
[19:24] could let the mechanical eye of the
[19:26] camera catch him standing there that
[19:28] same same pillar fire same yesterday
[19:30] today and forever Hebrews
[19:32] 13:8 to show that it's scientific in
[19:36] every other way scientifically in the
[19:39] spiritual Realms and every way it could
[19:41] be Vindicated is Vindicated and you know
[19:44] that probably do the same thing they
[19:46] probably just walk right away and do the
[19:48] same thing as they did oh God help
[19:52] us we'll just stop here God help us to
[19:54] see now my prayer as we come now because
[19:58] a don't want to keep you too late God
[20:01] help us to
[20:02] see I believe maybe the spirit upon us
[20:05] to be right now that he' help us to
[20:07] reveal open up this
[20:11] seal
[20:13] that's as we see the state the church is
[20:17] in we see where it has been seeing what
[20:19] they did seeing where it was supposed to
[20:22] come see it there and see what they're
[20:24] supposed to do they did just
[20:27] that now you see where we're at you do
[20:29] the judging I can't
[20:32] judge I'm just responsible for bringing
[20:35] this word just it's just give to me I
[20:38] can give it until it's give to me I
[20:40] can't give it no one else
[20:42] can and when he had opened the third
[20:45] seal I heard the third Beast say come
[20:47] and see it and I beheld in law a black
[20:50] horse and he that set on him at a pair
[20:52] of balances in his
[20:54] hand and I heard the voice in the midst
[20:57] of the four Beast saying a measure of
[21:00] wheat for a penny and three measures of
[21:03] barley for a penny but see thou hurt not
[21:07] the oil and
[21:08] wine
[21:10] now the Lamb's got the book in his hand
[21:13] breaking the seals broke the first one
[21:16] second one now he breaks the third one
[21:19] and as he breaks it the lamb breaks it
[21:22] the third seal the third Beast now how
[21:25] many know what the third Beast look like
[21:26] look like a man the first look like a
[21:29] lion the other looked like a calf or ox
[21:32] and the third one looked like a man is a
[21:36] man and he heard the the living creature
[21:38] the the Beast living creature like a man

[1:04:10] sure you all know brother Luke and Luke
[1:04:12] said I'm gonna be in Arkansas this
[1:04:15] weekend and then I talked to another
[1:04:17] brother of mine brother Nathan Bryant

[1:04:21] he said I'm going to be in Arkansas this
[1:04:24] weekend so all the big names are in

[1:04:29] here with
[1:04:30] you amen so we're so grateful to be in
[1:04:33] the house of the Lord Exodus the 3r
[1:04:35] chapter uh and we'll read for a little
[1:04:37] text this morning now Moses kept the
[1:04:40] flock of Jethro his father-in-law the
[1:04:42] priest of Midian and led the flock to
[1:04:45] the backside of the desert and came to
[1:04:47] the Mountain of God even to Horeb and
[1:04:50] the angel of the Lord appeared to him in
[1:04:51] a flame of fire out of the midst of the
[1:04:54] Bush and he looked and behold the bush
[1:04:56] burned with fire and the Bush was not
[1:04:58] consumed and Moses said I will now turn
[1:05:01] aside and see this great sight why the
[1:05:04] bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw
[1:05:07] that he turned aside to see God called
[1:05:10] unto him out of the midst of the Bush
[1:05:11] and said Moses Moses and he said here am
[1:05:15] I and he said draw not nigh hither put
[1:05:18] off thy shoes from off thy feet for the
[1:05:21] place whereupon thou standest is Holy
[1:05:24] Ground more over he said I am the god of
[1:05:27] thy father the god of Abraham the god of
[1:05:30] Isaac the god of Jacob and Moses hid his
[1:05:33] face for he was afraid to look upon God
[1:05:36] and the Lord said I have surely seen the
[1:05:39] Affliction of my people which are in
[1:05:40] Egypt and I have heard their Cry by
[1:05:43] reason of their taskmasters for I know
[1:05:45] their sorrows and I notice the Lord said
[1:05:48] I and I am come down to deliver them out
[1:05:52] of the hand of the
[1:05:53] Egyptians and to bring them up out of
[1:05:56] that land a good land and a land uh
[1:05:59] large uh unto a land flowing with milk
[1:06:02] and honey Amen to that unto the place of
[1:06:06] the Canaanites and the Hittites and the
[1:06:09] amorites and the perizzites and the
[1:06:10] hivites and the jebusites now therefore
[1:06:13] Behold The Cry of the children of Israel
[1:06:15] has come unto me and I have also seen
[1:06:17] the oppression wherewith the Egyptians
[1:06:19] oppress them come now therefore and I
[1:06:21] will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou
[1:06:24] mayest bring forth my people people the
[1:06:25] children of Israel out of Egypt and
[1:06:28] Moses said unto God who am I that I
[1:06:30] should go unto pharaoh and that I should
[1:06:32] bring forth the children of Israel out
[1:06:34] of Egypt and he said certainly I will be
[1:06:36] with thee and this shall be a token unto
[1:06:39] thee that I have sent thee when thou H
[1:06:41] has brought forth the people out of
[1:06:42] Egypt ye shall serve God Upon This
[1:06:46] Mountain Amen Let the Lord add His
[1:06:49] blessings to the reading of his word
[1:06:50] let's just bow our heads father we thank
[1:06:52] you today for the the precious word word
[1:06:55] that we have read and Lord that we thank
[1:06:58] you for the songs that's been sung we
[1:07:00] thank you for these specials that we had
[1:07:02] today Lord and Lord we just thank you
[1:07:04] for Lord a place to worship you and a
[1:07:07] house dedicated to your service and we
[1:07:10] ask oh God that you would bless the
[1:07:12] further part of this service now I pray
[1:07:15] that you would watch over me and Lord
[1:07:17] bind my lips before I'd speak anything
[1:07:19] unpleasing to you and we'll commit it
[1:07:21] into your hands in the name of the Lord
[1:07:23] Jesus Christ and the church said amen
[1:07:27] God bless you may be
[1:07:35] seated I'd like to take a little text
[1:07:38] this
[1:07:39] morning of your failures are not your
[1:07:45] future the
[1:07:48] Lord your failures are not your
[1:07:52] future and we read this scripture this
[1:07:56] morning that Moses was on the backside
[1:07:59] of the
[1:08:01] desert and he was tending his
[1:08:03] father-in-law's
[1:08:05] sheep and he probably felt like this was
[1:08:10] just how things were going to end up for
[1:08:13] him for 40 years he'd been out on the
[1:08:16] back side of the desert for 40 years
[1:08:18] he'd been hurting these sheep and he
[1:08:20] hadn't seen anything hardly of God since
[1:08:24] and he probably felt like he'd messed up
[1:08:26] to the point to where the Lord couldn't
[1:08:29] use him anymore right and then one day
[1:08:32] as he was heard those sheep he looked up
[1:08:34] on top of the mountain and he saw a bush
[1:08:37] and the bush didn't burn and the and and
[1:08:40] and God was attracting Moses's attention
[1:08:44] to the bush and he and he goes up to the
[1:08:46] bush and the bush speaks to him and says
[1:08:48] I am that I am and he says go down into
[1:08:53] Egypt and you tell them that the I am
[1:08:56] has sent
[1:08:58] you and he said you go to the Elders of
[1:09:01] Israel and you gather them together and
[1:09:04] you say that the Lord has visited you
[1:09:06] and you tell them that you will bring
[1:09:08] them out prise God that was a
[1:09:12] commission and he said then you go tell
[1:09:16] Pharaoh that the Lord spoke to you and
[1:09:20] told you to to lead his people to this
[1:09:23] mountain to worship
[1:09:25] and he said and and and and let me stop
[1:09:29] right here and just say this everything
[1:09:31] with God is Supernatural Saints we we
[1:09:34] can't explain God we can't organize God
[1:09:37] we can't put God in our box everything
[1:09:40] that God does is Supernatural and he
[1:09:43] does things the way he wants to do
[1:09:45] them amen and we can't explain what he's
[1:09:48] doing we don't understand all that he's
[1:09:50] doing but we have to trust that God is
[1:09:52] in
[1:09:53] control is that is that right this
[1:09:55] morning Saints and everything with God
[1:09:58] is Supernatural and and we find that the
[1:10:00] Lord said when you go down this is this
[1:10:03] is the crazy part he says when you go
[1:10:06] down I am sure that the king of Egypt
[1:10:09] will not let you
[1:10:11] go he's not going to listen he's not
[1:10:15] going to do that when I tell you to go
[1:10:17] do it you're he's not going to do what
[1:10:19] you tell him to do and he says but I the
[1:10:23] Lord will stretch out my hand and I will
[1:10:27] Smite Egypt with all my wonders and then
[1:10:31] he'll let you go amen oh and by the way
[1:10:35] you're not going to go empty you're not
[1:10:37] going to go empty-handed as a matter of
[1:10:39] fact you're going to tell them to give
[1:10:41] us your gold give us your oh
[1:10:46] God give us your reignment and and and
[1:10:49] give and we're going to take the the the
[1:10:51] stuff off of their sons and put it on
[1:10:53] our sons
[1:10:56] amen
[1:10:57] yes and God gave Moses this Great
[1:11:00] Commission and the God made it clear
[1:11:02] that he God Alone was going to deliver
[1:11:06] the
[1:11:06] people is that right out of Egypt now I
[1:11:11] think sometimes this is a lesson that we
[1:11:12] all got to learn Saints it's not us it's
[1:11:15] all him it's all God it's not our job to
[1:11:19] figure everything out it's not our job
[1:11:21] to work it all out it's his job he's in
[1:11:24] control
[1:11:27] it's not my place to to figure out how
[1:11:29] God's going to do it I just have to
[1:11:31] believe that he's going to do
[1:11:34] it see but God does use man to do things
[1:11:39] God does use women to do things God uses
[1:11:41] young people to do thing God uses old
[1:11:44] people to do things God uses
[1:11:46] people but it's still God Amen if God
[1:11:50] gives a gift in the church that gift is
[1:11:53] is a blessing but that's not the person
[1:11:54] that's God that the gift is in the
[1:11:58] person because God put that gift there
[1:12:01] it's God doing it it's God doing these
[1:12:04] things it's God orchestrating all of
[1:12:06] this we're just here acting out the play
[1:12:09] Saints but it's God who's got the
[1:12:16] program so the Lord told
[1:12:19] him to cast his rod on the ground and it
[1:12:22] became a serpent and he told him to put
[1:12:24] his hand in bosom and became lepos and
[1:12:26] then he healed him of that leprosy and
[1:12:28] then and then he said if they won't
[1:12:29] believe those two signs he said then you
[1:12:32] will Smite the river and it'll be turned
[1:12:34] to blood and they will believe that sign
[1:12:38] so here we have a man that had probably
[1:12:42] counted himself
[1:12:44] out now that happens to all of us for
[1:12:47] time to time Saints where we think you
[1:12:49] know what I I've wasted too much time
[1:12:51] I've made too many mistakes I've failed
[1:12:53] too often and was the feelings that
[1:12:56] Moses was dealing with Saints but but
[1:12:58] when Moses was 80 years old and had been
[1:13:00] a failure but God hadn't even got
[1:13:02] started with him
[1:13:05] yet
[1:13:08] on he Ain even got started yet sa now
[1:13:11] now now how many of you in here are 80
[1:13:13] years
[1:13:14] old okay we got
[1:13:17] one that direction all right and there
[1:13:19] who's over 70 let me see your hands over
[1:13:22] 70 how old are you brother Rick 76 76
[1:13:26] Moses was four years older than you and
[1:13:28] he still hadn't even got started
[1:13:31] yet how old are you brother
[1:13:34] Chuck 6 12 years older than you brother
[1:13:37] Chuck and he hadn't even got started yet

[1:13:44] Chuck he hadn't even got started yet now
[1:13:47] you say where they lived a lot longer
[1:13:49] well Moses lived 120 years I did the
[1:13:51] math on it this morning that means he
[1:13:53] would have been a roughly 50 4 years old
[1:13:55] in our
[1:13:57] time and he hadn't even started yet his
[1:13:59] whole life had been a
[1:14:00] failure and he hadn't even got started
[1:14:02] yet come on is that right Saints is that
[1:14:05] the Bible hadn't even got started yet
[1:14:08] brother brand said this what is that in
[1:14:10] your hand he said
[1:14:11] Moses had been a total
[1:14:16] failure God come on somebody and there

[1:16:20] come on
[1:16:21] somebody
[1:16:23] Gooding see your failures in your past
[1:16:27] don't dictate your future amen the
[1:16:30] things youve done wrong don't have to be
[1:16:32] the things you continue to do
[1:16:34] wrong you can start today Moses had been
[1:16:37] a total failure up to this point but he
[1:16:39] was just getting
[1:16:41] started and brother Brown says this no
[1:16:45] matter what it is maybe you've been a
[1:16:47] failure as a
[1:16:49] Christian maybe you failed to go on with
[1:16:51] God He said if it has been take note to
[1:16:54] what I'm going to say in just a few
[1:16:56] moments about this Moses failed down in
[1:16:58] Egypt and when he was born to be a
[1:17:00] deliverer to bring the children up out
[1:17:02] of Egypt why because he did it himself
[1:17:05] sa anytime we try to do it oursel we
[1:17:08] will fail anytime we try to get rid of a
[1:17:11] problem ourself anytime we try to clean
[1:17:13] oursel up we'll fail anytime we try to
[1:17:17] get good enough to come to church will
[1:17:20] fail come to church and he'll get you
[1:17:23] good enough amen
[1:17:25] right amen give it to him and he'll take
[1:17:28] care of it but when we try to do it
[1:17:30] oursel just like Moses will
[1:17:35] fail Saints if you got problems in your
[1:17:37] life and you got things about you that's
[1:17:39] not pleasing there's can you change
[1:17:42] them so why do we try when it's him
[1:17:46] that's got to do the changing I can
[1:17:48] struggle with something and struggle
[1:17:49] with it and struggle with it or as
[1:17:51] brother Brown said I can just turn
[1:17:53] around and walk away from it and resist
[1:17:55] the
[1:17:56] devil and he'll flee from
[1:17:59] it
[1:18:03] amen but we're the ones we
[1:18:05] find getting in God's way brother Bram
[1:18:09] said it's hard for me to believe but
[1:18:11] brother Bram said he was the greatest
[1:18:14] problem that the Lord Jesus had in his
[1:18:17] life we're the greatest problem the
[1:18:19] Lord's got trying to meddle with
[1:18:21] everything that he's trying to do trying
[1:18:23] to interrupt his plan and our life is
[1:18:26] that right Saints amen we're messing up
[1:18:29] God's plan we got to learn to let go and
[1:18:32] let God have it let go and let him take
[1:18:34] care of it let go and let him handle the
[1:18:37] situation yes sir because when we get
[1:18:40] involved we mess it
[1:18:42] up amen the you know I preached on it
[1:18:44] Saturday Sunday night David said this is
[1:18:47] not my battle the battle is the Lord's
[1:18:50] this Goliath this giant that I'm
[1:18:52] fighting it's not my giant to fight it's
[1:18:54] the Lord the battle is the
[1:18:57] Lord's now Lord is going to use me the
[1:19:00] Lord's going to use you but the battle
[1:19:02] is
[1:19:02] his amen and he don't lose battle
[1:19:05] Saints amen Moses was a total failure
[1:19:09] but all of a sudden he saw a pillar of
[1:19:12] fire and he saw God speak directly to
[1:19:14] him and God told him I'm going to do
[1:19:17] this yeah God tells him exactly the way
[1:19:20] he's going to do
[1:19:22] it but notice immediately after this as
[1:19:26] soon as God explains it all to him and
[1:19:29] tells him how it's all going to be done
[1:19:31] immediately Moses starts questioning
[1:19:33] himself and his human
[1:19:36] ability and he says well I Lord I don't
[1:19:39] even know your name he said I am the I
[1:19:42] am he said they won't believe me they
[1:19:45] won't listen to me they won't believe
[1:19:47] that you appeared to me I'm not as care
[1:19:49] I can't even talk right I can't thank
[1:19:52] God you don't have to talk right Saints
[1:19:56] There's Hope for me
[1:19:58] yet I'm the king of the double
[1:20:02] negative if you had to talk right I
[1:20:04] wouldn't be able to make it is that
[1:20:06] right Saints I you oh I'm not as
[1:20:08] charismatic as the other preachers I I
[1:20:11] don't know as much as the other
[1:20:12] preachers I I can't sing as good as the
[1:20:14] other singers I'm not as gifted as the
[1:20:17] other musicians come on somebody we
[1:20:19] start questioning and doubting our
[1:20:21] personal
[1:20:22] ability but the battle's not not mine
[1:20:25] it's the
[1:20:29] Lord's see that was just his past
[1:20:32] mistakes and failures that was doing the
[1:20:34] talking then and see we got things that
[1:20:37] we've done wrong and we've made mistakes
[1:20:40] and we've made we we've come up short
[1:20:43] and when the Lord calls us to do
[1:20:44] something all of those things the
[1:20:46] devil's there to remind us of everywhere
[1:20:47] we fail
[1:20:50] right and so this was
[1:20:53] Moses's m Stakes doing the talking lord
[1:20:56] I can't do it I'm not smart enough I
[1:20:57] can't speak good
[1:20:58] enough and he goes on see we we find
[1:21:01] that as you go through life scars build
[1:21:03] up as you go through battles you get
[1:21:05] scarred as you tested you get scarred
[1:21:08] and sometimes these scars can turn into
[1:21:10] complex and then we start fighting the
[1:21:12] greatest battle ever fought right up
[1:21:14] here in the old
[1:21:16] Noggin and as long as we're fighting a
[1:21:19] battle in our mind the devil don't have
[1:21:21] nothing to
[1:21:23] do
[1:21:25] and the Lord said to him in Exodus the
[1:21:27] 4th chapter 11th verse the Lord said
[1:21:30] unto him you're you're whining about
[1:21:33] your mouth that you can't speak good but
[1:21:36] who made that
[1:21:38] mouth that's
[1:21:41] right the Lord said look north south
[1:21:44] east and west and who made everything
[1:21:46] you're
[1:21:47] seeing am I not the Lord am I not the
[1:21:51] almighty has there ever been a time
[1:21:54] sister that I've been less than Almighty
[1:21:56] that's right that's right has there ever
[1:21:59] been a time that I hadn't been God and
[1:22:03] you're whining to me about your mouth
[1:22:05] that you can't talk good come on
[1:22:08] somebody and the Lord said unto him who
[1:22:10] made man's mouth who maketh the dumb the
[1:22:13] deaf or the sin or the blind have not
[1:22:15] eye the Lord now therefore go and I'll
[1:22:17] be with your mouth and teach thee what
[1:22:20] Thou shalt say so the Lord said I'm
[1:22:23] going to do it you go but I'm going to
[1:22:26] do
[1:22:29] it the Lord said who's running all this
[1:22:32] who's in control here who made man's
[1:22:36] mouth who's the one that that fashion
[1:22:38] that ground you're standing on who's the
[1:22:40] one that knew you before the foundation
[1:22:42] of the world who's the one that
[1:22:44] predestinated you to this and if I
[1:22:46] predestinate you to this am I not able
[1:22:48] to do what I predestinated you to amen
[1:22:51] GL amen who made man's mouth
[1:22:55] amen can I can the Lord handle your
[1:22:58] problems today Saints is he big enough
[1:23:01] to handle your trials and your tests and
[1:23:04] the things going wrong in your
[1:23:08] life there's never a time when he's not
[1:23:15] Almighty and this is where Moses said
[1:23:19] something he shouldn't
[1:23:20] say the Lord had allowed him to do all
[1:23:24] this whining and complaining and the
[1:23:26] Lord didn't say too
[1:23:28] much but then Moses said Lord just send
[1:23:32] somebody
[1:23:35] else and that was a wrong thing to say
[1:23:39] because the Bible said that the anger of
[1:23:40] the Lord was kindled against
[1:23:43] Moses see whatever plan the Lord has for
[1:23:47] you you're the ones got to do
[1:23:50] it nobody can take your place brother
[1:23:53] Trevor no nobody can do what God's
[1:23:55] called you to do whatever God has
[1:23:58] fashioned now you say well I don't know
[1:24:00] brother it's a free moral agency don't
[1:24:01] you think God knows the end from the
[1:24:03] beginning don't you think his for
[1:24:06] knowledge shows him what all is going to
[1:24:08] take place all the way to the end of
[1:24:10] time all the way to the end of Eternity
[1:24:12] don't you think God
[1:24:16] knows and if he knew don't you think
[1:24:19] he's in
[1:24:23] control
[1:24:26] see whatever God has for us to do nobody
[1:24:28] else can do it nobody can take your
[1:24:30] place nobody can do what you do you say
[1:24:32] brother George I just come to church and
[1:24:34] say amen that's all I do nobody can say
[1:24:36] Amen like you do that's right oh I'm
[1:24:40] just I'm just I'm just here I don't
[1:24:42] think I God maybe not yet maybe maybe
[1:24:45] you hadn't got 80 years old
[1:24:48] yet but God's got something for you to
[1:24:52] do oh I made all kind of mistakes that
[1:24:55] he's done with me no no no no Moses had
[1:24:57] made all kind of
[1:24:58] mistakes but Moses was just getting
[1:25:02] started is that
[1:25:05] right nobody can do what you do nobody
[1:25:07] can take your place it's critical you're
[1:25:10] a part of the plan of God right see God
[1:25:14] equips his people perfectly for the job
[1:25:17] that he has for them to do he made you
[1:25:21] to accomplish that what he set aside for
[1:25:24] you to
[1:25:25] accomplish see nobody could free Moses
[1:25:28] uh Egypt but
[1:25:32] Moses there was one man on the earth
[1:25:37] that could free Egypt and that was
[1:25:40] Moses now Moses failed Moses messed up
[1:25:44] Moses come up short and Moses spent 40
[1:25:47] years roaming around watching sheep on
[1:25:48] the back side of the desert but he was
[1:25:51] still the only one that could free
[1:25:53] Egypt
[1:25:55] what about you and me today
[1:25:57] Saints whatever it is whatever the plan
[1:26:00] is you're the only one that can do
[1:26:03] it Lord see there was one man that would
[1:26:07] call a bride out of a church in this
[1:26:10] day and he's the only one can do
[1:26:15] it now you say oh well it's in a bride
[1:26:18] now brother George he's still the only
[1:26:19] man that can do it Saints right that's
[1:26:22] right it's the words of this message
[1:26:24] that calls a bride out of a
[1:26:27] church now I might can tell you what he
[1:26:29] said but it's not my job to call a bride
[1:26:32] out of a church he already did
[1:26:35] it is that right say come on somebody
[1:26:38] now brother Brown says in personal
[1:26:39] experience with God he says we think of
[1:26:41] Moses when Moses in a burning bush this
[1:26:44] sheep herder one morning walking along
[1:26:46] the old path where he' walked many times
[1:26:48] and there he was attracted to a burning
[1:26:50] bush come to find out the angel of the
[1:26:52] Lord was in the bush now he speaks to
[1:26:56] Moses and Moses had been a bitter
[1:27:00] failure see that's what brother Ram said
[1:27:03] about a Vindicated prophet of God he'd
[1:27:05] been a bitter
[1:27:06] failure what about you and me
[1:27:09] Saints and he says and yet knowing that
[1:27:12] God was going to deliver the children of
[1:27:14] Israel by him so you can know God's
[1:27:17] called you to
[1:27:19] something but you still hadn't quite
[1:27:21] figured out how he's going to do it
[1:27:23] yet yet trying to do it within himself
[1:27:25] 40 years before that he became a failure
[1:27:28] and this is a part that struck me he
[1:27:30] says and he lost all the vision of
[1:27:34] Victory come on somebody lost the vision
[1:27:38] of Victory all the church has been dry
[1:27:41] for a little bit oh we've been
[1:27:42] struggling for a long time it ain't
[1:27:44] never going to get no better see all
[1:27:46] these battles all these failures
[1:27:47] sometimes we lose the vision of
[1:27:51] Victory and he said he said uh and the
[1:27:55] free and of the freedom for the people
[1:27:57] enslaved see Moses's personal failures
[1:28:00] had caused him to lose the feeling for
[1:28:03] people that are in
[1:28:05] bondage and see Sint sometimes when
[1:28:07] you're going through the battles and
[1:28:08] you're going through the trials and
[1:28:10] you're going through the test and you're
[1:28:11] in the heart of the battle it makes you
[1:28:13] lose sight of the fact we're here to
[1:28:16] help somebody come to
[1:28:17] Christ that's right all that we can do
[1:28:20] in our lives don't mean nothing if we
[1:28:21] can't bring somebody else with us right
[1:28:27] Lord he says and I just wonder sometimes
[1:28:30] if we the church knowing that God
[1:28:31] promised to deliver the church from its
[1:28:33] sins and from its sickness and to make
[1:28:35] us a people of salty people that the
[1:28:38] Earth will hunger and thirst after I
[1:28:40] wonder if our human efforts and our
[1:28:42] theologies and so forth and our great
[1:28:45] fine buildings and so forth that we as
[1:28:47] we triy to present to the people many
[1:28:49] years ago we found out that it failed
[1:28:51] because we took it upon ourselves to do
[1:28:53] it saints Saints all these programs and
[1:28:56] stuff that the church has got today we
[1:28:58] can't keep up with
[1:29:00] that Shalom Tabernacle we we'll never
[1:29:03] have as many youth programs and youth
[1:29:06] activities and we'll never have the kind
[1:29:08] of facilities that the Baptist Church
[1:29:10] down the street Scott yes sir but it
[1:29:13] ain't doing them no good no
[1:29:17] way that's right see we're in the
[1:29:19] business of see lives
[1:29:22] changed amen those things don't change
[1:29:25] your
[1:29:26] life programs Don't Change Your Life The
[1:29:29] Gospel changes your life the Holy Ghost
[1:29:31] changes your
[1:29:36] life if we start focusing on all these
[1:29:39] programs and everything everybody else
[1:29:41] is doing says we can't keep up with
[1:29:44] that but we're not called to keep up
[1:29:47] with
[1:29:50] that you don't have to have a a youth
[1:29:52] program to have solid
[1:29:55] youth you got to have the Holy Ghost in
[1:29:57] the
[1:30:00] youth oh come on
[1:30:03] [Music]
[1:30:04] somebody he says the Earth will hunger
[1:30:06] and thirst after I wonder if our human
[1:30:07] efforts in theologies he
[1:30:11] says he says we took it upon ourselves
[1:30:14] to have new schools to educate our
[1:30:16] ministers and so forth and we left off
[1:30:18] the real principle the real thing that
[1:30:21] God told us to receive was let the Holy
[1:30:24] Spirit lead the
[1:30:28] church he says we left off of that we've
[1:30:31] lost our divine Joy he said the vision
[1:30:33] is dull now people are not looking for
[1:30:36] the coming of the Lord and yet atomic
[1:30:39] bombs is hanging in hangers everywhere
[1:30:42] and these things will destroy the world
[1:30:43] at once but people has lost their vision
[1:30:46] of the
[1:30:47] Lord because we've set times that the
[1:30:49] Lord would come in a certain time and
[1:30:51] and we've done all these things and
[1:30:53] Saints I'll tell you we've times in the
[1:30:54] message I can't tell you how many times
[1:30:56] I've heard people preaching on the
[1:30:58] coming of the Lord is going to be in it
[1:31:00] was going to be in 2000 y 2K brother
[1:31:04] Chuck then it was going to be in 2013
[1:31:07] when the Mayan calendar
[1:31:10] ended but I'll tell you Saints it's
[1:31:12] liable to be in the
[1:31:14] morning amen but I don't know if it's
[1:31:17] not in the morning I'm going to be
[1:31:18] looking forward to next morning but we
[1:31:19] got to go ahead planting our
[1:31:22] potatoes amen
[1:31:30] amen but we can't lose our vision that
[1:31:33] the end is coming the Rapture is coming
[1:31:36] amen the church is going up
[1:31:39] soon and if we lose the vision of that
[1:31:41] and we lose the vision of of God
[1:31:43] delivering his people and we lose the
[1:31:45] vision of the Holy Ghost in the church
[1:31:47] and we lose all of that what have we
[1:31:48] gain
[1:31:50] Saints see he he said it has to happen
[1:31:53] we know that the Lord is coming but do
[1:31:55] our lives prove evidence that we believe
[1:32:00] that see if we truly believe that the
[1:32:03] Lord was coming in the morning what
[1:32:04] would it look like tonight before we
[1:32:06] went to
[1:32:08] bed if you knew the Lord was coming in
[1:32:10] the morning what would you read your
[1:32:12] Bible tonight before you went to bed
[1:32:13] would you pray tonight before you went
[1:32:15] to bed what would you do would you be
[1:32:17] trying to
[1:32:18] prepare see there's got to be evidence
[1:32:21] when you go to the court of law there's
[1:32:22] got to be evidence against against you
[1:32:24] to convict you of something now when we
[1:32:27] look out in the world today we see
[1:32:29] plenty of evidence that we are at the
[1:32:31] end time when you look out on the street
[1:32:34] and you see what's going on in the world
[1:32:36] there's all kind of evidence that the
[1:32:38] end is near that the cup of the amorites
[1:32:40] is almost full there's plenty of
[1:32:42] evidence to support that the coming of
[1:32:44] the Lord could be in the
[1:32:48] morning do we have the same amount of
[1:32:50] evidence could we be convicted of being
[1:32:53] a message believer today is there if we
[1:32:56] talk to my the people I work with is
[1:32:58] there evidence to convict me of being a
[1:33:00] message
[1:33:01] believer if you talk to my family if you
[1:33:03] talk to my children is there evidence to
[1:33:05] convict me of being a message
[1:33:09] believer would anybody
[1:33:12] know if you listen to me talk outside of
[1:33:15] church would there be evidence to
[1:33:17] convict me of being a message believer
[1:33:19] these are just things to think about
[1:33:21] Saints because there's all kind of
[1:33:23] evidence
[1:33:24] that it's going home
[1:33:26] time
[1:33:28] amen
[1:33:32] now we find people in this
[1:33:36] day we live in a fast food
[1:33:39] Society we want everything
[1:33:41] convenient we want everything easy we
[1:33:44] like everything at our
[1:33:46] fingertips we don't even have to go to
[1:33:48] the grocery store anymore if if
[1:33:50] instacart has got the free in delivery
[1:33:55] deal yes sir we just order the groceries
[1:33:59] and they show up at the front
[1:34:01] door you you don't have to and since I'm
[1:34:04] guilty of it too I'm not going to fight
[1:34:06] Walmart as long as I got Amazon on my
[1:34:09] phone am I don't need that aggravation
[1:34:13] in my
[1:34:16] life there's not a time I go to Walmart
[1:34:18] I don't lose my
[1:34:22] temper
[1:34:24] but we live in that kind of society
[1:34:25] where we want convenience and we want
[1:34:28] easy and we and we want everything
[1:34:30] handed to us we live in a society that
[1:34:33] way and we take so much for granted you
[1:34:37] know the fact that you can go to your
[1:34:38] refrigerator and open the door and
[1:34:39] there's food in it that we take that for
[1:34:41] granted the fact that we got a bed to
[1:34:43] lay down and sleep in at night we take
[1:34:45] that for granted because everybody
[1:34:47] doesn't have that but that's the world
[1:34:50] that we live in here the the the poorest
[1:34:52] of us is Rich compared to the rest of
[1:34:54] the
[1:34:55] world and that's the world that we live
[1:34:57] in and we're used to convenience and
[1:34:59] we're used to fast and we're used to
[1:35:03] easy and we and we we want to see that
[1:35:05] bleed over in the church sometimes Well
[1:35:07] church ain't
[1:35:10] easy coming together with a group of
[1:35:12] people trying to accomplish a a common
[1:35:14] goal that ain't
[1:35:17] easy getting everybody to sing in the
[1:35:20] same tune that ain't
[1:35:21] easy getting everybody to on the same
[1:35:24] beat that ain't
[1:35:27] easy getting everybody to agree on
[1:35:29] something that ain't easy Church ain't
[1:35:32] easy Saints it's not meant to be easy
[1:35:36] it's not supposed to be easy but in a
[1:35:39] day and time like this it's got to be a
[1:35:42] primary source of our life it it can't
[1:35:44] be it can't be unless there's a ball
[1:35:46] game on it we want to watch or unless
[1:35:48] there's a TV program we want to see it
[1:35:50] can't be unless there's something else
[1:35:51] better going on
[1:35:54] yes sir everything's got to take a
[1:35:56] backseat to
[1:36:00] this now why is it this way well because
[1:36:03] it's a lay of the sin Church
[1:36:06] age Revelations 3:15 says I Know Thy
[1:36:08] works so neither cold or hot and I would
[1:36:10] that thou were cold or hot so then
[1:36:12] because Thou Art lukewarm neither cold
[1:36:14] nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth
[1:36:17] because thou sayest I'm rich and
[1:36:19] increase with goods and have need of
[1:36:22] nothing now you you always see this even
[1:36:25] in Believers to where they just kind of
[1:36:27] float along and they coast along until
[1:36:30] tragedy strikes until something goes
[1:36:33] really wrong and then you'll see them
[1:36:36] they you see them want to consecrate
[1:36:38] their
[1:36:39] life
[1:36:41] amen it takes those trials sometimes to
[1:36:43] get us where we need to
[1:36:45] be
[1:36:48] amen
[1:36:50] now what's a cure for this Leo to see
[1:36:53] and Spirit keep in mind we're not in
[1:36:55] leot deia
[1:36:58] Saints this is the bride age for you and
[1:37:00] me it's a dual
[1:37:02] dispensation but we're running above
[1:37:06] leoda and Moses had been a bitter
[1:37:08] failure brother Bram said and but out
[1:37:11] there now we see his attention attracted
[1:37:13] to a burning bush and he looks to the
[1:37:16] burning bush to find out what the
[1:37:18] trouble was I love that Moses looked to
[1:37:20] the burning bush to find out what the
[1:37:22] trouble was
[1:37:26] and see we got that same Pillar of Fire
[1:37:28] that was in that bush that came to this
[1:37:30] church and gave this church age the same
[1:37:32] kind of
[1:37:34] message and we got to look to that
[1:37:36] message to find out what the trouble
[1:37:39] is and we're walking close he says fire
[1:37:42] usually brings an attraction usually the
[1:37:44] Holy Spirit when it comes in a manner of
[1:37:46] fire attracts the attention to people
[1:37:48] and when Moses turned aside to consider
[1:37:50] the Burning Tree that would not burn up
[1:37:52] God spoke to him by a fresh Vision By An
[1:37:54] Angel I'll tell you Saints we had the
[1:37:56] same kind of vision spoken to us by an
[1:37:59] Angel Today that's
[1:38:03] right he said now watch Faith take a
[1:38:05] hold right quick the old things are
[1:38:07] passed away but Moses now has a new
[1:38:10] vision see Saints you can be converted
[1:38:13] and you can be justified and you can be
[1:38:16] Sanctified and you can even receive the
[1:38:18] Holy Ghost and get stagnant and get
[1:38:20] stale and we need a fresh vision
[1:38:24] amen he said he has a revelation we need
[1:38:28] a
[1:38:29] revelation we need a revelation that
[1:38:32] tomorrow could be the last day we're on
[1:38:34] this Earth we need a revelation that
[1:38:36] there's somebody out there that needs
[1:38:38] what we
[1:38:41] got we need a revelation that this is
[1:38:44] important that coming here and Gathering
[1:38:48] here and fellowshipping with Believers
[1:38:50] and hearing the gospel preached is
[1:38:52] important
[1:38:55] we need a fresh revelation of
[1:38:59] that and he has an
[1:39:02] experience he had met God is that what
[1:39:05] you want Saints an experience that
[1:39:07] you've met God an experience that he
[1:39:11] gave you a revelation an experience that
[1:39:14] you got a new
[1:39:17] vision and he talked to God before that
[1:39:22] he had not met God he'd only read and
[1:39:24] knowed what his mother told him say you
[1:39:27] can't be a grandchild you can't come
[1:39:30] here because Mama comes here you can't
[1:39:32] come here cuz Daddy comes
[1:39:34] here you got to come here cuz you got an
[1:39:40] experience that's what the church needs
[1:39:42] tonight he says is just stop studying so
[1:39:44] much
[1:39:46] Theology and get down to the
[1:39:49] Altar and pray until a personal
[1:39:52] experience burns down in the human heart
[1:39:55] and burns out all the dullness and gives
[1:39:58] a new vision is that what you want today
[1:40:00] Saints let me just say this the devil's
[1:40:03] been trying for years to get you and
[1:40:06] he's been trying for years to to to make
[1:40:09] you doubt he's trying for years to to
[1:40:11] stop you from accomplishing what God
[1:40:14] wants you to do he's he's tried for
[1:40:16] years to make you doubt your calling to
[1:40:17] make you doubt your election but you're
[1:40:19] still
[1:40:22] here he ain't stopped you yet you're
[1:40:25] still here this morning you're still
[1:40:28] serving the lord today you might have
[1:40:30] made some mistakes but you're still here
[1:40:32] you might have done some things wrong
[1:40:34] but you're still here he hadn't stopped
[1:40:36] you from coming
[1:40:39] yet Lord see Moses had feelings of
[1:40:43] insecurity but God's always faithful to
[1:40:46] his Saints he's always faithful he's
[1:40:49] he's never how many times Saints have we
[1:40:51] almost been killed in an accident but
[1:40:53] almost don't count does
[1:40:56] it how many times have we almost got
[1:40:59] oursel into a mess but almost don't
[1:41:02] count Saints God is faithful to us am
[1:41:06] amen how many times has he kept us out
[1:41:09] of something and we and maybe we wanted
[1:41:11] to be in it but he kept us out of it and
[1:41:13] it was a reason for it how many times
[1:41:17] has he put us in contact with the right
[1:41:19] person at the right time how many times
[1:41:21] have you needed something and you come
[1:41:23] to church and the message that we heard
[1:41:25] was exactly what you needed how many
[1:41:27] times have you read your Bible and it
[1:41:29] was exactly the word that you needed how
[1:41:31] many times he's always been
[1:41:34] faithful always been faithful to us he's
[1:41:38] never left us he's never forsaken us oh
[1:41:40] we make mistakes we come up short but he
[1:41:43] never makes his mistake he never comes
[1:41:46] up
[1:41:51] short and these feelings of insecurity
[1:41:53] it's the devil's plan to try to make us
[1:41:55] feel insecure and and to try to make us
[1:41:58] think we're not good enough to be part
[1:42:00] of God's program to make us think we've
[1:42:03] gone too far that God can't use us no
[1:42:07] more but none of that
[1:42:11] matters because God's not looking at you
[1:42:14] he's looking at
[1:42:17] Christ thank you Lord and God accepted
[1:42:22] Christ and Christ accepted
[1:42:27] you there's a quote where brother
[1:42:29] brandom says that when you pray God
[1:42:33] don't see you he sees
[1:42:35] Christ but he hears your
[1:42:38] voice so he's hearing your voice when
[1:42:40] you pray but he's saying the
[1:42:45] blood that's how we can come boldly to
[1:42:47] the throne of
[1:42:51] grace amen amen but insecurity like
[1:42:55] Moses was dealing with it can cause us
[1:42:57] to look at what other people's doing it
[1:43:00] can cause us to look around at what
[1:43:01] everybody else has got going on it can
[1:43:04] even caus us to look at other message
[1:43:05] Believers sa you you can't look at what
[1:43:07] other message believers do to justify
[1:43:10] what you
[1:43:11] do well that brother goes to this game
[1:43:14] it must be all right that brother does
[1:43:15] this he's got this hobby it must be all
[1:43:17] right that sister does this it must be
[1:43:19] all right well brother so and so lets
[1:43:21] his family watch this it must be all
[1:43:22] right
[1:43:24] right remember brother BR said we all
[1:43:27] had to be led by the Holy Spirit right
[1:43:30] that's right and just I don't care what
[1:43:32] the message kids is doing it don't make
[1:43:34] it all right for
[1:43:39] you all
[1:43:43] right there's a tremendous pressure on
[1:43:46] you and I to be
[1:43:48] right brother Brown said it people
[1:43:50] preach it like we give our heart to the
[1:43:52] Lord and it's going to be a FY bet of
[1:43:54] ease but he said it's right the opposite
[1:43:58] when he said when you give your heart to
[1:44:00] the Lord it adds pressure because you're
[1:44:03] constantly wondering am I doing
[1:44:05] something to be pleasing to the Lord is
[1:44:07] this pleasing to him am I in his perfect
[1:44:09] will and being a Christian adds pressure
[1:44:13] yes
[1:44:15] amen and so if we have insecurity and
[1:44:17] we're looking what everybody else to
[1:44:19] does to validate what we do see nobody
[1:44:22] else can make your calling and your
[1:44:24] election sure but
[1:44:26] you see oh God this herd mentality that
[1:44:30] people get and that's to look around and
[1:44:32] see what the crowd is doing and go
[1:44:35] follow
[1:44:37] that that'll always get you in
[1:44:40] trouble see it was a her mentality that
[1:44:44] crucified Jesus it was it was a bunch of
[1:44:47] people all tore up about something and
[1:44:49] they were all yelling out in the crowd
[1:44:51] crucifying CR crucify
[1:44:55] him I guarantee you there were people
[1:44:57] there that really didn't know what was
[1:44:58] going on but when you look around and
[1:45:01] everybody's yelling crucify him you say
[1:45:03] well that must be right and they yelling
[1:45:04] crucify him and today they got the blood
[1:45:07] of Christ on their hands for following
[1:45:10] along along what's what the crowds doing
[1:45:13] the Bible said they stirred up the
[1:45:21] Jews
[1:45:25] it doesn't make one bit of difference
[1:45:26] what anybody else is doing we got to go
[1:45:29] as the Lord shows
[1:45:30] us it don't matter what any church in
[1:45:32] this town's doing we got to go as the
[1:45:35] Lord shows us it doesn't matter what
[1:45:37] anybody in your family is doing you got
[1:45:39] to go as the Lord shows
[1:45:41] you amen don't let the devil use that
[1:45:44] insecurity let God use that insecurity
[1:45:47] see brother brandham said in perfect
[1:45:49] strength by Perfect weakness he says we
[1:45:52] get these feelings we think that we're
[1:45:53] insufficient and we don't want to do it
[1:45:56] but then if we'll just listen to the
[1:45:57] call of God that's the very thing that
[1:45:59] God wants us to get into that kind of a
[1:46:03] shape where you feel like I can't do it
[1:46:06] I'm insecure I I don't think I can do it
[1:46:08] I he said just listen to the call and
[1:46:10] when you're insufficient ourselves then
[1:46:12] we're subject to yield to God's
[1:46:16] spirit see if we get insufficient we say
[1:46:18] Lord I can't do it then we got to say
[1:46:20] you do it for me Lord amen I can't
[1:46:24] handle the situation you handle it for
[1:46:26] me Lord I'm not smart enough to get
[1:46:28] myself out of this you handle it for me
[1:46:32] Lorden I don't know what to do here Lord
[1:46:34] I don't know what to do with my family
[1:46:36] you handle it for me Lord I don't know
[1:46:38] what to do to help them kids you handle
[1:46:40] it for me Lord Lord let me you tell me
[1:46:44] Lord I'm listening you tell me and I'll
[1:46:47] do
[1:46:50] it so when we get insufficient then God
[1:46:53] can use us brother brandham
[1:46:55] said he says but when we get to a place
[1:46:57] where we think we can't do it then we
[1:46:59] yield ourselves to God and he does it so
[1:47:02] then if it's us trying to do it we'll
[1:47:04] fail but if we'll just yield oursel to
[1:47:06] God then God can't fail and there's only
[1:47:09] one thing God cannot do and that's fail
[1:47:12] he cannot do anything else but fail he
[1:47:15] cannot fail so as long as we're trying
[1:47:17] ourselves and depending on our abilities
[1:47:20] that's right and so forth we'll do
[1:47:23] nothing but when we get to a place to
[1:47:24] where we know we're nothing then God can
[1:47:27] use
[1:47:29] us so when the devil tells you you don't
[1:47:32] have the ability you can say praise God
[1:47:34] I'm right where God can use
[1:47:38] me when it says you're not smart enough
[1:47:40] to figure it out you say praise God then
[1:47:43] he can use me God can figure it out for
[1:47:47] me y'all remember that shunamite woman
[1:47:51] she said all is
[1:47:53] well but all wasn't
[1:47:56] well but she said all is
[1:47:59] well but all wasn't well her child was
[1:48:02] laying in Elijah's bed stoned
[1:48:05] dead and she said all is
[1:48:09] well
[1:48:10] amen but all wasn't well cuz all was
[1:48:13] well all was well cuz God still
[1:48:17] God all wasn't well cuz all was well all
[1:48:20] was well cuz he's never been less than
[1:48:25] Almighty her Miracle didn't start that
[1:48:29] day her Miracle started a long time
[1:48:32] before that her Miracle started way back
[1:48:36] when that Prophet was coming by and she'
[1:48:38] say hey won't you come on in here let me
[1:48:40] fix you something to eat
[1:48:43] baby let me get you something to drink
[1:48:47] let me fix you a meal here let me take
[1:48:50] care of you here see you can't do
[1:48:51] anything for God he don't recog iiz
[1:48:55] it her Miracle started way back when she
[1:48:58] told her husband you know what would be
[1:48:59] nice if we just built a little lean to
[1:49:02] on the side of the house here and we put
[1:49:05] a little bed in there and a little wash
[1:49:07] basin in there and then when that
[1:49:09] Prophet comes by he can take a little
[1:49:11] rest he can have a little something to
[1:49:13] eat he can clean himself up and he can
[1:49:15] be
[1:49:18] refreshed see all wasn't well cuz all
[1:49:20] was well all was well cuz she knew who
[1:49:23] she
[1:49:24] served she knew the life she'd been
[1:49:26] living she knew what she'd done the
[1:49:29] Bible say she was a great woman ain't
[1:49:32] that what you want said about you so oh
[1:49:34] I'm a great that was that's a great man
[1:49:36] that's a great woman the Bible says she
[1:49:38] was a great
[1:49:39] woman and she taken care of Elijah she
[1:49:42] had taken care of the things of God all
[1:49:44] wasn't well cuz all was well all was
[1:49:47] well cuz she knew where she was standing
[1:49:49] she knew the message she believed and
[1:49:50] she knew whatever that Prophet said was
[1:49:52] going to come to pass just like he said
[1:49:54] it yes amen that's why all was well cuz
[1:49:59] she knew that was a Vindicated Prophet
[1:50:00] she was
[1:50:01] [Music]
[1:50:05] following amen glory see we can't let
[1:50:09] our mistakes and our faults and our
[1:50:11] failures take our minds off of the life
[1:50:14] of service that we're living amen you're
[1:50:17] living for the Lord today you're serving
[1:50:19] God as best of your abilities today and

[1:50:31] right who doesn't make
[1:50:33] mistakes you know what tomorrow I'm
[1:50:35] going to do probably make a
[1:50:40] mistake I'm probably going to fail some
[1:50:42] more I failed a lot but there's probably
[1:50:45] a lot more failures coming but it
[1:50:46] doesn't change the fact that I am
[1:50:48] serving a living
[1:50:50] God a God who who is rich in Mercy a God
[1:50:54] who has a blood shed that's covering

[1:51:14] don't let your faults affect your
[1:51:18] future don't let the things of your past
[1:51:20] affect what you do tomorrow
[1:51:23] amen we still got chance we still got
[1:51:26] breath we still got we still got life in
[1:51:28] US Saints and we can still do something
[1:51:30] for the
[1:51:32] Lord y'all love him this
[1:51:38] morning
[1:51:39] Martha in St John
[1:51:45] 11
[1:51:46] called for
[1:51:48] Jesus because her brother Lazareth was
[1:51:51] dying
[1:51:53] they called for the
[1:51:56] Lord and it looked like he got there too
[1:52:02] late see they called for him and the
[1:52:06] Lord stayed two more days wherever he
[1:52:08] was
[1:52:09] at and while he was St carried where he
[1:52:12] was at Lazarus passed
[1:52:14] away but she
[1:52:17] said even now Lord all is well
[1:52:23] even now why she knew it wasn't her job
[1:52:26] to raise
[1:52:28] Lazareth this battle is the
[1:52:31] Lords whenever Jesus gets there he's
[1:52:34] right on time he's never too late is
[1:52:38] that right Saints he's never too late in
[1:52:40] our situation it's never too far
[1:52:44] gone if you can get Jesus on the
[1:52:50] scene now I'll C you this
[1:52:54] David the Bible said encouraged himself
[1:52:57] in the Lord he come home to ziklag to
[1:52:59] find it burnt on fire his children taken
[1:53:03] his wives taken all of his stuff taken
[1:53:06] all of his men's families were taken and
[1:53:08] his men turned on him and spake of
[1:53:10] stoning
[1:53:12] him and the Bible said David encouraged
[1:53:15] himself in the Lord see sometimes Saints
[1:53:18] you're going to have to walk by yourself
[1:53:20] and you going have to encourage yourself
[1:53:22] cuz ain't no nobody
[1:53:25] coming it's not anybody else's job to
[1:53:28] encourage you it's not anybody else's
[1:53:31] responsibility and Moses had to realize
[1:53:34] that the calvary wasn't coming to save
[1:53:36] him it was on Moses to go deliver
[1:53:40] Egypt yes sir and when he met that
[1:53:43] Pillar of Fire and he got that fresh
[1:53:46] Revelation and he got that fresh vision
[1:53:48] and he got that fresh understanding when
[1:53:50] he left that mountain nothing was going
[1:53:52] to stop
[1:53:53] him see there ain't no backing up with
[1:53:56] God there's no reverse in this vehicle
[1:53:59] it's only yay and amen it's only speak
[1:54:03] and go forward we can't let our failures
[1:54:06] dictate our future no matter what's
[1:54:07] happened there's no backing up in God if
[1:54:10] they all turn on you just go forward if
[1:54:13] your family turns against you keep going
[1:54:15] forward if nobody else sees it but you
[1:54:18] keep going
[1:54:19] forward if they call you a Holy Roller
[1:54:22] just keep on going forward if they say
[1:54:24] you can't live this life today keep
[1:54:26] going forward if Mama says you lost your
[1:54:28] mind keep going
[1:54:33] forward if they won't let you come to
[1:54:35] their church just keep on going forward
[1:54:37] if the doctor says it's cancer you just
[1:54:39] keep on going
[1:54:41] forward if they say you'll never get
[1:54:43] well just keep on going
[1:54:46] forward they say oh it's depression you
[1:54:48] never get over just keep on going
[1:54:50] forward they say the anxiety is too
[1:54:52] intense keep going
[1:54:59] forward but this is an individual
[1:55:02] Affair nobody can walk it but you yes
[1:55:05] sir nobody could deliver e Egypt but
[1:55:07] Moses nobody could deliver the children
[1:55:09] of Israel but Moses nobody can do it but
[1:55:11] him and nobody can walk your walk but
[1:55:15] you nobody can nobody can give you a
[1:55:19] revelation nobody nobody can guide your
[1:55:22] footsteps but
[1:55:25] you Hallelujah nobody can receive this
[1:55:29] message for
[1:55:32] you now Sam ear in church age I've read
[1:55:35] this to you many times there's a reason
[1:55:36] for that because it's my favorite
[1:55:40] quote but he says in every single Hour
[1:55:43] Bar None it says the very same thing to
[1:55:46] the opening and closing message to each
[1:55:48] age unto the messenger of Ephesus samna
[1:55:52] pergamus thar Sardis Philadelphia leosia
[1:55:54] write these things saith he etc etc he
[1:55:59] let he that has an ear let him singular
[1:56:01] hear what the spirit says to the
[1:56:02] churches now notice here that Jesus by
[1:56:05] the spirit in every age addresses
[1:56:07] himself to only one
[1:56:10] person relative to the word for that
[1:56:14] age so
[1:56:16] Jesus by
[1:56:18] revelations you can read that in
[1:56:19] Revelations 3rd Chapter address
[1:56:23] himself to only one person in each age
[1:56:27] is that what the Bible says Saints well
[1:56:29] that person for our age was this man
[1:56:32] right
[1:56:37] here not a not a group of people not a
[1:56:40] bunch of Believers one man he addressed
[1:56:44] himself to one
[1:56:47] man is that what the Bible says Saints
[1:56:50] are we just reading that out of the
[1:56:51] Bible unto the angel of the Church of
[1:56:53] Lea unto the angel of the Church of
[1:56:55] samna Unto the angel of the Church of
[1:56:57] Ephesians is that right so he he
[1:57:00] addressed himself to Only One messenger
[1:57:02] for each age and only one messenger for
[1:57:05] each age receives what the spirit has to
[1:57:07] say to that age and that one messenger
[1:57:12] is the messenger to the true
[1:57:15] church he speaks for
[1:57:21] God by Revelation to the
[1:57:26] churches both true and false the message
[1:57:30] is then broadcast to all so if you got a
[1:57:33] problem listening to
[1:57:37] tapes it's then broadcast to all but
[1:57:41] though it's broadcast to all who come
[1:57:43] within range of the message that message
[1:57:46] is is received individually by only a
[1:57:50] certain qualified
[1:57:53] group in a certain
[1:57:57] way oh God aren't you glad to be part of
[1:58:00] a certain qualified group that has the
[1:58:03] ability to hear what the messenger
[1:58:07] saying in a certain way each individual
[1:58:11] of that group here it goes each
[1:58:13] individual so we are collectively a
[1:58:16] group and we are collectively a group
[1:58:18] receiving what the messenger says but
[1:58:21] each individual in this
[1:58:24] group is one who has the ability to hear
[1:58:28] what the spirit is saying by way of the
[1:58:31] messenger see one of you can listen to
[1:58:34] the message and say that was God
[1:58:37] speaking and the next person can listen
[1:58:39] to it and say well it wasn't it wasn't
[1:58:41] nothing to me why you've got the ability
[1:58:45] to hear what the messenger is
[1:58:48] saying those who here are not getting
[1:58:50] their own private revelation
[1:58:52] nor is a group getting their Collective
[1:58:56] Revelation but each person is hearing
[1:59:00] and receiving what the messenger has
[1:59:02] already received from
[1:59:05] God nobody can receive this for you you
[1:59:09] have to receive it for
[1:59:11] yourself oh we can broadcast the message
[1:59:14] to all I can preach the message to all
[1:59:18] but each one of us has to receive it as
[1:59:20] an individual
[1:59:24] yes see we can't be in the message cause
[1:59:27] Mama's in the message and we can't be in
[1:59:29] the message cuz our Daddy's in the
[1:59:31] message we got to be in the message cuz
[1:59:33] we're in the message and we got the
[1:59:36] message in
[1:59:37] us now that being said it sure is
[1:59:41] nice it sure is an
[1:59:44] encouragement when the Lord sends you
[1:59:47] somebody who sees what you
[1:59:50] see it sure does make make you feel
[1:59:53] better you might have been walking what
[1:59:55] you thought was alone but you're not
[1:59:58] alone and it sure is nice to when you
[2:00:01] run into a brother and talk to him a
[2:00:03] little while and he says the same things
[2:00:06] you
[2:00:07] think it sure is an
[2:00:10] encouragement it sure is nice to be
[2:00:13] struggling and then somebody send you
[2:00:15] the right
[2:00:17] quote or somebody sends you the right
[2:00:19] scripture or you get a call from
