violently blowing but he was asleep in the stern does he not care that we perish we're helpless and we are so afraid Jesus rose when they called him and said to them where is your faith because you

oh he knows your voice lift your hands and S to Rejoice child your chist have a woken the master [Music] child your Christ have awoken the [Music] [Applause] master praise the Lord I'm so glad those cries awoke him Amen Brother John if you want to go ahead and make ready for us this evening amen somebody say praise the Lord tonight amen I wanted to sing a song but before we did just say a little something about this song this song is a question who am I and just after the tape that we're listening to this morning I just don't want there to be anything that's a stumbling block to somebody as we are as we are singing this so just a couple things along those lines um so these are just a couple quotes one that uh brother brandom said there's not a person living but would like to look past over the C of times of where did I come from who am I where am I going of all the fine books that's been read the Great Master selections that's been made there's only one book that reveals who you are where you come from and where you're going that's it and then we heard this morning in the first seal and he says I hope the church truly understands it what I mean you people I'm I'm going to call you bride see so we're singing this song Who Am I it's like well weren't you listening this morning morning and um so then later that year this is from a the message is your life worthy of the Gospel after he preached the first seal he's talking about Jesus in his humility he says look at Jesus talk about us humbling ourselves when God himself became a baby instead of coming in a little crib somewhere in a decent home was born out there over a manure Pile in a stable amongst balling calves they wrapped him in swaddling clothes was off the neck of a yoke of an ox the poorest of the poorest and yet the creator of heavens and earth one cold rainy night they said Master we'll go home with you he said the foxes have holes the birds have nests but I don't even have a place to lay my head he says god Jehovah humbled himself and became a man represented in sinful flesh to redeem you and me who are we then he was our example who am I nothing so as we sing this tonight it's not that we don't know who we are but it's like Lord why me why did you do this for me Lord It's is Amazing Grace and that's what I just want to sing about tonight is that amazing grace that he's letting us know who we are where we're going and we're going to thank him the whole way Lord thank you for your Amazing Grace well when I think of how he came so far from [Music] Glory he came and dwelt among the lonely such as I to suffer shame and such disgrace and on Mount C R take my place and then I ask myself this question Lord who am I oh who am I that king would bleed and die for who am I that he would pray not my will thine Lord the answer I may never know just why he ever loved me so and to an Old Rugged Cross he would go for who am I and when I'm reminded of his words I'll leave you never if you'll be true I'll give to you life forever and ever I wonder what I could have done to deserve God's only son he'll fight my battles until they one for who am I who am I that a king would bleed and die for oh who am I that he would pray not my will thine Force the answer I I may never know just why ever love me so and to an Old Rugged Cross he would go yes to an Old Rugged Cross he would go yes to an Old Rugged Cross he'd go for who am [Music] I oh Lord who am I I don't think we'll ever understand until we're in his presence why he chose us amen as we make ready to change our service this evening just sing that more of you Lord more of [Music] you oh more of you more of [Music] you I've had it all but what I need is more of you of things I've had my f and yet I hunger still empty and be Lord hear my prayer more of you oh more of you oh is that your desire tonight let's stand and Worship the Lord I've had it all but what I need is more of you Hallelujah up think I've had my feel and H still empty and B Lord hear my [Music] prayer one more time more of you as brother Josh comes he'll Minister more I believe there's more of you Lord Jesus more of you I've had it all but what I need is more of [Music] you he my pray for more of you amen God bless you it's good to be back home I miss my family and my church family quite a bit being gone was out for a week in Tennessee seeing my mom and grandma out there and just glad to be back home this morning if we could turn over to Revelation 3: 20 thank you musicians re Revelation 3:20 says behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and I will s with him and he with me let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just ask that your presence would stay here with us father that you would continue with us throughout this service Lord the service this morning and then tonight these these songs of Zion that were sing the gifts that were orchestrated that you use father Lord we thank you so much for all of it father we just ask that just you would continue with us and be with us father and you would bless the service in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated so this scripture brother brandom he refers to this scripture in a few different ways through the tapes he calls it one of the saddest pictures in the entire Bible he also calls it a pitiful thing you think about th this picture right here is is up there with some of the it's up there with him hanging on the cross that picture it is one of the saddest pictures he says in the entire Bible said behold I stand and knock and I I have a hard time believe can you believe that we serve a God that no matter what we've done how far we went that he he will still stand and knock at our heart's door that he will still continue to be there for us Time After Time and I have a a story I'd like to tell you it kind of reminded me of it the other day I was playing with Nolan in the floor and I think there was a stack of pillows right there and he had rolled over and as he was rolling over he was about to fall and bust his head so I reached out and I put my hand there and I softened his blow you know I caught him I caught him in his time of trouble coming down and then next thing I know that big old fat foot comes around and kicks me right in the face right after I catch him so I thought that might be a a billion of how the Lord feels with us sometimes he's there to soften our blow he's there to catch us when we fall and the next thing you know we're right back at it we're right back doing the same exact thing sometimes I have a it's a very familiar quote here it's in Ador and Ador in 63 February 23rd it says now I can't think of the artist that painted this picture of Jesus knocking at the door he's some Greek artist I just can't think of the man's name at the time but he had spent practically a lifetime painting this picture and you see before it can be hung in the Hall of Fame it has to go through the Hall of critics first any great picture must do that it must face the critics he said oh I wish I had the the something that it takes to throw that before this audience this morning do you realize Pentecostal people as we cool off that God has taken us through the Hall of critics today he says the church has to go through the Hall of critics before it can go in the Hall of Fame as a bride sure can you stand it are you ready to come up with the scripture and stand Gallant to your testimony in the love of Christ he said are you taking back going out with the world like the Bible said Deus forsaken me loving this present World there is where the church is standing today waited in the balance that's the reason becomes Leo deia he said this picture as the artist painted it when it went to the hall of critics they could find nothing wrong and finally a great critic came up and he said there is one thing wrong with your picture he said it's true Jesus with the lantern in his hand coming by night in the darkness of sin that's a good picture he said his expression with the expectations of somebody to come to the door when he's knocking said that's wonderful and the look upon his face as he is longing to hear from the inside but sir there is no latch on the door if he did come how could Jesus get in because there's no latch on the door oh said the artist I painted it thus for the latch is on the inside he said Jesus cannot come in just by his will it's got to be your will to let him in he said lo I stand at the door and knock If any man will hear my voice and come in let me in I will come in and will Su with him and he with me brother brandham said that's the picture we're looking at now he said what does a man knock on a door for what makes a man knock at a door he is trying to gain entrance he's trying to come in there maybe there is something he wants to talk to you about or maybe he wants to speak to you about some business or something or maybe he wants to give you something there is some reason or he wouldn't be knocking at the door and that would my title tonight would be who's knocking at your door so brother Brandon there speaking about a man knocking at a door to gain entrance the first thing I thought of when I heard that on the tape I thought of one of those exterminator guys one of those bug guys that they come by and they knock on your door and they want to exterminate your house for you they want to go around and spray and so those guys they they come to you and they have a plan they unveil a plan to you and now their plan that they unveil to you it's it's usually a quarterly plan it's usually we'll come back this day then three months later we'll come back then three months later but for me that that's the physical house for the spiritual house for my spiritual house I need a every day every second every hour plan and that is what Christ offers us when he's knocking at the door that's his offer he's not offering to come back quarterly and help out he's offering to be there every second of Our Lives to help out amen and people call they call Jesus the great physician and he is the great physician but that's not the only occupation that he holds in our life Jesus is a great exterminator too he comes to rid your home of those pests that you have he's here to exterminate our spiritual houses but that's not all he is he's he's the Builder of that house he's the architect of that house he's the Exterminator you know he he's all of it to our spiritual home but some things about exterminators what they like to do is they like to walk that property first they like to get a good idea where they're at and what they're going to see so when they walk the property they're looking for different things in the yard they they want to know how stuff is getting in and why it's getting in a pretty if you have ants in your yard if you have ant mounds here here here in the front and backyard there's a pretty that's a pretty good indication there might be some ants in the house or they might be trying to get in the house house and he'll walk around and he'll see a crack in the side of your home here or maybe in this certain spot it's not sealed well and then the the main thing the the biggest thing for pest being in your home is a weak Foundation but all these things all they are is wear and tear on the house from different storms the house has been through from different things that's been thrown at this home over and over again and the the foundation of a home it's it's a crucial part of the home and it's crucial to keep it without cracks to keep it free of pests and most of the time what coincides with that weak or crack Foundation is a pest infestation I got a couple of quotes I'd like to read about the foundation he says in the stature of a perfect man he says notice you must be born again he says and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith that's right so you see on my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith it's impossible to please God he that cometh to God now he don't say he said he that cometh to God he don't say maybe they got to do this he that he that cometh to God uh this might be the right way to go he said he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him he doesn't leave any wiggle room right there they they must believe this and then again in the Statue of a perfect man he says so you you must have faith for a foundation he said all Christianity all you are all you'll ever be is based upon faith in the word that's the reason I believe the word see the stronger the foundation the stronger the home will stand the less pest that you will have in that home the less that you the less the exterminator will have to do the less work he'll have to do now you'll always know when the exterminators come too because when he starts spraying on the outside the things on the inside start shifting things start moving around you know you get Justified you get Sanctified things start moving around there's changes that start happening the inside starts moving around a little bit and then sometimes the Exterminator he's been before he's been to your home but you didn't follow his guidelines of how to keep your home pest free yeah he's been he sprayed but and he gave you guidelines on how to keep it pest free but sometimes we ignore those guidelines sometimes we look past them we don't think anything about you know in the I don't know if you do it here but where I grew up in Arkansas you know if we had some leftovers in the fridge and we don't want them no more we just walk out on the back porch and fling them in the yard that's a pretty good way to get some pests in your yard get some raccoons around there get get all kind of stuff in your backyard but what do you expect you're attracting them what you're doing is causing them to come into your yard and then they're going to figure out pretty soon that this this food that keep showing up right here it's coming from in that house and they're going to think well if I could just get in that house how much better off would I be amen but you're not ever going to fool him either the Exterminator he's a professional he walks in and if he sees bugs and different things that attracts the bugs he knows what he's looking at he's been there before he's experienced but him being experienced and him being there before that's good news for us because the biggest lie that the enemy will tell you is that you're alone in whatever you're going through he'll tell you this is never this has never been conquered before this has never been beaten before and you're not going to beat this that's what he'll love to tell you so the Exterminator experience that he's seen this before is actually a good thing because then you know this has been beaten before this has been conquered before it's it's the same old bug he's exterminated before and when Christ comes into our house and sees these things inside of us he looks at and he says that's no bit that's the same old sin that's the same old demon that I've exterminated before and it's not it only seems like a problem to us sometimes because those lies those little lies in our ears we start buying in but that's all they are is lies they're Bluffs then after struggling with these different pests one of the biggest mistakes that someone can make is not accepting the Exterminator help that's true saying come back again it's not a good time for me I've had a you know maybe come on a Friday afternoon that you don't want to deal with you've had a long work week and you're not you're not looking at dealing with that you're you want to go sit on the couch you want to relax but that's the biggest mistake you can make brother brandom always talked about it happens at an unexpected time maybe it's you comeing to church one night and you you've been on autopilot you're going to church you're going Wednesday night you're going Sunday morning Sunday night but you're really on autopilot just cruising along there and that's the unexpected time that it happens at just cuz you don't don't don't rely to always feel good and then get blessed you're probably going to feel bad and then get blessed is probably what's going to happen but the Exterminator he's got a business and a lot of the time he's more willing to accept your business than you are to give it he's more willing to accept it and it reminds me a story of that soldier that brother Brandon would talk about the one that I believe believe he had the one with the pardon I believe he had left the uh the Battlefront or he had left the battle and then they had thrown him in prison for that he was a guilty man and his friend had heard of it and I I like to focus on that mediator the friend right there in the middle to me in that story that's Christ for us his friend could not stand it that he was in prison that he was in these chains of bondage even though he was guilty he was completely guilty he had done he he had done the thing that got him there he he was completely guilty but his friend could not stand to see him there so what his friend does is goes and sees him and then he goes and finds Abraham Lincoln can you imagine a struggle that he went through to get to the president of the United States makes me think of the struggle that Christ went through carrying that cross up to Calvary hanging on that cross those Nails piercing his flesh all these things to think about all these things he went through just for us he had love in his heart thinking to me while doing that just for me just for you amen and it's the same with that mediator in the story he loved his friend he didn't want to see his friend die he loved him so he went and found the president and he got that pardon in his hand and can you imagine how happy he was going back to his friend with the pardon in his hand can you imagine how joyous it is to the Lord coming to us with the pardon in his hand and saying this is free you can have this what that must feel like for him how how happy he was through his love that he could die for us so that we could have that pardon but then you go a little bit further and the man got there and his friend wouldn't accept a pardon he wouldn't take it can you imagine how that made the man feel that went and got that that went and struggled that who knows what he went through there was a slap in the face to him he went spent all that time through love to get that pardon and then the man rejected it but let's say we did accept his health brother brandom it's a door to the heart in 58 he says but you might say to me brother brandom I've already did that when Jesus knocked at my heart I let him in he said well that's good but when he come into your heart did you welcome him to your entire being he said there's many people excuse me there's many people that will welcome Jesus in as Savior but can he be your lord and Lord is ownership now you think about this if you had cash and you just you just went to a dealer and you just bought a car outright just cash money you just laid it down that car is yours when you drive it all to lot when you own a car you don't just own the engine and the tires you own all of that car every bit of every inch of that car is yours that car now now you can paint it how you want to you can put different tires on it you can put different headlights in it that car is yours it belongs to you you have ownership of that car that car is subject to your will and that's how we have to be with Christ we have to be subject to his will it has to be ownership he goes on he says the Lord has complete control you would plenty welcome him to keep you out of hell and torment says you would welcome him as your savior but are you willing to welcome him as your lord to take over full control in the heart there is little doors like in your house if I come to your house to visit you and you welcome me in and said brother brandom I give to you this house and all that's within it but then you take me by the hand and say you see this door I don't want you going in there and you see this place now don't go in there and this place don't go in there then I'm just partially welcome says and that's the way people usually receive the Lord Jesus as partially welcome but he wants to come in and be welcome now let's examine some of these doors one of them is a little door self you know that's an important little door you say oh yes Jesus I'll receive you as my savior but now don't meddle in my business says that's the attitude of lots of Christians soall now now I want to live my own life but I don't want you I want you to keep me from hell he said but don't meddle in my Affairs well then Jesus can't have the preeminence and now when he said Affairs he didn't he didn't say sinful Affairs you know just because something isn't sinful in essence doesn't mean that we can't make it sinful to ourselves it's about priorities if Christ isn't the number one priority then whatever's above him it's that's an idol to us that's not correct he has to be the number one priority in our lives at all times these say no matter what the hobby it you think of maybe it's watching a watching a football game maybe it's going to a football game maybe it's going and doing something some hobby you have and now maybe you feel an unction to go get on your knees and pray or maybe to get in the scripture maybe listen to a tape getting the word but then you also feel that same function to go do that Hobby right and now when you choose that hobby you you say well maybe going and going and watching a game that's harmless but when you start choosing that harmless hobby over what the Lord's put on your heart to do it stops being so harmless at that point it starts causing more harm than it does good and then it snowballs and it continues and continues now the prophet said that's the attitude of lots of so-called Christians you know once we let him in in our house that doesn't mean it's over just yet you know those things that got kicked out they'll eventually want their home back can we turn to Matthew chapter 12 just real quick verses 43- 45 verse 43 says when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeking rest and findeth none then he saith I will return into my house from when I came out and when he has come he findeth it empty swept and garnished then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and they dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation brother brandham says if you don't have the good man of the house standing there which is your faith protecting that door they'll come right in after they've been kicked out I believe he says in demonology somewhere he says as Faith kills it unbelief resurrects it you know the enemy when you whether it's a filling or a refilling yeah the enemy had you whether it's either one of those he had you in something that's why you're seeking the Lord on these matters once he's gone and he ain't got you more in that spot he wants to get you back into that spot so he's going to push and push he's going to try and break that door down so he can get you back in that same exact thing you were in bondage over to begin with and that's when it takes some Faith that's when it takes the strong Foundation you've accepted the helper now let him help amen so now when he comes in and starts working don't follow him around and lock some doors as a quote said don't don't say no stay out of this room stay out of that room don't protect the stuff you want him to actually get rid of he can't do his job right an exterminator you think if you follow an exterminator around your house you say oh no sir I'm going to keep this shut I'm going to this closet over here I'm going to keep it shut that could be the room that the pest are getting in from that's how they're getting in your house in the first place and you just shut them out of that amen he can't do his job correctly he can't actually help you in that case some rooms haven't been cleaned in years I'm sure all of ours have been cleaned within the last few years but some some people's house some rooms ain't been cleaned in years but in that room it'll have the most dust and bugs and you know things you don't want to be around in it and in some rooms are very personal you know that sometimes I remember when I was real little my my parents they would would watch something it was called hoarders it was a TV show called hoarders and it was these people it was almost like a like a a drug addiction but it they would treat it like an intervention like their families would go to their house and they'd get these they'd call somebody and they'd be big camera crew show up and they would show these people's houses and there would be stuff stacked to the ceiling they had like a path like a a twot wide path you could get through their house and they had just a bunch of useless stuff a bunch of baggage they didn't need up to the ceiling and sometimes our spiritual houses can get like that we can become spiritual hoarders we can hold on to things too long that's right hold on to things we don't need when all you got to do is toss it out the door it's as simple as that those people coming in were wanting to help them and most of the time on that show they refuse to help most of the time when their their family they would get somebody they they would do it for for free that they would come and they would unpack that house for them for free clean it out and they would still reject the help they still would not accept what those people wanted to do for them it gets stacked up so tall sometimes it's almost impossible to move it gets heavier and heavier brother brandham says in the door to the heart he says here Pride keeps us from doing it he said we're afraid somebody will say something against us when the spirit blesses many are ashamed to say Amen there is many who in their office work the Lord Jesus could have healed them of diseases and they're afraid to testify to the glory of God because of Pride says many are afraid to stand and say I have received Christ as my personal Savior and have been filled with the Holy Spirit ashamed sometimes we don't want to mess with our status and now at this point I'm talking about maybe in the office maybe on the job you don't want to mess with that picture of how somebody has you in their head cuz if you start becoming a Christian you start telling about Divine Healing you start telling about some of these other things you might turn into a freak pretty quick it might happen real fast but what are you trying to give them you're trying to give them healing what if you talk to them about salvation you might turn into a freak but what are you trying you're trying to give them Christ you're trying to show them Christ amen and it I I don't care about what they see I care about what God sees when he's looking at me does he see a servant trying to go help someone else or someone that's too ashamed someone because of Pride might be too scared to help another Soul that's lost to reach out and try and pull them in amen and we think of back to the house we think of these different sizes of these different rooms you know pride is a master bedroom if we had to give it a room in a house Pride it's a master bedroom but not everybody's house is the same you know Pride to me might be a master bedroom but to you may be a closet these things are bigger in our lives they take up more room in our house but the houses aren't built the same as we said earlier they have they haven't all been through the same storms seen the same things so coming out that master bedroom would be a master bathroom has two rooms connected to one another that would be shame in Proverbs 11:2 it says when Pride cometh then cometh shame it says but with the lowly is wisdom you know pride and shame those are door stoppers those are rooms that we get locked into sometimes shame is a room you get locked into and you are it the devil will shame you so much about something you've done in your life or about something you cannot conquer till you are too scared to take a step spiritually until you can't move until you're Frozen spiritually and but as we know it Satan he he he perverts everything anything God does he perverts it shame is just a perverted form of conviction in Satan's hands said the Lord uses conviction he doesn't use shame in that way and the difference that Shame Shame says that you are the mistake conviction says you've made a mistake the Lord doesn't call you the mistake Satan calls you the mistake amen and that conviction will just say that you made a mistake God's conviction in our life it says you made a mistake shame will push you farther away from the Lord conviction push pushes you towards the Lord and the two they can feel really similar in your life when they're working they can feel very similar conviction and shame can brother brandom talks about faith you know he spoke of Faith as a foundation but he also speaks of Faith as a door he says in a door to the heart he said then there's another little door in the heart oh there's many of them but I just want to hit some of the main ones another little door in the heart when Jesus comes in is the Door of Faith oh many will say I'll accept him as my personal savior but I don't believe all the words inspired says then you're keeping your door closed he can't bless you at all and you say oh I believe that he saves me from sin but I just can't believe that the days of Miracles are the same today as they were then then you're keeping the door closed he can't do a thing for you it's like saying I'm a message believer but I don't know if all the message was inspired I don't know if it's all the truth and now the prophet says if that's the way it is he can't bless you at all that's right this healing we hear about on the tapes what the prophet tells us to be the truth he can't do a thing for you he says brother brandham says if that's how you're feeling you're keeping your door closed but it's it's by your actions it's by your fruits we can say all day that we believe this word that we believe what the tapes say that we believe what the scripture says but we have to live this word we have to live what we believe it's saying amen there's a saying that says talk is cheap you know you have to live it you can say all day I'm a Christian but if none of those fruits if none if if your life doesn't reflect that Christ has to reflect in our lives each one of us this word that we're saying that we believe we have to be a reflector of it how will others ever see it that's true how will anybody else we may be the only Bible some people see right in their whole life we are physical manifestations of of what Christ wants in this day we his hands and his feet we have to show people what this scripture is PE people have seen I've heard countless times people I've worked with they I ask them why are you not in church anymore because we'll get to talking and they'll tell me because of a bad experience they've had in church of something that happened to them something that one of the brothers said one of the sisters said what their Pastor did but they got to understand they were not living that they were they were not they were not trying to be what the word says they're supposed to be I've heard that so much from people that that's probably the number one I'll call it I don't I'll call it an excuse of why people will not attend church in the world yeah is because of that right there they've seen so much bad on the inside they're they're scared to go back and our faith it's not about how we feel either not at all it rests on the Promises of God not the lies of the enemy our faith does you know feelings feelings has gotten the church message churches churches out there in a lot of trouble there's Methodist churches that are letting homosexuals get up and Minister they're letting different things like that in behind their pull pit because it feels right but if those feelings don't dovetail don't don't directly line up with the word of God we have to toss those feelings out they're okay feelings are okay but they have to align with the word of God Amen and speak to the Rock brother brandham says oh that just as soon as you have your first trial come in the meeting see the Holy Spirit go back out and have a tummy ache and say well maybe I never got healed shame on you surely you got healed if you believe it your feeling ings has nothing to do with it it's your faith is what we look at that's what God sees is your faith not your feelings he said Jesus never did say did you feel it he said did you believe it that's the idea excuse me and just as soon as that exterminator leaves we sometimes think that we're seeing more bugs than we saw before yeah sometimes they start running around and we think what nothing even happened he didn't even fix anything I got the same old problem I still had before but that's because of how pesticides work and exterminator uses pesticides and what they do is they stir the bugs up they get the bugs moving so it can look like they are more bugs actually than before but in reality all those bugs are doing are coming near the pesticide and dying off is that right they're coming near and dying off that pesticide is attracting those bugs in to kill it or push them them out of your home another door I'd like to speak of is a door of fear and to me that would be the basement door the door of that basement that's a door of fear in each of our hearts that's the dark basement that's where you keep all them things that you don't want up in your house all them things maybe some just ugly stuff you don't want in your house and there's usually a lot of bugs in them creepy crawly bugs in the basements but all the kinds of pests that are usually crawling around in our spiritual basement there's worry there's anxiety there's depressions over things and they're all crawling around down there in the dark and any chance they get they want to bust up through that basement door and get into that house and they want to start moving around they want to start trying to rule your life is what they want to try and do and all these pests they're coming in from the same crack in the foundation of that basement and that's doubt if faith is the foundation then doubt is the crack in that Foundation and all these other things they're just children of doubt they're just side effects things that come along with doubt worry anxiety depression they're all children of Doubt amen if if if our faith if my faith I'll say mine if my faith was strong enough I would never have to worry about worry again right or fear or doubt or anxiety depression amen but you know what fear is I heard a a famous quote one time is from a basketball player that what no Good Michael Jordan he said limits like fears are often Just an Illusion that's a quote that he would say he said limits like fears are often Just an Illusion and you know what what an illusion is at the root of it it's a lie it's phony that's right it's not true at the root of an illusion any any magician any of it it is a lie it's tricking you into thinking that something like that's actually happening but it's not brother brandham said in the way to have Fellowship he said that's the trouble with man tonight that's what the trouble with people tonight you're scared he said that's the biggest curse there is on the Full Gospel people or any other people is because they are afraid says God has made the provision but you're afraid to take his word for it if you was wasn't afraid tonight why you would take your healing by faith and know that God promised it and the thing would just go Plum away from you he said afraid scared and I've noticed it and that's the reason I'm such a believer in healing I know that if you can get away from that scare and get love in its place something's going to happen there's only two faculties that govern a human and one of them is Faith which bringeth results and the other is fear which has no value in it at all faith is of god fear is of the devil fear Makes You Weary fear makes you wonder and if I was going to die in the morning what good would it do me to get all stewed up about it what if I was going to be electrocuted in the morning and my life had to end tomorrow morning what good would that do me to worry about it well you say what good would it do to have faith faith can sign my pardon he said sure there's value in faith don't be weary don't be scared don't be upset just have faith and believe and the only way you can have faith you have to have love first for love produces faith for perfect love get it perfect love casts out all fear amen amen Psalm 34 says I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears we have to realize though not everything that knocks on that front door is here to help it'll say I'm here to help but not everything that knocks on there is actually there to help who's our the story of the Trojan Horse with the Greek soldiers and the City of Troy so what happened there it was a giant wooden horse built by Greek soldiers they were on the outside of the city and the City of Troy was a waldof city and the Greek soldiers could not defeat the city of troit the the wall the door was the only thing that were saving those people in the city of troit and so they stayed inside their city but what the Greek soldiers did they built a giant wooden horse and they pushed it up to the front of the gate and what they had done is when they built the horse there was a bunch of soldiers inside of it and the people of Troy when they looked out they thought it was a peace offering they thought it was a sign that they had won the war that it was over and so what they did they didn't go out there and test it in any way they didn't go out there and knock on it see if anybody's inside of it they just welcomed it straight in they just brought the giant horse right inside the city and what they did right there is they they let the enemy in through deceit the enemy was so Sly and so subtle that he just snuck right in and when those those people in the city of Troy when they were sleeping that night the people broke out of that horse and overran the city the people of Troy open their door to the wrong thing it looked nice it looked like it could be something really nice maybe a monument in the city of a victory but it turned out to be their demise it turned out to harm them instead of help them 1 John 4:1 says beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God we must test these Spirits these things that we have the these spirits that we see on our phones that we see walking up and down the street they're we're in spiritual warfare today we're surrounded by it he wants to take you over spiritually cuz that's that's what's going to live eternally he don't care about this flesh I mean he likes to hurt it and harm it but he wants his Spirit flowing in you he don't want the Holy Spirit flowing in you that's right he don't want that at all but we got to be so careful he's became so subtle but after that exterminator comes you can expect behind him maybe a crooked salesman comes through maybe somebody's wanting to sell you something that it ain't the real deal now that Exterminator what he came and brought his Services they were the real they help you can see Improvement and you want him coming back I saw a story the other day it was in the San Diego newspaper and I just thought it it seemed like it went right along with this it said a man so this is a this is a man it's uh the owner of the home is his aunt and he was at home with his aunt this day and he said a man unexpectedly knocked on my aunt's door this month and presented an iPad with her name her birth date and address and the cost of her monthly home security bill so this man that showed up at her door he could tell her everything about herself he told her everything he knew it all and I thought it was kind of ironic that this was over the home security system in this story says he confirmed that she was still with her current alarm company and quickly asked if he could come inside to take a look at her situp the salesman said he was there to upgrade her system and lower her bill a that like the enemy he's always offering something better he's always offering that grass is greener on this side it's a little bit better over here this this ENT entertainment I have to show you it's a little bit better than kneeling in prayer says his friendly demeanor apparent knowledge of her account and the language of his offer led her to believe he worked for her existing provider says she's also a trusting person and this right here this next part this is the biggest mistake in my opinion that the lady made says she let him in and listened to what he had to say that was her biggest mistake that she made in this whole situation she didn't ask one question to him that it shows before he came in she she didn't she didn't dig a little deep and see if it was actually beneficial to her she just let him right in so he could talk a little bit longer after observing her current system the salesman was sure he could offer a better price and quoted her in amount that was about $10 cheaper despite including a new alarm panel and a doorbell camera says he had limited offers to give out however and could only guarantee the price if she signed right then he asked if there was somewhere they could sit down together and review the terms that's what the enemy like he likes to review the terms with you these terms that he thinks he has you on this sickness in your body these battles in your mind he likes to review these terms he wants to hear you confess these terms to him and talk about them he he wants to hear you brag on his handiwork all this stuff he's been working towards been been planning in your life for you he wants to review these terms he wants to hear you say it back to him a lot of the time confess how sick you are confess how bad off you are that's what he likes and then this right here this is where the the nephew comes in he says listening from the other room I stepped in and started asking questions isn't that just like that little that little small voice it'll step step in and it'll start asking those questions it'll say the the enemy will be saying you're sick but that still small voice says but you've been healed you ain't no more says as to exactly he worked for the man went on a complicated tangent of Lies deceit delusion that that's what the devil has a complicated tangent he's going to feed you a line of complicated tangent when you ask him what are you doing here and you start quoting that scripture to him that's what he's going to give you back he said about his company merged with my aunt's provider over a decade ago and now want to upgrade old customers we asked why her current company would allow him to do this but the salesman implied the two companies were working together handling different parts of the business after he insisted for a while longer that the deal had to be done today now here's their best decision and if you notice they made this decision together now when she let him in the door it was just her decision it was just her the nephew wasn't around that still Small Voice she she just let him in said we excuse the man from the house now they did that together so there's the difference right there says a Google search quickly revealed that his business had no remaining ties to her current provider despite his apparent knowledge of her account the man hadn't been offering an upgrade to her existing situp he was offering a different deal from a direct competitor so he it lied the whole time just got in the house it was his mission to get in the front door and then to Li his way to get in control of that house of security we must be so careful to test these things we never we never want to let something in that's going to push that Holy Spirit Away we don't want to grieve that holy spirit because we let something in that doesn't doesn't agree with it amen now brother brandham said he said if there's a question don't do it but when he says that that doesn't mean like if a brother is if he's questioning whether he should wear deodorant before church that morning that's not the kind of question we're talking about put the deodorant on brother that's wear it we're talking about scriptural stuff spiritual things amen the prophet said and believest thou this he said listen when Jesus leaves your house watch for sickness to come trouble heartaches disappointments don't you believe that when Jesus leaves your house trouble's coming in just as soon as he leaves but also that moment before you let Jesus in there's going to be quite a bit of trouble just like in war if there if if both the sides know of a stronghold that if either side they know if either one of them captures that stronghold then that war is over they they will they will command the rest of the war so when one side's approaching that stronghold the other side is going to unleash everything it has at that opposing side so that it may not reach it and that's exactly how the enemy does it when he knows you're getting close to that blessing when you have a service like this morning and he can see people blessed and see people moving forward and see people growing in the Lord just being refreshed in the Holy Spirit then he's going to send a barrage your way then Monday that that was Sunday Monday it's going to be serious you going have to put on your whole armor and you're going to have to walk through it but it's always worth it when you get out on the other side it is always worth it every single time that's right that's right but you can always expect once you let that Holy Spirit in the door Something Wicked will come knocking now also when we see a neighbor you know we just let the Exterminator come into our house when we see a brother or sister doing the same thing don't scoff at them for it you know we we just let the Exterminator come into our nasty bug ritten house to get the PED out so when you see somebody else doing the same thing that's right pray for them help them don't when they come down here don't think oh what did they do wrong don't think oh what kind of trouble are they in what kind of sin have they been hiding don't think that think I'm happy for that brother I'm happy for that sister amen because maybe you've watched him struggle for money and finally the thing you have been praying for happened and now when it happened we want to look at them like they're terrible like they've done something wrong but pray for him if that exterminator has exterminated your house you know what it's like so maybe even go over lend a hand give some advice some words of encouragement help them along because it's going to be so hard on them the enemy is going to be attacking them from the moment they get off their knees right there probably while they're on their knees amen right brother Brandon said and God being misunderstood he said and now there's many many times at this that people misjudge one another and it is a bad thing to do you say why she's got short hair she's wearing her dresses too short that that's not the Holy Spirit upon her don't do that don't do that that's not right you don't know what's in that woman's heart he said you don't know nothing about it you know that the Holy Spirit would make her conduct herself a little better now that may be true but I'll tell you as soon as soon as you and I let God do the judging of that and let you and I just pray for that person that God will show them the light that's like hindsight is 2020 we can all look back in our lives and we can clearly see what we should have done different in so many situations I notice sometimes we we have about 2010 Vision towards other Li others lives you know we can see it clear as day we can not or other churches other people in the message other beliefs in the message you know we got 2010 Vision when it comes to that we can see clearly and we can identify brother you're wrong here sister you're wrong here you should have done this different here but then when it comes to looking at our lives in the mirror when it's reflecting back and you're looking at it then we need bifocals all of a sudden then we need contacts we got to slap the contacts in put the bifocals on maybe get a magnifying glass maybe a telescope sometimes to identify in our lives what's going on I think a true Christian is honest with theirself I think God puts that in your heart I think that's part of growth as a Christian you learn how to be honest with yourself it's not always fun to face these sins or things in our life secret sins that besit us but you got to be honest about it true or else it will linger there and it will stay there forever as long as you'll let it those pests they will stay in your house and usually multi as long as you'll let them stay there but let's pray for one another be kind to one another this isn't a it's not a rat race to see who the best believer is you know I mean we're everybody you're running beside we're on the same team so let's let's join hands and run together if there's fast ones let them wait back with the slow ones carry them forward give them a helping hand now we strive for those things we want to do the best we can for the Lord but we don't leave others behind in the way wake of it we carry them with us as musicians come I'd like to read just one more quote it in the door in a door it says now that still little voice that knocks out your heart's door it might knock so many times till it may be very faint right now but let's just be honest just honest with God and ourselves for just one minute that little knock way down there that said I better curve my ways I'd better be different I'd better straighten up I know these things in me I know there's things in me I look here I examine my life with this word I see I'm wrong in many things look around see how good it's his goodness that knocks at the door he said no matter what you done how much we've sinned how much we've turned it away how much we said later on we'll do it he is still in the midst of All That Knocking he said and if any man or woman will just open your heart I'll come in and Su let's see what he wants this morning will you while we bow our heads now that is there a knock at your heart today is there something that's bothered you something that a struggle a Temptation well the Lord's on the other side of that door right he's wanting to come in and help he's wanting to come in and do something about it but that latch is on your side whatever it may be you have to accept it you have to open that latch and let him in amen and then at that point you're standing there he's on the other side it's decision making time these different things there there's an answer for all these things any of these struggles we have and that answer is on the other side of that door that refilling of the holy spirit it's on the other side side that door but you got to be willing to open that latch let it come on in that initial feeling it's right there it's waiting he wants to come in amen as brother Israel comes I just like to read one more for you he said in demonology he said but if God knocks at your heart you're the greatest privileged person in the world if God knocks at your heart you are the greatest privileged person in the world Amen God bless you Lord Give the Lord a hand of Praise man I

in there had warning in there the scripture reference actually that scripture actually applies directly to this age Revelations chapter 3 and brother Josh said something that remind me of this quote in what does thou hear uh 1959 paragraph 51 and and talking about when the Lord blesses you how the enemy is going to come back after you and he says this here is very strange Pastor here knows and other ministers watch after your Mount caramels you're going to have a juniper tree whenever a man has a blessing and the power of God Pours Down and does something for you look out Satan is on the track just remember the next day that Monday after a good day on Sunday is going to be a hard thing because he's going to do everything he can to knock that confidence out of you that the Holy Spirit instilled in you the day before and so we had a wonderful day today with the Holy Spirit instilled some confidence in there and give us faith we know Satan's coming he's coming but we want to keep the good man at the door which is our faith amen amen we thank God there's a song I know brother McHugh used to like this for the choirs to sing we'll try it it's a highway to Heaven I was thinking about
