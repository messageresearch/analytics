[14:06] my family Wife and Kids none to me name
[14:08] thought we saying this and I don't know
[14:10] that we do after getting to church and
[14:11] Scott said he's not so sure but I think
[14:14] we've all heard it and that helps
[14:15] because I don't like to sing solos you
[14:17] know that so you help us there is a
[14:19] quote that mom sent to me and I just
[14:21] like to read
[14:24] it I think it goes along with this this
[14:27] is brother brandham and proof of his res
[14:29] Direction he might appear to you in the
[14:30] form of your neighbor he might appear to
[14:33] you in the form of a minister or your
[14:36] mother Christ appears to you in people
[14:39] then treat everybody right be kindly be
[14:41] neighborly be loving Christ is the
[14:43] person Christ in you the hope of glory
[14:47] and as you go along and people appears
[14:49] to you a kind person speak to you listen
[14:51] to them you don't know it might be Jesus
[14:53] speaking to you see he appears I'll be
[14:56] with you even in you and as you do unto
[14:59] these do to me oh when you get to look
[15:01] at it at looking at it that way the old
[15:04] tradition Falls away see it doesn't
[15:06] become a form of words and a declaration
[15:09] of so many words put together it becomes
[15:12] a living reality that Christ is in us
[15:14] now the Holy Spirit moving back and
[15:16] forth through every being surging to
[15:18] Heart searching condemning the ruins
[15:21] life in there as you confess it he holds

[31:34] the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray
[31:36] amen God bless you you may be seated the
[31:40] importance of sound Doctrine you know
[31:43] this word Doctrine means something
[31:46] received that is
[31:48] instructions learning teaching Insight
[31:53] that's the the the's def definition of
[31:56] that word Doctrine from the Hebrew word
[32:00] leak it is all throughout the scripture
[32:03] many many scriptures talking about the
[32:07] doctrine and then maybe I'll take a few
[32:11] you know some folks and I encourage you
[32:14] to do it you have a little something on
[32:16] your mind or heart that little
[32:18] suggestion box in the back there you can
[32:20] write uh sometimes somebody will put a
[32:23] tape in there a good tape to listen to
[32:25] or a thought that they have our
[32:28] suggestion and we got we get those from
[32:31] time to time and we had a few and maybe
[32:34] I'll read one or two of those the Lord
[32:36] will help us
[32:38] amen and this sound Doctrine we'll find
[32:43] it throughout the scripture so what we
[32:45] did Saints is we took um conduct order
[32:50] and Doctrine and then the conduct we
[32:52] talked about our Behavior at the post of
[32:54] Duty forsake not the assembling of your
[32:57] yourselves giving your best how we dress
[33:02] uh fasting and prayer that was under the
[33:04] conduct and then we took a few services
[33:08] on the order I believe we started that
[33:11] with law having a shadow 19544 we played
[33:15] a portion of that tape then mzc received
[33:19] tithes the Holy Spirit government
[33:22] sovereignty of the local church each
[33:25] local church and then the sovereignty of
[33:27] the local church again and then we
[33:29] finished that with the remainder of that
[33:32] tape law having a
[33:34] shadow and um I've been getting good
[33:38] reports and good feedback from the
[33:40] Saints from some of the words that we
[33:43] have been bringing and this these little
[33:45] messages they haven't been too too long
[33:47] I don't think and uh we' just been
[33:50] blessed going through them very simple
[33:53] it's what we already know and I took um
[33:58] kind of tying in from Sunday
[34:01] morning the three um things that the
[34:04] church must be committed to a sacred
[34:09] responsibility was prayer the word and
[34:13] Christ how many remember that brother
[34:16] bam tells us that that was a Sac sacred
[34:18] trust that a church is committed to and
[34:21] we tied that in with The Godly mother
[34:25] and that we are really a true true
[34:27] mother is a true church that birth you
[34:31] you hear Brother Adam talking about your
[34:32] birth into this birth into this birth
[34:35] into that when you're talking about a
[34:36] birth you have to think of a mother
[34:39] because that's the only thing that gives
[34:41] birth and he talks about um those three
[34:46] things of sacred Trust of prayer and the
[34:51] word and to Christ and I went into this
[34:56] little booklet
[34:58] the 11th
[34:59] commandment and it's not a direct set of
[35:02] quotes but it was a book I call voice of
[35:05] God because I was trying to find that
[35:07] quotation that I mentioned to you all
[35:09] about offended and being offend
[35:13] offending offending and being offended
[35:17] but that's not really what he's what
[35:18] that what it says in this books it talks
[35:20] about hurting and being hurt that's the
[35:25] wording that he used and it's of the
[35:28] message um well a good portion of this
[35:31] how many you saw this before the 11th
[35:33] commandment it's really not a message
[35:35] it's broken up partly part of it is a
[35:39] message um you can find it if you go
[35:42] through it God projecting his
[35:45] love uh
[35:48] 1957 and but this is just added in this
[35:51] little booklet and they were sold at the
[35:53] brandom campaigns that were distributed
[35:56] do you feel cancer
[35:58] uh this 11th commandment and there's a a
[36:01] series of other ones William brandham a
[36:03] prophet visit South Africa 20th century
[36:07] Prophet um the eagle stir her nest and
[36:11] those different booklets they're not
[36:13] really in the search menu so you you
[36:15] won't find a quote where brother vanam
[36:17] is talking about that but if you take do
[36:20] you fear with cancer you'll know that
[36:22] that's directly from his message and
[36:24] they were they were uh sold and given
[36:27] out in the random campaign are you all
[36:30] hot we need to cool this down a little
[36:31] bit is okay all right maybe just a
[36:34] little more air I guess and so um but I
[36:39] like this and and I'm going to read this
[36:41] because it really kind of ties in with
[36:43] the message here tonight on Doctrine
[36:47] brother Brandon brings this in this
[36:49] booklet it's titled the 11th commandment
[36:52] bringing that love is the 11th
[36:55] commandment and you hear him make the
[36:58] statement many times
[36:59] no uh no
[37:03] um no book but the Bible no Doctrine but
[37:07] love no what would he
[37:09] say no law say help me
[37:12] out no law but love but no Creed but
[37:17] Christ no book but the Bible thank you
[37:20] message
[37:22] listeners no law but love no book but
[37:28] the Bible we should be able to show what
[37:30] we believe from this quotebook right
[37:33] here because that's what this message is
[37:36] founded upon and so um and it is all
[37:42] founded upon the love all of our
[37:45] Doctrine everything we do conduct orders
[37:49] communion whatever it is being in church
[37:52] our Behavior doing all those things
[37:55] paying your tithings worshiping the Lord
[37:58] through giving all of those things have
[38:00] to be founded what we believe preach and
[38:03] stand for has to be founded upon love
[38:08] the 11th commandment if it is not
[38:10] founded upon love all of our giving and
[38:14] everything else is in vain and so the
[38:17] prophet of God takes this and I'll just
[38:19] read out of this like I say the 11th
[38:22] commandment it's not a quote so they
[38:24] won't find it here but I'll read it out
[38:26] of this 11th command it we'll call it
[38:29] message resource or message material
[38:32] that was in the brandham campaign says
[38:33] love is not based on legalistic laws
[38:37] that we have to keep love is based on
[38:41] faith in one another faith in God trust
[38:45] in God confidence in God and I will tell
[38:48] you this my friends when the love of God
[38:52] comes into your heart you won't go
[38:55] around hurting and being being hurt when
[38:58] you believe God really believe him and
[39:03] get married to him you die out to the
[39:06] things of the world then God projects
[39:09] his love and his love makes you what you
[39:12] are love that you don't go
[39:15] around hurting and being hurt and so
[39:20] this love once again brother R takes it
[39:24] in the message love and God projecting
[39:27] is love and he says this here in
[39:29] paragraph number 20 sorry sis I didn't
[39:32] give this to you but this is what the
[39:34] prophet says in the message love I think
[39:37] love is the greatest Force there is in
[39:40] the world there's nothing more powerful
[39:43] than love if I had the choice tonight
[39:46] and was a sinner and was standing here
[39:48] before God and he have said now boy I'm
[39:51] going to give you all nine spiritual
[39:53] gifts I'm going to let you prophesy give
[39:57] you the Spirit of Prophecy I'm going to
[39:58] give you a m make going to make you a
[40:01] mighty preacher give you the word of
[40:03] wisdom and understanding I'm going to
[40:06] give you the gift of speak in tongues to
[40:08] interpret I'm going to give you a gift
[40:10] of healing that you'll have great faith
[40:12] for the sick and I'm going to do all
[40:15] these things for you I'll give you all
[40:17] that or I won't let you have any of
[40:20] those things but let you have Real Love
[40:23] in Your Heart I'd say God Give Me Love
[40:28] that's right you know what's so nice
[40:30] about this quote because brother
[40:32] brandham had all that those gifts and
[40:35] tremendous signs wonders and miracles
[40:38] and he said he would take love over all
[40:42] of that real love in your heart he says
[40:46] this here in God projecting his love
[40:50] 1957 I think if one thing is needed in
[40:53] the great Universal Church of God
[40:56] tonight is love
[40:57] we do not need other things as much as
[40:59] we think we do and all these other
[41:02] things our emotions our gifts they are
[41:04] wonderful to God we give praise but if
[41:08] those gifts are not governed by love
[41:10] then they are not
[41:12] effective love should govern the home
[41:16] love is the greatest force that was ever
[41:18] put into the power of man a home that's
[41:23] not disciplined by loved is not much of
[41:26] a home if a husband and wife doesn't
[41:29] solemnly love each other they cannot
[41:31] trust each other that's why I think that
[41:34] instead of resting our faith upon some
[41:36] emotion which is all right or some gift
[41:39] which is all right like shouting
[41:42] speaking with tongues or with other
[41:43] things that we take saying that we have
[41:46] the Holy Spirit when we do those things
[41:48] are all right but if we would come back
[41:51] to the principle love first then those
[41:55] things I think our church would progress
[41:59] a lot faster if we would get God first
[42:04] and God is love how many's heard these
[42:08] kind of quotes before how many you know
[42:11] this is the foundation of what brother
[42:13] random brought to us so couldn't we say
[42:16] that if we're really in the message then
[42:19] we really have the love that he's
[42:21] talking about the doctrine we can argue
[42:25] that's being able to read the doct we
[42:27] can stand with because we're saying what
[42:30] the prophet said but how many know we
[42:33] can say what the Bible said or even what
[42:35] God him said himself or quote the
[42:38] prophet verbatim and still not have love
[42:40] in our heart that's something different
[42:43] than just reading now we believe in
[42:45] reading the quotes don't misunderstand
[42:47] me we believe in staying with the word
[42:50] but we could stay with the word in our
[42:52] minds and still not have love in our
[42:55] heart and this is really what's lacking
[42:59] this is the big issue right here this is
[43:02] the trouble with our churches our homes
[43:06] our Ministries looking in the mirror
[43:10] this is your biggest problem right here
[43:12] is divine love if you have that Divine
[43:16] love in you you're not walking around
[43:18] looking at who don't like you or looking
[43:22] for a reason to argue with someone you
[43:25] have that Divine love in your your heart
[43:27] your focus is so much greater it's so
[43:30] much deeper got too many things to
[43:33] achieve than spend time arguing with
[43:35] people because the love part remember
[43:38] when you got saved remember when the
[43:41] love of God Came Upon you everybody was
[43:44] nice everybody was lovely everybody was
[43:49] a
[43:50] Believer but now we know who the three
[43:52] kinds of Believers are now and we
[43:55] identify them don't we
[43:58] I think and I believe like brother
[44:00] brandom says these are not just
[44:01] statements he made I think this is what
[44:03] we have to go back to get the love right
[44:08] and then find out what you believe
[44:10] doctrinally I I'll tell you this you
[44:13] know on these doctrines we call them
[44:16] doctrines they say Do you believe this
[44:19] particular Doctrine you believe the the
[44:21] seven Thunders or do you believe a deity
[44:25] or you believe the return Ministry
[44:27] or do you believe the two souls or do
[44:31] you believe the bride is going to bring
[44:34] the Revival do you believe it's we're
[44:36] waiting till brother random comes back
[44:38] what do we believe these are all these
[44:40] doctrines that men have uh presented to
[44:44] us and caused us to try to maybe pick a
[44:48] side and then those of us that don't
[44:51] pick a side someone will pick one for us
[44:54] and tell us what side we're on
[44:57] but it's so nice to know that they
[45:00] didn't know what side brother bam was on
[45:02] it's like where what side you on anyway
[45:05] he was on the Lord's Side how about that
[45:08] side they want to put him in this little
[45:11] you know and they'll try to get you into
[45:13] that don't fall for that trap stay with
[45:16] the
[45:17] word and so they call them doctrines and
[45:21] they call them little issues but I like
[45:24] to bring it like this brother will I'll
[45:26] say you know if you know they they
[45:29] they've they've got us labeled with
[45:31] something some of y'all and they got me
[45:33] labeled with something um
[45:38] whatever they'll continue to label but
[45:41] when they come and talk to
[45:43] me I don't have a problem with any
[45:45] quotes that brother Brandon
[45:47] brought and that's where I stand I don't
[45:51] have a problem with any part of the
[45:52] Bible that's where I stand that ought to
[45:55] be good enough for you now if we want to
[45:57] pick a side then that's on you to do
[46:00] that but come talking to me brother isra
[46:03] what you believe about this bring the
[46:06] quotations and let's talk around that
[46:08] let's talk about what brother so so said
[46:10] or that group over there because I know
[46:11] you went to Brother soo's church I know
[46:13] you preach for so and so so you must
[46:14] believe I don't want to talk about that
[46:17] bring the
[46:18] quotations bring the ministry bring the
[46:21] Bible and let's lay it out there and
[46:23] let's take a quote for quote and find
[46:25] out who believe and who don't
[46:27] believe it's just that simple okay all
[46:32] right so God has a Doctrine for us to
[46:36] believe and and Deuteronomy says my
[46:39] Doctrine give here my Doctrine shall
[46:43] drop as the rain and I read that
[46:46] scripture second Timothy chapter 4
[46:49] because brother brandom takes it and
[46:52] says that the time will come when they
[46:55] will not endure pure sound Doctrine and
[46:59] we see that time it was prophesied to
[47:03] come and we see what's taking place
[47:05] today they'll turn their ears from the
[47:09] truth but I want to read something here
[47:12] or brother brandom is bringing the
[47:15] restoration message to us and he's in
[47:19] the restoration of the Bride tree and
[47:22] he's talking about this third stage
[47:24] which was a cankerworm we know that the
[47:27] word was restored we know that the gifts
[47:31] were restored we know that the order of
[47:34] the church was restored we know that all
[47:37] these things were restored but also the
[47:40] doctrine was restored and this is what
[47:44] we believe this is where we stand this
[47:48] is how we stand in in um and how we
[47:53] handle the word you know in water
[47:55] baptism or the holy ghost or the gifts
[47:58] of the Spirit or all of the Visions not
[48:01] just the pretty cute ones we can explain
[48:03] I'm talking about all of the Visions how
[48:06] do you stand with those Visions brother
[48:10] vam takes it here in paragraph 234 and
[48:13] the restoration of the brid tree and he
[48:15] says this
[48:16] here but the third stage of him was the
[48:19] canker worm that's got a bad name to
[48:22] start with the cankerworm what does the
[48:25] cankerworm do it goes into the bark
[48:28] that's the lifeline there yes sir it
[48:32] goes into the bark and it destroys the
[48:35] covering of the tree the covering what
[48:38] is religion covering that's what the
[48:41] word religion means of covering so this
[48:45] little cankerworm after he got amongst
[48:47] the congregation got them all
[48:50] dignified then he took all the
[48:52] fellowship away from them in the form of
[48:54] the Locust now he comes around and takes
[48:57] their very religion and makes dogmas out
[49:00] of it right sets up an
[49:03] orthodox an unorthodox words forms
[49:07] himself a religion gets a bunch of men
[49:10] together and put a Creed down there he
[49:13] takes the very religion and strips off
[49:15] of God's tree very bark that bears the
[49:19] sap that comes up in it takes it away
[49:23] cankerworm do you see the that insect
[49:26] conation says amen the cankerworm that
[49:29] was Rome in the early church brother gr
[49:32] continues on same message paragraph 246
[49:35] God sent the Holy Spirit life of God to
[49:39] be in you not in the Statue you are the
[49:42] guy that God wants to live in not a
[49:44] statue but in you people call Holy
[49:48] statues there ain't no no holy statues
[49:52] you are God's holy statue the Bible said
[49:56] so that's right a body H has thou
[49:58] prepared me now this little fellow
[50:01] started destroying destroying what the
[50:05] cankerworm got into the bark Watch what
[50:08] it did begin to
[50:12] destroy begin to destroy the bark what
[50:14] did it do it made a natural church for a
[50:18] spiritual church yes sir it took away
[50:22] the true and give it a false now
[50:25] remember
[50:27] the fruit the pmer worm eat the leaf the
[50:30] Locust eat now the bark the covering the
[50:34] religion the doctrine the doctrine the
[50:38] cankerworm
[50:40] got paragraph 381 same message
[50:43] continuing on so brother Ram is showing
[50:46] what this covering is what religion is
[50:49] he's talking about the doctrine is what
[50:51] the cankerworm got into 381 he says he
[50:55] get into the bark and bore into the
[50:57] Ridge and take the doctrine away from
[51:00] them see the very thing that supports
[51:04] the life then as soon as he gets
[51:08] hes soon as he gets hes barded in that
[51:12] he had the next order come alone the old
[51:15] sucker the caterpillar took the
[51:18] denomination and sucked it up so here
[51:21] the prophet of God is showing us that
[51:23] it's actually our Doctrine which is is
[51:26] the Bark that protects the lifeline of
[51:30] the tree it protects the lifeline of the
[51:33] church is our Doctrine it's very
[51:36] important see well um you know long as
[51:41] we believe God and long as we go to
[51:44] church long as we do these other things
[51:47] but many people don't really study the
[51:50] message they don't internalize what they
[51:53] believe they don't get a grasp for it
[51:56] and we're not we're not we're not
[51:58] striving to be theologians but we can
[52:00] all have a better understanding of what
[52:03] we believe it starts by listening to it
[52:06] reading it and praying and let God
[52:09] reveal that word to you and this
[52:11] Doctrine is the lifeline it's all
[52:14] through the Old Testament and New
[52:17] Testament Isaiah 28 tells us that who
[52:21] can he teach
[52:23] knowledge who can he um wean from the
[52:28] breast who can he teach those things he
[52:31] said that all the tables were full with
[52:35] vomit and there had to be a doctrine
[52:39] that would come and bring Clarity to all
[52:42] these things
[52:43] amen I believe it's in Isaiah 28:
[52:49] 8-13 I want to show you and share with
[52:51] you that there is an importance to
[52:54] knowing what we believe
[52:57] knowing where we stand uh I think
[53:00] sometimes we not might not be able to
[53:03] articulate it all but we should be able
[53:06] to know when somebody's speaking
[53:07] something false we should know the word
[53:11] enough not to maybe to argue but to say
[53:13] you know what that's not right I can't
[53:15] explain it but let me call brother or so
[53:18] and so whoever that can help you out a
[53:20] little bit in what we believe because um
[53:24] outside of the message
[53:27] it's just church as usual out there and
[53:32] if our Doctrine is not distinguish if
[53:36] there's no difference signs wonders
[53:39] Miracles healings loves choirs being
[53:42] able to sing everybody has that What
[53:44] Makes Us different is our Doctrine what
[53:48] we believe I don't know anyone that
[53:49] believes marriage and divorce like we do
[53:52] or takes a stand on the godhead like we
[53:55] do or takes a stand on a holy life and
[53:58] clean living like we do and these things
[54:02] are part of the doctrine and Jesus in
[54:05] Isaiah 28 says for all the tables are
[54:08] full of vomit and filthiness so that
[54:10] there is no place clean Whom Shall he
[54:12] teach knowledge Whom Shall he make to
[54:15] understand Doctrine them that are weaned
[54:17] from the milk and drawn from the breast
[54:20] for precept must be upon precept precept
[54:23] upon precept line upon line line upon
[54:27] line here a little there a little for
[54:31] with stammering lips and another tongue
[54:33] will I speak to this people so Jesus in
[54:39] Matthew chapter 22 we're going to give
[54:42] you time to pray tonight we want to take
[54:45] I cut off just a little bit early but so
[54:49] we'd have time to pray get into the
[54:52] spirit of prayer and ask God to give us
[54:55] love the love of God surrounding these
[54:59] great this great Pillar of Fire huh the
[55:02] great mystery of the last day that God
[55:05] would give us love to accompany this
[55:09] Bible here the love to accompany this
[55:13] message how many know you need more love
[55:16] you need that this this 11 commandment
[55:19] really shook me I was looking for that
[55:21] and I called my father-in-law brother
[55:23] Ferguson and he showed me he said it was
[55:25] in the 11th commandment but it wasn't
[55:28] the way I thought it was when I as I
[55:30] read through it is and then it brings
[55:31] out hurting and being hurt but I went
[55:34] through that message is actually in that
[55:36] tape I told you God projecting his love
[55:38] 1957 oh it just struck me again how
[55:42] brother brandom really highlights the
[55:46] love of God the reason why these
[55:49] Miracles could take place in his life
[55:52] and really he can enter into the love
[55:55] for these people people that's why he
[55:57] could help them because you really
[56:00] really love them what if I really really
[56:03] love this neighborhood or the community
[56:06] that I'm called to serve if I really
[56:09] really love them they will know it it
[56:12] will move me to do something because
[56:15] love has to be expressed and you can't
[56:19] just say you love somebody your love
[56:21] will come out it will show through
[56:24] expression and if you really love The
[56:26] Sinner in that Community you'll create a
[56:29] way to reach them you'll create your
[56:32] love will move you it'll create it's not
[56:36] a blueprint somebody telling you what to
[56:38] do your love will push you to find out a
[56:42] way to write out a track to write a song
[56:44] to drop a note to ride through the
[56:46] neighborhood to park in the park find
[56:48] somebody to talk to your love will drive
[56:52] you to that how many you know what I'm
[56:54] talking about sure
[56:57] you um you're in love with a girl or a
[56:59] boy and you don't have no money you find
[57:02] some kind of way to talk to them anyways
[57:05] like I did with my wife we didn't have
[57:07] email so we got on the phone long
[57:10] distance and we got we paid bills that
[57:13] we didn't have money for my dad was like
[57:16] how much time you gonna spend on this
[57:17] phone talking to this girl all that's
[57:20] when you have to pay for minutes brother
[57:22] Tim yes giv them little calling Char and
[57:26] me like I got 30 more minutes left on
[57:29] here and broke flat
[57:33] broke but my love pushed me to keep
[57:37] calling spending money I didn't have
[57:40] love will move you love will push you
[57:44] and if you really love the sinner I can
[57:47] sit you down and you can
[57:49] articulate what you want to see happen
[57:52] in those Sinners
[57:54] lives amen
[57:56] absolutely and our doctrine that we
[57:59] believe and teach and we preach so
[58:01] fervently and we preach it so hard we
[58:03] hear brother brandom preach it he was
[58:05] motivated by
[58:08] love he left his home he preached he's
[58:11] tired uh set at the platform I was
[58:14] reading one place in Phoenix he called
[58:16] for a healing of a child he says
[58:19] everybody challenge the devil and he
[58:21] spent two and a half hours praying for
[58:24] one girl to be here healed labored in
[58:28] there until the Holy Spirit finally
[58:30] answered the prayer and it broke he said
[58:32] it did it again in Vermont a boy 14
[58:35] years old blind from birth and he
[58:38] challenged everyone and they brought
[58:39] that boy and he prayed for I think he
[58:42] said two hours could you imagine he held
[58:47] up the whole prayer line the whole Ser
[58:49] some of us can't even church for two
[58:51] hours let alone him praying for one case
[58:55] for two
[58:56] hours a man that's doing that ain't
[58:59] doing it for no money a man that's doing
[59:02] that is because he was called to do it
[59:06] he's pushed he's pressured to do it
[59:11] amen
[59:13] amen and so that 11th commandment really
[59:16] touched me really brings this love out
[59:20] and so this Matthew chapter 22 we'll
[59:23] take this just for a moment
[59:27] here Jesus now I have several quotes and
[59:30] I'm just going to pull over here but
[59:33] it's several quotes here but I want to
[59:35] take the scriptures here in Matthew
[59:37] chapter 22 and verse number 24 they're
[59:39] trying to trap Jesus they're trying to
[59:41] catch him and these are the Pharisees
[59:44] and the Sadducees that had two different
[59:47] extreme doctrines one believed in the
[59:50] Supernatural with angels the other ones
[59:52] did not and so they're both were trying
[59:55] to catch catch him in his words they
[59:58] couldn't catch him they never heard
[1:00:00] anybody that Tau like him forget about
[1:00:03] the miracle signs and wonders those were
[1:00:05] there too but his teaching set him apart
[1:00:09] because he taught like one that had
[1:00:11] Authority and not like the scribes and
[1:00:14] Pharisees as the Bible says so his
[1:00:16] teaching separated him where is this man
[1:00:20] get this from where is he getting this
[1:00:22] from what school did you go through
[1:00:25] where where is he where's the thinking
[1:00:27] coming from see that that Doctrine and
[1:00:30] that teaching has to be a revelation
[1:00:32] here Jesus himself in Matthew chapter 22
[1:00:36] and verse 24 says this saying Master
[1:00:40] Moses said if a man die having no
[1:00:43] children his brother shall marry his
[1:00:45] wife and raise up seed unto his brother
[1:00:48] now there were with us seven Brethren
[1:00:50] and the first when he married a wife
[1:00:53] deceased having no issue left his wife
[1:00:56] unto his brother likewise the second
[1:00:58] also and the third unto the seventh and
[1:01:02] last of all the woman died also
[1:01:04] therefore in the resurrection whose wife
[1:01:07] shall she be of the seven for they all
[1:01:11] had her Jesus answered and said unto
[1:01:13] them you do he not knowing the
[1:01:17] scriptures nor the power of God for in
[1:01:21] the resurrection they neither marry nor
[1:01:23] are given in marriage but are as the
[1:01:26] angels of God in heaven but as touching
[1:01:30] the resurrection of the Dead have you
[1:01:32] not read that which was spoken unto you
[1:01:36] by God saying I am the god of Abraham
[1:01:40] the god of Isaac the god of Jacob God is
[1:01:44] not the god of the dead but of the
[1:01:46] living and when the multitude heard this
[1:01:50] they were astonished at what astonished
[1:01:54] at his Doctrine but when the Pharisees
[1:01:57] had heard that he had put the Sadducees
[1:02:00] to silence they were gathered together
[1:02:03] then one of them which was the Lord
[1:02:04] asked him a question tempting him saying
[1:02:07] Master which is the greatest commandment
[1:02:09] in the law Jesus said unto him Thou
[1:02:13] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[1:02:15] heart with all thy soul with all thy
[1:02:18] mind this is the first and great
[1:02:22] commandment and the second is like unto
[1:02:25] it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:02:30] thyself on these two
[1:02:34] Commandments hang all and the all hang
[1:02:39] all the law and the prophets isn't that
[1:02:45] beautiful so the Lord is breaking some
[1:02:47] things to them they never heard before
[1:02:50] and if I had time and I brought it here
[1:02:52] before to you
[1:02:54] all um but it's the angel of the Lord
[1:02:57] that taught brother Bram the things that
[1:02:59] he taught he said so the angel of the
[1:03:02] Lord taught him so asking this question
[1:03:05] about what happens to this these Family
[1:03:09] Matters this woman who was married to
[1:03:12] this man and following the law of Moses
[1:03:15] in Direction Resurrection whose wife
[1:03:18] shall she be they didn't have the
[1:03:21] understanding of it just like we didn't
[1:03:23] have the understanding of what happens
[1:03:25] to a man when he dies until brother
[1:03:28] brandom went beyond the curtain of
[1:03:32] time I can't preach a funeral the same
[1:03:35] way after hearing that nobody in the
[1:03:39] denomination ever opened up what it was
[1:03:43] beyond the curtain of time brother
[1:03:45] brandom himself didn't quite know he
[1:03:48] thought brother Neville that would be
[1:03:50] like Spirits hanging around and they
[1:03:52] were Fellowship but they couldn't shake
[1:03:54] hands but when he went beyond the
[1:03:56] curtain of time his teaching had to
[1:03:59] change his Doctrine had to change it was
[1:04:03] more real and he came back with a
[1:04:06] fervent command keep pressing if you
[1:04:11] only knew and we saw that even on the
[1:04:15] other side he's still a
[1:04:17] leader we find out that if he didn't go
[1:04:20] we wouldn't be there we'll see that we
[1:04:24] are resting upon that you heard that
[1:04:27] crowd say that how many you know that's
[1:04:29] not just a story that really happened
[1:04:33] that's a that's a real place some of you
[1:04:39] met brother brandom and handled him that
[1:04:41] man went beyond the curtain of time and
[1:04:43] came back and told us what was going on
[1:04:46] over there so we're not guessing we're
[1:04:49] not
[1:04:53] questioning I got one brother in the
[1:04:56] sacramental church he said that when
[1:04:59] when we he thinks that when we uh get
[1:05:02] over on the other side that we'll all
[1:05:05] kind of look look the same and as after
[1:05:09] he described what he looked
[1:05:11] like that's what he was describing what
[1:05:14] everybody else would look like on the
[1:05:15] other side I said that's quite
[1:05:16] convenient but God made us all look the
[1:05:19] way we look for a reason right and and
[1:05:23] when brother banon went on the other
[1:05:25] side there was was in all one
[1:05:27] color they were there were different
[1:05:30] types of people there beautiful people
[1:05:34] love he described their teeth their hair
[1:05:38] the sparkle in their eye he described he
[1:05:42] said there was no human words to
[1:05:44] describe that so now how can I preach or
[1:05:47] teach any Doctrine contrary to that it
[1:05:50] changes all of that amen so you'll see
[1:05:53] this question that they asked the
[1:05:55] Pharisees and the Sadducees asked Jesus
[1:05:59] about the resurrection there's still a
[1:06:00] lot of points we don't quite fully
[1:06:02] understand don't fully quite understand
[1:06:05] how it all lines up where was Paul at
[1:06:09] he's in the third heaven what the third
[1:06:11] one brother Bron went to the first
[1:06:15] heaven and so we see that there's so
[1:06:17] much more to look forward to but we have
[1:06:20] enough in our doctrine that we know what
[1:06:22] to preach and we know how to stand is
[1:06:25] that right
[1:06:26] now the scripture is quite clear to tell
[1:06:29] us that in vain they worship they teach
[1:06:34] for Doctrine the Commandments of
[1:06:37] men in one of the translations it says
[1:06:40] it like this they worship me in vain
[1:06:43] their teachings are merely human
[1:06:47] rules and that's what some of some
[1:06:49] people that they call Doctrine is just
[1:06:52] somebody's
[1:06:53] idea it's not found founded upon the
[1:06:56] word it's not founded upon the angel of
[1:06:59] the Lord the message of the hour it's
[1:07:02] founded upon somebody's idea about
[1:07:05] something and Ephesians chapter 4 tells
[1:07:07] us that that we that we should um that
[1:07:11] God gave all of these great gifts
[1:07:13] Apostles pastors teachers for the
[1:07:15] Perfection of the Saints verse 20 verse
[1:07:18] 13 says till we all come into the unity
[1:07:21] of the faith and the knowledge of the
[1:07:23] Son of God unto a perfect man unto the
[1:07:26] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:07:28] of Christ verse 14 that we henceforth be
[1:07:34] no more
[1:07:35] children tossed to and fro and carried
[1:07:40] about with every wind of Doctrine by the
[1:07:44] Slate of man cunning craftiness whereby
[1:07:47] they lie in weight to deceive so we see
[1:07:50] that there is a stability that comes
[1:07:53] when we have this
[1:07:56] Doctrine 1 Timothy chap 1 veres 1-4 says
[1:08:01] this unto Timothy my own son in the
[1:08:04] faith grace mercy and peace from God our
[1:08:08] Father and Jesus Christ Our Lord as I
[1:08:11] besought Thee to abide still at Ephesus
[1:08:13] when I went into Macedonia that thou
[1:08:16] mightest charge some that they teach no
[1:08:19] other Doctrine neither give heed to
[1:08:22] fables and endless genealogies
[1:08:25] which minister questions rather than
[1:08:29] Godly edifying which is in faith so do
[1:08:35] can you say praise the
[1:08:36] Lord so he's admonishing them to teach
[1:08:41] no other Doctrine here's one that's
[1:08:44] quite strong I think it's in first John
[1:08:47] let's see if I can find it here quickly
[1:09:04] second John actually let's take Romans
[1:09:07] chapter 16 verse 17 and 18 first then
[1:09:11] second John 1 9-11 look at what the
[1:09:14] Bible says now beseech you Brethren mark
[1:09:18] them which cause
[1:09:21] divisions and
[1:09:23] offenses contr to the doctrine which ye
[1:09:28] have learned and do what to
[1:09:31] them follow them on Facebook do what to
[1:09:36] them see what they got to say hear them
[1:09:40] follow after them because they in the
[1:09:42] city the Bible says to avoid them first
[1:09:45] it says to mark them and then avoid them
[1:09:49] who's the them those that are causing
[1:09:53] divisions that are cont to the doctrine
[1:09:57] which we have learned so how do you know
[1:10:00] what you have learned if you're not into
[1:10:02] the teachings of what God gave in this
[1:10:05] generation God didn't call you to sit up
[1:10:07] and listen to
[1:10:08] everybody it's quite dangerous in fact
[1:10:11] he warns you to avoid that foolishness
[1:10:15] that's out there you type in the name
[1:10:18] brandom or William brandom online you're
[1:10:20] not going to get the truth you're going
[1:10:22] to get a lot of garbage you think you
[1:10:25] can sit there and take it it's not it's
[1:10:28] not convenient for you to sit and listen
[1:10:30] to that when you can hear the truth
[1:10:33] amen it's spicy yeah it's a it's
[1:10:36] newsworthy it's what people are doing
[1:10:39] today we like to hear something itching
[1:10:42] ears and all of that but it's it's not
[1:10:45] it's not it's not to your benefit in
[1:10:48] fact the scriptures warn us to mark them
[1:10:52] that caus that and to avoid them that
[1:10:56] has to apply to somebody Saints
[1:10:59] huh that has to apply somewhere in our
[1:11:03] life what is that that's the doctrine
[1:11:06] why why because that is your
[1:11:09] lifeline that's where that's the bark
[1:11:12] that covers the tree amen
[1:11:15] so for 2 john9 through1 we'll take this
[1:11:20] one here in verse number nine second
[1:11:22] John second John the
[1:11:26] epistle verse number
[1:11:29] nine can we read it together whosoever
[1:11:33] transgresseth and abideth not in the
[1:11:36] doctrine of Christ hath not God he that
[1:11:40] abideth in the doctrine of Christ he
[1:11:43] hath both the father and the son if
[1:11:47] there come any unto you and bring not
[1:11:51] this Doctrine receive him not into to
[1:11:55] your house neither bid him God's speed
[1:12:00] for he that bth him God's speed is just
[1:12:03] being a nice
[1:12:05] person that's not what it
[1:12:07] says is partaker of his evil
[1:12:13] Deeds listening to a Brother's tape I
[1:12:15] still call him a brother years ago and I
[1:12:18] was listening to that tape and he
[1:12:20] started going on some stuff and it just
[1:12:23] started to grieve me just a little bit I
[1:12:25] said well I'll just listen to the rest
[1:12:26] of it and something told me turn it off
[1:12:29] and get it out of your house and that's
[1:12:32] exactly what I did because you know what
[1:12:34] what I'm gonna lose what I'm GNA lose oh
[1:12:37] I missed that brother's me
[1:12:40] huh I'm gonna miss a lot of things I
[1:12:43] don't want to miss what he's talking
[1:12:44] about I don't want to miss the Rapture I
[1:12:47] don't want to miss what the Lord is
[1:12:49] trying to be bring to me I might miss a
[1:12:51] few special I might miss somebody
[1:12:53] special meetings I might not hear
[1:12:55] everybody's series on what they're
[1:12:57] preaching on but I don't want to miss
[1:12:59] what God sent me this message amen God
[1:13:03] told me very
[1:13:04] clearly The Voice told me very clearly
[1:13:07] get out of that and I turn turn that
[1:13:09] tape off gave it back to whoever gave it
[1:13:11] got it out of the home and five six
[1:13:14] years later it was manifested that that
[1:13:17] brother went further and further into
[1:13:19] the Folly and the foolishness and still
[1:13:21] till today and many people follow it
[1:13:24] they log on and go line to it and they
[1:13:26] listen to it but I'm not going to listen
[1:13:29] to it no
[1:13:31] sir
[1:13:33] why because he
[1:13:36] warned me so we take this very very
[1:13:41] seriously don't we let's take one more
[1:13:43] scripture in Revelation Chapter 2 ver 14
[1:13:46] and 15 now this is through the church
[1:13:50] ages this is the ages coming for the
[1:13:52] future Church
[1:13:55] and here
[1:13:57] the voice of the Lord is bringing these
[1:14:01] two characters back into view to the New
[1:14:05] Testament Saints and these two these
[1:14:08] this this this Prophet has already lived
[1:14:11] his life and gone on verse number 14 I
[1:14:15] have a few things against thee because
[1:14:18] thou Hast there them that hold the
[1:14:21] doctrine of
[1:14:23] balum who taught BAC to cast a stumbling
[1:14:27] block before the children of Israel to
[1:14:30] eat things sacrificed unto idols and to
[1:14:32] commit fornication so hast thou also
[1:14:36] them that hold the doctrine of the who
[1:14:41] the nitin which thing I hate so God
[1:14:46] hates this Doctrine he hates the
[1:14:48] doctrine of the nickan let me see if I
[1:14:50] can find this one more scripture all
[1:14:56] right how many you love the
[1:14:59] Lord okay let me kind find it all
[1:15:03] right scriptures talk
[1:15:10] about the
[1:15:16] doctrine of
[1:15:19] devils where is that at Saints help
[1:15:23] me hm
[1:15:30] okay we'll wait I'll find it right here
[1:15:32] myself let's
[1:15:46] see who said
[1:15:48] it no
[1:15:50] one oh they're not going to help me all
[1:15:53] right all right
[1:15:59] I try to save time so I don't read
[1:16:01] everything I have
[1:16:04] so say it
[1:16:07] sis yes First
[1:16:10] Timothy
[1:16:16] for you know what I didn't write it down
[1:16:18] I did yes right here 1 and two 1 Timothy
[1:16:24] 41 one
[1:16:26] two now thank you sis sister Heather
[1:16:30] amen now the spirit speaketh expressedly
[1:16:34] that in the latter times some shall
[1:16:38] depart from the faith we see that
[1:16:40] happening don't we giving heed to
[1:16:44] seducing
[1:16:46] spirits and doctrines of
[1:16:51] devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having
[1:16:55] their conscience seared with the hot
[1:16:58] iron so so there are doctrines of devils
[1:17:05] that have been released to seduce
[1:17:08] people is that what the Bible says very
[1:17:12] clear very very clear this is the hour
[1:17:16] that we're living in this is the last
[1:17:18] days and the last time this is why our
[1:17:22] Doctrine has to be founded upon the word
[1:17:25] of the Lord and that Doctrine comes
[1:17:27] through the ministry of Malachi 4 if he
[1:17:30] didn't bring it then it ain't worth
[1:17:32] preaching or talking
[1:17:35] about so and so said this so and so said
[1:17:38] that what did the prophet say really
[1:17:41] that's what we we're interested in and
[1:17:44] that Foundation has to be founded upon
[1:17:47] Divine love amen we don't say that
[1:17:50] arrogantly we can say that rudely we do
[1:17:53] get upset at some of these things people
[1:17:55] say stuff we want to defend the faith
[1:17:57] but really the the it has to be
[1:17:59] motivated by love divine love that's
[1:18:03] what we desire that's what God has for
[1:18:05] us now one of the sermons that we
[1:18:08] brought during this conduct order in
[1:18:10] Doctrine we talked on how we dress and
[1:18:12] someone brought up to the little note
[1:18:16] there I won't read it but they were
[1:18:20] talking
[1:18:21] about the dress code and how they're
[1:18:26] that these feminine colors that men are
[1:18:30] wearing today
[1:18:32] patterns and um and that's you know
[1:18:37] that's something in my mind too I I
[1:18:39] don't think just because it's in the
[1:18:42] men's section that I should buy it and
[1:18:45] put it
[1:18:47] on because they have lost their
[1:18:50] mind am I am I right Saints so there
[1:18:53] takes some discernment because I'm here
[1:18:55] to portray something and our and our
[1:18:58] attitude and the way we dress and all of
[1:19:01] that there is
[1:19:03] Hollywood that wants to influence us in
[1:19:06] the latest styles of dress and dress
[1:19:09] wear for men and women there's an
[1:19:13] influence you walk into JC Pennies
[1:19:15] wherever you go to shop wherever you go
[1:19:18] go online and they're making them men
[1:19:20] look more feminist all the time
[1:19:26] soft sorry I mean it really looks sad
[1:19:30] we're not not bashing against anybody
[1:19:33] we're just talking about what the truth
[1:19:34] is they don't know they don't know what
[1:19:37] position they're taking then they all
[1:19:39] these and the person put in there about
[1:19:41] these floral patterns and these bright
[1:19:44] feminist colors I remember um we're g to
[1:19:48] REM have a memorial for my brother Jay
[1:19:50] but his son Little James I remember he
[1:19:53] came out of school one day he was living
[1:19:55] with us and he just came to me and he
[1:19:58] says Uncle Israel it's okay for for me
[1:20:01] to like pink it's okay I'm like who T
[1:20:05] told you that well we're learning that
[1:20:07] that's what they're pumping that in our
[1:20:09] kids it's okay for them to like pink so
[1:20:13] I mean pink is a color yes it's a
[1:20:15] beautiful color they it's in nature it's
[1:20:17] for God but I mean what was that I mean
[1:20:21] stop
[1:20:24] and so they're trying to push this on
[1:20:27] the kids okay the boys and the girls no
[1:20:31] no no don't say boys and girls let's
[1:20:32] blend them all together let's make them
[1:20:35] all you know they're all the same this
[1:20:37] job is you know job for men job for
[1:20:40] women no you're discriminating when you
[1:20:41] said it's job for human anybody can do
[1:20:43] the same job well we know that ain't
[1:20:46] true can't all do the same
[1:20:49] job no but this age has told us that
[1:20:52] even I get some little Flex back right
[1:20:54] now now I can feel it I want to get into
[1:20:57] that don't talk about that but 20 30
[1:20:59] years ago wouldn't have a problem
[1:21:01] talking about it because the age out
[1:21:04] there is trying to water us down and
[1:21:08] feminize our young boys like little
[1:21:15] girls and it goes right into correct you
[1:21:17] can't even correct them no more you
[1:21:19] can't say no to nobody you can't tell
[1:21:23] them you were wrong or you
[1:21:30] lost no you can be whatever you want to
[1:21:32] be no you're not going to be Michael
[1:21:33] Jordan you can't jump you can't run you
[1:21:37] need to go read the books you can't
[1:21:39] you're not gonna be you can't be
[1:21:41] everything you want to be that's a lie
[1:21:42] it's not even true the world is gonna
[1:21:45] eat you up thinking
[1:21:49] that and so you know
[1:21:52] this whoever wrote that you didn't want
[1:21:54] me to say all that but let's
[1:21:56] see but they were talking about
[1:22:00] these feminine affecting do you see it
[1:22:03] affecting the church today absolutely is
[1:22:06] it something that we should be aware of
[1:22:08] and teach against to our children
[1:22:12] absolutely absolutely just wear blue
[1:22:15] young
[1:22:18] man or some shade of of it and I'm not
[1:22:22] trying to be funny but they they they've
[1:22:24] messed it up and the F folks that want
[1:22:26] to get mad or Flex against it don't get
[1:22:28] mad at me that's what they're doing out
[1:22:29] there we're preaching against it God
[1:22:32] help us
[1:22:33] amen and so we want to just stay with
[1:22:37] the word God bless you and so I think as
[1:22:42] a men just like our sisters should be
[1:22:45] conscious of how they dress our brothers
[1:22:47] should be conscious that designer for
[1:22:50] the woman Satan is still a designer for
[1:22:52] our men and they want to come up here
[1:22:55] and then and then just look or come into
[1:22:58] the church looking any kind of way the
[1:23:00] worldly haircuts and the the flame and
[1:23:04] the flamboyant bright colors like we're
[1:23:06] just in some kind of show or something
[1:23:08] think we have to be very careful of that
[1:23:11] aware of that I had a nice tie and shirt
[1:23:14] that would that went together or tie and
[1:23:17] little square that went together it was
[1:23:19] red but it had a shine to it so it kind
[1:23:21] of looked kind of red and a brother here
[1:23:23] in this church this was years ago
[1:23:25] but he's sitting here tonight one of our
[1:23:26] elders he said is that TI pink brother
[1:23:29] Israel I was like no it's not pink no of
[1:23:32] course not look at it well if I got to
[1:23:35] tell you it ain't
[1:23:38] pink whatever I got plenty other ties to
[1:23:40] wear I have to wear that one I still got
[1:23:43] it because it's a sharp tie but but the
[1:23:48] brother brought that up and I was like
[1:23:50] uh yeah maybe maybe not so God bless you
