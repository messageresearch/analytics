[28:06] for the Holy Spirit to come down, Lord.
[28:09] Minister to our needs, Lord, a move of
[28:12] the Holy Ghost one more time, Lord, upon
[28:16] our souls. Give us exactly what we have
[28:19] need of. We pray, Lord. We surrender our
[28:22] lives to you and we claim the blood
[28:26] tonight.
[28:27] Cover us, Lord Jesus,
[28:30] that your judgment won't strike us, but
[28:32] your mercy, your grace, and your love
[28:37] would touch us one more time, Lord. Oh
[28:40] God, we commit ourselves to you, Lord.
[28:43] May you take full control of the
[28:45] furtherment of this service. We ask in
[28:48] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. So, the Lord
[28:52] bless each of you. So happy to be in the
[28:53] house of the Lord with you. Like to
[28:55] welcome our visitors and all of the
[28:59] saints of God. Amen. So happy to have
[29:01] you here with us tonight at Tucant
[29:04] Tabernacle. Some of those folks are
[29:06] here. They're doing some remodeling and
[29:08] so I say keep on remodeling.
[29:12] We enjoy their fellowship. Amen. So
[29:15] praise the Lord. God bless you. We like
[29:17] to go. This is our Wednesday night
[29:19] prayer meeting. But we'd like to go into
[29:21] the scriptures in James chapter 5 for a
[29:24] moment.
[29:26] We'll take one Old Testament scripture,
[29:29] Genesis 14:14.
[29:55] The scripture says,
[29:58] speaking of prayer, let's take verse 15.
[30:01] James 5:15, "And the prayer of faith
[30:05] shall save the sick, and the Lord shall
[30:07] raise him up.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; And if you have committed sins, they
[30:11] shall be forgiven him. Confess your
[30:14] faults one to another, and pray one for
[30:17] another, that ye may be healed.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; The effectual fervent prayer of a
[30:23] righteous man avaleth much. Elias was a
[30:27] man subject to like passions as we are,
[30:30] and he prayed earnestly that it might
[30:32] not rain, and it rained not on the earth
[30:36] by the space of three years and six
[30:39] months. And he prayed again, and the
[30:42] heaven gave rain, and the earth brought
[30:44] forth her fruit. Amen. We'll take one
[30:48] more scripture in Genesis 14.
[30:56] We read this the last couple of
[30:58] services, I think, but I just want to
[31:00] read it again. And when Abram,
[31:04] Genesis 14:14, heard that his brother
[31:07] was taken captive, he armed his trained
[31:11] servants, born in his own house, 318,
[31:15] and pursued them unto Dan. And he
[31:19] divided himself against them, he and his
[31:21] servants by night, and smote them, and
[31:24] pursued them unto Hoba,
[31:27] which is on the left hand of Damascus.
[31:32] And he brought back all the goods, and
[31:35] also brought again his brother Lot, and
[31:39] his goods, and the women also, and the
[31:42] people.
[31:44] Amen. Uh just for a title tonight, pray
[31:47] one for another is that title. Little
[31:50] prayer meeting. Pray one for
[31:54] another. God bless. You may be seated.
[31:58] This little uh subject of prayer
[32:02] is
[32:04] something that the Christian has to do
[32:07] and develop. To be a real good
[32:09] Christian, you got to learn how to pray.
[32:12] And it's something you develop. It's not
[32:15] something you do once or twice. It's a
[32:18] spirit you get into.
[32:21] And how many of us can say that prayer
[32:24] changes things.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; We know God has his will, his perfect
[32:29] will. And by the way, I didn't comment
[32:30] on brother George's ser sermon on
[32:33] Sunday, but he did an excellent job.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; I really really enjoyed that. It was a
[32:38] blessing. I didn't uh but he was talking
[32:41] about the will of God and how God has a
[32:43] will and there's a perfect will and a
[32:45] permissive will and we know that
[32:48] everything God already knows but he has
[32:52] put it into man's hands to pray one for
[32:56] another.
[32:58] Now this scripture in James chapter 5:e
[33:01] 16 says that the effectual fervent
[33:05] prayer of a righteous man avaleth much.
[33:09] I like it says confess your faults one
[33:13] to another. Pray one for another that ye
[33:17] may be healed. Is that right?
[33:20] &gt;&gt; And then the effectual fervent prayer of
[33:23] a righteous man avaleth much. And then
[33:26] the scripture goes to say that Elias was
[33:29] a man subject to passions like we are.
[33:33] So he's bringing down that he had his
[33:35] ups and downs just like we do. And so a
[33:39] righteous man, brother Vanom tells us
[33:41] what a righteous man is.
[33:44] And in the message God's provided way or
[33:48] we'll take yeah God's provided way 1953
[33:53] he says this quotes the scripture. He
[33:55] says, "The prayer of faith shall save
[33:57] the sick." And he said, "The effectual
[33:59] fervent prayer of a righteous man." Now,
[34:02] a righteous man is not a sinless man.
[34:06] For you notice, he said Elijah was a man
[34:09] subject to like passions as we are. He
[34:13] had his ups and downs and his
[34:16] differences.
[34:18] And the scripture of his life proves
[34:20] that he had his ups and downs like we
[34:24] do. And he had his times of wondering
[34:28] and his times that his temper got away
[34:30] from him.
[34:32] And he had a lot of things there that
[34:34] went wrong.
[34:37] But he was still a righteous man because
[34:41] he confessed his unworthiness and
[34:44] believed in God. So that's what made him
[34:48] righteous.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; How many of you have your up and downs?
[34:53] How many ever How many ever lost it?
[34:56] Lost your cool cuz everybody's cool,
[34:59] right? Until you lose your cool.
[35:03] And Elijah was like that. He was that
[35:05] kind of a man. And the scriptures tell
[35:08] us that the Lord heard his prayer and
[35:11] that this effectual fervent prayer
[35:16] uh that fervent prayer means uh an
[35:19] active prayer an efficient prayer a
[35:22] prayer put forth in power
[35:25] uh it's showing something that's working
[35:28] and the Greek word there breaks that
[35:30] down the effectual fervent prayer.
[35:33] Brother Bham continues in believing God
[35:35] 1952 and he says this
[35:38] paragraph 107. So therefore that's the
[35:41] reason said that the prayer of faith
[35:43] shall save the sick. An individual's
[35:46] prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a
[35:49] righteous man avaleth much. Oh, if you
[35:53] only knew that in your hand, Christ gave
[35:56] us the authority with his name by being
[36:00] Christians, the most powerful weapon the
[36:03] world has ever known.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Prayer, it even changes everything.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; It'll change the mind of God.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; It did do it. After death was pronounced
[36:16] to a man, he prayed. God told the
[36:18] prophet go back and tell him I heard
[36:21] him. See there prayer. Hold on.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; In early spiritual experiences the
[36:28] prophet says this. Oh God you said the
[36:30] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[36:32] man. And I know that a righteous man is
[36:35] not righteous in himself.
[36:39] But in trusting in the grace of Jesus
[36:41] Christ, I asked you to be merciful to
[36:44] her. And I said, "God, no more can I do,
[36:48] but I commit her to you." Now, that was
[36:50] a prayer brother was praying in Get the
[36:53] People to Believe, 1952, he continues.
[36:56] He says, "Confess your faults one to
[36:58] another, and pray one for the other
[37:02] &gt;&gt; that you may be healed."
[37:06] &gt;&gt; The effectual fervent prayer of a
[37:08] righteous man avaleth much. The
[37:11] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[37:13] man. Now a righteous man is not a
[37:16] sinless man. See a righteous man is a
[37:20] man who is confessing his sins in a
[37:25] righteous one.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; You see? See a righteous man. Now watch
[37:30] to prove it the next verse. And brother
[37:32] Vam continues on. God's provided way. He
[37:36] says this quoting this scripture again.
[37:38] Prayer of faith shall save the sick. The
[37:41] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[37:42] man. Now a righteous man is not a
[37:44] sinless man. For you notice he said
[37:46] Elijah was a man subject to like
[37:48] passions as we are. He had his ups and
[37:52] downs, his differences. And the
[37:54] scriptures of his life prove that he had
[37:56] his ups and down. We read that one
[37:58] already, but we can say amen again.
[38:01] Downs like we do. And he had his times
[38:03] of wondering and his times that his
[38:06] temper got away from him and a lot of
[38:09] things there that went wrong. But he was
[38:12] still a righteous man because he
[38:15] confessed his unworthiness
[38:18] and believed in God. It's when it's when
[38:21] we try to justify ourselves,
[38:23] &gt;&gt; that's when we get in trouble. None of
[38:25] us are just. None of us are righteous.
[38:27] None of us have a a valid excuse
[38:30] &gt;&gt; for our bad behavior.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; But are you righteous?
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Are you righteous?
[38:39] You're not righteous in yourself. You're
[38:41] not righteous in your race or your
[38:43] nation.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; You're not righteous because of the
[38:46] church you go to or what you believe.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; You're righteous because you're
[38:51] confessing in somebody that is
[38:53] righteous.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; And that's what makes you a righteous
[38:56] man. Now, when that righteous man begins
[39:00] to pray,
[39:02] &gt;&gt; now something's going to happen. Now,
[39:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a regular man. And
[39:07] I'm not talking about an unbelieving
[39:08] man. I'm not talking about uh
[39:11] disgruntled man or woman. I'm talking
[39:13] about a righteous man. And who is a
[39:15] righteous man?
[39:17] &gt;&gt; We just read it for you. Are there any
[39:20] righteous in here?
[39:22] &gt;&gt; If the righteous scarcely be saved,
[39:26] what's going to happen to the ungodly?
[39:29] There are some righteous people on the
[39:31] earth.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; And I thank God I'm friends with many of
[39:34] them. And if one of my righteous friends
[39:38] pray for me, I'm blessed.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's all I want. That's all I need
[39:45] is somebody righteous to pray for me
[39:48] because the Bible said the effectual
[39:52] fervent prayer, not just any man. Now, a
[39:56] righteous man availth much.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; That's the Bible. That's the message.
[40:03] Now the prophet of God continues here
[40:06] one more on this in the prayer line 1954
[40:10] he says this here and you said the
[40:12] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[40:14] man abelleth much and a man righteous is
[40:18] not sinless it's one who confesses his
[40:21] sins his he's righteous through the one
[40:24] he confesses through and I your servant
[40:28] confess my sins through Jesus thy son
[40:32] isn't That beautiful.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; I love that. That applies that scripture
[40:36] because, you know, we can look at that
[40:38] scripture and say, "Well, I'm not
[40:39] righteous. I made a mistake today. I was
[40:42] righteous last week, but not this week.
[40:44] I'll be righteous tomorrow, but I'm a
[40:47] little upset right now." No, no, no.
[40:49] That's not how Christianity works. If
[40:52] you're righteous, it's because you
[40:53] confessed in a righteous one.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; And if you're a Christian, you're a
[40:57] Christian today. And guess what? You'll
[40:59] be tomorrow.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; A Christian. And what about a hundred
[41:02] years from today?
[41:04] &gt;&gt; It's none of none of this. I'm a
[41:06] believer today, but no, I'm not a
[41:08] believer. You either are or you're not.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; And if you are, you're a Christian
[41:13] because you have confessed in a
[41:15] righteous one. Now, when that righteous
[41:17] man begins to pray,
[41:20] &gt;&gt; something begins to happen. Now,
[41:23] &gt;&gt; so we're just not we, you know, we we
[41:26] used to work out in sports. I played
[41:28] football and we had this one drill that
[41:31] we would um we're supposed to lay down
[41:34] on our back and press our backside into
[41:38] the pavement or the or the ground to
[41:40] strengthen our core, our muscles, right?
[41:43] It's one of those exercises that you can
[41:46] look like you're doing it, but you're
[41:47] not really doing it.
[41:50] It was a rest point. It's like it really
[41:52] if you did the exercise it would really
[41:54] help you. But with all the running
[41:56] around that was a break time for many of
[41:59] us our friends. We lay down we act like
[42:01] we're pressing our back into the
[42:03] pavement like strengthening our core but
[42:06] we were just resting.
[42:08] And I wonder if some of us pray like
[42:10] that.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Like it's just like a nice quiet moment.
[42:14] Nobody's going to steal my purse.
[42:16] Nobody's going to mess with any of my
[42:18] stuff. I'm in a safe place. I just close
[42:20] my eyes and get a nice quick little nap.
[42:24] That's not prayer.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Prayer is battles.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Prayer is work.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Prayer is unseen victories being won.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Bringing things down, changing things in
[42:39] the atmosphere. Prayer changes things.
[42:44] And when a man or a woman, I don't care
[42:46] if he's a preacher, newcomer, oldtimer,
[42:49] when a believer gets down on their knees
[42:52] to pray, something is going to happen.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Something begins to move.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Something's got to take place.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; So, you see these saints pull over and
[43:05] they roll down. to go down on their
[43:07] their seat there or they maybe they're
[43:09] here at the altar and you know we have
[43:11] this it's quiet and it looks quiet. It
[43:14] looks innocent. No, there's something
[43:16] violent taking place.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; It's kingdoms of darkness being
[43:22] challenged.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; It's soldiers being made.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; It's real believers being equipped
[43:30] &gt;&gt; with prayer.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:35] We can sing too much. We can preach too
[43:37] much. We can talk too much. But we can
[43:39] never pray too much.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Prayer, the great weapon that God placed
[43:44] in our hands. Now the prophet says this
[43:46] here in the message, the token 1963,
[43:51] hold the token over your unmovable faith
[43:54] in his promise.
[43:56] Watch him go. The effectual fervent
[44:00] prayer of a righteous man avaleth much.
[44:03] See, see, take that token. That's what
[44:09] it's for. Satan is there to tempt you.
[44:13] So, when we go in prayer, we take that
[44:15] token with us and that effectual prayer
[44:18] of a righteous man. And a righteous man
[44:20] is the man that's confessing in a
[44:22] righteous one. When that man begins to
[44:25] pray with the token, something's got to
[44:28] take place. He says in desperations. We
[44:31] find out in James 5:15 that the Bible
[44:33] said the effectual fervent, that's
[44:36] desperations.
[44:38] Effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[44:40] man avaleth much. When a righteous man,
[44:43] a good man gets in travail
[44:47] or soul travel or travail, either one. I
[44:50] think travel is a better word. Travail
[44:53] or travel. Either which one you want to
[44:55] call it. But when a soul gets in
[44:58] desperation and travailing an effectual
[45:01] fervent prayer of a man that can show
[45:03] the token, it does something.
[45:08] Look at this praying one for another.
[45:10] You know this Old Testament scripture,
[45:14] I've been reading it the last couple of
[45:17] services where Abraham Abram hears that
[45:21] his brother Lot had been taken. And the
[45:25] Bible says that he took his trained
[45:29] servants
[45:32] and armed them, 318 of them. And these
[45:37] were servants that were born in his
[45:39] house,
[45:41] 318,
[45:43] and pursued them unto Dan. And I like
[45:45] the scripture. I believe every word,
[45:48] every scripture has the details in there
[45:50] if you'll just slow down and read it.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:54] And sometimes we read it already, but
[45:56] that's that's the problem many times.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; You need to read it again. And actually,
[46:01] you need to read it for the rest of your
[46:03] life.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; All of the scriptures.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; And reading it over and over again
[46:10] doesn't diminish the power. To me, it
[46:13] increases the power
[46:16] &gt;&gt; because God is now witnessing that word
[46:19] to you. And I like that he took his
[46:21] trained servant. Did this take any
[46:23] servant? How were these people trained?
[46:26] What were they trained in?
[46:28] You know, he heard that his brother had
[46:30] been taken. The Bible didn't say he went
[46:33] and trained some soldiers and then went
[46:35] to go help lot. No, he went and got his
[46:37] servants that were already trained, the
[46:39] one that were born in his house, and
[46:42] gives the number 318 and gives the
[46:45] distance where he went to pursue them.
[46:48] Now, in the map, if you take where Dan
[46:50] was and where Abraham was, there's a
[46:54] distance there of about 140 miles or so.
[47:00] And then from Dan to Hoba was another 60
[47:03] or 70 miles. This is 20 and something
[47:06] miles just looking at the map of him
[47:09] traveling to deliver his brother when he
[47:13] heard that he had been taken.
[47:16] Now, brother Bham tells us that Abraham
[47:18] was just a farmer.
[47:21] He says they were not fighters. They not
[47:24] they were not warriors.
[47:26] And so he he was just a an ordinary
[47:31] uh they they were just fighters out
[47:33] there, but they had to be able to
[47:35] protect themselves.
[47:37] And the scripture, the prophet says in
[47:40] possessing all things, he says this
[47:42] about Abraham. He stayed on that
[47:44] foundation promised word. He not an
[47:47] heir. He was heir. So he noted it. All
[47:49] right. After the promise had been
[47:52] vindicated to him, he had fellowship
[47:54] then with the promiser. I like that.
[47:56] After God made the promise, then Abraham
[47:59] had never had a test before. So he that
[48:03] kind. So he knowed it all belonged to
[48:05] him. And that was the promise. Yet yet
[48:08] he never had to fight an army. He didn't
[48:11] know nothing about it. He wasn't a
[48:14] trained man to fight. Abraham wasn't a
[48:17] fighter. He was a farmer. And Abraham
[48:20] could not do anything because he wasn't
[48:23] a soldier. His men wasn't soldiers. They
[48:26] were farmers. So the only thing he could
[48:28] do was just take God's promise. Put his
[48:32] faith upon the promise and move out and
[48:35] go after it. Then when Abraham seen that
[48:38] and got the promise and found out that
[48:41] God vindicated to him that he does keep
[48:45] his promise. Amen. There it is.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; And so we've been teaching here and
[48:51] preaching here about training men and
[48:54] how you're trained and but the training
[48:56] is not men training you. You're being
[49:00] trained by the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; And the scripture tells us in Galatians
[49:06] 6:1 that if a brother be overtaken in a
[49:11] fault, what are you supposed to do?
[49:16] Galatians 6,
[49:19] we'll find it here quickly.
[49:33] If a brother, brethren, if a man be
[49:36] overtaken in the fault, ye which are
[49:38] spiritual, do what?
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Restore such a one in the spirit of
[49:45] meekness, considering thyself, lest thou
[49:49] also be tempted.
[49:52] Brother Ban says that Abraham was
[49:54] displaying or exercising
[49:58] in type the spirit of Christ when he
[50:00] went after a lot.
[50:02] Now this was not for any money.
[50:06] This was not to show off his skills and
[50:09] ability to fight. This was not Abraham
[50:13] looking for something to get into. He
[50:17] heard that his brother had been taken.
[50:22] So he goes to his men that were already
[50:25] trained and he arms them. 318 of them
[50:30] and they pursued after. Now when you
[50:33] read the scripture, you'll see that
[50:34] these there was three kings or five
[50:37] kings, I can't remember. three kings or
[50:39] four kings that had come together and
[50:42] they were taking each of these little
[50:44] towns and they traveled from the north
[50:47] coming south taking towns. Shelder was
[50:50] one of them and two or three other kings
[50:53] and they were just swooping up and
[50:55] capturing and taking and then they took
[50:58] Sodom
[51:00] and they captured Lot.
[51:03] These was a train outfit. These were
[51:06] real soldiers that knew how to take over
[51:09] and fight. They did it before and they
[51:12] were undefeated.
[51:14] They were undefeated
[51:17] until they took Lot.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; When they took Lot, they took something.
[51:24] The Bible says that one escaped out of
[51:27] there and ran and came and told Abram
[51:31] that your backsliding nephew,
[51:34] the one that gets on your nerves,
[51:37] the one that you got into it, your men
[51:39] and your men got into it. Y'all had to
[51:41] ser him. What's wrong, man? He's all
[51:45] messed up.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; He's in a He's in a spot where he can't
[51:50] even pray for himself.
[51:53] He can't help himself. And when Abraham
[51:56] heard this, he didn't do what some of us
[51:59] do. We say that's what he gets.
[52:03] He deserves that. But no, that's not
[52:05] what Abraham. Abraham trained his men,
[52:10] put his life on the line,
[52:13] pursued them to Dan,
[52:15] &gt;&gt; and then at night time he launched a
[52:18] night attack
[52:21] &gt;&gt; upon soldiers.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; The middle of the night, Bible says he
[52:26] divided himself.
[52:29] Say, you go that way, you go that way,
[52:31] you take the front, I'll take the back.
[52:33] You know, strategy.
[52:36] What we fighting for? The gold? No, no
[52:39] gold in this. Well, we going to take
[52:40] some property. No, we ain't getting no
[52:42] property. We We're going to put our name
[52:44] in the lights. No, no medals after this
[52:45] battle.
[52:47] It won't be no all stars in this battle.
[52:51] Won't be no shining names or new
[52:53] positions in this battle. What are we
[52:56] battling for? I'm praying for my
[52:59] brother.
[53:01] I'm going after Lot.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going after Lot.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; I got to go get him. And so he goes
[53:09] after him,
[53:11] pursues them
[53:14] 200 and something miles.
[53:20] What kind of car was he driving?
[53:26] It wasn't a Honda Accord.
[53:29] It wasn't a fine vehicle to drive, but
[53:32] he
[53:34] traveled those miles to go get his
[53:36] brother. And this is how we get our
[53:39] brothers. We get them by praying for
[53:42] them.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Is there a better way?
[53:47] You think you can shame them to come to
[53:49] church?
[53:51] You think you can shame them or shun
[53:54] them to make them understand that you're
[53:56] right and they're wrong?
[54:00] You think getting into it with them and
[54:03] fussing with your family and going back
[54:06] and forth in these heated conversation,
[54:09] you think that's the way to do it? No.
[54:13] But prayer is undefeated.
[54:18] Prayer works and it works all the time.
[54:22] And prayer isn't just sitting down
[54:24] talking, mumbling a few things. Prayer
[54:27] is moving things.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Prayer is powerful.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Prayer. Prayer is stronger than the
[54:37] greatest fighter you can think of.
[54:41] going to these gyms here and these
[54:43] massively built individuals that are
[54:46] healthy and their muscles are big and
[54:49] they're they're a specimen of strength.
[54:52] You go to the Olympics, you see who the
[54:54] fastest human beings are, the most
[54:57] qualified, the most skilled, but really
[55:00] the strongest people are people that
[55:03] know how to pray.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; The strongest churches are the churches
[55:08] ain't the biggest churches. is the
[55:10] churches that know how to pray. The most
[55:13] powerful ministries,
[55:15] song worship leaders, deacons, trustees,
[55:19] or any member in any position, the best,
[55:23] the strongest ones are the prayer
[55:25] warriors.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; We call them prayer warriors because
[55:30] they fight a fight down on their knees.
[55:34] Amen.
[55:36] Now, when you pray for someone, I like
[55:39] that in James 5:16. Where am I at? Two
[55:42] more minutes. James 5, somebody said,
[55:44] "Take my time."
[55:47] James 5:16 says, "The effectual fervent
[55:49] prayer of a righteous man avaleth one
[55:52] much." And it says, "Pray one for
[55:54] another that what?
[55:57] Ye may be healed." There's something
[56:02] takes place when you pray for someone.
[56:06] Look at this quotation here. What the
[56:08] prophet says in questions and answers,
[56:10] paragraph 251. Now, we're all going to
[56:12] make mistakes. Just remember, and when
[56:15] you're looking at one another, don't
[56:17] look at the other person's mistake. See,
[56:20] don't do that because remember, you make
[56:23] mistakes, too. But look to Christ who is
[56:26] guiding this person. And if they need
[56:29] some help, then you pray for them.
[56:32] That's the way we get along. See, pray.
[56:35] And remember, when you are praying for
[56:38] somebody else, in that kind of a fix,
[56:41] God will honor and heal you when you're
[56:45] praying for somebody else. That's right.
[56:48] That's what Christianity is based upon.
[56:52] to help one another, do for one another,
[56:55] be kind to one another, understanding to
[56:58] one another. Now, if you see your
[57:00] neighbor's mistake, you see where they
[57:02] went wrong, don't go wrong with them,
[57:04] but just pray for them. Just keep
[57:06] praying and God will understand that
[57:09] he'll make everything right.
[57:13] In the message, Who is Jesus? 1964,
[57:18] brother Brandham says this.
[57:22] You see, when you go to praying for
[57:24] somebody,
[57:25] something goes to taking place.
[57:28] There is where we fail, friends. Not
[57:32] praying.
[57:33] Prayer is the key note. Ask and you
[57:36] shall receive. You have not because you
[57:38] ask not. You ask not because you believe
[57:41] not. Ask in abundance that your joy may
[57:43] be full. Ask and believe that you
[57:46] receive what you've asked for, then hold
[57:49] on to it. Don't leave it. If it's a
[57:52] promise in the Bible,
[57:54] if and it's been revealed to you that
[57:56] God is going to give it to you, hold to
[57:59] it.
[58:01] Now, this is what we want to do tonight.
[58:05] We want to pray one for another. Is that
[58:08] right?
[58:09] Because our prayers make a difference.
[58:12] Do you believe that?
[58:14] You have to believe that saints,
[58:18] you must believe that your prayer makes
[58:20] a difference. Many times the prayer
[58:23] request will come into an assembly and
[58:26] then we'll read that prayer request and
[58:27] we say, "Well, the pastor is going to
[58:29] pray and this brother's praying and that
[58:31] brother's praying." Well, the request
[58:32] was for the body of Christ to pray
[58:37] and your prayer is needed.
[58:41] The effectual fervent prayer of a
[58:42] righteous man or woman avaleth much.
[58:47] And so God allows us to pray this
[58:49] prayer. This effectual prayer is a
[58:53] prayer in desperations.
[58:56] Desperations is something you can't make
[58:59] yourself. But you can ask God to make
[59:01] you desperate.
[59:03] When the word of the Lord comes your
[59:04] way, that can make you desperate. The
[59:06] prophet of God says that even this age
[59:09] and all that has happened should throw
[59:12] us all into desperation.
[59:15] When we look at the age, we look at the
[59:16] time, we look at the hour that we're
[59:18] living in. If we're not desperate, I
[59:20] think something is probably wrong with
[59:22] us. I think if there ever was a time
[59:27] that the oldfashioned prayer meeting
[59:30] should the churches should be filled,
[59:33] that should be a time that those
[59:36] churches should be filled. Is it the
[59:39] oldfashioned
[59:41] prayer meeting?
[59:43] Because God uses that
[59:47] to accomplish his will. And Abraham did
[59:52] just that. He traveled from Hebrin to
[59:56] Dan and Dan to Hoba. And he was doing
[59:59] all this for the principle
[1:00:03] of saving his brother.
[1:00:06] He wasn't doing that for money.
[1:00:08] He wasn't doing that even for what some
[1:00:12] of us would do our good deeds for. You
[1:00:15] know, some of us if we did enough good
[1:00:17] deeds and no one told you thank you, you
[1:00:20] probably feel a little sideways,
[1:00:23] feel a little shafted or something.
[1:00:26] But really, Abraham, he did what he did.
[1:00:30] He put his resources on the line,
[1:00:34] 200 miles traveling on foot or however
[1:00:36] they traveled with 318 men. You have to
[1:00:39] account for water, food, and the care
[1:00:41] and the strategy of fighting. and the
[1:00:44] land is not yours. You you're working in
[1:00:47] the night. You got to come up with a
[1:00:49] plan. This wasn't a just a this was a
[1:00:52] this is a real deal. This was a task,
[1:00:55] but he did it. And what was he doing? He
[1:00:57] was displaying the attributes of Christ.
[1:01:03] And when he did that, coming back from
[1:01:06] that battle, the Bible says he met a
[1:01:09] king.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; And who was this king?
[1:01:14] He was a king that didn't have a father
[1:01:17] or a mother.
[1:01:19] You see, you can't beat God giving.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; And all of the sacrifices that you make,
[1:01:27] he sees every one of them. And there's a
[1:01:31] prize
[1:01:33] to be gained when you put your life on
[1:01:37] the line for somebody else.
[1:01:40] I mean, you're going out of your way to
[1:01:42] help somebody who's not worthy of your
[1:01:45] help. Think of it.
[1:01:49] That's Christianity.
[1:01:51] Not scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
[1:01:53] No. No. You is trying to poke me in the
[1:01:56] back,
[1:01:58] but yet I'm going to pray for you.
[1:02:00] That's Christianity. You can't do that
[1:02:03] without a prayer life.
[1:02:05] Easier said than done, right? Can't do
[1:02:08] without a prayer life. The spirit of
[1:02:09] Christ has to be in you. What we going
[1:02:12] where? What we going to do? Abraham, we
[1:02:14] got to go get Lot. Lot who? My nephew
[1:02:18] Lot. We just got into it with Lot. He
[1:02:20] did his all day. He made his bed. He got
[1:02:22] to live in it. He made his decision.
[1:02:25] He He was wrong. He needs to come see
[1:02:27] you and apologize.
[1:02:30] Well, he can't apologize. He can't come
[1:02:32] see me. The boy's locked up. Let's go
[1:02:36] get him.
[1:02:37] Let's go get him. Come on. Now, now the
[1:02:42] Bible makes this detail and I love it.
[1:02:44] He says he takes his servants, brother
[1:02:46] John, that were trained, that were born
[1:02:49] in his house.
[1:02:54] This wasn't procelites.
[1:02:56] These wasn't outsiders with their own
[1:02:58] agenda. These are people that knew the
[1:03:01] master of the house. They were born
[1:03:03] here. They were raised here. And they
[1:03:06] had to know that this is just Abraham.
[1:03:09] This is how he does things. And they go
[1:03:12] after Lot. And they pursue him. Hard
[1:03:16] travel
[1:03:17] 200 and something miles a journey.
[1:03:21] Pursue them. Get them in Dan and fight
[1:03:23] them. And he not only fight them, then
[1:03:25] he pursues them. Dan is northern. and
[1:03:27] you you you pursue them all the way out
[1:03:30] of, you know, ran them off
[1:03:33] and come back and they want to give
[1:03:35] Abraham something. You say like, "No,
[1:03:37] just feed my men. This isn't about me. I
[1:03:41] don't need to be recognized. I did this
[1:03:43] because my brother needed it. That's
[1:03:46] what it that's why I did it. I did it
[1:03:48] because it needed to be done.
[1:03:51] It was the principle of it." And on his
[1:03:54] way back he met a king,
[1:03:57] King Melzdc,
[1:04:00] who blessed him
[1:04:03] abundantly.
[1:04:05] Gave him more than he'd ever would have.
[1:04:09] Cup running over.
[1:04:11] Lord, bless me like that.
[1:04:14] Bless me with an anointing to go after
[1:04:16] my brother,
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; to go after my sister when they won't
[1:04:21] pray for themselves, but I will pray for
[1:04:23] them.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Where they should be here, but they're
[1:04:26] not. But I'm here representing the ones
[1:04:29] that should be here. I'm calling on
[1:04:32] their name, Lord, like Abraham did.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; 200 miles. I wonder if we can give 20
[1:04:39] minutes.
[1:04:41] 200 miles. I wonder if we can go an hour
[1:04:44] in prayer. Is an hour too long to pray?
[1:04:47] Well, we had a prayer meeting for a
[1:04:49] two-hour prayer meeting.
[1:04:51] Oh my. We have a two-hour dinner, two
[1:04:54] hour potluck or banquet, a twohour
[1:04:58] singing, a two-hour whatever. Two-hour
[1:05:00] prayer meeting. Who's going to be there?
[1:05:03] Huh? Roll up them sleeves. Son,
[1:05:07] roll them sleeves up.
[1:05:10] Take them slippers off and put some
[1:05:12] boots on. We're going to battle. I don't
[1:05:15] know how long we gonna be gone. We gonna
[1:05:17] be gone, but we're gonna go conquer
[1:05:19] something.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Why? What's the prize? It's the
[1:05:22] principle
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; that matters. Lord, help us.
[1:05:28] Now, God allows us to do this
[1:05:33] and many times he uses tension.
[1:05:37] And I'm going to close right here. All
[1:05:38] right.
[1:05:40] Was that my first 30 minutes?
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; I'm still on.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Oh man, I have plenty of time.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Why y'all rushing me?
[1:05:50] God bless you. Let me close here. But
[1:05:53] tension.
[1:05:55] How many's under some kind of attention
[1:05:57] right now? Stress,
[1:06:00] heavy.
[1:06:02] And you think it's
[1:06:04] sister, her brother. He's heavy. She's
[1:06:06] heavy.
[1:06:08] You heavy. We all heavy
[1:06:13] stress. My stress just goes up every
[1:06:15] time I see you.
[1:06:18] Not you. I mean, people say that, you
[1:06:20] know. Yeah. You make my stress. I I just
[1:06:23] I don't know. Tension. You know, God
[1:06:26] allows tension
[1:06:28] for a purpose.
[1:06:30] And as a believer, when we understand
[1:06:32] that, then we use that as a key and stop
[1:06:37] complaining about it. But it allows us
[1:06:39] to move into that desperation
[1:06:43] that helps equip this scripture with the
[1:06:46] effectual fervent.
[1:06:48] Okay? So, it's not just a prayer, but
[1:06:50] the effectual fervent prayer of a right.
[1:06:53] We already identify what a righteous man
[1:06:55] is. You already know what prayer is. But
[1:06:58] what's the effectual fervent? That's a
[1:07:00] prayer under desperation. That's where
[1:07:02] the tension comes in. And let me bring
[1:07:03] that to you here just now. Brother
[1:07:05] Brandham says this in the message
[1:07:07] uniting time and sign
[1:07:09] 1963.
[1:07:14] You know what? Can we play that sis?
[1:07:17] Paragraph uniting time 1963
[1:07:21] uh 8:18 paragraph 15 through 19. Let's
[1:07:25] let the prophet say. I don't know how
[1:07:26] long it going to take, but I don't think
[1:07:28] it's that that long. Take time to load.
[1:07:31] You got it. Thank you. Let's play it.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Speaking of tension, I was praying about
[1:07:36] this morning. What would you do if you
[1:07:38] didn't have tension?
[1:07:40] Just think of it. Tension is part of
[1:07:42] living.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That kind of encouraged me when I
[1:07:45] thought that if you had no tension,
[1:07:47] you'd be like a rag doll. You wouldn't
[1:07:48] have no feelings. There'd be nothing you
[1:07:50] could work on. Like a husband and wife.
[1:07:53] Maybe she wants to do something and
[1:07:55] they're trying to work together.
[1:07:56] Especially Christians and the other want
[1:07:58] and then when you come together to you
[1:08:00] find out what she done she found out.
[1:08:02] See the tension really brings you closer
[1:08:04] together.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; And somebody tells you that well it said
[1:08:08] just think of the little wife that
[1:08:09] wanted her a lot of attention when he
[1:08:11] wasn't so good or the little husband
[1:08:12] wanted some tension when you wasn't so
[1:08:14] good. Then when it's all forgiven look
[1:08:16] how you feel about it. My you just see
[1:08:19] you got to have tension. That's all. And
[1:08:22] just think of feelings. What if you
[1:08:23] didn't have any feelings? No pain or
[1:08:25] nothing. Well, there'd be no pain at
[1:08:27] all. You'd have no feelings at all. See,
[1:08:30] and if you'd have no feelings, then one
[1:08:32] of your senses would be gone. See? So,
[1:08:34] see, everything's just right. Anyhow, so
[1:08:37] God, just give us grace to stand up to
[1:08:39] it. That's the thing. Just stand up with
[1:08:41] that grace and stand there and say, "We
[1:08:43] know that when this life is over, the
[1:08:45] great ones on the other side where we're
[1:08:47] looking to go to." And now we we
[1:08:50] remember that all these things that
[1:08:52] attention some people tries to introduce
[1:08:55] Christianity as you're free from where
[1:08:58] you're no you're free from tension. Oh
[1:09:00] no you add tension when you become a
[1:09:02] Christian. That's right
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; because you was kind of a flop go happy
[1:09:07] golucky whatever it was out there not
[1:09:09] caring what you did but when you become
[1:09:11] a real Christian every moment you're
[1:09:13] wondering am I pleasing my Lord if I
[1:09:15] could hear from him then what's your own
[1:09:17] intention? put you on guard. That's what
[1:09:19] makes you what you are. So after all,
[1:09:21] tension is a blessing.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; This the way you're looking at it.
[1:09:25] That's the way you're looking at. See,
[1:09:27] if you just look the other side, there's
[1:09:28] another. No matter how thin you slice
[1:09:30] anything, it's still got two sides to
[1:09:32] it. You see? So you want to see both
[1:09:34] sides. So tension. I think, oh my, it's
[1:09:37] what's this tension? If I could have
[1:09:38] been born without this tension. Well, if
[1:09:40] I wouldn't had this tension, I wouldn't
[1:09:41] have been what I am. I wouldn't have
[1:09:43] been a Christian perhaps. It was this
[1:09:44] tension that drove me to Jesus Christ.
[1:09:47] So it's been a blessing thing to me.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can say praise the Lord?
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the tension
[1:09:58] goes right into desperation. And Lord
[1:10:00] help us.
[1:10:01] I just don't want to pray a prayer. I
[1:10:03] want to pray an effectual fervent
[1:10:05] prayer.
[1:10:07] And I'm already confessing in the
[1:10:08] righteous one. And I believe he's going
[1:10:11] to hear my prayer. Amen.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; So let's pray one for another. You pray
[1:10:15] for me, I'll pray for you. We all pray
[1:10:20] for one another. Amen. God, may God
[1:10:23] richly bless you.
[1:10:26] There is a few requests we have here
[1:10:29] tonight that we'd like to take.
[1:10:32] Musicians come. Thank you.
[1:10:36] Thank you.
[1:10:46] This is from Sister Elise. My friend
[1:10:48] Sherry's grandson is suffering with
[1:10:51] radiation and chemo. He needs salvation.
[1:10:55] He is on hospice. 30 years old, two
[1:10:58] little girls and a wife. His name is
[1:11:02] Justin.
[1:11:04] Remember brother continue to pray for
[1:11:07] brother Bobby Wartz. The treat the
[1:11:09] treatment is making him very weak.
[1:11:12] Excuse me. Please keep his family in
[1:11:14] prayer as they support him as well.
[1:11:18] Remember, brother Mike works as well.
[1:11:21] Sister Lori Snow that the Lord will uh
[1:11:24] touch her and deliver her and bring her
[1:11:26] through her treatment and recovery.
[1:11:30] Amen. Is there someone else that has a
[1:11:32] request they'd like to make known
[1:11:34] tonight?
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sis.
[1:11:38] I'm going to be leaving for a few weeks
[1:11:40] to go see my sister Christie, but
[1:11:42] they've run all kinds of tests and she's
[1:11:44] been becoming crippled in her feet and
[1:11:46] can't walk and get out of bed and it's
[1:11:49] going on about three weeks now. She has
[1:11:51] good days and bad days.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Okay, we'll pray for her. Christie. Yes,
[1:12:02] we'll do that. Someone else. Yes,
[1:12:04] brother Chris.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; My brother-in-law
[1:12:17] Brother,
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; brother-in-law Troy Petty, real serious
[1:12:21] request. He's in the hospital. We'll
[1:12:23] pray for him. There's someone else here
[1:12:26] that had a request. But yes, sister
[1:12:44] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's say praise
[1:12:47] the Lord. Thank the Lord for that,
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; sister Martha.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. So,
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; okay. Yeah, we'll pray
[1:13:06] for our dear brother. Um, the Lord will
[1:13:09] touch him and bring him completely. The
[1:13:11] Lord's brought him from a mighty long
[1:13:14] way
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; already.
[1:13:17] I was reading this report where or
[1:13:19] actually brother Brandham says it and um
[1:13:22] that that when Christians are diagnosed
[1:13:26] with diseases that most of the time the
[1:13:29] doctors say that most of the time they
[1:13:31] do much better. They live a lot longer
[1:13:33] because they believe in in the power of
[1:13:37] prayer and that God is going to heal
[1:13:39] them. So their whole atmosphere is
[1:13:42] positive. And then when unbelievers
[1:13:46] get the same diagnosis and then they
[1:13:48] think, "Oh, I'm going down and
[1:13:50] negative," they almost always get worse.
[1:13:53] And so we thank the Lord for where he's
[1:13:55] brought brother Glenn so far and we just
[1:13:58] trust the Lord will take him completely
[1:14:00] through this cancer.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Completely.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sister.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Sarahis
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Sarah. Oh, Sarah Gera. Yes. Brother and
[1:14:14] sister are driving home.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Lao and his wife are driving
[1:14:20] from Idaho for traveling mercies. Amen.
[1:14:23] There's someone else that had a request.
[1:14:25] Remember our meetings coming up. Also,
[1:14:27] we have a men's prayer meeting. Uh men's
[1:14:30] prayer meeting. We've done that a couple
[1:14:31] years in a row since se September the
[1:14:34] 20th. And um the brothers that know
[1:14:39] about that, you're welcome. and you can
[1:14:42] RSVP for that. So, we'll be in prayer.
[1:14:45] Prayer for the prayer meeting. All
[1:14:47] right. And I think that was it. Let's
[1:14:50] all stand. Brother Chris.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:14:57] Yes. We trust the Lord for that. Given
[1:15:00] that procedure,
[1:15:02] Lord will help us and bless each and
[1:15:04] every one of us.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:08] Let's sing one, excuse me, one of those
[1:15:12] songs. You have one. Let's just sing
[1:15:16] that.
[1:15:17] Um, the only real peace that I have,

[1:45:51] Brother John, why don't you come and
[1:45:53] dismiss us in a word of prayer this
[1:45:56] evening. Amen. God bless each of you.
[1:45:59] [Music]
[1:46:04] Lord Jesus, we just want to tell you how
[1:46:06] much we love you tonight.
[1:46:08] I was just thinking to the words of that
[1:46:09] song, what a friend we have in Jesus.
[1:46:12] What a privilege it is to carry all our
[1:46:15] needs to you in prayer. And Lord, you
[1:46:18] know everything that we have need of.
[1:46:19] And you just want to hear us ask you
[1:46:22] that. But Lord, you've provided for
[1:46:23] every need. Every need, you promise
[1:46:25] you'd supply according to your riches.
[1:46:27] And Lord, we just ask you, Lord, forgive
[1:46:29] us for our unbelief. And we just are so
[1:46:32] thankful, Lord, for the encouragement
[1:46:34] tonight, reminding us, Lord, that
[1:46:37] we are righteous people. We're righteous
[1:46:40] men and women, and we have a right to
[1:46:43] take our pro our promises and our our
[1:46:45] our family and whatever it is, Lord,
[1:46:47] that Satan has tried to come and steal
[1:46:49] from us. Lord, we're we're claiming it
[1:46:52] and we're thanking you, Lord, for
[1:46:53] sending your enforcer. And Lord, how we
[1:46:56] just love you and appreciate your
[1:46:57] goodness to us, Lord Jesus.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; We just ask, Lord, as we go, Lord, that
[1:47:04] we would just help us to
[1:47:07] just be something different that people
[1:47:09] see in in us, Lord. It's it can be
[1:47:12] discouraging to to people that don't
[1:47:14] know you. And Lord, as brother Israel
[1:47:16] was talking tonight, those that are
[1:47:18] diagnosed with the sickness, those that
[1:47:20] don't know you and don't have that hope
[1:47:23] to claim on to, but Lord, may they see
[1:47:25] something in us that gives us an
[1:47:26] opportunity to share you with them and
[1:47:29] what you've done in our lives, Lord
[1:47:30] Jesus. And Lord, we just all need more
[1:47:33] of you. And we just ask you, Lord, just
[1:47:35] to help us to die out to ourselves so
[1:47:37] that you can fill us up with more of
[1:47:39] your love and more of your mercy, more
[1:47:42] of your grace that is manifested to
[1:47:44] others. Lord, we thank you for the
[1:47:46] opportunity to come and worship you this
[1:47:47] evening. We just ask Lord that you would
[1:47:51] be with us as we go. Keep us safe on the
[1:47:53] road. How we love you and we ask these
[1:47:55] things in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:47:59] Lord, brother John mentioned that what a
[1:48:02] friend we have in Jesus. Let's sing
[1:48:04] that.
[1:48:06] Oh, what
[1:48:08] a friend we have in Jesus.

[1:48:18] and all
[1:48:21] our sins and griefs to bear.
