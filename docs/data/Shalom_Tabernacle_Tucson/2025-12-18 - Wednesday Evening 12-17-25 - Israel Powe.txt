We are going [singing] to that meeting in [music] the sky. There will we'll behold [singing] our Jesus and we'll live eternally. What a happy wedding supper [singing] that will be. So all get ready.

Satan's like a roaming [singing and music] lion, roaming to and fro, seeking whom [music] he may devour. The Bible tells us so.

I [music] bless you, saints. So good to be in the house of the Lord with you tonight. [music] Always appreciate the wonderful songs of Zion. Amen. I love to praise the Lord and certainly so happy to see brother Art and Sister Anniel here with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we appreciate each of you and u thank you for singing that song special. Who was that? That was sister El. Yes. Appreciate that. Praise the Lord. Like to take our scriptures and turn in Hebrews chapter 11 quickly for a moment. I'm just going to take a few notes on the message paradox that we heard on Sunday and I'll be taking some things out of there was I know it blessed a lot of the saints and I got a lot of different text and quotes from that message and it was such a blessing to be a part of it uh to hear it and um we're going to take the scripture in Hebrews chapter 11 and verse number 39 and 40. Then we'll also take Mark chapter 11. And when you get those places, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11 verses 30 9 and 40. Of course, we know these are the heroes of the faith. Those that were mentioned and they are laid out there what they did and they all did it by faith. And Hebrews 11 verse 38 of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth. And these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise. God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect. Amen. Mark 11 23. You have that you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 22, we sing that song, have faith in God, for the answer. Those are the words of our Lord Jesus. In verse 22, Jesus answered and said unto them, have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou moved, removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore I say unto you, what things soever you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them, and ye shall have them. Amen. May God add a blessing to the reading of his most holy word. God bless you. You may be seated. Now, this word paradox, as brother Brandham defines it from Webster, uh something unbelievable but true. and other de definitions going further with that it's from the Greek it's a Greek origin the two words Napa and um doa it means besides or beyond or contrary to opinion expectation or a belief it's a statement or situation that appears contradictory or impossible at first yet reveals a deeper truth when it's understood. That's what a paradox is. Seemingly contradiction that is actually true. And brother Madam could have titled this message Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Or these signs shall follow them that believe. You could entitle it any um series of supernatural statements, but he uses the word paradox and um he takes from his scripture and from the testimony of Joshua where he commands the son to stand still. He says his daughter Rebecca comes to him and says, "Daddy, that means Joshua stopped the earth." And he tells he says because if you the sun doesn't actually move. It's the earth that's moving. This is his daughter Rebecca. Brother Bham says well it's the shadow of the sun that's moving on the earth. That's what Joshua stopped. &gt;&gt; And no matter how you slice it or how you say it, stop the sun, stop the earth, we know that for 24 hours the sun stood still. the shadow all time stood still was a paradox. And the brother ran goes forward in this message and brings up David how he defeated Goliath. Of course, Samson, one man against a thousand. Micah the prophet against the school of the prophets, one against many was a paradox. The scripture that we read in Markap 11, the prophet of God tells us that that scripture is a paradox. &gt;&gt; If you look at what a paradox is, if you're a Christian today, look in the mirror, that is a paradox. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Those of you that have been forgiven for much &gt;&gt; know exactly what I'm talking about. If you've been forgiven for much, you know what it means to be forgiven. And you know what Calvary means to you. &gt;&gt; Unbelievable, but true. This um uh message here, Brother Badam takes in paragraph 104. I'll just get right into it and read a few places and just encourage your heart. We heard the tape and we'll I'll read from it again just to highlight a few of these things. In paragraph 104 in the message paradox just above that he says incredible yet it is so true for he is Jehovah Gyra. Incredible things to our knowledge and science but yet it is true a great paradox. It was a paradox and will be when Jesus Mark 11:22 and 23 when he said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said. It's incredible but it's true. It's a paradox. So a paradox is not a lie. It's not a mistake. It's not nonsense. It is actually true, &gt;&gt; but it doesn't appear to be true. &gt;&gt; It's really uh like a mystery being revealed. &gt;&gt; Like for Noah to stand and say it's going to rain when it never rained before. For a man to say, "I've got the power to lay my life down and the power to bring it up again." Well, nobody's ever seen that done before. for a prophet to say a virgin shall conceive. Unbelievable. Medically, scientifically, we have no history of it. But yet, it is true. &gt;&gt; That is a paradox. &gt;&gt; This Bible is a paradox. &gt;&gt; Everything about your salvation is a paradox. &gt;&gt; The God that we serve is the God of the paradox. This falls right in line with our burden on our heart from last Wednesday on a sovereign move of God. &gt;&gt; When God moves down and pours out his blessing and his Holy Spirit upon one individual, there's nobody that can stop that. &gt;&gt; There's nobody that can make it happen &gt;&gt; or stop it from happening. &gt;&gt; And we want it to happen in our lives. &gt;&gt; We want it to happen to everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if it doesn't happen to everybody, Lord, let it happen to me. &gt;&gt; Open it up to me is my prayer. &gt;&gt; Now, we desire those things, don't we? &gt;&gt; We long to see those things take place. &gt;&gt; And um you know, the the the the the scripture tells us that he will give us the desires of our heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a promise there. Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart. &gt;&gt; Now um we want to remind oursel of these things. We want to approach the God that we serve as the supernatural God. He has the final say. So &gt;&gt; it is not your boss. It's not your career. It's not the neighborhood you live in. It's not your inadequacies. It's not any of that. He has the final say. So, &gt;&gt; and if God moves it, it will be moved. &gt;&gt; If God establishes it, it will be established. &gt;&gt; So many times we are afraid of people who have no power over our life. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; God is in control of our lives, saints. He is the one who gives us the blessing to succeed or the strength. He's the lifegiver. He's the one that blesses you in your health. &gt;&gt; Thank God for doctors. Thank God for the multivitamin. Thank God for eating good foods, but he really is the lifegiver. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you live somewhere and you wasn't eating a balanced diet, but what you was eating was blessed by God, I think you'll be okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness? &gt;&gt; He's in control of all of that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, we don't live recklessly and we don't go out here and do things that's contrary, but keep it where it needs to be kept. &gt;&gt; The Lord is the healer of our bodies. The Lord is in charge of all that we have, all that we say, all that we do. &gt;&gt; It is his church. &gt;&gt; It's not brother Israel's church or Reverend so andso's church. It is God's church. &gt;&gt; And he said he would build that church upon the rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. That my brother, my sister, is a paradox. Look at the different kinds of people that are in this building tonight. The different backgrounds. Some come from different kinds of homes and religious, you know, uh uh uh uh uh influences, but we're all in the same room tonight. &gt;&gt; It's like the rabbit in the hair. At the end of the day, we're still ended up in the same room. I might have been smarter than you or vice versa or you might have more money than me, but we're still in the same room. &gt;&gt; And I trust we're going to the same heaven. &gt;&gt; The God that we serve is the one that's in control of everything. &gt;&gt; So when a Christian falls down on their knees, it's it's really the realm of the the impossible can take place. When a believer begins to pray, that's what this meeting is. It's a it's an oldfashioned prayer meeting, the Wednesday &gt;&gt; Wednesday night prayer meeting where the paradoxes can take place. &gt;&gt; Something supernatural can happen in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hear what the prophet of God says here in paragraph 123 in this message. Oh, the only thing God is waiting on now, I believe Russia don't mean nothing to God. He wants to get one man. He don't have to have a big organizations. He don't have to have big denomination. He wants to get one man that he can wrap his spirit into him that will tell the rest of it. There will be another paradox until he can get someone completely surrendered that will do that. That's the way God does his work. He uses paradox. It was a paradox when a great soldier by the name of Jehoshaphat stood in the gates with a backsliding man by the name of Ahab and said, "Before we go to this battle, it's not a good thing that is it is it not a good thing that consult the Lord." Now, if that man's heart is hungry to know the will of God, there's got to be a will of God somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many can thank God for that? How many need to know the will of God &gt;&gt; on so many levels of our life? You're going to get married, you got a career, you know, this house or this whatever it is, whatever the decision you are faced with in your life. I'm faced with them. You're faced with them. You want to know the will of God, the perfect will of God. And if a man wants to know the will of God, there is a perfect will of God for that man. &gt;&gt; Yes. I don't want to make an intellectual decision. I don't want to make a carnal decision. I want to make uh decisions based on the perfect will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he's revealed to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there is a will of God for a man to know. Paragraph 136, the prophet of God continues here. It says this. He took Ma Micah instead of a well-trained school of ministers, renowned men. Nothing against him. They were great men. They were men who believed in not another god. They believed in the same god Micah believed in. But they've acted like they believed it but wouldn't take his word because they wanted to be popular. They wanted to find favor with the king and their blindness overlooked the true word of God. How could God bless what he had cursed? And that's a very striking uh set of two items there that they wanted to find favor with man and really our favor is with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Um uh influence is a strong thing. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; Influence is a powerful thing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And um whether we know it or not, we all are being influenced by something. and and and and whenever God is going to use you or or bless you in any kind of way, he uses men to do that. &gt;&gt; Think about it real good. Blessings don't fall out of heaven in in a ball of fire. And he uses men, &gt;&gt; uses people, mamas, daddies, brothers and sisters. He said, "Lord, I need a blessing." And then some brother will call you. &gt;&gt; Lord, I need encouragement. And that some sister will call you. He uses people. That's his agency. That's what he uses. &gt;&gt; He uses you. &gt;&gt; I get a witness. &gt;&gt; He uses men. &gt;&gt; And you can't serve the Lord without serving people. &gt;&gt; And you've got to have people in your realm &gt;&gt; as you serve the Lord. You serve people. You serve the Lord. If I can't love you, can't say I love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's it's it's it's directly connected. It's easy to say, "I just love you, Lord." But you have problems with people. And we all have people problems. &gt;&gt; And Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; We all have people problems every now and then. Let's be honest. And and we are the problem many times. &gt;&gt; Can we all say amen to that? &gt;&gt; You've never been the problem before. That's a problem if you think that that is a problem. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Every one of us have been the problem. &gt;&gt; Yes. Keep it real. &gt;&gt; But you know, the God that we serve uses us and he uses the problems and he uses the agency of men and women to carry out his plan. He's got a purpose and he uses that and he's trying to get a hold of one man, one woman that he can pour his spirit into and make that individual a paradox. And you know with that we have to be very careful because we so lean on one another that we don't let people influence us away from the word of the Lord because that influence is very very strong. If I were to take five people that and I just paid them to praise the Lord the way I say they should praise him and set him in this church. Those five people will probably influence a number of other people. just on a carnal level because people look around, they start seeing and they get influenced. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. And these men, they were blinded. They were blinded to the word because of their popularity and they wanted to be in good graces and find favor with the king. We want to stay in favor with the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to be able to really lean on the word of the Lord as our absolute. And we'll see that how important that is as the day goes on, &gt;&gt; as these days move on, having an absolute and that absolute coming out of the word of the Lord and letting that be your influence and God will bless you and use you and then now he can separate you and make you a paradox. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we desire. Amen. The prophet continues on and says this paragraph 138. Men, you who can't rule your own house and then try to be preachers and deacons. How are you fit to be a preacher in the pull pit to lead the church of the living God and to divide for them their inheritance when you think more of your meal ticket and the offering that comes in than you do the word of God? and ashamed to say it before the women, afraid you won't be popular. God have mercy on your sinful soul. &gt;&gt; Speak the word of God in truth. John said, "The axe is laid to the root of the tree, and the axe is the word of God. Every tree that don't bring forth the right fruit, he down and cast it into the fire, God bring us another paradox." So, what is he referring to in this scripture? Now, this isn't a deacon's meeting or a preachers's meeting, but this is a scripture he's referring to in First Timothy chapter 3. If we could turn there quickly, and this is what the word of the Lord says. That was on the tape Sunday morning. I hope we got this right. &gt;&gt; I'm just slowing it down a little bit as I'm reading it to you slowly. We all heard it. We all said amen to it &gt;&gt; in theory. Some of our amens are very quiet. Some of them are, you know, but we all are believers here. So, believers say amen to the word. It's not always verbal, but I I believe that the saints here are are in agreement &gt;&gt; with what the word of the Lord says. &gt;&gt; Whether you say amen or not, I believe you you're in agreement with that. &gt;&gt; So, these things are true. So, let's slow it down just a little bit. And here, Brother Ratom is talking about a man ruling his own house. Before we read the scripture, let me think of this just for a moment. If the man can't rule his own house, and that's his own house. I'm talking about his own tabernacle. He can't rule his own physical house either. &gt;&gt; So, it starts somewhere, doesn't it? So if you don't if you're not in control of your tabernacle, you sure can't control a tabernacle at home. &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm so glad I'm not a deacon." No, that's for everybody. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Every man, every believer &gt;&gt; needs to be able to know how to possess and contain his own vessel &gt;&gt; as a believer. &gt;&gt; So controlling his own house. Let's take the scripture here. 1 Timothy 3. This is a true saying. If a man desire office of a bishop, what does he desireth? A what? &gt;&gt; Good work. &gt;&gt; A good work. Not a stressful work. Not a bad work. The Bible calls it a good Everybody smile and say good work. &gt;&gt; Good work. A bishop then must be blameless. The husband of one wife, viligent, vigilant, sober of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach, not given to whine, no striker, not greedy or filthy lucer, but patient, not a brawler, not covetous, one that ruleth well his own house, having his what? children &gt;&gt; in subjection with all gravity. For a man not know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God? Not a novice or newcomer or believer less or or that word novice or newly planted. That word means that not a novice less being lifted up in pride you fall into condemnation of the devil. Moreover, he must have a good report of them which are without, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. Likewise must the deacons be graved, not double tonged, what? Not given to too much wine, not greedy or filthy lucer, holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. Let these also first be proved, then let them use the office of the deacon, being found blameless. Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderous, sober, faithful in some things, &gt;&gt; faithful in all things. Let the deacon be the husband of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. For they that use the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is Christ Jesus. You know the scripture on the bishop and on the deacon says that they must be blameless. Right? &gt;&gt; You know that that that uh qualification of blameless isn't just to the deacons. It's to the believers as well. &gt;&gt; I don't have it with me because I wasn't going to bring this but I want to bring it right now. Okay. &gt;&gt; Let me just bring this word blameless just for a moment. If I I remember bringing it some time ago. the Lord will help me. That's of course if you all are okay with that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Philippians 2:15. Verse 14 says what? &gt;&gt; Do all things without I thought it was only the deacons and their wives without murmurings and what &gt;&gt; disputings. Are these the scriptures? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are these the ones we highlight or we don't highlight? Are these are less important or these are the more important scriptures or are they all important? &gt;&gt; This is your B. This is my Bible. &gt;&gt; And and the scripture says this that ye may be what? Who talking to the deacons? &gt;&gt; Everybody. &gt;&gt; Everybody. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; That they may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom he shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life, that I may rejoice in the day of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I go a little bit further? I think there's one more in there. 1 Thessalonians 5:23 says this. Verse 21 says, "Prove all things." Okay, let's let's go up a little closer. Verse 18. Oh, it's so good. Verse 17. &gt;&gt; Let's take verse 16. [laughter] Let's read it. It says, "Rejoice ever more. Pray without &gt;&gt; ceasing &gt;&gt; and everything. Give &gt;&gt; complain about it. &gt;&gt; Stress about it. Talk no. Give thanks. &gt;&gt; For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. &gt;&gt; Quench not the spirit. Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things. Hold fast that which is good. Abstain from all appearance of evil. Yes. &gt;&gt; And the very God of peace sanctify you holy. And I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless &gt;&gt; until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. It is the will of God for our hearts and our lives as believers to be blameless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's in the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But this is brother Brandham is he starts to get on the preachers and the deacons how they can't rule their own house and how can they rule the house of God be leaders in the house of God. how their home, their children must be in subjection. So is this saying to all the other brothers who have children that their children should not be sub subject? It's not what it's saying. Not what it's saying. &gt;&gt; But it's highlights this office and really puts the squeeze on it. I mean for a man to be blameless any man in this age it will take a paradox &gt;&gt; that is a supernatural work &gt;&gt; that has to be the Holy Ghost coming down &gt;&gt; tell me a man who can be blameless without the Holy Ghost moving in his life &gt;&gt; huh &gt;&gt; it doesn't happen this is not a carnal okay I'm going to be a good boy this week this is not what this is &gt;&gt; this is a sovereign work of God. The Holy Ghost coming down on a man on a woman and changing them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A PARADOX &gt;&gt; LIKE JOSHUA stopped the sun, the Holy SPIRIT WILL STOP THE foolishness in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. All right. So, let's move forward. Okay. Now, the prophet of God goes a little further in this message. In paragraph 145, he says this here. Just got a few more moments and I'll be &gt;&gt; paragraph 144. But it was a paradox how it got. Why didn't he come down to that be big school up there at Jerusalem? Why didn't he come to Caif as the high priest? Why did he not come to some of those great trained men who had been trained from childhood and their fathers had been trained before them? Their fathers before them for generation after generation after generation trained and schooled fine high culture educated and then pick an old man out in the wilderness that never had a day schooling in his life. set him out there on the Jordan and said, "This is him." A paradox. Exactly. Uncredible, but yet IT WAS TRUE. &gt;&gt; GOD DID IT. The virgin birth of our Lord. Incredible for a woman to bring a child without KNOWING A MAN. GOD DID IT. &gt;&gt; GOD DID IT. SEE, IT'S A PARADOX. Took a little old woman down there, a little old girl, engaged to some man about 45 years old. She herself was about 16 or 18, engaged to this man who was a widowerower of four children, and then took THIS WOMAN AND OVERSHADOWED HER BY THE HOLY SPIRIT, and conceived in her womb the body that tabernacled Almighty God, a paradox. Amen. I love that. &gt;&gt; The supernatural God has to be made manifested in our assemblies. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's a must. &gt;&gt; That is not an option. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about God's church. I'm not talking about somebody else's church. I'm talking about God's church is ruled and reigned by the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's church, God's Bible, God's message that he sent to us is a supernatural message, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And the believers that follow it are supernatural or should be. And our hearts and our thoughts and our expectations should be for the supernatural to happen in our mix. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, people try to challenge what you believe or they try to push against what you believe and maybe you fall out of favor with them on the job or wherever it may be. Unsaved loved ones, whatever it may be. But you know God has got got your back. Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you know the angels are with you? &gt;&gt; Do you know that there's more with you than there is AGAINST YOU? &gt;&gt; THAT THERE IS NOTHING CAN STOP A TRUE BELIEVER &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT BELIEVER is a paradox. &gt;&gt; It's supernatural all the way through. &gt;&gt; You think you know this intellectual age that we live in, we argue so much. The podcast is argument. the the the the the dialogue in religion, the doctrines is argument. There they say three gods, we say one. Even in the message, it's a argument constantly. We believe we believe it's literal. Some believe it's fear. IT'S A ARGUMENT. BUT WHEN GOD COMES DOWN &gt;&gt; AND MANIFEST HIMSELF, &gt;&gt; there's nothing to argue about. &gt;&gt; When you have thus sayeth the Lord, there's nothing to argue about. You just preach what thus sayeth the Lord is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we don't have no opinion other than God's opinion. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So you can walk up to the pull pit with a full clean heart and just say what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Say what the message says. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then everybody will love you and your church will be full. Right? &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; HE WILL LOVE YOU THOUGH. &gt;&gt; That's what matters. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a paradox for God to open our eyes. And this is what we want. This is what I'm not interested in arguing. I'm interested in God manifesting himself in my life. God is looking for one individual, one man, one woman. Here what he says in paragraph 156 talking about Samson with the jawbone 155. So this little fellow was standing out there and all at once here come these Philistines and surrounded him to kill him. And he took the jawbone of a mule that was laying there, a wild one of little donkeys, picked up the jawbone of that mule, and the spirit of the Lord came on him, and there was a paradox. &gt;&gt; How that he beat down with the jawbone of a mule, threw that half inch thick helmet over the top of the head with the jawbone of a mule. Why? The first that old dry jaw jawbone laying there, the first lick he would have have hit, it would have bursted into a thousand pieces over the top of those helmets or those big shields. When a thousand rushed in upon him, he beat every one of them to death. Paradox. That's when the spirit of God come upon him. Oh, if we could only be jawbones in the hand of God, there would be another paradox. &gt;&gt; Yes, it was. If you were sitting in the stands that day from a distance watching this battle and you saw this one man going up against these Philistines and you see this man begin to shake himself and move himself, a little bitty guy. You're like, man, what's this guy doing? He start to get himself together and he reaches over, grabs the draw and you and you're looking at all of this, you be like, man, they going to smoke him. A few minutes he poof, he'll be gone. But then something happened. HE GRABS HIS JAWBONE AND THEN BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. Five men fall. Boom, boom, boom. 10, 100, &gt;&gt; 200, 300, 400. At some point the Philistines, if he's a smart Philistine, he'd be like, you know, today ain't our day. &gt;&gt; Let's go, let's go back and be the one to tell the story what happened. &gt;&gt; OR YOU CAN TRY TO CHANGE SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE CHANGED. &gt;&gt; You know, if it was a thousand, IF IT WAS 2,000, IF IT WAS 5,000, THIS MAN IS NOT GOING TO LOSE. &gt;&gt; WHY? He was a paradox. Unbelievable. INCREDIBLE. [screaming] UNBELIEVABLE. BUT YET IT was true. &gt;&gt; It's written in the word. It's recorded right there. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to be. A paradox. &gt;&gt; Unbelievable. &gt;&gt; But yet it's still true. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, if we can be only be a paradox. Let me take this last one in paragraph 161. 163 prophet of God says this here when God took a bunch of ignoramises as we call them today holy rollers poor of this world's goods poured out the Holy Ghost on them in the upper room instead of pouring it out upon the Sanhadrin council where all the theologians sit where all the great men was where the head of all the churches were the ones that had studied in the scriptures and had made a great school well trained and waiting for the coming Messiah and knowing that they would be the one who would walk out and meet him and say, "Messiah, you come down as if on an airplane's wings. We sat down here on the temple steps. We seen you come down out of heaven from the golden corridors of heaven. Now we're all trained and ready to go to work. We got our schooling. We got our bachelor of art. We got our PhD LLD and all this. We're all trained. Here we stand 10,000 strong. We're ready for you. Come on. We're waiting. Calling come. But instead of that, he goes down and gets a bunch of people that didn't hardly know right hand from left. &gt;&gt; That's right. put them in the upper room and poured out his spirit, oh God, upon a bunch of people like that. Instead of taking the Sanhedrin council, he took fishermen. Isn't it strange that he didn't use their educations? It pleased God. It seems to please God to make his own church a paradox. The same thing he's doing right now. making a paradox out of HIS CHURCH, BYPASSING ALL THE GREAT HIGH fluting and all this stuff there that's so-called church. He and he'll anybody that he can get into his hand, it'll open their eyes and see what's truth, test it with the word of God, and in the time that we're living and place and place them into the body of paradox. &gt;&gt; God chose such. He makes his church a paradox. Odd people, strange people. [laughter] You [snorts] know, some people come to church, they'll even come to this church maybe for the first time and they look around and many of you all look very strange, very odd. It's like, what's the connection here? Why are you two together? Why are these families together? Well, God did it. &gt;&gt; You chose your friends, didn't you? How'd that work out? &gt;&gt; But then God chooses &gt;&gt; a family, the family of God. &gt;&gt; That he wanted you and me to walk together. &gt;&gt; Isn't that nice? &gt;&gt; He wanted me to know you and you to know me. &gt;&gt; Look at your neighbor and say, "Neighbor, it's so good to know you. You be getting on my nerves, but it's good to know you. No, don't tell him that. Don't tell him that. &gt;&gt; But he chose that. Isn't that nice? &gt;&gt; He's the sovereign God. He does what he wants to do and how he wants to do it. &gt;&gt; It's a paradox. And God wants to makes his make his church a paradox. All through the scripture, he takes the the the the the minority one. He takes the one that the less likely. He takes a David. He takes, you know, the people move over, they gloss over, they miss it, they can't see it. They He takes those one all the way through. And then in this time, in this age, many want to take a stand in the intellectual and defend the gospel. But God doesn't use the intellectual to defend this gospel. Thank the Lord, there are intellectuals that do do it. But what's an intellectual without the supernatural? &gt;&gt; You tell me what that is. &gt;&gt; And what would you rather have? Is this Bible more intellectual or more? There's nobody more intellectual than God himself. &gt;&gt; And he took the foolish and the weak and the beggarly things of this earth to bring the kingdoms down, to bring things to pass. Let's take a few scriptures that are like paradox type scriptures if I can read one or two of them. First 2 Corinthians chapter 12 says this. And he said unto me, verse number nine and 10, my grace is sufficient for thee. My strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I glory rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christ's sake. For when I am weak then I am strong. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody tell me that makes sense. &gt;&gt; That don't make sense. &gt;&gt; You're weak, but you're talking about you're strong. WHICH ONE IS IT, PAUL? WHEN I AM WEAK, THEN I AM STRONG. THEREFORE, he got the paradox. He got the mystery of it. So many people thinking the way up is up, but we know the way up is down. &gt;&gt; That's the that's the mechanics of the Bible. THAT'S THE MATHEMATICS OF THE BIBLE. The way up is down. &gt;&gt; And people think the way up is up. &gt;&gt; Taking something, taking advantage, jumping over. But the way up really is down. The scripture tells us in St. John 12:24, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corner of a wheat fall in the ground and die, it abideth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it, and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. So the grain has to die, doesn't it? It has to die. And when it dies, it actually brings forth more fruit. When you die to yourself, that's when you'll become more successful in the kingdom of God. When you let go of your ways and your and you got to have it your way. It's got to be the way you said it, the way you want it. Everybody's got to get in line behind you. When you let go of that, then God will bless you. &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's contrary. It's a paradox, but yet it's true. Matthew 16 24-26 says this. Then said Jesus unto his disciples, if a man come after me, let him deny himself and do what? Take up his cross and follow me. Verse 25, for whosoever will save his life shall lose it, and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? There's a quotation where brother random makes the statement that persecution always strengthens the church. &gt;&gt; It always stren we think persecution actually weakens us. It makes us less. It hurts us and we're we're less. No, no, no, no, no, no. Persecution actually strengthens the church. &gt;&gt; It's a It's a little different equation than what the world would say. You think, "If you love me, you wouldn't spank me, Mom. If you love me, Dad, you'll just say yes all the time." Well, that's not love. &gt;&gt; It's off. It's an error. It's contrary. That's not how God operates. When God loves you, he allows things to happen to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He allows distresses and squeezes. Look at Look at the Apostle Paul. The Apostle Paul went, he was going, going, going, going going going everywhere he went, he was preaching, and he'd probably still be going today if he was here. But when they hooked him up, put him in prison, locked him up for two years, what he do? He was writing, writing, writing. Many of the fine books that we have of the Bible were written from a man without a low lighting and and and meager elements to write with and and but look what it produced. Look at brother Rando's life, how God squeezed on him and how he lost what he lost and the things that he had to suffer and go through. Persecution always strengthens the church. Let me say this. Persecution always will strengthen the believer. It's a paradox. We don't ask for it, but it will happen. It's actually happening right now. God, it was pleasing God that he would make his church a paradox. I um I love the oldfashioned prayer meeting. I love the weekday service. And for a number of years, I was I was trying to find where the the history of the Wednesday night prayer meeting comes from because it's not scriptural. [snorts] But um we know the prophet gave us that example. He had a Sunday morning, Sunday night service. I know some people can't do it because of whatever the convenience is. some switched their services and so forth. But um one of the early early writers after the in the first century they were bringing out how the Christians took Wednesday and Friday because Wednesday was the the day that Judas betrayed Jesus and Friday was the day he was crucified. So that was a fast day and that's in in a lot of the histories and they they did they chose those two days because they were opposite to the Jews fast day. The Jews would fast on a Monday and a Thursday. Um and a lot of those writings talk about that and then you see the the history of it and how it just um evolved and we have a weekday service and we call it a Wednesday uh prayer meeting. Some do it on Thursday and whatnot. It's just an interesting history how it how it started. But let me [snorts] just read a few scriptures for you and what the early saints did as they gathered together. And then if the musicians will come for a moment and see if I can find these scriptures that I had written out. Acts [snorts] 2:42 the scripture says this. [snorts] Excuse me. Then they verse 41. And then they that gladly received his word were baptized. And the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 souls. And they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine in fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers. Acts 5:42, brother Bam says that they were taking communion. That's how he interprets that. The breaking of bread. He said that the early church every time they met they took communion. Acts 5:42 says this here. And daily in the temple and in every house they cease not to teach and preach Jesus Christ. And Hebrews 10:25 tells us not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together. So they they daily got together. It was um home meetings. They met in different places at different times, but it was a constant daily gathering. We have a Wednesday night prayer meeting. We thank the Lord for it. Call it a weekday service. We gather to pray. We gather to hear his word to break from the uh from the from the Sunday service. And we want to always respect that and honor it. We thank the Lord for it that we can gather together and make our requests known, praise the Lord, and have have the Holy Spirit make us a paradox. That's that's our desire. So, God bless you. There was a prayer request I have from brother Richard Valencia that came in earlier this week on Sunday. He said, "I wanted you to ask I wanted to ask you to keep sister Sophia in prayers. The cardiologist diagnosed diagnosed her with aortic stenosis. The treatment is to change out the aortic valve via open heart surgery or through a trans catheter valve replacement. This isn't the news we wanted, but we know that God is in control and has the last word. We'll speak with the surgeon tomorrow, which was Monday, and most likely surgery will take place in a few months. And then so they met with this surgeon and he sent this. He says, "I wanted to update you on Sophia, Sister Sophia. They did all the preliminary tests and everything looks good for the valve replacement. She finally was released from the hospital today and is resting. Her heart surgery will take place mid January. I want to thank you for your prayers and thank God for allowing me more time with my wife. God bless you. That's from brother Richard Valencia. So, we'll keep sister Sophia in prayer. She's had health complications for a good portion of her life and she's just really hard for her to even make it out. And so, this is, you know, open heart surgery is a big deal. So, we want to pray for them. Keep them in prayer. May was there a request here tonight that anyone had like to make known? Yes, sister. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. Her name is Desiree. All right. We'll keep her in prayer or someone else. We can all stand to our feet, brother. Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. We pray the Lord will touch you. There's someone else. I didn't have any other written requests. I might be forgetting one. If you have that, you can make it known. I'm sure we have unspoken requests. Brothers Jonathan. Yes. [snorts] Amen. Thank you. That's Sister Aaron. &gt;&gt; She's at the hospital now. &gt;&gt; She's at the hospital. Okay. All right. &gt;&gt; All right. We'll keep her in prayer. Um that's the best thing anybody can do is pray. Oh my. Prayer changes things. Amen. Let's all stand to our feet. Amen. How many's ever been in the hospital and you can feel the saints prayers over you? &gt;&gt; There's something about it. It's really special. Amen. song. Father, [music] he knows my heart.

We just pray that the shikana glory would come down [music] in each and every one of us like in the day of Pentecost and our our prophet our brother said one day I remember hearing it in the word in the message he said there's something greater than Pentecost and it's the resurrection and that's what we're we want we want [music] we want Jesus to come quickly so let's bow our heads and say thanks thank you [music] Lord Jesus I'm not worthy to be here, Lord.
