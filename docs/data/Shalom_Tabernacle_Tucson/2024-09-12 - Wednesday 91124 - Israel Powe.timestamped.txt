[16:23] said he'd be here in the midst where we
[16:26] would Gather in his name and we come
[16:28] gather GED in his name we like to uh go
[16:31] right into the scriptures before we go
[16:33] to prayer this evening and there's a
[16:37] portion of scripture in the Old
[16:39] Testament Numbers chapter
[16:42] 32
[16:44] and we'll take first Timothy 4 as we go
[16:47] along Ephesians 4 as
[16:51] well Numbers chapter 32
[16:55] vers number six
[16:59] just really um meditating and going on
[17:03] over the message from Sunday some of
[17:05] those things that the Lord had placed
[17:07] upon my heart and uh really been going
[17:11] into the faith of God and how all things
[17:14] are possible if we can believe and then
[17:18] getting into the things that would
[17:20] hinder our faith and the battle that
[17:23] we're in and taking that message the um
[17:27] greatest battle of fought brother
[17:30] brandham breaks down the man and the
[17:34] woman how we're are a Triune being Body
[17:38] Spirit and
[17:39] soul and I just want to take this
[17:41] scripture in Numbers chapter 32 and
[17:43] verse number six and it says here
[17:48] verse start with seven and wherefore
[17:52] discourage ye the heart of the children
[17:54] of Israel from going over into the land
[17:57] which the Lord hath given them thus did
[18:00] your fathers when I sent them from
[18:03] Kadesh barnea to see the land for when
[18:06] they went up unto the valley of eshcol
[18:09] and saw the land they discouraged the
[18:11] heart of the children of Israel that
[18:14] they should not go into the land which
[18:16] the Lord had given them and the Lord's
[18:19] anger was kindled at same time and he
[18:22] swear saying surely none of the men that
[18:26] came up out of Egypt from 20 years old
[18:29] and upward shall see the land which I
[18:31] swear unto Abraham unto Isaac and unto
[18:34] Jacob because they have not wholly
[18:39] followed me save Caleb the son of
[18:42] jeffner and the kisite and Joshua the
[18:45] son of nun for they have wholly followed
[18:50] the Lord so there was a group that did
[18:53] not wholly follow and then there was
[18:56] this group that Holy followed and then
[19:00] let's take one scripture in 1
[19:01] Thessalonians chapter 5 21 and this is
[19:04] the only scripture that uh I can see
[19:08] that mentions the body spirit and soul
[19:12] in one context typically it's the body
[19:17] and the Soul or the body and the spirit
[19:19] as Jesus talked about and but here the
[19:23] Apostle Paul grabs 1 Thessalonians
[19:25] chapter 5
[19:29] verses 21-
[19:31] 23 as a matter of fact I believe that's
[19:33] one of the Epistles that he commanded to
[19:37] be read among all of the congregation
[19:40] actually 1 Thessalonians 5:21 you have
[19:43] it say
[19:45] Amen prove all things hold fast that
[19:49] which is good abstain from all
[19:51] appearance of evil and the Very God of
[19:54] Peace sanctify you holy and I I pray God
[19:59] your whole spirit and soul and body be
[20:04] preserved blameless until the coming of
[20:06] the Lord Jesus Christ amen let us pray
[20:10] Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on your
[20:12] word tonight a few moments before we
[20:16] bring our needs in prayer and really
[20:19] just set aside time to pray and meditate
[20:23] upon your goodness Lord bring us into
[20:25] the framework of what you have for us by
[20:29] the ministring of your word Lord we know
[20:32] that you promised that you would be in
[20:35] our midst and you said that the word
[20:37] would never your word would not return
[20:40] void and we know that is true Lord and
[20:42] we claim that tonight and we pray that
[20:45] you'll move aside every weight and our
[20:47] tiredness of our bodies the weariness of
[20:50] our mind the cares of life and may we
[20:53] receive something that our whole Spirit
[20:57] soul and body can receive receive in
[20:59] Jesus name we pray amen God bless you
[21:02] you may be seated this whole man brother
[21:05] Ram in the message um
[21:10] um greatest battle OFA paragraph 72 he
[21:13] said if you'll sit down when you get
[21:15] home draw three little
[21:18] rings and you know those three rings
[21:22] represents the tri Unity of a man what a
[21:26] man is now when we come in here you just
[21:29] see me my frame I see you man man or
[21:33] woman but that's just the outside of us
[21:36] and that's the body um beyond the body
[21:40] is our spirit and in that Spirit the
[21:44] prophet of God tells us the conscience
[21:46] memory reasons affections and our
[21:51] imaginations are what is used to contact
[21:54] our
[21:55] spirit and our body is contacted through
[21:58] see taste feel smell and the things that
[22:02] we hear it's the outside body the third
[22:06] drink that makes up to man is his
[22:09] soul and the prophet of God makes it
[22:12] very clear that that is governed by
[22:17] either Faith or doubt and there's a
[22:20] channel that that is uh used to get to
[22:24] Faith or doubt and that's called free
[22:26] moral agency we are not robots We Are
[22:30] Not Angels and even some angels can
[22:33] choose because they did choose but human
[22:36] beings in particular makes us different
[22:38] than the animal kingdom is that we have
[22:40] the ability to choose and in this free
[22:44] moral agency is where the Battleground
[22:47] is we choose to follow the lord to do
[22:53] what's right we choose to read the
[22:57] things that are available to our see
[23:00] taste feel smell and he and through our
[23:03] conscience memory reasons affections and
[23:05] imaginations those are choices so it's
[23:09] really nice I wish I was a graphic
[23:11] artist and I wish I could put it up on
[23:13] the screen three rings or three bodies
[23:17] that actually make us who we are and
[23:20] when we talk about you know this Earthly
[23:23] Tabernacle science and medical the
[23:25] medical field can look at that body and
[23:29] run test on it to to tell you whether
[23:32] you have a healthy body or not or if
[23:35] something is weak in your body it's
[23:37] tremendous I I think it's one of the
[23:39] closest things on the natural level to
[23:43] one of God's works because healing God
[23:47] is the Healer and he uses doctors
[23:49] medicine and all of that for healing but
[23:52] our spirit conscious memory reason
[23:55] affections and all those things they uh
[23:58] we we make a choice to allow things to
[24:01] come in and out and I and as I was
[24:05] expressing to you all on Sunday that
[24:08] this goes further than you know just
[24:11] arguing with the other people or other
[24:14] churches or getting your Doctrine across
[24:18] you know this is arguing with yourself
[24:21] this is getting the the issues dealt out
[24:25] with inside of you your spirit if a man
[24:28] can control his Spirit or if he can't
[24:31] control his spirit it's like a city
[24:34] Without Walls I mean anything can go
[24:37] anything can happen and so I think that
[24:40] you know cleansing that man uh is the is
[24:44] what we really want to focus on now the
[24:47] scripture tells us that in 1 Timothy
[24:51] chapter 4 we'll read it for you verse
[24:55] number 11 says this and this is Paul
[24:59] talking to Timothy these things command
[25:01] and teach let no man despise thy youth
[25:05] but be thou an example of the Believers
[25:09] in word in conversation in charity in
[25:13] spirit in faith in Purity till I come
[25:18] give attendance to reading to
[25:22] exhortation to Doctrine neglect not the
[25:26] gift that is in thee which was given
[25:28] thee by Prophecy with the laying on of
[25:31] Hands by the Pres meditate upon these
[25:35] things give thyself holy to them now we
[25:42] know and I brought it out before and
[25:44] brother bandam brings it out and the
[25:45] word of God tells us that we believe the
[25:48] whole word not part of it all of it and
[25:53] in believing all of the word we believe
[25:56] all of the word with all of who we are
[26:00] we take our body our spirit our soul the
[26:04] whole man and we believe the word not
[26:07] with just our intellect not just with
[26:08] our head but we want down in our
[26:11] subconscious the little man that's
[26:14] driving the boat as brother bam says you
[26:17] can't see him but he's turning the utter
[26:20] and people will come up in the prayer
[26:21] line yes I believe and they're saying
[26:23] that out of their mouth but something in
[26:26] their spirit in their heart is still
[26:28] doubting that's the man we want to deal
[26:31] with and we want that cleared out so
[26:34] Satan has a way of trying to make
[26:38] himself um uh
[26:41] manifested through us and to us so
[26:44] brother vam takes this and the greatest
[26:46] battle ever fought and I'd like to read
[26:48] for you here the sister can pick this up
[26:51] for us paragraph
[26:53] 72 if you sit down when you get home and
[26:56] draw three little rings you'll find out
[27:00] that the outside body has five senses
[27:03] it's contacted by that is C taste feel
[27:05] smell in here that's the five senses
[27:09] that control the human body inside of
[27:12] the body is a soul and that soul is
[27:14] controlled by imaginations conscience
[27:17] memory reasons affections that's the
[27:21] thing that controls the soul but the
[27:23] spirit it only has one sense the spirit
[27:27] oh let's get it it the spirit has one
[27:30] sense and that sense is either dominates
[27:34] it is Faith or
[27:40] doubt that's exactly and there's only
[27:42] one Avenue to it that's free moral
[27:47] agency you can accept doubt or you can
[27:50] accept Faith either one you want to work
[27:53] on therefore Satan began at the
[27:56] principal part to cause the spirit of
[27:59] man to doubt God's word god began at the
[28:03] principal part to lay his word in that
[28:07] Spirit there you are that's what does it
[28:11] if this church right now could be put
[28:15] together and knitted together with such
[28:17] that every person would be in one Accord
[28:20] with not one Shadow of Doubt anywhere
[28:24] there would not be a feble person in our
[28:27] midst
[28:28] in another five minutes so we're all in
[28:32] one place
[28:33] physically but our Spirits some of us
[28:36] are at work some of us are forgot an
[28:39] email some of us are what we going to
[28:41] eat tomorrow some of us are stressing
[28:44] over whatever are we're here I see you
[28:46] here you see me here but my mind is over
[28:49] here my affections and it's drawing away
[28:52] but if if I can get the word in those
[28:55] channels and know that I came here for
[28:58] the word and the purpose that God would
[29:01] have for me all things are possible to
[29:03] them that believe I can have whatever
[29:06] God has determined in his word for me to
[29:09] have if that would line right up and so
[29:13] that's free moral agance that's a choice
[29:16] that you make that is on you as the
[29:20] prophet brings it out and brother bam he
[29:23] continues paragraph 76 remember it's not
[29:26] Christian Science Now mind over matter
[29:29] that the
[29:31] mind accepts the life which is the word
[29:34] of God and there Begins the life just
[29:38] your thought doesn't do it but the word
[29:41] of God brought in the channel of your
[29:44] thought see it's not the thought as
[29:47] Christian Science makes it mind over
[29:49] matter no that isn't it but your mind
[29:53] accepts it it grasps it it's your mind
[29:58] what is your mind controlled by your
[30:02] spirit and your spirit catches the word
[30:04] of God and that's the thing that gots
[30:07] life in it it brings life into you oh
[30:11] brother when that takes place when life
[30:14] comes down that channel into you the
[30:17] word of God is manifested in you if you
[30:20] abide in me and my words abide in you
[30:23] then ask what you will and it'll be done
[30:25] for you how many believe that tonight
[30:28] you know this is really really something
[30:33] I played the quote for you I read it for
[30:35] you first and I played it for you for
[30:37] again where uh brother banam was talking
[30:40] about those Beatles in their music and
[30:42] their whole thing that they were doing
[30:45] and that even people who had nothing to
[30:47] do with the Bible or church but they
[30:50] believed that something good could
[30:53] happen to them even be healed in their
[30:56] bodies and the Lord Lord honored that
[30:59] and so I was meditating on that a little
[31:01] bit further and I started to look when I
[31:04] first moved here here in uh it was the
[31:08] December or so of 1999 and then I think
[31:11] Sharon came over in January or 2000 she
[31:15] always corrects me on the dates but we
[31:17] got here about
[31:18] 2000 I took a little course at the Puma
[31:22] college and one of the English courses
[31:24] had us to a project to write a paper and
[31:28] I took the subject on um the effects of
[31:33] uh what was it not Divine Healing but um
[31:37] the effects of a positive attitude when
[31:39] you get bad results from the doctor and
[31:42] this is not Christian people at all
[31:44] these are medical doctors that have it
[31:49] documented that when you get bad news
[31:51] from The Physician if you just have a
[31:55] good attitude your chance of getting
[31:59] better increase by like 60 or 70% it's a
[32:03] major major the doctors know this the
[32:05] healthc care industry know this and so
[32:08] you know and I I I looked at that and
[32:10] this was 20 something years ago where
[32:12] well it hasn't changed and they it even
[32:14] goes even further with this um what they
[32:17] call the placebo effect you know they
[32:20] give these fake pills and then they're
[32:22] trying to test a drug and you know and
[32:25] it's just tremendous what when you think
[32:29] that you are getting something that
[32:32] helps you when you just think that now
[32:34] this is not the Bible this is not me
[32:36] preaching this is not a quotation from
[32:38] the Bible this is not religious people
[32:41] these these These are documented in
[32:43] journals that the manufacturers of drugs
[32:47] have hidden and one gentleman he he took
[32:50] the the care of Information Act and sued
[32:53] them and made them open up their numbers
[32:55] and they found out when they're testing
[32:57] these drugs
[32:58] that many of the people that's taking
[33:00] fake pills are doing better than the
[33:04] people that's getting the drug that
[33:05] they're trying to push it's not a joke
[33:08] it's not even like somebody's making it
[33:10] up it's not like a one like in hitting
[33:12] in a corner it's like a cross the board
[33:14] when you get a chance go use the
[33:17] internet and look up the
[33:20] placebo and then get your shouting shoes
[33:22] on because they not even quoting the
[33:24] scripture but I'm looking at it in the
[33:26] lens of the scripture if a man without
[33:29] the Bible can be healed by a green or a
[33:33] blue pill because somebody said this
[33:35] pill is going to help you what about
[33:37] God's word what about his word so so so
[33:41] I'm a I'm a tremendous proponent for the
[33:43] internet now okay because it's going to
[33:47] help you I I I was sharing this with a
[33:49] brother with this new found Revelation I
[33:52] got another Pastor in the city and I we
[33:54] was talking about the internet I said I
[33:56] changed my tune on the internet said how
[33:58] so I said well I think if you're using
[34:01] the internet to um to better your faith
[34:05] in the things of God then you'd have to
[34:07] say it came from God wouldn't you
[34:09] wouldn't you say the printing
[34:11] press in its use when the Bibles now you
[34:16] didn't have to copy copy copy you can
[34:17] now print the Bibles so who's mad at
[34:22] that we can print more
[34:25] Bibles and wouldn't you say in the grand
[34:27] of things that's why the printing press
[34:31] was
[34:32] created to print God's
[34:35] word huh think about it what about the
[34:38] tape
[34:39] recorder it wasn't to listen to
[34:41] Bluegrass I tell you
[34:43] that I'm always hating on blueg grass
[34:46] but or jazz or rap the tape recorder was
[34:50] invented so that you can hear the voice
[34:53] of God in this last day now I'm coming
[34:58] as a preacher as a believer in the word
[35:00] and that's my position uh that's because
[35:03] that's how I relate to it the tape
[35:05] recorder in my life is so I can hear the
[35:08] prophet's voice for this last day
[35:10] Revelations 10:7 to be fulfilled so
[35:12] let's go a little bit further with the
[35:14] internet so or the advancement of
[35:19] technology I can consume this word in a
[35:24] way like never before I can I can
[35:29] actually take this
[35:31] message and listen to it in Spanish
[35:34] English French or whatever language it's
[35:37] in download it and compare it and hear
[35:41] it in my own language every not a two
[35:46] component not a tape and then a tape
[35:48] recorder one component voice it's right
[35:51] there for me to listen to and that's
[35:53] from this so who's mad at that who's
[35:58] benefiting from that I can sit down and
[36:02] I can take the entire uh scriptures the
[36:05] Greek diet log the message of the hour
[36:08] and see what brother random says before
[36:11] 63 after I can take the third pull what
[36:14] he said about the seals break it down
[36:17] the prayer lines open it up put it back
[36:20] together again listen to the tape uh
[36:23] know how long the tape is going to be
[36:26] can really ice it and take it in Parts
[36:29] you could never do that with a tape
[36:30] cassette how many know what I'm talking
[36:32] about you get that tape cassette you try
[36:34] to find that spot on the
[36:36] tape good luck brother you have to fast
[36:39] forward if wir and you went too far and
[36:41] fast forward and you fast forward okay
[36:43] somewhere in there and wait them days
[36:47] are over so tell me who's mad at
[36:50] that I can handle the message in a way
[36:54] that I've never been able to handle the
[36:56] message so for me I embrac
[37:00] that and and knowing that Satan wants to
[37:04] use that as well so this this
[37:09] um not sure why I got on to that but
[37:11] this uh consuming this um uh uh the the
[37:17] the message in the and the way that God
[37:19] has brought it brought it to us with the
[37:22] seed taste feel smell and he and the
[37:26] different avenues that we can wholly
[37:31] believe it it's it's a greater way for
[37:35] us to do that today than it ever has
[37:37] been and it's up to you I mean you can
[37:40] use the technology the way you want to
[37:42] use it that that's on you but if you
[37:45] have the technology and you do now and
[37:48] we use it for other
[37:51] things why can't I use it for the
[37:54] message and I believe that's why it was
[37:57] created for
[37:59] me think about it think about it the
[38:01] grand scheme of things God allowed it to
[38:04] be not while brother Brandon was here
[38:08] he's going off the scene and here we are
[38:09] with the message and the way that we
[38:11] have it years and years ago we couldn't
[38:15] preach a sermon and have it on the
[38:17] screen for the audience to hear it too
[38:19] and see it too but we have that how many
[38:21] like that should we take it away now
[38:25] some we feel like we couldn't have
[38:26] church now
[38:28] because it's quotes aing on the screen
[38:29] where's the quotes at on the screen and
[38:31] so
[38:33] that who who who does that help how does
[38:37] that make it better are you consuming it
[38:39] better so if you take these three rings
[38:43] as as you do what the prophet said and
[38:45] you draw those three rings then you
[38:47] realize your body your spirit and your
[38:51] soul um needs to take these Avenues and
[38:55] here what brother Bram says I know I'm
[38:57] not going to finish this but he says
[39:04] this in paragraph 104 in the message the
[39:08] greatest battle ever fought fought what
[39:10] was the matter you had to open up the
[39:12] Channel first you got to get the soldier
[39:15] the Holy Spirit placed at the
[39:17] Battlefront that takes God's word he is
[39:22] the word and he stands there there's
[39:26] nothing going to stop it then there's
[39:29] nothing that's what I was talking about
[39:30] the
[39:31] placebo the placebo effect in how people
[39:35] who feel like and believe that they're
[39:39] being helped from their medical doctor
[39:42] they do far much better than those that
[39:44] have a negative attitude oh man I knew
[39:47] it why ises this happen to me this is
[39:49] horrible it happened to my dad I knew
[39:51] this kind of things always happen to me
[39:54] you know that negativity ain't going to
[39:56] get you anywhere there's no value in it
[39:58] at all we are
[40:02] believers we're Christians so our
[40:06] confession should always be positive and
[40:09] never negative and if the natural things
[40:13] can produce those kind of results what
[40:15] about us when we take the word of God
[40:17] now this first Thessalonians let's take
[40:21] Ephesians chapter 4
[40:27] we read this for you on Sunday and I
[40:30] trust this will bless you again that you
[40:33] put off concerning the former
[40:35] conversation the old man Ephesians
[40:38] 4:22 which is corrupt according to the
[40:42] deceitful lust verse 23 and be renewed
[40:47] in
[40:49] what the spirit of your mind you need
[40:52] that to be
[40:54] renewed and that you put on the new man
[40:57] which is after God is created in
[41:00] righteousness and true
[41:02] Holiness wherefore putting away lying
[41:06] speak every man truth with his neighbor
[41:09] for we are members one of another be ye
[41:13] angry and sin not let not the sun go
[41:16] down upon your
[41:17] wrath neither give place to the devil
[41:22] one translation says don't give no
[41:26] opportunity neither neither give give no
[41:29] opportunity for the devil neither give
[41:31] place for the devil don't give him any
[41:34] opportunity any of your time any time
[41:38] that you could spend meditating on the
[41:40] Lord use it you know if you were sick or
[41:44] put on your bed of Affliction let's say
[41:46] your deathbed you had so much time to
[41:49] live you would go back and look at all
[41:51] the time you wasted and you should have
[41:53] been going in the things of the Lord
[41:55] that's what you would do as a believer
[41:57] you say oh my you know and I thought you
[42:01] know you know I got some bad I'm telling
[42:04] you testimony I got some bad news wasen
[42:06] bad news but it was just uh some
[42:09] stressful news uh this
[42:12] afternoon but this morning A friend of
[42:14] mine called a doctor a good friend of
[42:16] mine he called me young man and he said
[42:19] that he had he was diagnosed with
[42:22] cancer and it's like wow in light of him
[42:26] being diagnosed with cancer and then the
[42:28] bad news that I got really wasn't bad
[42:32] news that's bad news he has to take a
[42:36] month off of work for the treatment and
[42:38] he's got to go through all of the things
[42:40] and the fear and all of the thing with
[42:41] his family and all stuff and I'm
[42:43] thinking wow wow that's a that changes
[42:47] your day that changes your perspective
[42:51] and then you think well you know you
[42:53] have this whole day and it's some you
[42:54] get some news like that then you'll
[42:56] start to
[42:57] value did I really spend my time the way
[43:00] I should have neither give place to the
[43:05] devil your time here listen Saints you
[43:08] only got one life if you're not honest
[43:11] with God you're not gonna be honest on
[43:13] your job you won't be honest in your
[43:15] home you won't be honest in a lot of
[43:16] areas or if you're lazy here you'll be
[43:19] lazy over there you're lazy because you
[43:21] only got one life you don't have two or
[43:23] three different lives that you're living
[43:25] the life that you live is the life that
[43:27] that God gave you and if you take the
[43:29] life that he gave you seriously it'll
[43:32] translate in every Avenue of your
[43:35] life and these are just little reminders
[43:38] that the Lord gives us to put off
[43:41] concerning the former
[43:43] conversation neither give place to the
[43:45] devil verse 28 let him that stole steal
[43:48] no more but rather let him labor working
[43:51] with his hands of things which is good
[43:53] that he may have to give to him that
[43:56] needeth let no corrupt
[43:58] communication proceed out of your mouth
[44:02] but that which is good to the use of
[44:04] edifying that it may Minister Grace unto
[44:07] the
[44:07] hearers and grieve not the holy spirit
[44:12] of God whereby you're sealed unto the
[44:14] day of your
[44:16] Redemption 1 Thessalonians 5
[44:20] 2123 says prove all things hold fasted
[44:24] that which is good of stain from all
[44:29] appearance of evil you know that's not
[44:31] just the appearance of evil like how you
[44:34] might see me looking at something that
[44:36] might appear evil or doing something
[44:38] that might appear evil this is in light
[44:40] of God in the whole host of Heaven this
[44:43] is the eyes there's eyes watching you
[44:48] little eyes little eyes be careful what
[44:50] you see ears what you hear you know
[44:53] there's eyes that are watching you in
[44:55] your daily life in your your task the
[44:58] things you look at the things you laugh
[45:00] and the things you indulge in and then
[45:03] we come and we want the Holy Spirit to
[45:06] answer our prayer but our Spirits have
[45:09] been clogged up with these other areas
[45:13] now you got the three ring man you draw
[45:16] that out in your own mind that that man
[45:20] has to you know you got to you want that
[45:23] man to be cleaned up you want the inner
[45:26] conscience that manant to be holy
[45:29] following the Lord holy following the
[45:33] things of the word Asain from all
[45:35] appearance of evil and the Very God of
[45:37] Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God
[45:39] your whole spirit and soul and body be
[45:42] preserve
[45:44] blameless until the coming of the Lord
[45:47] Jesus and this is the real test is my
[45:50] spirit
[45:51] blameless are my intentions my
[45:54] motives my affections are they
[45:58] blameless you know that Spirit man he
[46:01] sees
[46:02] that and that's
[46:04] really the the important part it's not
[46:07] the part that you all can see of me it's
[46:10] the part that he sees because before the
[46:13] word we are all naked in his sight he
[46:18] sees us he scans right through us and we
[46:22] might say praise the lord we might lift
[46:23] our hand or we might even do a good deed
[46:27] but our intentions and our motives
[46:29] there's some greed there's some pride
[46:31] there's some temper there's some anger
[46:32] there's some lust there and then we just
[46:35] let it go on but you know I I don't want
[46:38] to let that go on I want my whole Spirit
[46:41] to be
[46:43] cleansed by the word and when I stand
[46:46] before him it'll be like I'm standing
[46:49] before before like my whole life is laid
[46:53] out right before you all of my thoughts
[46:55] laid out before the word and then if I
[46:59] can do that before the word I can lay
[47:01] that out before you too my life will be
[47:04] a clear clean life I don't have to hide
[47:07] anything I don't have to you know you
[47:10] know some areas of my you know whatever
[47:12] I'm doing I have to hide those things
[47:14] and so Lord
[47:17] Jesus um help us to move into that so
[47:20] brother brandom makes this statement you
[47:22] all remember it I'm not going to read it
[47:23] but you remember the statement that a
[47:25] man totally surrender to God is
[47:28] omnipotent how many you remember that
[47:30] how you heard that that's totally
[47:32] surrendered that's his body his spirit
[47:36] and his soul surrender to God that man
[47:42] is omnipotent Jesus said a kingdom
[47:45] divided against itself cannot stand so
[47:48] part of you are quoting the word you
[47:51] believe the message you believe every
[47:52] word but there's another part of you the
[47:55] black dog
[47:57] that's feeding on things that's that's
[48:00] not right it's Leo deia it's like you
[48:02] like they rate the movies it's a PG it's
[48:05] only a PG PG according to who who who
[48:09] rated that because a parent ain't a
[48:12] parent anymore they're not the same what
[48:15] we call parents in the 70s ain't parents
[48:18] today the parents ain't a man in a woman
[48:21] anymore so there's a PG rating or it's
[48:24] rated for all
[48:25] audiences B based on
[48:28] who I mean they can't even get it
[48:31] together on what is saying or what is
[48:35] pure or holy or clean or any they can't
[48:37] get it together so why would I listen to
[48:39] what Hollywood said was a good movie or
[48:43] safe
[48:45] movie it ought to be my spirit if I
[48:48] heard one swear word that that I turn
[48:51] that movie off I'm done with it
[48:54] huh is that too much yes too much if if
[48:59] I want to play games okay but I don't
[49:02] want to I don't want the angel of the
[49:04] Lord sitting next to me and the whole
[49:05] host of e Heaven sitting next to me and
[49:08] then I I'm watching the movie and then
[49:10] they start swearing and I'm like okay
[49:12] I'll just fast forward that part and
[49:14] that's fine it ain't worth it it's just
[49:17] not worth it's a kingdom divided against
[49:20] itself I'm trying to I'm trying to make
[49:22] the Rapture like in my soul and in my
[49:26] spirit and in my conscience I want my
[49:29] whole being for the
[49:32] Rapture and then I'm I'm feeding this
[49:35] you know junk food on the side and then
[49:37] I'm going in and trying to work out with
[49:39] the personal trainer and it's like man
[49:42] you cheating on your
[49:43] diet is this a couple Twinkies it's like
[49:47] those are no NOS you said you wanted to
[49:50] you said you
[49:51] wanted yeah you said you wanted to get
[49:55] in shape you said you wanted to be able
[49:57] to run up the hill you said you wanted
[50:00] to be in maximum physical health then
[50:04] you need to dedicate yourself to this
[50:06] diet right here and the men that do it
[50:09] they get the results from
[50:10] it what about in your
[50:13] spirit what about in your spiritual
[50:17] diet the Lord's dealing with me I'm
[50:20] going this way and that's the way I'm
[50:22] going to go that's it I'm I'm I God
[50:25] forgive me for my foolishness I let
[50:27] things slip and slide and play I know
[50:30] they're wrong I didn't say it but I
[50:32] indulged in it so I like I was okay with
[50:35] it
[50:40] too but give no place to Satan give no
[50:45] place to the devil now let me take this
[50:47] quote here at 7:58 I want supposed to be
[50:51] done by
[50:52] eight and thank you brother Chuck that
[50:56] means so much much tell me to take my
[50:58] time because everybody doesn't say that
[51:00] but it's okay but thank you couple
[51:04] more two more most if I get most of
[51:07] y'all to say it then those that don't
[51:09] say it then make them feel
[51:12] bad we got all night
[51:15] amen your spirit wants me to take my
[51:19] time the carnal man wants to get out of
[51:22] here and get home to get some sleep
[51:24] you'll get your sleep in the
[51:29] grave that's where you catch up with all
[51:31] your sleep but right now we're trying to
[51:34] get our souls ready for the
[51:36] Rapture
[51:37] huh is that serious or what is that true
[51:41] yeah that's true that's true no matter
[51:43] how you slice it so but we we don't want
[51:45] to worry out because this is a prayer
[51:46] meeting and I want to just read this two
[51:50] places in the message greatest battle

[52:33] see if your reason disagree with the
[52:36] word get away from it that's right the
[52:38] engine if your memory if your
[52:40] imaginations if your conscience anything

[53:33] Hallelujah the outlet blows a whistle
[53:37] glory to God it shines out certainly
[53:39] just as clean and clear for the word of
[53:42] God to work through the power of God see
[53:45] that's the main thing there's your
[53:48] Battleground your Battleground is back
[53:51] here at the beginning back here in the
[53:53] soul back in your mind that opens the
[53:56] mind is the gate to the soul the gate to
[53:59] the spirit rather your mind opens up and
[54:03] accepts the spirit or rejects the spirit
[54:05] you can have a little conscience and a
[54:07] little feelings and a little Sensations
[54:09] all these things that has nothing to do
[54:12] with it that's just little Sensations
[54:14] and things but when it comes to really
[54:16] your mind opens it up your mind either
[54:21] accepts it or rejects it that's it
[54:24] friends God let none of them miss it I
[54:30] like that God let none of them miss it
[54:33] see how the prophet just tries to bring
[54:35] you right along he's bringing it he's
[54:37] bring said God let none of them miss it
[54:40] and it's on the tape there God let none
[54:43] of them miss it I don't want to miss it
[54:45] I sure don't no no no paragraph 111 he
[54:48] says it's your mind that opens up the
[54:50] door or closes the door and listens to
[54:53] your conscience listens to your memory
[54:56] listens to your affections but when your
[54:59] mind closes itself to these things and
[55:02] let God the spirit of his word come in
[55:05] it blows the rest of the stuff out even
[55:09] every doubt is gone every fear is gone
[55:12] every sensation of Doubt is gone every
[55:15] feeling is gone there's nothing standing
[55:17] there but the word of God and Satan
[55:21] cannot battle against that no sir he
[55:25] cannot battle battle against it no we
[55:27] know that's true last place here
[55:31] paragraph number
[55:32] 128 last place I'll read all right there
[55:36] it is right there those channels you
[55:39] just get them open up don't just bypass
[55:42] them then if Satan can get through there
[55:45] get by these conscience and all these
[55:47] other things then he gets right down in
[55:49] here to the end of the soul and the mind
[55:52] now if he can just get you you'll never
[55:55] you'll never look at one of them until
[55:58] first you have to let him in
[56:05] here you have to let him
[56:08] in then when he gets in he gets
[56:12] control then what does he do he begins
[56:15] to use the conscience begins to use
[56:17] begin to use this Outlet what is it see
[56:20] taste feel smell he imaginations
[56:22] conscious so we let him in we stream it
[56:25] we download it we look at it it is our
[56:29] choice to do
[56:31] it you make the choice to look at what
[56:34] you look at feed on what you feed
[56:37] on uh subscribe to whatever you
[56:40] subscribe to that is that is on that's
[56:44] your decision to make it it's a horrible
[56:47] age yes it's so accessible it's terrible
[56:51] there's images there's all kind of
[56:52] things going on but you have to get get
[56:56] yourself to the place where you reach
[56:59] out and say yes I want to look at this
[57:01] and then when you look at that you open
[57:04] it up and then Satan gets in there and
[57:06] he starts doing whatever he wants to do
[57:09] and we have these mind
[57:11] battles and then our faith can't get
[57:13] where it needs to be and then we have
[57:16] temper and issues and little hates and
[57:19] little lust and little battles and then
[57:21] there just all kind of garbage clogging
[57:25] up our faith
[57:27] and we know that we know those things
[57:29] are wrong we don't want to do what's
[57:31] wrong but we're we're just in an age
[57:33] where it's so easy we slip right into it
[57:36] and the word of God comes forth to
[57:39] remind you to don't give place to the
[57:42] devil don't give him that time that
[57:45] place in your mind doesn't belong to him
[57:49] don't let him come in your mind and then
[57:51] you got to battle him out just keep that
[57:53] away you'll see enough without even
[57:56] looking at anything with your own
[57:58] efforts there'll be enough to battle
[57:59] just like that but it's just like it's
[58:01] just so polarizing the age that we live
[58:06] in and you
[58:08] know and I said this to the brother the
[58:11] pastor brother I was talking to I said
[58:14] brother 20 or 30 years ago the preachers
[58:19] in this message blasted the
[58:22] TV they call it the H Vision remember
[58:25] that
[58:26] the oneeyed devil how many remember that
[58:29] and many of us agree with that never
[58:31] have a TV in your home and we blasted
[58:34] that and the preachers blasted that and
[58:36] we agree with it and then like either
[58:40] they were wrong and Blasting it or they
[58:43] were right and what we're doing today is
[58:47] wrong I want you to look think about
[58:49] that just for a minute if it was wrong
[58:52] 30 years ago for a message
[58:56] Pastor let's put it in the pastor realm
[58:59] to sit up and watch a TV television
[59:04] movies on Saturday Friday whatever and
[59:07] you knew that would you have confidence
[59:09] him in him as a message Pastor 30 years
[59:13] ago think about it so if it was wrong
[59:17] then I'm just raising the point if it
[59:20] was wrong
[59:22] then wouldn't it be wrong today
[59:27] or or maybe they was wrong to blast the
[59:33] TV quick quick little testimony to Quick
[59:35] short quick one I'll close here I got to
[59:38] close I remember when I got saved first
[59:41] got saved in the Pentecostal Church me
[59:44] and my sister Kimberly had a room
[59:46] together we're both young people serving
[59:48] the lord little Pentecostal church and I
[59:51] was trying to receive the Holy Ghost she
[59:56] at at her baptism came out of the water
[59:59] speaking in tongues filled with the Holy
[1:00:01] Ghost and I thought man what's going on
[1:00:03] i' been searching searching trying to
[1:00:05] let the Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost
[1:00:06] anyways we had a room together I just
[1:00:08] bought a
[1:00:09] TV it had the remote it was Black TV
[1:00:13] really nice it was sharp and I just
[1:00:14] bought it and we would watch that and I
[1:00:17] forget it had 20 25 channels or whatever
[1:00:20] and I heard about some Pentecostals that
[1:00:23] were against the TV or watching it and
[1:00:26] this is a denomination and I thought huh
[1:00:29] it's not that bad our my pastor had one
[1:00:31] our Bishop had a TV it was just like be
[1:00:34] careful what you watch that kind of
[1:00:36] thing you know don't let it use
[1:00:38] you so I remember one afternoon it
[1:00:40] started to just bother me in my mind so
[1:00:44] every all the young people I knew all
[1:00:46] the church that I knew everyone had one
[1:00:48] it was okay but it started to bother me
[1:00:50] like maybe this is wrong so I I went to
[1:00:54] the Lord in prayer I said Lord if you
[1:00:57] want me to get rid of the TV I
[1:00:59] will
[1:01:01] but but I can't see where it's really
[1:01:04] wrong and so one afternoon I said well
[1:01:06] I'm going give this thing a try I said
[1:01:08] well Lord I I'll pray and I'll give the
[1:01:11] TV a chance it was about midday and so
[1:01:14] I'm g go through every one of these
[1:01:16] channels in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:01:20] if it's glorifying God or not then I'll
[1:01:23] make my decision whether I should keep
[1:01:25] this thing or not so I sat down on my
[1:01:27] couch one afternoon and I went through
[1:01:29] every one of those 25 30 channels and
[1:01:32] every one of them it was just
[1:01:34] foolishness you know advertising
[1:01:37] foolishness nonsense nothing about God a
[1:01:40] couple of religious channels I was like
[1:01:44] why do I have this I'm trying to you
[1:01:47] know then I was trying to speak in
[1:01:48] tongues for the Holy Ghost I was like I
[1:01:51] I don't need this so the Lord convicted
[1:01:53] my heart to get rid of it so
[1:01:56] my sister came home she's like what's
[1:01:58] going on I said I'm getting R into the
[1:02:00] TV she's like come on Israel you don't
[1:02:03] have to do all that well I already made
[1:02:06] up my mind it was my
[1:02:09] TV I have to get rid of it and so I sold
[1:02:12] it to kind of not a friend but a guy
[1:02:13] that I kind of
[1:02:15] knew and a month later it blew up
[1:02:19] anyways and I didn't give his money back
[1:02:21] either a deal is a deal
[1:02:24] so but that was the inner conflict that
[1:02:27] I had that was my own I had to come to
[1:02:30] that through prayer I gave it a chance
[1:02:32] it didn't pass a test for what I was
[1:02:35] trying to achieve in my life that's
[1:02:38] between me and God and so is the way you
[1:02:42] handle and use whatever you would look
[1:02:44] at that's between you and God but I want
[1:02:48] you to process that thought if it was
[1:02:50] wrong 30 or 40 years ago the TV and we
[1:02:54] used to blast it
[1:02:56] then maybe it's wrong today
[1:02:59] too
[1:03:00] and it's the TV on steroids
[1:03:05] today but you could take that same
[1:03:08] TV and use it to magnify the name of the
[1:03:13] Lord then I can see the use for it amen
[1:03:16] amen so give no place to the
[1:03:20] devil let's have the musicians come
[1:03:29] I'm trying to get my faith
[1:03:32] right you know you'll be working out
[1:03:35] with your faith I still remember the
[1:03:37] galante their two boys Joseph what was
[1:03:40] the other boy's name Daniel when when I
[1:03:43] just was coming to Phoenix visiting
[1:03:45] years ago way before I was married I
[1:03:47] stayed with them and they were so they
[1:03:50] they had a Neighbor Next Door that had
[1:03:51] weights and oh go over there brother
[1:03:54] Israel how much could you live and I I
[1:03:56] lifted all those weights and they were
[1:03:57] all just always with brag
[1:04:00] about the weights and I used to work out
[1:04:03] with weights and I told you all that I'm
[1:04:07] back in the gym on the weights uh of
[1:04:10] Faith the spiritual
[1:04:12] things and I remember working out when
[1:04:15] you're working out and you have a
[1:04:17] program you know your legs and those of
[1:04:19] you that work out know this is true as
[1:04:21] you're working out you're actually
[1:04:22] getting stronger but you don't know how
[1:04:24] strong you're getting
[1:04:26] so when you go to do your
[1:04:29] maximums you get on the bench and this
[1:04:32] was never clear the last time I did my
[1:04:36] Maxes the gentleman kept putting more
[1:04:38] weight on and I was surprised on how
[1:04:41] strong I
[1:04:42] was see because strength is it's not a
[1:04:48] number based upon what you desire what
[1:04:50] you want to be but if you were working
[1:04:52] out and you were putting the time in
[1:04:54] your muscle will will manifest that your
[1:04:57] body will manifest what you have been
[1:05:01] doing in the gym if you've been
[1:05:02] practicing working out it'll just come
[1:05:04] out and you will surprise yourself you
[1:05:07] don't know how strong you are and so you
[1:05:10] get start getting into these things of
[1:05:12] the word and your faith muscles will
[1:05:14] grow and grow and grow and when the
[1:05:17] enemy comes he's given you the victory
[1:05:20] already in his word and you just take
[1:05:23] that word and you just over come the
