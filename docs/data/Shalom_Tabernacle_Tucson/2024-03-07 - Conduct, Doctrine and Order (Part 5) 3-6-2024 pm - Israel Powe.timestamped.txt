[28:21] and we've been on the conduct for I
[28:24] think four services this will be number
[28:26] five and we'll take the scripture to get
[28:29] into what we want to talk about tonight
[28:31] before we go to
[28:33] prayer verse one I beseech you therefore
[28:35] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[28:39] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[28:42] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[28:47] reasonable
[28:48] service and be not conformed to this
[28:51] world but be
[28:53] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[28:56] that you may prove what is that good and
[28:59] acceptable and perfect will of God Amen
[29:04] what a powerful uh portion of scripture
[29:06] God bless you you may be seated powerful
[29:09] portion of
[29:10] scripture that it's in your mind how you
[29:14] need to look at this that that she that
[29:17] be not conformed to this world but be
[29:20] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[29:22] and we started this uh series of
[29:26] messages for the purpose purpose of
[29:28] building up pillars in the house of the
[29:32] Lord and making uh more stable Believers
[29:36] and bringing the Simplicity the nuts and
[29:39] bolts the bricks and the mortar of what
[29:42] makes a Christian church and a Believer
[29:44] and we started that with um our behavior
[29:49] and how um our life is not our own and
[29:53] that we come to Christ not join in a
[29:56] picnet but we come to to join in forces
[30:00] Darkness against light and um then we
[30:04] took a service on their our post of Duty
[30:06] read those scriptures for forsake not
[30:09] assembling of yourselves and then we
[30:12] went further deeper into that uh I think
[30:15] we took the post of Duty and two
[30:18] services and then we last Wednesday or
[30:22] the last time we spoke was on giving
[30:24] your best how we want to give God our
[30:28] best he deserves our best and tonight
[30:31] we'll we have a couple of more that we
[30:33] want to get to but tonight we're just
[30:34] going to talk on our dress code the way
[30:38] we dress and is is that important to God
[30:42] and it's it's kind of some one of those
[30:44] things where we assume everybody knows
[30:48] and we know that everybody has heard it
[30:50] uh we seem but it's interesting how
[30:53] little things slip our minds and it's
[30:55] just nice to read it again to go over it
[30:59] again and this idea about dress and
[31:03] dress code you'd ask yourself is God
[31:06] concerned with that and yes he is very
[31:09] concerned from the Old Testament coming
[31:12] all the way through um even to the
[31:15] message of the hour today so let's just
[31:18] take a scripture over in Exodus or I'm
[31:21] sorry in Genesis chapter 1 and verse
[31:26] chapter 3 three excuse me and this is
[31:31] when Adam have
[31:34] fallen him and Eve and verse 7 says and
[31:37] the eyes of them both were open and they
[31:40] knew that they were naked and they sold
[31:43] fig leaves together and made themselves
[31:46] aprons now a couple verses later in
[31:50] Genesis
[31:51] 3:21 the Bible says and unto Adam also
[31:54] and to his wife did the Lord God make
[31:57] coats of skins and clothed them so we
[32:01] see that sin was the original reason
[32:05] that anyone would need to cover
[32:06] themselves and the purpose for clothing
[32:09] is to cover your nakedness and when man
[32:12] sinned he realized that he took a fig
[32:16] Leaf him and him and uh Eve and they
[32:20] covered themselves because they were
[32:22] ashamed they had become aware of their
[32:26] nakedness
[32:27] and then God further goes on slays a
[32:30] lamb and then fully covers them with the
[32:33] lamb skins now this covering was their
[32:39] consciousness of the sin that they had
[32:41] committed and God further um institutes
[32:46] this covering in Exodus chapter 20 for
[32:49] the priest Leviticus chap 21 also he's
[32:54] talking about those that are in the
[32:56] priesthood
[32:57] Le Leviticus
[32:59] 19 um 19 that know that your garments
[33:03] should not be
[33:04] mingled and so um maybe we'll have time
[33:08] we'll read some of those but we we focus
[33:12] a lot on the women's dress a lot we hear
[33:16] that and the two main Messengers in the
[33:20] Bible were Timothy and or I'm sorry Paul
[33:23] to Timothy and the Apostle Peter
[33:27] and 1 Timothy Chapter 2 I'd like you to
[33:30] turn there in the
[33:32] scriptures in
[33:43] verse pardon
[33:47] me we'll turn to First what I call First
[33:51] Timothy
[33:55] yes
[34:04] say is it important well the Bible shows
[34:08] that it is
[34:09] important and there's a reason why first
[34:12] p in first
[34:18] Timothy two right yes in verse number
[34:23] nine let's start with verse seven says
[34:27] where unto I am ordained a preacher and
[34:31] an apostle I speak the truth in Christ
[34:34] and L not a teacher of the Gentiles in
[34:37] faith and Verity I will therefore that
[34:40] men pray everywhere lifting up holy
[34:42] hands without wrath and doubting in like
[34:46] manner also that women orain ORD Dorn
[34:51] themselves in modest apparl with
[34:54] shamefacedness and sobriety not with
[34:57] broed hair or gold or pearls or costly
[35:01] array but which becometh women
[35:03] professing godliness with good works let
[35:07] the woman learn in Silence with all
[35:10] subjection but I suffer not a woman to
[35:12] teach to nor to use up authority over
[35:15] the man but to be in silence so this is
[35:19] Paul telling to Timothy he's talking
[35:22] about the man lifting up holy hands and
[35:24] in prayer and then he gets right into on
[35:28] the women how they should Adorn
[35:30] themselves and then in 1 Peter chapter 3
[35:33] verses
[35:35] number I'll take verses 1 to 10 it
[35:39] says likewise you wives you can turn
[35:42] there it be nice if you did they might
[35:44] put it here too be in subjection to your
[35:47] own
[35:48] husband that if any obey not the word
[35:51] they also May without the word be one by
[35:54] the conversation of the wives while they
[35:57] behold your Chase conversation coupled
[35:59] with fear who adorning let it not be
[36:03] that outward adorning of platting of the
[36:06] hair and of wearing of gold or of
[36:09] putting on apparel but let it be the
[36:12] hidden man of the heart and that which
[36:15] is not corruptible even the ornament of
[36:18] a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the
[36:21] sight of God a great price for after
[36:25] this manner in the old times time the
[36:27] holy women also who trusted in God or
[36:32] Adorn themselves being in subjection
[36:35] unto their own husbands even as Sarah
[36:39] obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose
[36:43] daughters ye are as long as you do well
[36:46] and are not afraid with any amazement
[36:48] likewise ye husbands dwell with them
[36:51] according to the knowledge giving honor
[36:54] unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel
[36:57] and being hirs together of the grace of
[37:00] life that your prayers be not hindered
[37:03] finally be all of One mind have
[37:06] compassion one of another love as
[37:08] Brethren be pitiful be courteous not
[37:12] rendering evil for evil railing for
[37:14] railing but contrary wise blessings
[37:18] knowing that ye are there unto called so
[37:22] this is a calling you're call to that
[37:24] you should inherit a blessing for he
[37:27] that will love life and see good days
[37:31] let him refrain his tongue from evil and
[37:34] his lips that they speak no gal you know
[37:36] it's interesting how it's intertwin your
[37:40] prayers being hinded hindered in lifting
[37:43] up hands in prayer it's like it's a it's
[37:47] not just the natural thing that your
[37:51] outward dress as he approaches the women
[37:55] he's specific towards the women in this
[37:58] Paul and Peter and then we have brother
[38:01] brandom what can we say about
[38:03] him did do we need to speak clearer does
[38:07] can he can he say it any louder can he
[38:10] speak any clearer his position and
[38:14] stance and how the age has dictated to
[38:18] our women but it's also a spiritual
[38:21] condition of showing you the condition
[38:24] of the Church of the nation
[38:27] of what's going on you watch the women
[38:31] and there's a reason why because the
[38:33] original sin was centered around what we
[38:38] know was
[38:40] sex and the
[38:43] sexuality of the man and the woman and
[38:46] so now therefore those bodies have to be
[38:50] covered this is part of our covering the
[38:53] clothing was given to us to cover
[38:55] ourselves but Peter tells us and Timothy
[38:57] tells us that it should be in modest
[39:00] apparel modest clothing and that's for
[39:03] the purpose uh because in 1 John
[39:08] 2:15 it tells us to love not the world
[39:10] or the things of the world for all of
[39:13] the things of the world come through the
[39:16] lust of the flesh the pride of life and
[39:19] the lust of the eyes so what your eyes
[39:22] see can hinder and it deters you and so
[39:26] so as I have been going through this and
[39:28] we've heard many things I started to
[39:30] look back over just a Christian Nation
[39:34] like our nation and taking some of the
[39:37] historical points and brother brandom
[39:40] used this term called a beat neck and
[39:43] that beat neck that
[39:45] terminology was um you know there's a
[39:48] definition for it says a person who
[39:51] participated in the social movement of
[39:53] the 1950s and the early 60s
[39:56] which stressed Aristocrat Aristocrat and
[40:01] self-expression and the rejection of
[40:04] mores of conventional Society broadly
[40:08] usually young an artistic person who
[40:11] rejects the Moors of conventional
[40:15] society and you know brother Ram deals
[40:18] with that um beat neck group and that
[40:21] beat neck crowd also you see the rise of
[40:25] what was known as the rock and roll
[40:27] music that hit and many of these
[40:30] Superstars that help influence and
[40:34] remember our fashion started in Paris
[40:37] France and it landed in Hollywood and
[40:41] then from Hollywood through the movie
[40:43] industry it program it propagated it out
[40:47] to all so you didn't have to go to a
[40:49] concert to see Elvis Presley you could
[40:52] just get his record or his album you
[40:55] could see him on the
[40:57] one of the the the American band stand
[40:59] or whatever show was out in that day
[41:01] same thing with Marilyn rro the way she
[41:04] was propagated and way that influence
[41:07] through the television it spread out and
[41:10] it influenced the entire nation brother
[41:13] random deals with this and I shared it
[41:15] with the church here some time ago on
[41:18] the knee high took every quote on the
[41:21] knees and the knee high and where that
[41:24] started and and there's several quotes
[41:26] on it but brother Ram says it started in
[41:29] the Catholic
[41:30] church and he said the first song that
[41:33] they let slip through on the
[41:35] radio that was uncensored through this
[41:39] Clara Bow was rolm girle rolm girlly
[41:42] show your pretty knees and and that hit
[41:46] the radio and that influence hit and
[41:50] turned many many hearts and I want you
[41:53] to realize and recognize that you know
[41:56] when we're talking about uh a Dre a
[41:59] dress code that's kind of sounds like a
[42:01] bad word but it's the attire or a way
[42:04] that a man would Adorn himself or a
[42:07] Christian would Adorn themselves
[42:10] remember at the turn of the century when
[42:13] the Holy Ghost fell in theusa the
[42:15] Holiness churches the Pentecostal
[42:18] churches was the Holiness move and they
[42:21] believed in dressing properly many of
[42:24] them the men dressed properly the women
[42:27] dressed properly and they held on to
[42:30] that those Holiness standards and
[42:32] there's no scriptures that tells us to
[42:34] wear a tie or a suit or what is business
[42:38] professional or business casual there's
[42:41] no scripture that tells us exactly what
[42:43] to wear but we know right at the turn of
[42:46] the century that when the Holy Ghost
[42:48] poured out and then brother Ram's
[42:50] Ministry came in he was an example as to
[42:55] what we should follow and I want you to
[42:57] I want you to pay close attention that
[43:00] the the um the worldly church is not our
[43:05] example all right for music for dress
[43:08] for any of these behaviors in God's
[43:11] church God has given us an example and
[43:14] what has happened is the the Pentecostal
[43:17] churches many of them have moved from
[43:21] that Holiness those Holiness standards
[43:24] most all of the Pentecostal churches
[43:26] preach that it was wrong for a woman to
[43:30] wear pants they took this scripture out
[43:33] of
[43:35] Deuteronomy uh where is it at believe
[43:39] it's
[43:40] 22 verse five says this the woman shall
[43:45] not wear that which pertain it unto a
[43:47] man neither shall a man put on a woman's
[43:50] garment for all that do so are an
[43:53] Abomination unto the Lord if you take
[43:56] Che that whole chapter that's one of the
[43:58] first and I think it's the only time he
[44:01] God uses that terminology of an
[44:04] Abomination for a woman to put on a
[44:06] garment that pertains to a man or a man
[44:10] to put on a woman's garment and brother
[44:12] B told us those were shorts and a
[44:16] woman's garment is short and so you see
[44:18] men out there uh today one of the
[44:23] popular he's a billionaire I believe now
[44:26] he's a popular pretty much in a
[44:28] predominantly black church the first
[44:30] time I saw him I was a single man and my
[44:34] sisters invited me over to this comedy
[44:36] deal Christian Comedy it's clean
[44:39] Christian Comedy whatever I went there
[44:42] and this gentleman I I just don't want
[44:45] to mention his name but some of you
[44:48] because I mentioned him some of y'all
[44:49] know who I'm talking about tall black
[44:52] gentleman but his whole character was
[44:54] dressed as a woman
[44:56] hilarious it was funny I laughed we all
[45:00] laughed but then you start looking at
[45:03] that you say wait what is
[45:05] this we see you say well brother it's
[45:08] just it's just humor just comedy but the
[45:10] scripture said that's an
[45:13] Abomination but that was like 30 years
[45:15] ago 25 years ago 30 years now many of
[45:20] those churches that used to have a
[45:21] standard in the stand have closed
[45:25] they've open open up their arms to this
[45:27] whole homosexual agenda which is sexual
[45:32] indiscrepancy on another level it's all
[45:35] going to be based around sex okay and so
[45:38] they've opened up their pull pits now
[45:41] the churches are allowing it or they're
[45:43] not preaching against it it's just F
[45:45] small groups of them pockets of them one
[45:49] Bishop of the biggest black Pentecostal
[45:52] Church they had a bishop coming there
[45:54] Bishop I'll mention his name Bishop
[45:55] Bishop Carter got up there and preached
[45:58] and he and he let him have it I mean
[46:01] they let him preach and he got up and he
[46:02] start preaching about all the sissies on
[46:05] the
[46:05] organ homosexuals on the piano walking
[46:09] around their pocketbooks and their pink
[46:12] ties and all of these fashions that we
[46:14] think it's cute we think it's okay but
[46:17] all of it comes from somewhere it
[46:18] started somewhere and he blasted at and
[46:22] then tell me why the bishop of the
[46:24] organization had to come back and
[46:28] apologize to the world that everybody's
[46:32] welcome and you know he didn't express
[46:34] our views and so forth and so on but
[46:37] that just shows you you know and and
[46:40] many times as the church goes you'll see
[46:43] that's the way politics go many laws in
[46:46] this country like um the whole civil
[46:50] rights movement and the bridging of
[46:52] different colors and breaking those
[46:54] barriers that was was done by the move
[46:56] of the Holy Ghost when the Holy Spirit
[46:59] fell in those churches there um in Lost
[47:04] Angeles it it went across all color
[47:06] barriers you still had your segregation
[47:09] you still had your ideas but when the
[47:11] Holy Ghost Came Upon all colors and
[47:14] brought these Believers together then
[47:17] you know that you got to go to work
[47:19] somewhere and that puts pressure on the
[47:20] boss it puts pressure in society brother
[47:22] vandom dealt with it when he went up
[47:24] north he said they couldn't have it in
[47:26] the South because of segregation he had
[47:28] their meeting up north because they
[47:31] allowed the two groups to come together
[47:33] integrate which was an issue that it had
[47:36] to be dealt with but who who deals with
[47:38] that first who's the gatekeeper of those
[47:40] issues it's got to come from the church
[47:43] and I'll tell you right now that's the
[47:45] most important institution in any
[47:47] neighborhood is your church you might
[47:49] think it's some University out here but
[47:52] look what they've gone to tell me tell
[47:54] me they know where they're understanding
[47:56] they don't know who they are they don't
[47:58] know who a man is or what a girl is how
[48:01] many identities of genders do we have
[48:03] where's that coming from college
[48:06] degrees that's where it's coming from it
[48:09] ain't coming from little man on the
[48:11] altar that re that receive the Holy
[48:14] Ghost no no God keeps his church
[48:18] clean and those standards and the
[48:21] standard bearers have always been and
[48:25] will always be the local church yes sir
[48:29] yes sir if we let down the bars where
[48:32] are we going all
[48:35] right I I if if we the Church of the
[48:38] Living God that receive this message
[48:42] can't handle the word and live a life
[48:46] then who who's who's supposed to do that
[48:48] not the
[48:49] government so these issues are always be
[48:52] preempted and and God has always
[48:56] the holy spirit is always a move above A
[48:59] Step Above what they trying to work out
[49:02] out here out here what's right what's
[49:04] equal on God is always in top of that on
[49:06] charge of that it comes through the
[49:08] local church and so the Pentecostal
[49:10] church with all their great influence
[49:13] they let down the bars just on this one
[49:15] issue on wearing the pants I was a
[49:17] little boy in the Pentecostal church I
[49:20] was raised in a home that our people
[49:22] didn't our women didn't wear pants until
[49:26] I was well out of high school I believe
[49:29] I was in high school my 10th or 11th
[49:32] grade uh there were some of the pastors
[49:34] and preachers started preaching it was
[49:36] okay that was Old Testament this here
[49:41] the scripture that I'm talking about and
[49:43] then so you see that and you put that on
[49:45] steroids You See It Go On You See It Go
[49:47] on until you know I've just seen the
[49:51] deterioration with my own eyes and so
[49:55] why does does that happen that happens
[49:57] because the people that are supposed to
[49:59] keep the standards they let down the
[50:02] bars and then so this Council culture
[50:05] and this this uh um this um this uh
[50:11] group of people that want to go against
[50:15] the conventional standards it used to be
[50:18] that you would dress up to even go to
[50:20] the movie or catch an airplane flight or
[50:23] go out in public on the weekends
[50:26] man and wom look decent I'm talking
[50:28] about in this country I'm not I mean
[50:29] they' be smoking a cigar too but at
[50:32] least their dress was decent they
[50:35] recovered and now what do we have today
[50:38] it's just a
[50:40] loosed it's untapped untamed and I I
[50:43] took up this gentleman I used to like to
[50:46] listen to him well I I thought always
[50:49] thought he was a bright uh gentleman and
[50:51] he is but I really started to like him a
[50:54] little bit more uh since he started
[50:57] taking a stand for God in the Bible now
[50:59] it's this gentleman Jordan Peterson some
[51:02] of you have heard of him but he he he
[51:04] spoke on men's dress here um he's a
[51:08] Canadian psychologist and you all know I
[51:11] don't I'm not into quoting other people
[51:12] but I'm just showing what the worldly
[51:14] some of the worldly people are saying
[51:16] this gentleman he makes this statement
[51:18] that since the
[51:20] 1960s this has been
[51:23] downplayed as important
[51:26] its importance has been downplayed and
[51:28] they asked him what do you what would
[51:30] you blame that on and he said it's a
[51:32] reflection of the rebellious attitude
[51:36] towards anything that violates
[51:39] traditional
[51:41] Norms anything of patriotical Oppression
[51:45] or adulthood to eliminate or adopt a
[51:49] more what they call a more free
[51:53] individuality so we're more free to
[51:55] think how we want to and then he makes
[51:58] the statement most men look like they're
[52:03] children yeah but blowed
[52:09] up dad looks like a like like little
[52:12] Junior his shirt's untucked he looks
[52:16] horrible he's trying to be cool he's
[52:19] trying to be hip and that that that
[52:22] adulthood the the effort it takes
[52:26] to to look decent when you're in public
[52:30] it takes a little more effort and
[52:33] California has very been very
[52:36] influential on this
[52:39] loose
[52:41] flipflop sandals wearing men come on uh
[52:45] uh go anywhere dressed the same way
[52:49] anywhere and it really is a reflection
[52:53] of our age and our times and brother
[52:55] banham talks about this clar ofo and he
[53:00] and he he mentions that that was the
[53:03] start of many of the down the downward
[53:06] spiral and so forth and so this these
[53:11] scriptures that we read for you here um
[53:17] Leviticus 19 we'll just take one there
[53:19] let's let's just go to Deuteronomy just
[53:21] for a moment Deuteronomy
[53:24] 22
[53:28] he said does it matter well it's not my
[53:32] word I didn't write the Bible that's
[53:33] right it's God's
[53:35] word and God was so
[53:38] concerned even with the seeds that were
[53:42] planted in the
[53:43] field the clothes that you
[53:46] wore um how you plowed your field he he
[53:51] told him don't plow the field with the
[53:54] ass and a eye
[53:56] he told him don't mingle cotton with uh
[54:00] L with your linen with your with your um
[54:04] um with your cotton your wool and your
[54:07] linen don't blend those together he very
[54:10] specific and where is this control
[54:13] coming from was this Moses's idea this
[54:16] was God's idea and God put these laws in
[54:20] there and he instituted to these people
[54:23] because they were coming out of Egypt
[54:25] and he specifically told them I do not
[54:28] want you to pick up their ways where
[54:30] you're coming from and where you're
[54:32] going in a Land of strangers I don't
[54:35] want you to pick up their ways either I
[54:38] am the Lord and I'm going to establish
[54:40] these commands and blessings to you and
[54:44] if you hear them and you adhere to them
[54:47] you will be blessed takes a little bit
[54:50] more effort you got to open up your ears
[54:53] and find out what's going on but he's
[54:56] the one that's in
[54:58] charge and this idea that you know that
[55:01] I'm free and I can do whatever I want
[55:05] it's amazing that everybody that's free
[55:07] that's doing whatever they want how why
[55:09] they all look the
[55:13] same they all be bop the same they drive
[55:16] their car the same they R sit back in
[55:18] the seat the same they kick it they do
[55:20] whatever it all look the same where
[55:22] that's coming from where's the
[55:24] individual ity on
[55:26] that so so and I I'm very aware that
[55:30] there are styles that come in and
[55:33] there's different uh things that are in
[55:35] for style but um but when there's these
[55:39] great changes in how we approach God and
[55:44] how we come dressed to the house of the
[55:47] Lord then you need we should ask
[55:49] ourselves where did that come from yeah
[55:51] first of all the prophet here I love
[55:54] this picture because he's got on the tie
[55:57] he's got a little pocket
[55:59] square oh that's too dressy brother
[56:02] brother John that's too dressy well what
[56:04] example are you
[56:07] following did he wear
[56:10] cufflinks don't nobody say Amen it's all
[56:13] right he wore the
[56:16] cufflinks he was a
[56:18] gentleman and he dressed
[56:22] decently could you imagine brother ROM
[56:25] coming to the pull pit like some of
[56:27] these Mega pastors today with no the
[56:30] open collar and the muscle shirt on and
[56:35] the jeans pants with the leather
[56:37] whatever to match so you look so cool
[56:39] and hip and just open up that front
[56:42] button so we can see your raggedy
[56:46] chest as you're so cool and comfortable
[56:49] and making everybody feel welcome who's
[56:53] welcome that's right who you bringing in
[56:55] you you you you widen up the you widen
[56:58] up that loose atmosphere they come loose
[57:01] they stay
[57:05] loose God has a
[57:08] standard and his standard has always
[57:10] been his word and James tells us take
[57:14] for your example the
[57:17] prophets James tells us that take for
[57:21] example the prophet so let's take
[57:23] Deuteronomy 22 let's see how much God
[57:25] cares about some of these things this is
[57:28] the Old Testament just Shadows but he
[57:31] instituted it in verse
[57:37] number three in like manner shalt thou
[57:40] do with his ass and so shalt thou do
[57:43] with the reignment with all the Lost
[57:45] thing of thy Brothers which he lost thou
[57:48] H has found shalt thou do likewise thou
[57:50] mayest not hide thyself Thou shalt not
[57:53] see thy brother's ass or as Ox fall down
[57:55] by the way and hide thyself from them
[57:58] Thou shalt surely help him to lift them
[58:01] up again the woman shall not wear that
[58:04] which pertaineth unto a man neither
[58:06] shall a man put on a woman's garment for
[58:09] all that do so are an Abomination unto
[58:12] the Lord thy God listen to this one this
[58:15] one really got me if a bird's nest
[58:18] chance to be before thee in the way in
[58:21] any tree or on the ground whether they
[58:24] be young ones are eggs and the Dam
[58:26] sitting on the Young and upon the eggs
[58:29] Thou shalt not take the dam with the
[58:32] young but Thou shalt in any wise let the
[58:35] dam go and take the young to thee why
[58:39] that it might be well with thee and that
[58:42] thou mayest prolong thy
[58:46] days he's talking about a
[58:49] bird you see a bird sitting on his eggs
[58:53] God puts a law in in there don't take
[58:56] them both be so so and you obey this so
[59:00] that your days will be
[59:03] prolonged now the god that we
[59:08] serve is a very detailed God you think
[59:12] of the the whole solar system and the
[59:14] way the stars are out there even our
[59:17] bodies the way they're built and make up
[59:19] made up this muscular system and the
[59:22] blood and our Heartbeats and even our
[59:25] brains is just so
[59:28] complex that it takes a specialist for
[59:32] different parts of your body to really
[59:35] know how to really work with you and
[59:38] that's just a human being and this is
[59:40] the god of
[59:41] creation and this is the god who has
[59:44] instituted his laws to Israel and he's
[59:48] presenting them even on how the priests
[59:51] should come and how they should be
[59:53] dressed
[59:55] let me ask you if those details that
[59:58] make God who he is if those details have
[1:00:02] changed or is he the still the
[1:00:06] same is God still a god of
[1:00:10] details is he a god of small things of
[1:00:13] the little
[1:00:14] things he's very well put together thank
[1:00:17] the Lord and and um his word just how
[1:00:23] it's formatted and brought to us the way
[1:00:26] he shadows and types things and then he
[1:00:29] brings it back again in another way and
[1:00:31] then he reveals it in another way and
[1:00:34] then he opens it up and then he preaches
[1:00:35] you the gospel in the stars and then he
[1:00:38] preaches it in the pyramid then he
[1:00:40] preaches it through a man then he
[1:00:42] preaches it through his word so many
[1:00:45] different layers and levels to the god
[1:00:47] that we
[1:00:50] serve and I believe that those um
[1:00:53] details are still in our God and the
[1:00:56] standard that God has given to us in
[1:00:58] this day I believe we should be a little
[1:01:01] bit more um aware and conscience of of
[1:01:06] those things now why the women so
[1:01:11] much they asked brother bam that
[1:01:13] question in the
[1:01:16] cood and he deals with it and this is
[1:01:19] what he says
[1:01:23] here
[1:01:28] paragraph It's question number 408 and
[1:01:31] questions and answers is why is it that
[1:01:34] we make so much a big issue of women's
[1:01:38] dress oh I'm getting it on this one
[1:01:40] ain't I said big issue on women's
[1:01:43] dressing and cutting of
[1:01:46] hair and do nothing said about the hair
[1:01:49] of the man or the way he dresses well
[1:01:51] sister I'm going to agree with you one
[1:01:55] thing first place the Bible said that a
[1:01:57] man should not have long hair and if he
[1:02:00] had long hair I tell him just the same
[1:02:02] as I tell you he's wrong but most men a
[1:02:06] lot of them like men don't have any at
[1:02:09] all like me don't have any at all but
[1:02:12] most men cut their hair look like men
[1:02:15] and now if they didn't do it they'd be
[1:02:18] told not to do so to leave their hair
[1:02:22] grow out like a woman's hair
[1:02:25] you'll get all of this in marriage and
[1:02:27] divorce vows and things when we preach
[1:02:29] on it the big issues such as man's or
[1:02:32] women's dressing now a man the first
[1:02:36] place of man's body is not a Temptation
[1:02:39] like a
[1:02:41] woman now man he's big old hairy legs
[1:02:45] knock kned pot tumed and everything he's
[1:02:49] a horrible looking mess and there's
[1:02:51] nothing about him in temptation
[1:02:55] I heard somebody say
[1:02:57] Amen but you know what it's some
[1:02:59] feminist looking men now it's some sorry
[1:03:02] looking men they really into how they
[1:03:06] look very fingernails
[1:03:11] filed like they got some gloss or
[1:03:13] something on them a
[1:03:16] shine just cute and getting prettier I'm
[1:03:20] talking about men
[1:03:23] sissified
[1:03:24] where does that Spirit come from yes sir
[1:03:28] yes sir you know you know the the reason
[1:03:31] why we wear the things that we wear in
[1:03:34] many cases is because we want someone to
[1:03:38] look at us a woman dresses that way to
[1:03:42] show her flesh or to show parts of her
[1:03:45] body men do it too for the
[1:03:48] eyeballs they want someone to look at
[1:03:50] them they might not even they might not
[1:03:52] even want you to get their phone number
[1:03:55] am I even I've seen them get out of
[1:03:56] their cars at the store and different
[1:03:58] places and they get out and they're
[1:04:00] looking around waiting for somebody
[1:04:02] everybody's wearing the spandex whatever
[1:04:04] you call it and they get out and they
[1:04:07] swing and they're looking for attent
[1:04:10] could be from another woman could be
[1:04:12] from another man don't matter just so
[1:04:13] somebody looks at
[1:04:15] them or else why else do they dress that
[1:04:19] way they dressed that way because they
[1:04:21] want the attention they want those AR to
[1:04:24] look at them and this is part of the
[1:04:27] Great uh Temptation that Satan uses
[1:04:30] brother vam says here
[1:04:34] um pot tummy everything he's a horrible
[1:04:37] looking mess there's nothing about him
[1:04:38] for Temptation and I think he looks the
[1:04:41] gamest looking sight to see these men
[1:04:44] come down the road young or old with a
[1:04:48] pair of these bikinis on whatever it is
[1:04:51] you know walking down the road I think
[1:04:53] that's the dirty Prest looking site me
[1:04:56] too I ever looked at that's right I
[1:05:00] think he don't know what site of the
[1:05:02] race he belongs on that's right that's
[1:05:05] right a man that'll do a thing like that
[1:05:09] you know what I just heard a few months
[1:05:10] ago the American Army is going to dress
[1:05:12] that way yeah the army's coming out next
[1:05:16] year or year after next all in shorts
[1:05:19] how big a bunch of sissies can we get
[1:05:23] God made a man to look like a man act
[1:05:26] like a man dress like a man he made a
[1:05:29] woman to do the same dress like a woman
[1:05:32] act like a woman be like a woman about
[1:05:35] this morning the question come up the
[1:05:38] tape goes on if a woman I wonder if they
[1:05:42] have yeah if a woman's got real thin
[1:05:45] hair he goes on about if she wants to
[1:05:47] add some hair to that and so brother Ram
[1:05:51] continues
[1:05:53] on he calls it a rat
[1:05:56] or a thing that you know is kind of
[1:05:58] comical how he says it but he's bringing
[1:06:01] in why you know it wasn't uh the big
[1:06:05] issue the the the big issue around the
[1:06:08] women's dress this is why Paul deals
[1:06:11] with it Peter deals with it and brother
[1:06:13] brandom deals with it because that was
[1:06:16] the original sin amen that's what it's
[1:06:19] surrounded around that's the whole
[1:06:22] pressure is this is this sin the
[1:06:27] original sin to get the Sons and
[1:06:29] Daughters of God to fall brother random
[1:06:32] said they actually became prettier today
[1:06:36] than they've ever been the average woman
[1:06:39] has become prettier through these
[1:06:42] whatever things that they have today and
[1:06:44] they're just you know for beauty for
[1:06:48] part of the fall and that's that's
[1:06:51] absolutely by Design let's take 1 John 2
[1:06:54] 215
[1:07:12] quickly brother brandom
[1:07:15] called Satan evees
[1:07:20] designer that was her
[1:07:22] designer the woman's designer 1 John 2
[1:07:26] verse 15 says love not the world neither
[1:07:30] the things that are in the world if any
[1:07:33] man love the world the love of the
[1:07:35] father is not in him for all that is in
[1:07:37] the world the lust of the flesh lust of
[1:07:40] the eyes and the pride of life is not of
[1:07:44] the father but is of the world and the
[1:07:48] world passeth the way and the lust
[1:07:51] thereof but he that doeth the will will
[1:07:54] of God abideth
[1:07:57] forever so we see that the way we dress
[1:08:03] speaks on who we are it
[1:08:06] identifies our attitude of wherever
[1:08:09] we're going whoever we're approaching
[1:08:12] our thoughts towards the people that we
[1:08:15] meet the way we dress it identifies
[1:08:18] what's going on in the inside of us um
[1:08:21] we're not talking about you have you
[1:08:24] don't have clothes to wear we're talking
[1:08:26] about you took the clothes that you do
[1:08:28] have and you
[1:08:30] choose to wear the clothes that you're
[1:08:32] wearing now you choose you make a
[1:08:35] conscious choice for most of us in this
[1:08:37] country this may change this might be
[1:08:40] different for another culture I can't
[1:08:43] really speak on a third world culture I
[1:08:46] can't really speak on you know one of
[1:08:48] the other you know other nations around
[1:08:50] the world maybe in Asian culture or
[1:08:54] another culture that speaks of on the
[1:08:56] islands and so forth I'm talking about
[1:08:58] in the American culture the American
[1:09:01] Church where the last move of God came
[1:09:05] in isza Street and then this great
[1:09:09] message and how the churches had a
[1:09:12] standard and they've fallen down from
[1:09:15] that standard every single
[1:09:18] year and it's it's not long before
[1:09:24] everything the denominations are doing
[1:09:26] you get those influences trying to come
[1:09:29] here to the men's hairstyles to the
[1:09:32] women the way they dress to the the
[1:09:36] tight tight
[1:09:38] suits and the tight and and the you know
[1:09:41] this whole uh dressing is what we see we
[1:09:45] see it out there but we don't want that
[1:09:47] to be our standard is that right and so
[1:09:50] who's supposed to be an example in this
[1:09:52] city of of how a Christian is to
[1:09:56] dress I'm talking about
[1:09:59] who if upon on the earth in this city
[1:10:04] Who as a young man or a young couple or
[1:10:07] young lady if we're going to point out
[1:10:09] an example on how they dress what group
[1:10:13] of people should know
[1:10:16] that who's been giv the light on
[1:10:20] that and if the group of people here
[1:10:22] today don't don't care or it don't
[1:10:25] matter then God have mercy yes you know
[1:10:32] there's I think I sent a link out on to
[1:10:35] some of you and some of you have been
[1:10:36] getting these testimonies on brother
[1:10:38] Billy
[1:10:39] Paul bil Billy Paul's testimony how many
[1:10:42] you heard some of those we'll play some
[1:10:45] more for you if the Lord willing but
[1:10:48] remember that time he talks about he was
[1:10:50] getting dressed to go to the meeting and
[1:10:53] he said said it he had on a I think he
[1:10:55] said he had on a
[1:10:56] black uh he had on white jacket with
[1:10:59] black pants and some kind of shoes and
[1:11:03] he was dressed up pretty sharp and his
[1:11:06] daddy asked he says
[1:11:07] Billy where are you going he says he
[1:11:11] said I'm going getting ready to go out
[1:11:12] to the meetings to hand out prayer cards
[1:11:15] and he says oh you look
[1:11:17] nice uh I thought you were going out to
[1:11:20] to a party or
[1:11:21] something and he says
[1:11:24] he says no this is did he said are these
[1:11:26] the only clothes that you brought Billy
[1:11:28] like no I brought my suit he says okay
[1:11:31] and he says is you know just the way
[1:11:33] brother Billy tells it it was just so
[1:11:35] gentle and so nice and he told he said
[1:11:37] brother bam told him he says you can
[1:11:39] hear it on the testimony he says he says
[1:11:41] Billy why don't you go put on your suit
[1:11:44] because we're representing the greatest
[1:11:46] thing that can be represented the Lord
[1:11:49] Jesus Christ so this was just a
[1:11:52] multicolored out outfit that he had on
[1:11:54] it looked sharp but brother brandham had
[1:11:57] him to change it this is Brother Billy
[1:12:01] Paul's testimony which I believe is
[1:12:03] true and if if brother Brandon was
[1:12:06] conscience like that of his ministry and
[1:12:09] his name and what he was
[1:12:11] representing so this is what happens if
[1:12:15] if if the standard is here then people
[1:12:20] mainly will come and live right up to
[1:12:22] that oh you said at 12:00 so we got in
[1:12:25] at 12:05 something like that you stretch
[1:12:28] the limits just a little bit so if the
[1:12:29] standard is here people live just what
[1:12:32] if this what if the standard is way down
[1:12:34] here well that's where the people are
[1:12:35] going to live and I'm so glad that the
[1:12:38] example that we have that is given to us
[1:12:42] he didn't let down the
[1:12:43] bars brother bam didn't let down the
[1:12:48] bars and so what should who who what
[1:12:51] should be our example now I I do give I
[1:12:55] know that we're not all supposed to look
[1:12:58] like you know look the same we do have
[1:13:00] our individual Styles and so forth and
[1:13:02] we want to look nice and you can look
[1:13:05] nice without looking like the
[1:13:08] world I believe
[1:13:11] that
[1:13:15] amen First Corinthians 6:19 and 20 says
[1:13:20] what know ye not that your body is the
[1:13:23] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[1:13:27] which you have of God and ye are not
[1:13:31] your
[1:13:32] own I want everybody to read that are
[1:13:35] you can you see that on the screen thank
[1:13:37] you so much they do a good job back
[1:13:39] there for you are bought with a price
[1:13:42] therefore glor therefore glorify God in
[1:13:45] your body and in your spirit which are
[1:13:49] Gods now salvation is so beautiful that
[1:13:53] it comes to you right where you are no
[1:13:57] matter how you're dressed no matter
[1:13:59] where you are when salvation comes to
[1:14:02] you it comes to your life it comes into
[1:14:04] your
[1:14:05] heart and these issues I won't even call
[1:14:10] them salvation issue
[1:14:13] salvation is a work that he did at
[1:14:16] Calvary a finished work and you accept
[1:14:19] that but your service to him and what
[1:14:23] willing to give up and really look at
[1:14:28] what the overall big picture in the
[1:14:30] effect of what you're
[1:14:33] doing starting even with the way that
[1:14:35] you
[1:14:36] dress how God sees that and it's very
[1:14:40] very
[1:14:41] important and I think we should be more
[1:14:43] conscious and aware of it especially in
[1:14:46] such a loose and elax atmosphere that
[1:14:48] we've seen today it's very loose very
[1:14:51] laxed and it's just just going to get
[1:14:53] looser and looser let's take 1
[1:14:55] Corinthians
[1:15:03] 11 interesting the Lord Jesus doesn't
[1:15:05] speak too much about clothing
[1:15:09] huh he let His prophets do that
[1:15:15] huh now look at this order here and
[1:15:17] we'll get into this under the order and
[1:15:20] under the gatekeep keepers part of this
[1:15:23] this little I'm going to take five 10
[1:15:26] more minutes all right right now I
[1:15:28] Praise You Brethren that you remember me
[1:15:30] in all things first Corinthians but I
[1:15:32] would have you know verse three that the
[1:15:35] head of every man is Christ the head of
[1:15:37] the woman is the man the head of Christ
[1:15:40] is God every man praying or prophesying
[1:15:44] having his head cover dishonor his head
[1:15:48] but every woman that prayeth or prophesy
[1:15:51] with her head un un covered dishonor her
[1:15:55] head for that is even all one as if she
[1:15:59] were shaven for if the woman be not
[1:16:02] covered let her be also Shor but if it
[1:16:06] be a shame for a woman to be Shor or
[1:16:10] shaven let her be covered for a man in
[1:16:14] indeed ought not to cover his head
[1:16:17] talking about his hair long hair for as
[1:16:19] much as he is the image and glory of God
[1:16:23] but the woman is the glory of the man
[1:16:25] for the man is not of the woman but the
[1:16:27] woman of the man neither was the Man
[1:16:29] created for the woman but the woman for
[1:16:32] the man for this cause ought the woman
[1:16:35] to have power on her head because of the
[1:16:40] Angels nevertheless neither is The Man
[1:16:44] Without The Woman neither the woman
[1:16:46] without the man in the Lord for as the
[1:16:49] man is of the woman even so is the man
[1:16:52] also by the the woman but all things of
[1:16:55] God judging yourselves is it commonly
[1:16:59] that a woman pray unto God
[1:17:02] uncovered does not even nature itself
[1:17:05] teach you that if a man have long hair
[1:17:07] it is a shame unto him but if a woman
[1:17:11] have long hair it is her glory to her
[1:17:13] for her hair is given for
[1:17:17] what for covering but if any man seems
[1:17:21] to be contentious we have no such custom
[1:17:24] neither the Churches of God so here's a
[1:17:27] New Testament scripture the Apostle Paul
[1:17:31] great Apostle to the
[1:17:33] Gentiles he took the place of Judas
[1:17:35] really under the 12 God used him
[1:17:38] mightily and here he is instituting
[1:17:41] what's the big deal about your hair
[1:17:44] what's the big
[1:17:45] [Music]
[1:17:46] deal you know it's just hair it's like I
[1:17:49] cut my nails and you I can shave it I
[1:17:51] can do it this way I can do my I hearing
[1:17:53] why is it a big deal well it's a big
[1:17:55] deal because God said it was a big
[1:17:59] deal and these natural things they move
[1:18:03] right over into spiritual
[1:18:08] things remember in Timothy and in Peter
[1:18:13] it
[1:18:14] says uh to give honor to your wife and
[1:18:17] go on it goes on and says that your
[1:18:19] prayers be not hindered that's right he
[1:18:22] goes from women's clothes to your
[1:18:24] prayers being
[1:18:26] hindered and he goes to the examples so
[1:18:29] were the women in the old time that's
[1:18:31] the way they that's the way they
[1:18:33] dressed and here we have God's
[1:18:35] fingerprint all through the Old
[1:18:37] Testament on how to do and what to do
[1:18:40] and what not to do and all those details
[1:18:43] that he put in there and then somehow
[1:18:46] today it doesn't matter anymore if the
[1:18:50] let the world let the worldly church
[1:18:51] tell you that
[1:18:53] say it doesn't
[1:18:55] matter well it does
[1:18:58] matter and the Church of the Living God
[1:19:00] knows it does matter and the Church of
[1:19:03] the Living God you know a man is called
[1:19:05] to be a Christian in this hour sometimes
[1:19:08] we we put the pressure on the preacher
[1:19:10] it is true if you're called to be a
[1:19:12] preacher there's a life there's a
[1:19:14] standard there's a an example the people
[1:19:17] are watching you and looking at you but
[1:19:20] but also a man appr priest in the Old
[1:19:23] Testament and where we are on this side
[1:19:26] of Grace and Truth after Calvary we are
[1:19:29] Kings and Priests
[1:19:31] today offering the sacrifice of praise a
[1:19:34] spiritual
[1:19:36] sacrifice and if it was a deep I mean if
[1:19:40] we had time you can read it but if you
[1:19:42] took the time and just read in
[1:19:45] um in
[1:19:49] um Exodus
[1:19:51] 20
[1:19:53] that we'll take two of these and then
[1:19:56] we'll close Exodus 20 verse 26 all
[1:20:14] right verse 25 it says and if thou Wilt
[1:20:18] make me an altar of stone Thou shalt not
[1:20:20] build it of hun stone for th th lift up
[1:20:23] thy tool upon it thou Hast polluted it
[1:20:26] neither shall thou go up by steps unto
[1:20:30] my altar that thy nakedness be not
[1:20:33] discovered thereon take Exodus
[1:20:43] 28 you see brothers that's just old
[1:20:45] that's just the Old Testament well let's
[1:20:47] not read it then let's get rid of the
[1:20:49] Old Testament if it's just the Old
[1:20:51] Testament
[1:20:54] somebody instituted it who
[1:20:57] did it's the very nature and character
[1:21:00] of God he he brought this to us Exodus
[1:21:03] 28 and this is just to show us where
[1:21:06] this where this came from where this all
[1:21:09] starts and how you can see the the
[1:21:12] standards that uh the message brings to
[1:21:15] us today Exodus 28: 42 and thou shalt
[1:21:19] make them linen breaches to cover their
[1:21:22] nakedness from the loins even unto the
[1:21:25] thighs they shall reach and they shall
[1:21:28] be upon Aaron and upon his sons when
[1:21:31] they come into the Tabernacle of the
[1:21:33] congregation and when they come near un
[1:21:35] the altar to minister in the Holy place
[1:21:38] that they bear not iniquity and
[1:21:41] die it shall be a statue forever unto
[1:21:45] him and his seed after
[1:21:48] him so we thank God for his word these
[1:21:53] um these
[1:21:55] places you you go into
[1:21:58] court there's there's a judge there's a
[1:22:00] setting there's a there's a there's a
[1:22:03] certain
[1:22:05] professionalism there's a standard there
[1:22:07] at least in this country they um uh some
[1:22:12] of the the law law enforcement and our
[1:22:17] military and um things of great great
[1:22:21] importance are structured and they have
[1:22:23] an order to them and there's a
[1:22:26] discipline that goes with it and and
[1:22:29] I'll be honest yeah it takes a little
[1:22:31] more effort to dress it's so much easier
[1:22:34] just to throw on a T-shirt and come out
[1:22:36] here I mean wouldn't that be great if we
[1:22:38] all came in a
[1:22:39] t-shirt well no I don't think that would
[1:22:41] be great at
