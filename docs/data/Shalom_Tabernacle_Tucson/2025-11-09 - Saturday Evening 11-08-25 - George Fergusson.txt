Um, tomorrow morning, our dear brother David McGary, um, I wanted to call him an elder, but I don't think he likes that too much. Um, because he said, "The elders means you're the next one to leave." Something like that, he said. But we certainly appreciate his elderly youth. Let's call him an elderly young person. And so, he will be ministering for us tomorrow morning. We thank him for making the sacrifice him and his dear wife. I know they were in out of the country in in uh Zambia just not too long ago and he accepted the invitation on very very short notice and so we want to pray for him that the Lord will bless him uh for what we have what we have need of tomorrow morning.

[applause] And all these brothers are covered. Brother Isaiah Brooks. Brother Isaiah Brooks is a very fine singer. He's a very fine preacher as well. &gt;&gt; And he heard about the meetings and he um came to join us. [clears throat] So I appreciate that. [applause] When COVID struck, we had we wanted to do a little outreach me uh meeting on the streets because they had closed their churches. Tucant was still allowed to meet and gather. We didn't know exactly how to do that. And I called brother Brooks and he joined. He brought his tamarine and a few brothers. We went on the street corner there, two services, Friday and a Saturday. And um um there were two people that came out. There was an Asian guy that came and we baptized him. And then another guy, there's a little homeless guy. Remember him drinking? He still comes to church here. His name is brother. His name is Doug. [applause] Amen. So we call him home. He's not homeless, but he looks homeless. And so we call him homeless brother Doug. But he comes to church. He sits right there. And uh he just called me today. Pastor Israel. Pastor Israel. And so, God bless him. God bless brother Brooks for joining us. And so, without further ado, we're going to uh ask you all to stand and have brother Ferguson come and take the pulpit at this time, minister to words of life. 40 plus years over that in pastoring and missionary work and established several churches in Canada, east and western part. very instrumental in the work the French work of brother Brandham's message going to the French-speaking countries of the world for many many years and um we thank the Lord for him he's a celebrity in the Congo and any French-speaking country they know brother George Ferguson because he's given his life to getting brother Brandham's message to those folks &gt;&gt; when you have it in your language we kind of take it for granted, but to get it into your language from English into French, there has to be instruments of men that God uses for that. And he is one of them sitting right here behind us. And so I always respect him and honor him. I know him personally and I try to not to rush him too much, but we want to rush him a little bit tonight because we don't want to go too long. But I love to hear him his testimonies and uh and and so we are so happy for him to be with us. And so as he prepares to come, let's sing Amazing Grace. [music] That's his oldest daughter on the piano right there. Sister Sharon Ferguson po amazing grace how sweet the sound that Say [music] [music] I [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, I believe you're happy and you know it. God bless you all. [music] But I'll I I'll try to take my time and hurry up, whatever that means. Well, it's really an honor to be here with you and I feel a little bit humbled with some of these what I would call great preachers and some, you know, no preacher love to hear that he's a great preacher. And I told one preacher said, "You're a great preacher." And I think brother George is a great preacher. &gt;&gt; Now, he doesn't agree with me. All right, I'll ask him one question and he'll change his mind. Brother Brandham says, "No, I will ask you a question. When you minister, does the presence of the Lord come? But brother Bannon says, great preachers that could bring the presence of God to to an audience. That's the great preachers. Amen. All right. So, I think I think that causes all the preachers to change their mind now considering what a great preacher is. Because if you can't bring the presence of God to an audience, &gt;&gt; you're not a preach. You're not a great preacher. [laughter] But we want to bring the presence of the Lord. We want the presence of the Lord to be here. Amen. So really, we are all excited. We're under anticipations tonight. And my prayer is that this won't be George Ferguson, but it will be him. You know, brother Vanna made a statement that has brought more and more signification to me in the last couple of months of my life when he said, "God speaks through his prophet, speaks through the apostles. I can get out of the way and that it won't be me. You speak through me. But no, only that. But you hear the people singing and brother Brandham said the Holy Spirit singing through the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See? Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes, you know, you sit in the meeting and you're so blessed because see brother Isia Brooks get here and he's singing and you're so blessed. And many people don't realize it's not Come, brother. It's not the flesh. &gt;&gt; No sir. It's the anointing come upon him and God just use the instrument. God use the gift he get and expresses it and then we are the beneficiaries. We get blessed. He too he's blessed too but we get blessed. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Just to know that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now tonight uh I was really blessed. I I'm sorry I missed brother's meeting this morning but you know I met brother George and we used to tease te tease each other so much in the bus. go to Georgia. Remember that? And we always see when two Georgees get together, it's trouble. Amen. But I think two Georgees get together tonight and it's a blessing. Amen. [laughter] Well, God bless him. And God bless all of you and my friend here, brother Mando here with us. And really, it's an honor to see what God has done with Israel. And I remember when he had that burden on his heart and I couldn't do anything else but encourage him. And I encouraged him to go forward in the ministry. Same thing I did with Barachi Mosaka in Paris and Barachi was a little shy preacher, very very shy. He was a deacon in the church and something happened with the pastor. I said, "Barachi, God will use you." And he was so bashful and shy and I remember Israel was a little bit shy and bashful too, you And I remember [clears throat] talking with him and I kind of we kind of get together so much because we have so much in common. I love fishing and I believe he loves fishing even more than I. So that kind of pulled us together. See, and we've got a lot in common, him and I. So he was a little bashful at the start and I began to talk with him and encourage him and and then slowly the Lord, you know, put it on his heart, started the work and through the years I've been coming and it's really been a blessing. And I know that brother Paul has been here very often and we have kind of stood with Israel and some of you all here to kind of encourage him and stuff and it's really been a blessing to come. In fact, the only time I get a chance to meet brother is when I come to Tucson. So I said well I come here and I look forward to seeing him look forward to having a little fellowship with him because we really love each other and we've got so much in common. We've been through similar struggles, battles and things. You know, like I told you all, you know, in the ministers meeting, we cried on each other's shoulders. You know, we paid each other's burden. We held hands together and prayed with each other. And it's been like that. Amen. So, I really certainly thank the Lord for him and for all of you and many of you brothers. Uh I saw some of you, of course, brother Agabell is a bosom friend of mine and he was, you know, he pastors a little church in in Denver, Colorado. And happy to see him and brother Malcolm here with us and what a blessing. Amen. all of you. Amen. God bless you all. Now, I usually I stop and give testimonies of some of the work in the foreign fields and stuff and but I'm going to go straight to the word and in the word I I consider I've seen the hand of the Lord doing some mighty things this year. In fact, the last couple of months has been some of the greatest times in my entire ministry since God called me. I could say I've seen the hand of the Lord in a wonderful way. He's really helped me so much and I know that that's not just for me, it's for all of you. And I was happy to see brother David McGary. Uh hadn't seen that brother for over 20s something years and was happy to see him and you know and when I saw him the last time I think I didn't have much gray hair. My hair was still black and he he too and today what you know see what where we've gotten. Amen. So we certainly thank the Lord. Now my subject tonight is the on is God and his word cannot change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God and his word cannot change. And we're going to go a little deep into this subject and I think it will complement a little bit what brother George was preaching on balance but in a different direction and what brother Israel had in his mind on that power to become sons of God. You're going to see that it is also contained in this subject that we are going to be speaking of tonight. So I think we are under tremendous expectations that the Lord will do something for us. &gt;&gt; So I believe we could all stand at this time as we enter into prayer. I will kind of omit giving testimonies because sometimes you start with testimonies and you just continue on the testimonies of the work in foreign fields and we'll get straight to the word. So let's just pray. &gt;&gt; Father, our hearts rejoice together. As we think of what you mean to us, what you've done for us, &gt;&gt; and when we think of how great you are, &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We think of how little we are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And Father, these ministering brothers, many of them here, we just pray you will bless them, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Father. &gt;&gt; May you help your unworthy servant, this congregation here tonight, Father, Lord, &gt;&gt; that you'll take me out of the way. And if Lord, if it be your will, just take mine and let it be you. Let it be you speak into our hearts, speaking through your word, Lord, &gt;&gt; that everyone that come tonight &gt;&gt; would receive a great blessing from you. That &gt;&gt; when we leave this church, we could say that our hearts was blessed to be in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We could leave stronger in the Lord. &gt;&gt; We can leave with something that seeds that are planted for all eternity, Lord. and that when we meet on the other side, we will remember the things that you did for us during these meetings. And father, as our brother David will minister tomorrow, may you be with him and we just we commit it into your hands and even our brother Malcolm and the singing tomorrow night. Lord, we just commit everything into your hands in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God richly bless you all. Now we will take a couple of scriptures just to read as we get into this subject. Of course um there's one of the scriptures here that everyone knows but anyway I'll just go here and read this uh Luke chapter 16 verse 16-17. Luke 16 verse1 16-1 17 Jesus speaking he says the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man pressth into it &gt;&gt; and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tit of the law to fail. What a statement. &gt;&gt; What a statement of Jesus making to us. Um, we'll go a little further. We'll go into Hebrews chapter 13. Of course, this was the theme of brother Brandham's meetings. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. So, we would look at Hebrews chapter 13 verse 7 to9. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God, whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Be not carried about with diverse and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace, not m not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein. &gt;&gt; Father, we commit this service into your hands now. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And the reading of your word and pray that you will take your word, Lord, and &gt;&gt; put it into the hearts of us all as we look to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you all. &gt;&gt; You can be seated now. I do believe that all of us believe here tonight that ge that the Lord Jesus Christ cannot change &gt;&gt; and that his word cannot change. &gt;&gt; And tonight we want to go a little deep into that and trust it will be a blessing to all of you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now I want to start with just reading a little quotation of brother Brandham taken from the message God does God change his mind in preaching Los Angeles. He said you know we can change our mind and because we learn a little different. We know we were wrong. But I don't believe that God could change his mind &gt;&gt; because if he does, then he certainly could not be infinite &gt;&gt; and he could make a better decision if he could change it. The faith that I have in him that he doesn't change his mind because if God ever makes a decision, he has to stay with that decision. See? And each time the same problem comes up, he's got to act in the same way he did the first time &gt;&gt; or he acted wrong in the first time. &gt;&gt; So it gives us somewhere to have a basis for our faith. &gt;&gt; And so we do believe he cannot change. So with the that's what the scriptures teach us. That's what the word of God teaches us. But to get a little deep into it, I want to read for you another quote from the message from the seven church age book and trust that this will be a blessing to you. All right. &gt;&gt; This quote really meant a lot to me from the church ages and then we go into the scriptures as we go into this little study tonight. Brother Banner mentioned he said since this study he's talking about the study of this of the church ages was to be the most serious one I ever undertaken up to this time I sought God for many days for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Then then only did I did I read the scriptures on the church ages and delve into the many church histories written by the most unbiased historians that I could find. The servant of Adam first sought the Lord and after he sought the Lord for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit then he went to the history books to read those history books. &gt;&gt; Now he's continuing here. He says God did not fail to answer my prayer &gt;&gt; for a while I read the word &gt;&gt; and the histories. So brother Brandon went into the history books. He also went into the Bible. He read the word read the history books. He says here, "For while I read the word and the histories, I was able by the Holy Spirit to see unfold a pattern that run through the centuries and right now into this present last day." The key given me of the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messenger for each age is the most scriptural one. In fact, it might be called the keystone of the revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the revelation that God never changes. &gt;&gt; So the revelation &gt;&gt; that God never changes is the keystone revelation. This is the revelation that opens up the entire Bible. &gt;&gt; So with this revelation, we can go before God. This is the revelation that brother man used when he preached marriage and divorce message. &gt;&gt; This is the revelation that he used for the theme of his his ministry. This is the revelation that when you know that God cannot change, you could come to a God that you know cannot change. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you look back as brother Brandham tell us here if we can look back and see which I'll read it for you right now and this here has helped me personally a lot in my own personal struggles with the devil and also my prayer with the Lord. So brother Brandham talking about it here. He says um he says here in the future home he said see his plan of redemption is exactly the same by everything. He uses the same method. He never changes. He said in Malachi 3, I am God and I change not. Amen. &gt;&gt; The way he does it, therefore, if he saves the first man he ever saved by the shed blood of an innocent one, he'll have to save the next one. And everyone that saves will have to be the same way. &gt;&gt; If he healed a man at any time through the journey of life, &gt;&gt; be it in the days of Jesus, the apostles, the prophets, whenever it was, when the same conditions is met, &gt;&gt; he's got to do it again. That's right. He doesn't change. Man changes. Time changes. &gt;&gt; Ages changes. Dispensation changes. But God remains the same. &gt;&gt; He is perfect. &gt;&gt; So if he healed, if one person come and the person got healed &gt;&gt; and you come in the same condition, God is under obligation to do it. If God give a man the baptism of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and the other one come &gt;&gt; and on the same condition, God is under obligation to give him the baptism of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because he cannot change. &gt;&gt; Now, this brings us into another major point that I want to bring to you here tonight. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Now, listen. The word of God cannot change. So if God put his word, he put his word in brother Brook, he put his word in this brother here, brother Mando. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He put it in Israel. &gt;&gt; He put it that word when it comes in us can change. &gt;&gt; Here is something I want to share with you. If you take your Bible and come with me to the book of Hebrews, chapter 11. we will go to Hebrews chapter 11. So this will kind of help us in our little study tonight. Now in Hebrews chapter 11, we can go up, we can read a lot, but I I'll try to go quick. He says, "And what shall I say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barack, and of Samson, and of Jeff, of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets, who through faith subdued kingdoms, route righteousness, obtained promises, stepped the mouths of lions. So in the book of Hebrews, it's by faith Abel, by faith Moses. So the same faith that Abel had was the same faith that Noah had. The same faith that Noah had &gt;&gt; was the same faith that Abraham had. &gt;&gt; Because God, if he give you faith, &gt;&gt; he cannot give me a faith and give you a faith that is different. &gt;&gt; If that faith come from God, regardless to who it is in, it remains the same. &gt;&gt; It is the same faith. &gt;&gt; So the faith you have is the faith that Abraham had. It's the faith that Abel had. It's the faith that Moses had. It's the faith that Jesus had. It's the faith that Paul had. &gt;&gt; The only difference is that someone could have a greater measure of the faith. So one man could stand like we could say, "All right, God gave a greater measure to this certain person, but in reality, it is the same faith." So if you receive the faith of God in you, you don't have a different faith from somebody else. &gt;&gt; It is exactly the same because the revelation, this is the keystone revelation of the Bible. It is the revelation that God cannot change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, here is something that I want to bring to you all. &gt;&gt; We've been measuring on the fact that we are so different. The difference is among us and the difference is among us. and the differences among us which is true that there's a lot of divisions and separation and stuff but in that true bride there is something united there is something similar in her because if that bride if you have the word of God you can't have the word of God in you and the word of God in you is different to the word of God in somebody else God is not the order of this this is this is total COMPLETE CONFUSION &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING TO GOD AND HIS word Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now listen, let me go a little a little further with you and I'll read for you a little quote on that in a little bit. If you have the same the love of God within your heart, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ took his love and he put it in your heart, he can't give you a different kind of love to somebody else. &gt;&gt; The love of God within you is the same love that Jesus had. &gt;&gt; It is the same love that Paul had. &gt;&gt; It's the same love that Luther had. It is the same love that Bernab Brham has. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you if you see a difference in the love OF GOD, THEN YOU don't have the revelation that he cannot change. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Then we're back into the confusion. THEN WE SEE ALL kinds of differences that does not exist in God. &gt;&gt; Come on. Now, don't mix up don't mix up man the understanding of a man. I could have an understanding a little different to you. &gt;&gt; You could read something and understand it different to me. &gt;&gt; But if I believe it with the faith of God and you believe it with the faith of God, &gt;&gt; tell me how could that be different? Right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Then what are we doing to God? &gt;&gt; Now, we can go a little further on this, &gt;&gt; but I want to read something for you just before we're going to go a little further on it, okay? And trust that the Lord would help us. Okay? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to read for you a quote from Brother Brandham on this. And what Brother Brandham says here, we could back it up with many scriptures, too. See, now I want to I want to read this here for you, okay? &gt;&gt; And then we'll go. I trust it will be a blessing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Now, brother Brandham says here in the Pat's vision, he says, "This morning was more of the sermon type placing the foundation upon the deity of the of the revelation. God being revealed in Christ." &gt;&gt; How many believe it? &gt;&gt; God was revealed in Christ. &gt;&gt; Jehovah revealed in Christ. Now, where is God to be revealed? &gt;&gt; Where is he going to be revealed now? Now, &gt;&gt; all right, I give you the answer. Now, where is God to be revealed? In his church. &gt;&gt; Now, here is something we have people because there's so much misunderstanding concerning this word revelation. &gt;&gt; One guy have a revelation, God gave it to me. &gt;&gt; Another have a revelation is a different thing. God give it to me. Another have a revelation, God. &gt;&gt; Listen, church, God is not the author of confusion. If God give if God give me a revelation in something &gt;&gt; and he gave him the revelation on the same thing, it's the same revelation. &gt;&gt; Other than that, what are we doing with God? We have people preaching know I have look I'll read for you a little bit on that in a little bit if we have some time because what we have now is chaos and revelation and and confusion. Why is all the the chaos and confusion? Because the people does not have the revelation that God cannot change. &gt;&gt; And wherever he is, he can't change. If he's in Africa, he can't change. If he's here, he can't change. If he's in Asia, he can't change. &gt;&gt; If he was back in the time of Moses, he can't change. If he was in the time of Jesus, he can't change. It is only the word coming in its season. &gt;&gt; It's not God chang. He can't. He could change his mask. &gt;&gt; He could hide behind a different veil. &gt;&gt; All right. But he can't change. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham says here, which we'll get into that in a little bitty bit. This morning was more of the sermon type placing the foundation upon the deity of the revelation. God being revealed in Christ. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; All right. We believe he was revealed in Christ. &gt;&gt; Okay. We believe also he came along and revealed himself in the prophets &gt;&gt; and everybody believes that. Many people believe that. &gt;&gt; But but goes on. &gt;&gt; He says God was revealed in Christ. Jehovah revealed in Christ. Now where is God to be revealed? &gt;&gt; In his church. His church is you. You and I. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; In his church with his people in us. the same spirit. &gt;&gt; So the Bible tell us by one spirit are we all baptized into &gt;&gt; two bodies? &gt;&gt; Three bodies, &gt;&gt; three bodies, four bodies. &gt;&gt; Is Christ divided? &gt;&gt; Now come on church. &gt;&gt; Is the body of Christ divided? Amen. &gt;&gt; We are all listen. I remember telling one brother once. I said, "Brother, I have the same baptism of the Holy Ghost that celebr Ferguson, no, no, no, no, no. It's not the same baptism of the Holy Ghost." He says, "I can't see myself having the same Holy Ghost as Peter. Something is wrong. &gt;&gt; How could God give you a different Holy Ghost? What he gave Peter [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; now? Come on. &gt;&gt; And some people think, well, I have a little personal revelation of my own that nobody else has got, &gt;&gt; brother. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Let me let me just continue on this little nice little quote here. Okay. Now, okay. The same spirit, the same works. &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Ferguson, [laughter] I don't see the works in me." &gt;&gt; All you got to do is fall on your knees and pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, God of heaven, you promise it to me. And whatever he promised, he's going to give it to give it to you." Now, now, everybody's not going to have the same gifts &gt;&gt; and the same ministry. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we all are going to have the same spirit, &gt;&gt; the same love. Amen. &gt;&gt; The same faith. &gt;&gt; There's only how many faith? &gt;&gt; One. Let's say it together. &gt;&gt; One faith. &gt;&gt; ONE LORD, &gt;&gt; one spirit, one baptism. Brother said that baptism is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. The same manifestation, the same love. &gt;&gt; The same love. You see, we have so much in common. Do you know why we have so much in common? Because we belong to the same family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is our head. We we are all if we all if we could say all right when you say to God father you praying and you say father &gt;&gt; do you realize what you're saying brother says that word father when you say father you are telling god I came from you &gt;&gt; and if you if you come from god and another one come from god and another one come from god where There is this division. &gt;&gt; That's why when Jesus spoke to the scribes and Pharisees, he said, "Ye of your father the devil." &gt;&gt; NOW THERE ARE THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; BUT HIS DISCIPLES, WHAT WAS HE DOING? He was when he he mold those disciples into his own image. &gt;&gt; Got to do the same with us. I have to hurry. Boy, &gt;&gt; you know what you do? Pull on my coat and I'll step. It's It's finished now. &gt;&gt; Should I stop? [laughter] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Let's go on. [laughter] Huh? Brother George is watching me. [laughter] What a blessing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, church. You know, excuse me. I I have to say this, you know. There's a lady in New Brunswick. She's giving out tracks, you know, look like her mother and father and husband and everything died. One person come a little track. One guy pastor and she handed a check. He said, "Madam, I don't want I don't want what you have." [laughter] Listen, &gt;&gt; we were miserable without Christ. &gt;&gt; We didn't come to this message to be a bunch of miserable Christians. [cheering] We come to this message to have joy and peace. and blessings in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [cheering] [laughter] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And amen. &gt;&gt; What did Paul say? HE SAYS, "REJOICE. AND AGAIN, I say unto you, rejoice. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil steal your joy." Don't let the devil [laughter] STEAL YOUR JOY. JOY IN THE HOLY GHOST. IT'S FOR ALL OF US. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST FOR ONE. [cheering] THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST IS FOR ALL OF US. &gt;&gt; HEALING IS FOR ALL of us. &gt;&gt; DELIVERANCE IS FOR ALL OF US. &gt;&gt; THE PEACE OF GOD IS FOR ALL OF US. THE LOVE OF GOD IS FOR ALL OF [screaming] US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And amen. &gt;&gt; All right, let's continue. &gt;&gt; The same love. &gt;&gt; So you tell a brother, you don't have love. Somebody might say something to hurt you in the flesh. He made a mistake. &gt;&gt; And then you look at him and say, "Well, does he have love?" Then you go back to the word to see what does the word of God says. Love is Jesus says, "Any man that love me will keep my words." &gt;&gt; So when you not look Jesus said it, you know what the Bible says? John 14. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He that loveth me not keepeth my words. &gt;&gt; See, so you know when you don't keep the word of God, they don't love God. That's the Bible. To me, that's the Bible. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Brother Ferguson, no, no, no, no. Not brother Ferguson. That's the word. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go on. &gt;&gt; The same love, the same forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now you want to know. That's why Paul tells us this. As Christ forgive you, you forgive others. &gt;&gt; You can say, "All right, did Christ forgive you?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you recognize that Christ has forgiven you? &gt;&gt; Can you raise your hands tonight and say, "Thank you, Lord, you forgive me." All right. The same way that you he forgive you because when he forgives you when he forgives you it's not the way people think. &gt;&gt; It's not not that's not the way people think. &gt;&gt; I'll give you an example. &gt;&gt; Who can I use as an example? &gt;&gt; Oh, he volunteered. Come &gt;&gt; Eli. Oh, that's a lovely name. Come up here, Elijah. &gt;&gt; Well, let's see if Elijah and I have a little fight. Your dad is here. Oh, &gt;&gt; my dad. &gt;&gt; Is your dad here? &gt;&gt; Yeah, he was here before. &gt;&gt; All right. So, let's see. Elijah and I have a little fight. And Elijah hit me. Boom. Punch me. &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh, Elijah, oh, you punched me. You hurt me. I split blood." But I said, "You know what? I forgive you." &gt;&gt; Now, I could forgive him, but I can't give him forgiveness. Now when God forgives you, it's more than just telling to you, I forgive you. God takes his own forgiveness and puts it in your heart. And with that forgiveness, you could forgive others as Christ forgive you. Now, when you recognize what God has done to you. Now, the message says you're justified by faith. God takes his forgiveness. So, we're walking around. We're coming to church. Come on. &gt;&gt; We're here upon the earth and in us in us is the forgiveness of God. &gt;&gt; So even if somebody do me wrong, they already forgiven because in me is the forgiveness of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So even if I tell you I forgive you, you're forgiven even before you do it. &gt;&gt; Because it's like me, all of us sitting here, even before WE DID WRONG, CHRIST DIED AND forgive us. [cheering] And that's the kind of forgiveness we have. Now when we have the revelation that he cannot change, these things become real to us. &gt;&gt; We see it. We live it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just a theory. It's something we possess. It's it's in it's in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Let's go on here. The same longsuffering, &gt;&gt; gentleness, patience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't have patience." All you got to do is pray for it. &gt;&gt; A trial will come your way, &gt;&gt; but you'll get the patience. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm a west and I forgot to SCRIPT THE BIBLE TRIBULATION PRAYERS. [laughter] I'm praying in the plane, you know. I said, "Lord, I need more patience because patience is perfection." Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, knowing how to wait upon God and stuff, that's perfection. See, Brother Bam says it's character formation. How God forms your character. &gt;&gt; Character. Brother Brooks, correct me? Good. Good. Character. All right. You know what I mean? All right. So, I'm praying &gt;&gt; and therefore I come back to the church and there was one guy looked at me and he says, "You, George Ferguson, come here. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; I look at him. I walked out of the church and he started bang bang bang. And I said, "Lord, what's happening to me? What is happening to me is the answer of my prayer." [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You pray for it, God answer it, AND THEN YOU COMPLAIN AFTER. NO. RECOGNIZE THE answer of prayer. Look, I got to hurry here. I got to hurry. &gt;&gt; All right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. The same gentleness, patience, peace, mercy, all that. All that was in Christ is in the church. Remember, keep this in your mind. All that that God was, he poured into Christ. He was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. And all that Christ was, he poured into the church. God above us, God with us, God in us. The trinity of God manifested in three different manners. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Now with the revelation that we have that God cannot change, &gt;&gt; the same Holy Spirit, the same deliverance, the same healing, the same God operating in the same way. It brings us now to something that we need to look at tonight that brother Brandon says, and this is happening. It's not happening because I desire it or you desire it or somebody just pray for it. It's happening the way that God is working it out. &gt;&gt; And what brother man tell us it is one of the great mysteries and what is happening right now. Now what is happening right now [cough] is that right now taking place in the bride of Christ when everybody is looking at the division everybody's looking at confusion everybody's trying to get excuse me if I say this I hope it don't hurt everybody's trying to get churches to unite together &gt;&gt; which if they could get the churches to unite together that's wonderful and everybody wants to go bone to bone and unite with one another which is also scriptural and which is good but in the midst of all of this there's another uniting going on &gt;&gt; and this is the major sign but man said is the big sign of the hour &gt;&gt; and some people thinking they put it way off into the future. Oh, you know uh it's going to happen one day. One day we're going to have that. No, it's not one day it's going to happen. It's happening now. [snorts] Now look, &gt;&gt; let me read it for you. Okay, &gt;&gt; let me read it for you. &gt;&gt; All right, are you ready? because we are too focused on division and separations &gt;&gt; and I tell you this I told the ministers this morning you know I heard so much about divisions and divisions and I was was falling into all of this see division you all around us there's division all around us all around us there's division but what's happening in all this division and division is God is God not doing something where is God in all of this is is it God doing all this division what's happening now what people don't realize is that the shock has to pour away &gt;&gt; from the wheat in order for the weak to do a to ripen in the sunlight. This is not a sign of division as people think. It is a sign of God doing something to unite his bride &gt;&gt; if the people can only see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why he has to give you the same love, give you the same faith, give you the same revelation. IT IS THOSE THINGS THAT are uniting us together. BECAUSE IF GOD IS HERE AND GOD IS HERE, IT IS THE SAME GOD. [applause and cheering] NOW, &gt;&gt; now &gt;&gt; let me let me read for you a little bit what brother Brandham says. Okay. Because after the opening of the seals, Brother Brandham preached this message called the uniting of the time and sign. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And before brother Brandham was praying and looking for the for the uniting. I can read those quotes for you if I had the time. He's praying and he's looking I can read you the the years and the date. He's looking for the anointing. He's looking for that that uniting. He's looking for it. He's praying for it. He said he's praying for it. He's praying for it. He's looking for it. All right. You're praying for something. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING. THERE HAS TO come a time when the thing that you're praying for and the thing you're expecting happens. &gt;&gt; You can't be put in the future all the time. In the future all the time. IN THE FUTURE. ONE DAY I'LL BE HEALED. ONE DAY I'LL BE BLESSED. THERE HAS TO COME A TIME WHEN IT HAPPENS. Put on my coat. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I haven't watched. Is it? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; It's counting now. How much? &gt;&gt; 30 minutes. &gt;&gt; I got 30 minutes. Okay. So, brother George is going to be watching it. But I think you know what? 30 minutes we can do a lot. All right. I thought I had about 10 more minutes. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, [laughter] &gt;&gt; all right. Now, let's look at this. Let me go a little fast. Okay. &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; In in 1959, I'm going to give you the the time. 590815. All right. Let me stop here. Hold on. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Uh, take my time and hurry up. All right. United on the one head. Brother Bam says here, and it is very striking to see how that man wants to be one. &gt;&gt; The reason he wants to be one is because that God designed him for that purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God designed man, made him up to be one, to work together, to cooperate together. That's the makeup of man. That's the way God made man. But man always wants to have his idea about it. &gt;&gt; He wants to project something that God never intended him to do. &gt;&gt; He wants to figure his own ways out. He wants to make his own plans. He wouldn't accept the plan that God made for him because it is his fallen nature. &gt;&gt; In his fallen nature, he cannot see what God is doing, the program and the plan of God. Then brother Brandon goes on. He said, "My ministry is a ministry trying to unite the body of Christ together, not unite denominations to one another." This is in 1959. But unite brothers and sisters as one group of people, one in purpose, one in heart, one in unity to see the coming of the Lord. He preached this in 1959. He continues here in 1959. The full gospel Christian businessman has been one of my great supporters in taking me in to help fulfill the purpose that I believe that God sent me to help do. That was to unite the body of Jesus Christ together. It's my purpose to do that. That's what's in my heart to see all of God's children in one accord and one one heart moving on. Then I believe when that takes place, the work will be about done. Brother Brandham's face and the millennium will set in. The rapture will come and we are certainly praying and watching and waiting for that time. &gt;&gt; All right. Here he's saying we're praying, we're watching, we're waiting for that time. This is in 59. Now we come to 1963 after the opening of the seals. Here's what he says now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; He says in the uniting time, he says now you see where we are living the uniting time when we see these things being united. Oh my, we failed to see these things. You can look in here and see the scriptures and see that he promised that what he will do. &gt;&gt; Now we see it coming to pass. We'll read that for you in a little while. &gt;&gt; We see in the church what he promised to do. We see it coming to pass. We see the nations uniting together. We see the isms uniting together. We see the churches uniting together. It's a uniting time. It's the hour of uniting. That's the spirit of the age. We got to unite. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, that spirit of uniting, I'm going to have to hurry. Now, Brother Brandham continues. I got to put All right. I'm going to step some of this. Yeah. All right. Unite in time. What did he say in Malachi 4 would restore? Restore back the original Pentecostal faith back to the people with the true Pentecostal message, the true Pentecostal sign, the true Pentecostal evidence, the same God, the same power, the same teaching, everything exactly &gt;&gt; with the vindication of the same pillar of fire that struck Paul down on the road &gt;&gt; down to Damascus is among us today. Hallelujah. Doing the same thing he did in that day. Uniting. &gt;&gt; We see the nations uniting. We see the word uniting. We see the churches uniting. We see the bride uniting. &gt;&gt; Uniting with the word. &gt;&gt; The word is God. As the bridegroom being the word and the bride being the hearer of the word, they come together in a union. They unite like a wedding. They're getting ready for for the wedding. They become one. The word becomes you and you becomes the word. &gt;&gt; Now, let me ask you this. Are you waiting for that? Are you saying, "Well, one good day is going to happen to me." NO, NO, NO. THE TIME is now. It's now. It's now. &gt;&gt; Could you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; What is in YOUR HEART NOW? LET'S HURRY HERE. &gt;&gt; Brother man, continue. All right. He says, "Amen." Yes, sir. Uniting. What is it? She uniting with the word for all heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away. She's uniting herself with thus sayith the Lord regardless of what any denomination or anybody else says. &gt;&gt; I don't care what they say. &gt;&gt; This is it. &gt;&gt; This is the hour. &gt;&gt; This is the at the time. &gt;&gt; This is God on the scene now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm not waiting. waiting, WAITING FOR IT. I'M LIVING IT NOW. IT'S HAPPENING in me now. The word is in me now. The word is in you now. &gt;&gt; Stop stop listening to the devil. &gt;&gt; Brother B says, as long as he can get you to put it off for another time, that's as much that's that's AS GOOD AS YOU WANT IT. &gt;&gt; STOP. This is your hour of deliverance. &gt;&gt; This is your hour of victory. &gt;&gt; This is your hour to receive Jesus Christ. the same yesterday, today, and forever. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Now, [screaming] Brother Brandham says here, &gt;&gt; she's she is uniting herself. SHE'S GETTING READY. WHY? SHE IS THE BRIDE. That's why. And she's uniting herself with a bridegroom. See, and the bridegroom is the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, brother Bon goes on &gt;&gt; it goes on to say here, I have to hurry here. We see the ducks getting ready. We see the geese getting ready. We see the bees bees getting ready. We see the clouds getting ready for rain. We see everything how it unites itself together for it's it's for the the excuse me, the push. We see the League of Nations together, uniting themselves in communism. We see them uniting themselves over here in the Western world. We see the church uniting itself together. So we see the uniting of churches with churches. &gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with the bride. &gt;&gt; The bride is the word. &gt;&gt; And when you unite with the word and I unite with the word, we don't have to strive to be united together. We are united in the same word and in the same message &gt;&gt; and in the same revelation &gt;&gt; here brother man goes on see it's we see the church uniting itself together all these others so it's absolutely impossible no other time could it be this way it couldn't have been this way 20 years ago it couldn't be in this way couldn't this way 10 years ago it has to be right now &gt;&gt; right See right now &gt;&gt; because these isms and things hadn't come to this place. Brother man continues. Unite in time. God uniting time. Yes sir. Oh my. Now you remember now there is a uniting of the word. UNITING BACK AGAIN. BRINGING BACK the faith that was once delivered to the saints. LISTEN CHURCH. MALACHI 4. We started and we receive it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Could we just go ahead and give God praise for that? &gt;&gt; We receive it. It's here now. [applause] &gt;&gt; We are WE ARE WE ARE IN the time of the restoration. &gt;&gt; It's time for US TO WAKE UP AND REALIZE WHAT'S HAPPENING. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, &gt;&gt; now God, unite in time. Yes sir. Oh my. Now you remember now there is a uniting of the word. UNITING BACK AGAIN. BRINGING BACK THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE delivered to the saints. Bringing back. This could only be done in this day. The only time it could be done is right now. &gt;&gt; Is right now. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham is praying praying for it. AND THEN HE'S TELLING THE CHURCH, HE'S TELLING THE BRIDE, it is happening. &gt;&gt; We are SEEING IT HAPPENING NOW, RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; And he's pouring himself into you and I. &gt;&gt; All right, let's look at this thing, this problem here that we have with people thinking that they have a different revelation from everybody else. I'll have a few more minutes so we can because it's the same experience. It's the same power. But it's when you believe you you pray and God give you the faith. When you believe it's all things are possible them to believe. &gt;&gt; It's it's right here now. God is here to give it to you. &gt;&gt; And then brother man tells us this. I want to hurry on this one. He said the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying &gt;&gt; the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit &gt;&gt; and the prophet &gt;&gt; and the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like I told the ministers, Jesus quoted the prophets. &gt;&gt; As Jeremiah says, as this prophet says, as that prophet says, and now if the spirit of Jesus come in this age, how can he change? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And some people's hesitant, well, I don't know. I'm not sure. They don't have the revelation that he they cannot change. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you have the revelation that brother says that's where Eve failed. &gt;&gt; He says Eve failed on the promise of him being the same yesterday, today, and forever. Because when the devil came to Eve, she should have tell SATAN RIGHT AWAY, GOD CANNOT [screaming] CHANGE. &gt;&gt; WHAT HE said cannot be altered or changed. &gt;&gt; Now, I'll read this for you. We have time. Thank you, my brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And you you don't only see he can't change in the Bible. You see he can change in you and in others. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Random quotes the scripture. This one is going to be a little little touchy. Now, I warn you ahead. This is a little touchy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I was I was hesitating to read this one. &gt;&gt; But read it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bring it on. &gt;&gt; Listen. The bride would believe anything. Everything in the world. [clears throat] [applause] &gt;&gt; But some people stumble. Well, well, well, well, well, well. It's not well well. It's Amen. Amen. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALL &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; RIGHT, LET'S GO ON HERE. &gt;&gt; TELL US WHAT he said. &gt;&gt; He quotes the scripture. Thou has tried them that say they're apostles and are not and lies. &gt;&gt; You see, that's why Moses could warn the people to stay exactly what he says because Moses knew that that word what he brought couldn't change. &gt;&gt; The people had to stay with it. It had for it to change it has to come to pass. That's why Jesus said not one title of the law could change. But the Bible says when it is fulfilled, it passes. &gt;&gt; But it has to be fulfilled first. &gt;&gt; You all understand? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, he gave a prophecy, it's fulfilled. &gt;&gt; It's like you you were sick, he healed you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he healed you, the healing is complete. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then now it's a historic fact. &gt;&gt; You don't understand. It's manifested. &gt;&gt; All right. We won't go into that deep because we could take a lot of time on that. But let's just read this here for you. that was tried them that say they're apostles and are not and has spong them lives. But the man who says my that's a blunt statement. That was tried them who call themselves apostles. Isn't that presumptuous? &gt;&gt; What right is the people to try those who call themselves apostles? How do they try them? Oh, I love this. Do you? &gt;&gt; Well, you're quiet on me now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ferguson, we're not supposed to preach like that. You know, you have to understand, brother Ferguson, we have to have love. &gt;&gt; Misunderstanding of love. Excuse me, church. &gt;&gt; Hear what Paul says here with the love of God in his heart. Here it is in Gal in Galatians 1:8. Though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have already preached unto you, let him be a curse. &gt;&gt; Let him be &gt;&gt; a cursed. &gt;&gt; Who said that? &gt;&gt; Was he wrong? &gt;&gt; Do we believe it? &gt;&gt; All right, let's continue. &gt;&gt; It was the apostles who brought the original word to the people. That original word could not change. &gt;&gt; Not even a dot or dash of it. &gt;&gt; Paul knew it was God who had spoken to him. So he said even if I come and try to give a second revelation to make one little change in what I gave originally let me be a curse. &gt;&gt; You see Paul knew the first revelation was correct. &gt;&gt; God can't give a first revelation then a second revelation. If he did he would be changing his mind. Yes, &gt;&gt; he can give a revelation and then add to it &gt;&gt; as he did in the garden of Eden when he promised the seed to the woman and then later designated the seed had to come through Abraham and then later it would come through the same bloodlines in David but it was the same revelation. So what he did is he gave the revelation and gave more information on the revelation but it is the SAME REVELATION. SO WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS age is the same revelation he gave to Abel, he gave to Abraham, he gave to David, HE GAVE TO PAUL. BUT IN this age, he give a LITTLE MORE. HE GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE. And brother Bame is explaining that now. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we're going to have to hurry. &gt;&gt; He gave the people more information to help them receive and understand it. &gt;&gt; So you got a little BIT MORE INFORMATION. BROTHER BRANDHAM CAME AT THE PULPIT. People is thinking he's adding. No. If Baram added to the scriptures and took away from the scriptures, he's a false prophet. &gt;&gt; HE PREACHED THE BIBLE. &gt;&gt; But you have things added, you know, a little bit more information to the people. And the reason is in order for the people to to be able to receive it and understand it. BECAUSE IN THIS AGE, GOD WILL GIVE US THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HE SAID. All right, let's go on. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So, so it only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand it. But God word can't change. The seed came exactly as revealed. Hallelujah. And see what those false apostles were doing. They came with their own word. Those these Ephesians knew that word as Paul had taught it. THEY WERE FULL OF the Holy Ghost by the laying on of Paul's hands. They look those false apostles in the eye and says you are not saying what Paul say. You are therefore false. &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; Today you try to do a thing like that. They say you have they said you're backing Christian. You have no love of God in you. You're judging the people and on you're judging the people. You see, because they failed to see what God is doing. &gt;&gt; They failed to see the identification of God in his people. That word cannot change. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation in us. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; now let me come to another point. Okay? And I know some of these things are hard, but I trust &gt;&gt; you will see it's not George Ferguson. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see it because what people are doing with God, they're making God as if God is a div God is dividing himself against himself. There's division in God. How could there be division in the God ahead of them? [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Listen, I'll go a little deep into something that probably trouble you a little bit, might probably trouble some people a little bit. &gt;&gt; Let's take my sitting here and then we go to the word just now. I'll read the quotes. We'll finish just now. If he is puzzled on some things in the me in the word of God and I'm puzzled on the same things and the Holy Ghost comes and give him an understanding and he come and give me an understanding of the same thing. If it's the Holy Ghost giving him an understanding, giving me an understanding, it's the same understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can't give him one thing and give me something else. Of course, if there's a need, he has a specific need. God can deal with his specific need. Maybe I have a different need to him. God will deal with me. But when it is the same thing, that's why brother Boo said if he take a decision upon anything and he has to act, he has to act the same. &gt;&gt; If if he don't then you have a God changing and what kind of a God we serving? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now I want to read this for you. Brother Brandham says here in the message, "Be not afraid." Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not hearing a lot of amens. &gt;&gt; Brother Bill, you're not amening your friend. It's not me, Brother Bill. It's that word. I know you you're in you're in it with me. But let's go deeper. Brother Bam says, "Now, no, I regard you as my friend." That's wonderful, brother George. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And my brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; I expect to spend eternity with you in glory. &gt;&gt; And if you disagree with me on my teaching, that's perfectly all right. &gt;&gt; But I believe if you search your Bible, right, good, you'll find out it's on the mark. &gt;&gt; Cuz first the angel of the Lord came to me and taught it to me. Then he showed me in the Bible where to find it. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; It's right in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost showed that prophet where to find in the Bible. &gt;&gt; What did that prophet do? Keep it for himself? &gt;&gt; No, sir. Amen. He received it from God and gave it to the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; let's go a little further. Now, this is a quote you probably have heard before, but I want to read it again for you. I'm sure you already did, but I want to read it again for you. Notice here that Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person. God to the word for that age. Only one messenger &gt;&gt; for each age. We seize what the spirit has to say to that age. &gt;&gt; So it's not two and three and four and five and six. &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to be, you know, I'm the one. I'm the forget it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Forget it. &gt;&gt; Only one person relative to the word for that age. Only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age. And that one messenger is the messenger to the true church. He speaks for God by revelation to the churches both true and false. &gt;&gt; So even the false church gets it. AND SOME OF THEM SAYS IT MEANS I BELIEVE IT. But watch the fruits. &gt;&gt; The fruits you're watching is the word. &gt;&gt; But man said the fruits is the word in the season. That's the word. &gt;&gt; Because you see it's the same thing in you. It has to be the same. You go right back in the Bible and see it goes right back. Now let's hurry here. &gt;&gt; Let's hurry here. &gt;&gt; And that no he speaks for God by revelation to the churches both true and false. The message is done broadcast to all. That's what we did. We translates the message so that the message could be broadcast to all. And the biggest operation I mean missionary work in the world is in the central African countries among the French speaking countries. We have literally I don't know how many over two million believers maybe 2.5 million believers of the message in the central American in the central African and the west African countries. &gt;&gt; So it's a lot of them coming in. Amen. Especially the French speaking. We won't go into that. That puts me in the missionary report. Let's hurry back here. But though it is broadcast for all who come within range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way. So the group receives it a qualified group in a certain way. So we receive it in a certain way. We won't have time tonight to go into that certain way, but let's hurry here. Each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so we're not listening to everybody else. He's got an explanation and he's got another explanation. He's forget it. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now we go on to this nice part. This is the part I love so much. Those who here are not getting their own private revelation. I got a revelation that nobody else knows. [laughter] &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; So those are not getting their own private revelation. Nor is a group getting their own collective revelation. You know I'm the pastor of the church. Our church has the revelation but nobody else. &gt;&gt; So we say for and no more. [laughter] &gt;&gt; That's not the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the revelation has to go back. Amen. It's back with Abel. Abel had a revelation. Noah had a revelation. Uh Moses had a It's the same. It's the same God. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's hurry here. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So nor is a group getting their own collective revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God. &gt;&gt; This is what happened in the time of Noah. This is what happened in the time of of Moses. This is what happened in the time of Jeremiah. The people had to receive the word as God sent it to them through the messenger of the hour. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now this quickly now as you receive the revelation as you realize as you realize as you receive that revelation God gives you the revelation the key that opens up all the scriptures. Amen. The key that brother Brandham used to open up all those scriptures. And when you get that key YOU'VE GOT IT THAT GOD CANNOT CHANGE. &gt;&gt; THEN YOU could have push him for the baptism of the Holy Ghost because you know in your heart that he gives me power. And the same power he give me IS THE SAME POWER JESUS HAD. It's the SAME POWER THE APOSTLES HAD. &gt;&gt; Oh God help us. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Now this brings us into another revelation that we won't have time to go into tonight. &gt;&gt; It is the revelation of our position as believers, &gt;&gt; our identification as believers. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon preached this in spiritual amnesia that you could identify yourself now back in the scriptures. How could you identify yourself? You could identify yourself with Abel because you could say the same faith Abel has, I have. The same revelation Abel has, I have. NOW YOU GO BACK. YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF WITH NOAH. YOU could say, as Bam says, you were there. He says when you don't do it, YOU HAVE SPIRITUAL AMNESIA. YOU FORGET WHO YOU ARE. BUT WHEN YOU RECOGNIZE who you are, YOU CAN GO BACK. YOU CAN IDENTIFY YOURSELF WITH ALL CHRISTIANS of all ages [screaming] because he is the same. He cannot change. Then you could see yourself. AMEN. WHAT GOD WHAT WHAT GOD DID IN NOAH. GOD GAVE Noah faith. By faith Noah. I can identify myself with NOAH BECAUSE WE NOAH and I have the same faith. We come from the same father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. [laughter] You see it. We're all the same family. &gt;&gt; You see it now. We're together in this. Don't feel separated. You come here where you have your face all set up already. Your mind is made up. I'm not accepted in the group. &gt;&gt; You know why I'm not accepted here? I feel as if I'm an outcast and I'm different. You don't have a revelation that he is the same. &gt;&gt; Come to Christ as we walk in the light and he is the light. We have fellowship one another. &gt;&gt; It happens. &gt;&gt; Here's brother George. Here's brother Trev Trevor sitting right here. The word is in him. The word is IN HIM. THE WORD IS IN ME. WHERE IS THE WHERE IS THE DIVISION? IT CANNOT EXIST. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I found brother Brandham saying this. I'm hurrying out to finish. When Paul says, "Who can separate us from the love of Christ?" &gt;&gt; I always thought it was me separating from the love. But brother Brandham went deeper. When you have that love of Christ and I have that love of Christ, nothing could separate us. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; SO WHY WHY ARE WE MEASURING ON THE DIFFERENCES? WHY are we measuring the differences? The one who is in the in the division business separating and causing confusion and division. His name better call him Lucifer. &gt;&gt; But we are more united because we are the same family. BUT IT TAKES A REVELATION. AND WHEN GOD GIVES YOU THAT REVELATION, you could SEE YOUR IDENTIFICATION WITH EVERY CHARACTER OF THE SCRIPTURES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And amen. Oh, let's lift our hands. &gt;&gt; Let's give him praise. [applause] &gt;&gt; God bless every one of you. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Wonderful Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. Amen. Amen. Amen. [cheering] &gt;&gt; And amen. Praise his name. &gt;&gt; Glory and praise to our God. Amen. Praise his name. God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Were you blessed? Not because of me, but because of him. [applause] &gt;&gt; He is wonderful, isn't he? God bless you all. [applause] [applause] You deserve the glory &gt;&gt; and the honor. Let's stand as we worship him.

Father, when we look at what you've done in [music] our lives, oh God, how merciful you've been to us, God, we don't deserve any of it. But God, your grace has looked past every mistake in our life. [music] Everything that we ever need in this life is inside of us [music] already. Oh God, may we grab hold of your promises for this hour. And Father, when we fall short, may your grace [music] just cover those. May the blood of Jesus Christ be our testimony. &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to say thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, &gt;&gt; for the honor and privilege of being [music] here in this house of worship. I pray and I ask you, Father, that every person [music] here, may they know and come to understand the grace of God in their life. Father, it's nothing we've ever can do, but it's simply what [music] you've already done for us. &gt;&gt; Calvary is where it was all paid for us. &gt;&gt; And tonight, Lord, we say thank you for that. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, as we leave this place, dear God, may we leave knowing respectfully and reverently of what Jesus Christ did for us in our lives.

I think there are some [music] refreshments tonight. Yes. And uh you're welcome to be a part of that. And um before we go just want to sing one more hymn. Let's sing [music] that song. Jesus paid it all. All to him I owe. And I'll turn it over to him. I hear the Savior say, "Thy strength indeed is small. Child of weakness [singing] watch and pray. Find in thee [singing] thy all and all. Jesus [singing] paid [music] it all. All to him I owe. Sin had [singing and music] left the crimson stain. He washed it white as snow. How indeed I find thy power and thine alone can change the leper spots. am the harder. I'm so glad that Jesus [singing] paid it all. All [singing] to him my [music] own. Sin had [singing and music] left a crimson stain. He washed it white as snow. Sing that one more time. [singing and music] Yes, Jesus paid it all. All [singing] to [music] him I sin [singing] had left a crimson [music] stain. He washed it white as snow. [singing] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can say it was been good to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you so much for coming and worshiping with us and trust you were encouraged. I was encouraged tonight. Amen. You're dismissed. We'll [music] keep you flat till the storm passes by. Out on the [singing] water, the storms raging high. The waters [singing] around them were troubled [music] that night. Fear filled their hearts [music] [singing] and they thought they would die. I failed to remember that the master was [singing] nigh. But he spoke the word and the winds all [singing and music] stood still. Even the waters they oyed his will and he [singing] calmed their storms just like he will mine. If I'll [music] just remember [singing] that he lives deep inside. [music] So why should I worry? Why should I fear when this [music] very [singing] same Jesus, he stays always near. [singing] He lives in [music] my heart and he hears when I cry. I call on [music and singing] his name till the storm passes by. We read in [singing] the Bible how he walked [music] with them, brought light [singing] to the darkness when [music] the way grew so [singing] dim. How great it would be [music] to have his steps lead in [singing] mine and to walk with [music] the master all of [singing] the [music] time. time. So when trials come [singing] and death is so nice, I just search for the [music and singing] master. He said he'll be there on time. And when I'm in trouble [singing] and my body is in pain, all I [singing and music] have to do is call on his name. So [music and singing] why should I worry? Why should I fear? When this very [singing] same Jesus, [music] he stays always near. lives in [music and singing] my heart and he hears when I cry. [music] I call on [singing] his name till the storm passes by. Oh, so [music and singing] why should I worry? Why should I fear [music] when this very same Jesus, [singing] he stays always near. He lives in [singing] my heart and he hears [music] when I cry. I'll call [singing] on his name till the [music] storm passes by. He's alive and well. He's [music] living in me [singing] to tell the world that he [music and singing] is the same. [singing] He is the [music] same yesterday, [singing] [music] today, and forever. Jesus is alive [music] and well. [singing] Well, this same Jesus [singing and music] who died on a cross crucified is [singing] alive in our hearts. Today [singing] he's resurrected [music] [singing] again in a body [music] without sin. Oh, praise God. [singing] He's alive and well. [singing] Well, he is a high and well. He's [music] living in me to tell the [singing and music] world that he is the [music] same. [singing] Well, he is the [music] same yesterday, [singing] today, and forever. Jesus is alive and [singing] well. Now the [music] promise he gives to show that he lives in [singing and music] all who truly believe. [singing and music] He said, "The works that I do, they will be [music and singing] done by you." Oh, praise God. He's alive and well. [singing] Yes, [music] he is alive and well. [singing] He's living in me to tell the [singing and music] world that he is the [singing] same. Well, he is the same yesterday, [music and singing] today, and forever. [singing] Jesus is alive [singing] and well. Hallelujah. [music] Jesus. Heat. Heat. [music] Amen. [music] Hallelujah. Oh, [music] [music] you know. &gt;&gt; [music] [music]
