recording and we'll be starting at paragraph 257 and end after paragraph 3:16 only believe only be only be all things are possible [Music] only believe only be only be all things are possible only [Music] be you may be seated brother Brandon now now remember this is the Revelation you cannot take from it now what a challenge find one person in the Bible one place they ever baptized anybody in the name of father son holy ghost or ever sprinkle anybody find that in the Bible for the remission of their sins they never and every person no matter how they was baptized had to come and be baptized over again in the name of Jesus Christ to get the Holy Ghost Acts 19 Paul passed through the upper course of ephes finds certain disciples he said disciples they're having a great meeting there were following a man by the name of Apollos who was a converted lawyer a Baptist who believed on John the Baptist and is proven by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ Paul passed through and seen a quill and Priscilla in the 18th chapter of the acts and then he went over to have a dinner or something other with the quill and Priscilla they told him about this great man they went to hearing he listened at him that night he said he's very well that's very fine that's good but said have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed what about you poor Baptist back there believe you received the Holy Ghost when you believe he said have you received the Holy Ghost sent you believe someone said that wasn't written in that I defy that I've got the authentic Greek right you're Hebrew too the Bible says in the Greek and both Hebrew and also in arenic all three them I got them right here that said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe that's right have you receive the Holy Ghost sent you believe amen now he said we not know where there be any Holy Ghost then he said unto what was you baptized they said we've already been baptized for the man that baptized the Lord Jesus Christ we've been baptized under John's baptism same hole of water perhaps the same man Paul said that won't work he only baptized unto repentance not for remission of sins that's some of you wondess people come around and baptize that wrong you baptize that un far salvation water don't save a man it's the blood repentance not to baptism of you regeneration no sir regeneration comes by the spirit baptism is a is a outward expression of the inward work of regeneration has been done see all right notice he said have you received the Holy Ghost s you believe they said he said we not know where there be ho ghost He said how was you baptized said we've been baptized under John he said John barely baptized unto repentance unto repentance saying if you should believe on him the land the sacrific was to come on the Lord Jesus Christ and when they heard heard this they were re-baptized again in the name of Jesus Christ and Paul laid his hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost and spoke in tongues and prophesy tell me that's not scripture and show me anywh anybody's ever baptized any other way in the New Testament but the name of the Lord Jesus Christ show me St acus and many others who was baptized W down until the time of the of the of the Ning Council and every one of them was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ the missionaries kill the fields with the name of Jesus Christ but when the N seeing counsil come they had to have three gods they took down Paul or Tu down Juniper and put up Paul they took down Venus and put up Mary they had all kinds of gods all kinds of saints and everything else they made a tri baptism and fed it to the Protestants and they still GTH it down but the evening lights has come now the prophet said it'll be light in the evening time there it'll be light in the evening time the path to Glory GL you will surely find in the Waterway that's the light today buried in the precious name of Jesus young and old repent of all your sins the Holy Ghost will surely enter in the evening lights have come it is the fact that God and Christ are one Hallelujah you believe it Peter said on the de Pentecost let this be knowto you the house of Israel that God's made the same Jesus who you crucified both Lord and Christ 16th verse of the second chapter yet God's made the same Jesus who crucified both Lord and Christ that all the house of Israel know surely talked to a Jew not long ago up here at the house of David he said you Gentiles can't cut God in three parts and giveing to a Jew we know better than that I said that's just it Rabbi we don't cut God no three parts I said Do you believe the prophets he said certainly I said um um Do You Believe Isaiah 9:6 he said yes I said who is the prophet speaking of Messiah I said What relation will Messiah be to God he said he will be God I said that's right amen there you are so you can't cut him in three parts if you missionaries here one of is going here to the Jews I this man sitting here well Sheri give God that you know Father Son and Holy Ghost he'll tell you right quick he know where it come from the I seeing counsel he won't listen to that but you let him see where the God was made flesh and he is the only God there is God made flesh in human form and lived among us to sanctify take away that he himself might come in the form of the Holy Ghost God the Father Holy Ghost is the same person the Bible said in the geologies of Jesus Christ in the first chapter of Matthew it said Abraham begot Isaac Isaac beg got Jacob on down said and then uh and how me you read it now you know just what I'm talking about Matthew the first chapter and we'll now let's begin at the 18th verse now the birth of Jesus Christ is on this WI when his mother Mary was exposed to Joseph before they came together she was found with a child of God the Father does that read that way found the child with who the I thought God the father was his father and God the father and the Holy Ghost is the Same Spirit who had two fathers then Joseph her husband being a just man not willingly make her public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of Lord appeared to him in saying Joseph thou son of David fear not taken thee marry thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the God the father huh the Holy Ghost then who was the father of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost what is that in you well that's God the Father too isn't sure and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus here's God the Father here's God the Holy Ghost here's God the son see that's three Gods the Bible said this two has to be the same or he had two fathers see you can't have two fathers you know that now she shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now this is all done that it might be fulfilled which is spoke by the Lord by the prophet saying a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth the son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which is by interpretation God With Us that's the first chapter of Matthew Matthew 28:19 where Jesus go baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost what is the name of the father son Holy Ghost Jesus Christ of course you read a love story said John and Mary lived Happy Ever After who is John and Mary go back to First the story and find out if there no such a thing no name father son or Holy Ghost and who whose name is it go back to first story and see who he's talking about Peter on the day of Pentecost said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins he had the Revelation John had the Revelation Jesus was the Revelation he produced himself right here in the scripture I am he the that was which is and shall come the almighty all right now let's get the seventh verse right quick now before we get out as quick as we can the almighty de glory and Dominion forever and ever amen made us Kings and Priests unto God his father and to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen see that Revelation there how is it revealed how God man scratch your heads and pull their hair and things trying to find out what father son Holy Ghost is make three of one don't pull your hair and scratch your head just look up Revelation comes from above that's right you reveal it's no father son Holy Ghost it's three offices that one God lived in he was in the office Spirit by himself because the human being is Condes scene then he made himself a body and Liv is to produce his own blood not through sexual like it was in the Garden of Eden but produce a creative body and through that virgin born body he gave a blood that Sanctified us and loosed us from our unbelief to believe on him now we do that we receive him into our heart that's God in us God Father Son and Holy Ghost see this is Prophet priest and king and the same thing all right now the seventh verse this is the announcement the announcement is behold he cometh with clouds and every I shall see him they also which pierced him and all the Kindred of the Earth shall wail because of him oh how much time we got that's beautiful there could you spare another 20 minutes could you all right and tomorrow tonight we'll try to catch the rest of the patmas vision tonight today we're going to end on the announcements oh you feel good you love this old Bible mer it is a revelation what what is it God reaches down in this book and takes the veil off said there he is prophet priest king father son holy ghost He that was which is and shall come all these things it is God now let's take the veil off just for a few minutes now the Lord helping us take the veil from our eyes and get behold he cometh with clouds how is he coming with clouds what kind of clouds Clouds Of Glory not one these thunderheads rainclouds but clouds of Glory Glory you watch what kind of a cloud he is in shrouded in when Peter and them saw his vision on Mount Transfiguration a cloud overshadowed him his rain would shine he was shrouded with a cloud the power of God oh we get to that over here in these Church ages I'm telling you just just tickles my innermost being to think of it what he's coming I see this day that where we're living where nothing no hopes left but his coming now we'll quickly get this now remember every eye shall see him now that wasn't a Rapture then was it wasn't a Rapture it wasn't a Rapture what was he speaking do the second coming and they also which pierced him and all the kinds of the Earth shall whail because of him now we go back get some history let's go back to Zachariah and get the 12th chapter of Zachariah Zach all right and the Lord added to the church daily such as would be saved how thankful we are for the good revelation of Jesus Christ aren't you happy for him now we will get this in book form just as quick as we possibly can to the people and then you can have it uh to read it and quiet of your room and things and studyed out yourself but oh all right [Music] Zachariah the uh Zechariah the 12th chapter now of Zechariah and we won't take this real prayerfully now and I want to get this for the glory of God now Zechariah 12 let's begin at the ninth verse listen close now he's speaking of the coming Zechariah 12 and we begin at the N the ninth verse and it shall come to pass Zechariah prophesying 487 years before the coming of Christ and it shall come to pass in that day that I will seek to destroy all nations that come against Jerusalem think of it and I will pour out upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced now when's the gospel returning to the Jews when the day of the Gentile is finished the gospel is ready to go to the Jews oh I could I could just for tell you a little something it's fixing to happen right here see right in this day see it's fixing to happen we get in the church age and this great thing is fixing to happen will carry over to Revelations 11 and pick up those two prophets Elijah and Moses returning back again for the Jews we're ready for it everything's set in order just ready this Gentile message as the Jews brought it to the Gentiles the Gentiles will take it right back to the Jews again and the Rapture will come now remember this year coming after the tribulation the church does not go through the tribulation we know that the Bible says that see all right now he'll pour out upon the house of Israel why the same Holy Spirit see after the Gentile church is gone and they look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one that mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his first born and in that day shall there be great mourning in Jerusalem and mourning and and the valley of mol and uh and the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the House of David apart and the family of the House of Nathan apart and each one of the houses apart when they see what will happen what will take place when he comes in the Clouds Of Glory at his second appearing and when those Jews who pierce the you know another scripture says they'll ask him where did he get these wounds he said in the House of my friends and not only will it be a mournful time for the Jews who rejected him as Messiah but it'll be a mournful time for them left Gentiles back here who has accepted who has rejected him as their Messiah of their faith they'll be wailing and weeping the sleeping virgin will be wailing that's that church that refused to get orl in its life there was 10 virgins went out all good people but five of them had all in their land the other five were good people good people but failed to get orl in their land and they were cast out into outer Darkness where there be weeping wailing and nashing of teeth here it is they'll be wailing the Bible said here they'll be wailing and so brokenhearted until even here I'll give you another Genesis 45 if you want to get to that let's get to it just a moment and read that also in Genesis the I believe the 45th chapter of Genesis I'd like to get this here Joseph making himself known to his to his people and we'll get this just show the the types of what will take place in that day now we bind together then Joseph could not refrain himself before them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go from me now remember Joseph making his KN he cried every man go from before me and there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known to his Brethren and he wept aloud and the Egyptians and the House of Pho H him he must have screamed out Joseph said un to his Brethren I am Joseph does my father yet live and his brother could not answer him for it they were troubled at his presence and Joseph said unto his Brethren come near me I pray you and they came near and he said I am Joseph your brethren who you who you sold into Egypt now therefore do not be grieved nor angry with yourselves that you have sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life oh how beautiful for these two years has famine been in the land and in which shall be there shall be neither be ear no Harvest and God sent me before you to preserve you a osty in the earth and to save your lives by great Deliverance let me just take now compare that with Zachariah the 12th just for a moment now we know that in type if you teach types then you always get it right I think in type now Joseph when he was born he was hated by his Brethren is that right I want to show you Joseph represents the spirit filled Church Joseph was hated of his Brethren why because he was spiritual Joseph could not help because he could see Vision he could not help because he dreamed dreams see and could interpret dreams that was what was in him he could not display anything else of what that was in him well then his brothers hated him without a cause but his father loved him because his father was a prophet see how it was with Jesus God loved his son but the Brethren the Pharisees and Sadducees hated him because he could heal the sick and foretell things and see Visions inter interpret see what I mean they hatte him without a cause and what did they do to Joseph they pretended he was dead and they throw him into a ditch took a bloody coat of seven colors at his father there only seven colors in the rainbow and the rainbow we know what that we get to it a little later I think tonight the rainbow over over him here Jesus where look up his Jasper and sard of stone and a rainbow rainbow is a covenant and that was God's covenant upon Joseph and then they blow it on his coat and took it back to the father and he supposed to be his dead and but he was raised up out of the ditch and was put into a uh sold to Pharaoh some in Egypt and a general keping and when they did he a ill thing come up against him and throw him in jail and there he prophesied and told two men where one would go and where the other a butler and the and a baker on kind of their dream and then he was exalted from there to the right hand of pharaoh and no man could touch Pharaoh only through Joseph watch this now the for [Music]

about here in a minute all right God bless you now we certainly appreciate each of you and the opportunity to be here with you we have um a scripture reading uh that we'd like to go to found we got three places I believe in uh Psalms 31 Ephesians chapter 6 and then also we'll take a scripture in Exodus I'll give you I'll quote those again we'll take Psalms 131 excuse me just for a moment actually before we read our scripture in Psalms let's take uh Genesis chapter 4 okay when you have that you can say Amen in verse number three and in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstling of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and King was very wroth and his countenance fell am man we'll take one more scripture in Exodus chapter [Music] 2 in verse number 23 and it came to pass in process of time that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their Cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage and God heard their groaning and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob and God looked upon the children of Israel and God had respect unto them amen we'll take one uh final scripture over in Psalms it's psalm 105 is that is the one that we want to read from verse number 15 we'll start with verse number 11 saying unto thee will I give the land of Canaan the lot of your inheritance when they were but a few men in number yay very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another from one Kingdom to another he suffered no man to do them wrong yeah he reproved Kings for their sakes saying touch not my anointed do my prophets no harm moreover he called for a famine upon the land he break the whole staff of bread he sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a servant amen we're going to take um this this um portion of the scripture and um speak on respects we'll speak on respects just for a moment so let's let's go back to Psalm 105 um and verse number one and it says oh give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the People Sing unto him sing Psalms unto him talk of all his wonderous Works Glory ye in His holy name let the heart of them Rejoice that seek the Lord seek the Lord and his strength seek his face Evermore remember His Marvelous works that he hath done his wonders and the Judgment of his mouth oh Seed of Abraham his servant ye children of Jacob his chosen he is the Lord Our God his judgments are in all the Earth he have remembered his Covenant forever the word which he commanded to a thousand Generations which Covenant he made with Abraham and his oath unto Isaac and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law and to Israel for Everlasting Covenant saying unto thee will I give the land of Canaan the lot of your inher inheritance we repeat that verse 12 again when they were but a few men in number yay very few strangers and in it when they went from one nation to another from one Kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yay he reprove Kings for their sake saying touch not my anointed do my prophets no harm amen let us pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on the reading of your word this morning I pray you help us Lord to deliver uh what you want us to say and the way you want us to say it in uh Lord the time that you've given to us we want to thank you Lord we do not take it lightly we appreciate it father and we're uh depending on you to speak to our hearts as you've always done in such a loving way in a way that would be edifying to us that when we leave from here we' be better Christians better men better women better young people it's our prayer it's our great desire in jesus' name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated now we certainly thank the Lord for the meetings we've had and we've gotten through those meetings and I know it was a lot of work hard work and we want to thank you Believers for um the deacons trustees boards and the sisters and just each one that did their part and we certainly appreciate that and we've been enjoying that still feasting on that and um I I was teasing with someone about the special meetings and then I've had several meetings with I think with everyone on the board and different families and so forth and really those are the special meetings I guess meetings after the meetings you know you have to meet and talk and deal and so we thank the Lord amen so on this little message respects it's such a vast topic and I don't know how many services will take to go into it but it seems like we can't even get out of the book of Ephesians because Ephesians chapter 6 as the little kids did their play on put on the whole armor of God and that whole uh equipment um just before that it kind of deals with the preparation of putting on the whole armor of God so let's just turn there quickly we've been there for many services in Ephesians chapter 6 and I trust it'll be a blessing to you as I was approaching this subject I come back into Ephesians chapter 6 and we know that we put on the whole armor of God which is the word of God but I like this in verse number five it says servants you have that there you say Amen if you got it yeah servants be obedient to them that are your master according to the flesh which Fear With Fear and Trembling and singleness of your heart as unto Christ not with eye Service as men Pleasers but as the Servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart with Good Will doing Service as to the Lord and what not to men knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall what he shall receive of the Lord whether he be Bond or free and your Masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is there respect of persons with him now this subject of respect or Godly fear um is something that it's all throughout the scriptures and I and it's very notable in the laws that the Lord made it very very clear his attitude towards uh respecting persons in judgment a good friend and you all know him brother banza he's from this from Congo Africa and then this latter years as a refugee into Rwanda because of wars and fightings and so forth and he is s of appreciative of being an American citizen in fact when we went to his wedding he he he took us up to the front this large wedding all these Africans and people from all over and he says I thank God God Bless America I was like well brother bonso I don't want to get that started here and so he was just showing his appreciation to the freedoms and the laws that we have and he shared with us many times that if a poor man is abused or any hurt or anything taken from him and he goes to the police and he's abused a from a rich man and he goes to the police is very seldom is very uh very often that he would get arrested for bringing such an accusation to a wealthy man or a man in power so the rule of law isn't just if you have money if you have position or power um you can get by and do things that maybe the other guy wouldn't do and the Lord didn't want this established and it's all through the scriptures have not respective persons um God doesn't have respective persons and that we are not to have respective persons in judgment and it's a human flaw and so so this is part of the problem with race issues that one race thinks they're better than the next race or one nation than the other one and you just pull out your Globe every continent on the globe has these problems they're a human problem and God makes men and then men wants to rule over men and they create these statuses and who's more important than the other we'll do it with gifts we'll do it with talents we do it with anything that we have we'll start measuring how much money did you make and how much are you getting for this job and then we start flexing it's a human flaw human problem the disciples had that issue it's through the scriptures and the Lord deals with it in Deuteronomy I'll start in uh in Leviticus ye verse 15 Leviticus 19:15 I'll quote some scriptures and he says ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor nor honor the person of the mighty but in righteousness shalt thou judge Thy Neighbor Thou shalt not go up and down as a tail Bearer among thy people neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor I am the Lord now that tail Bearer my my we got to chase that one down but we don't have time to do that this Whispers and people who talk we call it gospel uh uh gossiping uh the Hispanics might say chismosos this little just talking and and it's a human it's a human thing Leviticus 26: 3 and 12 says this here if you walk in my statutes keep my Commandments and do them then when I give you rain in due season your land will will yield her increase the Trees of the field shall yield their fruit your threshing shall reach unto the Vintage and the Vintage reach unto the sewing time he's talking about how you'll be abundantly blessed and how you'll begin to increase and even the rain and even your plants and your Harvest if you do and keep my Commandments verse 6 and I will give peace in the land and ye shall lie down and none of you shall make no one shall make you afraid I will rid the evil Beast out of the land neither shall the sword go through your land ye shall Chase your enemies and they shall fall Before You by The Sword five of you shall chase a hundred and a 100 of you shall put 10,000 to flight and your enemies shall fall Before You by The Sword for I will have respect unto you and make you fruitful and multiply you and establish Lish my Covenant with you and you shall eat of the old store and bring forth uh the old because of the new and I will set my Tabernacle among you and my soul shall not abore you and the scriptures go on so this is talking about if you keep the laws you keep my statutes that I will have re this is who we want to respect us is the Lord and many times we feel disrespected from our brother or our sister or someone disrespected my kids they disrespected my office and really that's going to happen but I shouldn't be looking for you or craving or needing respect from you be great will be nice but really my desire for respect should come from the Lord if the Lord will respect me then that's all I need I'm good I'll be good for the rest of my life if I can get the Lord respect when Abel and Cain came forth to bring forth their offering Abel did something and the Bible says that the Lord had respect unto his offering and when the Lord respected him the Lord Vindicated him isn't that what we all desire you know it' be great for every one of us to respect one another like we should but that's not going to always happen I'm a man you're a man we're flesh but don't you really desire the Lord to respect your prayer respect your cry respect your offering I'm giving this to you you know the Lord is still looking at what we come to give the Bible says that he stood back and he watched them giving in the offering the Widow and the great and they all and he watched them and he saw what she gave and she gave more than them all it had nothing to do with the amount he saw what she was giving from from her heart and the Lord is still looking at our offering today and we want the Lord to respect our offering so he respect our giving and respect what we do he looked at Israel he had respect unto them because of Abraham he looked at them he says if you keep my laws I will respect you if God respects you how are you not going to be blessed no matter who doesn't like you or acknowledge you they might not know who you are now it don't matter he he knows who you are he's got you covered you're not going to lose if the Lord respect you and this is really the desire that we have for eyes you know everyone wants someone looking at them looking up to them in respect but we want the Lord's eyes upon what we're doing and he looks upon our heart and he looks at our our our goals and our achieve he looks at our motives and our objectives and sometimes outwardly we might look a certain way to other people but really our heart is what the Lord sees and this um is followed in Deuteronomy 1: 8-18 just showing you that the Lord is establishing to his people not to have respect of persons in judgment don't look get people on the outside and judge them based on that can I get a witness this morning behold I have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers Deuteronomy 1 verses 8-8 Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them I spake unto you at that time saying I am not able to Bear you myself alone the Lord your God hath multiplied you and behold you are this day as the stars of Heaven for multitude the Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as you are and bless you as he hath promised you so that's a different time in the scripture than in Psalms where we read in Psalms 105 remember Psalms 105 says says that when you were few in number you're just a small group we didn't even know who you are as a nation you weren't on the map you're not very important but how important is Israel today how important is that Nation today the reason why we got the Bible today is because of that Nation the Old Testament writings how important but it started out just like a little bitty number of people but he says I will multiply you now that m multiplication started when they were in bondage in Egypt remember the Lord blessed them and they started having so many and then they started trying to put a tally on they wanted to to kill the men and save the women children under this bondage but the Lord be to increase them and but before that he says when you were few in number I rebuke Nations for you I brought down Kings for you when you were few in number when you had nothing when you were nobody no name at all but when God respects you and God respects respected Israel he gave them a name and a nation one of the most gifted and talented Nations on the earth their talents their gifts that they are their musical talents their intellectual talents the way the Lord has bless that Nation because he had respect unto them and this is the respect that we all desire we all long for God to respect us now um the scriptures and the quotes that I would read to you your mom or dad or your favorite preacher or whoever or listening to it tape to the tape that we would read to you and labor and lay out to you was only one part of you moving into what God would want you to be that's only one part reading the scriptures reading the quote playing the tape does not change you that's a start to the change but God has to do a work in you and make those words your words those scriptures become yours when you embrace the truth that you're hearing and it becomes yours then that's when it happens the Bible says that um he that heareth my words and Believe on me hath ever lasting light go out on the street do you believe on the Lord Jesus yeah I believe um and uh you believe he's raised from the dead oh yeah I believe does he have everlasting life eternal life well no he that heareth my words and believeth on him he that confesses with his mouth and believe uh in his heart he shall be saved it's not just confessing you got to believe in your heart I can teach a a parent I can teach any child or anyone to say I believe that Jesus is the son of God it doesn't mean they have eternal life doesn't mean that there's any change there the change happens when you receive it into your heart and I love something one of the ministers said during our meetings and I'll read that it's in a a quotation is brother brandham is referring to the children or after the resurrection when Jesus meets with his disciples on the road to emus and he is um talking to them and after all that the three years of him being there his ministry teaching seeing the signs and wonders it still wasn't enough enough for them something else had to happen in their life and he says this in the message when their eyes were open they knew him paragraph number 70 the prophet of God says this here now we notice again how he made himself known to them after he got in how did he do it he opened their eyes to see who he was when he got into them then he opened their eyes eyes to see now when the word comes into you when you accept God's word and it comes into you then the promise of that promise that you've accepted manifests itself then you know who it is by what did he do how did he make himself known to them because he did the same things he did before his crucifixion then they know that that that was him because he had raised from the dead all the preaching all the teaching and everything else he had done had failed but when he revealed himself doing the same thing he did before his crucifixion they knew it was him it opened their eyes amen so the opening of the eyes is what we want to take place in any service and that might happen one CE or twice or three it might be throughout the whole service you just want it to happen to you you can't catch everything but catch something Lord give me something a word something that I didn't have before open my eyes to this truth so he says all of the preaching all of the teaching that he had given before we're talking about the Lord Jesus all the preaching all the teaching it all fail failed until their eyes were open it's these eye openening moments of the service song service of your prayer closet of your take time of your Bible reading it's those eye openening moments that really make the difference in your life that's the Revelation that we all long for amen and so he deals with that so you know bringing these together I took a few m messages back on Divine love here some time ago we went through the messages on conduct order and Doctrine several Wednesdays on it and I got a lot of good comments from some some people and their fire was on and the the quotes were there it's like wow that's exciting but then you if you don't if you're not careful you'll Retreat you'll go back into some behaviors that's contrary to to the tapes contrary to the teaching because it needs to open up in your heart in your eyes and when that when that happens then you'll begin to do these things by Revelation now as I said I I know there's a number of messages that can come from this I don't know how many I'll do I know I got at least three sermons that I want to address in some of this because there there's so much on this respects and as you take the tape the message respects and listen to it brother brandham really breaks it down in examples of how different groups had disrespected the Lord he says when you disrespect the servant you dis you're actually disrespecting God when they disrespected Samuel or or Saul Samuel the prophet they were actually rejecting God when they did it gives the example of Elisha when those children started teasing him because of his bald head and you know it was like you know I if if if brother random identified a spirit for America it's it's the hahaa spirit it's a joking playing teasing I'm from that cloth I'm from a large family and either you laugh or you cry or you fight or something you're twisted and you need to be untwisted in a sense you know I have a loving family but you know we had our we had our spaces that you had to carve out your little space or somebody's going to eat eat your portion and you survive and God makes you that way for whatever purpose and you single single you know single child homes you have your challenges too everybody had their challenges all right the the the kid that don't didn't have any brothers or sisters wish they had a brother wish they had a sister and I always wish I had my own room and today I don't have my own room maybe on the other side I'll get my own room God bless you amen so but he was talking about those children how they disrespected um Elisha because his head was bald and what I was saying about you know the hahaa and the joking you know you got to be real careful because the scriptures are talking about this jessing and joking and I and I I've done it many times I'll tease and joke and I've heard others tease and joke about the third pool and how you make an example you know this person they're going through the third pool of their you know their pity party and will laugh and joke and say things like that but you know I really don't think those are subjects that are that we should be playing with it's not funny those are serious sacred truths it's so sacred that if Satan can get a hold of it he' do great damage but because we play and joke and laugh so much we can find ourselves joking and playing because it's so common with us over things that really should be sacred so Lord help me not to take these quotations of the message and knowing God has a sense of humor there's an appropriate place for humor but then there are things that you should we just shouldn't play with we got something else we can laugh at we don't need to use something sacred so we can laugh at for the expense of of getting a joke being funny getting the attention on ourselves so brother vam deals with that Elisha and what he taught us was that in the home those parents spoke against Elisha so the children now had a disrespect towards him and it wouldn't be you I mean you it doesn't seem like it was a a disrespect like they called him a bad name or sore at him or threw a rock at him they just said go up thou Baldhead and they laughed and he cursed them in the name of the Lord and the sheers came and uh devoured him and brother R says that wasn't the action of the holy spirit that was the false or in the the bad teaching he says those children when they saw Elisha even though they didn't agree with him they should have said God bless you man of God and just let it Let It Go like that or don't say nothing at all it's better don't say nothing at all if say it's something you don't understand that's that's the better way but in the message uh being led of the Holy Spirit brother bham says this here 1956 he says paragraph number 38 and today that's today that's the thing today we see people people are so subject in this day to jumping at little flowery things till it makes you kind of wonder sometimes don't never think above one man above another no sir no matter who he is if he's just a little fellow out here giving tracks or out on the street if he's a Billy Graham no matter who he is if he's God's servant respect them all the same everyone don't have one above another and favorites we don't have that don't do that don't respect one person above another let everybody be on the level all right now is that that easy to do do we have our favorites sure is that easy it's not easy to do but we don't want to judge people based on their finances you know people that have money they get a lot of respect from people because they have money but really our respect towards a man or woman or human being is through the lens of God's word we look at at that brother that sister that sinner whoever it is through the lens of God's word and we don't respect people one above the other we shouldn't at any cost so brother bam deals with that now he talks about how he can lose respect for a man that that wouldn't keep his word he he makes this statement in um Love 1956 July uh 26 1956 he says this here paragraph 25 now you get when you get those ideas you're wrong that's right don't you never think that man has anything to do with it it's God alone it's all right for you to respect men and to love them as your brother but don't never put the love of anybody in your heart like you have of God or for God keep him first love one another but that love in the Greek is love is felio which means human love but the love you have for God is agapo love which is divine love so now keep God's love first and so brother ROM continues on so I'm sorry I didn't read that one that I had yes we continue on in the message the F father the Al has has come he's dealing with this brothers that you might disagree with and and so forth in paragraph number 3056 he says this here and then if we become Christian we must put all the loyalty and respect in honor on the Lord Jesus Christ then if we're not and do not believe it don't just wishy-washy about it just let the world know where you're standing that's the best way and it will be a great day when the church comes to that place its members rather that whether it will either be for Christ or against Christ then the whole world will know how you stand I don't like anyone to Pat me on the shoulder and say now brother bam I really love you when he knows that I know different see he knows that I know different cuz his Spirit just doesn't fit right and it just isn't there and so I then I lose respect for that person I like to see a man if he said now look I disagree with you with that well then he's honest about it but Ahab wasn't that kind of a person he was the one who wanted to serve the Lord one time and his wife wanted to do something else then he turned that way and have the prophets killed and so forth one of those wishy-washy up and down in and out God can never do nothing with a person like that he couldn't in that day or any day could he ever use a person like that amen so we just want to be who we are if we don't see something we disagree with something that's fine that's what you see you disagree or you like something but don't pretend like you like or say you do if you really don't and brother bam says El Lo respect for a person that would do that tell them you love them and they really don't in their heart all right so we could see that you know that we can have respect and then we can lose that respect too if we do things that are that that lack that you know lack those um you know those core values of just being honest and being who you are I think people respect you when you just say what you are what you believe they they know you disagree with them they know where you stand but then you're not trying to destroy them you're not going behind their back to hurt them you're just telling them you know this is where I stand this is what I see don't you wouldn't you appreciate that or would you want you know people to love you and a and behind the scenes they really don't you know that's just a it's just a toxic environment to be in right and so we want to be who we really are are now the scriptures continue on in dealing with how to respect one another and respect in our judgments and the things that we would say and do in Deuteronomy uh 16 verse 19 says Thou shalt not rest judgment Thou shalt not respect persons neither take a gift for a gift does blind the eyes of the wise and pervert the words of righteous pervert the words of the righteous Deuteronomy 16:19 you know in this uh this is another translation that says it do not pervert Justice or show partiality um is using that same you know respective person of showing part IAL it to someone in judgment because of their family name or because of their position because of their clout or their status you know you have to treat everybody the same and that's a challenge huh sure Psalms 40:4 it says blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust and respected not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies Psalms 138:6 says though the Lord be high yet hath he respect unto the lowly but the proud he knoweth a far off and so this is you know this is the god that we serve you know the Lord respects he sees everybody he sees an honest heart he sees where you're coming from if you're honest and truthful doesn't matter you have all this other stuff and maybe others look better or bigger than you or maybe they're more spiritual than you the Lord will respect you if you're honest and you just honor his word he'll hear your prayer hear your cry and he'll give ear to you and this is the respect that we're longing for you know when you want respect from a worldly perspective you'll do things that you shouldn't do you'll dress in a way and get attention that you shouldn't get because you're trying to get somebody else's respect but the Lord doesn't respect that don't you want his respect amen one Psalms 24:23 says these things also belong to the wise it is not good to have respect of person in judgment Proverbs 28:21 to have resp of persons is not good for for a piece of bread that man will transgress now one one of our new testament examples to this truth is in Acts chapter 10 and the scripture is dealing with the great Apostle Peter and how many love Peter wouldn't you want Peter on your team cut somebody's ear off even speak things that he shouldn't speak Peter was on Peter was on a 10 he was ready ready to go and uh you know you have encourage him to fight for what was what he thought was right and you need kind of need a little craziness on your team sometime it's the Fanatics that get the message out many times and this is Peter he is he um openly uh as the Lord was trying to bring the gospel to Cornelius he deals with Peter in vision and Peter hesitated and in the vision he says Lord Lord I've never eaten anything common or unclean and the Lord had to show him don't call that common or unclean I'm respecting a man who has given arms who has prayed he's not in the Commonwealth of Israel you don't even know who he is but he praying and his prayers have come up to me for arms you don't know who he is yet nobody knows who he is all the disciples they don't know who this man is yet but I know who he is and Cor Millions got God's respect and when God respects you the doors will open for you that's the friend that you need that's the person it's not what you know it's who you know that's the person who you need to know who needs to know you is if you can get God's respect and that and that comes when you do what's right when wrong is handed to you it's not always your reaction It's the reaction to an action and it's placed there before you and something is maybe laid out in your path that you did not deserve it's wrong and you handle it with the word of God with the humility of the scriptures with the anointing of the Holy Ghost the Lord sees every bit of that the church might not see it the pastor might not see it your parents might not see it your husband might not see it your your wife might not see it the congregation might not see it but there is somebody who sees all things and you'll never come up short when you're doing what's right because he sees it all he sees it all looks like you don't see it looks like maybe somebody else is getting over but if you're doing what's right God sees you my brother my sister and I encourage you to continue to do that um he saw Cornelius didn't he he's famous today but he wasn't known then but God made him known to Peter now this is interesting with Peter he had an issue with the Gentiles as the Jews did amongst the Gentiles the Gentiles of those heathens those dogs and he had an issue with them the Lord had to show him a vision to get him to go into this gentile's home sit down and eat with this man eat with him well the Lord had to reveal that to him and we see he still had this issue in Galatians Chapter 2 let's turn there quickly just to show you it's a human issue a problem amongst the best of us and you think you know you think it don't exist exist today it absolutely exists today there are people who play favorites H just so happen I'm not one of them now if you if that was your thought you're wrong my brother my sister if that's my thought I'm wrong I play favorites you play favorites human beings play favorites but Lord help me not to respect men based on their gift their talents their economics their looks but respect them through the word of God Amen Lord help us let's take this scripture is uh Galatians Chapter 2 I think is verse 11 but when Peter was come to Antioch I with stood him to the face because he was to be blamed for before that certain came from James he did eat with the Gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision and the other Jews disassembled likewise with him so he influenced others in so much that Barnabas also was carried away with their disass imulation what does that word mean somebody look that up for me real quick and give me the definition I know it's not you know it's a disagreement or just give it to me real quick all right but when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel I said unto Peter before what in private what' he do and my mom said you acted up in public I'mma get you in public you embarrass me in public I'm going to embarrass you in public that's what she would say and this is where this is the this is the precept that that Paul is dealing with here Peter wasn't a nobody Peter was a real man Peter was a True Believer but he got caught up in this thing he's eating with the Gentiles these brothers who's just coming in and he's eating with them and at the table with them and then a certain amount of Jews come of the circumcision he sees them and he's separated and then he got Barnabas involved and he got all the other Jews involved it was terrible what he did what do you think those Gentiles felt like that was eating with brother Peter and then all of a sudden he gives him a cold shoulder I mean we cool right now talking everything's good then you get up and just walk I might I was just telling you a testimony and you walk off because I'm a gentile tell me that feels good how many you ever had something like that happen to you few human beings in here few human beings in here sure how many's ever did that to somebody the altar will be open yes it's a it's a human flaw it's a human it's a human thing you know we we have those we have those you know weaknesses that we get caught up into and Peter a true Apostle a True Believer got off track here and it was was in him because we see it with corneus here it happens again and he's got other involves and Paul said I had to rebuke him to his face I withstood him and told him Peter you're wrong bro you are wrong to treat your brothers the Gentiles that way just because of whatever class you're in and make your Gentile Brothers feel that way as you could this dissim disass simulation what does that mean you have it brother Joe who thank you concealment of one's thoughts feelings and character pretense I'm sure there's another an attempt at dimation all right thank you that's a bit more than you guys are good so I bless you it's this you know creating these little issues these little problems can I take five or 10 more minutes it's only 11:40 all right thank you so thank you so this disrespects is it's hypocrisy thank you it's hypocrisy like you're here we're good over here but then when my family comes I change on you or people with more influence or more money come I change on you but I you know I love you brother Sean you're my friend and we're hanging out together we go out to eat together I do things that embarrass you you do a few things that embarrass me keep it at 100 as they say but but but you're my friend we're out to eat you know if another group of important business people or whoever Ministry in the city come in and I get up and walk from your table would that be nice that's incorrect and and Paul saw it and he rebuked him to his face it's wrong for you to do it what does this show us it shows us that men filled with the Holy Ghost who are leaders who handle the word of Truth who were spokesman who were Jesus's rightand man has fallen into this so you're capable too and this is why the word of the Lord is here for us to remind us on this respect of persons respect of you know a Godly person comes into your missed I think it's James chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 when a man with good Godly apparel comes in he gets a great seat when one comes in he's all roughed up he's all looking not very nice we treat him a certain way we ought not to do that we not we ought to give them the time to at least hear where they're coming from huh am I saying something to somebody is this true or no don't let brother pet tell you his testimony should I squeeze a little bit of it out to you brother blei came to the message and you know the church said he came into the message this is testimony he he said he smelled bad cuz he was a street guy he was on the streets his hair was long and his clothes were dirty and he says in the assembly there he said they're all great lovely people he was talking about you know North side the church that's what he was talking about it's his testimony openly says it all right no indictment on that was in the 70s way back whenever he came in and he said that there was only one brother that befriended him enough to tell him that you know you need to take your clothes to the laundry and wash them and clean and come to church like that and and he he never knew he said he felt so bad he would come to church he loved to hear Brother Muse preach and loved to hear his singing But then after the service he just felt like an outsider now now we we we have done that we've been guilty of that and we do that because of whatever our experience are when you see somebody with a full beard you see them with her collar up you see him with a tattoo whatever it is we we make those judgments on people and those are not signs of whether somebody's even a seed of God or even a believer or even worthy of time or no time have no respect of persons in judgment for the small the great whoever they are it's a human flaw and typically people who do good Who come out of something who God has showed them something they are susceptible of looking down at people because you come out of something you're susceptible of looking down on people okay I'm not talking about people I'm talking about spirits all right okay so Peter had this little flaw can I go a little bit further here now brother random deals in the message respects and there's so much in there that we can bring but I want to get to this one part here it's at the end of the message we'll go back through it at another time cuz I'm going to close here just now and he and he says this here about what AA Allen did to him and he says I think it's in paragraph 205 sisters brothers in the back there he says this here and as I started to go through this I was like whoa this is really this really something now we heard this we listened to this I've heard this many times but to put this in practice ractice it's really something else we ask you all to read I think it was Matthew chapter 18 remember that scripture we ask you all to read and we can read that we know yeah you got a brother be you know you got a a problem with a brother you need to go to him alone we could say that we can read that but yet and still do we practice that and that's been one of the flaws or weaknesses in my own personal character that I've seen that weakness in this city in particular and amongst you know everybody's talking about one another but you're not talking to the person that you're talking about they don't even know you're talking about them and you they deserve that the scripture says you owe it to go to them brother R says if if I taught anything that was wrong in the scriptures you are Duty bound to come to me and show me in the scriptures where I'm wrong and thankfully there's a number of Brothers in this city that I know that have done that we've sat and talked we agree to disagree total respect I respect them I love them I know where they stand on the subject they know where I stand on the subject but they came to me and I think that's and that's why I respect them if I see them if they come into this church here today I have the utmost respect because how they handled their disagreement all right amen so let's take this as we as we prepare to close here in paragraph number 20 is it 205 very good so I think we might be a different yeah that's 205 we we'll go down a little bit we'll catch that one another time we'll take number 209 so he's talking about the G he talks about the gifts how to respect that he talks about people that go into the Flesh and all of that but look at this in paragraph 208 but here in the Tabernacle we want you all to know these things here when God begins to pour out the Holy Spirit upon people sometimes I know I've seen people get in the flesh when they were under the anointing of the spirit I seen them go to extreme with things but what but don't you say nothing about it you respect it bow your head you might not understand it neither would I but I want to respect it anyhow now we must have respects to God and when God pours out the Holy Spirit I just thank say thank you Heavenly Father you're doing something for that poor precious soul that wants to come to your your home like I do someday I seen men like here one time a brother that's in the ministry said that I talked about him and we went and got all the taints and sent to him it was brother AA Allen he said that I made fun of him talking about blood coming out of your hand and calling that initial evidence of the Holy Ghost and I believe it was blood and oil coming out of his hand and forehead and things he said was that I made fun of and told him that it was of the devil I sat back I just wrote him a letter I said brother Allan he wrote a piece you read it dear brother bandam see and so then put out tracks all across the all across the country instead of coming and see me about it he did that but now here's what I said I said I'll take up all six nights at Phoenix I'll send you my tapes and show which Leo and them did sent the tapes to them I said only one time was your name called people put it on my desk and said brother brandham brother Alam has just been in town told us the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost was bleeding in the hands and bleeding in the face oil running out of your hand that was the initial evidence I said I disagree with brother Allan upon that being the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost cuz there was nowhere in the Bible where they ever bled at the hands of oil coming out their face and hands of proof Pro that they had the Holy Ghost I said the Holy Ghost was the power of God in their lives and Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe see in my name shall they cast out devils and so forth but I said here's one thing I would say about brother Allan he's a great man of God and if I could preach as good as brother Allan could i' never have a healing service I just preached the gospel then see after he's done put that paper out and everything that I did that just on what somebody else said but even I disagreed with the brother upon his theory I certainly wouldn't want to blaspheme the brother and then standing right there up here in Minnesota at night in Minneapolis Minnesota there was a great Cathedral temple with Gordon Peterson and this guy that wrote the book about AA Allen he said everything about him that could be said he even had the audacity to he said he said he even had the audacity to write that book of biting Devils about the woman showed a print on her hands of a devil bit her and things like that now I certainly I don't know whether that could be true or not because the Devil is a spirit you see but this woman claimed a big hairy devil come and bit her all over her hands and all over her face everything like that and he said a a Allen wrote that book and the man that wrote the book wrote a nice article about me he uh here he was sitting right there in the meeting that night when brother Peter Pon and then come and told me there he sit and was bragging on me and Downing a a Allen I thought here's the time I could take up for brother Allan now would I have done that would you have done that brother this brother this sister actually accused you of something that wasn't even true didn't even call you or ask you about it and then here's another person that's now getting on that brother that accused you and taking up for you you well whose side you going to be on right let's be human beings here for a minute take the Holy Ghost Halo off from over your head and let's be honest for a minute how would you behave how would you offer operate H here brother brandom is now publicly at the pull pit taking up for this gentleman that put things in the paper all across about him and never came to him him and now he's taking up for him and this is what he says and this is really good now I want to I want to just lay this out and then we'll close so I walked out there I said I was reading here the article in the paper today that this certain man that's in the city knowing he was sitting right out there I said he said here that AA Allen and the criticism I said although I appreciate the man saying the compliment about me that he did I said that wasn't that I wasn't out for money and things like that and he held the cleanest meetings of any of of them and so forth the nice things he said I said I appreciate that but if that man that wrote this article here in the paper never checked his notes any closer than to say AA Allen wrote this Bing of devils AA Allen never wrote that book I know the man that wrote it I said he never wrote the book at all if the man never checked up on his article any closer than that I doubt the rest that he's ever said about Allan is the truth brother Allen is a truth taking up for brother Allen and I said besides look at your neighbor and say besides besides if brother Allan would be wrong I'd rather be found at the Judgment bar taking my stand with brother Allen in the wrong when he's trying to win souls to Christ then to be criticizing what the man's trying to do amen that's right yes sir everyone calls on the name of Jesus Christ I'm with him whether he's Protestant catholic whatever brother bam goes on you might disagree with him so there's so much more in this message but here W that's a good one that's a good one even if he's wrong if he's trying to do something for Christ even if he's wrong you know I'm a picky eater what I said before spiritually speaking I like to listen to people that's reading the quotes I really do I appreciate that but you can get over picky and then you start becoming critical and that I don't want is a critical spirit because it doesn't stop if you criticize that do you criticize this there's everything that can be critiqued it doesn't stop and you bow your heads don't say nothing about it you know there's things said right here at this Pulpit different Ministries that come I you know I I've talked to the brothers they know my position on the word and I've tried to um be clear with this church where I stand I have a a great respect for the people here and any other audience that I'm preaching or ministering to I respect the subject matter that what I'm bringing you the prophet brought it I try to hold that respect and and um but you know special meetings you have people that come and even they don't even speak maybe they're in the meetings they're inviting they're saying things and their groups and their ministers and they say things that you need to be careful of and you know if you got a question about it you need to ask you need to ask your pastor and or or don't but I I I could tell you you know there's people that come and they do things and I find out and then I hear their background I'll call other pastors other ministers and I know no I'm not going to deal with that I don't want anything to do with that and I certainly hope that that brother do get tied up with this one and get tied up with that one because there's a spirit on that brother and he's here amongst our midst and then people just open their hearts their homes their children their Ministries up to these gifts you got to be careful of you got to judge everything by the word absolutely you know as it pertains to this church in this Pulpit I try to um to um keep that communication open with the brothers you see something that's not right you come tell me there's a a a comment Bo you have a question about anything you can ask me you can't ask me write it on a piece of paper put it in the comment box in the back there that's what we here for that's what we're here to do is to help with that but you know this this um you know even if a brother is wrong there's still a respectful way of disagreeing with the brother that is that is the point that I'm making and so I've seen this disrespect amongst the um uh the youth with their you know you know Moses's sister disrespected him and she had the commonality of knowing him that's her Junior brother that's her little brother but she disrespected him and and I'm I'm only going to say this because it's on the tape not criticizing sister brandom at all she was a true servant of God but brother Brandon brings that example where she got out of the line and disrespected him and the angel of the Lord didn't like it and if you think that brother bam didn't love his wife or the angel of the Lord didn't love sister Brown you would be absolutely wrong but just to show you Peter got off and here brother randam exposes this on tape how real is that to you this is his wife who was frustrated with the kids and the whole thing and the pressures and she said something or she slammed the door I think it was slammed the door in his face you all are familiar with it right I don't I don't like to bring it up but it's on the tape and it's for our warning for our edification slam door in his face well she shouldn't have slammed the door in brother B's face is there anybody's face that we should slam the door in that's the point right there oh so yeah you slam the door in Satan's face but sometimes we think Satan is on my so you got to be careful with that amen you be careful you slam the door you slam a door in a in a Brother's face slam the door you're in a sis your wife's face some people some people don't respect a wife just because she's a woman just because you know there's a disrespect just because she's a woman I am not going to listen to No Woman tell me nothing what she's saying is right don't matter she's out of her place well you need to pick up your Bible and read your Bible huh sure and so we don't res we we we respect the word we respect your office you slam the door in your mama's face slam the door in your daddy's face slam the door in your husband's face slam the door in your wife's face really as Believers you know we need to really check that when we fear one another when we love one another then brother B says we fear one another and that's a respect that we have for one another and that respect and brother mam gives this example with AA Al did to him that you know he shouldn't have did that brother Allen should have came to him and told him found out about it before writing a public paper dealing with it so God help us to have thisr I just have to stop here okay don't you love the Lord God bless you if the musicians will come it's a whole another part I have several parts I need to get to but I want to just lay that out for you there maybe tonight we can play a portion of that so let me thank you okay we'll keep sister Peggy and prayer Peggy Thorn here she's not feeling well she was here this morning God bless her so let me let me read that quote that I started with uh this morning one more time for you as we close it says it's in the message when their eyes were open paragraph number 71 now when the word comes into you when you accept God's word and it comes into you then the promise of that promise that you've accepted manifest itself itself and then you know who it is but what did he do how did he make himself known to them because he did the same things he did before his crucifixion then they know that that was him because he had raised from the dead all the preaching all the teaching and everything else he had done had failed but when he revealed himself doing the same thing he did before his crucifixion they knew it was him it opened their eyes so this my brothers and sisters is not just information on on what's respect what's disrespectful you want God's respect what God disrespects and all this is a revelation that we need Lord give me the love give me the respect for your word first the members of the body next and then to the stranger or The Sinner amen God bless you let us pray father we ask your blessings on the word that we spoke the few words that we spoke Lord we certainly Lord want to respect this pull Pit and the ears of these people even the young people Lord that we would say things in a way that would be edifying to them edifying to the brothers and sisters oh God in this disrespectful age Cain was a disrespect ful looked you in the face and said am I My Brother's Keeper just rude disrespectful his attitude wasn't right Lord we don't want that Spirit on us um it might be my son or my daughter it might be one of the little ones it might be my wife it might be some brother who who don't have a full Revelation whatever it might be Lord I Lord I want to respect everybody properly and I want I want to respect
