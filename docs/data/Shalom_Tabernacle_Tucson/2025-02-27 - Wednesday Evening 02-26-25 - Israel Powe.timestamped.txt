[26:55] time we um in l cruus this past week and
[27:00] we came back here and had a wonderful
[27:02] powerful testimony Sunday night if you
[27:05] didn't hear that you need to hear that
[27:06] it really encouraged my faith brother
[27:10] Kim ding Wall's daughter how she that
[27:15] family went through cancer eight years

[27:39] witness is true amen so as you're
[27:42] standing we like to go right into the
[27:44] word this evening in this new testament
[27:48] scriptures I know the good speeds are
[27:50] going to be leaving on Friday we want to
[27:53] pray for them also sister Lucille McCoy
[27:57] we'll keep her in
[27:59] prayer um brother Ben had a praise

[28:04] his job there and the Lord worked it all
[28:07] out for him today and he wants to thank
[28:09] the Lord from that amen and
[28:12] so we'll take our prayer request in just
[28:15] a moment but in Matthew chapter 13
[28:28] verse number
[28:31] three we'll also take Revelations
[28:35] 3:18
[28:37] okay
[28:39] yes and he spake many things unto them
[28:41] in Parables saying Behold a swer went
[28:45] forth to seow when he had sowed some
[28:48] seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls
[28:51] came and devoured them up some fell upon
[28:54] Stony places where they had not much
[28:57] Earth and for with they sprung up
[29:00] because they had no deepness of Earth
[29:02] when the sun was up they were scorched
[29:05] because they had no root they withered
[29:08] away and some fell among thorns and a
[29:10] thorn sprung up and choked them but
[29:13] other fell in good ground and brought
[29:15] forth fruit some 100 fold some 60 fold
[29:19] and some 30 fold who hath ears to hear
[29:24] Let Him hear let's take verse number
[29:32] 22 23 but he that receiv seed in the
[29:36] good ground is he that heareth the word
[29:40] and understandeth it which also beareth
[29:44] fruit and bringeth forth some 100-fold
[29:48] some 60 some 30
[29:52] amen I know it's the Lord's desire that
[29:55] we understand what we read and what we
[29:58] listen to and if we don't understand it
[30:01] we need to ask the Lord to open our
[30:04] understanding we don't have to act like
[30:06] we understand something when we don't
[30:09] but he can open our understanding even
[30:12] the little ones to the old ones he'll
[30:15] give you something that you can
[30:17] understand Amen in Revelations chapter 3
[30:20] verse number
[30:24] 18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[30:28] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[30:30] rich and white rment that thou mayest be
[30:33] clothed and that the shame of thy neck
[30:35] andness do not appear and anoint thy
[30:39] eyes with isav that thou mayest see
[30:46] amen just for a little tle title tonight
[30:49] pre predestinated seed and soil
[30:52] predestinated seed and soil and so may
[30:57] God bless you you may be
[30:59] seated we know that this um prophecy or
[31:03] the parables are
[31:06] natural testimonies that have deeper
[31:09] implications of spiritual things so
[31:12] Jesus taught many in Parables a swer
[31:15] went to sew or a farmer went to sew a
[31:18] field or a good man of the house or
[31:21] someone went to go build he gives these
[31:23] examples in Parables and um this is the
[31:27] parable of the seed being sewed and we
[31:31] see that the seed which we know is the
[31:33] word of God in one instance was seed in
[31:37] four different places and it was sewed
[31:41] in um Stony places it was sewed amongst
[31:46] you know shallow ground it was sewed in
[31:49] many different atmospheres but the place
[31:52] where it really thrived was when it was
[31:54] sewed in good
[31:56] ground and that good ground as we'll see
[31:59] brother bam tells us was the
[32:02] predestinated ground that was a ground
[32:04] that was pre prepared ground that was
[32:08] already prepared now as on our Sunday
[32:12] Services we've been in the Book of
[32:14] Joshua and talking about how successful
[32:17] his ministry was and how our example
[32:20] should be to stand like Joshua stand
[32:23] like Caleb and we looked at their uh
[32:26] examples and we could see how successful
[32:30] he was seemingly a bit more successful
[32:34] than even Moses he got the people to do
[32:38] what he wanted them to do he was even so
[32:42] bold to tell the son to stand still I
[32:45] like who you talking to I mean we never
[32:48] heard nobody command the
[32:51] son but he did it and the son obeyed
[32:55] him and never was a day like that that
[32:58] that the sun obeyed the voice of a man
[33:02] and even commanded the Moon too but if
[33:05] we really think and look at it Israel
[33:07] had been through a great
[33:11] purging right at kades
[33:15] Baria kades Baria got rid of a lot of
[33:19] the grumblers the
[33:21] complainers and the elders that couldn't
[33:23] see it and could this and that had were
[33:26] upset they had already tempted the Lord
[33:28] so he's really dealing with a fresh
[33:30] clean group a a group that have been
[33:34] purged and so it is the design of the
[33:37] father to purge all of us and the
[33:40] purging is the correction correction is
[33:43] what we all need pastors newcomers
[33:47] sisters brothers any believer that's
[33:50] going to go forward with the Lord you've
[33:53] got to be able to receive correction and
[33:56] that happens like for the rest of your
[33:59] life like when is it going to stop it
[34:01] doesn't stop for the rest of your
[34:06] life and truth be told many of us don't
[34:09] like the correction actually the Bible
[34:11] tells us it's not convenient when it
[34:14] happens it's embarrassing we don't like
[34:17] to receive the correction but we want
[34:19] more fruit we want to grow we want our
[34:22] Ministries to grow we want our gifts to
[34:24] be flourishing we want the Lord to use
[34:26] us we want the anointing in our life how
[34:29] many want that want the anointing in
[34:31] your life want the Holy Ghost to use you
[34:34] on every
[34:36] level well in order for that to happen
[34:38] there has to come a purging now brother
[34:42] brandham is dealing with this group in
[34:44] Leo DEA the group that needed their isaf
[34:49] and he made the comment that they wasn't
[34:52] really blind they were
[34:55] nearsighted so that kind of puts it in
[34:57] view for us Christians today and we'll
[35:00] read for you here and see if that will
[35:02] help you all right in the message um
[35:05] leoan Church the prophet says this in
[35:08] paragraph
[35:09] 189 he says also they were blind now
[35:12] that's a bad way to be I don't think
[35:15] these Christians were so blind as they
[35:18] was
[35:21] nearsighted I believe they were
[35:24] nearsighted the only thing they could
[35:26] look at was their big buildings only
[35:29] thing they can look at was their big
[35:31] congregation the only thing they looked
[35:33] at was their well garnished choir with
[35:36] all of its big robes and things I think
[35:39] they was just
[35:41] nearsighted they couldn't see over their
[35:44] nose hardly oh my I don't think they
[35:46] were blind they were just
[35:49] nearsighted all they could see was there
[35:52] well you know what we belong to so and
[35:55] so they're big denominations they're big
[35:57] crowd many members their Sunday school
[36:00] their fine buildings you know I like the
[36:03] way the brother random puts that because
[36:04] it kind of settles it in that we can
[36:07] receive that if I told you you was blind
[36:10] that's pretty harsh but if I tell you
[36:12] you were nearside you're just not seeing
[36:14] the full picture
[36:16] sis brother you're just not seeing the
[36:20] full uh uh gamut of what the word is
[36:23] saying you can receive that better right
[36:25] and so here brother random is talking
[36:27] about Christians that they're not blind
[36:30] they're just nearsighted you can see but
[36:33] your vision is
[36:34] blurry and the word of the Lord comes to
[36:39] open your understanding open your vision
[36:42] the Holy Spirit wants your vision to be
[36:45] clear so you can see where you're going
[36:47] see how to stand see the hour that
[36:50] you're living in and I see that many of
[36:54] us have had these times where we're not
[36:58] looking at the picture fully yes
[37:01] sometimes we're just looking at
[37:02] ourselves what's in it for me how much
[37:04] I'm going to get out of it you know
[37:06] who's going to recognize me I'm the
[37:08] gifted one I'm The Talented one they
[37:10] should always look after me and me me me
[37:13] me and but you're not looking at it
[37:15] right my brother you're not looking at
[37:18] it right my sister just a little
[37:22] nearsighted and so when we look at the
[37:24] word the word of the Lord
[37:28] has prepared every one of us to be
[37:31] exactly where we are
[37:33] today can I get a
[37:36] witness there's nobody can keep a
[37:38] blessing from
[37:40] you come on like they just take they're
[37:43] just taking all the blessings from me
[37:46] can nobody keep a blessing from
[37:48] you God knows exactly where you live
[37:52] that's right he knows your
[37:55] boss he knows the team you're working
[37:58] with he knows his job he knows exactly
[38:01] how much money you making he knows
[38:04] exactly what you have need of and it's
[38:08] just up to him Amen to open the windows
[38:11] of heaven or close the
[38:13] door who do you want in control of your
[38:16] life you want to take over your finances
[38:18] you want to you want to design a
[38:20] security team to watch over your family
[38:22] and all your
[38:24] junk security to watch over my
[38:28] my my car all my stuff all of your
[38:34] junk the best thing that can watch over
[38:36] your stuff is the good Lord Jesus over
[38:39] your home over your family over your
[38:41] health over your life over your children
[38:45] over your ministry that's all in God's
[38:48] hands so we as Believers we rest in his
[38:51] arms and when he brings us
[38:54] correction the mature Believers say yes
[38:58] Lord remember that that that man that
[39:02] threw stones at David before he was
[39:05] anointed yeah that's good spit on him
[39:07] and called him all kind of names and
[39:09] David had the power to shut this man up
[39:12] but he said no no leave him alone the
[39:15] Lord allowed him to come against me and
[39:19] all of our tests and trials are
[39:22] predestinated just like our blessings
[39:24] are
[39:25] too amen they're supposed to talk about
[39:29] you they're supposed to make you mad
[39:32] they're supposed to get on your nerves
[39:35] right but how are you supposed to react
[39:37] to it h and so this
[39:41] nearsightedness is what Christians are
[39:44] many times now brother bam goes forward
[39:47] and talks about this correction a little
[39:48] bit in his unfailing words of promise
[39:50] and he says this here Jesus himself when
[39:53] he came he knew he was the word he was
[39:57] POS positive of that for when he was
[39:59] just 12 years old a little boy we find
[40:01] him like I was speaking yesterday in the
[40:03] temple debating with the priest his
[40:06] knowledge could surpass their Traditions
[40:09] he was teaching them men and when his
[40:11] own mother come to him and said a word
[40:14] that was wrong watch the word correct
[40:17] the error the word always corrects the
[40:20] error and if people can only see it
[40:23] today the word corrects the error the
[40:25] whole thing is become an error
[40:27] but God's word is what is right he said
[40:30] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[40:32] words shall not pass away and the word
[40:35] that is prophesied for this day corrects
[40:39] the error of the day you understand the
[40:43] word itself corrects the error the
[40:47] people today say oh let's join this
[40:49] let's go to the council let's do all
[40:52] these things that's an error and the
[40:54] word comes back and corrects that era by
[40:59] identifying itself the hour the time of
[41:02] the hour now we know these things are
[41:05] true so we see where our correction
[41:08] comes from comes from the word doesn't
[41:12] come from someone's
[41:13] feelings or what I think or how I you
[41:16] know how the way others have done it
[41:19] always the correction comes from the
[41:22] word and the word for our day can you
[41:26] say praise the lord lord
[41:27] so end the word for that day is what's
[41:30] going to correct us keep us tuned up
[41:33] prune us purges us once God plants a
[41:38] good Vine a good tree it's his job that
[41:41] that tree succeeds and it grows and the
[41:44] way he allows that tree to succeed is he
[41:47] allows droughts Hard Times harsh weather
[41:51] winds you know the elements of the
[41:53] outside have to toughen that plant
[41:56] toughen that tree tree up and he allows
[41:59] the criticism of the world he allows it
[42:02] where everybody is not going to receive
[42:04] you or like you sometimes your family
[42:07] many times you try to make a decision to
[42:10] serve the Lord or go forward with the
[42:12] Lord many times your family will resist
[42:16] against you how many you know what I'm
[42:17] talking about how many you ever
[42:19] experienced that you come out of the
[42:21] world or you come out of what you used
[42:23] to do and many times your family will
[42:25] come again you because they're the
[42:28] closest to you but the Lord allows this
[42:31] and so as a Believer we must understand
[42:34] that these things are allowed by him and
[42:37] we got to be able to take a punch Saints
[42:41] you got to be able to take a slap in the
[42:44] face spiritually speaking and maybe even
[42:48] physically you got to be able to
[42:52] withstand the pressures of the day
[42:56] everything is not going to run smoothly
[42:59] and everything is not going to be done
[43:00] to your liking or to your taste and
[43:03] people will deliberately stick their
[43:05] foot out to trip you up and pull on you
[43:09] and snag you up and they will
[43:12] deliberately do that but you're a
[43:15] Believer you were bought by the price of
[43:18] the blood of our Lord Jesus and he
[43:22] believes that you can make it you will
[43:25] overcome the test and the storm how many
[43:29] can receive that encouragement tonight
[43:31] that no matter what comes or goes I'm
[43:34] going to stay with this word Lord help
[43:37] me to hold out there a song we used to
[43:39] sing Lord help me to hold out until my
[43:44] change is
[43:46] come my way may not be easy he did not
[43:50] say that it would be but if it gets dark
[43:53] I can't see my way told me to put my
[43:56] trust in
[43:57] thee that's why I'm saying
[44:00] Lord help me to hold out can y'all help
[44:05] me sing
[44:06] it no you can't help me sing that but
[44:10] Lord help me to hold out then it goes on
[44:12] I believe I can hold out I believe I can
[44:16] hold out I
[44:18] believe yes yes yes and sometimes we
[44:22] come on and sing it I would if somebody
[44:24] would help me that's why I stop because
[44:27] they don't should be looking at me
[44:30] praise the Lord all right Lord help me
[44:33] to hold out give me the strength I know
[44:36] it's in me you called me to hold out and
[44:40] um he does that but this is part of The
[44:42] Purge and this was what Israel went
[44:44] through and we see the success of
[44:46] Joshua's ministry here what brother vam
[44:48] says in the message hear ye him
[44:51] paragraph 8 God always in his great
[44:53] feeling towards people he meets in the
[44:56] counsil of man God only works through
[44:59] his church the church is God's agency he
[45:03] said one place in the gospel I'm the
[45:05] vine you are the branches the vine does
[45:08] not uh bear fruit it purges the branch
[45:12] and the branch bears fruit so the church
[45:15] is the branch that the holy spirit is
[45:17] working through he speaks through the
[45:20] pastor's lips he works through his hands
[45:23] and through Divine gifts he sets his
[45:26] body in into emotions led by the Holy
[45:30] Spirit by emptying himself out and
[45:32] letting the Holy Spirit take control he
[45:35] brings messages he sees visions and
[45:38] great things no matter what it might be
[45:40] that God has chosen him to do if he will
[45:44] yield to the spirit God will work
[45:47] through him or any member of his
[45:51] church Prophet continues in Jesus Christ
[45:53] the same yesterday today and forever and
[45:55] says this now listen to strengthen that
[45:58] for you he said I am the vine you are
[46:01] the branches now the vine does not bear
[46:04] fruit the vine only purges the branch
[46:07] and the branch bears fruit therefore the
[46:11] only way Jesus could speak tonight would
[46:13] be through my lips or your lips my hands
[46:17] or your hands my life or your life I am
[46:22] the vine you are the branches sir he
[46:24] doesn't bear fruit anymore he he just
[46:27] purges his church and it bears
[46:32] fruit persecution doesn't weaken a
[46:35] Believer persecution actually
[46:37] strengthens a Believer persecution
[46:40] always strengthens the church the
[46:43] prophet of God said now what kind of
[46:45] fruit would we be if the life that was
[46:48] in him is in his church it'll bear the
[46:50] same kind of a life amen amen amen amen
[46:56] Prophet continues in the message
[46:58] Fellowship speaking of job he says job
[47:02] righteous man a Godly Man everything
[47:04] against him one day Satan took a notion
[47:07] to make him deny God and when he did I
[47:10] love to read job many people say it's a
[47:13] riddle it isn't it's the word of God
[47:16] Jesus referred to job about how have you
[47:18] not heard the patience no matter what
[47:20] was going on how much he was persecuted
[47:24] how much he was called that he was in
[47:26] the wrong path
[47:27] job stayed pat on the word I like that
[47:31] he said pre- Adventure my children have
[47:33] sinned I'll offer a sacrifice for them
[47:37] now the only thing that man knew that
[47:39] man knew was the burnt offering that was
[47:41] God's requirement and many people think
[47:44] sometime because disaster happens to a
[47:47] Christian oh he got off the will of God
[47:50] they left the church they went out
[47:52] sometimes that's not right because God
[47:55] chastens every every son that comes to
[47:58] him he cleanses him and purges him and
[48:02] tries to see if he will stand that's
[48:06] what he's doing that's what he was doing
[48:09] in the time of job amen so we see the
[48:14] Lord purchased his church he did it with
[48:17] job he does it with the believer today
[48:21] now that's the true seed it's been
[48:24] planted now it's growing and now it has
[48:28] to be purged now the prophet goes deeper
[48:32] in this purging process and the
[48:35] correction process you know it's good to
[48:38] know where you stand with the Lord at
[48:40] all times and it's I know that many of
[48:43] us all of us would love to live a life
[48:46] where we would make never make a mistake
[48:48] ever ever ever again but that's just
[48:51] simply not going to take place it's we
[48:54] all make mistakes is that right and we
[48:57] do things that's wrong if you just look
[48:59] around in the building you're looking at
[49:02] a bunch of flawed people from the pulpit
[49:05] all the way through every one of us have
[49:09] errors faults failures little things
[49:14] that are
[49:15] undesirable and if we'll be real honest
[49:18] you yourself don't like those things
[49:21] more than anybody else that's right if
[49:23] you examine yourself very clearly
[49:25] there's things about about you that you
[49:27] simply just don't like and you're asking
[49:30] the Lord to help you this is what keeps
[49:33] us on our knees Saints this is what
[49:36] keeps us before his throne of grace and
[49:39] mercy what would happen if the blood
[49:42] ever moved off the throne what if the
[49:44] Lord held us accountable for every
[49:47] mistake we've ever made what if he held
[49:50] it against us I'm so glad that he paid
[49:54] the price that I can come under the
[49:57] blood tonight and say Lord forgive me
[49:59] for my sins take it away Lord forgive me
[50:03] Lord and try me one more time sir give
[50:06] me another chance to make it right teach
[50:09] me how to walk straight teach me how to
[50:11] not slip or slide but strengthen me Lord
[50:16] forgive me and try me one more time and
[50:18] so this constant correction this
[50:22] constant you know coming before the Lord
[50:24] and asking him to forgive give us is
[50:27] just the way of a Christian Life That's
[50:30] What believers do we're very very
[50:33] conscious of the things that we do now
[50:36] if you don't care you just don't care
[50:39] but true believers really care that's
[50:41] right when it's written in the word or
[50:43] it's spoken in the word a True Believer
[50:46] really takes that to heart many times
[50:49] True Believers will run to the altar
[50:52] when really some of the some people that
[50:54] really should be at the altar they'll
[50:56] sit in their seats that's right and but
[50:58] it's easy to catch and convict a True
[51:00] Believer because he really wants to be
[51:03] right he almost thinks I mean you think
[51:05] you're you're like you're like Lord
[51:07] you're just going to forget about me you
[51:09] feel like you just you know you just
[51:11] failed him for the final time the last
[51:14] time but he loves us tonight his great
[51:18] love towards
[51:20] us
[51:21] amen I'm so glad that he loves me and he
[51:25] loves you
[51:27] amen and so it's part of it the
[51:30] correction is part of it it's this
[51:33] gentle hand of Love towards us as he's
[51:36] correcting us Prophet tells us Jesus
[51:38] Christ the same yesterday today and
[51:39] forever and says this here paragraph
[51:44] 8 uh paragraph 7even friend someone said
[51:47] to me brother Brandon brother Roberts
[51:49] pray for 500 people while you're praying
[51:51] for one that's right but brother Roberts
[51:54] is doing what God told him to do
[51:57] and I'm doing what God told me to do see
[52:00] we just have to see we're both working
[52:03] for God but look if a person has got
[52:07] unconfessed sin something in their heart
[52:10] you could pray for them all night long
[52:12] that'll never do no good that de demon
[52:15] will hold right there or if that person
[52:19] was supposed to do something that it
[52:22] didn't do it and God put that disease on
[52:25] them to bring them to reconciliation or
[52:28] to correction you just can't do it
[52:31] that's all and then what if he did do it
[52:35] and God gave the man the authority to
[52:37] take that sickness off there and would
[52:39] take it off when God put it on them for
[52:43] a purpose or God didn't put it on them
[52:47] he let the devil do it God doesn't make
[52:50] people sick sometimes he permits the
[52:53] devil to do it but God couldn't do it
[52:56] himself cuz he his Mercy he's Mercy
[53:00] can't be mercy and death he's life or
[53:03] death one he's life through Satan comes
[53:07] death and so here we see that sometimes
[53:11] the things that happen to us the devil
[53:14] is causing it to happen to us but it's
[53:16] the Lord allowing it to happen for a
[53:20] purpose not just to see you squeal and
[53:23] sream and get upset and temper T but
[53:28] he's doing it for a purpose and what is
[53:31] the purpose that these people are lying
[53:34] on me why are these people that don't
[53:36] like me on my job what is this going on
[53:39] in my neighborhood what is the
[53:42] purpose for whatever I'm going through
[53:45] that should be our prayer God has a
[53:50] purpose if you're a True Believer he's
[53:53] not wasting time on any tests or trials
[53:55] there's no extra test that he's just
[53:57] going to throw in there for no reason
[53:59] they're for a purpose and everything
[54:01] you're going through right now is for a
[54:03] purpose even the questions in your mind
[54:06] the questions of what your future is and
[54:10] what am I supposed to be doing I believe
[54:13] every one of us here have those
[54:15] questions some area of I have them Lord
[54:18] what should I do what does that look
[54:20] like in the future what does that hold
[54:23] and we're constantly trying to find what
[54:25] we call the perfect will of
[54:27] God and the enemy has come and he he's
[54:32] allowed to to cause us these little
[54:34] stresses these little
[54:37] annoyances but God allows it and it
[54:40] would be a tragedy if we go through all
[54:43] of that and we never get the purpose of
[54:45] what's really going on now we can make a
[54:48] long list of how dirty they did to us
[54:52] and what they did and them over there
[54:55] and they over there but what what about
[54:57] you what did it do for you did it
[55:00] develop a prayer life in you did you
[55:04] come to church more did you come
[55:06] less did you praise the Lord
[55:09] more if you got the same look on your
[55:11] face I don't know if that maybe you need
[55:13] to go through it
[55:15] again that test should have wiped that
[55:18] smirk off of your face or that frown or
[55:20] that growl or that grunt or
[55:22] that come on somebody m
[55:26] yes yes it's a purpose there's a purpose
[55:30] so the Lord purges us and he prunes us
[55:35] you have to do that to a tree to
[55:37] encourage growth to do that to a plant
[55:41] sometimes it's got to happen the purging
[55:44] and it happens to the individuals it
[55:46] happens to
[55:47] groups Lord Purge
[55:50] me Lord take out all the impurities out
[55:54] of my faith Lord Lord take the
[55:57] nearsightedness and let me see clearly
[56:00] what's really going on in my life stop
[56:03] letting me find an excuse on how to you
[56:07] know this group or these people and them
[56:10] let me take that out of my prayer and
[56:12] really focus on and put the spiritual
[56:15] glasses on and see clearly what the
[56:18] purpose is because God clearly has a
[56:22] purpose for our life amen
[56:26] the prophet says we realize in the
[56:28] message Supernatural we realize that
[56:30] this is like an experience of the
[56:33] Christian sometimes we have to go
[56:35] through terrible
[56:37] chastisement chastening of the Lord many
[56:41] things to correct us that will be fruit
[56:44] bearing
[56:46] Christians sometimes has to prune us or
[56:49] cut off take away take out of our hands
[56:52] we think sometimes oh God what are you
[56:54] doing to us but he knows what he's doing
[56:57] amen so we pray father that today that
[57:00] you'll prune every one of us from the
[57:04] leadest to least to the greatest the
[57:08] pastor God we pray that you'll prune
[57:10] every one of us take away all that's
[57:14] unlike you father take away the thing
[57:16] that's hindering us from being fruit
[57:20] bearing
[57:22] Christians the days are coming when it's
[57:24] going to get dark then want to go into
[57:27] the Sheepfold we want to be sheep today
[57:29] Father we want to follow exactly in the
[57:32] footsteps of the shepherd He gave us us
[57:35] an example he said I come not to do my
[57:38] will but the will of him that sent me
[57:41] may that be our motive today God to do
[57:44] the will of God who has saved us praise
[57:48] the Lord praise the Lord God is a good
[57:53] husbandman he says in the message the
[57:55] rest restoration of the brid tree yes
[57:57] paragraph
[57:59] 42 God is the good husband Men He pruned
[58:02] the tree that was all cut off all the
[58:05] dead limbs what's he going to do burn

[59:08] first all glory in the evening light the
[59:12] top of the tree amen not down at the
[59:15] bottom branches but up there in the top
[59:17] of the tree is where the fruit ripens at
[59:20] amen do you love him amen will you serve
[59:23] him amen do you believe him amen I sure
[59:26] do believe him with all my heart now
[59:29] what is it he's going to prune off them
[59:32] old dead Vines as she comes up all those
[59:37] organization Vines till she gets right
[59:39] up into the top of the tree there is
[59:42] where he's going to get his fruit now
[59:46] how many of us want to be
[59:49] pruned oh my how many of us need to be
[59:52] pruned yes we do we do
[59:56] in the third ex Exodus the prophet of
[59:58] God says this here paragraph
[1:00:01] 117 he says the organizations live L
[1:00:04] lusciously lived as a grafted Branch
[1:00:07] into the real Vine of Christianity but
[1:00:09] it's still bearing its original fruits
[1:00:12] women half-dressed men intellectual
[1:00:14] denying the power of the spirit but it's
[1:00:17] lived under the name of the Christian
[1:00:19] church it's a grafted Vine but the
[1:00:21] husbandman is coming by now to prune
[1:00:25] that Vine as he said he would do all
[1:00:29] those that don't have the fruit is cut
[1:00:31] off and thrown into the fire and
[1:00:35] consume is that probably what we've seen
[1:00:38] happen over the last 5 to 10 years these
[1:00:41] groups of people that are falling away
[1:00:43] in this pastor in this ministry and this
[1:00:46] group don't believe the word anymore and
[1:00:49] that group decides this is not important
[1:00:52] or those days of Miracles is pass or we
[1:00:54] don't believe in the gift and whatever
[1:00:57] is that part of what is taking place I
[1:01:00] don't know but it certainly looks like
[1:01:03] there has been a great
[1:01:05] Purge I don't even have all of the open
[1:01:09] doors of friends and pastors and
[1:01:11] ministri that I had like five years ago
[1:01:13] or 10 years ago things have changed
[1:01:16] people have
[1:01:18] changed um and your friendship will
[1:01:21] change and the people your fellowship
[1:01:23] will change as this great Purge happens
[1:01:28] and I say Lord Purge
[1:01:31] me Purge my faith so that my faith is
[1:01:36] pure 100% unadulterated faith not mixed
[1:01:41] with anything and that's what I want to
[1:01:43] be and I've we've leaned on our
[1:01:45] friendships we've leaned on because
[1:01:48] there's groups we've leaned on from one
[1:01:50] reason or the other and then the Lord
[1:01:52] allow that friendship to be challenged
[1:01:55] he'll allow that arm of Flesh to be
[1:01:58] challenged and to find out really do you
[1:02:01] really love me or do you really love to
[1:02:04] be popular all right you know he allows
[1:02:07] that and we've seen that I'm talking
[1:02:09] from my own experience I've seen that
[1:02:12] the Lord challenge allows those things
[1:02:14] to happen I I don't like it I don't like
[1:02:17] the way that feels I would love I'm not
[1:02:19] a fighter I love to just fellowship and
[1:02:21] be friends but things happen people make
[1:02:25] decision ISS that you have to stay with
[1:02:29] the
[1:02:30] word amen Believers amen Saints the
[1:02:34] world's going to change and the way they
[1:02:36] view religion is going to change and
[1:02:38] it's constantly changing they'll change
[1:02:41] the Constitution they'll change the laws
[1:02:43] they'll constantly change and even
[1:02:45] Believers will change how they view the
[1:02:48] word but I want to keep my eyesight
[1:02:51] right I want to see what God Said in his
[1:02:54] word amen and I don't want to compromise
[1:02:59] on his word not for a friend not for a
[1:03:02] foe not for
[1:03:03] popularity oh my God help us to be real
[1:03:08] solid Believers like Joshua like Caleb
[1:03:12] amen let's be a real seed that's planted
[1:03:18] in real soil now what is this soil this
[1:03:23] soil was predestinated
[1:03:26] Amen in works as Faith Express the
[1:03:29] prophet of God says this paragraph
[1:03:32] 130 any seed has to have its ground of
[1:03:37] course therefore all he forne see he
[1:03:40] already knew what was going to happen
[1:03:43] notice Jesus said again about the seed
[1:03:46] some fell on Rock others mixed ground
[1:03:49] see over where there's Thorns thistles
[1:03:51] and everything else it couldn't grow and
[1:03:54] others on good ground
[1:03:56] good ground good soil which had been
[1:04:00] preprepared already
[1:04:04] prepared now notice paragraph 152 notice
[1:04:07] now we find that Isaiah here spoke it
[1:04:09] the Virgin Mary the grounds was already
[1:04:13] broke up she had been a virgin she
[1:04:17] hadn't run around the grounds had been
[1:04:20] already prepared or
[1:04:23] predestinated by for knowledge of God
[1:04:27] even said she was a virgin right then
[1:04:29] God know what her name would be for her
[1:04:33] name was on The Book of Life in heaven
[1:04:36] then it was Vindicated man then to man
[1:04:40] saw the expression of it by the works
[1:04:43] when it was already done now we look
[1:04:45] back and say sure it was done because we
[1:04:48] see the works that was done and God's
[1:04:52] going to have a church in the last day
[1:04:54] there will be a
[1:04:56] that will rise in the last day amen and
[1:04:59] even when he said that there would be a
[1:05:01] bride for a Rapture he knew which names
[1:05:04] were on the Book of Life already he saw
[1:05:08] you yes sir he saw me amen prepared soil
[1:05:13] thank the Lord because the word is
[1:05:17] predestinated but he also predestinated
[1:05:20] my heart for the word to receive a
[1:05:24] beding ground for that seed to fall in
[1:05:27] in a pre prepared soil remember the
[1:05:31] Bible the truth the word has been
[1:05:33] broadcast to many different people
[1:05:36] groups all over they've heard it it
[1:05:38] falls they've heard it they'll start in
[1:05:41] a little bit and then they fall back
[1:05:43] they've heard it and then the world
[1:05:44] catches them but somehow some way you
[1:05:48] hear the word and then it settles in
[1:05:50] your
[1:05:51] heart then it begins to be bring about a
[1:05:54] change in you
[1:05:56] you oh you ought to be grateful and
[1:06:00] thankful for the predestinated seed the
[1:06:04] predestinated pre-prepared ground them
[1:06:08] two coming together and you'll find out
[1:06:10] that this word was actually made for
[1:06:13] you and you were made for it it's the
[1:06:17] only thing that made my life make any
[1:06:21] sense was the word of the Lord nothing
[1:06:24] else makes any sense to me and I've
[1:06:27] heard the arguments that I've ran after
[1:06:28] it I've tried it drink this run like
[1:06:31] this stand upside down do
[1:06:34] whatever and don't work for me take this
[1:06:38] vitamin read this book seven steps to a
[1:06:40] good life 12 steps to
[1:06:42] whatever join this group don't eat meat
[1:06:45] on Friday we're all
[1:06:48] white shave your head
[1:06:53] bald whatever the foolishness they do it
[1:06:56] but this word that I heard it fit me
[1:07:00] just
[1:07:01] exactly when I heard it I said
[1:07:04] yes where'd you get that from I asked
[1:07:07] the brother Fred where'd you get that
[1:07:09] from oh yes we got a message you got a
[1:07:12] prophet what's a prophet you showed me
[1:07:14] that picture right there see that light
[1:07:16] up there see that light up there I was
[1:07:18] like yeah I kind of see it he said
[1:07:20] that's the pillar of fire the first time
[1:07:23] I heard that I was like the pillar of
[1:07:24] fire yeah that's in the Bible and you
[1:07:27] start going deeper into it and you find
[1:07:29] out that this actually makes
[1:07:32] sense now I can't explain it like a
[1:07:35] college degree would explain it and I'm
[1:07:37] not an explainer like can break it down
[1:07:40] as a scientist could explain it but I'll
[1:07:42] just say it like this I know who my mama
[1:07:45] is and I know that this message is
[1:07:49] true it's been revealed to me that it is
[1:07:54] the truth
[1:07:56] and we'll give our life for it won't
[1:07:58] you there's no amount of money that can
[1:08:00] pay you to make you stop believing this
[1:08:03] word do you can you be bought no sir do
[1:08:06] you have a
[1:08:07] price no no no there is no amount of
[1:08:11] money well if you follow this word we're

[1:08:20] the Lord got other friends for
[1:08:22] me you follow this you take this stand
[1:08:25] you know you're going to be the odd man
[1:08:27] out you do this you're going to do that
[1:08:28] but you know what this is the only thing
[1:08:31] that fits because you know why I was
[1:08:34] predestinated to follow this message
[1:08:39] that's why I handle it the way I do
[1:08:41] that's why I preach it the way I do is
[1:08:43] because it is mine and I know it's mine
[1:08:46] all right
[1:08:49] amen somebody amen the prophet continues
[1:08:52] here my last quote here in the message
[1:08:54] works his faith is Express he says this
[1:08:57] here in paragraph number 160 now what if
[1:08:59] Moses would have said sir just a moment
[1:09:02] I thought I was talking to an
[1:09:03] intelligent being this great I am that
[1:09:06] you say you are now how in the world
[1:09:08] will I ever take this little old Crooked
[1:09:11] Stick I got here in my hand and take
[1:09:13] over an army of a million of men armed
[1:09:17] with Spears Fighters I'm not a fighter
[1:09:21] I'm a Shepherd how can I ever do that
[1:09:24] there was no question
[1:09:26] why why the ground in his heart he was
[1:09:31] predes he was a predestinated person
[1:09:35] gifts and callings are without
[1:09:37] repentance God had told Abraham that he
[1:09:39] would do that and there was the ground
[1:09:43] prepared yes sir and Moses took this
[1:09:45] stick and went down there and took that
[1:09:47] Nation out of a Nation when he come with
[1:09:51] the stick in his hand and told Pharaoh
[1:09:53] let them go pharaoh seen in Moses The
[1:09:56] Works that he had faith in what he was
[1:09:59] going to do or trying to do he had faith
[1:10:01] in the promise of God that had made the
[1:10:05] promise he went down to take it over no
[1:10:07] other man would have done that and no
[1:10:10] other man could have done it he was
[1:10:12] ordained to do it God beforehand had
[1:10:15] told Abraham that that's just what would
[1:10:18] happen and when the time of the promise
[1:10:20] Drew nigh there was a little boy born
[1:10:23] and a fair child in the par parents
[1:10:25] amaran and jocked was not afraid of the
[1:10:28] king's commandment see there was
[1:10:31] something the grounds was already
[1:10:35] prepared oh God I hope I'm speaking to
[1:10:39] ground prepared
[1:10:42] tonight if the seed can fall in the
[1:10:45] right place and it's going to be some if
[1:10:48] it isn't it won't happen that's the same
[1:10:51] thing why you say brother bandam that
[1:10:52] kind of takes it away from us if it does
[1:10:55] it takes it away from Christianity too
[1:10:58] you can impersonate anything but if it
[1:11:00] really falls in the word of God falls in
[1:11:04] the right kind of a ground is going to
[1:11:07] bring forth its kind it's got to because
[1:11:12] it's a seed amen how many thank the Lord
[1:11:15] for that it's a good ground it's a seed
[1:11:19] and it's prepared soiled I was made you
[1:11:22] were you were made for such a time is
[1:11:26] this he prepared the soil he put our
[1:11:29] name in the Lamb's Book of Life before
[1:11:31] the foundation of the world the Bible
[1:11:34] says we were
[1:11:36] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:11:39] the world in order for him to be God he
[1:11:42] had to know who you were before you got
[1:11:45] here knew your station in life knew what
[1:11:49] age you would hear the word and knew
[1:11:51] that you really would care what the word
[1:11:54] of God God
[1:11:56] said and I'm so glad that he put
[1:12:00] something in me that cares about this
[1:12:04] word thank the
[1:12:06] Lord not what I ought to be not what I
[1:12:08] should be but I'm so glad I'm not what I
[1:12:12] used to be and I know I'm going
[1:12:14] somewhere tonight amen God bless you God
[1:12:18] bless you let us let us pray the
[1:12:20] musicians

[1:12:26] you portions of word Lord for our
[1:12:31] encouragement father that the word of
[1:12:34] the hour

[1:12:40] church is going in the different
[1:12:41] directions that they're going he said
[1:12:44] you watch the condition of the women
[1:12:47] it'll tell you the condition of the
[1:12:49] church Lord that's in your
[1:12:51] word watch the attitude of men and see
[1:12:55] the
[1:12:57] weakness see of the hour you see the the
[1:13:00] the evilness the worldliness the cares
[1:13:02] of the
[1:13:03] world you see the lack of depth that
[1:13:08] many they don't go deep into the
[1:13:10] word you told the prophet Joshua to
[1:13:13] meditate day and
[1:13:16] night that's that's morning and
[1:13:19] nighttime that's not just one time
[1:13:22] hearing or listening it's meditating in
[1:13:26] day and night and you would make his way

[1:13:33] success to stay with the laws the word
[1:13:36] of Moses Lord that's our desire tonight

[1:14:37] criticism it can handle to be
[1:14:40] ridiculed oh it can handle the cares and
[1:14:44] the
[1:14:46] elements because it's in good
[1:14:49] ground and and and we go through things

[1:15:01] and the seed is taking root in the soil
[1:15:05] and there Lord now we can produce
[1:15:08] 100-fold 60 fold 50 fold we begin to
[1:15:13] produce from a Christian life not just a
[1:15:17] taker or just setting back we're
[1:15:20] actually
[1:15:22] producing from a Christian Life
[1:15:25] producing the word of God in our life oh

[1:15:32] testimony
[1:15:33] tonight Lord we're true Christians here
