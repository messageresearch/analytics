[25:19] [Music]
[25:21] None but thee,
[25:24] dear Lord, none but let's take the last
[25:29] verse there.
[25:32] And when
[25:34] my people life is home
[25:40] [Music]
[25:42] and time
[25:44] for me
[25:46] will be no more.
[25:49] [Music]
[25:53] Guide

[27:14] ask if Sister Melissa Bowman with her
[27:18] special
[27:41] [Music]
[27:50] All want their lives
[27:55] to count for something
[28:00] to leave their mark
[28:05] when
[28:06] [Music]
[28:10] vain pursuit.
[28:14] will come to nothing.
[28:19] Time will erase
[28:23] whatever we do.
[28:28] I want my life
[28:33] to count for Jesus
[28:37] for earthly things
[28:42] will quickly fade.
[28:46] No need to add
[28:51] to worldly riches.
[28:56] I only seek
[29:01] eternal gain.
[29:05] Inside my heart
[29:10] there burned a question.
[29:14] What was I placed
[29:19] on earth here for?
[29:24] It truly was
[29:28] to build a kingdom
[29:33] not of my own
[29:37] but of the Lord.
[29:42] I want my life
[29:46] to count for Jesus.
[29:51] For earthly things
[29:55] will quickly fade.
[29:59] [Music]
[30:00] No need to add
[30:04] to worldly riches.

[32:04] in
[32:06] his presence on holy
[32:10] ground.
[32:27] [Music]
[32:35] When I'm down and I'm out.
[32:39] [Music]
[32:41] When I think I've lost my way, well, I
[32:45] know what I'll say.
[32:53] When I'm feeling the pain,
[32:59] when I can't see a thing,
[33:02] well, I know what I'll say.
[33:08] Surely

[33:40] insecurities,
[33:42] I fix my eyes on Jesus and find
[33:52] your peace of
[33:55] your peace of mind.
[33:58] [Music]
[34:08] When I'm on the mountain top,
[34:14] when my flesh wants the fame, well, I
[34:17] know what I'll say.
[34:20] [Music]
[34:26] Surely my lips will surely my lips will

[36:21] to which I've never
[36:29] been
[36:30] before.

[38:43] a few
[38:49] more days
[38:51] to labor.

[43:18] [Music]
[43:20] and say
[43:22] a rich
[43:25] like me.
[43:28] [Music]
[43:31] I once
[43:34] was lost,
[43:37] but now
[43:40] I'm found.
[43:43] I was blind,
[43:46] but now
[43:49] I see.
[43:52] Amen. God bless you. God bless you,
[43:54] brother Ben. God bless you.
[44:09] God bless you all
[44:12] tonight. I just felt in my heart to
[44:16] to give my testimony how the Lord
[44:19] brought me to this message,
[44:22] what he did for me. I had a supernatural
[44:25] experience
[44:27] that I kind of wanna
[44:29] tell it to you guys.
[44:32] Can Can you uh sister, can you put that
[44:34] uh scripture in John 4:19?
[44:43] We love him because he first loved us.
[44:48] Okay. And sister, can you put that uh
[44:51] that quote the infallibility God's
[44:54] spoken word.
[45:15] Okay. And just the same promise that
[45:18] laid anchored in Jacob lays anchored in
[45:21] every born again believer. God calls
[45:25] sovereignly without anything you done
[45:27] about it. There's nothing you done. Men
[45:30] say, "I sought God." No man has sought
[45:32] God at any time. But it's God seeking
[45:35] man. Not man seeking God. God seeking
[45:40] man. Jesus said, "No man can come to me
[45:43] except my father draws him first."
[45:45] You get it? It has to be God drawing
[45:48] man.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Man in his nature is a castway. He's an
[45:53] alien. He's away from God. Then God by
[45:56] his grace has to draw him to his own
[45:59] side. And all the father's given me will
[46:02] come to me. No way at all. There ain't
[46:06] enough picture shows, enough dance
[46:08] halls, enough burl shows. I guess that's
[46:13] kind of like trips strip TV shows in the
[46:16] country to keep you away from God. When
[46:18] God goes to draw on back yonder before
[46:21] the foundation of the world when he put
[46:23] your name down that that you come you're
[46:27] going to come coming. That's all. That's
[46:29] all.
[46:33] Okay, that's it.
[46:36] So, um I want to start by uh when I was
[46:40] 12 years old,
[46:42] uh my cousin Jerry Samurano,
[46:46] he started the first Spanish message
[46:48] church here in Tucson. And he was uh
[46:52] backed up or sponsored by Perry Green.
[46:56] And so he he went to my mom's house and
[46:59] and told my mom and dad that u he was
[47:02] starting a church. She told him that
[47:03] there was a prophet to come on the land
[47:05] and and uh so uh my mom said, "Yeah,
[47:10] we're we're going." Uh and uh he she
[47:13] started taking us to to that church
[47:16] and it wasn't voluntary. She took us by
[47:19] force.
[47:22] She uh it's funny because uh I was the
[47:25] oldest of the seven children and I was
[47:28] like 12 and and and she said, "Yeah,
[47:30] you're going." And I said, "I don't want
[47:31] to go." And then she she like came come
[47:35] with come swinging at me like can I hold
[47:37] her hands and and you know what she did?
[47:40] She uh she said okay. So she she uh she
[47:44] would run and throw herself like body
[47:47] slam me to to crush me down. And so I
[47:51] started going to church and
[47:55] so
[47:57] um
[47:59] yeah, I started going to church and
[48:00] actually the the Lord started dealing
[48:02] with me when I I remember like 12 years
[48:04] old a little bit because I don't know if
[48:07] there's some older people here that
[48:08] remember that at that time they were
[48:11] preaching that the world was going to
[48:13] end in 1977.
[48:16] And uh I got super scared and I'm over
[48:19] here in junior high and I'm saying
[48:22] how come I know all these things and
[48:24] these other kids,
[48:27] you know, I was like I just couldn't
[48:30] believe it. But anyway,
[48:32] the the church the Spanish church closed
[48:35] down and we stopped going we stopped
[48:37] going to church cuz and then so we kind
[48:40] of like my parents kind of stopped too
[48:41] and we kind of all backslid. So we just
[48:44] time went on and I come to be about 21
[48:49] 20 21
[48:51] and
[48:53] I got a a a mental depression like and I
[48:57] started getting some real bad anxiety
[49:00] attacks
[49:02] and I didn't know what was going on and
[49:04] like
[49:06] depression we never heard of depression
[49:08] and anxiety attacks I got it so bad that
[49:11] I would roll on the
[49:13] And my parents were real concerned. I
[49:15] said, "What's going on?" And I would I
[49:17] would lock myself in my room. I didn't
[49:18] want to come out and I didn't know what
[49:21] was going on. And and uh they told my
[49:24] parents, "You know what? I think
[49:25] somebody put a hex on them. Uh like a
[49:28] spell." So they took me to a witch
[49:30] doctor on the south side.
[49:33] And
[49:35] I remember he it was like a he looked
[49:39] like the devil and it was like a little
[49:41] dark room with a lot of candles and a
[49:44] and a saints and stuff and and he told
[49:49] me, "Yeah, a girl put a hex on you." I
[49:51] said, "Oh yeah, what's her name? I can't
[49:54] tell you." So she he just took my money.
[49:57] I got worse. I got worse.
[50:01] And uh so I got worse and uh my parents
[50:06] didn't know what to do with me and I
[50:07] because they were real scared. My dad
[50:09] was real concerned. He'd come and
[50:11] massage my neck every day. I remember
[50:13] and and uh they told me we we got to try
[50:17] to help you. And cuz I was getting
[50:19] suicidal, too. I was thinking I said I
[50:21] want to commit. I don't want to I was uh
[50:23] how can I say I couldn't hardly take it.
[50:26] And so
[50:29] my my parents um They took me to the
[50:32] psychiatric ward in the university
[50:34] hospital, the last floor up there. And I
[50:37] remember
[50:38] I was up in the last floor looking down.
[50:40] I said, "What am I doing here? I know
[50:42] I'm not crazy." And I would see like uh
[50:46] the other patients, they would they had
[50:48] like uh helmets on and straight jackets
[50:51] and they would run into the wall and
[50:52] then all the employees would come
[50:54] running in. is a I called my brother the
[50:58] next day and I told him they call him
[51:00] Chhatto. I said, "Ch, you better come
[51:02] get me out of here, man, because if I'm
[51:04] not crazy, I'm going to go crazy in
[51:05] here." So, they came and got me out. I
[51:08] didn't know what I was like at at rock
[51:11] bottom. And
[51:14] I remember my mom told me, "Hey," she
[51:17] said, "Why don't you call Mike Galves?"
[51:19] Brother Paul knows him. and he, you
[51:23] know, he was he had something he was
[51:25] going through something like you. And
[51:27] now he goes to church. He got married.
[51:29] He has a house. He's doing real good. So
[51:34] I called my goal. He's like seven years
[51:37] older than me. So I didn't He's my
[51:38] cousin. His mom is my His mom was my
[51:41] dad's sister. So But the Suranos weren't
[51:44] really close. So I didn't really even
[51:46] know him. So, I called him and I told
[51:48] him, you know, my situation and he said,
[51:51] "Uh,
[51:52] you know what, Ben, I'll be right over.
[51:54] Uh, go drink some coffee and then talk
[51:56] about it." So, he come over
[52:00] and he uh I told him what's going on and
[52:02] uh he said, "You know what, Ben? God's
[52:06] calling you."
[52:08] And and he said, "Why don't you start
[52:10] going to church with me?" I said, "Okay,
[52:12] I'll start going to church." church. So,
[52:14] I started going to church with Mike
[52:15] Galves and and then one time he invited
[52:17] me for dinner and then the pastor was
[52:19] there and they talked to me about
[52:20] baptism
[52:21] and uh I didn't even know they were
[52:23] going to baptize me the next service and
[52:25] they told me there's a young man here
[52:27] that wants to be baptized. So, I went up
[52:31] there and they baptized me in the name
[52:32] of the Lord Jesus Christ. And you know
[52:35] what? The next day everything was gone
[52:39] completely. Completely. I was like back
[52:42] to normal, but nothing really happened
[52:46] here. So,
[52:48] I hate to say this, but I I I went like
[52:52] two or three more months and then I took
[52:54] off. I went back to the what I was back
[52:56] to the world and I turned my back on
[52:58] God. He he he cleaned me up and uh he
[53:02] took me, you know, he took that mental
[53:04] depression from me and I turned my back
[53:06] and I went back out in the world
[53:10] and uh
[53:13] I'm going to drop this in real quick. Uh
[53:18] I had a friend named Tim. We used to
[53:20] work at a supply house and
[53:24] you know back in the day they didn't
[53:25] have direct deposit. It was all checks.
[53:27] you know, they give you a check, you got
[53:29] to go cash it. And he bank I banked at
[53:32] Valley Bank. He banked at First
[53:34] Interstate Bank. And uh this was shortly
[53:37] after I left. And so he and on Friday
[53:41] said he I'd go to Valley, he'd wait for
[53:43] me inside the bank, then come out, then
[53:45] I'd go he'd go to First Interst State, I
[53:47] wait for him. So we went for First
[53:49] Interstate Bank and there my wife was a
[53:51] bank teller. I didn't. So I saw her
[53:56] and I had to get out. I got I so
[53:59] condemned and ashamed and my my my buddy
[54:02] Tim says, "Hey, how come you left?" He
[54:04] says, "I saw a girl there where I used
[54:06] to go to church and I just didn't feel
[54:08] right." He'd say, "You're weird, man."
[54:11] So So just to drop that in. And then u
[54:16] um
[54:17] like three years later, I mean years
[54:19] went by. Three years later,
[54:23] the depression hit me again and the
[54:26] anxiety. And not only that,
[54:30] uh, I found out my back I had I needed
[54:33] back surgery because they I was having
[54:35] back problems and I went to orthopedic
[54:37] surgeon and they said you they they
[54:39] found one of my vertebraes was broken
[54:41] and a piece of fragment was floating in
[54:44] there. said, "If we don't go in there
[54:45] and take it out and fuse you, they could
[54:47] poke you and you could be paralyzed."
[54:51] So, it was like a double whammy, you
[54:53] know, like like I was in depression and
[54:56] I didn't know what I said, I can't go
[54:58] back to church. They won't even let me
[55:00] in. I I left. And I I was I didn't know
[55:03] what to do. I was like I was even really
[55:06] uh thinking about taking my life because
[55:08] I couldn't go through that again.
[55:11] So
[55:13] I I would pass through my cousin's
[55:15] house, Mike Alves. I'd pass through
[55:17] there and I'd see him outside doing
[55:18] stuff, but I couldn't stop. I was too
[55:20] ashamed. And I said, "He might not even
[55:22] he he might even talk to me. He probably
[55:23] tell me to get out of here or
[55:24] something." But finally, he was grilling
[55:27] one time and I stopped.
[55:29] And I told I told Brother Mike what what
[55:32] was happening with me and
[55:35] and uh let me uh can you put Hebrews? He
[55:40] Hebrews.
[55:44] See if I can read it from here. The the
[55:47] scripture in Hebrews
[55:58] Hebrews 6 4-6.
[56:02] For it is impossible for those who are
[56:04] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[56:07] heavenly gift and are made partakers of
[56:09] the L Holy Ghost to have tasted the good
[56:13] world of God and powers of the world to
[56:15] come for they should fall away and renew
[56:18] them again to repentance seeing they
[56:20] crucify themselves the son of God aresh
[56:22] and put them to an open shame. That
[56:25] scripture was killing me. I said I
[56:28] didn't have I don't have Look, brother
[56:29] Mike, look I don't have a chance. I'm
[56:31] done.
[56:33] God bless brother Mike. You know what he
[56:35] told me? He says, he says, "Brother
[56:37] Ben," he says, "You know, Satan can be
[56:40] interpreting that scripture to your
[56:42] mind. He knows the scripture better than
[56:44] you do. If you have a pull, why don't
[56:47] you go back to church?"
[56:49] So, he gave me a little hope there. So,
[56:51] I went back to church.
[56:53] They received me and and uh I had a back
[56:58] surgery and the church was praying for
[57:00] me. I had back surgery and that I ended
[57:03] up in a body cast from here to here for
[57:06] a whole year and I couldn't even tie my
[57:09] shoes. But now that I look back, it was
[57:12] God's plan. He had to put me on my back.
[57:16] And uh I remember, you know, I couldn't
[57:19] go nowhere. So I started reading the
[57:21] word of God. I started reading the
[57:22] messages. I read the seven seals and I
[57:25] understood them. I said, "I'm
[57:26] understanding this."
[57:29] And uh and then I remember one time on a
[57:32] service where we had a visiting
[57:35] minister. I don't know if anybody knows
[57:37] him, but his name was Ernie Banoa
[57:40] from Florida.
[57:42] And he preached on the
[57:45] the eagle in the in and the the eagle in
[57:48] the chicken yard. And uh I remember uh
[57:52] they made an altar call and I couldn't
[57:54] go to the altar. I was in a body cast.
[57:55] They had me in a corner of the church
[57:58] and uh but there something supernatural
[58:02] happened. I I uh I came to a place where
[58:05] I said I know I can't turn my back on
[58:07] him again.
[58:09] I got to go out I So I said Lord Jesus I
[58:12] said I said I can't lead myself. I said
[58:17] lead me. And when I said that, I saw the
[58:20] Lord Jesus Christ
[58:23] just like that.
[58:25] And he looked at me and uh he like uh
[58:29] looked at me and he like he felt real
[58:31] sorry for me, you know, like uh how can
[58:34] I say it? Real compassion. And I just I
[58:37] broke down. I think I cried for hours,
[58:39] but it changed me from the inside.
[58:42] And uh so that that that was just I
[58:47] don't know what it was if I envisioned
[58:49] or had a vision but whatever it was it
[58:52] changed me from the inside. Sister, can
[58:55] you put that audio please
[59:12] one night saw our Lord Jesus. I'm saying
[59:14] this with permission I believe from the
[59:17] Holy Spirit. The angel of the Lord that
[59:20] comes is not the Lord Jesus. It doesn't
[59:23] look like him in the same vision. For
[59:26] the vision, I saw the Lord Jesus that he
[59:28] was a little man. He wasn't. I've been
[59:30] out in the field praying for my dad. And
[59:34] I come back in and I went to the bed and
[59:37] that night I looked at him and I I said,
[59:40] "Oh, God, save him. My mother has
[59:44] already been saved and I'd baptized
[59:46] her." Then I thought, "Oh, my dad drank
[59:48] so." And I thought if I could just get
[59:50] him to accept the Lord Jesus. I went
[59:53] out, laid down a little old pallet out
[59:55] in the front room near the door. And
[59:58] something said to me, "Rise up." And I
[1:00:02] raised up, went walking, and went back
[1:00:03] into the field. Behind me, an old
[1:00:05] broomstage field. There standing not
[1:00:07] over 10 ft from me, stood a man, white
[1:00:10] garment on, little fella, had his arms
[1:00:12] folded like this, a beard kind of short,
[1:00:15] hair down to his shoulders, and he's
[1:00:16] looking sideways from me like that.
[1:00:19] peaceful looking figure. But I couldn't
[1:00:21] understand how his feet one just behind
[1:00:23] the other and the wind blowing, his robe
[1:00:25] moving, sage blowing. I thought, now
[1:00:27] wait a minute. I bit myself. I said, I'm
[1:00:30] not asleep. And I pulled down, pull a
[1:00:33] little piece of that sage off. You got
[1:00:34] it like a toothpick in it. I put it in
[1:00:36] my mouth. I looked back towards the
[1:00:38] house. I said, "No." I was in there
[1:00:40] praying for dad. Something said, "Come
[1:00:42] out here and here stands this man." I
[1:00:44] thought, "That looks like the Lord
[1:00:45] Jesus." I thought, "I wonder if it is."
[1:00:47] He's looking just exactly directly
[1:00:49] towards where our house sits now. So I
[1:00:52] moved around this way to see if I could
[1:00:53] see him. And I could see the side of his
[1:00:55] face like that. But he I had turned way
[1:00:58] around this way to see him. I said,
[1:01:01] ever moved him. I thought I believe I'll
[1:01:03] call him. I said, "Jesus." And when he
[1:01:06] did, he looked around like that. That's
[1:01:09] all I remember. He just reached out his
[1:01:10] arms. There's not an artist in the world
[1:01:13] could paint his picture. The characters
[1:01:15] of his face. The best I've ever seen was
[1:01:18] at Hoffman's head of Christ at 33. I've
[1:01:21] got it on all literature and everything
[1:01:23] I use. That's it because that looks just
[1:01:25] like it. And so then or pretty near as
[1:01:28] little close as it could be. He looked
[1:01:30] like a man if he'd speak the world would
[1:01:32] come to an end. And yet with so much
[1:01:34] love and kindness to you, I just pitched
[1:01:36] over in daylight. I found myself just at
[1:01:39] the break of day pajama shirt soaking
[1:01:42] wet with tears when I come to myself
[1:01:44] walking back to the broomstage field
[1:01:45] home.
[1:01:48] that h I I didn't hear that till years
[1:01:51] later when I heard I said, "Man, that
[1:01:53] happened to me." So, I just kind of
[1:01:56] wanted to relate that to you guys. And
[1:01:59] is my time up? Yeah. Okay. Okay.
[1:02:04] [Applause]
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; How many appreciate that?
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:16] So, um, Brother Will Alifont
[1:02:21] is right there. Yeah. Come, brother
[1:02:22] Will. He's been doing some work with
[1:02:24] the, uh, Indian brothers there on the
[1:02:29] San Carlos Indian Reservation there.
[1:02:32] And, um, the Lord has been using him
[1:02:35] with that and helping those saints out.
[1:02:38] And he's got a few things on his heart
[1:02:40] that he wants to share tonight. And so,
[1:02:42] let's have him come. Amen.
[1:02:45] Let the church say amen as he comes.
[1:02:47] Amen.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Is that that?
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; All right. That a boy. That's That's
[1:02:59] what I needed.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Dylan, good to see you. My
[1:03:07] goodness, what a what a privilege it is
[1:03:10] to just be here amongst you all. It just
[1:03:15] wow the grace of God. You know, we
[1:03:18] wonderful testimony, brother Ben. We
[1:03:21] just appreciate that so much. And just
[1:03:23] to see the hand of God and the grace of
[1:03:25] God in our lives. And I'll tell you,
[1:03:28] there's a lot of other places that this
[1:03:30] guy could be standing tonight.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; So, we're just so grateful. Um, we think
[1:03:35] of
[1:03:37] just the Po family and and just Levi and
[1:03:40] looking at Dylan here, a grown man. And,
[1:03:43] you know, I just remember all these guys
[1:03:45] as little kids and and all these things.
[1:03:48] There's so many things. I'd love to give
[1:03:50] my testimony sometime, but it would take
[1:03:52] more than the time we got tonight. Um,
[1:03:55] but just to see to see all that,
[1:03:58] brother, brother Chuck and sister
[1:04:00] Barbara and oh this uh,
[1:04:05] brother Nathaniel, appreciate you all
[1:04:07] the all the days back at North Side. You
[1:04:10] know, I remember
[1:04:12] I remember uh really coming through with
[1:04:15] the Lord and getting saved and and uh
[1:04:18] won't get into all that, but I I
[1:04:21] Jesus Christ really came into my heart
[1:04:23] and I just seen him in his word and and
[1:04:26] you know, there's a scripture in Romans
[1:04:28] where it says that his spirit bears
[1:04:30] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:04:32] sons of God. and and you know, I just
[1:04:34] really had an experience of Jesus Christ
[1:04:37] coming into my heart and just I seen the
[1:04:39] resurrection of Jesus Christ. I I was,
[1:04:42] you know, it was in me and it was
[1:04:44] witnessing his word and all these all
[1:04:46] these things are happening and I'm I'm
[1:04:48] just oh my and you know I go to church
[1:04:51] and we go to North Side there and I and
[1:04:54] I come in you know I'm at the church and
[1:04:56] I'm like oh my goodness you know they
[1:04:58] must not know
[1:05:00] that he's he's alive you know it's real
[1:05:03] you know and then I remember Sister Kay
[1:05:06] you know there and I I realize and I'm
[1:05:08] I'm seeing and he's witnessing himself
[1:05:10] in the songs. He's witnessing himself as
[1:05:12] we're singing these old songs and
[1:05:14] brother Joe is leading songs and I just,
[1:05:17] you know, I'm like, "Oh my goodness,
[1:05:19] Jesus is it's real. It's real." You
[1:05:21] know, it's raised from the dead and and
[1:05:23] I said, "Well, I don't think they know
[1:05:24] it." But then Sister K Barber says,
[1:05:27] "Amen." And I'm like, "Oh, you know,
[1:05:30] there's one. She knows. She knows." You
[1:05:32] know, and so, um, you know, all you all
[1:05:35] are so special to me. the places that
[1:05:37] we've been, you know, it's hard to
[1:05:39] express. You know, we've been in
[1:05:41] heavenly places together. We've been,
[1:05:43] you know, we might not be, you know, at
[1:05:45] each other's house all the time and have
[1:05:47] all things in common, you know, in in
[1:05:49] that way and those things, but there
[1:05:52] there's a love of God in in the heart of
[1:05:55] a heart of the true elected child of
[1:05:57] God. And there's there's a oneness with
[1:05:59] each other. when we can see Jesus Christ
[1:06:01] in one another, it brings, you know,
[1:06:04] blessed be the tithe that binds our
[1:06:07] hearts in Christian love. And so I
[1:06:09] always remember Sister Kay and then, you
[1:06:12] know, you go back, you go back, I'm in,
[1:06:14] you know, I'm just, wow, you know, I'm
[1:06:16] just in awe and, you know, days go by
[1:06:18] and I I realize that I need to get
[1:06:20] baptized. So I call Brother Muse and I
[1:06:22] say, "Brother, something's happened. You
[1:06:24] know, I need uh I I think I need to get
[1:06:27] baptized." and I'm expecting him to tell
[1:06:29] me, you know, about it and or when or
[1:06:31] anything. He's like, "Well, all right.
[1:06:32] When do you want to do it?" And I was
[1:06:33] just like, "What?" You know, and all
[1:06:35] that. But then by the by the time two
[1:06:37] weeks later, we scheduled it and I, you
[1:06:39] know, I had separated myself from
[1:06:41] everybody I was with and living with and
[1:06:44] everything. I had hid myself in the room
[1:06:46] in my mom's house. You know, you know, I
[1:06:48] guess it was seeking the Holy Ghost is
[1:06:50] what you would call it. Um but then you
[1:06:54] know the brother Brandham says when you
[1:06:56] receive the new birth when you receive
[1:06:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have a
[1:07:00] target on your back and every devil in
[1:07:03] hell has that you know so so then this
[1:07:06] pressure and this you know things start
[1:07:08] to war against me and it's like
[1:07:11] everything wanted to keep me from
[1:07:12] getting baptized but I wondered you know
[1:07:15] and those different trials and those
[1:07:16] times and we could go into those things
[1:07:18] and really break them down and just
[1:07:20] really get into of those things. But I
[1:07:23] remember I just wanted to say this
[1:07:24] thinking of you precious brothers and
[1:07:26] sisters that mean so much to me. I I
[1:07:30] couldn't get the victory and I was like,
[1:07:31] "Lord, what did I do?" Cuz you know how
[1:07:33] you just want to stay in that presence.
[1:07:35] You just want to stay there. And all I
[1:07:37] would do is just read my Bible. I was
[1:07:39] lock myself in that room and you know I
[1:07:42] and that's all I wanted to do. I'm just
[1:07:44] holding that book and he's just he's
[1:07:45] just feeding me the word of God and I'm
[1:07:47] just oh Lord is so great. Well, then it
[1:07:50] was like he left me and I was like, "Oh,
[1:07:53] oh my." You know what I mean? What
[1:07:54] happened? What happened? And I'm all
[1:07:55] tore up. I'm like, "Oh no, what did I
[1:07:57] do? What did I think? What you know
[1:07:59] what?" And I hadn't done nothing but,
[1:08:01] you know, sit in that room and read my
[1:08:03] Bible and listen to tapes. But I
[1:08:05] couldn't The presence of the Lord
[1:08:07] seemingly had left me. And I So I go to
[1:08:10] I go to church and brother Earl Williams
[1:08:12] is, you know, there he's greeting in the
[1:08:15] deal. And before I got to church, I just
[1:08:18] had the victory just come over me again
[1:08:20] and I'm like, "Oh, there we go. What is
[1:08:22] it?" You know, and so, you know, how you
[1:08:24] trace that back and you're like, "Well,
[1:08:25] what did I think? What did I do? What
[1:08:27] scripture? What, you know, what came
[1:08:28] across my mind? How do I get that? You
[1:08:30] know, how do I I want to reproduce
[1:08:32] that?" You know what I mean? And I
[1:08:34] walked into that deal and and you know I
[1:08:36] really actually and the Lord kind of
[1:08:39] kind of swooped me one time I guess you
[1:08:41] would say about this but I walked into
[1:08:43] the church and I'm just you know just
[1:08:47] dragging in there and you know I'm but
[1:08:50] the victories in my heart you know I
[1:08:52] mean I'm I'm all just all happy you know
[1:08:55] just praising God in my heart and but
[1:08:57] I'm just dragging my feet moping along
[1:08:59] there and brother Williams looks at me
[1:09:01] and he shakes my man. And he says, "How
[1:09:05] you doing?"
[1:09:09] And I said, "Well, I'm all right."
[1:09:12] And he says, "Oh, come on."
[1:09:16] And I was like, "No, I'm really good."
[1:09:17] And and I had realized right now, you
[1:09:19] know, and you know how the Lord will
[1:09:20] just kind of let you know some things. I
[1:09:23] I realized that it was his prayers that
[1:09:27] that that brought me that brought that
[1:09:29] back to me. And he knew it. You know
[1:09:32] what I mean? He knew it. And so then
[1:09:34] shortly after that, a brother came uh a
[1:09:38] brother came uh from I forget where he
[1:09:41] was from. Brother
[1:09:43] um oh man, I forget his name. He was a
[1:09:46] preacher there. Real simple brother. He
[1:09:49] came and uh the word that came across
[1:09:52] there was really really convicting about
[1:09:56] dragging along there like that when when
[1:09:59] you got the victory in your heart.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And he really
[1:10:02] preached and it was really, you know,
[1:10:04] really the word of God, you know, how it
[1:10:06] can come and be very corrective and it
[1:10:08] was very corrective for me. And and even
[1:10:11] uh brother Cedro and another brother
[1:10:13] Owen afterwards said, "Man, that was
[1:10:15] rough, huh?" Like they knew, you know
[1:10:17] what I mean? It was pretty clear that
[1:10:18] that that I got chopped down in there
[1:10:22] because he was like, you know, what are
[1:10:23] you going to win a rodeo and then go
[1:10:25] dragging around like, you know, and it's
[1:10:27] just different things that were real.
[1:10:28] But it was, you know, really the Lord.
[1:10:30] So So if I get a little too excited
[1:10:33] sometimes when we're worshiping God,
[1:10:35] just just know that it's it's on it's
[1:10:39] honest. I I got spanked one time, so I'm
[1:10:41] I make sure to try to praise the Lord a
[1:10:43] little bit, you know. Um maybe
[1:10:49] um
[1:10:50] maybe uh we'll just we'll just pray a
[1:10:52] little bit if we can. Heavenly Father,
[1:10:55] Lord, we love you so much. We're so
[1:10:57] grateful, Lord, for your grace in our
[1:10:59] lives. We're so Lord, unworthy of it,
[1:11:02] but Lord, you called us and Father,
[1:11:05] we're so thankful. What a privilege it
[1:11:07] is to to even be in this building, Lord.
[1:11:10] It's just by your grace and your your
[1:11:13] sovereign sovereign grace, Lord.
[1:11:15] Predestinated unmmerited grace. We're
[1:11:17] standing here today, Lord, just
[1:11:19] together. And
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, let us let us rise up into
[1:11:23] heavenly places, Father. Let us, Lord,
[1:11:26] lay aside every sin and every weight,
[1:11:28] Lord Jesus. And Lord, we're looking here
[1:11:31] at the end of the year, Lord, but really
[1:11:34] we're looking at the end of all time,
[1:11:36] Lord. We're really coming to to the time
[1:11:38] where there's a transition, Lord, from
[1:11:41] the Gentiles back to Israel. And oh God,
[1:11:44] what a time. What an hour, Lord. But
[1:11:47] you've called us for this, Lord. You've
[1:11:49] you've given us what we have need of in
[1:11:51] this hour, Lord. Help us to take full
[1:11:53] advantage of it, Lord. Forgive us all
[1:11:55] for all of our sins and shortcomings and
[1:11:58] ask that you would just take control of
[1:12:00] the rest of the service. We thank you
[1:12:02] for being here thus far in Jesus name.
[1:12:05] Amen.
[1:12:08] So, I just want to read a scripture.
[1:12:10] Romans
[1:12:12] 8:28.
[1:12:15] And we know
[1:12:17] that all things work together for good
[1:12:19] to them that love God, to them who are
[1:12:22] the called according to his purpose.
[1:12:27] For whom he did forno, he also did
[1:12:29] predestinate
[1:12:31] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:12:37] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:12:41] many brethren.
[1:12:46] Uh may the Lord just add
[1:12:49] blessing to the reading of his word.
[1:12:52] Sorry for not making you stand. I'm not
[1:12:54] used to to doing this too much. So,
[1:12:57] we'll just just pray for me if you will.
[1:13:00] So, I was thinking on on some things and
[1:13:04] and uh just want to just so grateful for
[1:13:07] the spirit of God and and so thankful
[1:13:09] for his
[1:13:11] to see to see, you know, brother
[1:13:14] brother, we we're seeing the Lord Jesus
[1:13:17] Christ work right in this church, right
[1:13:20] amongst this ministry, our pastor, and
[1:13:23] and the way that the Holy Ghost is
[1:13:24] leading him. And to see him come out the
[1:13:27] other Sunday and say, "You think we need
[1:13:29] a revival,
[1:13:31] you know, and then to see over these
[1:13:33] special meetings, I mean, s you know, do
[1:13:36] you remember the year before how great
[1:13:38] they were?" And I didn't think, you
[1:13:40] know, my that was so wonderful the year
[1:13:42] before that, you know, Zerubabel and
[1:13:45] just seeing these different things. I I
[1:13:46] wanted to get I didn't really have time
[1:13:48] to do it, but I wanted to just get some
[1:13:50] of those things, you know, that were
[1:13:52] brought forth and just kind of just
[1:13:54] really just go over them and read them.
[1:13:56] But, you know, it's it it's amazing to
[1:14:00] see the
[1:14:02] the Holy Ghost really come in and move,
[1:14:04] you know, and and I was thinking about
[1:14:06] because we were fellowshipping in some
[1:14:08] things that were, you know, pretty high,
[1:14:11] I guess, big, you know, the seals and
[1:14:13] these different revelations and these
[1:14:15] things. And I I started thinking for San
[1:14:17] Carlos and those things, you know,
[1:14:19] they're real simple and you know, all
[1:14:21] those things. And I just started
[1:14:22] thinking about how for different, you
[1:14:25] know, we're all might be at different
[1:14:27] spots in our walk with the Lord. And it
[1:14:29] was just so wonderful how the Lord came,
[1:14:32] you know, the last service here and and
[1:14:34] said it if you left him, you can find
[1:14:37] him where you left him. And so we know
[1:14:39] that where we leave him in the word of
[1:14:41] God, you know, we can find him. But to
[1:14:44] see, I wondered how to to get, you know,
[1:14:47] the congregation or get how do you get
[1:14:50] people from maybe, you know, this level
[1:14:53] of of of thinking or this portion of the
[1:14:56] word. How do you get them up here? And
[1:14:59] we realize that this is the work. This
[1:15:02] is what I realized or this is what the
[1:15:04] Lord showed me in those services. It's
[1:15:07] the Holy Ghost that does it. Of course,
[1:15:09] the Holy Ghost is the one that does
[1:15:11] everything. you know, that's the one
[1:15:13] we're trusting and it's not in men or
[1:15:15] ministries or any certain thing, but
[1:15:17] it's it's Christ. It's Jesus Christ, you
[1:15:20] know, and it wasn't the acts of the
[1:15:21] apostles. It was the acts of the Holy
[1:15:23] Ghost in the apostles, right? Brother
[1:15:25] Brandham said that. And to see that how
[1:15:28] that God came with with brother George
[1:15:31] and he set his whole level up here on
[1:15:33] this deal. And I just watched how the
[1:15:35] Holy Ghost just took that first part and
[1:15:38] then he brought what did he bring to us?
[1:15:40] that that Matthew 11 he said that that
[1:15:43] was they said you know we thought first
[1:15:45] Elijah must first come and he says well
[1:15:48] he's already come but you meant truly he
[1:15:50] must first come and restore all things
[1:15:52] right so so we see the Holy Ghost just
[1:15:55] bringing that message and and really
[1:15:57] bringing it to the scriptures and so
[1:16:00] that was the the you know the basis and
[1:16:03] the and the first thing and to watch God
[1:16:05] come through and just build to the end
[1:16:08] of those services. It was just really
[1:16:11] something to me and I, you know, I want
[1:16:13] to go back and watch him again and maybe
[1:16:15] I mean that would be a great thing maybe
[1:16:17] for all of us to do, but it was just
[1:16:19] amazing to see how that the Holy Ghost
[1:16:22] does that. He condescended so that we
[1:16:25] can ascend. And you know, he reached his
[1:16:27] hand way down and he just keeps doing
[1:16:29] it. He just keeps coming down. And and
[1:16:31] you know, we don't want to drag God down
[1:16:33] to where our level. You know, there's
[1:16:35] many times we wanna we want to do it our
[1:16:38] own way and we want to go around our own
[1:16:40] way. And and you know, I can see that in
[1:16:42] every mistake that I've ever made,
[1:16:45] everything in my life, it comes from
[1:16:47] leaving that word, leaving this message.
[1:16:50] You know, that that I can I can go back
[1:16:52] to find him. Every time I leave him,
[1:16:54] every time I stumble, every time I fall,
[1:16:57] it's because of that. it's because of
[1:16:59] some part that I couldn't go on with or
[1:17:02] that I failed to move or I moved too
[1:17:04] fast, you know. So, so that's just
[1:17:07] really amazing. I wanted to say how
[1:17:09] amazing it is and and and how grateful
[1:17:12] to God I am for
[1:17:14] for what he's doing here in this church
[1:17:16] and just seeing the the Holy Ghost move
[1:17:18] through the word. And that's really what
[1:17:20] we want to see. I I want to I'm running
[1:17:23] out of time pretty quick and I know I'm
[1:17:25] kind of scattery, but may the Lord put
[1:17:27] it all together for you. We pray that's
[1:17:30] what he does.
[1:17:32] Um there was this little thing here. You
[1:17:34] know, some people say the Bible or the
[1:17:37] end time message contradict itself, but
[1:17:41] it doesn't. The Bible says in the Ladyan
[1:17:44] age
[1:17:48] they are blind and naked and don't know
[1:17:49] it. The scripture
[1:17:52] blinds the eyes of some and opens the
[1:17:53] eyes of others. Jesus Christ, Elijah,
[1:17:56] and Moses blinded the eyes of some
[1:17:59] people whose eyes were wide open during
[1:18:01] their ministry. And so it is today. The
[1:18:04] prophet Isaiah
[1:18:06] said that they have eyes but can't see
[1:18:08] and ears but can't hear. And so
[1:18:13] I want to get back there's a there's a
[1:18:15] quote out of the church age book there.
[1:18:18] Um,
[1:18:20] but
[1:18:22] I wanted to
[1:18:25] I want to get back to that. Excuse me.
[1:18:30] Um,
[1:18:39] so we listen to here. We listen to
[1:18:42] believe from the heart. And I just the
[1:18:48] you know I really just like I say
[1:18:49] appreciate the the leadership of the
[1:18:51] Holy Ghost in this church and and it you
[1:18:53] know brother
[1:18:56] brother led to play this tape and it was
[1:18:58] just so anointed to me the whole tape
[1:19:00] but it was just really
[1:19:03] thinking about that last statement with
[1:19:05] this one. But have we?
[1:19:08] This is from belief from the heart
[1:19:10] paragraph 29.
[1:19:14] But we have just accepted the word on an
[1:19:18] intellectual basis and seen so many
[1:19:20] failures
[1:19:22] till it has brought the people to the
[1:19:24] place that they just hardly
[1:19:28] know what to believe. They just got a
[1:19:31] lot of loose ends to their religion.
[1:19:33] They run out on limbs this way. They run
[1:19:36] on out on limbs that way which comes to
[1:19:39] the end and here they come crawling
[1:19:42] back. Great moment, great movements
[1:19:45] start and they run out
[1:19:50] like like the Methodist, the Baptist,
[1:19:52] the Pentecostals and all this. We see
[1:19:54] this amongst the message
[1:19:57] and the first thing you know they get a
[1:19:59] little psychic idea and they run out to
[1:20:02] the limb and they're having a big time
[1:20:04] but the first thing you know they find
[1:20:07] themselves at the end.
[1:20:10] But the only thing that ever lasts is
[1:20:13] eternal things and eternal things are
[1:20:15] God.
[1:20:16] Now if you notice a man is known by his
[1:20:20] character is known by his works. If we
[1:20:23] could think of how God shows his
[1:20:24] character by his works,
[1:20:28] he's got his own character and he made
[1:20:31] his works. And if you look at his works,
[1:20:33] oh, how great they are.
[1:20:36] I really love that because I really seen
[1:20:39] God the first I really seen him in
[1:20:42] nature. I really see him in in in horses
[1:20:44] and nature. And we've got a lot of stuff
[1:20:46] we could say there and go that way. But
[1:20:50] let me challenge every scientist in the
[1:20:52] world to build me one tree. Let me
[1:20:55] challenge every scientist in the world
[1:20:57] to make me one little spring of grass
[1:20:59] and it's totally impossible.
[1:21:02] Well, it seems like then upon thinking
[1:21:04] those things that we could be
[1:21:07] that there could be a placing by reading
[1:21:10] the word a faith that would be go beyond
[1:21:13] the intellectual conceptions into the
[1:21:16] heart. Jesus said, "If thou shalt say in
[1:21:20] thy heart." Now, we get all frustrated
[1:21:23] in our minds and we go out and say, "Oh,
[1:21:25] I seen that done." Yes.
[1:21:28] And once in a while it just hop and skip
[1:21:31] and so forth, but it seems like it just
[1:21:33] can't get moving right. And here we go.
[1:21:37] Is because we try to mix the
[1:21:39] intellectual with the supernatural.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; They have no dealings with each other at
[1:21:45] all.
[1:21:47] Intellectuals will say one thing and
[1:21:49] supernatural will say another. And any
[1:21:52] man that's ever led by the spirit of God
[1:21:54] does not take any thought of any
[1:21:56] intellectual, but he's led from his
[1:21:58] heart by the spirit of God. He is
[1:22:01] misunderstood. People say, "Oh, how can
[1:22:03] it be?"
[1:22:05] And so that that's why we see, you know,
[1:22:08] that that people are blind and that and
[1:22:11] that it's a great time of of choosing a
[1:22:15] great time and and we're all it's all
[1:22:17] set before us to choose what what way we
[1:22:20] we would want to take it. You know, are
[1:22:22] we going to take an intellectual
[1:22:23] conception of the word even of the
[1:22:26] message or are we going to take the
[1:22:27] spirit's revelation of the message? Are
[1:22:29] we going to look to the Holy Ghost to
[1:22:31] see it? And this is what you know when
[1:22:34] when I first came into the church at
[1:22:36] North Side, I I had 10 tapes. It was
[1:22:41] what is the Holy Ghost given for in that
[1:22:43] series in 1960, the way back, the
[1:22:45] kinsman redeemer and those tapes and I
[1:22:48] and I've been to like three services and
[1:22:50] God came and the the only thing I could
[1:22:52] liken it to back in the gangster days
[1:22:55] was the ghetto bird had broke through
[1:22:56] the ceiling because the the spotlight
[1:22:58] was upon me. It was like that in an a
[1:23:02] literal light. Not not feelings, not
[1:23:04] emotions, not a guilty conscience, but a
[1:23:07] supernatural
[1:23:08] call. Not not, "Oh, brother, you're
[1:23:11] going to shout now. Oh, brother, we're
[1:23:12] going to lift you up now. Oh,
[1:23:14] sweetheart, come on." It was, "You are
[1:23:17] guilty." And the conviction of the Holy
[1:23:19] Ghost came on my life right there. and
[1:23:23] and and and I realized and and I had
[1:23:25] heard those tapes and and and I was the
[1:23:28] God was calling me forward to repentance
[1:23:30] and I thought I needed to go to the
[1:23:32] altar, but I didn't know what to do.
[1:23:33] There was no altar call made and then
[1:23:35] I'm in trouble and I am in trouble. God,
[1:23:38] the conviction of the Holy Ghost was on
[1:23:40] my life. And I I went along and I I'm
[1:23:43] playing the tapes and it's more
[1:23:44] conviction. I'm playing the tapes and
[1:23:46] it's more conviction. And I'm listening
[1:23:47] to what is the Holy Ghost? What is the
[1:23:49] Holy Ghost given for? And I'm thinking,
[1:23:51] what if this is possible? What if this
[1:23:53] is real? What if God can come into my
[1:23:55] heart? What if what if God can come
[1:23:58] down? What if what if Jesus Christ, the
[1:24:00] Holy Ghost can come down and burn all
[1:24:01] this stuff from the inside out? And on
[1:24:04] that tape, he says, "Now, when you come
[1:24:06] to receive the Holy Ghost, when God
[1:24:08] calls you to come up here, he says, you
[1:24:10] come and you really mean business with
[1:24:12] God. And if you have to stay until
[1:24:14] Christmas, then you stay until
[1:24:16] Christmas." And so, the conviction of
[1:24:19] God is upon me. and I go and I wanted to
[1:24:21] come to the altar because I felt to go
[1:24:23] forward. It was calling me out, you
[1:24:25] know, not because because brother Mchuse
[1:24:27] didn't believe in altar calls. He didn't
[1:24:29] make them. It was a Methodist tradition
[1:24:31] and that's a quote and there's nothing
[1:24:32] wrong with that. God should do the
[1:24:34] calling, but God was calling. I didn't
[1:24:36] know what to do. So, I'm crying and I'm,
[1:24:38] you know, oh Lord, I'm not raising my
[1:24:40] hands, that's for sure. Wanted to hide
[1:24:42] under the seat, but I'm I'm crying just
[1:24:45] weeping before the Lord. Please, Lord,
[1:24:46] help me. Please, no.
[1:24:48] please forgive me, you know, because the
[1:24:50] conviction is upon me. And I go to pray
[1:24:53] at the altar and I'm going to pray until
[1:24:55] Christmas and it was January and and and
[1:24:59] I'm going to stay there and those old
[1:25:00] brothers, brother Mchuse, brother Pitts
[1:25:03] and and those brothers that that they're
[1:25:05] there and they're down there and that
[1:25:06] precious sister Amber Olsen now, you
[1:25:09] know, she stayed on that organ and we
[1:25:11] stayed down there and those old men,
[1:25:12] those old saints of God prayed with me
[1:25:15] and I thought I had to confess
[1:25:16] everything I'd ever done and I'd lived
[1:25:18] 28, 29 years of the, you know,
[1:25:21] party crowd. I'll just say that. But I
[1:25:24] mean I if I get into those details, it's
[1:25:26] bad. So I'm confessing everything and I
[1:25:30] think brother Mchugh's got up and walked
[1:25:32] away a few times just because of what I
[1:25:33] was saying probably. But you know that
[1:25:36] but they're faithful. They're praying
[1:25:38] there and you know three or four hours
[1:25:40] go by. It was a long time, you know, and
[1:25:42] they're praying and brother Pitt says to
[1:25:43] me, he says, "Will," you know, and I,
[1:25:45] you know, we're about cried out, you
[1:25:47] know, about all I could cry and all I
[1:25:48] could confess and all those things. And
[1:25:51] and
[1:25:53] Brother Pit says to me, "Will," he said,
[1:25:54] "he wouldn't have called you if he
[1:25:56] didn't love you." And I said, "Well,
[1:25:58] that makes sense." And he says, "Yeah."
[1:26:00] He said, "Uh, will you just accept him
[1:26:02] as your savior?" And I said, "Yeah,
[1:26:05] yeah, I I'll, you know, I'll do that."
[1:26:06] And so we walked out and my sweet
[1:26:08] precious aunt Wanda. She was still
[1:26:10] standing out there that I just and she's
[1:26:14] been a she's been such what a saint of
[1:26:16] God. And talk about lead of the Holy
[1:26:18] Ghost. She just sends me these quotes
[1:26:20] just right on time all the time. She's
[1:26:22] my fellowship buddy. Uh it's my secret.
[1:26:25] It's my it's my ace in my pocket there.
[1:26:27] I shouldn't be saying this telling you
[1:26:28] guys what what my secret is. But but you
[1:26:32] know that wasn't enough.
[1:26:34] it wasn't enough just to believe because
[1:26:37] I'd heard what he said on the tape and
[1:26:41] I'm looking for that and and he said
[1:26:43] that I said how you know I got to and I
[1:26:45] went and I separated myself from where I
[1:26:47] was living from the people and I I said
[1:26:50] I don't know what's happening I can't
[1:26:51] stay here um I've got to I've got to go
[1:26:57] um
[1:26:59] and I you know I took my stuff and I
[1:27:01] said I don't know about the future but I
[1:27:02] know that I can't stay here. And so I
[1:27:04] went to that room that I hadn't lived
[1:27:06] there that my mom kept for me. You know,
[1:27:08] I went to that room
[1:27:11] um that I hadn't been hadn't lived there
[1:27:13] since I was 15 or 16 years old and uh 28
[1:27:17] or 29 years old. And um
[1:27:21] how can how could I say that I believe
[1:27:24] when it when when the when the faith
[1:27:26] that is clearly put forth to us says
[1:27:29] that these signs shall follow every
[1:27:31] believer? And so I'm I'm in this bind
[1:27:35] and every time I write try to open this
[1:27:37] book,
[1:27:39] it's a mystery.
[1:27:42] And so how how can I just say that when
[1:27:47] when I can't say that I believe you,
[1:27:49] Lord, because I don't have this? You
[1:27:51] see, it put me in a bind. And and see,
[1:27:54] that's the word of God puts us in a bind
[1:27:56] sometimes, you know, and and uh I'm past
[1:28:00] time already. I'm going to try to try to
[1:28:02] wrap this up. I got a little scattered.
[1:28:05] Sorry. But, you know, the word of God
[1:28:08] puts you in a bind sometimes. And I see
[1:28:10] this really with horses and and and
[1:28:12] getting into how how we train horses at
[1:28:14] first. When we catch those horses, they
[1:28:17] are scared for their lives. You know,
[1:28:20] and the one thing that a horse has, it's
[1:28:22] self-preservation.
[1:28:23] If a horse bucks or he bites you or
[1:28:25] anything, horses aren't mean animals.
[1:28:27] They're doing it to save their life.
[1:28:30] they're doing it. It's it's
[1:28:32] self-preservation. And so we work with
[1:28:34] that.
[1:28:36] And you know, there there's there's a
[1:28:38] pressure that you put on horses. And and
[1:28:41] as you get them along, when you first
[1:28:42] get them in there, you just put pressure
[1:28:44] and get one direction around there. You
[1:28:47] first confine them, then you can put
[1:28:49] pressure and get them to go the other
[1:28:50] direction. And then once you start to
[1:28:52] control their feet, their place, you can
[1:28:55] start to get to their mind. So position
[1:28:59] has something to do with that. But then
[1:29:01] as you get farther along in the top ends
[1:29:04] of really training really fancy raining
[1:29:06] horses and stuff like that, you'll put
[1:29:09] them in a bind like in between your
[1:29:10] hands and your legs and you'll given
[1:29:12] them them an opening and you you showed
[1:29:14] them this opening or presented this
[1:29:16] opening to them, but you'll you'll have
[1:29:18] pressure everywhere else so that they go
[1:29:20] through that door. They go through that
[1:29:23] opening. And the word of God puts us in
[1:29:25] a bind if we're really sincere. If we
[1:29:28] really approach it sincerely, then the
[1:29:31] it'll put us in a place where we have to
[1:29:34] look to God. We have to get to God. We
[1:29:38] can't rely on an intellectual conception
[1:29:40] anymore because we have to get to him.
[1:29:43] And there's a pull like brother Ben was
[1:29:45] testifying of. There's something pulling
[1:29:47] me. There's something there's a pull
[1:29:49] inside my heart that creeds and
[1:29:52] denominations and and I say that creeds
[1:29:54] and denominations but just church will
[1:29:58] not satisfy just just living a good life
[1:30:01] just you know coming in and you know a
[1:30:03] lot of times we've said I've got to stop
[1:30:05] but a lot of times we've said that you
[1:30:07] know our young people what they need is
[1:30:09] an experience what they need is the
[1:30:12] experience what brother Brandham said I
[1:30:15] don't care if my tie matches my trousers
[1:30:17] but I I want my experience to match
[1:30:20] God's word and and that's what we want
[1:30:22] to see in our lives. That's what that's
[1:30:24] what we want to see. Well, I'll just
[1:30:26] leave this this one little thing to you.
[1:30:28] I got just read this. Sorry, brother. It
[1:30:30] is real. All right. Sorry. Um
[1:30:36] as as we go on here, Brother Mcus, he
[1:30:38] had said one thing. You know, a lot of
[1:30:40] these things throughout the throughout
[1:30:42] the years have really have really stayed
[1:30:45] with us with me. certain things that
[1:30:48] that people have said and Lindsay laughs
[1:30:50] at me how much I forget and how
[1:30:52] scattered I am. But then I can remember
[1:30:54] something like this out that brother
[1:30:56] McHugh said this is what tw you know 18
[1:30:59] years ago or something but he was all
[1:31:01] excited about I think it was brother
[1:31:03] Luke Gibson or somebody like that had
[1:31:06] told had told him a quote or told him
[1:31:08] something and he said where the
[1:31:10] contradiction seems to be
[1:31:13] there's a revelation laying there and he
[1:31:16] was all excited about this and I hadn't
[1:31:18] even you know you know how brother
[1:31:19] Mchuse was it's not very excitable but
[1:31:22] he was all excited, you know, about
[1:31:24] this. He was, you know, like he was
[1:31:27] like, you know, he was all giddy like,
[1:31:29] yeah, it was really something. It stood
[1:31:32] out to me just just for that. But let me
[1:31:36] just read this. Do you, this is out of
[1:31:38] the exposition of the church ages, the
[1:31:41] Ladyan church age. Do you remember when
[1:31:43] Elijah and Gaza were surrounded by the
[1:31:46] army of the Syrians? You recall that
[1:31:49] Elijah smoked them blind by the power of
[1:31:51] God. Yet their eyes were wide open and
[1:31:53] they could see where they were going.
[1:31:57] The blindness was particular peculiar in
[1:32:02] in that they could see certain things,
[1:32:04] but other things such as Elijah the
[1:32:08] servant
[1:32:10] and the camp of Israel
[1:32:12] they could not see. What this army could
[1:32:15] not could see did not avail for them.
[1:32:19] what they did not see brought on their
[1:32:23] captivity.
[1:32:25] Could go on a long time on that. Now,
[1:32:28] what does this mean to us? It means
[1:32:31] exactly what it meant back there in the
[1:32:34] earthly ministry of Jesus. He tried to
[1:32:37] teach them truth, but they would not
[1:32:38] listen. John
[1:32:41] 9:40 to 41. And some of the Pharisees
[1:32:44] which were with him heard these words
[1:32:47] and said unto him, "Are we blind also?"
[1:32:49] Jesus said unto them, "If ye were blind,
[1:32:52] ye should have no sin. But now ye say,
[1:32:55] we see, therefore, your sin remainth."
[1:32:58] The attitude of this age is exactly what
[1:33:01] it was then.
[1:33:04] People have it all. They know it all.
[1:33:08] They cannot be taught.
[1:33:11] And we could go on with that. And we see
[1:33:12] that really in horsemanship and those
[1:33:14] things. You know, you we got pretty
[1:33:17] pretty high in that industry and work
[1:33:20] for some really good horse trainers and
[1:33:21] was assistant trainer at those places.
[1:33:23] But you always run into a lot of people
[1:33:25] around the horse world that it's almost
[1:33:27] a religious spirit. And I think it kind
[1:33:29] of is a little bit of a spirit that they
[1:33:31] worship the creation instead of the
[1:33:33] creator and those things. But you run
[1:33:34] into a lot of them that that'll go to a
[1:33:37] clinic or two or they they do whatever
[1:33:39] and and they just like, man, this is the
[1:33:42] way my dad showed me how to do it and I
[1:33:44] I have really got it. But when it comes
[1:33:46] down to, okay, then let's let's rope or
[1:33:49] let's do whatever, you know, you really
[1:33:51] see a lot of holes in there. But you can
[1:33:53] really see that that that type in in
[1:33:56] other things, you know, because if if we
[1:33:59] think we've got it all figured out, then
[1:34:01] then we obviously can't be taught and
[1:34:03] we're not looking. So if a point from
[1:34:06] truth comes from the word up and and a
[1:34:08] man tries to explain his view to one
[1:34:10] with an opposing view, the listener is
[1:34:12] not listening, not at all listening that
[1:34:15] he might learn, but is listening only to
[1:34:18] refute what is being said.
[1:34:20] Now I want to ask a fair question. Can
[1:34:24] scripture fight scripture?
[1:34:28] Does the Bible contradict the Bible?
[1:34:32] Does the message contradict the Bible?
[1:34:37] Can there be two doctrines of truth in
[1:34:39] the word that say opposite or oppose one
[1:34:43] another to the other? No, it cannot be
[1:34:46] so. Yet, how many of God's people have
[1:34:48] their eyes open to that truth?
[1:34:52] Not even 1%, as far as I know,
[1:34:56] have all learned have learned all
[1:34:59] scripture is given by God and all is
[1:35:02] profitable for doctrine, reprove,
[1:35:04] correction, etc. If all scripture is
[1:35:06] thusly given, then every verse will
[1:35:09] dovetail if given a chance.
[1:35:14] But how many believes
[1:35:17] in predestination unto election and rep
[1:35:20] probation unto destruction. Those who
[1:35:22] don't, will they listen? No, they will
[1:35:26] not. Yet they are both in the word and
[1:35:29] nothing will change. Nothing will change
[1:35:31] it. But to learn about it and reconcile
[1:35:35] truth, the truth of those doctrines with
[1:35:38] other truths that seem to oppose,
[1:35:41] they will not take the time.
[1:35:45] But they stop their ears and nash their
[1:35:47] teeth and they loose out
[1:35:50] and they lose out. At the end of the age
[1:35:54] the prophet will come but they will be
[1:35:56] blind to all that he is doing and
[1:35:58] saying.
[1:36:00] They are so sure they are right and in
[1:36:04] their blindness they will lose it all.
[1:36:11] So that there I I think was a little
[1:36:13] part of that his brother Mchuse's
[1:36:16] statement there kind of where the two
[1:36:19] seem to contradict
[1:36:21] you know there there's a revelation
[1:36:23] laying there and you know to to pray and
[1:36:26] to meditate on on this message
[1:36:29] and to ask God for a revelation is is
[1:36:32] really is really what we want to do in
[1:36:36] 2026
[1:36:37] really, you know, if if God has if we
[1:36:41] want to get to Jesus Christ, we want to
[1:36:43] get people to Jesus Christ and and we
[1:36:47] believe that God has opened the seven
[1:36:49] sealed mystery book to us
[1:36:52] and it and and it and it didn't just
[1:36:54] bring all the doctrine correct, but if
[1:36:58] God is the word,
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he and the full word has been
[1:37:03] restored to us and we see that the word
[1:37:06] is spirit and if we take that
[1:37:10] together then then the full person of
[1:37:13] God on display in the bride of Jesus
[1:37:16] Christ is what we're looking for.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; It's what we want in our lives and and
[1:37:21] we can't approach it by an intellectual
[1:37:23] conception and and you know that's the
[1:37:26] difference. We don't have to go out into
[1:37:28] the world and live rough lives to have
[1:37:30] it come in that way, in that power, in
[1:37:33] that all we have to do is sincerely with
[1:37:36] all of our hearts approach the truth.
[1:37:38] Now, we can be sincerely wrong, but we
[1:37:42] know that we have the truth. We know
[1:37:45] that we have the opening of the word of
[1:37:47] God. We know that that is what it says.
[1:37:50] It says it clearly. I have more quotes
[1:37:52] and we could just go on and on about
[1:37:54] these things, but we have the full
[1:37:57] restoration
[1:37:58] of the word of God. What was Elijah to
[1:38:00] come do? And it's to restore. We have
[1:38:03] the full word of God. And that brings us
[1:38:06] to the full presence of God, the full
[1:38:08] mind of Christ, to be in the individual
[1:38:11] today. And so, I just want to encourage
[1:38:14] you all in that. I'm going to read one
[1:38:16] more quote and then we'll go on. I'll
[1:38:20] get out of here. Give the mic to
[1:38:22] somebody that can use it.
[1:38:25] And the church of the living God knows
[1:38:27] how to take a hold of the word of God.
[1:38:30] Those great strong wings of his
[1:38:32] deliverance and hold to every divine
[1:38:35] promise. When a mighty shaking strikes
[1:38:38] the place they know how to hold,
[1:38:41] something just tells him. The world
[1:38:43] might say fanaticism, but they take a
[1:38:45] hold of a wing and they hold on because
[1:38:48] their nature is eagles. They know what
[1:38:51] to do. And oh, oh, this old mother when
[1:38:54] she turns her proud head and sees and
[1:38:56] sees her brood on her wings. I've often
[1:38:59] thought what God would do when he sees
[1:39:01] his church take their position at the
[1:39:04] word to claim every promise that God
[1:39:07] made. how he turns his proud head and to
[1:39:10] look and to see how he loves them with
[1:39:13] real love. Sees every member of the body
[1:39:16] positionally take its place. The
[1:39:19] Christian businessman at their place,
[1:39:20] the minister at his place, the prophet
[1:39:22] at his place.
[1:39:25] Then that old mother lets out a certain
[1:39:27] scream for her heart is thrilled and she
[1:39:30] full of joy and her little eaglets knows
[1:39:33] their place and they're all ready and
[1:39:36] she lets out a scream and takes to the
[1:39:38] sky. Oh, what a day when God gets his
[1:39:41] church on the word and there comes a
[1:39:44] certain hour that we fly away on the
[1:39:46] wings of the great speckled bird, a the
[1:39:49] great eagle of God, the great Holy
[1:39:51] Spirit anchored in the word. Now, it's a
[1:39:54] very peculiar thing what she does.
[1:39:57] She just gets as high as she can go and
[1:40:00] them little eagllets, they're not
[1:40:01] murmuring a bit. They got their little
[1:40:04] beaks set in them feathers, they just
[1:40:06] can't murmur. That's just the way that
[1:40:09] God takes his church. If you're really
[1:40:11] set in the word, you don't murmur. You
[1:40:14] just hold on.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; God made the promise. God can keep his
[1:40:19] promise.
[1:40:21] So they just hold on and and she takes
[1:40:24] them into places that they'd never
[1:40:27] thought they'd ever be. When she's
[1:40:30] soaring up there, oh, she goes into the
[1:40:33] bright blue sky and and now the strange
[1:40:36] thing is when she gets up there, she
[1:40:37] shakes every one of them off right in
[1:40:40] the middle of the air. And that's the
[1:40:42] way God does his church. He shakes him
[1:40:44] off. Fly for yourself.
[1:40:47] It's a strange thing as she shakes him
[1:40:49] off. She doesn't leave them though. She
[1:40:52] makes a big circle, goes out there,
[1:40:54] flies around watching them,
[1:40:57] and they're those little fellas knowing
[1:40:59] what to do for the first time. They're
[1:41:02] flopping their little wings. Oh, they're
[1:41:04] turning somersaults and everything else,
[1:41:07] but they're flopping anyhow. They're
[1:41:10] making some kind of effort.
[1:41:13] And if there ever was a time that the
[1:41:15] church needs to do some flopping, it's
[1:41:18] now.
[1:41:20] Now, these little eagles, they're not
[1:41:22] wearied because they all together,
[1:41:25] they're all together aware. She just
[1:41:27] flies down and swoops right under him,
[1:41:29] picks him up, brings him back into grace
[1:41:32] again. That's our great mother, the Holy
[1:41:35] Spirit. So, don't be afraid of
[1:41:37] fanaticism or wildfire. Our mother's
[1:41:40] watching over us. She makes those
[1:41:42] circles. She's fast. You should see her.
[1:41:46] And the thing of it is she can pick as
[1:41:50] many up. And this little fella is
[1:41:52] exhausted. Just turn over and over and
[1:41:55] over and over. Can't catch his breath.
[1:41:57] She catch one with her foot, another one
[1:42:01] with a foot. Catch another one with her
[1:42:03] mouth. Oh, the little eagle. So
[1:42:06] carefree.
[1:42:08] Because they're not resting in their own
[1:42:11] ability.
[1:42:13] They're resting in the ever presence,
[1:42:18] the ability of their mother who's
[1:42:20] watching over them.
[1:42:27] So
[1:42:31] maybe we could just pray one more time.
[1:42:33] Heavenly Father, Lord, I appreciate you
[1:42:36] so much for watching over your children,
[1:42:38] Lord, and and and for all these here,
[1:42:40] Lord Jesus.
[1:42:42] just so thankful that that your ability
[1:42:45] is sufficient, Lord. That your word that
[1:42:47] you've sent is sufficient for us in this
[1:42:49] hour. Lord, we don't want to take the
[1:42:51] way around. We don't want to go on any
[1:42:53] other way, Father, but your provided way
[1:42:55] to bring us spiritual revelation in this
[1:42:57] hour, Lord. You said a prophet was a
[1:43:00] divine revealer of the written word,
[1:43:02] Lord. And we want to take it that way.
[1:43:04] We want to receive it that way, Lord.
[1:43:06] And we want to we want to fly into
[1:43:07] places, Lord, that we never dreamed of.
[1:43:10] be with each one, Lord. Put the words
[1:43:12] together, Father, in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[1:43:18] praise. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:43:24] You know, sometimes you get started,
[1:43:25] it's hard to stop. Very hard to find a a
[1:43:28] place to stop. So, you just have to
[1:43:30] quit. And um let's sing that. I'm not
[1:43:34] saying that he had to quit, but we
[1:43:37] certainly appreciate that. Lord, I give
[1:43:39] you my heart. Lord, I give you my soul.
[1:43:41] I live for you alone. Let's sing that.
[1:43:43] Brother Nathaniel Barrett is going to
[1:43:45] come and take a few moments. Where is he
[1:43:48] at? Oh, he's right there. All right,
[1:43:50] let's stand and let's sing it. This is
[1:43:53] my desire
[1:43:58] to honor
[1:44:01] you.
[1:44:04] And Lord with all my heart
[1:44:09] I worship you
[1:44:14] [Music]
[1:44:17] and all I have within me.
[1:44:23] Lord I give
[1:44:26] you
[1:44:27] praise.
[1:44:31] All that I adore
[1:44:36] is in you.
[1:44:44] And Lord, I give you my heart.
[1:44:48] I give you my soul.
[1:44:51] [Music]
[1:44:53] Lord, I live for you alone.
[1:44:58] Every breath that I take,
[1:45:02] every moment I'm awake,
[1:45:06] Lord, have your
[1:45:09] Oh Lord, Lord, I give you, give you my
[1:45:14] heart.
[1:45:17] Oh,
[1:45:20] live for you alone.
[1:45:24] Every breath that I
[1:45:28] every moment, every moment I'm awake,
[1:45:33] have your one more time. Oh Lord, I give
[1:45:38] you my heart. Lord, I
[1:45:43] Hallelujah.
[1:45:45] And I live for you alone.
[1:45:50] Every breath that I take.
[1:45:54] Every moment, every moment I'm awake,
[1:45:59] have your way in me.
[1:46:05] Amen. Is that your desire? Lord, have
[1:46:09] your way in me. Amen. Can you say,
[1:46:13] "Praise the Lord." God bless you. Let's
[1:46:15] make Brother Nathaniel feel welcome. God
[1:46:18] bless you. Amen.
[1:46:22] And God bless everyone. Certainly happy
[1:46:25] to be here this evening. I just wanted
[1:46:28] to come and support the service and be
[1:46:30] in the amen corner for brother Will and
[1:46:33] whoever else was going to be speaking.
[1:46:35] So, and then true to fashion, brother
[1:46:38] Israel texted me this earlier today and
[1:46:41] said to make sure I have my Bible with
[1:46:43] me. So, I kind of figured uh what what
[1:46:47] uh he was hinting at. But um uh just you
[1:46:51] can be seated just for a second and
[1:46:53] we'll we'll stand here in a few minutes
[1:46:55] and go and go to the scripture. You can
[1:46:57] get uh St. John 17:20 ready.
[1:47:00] Brother Isel just gave me a few minutes,
[1:47:02] 20 minutes or so. So we'll uh
[1:47:05] we'll uh do the best we can.
[1:47:11] No, we're going to we're going to try to
[1:47:12] mind that. Uh praise the Lord. So St.
[1:47:16] John uh chapter uh St. John chapter 17.
[1:47:20] We'll go to that here in a second. But I
[1:47:22] have a few quotes to read. No need to
[1:47:24] try to pull them up, but I do want to
[1:47:26] pull I would like the sister back there
[1:47:28] if you don't mind. Uh modern events are
[1:47:30] made clear by prophecy. Paragraph 61. If
[1:47:34] you can just get that ready.
[1:47:37] Modern events made clear by prophecy.
[1:47:40] Paragraph 61.
[1:47:42] How many loves the Lord?
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; How many's
[1:47:46] ready for 2026.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's looking for a
[1:47:53] supernatural God in your life? Amen. I
[1:47:56] don't know about you, but Amen. You
[1:47:58] know, it's getting darker outside and
[1:48:01] and I just come to find out that I I
[1:48:03] can't really do much anymore without
[1:48:05] him, without his grace in in my life.
[1:48:07] And
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; you know, every morning I just wake up
[1:48:11] and like a little child asking my father
[1:48:14] to lead me. And you know, I like what I
[1:48:17] heard one brother say recently when it
[1:48:18] comes to the quotes, when it comes to
[1:48:20] the the Bible, when it comes to the
[1:48:21] messages, sometimes we get the idea, oh,
[1:48:23] I you know, I've heard that before. I've
[1:48:25] read that before. But the word of God is
[1:48:26] eternal. You've never read it before.
[1:48:28] You've never heard a tape before.
[1:48:30] Because God's mercies are new every
[1:48:33] morning. Amen. So that's our approach.
[1:48:35] Amen. every morning we should just walk
[1:48:37] as a little child before him. Good to
[1:48:39] see you, brother Jonathan. And um but
[1:48:42] I'm so so so glad that brother will read
[1:48:45] that last quote. It was really good. So
[1:48:48] I really appreciated that. Amen. How
[1:48:50] many appreciates our our papa eagle.
[1:48:52] Amen. Watching over us, teaching his
[1:48:54] little ones how to fly. Amen. So where
[1:48:56] those little eaglets get our beak into
[1:48:58] every feather of his wing. Amen. For
[1:49:00] every feather is a promise. We're
[1:49:02] clinging on to it. Amen. And it and
[1:49:04] it'll and it'll keep us through. Is that
[1:49:07] right? So, we're in this hour where, as
[1:49:09] the prophet said, it's time for the
[1:49:10] eagles to get to flying higher. Amen. Oh
[1:49:14] my. So, we're we're approaching another
[1:49:15] year. What we what the experience that
[1:49:18] we had in 2025, the revelations that we
[1:49:21] had, the the ground that we covered was
[1:49:24] great, but there's more ground to
[1:49:27] conquer. Is that right? There's more
[1:49:29] land to inhabit. So yesterday's
[1:49:32] experience will not work for tomorrow.
[1:49:34] Is that right? The enemy is stronger.
[1:49:37] The days are going to be darker. The
[1:49:38] wind's going to be colder. Amen. So we
[1:49:41] need a fresh experience every day. Amen.
[1:49:45] And so uh so something jumped out to me
[1:49:48] when brother Will was reading it from
[1:49:49] the church age book talking about uh
[1:49:52] that situation where Elijah blinded them
[1:49:54] the Syrian army to to all of that. And
[1:49:57] so I just want to read this. I don't
[1:49:59] want to go on to this too much, but we
[1:50:00] are in a very very late hour, very very
[1:50:03] desperate hour. We're 60 over 60 years
[1:50:05] now since the prophet and we are and we
[1:50:08] have uh coming here tomorrow or here in
[1:50:11] a few hours. We'll be entering into the
[1:50:13] seventh decade since the prophet went
[1:50:16] off the scene. So uh so things are very
[1:50:19] very happening in a very supernatural
[1:50:22] way, a very simple way and just true to
[1:50:25] scripture. He said, "I I come as a
[1:50:28] thief." Amen. And so what something
[1:50:31] jumped out at me what from that
[1:50:34] quotation that brother will said is that
[1:50:37] what they did not see brought on their
[1:50:40] captivity.
[1:50:43] And so I think that's the way it is with
[1:50:45] any in any of our lives. Is that right?
[1:50:47] Sometimes we get to thinking we know it
[1:50:49] all. We got it all figured out. We we
[1:50:50] get busy with the cares of life and so
[1:50:52] on and so forth. And what you will, what
[1:50:54] you are not seeing will bring on your
[1:50:57] captivity. And so I just want us to look
[1:51:00] at this quotation there, modern events
[1:51:02] made clear by prophecy, paragraph 61.
[1:51:06] Now, brother Brandham is saying here
[1:51:07] that these modern events
[1:51:11] is slipping by us too swiftly.
[1:51:16] And one day we're going to find out
[1:51:18] we'll be left behind without nothing.
[1:51:22] and be caught sealed into the mark of
[1:51:25] the beast before we know it. Amen. So,
[1:51:28] it behoo behooves us, friends, that uh
[1:51:30] church playing time is over with. Amen.
[1:51:33] It's time to get serious with God. You
[1:51:35] know, we we say that we, you know, we
[1:51:37] we're the people that have had our faith
[1:51:39] restored, right? We we rece we we've
[1:51:41] received the prophet of Malachi 4. We've
[1:51:43] had our faith restored back to the faith
[1:51:45] of the Pentecostal fathers. All of these
[1:51:47] things. Amen. And so, may God help us
[1:51:51] and just be with us. uh this coming up
[1:51:53] year and to be watchful. Is that right?
[1:51:56] You know, we were talking the other day
[1:51:57] that the scripture warns us. Jesus said
[1:51:59] to watch and pray. Amen. And again, he
[1:52:03] slipped it in there in between the sixth
[1:52:05] and seventh vial and the 16th chapter of
[1:52:07] Revelations. He said, "Behold, I come as
[1:52:10] a thief. Blessed is he that watchth and
[1:52:12] keep his garments."
[1:52:15] Amen. So, just remember that what you're
[1:52:16] not seeing can bring on your captivity.
[1:52:20] And may so may God anoint our Isavs and
[1:52:23] may we just approach this uh even the
[1:52:26] next few minutes that we have in 2025
[1:52:28] very very seriously.
[1:52:31] Amen. Because we don't want to go into
[1:52:34] 2026 dragging. Amen. We don't want to go
[1:52:36] into 2026 all intellectual in our minds
[1:52:39] and just all with all kinds of church
[1:52:41] quarrels and all kinds of you know
[1:52:44] bitterness or grudging or any kind of
[1:52:46] humanistic approach to this. Amen. We
[1:52:48] want a supernatural God. We want a
[1:52:50] supernatural experience in our life. Or
[1:52:53] we might as well go out and get drunk. I
[1:52:55] mean, I'm just I don't mean to be so
[1:52:57] blunt like that, but or we're just
[1:52:58] playing church or are we going to
[1:53:00] actually have a supernatural God and a
[1:53:02] supernatural experience in our life?
[1:53:04] Amen. So, for forgive me. I don't I
[1:53:06] don't I don't mean to be so blunt like
[1:53:07] that, but it's it's time to Amen. be
[1:53:10] blunt because one of these days uh
[1:53:14] you're going to wish perhaps uh some
[1:53:16] folks were a lot more bluntter.
[1:53:19] Amen. Praise God. The clock just started
[1:53:21] messing up. So I think that's a sign,
[1:53:24] brother Israel.
[1:53:28] Praise God. So let's stand to our feet
[1:53:30] and turn to St. John chapter 17 verse
[1:53:32] 20.
[1:53:34] This is my I think my all-time favorite
[1:53:36] scripture in the whole Bible. Chapter
[1:53:37] 17. This is John the great eagle. We
[1:53:41] know Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The
[1:53:43] lion, the ox, the man, the eagle in this
[1:53:46] hour, we're under the we're supposed to
[1:53:48] be under the eagle anointing. Is that
[1:53:50] right? To fly higher to see farther.
[1:53:52] Amen. So that way these things coming
[1:53:54] upon the world will not catch us
[1:53:56] unawares.
[1:53:57] Amen. But we're flying a fly high above
[1:54:00] them under the greatest anointing that
[1:54:02] has been released in this hour. Amen.
[1:54:05] And so, all right. St. In John chapter
[1:54:07] 17 20, this is so beautiful.
[1:54:13] And just for a little thought, I I would
[1:54:15] like to just call this the the fullness
[1:54:17] of love for the last great kill. Amen.
[1:54:22] How many How many is under anticipation
[1:54:24] for the last great kill? The last great
[1:54:26] kill of this flesh. Amen. for for the
[1:54:29] enemy, for Satan, for all of his tactics
[1:54:32] to have their effects strien off of our
[1:54:36] life. It's going to take perfect love to
[1:54:38] accomplish that. Amen. So Jesus said
[1:54:41] here in St. John 17:20, "Neither pray I
[1:54:44] for these alone, but for them also which
[1:54:48] shall believe on me through their word,
[1:54:52] that they all may be one,
[1:54:55] as thou, Father, art in me, and I in
[1:54:58] thee, that they also may be one in us,
[1:55:03] that the world may believe that thou has
[1:55:06] sent me,
[1:55:08] and the glory which thou gavest me,
[1:55:12] I have given them that they may be one
[1:55:18] a even as we are one.
[1:55:22] I in them and thou in me that they may
[1:55:27] be made perfect in one and that the
[1:55:30] world may know that thou has sent me and
[1:55:34] hast loved me or has loved them as thou
[1:55:37] hast loved me.
[1:55:39] Father, I will that they also whom thou
[1:55:43] hast given me be with me where I am that
[1:55:48] they may behold my glory which thou hast
[1:55:53] given me for thou lovest me before the
[1:55:56] foundation of the world. You may be
[1:55:58] seated. So just thinking about this
[1:56:00] fellowship. Amen.
[1:56:02] And so this great intercessory prayer
[1:56:04] that the Lord Jesus prays there at
[1:56:06] towards the end of his ministry, how
[1:56:09] that he would he was of course desiring
[1:56:11] that we would be one as him and the
[1:56:13] father are one and that we would be able
[1:56:17] to behold his glory
[1:56:20] and that where he was we would be also.
[1:56:22] Amen. So just think about that the love
[1:56:24] affair there as our brother Ben
[1:56:26] described that he brought that quotation
[1:56:28] up. You know the great compassion of our
[1:56:30] Lord Jesus.
[1:56:32] You know once you come in contact with
[1:56:34] that compassion once you come in contact
[1:56:36] with that love it changes your life.
[1:56:37] Amen. It it becomes not a religion of
[1:56:39] dos and don'ts but it becomes a
[1:56:41] fellowship a relationship. Amen. It
[1:56:44] becomes a love affair where there's
[1:56:46] nothing more important in life. You know
[1:56:48] your job your your your the dayto-day
[1:56:51] work affairs the cares of life. All of
[1:56:53] those things just fall by the wayside
[1:56:55] because you have a relationship now
[1:56:58] where you've come in contact with
[1:56:59] something that is eternal, something
[1:57:02] that is greater, amen, than than
[1:57:04] anything that this world can offer. And
[1:57:06] that's the love of God.
[1:57:09] Amen. And so may the love of God be
[1:57:11] greater in our life this coming up year
[1:57:13] than what it was
[1:57:15] this year. Amen. This coming up year,
[1:57:17] may it be greater. And so, Brother Bam
[1:57:19] makes this great quotation here in the
[1:57:21] message, things that are to be. He says,
[1:57:23] "Jesus only asked for one thing in his
[1:57:26] prayer to the father."
[1:57:29] You know what that was?
[1:57:32] one thing. After all his sacrifice that
[1:57:35] he did here on earth, the life that he
[1:57:38] lived, the path that he walked, he asked
[1:57:42] for one thing, that where I am, they may
[1:57:47] be also. Amen. That where he is, you can
[1:57:50] be also. Shalom tabernacle can be also.
[1:57:53] That where I am, they may be also. He
[1:57:57] asks for our fellowship.
[1:58:00] That's the only thing he asked the
[1:58:02] father in the prayer, your companionship
[1:58:04] forever. Oh man, isn't that something,
[1:58:07] friends? And so just think now in 2026,
[1:58:12] how much fellowship are you going to
[1:58:14] give him? Amen. That was his heart's
[1:58:16] desire. So what's hindering you? Amen. I
[1:58:19] know we get busy. We put so many things
[1:58:21] of such high value
[1:58:24] and but we're forsaking the greatest
[1:58:26] thing. Amen. We we we we get so caught
[1:58:28] up in the things of the world and even
[1:58:30] in church programs and church this and
[1:58:33] even you know even how brother Brandham
[1:58:35] often dramatized how Moses freshly
[1:58:37] commission was so caught up in in in
[1:58:40] that program that he forgot to
[1:58:42] circumcise his child. Right? So
[1:58:44] sometimes we forget the littlest things.
[1:58:47] Amen. But let's just let's just lay
[1:58:48] aside all of the excuses. Amen. All of
[1:58:53] the all of the like I said church
[1:58:55] quarrels. all the fleshly ways, all the
[1:58:58] fussing, all of the the my ideas and and
[1:59:02] all the what is you know all of our
[1:59:04] pride, all of our egos, all of these
[1:59:06] things so we can truly enter into a full
[1:59:10] fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:59:12] How many has that desire? Amen. There's
[1:59:14] nothing more important than to
[1:59:16] constantly stay in his fellowship, you
[1:59:18] know, and uh some of the times we we get
[1:59:21] so like know-it-alls, you know, some I
[1:59:24] heard one brother say quote misters,
[1:59:25] right? We got a quote for everything and
[1:59:27] quote quote quote quote quote, you know,
[1:59:29] but how much how much do you know about
[1:59:32] the God of the quotes? Is that right? H
[1:59:34] how have you been in his presence? Have
[1:59:37] you felt that supernatural anointing?
[1:59:40] Have you seen his word unfolding and
[1:59:42] being made manifest in your life?
[1:59:46] Or is this just a religion to you? Is it
[1:59:48] an encyclopedia to you of information?
[1:59:51] Or is it a love affair? Amen. Because
[1:59:53] this is the hour of the descending of
[1:59:55] the capstone of perfect love.
[1:59:58] Amen. And this of course is the greatest
[2:00:01] battle ever fought. But we're now
[2:00:03] striking that final hour for the last
[2:00:05] great kill. There are sons of God around
[2:00:08] the world. Amen. That have been raised
[2:00:09] up, that have been stripping down.
[2:00:12] Stripped down and and and somebody's
[2:00:14] coming on the scene to fulfill the word
[2:00:16] of of of this prophet. Is that right?
[2:00:19] Amen. And so, may 2026 be that year for
[2:00:21] you. May it be the last great kill of
[2:00:25] your fleshly ways, of your your little
[2:00:28] fusses, and your quarrels and and and
[2:00:30] and your excuses. is may it be may it be
[2:00:33] the last great kill for you to have a
[2:00:36] full surrendered life to the Lord Jesus
[2:00:38] Christ and to so that way you can know
[2:00:40] him in the power of his resurrection.
[2:00:42] Amen. Amen. Not just a quote Meister.
[2:00:45] Amen. But the power of the living God
[2:00:47] coming upon you and breaking you. Amen.
[2:00:51] And making you a complete prisoner as he
[2:00:53] did Samson. Is that right? Amen. That's
[2:00:55] the only kind of people that are going
[2:00:58] in the rapture is not quote meers. Is
[2:01:00] not church members. is not preachers,
[2:01:02] ministers, piano players. It's
[2:01:04] prisoners. Prisoners of his love. Those
[2:01:07] that have had their intellects
[2:01:09] completely emptied out. He can't use any
[2:01:12] of your intellects. You must become
[2:01:14] completely hollowed and filled with his
[2:01:17] love. Amen. So, are you under great
[2:01:19] anticipation for this hour?
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's an hour of final
[2:01:23] deliverance. It's an hour of perfect
[2:01:25] healing, complete healing. Amen. And so
[2:01:28] now, brother Brandon would say here in
[2:01:30] this message, God has a provided way. He
[2:01:32] says, "Now here sits a group of people
[2:01:34] here tonight." And I know he's speaking
[2:01:36] here of a church setting, but I want to
[2:01:38] put us under expectation. So here we are
[2:01:40] for the last great kill. Here we are for
[2:01:42] the final and complete healing. Amen.
[2:01:46] Now, here sets a group of people here
[2:01:48] tonight setting, waiting under great
[2:01:51] anticipation.
[2:01:52] And Satan, if he can interrupt your
[2:01:55] mind,
[2:01:57] that's all he has to do. But let's go in
[2:02:00] now for the great kill just now to drive
[2:02:03] Satan and all of his powers plum out of
[2:02:06] the building. Amen. Amen. So, I don't
[2:02:09] know if that's your desire or not, but
[2:02:10] may God create that desire within you
[2:02:13] for 2026 starting at 12:01 a.m. tonight.
[2:02:17] Amen. We must redeem the time for the
[2:02:20] days are evil and what you are not aware
[2:02:23] of will destroy you.
[2:02:26] Yes, sir. Amen. This is too late of an
[2:02:29] hour to just play church. Is that right?
[2:02:31] And so in reading this, I was reminded
[2:02:34] when when God came down in Genesis 18 to
[2:02:38] visit Abraham and in his in his humble
[2:02:41] dwelling there in his home. How many
[2:02:42] knows the story? Everybody is familiar
[2:02:44] with it. You know, he just, you know,
[2:02:47] out of 16 elements formed himself a body
[2:02:49] and he said, "Come here, Michael. Come
[2:02:51] here, Gabriel." And he came down for
[2:02:53] what purpose? To have fellowship with
[2:02:56] his son. Oh my. Think about that. God
[2:02:59] wants to have fellowship with you. Who
[2:03:03] do you want to have fellowship with?
[2:03:04] Amen. We spend so much of time on our
[2:03:06] phone trying to answer these people's
[2:03:08] problems, these people problems, this
[2:03:10] question, this question, this fuss in
[2:03:12] the church, this thing going on. But
[2:03:14] what about your fellowship with God?
[2:03:18] After all, you've exhausted all of your
[2:03:20] energy, all your mental capacity. You've
[2:03:23] got five minutes before you lay down to
[2:03:25] fellowship with God,
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; you know, or you're too tired or you're
[2:03:30] too this, you got to do the dishes, you
[2:03:31] got to do this, that, or the other. But
[2:03:33] let's stop.
[2:03:35] Amen. Bring a halt to that. Amen. And
[2:03:39] let's let God have some fellowship with
[2:03:41] us this year. Amen. more than ever
[2:03:44] before because this is the final hour
[2:03:46] for the last great kill.
[2:03:51] And so there God came down. He wanted to
[2:03:53] have some fellowship with his children.
[2:03:56] Is that right? He wanted to show talk to
[2:03:59] them about the mystery of the body
[2:04:00] change. He wanted to talk to them about
[2:04:02] the mystery of the end of the world and
[2:04:04] all of these things. And there it was an
[2:04:06] hour of judgment
[2:04:08] coming upon the world. But there
[2:04:10] Abraham, Amen, he was standing in the
[2:04:12] gap. And so there uh under that great
[2:04:16] visitation,
[2:04:18] the prophet of God will go on to say
[2:04:19] that Satan interrupted Sarah's mind, if
[2:04:24] you will. Is that right? Sarah, he he
[2:04:26] just caused Sarah to be a little fussy
[2:04:28] that morning. What was that? Satan
[2:04:31] trying to to hinder the move of God.
[2:04:35] Satan trying to prevent Abraham from
[2:04:38] recognizing God coming to fellowship
[2:04:41] with him. Satan just interrupted uh uh
[2:04:44] uh uh Sarah's mind and cause her to be a
[2:04:47] little bit fussy. Amen. So just think
[2:04:50] that's all he has to do is get us a
[2:04:52] little bit fussy on this or a little bit
[2:04:54] something like this. Brother, why does
[2:04:56] brother Israel have to do this? Why
[2:04:58] can't we do that? Amen. That's Satan
[2:05:01] interrupting the program of God.
[2:05:07] Amen. So, let's just throw all that
[2:05:09] aside and let's enter into this great
[2:05:11] place now where we can have fellowship
[2:05:13] with Jehovah God. Amen.
[2:05:16] For the last great kill. Is that right?
[2:05:19] Amen. Let me just read another quote
[2:05:20] here.
[2:05:22] This is in the message of deceived
[2:05:24] church by the world. This is the prophet
[2:05:27] of God prophesying now. Okay. You know,
[2:05:30] he's he's he he he shows us a mystery in
[2:05:32] the life of Samson. How Samson was
[2:05:35] raised up to destroy the enemy. The very
[2:05:38] enemy that he was raised up to destroy
[2:05:40] destroyed him. Is that right? And so
[2:05:42] there Samson came on the scene. He was
[2:05:44] actually the seventh judge under the
[2:05:47] seventh apostasy. He came down in that
[2:05:49] final hour and the angel of the Lord
[2:05:52] descended and spoke of his birth and
[2:05:54] gave him a Nazerite vow of seven locks,
[2:05:57] the sevenfold covenant, all these things
[2:05:59] that was a secret that he was not to
[2:06:01] give away. But there, amen, the enemy
[2:06:04] trapped him. We know the story. He ended
[2:06:05] up plucking his eyes out. And so there
[2:06:08] he was completely defeated after the
[2:06:11] eyes had went off the scene as it were.
[2:06:13] And there he was, a total prisoner. I
[2:06:17] wonder if that's the hour that God has
[2:06:19] brought some of us to. Amen. To where we
[2:06:21] can just be a total prisoner to him. And
[2:06:24] as I think I can't remember who said it,
[2:06:25] but God Yeah. Brother Brother will just
[2:06:28] in training horses. God will allow these
[2:06:30] pressures to come in your life for what
[2:06:32] purpose? To get you to be a complete
[2:06:35] prisoner. Samson was a prisoner. Paul
[2:06:38] was a prisoner. William Brandham was a
[2:06:40] prisoner. The Lord Jesus was a prisoner.
[2:06:42] How much more ought we in this hour as
[2:06:44] the bride of Jesus Christ to fulfill the
[2:06:47] final call, the final hour, the rapt,
[2:06:51] you know, the resurrection rapture. How
[2:06:53] much more ought we to be prisoners? How
[2:06:56] much more do we need to be prisoners?
[2:06:58] Amen. We get so kind of highminded that
[2:07:01] we've got all this knowledge, but Amen.
[2:07:05] Your knowledge is not going to do you
[2:07:06] any good, friends. You must get his
[2:07:08] mind.
[2:07:10] Amen. So, we know the story. There was
[2:07:12] Samson bounds
[2:07:14] led being led now by a little child
[2:07:17] exactly how God wanted him. He could
[2:07:19] lead himself at one point in time, but
[2:07:21] he in order to destroy the enemy for
[2:07:23] that final kill, he had to be led by a
[2:07:27] child.
[2:07:28] Amen. And so here the prophet of God is
[2:07:32] saying here, here's the only hope that I
[2:07:34] have this morning to wind up my message
[2:07:36] is this. While Samson was bound, a new
[2:07:39] shock of hair growled out. Hallelujah.
[2:07:42] Amen. God sent us another church just
[2:07:45] before the end time that the power of
[2:07:47] the Holy Ghost can come into her and the
[2:07:50] demonstrations of the spirit.
[2:07:52] Mark 16 can follow the church. Acts 2
[2:07:55] and4, Acts 2:38, all of it will be
[2:07:58] following right along with the church.
[2:08:00] Signs and wonders accompanying the
[2:08:02] apostles, great signs of his
[2:08:03] resurrection accompanying them. While
[2:08:06] we're in prison, surely God's got a crop
[2:08:10] growing. Surely God's growing a crop
[2:08:13] somewhere for the last great kill. May
[2:08:16] it be you, my Christian friend, here
[2:08:18] this morning, may it be your strength
[2:08:20] has be to grow. Amen. So God is growing
[2:08:24] a crop for the last great kill. And the
[2:08:26] prophet God will go on to say in another
[2:08:28] another spot talking about Jesus
[2:08:30] resting. He said, "I wonder if he's
[2:08:32] resting between revivals." Amen. So, we
[2:08:35] know we had a revival, great sweeping
[2:08:37] world revival where revival fire I'm
[2:08:40] just closing here in just a few seconds
[2:08:42] where revival fires were burning on
[2:08:44] every hillside. But then now Jesus is
[2:08:47] taking a little rest. Is that right?
[2:08:49] Trying to get a few prisoners here and
[2:08:51] there, trying to to to uh uh strip a few
[2:08:54] down here and there as the prophet of
[2:08:56] God said, you know, speaking of the of
[2:08:58] what would bring the bride's revival. Is
[2:09:01] that right? There's only one thing that
[2:09:03] can bring a revival to us in this hour
[2:09:05] and we have to have the prescription
[2:09:06] that the prophet has laid out in this
[2:09:09] hour. Amen. It has to be oil and wine.
[2:09:13] Amen. Is the only thing that that can
[2:09:14] bring revival. Is that right? So may all
[2:09:16] of our quotes, may all of our doctrine,
[2:09:18] may may this year may turn into wine and
[2:09:23] become stimulating power in our life to
[2:09:26] transform us above all the things of the
[2:09:29] world, above all of our sins bound exist
[2:09:32] existence, all of our fleshly ways. And
[2:09:34] and and let's enter into 2026. Amen. On
[2:09:38] fire for the Lord, making time for God.
[2:09:40] Amen. What's more important? You know,
[2:09:42] your your job is going to cease. says
[2:09:44] Paul said, "Your money perish with you."
[2:09:47] What are you going to do with it? Amen.
[2:09:51] Oh my. And so we put so much emphasis on
[2:09:53] that when we ought to be putting
[2:09:55] emphasis on the fellowship of the Lord
[2:09:56] Jesus Christ. Is that right? There's
[2:09:58] nothing more important than that. And
[2:09:59] I'll just say quickly uh I don't know if
[2:10:02] the musicians are coming, but I'm I'm
[2:10:03] done right now. I just just a real quick
[2:10:05] testimony, you know, uh here speaking of
[2:10:08] the fellowship of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:10:10] Amen. That amen. We got to make time for
[2:10:12] him, friends. And you know, just the
[2:10:14] other night, uh, again, fellowship, he
[2:10:16] woke me up really early in the morning
[2:10:18] around 1:30 in the morning. I was
[2:10:20] praying about some things. I was kind of
[2:10:23] a little bit of a head cold and was a
[2:10:24] little weak in body. I said, "Lord, if
[2:10:27] you I didn't wake up till one night and
[2:10:28] I felt really bad. I said, Lord, if you
[2:10:30] want me to if you want to get these
[2:10:33] things across to me, you're going to
[2:10:34] have to give me strength." And man, by
[2:10:37] the grace of God, he woke me up at 1:30
[2:10:39] in the morning. And my, we were just
[2:10:42] having a jubilee all the way until I had
[2:10:44] a very important business meeting that
[2:10:46] morning. But I tell you friends, that
[2:10:49] fellowship was more important than any
[2:10:50] business meeting, whatever it is. So, I
[2:10:52] canceled the business meeting.
[2:10:55] I said, I'm just going to worship my
[2:10:57] Lord because what's being revealed right
[2:10:59] now is way more important than any
[2:11:02] business meeting. I don't care if you're
[2:11:04] Sorry, Brother John. I don't care if
[2:11:05] you're if you're doing something for the
[2:11:07] government, if you're doing this, that
[2:11:08] or the other. There's nothing more
[2:11:10] important than this. Amen. Praise the
[2:11:12] Lord. So, may God create that desire in
[2:11:14] your heart. May we have a real church.
[2:11:16] Is that right? Full of not not quote
[2:11:19] misters, not somebody so strong and
[2:11:22] intellectual and all this, know it all,
[2:11:24] but weaklings. Amen. That those that
[2:11:27] have mastered the thought of human
[2:11:28] ability. Amen. prisoners of love that
[2:11:32] cannot have their minds interrupted by
[2:11:35] Satan. Is that right? So, let's let's
[2:11:38] buckle up the full armor of God now and
[2:11:40] enter into a full fellowship for perfect
[2:11:44] love to descend upon us for the last
[2:11:47] great kill. Would that be your desire?
[2:11:49] So, all the foolishness, the fleshly
[2:11:51] ways, the bobbed hair, the painted face,
[2:11:53] all these little tendencies will just
[2:11:55] fall by the wayside, friends. Amen. So,
[2:11:58] God bless you. May the Lord be with you.
[2:12:00] May the love of God be with you. Let's
[2:12:01] just pray real quick and let's stand to
[2:12:03] our feet. Let's just offer a word of
[2:12:05] prayer. I know brother Israel will
[2:12:06] probably go into the to the new year
[2:12:08] with a word of prayer, but uh let's just
[2:12:11] get ready. We'll have a a prayer for the
[2:12:14] prayer service. All right.
[2:12:16] So, let's just open up our hearts and uh
[2:12:20] again, you know, you can just pray in
[2:12:22] your own way. I you know, I want a
[2:12:24] refilling of the Holy Ghost. I want a
[2:12:25] rededicate my life. I want a
[2:12:27] reconsecration. I don't want to take any
[2:12:29] baggage with me, you know. I don't want
[2:12:30] to take any If there's anything we need
[2:12:32] to make right, let's make it right
[2:12:33] tonight. We don't want to take it with
[2:12:35] us into the new year. Amen. We want to
[2:12:37] start off the new year fresh on a clean
[2:12:40] slate as it were, renewed in our
[2:12:42] strength and our faith and our love and
[2:12:44] our determination and our focus for God.
[2:12:47] Amen. And so, let's just open up our
[2:12:49] hearts. You can pray in your own way and
[2:12:52] and we'll just pray together and let's
[2:12:55] just be sensitive to the Holy Spirit.
[2:12:56] Let's quieten ourselves down. I was just
[2:12:58] listening to the sills and brother Ram
[2:13:00] said, "I'm trying to walk so quietly."
[2:13:03] Amen. In this late hour, may we may we
[2:13:06] just not get caught up in the noise of
[2:13:07] the world or the glitter of the world or
[2:13:10] the fashions of the world or the cares
[2:13:12] of life, but may we walk quietly,
[2:13:14] humbly, simply before our God. And may
[2:13:17] we be available for the supernatural.
[2:13:20] May we may we be may we be easily led
[2:13:23] and easily entreated.
[2:13:26] Gentle. Amen. The prophet said to walk
[2:13:28] with God, we we must we must be gentle.
[2:13:30] Sister, you can play something softly.
[2:13:32] To walk with God, we must be gentle. We
[2:13:34] must be humble. We must walk in love.
[2:13:37] As the as the scripture says that
[2:13:39] because iniquity shall abound, the love
[2:13:41] of many shall wax cold. May the coldness
[2:13:43] flee your home. May there not be any May
[2:13:46] you turn your home into into a prayer
[2:13:48] service. Amen. May may your homes be
[2:13:50] consecrated. May your homes be full of
[2:13:53] the love of God. May May the May the
[2:13:56] foolishness, the TVs, the internet, the
[2:13:59] anything that's hindering Amen. When's
[2:14:01] the last time you had an angelic
[2:14:02] visitation in your home? When's the last
[2:14:04] time you had a supernatural visitation?
[2:14:07] And when's the last time you had a a
[2:14:09] dream, a vision, a prophecy, a healing,
[2:14:11] a thus sayeth the Lord? And yet we claim
[2:14:14] to be an apostolic church that has had
[2:14:16] our faith restored, but yet we're
[2:14:18] walking in the flesh, drifting from
[2:14:20] church service to church service,
[2:14:22] intellectual, full of quotes, full of
[2:14:24] knowledge. May God strike every bit of
[2:14:27] it down. And may we open up our hearts
[2:14:30] to him and just walk in fellowship
[2:14:32] knowing that that after all his three
[2:14:34] and a half years of of ministry. That
[2:14:38] was the one thing that he wanted more
[2:14:39] than anything was to have fellowship
[2:14:41] with us.
[2:14:43] And so we may we make our homes
[2:14:45] available to have fellowship. May we
[2:14:46] make our rooms, our prayer closets, our
[2:14:49] cars, our automobiles.
[2:14:51] Remember, don't let don't let this
[2:14:53] evening pass by without having some
[2:14:55] fellowship with him. Let's just open up
[2:14:58] our hearts. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[2:15:00] thank you, Father, that we can, Lord,
[2:15:02] the great God of heaven, the great
[2:15:04] supreme creator of eternal life of of of
[2:15:07] the heavens and earth, of the universe,
[2:15:09] you desire to have fellowship with us,
[2:15:12] Father, Lord, and may you give us grace,
[2:15:14] Father, as the Lord, I'm reminded how
[2:15:17] the animals, Lord, they know their
[2:15:18] maker, but us men, women, we think we
[2:15:21] know it all. We're heady, high-minded,
[2:15:23] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[2:15:25] God, truth breakers, false accusers,
[2:15:26] incontinent despisers of those that are
[2:15:28] good. Father, may not may that not be
[2:15:31] amongst us, Lord. But may your word
[2:15:34] become rich to us, Father. May we enter
[2:15:36] into the secret closet, Lord. And
[2:15:39] Father, may the water of this word turn
[2:15:41] to wine in our in this hour. May it
[2:15:43] become stimulated, Father. Bless brother
[2:15:46] Israel. Bless the church, Father. Give
[2:15:48] us a fresh revival, Lord. A revival,
[2:15:50] Father. Lord, as the prophet said, raise
[2:15:52] up speakers of tongues, Lord. Give us
[2:15:54] visions, dreams. Raise up mighty men,
[2:15:57] Father. Lord, teach us, Lord, of your
[2:15:59] ways. Cap off the pyramid of our lives,
[2:16:01] Father. Lord, raise up, raise us up,
[2:16:04] Father, from this slumping, sick bound
[2:16:07] existence, Father, of just barely making
[2:16:10] it. Father, we want to be overcomers,
[2:16:12] Father. Lord, may the pure unadulterated
[2:16:15] revealed word in his full strength,
[2:16:18] Father, be ministered from this pullpit,
[2:16:20] Lord, that every captive can be set
[2:16:22] free, Father. Lord, because the sin is
[2:16:25] raging, Father, the power of the enemy
[2:16:27] is so strong, and there's nothing of
[2:16:29] such keeping power outside of the
[2:16:31] revealed word that you have brought in
[2:16:33] this hour, Father. Lord, may you visit
[2:16:36] Israel with a fresh anointing, Lord, a
[2:16:38] fresh inspirations, Lord, of the Holy
[2:16:40] Ghost, Father. Lord, to find those in
[2:16:42] between places that the prophet of God
[2:16:44] said, "I wish we could have time, Lord,
[2:16:46] to find these secret passages in the
[2:16:48] scripture, Lord. May those secret
[2:16:50] passages be unlocked, Father, and bring
[2:16:52] out the the hidden mana this year, Lord,
[2:16:55] that's reserved for the overcomer, Lord,
[2:16:57] that we can have a real revival that
[2:16:59] that oil and wine can be plentiful,
[2:17:03] Lord, in this church. Father, may Lord,
[2:17:06] as the meal has been ground out every
[2:17:08] bit, Lord, this Jesus Christ the same
[2:17:10] yesterday, today, and forever, may we
[2:17:12] take our two sticks and bake it into
[2:17:14] reality. Father, two sticks of
[2:17:16] crucifixion, Lord. May we have a
[2:17:18] crucified life. Father, forgive us,
[2:17:20] Lord. Forgive us of our fussing, of our
[2:17:22] quarrel, quarrels, of our temperamental
[2:17:25] ways, of our allowing Satan to interrupt
[2:17:27] our minds and disturb the program of
[2:17:29] God. May you forgive us, Lord. We want
[2:17:31] to repent, Lord. We want to just empty
[2:17:33] all out before you. Fill us, Father.
[2:17:36] Cleanse us from all righteousness,
[2:17:37] Father. We commit, Lord, this remainder
[2:17:40] of the service into your hands. We love
[2:17:41] you, Father. And we give you our heart,
[2:17:43] Lord. May you take it and use it,
[2:17:45] Father. each and every heart Lord in
[2:17:48] Jesus name we pray. Amen and amen.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you brother. Amen.
[2:17:55] Praise the Lord. God bless you. Amen.
[2:18:00] I think at this time we have uh the
[2:18:02] slideshow for the end of the year. If
[2:18:04] that's ready, sis. Is it? Yeah. Okay.
[2:18:08] So, just be seated and this will be a
[2:18:10] few moments and we'll play that. Then
[2:18:12] I'll have brother Joe Robson come.
[2:18:15] Brother Art Salceto will come and then I
[2:18:17] will close up in her prayer into the new
[2:18:20] year. God bless you.

[2:44:35] Oh, praise the Lord. Thank the Lord.
[2:44:38] Thank you, Sister Heather and Sister
[2:44:41] Aaliyah. They did that. Takes a lot of
[2:44:43] work to put that together. How many love
[2:44:46] the Lord tonight?
[2:44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Almost this morning. And uh we
[2:44:51] just want to thank the Lord for his
[2:44:53] goodness and mercy to us. Um
[2:44:56] I have one scripture I'd like to read
[2:44:58] for you out of Ephesians chapter 3
[2:45:02] and um
[2:45:05] Ephesians chapter 4 as well.
[2:45:11] Ephesians
[2:45:27] chapter 3
[2:45:34] verse
[2:45:41] Number 14. For this cause I bow my knees
[2:45:45] unto the father of our Lord Jesus
[2:45:47] Christ, of whom the whole family in
[2:45:50] heaven and earth is named.
[2:45:54] And then
[2:45:56] Ephesians 4:es
[2:45:59] 5, one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
[2:46:04] one God and father of all who is above
[2:46:07] all and through all and in you all.
[2:46:12] And um those are just highlighting that
[2:46:16] it's a family of God that we belong to
[2:46:20] and he's the father and he's uh above
[2:46:23] all of us. He works through all of us
[2:46:27] and he's actually in all of us and
[2:46:29] that's our love and respect towards each
[2:46:31] other is um our heavenly father working
[2:46:35] through us. Amen. And so as we move
[2:46:38] forward into the coming year, I'd like
[2:46:41] to encourage all of the fathers
[2:46:45] um to take their role in the house of
[2:46:48] the Lord in their own homes, leading
[2:46:51] that charge, leading that way along with
[2:46:54] mom and the children and each
[2:46:58] individual, each brother, each sister,
[2:47:00] each young person to take that
[2:47:02] responsibility as we see that day
[2:47:05] approaching. And I know that as we've
[2:47:08] heard tonight, the tremendous
[2:47:09] testimonies of what the Lord has done
[2:47:12] for the different brothers and the
[2:47:14] different ones. And uh we want him to
[2:47:17] continue doing that. And he does that by
[2:47:19] his holy spirit. Amen. Amen. So um
[2:47:23] brother Joe Robson, would you come and
[2:47:25] greet the saints? He's one of the
[2:47:27] elders, deacon among us. He serves very
[2:47:31] very well and uh he's always available
[2:47:35] to do um he's one of the tallest one
[2:47:39] among us but he knows how to hide very
[2:47:42] well. I mean I don't really know when
[2:47:44] Joe's birthday is. I never see him
[2:47:47] hardly eat. I know he does but he he
[2:47:51] hides very well and you know stuff has
[2:47:54] to get done. any kind of praise, any
[2:47:56] kind of acknowledgement. He we don't
[2:47:59] probably acknowledge him how how we
[2:48:02] should, but we certainly appreciate him,
[2:48:03] don't we?
[2:48:05] &gt;&gt; And so, Amen.
[2:48:11] Thank you, brother Israel. I love you.
[2:48:13] Appreciate you so much. Appreciate
[2:48:14] everybody. Brother Israel mentioned he
[2:48:16] might call me up here the other day, and
[2:48:18] I told him I didn't have anything to
[2:48:20] say. Um, and I'm definitely not going to
[2:48:22] take you into the new year. Um, but I do
[2:48:25] want to tell you I love and appreciate
[2:48:26] each and every one of you. Brother
[2:48:28] Israel didn't give me a time limit. He
[2:48:30] has that much faith and trust in me. So,
[2:48:33] I was going to tell you I'd take an hour
[2:48:34] or something, but we're so close. I
[2:48:36] certainly won't do that. Um, remember
[2:48:39] our precious sister Tila. She had to
[2:48:40] leave. I was a little concerned about
[2:48:42] her because she was moving very slowly
[2:48:45] and we know she's had back problems and
[2:48:46] things. So, we'll just hold her up in
[2:48:48] prayer together tonight. We appreciate
[2:48:49] her. Appreciate each and every one of
[2:48:51] these brothers. Brother Trevor leading
[2:48:53] us in worship, Brother Ben, Brother
[2:48:55] Will, Brother Nathaniel,
[2:48:57] and uh I might have a little bit of
[2:49:00] hype, but I always look up to Brother
[2:49:02] Art here, and he's
[2:49:05] he is the real deal. And I appreciate
[2:49:08] you, my brother, so much. It was nice to
[2:49:10] see you, thought about you, wasn't sure
[2:49:12] you're going to make it. He was telling
[2:49:14] us outside, you know, they that they
[2:49:16] don't make them like Brother Carpenter
[2:49:17] and these old ones anymore. they would
[2:49:20] start at 7 or 8 and go to the new year.
[2:49:22] I was complaining a little bit, you
[2:49:24] know, to him and and I appreciate you
[2:49:26] and Sister Annabelle so much, my
[2:49:27] brother. I do look up to you and and I
[2:49:31] think we have a hero of the faith. I got
[2:49:33] to meet sister Beth the yesterday in
[2:49:37] person and I look up to my precious
[2:49:39] sister as well. We know Job. There's a
[2:49:43] time they were looking for somebody and
[2:49:45] and the Lord said, "Have you considered
[2:49:47] my servant Job or my servant Beth?" He
[2:49:50] didn't. He We've all Israel has taught
[2:49:52] us our test and trials are custom made
[2:49:55] for you, for me. And she was up there
[2:49:59] and she got a custom trial for her and
[2:50:02] she made it through with
[2:50:04] just what do they say? Colors, the
[2:50:07] glowing colors, the shining colors. And
[2:50:09] we appreciate you, my sister. And of
[2:50:11] course, Brother Kim and Sister Hedi.
[2:50:12] Sister Hedi didn't say a whole lot in
[2:50:14] the testimony. I gave her a little bit
[2:50:15] of a hard time, but I know she was right
[2:50:17] there through the thick and the thin,
[2:50:19] and we appreciate him so much. I'm proud
[2:50:21] of these kids tonight, too. My precious
[2:50:24] brother Josiah, he's already been in a
[2:50:26] 7:00 service. That would have been my
[2:50:28] choice, but then he got to come here.
[2:50:30] And we appreciate I'm proud of you. And
[2:50:32] I know they got to pick up the the
[2:50:34] in-laws tonight, and so maybe they'll
[2:50:36] slip out or whatever. I'm proud of each
[2:50:38] and everyone. And brother Billy, we're
[2:50:40] proud of you, too, my brother. And thank
[2:50:41] you for joining us tonight.
[2:50:44] I don't stay up late except I got to
[2:50:46] pick up a granddaughter, not a son, but
[2:50:48] maybe a granddaughter. We did this till
[2:50:50] 2:00 a.m. last night to warm up, to get
[2:50:53] the kids here, or to worship. So, it's
[2:50:55] just a fine thing to do with each and
[2:50:57] every one of you. And we appreciate
[2:51:00] especially the post family so much. um
[2:51:03] these labors of love, Sister Sharon,
[2:51:06] Cararissa, Levi, Aaliyah, and so we're
[2:51:09] thankful for them tonight and each of
[2:51:12] you, the board, and of course, my wife
[2:51:15] has disappeared and I love her and she
[2:51:17] keeps me grounded and um I thank the
[2:51:20] Lord for Sister Aaron.
[2:51:23] And of course, a year ago, it's a lot of
[2:51:26] river water has gone under the bridge.
[2:51:28] It doesn't seem like, but yesterday we
[2:51:30] were worshiping in a bank and then the
[2:51:33] brothers were looking at this facility
[2:51:34] and I said, "Oh my, 900,000. It it just
[2:51:37] wasn't much. I didn't have much of a
[2:51:39] vision. I didn't know the Lord was going
[2:51:41] to give it to us at half price." And I
[2:51:43] would have never envisioned as nice as a
[2:51:45] facility as we got. And of course, we
[2:51:48] get here and then I complain about this,
[2:51:49] that, or the other. But it's good to go
[2:51:51] back and just remind ourselves of what
[2:51:54] we had. And yes, we want to make it
[2:51:56] better. We want it perfect. We want to
[2:51:57] improve. and we will always do that. But
[2:52:00] just look look was nice to be reminded
[2:52:02] of where we came from. We had a Peru um
[2:52:07] my nephew gave a Peru report and they
[2:52:09] don't have you know just dirt floors and
[2:52:12] things over in South America and those
[2:52:14] things. And so we're just thankful for
[2:52:15] what the Lord has done for us above and
[2:52:18] beyond what we could have asked or
[2:52:20] imagined as it says also in Ephesians.
[2:52:23] So, we're so thankful and grateful to
[2:52:25] have worked together with you for it.
[2:52:28] Um, and may we ever just improve and
[2:52:31] make it better. I was telling the
[2:52:33] brothers the other day at the prayer
[2:52:35] meeting, um, of course, Brother Brandham
[2:52:37] has reminded us many times of what God's
[2:52:39] time piece is. Do any of the children
[2:52:41] know what that is? Brother Nathaniel,
[2:52:44] you, uh, Robson, you know what the time
[2:52:45] piece, God's time piece is? Do you
[2:52:47] remember Timothy? Israel. How many knows
[2:52:51] there was some miracles over in Israel
[2:52:53] this year? U many of you know what
[2:52:55] happened of course in Gaza a couple
[2:52:57] years ago and then the enemies just came
[2:52:59] at them in every way. And I won't go
[2:53:02] into those things but we know there is a
[2:53:03] myriad of miracles in 2025 from Lebanon
[2:53:07] to Iran to Syria. The kidnapper or the
[2:53:10] um the ones that were kidnapped to bring
[2:53:13] them home. And so we know that time is
[2:53:15] short. Brother Nathaniel is reminding us
[2:53:17] they're calling for to make Aaliyah
[2:53:21] a very uh diligent and great effort to
[2:53:25] bring the Israelites home. We know
[2:53:26] there's 144,000. We know time is short.
[2:53:29] So we just want to do like the brothers
[2:53:31] have reminded us. The Rams say we're not
[2:53:34] playing church anymore. And so we just
[2:53:35] want to line right up the best we can.
[2:53:37] Revelations 3 we all know reminds us to
[2:53:39] be zealous and repent. So I just want to
[2:53:42] exhort each one to turn from the world
[2:53:43] to sin. P pursue Christ passionately
[2:53:46] with everything that we are. Don't want
[2:53:48] to be lukewarm. Those will get spit out.
[2:53:50] But but we want to be on fire for the
[2:53:52] Lord. Amen. Saints
[2:53:55] John 3 tells us Jesus answered and said,
[2:53:59] "Verily I say unto thee, except a man be
[2:54:02] born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
[2:54:04] God." And so that's for you, our
[2:54:06] children, and each one. We just want to
[2:54:07] encourage them that way. We raise them
[2:54:09] up, but um we teach Sunday school on
[2:54:12] these things and surprising sometimes.
[2:54:14] They just need a little encouragement.
[2:54:16] They've been around these things, but
[2:54:18] maybe not have that experience. And we
[2:54:19] just want that for each one. So, God
[2:54:21] bless you. Going to read a couple of
[2:54:23] quotes real quick like if we could.
[2:54:26] You've heard these recently. Just when
[2:54:28] we come across something the pastor says
[2:54:30] or these things, we uh try to capture
[2:54:32] them in our phones and things. So,
[2:54:34] you've heard them all before. Just a
[2:54:35] real quick reminder on a real leader.
[2:54:37] This one my brother uh sent and we sent
[2:54:39] to the board the other day. Brother
[2:54:41] Brandham saying these warriors
[2:54:44] that was in David stayed right by his
[2:54:47] side. That would have been difficult to
[2:54:48] do when you seen him falter a little bit
[2:54:51] but they stayed by his side. If
[2:54:53] Philistine came up he had to fight
[2:54:54] whoever it was they were picked on every
[2:54:56] side. Poor David in his mind all
[2:54:58] confused. He thought how can it be Lord?
[2:55:01] You know leaders sometimes listen up
[2:55:03] here saints. This is brother Brandham
[2:55:05] speaking. Leaders sometimes go through
[2:55:07] things a congregation don't know what
[2:55:09] they're going through.
[2:55:11] When you think of promises God has made
[2:55:13] them, why don't it come to pass? They
[2:55:16] don't tell their congregation. They
[2:55:18] don't tell the people they associate
[2:55:19] with. But there's many flusterations in
[2:55:22] the heart of a real leader. There's a
[2:55:24] real leader behind me. I wouldn't want
[2:55:26] his position for anything, but we're
[2:55:28] happy to serve and put our shoulders to
[2:55:30] the will with him. Another one uh we
[2:55:33] came across the other day, be perfect.
[2:55:36] Said, "Be ye therefore perfect even as
[2:55:38] heavenly father is perfect." How can you
[2:55:40] be when it's not my perfection? It's not
[2:55:42] your perfection. It's his perfection of
[2:55:45] his word. He chose you. You never chose
[2:55:47] him and he brought you into Christ and
[2:55:49] you are secured with Jesus Christ. Just
[2:55:51] perfect as Christ was before God.
[2:55:55] For you're not standing with your own.
[2:55:57] You're standing in him with one thing. I
[2:56:00] believe God. Oh, I love him. Oh my. On
[2:56:03] the other side of Eden. Amen. What a
[2:56:04] wonderful time be someday. You look back
[2:56:06] down and say, "What did I fear? Look at
[2:56:09] the joy I missed." We don't miss the
[2:56:12] joy, saints. Young man, young woman this
[2:56:14] morning. Old man, never been a
[2:56:16] Christian. God continually knocked at
[2:56:18] your heart. Oh yes, you might come in at
[2:56:20] the end of the road, but you'll have no
[2:56:22] joy. There'll be no stars in your round
[2:56:24] to shine. I don't want to stand like
[2:56:26] that. I want to hear him say, "It was
[2:56:28] well done, good and faithful servant." I
[2:56:30] want to show him my appreciation. That's
[2:56:33] a little bit about what we're doing here
[2:56:35] tonight s is just showing our
[2:56:38] appreciation. And then in the new year,
[2:56:40] just one more quote. I want encourage
[2:56:42] each one to be positive. This is for
[2:56:43] brother Joe. Sister Aaron does real good
[2:56:45] at this and a balance because I'm a
[2:56:47] little to the other side. So it's a
[2:56:50] strange thing.
[2:56:54] It's a strange thing that this is so
[2:56:56] much thought of. People, they say,
[2:56:58] "Well, I'm weak. My faith is not very
[2:57:00] much. I'm a not a very good Christian.
[2:57:02] That's just what the devil wants you to
[2:57:04] say. You're just talking his language
[2:57:05] right then. You mustn't never say that.
[2:57:09] Don't ever let your testimony be
[2:57:11] negative. That it be positive all the
[2:57:13] time. Know you've heard all these
[2:57:15] things. Just a friendly uh humble
[2:57:19] reminder. I'm the least among you. I I
[2:57:21] would say I don't maybe always act like
[2:57:23] it, but you pray for me. And we just
[2:57:25] love to serve you and appreciate each
[2:57:27] and everyone. God bless you.
[2:57:30] Thank you, brother Joe. Amen.
[2:57:35] Amen. God bless you. So, brother,
[2:57:40] um, yes,
[2:57:44] it must be time to go home.
[2:57:47] So,
[2:57:50] we have our good brother, brother Art
[2:57:51] Salceto from um in the Mesa area. He uh
[2:57:57] he's He serves the Lord very well and we
[2:58:00] certainly appreciate brother Art and
[2:58:01] Sister Annabel. They're very very
[2:58:04] faithful. Um between him and Brother Joe
[2:58:08] when I see them in in the building in
[2:58:10] the crowd, it just takes a relief off of
[2:58:13] me. If I just know they're somewhere
[2:58:15] around, they'll handle it or take care
[2:58:17] of it. And so I appreciate that about
[2:58:19] Brother Joe and I appreciate that about
[2:58:22] Brother Art. And um we've known Brother
[2:58:25] Art for many years.
[2:58:27] and he's been steady and faithful all
[2:58:30] along. He um sees things and what he
[2:58:34] sees he tells me. And so and sometimes
[2:58:37] it's not comfortable. But that's what I
[2:58:40] want to hear. I don't want to hear the
[2:58:42] smooth things all the time because the
[2:58:45] smooth things won't help us to grow and
[2:58:47] get better. And so he always says just
[2:58:51] FYI, he always, you know, has always has
[2:58:54] these FYIs
[2:58:55] [Laughter]
[2:58:57] But I appreciate brother Art and I know
[2:58:59] you all appreciate him and love him. And
[2:59:02] so as brother Art, would you come and
[2:59:04] share a few things? Word of the Lord.
[2:59:06] Amen.
[2:59:11] &gt;&gt; Appreciate you.
[2:59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sorry I'm the last one. I
[2:59:15] apologize. So um I just one thing I I
[2:59:19] will let you all know. Um the board
[2:59:21] knows this, brothers knows this, and
[2:59:22] just our hearts are here. And you know,
[2:59:24] one time before uh we lost our job, we
[2:59:26] applied for many jobs out here, but we
[2:59:29] didn't get one bite. So know that had
[2:59:31] the Lord opened that door, we'd be here.
[2:59:33] But uh in the meantime, every Sunday
[2:59:36] morning, every Sunday night, we're
[2:59:38] watching you all. So just know that. So
[2:59:42] um this is Shalom Tucson. We are Shalom
[2:59:44] Phoenix. We are all shalom, one pastor.
[2:59:48] And I'm thankful for brother Israel. if
[2:59:50] I uh had confidence in another brother
[2:59:53] like I did him, we'd be there. I don't
[2:59:56] have that confidence. God didn't show me
[2:59:57] that. So, I am grateful to God that um
[3:00:01] as brother Joe said, we have a leader.
[3:00:04] He's very humble about it and I'm very
[3:00:06] thankful for him.
[3:00:08] &gt;&gt; Can't Amen. I can't say enough I can't
[3:00:10] say enough of good things about Brother
[3:00:11] Israel. Um I appreciate his time in
[3:00:13] prayer. I appreciate uh his friendship.
[3:00:16] And the one thing I do want to encourage
[3:00:18] you all if you do have a problem, don't
[3:00:21] go amongst one another. Give your pastor
[3:00:23] a call. Say, "I got something that's
[3:00:25] eating me and I need to talk to you
[3:00:28] about it." Because that's what a
[3:00:29] pastor's for. Brother Ram said he was
[3:00:31] the ox who was a burden bearer. So, um,
[3:00:33] know that you cannot pray for brother
[3:00:36] Israel too much.
[3:00:39] Not possible. You cannot pray for him
[3:00:41] too much. You cannot pray for his family
[3:00:44] too much. It's not possible. Smite the
[3:00:47] shepherd and the sheep will scatter.
[3:00:48] He's got a goal and that's to take out
[3:00:49] the pastor. If you can't take out the
[3:00:51] pastor, he's going to work on his
[3:00:53] family. So where's our prayer need to
[3:00:55] be?
[3:00:58] &gt;&gt; You take time to take time to pray, you
[3:00:59] pray for him and then you pray for his
[3:01:01] family because they need it more than we
[3:01:03] do. Without him, where's the church? I'm
[3:01:08] not saying this to lift up a man. I'm
[3:01:09] saying it because of what God placed a
[3:01:11] shepherd with the pastor, right? that's
[3:01:13] where he placed him to be. So, that
[3:01:16] being said, what I thought I'd do, there
[3:01:18] was two points, but I'm only going to
[3:01:19] make one for you because I want to make
[3:01:20] sure that there's uh what can be said
[3:01:22] can be a help to you all. I'm not a
[3:01:24] minister. I'm just your brother in
[3:01:25] Christ. Yet, I thought maybe if I could
[3:01:27] share something that would be you can
[3:01:29] learn from my mistakes, but it's
[3:01:30] something that I see. It's in human
[3:01:32] nature. And uh when I first got saved,
[3:01:34] this as I started reading the Bible,
[3:01:36] this scripture jumped out at me and it's
[3:01:38] been my favorite scripture to this day.
[3:01:40] I appreciate brother Daniel saying his
[3:01:42] favorite scripture, but I found out my
[3:01:44] favorite scripture is actually message
[3:01:46] because brother Brandham said the most
[3:01:49] beautiful scripture. So I realized I'm
[3:01:52] in line with the prophet cuz he said
[3:01:55] it's the most beautiful scripture. And
[3:01:57] if you want to know where that's at,
[3:01:59] it's in the message lean not to your own
[3:02:01] understanding. He said the most
[3:02:03] beautiful scripture. And I was like oh
[3:02:05] praise be to God. God gave me the
[3:02:08] anointing and that's my favorite
[3:02:09] scripture. is the most beautiful
[3:02:10] scripture. What is that scripture?
[3:02:13] Thank you, my brother. I share that with
[3:02:15] brother Joe on the the board. I'm like,
[3:02:16] "Hey, no, brother. This is the most
[3:02:17] beautiful scripture." That's all there
[3:02:18] is to it. So, says, uh, "Oh, well, slows
[3:02:22] a heart to believe all that the prophets
[3:02:23] have spoken." So, uh, Proverbs 3:es 1-6
[3:02:29] says, "My son, forget not my law, but
[3:02:32] let thine heart keep my commandments for
[3:02:34] length of days and long life and peace
[3:02:37] shall they add to thee. Let not mercy
[3:02:40] and truth forsake thee. Bind them about
[3:02:42] thy neck. Write them upon the table of
[3:02:45] thine heart. So shalt thou find favor
[3:02:48] and good understanding in the sight of
[3:02:49] God and man. Trust in the Lord with all
[3:02:52] thine heart, and lean not to thy own
[3:02:55] understanding. In all thy ways
[3:02:57] acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
[3:02:59] paths. What I want to emphasize here is
[3:03:04] verse six.
[3:03:07] In all
[3:03:09] thy ways
[3:03:11] acknowledge him and he shall direct thy
[3:03:12] paths. Why is that so important?
[3:03:16] I think a lot of times as humans we do
[3:03:19] things based upon our passion, based
[3:03:21] upon our energy, based upon where our
[3:03:23] focus is at, our ambition, and we run
[3:03:25] towards that way. As a result of that,
[3:03:27] we get ourselves in trouble. Then we
[3:03:29] wonder why why am I in the why am I in
[3:03:31] this mess I'm in? Why am I currently in
[3:03:33] this mess I'm in? Did we take time to
[3:03:36] consult the Lord?
[3:03:38] Many years ago, I just had a a passion
[3:03:40] to go into sales. I don't know why. I
[3:03:42] just felt like I'd be good in sales. I
[3:03:43] had no idea why. And an opportunity came
[3:03:46] where um a dealership was like, "Hey,
[3:03:48] you know, I was buying a car." And he's
[3:03:49] like, "Have you thought about work, you
[3:03:50] know, becoming a salesp person?" I'm
[3:03:51] like, "Yeah, I'd love to do that." And
[3:03:53] so um quit my job and and I was going to
[3:03:56] go do that. And so there was this UPS
[3:03:58] driver who was a Christian and uh
[3:04:00] nominal Christian but nice man. And uh
[3:04:03] he said um he said I heard you're
[3:04:05] leaving. I said I am. He said where you
[3:04:07] going? I told I'm going to come back
[3:04:08] Toyota be a salesperson. He said you
[3:04:10] consult the Lord about that.
[3:04:19] Yeah. Um
[3:04:22] but it slapped me in the face cuz I
[3:04:24] didn't I just did what I wanted to do.
[3:04:27] And I started to see we had working
[3:04:29] crazy early hours to late hours. And my
[3:04:32] daughter, she was a baby. She didn't
[3:04:33] recognize me when I'd come home at
[3:04:34] night. And so I realized, wow, that's I
[3:04:38] didn't consult the Lord on that one. I
[3:04:39] just uh follow what I thought was right.
[3:04:42] I didn't miss church though. I went to
[3:04:43] church every Wednesday, every Sunday
[3:04:44] morning, every Sunday night. But still
[3:04:46] was affecting me spiritually because I
[3:04:48] didn't consult the Lord on it. Another
[3:04:52] one was uh recently is I had to have a
[3:04:54] hard conversation conversation with my
[3:04:56] boss and uh it didn't go so well and I
[3:05:00] was like man I flopped that one and I
[3:05:03] realized you know what I didn't consult
[3:05:04] the Lord on that one.
[3:05:06] Another time came I had to have a direct
[3:05:08] conversation with my counterpart and I
[3:05:10] called brothers. I'm like hey could you
[3:05:12] pray about this? I need to need to have
[3:05:14] a pretty direct conversation. It's not
[3:05:15] something I'm excited doing. I flopped
[3:05:17] the first time I prayed about it. and he
[3:05:20] prayed about it and I was like, "God,
[3:05:21] please help me cuz I I hate to have
[3:05:23] these conversations." But I had it and
[3:05:26] it worked out well. He's like, "Hey, I
[3:05:28] appreciate you coming to me. I uh I can
[3:05:29] take I can take feedback and I just
[3:05:31] really appreciate you rather going
[3:05:33] behind my back, you coming to me face to
[3:05:35] face." I was like, "I just that's so I
[3:05:38] am. I'd rather be clean before men,
[3:05:41] right? Because you got to realize the
[3:05:43] only Christ they'll see
[3:05:46] is the one with arms, legs, and feet,
[3:05:49] right? And that's us. Brother said, "He
[3:05:51] has no arms but mine and yours. No feet
[3:05:53] but mine and yours." So I want to
[3:05:55] encourage you all today is if you find
[3:05:57] yourself in a trial, ask yourself this
[3:06:00] question. Did you consider the Lord
[3:06:02] before you did it?
[3:06:05] Did you pray about it before you did it?
[3:06:07] You know, when I'm with my wife, I want
[3:06:09] to consider the Lord when I'm with my
[3:06:11] wife. You know, if you wives have a
[3:06:13] heart have to your husband did something
[3:06:15] that bothered you. Did you consider the
[3:06:17] Lord to sit down before you talk to him?
[3:06:20] You children, before you go to school,
[3:06:21] when you put something on, are you
[3:06:22] considering the Lord about what you're
[3:06:23] putting on, what you're looking at, what
[3:06:25] you're watching? Are you considering the
[3:06:27] Lord when you pick up your phone?
[3:06:30] Do you pick up Do you consider the Lord
[3:06:31] before you come to church, or is it
[3:06:33] halfbaked?
[3:06:35] Do you consider the Lord at your job?
[3:06:38] You guys get what I'm saying?
[3:06:41] In all thy ways acknowledge him and he
[3:06:45] shall direct thy paths. I hope that's
[3:06:47] helped you. Lord bless you.
[3:06:55] Amen.
[3:06:57] Well, God bless you saints. We're happy
[3:06:59] new year to you. We thank the Lord he's
[3:07:02] kept us and uh we want to continue going
[3:07:05] forward. Last Sunday we played the tape
[3:07:10] um why I'm against organized religion.
[3:07:13] The week before that, we had our what we
[3:07:16] call a Christmas service. And um
[3:07:20] we just had one service and at the end
[3:07:22] of the service
[3:07:24] um I felt like the Holy Spirit came down
[3:07:27] so nicely that in that meeting. all the
[3:07:32] songs, the choir,
[3:07:35] all of the specials. And I read a quote
[3:07:38] that just blessed my heart over and over
[3:07:40] again where brother Vandom says that
[3:07:44] that um stargazer
[3:07:47] told him in commemoration of the
[3:07:50] greatest gift
[3:07:52] that ever hit the earth every so many
[3:07:55] hundred years the Lord sends another
[3:07:58] gift lesser
[3:08:01] in commemoration of the greatest gift.
[3:08:04] And he said, she said, "You're you were
[3:08:06] born at that crossing time. That's when
[3:08:08] I knew your birth and that great gift
[3:08:11] was there." And I just was meditating on
[3:08:12] that.
[3:08:14] And the service was so nice and a lot
[3:08:16] like brother Will says, you tried to you
[3:08:19] wanted to happen again. You wanted to.
[3:08:23] And so I couldn't get away from that
[3:08:25] meeting. That was Sunday. So Monday I
[3:08:28] came back to the church here and I
[3:08:30] prayed. I was sharing this with brother
[3:08:33] Nathaniel
[3:08:34] says, 'Lord, I would love to have those
[3:08:37] kind of services every time.
[3:08:41] What can I do to make that happen?
[3:08:45] Is there something that I can do or say?
[3:08:47] Is there something I can to am I in the
[3:08:51] way from that happening? And but I know
[3:08:54] his works, his ways are sovereign and he
[3:08:58] does what he wants to do when he wants
[3:09:00] to, how he wants to, and through whom he
[3:09:04] he chooses to. But I I was so grateful
[3:09:08] and so thankful for that. And I just
[3:09:11] feel like when the Lord blesses us, it's
[3:09:15] it's the proper thing is to come back
[3:09:17] and say, "Lord, thank you." Amen.
[3:09:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for another day to
[3:09:23] serve you. Thank you for another year.
[3:09:25] You've blessed us, Lord. You've been so
[3:09:28] good and so kind to us and he's blessed
[3:09:32] us in so many ways that we can't
[3:09:34] imagine. And so, it's the Holy Spirit
[3:09:37] working in all of us. And so, I just
[3:09:38] want to thank the Lord for his grace and
[3:09:41] mercy to us. It's been a a real trying
[3:09:44] year. A lot of pressure, different
[3:09:47] pressure. And when we're on Broadway, it
[3:09:49] was a pressure. This was a different
[3:09:51] pressure this year. But I really feel
[3:09:54] like the worship services have been some
[3:09:57] of the best worship services that I can
[3:09:59] recall. The songs, the worship, the
[3:10:02] praise, all of that. And I'm so thankful
[3:10:05] for that. And if I wasn't the pastor of
[3:10:08] this church and I was coming to the city
[3:10:11] just to to go somewhere where I can find
[3:10:15] um some rest spiritually, I I wouldn't
[3:10:19] mind I wouldn't have a problem coming to
[3:10:21] this church.
[3:10:23] Does that make sense?
[3:10:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, okay. So, you understand what
[3:10:27] I'm saying. I'm not lifting up this
[3:10:28] church. I'm just saying I'm so glad that
[3:10:31] I can worship the Lord in spirit and in
[3:10:33] truth. And then I just let down, open up
[3:10:37] my heart, and there's people here I love
[3:10:40] and trust and there's no funny nothing.
[3:10:43] And so I just appreciate each of you. I
[3:10:46] love you so much. And may God richly
[3:10:48] bless you. I'd like to go into the um
[3:10:51] the new year here just uh reading the
[3:10:55] scripture
[3:10:57] and um we'll take the scripture.
[3:11:01] I didn't premeditate this, but we'll
[3:11:03] take that Psalms 27 that I love so much.
[3:11:08] I actually read it every Sunday morning
[3:11:11] right from this pull pit when when I can
[3:11:16] and pray before I prepare.
[3:11:22] If you would stand with me, we'll read
[3:11:23] this all together.
[3:11:28] Brother Brandham actually reads this
[3:11:29] scripture when he preaches the rapture.
[3:11:33] Am I right about that?
[3:11:36] &gt;&gt; So who's the rapture for?
[3:11:40] &gt;&gt; So who is Psalms 27 for?
[3:11:44] &gt;&gt; Can you claim that tonight?
[3:11:46] &gt;&gt; How about how about claiming it this
[3:11:48] morning?
[3:11:50] &gt;&gt; Psalms 27.
[3:11:53] That's the bride scripture. All right.
[3:11:56] Amen.
[3:11:57] &gt;&gt; Psalms 27. Let's read it all together.
[3:12:02] The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[3:12:05] Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
[3:12:08] strength of my life. Of whom shall I be
[3:12:11] afraid? When the wicked, even my enemies
[3:12:15] and my foes came upon me to eat up my
[3:12:19] flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though a
[3:12:22] host should encamp against me, my heart
[3:12:25] shall not fear. Though war should rise
[3:12:28] against me, and this will I be
[3:12:31] confident. One thing have I desired of
[3:12:35] the Lord, that will I seek after, that I
[3:12:38] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[3:12:41] the days of my life, to behold the
[3:12:44] beauty of the Lord, to choir in his
[3:12:47] temple. For in the time of trouble he
[3:12:51] shall hide me in the pavilion, and the
[3:12:54] secret of his tabernacle shall he hide
[3:12:57] me. He shall set me up upon a rock. And
[3:13:01] now shall my head be lifted up above my
[3:13:04] enemies round about me. Therefore will I
[3:13:08] offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of
[3:13:12] joy. I will sing. Yes, I will sing
[3:13:15] praises unto the Lord. Here, O Lord,
[3:13:19] when I cry with my voice, have mercy
[3:13:22] also upon me, and answer me. When thou
[3:13:26] said, "Seek ye my face," my heart said
[3:13:30] unto thee. Thy face, Lord, will I seek.
[3:13:34] Hide not thy face far from me. Put not
[3:13:37] thy servant away in anger. Thou has been
[3:13:41] my help. Leave me not, neither forsake
[3:13:44] me, oh God of my salvation. When my
[3:13:48] father and my mother forsake me, then
[3:13:51] the Lord will take me up. Teach me thy
[3:13:54] way, O Lord, lead me in a plain path
[3:13:58] because of my enemies. Deliver me not
[3:14:02] over unto the will of my enemies. For
[3:14:05] false witnesses are risen up against me,
[3:14:08] and such as breathe out cruelty. I had
[3:14:11] fainted unless I had believed to see the
[3:14:15] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[3:14:17] living. Wait on the Lord. Be of good
[3:14:20] courage and he shall strengthen thine
[3:14:23] heart. Wait, I say on the Lord. Verse 14
[3:14:28] one more time. Wait on the Lord. Be of
[3:14:32] good courage and he shall strengthen
[3:14:35] thine heart. Wait, I say on the Lord.
[3:14:40] Let us pray. Our dear gracious heavenly
[3:14:43] father,
[3:14:45] as we've read these anointed words that
[3:14:48] were pinned by your servant, the sweet
[3:14:51] psalmist, King David. Lord, how you
[3:14:54] anointed him and you used him and
[3:14:56] inspired him. And we read these words
[3:14:59] and we've heard your word spoken tonight
[3:15:03] for many witnesses, Lord. And we stand
[3:15:08] here, Lord, to declare that we believe
[3:15:11] you with all of our heart. And we said,
[3:15:14] we accept you, Lord Jesus, as our Lord
[3:15:17] and Savior. That you are the King and
[3:15:21] the leader of our lives. And we
[3:15:24] rededicate ourselves to you. A fresh
[3:15:28] Lord,
[3:15:30] another anointing,
[3:15:33] a clearer direction.
[3:15:36] Oh God, we stand here and we declare
[3:15:40] that your word is true, Lord. And
[3:15:43] Father, we believe it with all of our
[3:15:45] heart. We confess that with our lips,
[3:15:49] that we believe your word with all of
[3:15:51] our heart. And Father, now Lord, I pray
[3:15:55] that every family that's represented
[3:15:58] here tonight, Lord, Father, may you
[3:16:02] cover them. May you bless them. May you
[3:16:06] anoint them, Lord. Oh God,
[3:16:11] we simply lay ourselves at your feet,
[3:16:14] Lord. We simply surrender our lives into
[3:16:17] your hands. And you, the sovereign God,
[3:16:20] will work the works. You'll do the
[3:16:22] mighty things through us as God above
[3:16:25] us, God through us all, God working in
[3:16:29] all of us. You're the father of us all,
[3:16:32] Lord. These are my brothers and my
[3:16:35] sisters. This is the family of God,
[3:16:38] Lord. And I want to serve them properly,
[3:16:42] Lord, to respect them, Lord, as I
[3:16:45] respect with respect you, Lord. And our
[3:16:48] love for one another, may it increase.
[3:16:50] made and grow. And Lord, as our brother
[3:16:53] read the quotation to never be negative,
[3:16:58] always be positive.
[3:17:00] Never let a negative thought come out of
[3:17:03] our mouth, Lord. Just arrest it in our
[3:17:06] minds, Lord. Anything contrary to your
[3:17:10] word. For your word is true. It's yay
[3:17:12] and amen. And we claim every blessing.
[3:17:16] We claim every promise tonight, Lord. We
[3:17:19] thank you for the old year 2025.
[3:17:24] We thank you for all of the victories we
[3:17:26] won. And Lord, we look forward to the
[3:17:29] victories that lay ahead the road. Lord,
[3:17:33] we re we receive it, Lord. We claim it,
[3:17:37] Father. And we just ask you to to bless
[3:17:40] each one. Bless this church once again.
[3:17:43] Bless the other assemblies in the city,
[3:17:46] Lord, in this state. We commit them all
[3:17:48] into your hands, Lord. We love you. And
[3:17:51] as we prepare to leave from this place.
[3:17:55] May your presence ever remain with us.
[3:17:58] Oh God, give us a burden in our hearts
[3:18:01] for the sinner here in this city. Give
[3:18:05] us a burden in our heart for the move of
[3:18:07] God in our lives. Lord, may we covet
[3:18:10] earnestly all the spiritual gifts. Lord,
[3:18:14] may we desire them. May we long for
[3:18:17] them. May we long for your presence to
[3:18:20] be with us, Lord. For in the time of
[3:18:22] trouble, you'll hide us in your
[3:18:25] pavilion. In the secret of your
[3:18:28] tabernacle, you'll hide us, oh God.
[3:18:32] You'll set us up upon a rock. You'll
[3:18:35] give us a revelation.
[3:18:38] And now our heads will be lifted above
[3:18:41] our enemies. We believe that, Lord
[3:18:44] Jesus. And Lord, we wait on you. We wait
[3:18:48] on you, Lord, for the rest of our lives
[3:18:51] is our prayer. Help us not to move
[3:18:54] before you or lag behind, but to be
[3:18:58] found in the center of your will is our
[3:19:00] prayer. Bless each one, we pray. We
[3:19:03] commit our ways to you, Lord. In the
[3:19:05] mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[3:19:08] ask it. Amen. And her church says,
[3:19:12] "Amen."
[3:19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love you.

[3:25:26] Jesus
[3:25:29] Christ

[3:25:34] a way
[3:25:36] so we can come
[3:25:39] into his presence

[3:25:54] blood? Through

[3:26:29] through
[3:26:31] the blood.
[3:26:36] You know friends, I I got to thinking of
[3:26:38] it, you know. I told dad the other day,
[3:26:43] I said, "You know, Dad, I was I've been
[3:26:45] streaming in a little bit." I said, "The
[3:26:47] worship here has gone up another octave,
[3:26:51] maybe two, maybe three." When I when I
[3:26:54] was when I was watching, you know, I
[3:26:55] just seen people are more looking for
[3:26:58] more of God. You know, there's more of a
[3:27:01] hunger. And so, that's something I was
[3:27:04] able to say to dad. I said, you know,
[3:27:06] but most of all, there's one thing I can
[3:27:08] say. I'm I'm looking to go home,
[3:27:11] man. There's one place I'd rather be,
[3:27:13] and that's home. I You know, I I think
[3:27:16] every one of us can agree tonight, but
[3:27:18] prophet of God said in 1964, future home
[3:27:21] and heavenly bridegroom, earthly and the
[3:27:23] earthly bride, he says, "There will come
[3:27:25] a time, people, we're not gathering here
[3:27:28] for in vain."
[3:27:30] He says, "We're not uh we're only
[3:27:33] waiting for that time."
[3:27:36] Brother Bram says it's very very late
[3:27:38] but Jesus is still very very near and
[3:27:41] his glory it's wonderful and his name
[3:27:44] shall be called counselor
[3:27:46] that city can you see it there is where
[3:27:49] the bride and the groom will settle and
[3:27:52] never again to you now if you think it's
[3:27:54] wonderful when we drive hundreds of
[3:27:56] miles to sit here and to feed on his
[3:27:58] word he called it just a shadow
[3:28:02] but what would it be when we live in
[3:28:04] that city with him. When I live nextdoor
[3:28:07] neighbor to you and when we eat of those
[3:28:09] trees and we walk down the streets of
[3:28:11] gold and we walk up the streets of gold
[3:28:14] and to the fountain and drink from the
[3:28:15] fountain, walk in the paradises of God
[3:28:18] and angels hovering the earth singing
[3:28:21] the anthems. Oh, what a day that will
[3:28:23] be. It's worth all. The road seems
[3:28:26] rugged. Sometimes it gets hard.
[3:28:30] But he said it will be so little. So
[3:28:32] little. What were the bad names and what
[3:28:35] were the things that they said? What
[3:28:37] will that be when I live in the city or
[3:28:40] when I see him in that beautiful,
[3:28:43] beautiful city of God? How many are
[3:28:46] looking forward to that?
[3:28:49] Every single one of us have loved ones.
[3:28:51] I've gone over there.
[3:28:53] The time is approaching and it's very
[3:28:56] near. And I just thank the Lord for
[3:28:58] being able to be here tonight. My I
[3:29:00] don't know where my wife went. She I
[3:29:01] guess was dealing with the baby. But so
[3:29:04] good to see you. We love you. You know,
[3:29:07] I remember back with brother Will. I
[3:29:09] used to hang out with him several times
[3:29:11] and you know, we'd ride horses together
[3:29:14] and I was little cowboy sometimes. I
[3:29:17] think I was a wannabe cowboy. But you
[3:29:20] know, I remember brother Will, he would
[3:29:22] be playing a tape on the way to go uh
[3:29:25] ride horses and he'd stop the tape and
[3:29:29] say, "Dylan, did you hear that?
[3:29:32] Maybe I need to play it again. Press
[3:29:34] play again.
[3:29:36] Did you hear it? Then pause it. Press
[3:29:40] plays again. Did you hear it now? You
[3:29:43] see, and I I thank brother Will for
[3:29:45] that. And I thank God for Brother Will.
[3:29:49] Where would we be without the message?
[3:29:53] &gt;&gt; We'd be lost.
[3:29:57] &gt;&gt; But the message is what will set you
[3:29:58] free. will set you free.
[3:30:03] Without this message,
[3:30:05] we are a hopeless people.
[3:30:13] My desire is to see lost come to know
[3:30:15] God.
[3:30:19] [Music]
[3:30:23] The hour is approaching, friends,
[3:30:27] where God is going to call us home.
[3:30:31] We got to be ready, brother, we got to
[3:30:33] be ready.
[3:30:36] Let's just pray.
[3:30:39] Gracious heavenly father.
[3:30:42] Father, how thankful we are to have been
[3:30:44] in your house tonight.
[3:30:47] Lord Jesus, we thank you for the year of
[3:30:49] 2025. And Father, we thank you for
[3:30:52] everything that you've done,
[3:30:54] Father, and everything that you're
[3:30:55] continuing to do, Lord Jesus.
[3:30:59] Father, I pray just now, Lord, as we
[3:31:02] leave this building, Father, tonight or
[3:31:05] this morning, Lord, and the year of
[3:31:07] 2026, Lord, Father, that you'd go with
[3:31:11] us, Lord Jesus. Father,
[3:31:13] everything that we'd say, Lord Jesus,
[3:31:15] everything that we do,
[3:31:18] Father, would you just move with us and
[3:31:21] go with us, Lord Jesus, and talk with us
[3:31:23] along the way, Father. Lord God, I pray
[3:31:25] that in the year of 2026 that you'd give
[3:31:27] us a revival,
[3:31:29] Father, down on the inside of the
[3:31:31] hearts, Lord Jesus. Father, the prophet
[3:31:34] of God says, "God, create in me a
[3:31:36] revival." Lord Jesus, make me the
[3:31:39] revival and make me to hunger, Lord
[3:31:41] Jesus. Make me to thirst after more of
[3:31:44] you, Lord Jesus. Father, create that
[3:31:47] what is needed in me.
[3:31:49] Lord Jesus, and I can say what a prophet
[3:31:51] said tonight, Lord Jesus, create in me a
[3:31:53] revival, Lord Jesus, make me the
[3:31:56] revival,
[3:31:58] &gt;&gt; Father, set us free, Lord Jesus.
[3:32:02] Father, just move in this church, Lord
[3:32:04] Jesus.
[3:32:06] &gt;&gt; Father, as the year goes on, Lord Jesus,
[3:32:08] would you just have your way? Have
[3:32:09] preeminence, Lord, as the prophet said.
[3:32:12] It's time that the word has preeminence,
[3:32:15] Lord. Lord Jesus, I I give you
[3:32:18] preeminence, Lord Jesus, over my family,
[3:32:21] Lord God. I give you preeminence over
[3:32:22] this church, Lord Jesus. We ask that
[3:32:25] you'll just move, Lord Jesus, like
[3:32:27] you've never moved before. Would the
[3:32:29] services get richer and richer and
[3:32:32] richer, Lord Jesus, with more and more
[3:32:34] of you, Lord Jesus, in the name of Jesus
[3:32:38] Christ.
[3:32:39] Father, as this year goes on, Lord
[3:32:41] Jesus, we ask you'd grant it, Lord God,
[3:32:44] if there's someone that's sick here
[3:32:45] tonight, Father, just touch them now
[3:32:48] from the head to the soles of their
[3:32:49] feet, Lord Jesus, in Jesus' name. And
[3:32:53] their church says,
[3:32:55] "Amen." Maybe we could sing that song. I
[3:32:58] want more of Jesus. You know that one? I
[3:33:01] want more of Jesus.
[3:33:04] More and more and more.
[3:33:07] I want more of Jesus than I ever have
[3:33:12] before.
[3:33:14] [Music]
[3:33:17] So rich so far.
[3:33:20] Oh, I want more of Jesus. So I'll give
[3:33:25] him more of me.
[3:33:28] I want more of Jesus.
[3:33:31] More and more and more. Oh, I want more
[3:33:36] of Jesus.
[3:33:39] Happy for and I want more of his great
[3:33:44] love. So rich, full and free. Oh, I more
[3:33:50] of Jesus.
[3:33:53] Give him more of me.
[3:33:57] Shake somebody's hand and tell them
[3:34:00] more and more and more the Lord
[3:34:04] [Music]
[3:34:10] and I want more his great love rich and
[3:34:16] free.
