[31:23] amen amen God bless you thank you
[31:27] musician and we'll get right into the
[31:30] word this evening I got to uh I got to
[31:33] hurry up this evening I was teasing
[31:37] brother Israel a little bit this
[31:38] afternoon about getting done earlier
[31:39] than him and so can't go long
[31:45] tonight but uh I did speak to brother
[31:47] Israel just briefly there this afternoon
[31:50] and uh sends his greetings to you and
[31:54] and uh had a wonderful Service uh there
[31:58] in uh West Palm Beach this this morning
[32:02] and he did a fine job I I uh said they
[32:05] were really receptive and and was a fine
[32:08] message that he preached and so I spoke
[32:11] to another Minister friend of mine that
[32:12] was down there and he' never heard
[32:14] brother Israel before and he said man
[32:16] that guy can preach and so and uh you
[32:19] know that's uh uh it's it's good it's
[32:23] good to get out like that and and he
[32:26] does US good and I'm sure he did them
[32:28] good as well so uh before we get into
[32:30] the message I owe you a couple of quotes
[32:32] from this morning and I said I'd read
[32:35] them to you so I'll make sure I do that
[32:37] we can pull those up the first ones from
[32:39] Blasphemous names and I was talking
[32:41] about this morning the hair coloring and
[32:43] this was not uh in any way to cast
[32:46] anything against anybody this was a
[32:48] revelation to me and that I had went all
[32:51] these years and just thinking one thing
[32:53] and then and then something else opened
[32:55] up to me in the message and so and
[32:57] blaspheming names uh brother brandom
[33:00] said uh and always he said I've always
[33:03] been accused of being hard on our
[33:04] sisters about wearing bobbed hair and
[33:07] manicure all over their face and stuff
[33:09] I've always been accused of being hard
[33:11] on our sisters he said it isn't that I
[33:14] got anything against that I don't say
[33:16] the woman isn't a good woman that she's
[33:18] some street walker or something that
[33:20] isn't my attitude but it's this when she
[33:23] puts on artificial on the outside it
[33:27] shows the a lot of artificial on the
[33:29] inside see he said we ought to be filled
[33:32] up with Christ because the outside
[33:35] always expresses what's on the inside by
[33:40] their fruits you know them you see and
[33:43] where Christ are to be in there and to
[33:46] be and to care for the God and to care
[33:49] for the things instead of so much
[33:51] artificial pump and you know Green
[33:54] eyelids and unhuman like and all that
[33:56] kind of stuff just don't go for it I
[33:59] don't believe the Bible does either so I
[34:02] like to be just what we are so I like to
[34:06] be just what we are and Saints that's
[34:08] always been that's always been my
[34:11] testimony I want to be what I am I I
[34:13] don't want to be something I'm I don't
[34:16] want to be one way when you see me today
[34:17] and another way when you see me
[34:18] somewhere else I don't want to be one
[34:20] way at church and in another way at work
[34:22] or another way somewhere else I want to
[34:24] be what I am amen notice he says excuse
[34:28] me he says uh he said notice now if she
[34:31] hasn't got any fingernails and wants to
[34:34] put uh some on if she hasn't got any
[34:38] teeth and need some haven't got an arm
[34:40] and you need one haven't got hair and
[34:43] you need some you haven't got these
[34:45] things that's different but when you
[34:47] pull out your real good teeth because
[34:50] they're just not as bright as they
[34:53] should be then you've done you've done
[34:56] wrong he said
[34:58] he said if you've got red hair and you
[35:00] want black and you go down here and
[35:03] color it black just because you done
[35:07] wrong amen now that's what the prophet
[35:11] said isn't it now that second one I was
[35:13] talking about was on ministering gifts
[35:15] and how that I never knew up until
[35:18] recently that brother Brandon said to
[35:20] pray for those nine spiritual gifts and
[35:23] so uh those were two areas where I I was
[35:26] making the point that we're always
[35:29] growing and we're always or we should
[35:32] always be seeing more we should always
[35:34] be getting more out of the message it's
[35:37] not a it's not a book of History it's a
[35:40] book of Prophecy and so miss the
[35:43] ministry explained brother Bram says
[35:46] this now in the book it's taught over
[35:48] there that God has placed in the church
[35:51] five ministering gifts first is Apostles
[35:54] prophets teachers evangelists and
[35:57] pastors those gifts God places in the
[36:00] church sovereignly so he he does that as
[36:04] he will amen so if he wants to place in
[36:08] the church an evangelist or a pastor
[36:10] that God does that
[36:13] sovereignly is that is that what he said
[36:15] Saints now those gifts God places in the
[36:17] church then when you become in the body
[36:20] of Christ then there's nine spiritual
[36:23] gifts that goes in every local body and
[36:27] and those gifts are that you're those
[36:30] gifts that you're to pray for to pray
[36:35] for the gift of speaking with tongues or
[36:37] the gift of interpretation of tongues or
[36:39] these other gifts that goes into the
[36:42] church pray for the gifts of healing and
[36:45] pray for the gifts of Miracles and so
[36:47] forth that's the ones that you that you
[36:51] pray
[36:53] for and the spirit comes on and works in
[36:56] each local assembly in the perfecting of
[36:59] the church now how many now many times
[37:02] we've misjudged that and went over the
[37:04] mark and so forth and that's what caused
[37:07] it but we expected if it if it wasn't
[37:10] that way I think there was something
[37:11] wrong with the program because Satan
[37:14] isn't trying to upset it you see so look
[37:16] we believe that and we and I believe to
[37:19] you methodists and Presbyterians here
[37:21] tonight I've seen many things since I've
[37:23] been on the Pentecostal Realms that I
[37:25] didn't agree with that's right I've seen
[37:27] plenty plent of them but what of it so
[37:29] brother Brandon made the example of how
[37:31] that they went too far with speaking in
[37:33] tongues and said it made it to evidence
[37:36] of the Holy Ghost that everybody should
[37:37] speak with tongues and he said we went
[37:39] too far but he said but what of it it
[37:41] doesn't change the fact that there that
[37:43] the that there is a real genuine
[37:45] speaking in tongues and he said and we
[37:48] are to pray is that what he just said
[37:50] Saints we're to pray for those
[37:53] gifts and I've been all 27 years of

[39:40] of Egypt and he said certainly I'll be

[41:06] you we'll commit it all into your hands
[41:08] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[41:11] the church said amen God bless you may
[41:13] be seated the title of the message
[41:15] tonight is a chance to make a choice a
[41:19] chance to make a choice and I I ran
[41:22] across this I've been preaching on Moses
[41:24] a lot here recently and uh uh this is
[41:27] probably the sixth or seventh sermon
[41:29] I've preached right out of this same
[41:30] little passage of scripture of Exodus
[41:33] the 3 chapter and and what caught my
[41:35] attention here was that Moses said unto
[41:38] God he said who am I that I should go to
[41:42] Pharaoh that who am I that I should
[41:45] deliver your people who am I I I'm not
[41:48] qualified I can't speak well I'm not
[41:51] able to do it and what what got me to
[41:53] thinking here Saints is I don't know if
[41:55] that would have always been Moses's
[41:59] attitude when you when you consider it
[42:02] he'd been raised in in Pharaoh's home
[42:05] he'd been raised as a prince he'd been
[42:08] raised knowing brother Brown said he
[42:10] knew that he was to be the deliverer he
[42:13] knew that what God had called he knew he
[42:16] was special he knew that he there was
[42:18] something different about him he knew
[42:20] that God had showed him that he knew
[42:22] that and he'd been raised kind of as
[42:24] we'd say it today with a silver spoon in
[42:26] his mouth he was a prince in a in a
[42:28] nation and and and it might not always
[42:31] have been his attitude he was educated
[42:34] he was smart he was intellectual he was
[42:36] taught in all the ways of the Egyptians
[42:39] and he knew that he was to be the
[42:41] deliverer and I'll tell you Saints
[42:43] anytime you get to thinking that you
[42:45] know something or thinking that you're
[42:48] special in some kind of way that's a
[42:50] recipe for
[42:53] disaster if you ever start thinking that
[42:56] you're capable of doing something your
[42:58] fall is
[43:00] coming see a little failure will tell
[43:03] you a whole lot about yourself a little
[43:06] failure will tell you a lot about who
[43:07] you are as a person and I had a young
[43:10] man it was uh the Lord was calling him
[43:12] to be a minister and he was talking to
[43:14] me here recently and he was saying
[43:15] brother George I feel like God's called
[43:17] me into the ministry and and and what
[43:20] should I do I said well you need to pray
[43:22] brother you just need to keep it before
[43:24] the Lord in prayer and I said if God's
[43:26] called you he's he got a place for you
[43:29] if he's got if he's called you to the
[43:31] ministry he's got somebody for you to
[43:33] preach
[43:34] to and the Lord opened a little door for
[43:37] him and he had an opportunity to go into
[43:39] a little church and and do some Bible
[43:41] studies and he said brother George I
[43:44] felt when as soon as I got done with
[43:46] that Bible study I said I ain't never
[43:48] doing this
[43:50] again he said I messed up so
[43:53] bad and he said but 10 the next week he
[43:57] said they called me again want me to
[43:59] come back and do the Bible study he said
[44:01] what was I going to do he said but the
[44:03] lord gave me a little something and I
[44:05] went back and I preached uh did that
[44:07] Bible study again he said and I messed
[44:09] up so
[44:13] bad I said brother that's probably the
[44:16] best thing that could ever happen to
[44:19] you amen what would have been what would
[44:22] have happened if he' went in there and
[44:23] set the world on fire and then he went
[44:26] back the next time and set the world on
[44:27] fire and the first four or five times he
[44:30] set the world on fire and what would
[44:31] have happened to him what might he might
[44:34] have started thinking he was something
[44:36] he might have started thinking he had an
[44:38] ability or he was a gift and that's the
[44:42] worst thing that can happen to you you
[44:44] got to fall on your face sometimes to
[44:47] realize that this is all in God's hands
[44:51] and if there's anything good about you
[44:53] and me today it's from
[44:55] him if a sermon goes good it's CA God
[44:58] blessed it not you can preach at the
[45:00] best of your abilities but if the Holy
[45:02] Ghost ain't in it it'll it won't go no
[45:04] higher than that first Pew right
[45:07] there so a little failure teach you a
[45:10] whole lot about yourself and we got to
[45:13] get comfortable with the notion that we
[45:16] might fail sometimes we might make
[45:19] mistakes sometimes sometimes things
[45:22] might not work exactly the way we want
[45:25] them to nobody wants to fail but
[45:27] everybody's going to
[45:29] fail now is that right Saints but it's
[45:33] how we react to that failure that
[45:35] separates the sheep from the goats wow
[45:39] now there's a quote it's not from the
[45:42] message it's for I think it was actually
[45:43] Teddy Roosevelt that said it he said the
[45:46] only man who never makes a mistake is
[45:48] the man who never does
[45:52] anything now is that right Saints if you
[45:55] won't sit around and never mess up you
[45:57] ain't never going to do nothing and that
[45:59] works for the Lord as
[46:01] well if if you want to sit around and
[46:04] not mess up you'll never do anything for
[46:06] the Lord but it's the mistakes that we
[46:09] make that help us grow it's the things
[46:11] we do wrong that teach us way more than
[46:13] the things we did
[46:16] right if you do something good that's
[46:18] all right but if you do something bad
[46:20] you're going to remember
[46:21] it it's going to be a lesson is that
[46:25] right Saints Wayne grety said you miss
[46:28] 100% of the shots that you don't
[46:33] take is that right if you don't ever
[46:35] want to miss a shot don't ever take one
[46:38] you won't miss any but you won't make
[46:39] none
[46:40] either I was since I was on this I was
[46:43] looking up these quotes uh Michael
[46:45] Jordan said this he said I've missed
[46:48] more than 9,000 shots in my career he
[46:51] said I've lost almost 300 games 26 times
[46:56] I been trusted to take the game-winning
[46:59] shot and
[47:00] missed I failed over and over again in
[47:04] my life and that's why I succeed he said
[47:08] think about that Saints now these are
[47:10] just secular people these are athletes
[47:12] and different people a great uh Teddy
[47:15] Roosevelt was a great man and these are
[47:17] accomplished people but these were
[47:19] accomplished people that learned that
[47:21] failure is going to happen failure is a
[47:24] part of success
[47:27] wow come on somebody right so we got to
[47:30] get to the point that we recognize that
[47:33] we're nothing and we make mistakes but
[47:36] we can't just throw the towel in and say
[47:38] I ain't trying no more we got to we got
[47:40] to get back up and say forgive me Lord
[47:43] and try me one more
[47:46] time yeah I didn't do right I didn't
[47:48] handle that situation right but let me
[47:50] try again Lord I I I didn't handle my
[47:53] family right but let me try again Lord I
[47:56] didn't handle maybe I lost my temper
[47:58] maybe something I come up short in some
[47:59] way but try me one more time Lord give
[48:03] me one more
[48:05] chance
[48:06] amen and we got to get to that point he
[48:10] said in influence of another he said I
[48:12] want to say this right
[48:13] now the blood of Jesus Christ is all
[48:19] sufficient you know what that means
[48:21] Saints the blood is all inclusive it's
[48:25] all we need
[48:29] see Christ never died for them serpens
[48:32] no no they were created being he never
[48:36] died for angels He died for
[48:39] Sinners he never died for holy people he
[48:43] died for Unholy and as long as you think
[48:46] you're holy he never done you no
[48:49] good but when you realize that you're
[48:52] nothing then he died he died for you
[48:57] I'm so glad that he had these attributes
[49:01] I'm so glad that the inside of God was
[49:04] these attributes that had to be
[49:07] manifested I'm so glad that he had a
[49:09] desire to be a savior he had a desire to
[49:12] be a Healer he had a desire to be a
[49:15] father he had a desire to be a son I'm
[49:17] so glad that he manifested those
[49:20] attributes cuz I have a desire that I
[49:22] sure need him
[49:24] now I need him in the power of his
[49:27] resurrection I need him in the
[49:29] Forgiveness of my sins I need him in his
[49:32] healing touch I need him as my savior I
[49:36] need him as my deliverer I need the Holy
[49:39] Ghost I need
[49:42] salvation I need Joy I need peace I need
[49:46] him tonight Saints I'm helplessly
[49:49] dependent on
[49:51] him oh God I need him in those
[49:55] attributes
[49:57] I need him key to the door Papa Cox
[50:04] again he said why don't you become a
[50:06] Christian he loves you he said brother
[50:09] brandom I'd become a Christian when I
[50:11] can get good
[50:13] enough I said I tell you what do Papa
[50:17] you look around to where you find where
[50:19] you can get good enough and then tell me
[50:22] where that place is I want to go to
[50:27] I said Christ never come to save good
[50:29] man he come to save bad man and when you
[50:32] think you're good then he didn't come to
[50:35] save you he come to save them that he
[50:37] knows are bad Christ died to save
[50:42] Sinners oh he died for me Saints he died
[50:45] for you tonight Saints lowed down good
[50:48] for nothing as my daddy used to say I
[50:50] was wasting good
[50:54] air yes sir I was breathing oxygen as
[50:58] somebody useful could
[51:00] breathe yes you remember I read that
[51:03] quote to you that if you got a belly
[51:04] button today you're in the same shape he
[51:08] said cuz if you got a belly button that
[51:10] means you born a
[51:17] renegade now this quote really brings it
[51:19] in perspective to me angel of the Lord
[51:21] he said the Bible said in these last
[51:23] days that there'd be a famine and not
[51:26] for bread and water alone but for the
[51:29] hearing of the word of God why would
[51:32] there be a famine for the hearing of the
[51:35] word of God look how much word we have
[51:37] today we got more word than we've ever
[51:39] had but yet there's a famine in the land
[51:42] for the hearing of it but there ain't no
[51:45] famine in the church for the hearing of
[51:47] it Saints that's right or there
[51:50] shouldn't be there might be a famine out
[51:53] there for it and when you look around
[51:55] out there there's very little of the
[51:56] word of God that you'll
[51:58] see but it shouldn't be that way in the
[52:00] house of the
[52:02] Lord and he said and the men would go
[52:05] out from the east west north and south
[52:07] try to find it and would fail you better
[52:09] get sealed in the kingdom of God by the
[52:12] Holy Ghost why you got a chance you talk
[52:15] about a confusing time it's coming let
[52:18] me stop right here and say it's
[52:20] here it's a confusing time it's a time
[52:24] where you don't know if it's a man or a
[52:26] woman woman now I could be a an
[52:30] animal used to be just two
[52:36] genders I fill out to get airline
[52:38] tickets to fly all over the country I
[52:40] got to check is you male or you female
[52:43] or you non-binary or other how is there
[52:46] anything other than male and female
[52:49] saints it's a confusing
[52:52] time it's a time where sin is being
[52:56] recognized as
[53:02] nobleness talk about a confusing time
[53:04] it's coming when the Bible said to be so
[53:06] close till it would deceive the very
[53:08] elect if it was possible is that right
[53:12] it's so confusing that there's very
[53:15] little chance that you're going to
[53:17] navigate each and every situation
[53:21] perfectly right very little
[53:25] chance at some Point as tricky as
[53:28] everything
[53:29] is you're going to make a
[53:32] mistake Let Me Maybe y yall wanton I'm
[53:35] gonna make
[53:37] mistakes I'm not going to navigate
[53:39] everything exactly right all the
[53:42] time I'm not going to have the right
[53:44] answer all the time I'm not going to
[53:46] know the right thing to do all the time
[53:49] but I like what does Paul said
[53:51] Philippians the 3r chapter if you want
[53:52] to turn with me tonight uh brother Joe
[53:56] made mention of this scripture in his
[53:58] prayer tonight Philippians the 3r
[54:02] chapter now
[54:04] Paul the 12th verse you can read the
[54:07] whole verse when you get home but the
[54:09] whole chapter when you get home but but
[54:11] but Paul was speaking here on this 12th
[54:15] verse and he said not as though I had
[54:18] already attained either were already
[54:21] perfect but I follow after if that I may
[54:25] apprehend that for which also I am
[54:28] apprehended of je Christ Jesus Brethren
[54:31] I count not myself to have apprehended
[54:35] but this one thing I do forgetting those
[54:39] things which are behind and reaching
[54:42] forth under those things which are
[54:43] before I press toward the mark of the
[54:47] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[54:50] in Christ
[54:51] Jesus so Paul was explaining how that he
[54:55] he was talking about the attaining the
[54:57] resurrection and he talked about how
[54:59] that he used to what he used to know and
[55:01] the life that he used to live and and
[55:03] how he used to be a Pharisee and the
[55:05] strictest of the Pharisees and and all
[55:08] of those things and he said he was
[55:09] scholarly and he had all this wisdom and
[55:11] he said I I had to count it all as lost
[55:14] that I might know
[55:16] Christ sometimes you got to forget
[55:18] everything you know to know Jesus he
[55:20] said and he said and then I I love this
[55:23] he said I'm not
[55:25] perfect I I I don't pretend like I've
[55:28] attained everything he said I'm not
[55:30] perfect he said but this one thing I got
[55:32] going for me the one thing I got going
[55:36] for me brother will he says is that I
[55:38] have put the past in the
[55:41] past I put the past behind me and I'm
[55:45] pressing on toward the
[55:47] future amen we got to get real good
[55:50] we're learning how to put the past
[55:52] behind us put the failure behind us and
[55:55] press toward Mark amen and and he says I
[56:00] I I can't help that I Stone stepen I
[56:04] can't help that I consented to it I
[56:06] can't help that I that I held the coats
[56:08] of the men that stoned him I I can't
[56:10] help that I persecuted the the Church of
[56:12] God I can't help that I can't do
[56:14] anything about it but I have put it in
[56:16] the past and I'm pressing toward the
[56:23] future I can't change that I persecuted
[56:26] the kingdom of God but I still got a
[56:29] chance to make a
[56:33] choice and I'm choosing to press toward
[56:36] the mark of the high calling now is that
[56:39] right saints Saints we can't help what's
[56:42] going on in the past every one of your
[56:45] lives every one of our Lives is filled
[56:47] with trials it's filled with failures no
[56:50] doubt it's filled with hard battles
[56:52] there's been so much things go on so
[56:54] many miles under so much much waters
[56:56] went down the river there's been so many
[56:58] trials think back across your life at
[57:01] everything that God has brought you
[57:02] through church problems and family
[57:05] problems and personal problems and
[57:08] mental problems spiritual problems
[57:10] health problems look all the things that
[57:13] God's brought and you can't change one
[57:15] of them amen but you can put the past in
[57:18] the past and press toward the
[57:23] Future come on tonight somebody
[57:26] I'm working hard up
[57:29] here too many all you that ate too
[57:37] much now speaking about Moses in our
[57:40] opening scripture brother brandom said
[57:41] that Moses had been a bitter
[57:44] failure but he was always born to be the
[57:47] deliverer when he was a failure he was
[57:51] still the
[57:52] deliverer when when when when when he
[57:54] was a young man raised in faith Ro's
[57:56] Palace he was still the
[57:59] deliverer when when when he was rejected
[58:01] when when he thought when he thought his
[58:03] brothers would understand and they
[58:05] didn't understand and he became rejected
[58:07] and he slew the Egyptian he was still
[58:09] the
[58:11] deliverer now is that right Saints when
[58:14] when he was an outcast when he was on
[58:15] the run from the law he was still the
[58:18] deliverer when he sat on the back side
[58:21] of the desert watching sheep for 40
[58:23] years he was still the deliverer
[58:28] amen when the Lord commanded him to go
[58:30] back and he doubted and said I'm not
[58:32] able I'm not good enough I can't talk
[58:34] good enough he was still the deliverer
[58:38] amen even when he messed up he was still
[58:42] the
[58:43] deliverer when he was on the back side
[58:45] of the desert an 80y old man weak sickly
[58:48] in his body he was still the
[58:52] deliverer and today we're the
[58:54] predestinated Bride of Jesus Christ is
[58:58] that right Saints you're and you're the
[59:00] bride say Amen to that you are the bride
[59:05] tonight and when you was coming up and
[59:07] when you was doing whatever you was
[59:08] doing you were still the
[59:10] bride when you fail you were still the
[59:12] bride when you when you made mistakes
[59:15] you were still the
[59:20] bride amen come on brother Rick yes
[59:26] brother Rick didn't eat too
[59:30] much oh God when you turn left and you
[59:34] should have turned right you were still
[59:36] the
[59:36] bride when when you lost your temper
[59:39] that time and you didn't handle
[59:40] something the way you should have you
[59:42] were still the bride when you mishandled
[59:45] a matter at work or at home or at church
[59:47] you were still the bride when when you
[59:50] wasn't your best day when it wasn't your
[59:52] finest hour when it wasn't the best time
[59:55] you ever had you were still the
[59:59] bride oh when you were lazy or selfish
[1:00:02] or bitter or angry you were still the
[1:00:06] bride when you didn't put your best foot
[1:00:09] forward for your family you were still
[1:00:11] the
[1:00:13] bride because you always was the bride
[1:00:16] before the foundation of the
[1:00:21] world and even though we're
[1:00:23] predestinated we still got to make a
[1:00:25] choice
[1:00:26] tonight because he put us here that
[1:00:29] way thirsting for
[1:00:32] Life brother Brown said if we had been
[1:00:34] brought to this place by the grace of
[1:00:38] God we're free moral agents to make a
[1:00:44] choice and if the holy spirit that
[1:00:47] brewed us from the earth and starts to
[1:00:50] brood brooding to our hearts and we
[1:00:53] accept him and brood back to him how
[1:00:56] much more is he able to raise us up in
[1:01:00] the last days when we got a chance to
[1:01:04] make a choice we got a chance to make a
[1:01:09] choice he said so it could only be
[1:01:12] through the brooding of the Holy Spirit
[1:01:15] that's how life comes that's it's by the
[1:01:18] Holy Spirit therefore you can only have
[1:01:21] life by the Holy Spirit that's why Jesus
[1:01:24] said except a man man be born again he
[1:01:27] can in no wise see the Kingdom of
[1:01:30] Heaven he goes on in this quote to say
[1:01:33] many will come in that day saying
[1:01:35] haven't I cast out devils in your name
[1:01:37] haven't I done many mighty works in your
[1:01:39] name and he said Jesus will say depart
[1:01:41] from me you workers of iniquity I never
[1:01:43] knew you he said they say they did it
[1:01:47] but they never did it he said how can
[1:01:49] somebody write a check out of my bank
[1:01:51] account and I don't know about it
[1:01:57] come on somebody if money's missing you
[1:02:00] know it he said they didn't do it they
[1:02:02] was carnal in some kind of way and he
[1:02:05] said we're set here as free m agents and
[1:02:10] and we go along through life and we do
[1:02:12] what we do I went 21 years in my life
[1:02:16] and never stepped foot into a church I
[1:02:18] went 21 years in my life and never
[1:02:21] opened a Bible I went 21 years and did
[1:02:24] what I did and I did everything I was
[1:02:26] big enough and some things that I wasn't
[1:02:28] big enough
[1:02:30] to but one day he said the Holy Spirit
[1:02:34] begins to brood over us and he said it
[1:02:38] Broods over you and it it begins to deal
[1:02:41] with you and begins to call you to it it
[1:02:45] begins to call you and he said you have
[1:02:47] to accept that
[1:02:50] calling and that's the only way it said
[1:02:52] he can bring life remember it's not us
[1:02:54] that go seeking God it's God that comes
[1:02:57] seeking us oh we're blessed that he
[1:03:00] sought us we're blessed that he called
[1:03:02] us
[1:03:06] hlj blessed are they that do hunger and
[1:03:09] thirst you're blessed just to be hungry
[1:03:12] you're blessed just to be
[1:03:14] thirsty it's the Holy Spirit brooding
[1:03:17] life into
[1:03:20] you and it's a
[1:03:22] blessing just to be condemned amen so
[1:03:26] some some people do all this stuff and
[1:03:27] it don't bother them a bit some people
[1:03:30] do all this sin it doesn't bother them
[1:03:31] at all why did it bother
[1:03:35] you oh god oh there's a seed down in
[1:03:39] there oh there was something
[1:03:41] predestinated in there there was
[1:03:43] something in there for the Holy Spirit
[1:03:45] to brood over
[1:03:49] than and it dealt with our
[1:03:53] hearts it might have been after years is
[1:03:55] sitting on a church
[1:03:58] pew you can be raised in the message and
[1:04:01] not be in the
[1:04:02] message you can come to church every
[1:04:04] Sunday and Wednesday and not have the
[1:04:06] Holy Spirit in your life
[1:04:08] amen it might have been in an Alleyway
[1:04:11] it might have been in a gutter somewhere
[1:04:12] it might been in a service like this
[1:04:14] tonight but the Holy Spirit Broods life
[1:04:17] into
[1:04:19] you and you got a chance to make a
[1:04:23] choice you can say

[1:06:18] world we can live and still be in the
[1:06:20] message we got to get as far away from
[1:06:22] it as we can I don't want to ride my
[1:06:24] chariot on the edge I want to be over
[1:06:27] here on the wall amen I don't want to

[1:06:41] hot breath of judgment hanging on each
[1:06:44] side now swinging 1,800 miles an hour
[1:06:48] around or 18,000 miles an hour around
[1:06:51] and around the world and a sinful Nation
[1:06:54] with her hand on a button that can send
[1:06:57] us all the powder in 5 minutes

[1:07:27] [Applause]
[1:07:32] Lord he said the devil's blinding her
[1:07:34] eyes he said Christ declared himself to
[1:07:37] every nation and through every
[1:07:39] generation and he's doing it today the
[1:07:42] church nominal sets asleep the church
[1:07:45] spiritual is awake even if you ate too
[1:07:49] much you're awake tonight Saints Oh
[1:07:52] Glory even if it's Sunday night you're
[1:07:55] wake
[1:08:00] tonight he said the sleeping virgin is
[1:08:03] one off to sleep and that'll take the
[1:08:05] tribulation period but the one that had
[1:08:09] oil in her lamp is
[1:08:10] ready blessed be the name of the Lord oh
[1:08:14] Saints we got to get ready while there's
[1:08:17] a chance the door's closing the hour is
[1:08:20] upon us we could be powdery said in five
[1:08:23] minutes and the prophet touches
[1:08:25] something and I think many struggle with
[1:08:27] in the message he said don't wait for
[1:08:30] something big amen
[1:08:34] amen don't wait for something big be
[1:08:38] ready now he said the next thing is the
[1:08:41] coming of the
[1:08:45] Lord and and all through the message
[1:08:47] this one's got a Revival this one's got
[1:08:49] a Doctrine this one's got a a path that
[1:08:51] we need to go but he said we're looking
[1:08:53] for the coming of the Lord amen he said
[1:08:57] don't wait get ready
[1:08:59] now if someone ask you what you're
[1:09:01] looking for you tell them I'm looking
[1:09:04] for the coming of the
[1:09:11] Lord we're looking for a
[1:09:14] Rapture Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:09:16] day and forever he says I believe that
[1:09:19] by God's word I don't see one thing left
[1:09:21] that would hinder the coming of the Lord
[1:09:24] Jesus tonight now that sounds rather
[1:09:26] erratic but it's the
[1:09:28] truth he says all the prophecies
[1:09:31] pertaining to his second coming as far
[1:09:33] as I know is already fulfilled waiting
[1:09:36] for his coming so what kind of people
[1:09:38] should we be alert and ready at any
[1:09:43] minute for his
[1:09:45] appearing Saints when this stuff starts
[1:09:47] happening that work is going to be so
[1:09:49] short so quick amen amen that you're
[1:09:53] going to have to be ready just to see it
[1:09:55] amen that's right amen don't think I'm
[1:09:59] going to get ready when that happens

[1:10:03] that happens be ready now that you'll
[1:10:05] see it when it
[1:10:07] happens you're going have to be in the
[1:10:09] right channel just to see it
[1:10:14] happen oh God alert and ready at any
[1:10:19] minute for his appearing he said let's
[1:10:22] live in this meeting let's do this just
[1:10:25] as if this may be the last
[1:10:27] meeting the last Revival that'll ever be
[1:10:30] in Chattanooga
[1:10:33] Tennessee I've been
[1:10:36] there beautiful
[1:10:39] place they got dirt

[1:10:45] might be the last
[1:10:47] meeting in Tucson Arizona let's live
[1:10:50] like this might be the last Revival that
[1:10:53] Shalom Tabernacle will ever see he said
[1:10:55] we could be powder in five
[1:10:59] minutes I'm so grateful that the Lord
[1:11:03] provided a way through all my
[1:11:05] mistakes I'm so grateful that this isn't
[1:11:08] complicated I'm not smart enough for
[1:11:11] this to be complicated I if it was
[1:11:14] complicated I'd never make it Saints it
[1:11:17] it doesn't take understanding some great
[1:11:19] mystery or somebody's complicated
[1:11:22] Revelation I don't like mystery
[1:11:24] preaching cuz when they get done it's
[1:11:26] still a mystery to
[1:11:30] me I like a simple gospel when the
[1:11:34] prophet said it I understood
[1:11:39] it it's amazing to me how somebody can
[1:11:41] take a simple message and make it
[1:11:47] complicated it it doesn't take an
[1:11:49] emotional workup although I do believe
[1:11:51] in
[1:11:52] Emotion but I think we got too much of
[1:11:54] it in some some places not enough in
[1:11:57] others but it doesn't take
[1:11:59] that it doesn't take it doesn't take it
[1:12:02] it's not a it's a simple faith in God's
[1:12:06] word and to say I'm making a choice
[1:12:08] tonight to believe that word amen amen
[1:12:12] what else can you do but
[1:12:14] believe can you save yourself can can
[1:12:17] you make yourself see anything brother
[1:12:19] Chris can you give yourself a revelation
[1:12:22] he's got to do it all
[1:12:29] you can't deliver yourself you can't
[1:12:32] make yourself holy you can't give
[1:12:34] yourself a spiritual gift you can't
[1:12:36] place yourself in a body God's got to do
[1:12:39] it all we're depending on that tonight
[1:12:43] amen can the musicians
[1:12:46] come here's some good news for you
[1:12:48] tonight
[1:12:50] though there's nothing we can do about
[1:12:53] it we can't
[1:12:55] give ourself a revelation we can't save
[1:12:57] oursel we can't fill oursel with the
[1:13:00] Holy Ghost but the good news is
[1:13:04] this that's what he
[1:13:07] does that's the business he's in we
[1:13:10] can't heal ourself but that's what he
[1:13:13] does we can't deliver ourself but that's
[1:13:16] what he does we can't save our families
[1:13:19] but that's what he does we we we can't
[1:13:22] we can't we can't give oursel peace we
[1:13:24] can't give oursel joy but that's what he
[1:13:27] does and he's in that business tonight

[1:13:58] may already be already passed I don't
[1:14:01] know I I can't say that remember the
[1:14:05] people went right on having meetings
[1:14:07] just the same after the crucifixion of
[1:14:11] Jesus and he says and all the people
[1:14:14] they they'll come they they watch they
[1:14:18] they'll go right on preaching and saying
[1:14:21] they're getting saved and
[1:14:23] everything just as if the World
[1:14:25] continues on as it was they say but
