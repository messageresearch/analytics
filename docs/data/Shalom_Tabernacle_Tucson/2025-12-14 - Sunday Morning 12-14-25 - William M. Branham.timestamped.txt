[0:37] Good morning everyone. Can we all stand?

[0:49] another opportunity, another day, Lord,
[0:52] in your presence. Pray this morning,
[0:54] Lord, that we be seated in heavenly
[0:56] places in Christ Jesus. Lord, that you
[0:59] just bless the things that we're about
[1:01] to hear, Lord. Let them go deep within
[1:04] our heart, Father, that would bring
[1:06] forth the fruit that you desire,
[1:09] Lord. We look forward to that day, Lord,
[1:11] for an entrance into thy kingdom, Lord.
[1:14] And we want to prepare our hearts today
[1:16] that when we shall appear before you,
[1:19] it'll be with joy and confidence and
[1:21] full assurance.
[1:23] Lord Jesus, bless the Sunday school
[1:25] children in their class, Lord. those um
[1:29] things that would be done in this house

[1:33] Lord, and the um those that are on the
[1:37] way, Lord, brother Israel, as he would
[1:39] be speaking uh to those in in in Mesa,
[1:43] Father, and we just give you all the
[1:46] praise and the glory for it. [music] In
[1:47] the name of Jesus Christ, we ask. Amen.
[1:52] We're going to be continuing
[1:54] with what was the Holy Ghost given for.
[1:57] We'll start at the paragraph 32 and end
[2:00] after 55. This is going to be about 20
[2:02] minutes and so we're grateful for that.
[2:06] Let's sing only believe.
[2:09] Only
[2:10] believe. [singing and music]
[2:14] Only [singing]
[2:16] believe.
[2:20] All things are possible.
[2:25] Only [singing and music]
[2:27] believe.
[2:31] Only [singing and music] believe.
[2:36] only
[2:38] believe
[2:42] all things [singing and music]

[2:47] only. [singing]
[2:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. Brother
[2:54] Brandon,
[2:56] &gt;&gt; Christ poured himself into the church.
[2:58] Therefore, now watch, at that day you
[3:02] will know
[3:04] that I am in the Father
[3:08] and
[3:10] you are in me and I am in you. At that
[3:15] day you'll know it.
[3:17] &gt;&gt; For it's the whole thing is one plan of
[3:20] redemption.
[3:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. coming down that God coming back
[3:25] to live in and dwell with and commune to
[3:28] his people as he did at the beginning.
[3:33] Now then as soon as he gets his church
[3:37] in speaking conditions,
[3:39] gets his church to a place that he can
[3:42] flow himself through and love and
[3:45] persuade
[3:47] and fellowship.
[3:50] Then there'll come a Eden.
[3:55] He'll take his church back to where it
[3:58] left
[4:00] to an Eden again.
[4:04] There where it fell. It That's where it
[4:08] made its first start to fall. That's
[4:10] where it'll be taken right back with
[4:12] ever clean slate of redemption, bringing
[4:15] them straight back to that place again.
[4:19] The church has been in the world for
[4:21] some time
[4:23] and the church really after the
[4:26] reformation of 1500 years of dark ages.
[4:30] Luther was the first reformer to come
[4:35] forth after the round of the apostles.
[4:39] And then when Luther come forth, God
[4:42] tipped up a little bit of the spirit and
[4:45] poured it out upon the church in
[4:47] justification.
[4:50] And then in the days of Wesley, he
[4:53] poured out a little more of himself into
[4:55] sanctification.
[4:57] And as the age has grown on to the end
[5:01] time,
[5:03] God has been filling his church.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:08] Just look around and find out if that's
[5:10] truth or not.
[5:12] &gt;&gt; Look at the Lutheran age. You who read
[5:15] history, look at their revival and what
[5:18] they did. Look how much greater the
[5:20] Wesley revival was. How much more power
[5:23] they had but in the minority.
[5:26] Watch in the days of Pentecost. What a
[5:28] revival they had than.
[5:32] What a great wide sweeping to our Sunday
[5:35] visitor the Catholic paper give
[5:38] confession that the Pentecostals
[5:41] produced 1,500,000
[5:45] conversions in one year.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; I've done all rested churches together.
[5:52] The Catholic only change claimed a
[5:55] million and their own Sunday visitor.
[5:58] The paper called the Sunday visitor gave
[6:01] statement that the Pentecostals outrun
[6:05] them.
[6:07] And remember, Pentecostal conversions is
[6:09] Holy Ghost filled conversions
[6:14] in the minority to start with on the
[6:17] side of the alley out there with a
[6:19] little guitar and women couldn't even
[6:20] afford a pair of stockings
[6:24] laying out on the railroad tracks and
[6:26] picking up corn and mashing and making
[6:27] bread for their children. Well, what's
[6:30] it come to?
[6:32] &gt;&gt; The most powerful standing church in the
[6:35] world today.
[6:37] Not in the eyes of the world, but in the
[6:39] eyes of God because he proves it with
[6:42] what he's doing for them.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; He's pouring himself into them.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; Pouring it in.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; Notice now what taking place.
[6:53] God pouring himself into them. Now the
[6:56] church has got to a place from Luther
[6:59] Wesley and the revivals on to Pentecost
[7:02] and now into this age that we're coming
[7:04] now by the same Holy Spirit just more of
[7:09] it. Now when them Lutheranss back there
[7:11] got saved they got a potion of the Holy
[7:15] Spirit.
[7:16] When the Methodists got sanctified that
[7:19] was a work of the Holy Spirit.
[7:24] See, it was a part of the Holy Spirit.
[7:28] They without us are not made perfect,
[7:30] says the scripture. See, now
[7:34] God as the light has be to shine in the
[7:37] last days, he is expecting us a great
[7:41] thing from us.
[7:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:43] &gt;&gt; Because where there is much given,
[7:45] there's much required.
[7:47] &gt;&gt; So he's going to require much more of us
[7:50] than he did of the Lutherans of the
[7:51] Methodists.
[7:53] because we walk in a greater life with a
[7:56] greater power with a greater uh a
[7:59] greater
[8:01] witness than they had. Now we have a
[8:04] greater witness of the resurrection. We
[8:07] have things more firmer, more sure than
[8:10] they had.
[8:12] But it's just like I said to a Lutheran
[8:14] college not long ago. They said, "What
[8:16] have we got?" I said, "A man planted a
[8:19] field of corn. The first little blades
[8:21] come up." He said, "Thank the Lord for a
[8:24] crop of corn." Potentially he had it,
[8:27] but he only had it in the early farm
[8:32] by and by it become a stalk and a tossel
[8:35] come out on it, which was Methodist.
[8:37] If you'll watch nature, you'll see God
[8:40] working.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; There's a secret lines there that even
[8:44] goes with my ministry. See that watching
[8:47] nature see how it does what age and what
[8:50] time you see where you're living watch
[8:53] the age now then the Methodists they
[8:56] were tossles they looked back to the
[8:59] Luther and said we got sanctification
[9:01] you haven't got nothing in it by from
[9:04] that pollen from the Methodists come
[9:06] forth a grain of ear corn that was
[9:10] Pentecost
[9:12] there you are justification one stage of
[9:15] it. Sanctification, another stage of it,
[9:18] the Holy Spirit, another stage of it,
[9:20] Pentecost, Luther, Wesley, Pentecost.
[9:25] Now, what does Pentecost I liken it?
[9:27] Because in Pentecost, it brought back
[9:31] not a green leaf, not a tossel, but the
[9:35] corn cannot say to the tossel, I don't
[9:38] have no use of you. Or the tossel can't
[9:41] say to the the leaf, I have no use of
[9:44] you. Because the same life that was in
[9:47] the leaf made the tsel. The same life
[9:50] was in the tossel made the ear.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; And it was the Lutheran church that made
[9:56] the Wesley church. It was the Wesley
[9:59] church that made Pentecost.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; But Pentecost, what is it? It's a
[10:04] restoration of the same kind of a grain
[10:07] that went into the ground at the
[10:09] beginning.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. bringing back all the fullness of
[10:13] the power of Pentecost by the baptism of
[10:17] the Holy Ghost.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; See, in the last days,
[10:22] oh, it's a great thing to to believe and
[10:24] to look at. Now, in this age that we're
[10:28] now living, this age, it's beyond
[10:32] Pentecost.
[10:34] Pentecost has settled itself into
[10:36] organizations and started thinking whole
[10:39] lot about organizations.
[10:42] We are this and we are that. That's just
[10:44] nature. You just can't help it. It's
[10:49] nature. They'll do that. It's the plan
[10:51] for them to do that. But the church has
[10:54] moved on. It's gone into greater, more
[10:58] powerful. It's a restoration of gifts.
[11:01] And many Pentecostal people does not
[11:04] believe in divine healing, ministry of
[11:06] angels and powers of God. Many
[11:09] Pentecostals calls these visions that I
[11:12] see the devil. Many organizations won't
[11:15] even have nothing to do with it in
[11:16] Pentecost. See, we've moved beyond that.
[11:20] Just as Methodists call Pentecostal
[11:22] crazy for speaking in tongues,
[11:25] just as Lutheran called Methodists crazy
[11:27] for shouting. See, but it's all a coming
[11:31] forth out of the Holy Spirit to the
[11:34] great churches being filled up and chug
[11:37] full.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:40] &gt;&gt; Of the great powers of Almighty God
[11:44] until it's got to a place until the very
[11:47] works that Jesus done is manifest itself
[11:49] right in the church. Now,
[11:52] &gt;&gt; we're close, friends.
[11:55] Let me stop here just for a minute to
[11:57] get what God put the Holy Ghost in the
[12:00] church for. Give you another type. So
[12:02] what you'll know back in the Old
[12:04] Testament when a a child a man made
[12:07] himself a home he got his bride. That's
[12:09] the first thing. Then he become a great
[12:12] man like an organization. That was good.
[12:16] The next thing happened there come a
[12:18] birth into that home. That's when the
[12:20] Holy Spirit, see, another spirit came in
[12:23] which was a son. That son, he was not in
[12:28] full charge. Neither was he a heir until
[12:31] he got a certain age. And he had to be
[12:33] proved first.
[12:36] Yes. And then they had the law of
[12:39] adoption. To you ministers, the placing
[12:41] of a son is what I'm speaking of now.
[12:44] Then when he come to a place to where he
[12:47] was adopted, Jesus gave a beautiful
[12:51] illustration of it on Mount
[12:53] Transfiguration. As I said, God will
[12:55] never go outside of his laws to do
[12:58] anything.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; If you got an artisian well on this hill
[13:02] growing water all over the air and on
[13:05] this other hill over here, you've got a
[13:06] crop burning up, you can stand on this
[13:09] hill and holler, "Oh, water, run over
[13:12] here and fill my crop." Oh, water. Get
[13:15] to the my crop. It'll never do it. But
[13:17] if you'll work according to the laws of
[13:20] gravitation, you can water that crop.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; You've got a sick man laying here or a
[13:25] sinner laying here or a man that wants
[13:27] to be right. Can't give up drinking.
[13:29] Can't give up smoking. Can't give up
[13:32] lust and then if you'll just work
[13:34] according to the laws of God, let the
[13:37] Holy Spirit come in there, then he's no
[13:39] more his own. He He will stop that thing
[13:42] because the Holy Spirit takes him over.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; But you've got to work according to the
[13:48] laws of God, the rules of God. Now, in
[13:53] the Old Testament, when this baby was
[13:56] born, they watched it to see how it was
[13:59] behaved behavior. Then the father being
[14:03] a great businessman by this time, maybe
[14:05] in his 40s or 50s,
[14:08] he didn't have time to teach this baby
[14:11] himself. So he got in them days, they
[14:14] didn't have public schools as they have
[14:16] now. So they got what they called a
[14:18] tutor or a razor school teacher. And
[14:22] this school teacher was the best he
[14:24] could find so that he'd be truthful and
[14:27] tell the father the truth about it. And
[14:30] then when this boy got to certain age,
[14:33] say he was mature, if that boy was just
[14:36] a renegade, no good, didn't care for the
[14:40] father's business, all he thought about
[14:41] was flirting and running with the
[14:43] women's or or drinking or gambling or
[14:46] horse racing, that boy would always be a
[14:49] son, but he was never placed in position
[14:53] to have heir to all his father had.
[14:57] But if he was a good boy and he was
[15:00] about the father's business and he
[15:02] proved to be the right child, then they
[15:05] had a ceremony. They took the boy out
[15:08] into the street and put a white robe on
[15:10] him
[15:12] and they set him up on a scaffold so all
[15:14] the city could see. They made a feast
[15:17] and a jubilee. And the father then had
[15:20] the ceremony of adoption. He adopted his
[15:25] own son into his own business and then
[15:30] the son was co-equal with his father. In
[15:33] other words, if it been today, the son's
[15:35] name on the check was just as good as
[15:38] the daddy's.
[15:39] Now, watch what God did when his son was
[15:43] born. He let him go for 30 years testing
[15:47] him, trying him. Then he give him third
[15:51] three years of hard trial.
[15:55] And then at the end of the hard trial
[15:57] when he seen that his son was about the
[16:00] father's business, Mount
[16:02] Transfiguration, book of Luke, he taught
[16:04] Peter, James, and John three witnesses
[16:07] and went up on top of the mountain. And
[16:10] there
[16:11] God performed the laws of adoption.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:16] He they looked up and they seen Jesus
[16:19] and his clothes shined as white as the
[16:22] lightning
[16:24] &gt;&gt; and as the cloud overshadowed him.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; And a voice come out of the cloud and
[16:29] said, "This is my beloved son.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him."
[16:40] &gt;&gt; I'll sit down now and have no more to
[16:42] say. what he says is law and truth.
[16:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; Now the church has come through those
[16:50] schools.
[16:52] She married back a long time ago and
[16:54] become a denomination, an organization.
[16:58] But you notice the birth produced
[17:00] something else.
[17:02] And now it's got to a place to where the
[17:04] Pentecostal church with the new birth
[17:06] has been tested and tried. And now it's
[17:10] coming to a place God doesn't deal with
[17:12] the church as just an organization. He
[17:16] doesn't deal with the church as a a
[17:18] group of people. He deals with the
[17:21] church as an individuals.
[17:23] Each individual in the church and now
[17:26] it's got to a time and it's no secret.
[17:30] We all see it. When a man proves and God
[17:35] loves him, he takes him out somewhere to
[17:38] himself.
[17:40] there in the front of angels.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; He does something for him. He lifts him
[17:45] up there in the presence of God
[17:48] &gt;&gt; and gifts him and fills him and sets him
[17:52] out.
[17:54] &gt;&gt; That's the age that we're living in.
[17:57] Same Holy Spirit that saved the
[17:59] Lutheran, that sanctified the
[18:01] Methodists, that baptized the
[18:04] Pentecostals, is now setting an order.
[18:09] the coming of the Lord Jesus when it'll
[18:12] be so powerful that body will come into
[18:15] this group of church that'll draw the
[18:17] rest of them from the grave. There will
[18:20] be a resurrection.
[18:23] That's what the Holy Ghost is for. What
[18:26] is the Holy Ghost? Without
[18:28] us, they cannot be made perfect. They
[18:32] lived in one day. Under that, we live in
[18:34] another day. When the enemy comes in
[18:37] like a flood, I'll the spirit of God
[18:39] will raise a standard against it. See,
[18:42] we're in a day now back there that
[18:44] wasn't half as smart as the day they
[18:46] could make an atomic bomb or an
[18:47] automobile.
[18:49] They didn't have science and things as
[18:51] we have now, but and things of
[18:54] mysterious things to try to say man
[18:56] blowed together by some dust and so
[18:58] forth and take some analysis and try to
[19:00] prove it to make infidels out of people.
[19:04] But now when we need it, the spirit of
[19:07] God raises a standard. What is He's
[19:09] pouring in his spirit. Then those who
[19:11] are resting out down in the grave or
[19:13] under the altar of God as the scripture
[19:15] says are crying. How long Lord?
[19:18] &gt;&gt; How long?
[19:19] &gt;&gt; How much longer
[19:21] &gt;&gt; God's waiting on me and you?
[19:24] &gt;&gt; The church is waiting on me and you.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; Adoption time.
[19:33] And God can pour into us his fullness,
[19:38] his power, his resurrection, that when
[19:42] the church and Christ become so close
[19:44] together, Christ becomes visible among
[19:47] us and raises the dead and we go into
[19:50] the rapture. Now, we're going to say
[19:52] show at that just those who are filled
[19:55] with the Holy Ghost goes in that rapture
[19:58] for the rest of the dead live not for
[20:00] the space of a thousand years.
[20:03] That's right. Just Holy Spiritfilled
[20:07] people was all went in the rapture. Now,
[20:13] God gave the Holy Spirit. I got another
[20:15] scripture here in John 14:12.
[20:18] That's a very familiar scripture with
[20:20] all the people here at tabernacle.
[20:22] Verily, verily I say unto you, he that
[20:26] believeth on me, now don't let that word
[20:29] believeth kindly set you back in a
[20:32] nominal church say yes I believe. Sure I
[20:35] believe Jesus Christ is the son of God.
[20:38] The devil believes the same thing.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; Exactly. The Bible said he does. But the
[20:45] scripture says in John that no man can
[20:49] call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy
[20:52] Ghost.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; You've actually by the scripture, let me
[20:57] stop here just a minute before finish
[20:59] reading.
[21:01] You are not converted until you've
[21:03] received the Holy Ghost.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. You are believing unto
[21:11] the Holy Spirit has spoke to you and you
[21:14] publicly confessed him. The devil has
[21:16] the same thing. I believe him to be the
[21:18] son of God. So does the devil. But
[21:21] you're walking on towards you.
[21:24] when Peter had been called and justified
[21:29] by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[21:32] And in John 17:17,
[21:35] Jesus sanctified them through the word
[21:39] for the word was the truth and he was
[21:42] the word. First John says, "In the
[21:45] beginning was the word and the word was
[21:46] with God and the word was God and the
[21:49] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[21:51] He was the word." So he sanctified them.
[21:55] He said, "Father," speaking to the
[21:57] spirit in him, "I sanctify them to the
[22:00] word
[22:02] &gt;&gt; himself by laying his hands upon them.
[22:05] Thy word is the truth,
[22:10] just merely spoken into existence
[22:13] in the womb of a woman.
[22:16] Oh, totally impossible for him to be any
[22:19] other way than this word of God to make
[22:21] him manifest.
[22:23] I sanctify them. He gave them power
[22:26] against unclean spirits. They went out.
[22:29] He put their names in the lamb's book of
[22:31] life. And he sent them out. John uh
[22:34] Matthew 10. And gave them power over
[22:37] unclean spirits, cast out evil spirits,
[22:40] and do works and so forth. And they come
[22:43] back rejoicing. He said, "Even the
[22:45] devils is subject to us." He said,
[22:47] "Don't rejoice because the devils is
[22:49] subject unto you, but rejoice because

[23:00] through justification, move right on
[23:02] into sanctification. But where did he

[37:03] have it now, but we believe as a prophet
[37:05] told us that we are now sons and
[37:07] daughters of God. That it's not off in
[37:09] the future. It's not in the past, but
[37:11] it's here today that you're abiding with

[41:25] little Nolan this morning. He came in

[41:32] when this life is or I will fly away.
[41:35] He said, "Can we sing that this morning?
[41:37] Can we sing I'll fly away?"
[41:39] So, I may not have gotten quite the
[41:41] words quite right, but some glad morning
[41:45] when this [music] life is over, I'll fly
[41:47] away. Some glad morning when this life
[41:52] [singing] is over, [music]
[41:54] I'll
[41:56] fly away
[42:00] to a home on God's celestial shore.

[44:20] And when I meet the scoffers who ask me
[44:23] [music and singing] where they are,
[44:27] I say my sins are gone.
[44:29] [music and singing]
[44:30] Well, they're beneath the blood [music]
[44:34] on the cross of Calvary.

[44:39] as darkness is the dawn [music]
[44:43] in the sea of God's moment that's good
[44:47] enough for me. Praise
[44:49] [music and singing] God.

[46:04] There was in the blood [singing] on the
[46:08] cross of Calvary [music]
[46:11] as far removed as darkness is from dawn
[46:16] in the sea of God's [music] forgone.

[1:02:40] My my what a thought this morning,
[1:02:42] saints. So good to worship the Lord and
[1:02:45] think on these things this morning with
[1:02:46] each of you. Our visitors just want you
[1:02:48] to be right at home this morning. We're
[1:02:50] missing our pastor, [music] Sister
[1:02:52] Sharon, but I know they'll be a blessing
[1:02:53] and help there in Mesa. So remember them
[1:02:56] and their travels home today. He'll be
[1:02:58] here tonight, planning to be here
[1:03:00] tonight. So we just miss him and
[1:03:02] appreciate him and pray for him this
[1:03:03] morning. For Sunday school, we had 12
[1:03:05] children, nine Bibles and three
[1:03:08] daughters. We sure appreciate our Sunday
[1:03:10] school teachers and we want to remember
[1:03:12] them in our prayers too. Sister Elise,
[1:03:14] Sister Heather helps out. Joseph and
[1:03:17] Trevor have been helping out the under
[1:03:19] the older class. So remember them.
[1:03:22] For announcements, there's choir at
[1:03:24] three today. So if you have half of the
[1:03:26] singing voice, I think it's three. I saw
[1:03:29] a wife's
[1:03:31] uh wse a little bit. I think it's three,
[1:03:34] but we'll confirm that. So please if you
[1:03:36] can participate [music] in that be here
[1:03:38] for that today we'll be listening to the
[1:03:41] paradox this morning something that's
[1:03:44] unbelievable but it's true this morning
[1:03:46] brother John was singing my sins are
[1:03:47] gone it's uh the most great the greatest
[1:03:50] miracle so so thankful that tonight I
[1:03:52] know there's a temptation I've done it
[1:03:54] go out I get distracted and um I like to
[1:03:57] check on the parking lot and different
[1:03:58] things but let's just focus and be right
[1:04:00] in you know the word is so [music]
[1:04:01] precise it didn't say brother Chuck in
[1:04:03] the days of the seventh Angel, it said
[1:04:06] in the days of the voice. And that's
[1:04:09] what we get to hear today. And so it's
[1:04:10] for you. It's for me. It was timely. It
[1:04:12] was meant to be today for you. For me.
[1:04:14] So let's just hear and enter in and
[1:04:17] enjoy the word of the Lord this morning.
[1:04:18] God bless you. Let's sing.

[1:04:26] believe.
[1:04:30] Only [music] believe.
[1:04:35] All things [music] are possible

[1:05:01] Holy. [music and singing]
[1:05:03] He said, "All things are possible. Lord,
[1:05:05] I believe." Lord,

[1:05:32] [singing] Lord
[1:05:34] I believe
[1:05:37] all things are possible
[1:05:42] Lord.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; It's possible because Jesus is here.
[1:05:46] Confess it this morning. Jesus
[1:05:50] is here.
[1:05:53] Oh [singing and music] Jesus
[1:05:55] is here.
[1:05:59] All things are
[1:06:04] Jesus.
[1:06:08] Yes, [music and singing] Jesus
[1:06:10] is here.
[1:06:13] [music] Jesus
[1:06:16] is here.
[1:06:19] All [music and singing] things are
[1:06:22] possible
[1:06:23] for Jesus
[1:06:26] is here.
[1:06:30] Amen. You can be seated.
[1:06:33] God's voice. Brother Random.
[1:06:40] Now, the reason I was gone at this time,
[1:06:43] I'd had a week of fasting and prayer,
[1:06:46] which had led me to have a decision.
[1:06:51] And I got a little switch. You're
[1:06:53] supposed to be somewhere sensor censor
[1:06:56] what I didn't want. Oh, here we are.
[1:06:58] This is it. Uh, what want on tape and
[1:07:01] what you don't want on tape. So,
[1:07:04] brethren, if your tape's a little messed
[1:07:05] up, well, don't you can cut that part
[1:07:07] out
[1:07:09] now in there. That way, so many taken
[1:07:11] when uh brother mercenary and them had
[1:07:15] the only ones who could take tapes while
[1:07:18] I'd have them to censor them out there
[1:07:20] before I let them go out. But, u in this
[1:07:23] anybody can take them now. You see,
[1:07:25] anybody that wants to take them can take
[1:07:27] them. And so, I I have to censor myself
[1:07:30] from this switch right here. what I
[1:07:31] don't want to say or let go out over the
[1:07:33] tapes cuz there's some things I could
[1:07:35] tell you all here that certainly
[1:07:37] wouldn't want to get out with the people
[1:07:38] cuz let them alone the blind leads the
[1:07:42] blind they all fall in the ditch anyhow
[1:07:44] you see so just don't offend them like
[1:07:47] Jesus said don't offend them Pharisees
[1:07:49] said if they want some if they want some
[1:07:51] tribute money go down and cast a hook in
[1:07:52] the sea and get the first fish and take
[1:07:54] the coin out of his mouth and go pay him
[1:07:55] so don't don't offend them just let him
[1:07:57] alone but in all my life since I've been
[1:08:02] a little boy I've the Lord has always
[1:08:05] given me visions which we are acquainted
[1:08:08] with here at the church and I'm sure in
[1:08:10] the land where these tapes will travel
[1:08:11] also
[1:08:13] of visions
[1:08:15] and with this open Bible before me
[1:08:19] and before God who I stand I have never
[1:08:23] noted of one of them failing they've
[1:08:26] always been perfect
[1:08:29] and I had a vision a few weeks ago,
[1:08:33] about three weeks now that this coming
[1:08:35] Tuesday that drove me to my knees and
[1:08:38] out into the wilderness to fast and
[1:08:40] pray.
[1:08:42] And uh I put on venus cold, heavy
[1:08:47] insulated
[1:08:49] uh under clothes so that I to use on
[1:08:52] hunting trips so I wouldn't freeze up
[1:08:54] around there in my cave and in the
[1:08:56] woods. And I went up not someone said,
[1:09:00] "Well, Brother Brandham, did you go up
[1:09:02] to seek? You ought to went up to seek a
[1:09:05] vision from the Lord." I said, "No, you
[1:09:07] don't go. You don't do it that way. You
[1:09:09] can't pull nothing out of God." See,
[1:09:12] that's the reason people keep saying on
[1:09:13] the interview saying, "Ask the Lord.
[1:09:15] Just stay with just stay with it." I had
[1:09:17] a word of the Lord take to brother
[1:09:18] Neville about prophesying over everyone
[1:09:21] comes by this altar here. God told him,
[1:09:24] really call him down about it. See,
[1:09:26] don't do that. You'll shove him out in
[1:09:27] the flesh and then you'll have a false
[1:09:29] prophet. See, see, let him do just as
[1:09:32] the spirit leads him to do. See, don't
[1:09:34] don't try to pull nothing out of God
[1:09:35] because he can't do it.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; He'll only speak like Balum, the Harland
[1:09:39] prophet said, uh, I can only speak what
[1:09:42] God puts in my mouth. Otherwise, I can't
[1:09:44] say it.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; And that's the same thing. I like this
[1:09:47] system they got now. So, I can find out
[1:09:49] what just what the Lord would have do.
[1:09:51] That's very good.
[1:09:53] But Jesus went to the wilderness to fast
[1:09:57] after the Holy Ghost had come upon him.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; John bear record see the spirit of God
[1:10:02] come upon him and he was filled with the
[1:10:05] power of God God in him and then he went
[1:10:08] into the wilderness to fast afterwards
[1:10:10] not before for the Holy Ghost to come on
[1:10:12] him but he went in and fasted after the
[1:10:15] Holy Ghost came on him. See? And now in
[1:10:20] the vision, I might say this. I
[1:10:23] mentioned it once. I was going to cut it
[1:10:25] off the tape, but I believe I'll just
[1:10:26] leave it on.
[1:10:29] I This is about uh 3:00 in the morning,
[1:10:34] I suppose. I'd gotten up
[1:10:38] and I looked were in front of me and I
[1:10:41] was coming down to the Jordan. Looked
[1:10:45] like I was standing on the map of
[1:10:46] Palestine.
[1:10:48] And I was coming down to the Jordan
[1:10:53] and seemed like I could hear the song,
[1:10:56] I'm going down to the Jordan. Someone
[1:10:59] was saying it.
[1:11:01] And as I drew near the river, I looked
[1:11:04] back and seen which way I had come. And
[1:11:06] I was twothirds of the way there to the
[1:11:10] Jordan.
[1:11:13] And uh I looked across Jordan and I
[1:11:16] said, "Oh, praise God. Just on the other
[1:11:19] side is where all the promises lay.
[1:11:26] Every promise lays in the promised
[1:11:28] land."
[1:11:31] And then I came to myself.
[1:11:34] I thought, could I possibly have could
[1:11:38] it been
[1:11:40] that I was a dreaming?
[1:11:42] Uh because it's nighttime. See, a vision
[1:11:45] is something that you see with your eyes
[1:11:47] open just like a dream. You're looking
[1:11:49] right at it and you're you're conscious
[1:11:51] that you're standing like you're on the
[1:11:53] platform and you're you're standing
[1:11:55] here, but yet it look like you're in a
[1:11:57] dream. You can't explain it. There's no
[1:11:59] way to do it. See, it's God's works and
[1:12:01] God's ways are unexplainable. Amen.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; They have to be accepted by faith.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Then as I uh sit there a little bit the
[1:12:11] side of this chair, then all of a sudden
[1:12:14] hear it come back again. Then I knew
[1:12:16] then it was vision.
[1:12:19] And then when I come into the vision
[1:12:22] again, it seemed that I was lifted up
[1:12:26] and sitting on a a highway, a narrow
[1:12:31] highway with some brother. I never knew
[1:12:34] who the brother was. I looked around. I
[1:12:37] said, "Now I am sure and know this is
[1:12:40] vision. The Lord God is here."
[1:12:44] And seemed like everybody was afraid. I
[1:12:46] said, "What's everybody so afraid of?"
[1:12:48] And a voice came and said, "There's such
[1:12:51] danger in these days.
[1:12:54] There's a great hideous thing that's
[1:12:56] death when it strikes you." And I heard
[1:12:59] the weeds are mashing down and I looked
[1:13:01] and here come a huge monster snake
[1:13:05] crawling through the weeds. I thought,
[1:13:07] "Now, knowing this is vision, then I
[1:13:09] shall see what this uh this animal or
[1:13:12] this beast is." and he crawled up on the
[1:13:16] highway and as soon as I got sight of
[1:13:18] him I knew it was a mumba. Now a mumba
[1:13:22] is an African snake which is the most
[1:13:25] deadly bite of all things there is.
[1:13:29] There's nothing as poison as a mumba and
[1:13:33] the snake of course represents sin and
[1:13:35] death.
[1:13:36] And uh there is the the we have in this
[1:13:39] country the rattlesnake and the copper
[1:13:42] head and the cotton mouth moccasin. Many
[1:13:44] of those snakes that if you're in bad
[1:13:46] health and want to bite you, it would
[1:13:48] perhaps kill you. But if you didn't get
[1:13:51] aid of some sort right away and then uh
[1:13:54] then we go into Africa and India and we
[1:13:57] find the cobra. There's a black cobra.
[1:14:00] He's a bad snake. He's a death bite,
[1:14:03] too. And there's the yellow cobra which
[1:14:05] is far beyond him. And the yellow cobra
[1:14:09] uh the patient dies with such a horrible
[1:14:11] death that dies from suffocation. It it
[1:14:14] paralyzes the breathing system and they
[1:14:16] they can't breathe and just open their
[1:14:18] mouth and gapping trying to and die like
[1:14:21] that. And that was the type of snake
[1:14:23] with just one lick from getting Billy
[1:14:26] Paul when we got the snake in Africa.
[1:14:29] And then there comes the mamba. He's
[1:14:32] dead. Just when he he's so fast you
[1:14:34] can't see him. He goes over the top of
[1:14:37] the weeds and propels himself with the
[1:14:39] back of his tail. Just he's gone. Hits
[1:14:42] you in the face. Usually stands up high
[1:14:44] and strikes hard. And when he hits you,
[1:14:47] you just got a few breaths till you're
[1:14:48] finished. Turn real. It don't only
[1:14:50] paralyze to get in the bloodstream. It
[1:14:52] gets nerves everything. You're just die
[1:14:55] just in a few seconds. them native boys
[1:14:57] and track boys you can say mumble and
[1:14:59] they'll butt their heads together and
[1:15:00] scream cause it's death just in a few
[1:15:03] seconds see when one hits you and here
[1:15:05] he was on the highway
[1:15:07] I thought well this is it so I looked at
[1:15:11] him and he looked angry at me and he
[1:15:13] licked his tongue and here he come but
[1:15:16] when he got right close to me he'd run
[1:15:18] up fast and then he'd get slower and
[1:15:20] slower and just quiver and stop and then
[1:15:22] something hold him off he couldn't bite
[1:15:23] him
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; and he'd turn around on the other side
[1:15:26] and try to approach from this side and
[1:15:28] he'd get back and get a start and he sw
[1:15:30] right towards me get slower and slower
[1:15:32] and slower and then to a stop and I just
[1:15:33] shake like that and move back. He
[1:15:36] couldn't strike me. Then he turned and
[1:15:38] looked at my friend and away he went
[1:15:40] after my friend and I seen my friend
[1:15:43] just jumping way in the air over him and
[1:15:45] over him and over him trying and a thing
[1:15:47] was striking at him. I thought, "Oh, if
[1:15:49] it ever hits him, it'll be instant
[1:15:50] death." No wonder everybody's so scared
[1:15:53] cuz when this thing hits you, it's an
[1:15:55] instant death. And and he was just
[1:15:58] striking him like that. I threw my hands
[1:16:00] up. I said, "Oh, God, have mercy on my
[1:16:02] brother." I said, "If that serpent ever
[1:16:05] strikes him, it'll kill him." And just
[1:16:08] then, the serpent turned to me when I
[1:16:11] said that and looked at me again. And a
[1:16:14] voice came from above me and said, "You
[1:16:17] have been given power,
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; the binding,
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; the worst or any."
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Well, God, what must I do?"
[1:16:28] He said, "There's one thing you must do.
[1:16:30] You must be more sincere.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; You must be more sincere." I said,
[1:16:36] "Well, God, forgive me for my
[1:16:38] uncincerity and let me have sincerity."
[1:16:41] And when I raised up my hands to him
[1:16:43] again, there was a great something came
[1:16:45] over me. Just lifted me up. Seemed like
[1:16:48] it my whole body was charged with
[1:16:51] something. And uh I looked at the
[1:16:54] serpent and then he started towards me
[1:16:56] and he couldn't do it yet. And I said,
[1:16:58] "Satan, in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:01] Christ, I bind you." And the serpent, a
[1:17:06] blue smoke flew out of him and he curled
[1:17:09] up and made that sign like a S, capital
[1:17:12] S, made backwards, an and an sign. An
[1:17:15] means bind this one or anything below
[1:17:19] him because he was the worst. Blue smoke
[1:17:21] fell out of him and his tail choked his
[1:17:23] own self to death around his head when
[1:17:25] he made this backwards s that and sign
[1:17:28] like a conjunction you see. Choked it to
[1:17:30] death. And the brother was free and I
[1:17:33] went over and mashed on it. I said, "Now
[1:17:36] I've got to find out about this because
[1:17:37] it's vision." And I hit on the on the
[1:17:40] thing and it turned like that looked
[1:17:42] like a handle on a glass handle on a
[1:17:44] pitcher just made it solid crystal. And
[1:17:47] I said, "Think of that how quick that
[1:17:50] blue smoke was life and everything. It
[1:17:52] left it all the elements and it's turned
[1:17:53] to glass." And just then a voice came
[1:17:57] again and said, "You can unbind him
[1:17:59] also." So I said, "Then Satan, that
[1:18:02] [clears throat] I might know, I unbind
[1:18:05] you." And when he did, he started coming
[1:18:07] to life again, wiggling. And I said, "I
[1:18:10] bind you back in the name of Jesus
[1:18:12] Christ." And when he did, the smoke flew
[1:18:15] out of him again. And he choked himself
[1:18:17] right back again. It turned to crystal.
[1:18:20] And then when he did that, that voice
[1:18:22] said, "Now, you must be more sincere
[1:18:26] than what you are to do this.
[1:18:30] Then it left me and I was standing in
[1:18:32] the room.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; A few moments I heard the clock go off
[1:18:35] and my wife had got getting up. The
[1:18:38] children, you know how it is. I guess
[1:18:40] it's your house one. What am I going to
[1:18:41] wear today? Mama, where are my books and
[1:18:43] what did I do? You know, you just like
[1:18:46] any home. You can't hear yourself think
[1:18:49] hardly for all of them trying to get
[1:18:50] ready at once. And and so I slipped off
[1:18:53] into the den room and I got out on my
[1:18:56] knees and I said, "Lord Jesus,
[1:18:59] I don't know these things and what must
[1:19:02] I do?" And the children of me call me,
[1:19:05] take them to school in a few moments.
[1:19:07] What must I do? And I looked around and
[1:19:10] my Bible was laying there and I said,
[1:19:12] "Lord,
[1:19:13] if you will forgive me, I do not believe
[1:19:17] in just opening up the scripture and
[1:19:19] taking something out of the Bible and
[1:19:20] saying that, but there is times that
[1:19:24] when God can comfort you by such a
[1:19:26] thing, and I said, Lord, in this case of
[1:19:29] emergency right now before your spirit
[1:19:32] leaves me and I I don't know what to do,
[1:19:34] the kids will be an hour yet before they
[1:19:36] be gone. would you just show me if that
[1:19:38] was something you're trying to get to
[1:19:40] me, heavenly father, then
[1:19:43] let me know. And I took this Bible and
[1:19:46] just pulled it open like that and my
[1:19:48] thumb was laying at first Corinthians
[1:19:51] the 5th chapter the 8th verse. When
[1:19:54] something reads something like this when
[1:19:56] you come I was planning on taking a fast
[1:19:59] to the Lord. I told him I'd go out and
[1:20:02] fast. said when you come to this feast
[1:20:05] which a fast in the body is a feast with
[1:20:08] the Lord. We know that. So when you come
[1:20:10] to this feast, don't come with the old
[1:20:13] 11 or the leaven of malice and so forth,
[1:20:17] but come with the the unele
[1:20:25] truth. Just exactly what he told me in
[1:20:27] the vision. Come, God is my solemn
[1:20:29] judge. come with the unleven bread of
[1:20:32] sincerity and truth. That is the word.
[1:20:36] Then I seen what he meant as he years
[1:20:38] ago when I seen the Bible come down, got
[1:20:40] it wrote right here. Come down and a
[1:20:43] hand came from heaven and pointed down
[1:20:45] to Joshua and read the first nine verses
[1:20:48] and stopped there. That's Joshua
[1:20:52] come through the wilderness. But never
[1:20:54] did he was ready. When he got near
[1:20:56] Jordan, God call him out.
[1:21:00] said, "This day I'll begin to magnify
[1:21:02] you before the people." And then he took
[1:21:04] the children of Israel across Jordan to
[1:21:08] the land where give them divided to them
[1:21:10] the promised land.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; I went to the woods and prayed and
[1:21:15] prayed and fasted.
[1:21:18] And now
[1:21:20] I went back to that tree where I met
[1:21:23] where those squirrels was that you've
[1:21:25] heard in other messages. See where those
[1:21:28] squirrels was. And standing there along
[1:21:30] about 3 or 4:00 in the morning, Ed
[1:21:32] staggered through the brush for what
[1:21:34] light I could see to get to the tree,
[1:21:36] coming early because I was led there.
[1:21:39] Then I met him.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; God help me to ever live true.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read my text now.
[1:21:55] I have taken for a text this morning.
[1:21:58] Wrote down here somewhere here. Joshua
[1:22:03] in the book of Joshua the 10th chapter.
[1:22:07] To you who are going to read behind me
[1:22:10] are
[1:22:12] the 10th chapter and the 12th verse. And
[1:22:15] I just have one hour
[1:22:18] and then uh
[1:22:21] I think I'm not sure, but I believe
[1:22:25] Billy said he'd give out prayer cards
[1:22:27] this morning. So there wasn't very many,
[1:22:28] but just some people want to be prayed
[1:22:30] for. And uh anybody got prayer cards?
[1:22:33] Raise up your hand. I That's right.
[1:22:35] Okay, that's fine. All right. Now,
[1:22:40] the 12th verse of the 10th chapter of
[1:22:43] Joshua. And now remember now in the
[1:22:46] future next Sunday I want to speak on
[1:22:49] Christianity
[1:22:51] versus
[1:22:52] idolatry
[1:22:54] and then I'll tell you from then about
[1:22:56] whether the Lord leads on for the
[1:22:58] Christmas message or not. It seems like
[1:23:00] I have a message on my heart for the
[1:23:03] people at Christmas and then I'll tell
[1:23:05] you from then. Now beginning the reading
[1:23:07] at the 12th verse of the 10th chapter of
[1:23:09] Joshua.
[1:23:11] Then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day
[1:23:15] when the Lord delivered up the Amorites
[1:23:18] before the children of Israel. And he
[1:23:21] said, "In the sight of Israel, son,
[1:23:26] stand thou still upon Gibian, and moon
[1:23:30] in the valley of Agelon."
[1:23:33] And the sun stood still, and the moon
[1:23:36] stayed until the people avenged
[1:23:39] themselves upon their enemies. Is not
[1:23:43] this written in the book of Jasher? So
[1:23:46] the sun stood still in the midst of
[1:23:48] heaven,
[1:23:50] and hastened not to go down about a
[1:23:53] whole day.
[1:23:55] Listen now.
[1:23:58] And there was no day like that before or
[1:24:03] after it, that the Lord
[1:24:07] hearkened unto the voice of a man.
[1:24:11] For the Lord
[1:24:13] fought for Israel, and Joshua
[1:24:17] returned and all Israel with him unto
[1:24:20] the camp at Gilgal.
[1:24:24] May God add his blessings to his word.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Now I wish if it be the will of the Lord
[1:24:34] that you carry with me for a few
[1:24:37] minutes. I want to take a subject
[1:24:42] strange odd upon reading such a
[1:24:44] scripture
[1:24:47] and I want your attention and and prayer
[1:24:52] during this time.
[1:24:55] I want to take the subject of one word
[1:24:59] paradox
[1:25:03] and first I'd like to explain maybe what
[1:25:06] a paradox is.
[1:25:12] In the Webster's dictionary it says that
[1:25:14] a paradox means something that's
[1:25:18] incredible but true.
[1:25:21] That is a paradox.
[1:25:24] something that's almost completely out
[1:25:26] of reason
[1:25:28] couldn't be so but yet it is. That's a
[1:25:32] paradox.
[1:25:34] Now I want to rest a few minutes on
[1:25:36] these words
[1:25:38] a paradox.
[1:25:41] Now we have many things that we could
[1:25:43] refer to as paradox.
[1:25:47] One thing that I would like to refer to
[1:25:50] is this world itself is a paradox.
[1:25:54] Its standing is a paradox.
[1:25:59] Last night I was talking to my daughter
[1:26:02] Rebecca that's in high school
[1:26:06] and I was studying here in the scripture
[1:26:09] and and was telling her about reading
[1:26:12] this uh this verse here
[1:26:16] and she said, "Daddy, Joshua actually
[1:26:19] stopped the world, didn't he?"
[1:26:23] I said, "I don't know why he stopped. He
[1:26:26] stopped the sun. She said he could not
[1:26:29] stop the sun because the sun doesn't
[1:26:32] travel. I said the reflection of it
[1:26:35] travels across the earth and he stopped
[1:26:38] that.
[1:26:40] She said, "Well, then God stopped the
[1:26:42] world." I said, "Then to the agnostic,
[1:26:44] what happens if the world happens to
[1:26:46] stop and lose its gravitation? It would
[1:26:48] shoot through space like a a star and
[1:26:50] missiles of it be falling for hundred
[1:26:52] billions of years in space."
[1:26:54] But the Bible said that the sun stopped
[1:26:58] and held its place for a whole day.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; It's unreasonable
[1:27:09] and
[1:27:10] incredible,
[1:27:12] but it's the truth.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Pray. Tell me then,
[1:27:17] which is the top side of the world, the
[1:27:19] North Pole or the South Pole? How do you
[1:27:22] know if you're in space?
[1:27:24] You say the South Pole's down under us,
[1:27:26] they think the North Pole's down under
[1:27:28] them.
[1:27:30] It's standing in a space
[1:27:33] and a little circle of air as it's
[1:27:36] turning some thousand something miles
[1:27:38] per hour causes 24 25,000 miles around
[1:27:42] it and it turns around 24 hours. will
[1:27:44] make it going better than 1,000 miles an
[1:27:45] hour of traveling around and it never
[1:27:49] misses striking exactly where it's where
[1:27:52] it's on the equator where it goes
[1:27:54] around. It never misses a minute
[1:27:58] perfectly timed standing in the air. If
[1:28:01] that isn't a paradox, I don't know what
[1:28:03] one is.
[1:28:05] How that it's all the heavenly systems,
[1:28:08] how they are so timed so perfectly till
[1:28:12] that in years that's to come 20 and 30
[1:28:16] years from now. Science can see the
[1:28:20] coming of the eclipse of the sun and the
[1:28:23] moon passing and can tell you to the
[1:28:26] moment
[1:28:27] when they will pass and when the eclipse
[1:28:30] will start.
[1:28:32] No matter how fine a watch that we have,
[1:28:35] one of the precision, I've got one here
[1:28:38] that was given to me in Switzerland as a
[1:28:40] present when I was there. The value is
[1:28:42] about $300 in American money that was
[1:28:45] given to me. There isn't a week.
[1:28:49] But what it has to be retired all
[1:28:52] clocks, nothing that man can make is so
[1:28:55] perfect.
[1:28:57] It'll in a few years it'll be worn out
[1:28:59] and gone. As it gets older, it'll get
[1:29:02] worse all the time. The jewels will wear
[1:29:05] down. The accuracy of it will leave it.
[1:29:07] There's nothing that can be ground or
[1:29:09] fixed out by man or honed out by man
[1:29:12] that can stay perfect, but this world
[1:29:15] stays perfect.
[1:29:19] What controls it?
[1:29:23] Well, you say, "I don't know what
[1:29:26] controls it. God holds it in its place.
[1:29:28] It truly is a paradox.
[1:29:32] It's you cannot describe how God does
[1:29:35] it, but he does it. So that's the main
[1:29:38] thing that he does it. And we know that
[1:29:39] it's so.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; It's incredible how that you could spin
[1:29:44] a ball in the air. It will not make one
[1:29:47] complete revolution in the same place.
[1:29:51] I was thinking here some time ago when I
[1:29:54] was in the desert
[1:29:56] and uh one of these little jumping
[1:29:58] cactuses that the acids in your blood
[1:30:00] will draw right to you. One of those
[1:30:02] fellas jumped on to me and you can't
[1:30:06] pick it off. You have to take something
[1:30:07] and rake it off and it's got little
[1:30:08] burrs on them. And no matter how well
[1:30:12] you sharpen a needle,
[1:30:16] a needle will be blunt on the end. The
[1:30:19] perfect sharpness of a needle will be as
[1:30:21] perfect as you could get it. It'll be
[1:30:23] blunt to one of those jumping cactuses.
[1:30:26] And yet it is a leaf itself rolled down
[1:30:29] tight.
[1:30:31] How could it be that nature could roll a
[1:30:35] leaf tighter and sharper on the point
[1:30:38] than a fine machine could grind one?
[1:30:42] And yet thumb down to the end of that
[1:30:44] point is little fish hook burrs. like
[1:30:46] that little verse to keep it to hold
[1:30:48] itself in as it goes. Oh, a paradox,
[1:30:52] right? To science.
[1:30:55] It's incredible, but it's true. I would
[1:30:58] like for someone to explain this.
[1:31:02] I cannot tell you exactly the miles or
[1:31:04] how many miles science says that the
[1:31:06] moon is from the earth.
[1:31:09] But how could that moon,
[1:31:12] I would say, standing millions and
[1:31:15] millions of miles away from the earth
[1:31:17] and yet controls that tide of the sea?
[1:31:23] What does it? How can it be done?
[1:31:27] It's a paradox. But yet we look and see
[1:31:30] that it's done.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; It happens.
[1:31:34] The moon controls the tides. When the
[1:31:37] moon rocks out like this on the earth,
[1:31:40] the tide goes with it. And God has put
[1:31:43] the moon over the tides and set the
[1:31:47] boundaries and they cannot pass that
[1:31:50] boundary. Where if God draw a line and
[1:31:52] said, "See, you can come this close,
[1:31:56] but you cannot take the rest of it
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; for I'm putting a guard over you."
[1:32:04] That moon
[1:32:07] millions of miles from the earth
[1:32:10] calls to that sea and it sets its
[1:32:13] boundaries
[1:32:15] controls it.
[1:32:17] Incredible.
[1:32:20] What is on that moon when just a few
[1:32:23] miles off the Earth, all gravitation,
[1:32:26] all air, everything else leaves, goes
[1:32:28] out into space where there's not even
[1:32:31] air for millions and millions and
[1:32:34] multiplied millions of miles.
[1:32:37] Yet,
[1:32:39] it controls it. Says you can go so far,
[1:32:43] but you can't go no farther. where I'm
[1:32:46] the [screaming] guard of God. I'm the
[1:32:48] watchdog
[1:32:50] that sets you here and you cannot pass
[1:32:52] these boundaries. Explain that. That's a
[1:32:55] paradox. How that God does that, but yet
[1:32:58] he does it. It cannot be explained.
[1:33:02] We got wintertime, snow on the ground,
[1:33:06] cold grounds freezing, a little seed,
[1:33:11] and in that little seed is a germ of
[1:33:14] life.
[1:33:16] And that little seed will freeze and
[1:33:18] burst open and the pulp will run out of
[1:33:21] it and that germ of life will be laying
[1:33:24] in the dust
[1:33:26] and a frozen sheet of ice
[1:33:30] and would kill any life.
[1:33:33] How's it preserved and then comes again
[1:33:35] in the springtime?
[1:33:39] Couldn't explain that, could we? It's a
[1:33:41] paradox.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We take Hebrews the 11th chapter
[1:33:44] and the third verse.
[1:33:47] We understand there that the Bible says
[1:33:49] Paul speaking that the world was framed
[1:33:53] and put together
[1:33:56] by the word of God.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; A paradox
[1:34:02] that a a word
[1:34:05] could speak and out of that word would
[1:34:08] would foreign material things. Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; So that things that do appear was made
[1:34:15] out of things that does not appear.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Things that we see was a spoken word of
[1:34:22] God.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; The earth is the word of God.
[1:34:29] The trees are a word of God.
[1:34:34] Why would we be afraid to trust one
[1:34:37] that's given such a word with such power
[1:34:39] and authority?
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why would we be afraid to take
[1:34:44] that word to ourselves and apply it to
[1:34:46] our own self?
[1:34:49] Show us where we have fallen in
[1:34:51] unbelief.
[1:34:53] It's a word, God's word, a paradox.
[1:34:56] Truly a paradox.
[1:34:59] God's word. Also, I would like to show a
[1:35:02] paradox right quick. And that's when God
[1:35:06] called Abraham
[1:35:09] and told him when he was
[1:35:12] 100 years old
[1:35:14] and Sarah was 90,
[1:35:18] 40 years
[1:35:20] a past the time of menopause for her.
[1:35:24] and Abraham whose life was as good as
[1:35:27] dead and Sarah who was [screaming]
[1:35:30] barren to begin with and her womb as
[1:35:33] good as dead and yet God said that he'd
[1:35:38] bring to them a child.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; That's a paradox.
[1:35:43] Ask the doctor if a woman a 100 years
[1:35:45] old could raise a baby, have a baby.
[1:35:48] It's impossible.
[1:35:50] It's incredible.
[1:35:52] But she did it. Amen.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Because God said she would do it.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; It's an incredible thing to think that a
[1:36:01] man could sit with his back turned
[1:36:04] to a tent,
[1:36:06] a stranger
[1:36:09] with dust on his clothes and tell a
[1:36:12] woman who is the back of the tent what
[1:36:14] she was thinking about.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; A paradox.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Incredible,
[1:36:20] but yet it's true.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:23] It was incredible
[1:36:25] when Abraham
[1:36:28] taken Isaac to the top of the mountain,
[1:36:30] his only begotten son,
[1:36:32] and took him up to the top of the
[1:36:34] mountain to offer him up as a sacrifice.
[1:36:38] And when he got to the top of the
[1:36:40] mountain and laid Isaac on the wood and
[1:36:44] was ready to take his life, and when
[1:36:47] he's coming down with his hand,
[1:36:50] something caught his hand. And there was
[1:36:53] a ram hooked by its horns in the
[1:36:56] wilderness on top of the mountain.
[1:36:59] A paradox. Where' the ram come from?
[1:37:04] How could it be a 100 miles from
[1:37:05] civilization without being killed with
[1:37:07] lions and and jackals and wild dogs and
[1:37:11] beasts and things? Where did it come
[1:37:13] from? How did it get there? And up on
[1:37:16] top of the mountain where there's no
[1:37:18] water,
[1:37:19] why was it there when he picked up the
[1:37:21] rocks?
[1:37:24] He called the name Jehovah Gyra. The
[1:37:28] Lord's provided himself a sacrifice.
[1:37:32] incredible
[1:37:34] but yet it's so true.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; For he is Jehovah
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Jarai.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Incredible things that are knowledge and
[1:37:44] science. But yet it is true a great
[1:37:49] paradox.
[1:37:51] It was a paradox and will be
[1:37:55] when Jesus Mark 11:22 or 23 when he said
[1:38:00] if you say to this mountain be moved and
[1:38:04] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:38:06] that what you have said will come to
[1:38:08] pass you can have what you've said. It's
[1:38:11] incredible
[1:38:13] but it's true. It's a paradox. May I
[1:38:17] stop here to say yonder in that woods
[1:38:21] set him with the side of that tree that
[1:38:23] morning.
[1:38:25] No squirrels in the woods.
[1:38:28] But when a voice spoke and said, "Say
[1:38:31] where they'll be
[1:38:34] there." So help me if I'm die before I
[1:38:37] finish this message.
[1:38:39] Pointing my finger to a bare limited
[1:38:43] walnut tree. said, "He sat right there."
[1:38:46] And there he was.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Incredible
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; but true.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "Where will the next be?" I
[1:38:54] said, "Over in that bunch of clumps of
[1:38:56] stuff." And I never tuck my finger down
[1:38:59] till there he was.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Where will the next be out on that snag
[1:39:04] out over that feeling? There he was.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; It's incredible.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; I asked my wife the other morning. I
[1:39:12] said, "Honey, have I lost my senses?
[1:39:16] Am I becoming a mad man? What's the
[1:39:19] matter with me?
[1:39:22] Why do I say the things I do? Why do I
[1:39:25] do the things I do for? What makes me I
[1:39:29] love people and yet just rip them apart?
[1:39:33] And I fast and pray to get a rid of it.
[1:39:36] The more I fast and pray, the worse it
[1:39:38] comes."
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Incredible.
[1:39:43] But it's true.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:39:47] I seen a woman raise her hand just stand
[1:39:50] back in the building praising the Lord
[1:39:52] was Hattie right
[1:39:55] sitting down there when she had two boys
[1:39:58] of excuse me and seeing this renegade
[1:40:02] boys of the world that little woman
[1:40:06] sitting there that day a widow
[1:40:09] and I said Hattie the Lord God you said
[1:40:12] the right thing he provided those
[1:40:14] squirrels he's Jehovah gyra she said
[1:40:16] that's nothing but the truth of God.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, she said the right thing.
[1:40:22] It seems incredible that a human being
[1:40:26] could speak a word. As brother Booth
[1:40:29] told you, as dirty and filthy as we are,
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; who is he that sets back God beyond the
[1:40:35] moon and stars and [screaming] all space
[1:40:38] and time and eternity?
[1:40:41] as even Boo said it and I read the same
[1:40:44] thing the other day reading Irenius that
[1:40:47] even the angels are dirty in his sight.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Who are we
[1:40:55] but a woman
[1:40:57] said the right thing that calls the
[1:40:59] heart of Jehovah
[1:41:02] said ask her what she wants and then
[1:41:04] give it to her.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Incredible.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; But true.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Right here now in our sight is visible
[1:41:16] evidence.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; She asked for her boys
[1:41:20] souls to be Christians. God gave her her
[1:41:24] desire.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Incredible.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; That was more of a miracle than healing
[1:41:29] a sick person.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; That's changed a man's life. soul, body,
[1:41:35] and all he is is changes makeup.
[1:41:38] Incredible, but true. It was a paradox.
[1:41:42] We see it everywhere.
[1:41:46] Paradox in Noah's time. When Noah, a
[1:41:50] man, just an ordinary man, he became a
[1:41:53] prophet, was a prophet of the Lord,
[1:41:55] perhaps farming. God told him, "Prepare
[1:41:59] for a rain to come from heaven." when
[1:42:02] there was no rain. There never been no
[1:42:04] rain.
[1:42:05] There's no way to get rain up there. It
[1:42:08] had never rained on the earth. There was
[1:42:10] no seas.
[1:42:12] There was no waters.
[1:42:14] But yet God told him to make an ark for
[1:42:18] the saving of his house. And God brought
[1:42:21] the rain down.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; It was a paradox.
[1:42:25] Unscientific,
[1:42:27] but what? It was a paradox. Anyhow,
[1:42:32] yes, it was a paradox
[1:42:35] when the Hebrew children that had
[1:42:38] decided they had stay with God's word
[1:42:41] regardless of what happened.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:45] that the king built the furnace seven
[1:42:47] times hotter than it ever had been hit
[1:42:50] and throw those men in there when the
[1:42:52] intense heat of the of the furnace
[1:42:56] killed the man who walked up the gang
[1:42:58] tank with them to the mouth of the
[1:43:00] furnace. They died. But yet those men
[1:43:03] walked in that furnace for perhaps three
[1:43:06] hours.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. there would be no more even
[1:43:11] dust of them. [snorts]
[1:43:14] For the human life that was in them
[1:43:16] would have perished
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; if it made one human life perish but
[1:43:22] coming close to it. What would it do
[1:43:24] another human life?
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; But they throw them in there
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; and let's say three hours. It might have
[1:43:31] been five. He might have went and had
[1:43:33] lunch and come back said open up the
[1:43:35] previous door.
[1:43:37] There won't even be dust to them fellas
[1:43:40] left. But when he opened the door,
[1:43:43] [screaming] there they were.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Unharmed
[1:43:49] walking around in the fire.
[1:43:53] Incredible.
[1:43:55] But true.
[1:43:57] Why? He said, "How many did you put in?"
[1:44:00] They said, "We have put three in." He
[1:44:02] said, "I see four."
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what made the
[1:44:07] paradox.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; And that one looks like the son of the
[1:44:11] gods.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; He was a son of the gods. He was the son
[1:44:17] of God.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; They were heathens.
[1:44:23] Oh, God in his great word.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; There come a time when God's army
[1:44:31] had got cowardly and was afraid of a
[1:44:34] man.
[1:44:36] and it stood on the side of a hill when
[1:44:38] they let one man that was three times
[1:44:41] either side stand out on the side of the
[1:44:44] hill and say now you trust in a real
[1:44:47] God. You say one of you fellas come out
[1:44:50] and fight me
[1:44:52] and we won't we won't have any
[1:44:53] bloodshed.
[1:44:55] The enemy of God
[1:44:58] had backed the church of God
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; against the hillside and they were
[1:45:04] taking it.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; They were afraid. They were cowards.
[1:45:12] And in the camp come a little bitty
[1:45:14] fella,
[1:45:16] little sheep skin wrapped around him, a
[1:45:18] shepherd's coat,
[1:45:20] the smallest man in the whole army, and
[1:45:23] not even a soldier.
[1:45:25] But it was a paradox.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; When God took [screaming] that one man,
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; that one little unconcerned parox, the
[1:45:36] Bible said he was ready. That one little
[1:45:40] man put the whole army, the enemy to
[1:45:42] fight.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; That was a paradox.
[1:45:46] Looks like God would give that great
[1:45:48] marching army enough courage to go
[1:45:50] fight. They were servants of God. Why
[1:45:53] not go fight the battle of God? That's
[1:45:55] God's enemy. Take it. Looks like he
[1:45:58] would have given them courage. But God
[1:45:59] took one little individual. And remember
[1:46:02] another paradox. He never took a sword.
[1:46:06] Saul tried to put his armor on him. Try
[1:46:08] to put a sword in his hand. The poor
[1:46:11] little fell couldn't hold it up.
[1:46:13] And he took a slingshot.
[1:46:17] a little rubber, a little leather with
[1:46:21] two pieces of string wrapped on it
[1:46:24] and he defeated the whole army. How the
[1:46:28] enemy had put him to rot.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; It was a paradox how that one little
[1:46:35] boyless
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; could put an army to running.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; It's a paradox.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Sure, God does it. He's just full of it.
[1:46:46] Amen.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Sure he is. That's what he does. That's
[1:46:48] his way of doing it.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:52] It was a paradox.
[1:46:55] When Egypt had a great army that they
[1:46:57] had, the whole world was conquered. They
[1:47:01] had every nation under their hands. And
[1:47:03] when God decided
[1:47:07] to destroy that army, [clears throat]
[1:47:10] destroy that nation,
[1:47:13] looked like he would have raised up some
[1:47:15] Amorite army or some uh great army
[1:47:18] somewhere and would have sent them down
[1:47:20] there with better equipment or put a
[1:47:22] consolidation of all the denominations
[1:47:25] together to go down and to fight
[1:47:28] together.
[1:47:32] So he get full cooperation.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; But God used a paradox.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; He took an old man 80 years old and
[1:47:43] never put a sword in his hand, but a no
[1:47:45] [screaming] crooked stick
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; that suck Egypt in the bottom of the
[1:47:52] Dead Sea.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Incredible
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; what God can do. Hallelujah.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; But that's the way he does it. He uses
[1:48:02] paradox to do it.
[1:48:05] See, he brings it to a paradox. A
[1:48:08] crooked stick of a shepherd instead of a
[1:48:11] marching army to defeat a a nation that
[1:48:16] rule the world. Oh, the only thing God's
[1:48:20] waiting on now, I believe,
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Russia don't mean nothing to God.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants to get one man.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; You don't have to have big
[1:48:31] organizations. You don't have to have
[1:48:33] big denominations.
[1:48:35] He wants to get one man
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; that he can wrap his spirit into him.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; That'll tell the rest of it.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; There will be another paradox.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; That'll tell he can get someone
[1:48:49] completely surrendered
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; that will do that.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; That's the way God does his work. Amen.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; He uses paradox.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; There was a paradox
[1:49:01] when a great soldier of the of God by
[1:49:05] the name of Jehoshaphat
[1:49:08] stood in the gates with a backsliden man
[1:49:12] by the name of Ahab
[1:49:15] and said, "Before we go to this battle,
[1:49:17] is not it a good thing that we consult
[1:49:19] the Lord?"
[1:49:21] Now, if that man's heart is hungry
[1:49:25] to know the will of God,
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; there's got to be a will of God
[1:49:30] somewhere.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Not always in the multitude of counsel
[1:49:36] and safety.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Ahab says, "I've got all my ministers.
[1:49:45] They're all prophets. I'll call them up
[1:49:47] here.
[1:49:49] And you know, if I bring out 400
[1:49:52] prophets,
[1:49:53] we'll find the word of the Lord. Not
[1:49:55] always. You do. Not always. If it's not
[1:49:59] with the word, then stay away from it.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Care there.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Stay with that word. God can't take that
[1:50:05] word, man.
[1:50:08] Now, he brought them all out there and
[1:50:10] they all prophesied with one accord that
[1:50:12] the Lord was with them. Go up. But yet,
[1:50:16] there was something wasn't right.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That man of God knowed that wasn't
[1:50:20] right.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "Have you got one more?
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Just another one somewhere."
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Or said, "We got one, but I hate him."
[1:50:28] Said, "Don't let the king say so."
[1:50:31] God chose one illiterate boy,
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; a little renegade to the nation, a
[1:50:40] despised and rejected one.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; To bring his message,
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; to the hungryhearted.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Instead of the all the denominations
[1:50:53] together speaking with one accord in
[1:50:56] union, God brought [screaming] one
[1:50:58] person.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. a paradox.
[1:51:02] But the man had the truth
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; and it proved to be the truth
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; because he's with the word.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; It was a paradox. Exactly. Now you say,
[1:51:11] "You mean you disagree with all this and
[1:51:13] that and that? If it's not with the
[1:51:14] word, I disagree with it."
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. God's word will never
[1:51:19] fail.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Talking with the priest not long ago, he
[1:51:23] said, "Mr. Bram, you're trying to argue
[1:51:24] a point from a Bible." Said, "We believe
[1:51:26] the church." Nothing with that. We
[1:51:27] believe the church. What the church?
[1:51:29] said, "God is in his church." I said,
[1:51:30] "God is in his word and he is a word."
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. The word.
[1:51:36] That's the reason Micah
[1:51:38] took the word [screaming] and God used a
[1:51:40] paradox to put every denomination to
[1:51:43] shame
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; and brought to pass the word of the
[1:51:48] servant of God. One man despised,
[1:51:52] rejected, hated
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; while hated by his own people.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Now, he wasn't a communist or he wasn't
[1:52:03] something else.
[1:52:06] Let's say he was Pentecostal.
[1:52:10] And the Pentecostal groups hated him.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; They didn't like him.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; They had nothing to do with him.
[1:52:20] But he had the word of God.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; God made a paradox out of it.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Why wouldn't he, if all these other
[1:52:29] fellows are prophets and ministers and
[1:52:30] so forth, why can't in all this whole
[1:52:32] big group decide something better than
[1:52:34] one person?
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Seem unreasonable that God would just
[1:52:38] make one man's word right and the rest
[1:52:39] of them because that man's word was
[1:52:42] God's word.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; That's the reason God brought the thing
[1:52:45] to pass because a man was with God's
[1:52:48] word.
[1:52:49] Amen.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; The others were prophesying a lie.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Yes. It was a paradox when God took one
[1:52:57] little fella's word and made it true
[1:52:59] because it was his word. God has to
[1:53:01] stand by his word.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Not the council's word, but God's word.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; That's who he stands by. He took Micah
[1:53:10] instead of a well-trained school
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; of ministers, renowned men. Nothing
[1:53:16] against them. They were great men.
[1:53:20] They were a man who believed in not
[1:53:22] another god.
[1:53:24] They believed in the same god Micah
[1:53:26] believed in
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; but they act like they believed in it
[1:53:30] but wouldn't take his word
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; because they wanted to be popular.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; They wanted to find favor with the king
[1:53:37] and their blindness overlook the true
[1:53:39] word of God.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; How could God bless what he had cursed?
[1:53:44] Amen.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; You ladies and men both don't think that
[1:53:50] I do this to be nasty.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; I do it to be honest.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; That's the reason how can I say that
[1:54:01] women should have all right, let them
[1:54:03] cut their hairs off and things like
[1:54:04] that. Where are their clothes? That
[1:54:07] ain't got nothing to do with it. God's
[1:54:09] word says it does.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. She's shameful and disgraceful as
[1:54:15] long as she does it. And God will never
[1:54:17] deal with her.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much she speaks in
[1:54:20] tongues or jumps or shouts.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; She's not got anywhere with God yet.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; That's the word of the Lord.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Man.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; You who can't rule your own house.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; And then try to be preachers and
[1:54:38] deacons. How long are you fit to be a
[1:54:41] preacher in a pulpit?
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; To lead the church of the living God and
[1:54:46] divide for them their inheritance
[1:54:49] when you think more of your meal ticket
[1:54:52] and the offering it comes in than you do
[1:54:53] the word of God and ashamed to say it
[1:54:55] before the women. Afraid you won't be
[1:54:57] popular.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; God have mercy on your sinful soul.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Speak the word of God in truth.
[1:55:05] John said the axe is laid at the root of
[1:55:07] the tree and the axe is a word of God.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Never trees that don't bring forth the
[1:55:12] right fruit it down and cast it into the
[1:55:14] fire.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; God bring us another paradise.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Why did God take John the Baptist as I
[1:55:24] was just speaking of instead of his
[1:55:26] well-trained priest of that day?
[1:55:30] He took a man that never went to school
[1:55:32] a day in his life.
[1:55:35] So we understand that John went into
[1:55:37] wilderness at the age of nine years old
[1:55:40] and was alone with God.
[1:55:46] Few days ago in reading of the Nyian
[1:55:48] council
[1:55:50] that's long time after the death of the
[1:55:52] last apostle St. gone. When those men
[1:55:55] come up there to that nasty council,
[1:55:59] some of those old brothers
[1:56:02] and the rest of them, they come there
[1:56:06] dressed in sheep skins
[1:56:09] upon those robed emperors like
[1:56:12] Constantine
[1:56:13] and the bishops of Rome.
[1:56:17] Old sheepkins wrapped around them and
[1:56:20] lived in the wilderness on herbs. But
[1:56:23] they were prophets of the Lord.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; The little church, the Greek side went
[1:56:29] on, the Roman side went back.
[1:56:32] But it goes to show when you compromise,
[1:56:36] you can't be a servant of Christ. John,
[1:56:40] in that day, the church was very
[1:56:42] orthodoxy.
[1:56:44] They had the priest, a well-trained man.
[1:56:47] But God chose a man that had no
[1:56:48] education at all
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; and tuck him out of the wilderness with
[1:56:54] a piece of sheep skin wrapped around him
[1:56:56] and his whiskers all burned out, his
[1:56:59] hair hanging over his neck, no pulpit to
[1:57:03] preach from, no church to invite,
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; but he probably stood in mud half to his
[1:57:10] knees and preached the kingdom of God is
[1:57:13] at hand. Amen.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; God chose that man.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "Who did you go out to
[1:57:20] see? A man that can speak at all the
[1:57:24] schools, a man that's finally arroed and
[1:57:27] so forth." He said, "There are king's
[1:57:29] palaces." So, what'd you go to see a
[1:57:31] prophet? He said, "More than a prophet.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; This is who the prophet spoke of. But
[1:57:37] come, I send my messenger before my
[1:57:39] face."
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; He was a the angel of the covenant.
[1:57:44] He was the the great forerunner. But it
[1:57:47] was a paradox how God got why didn't he
[1:57:49] come down to that big school up there at
[1:57:50] Jerusalem.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Why didn't he come to Kasis the high
[1:57:54] priest? Why did he not come to some of
[1:57:56] those great trained men who had been
[1:57:59] trained from childhood and their fathers
[1:58:01] have been trained before him and their
[1:58:02] fathers before them for generation after
[1:58:05] generation after generation.
[1:58:08] trained in schooled,
[1:58:10] fine, high cultured,
[1:58:13] educated, and then pick an old man out
[1:58:16] in the wilderness that never had a day
[1:58:18] schooling in his life.
[1:58:21] They set him out on the Jordan and said,
[1:58:23] "This this is him."
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; A paradox. Exactly.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Uncredible, but it was true. God did the
[1:58:32] virgin birth of our Lord.
[1:58:36] Incredible.
[1:58:38] for a woman to bring a child without
[1:58:39] knowing a man. God did it.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; God did it.
[1:58:45] See, it's a paradox.
[1:58:47] Tuck a little old woman down there, a
[1:58:50] little old girl engaged to some man
[1:58:52] about 45 years old. She herself is about
[1:58:54] 16 or 18 and engaged to this man who was
[1:58:58] a widowerer of four children. and then
[1:59:02] took this woman
[1:59:05] and overshadowed her by the Holy Spirit
[1:59:08] and conceived in her womb the body that
[1:59:11] tabernacle almighty God
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; the paradox
[1:59:16] how that heaven can't hold him
[1:59:19] earth is his foottool
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; heavens is his throne
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; and yet can bring the fullness of that
[1:59:26] godhead bodily and embodied into a man
[1:59:30] Hallelujah.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; When you can measure for hundreds of
[1:59:39] billions of miles into aons of time and
[1:59:43] never measure God.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; And yet a little baby laying in a manger
[1:59:49] contained the fullness of his body and
[1:59:51] body.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Jehovah.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; A paradox.
[1:59:58] That great God. Amen.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Who sets back [laughter] to control 100
[2:00:03] million sons
[2:00:05] shining on planets
[2:00:09] who never began and never ended
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; and would embody himself in a manured
[2:00:15] stable
[2:00:17] and then we get out and dance and drink
[2:00:20] and carry on in a celebration. It's not
[2:00:21] a celebration. It's a worship.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; We celebrate Christmas.
[2:00:27] How that God did that in order he could
[2:00:28] die could take the place of a sinner.
[2:00:33] It was a paradox when a little
[2:00:36] curlyheaded boy,
[2:00:38] little stoop shouldered fella, he
[2:00:41] probably wasn't 5 foot tall and he had
[2:00:44] seven locks hanging down around his
[2:00:46] head, a little
[2:00:48] and he was uh uh on his road down one
[2:00:51] day to see his girlfriend
[2:00:54] and a lion
[2:00:57] roared against him. Anybody ever hear a
[2:01:00] real lion roar? Uh you probably have
[2:01:03] these cages and things around here, but
[2:01:05] I want to tell you they're just now. You
[2:01:08] already hear a wild one really roar. The
[2:01:10] rocks will fall off the hill a half a
[2:01:12] mile away. Pebbles roll down the hill.
[2:01:14] It just vibrates the ground. show. Where
[2:01:16] that roar comes from, I don't know.
[2:01:19] Oh, I seen one one day. He's hanging his
[2:01:21] head down. A big old yellow man lion
[2:01:23] roared at a black one because a black
[2:01:25] man because he picked up a piece of
[2:01:27] meat. He left it laying there and as if
[2:01:29] the must say now you leave that alone.
[2:01:30] I'm going down to get a drink of water
[2:01:32] and he went down to lap the water. When
[2:01:33] he come back, this black man had been
[2:01:34] licking on it. The old papy just
[2:01:37] stopped, put his head down and he let
[2:01:39] out a belch and I say that the rocks
[2:01:42] rolled off the hill.
[2:01:44] Oh my. He'd shake the city if he roared
[2:01:46] like that.
[2:01:49] A roar
[2:01:50] of the lion. Oh, he's vioious.
[2:01:55] And that roar run against this little
[2:01:58] curly-headed shrimp we call him.
[2:02:02] And something happened. That little
[2:02:05] shrimp walks over and gets him by the
[2:02:07] mouth and puts one hand down this way
[2:02:08] and one that way, not nervously, and
[2:02:10] just pulls him apart and lays him down
[2:02:12] there.
[2:02:13] That's a paradox.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; What caused it? If you'll notice the
[2:02:19] reading just before it and the
[2:02:22] conjunction, the spirit of [screaming]
[2:02:24] the Lord came upon him.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; That's what made the difference.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; And he slew the line.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Then one day, some Philistines came
[2:02:35] after him. He was unarmed. There was a
[2:02:38] thousand of them. They had long spheres
[2:02:40] and big shields and uh that's like a
[2:02:43] door in front of you like that. The
[2:02:45] shields just think of a great big brass
[2:02:47] shield all the way in front of you with
[2:02:49] helmets of brass on big coats of brass
[2:02:51] and all their shins and everything with
[2:02:53] brass great big long spears long as them
[2:02:56] out that pole there maybe 15 20 feet
[2:02:59] long big brass heads on them like that
[2:03:02] sharp as a razor. And they found this
[2:03:05] little curly-headed shrimp coming down
[2:03:08] from Palestine to visit some girlfriend
[2:03:10] of his down there.
[2:03:13] So they said, "There's that little fell.
[2:03:15] Let's go take him." One man could have
[2:03:17] tucked him by the end of that spear,
[2:03:18] just lifted him up, just shook him a
[2:03:20] little bit, and he fell right down to
[2:03:21] his hand down to the hilt on the sphere.
[2:03:24] Well, he's just a little bitty old guy.
[2:03:26] Some people the artist is trying to draw
[2:03:28] Samson with with shoulders. He couldn't
[2:03:30] walk in this tabernacle. Well, that
[2:03:32] wouldn't be no mystery that a man that
[2:03:34] size. Samson was just a little bitty old
[2:03:36] thing.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; But the spirit of the Lord is what was
[2:03:38] big.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; He takes a dishonor in the scripture to
[2:03:44] say he was a man that size. God always
[2:03:46] takes a foolish and ignorant things to
[2:03:48] like that to do his work with. You see,
[2:03:50] he takes something as nothing. So this
[2:03:52] little fellow was standing out there and
[2:03:54] all at once here come these Philistines
[2:03:56] and surrounded him
[2:03:59] to kill him. and he took the jawbone of
[2:04:01] a mule that was laying there, a wild one
[2:04:04] of little donkeys, picked up the jawbone
[2:04:07] of that mule, and the spirit of the Lord
[2:04:10] came on him.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; And that was a paradox.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; How did he beat down with the jawbone of
[2:04:19] a mule through that half inch thick
[2:04:21] helmet
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; over the top of the head of the jawbone
[2:04:25] of the mule?
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; All right. While the first that old dry
[2:04:29] jawbone land there, the first lick he
[2:04:31] would have hit it bursted into a
[2:04:32] thousand pieces over the top of one of
[2:04:35] those helmets or those big shields. When
[2:04:37] a thousand rushed in upon him and he'd
[2:04:39] beat every one of them to death
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; hallelujah paradox.
[2:04:46] That's when the spirit of God come upon
[2:04:47] him. Oh, we could only be jawbones
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; in the hand
[2:04:55] of God.
[2:04:57] There be another paradox.
[2:05:00] Yes, it was. It was a paradox when
[2:05:03] Jesus, our Lord, took five biscuits and
[2:05:08] two little fish
[2:05:10] and broke them and fed 5,000
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; and taken up baskets full of remainings
[2:05:19] little parcels that some of they lay
[2:05:20] four or five fish out this table and
[2:05:22] four or five loaves of bread and then go
[2:05:24] over here and lay four or five loaves of
[2:05:25] bread. Some of them couldn't even eat it
[2:05:26] all. Just left them laying there. So
[2:05:28] they picked them up. Baskets full of
[2:05:29] them. Oh, see how did he do it? It's
[2:05:35] incredible that a man could take five
[2:05:38] biscuits
[2:05:39] and two little fishes and feed 5,000
[2:05:43] take up seven baskets full
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; left over. It's incredible.
[2:05:49] But he did it.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Why? It was God.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. is a paradox. It's incredible. But
[2:05:57] he did it. It was incredible.
[2:06:00] And never before after
[2:06:03] on a stormy sea
[2:06:06] and the waves so high till it was
[2:06:08] sinking a ship
[2:06:10] when a man come walking down across
[2:06:12] those waves. I you see every time the
[2:06:16] the great big white cap comes around him
[2:06:18] dispers and falls down towards the
[2:06:19] bottom. He walks right on. is like he's
[2:06:21] on a piece of concrete
[2:06:23] walking up on the sea.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; In time of [screaming] a storm.
[2:06:29] Let's science figure that one out.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; What held him up there?
[2:06:34] What kept him on that sea when it's a
[2:06:36] half a mile deep right in there?
[2:06:39] one of those great waves many times
[2:06:41] bigger than this tabernacle splashing
[2:06:43] while while filled a little boat
[2:06:46] and water logged it his way inside and
[2:06:49] out and it was sinking. The mass poles
[2:06:52] had broke down and the orers was gone
[2:06:55] and all hopes of being saved was gone.
[2:06:57] And here come somebody walking on the
[2:07:00] water. Oh glory
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; of paradise.
[2:07:04] Sure.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Incredible cannot be explained but he
[2:07:07] did it.
[2:07:08] Amen.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, he did it. Come walking on the
[2:07:12] water.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; It's incredible
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; that this same one.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Oh God, hope
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; this drives home.
[2:07:23] Incredible.
[2:07:24] A real paradox that this same one, Jesus
[2:07:29] of Nazareth, would choose a bunch of
[2:07:31] ignorant fishermen for his church
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; instead of the well-trained priests and
[2:07:37] denominations to that day.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How a God that had all
[2:07:42] wisdom,
[2:07:43] that could walk on the waters, that
[2:07:46] could turn water into wine, that could
[2:07:49] take a five biscuits and feed 5,000
[2:07:51] people and take up seven baskets fulls
[2:07:53] left over.
[2:07:56] How would that [screaming] same one, the
[2:07:58] God that sets an eternity honor, that's
[2:08:01] the so bright sons,
[2:08:05] hide their face from him? the very pool
[2:08:08] of wisdom and purity
[2:08:12] and of understanding and knowledge
[2:08:15] supreme
[2:08:17] of the supremes.
[2:08:20] And he would come to a place where a
[2:08:23] great organization of churches that all
[2:08:25] gathered together and trained all their
[2:08:27] men. and he'd go down and pick up a
[2:08:29] bunch of dirty, stinking fishermans that
[2:08:30] couldn't even write their own name and
[2:08:32] choose that type of man
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; to set the church into order for his
[2:08:38] bride.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Strange thing, isn't it?
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Looks like at least he took somebody was
[2:08:44] trained.
[2:08:46] He's a trainer.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; He's the one who does it.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Strange that he had did it instead of
[2:08:52] taking church man, he took fisher man
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; to do it. Very odd. But that's why he
[2:08:57] does it.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[2:09:01] Is a real paradox.
[2:09:15] Amen. Let's stand together.
[2:09:31] Let's go to the key of F.
[2:09:36] Counts the stars [singing and music]
[2:09:38] one and all. He knows how much sand is
[2:09:42] on the [singing] shore. Sees each
[2:09:45] sparrow that falls.
[2:09:48] [singing and music]
[2:09:52] made the mountain and the seas. [music]
[2:09:56] He's in control of everything,
[2:10:00] of all creatures, [music and singing]
[2:10:02] great and small.
[2:10:05] He knows my name,
[2:10:08] every step that I [singing] take,
[2:10:10] [music]
[2:10:12] every tear that I make,
[2:10:16] every [singing and music] tear that I
[2:10:18] cry.
[2:10:21] He knows my name. [music]
[2:10:23] When I'm overwhelmed by the pain,
[2:10:28] can't see the [music and singing] light
[2:10:30] of day.
[2:10:32] I know I'll be just fine.
[2:10:36] He knows my name. [music]
[2:10:47] I don't [singing] know what tomorrow
[2:10:48] [music]
[2:10:49] will bring.
[2:10:51] I can't [singing] tell you what's in
[2:10:54] store.
[2:10:55] I don't [music] know a lot of things.
[2:10:58] [singing]
[2:11:02] I don't have [singing and music] all the
[2:11:04] answers to the questions of life,
[2:11:10] but I [singing and music] know in whom I
[2:11:12] have believe.
