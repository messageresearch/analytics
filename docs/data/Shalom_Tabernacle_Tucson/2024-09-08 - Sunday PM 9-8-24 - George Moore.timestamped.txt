[33:23] 45th anniversary September the 26th 27
[33:28] 28 that

[33:32] down there to respect him and honor such
[33:36] a great ministry he's invited um us to
[33:40] be there and so I put that invitation on
[33:43] the board there I
[33:45] am more sentimental towards these
[33:48] Ministries that have stood the test of
[33:51] time for many many years because it's
[33:52] not easy to do and he's one of our
[33:55] brothers and so I want you to pray for
[33:57] that remember that little Fellowship
[33:59] there amen and so some I told him I
[34:02] would go I told him my wife would be
[34:04] going with me if she can and then maybe
[34:07] a few Saints will go down there and be a
[34:09] part of those meetings in AWA a Prieta

[35:22] happy to be back with you in the house

[35:28] while we're all standing we'll just turn
[35:29] in our Bibles to numbers the 20th
[35:32] chapter and we'll get to work tonight so
[35:35] was thinking this afternoon what a nice
[35:38] uh weekend I've had Friday night um had
[35:41] the opportunity to go to Phoenix and be
[35:43] with the Saints there at uh Jericho uh
[35:47] Tabernacle and I think while I was in
[35:50] Jericho I believe brother isra Israel
[35:52] was in Jerusalem and uh so we had had a
[35:55] nice time there I woke up that morning I
[35:58] thank you all for your prayers and come
[36:01] through uh what what I guess was Co and
[36:03] then as soon as we got to feeling a
[36:05] little better from Co the back went out
[36:07] and Friday morning I didn't know how I
[36:10] was ever going to make it to Phoenix to
[36:12] preach and I asked brother Israel to
[36:14] pray and by the grace of God we made it
[36:17] and had a wonderful service there with
[36:19] those Saints and so we're thankful to
[36:21] the Lord for that and then very nice uh
[36:26] very very nice wedding yesterday
[36:27] yesterday I enjoyed that and you know
[36:30] I'm I'm always a little bit nervous
[36:34] these these message weddings uh uh you
[36:38] never know it's like uh many times seems
[36:40] like people want to be in the message
[36:42] all the way up to their wedding day and
[36:44] then then we kind of forget about being
[36:46] in the message but I just thought that
[36:48] was uh the presence of the Lord was
[36:50] there yesterday and it was just a very
[36:53] nice atmosphere and I enjoyed that and
[36:56] and enjoyed being there and
[36:58] uh if you're going to if you're going to
[37:00] start a a wedding if you're going to
[37:02] start a marriage out right it'd be the
[37:04] best thing to do be start it uh with the
[37:06] Lord first in your life amen and so I
[37:09] certainly appreciate that and then uh
[37:12] this morning U such a wonderful service
[37:15] this morning I I appreciated uh
[37:18] appreciated that message from Brother
[37:21] Israel look you think you you might
[37:22] think you want to be a
[37:24] pastor uh right up until it comes com
[37:28] staring a message like that down and
[37:31] nobody wants to come preach that message
[37:34] and but my how it was uh it was is what
[37:37] I needed and certainly I think all of us
[37:40] make us check up you know it's uh I'd
[37:42] have probably run Niles my back felt a
[37:44] little bit better but uh I uh I sure
[37:47] enjoyed it and and it's a good reminder
[37:49] to me and so I know it was uh you all as
[37:53] well and so I I certainly enjoyed and
[37:55] appreciated that so numbers the 20th
[38:02] chapter the seventh verse I touched on
[38:05] this a little bit Friday night but I
[38:06] want to go a little direct a little
[38:08] different direction tonight numbers the
[38:09] 20th chapter and the Lord spake unto
[38:11] Moses saying take the rod and gather
[38:13] thou the assembly together thou and
[38:16] Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the
[38:19] rock before their eyes and it shall give
[38:21] forth his water Thou shalt bring forth
[38:24] to them water out of the rock so thou
[38:27] shal give the congregation and their
[38:29] beasts drink and Moses took the rod from
[38:32] before the Lord as he commanded him and
[38:35] Moses and Aaron gathered the
[38:37] congregation together before the
[38:39] Rock and he said unto them here now ye
[38:42] Rebels must we fetch you water out of
[38:45] this rock and Moses lifted up his hand
[38:49] with his Rod he smoke the rock twice and
[38:52] the water came out abundantly and the
[38:54] congregation drank and their beasts also
[38:57] and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron
[39:00] because ye believe me not to sanctify me
[39:03] in the eyes of the children of Israel
[39:06] therefore you shall not bring this
[39:08] congregation into the land which I have
[39:10] given them this is the water of merbah
[39:14] because the children of Israel strove
[39:17] with the Lord and he was Sanctified in
[39:21] them can we just bow our heads father we
[39:23] thank you tonight for the reading of
[39:26] your word we thank you for the message
[39:29] that we've heard today Lord we thank you
[39:31] for Lord the songs that have been sung
[39:33] the specials Lord we thank you for all
[39:36] the good things that you've provided for
[39:39] us Lord and and we just want to give you
[39:41] the praise and the honor for that Lord
[39:43] Jesus and father we just count it a
[39:47] privilege to be here Lord and just
[39:49] thinking about our brother Brent sister
[39:51] Patricia Lord I just pray oh God you go
[39:54] with them this week Lord and Lord light
[39:57] their path we pray Lord I just ask that
[40:01] you would watch over the further part of
[40:03] this service I pray you would oh God use
[40:06] me in some way to be a help to your
[40:08] people bind my lips before I'd speak
[40:11] anything unpleasing to you and will
[40:13] committ it into your hands in the name
[40:15] of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church
[40:18] said amen God bless you may be seated
[40:21] and title of the message tonight is
[40:23] there ain't no other
[40:25] way and uh all dou double negatives and
[40:28] bad grammar and all that Saints there
[40:30] ain't no other way
[40:33] tonight and I uh I was thinking about
[40:37] this and how that Moses smoked this rock
[40:40] the second time and and it was a very
[40:44] serious offense when he did this so much
[40:48] so that the Lord said because you've
[40:49] done this you won't be allowed to go
[40:52] into the promised land and brother
[40:55] brandham said that when he did it he
[40:56] broke the the whole plan of God because
[40:59] he said it signified that Christ was
[41:01] smitten twice and he said Christ only
[41:04] had to be smitten once and he said it
[41:07] was speaking of in another place brother
[41:09] Bram said that it was speaking of the
[41:12] weakness of the blood not that not that
[41:16] the blood was weak but that it was
[41:18] insinuating that the blood was not
[41:20] strong enough and in another place he
[41:22] said that it spoke of the weakness of
[41:26] their faith in the atonement their
[41:29] weakness in their faith in the atonement
[41:32] and I touched on that the last time we
[41:34] spoke here a couple weeks ago uh about
[41:37] how brother brandom said that if there's
[41:39] only one that's going to make it you be
[41:42] that one and we've got to have ultimate
[41:45] faith not in our own selves but we got
[41:48] to have faith in the atonement that was
[41:51] made for
[41:53] us and he said Christ had to only be
[41:56] smitten once in another place he said it
[41:58] spoke to the weakness of the word not
[42:02] that the word was weak but that it was
[42:05] insinuating that there could be weakness
[42:07] in the word and says there is no
[42:11] weakness in the word of God tonight
[42:15] there is no weakness in the blood of
[42:18] Jesus Christ tonight there's no weakness
[42:22] in the atonement that was provided for
[42:25] you and me at Calvary there no weakness
[42:27] in it and amen and there's no other way
[42:31] that we can be saved tonight outside of
[42:34] God's provided way and brother brandham
[42:38] said in this day he said I indict this
[42:42] generation for crucifying the Lord Jesus
[42:46] Christ a second
[42:48] time amen and I I touched on it the last
[42:52] time I spoke here but that's I've been
[42:54] running across many people in my travels
[42:57] and different places and and young
[43:00] people old people people that's been in
[43:01] the message for years and years people
[43:03] that's just coming into the message and
[43:05] they still wandering around not even
[43:07] sure if they're saved not even sure if
[43:10] they're good enough not even sure if
[43:12] they're going to make a Rapture or not
[43:14] not even sure that their children are
[43:16] going to be saved and Saints I I don't
[43:19] understand how we can sit here tonight
[43:21] in this message and not know that our
[43:24] family's
[43:25] saved did he not not preach a token
[43:28] message to us did he not did he not
[43:31] apply did he not teach us how to apply
[43:33] the blood to our families and we can't
[43:36] sit around wondering how that blood's
[43:38] going to work we just trust that it will
[43:41] work amen if anything we ought to be
[43:43] trying all we can to obey the word in
[43:46] fullness because full obedience to the
[43:48] word of God entitles us to the token and
[43:52] if we fully obey the word we are
[43:54] entitled to the Token on our family is
[43:57] that right
[43:59] Saints so I don't understand these
[44:01] things and I we can't go any other way
[44:04] than God's provided way there's no way
[44:06] to go in the Rapture than the way he
[44:09] brought it there ain't no other way now
[44:12] remember there was a man that made it
[44:15] into the wedding without the wedding
[44:19] garment y'all remember that in the Bible
[44:22] and the King said friend where is your
[44:25] wedding garment and the man
[44:27] was
[44:30] speechless Saints I don't want to be
[44:32] speechless on that day I want to know
[44:35] where the wedding garment came from I
[44:37] want to know on whom I have believed I
[44:40] want to know that I've met God's
[44:42] qualifications that I've come God's
[44:45] provided way and I got an
[44:49] answer but he was
[44:51] speechless and the King said bind him
[44:53] hand and foot and cast him into outer
[44:56] Darkness showing that it's not the works
[44:58] of our hands or the works of our feet
[45:01] brother Brown said that that there was
[45:03] one door that you had to go through and
[45:06] when you went through that one door you
[45:08] were handed your wedding
[45:10] garment but he said this man came in
[45:12] some other way maybe come in through a
[45:14] window or something but Saints says no
[45:17] other way and there ain't no other way
[45:19] that we can receive that wedding garment
[45:21] but God's provided way is that right
[45:24] tonight Saints
[45:28] amen it can't be some
[45:30] denomination it can't be some mental uh
[45:34] conception it can't be some kind of
[45:36] Doctrine somebody come up with it it
[45:38] can't be some some kind of work that
[45:41] somebody tells you you have to do it it
[45:43] can't be any of those things it can only
[45:46] be according to the provided
[45:49] way amen and if we find oursel trying to
[45:53] do it on our own trying to clean oursel
[45:56] up or trying to get herself good enough
[45:59] it's it's trying to Smite that rock a
[46:02] second time you don't have to get
[46:04] yourself good enough he already paid the
[46:07] price for you to be good
[46:12] enough and there ain't no other
[46:15] way if you work yourself up and live
[46:18] good enough in your own self you're
[46:19] still
[46:20] lost
[46:22] outside of the blood of Jesus Christ can
[46:25] you say Amen tonight is
[46:27] amen now what if your children those of
[46:30] you that's got children if you don't you
[46:32] can just imagine with me but what if
[46:35] your children wanted to take a trip
[46:38] somewhere and they had no idea how to
[46:40] get there and so you went to Great Links
[46:43] to provide them stepbystep instructions
[46:46] on how to get
[46:48] there and not only that but you went and
[46:51] paid the fair that was necessary to
[46:55] deliver them to the place they wanted to
[46:57] go so you told them how to do it and you
[47:01] paid for them to be able to do
[47:03] it and then your children decided that
[47:07] they didn't want to go the way they
[47:08] didn't know how to do it themselves but
[47:10] they just didn't want to listen to the
[47:11] way you said do
[47:14] it I mean somebody else's kids not your
[47:16] kids your kids listen to everything you
[47:19] say and do it exactly the way you said
[47:21] do it but but what if that happened well
[47:24] Saints that's what we're talking about
[47:26] when we're talking about the gospel we
[47:28] don't have to wonder about the Plan of
[47:30] Salvation God has given us the Plan of
[47:34] Salvation we don't have to wonder about
[47:36] how to live a Christian Life the message
[47:39] teaches us how to live a Christian Life
[47:42] we don't have to wonder what it takes to
[47:44] be justified what it takes to be
[47:46] Sanctified what it takes to receive the
[47:48] Holy Ghost because the message teaches
[47:50] us what it takes so we got the plan out
[47:53] in front of us and not only do we have
[47:55] the plan in front of us but then Christ
[47:58] died and paid the price and made an
[48:02] atonement and provided the way for us to
[48:05] be able to attain that it's one thing to
[48:08] know what to do it's another thing to
[48:10] actually do it and he told us what to do
[48:13] and then he provided a way for us to do
[48:16] it
[48:18] tonight is that what he did
[48:21] Saints anything we try to do outside of
[48:25] what he taught us to do
[48:27] what he told us to do and what he paid
[48:29] for us to do shows our weakness in the
[48:33] faith of the
[48:39] atonement so you you see your
[48:43] faith has got to be what Christ did for
[48:46] me is all I
[48:50] need the price that he
[48:53] paid is all I need right the blood that
[48:57] he shed is all I
[49:02] need and nothing else is going to work
[49:05] nothing else can take its
[49:07] place
[49:09] amen
[49:11] now brother Brown said in influence of
[49:14] another I read this for you a couple
[49:16] weeks ago he said I want to say this
[49:17] right
[49:18] now the blood of Jesus
[49:21] Christ is all
[49:25] sufficient allu sufficient meaning
[49:28] whatever the need is the blood is
[49:31] sufficient for that need come on
[49:34] somebody tonight whatever the need is
[49:37] the blood is sufficient whatever the
[49:40] struggle is the blood is sufficient or
[49:43] the trial the blood is sufficient or the
[49:46] or the problems in your family the blood
[49:48] is sufficient what whatever the need
[49:51] whatever the hour you're facing the
[49:53] blood is all sufficient whatever the
[49:56] sickness the blood is sufficient
[49:59] whatever the whatever the the the
[50:00] problem you're facing whatever job
[50:02] situation you got the blood is
[50:04] sufficient whatever mental illness
[50:06] whatever oh
[50:08] God the blood is
[50:11] sufficient whatever demon you're
[50:13] fighting the blood is
[50:17] sufficient he said Christ never died for
[50:20] serpens no no but they they were created
[50:23] beings he never died for angels He died
[50:26] for s
[50:29] siners he never died for holy people he
[50:32] died for
[50:34] Unholy and as long as you think you're
[50:37] holy he never done you no
[50:40] good but when you realize you're nothing
[50:43] then he died for
[50:45] you oh
[50:47] God oh God who did he die for in here
[50:50] tonight Saints he died for you he died
[50:54] for me and that was sufficient
[51:04] can we talk about Papa Cox
[51:08] again I'd be a Christian brother Brandon
[51:12] if I could just get good
[51:16] enough and brother brandham said you
[51:19] tell me you look around and you find
[51:23] where you can get good enough and tell
[51:26] me that place is cuz I want to go too he
[51:30] said he said Christ never come to save
[51:32] good men he come to save bad men and
[51:35] when you think you're good he didn't
[51:37] come to save you he come to save them
[51:39] that he knows are
[51:43] bad he we ain't even got to hide it
[51:46] Saints he knows what we are he knows
[51:48] what you were he knows the life that you
[51:51] lived he knows where you're at today
[51:59] oh my there ain't no other way Saints
[52:02] there ain't no other way we don't got to
[52:04] Smite The Rock again once was enough to
[52:09] take my sins away once was enough to
[52:12] heal my broken body once was enough to
[52:14] give me joy enough to give me peace
[52:17] enough to save my family once was
[52:22] enough oh
[52:24] god there ain't no other way way he is
[52:27] the way and the truth and the
[52:31] life and it's
[52:33] enough amen and I'll tell you we got to
[52:36] be careful how we talk about ourselves
[52:39] we got to be careful how we talk because
[52:41] because you might feel like you're not a
[52:43] good enough Christian and you might feel
[52:45] like you're not a good enough believer
[52:47] but but we can't show a lack of faith in
[52:50] the atonement you're not good enough cuz
[52:53] you feel like you're good enough you're
[52:55] good enough because the price was paid
[52:58] the atonement was made and my faith
[53:00] isn't in my good enough my faith is in
[53:02] what he
[53:07] did and there ain't no other way to live
[53:10] your life I've lived both ways I live
[53:13] for the devil and I've lived for the
[53:15] Lord and I tell you this is the only way
[53:18] there ain't no other way to get your
[53:20] healing outside of the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:23] there ain't no other Joy outside of This
[53:25] Joy right here there ain't no other
[53:27] peace outside of this right here Saints
[53:30] there ain't no other way there's no
[53:32] other way to be
[53:35] delivered when I was in doing prison
[53:37] work I was going to say when I was in
[53:39] prison I wasn't in prison I was I was
[53:43] preaching in the prisons and you know
[53:45] they try to get these brothers to go
[53:47] through the the same like a Christian
[53:50] training and Christian principles and
[53:53] Christian thoughts and and Christian
[53:55] steps with Saints you cannot take an
[53:58] unconverted person and get them to live
[54:01] by Christian
[54:02] law it don't work it's just another set
[54:05] of rules it's another book of laws to
[54:08] them well they couldn't follow the law
[54:10] to begin with that's why they in
[54:12] prison and then you hand them another
[54:14] set of laws and expect them to
[54:16] straighten up what they miss is the
[54:18] conversion Saints because when you're a
[54:22] sinner you're living for yourself and
[54:23] you're doing everything you want to do
[54:25] everything you big enough to do but when
[54:27] you become a Christian you still do
[54:30] everything you want to do this message
[54:32] isn't bondage Saints this message is
[54:36] freedom I don't have to struggle to live
[54:38] this message amen God changed my nature
[54:42] to where the message is
[54:45] natural come on somebody
[54:50] tonight there's no other way there's no
[54:54] other Joy outside of This Joy There
[54:57] Ain't No Other Love outside of this love
[55:01] amen you think you got friends in the
[55:02] world you ain't got no friends in the
[55:04] world when you when I give my heart to
[55:06] the Lord all my buddies they all left
[55:09] one by
[55:11] one I didn't run them off but what we
[55:14] wanted to do changed they didn't want to
[55:17] go to church with
[55:21] me they they didn't want to talk about
[55:23] the things I wanted to talk about I got
[55:25] to where I wasn't no fun no
[55:28] more oh but I'm having a blast now
[55:31] Saints I'm having a ball it's the best
[55:33] time of my
[55:34] life every day that I get to live for
[55:37] the Lord amen there's no happiness in
[55:40] the world there's no happiness in the
[55:43] things of the world there's no happiness
[55:45] in drugs and and fashion and alcohol
[55:48] there's no F there's no happiness and
[55:50] being popular there ain't no other way
[55:53] than this way
[55:59] now everybody is following
[56:02] somebody everybody's following
[56:05] somebody and I that's what social media
[56:08] is built on if we're on the internet
[56:10] today brother Israel let's just get on
[56:12] the
[56:14] internets I know brother Israel is a big
[56:17] supporter of the internet
[56:23] now but social media is built on it it's
[56:26] people people that follow other people
[56:28] they want you to follow them that ought
[56:30] to scare us to death to follow somebody
[56:35] they call them
[56:36] influencers that are to scare us to
[56:39] death because if they're not in this
[56:41] message then what kind of influence is
[56:46] it what kind of influence are they
[56:49] influencing
[56:50] us what kind of influence is it see many
[56:54] times it's a bunch of idiots following
[56:56] another bunch of
[56:58] idiots oh here I
[57:02] go you can get people to believe
[57:04] anything but the truth if you say it
[57:07] convincingly enough somebody will listen
[57:09] to you if you say it like you know what
[57:12] you're talking about somebody will
[57:15] follow
[57:17] you and this is what we find that sheep
[57:20] are L they're made to be led our Natures
[57:23] are to be led we're made that way way
[57:27] and the devil knows we're made that way
[57:29] and and the devil knows we're made to
[57:33] follow yes but it's easy to allow
[57:37] ourselves to follow the wrong example
[57:41] instead of the right one and if you want
[57:43] to get yourself in trouble go ahead and
[57:46] start following what everybody else is
[57:51] doing if you want your life to turn out
[57:54] a mess try to be a people
[57:57] pleaser yes you know I've got a brother
[58:00] in the flesh back in
[58:02] Tennessee and and he is by all
[58:06] purposes a better guy than I am he he's
[58:10] he's more talented than I am he's got a
[58:13] better personality than I do he can even
[58:16] cook better than me
[58:21] Josh he's a great guy if you ever met
[58:25] him you'd love him you'd want to swap me
[58:28] out for
[58:31] him he's a great guy he's
[58:35] funny he's got one downfall and that's
[58:38] said he can't say
[58:40] no and whatever anybody else is doing
[58:43] that's what he's doing so if he was with
[58:46] somebody and they said hey let's pull
[58:48] over and Rob this bank right here he say
[58:50] what sounds like a good idea to
[58:54] me and he can't say no
[58:57] s we got to get comfortable saying
[59:03] no and it's got him in so much trouble
[59:06] because he wasn't able to
[59:10] stand don't ever get yourself in a a
[59:13] situation where you're doing what
[59:14] everybody else is doing where you're
[59:16] following to to to to try to appease
[59:20] somebody else where you go against your
[59:22] own convictions to try to make somebody
[59:25] else happy
[59:28] if you got an amiable personality you'll
[59:30] have to fight that somewhat you have to
[59:32] be very cautious against that and some
[59:35] people you know I we're all made
[59:37] different some people don't care whether
[59:38] you like them or
[59:40] not that's not always good
[59:46] either but we got to be able to tell
[59:49] people know if it's for the wrong
[59:52] thing see if you try to be popular you
[59:56] you're going to allow yourself to get
[59:57] pushed into a
[59:59] corner we got to get comfortable telling
[1:00:01] people no you say well they might get
[1:00:03] mad and leave me well you know they
[1:00:05] wasn't with you to begin with anybody
[1:00:08] that's trying to make you do something
[1:00:09] contrary to what they know you believe
[1:00:12] they wasn't with you no
[1:00:14] way they were only there to try to
[1:00:17] facilitate your downfall they're only
[1:00:20] there to see if you'll compromise on
[1:00:22] what you say you believe
[1:00:27] okay now is that right Saints if you got
[1:00:31] a real friend they won't push you to do
[1:00:33] contrary to what you
[1:00:36] believe now the Bible tells us a little
[1:00:39] bit about that I want to read some of
[1:00:40] those scriptures to you tonight Exodus
[1:00:42] the 23rd chapter and a second verse it
[1:00:45] says this it says thou shall not follow
[1:00:49] a multitude to do
[1:00:52] evil let me read it again Thou shalt not
[1:00:56] not follow a multitude to do
[1:01:00] evil neither shalt thou speak in a cause
[1:01:04] to decline after many to rest
[1:01:08] judgments so the Bible said we don't
[1:01:11] follow a multitude to do evil we don't
[1:01:14] follow what the crowd's doing I don't
[1:01:16] care if they got five million followers
[1:01:19] on Instagram we don't follow them to do
[1:01:22] evil is that what the Bible say I don't
[1:01:26] care what kind of influencer they are we
[1:01:28] don't follow them to do evil nor do we
[1:01:32] air on the side of the crowd just to fit
[1:01:37] in nor do we change our judgment the
[1:01:40] Bible said here is that what it said we
[1:01:42] don't alter our judgment to try to fit
[1:01:45] in with what everybody else is
[1:01:47] doing right is right no matter whether
[1:01:50] it's popular or not right is right no
[1:01:53] matter whether people want to hear it or
[1:01:55] not right is right no matter whether the
[1:01:58] the popular opinion or the crowd's
[1:02:00] headed that way we stand for the truth
[1:02:03] tonight Saints and there ain't no other
[1:02:05] way than this way right
[1:02:10] here now you might not have as much
[1:02:12] followers as somebody else but I'll
[1:02:14] guarantee you you'll have followers in
[1:02:17] heaven Proverbs the 16 or Proverbs the
[1:02:19] first chapter 10th verse I love this one
[1:02:22] it said my son if sinners in ice thee
[1:02:27] consent thou not let me read it again my
[1:02:32] son if Sinners entice thee consent thou
[1:02:37] not if they say come with us and let us
[1:02:40] lay weight for blood let us uh lurt
[1:02:43] privately for the innocent without cause
[1:02:45] let me skip down to the 15th verse it
[1:02:47] says my son walk not thou in the way
[1:02:51] with them refrain thy foot from their
[1:02:54] bath
[1:02:57] so so you say well brother George I I'm
[1:02:59] not doing anything wrong it's it's the
[1:03:01] it's these other people that I'm
[1:03:02] following are doing wrong well the Bible
[1:03:05] said that you don't even consent to
[1:03:08] doing wrong and Saints if you're going
[1:03:10] along with it and not doing anything
[1:03:12] about it you're consenting to
[1:03:19] it see Paul didn't Stone
[1:03:22] Stephen but he consented to the stoning
[1:03:25] and it haunted him the rest of his
[1:03:26] ministry didn't it amen you say well
[1:03:30] well I'm not following evil maybe you're
[1:03:32] not following evil in person but you can

[1:04:20] mind is being
[1:04:22] transformed come on somebody tonight
[1:04:27] and there's many voices trying to tell
[1:04:31] us all that there's a a better way that
[1:04:34] there's another way that that that you
[1:04:36] you don't have to you don't have to
[1:04:38] believe this message this message was
[1:04:40] from from from

[1:04:52] telling you there's another way but I
[1:04:54] came tonight to tell you there's only
[1:04:56] one way Ephesians 5 11th verse says and
[1:05:01] have no fellowship with the unfruitful
[1:05:04] works of darkness but rather reprove
[1:05:08] them now here's the part we miss is the
[1:05:11] reproving them and I'm guilty and you're
[1:05:13] guilty we're all guilty sometime of
[1:05:15] maybe not saying something we need to
[1:05:19] say see people will try to slip stuff in
[1:05:22] on you to see how you'll react to see
[1:05:26] how you'll take it to see if you really
[1:05:28] believe what you say you believe it they
[1:05:30] try to slip it in there and see what
[1:05:32] your reaction is to
[1:05:34] it the Bible said reprove them amen God
[1:05:40] help me not to stand silent amen I'll
[1:05:43] tell you right now the devil don't mind
[1:05:46] offending you don't be scared to offend
[1:05:48] the devil

[1:06:35] you as
[1:06:37] well you know parents you can tell who
[1:06:41] your kids have been
[1:06:43] around if they've been around that
[1:06:46] certain little little boy or girl with
[1:06:48] that smart
[1:06:49] mouth when they come
[1:06:51] back they'll pick up on that and they'll
[1:06:55] start getting that little smart mouth
[1:06:57] Spirit on them
[1:06:58] too well it works in all things it even
[1:07:01] works on
[1:07:03] adults you can tell who preachers have
[1:07:05] been around a lot of times amen evil
[1:07:09] Communications corrupt good manners the
[1:07:13] Bible plainly declares though that we
[1:07:16] can follow the right
[1:07:19] example we can the Bible said in First
[1:07:23] Peter the 2 chapter 21th verse it said
[1:07:25] for even here unto were ye called
[1:07:29] because Christ also suffered for us
[1:07:32] leaving us an example that we should
[1:07:36] follow his
[1:07:38] steps there's the influencer I want to
[1:07:40] be following right there amen that
[1:07:43] that's the that's the influence that I
[1:07:45] if I want to follow somebody and I don't
[1:07:48] do good following nobody but if I want
[1:07:51] to follow somebody there's who I need to
[1:07:54] follow right there we need to follow in
[1:07:57] the footsteps of
[1:08:00] Christ Corinthians 11th chapter be ye
[1:08:03] followers of me Paul said even as I also
[1:08:07] am of
[1:08:08] Christ Paul didn't have a problem
[1:08:10] telling you you need to follow him I
[1:08:14] don't have a problem saying I need to
[1:08:15] follow William
[1:08:20] brandom same Prophet same kind of
[1:08:23] prophet is that right I'll preach the
[1:08:26] same message Paul preached we're resting
[1:08:29] on it amen is that right I don't have a
[1:08:32] problem saying I'm following William
[1:08:36] brandom now that's gotten to be
[1:08:38] offensive in message churches I don't
[1:08:40] know how how do you believe the message
[1:08:42] without believing the
[1:08:47] message I got to pull up brother Wesco
[1:08:49] brother Israel he said how you going to
[1:08:50] say what the prophet say without saying
[1:08:52] what he say
[1:08:57] how are we in the
[1:08:58] message if we don't believe the
[1:09:01] message Hebrew uh first Thessalonians 6
[1:09:04] uh 1 Thessalonians 1 chapter 6 verse and
[1:09:07] ye become followers of us and of the
[1:09:10] Lord so followers of us and of the Lord
[1:09:14] having received the word in much
[1:09:17] Affliction with joy of the Holy
[1:09:21] Ghost amen Hebrews the 13th chapter 7 s
[1:09:25] th verse not the eighth seventh verse
[1:09:28] says remember them which have rule over
[1:09:32] you who have spoken unto you the word of
[1:09:36] God whose Faith follow not just
[1:09:40] preaching the word but living the word
[1:09:43] come on somebody tonight considering the
[1:09:46] end of their conversation well what's
[1:09:48] the end of their conversation Jesus
[1:09:50] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:09:54] forever
[1:09:56] there ain't no other way Saints so if
[1:09:58] you're going to follow somebody follow
[1:10:00] somebody that tells you Jesus Christ is
[1:10:03] a same yesterday today and forever
[1:10:05] follow somebody that's walking like
[1:10:07] Jesus that's talking like
[1:10:12] Jesus there ain't no other way the only
[1:10:15] influencer I want in my life is the Holy
[1:10:19] Ghost there's no other name given under
[1:10:21] heaven whereby we must be saved there's
[1:10:24] not one thing brother Brown said that
[1:10:26] you can do to be saved if you could
[1:10:28] Christ died in
[1:10:32] vain there's not one thing that anybody
[1:10:34] else can do either there's not one
[1:10:36] influencer in this world that has the
[1:10:39] words of eternal life even in our
[1:10:42] attempts to serve the Lord there ain't
[1:10:44] no other way than God's provided way
[1:10:47] there's no new doctrine coming that's
[1:10:49] going to save us there's no new message
[1:10:52] coming that's going to save us we have
[1:10:54] the message and this message will
[1:10:57] introduce us to Jesus
[1:11:04] Christ there ain't no new work that can
[1:11:06] save us there's no new preacher that can
[1:11:08] save us you could even listen to tapes
[1:11:11] 24/7 and they can't save you unless you
[1:11:14] do what the tapes say to
[1:11:17] do and if you play it like it's noise in
[1:11:19] the background it ain't doing you no
[1:11:21] good but you got to listen you got to
[1:11:24] hear you got receive and you got to act
[1:11:27] upon
[1:11:29] it everpresent water from the Rock
[1:11:32] brother Brown says now here God teaches
[1:11:34] us a great thing God teaches us here a
[1:11:37] lesson Christ was smitten once given us
[1:11:40] a Pentecostal experience oh God one time
[1:11:44] for all amen so if he was smitten once
[1:11:48] given a Pentecostal experience then
[1:11:51] there's still a Pentecostal experience
[1:11:53] today cuz it's once for
[1:11:58] all now when that rock was smitten it
[1:12:01] did not have to be smitten again it was
[1:12:04] only smitten once Moses made a mistake
[1:12:07] by smiting it the second time showing
[1:12:09] the weakness of his faith in the in the
[1:12:12] atonement but when Christ was smitten
[1:12:15] once we know he won't have to be smitten
[1:12:20] again well what was Moses doing Moses
[1:12:25] was setting up something
[1:12:28] new trying to make a new
[1:12:31] thing and that's the way our
[1:12:34] clergyman has done today they've tried
[1:12:38] to make something new and Saints we see
[1:12:42] it all over the place all in the message
[1:12:45] where the people are the the the clergy
[1:12:48] feels like they got to come up with
[1:12:50] something so you got to come to them for
[1:12:53] it you don't have to come to the clergy
[1:12:55] for it you already got the word
[1:12:59] Saints I don't have to invent something
[1:13:02] new the it's already been given it's
[1:13:05] already been paid the message is already
[1:13:08] with
[1:13:10] us I don't have to come up here and
[1:13:12] preach something you ain't never heard
[1:13:14] before to try to make you have to oh you
[1:13:17] got to hear Brother George oh i' never
[1:13:19] heard anything like it before if you say
[1:13:21] that about anybody that's probably a red
[1:13:24] flag amen if you ain't heard it before
[1:13:27] after all these years there's something
[1:13:30] wrong Saints it's probably not in the
[1:13:40] message I don't care about hearing
[1:13:42] nothing
[1:13:46] new God God called me to this word god
[1:13:51] called me to this message and this
[1:13:53] message is enough Saints it's good
[1:13:56] enough it's powerful
[1:14:02] enough I don't need this message plus
[1:14:05] something else I don't need Christ plus
[1:14:08] something else I needed God's provided
[1:14:11] way and if there was anything else we
[1:14:14] needed he would have brought
[1:14:17] it and it still be in the message
[1:14:28] one more time with private interview I
[1:14:30] read this for you a couple weeks
[1:14:32] ago sister Bruce said I have never had
[1:14:35] an
[1:14:37] experience that I've been filled with
[1:14:39] the Holy
[1:14:40] Ghost that I could put my foot
[1:14:44] on and I see hundreds and hundreds of
[1:14:47] people
[1:14:49] battling with whether they got the holy
[1:14:51] ghost or not because they haven't had
[1:14:53] the experience that they were looking
[1:14:58] for not the experience that he said
[1:15:00] would come but they don't have the
[1:15:03] experience that they mentally had worked
[1:15:05] up in their mind that I'm going to go to
[1:15:08] the Altar and the and the corridors of
[1:15:11] Heaven is going to open and an angel's
[1:15:13] going to come and lay a scepter on me
[1:15:16] and say I give you the baptism of the
[1:15:18] Holy
[1:15:19] Ghost or an experience or a sensation
[1:15:22] and I believe in all of those things but
[1:15:25] you could have an experience or a
[1:15:26] sensation and not have the Holy Ghost
[1:15:29] but the Holy Ghost can give you an
[1:15:31] experience or a
[1:15:35] sensation she said I don't have an
[1:15:37] experience that I've been filled with
[1:15:39] the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot
[1:15:41] on he said all right notice this
[1:15:43] ordinarily a human being is born in sin
[1:15:45] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[1:15:47] speaking lies is that right Saints is
[1:15:49] that what you were were you born in sin
[1:15:53] shaped in iniquity comeing the world
[1:15:55] speaking lies nobody had to teach you
[1:15:57] how to tell that first lie amen it just
[1:16:00] come it come right out of you that's all
[1:16:03] of us Saints brother Bram said if you
[1:16:05] got a belly
[1:16:08] button you was a renegade to begin
[1:16:12] with
[1:16:17] amen every one of us was he said that's
[1:16:20] the nature of a human being Sister Bruce
[1:16:23] said yes and he said that was your
[1:16:26] nature and he said it changed
[1:16:30] once and he said what changed
[1:16:34] it and she said
[1:16:38] Christ and he said there you are
[1:16:41] sister that's it he
[1:16:44] said you see how simple it is
[1:16:48] Saints look at what you
[1:16:50] were look at how you lived look at the
[1:16:54] things you used to do and look at what
[1:16:57] you are
[1:16:59] today now you might not you might still
[1:17:01] be working we're all
[1:17:03] working you might still be struggling
[1:17:05] we're all struggling we're we're still
[1:17:08] in this old fleshly nature amen you're
[1:17:11] still battling this every
[1:17:14] day but look at where you came from what
[1:17:17] did that he said Christ did that and he
[1:17:22] said I am persuaded
[1:17:25] that he which begun a good work in you
[1:17:29] will keep it until that
[1:17:34] day but we try to make everything so
[1:17:36] complicated sa there ain't no other way
[1:17:39] outside of Jesus Christ he said Jesus
[1:17:42] said they bind heavy burdens and
[1:17:46] Grievious to be born and they lay them
[1:17:48] on men shoulders they they come up with
[1:17:51] new things they come up with more than
[1:17:54] that you got to do to be good enough
[1:17:57] more that you have to do to be a
[1:17:58] believer and you got to believe this
[1:18:00] certain Doctrine or go to this certain
[1:18:03] church or listen to this certain tape
[1:18:05] you want the easiest job in the world
[1:18:07] Saints it's picking out a good
[1:18:13] tape but you got to listen to this one
[1:18:16] or you got to go to this church or you
[1:18:18] got to worship this way you're not
[1:18:20] worshiping loud enough or or over here
[1:18:22] you're worshiping too loud you got to
[1:18:24] quiet it down a little bit or you got to
[1:18:26] do it this way you got to do it that way
[1:18:28] and they bind these burdens and lay them
[1:18:31] on the people's
[1:18:34] shoulders but if it ain't in the
[1:18:36] message then it's just an
[1:18:44] opinion the world tries to do it the
[1:18:47] influencers try to do it the politicians
[1:18:51] try to do it sa it's so messed up even
[1:18:53] Trump can't fix
[1:18:57] it the government tries to do it the the
[1:19:01] the the schools try to do it everybody's
[1:19:03] trying to lay a burden on man's
[1:19:07] shoulders something that they have to
[1:19:13] do but there ain't no other
[1:19:16] way we don't have to Smite The Rock
[1:19:19] again now we're just drinking from The
[1:19:22] Rock now we're just drinking I I don't
[1:19:25] have to wonder how I need to live how I
[1:19:28] need to act what a real Christian is I
[1:19:32] don't have to wonder about it anymore
[1:19:34] Saints it's
[1:19:35] plain I don't have to wonder about how
[1:19:37] to dress myself I don't have to wonder
[1:19:39] about how to conduct myself I don't have
[1:19:41] to wonder about how to do church it's
[1:19:44] plain Saints it's all
[1:19:48] there all we're doing is drinking from
[1:19:51] The Rock
[1:19:52] tonight there's no guess work in this in
[1:19:56] five minutes time you can search the
[1:19:59] message and find almost anything you
[1:20:01] want to that you're wondering
[1:20:04] about that's how accessible it is to
[1:20:09] us but it's the nature of man to try to
[1:20:13] do something himself it's it's it's in
[1:20:16] the garden it's it's man running trying
[1:20:18] to sew fig leaves together and and he
[1:20:21] told him the whole time it's not the Fig
[1:20:22] leaves it's the blood
[1:20:29] amen I like it like this Saints if you
[1:20:31] got an idea you got something I need to
[1:20:33] do just show me the
[1:20:35] quote just show me where the Prophet
[1:20:37] said it if you show me where the Prophet
[1:20:39] said it guess what I will believe
[1:20:43] it because I believe every word is
[1:20:50] said oh come on somebody tonight
[1:20:55] show me the quote and and and in this
[1:20:57] day and time if they don't have the
[1:20:59] quote for it they'll just tell you well
[1:21:01] I it's a
[1:21:04] revelation you just got to get the
[1:21:06] Revelation brother George Well if if
[1:21:08] it's a revelation that's not in the word
[1:21:10] of God I don't want
[1:21:12] it you can go ahead and keep
[1:21:19] it oh amen when Moses smoked the rock
[1:21:22] the second time br said he he s the
[1:21:26] Bible said he Sanctified
[1:21:28] himself instead of sanctifying God in
[1:21:31] his anger and I feel sorry for him
[1:21:34] because he dealt with a lot Moses dealt
[1:21:36] with a
[1:21:37] lot if anybody had a right to be angry
[1:21:40] it was
[1:21:41] Moses I mean how much could God do for a
[1:21:44] people and them complain
[1:21:47] constantly they saw him open the Red Sea
[1:21:51] they saw him deliver with their plagues
[1:21:53] that was in Egypt they saw all of it as
[1:21:55] soon as they get over there they don't
[1:21:57] even cross the Red Sea yet they're
[1:21:58] already
[1:22:01] complaining then they get out in the
[1:22:02] wilderness complaining some more whining
[1:22:05] and crying some more oh you brought us
[1:22:08] out of here we like them garlic pots
[1:22:10] back in
[1:22:12] Egypt now when he got no water to drink
[1:22:15] and in his
[1:22:16] frustration he smok that rock the second
[1:22:20] time and he said here now ye Rebels must
[1:22:23] we fetch you water out of the rock well
[1:22:26] it ain't we we ain't got nothing to do
[1:22:29] with it it's Christ and and it was a
[1:22:32] mistake and God said because you didn't
[1:22:34] sanctify me because you didn't lift me
[1:22:37] up before the
[1:22:40] people
[1:22:42] amen
[1:22:43] Saints none of this is
[1:22:47] us you you might have a
[1:22:49] gift the Lord might have blessed you
[1:22:51] with something but that was the Lord
[1:22:54] that gave it to
[1:22:56] you there ain't there ain't nothing in
[1:22:59] me to
[1:23:00] sanctify there there's no good in
[1:23:03] me I I know what I was without the Lord
[1:23:06] and it's filth Saints amen and if you
[1:23:09] have a gift or you got a calling or
[1:23:11] there's something in your life and
[1:23:12] you're special in some kind of way it's
[1:23:14] not
[1:23:15] you it's
[1:23:19] him we sanctify him
[1:23:28] amen so many times we're trying to
[1:23:31] sanctify ourselves we try to clean
[1:23:34] ourselves up we want to be able to point
[1:23:37] to something that we
[1:23:39] did Saints it's not repent and be
[1:23:42] baptized and receive the Holy Ghost plus
[1:23:44] anything
[1:23:46] else it's you do the
[1:23:50] repent then the
[1:23:53] baptizing and and then Christ gives the
[1:23:55] Holy
[1:23:56] Ghost
[1:24:03] amen you know for a group of people that
[1:24:07] should be firmly against organized
[1:24:09] religion and against
[1:24:11] denominations we sure seem to start new
[1:24:14] ones all the
[1:24:16] time Saints one message is all we
[1:24:19] need this word is
[1:24:22] enough we don't have to DEC at it
[1:24:25] anymore we don't have to make it more
[1:24:27] flowery so the people will receive it we
[1:24:30] don't have to worry about it offending
[1:24:31] somebody Saints it doesn't offend the
[1:24:34] bride the message does not offend the
[1:24:38] bride did the message offends you it
[1:24:42] does not offend the bride we don't have
[1:24:45] to change it we don't have to decorate
[1:24:47] it we don't have to polish it up we
[1:24:49] don't have to smooth it out
[1:24:56] the message is
[1:24:58] enough the message why brother Brown
[1:25:00] said if you here's what it is if you
[1:25:02] ever seen anything in a pawn
[1:25:05] shop and then you go and redeem it from

[1:30:23] that my life changed I remember the hour
[1:30:26] that I gave it over into his hands and

[1:30:32] me I know what I was and I know where
[1:30:36] I'm at
[1:30:38] today I know that there was a blood Shed
[1:30:41] from me because his word declares that
[1:30:44] it was shed for me I know that my debt
[1:30:47] was paid because the word declares it
[1:30:50] was paid
[1:30:54] and I know that it's sufficient and I
[1:30:56] know that there ain't no other way and I
[1:30:59] know that I don't have to Smite that

[1:32:11] counting on what he did I'm counting on
[1:32:14] what the word says and I'm not looking
[1:32:17] to what I see with my eyes I'm looking
[1:32:20] to what my soul declares to be the truth
[1:32:23] I'm looking looking at a promise that
[1:32:26] was made to me and I am
[1:32:31] persuaded I am
[1:32:33] convinced that the one that started this
[1:32:36] work in me will never fail me the one
[1:32:40] that started his work will go with me
[1:32:43] he'll be in me all the way even until
