We know we want to remember brother Scott's, a little relative, little Grady in the hospital, and just welcome everybody to church this morning. Let's bow our heads, our hearts this morning. Dear God, we're so thankful to be in church on a Saturday morning, the day we take off, Lord. But today, we're [music] taking off to worship you and no other thing that we could be doing.

So, we hold up our needs, our requests, financial, spiritual. Lord, the most important thing for that token, Lord, for eternal life. And we just apply that again. Help us, Lord, as we try to make things comfortable and best we can for the saints here. And may your perfect will be done in each heart and each life as we collect the tithes, the offerings, Lord. We do as [music] cheerful givers unto thee, knowing that you don't need it, but we're cheerful givers. And we bring a tithe and an offering, Lord, just to bless you once again. We love you.

Praise [singing and music] God. Praise God. Praise God. [singing and music] Amen. He is worthy of all of our praise. [applause] &gt;&gt; You can be seated for just a moment. Well, maybe I would think everybody's probably heard me sing this song, but I like to sing it. Um, it's kind of my theme [music] song for me because the song says, "Lord, I need you." That's just where we're [music] at, right? And so, but since there was only 11 people here that have heard me, plus those that never raised their hands in church, &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; um I thought, well, I can sing it again and maybe just that'll just relax me a little bit. [music] And and I thought, well, I probably shouldn't sing. My voice is a little I had [music] a three three services in Kansas last weekend and man, we sang and wasn't a lot left and there's been a lot of tea [music] over the last week. So, we're getting there. But, um, I'd just like to sing this song and and just and [music] just express a prayer to the Lord. [clears throat] Lord, I come. I confess. Bowing [singing and music] here, I find my rest [music] without [singing] you. I fall apart. You're the [singing] one who guides my [music] heart. [singing] Lord, I need you. [music] Oh, I need you. Oh, every [singing] hour. How I need [music] you. You're my one [singing] defense, my rightousness, [music] oh [singing] God, how I need. &gt;&gt; Where sin runs [singing] deep, your grace is more. Hallelujah. Where [music] grace [singing] is found is where you are. And where you are, Lord, I am free. Holiness is [singing] Christ in me. Lord, I need you. Oh, I need you. Oh, every hour. How I need you. You're my one defense, my rightousness. Oh God, how I Oh, let's stand and [music] sing it together. Lord, I need you. Oh, [music] I [singing] need you. Oh, every hour. How [music and singing] I need you. You're my one defense, [singing] my rightousness. [music] Oh God, how [singing] I hear you. &gt;&gt; You're my one defense, my rightousness. [singing] Oh God, how I &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [clears throat] Believe that's our prayer. Lord, we need [music] you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But where sin runs deep, his grace is more. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Where grace [music] is found is where he is. He gives us not just grace isn't just pardon. Grace is also himself. He gives us that which we have need of. Uh first John I think it's 1:9 is that he is faithful and just to forgive us all of our sins [music] and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. So it's not just forgiveness, but there also a power to [music] cleanse. And he is that power to cleanse. Amen. Praise the Lord. While you're standing, uh, if you would turn to 1 Corinthians chapter [music] 6, I don't know if we can switch to the slides. Is it connected? Kind of the first time we've done it this way. Oh, there we go. It's a black screen. That means it's working. Okay. 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse [clears throat] 12. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Just would like to remind you that this is the Apostle Paul that we will be discussing this morning. And it is the Apostle Paul that is writing this. And he says, "All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any." If you also go down to verse 19, verse 19 says, "What know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?" &gt;&gt; I'd like to just make [clears throat] one statement here. If your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; then your body is not the Holy Ghost. That'll some It's morning. &gt;&gt; It's early coffee kick in. Let's Okay. Praise the Lord. Okay. So, we'll dive into that a little deeper. If you want to know my meaning on that, we will get there. Um 1 Corinthians 15, if you would a few uh chapters farther, [snorts] [clears throat] I protest 15:31. I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. I die daily. So we have Paul telling us that he doesn't want to be brought under the power even if it's a good maybe it's a good thing maybe it's a bad thing he doesn't want to be brought under the power of anything. The [clears throat] apostle Paul if the apostle Paul is saying I don't want to be brought under the power of anything that means he is subject to be able to be brought under the power of something &gt;&gt; all right first church age messenger okay um then if your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost then your body is not the Holy Ghost that means your body I don't know you it might have struggles &gt;&gt; amen okay and so and And then if Paul is saying, "I die daily, that must mean that the apostle Paul is also struggling within himself over these various things that may cause him that that he's saying, I I don't want to be brought under the power of this, so I'm going to die daily to that thing." &gt;&gt; Which means there's a war going on within even the Apostle Paul. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's pray. Heavenly Father, as we look to your scriptures, we look to the things your prophet has said for us in our age, I pray, Lord God, that you would anoint us to hear, Lord God, that we would hear the grace of Jesus Christ coming down, Lord God, that that we would see our part in the word, Lord God, and what you have done with us uh for us, oh God. And Lord, we look to you, Lord. We need you. We need your grace. We need your love. And this is a late hour, Lord God. and you've given us every resource you've given us of yourself that you have made yourself known, unveiled yourself to us that we might know you in your fullness and who you really are, Lord God. And that that picture, God, would captivate our hearts, oh God, and draw us into you. Bless uh your people now and bless your word. We ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated. [cough and clears throat] So um because we have started here in 1 Corinthians uh we are going to be talking about Romans chapter 7 and so I no one really is it that early like you all I just so so for the 11 of you and those who don't raise your hand in church um just you know I'm gonna need you to relax a little bit this morning and you know because here's what I need you to what I'm gonna do is just do everything I can to absolutely get you so relaxed that you don't see it when it comes and hits you. And so, okay. So, I just need we're going to you're going to work with me a little bit here. So, okay. So, don't don't make us do Father Abraham to wake you up now. This, okay, cuz it's just not that youth meeting. So, anyway, I thought that was kind of a little switcheroo. We started in first Corinthians and then the brother is going to talk about Romans 7. Maybe they'd go, "Wait, what?" And no one seemed to give me that reaction and I I'm premeditated to get that reaction. And so now I'm I need help. So, okay. So, all right, we're together now. So, I want to talk about Romans chapter 7. And I, you know, I was talking to a friend of mine the other day and I was just, you know, I was just like, "Oh, you know what? Like, you know, it's Romans 7." You know, I just this and this and this. He's like, he's like, "I hate you so much, brother." And I was like, "That's nice. Praise the Lord." You know, he's like, "Cuz you're you're just, you know, you what's Romans 7?" You know, like you're just talking about Romans 7 like it's the most natural thing ever. and I don't know what you're talking about, you know, and well, I was like, but I preached this at your church like two weeks ago. Like, but I don't know what happened. But anyway, but but more than just that, more than just like, don't you remember what I preached two weeks ago? How I'm so offended. But but no, it's like to me Romans 7 is like like from the time I was 16 to the time I was like 24. And it probably didn't end it definitely didn't end there. But I feel like that like through those years like I lived Romans 7 like this that Ro what Paul talks about in Romans chapter 7 was such I mean it was just like you know it's you know the phrase I heard not too long ago the book read me you know I didn't have to read the book the book read me and I was like okay you know and I just feel like this oh I should start my timer oh I got free extra five minutes anyway and so so so like so I just lived in that you know and and so now Okay. Are you going to ever tell us you know what Romans 7 was so personal to you? We get it. Fine. What exactly was Romans 7? And maybe you've turned in your Bible there and maybe you haven't. Nobody's going to turn pages in the Bible. This is man, this is going to be work today here. So, okay. There's there's nuance. There's a lot of suggestive stuff that I just expect that you'll be like, "Oh, yeah. I get it. Thank you, sister. God bless you. Appreciate you. Alaska is representing today. Okay. So, Romans 7, we have we have so the title then Romans 7, that which I do, I allow not. Now, this is this is the passage where, you know, my wife um she would when we we first got married, she's like, "Oh, yeah. That's that that's that Shakespeareian, you know, Paul is, you know, it's just it's like is it it's this it's like I do I don't I don't do I do I do I I just get so lost." And so, that's what we want to do is we want to look at at that at that passage. So, &gt;&gt; are we together today? Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Praise the Lord. So, Romans chapter 7, let's turn and let's look at verse 14. And Paul says, "For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin. For that which I do, I allow not. For what I would, that do I not, but what I hate, that do I. If then I do that which I would not, I consent to the law that it is good." Take a breath. Now, then it is no more I that do it, but sin that doeth in me. For I know that in me that is in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing. For to will is present with me to how to form I find which I find everybody together are we good like you all are following perfectly right you have 100% understanding of exactly what Paul is saying here okay praise the Lord I like how some people said it and then shook their head no at the same time. So for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do. Don't worry we'll slow it down and break it down here in a moment. But now if I do that I would not. It is no more I that do it, but that sin that dwelleth in me. I find then a law that when I would do good, evil is present with me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man. But I see another law in my members, waring against the law of my mind, bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. I love this next verse because this next verse, Paul gives us language to speak exactly how we're feeling. And I really appreciate him for that. Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? Like how many times have you failed and done something you knew better and then just thought and then Paul comes along and and so he gives you language you're like yeah Lord I'm a wretched man &gt;&gt; I need I who is going to like I failed again who is going to deliver me Lord because obviously I'm not doing such a good job myself &gt;&gt; I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord so then with mine uh I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of the spirit. So let's come back here to verse 15 and let's let's just let's just talk through this a little bit. And and so for that which I do, I allow not. So I'm going to go over here and I'm going to do this thing, but I know I shouldn't. I don't want to do this thing. And then then the question comes like, well, if you don't want to do that thing, why are you doing that thing? &gt;&gt; Man, that's a good question. I don't want I know I know better. I don't want to. But man, here I am doing the thing and and for what I would the things that I I know, you know, we can go back to brother George last night reading your Bible and praying, you know, and I know I I I want to do that every day. Lord, you know my heart. I want to read my Bible and pray every day. And so Lord, I got up early and and I opened my Bible, but I got a text message and it just really quick thought, I'm going to just deal with that thing really. It won't it just take two seconds. I'm just going to deal with that and then my whole attention can be back on the word. &gt;&gt; And the next thing you know, you're late for work and the thing that you knew you should do, you didn't do it. &gt;&gt; And so you're like, I'm doing the thing. I I know I don't want to do this and I'm doing this and I I don't want to do I I you know I know I know I should do this but I'm not doing that. [snorts] You see I now you understand why I was so very familiar with most of my life with Romans chapter 7. It's like Paul like what are you doing here? Like why does this have to be true? Can't we Is there a way out? What can I do Lord? But that which I hate, like, oh my goodness, not only do I not want to do this thing, I hate this thing. &gt;&gt; Hate it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, let's we should, you know, let's do this. &gt;&gt; Anybody ever been there? &gt;&gt; Is Yeah. Yeah. This guy, he's been there. &gt;&gt; So anyway, praise the Lord. Is it uncomfortable at all? Are we good? Like, okay. So just you we'll just let the word continue to read us. That's fine. So so this just remind us who is speaking. The apostle Paul, right? So the apostle Paul is saying I I hate this thing. Hey, let's go. Let's let's do this. Like this is not [laughter] like but Paul the apostle the first church age messenger. I remind you in in Revelations chapter 1 we see a vision of Christ and in his hand the the seed of power and authority there are seven stars in that right hand. And one of them is the Apostle Paul who is telling us the things I hate those are the things I'm doing. So maybe next time you find yourself doing something you hate, you can remember that. It's normal. And you [laughter] I'm one of those different preachers, I guess. Maybe sometimes like, no, maybe you weren't expecting a preacher to tell you that when you're doing the thing that you hate, that's actually normal. I didn't say it was good. I didn't say it was righteous. I didn't say it was holy. But I did say it was normal and I and I and Paul is telling us it happens to him too. So So just so that you know, you're not a special kind of sinful if you find yourself in Romans chapter 7 living life doing doing things you hate, not doing things you know you should do and that you do actually want to do and finding yourself just caught between pulled in all these directions screaming out, "God, I am so wretched. How can I get deliverance? God, then I would just like you to know you're normal. &gt;&gt; No, you know what? You're not you're not even normal. You're like, you're living life on the level of the first church age messenger. Man, that's some kind of spiritual there. You never thought you could. It's like, yeah, but could I have done that for my revelation and not for my failures? Praise the Lord. So, but [clears throat] I thought as I'm as I was putting this service, this sermon together and I thought, you know, I I was I was searching for some things on my phone and and I just happened to come across um a text message that I had received from a sister uh quite quite some time ago who was struggling and and she she needed some advice and uh so I just happened to be searching and I just ca I just, you know, randomly came across This probably was the spirit of the Lord driving me to this thing, but it seemed random at the time. And I came across this text message and I thought, Lord, this is just this is so nice. This is really perfect because, you know, we look at this and that which I do I don't allow and I hate and I do and I don't and and and it's just it can it can it can get away from us sometimes because it doesn't really, you know, it just seems so, you know, Paul, break it down a little bit. just make so so this sister uh asking me for this advice, she rewrote Romans 7 without knowing it in 2025 language. And so I thought this would be really good to share and for us to work through and think about a letter from a young sister. Hello, brother Trevor. I'm so and so. I'm sorry for disturbing you. This is something I would like to talk to you about. You see, I have been a Christian my whole life. Three people on that side of the church, man. Everybody else is recent converts. Okay. How many have been a Christian your whole life &gt;&gt; there? Okay. All right. All right. Praise the Lord. Get just don't get comfortable because we're going to like there's about four more times where I'm going to ask you to identify here. Okay. I was born in the message. Okay. Three people, five on that side. Now, okay. That's see when I pause you all because it's obvious that you all haven't heard me preach before. Okay. When I pause and look up that's that's calls pause for effect and that that is now your that is an indication to you that you should respond to that moment. Okay. So now I was born in the message. Okay. Okay. That's f fantastic. And all my life I tried to live a Christian life. Okay. See, that's nice. See, I got baptized at 13 years old in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and I always tried to live how I ought to. Okay? Even if it was 12, 14, somewhere in there, we'll take it. Okay? So, so, so it doesn't even matter who this sister is because this is many of you &gt;&gt; so far. This is actually all of us. Maybe in just some ways this is where we're at. However, I started to go downhill since a few weeks. No, don't raise your hand. Um, there was a Praise the Lord. There was a time I felt far from God because of sin. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you can raise your hand on that one. &gt;&gt; Have you ever felt that way? God, I just, you know, this is me, Lord, you know, and I feel far away from you. And as a matter of fact, I'm pretty much good with that because, you know, I should feel far away from you because of what I've just done. Has anybody ever felt that way? We'll talk about that here in a minute. We'll let her say it. Not me. Um, so I would be ashamed and I would feel too bad to pray and go to church. &gt;&gt; Anybody ever felt that way before? &gt;&gt; Okay. I sinned and did something I knew I could not do. but still did it. Romans 7. &gt;&gt; I can't do that. Let's go. Right. And after doing it, I would feel bad and ask for forgiveness. But then when I'm in the situation again, I would fall again and sin again. Romans 7. What advice would we give? What do we tell someone who's caught in this cycle, who's raised in the message, knows everything that's right, was baptized, had this heart that just God, I just wanted to serve you, and then and then over the process of time found themselves, I don't want to do this thing. I know it's not right, but it's but here we are. What do we tell them? Stinks to be you. So, I pause here so that you know um this is a rhetorical question. If my pastor was here, he'd try to answer. But, you know, the idea is the idea a rhetorical question is that which you're not it's a question you're not really supposed to answer. Uh just it's a it's an English lesson and a sermon. Anyway, um and so and so, you know, but but it is to say that like I want you thinking like what answer would I give? What if one of my friends came to me and began to say, "I need help and this is what I'm struggling with. What is our answer?" And so often, you know what we would say? Well, you know, you need more of the Lord. That's that's I need to read my Bible and pray every exactly. I want to do that every morning. I just don't because Romans 7. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. That's you. I'm going to preach to you all. That's nice. So, all right. I know you need to get away for a while and really strengthen. you need to get away from the situation that you're in because it's causing some problems and uh and you need to really, you know, spend some time strengthening and getting close with the Lord. What you need is you need to go to a church camp. That's what you need. And is that, you know, I mean, would that be nice? Would that be helpful? Like, hey, let's take a week. go, you know, go to meetings, get in the presence of God, get away from the situation you're in. &gt;&gt; Not bad. &gt;&gt; Hey, let's try that. Okay. So, I was hoping I might change at the camp and stop doing what I was doing and become a better Christian and that God would forgive me. So, I prayed and cried and I felt blessed. And anybody ever had this happen to you at camp, right? [laughter] God bless you, brother Trevor. I have never said that from the pulpit before. Ever. It's just so fun. Anyway, and I thought to myself, I am not falling again. I would not permit it to happen again. I felt so good again. But then getting back home, I fell in the same situation again and I sinned again. You don't have to raise your hands. Most of you were nodding that you've been there. I just get angry at myself and cry and I think I should not pray because God has to be upset and I'm scared he would punish me. [snorts] Right. Okay. I just don't know what to do now because I feel so bad that I was blessed at the camp and that God forgave me and now it's like I threw all away by falling and sinning again. Now it's like I try to hide from God. The flesh desires are just strong and I do and I do what I don't want to do. Romans here she is just just Romans 7. I'm doing that thing I don't want to do. Because when I'm in the situation, it feels like I'm not myself and I don't feel bad in the moment. &gt;&gt; This is us. This is every single person in this building. &gt;&gt; This has happened to us time and time again. But when I come back to myself, I start to cry, get angry at myself. Please, could you help me because I'm scared. I get punished by God and he won't give me his blessings because of my attitude. I really don't know what I should do now. Now, maybe you've been here. Maybe you are here. Maybe you are so Romans 7ing right now that you just I mean you are just so tired of the up and down and the altar and the sin and the that which way is up which way is down the devil chirping in your ear. You know the devil loves to use this scripture u when you're when you're in Romans 7. He loves to use this one. See, if you love the world or if you love the Lord, then the love of the world isn't isn't even in you. &gt;&gt; So, uh, and you're doing this thing, so you obviously love it. So, that means the love of the Lord is not even in you. And if it's not in you now, it's I, yeah, you're probably never going to get it. Or maybe just that's the one the devil used on me. Right. Right? And so here you find yourself and now you're screaming out to God, God, I am so wretched. I am such a wretched man. Who is going to deliver me from the body of this death, Lord? Because because frankly, frankly, they, you know, like some people pay to have, you know, you know, in the stained glass or whatever, they they pay for the stained glass and they have, you know, their name etched in it. And it's just like, well, frankly, Lord, I'm planning on paying for a cushion to be installed at my altar, cuz I'm there so often and I'm so tired of it, God. See, it gets a little quiet. And the reason it gets quiet in these kind of moments is nobody's shouting is because everybody's going like, "Oh my goodness, this is me. I've been there. The apostle Paul has been there. &gt;&gt; So, [clears throat] so this is this is the wonderful thing about being a youth leader and about going and preaching youth camps and is you get texts like this that and now you're the guy you got to you know you were about to sister get away to a good camp that'll help you strengthen you a little bit. But inside of her message tells you you can't use that answer. So you got to so so we got to understand then like what is going on and what is the like where do we start? How do we we all right like what is it actually that we're trying to do? What is it that we want to have? And really what we're coming to the answer is is that we want to be righteous. &gt;&gt; We don't want to to do the things that we hate. Why? Because we want to be righteous. We want to be good before God. We want to do the things we want to do. We want to do right things. We don't want to do not right things. That's a double negative, but it worked better. &gt;&gt; Okay. Praise the Lord. Another English. That's fine. Okay. So, so, so, so, but, but what's going on is what we're actually wanting is we're wanting, Lord, I want to be delivered from this. I want, I want to find myself in righteousness. I want to find my body in harmony with with the desires of the inside. you because because we recognize my body is the temple. It is not the Holy Ghost. And that's where we find oursel now, right? Is your body is you find a duality here where it's like I hate this thing. What do you hate this thing with? Well, with the spirit of God and the desires on the inside of me. I hate this thing, but this flesh, &gt;&gt; it's not the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; but the Holy Ghost is inside it, &gt;&gt; but it's pulled. It's drawn. It needs to die daily, &gt;&gt; right? Right. Somebody's got to do that. That's hard. Takes a lot of work. So, the idea then is righteousness. And so, well, so that's that's interesting. So, okay, how do we get from Romans 7 into righteousness? maybe that's actually our question that we're dealing with. And so I I I sent her a text message and and I I replied and I said, "Is I want you to read this quote every day for the next two weeks. And I want you to read Romans 5 through8." And so and and I I didn't send her this quote to tell her to read it every day for two weeks because, you know, it's some kind of mantra she should say and repeat to herself and that will somehow deliver you and drive demons away. And none of that. No. No, it wasn't that. It was because I wanted the word of God to saturate her heart. &gt;&gt; This is the quote I sent. 560414 blind Barnameus. Now, God will never judge you for being a sinner. &gt;&gt; Well, that's nice. &gt;&gt; But he should. No, but he's never going to. I don't care what you think about it. I don't care how badly you think you should be judged. &gt;&gt; God will never [screaming] judge you for being a sinner. He can't judge you because sin was paid for at Calvary. And you're not a sinner. You are a rejector. See, he judges you for rejecting salvation when it's been offered to you. But G when he saw him, he said, "Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world." You have to ask yourself a question. Was John right or not? &gt;&gt; Because if John was right, then the lamb of God took away the sins of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Either the lamb of God did or the lamb of God didn't. Which one is it for you? &gt;&gt; And all sin question was settled &gt;&gt; at Calvary. &gt;&gt; I wanted her to read this every day for two weeks. All sin question was settled at Calvary. Your sin question is part of all. So we'll just say it that way. Your sin question was settled at Calvary. When you get home and you look in the mirror tonight, maybe you should look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself, "All of my sin question was settled at Calvary. My sin question was settled at Calvary. G the the lamb of God took away the sins of the world. &gt;&gt; The lamb of God took away my sin. Should I want to accept it? You see, it comes down to, do you have faith to accept in these moments that God took away your sin? No matter how good you are at it, no matter how bad you are at it, he took it away anyway from before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Did he know you? At what point in your life did he know you from before the foundation of the world? [laughter] You see, you see God. Oh, this one's fresh. God, you know, we like like think about this though. Before the foundation of the world, what like what did he see about you? What did he know about you? You know, this is part of the problem of our Instagram and you know, snappy chat. Yeah, I know. I know. But it it makes me sound old when I'm not actually that old and so and then the youth grown at that. Anyway, but my sons hate it. But anyhow, you know, it's because we have these, you know, and then we have these filters and we do all of these things, right? And we present an image before everybody else that we want everyone to see. And of course, it's the same way with God, right? Like before the foundation of the world, he saw what I wanted him to see. It's like we like Yeah. It sounded dumb when I said it, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's No. Like, of course not. No. No. He saw you on your best day and Yes. That's what we It's like God, you saw me on my best day and that's why you left me. No. He saw you on your worst day and still decided to die on the cross for you. &gt;&gt; And here's the thing. Your worst day m may may not have happened yet, but he still died for you anyway. He still took away the sins of the world. &gt;&gt; And the sin question was settled at Calvary. So God knew all of this from before the foundation of the world. This isn't new to him. He's not he's just like, "Oh man, you know, Daniel, [sighs] like we're at we're at six times. If you get to seven, I'm going to have to rethink my dying for you on Calvary because that's just extreme. But yeah, brother Trevor, you're talking about seven times. I was like, and then Peter came and said, "How many times should I forgive my brother?" 70* 7. And oh, wow. It's like 490. It's like, well, okay. So the statute of limitations on God forgiving you of sins must be around 490 as well then. But woe be unto you if you get to 491. Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world of all those who do it less than 490 times is not what the scripture says but is exactly what we think in our minds isn't it isn't after after we fall after we fail and we find ourselves just flat in the dirt we're sitting there going it's over for me &gt;&gt; I can't it'sm no like God couldn't do it for me cuz cuz I'm I'm a special kind of bad. I've gone over the limitations. How does he think these thoughts that I've had? Cuz I've had them. &gt;&gt; We all have had them. This is all of us. And we all find ourselves right here just hanging out with the Apostle Paul. And if the Apostle Paul would be sitting here, he'd just be like, I know, right? I mean, that's what I was that's what I was writing about. Drives me nuts. She responded, "This helped me a lot. I was worried because I felt like I would throw the grace of God away by sinning again and again. And I really need God's help and the strength to resist the desires of the flesh. Oh, I I will stop here for just a moment because what another thing that I I started to tell her is like, you know, you you you used to feel like, you know, it was so easy to serve the Lord when you were younger. You know, it was just like, man, I love the Lord. I love serving the Lord, you know, and then you, you know, and then the teenage years came and just smacked you upside the head. And then, you know, because everything used to be black and white and now like there's black and there's white, but there's a whole lot of gray in between now. &gt;&gt; And that's good and we want it that way. But that's another sermon because if everything was just black and white, you could be a legalist and and think you have a relationship with God. Okay. Anyway, I don't know if that landed or not, but that sounds lame to me and I don't want that. And that's not what this message is proclaiming is that God has, you know, things that he wants you to do and things that he doesn't want you to do and you can just can you just do that? No, that's Baptist. That's that's just Baptist theology. And if you don't do it, you're going to hell. [sighs] Or if you do too much of this, you're going to hell. It's like that's Christianity, right? No. No. Not [laughter] when not when he's coming and saying I want a bride. &gt;&gt; When he comes and says I want a bride and by the way when he comes in the book of revelation to say I want a bride what that does and that gets revealed to us what that does is it makes manifest the idea that before the foundation of the world that's always what God wanted anyway. So he was never, you know, he was never some, you know, mean looking old guy sitting on a throne waiting to punish you for your sins. No, he was always the one that wants you to be his bride. &gt;&gt; That's who he always was. That's what his heart always was. That's what this message is telling us. Amen. And so, so I began to tell her, anyway, that's on grace. But anyway, I began to, you know, I I was telling her it's like, and so you got into this gray zone because as you got older, you know, your brain starts developing and all these, you know, hormones and chemicals and all these things start happening in your brain and now it's a lot harder to make decisions because the world has become a whole lot bigger and and your and your and your desires and your you know, your passions got a whole lot [clears throat] bigger and praise God for that. You know, I mean, how many of you want to live with no passion? Oh, so God gave it to you for a for a wonderful purpose and the devil's just trying to hijack it then. &gt;&gt; Okay, so praise the Lord. So that's kind of what I began to explain to her. She said, "Growing and becoming more mature, I started seeing and realizing that things are different as they used to be or it gets more complicated. Now I'm 19 years old and I wish I could just be the same Christian girl I was about three years ago." Anybody ever feel that way? I'd just like to tell you you are. Maybe you don't feel like it, but you are. I just want to be the same girl again that was so close to the Lord and so innocent. I'm mad at myself and sometimes I look in the mirror and speak bad at myself. Does anybody want No, don't raise your hand. I'd just like to ask you, those of you who do this kind of thing, and that's probably 90%. What scripture is that? What scripture is that? You know, thou shalt speak bad at thyself in the mirror after thine has transgressed the commandments. Does does Jesus need your help saving you? &gt;&gt; Does he need your help taking away your sin? &gt;&gt; Do we maybe we call the sister to the piano and we can we can begin to sing that old song, you know, Jesus paid it some to him I owe. Sin has left a crimson stain. I'll tell myself how bad I am. That'll help. You're welcome. Because now you're going to remember that song the next time you look in the mirror to speak bad at yourself. You're going to be like, "I'm an idiot." [laughter] [clears throat] Thank you, brother Trevor. Thank you, Lord, for Brother Trevor. This one, not that one. We thank the Lord for him, too, but for different reason. [laughter] this. That's fun. Anyway, I just think the Lord has to be so upset at me and I feel a little lost. I feel I'm not worthy of reading my Bible or praying. It's just hard to get back to God after sinning and I really don't want to fall again. I am also scared that God will punish me. I pray I'll pray and I would appreciate you if you could also pray for me. God bless. So, this is this is the response. This is this this initial question and my response to her and her response after that. And we begin to see some things from this letter. And remember, all I'm trying to do is present just in modern language someone who basically rewrote Romans 7 from her own perspective. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. Okay. And so, so, but here's some things that we find that I found in her letter, and I thought this is what we should deal with. One of the things she's trying to say here is, "My sin is probably greater than Jesus can forgive because I've known better than to do this for years." Anybody ever believed that lie? Yeah, but my sin I mean, you all like, you know, I I mean, I hate to be arrogant, but you all aren't as good at sinning as I am. And I know better. And I don't know about you, like your revelation isn't mine, you know, but I'm just saying I know better like like you're some special kind of sinner and that Jesus has to deal with you differently than he's going to deal with everybody else because of some special quality that you possess. So, not only are you failing, but you're also adding arrogance to your failures. See, that's Isn't that nice? Okay. Or lie number two. Even after my first sin, I repented and told God I wouldn't do it again. Then I fell again. I obviously don't have God in me. Does that what does that what it sound is? Does that what Paul's version of Romans 7 sound like? I don't have God. Like I realize when I'm doing things I hate, I just don't have God in me. And I've got to repent, get the baptism of the Holy Spirit all over again. And I got to go back to the Damascus road. I got to see the light again. I got to get healed from blindness again. I got to go back out into the desert, get three more years of revelation, and then maybe I'll do this better. [laughter] So, so what's our answer to these things? How do we brother Trevor, okay, you know, you're kind of, you know, pay you have identified the problem, brother Trevor. Thank you. Okay. God bless you. You're dismissed. We No. No. Maybe there's more here. Maybe we should. Is there What's the Where do we start then, Brother Trevor? How can we break out of this cycle? How can we How can we be better? How can we find how can we find ourselves standing in righteousness and dwelling in righteousness? Okay, that's a great question. So, what our answer for these lies usually is, and we've already discussed it with Paul a little bit, is to law better. you know, isn't this, you know, and and here, let's let's just take just two minutes and talk about, you know, like what addiction looks like in 2025 because this is really what we're talking about is is addiction, right? Like like the things that I I I all things are lawful, but I don't want to be brought under the power of any, which means it's an addiction that is pulling me into a and I'm now that's why I'm doing something. I hate this thing, but I'm doing it. Why? because there's an addictive nature because again the flesh is not the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; right? And so and so your flesh is not the Holy Ghost, right? So so so there are things that will pull on it and try to addict you to it. And so back in, you know, the days of Y, you know, there was, you could tell if anybody was addicted to something because there was there was tobacco, there was drugs, there was alcohol, there was there was there was something outside of them that they were addicted to and you could just tell. But now science has learned what what has learned the science of of addiction and how it works and they've now taken all of these principles and they learned it through gambling and then they put it into pornography and then they put it into your social media &gt;&gt; and all of these things and and they've learned how to addict you how your brain works to to give you that you've you've probably heard you know when I was 20 years old the word dopamine I'd have been like what oh is this some new drug and it's like know it's a drug humans have had for all of their lives, right? But you all are probably very familiar with that word. How many? Anybody? Dopamine. You've heard it. You know, you've heard dopamine. Not you, him. How old are you? You're 13. You You've already know. You know what dopamine is. You understand. It's dopamine. It's this thing that goes off in your brain that says, "That was cool. I want to do that again." Do you know God gave us dopamine? &gt;&gt; We think of it as something bad because the devil has tried to hijack it through modern science to to to addict you and pull you into things. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. And so here we find ourselves with with with the m with the machine of all of this industry and all of these, you know, and and the devil and all of these things. And so we find ourselves though we're we're we we don't in our heart have any any bad purpose or any bad idea, but yet we we just thought I I'm going to go look at pictures of my friends. And then suddenly, like, you know, three hours later and now I put my phone down and I and I &gt;&gt; How many times do you pick up your phone at the stoplight? Oh, &gt;&gt; maybe I should have started with that one. Got everybody on the same page. You laugh because it's true. Right. Right. So, you're finding yourself. There's an there's an there's an attachment. There's a I can't stop myself. I think about No, not going to do it. [laughter] God protect my screen from myself. Right. So, so you find yourself sometimes you're like you're like pulled down these avenues and you you don't even, you know, it's like I don't I know I know better. I hate this thing. I don't want to do this thing, but I'm I'm pulled by this thing and I never intended to ever get here and I'm pulled by this thing. And then I think God, you know, forgive me. And you come to the altar on your your paid for cushion and you're like, God, forgive me. I'm so sorry. And you get back up and you're like [sighs] this time. Hang on. I've got it now. I will not do that thing. I'm not doing that thing right now. I'm not doing that thing. So, our answer is so often I got to law better. I got to really like, okay, what? Here's what I got to do. I got to really understand how bad this is. And when I understand how bad this is, I'll just be more depressed after I do it again. &gt;&gt; Did it help? You've done. We've all done these things. We've all lived this way. We've all struggled with this. We've all looked in the mirror and told, "You're so stupid. tape the law to our wind, you know, to the thing and it never helped, right? &gt;&gt; Okay. So, okay, I'll stop here. I'll I'll add this little personal I I don't know what point in time I usually add this, but you know, [clears throat] God can deliver us. &gt;&gt; I mean, isn't Paul just saying, "Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" Right? And there are times I was actually just speaking in Kansas, there was a brother and I was like, "Wow, this is so cool to see like so much in like wrapped up in one person." And uh I mean that in the best way. But you know, he when he when the Lord when he first came to the Lord, God took away smoking. God took away just man just bam just took it away right but then the things God didn't take he struggled with &gt;&gt; until like he had been away from the Lord not smoking not drinking but away from the Lord until the last two years and the Lord has been bringing him and drawing him through this process and he's getting better at these other things but he was delivered supernaturally from some things but not from other Why does God do that? Well, there's many reasons sometimes. One is just it's like because he wants to say, "Blessed is the overcomer." And as the prophet tells us, he doesn't stick you in one end of the pipe and pull you out the other and say, "Blessed is the overcomer cuz you did nothing." And you want it to be that way because you want to grow in character because your character is the thing that you're going to take with you. And wouldn't it be nice to actually have some when you get to the promised land? It's like, "Oh, wonderful. You're here in the millennium with zero character. We're so happy you're here. So, so, [clears throat] so these trials are actually doing something. These pulls that are taking you down avenues you know you shouldn't go down are actually now investing in you a struggle that is teaching you a lot about who you are a lot about who he is. I tell you what, who who who better to to praise God for his grace to you than someone who feels they need it so deeply. &gt;&gt; I mean, you know, I was raised in a pretty good home. You know, we were pretty good at being good. Come on, somebody. Right. But there's others that are not so good at being good. Don't worry, I'm going to bring that part back around. So, don't think it's pride because we'll talk about that. But but but there's others who are just like, but their connection with the grace of God, their love for God, their their heart for him because they recognize the strength of his grace. Oh my. And there they are in the millennium now going, "I shouldn't be here. You're amazing. You are the greatest God ever. &gt;&gt; How do I know? Cuz I'm here." &gt;&gt; What does that say? That means he is the like the fact that I am here is a testimony to who he is. &gt;&gt; Because he's the most amazing, loving, gracegiving God there ever could have been thought of. And it's known because I am here, &gt;&gt; you know. And so God can deliver you from some things, but some things he's gonna you're going to deal with these things. You're going to struggle with these things to know about his grace, to know about who you are, to know to to to wrestle with your own self. &gt;&gt; And sometimes you could be praying for deliverance and God won't give it to you. And you'll look in the book of James and you'll see that you know you you have not because you ask not because you ask a miss and God won't give it to you if you ask a miss to consume it upon your lusts. That's the book of James. And then you're like well Lord I am praying for deliverance. How is this? H like like maybe you could say, "Well, okay, we're just going to leave that down now." Now, maybe you could say like, "Lord, I am actually trying to be delivered from lust. So, I'm going to pray to be delivered from lust, but I'm asking a miss to consume it upon my lusts." Now, that's a headscratcher. But sometimes we don't recognize what's going on in our own hearts. And so, I was going through something. And I thought, God, I I I I that scripture came to mind. And I thought, this is exactly the conversation I had. God, I I want to be delivered from this thing for you. And and Lord, if I if you deliver me for this, like, think of how I could help others. My ministry is just starting, Lord, and if you deliver me and I can tell others how they could be delivered as well. If I go through that experience, I can tell them about how how that works, Lord. And you know what that would have looked like? That would have been like, I mean, I prayed. God delivered me. &gt;&gt; What's your problem? You need to be delivered. Oh, &gt;&gt; just want you to know God can do it. He did it through me. &gt;&gt; You just be like me and what what you And so God God said, "You know what? In my grace, I'm gonna let you stew in that problem &gt;&gt; because I'm not going to deliver you from that problem only to addict you to your own pride &gt;&gt; only to give you a worse problem. &gt;&gt; Right? So sometimes God knows our hearts and and wants to reveal himself to us. And this is why we should be reading our Bible and praying. Not so that we can check the Christian box, but so that we can be in a in a place where we're meditating upon who he is, that he can that he can do and and work in our own lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. So, the answer isn't always law better. So, then what is the answer? Let's let's back up and let's go to Romans 7. Wait, we're already there. Verse one. Know ye not, brethren, for I speak to them to that know the law, how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth. For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth. But if the husband be dead, she's loose from the law of her husband. So then, if while her husband liveth, she'll be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress. But if her husband be dead, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. Wait, why did we all of a sudden get into marriage and divorce? Like, like, wait a second, Paul. like okay Romans 1 like people didn't know God so God gave them up to their own vile affections and then Paul you start taking us through grace and then you know we get some beautiful scriptures you know in in Romans you know shall we continue in sin that grace may abound God forbid we get the scripture that's um what Romans 6:23 um it is the gift of God you know salvation is the gift of God that scripture you haven't memorized from Sunday school it's been just a long time for me and then and then um you know so lovely scriptures like that and then we get to Romans 7:1 and Paul's like hold up I'm going to stop talking about grace for a moment um I need to inject three verses here on marriage and divorce so that in 2025 message believers can take marriage and divorce and they can take some scriptures from Matthew what Jesus says and they can take Romans 7 1-3 and they can put them all in their marriage and divorce files so they can understand marriage and divorce and now back to our regularly scheduled programming [clears throat] Or is he still talking about grace? &gt;&gt; He's still talking about grace. &gt;&gt; If her husband be dead, she's free from what? The law. She's free from the law, so that she's no adulteress, though she be married to another man. Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ, that ye should be married to another, even to him who raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. So even when you were married to the law and you were trying to do the things of the law, the only fruit it could bring of that union of being you and and the law being married together was the fruit of death. But now, because Christ came and and and put to the death to to put to death the law on the cross, &gt;&gt; you are no longer married to the law. You can now be married to another, which is the grace of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you're married to Jesus Christ in his grace, that we should bring forth fruit unto God, living fruit, good fruit. Right? So verse six, now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve a newness of spirit and not the oldness of letter. Romans 7, Paul is transitioning us from the law into living in the spirit. because in Romans 8, you're going to start seeing him talking about living a spiritfilled life, right? And so you can probably read that later. So, so what we're seeing here is because our answer was was law better. Not that that's the right answer, but that's the answer we always do. We fail, we get up, we try to law better within ourselves because we think that's what God wants. He wants me to be better like some Baptist theology. God wants me to be good. God wants you to be bride. He wants you to be relational. And if you're going to be relational, you're not some robot that just does the right things, but you're someone who has had experiences in their life that that you can now relate with someone else. And so God God is transitioning us into that spiritfilled life. But our answer of law better is no longer the answer because the law was put to death by Jesus Christ. You're no longer married to the law, but you're married to him in his resurrection, in his grace. &gt;&gt; And so now, oh, but wait, I'm still pulled. I still come down these things and I shouldn't do these things. Ah, yes. I need to lo I Hey, old husband, you and I need to have a little discussion here before I go come back to this new husband. Do you see what we're doing? You see what Paul is presenting to us? That law was put to death. You don't go back to that. You don't need to go back to that. That that that is gone. That is that is divorced. is dead. It brought no fruit. But now here you have a new husband, &gt;&gt; the grace of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But then, brother Trevor, so when I fail and I I go down this and I feel I'm an idiot and I come back and you know how long should I stay at the altar, then if I'm no longer married to the law? And of course, as we all know, the law dictates depending on the infraction what you've done. You know, I mean, you know, for looking at pornography, you know, that's an hour and a half at the altar. Lying to your parents 20 minutes at the altar should be good. You should feel cleansed by then, you know. Okay, then brother Trevor, if I'm divorced from that, if that if that old union is gone, what does this new union say? What is my part? What what then do I do? Shouldn't I do something? Well, you should be married to your husband. Grace, &gt;&gt; the grace of Jesus Christ, brothers, forever. Like, okay, but I mean, I'm not saying you don't feel sorry. I'm not saying you don't feel stupid. If you can figure out how to fall up flat on your face and not feel stupid, come tell me. I want to know. &gt;&gt; I don't like it. But how long does it take to repent and receive the grace of Jesus Christ? Thank you, &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; Here I am again. I did it again. Thank you. I'm married to grace. Now, of course, I don't continue in sin that I can prove how great grace is. But but God, I have I have fallen and your grace is just as strong as it was yesterday when I was a good little boy or a good little girl. But now, your grace your grace abounds already. It didn't take me 30 seconds. It didn't take me 30 minutes. It didn't take two hours to receive the grace. It was already free. It was already given to me. And the moment I come up off of falling flat on my face, I am already forgiven &gt;&gt; because God never desired for me to be punished for that thing because he took the punishment already. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so, but this is rewriting this is rewriting our minds because we've been we've been we've been we've been married to the law for so long that we continue to react to our old husband when we have a new. &gt;&gt; So, now you're living in grace. But what do I do? What like how does that how does that solve this problem? Well, I can tell you what what's not solving the problem. What's not solving the problem is going back to the law &gt;&gt; because you're the grace of God is received by faith. So, you're going to need faith, right? So, let's go to Romans 4. Let's back up just a little bit more and we'll try to bring this to a close because my timer says four minutes and that whatever had I don't know what that had, but it's blinking at me now. I And I've knocked this thing over a million times. So, well, that's just a clock. Okay. Romans 4. I'll take off my coat just because I'm hot, not because I'm just getting ready to start preaching. [laughter] Okay. What shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh is found? For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God. So if you can figure out how to do it married to the law, you can glory before men, but not before God. &gt;&gt; For what sayaith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him &gt;&gt; for righteous. Isn't that what we're trying to do? I don't want to go down these paths and be stupid and do the things I want righteous. &gt;&gt; Abraham believed God and it was counted for Was he always righteous? But because he believed God, God saw him as righteous. Let's move forward to verse 18. Who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, so shall thy seed be. And being not weak in the flesh in faith, he considered not his own body now dead. when he was about a 100 years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb, he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully persuaded that what he had promised, he was also able to perform, and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; So here Abraham is, he's a he's a hundred years old, okay? He's 98. Melzdc comes says hey the promised son is coming and Abraham's like now like Sarah laughs in the tent why because Abraham's like Lord have you seen these wrinkles my Lord I mean I appreciate it I appreciate your promise for me I appreciate you saying that in my life and the life of my wife, we can bring forth the promised fruit that you have all always promised us for so long. I appreciate that you say that, but Lord, my have you seen my flesh? Have you seen how weak this flesh is, Lord? How is this weak flesh going to produce your son? You begin to see the metaphor we're drawing here, right? How many of you feel like you have ab like Abraham, you think you've got weak flesh? Have you seen mine? But Abraham didn't consider his the weakness of his body, nor the deadness of Sarah's womb, but he was strong in faith. And so what God counted it to him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; It was his faith in what God could do that made him righteous. Brother Trevor, I fell flat on my face yesterday. Do you believe the grace of God for that? It is counted to you for righteousness. Do you want to be righteous? &gt;&gt; Be married to grace. Be married to Jesus Christ. Actually believe what we're taught about these things. Because here's the idea. And I I there's a there's probably a hundred other sermons I could do after this. We could talk about self-control. We could talk about putting up borders. We could talk about accountability. We could talk about all kinds of things that are things that are there to help you &gt;&gt; to to to to grow, to strive to mature. I mean, just maturing, you know, just straight up maturity that you will get by nature will help you so much. God bless you. May you mature that will you will just you'll have more grace for yourself. But there's all kinds of things that we could probably do because we want to do them. But if they aren't starting because we believe in the grace of God and we have faith, faith is our platform. And if we do not if we do not have a platform of faith to believe the grace of God, you are going to be up and down and up and down and get so mad at yourself and think, why am I trying? Maybe the devil's right. I can't do it. I my body I my body can't do it. And it and and what if Abraham would have done that? What does the how does the Bible read? If Abraham says, "You know what? Hey, Melchisedc, I appreciate that, man. I really do, but Sarah and I have been trying for 24 years to make this promise come." And I just I'm just at the point where I I just don't think it's going to happen, you know? I mean, what's what's going to be different about my body, Lord? What can I do to make my body more fruitful to bring forth a promised son? MCDz would be like, "That's why I'm here." And isn't that exactly just what Jesus is trying to say to you today? You who were caught in Romans 7, you who are up and down and up and down and struggling and striving is he's saying, "But I'm here now. But I'm here." Can you believe that I'm here and I'm here for you? Not only do I give you my grace, but I am grace &gt;&gt; here with you. I am that strength. Your body, your body hasn't figured it out yet who I am, but it will. If you can believe that I am here with you. All I'm asking is that you accept that I am here with you. Now, now, now if you you know this might scare some legalists, but this is the grace of God. This is this is this is what go God God the the God who is saying I want you to be my bride. That kind of love gives us this kind of grace that I don't care. I don't care what you've done, how many times you've done it, how many times you've repented, how many times you've looked in the mirror and told yourself how bad you are. Melzdc comes along and Melzdc has come in our day &gt;&gt; and said, "I am here." &gt;&gt; And there is enough power in this word, in this message, if we should so choose to believe it, that will deliver us from all of these things. Because you say, "Brother Trevor, you you don't you don't you Yeah, I fail every day. Me and Paul die daily. Me and Paul trying not to be brought under the power of any." Right. Right. That's just a human experience. &gt;&gt; But because Melzdc is here, you don't have to consider your body as being dead. You don't have to consider yourself as being worthless. You don't have to consider yourself as someone who could never do it, who could never be a Christian, who simply isn't good enough, who has tried a million times and failed. And how is tomorrow going to be different? It depends on is Melchzdc here? &gt;&gt; And he is &gt;&gt; and he's here for you. So you don't have to consider the weakness of your own flesh, such as it is to produce Jesus Christ within that flesh. And that's exactly what God wants to do is to produce Jesus Christ in your body. &gt;&gt; Daniel, he wants to be Daniel's version of Jesus Christ. What would Jesus Christ look like if he was in that that body? Exactly what he's doing. We're not going to make Daniel, you know, change his hairstyle to be the same hairstyle Jesus had. Stop wearing Nikes. Put on sandals. Like, start acting like Jesus, man. No, no, no. I tell you what, Daniel, you just let the word of God come into your heart. Let it permeate you and saturate you and let it let you like not not not that it's works anymore, but now you're starting to recognize this is truth from all ages. And this is the best way to live. This is the most fulfilling. There's more joy in this. There's more love in this. There's more hope in this. There's more peace in this. And you just let that word come in and begin to change your life. And suddenly people are like, I thought that was Jesus for a moment. &gt;&gt; Then I realized it was just Daniel. Pretty sure it's just Daniel. But it's not just Daniel, is it? Even if just Daniel fell yesterday because of the grace of God today, it's not just Daniel. The word of God living in Daniel. I don't I'm not We're not looking We're not looking at the deadness of his flesh, at the weakness of his flesh. We're looking at Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We're married to a new husband. because that husband &gt;&gt; put the law to death for us. So just finish maybe with a quote here from a guide. Musicians, why don't you come? Peter was led to say on Acts 238 how to receive the Holy Ghost. He said, "Repent every one of you. Then he baptized you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and then the guide will take you from there on." &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the thing to do. First repent of your sins. Amen. You got to be converted. None of this was talking about becoming converted. This was assuming you already had a converted heart. I mean, if you're just, you know, man, I'm going down these roads I absolutely want to go down. Okay, you need a conversion. &gt;&gt; I'm doing these things I don't want to. Something in me has changed. Well, that's different then, right? You've disbelieved these things. Repent. Be baptized. And then the guide will take you from there on. See, that's your duty. It's your duty to repent. Your duty to be baptized. It's the guide's duty to take you from there on. &gt;&gt; Amen. I &gt;&gt; think he said that three times. Lead you from virtue to knowledge, temperance to patience, godliness, brotherly love. The Holy Ghost seals you. See, then you're a full stature of God. A real man of God, a real woman of God, anchored away in Christ. I love that. Anchored away in Christ. [clears throat] So, this is the grace of God. I'm going to need the song leader to come. If you don't mind, brother, why don't you come and uh you can sing back me up here, bro, because this is done. But we find ourselves right here in Romans chapter 7. But there's no reason to feel despair. There's no reason to feel like you can't do it. And there's every reason to just believe. The grace of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; is poured out so freely upon you. And the Holy Spirit will take you from there on. Shall we pray? Heavenly Father, you see who we are, where we are. Lord, you know our failures. You know our faults. You know how frail our own flesh, which is not the Holy Ghost, but just the temple of the Holy Ghost. Lord, you you see how it gets in the way so often. But God, you have come and you've said the time of the promise is nigh and you gave us of your grace. You gave us your love. Oh Lord, how good it is. How good it is. Father, I pray Lord God that your Holy Spirit would come and witness to the heart of every young person, every elderly person that came that you would that you would speak personally to them and witness the truth of your grace to each one. May you be glorified in receiving that which you purchased on the cross, Lord God. May you be praised for that which you did on the cross, Lord God. Oh Lord, may we just accept that wave [snorts] of grace and love for us. We ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. I'm glad you see through eyes of love. A hopeless case in an empty [singing] place. If not for grace, where would I be? Oh, where would [singing] I be? You only know. I'm glad you see through eyes [singing] of love. A hopeless case an empty [music and singing] place if not for grace. Oh [singing] amazing [music] grace, how sweet the sound. I [music] once [singing] was lost. But now I'm found a hopeless [singing] case. An empty place if not for grace. Amazing grace, oh amazing grace, [music and singing] how sweet the sound. [music] I once was lost, [singing] but now I'm a hopeless place in empty place. If not your grace, oh precious Lord, [singing and music] please take my hand and lead me up and help me stand [music] and as they continue to to [music] play that. If you're here this morning and those words resonated with you and you would like to have prayer, special prayer, I would uh not leave here um without letting our brother pray for you. And um I'm going to give you that opportunity to come forward and pray. Brother Trevor is available for that and the altar is open and we want you to really take advantage of those words in Romans 7. It's a powerful word. I thank God for it. We are living under the grace of almighty God. He loved us better when we couldn't law better. It was his love and his grace that came upon us. It's by his grace that we're saved today. Amen. So, we'll sing that. And if you have need for prayer, why don't you just come right up to the front? Our brother will pray for you. Oh precious Lord, [music] please take my hand and lead me on and let me stand. Hopeless case, empty place [music] if not [singing] for grace. Precious Lord, precious [music] Lord, [singing] take my hand and lead me. Let's all stand to our feet. Let me stand. A hopeless case, an empty place if not for grace. [singing and music] Where would I be? Where would I be? [music] You only know. So glad [music] you see through eyes [singing] of love. Hopeless case, [music] an empty place. [singing] If not for Amen. If the brothers can help him pray, precious [music] Lord, yes Lord Jesus, [music] oh let me stand praise [music] not Lord, where would I be? Where would [singing] I be?
