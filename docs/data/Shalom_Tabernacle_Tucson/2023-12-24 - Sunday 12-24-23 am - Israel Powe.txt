========================================

[Music] [Applause] [Music] e [Music] [Music] [Music] e [Music] good morning let's all stand we'll go to our adult Sunday School portion of the service we're in the first seal uh paragraph 233 to 294 just a few moments of that and um scripture reading is found in Revelations chapter 6 if You' like to turn there reading amen Let's uh bow our heads for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for bringing us together once again Lord we ask your blessings on the service Lord speak to our hearts through the word of God today Lord we commit the service into your find care bless the songs of Zion Lord the word that will be preached and our worship to thee father we ask these blessings in jesus' name and we thank you amen amen and I saw when the lamb had opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer amen we sing only believe amen only [Music] believe only be all things are possible oh only be only only all things are possible only be God bless you you may be seated brother randam now we Roman Calendar has we got 28 days and sometimes 30 and 31 but actual the calendar reads this 30 days to every month right and take aund 1,23 score days and put 30 to it and see what you got three and one a half years that's Zach on the dot that's the time that's lotted time for the Messiah message to be preached to Israel like it was back there when he returns back and makes himself known in the symbol that when he come when Joseph was taken down into the country and was rejected by his Brethren because he was a spiritual man he could see visions and interpret dreams and when he did he was taken down into the country and was sold for almost 30 pieces of silver he portrayed Christ exactly because it Christ Spirit me notice what happened there and notice that when he did this he was put in the prison and one man was saved and the other lost exactly Jesus when he was in prison on the cross one Thief was saved and was lost exactly throwed into the grave supposed to be dead and was tuck up and ascended to the right hand of pharaoh that nobody could see Pharaoh without seeing Joseph first Jesus sets at the right hand of God and no man can come to the father except for the son I notice every time Joseph left when Joseph rose up from that right hand of that Throne watch Glory there set Joseph at the right hand of pharaoh and when Joseph raised up to leave that Throne the trumpet sounded bow to e everybody Joseph is coming when that lamb leaves the throne y on his days of M Toral work when he leaves the throne up there and takes that book of redemption and walks forth every KN [Applause] bow there he is notice and when Joseph rejected by his Brethren he was given a gentile wife poner giving or Pharaoh giv him a a gentile wife and he bore Gentile children half Gentile and Jew they give a great symbol of when Jacob was blessing him Ephraim on one side Manasses on the other he crossed his hand and give the younger child the blessing and the two kids was added unto the 12 tribes which is only 10 at that time and he blessed them in Jacob himself and Joseph his Prophet son standing there said father you have done wrong said you put your right hand blessing on the young child where ought to went on the old and he said I know my hands is crossed but God has crossed them why Israel having the rights to be a bride rejected and sold her birthrights and the went from the old son Israel to the new Gentile and the blessings went from there through the [Applause] cross but notice after that see through that when all he had took his bride but when them boys came down to buy food oh it's such a beautiful I'm off of the seal but I just got to say it CU you'll get the picture better I believe notice how when he come down to buy food you know Joseph recognized him right away and Joseph was the son of prosperity no matter where he went it all Place prospered you wait till he comes to the Earth again wait till our Joseph come the desert shall Blossom as a rose and the sun ofous rises with healing in his wings all that Cactus around Arizona will unfold into a beautiful tree to be beautiful notice Harry comes forth and he plays a little trick on him there and he stands and he says is my father still living see you won't know if that boy's father was living he said yes he know that was his brother but did you notice when he got ready to reveal himself to his brother and he found little Benjamin which had been born since he had been gone and that represents these Jews there 144,000 scn right there now than he been gone amen and when he returned he said he looked at Benjamin his heart was about to break and remember they they didn't know he could speak Hebrew he was taking an interpreter he act like he's an Egyptian and then when it was made known he wanted to make himself known he kept looking at little Benjamin and remember he dismissed his wife she was in the palace when he made himself known to his brethren and the Gentile bride the wife after Jesus being rejected by his own people he has taken a gentile bride and will take her from here to the Palace to his father's house in glory for the wedding supper and will slip back down to make himself known to his Brethren [Applause] 14 there he stands and remember look at the symbol perfectly and when he come back the where this why he looked down to them and he said uh he said uh begin to look and they begin to talk they said uh now Reuben you know that we're in for it now see because you know what we done we got this boy in this fix now we ar to sold our brother that was your brother standing there that Mighty Prince and they didn't know it that's the reason Israel can't understand him today and there isn't the hour yet to know it and then he they thought he he couldn't understand Hebrew but he's listening right at him they said now we're in for and Joseph when he looked at him he couldn't stand it no longer I remember his wife and children was in the palace at the time the Saints gone out out of the prison and he said I'm Joseph your brother and he run over and grabbed the Lan fell on his neck and began to cry and he made himself know and then he said now we know we got coming for we sold him we was the one who sold him off we was the one who tried to kill him now we know he'll kill us he said no don't be angry with yourself you only done it to preserve life that's why God sent me down here and when he makes himself known the Bible said as we come to it when he makes himself known to that 144,000 there the little Benjamin of the day and the REM of those Jews left there when he makes himself knowing the they'll say where did you get those scars that's right what are they doing in your hand he say oh I got them in the house of my friend oh then they'll realize that they have killed the Messiah but what will he say the same as Joseph did it you did it to serve life don't save life don't be angry with yourself because if the Gentiles would not have been brought in if the Jews hadn't done that blindfolded trick so he saved the life of the church for the things that they've done so there you that's the reason today they can't understand this it isn't the hour no more we can understand these things until the time comes for it to be understood Lord oh my seven thunders of Revelations may show the bride how to prepare for the great translation Faith now let's hurry up because we haven't got about 15 20 minutes yet now what does this white horse mean let me read the I've been so far off excuse me for getting off my subject but U uh I'll read the verse again the two verses and I saw when the lamb had opened one of the seals and I heard as it was a noise of thunder and one of the four be saying come see and I saw and behold a white horse now we're going to the second verse a white horse and he that sat on him had a bowl and a crown was given him he didn't have it then unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer that's all of that that's the seal now let's find the symbols we found what the thunder means that's perfectly we know that see the Thunder was a voice of God when the seal open now what does a white horse mean I here's where the Revelation com I'm just as positive of this as I'm standing here knowing this is the word I've read every book on it I could find and with uh I the last time and I was trying I had to go through it just teaching it about 30 years ago I took the book somebody had told me that the Adventist had more light on the second coming of Christ than any people that they know so I found some of their good books to read I got Smith's book on Daniel Revelations and he said this white horse that went forth was white and it symbolized a conqueror and in this conquering many of you Adventist bre here knows the book many of you others also about reading it and um Nows I read two or three uh read I can't call there two more books read and both men agreed that that was right and was a fine teacher supposed to be some the best with the best line so I thought well if I don't know I'll just say what they said try to teach it that way they give a very good uh uh exclamation of it what it really meant and they said now here's a white horse and a white horse is a power a charger and said the man that sat on that was the the White Horse was the Holy Spirit that went forth in the early age and conquered that age for the kingdom of God he had a bow in his hand which meant like cupid he shot the arrows of love into the hearts of the people the love of God and he conquered now that sounds very good but it isn't the truth it wasn't white does mean righteous we we realize that the white means righteous the teachers taught it that it was the Holy Spirit conquering in the first age but my Revelation by the holy spirit is not that way my Revelation by the holy spirit is Christ and the Holy Spirit is the self-signed person owning a different form so here stands Christ the lamb we know he was the lamb he standing here at the books in his hand and there goes the white horse rider hey so it wasn't the Holy Spirit uh that's one of the Mysteries of the last days how that Christ can be the three persons in one it's not three different people Father Son and Holy Ghost being three Gods as the trinitarians try to tell us it is it's three it's three manifestations of the same person or you might call it three offices if you're talking to ministers you wouldn't use Office CU I ra happen to think I'm on tape so I'll tell you of course Christ couldn't say I'll pray my office and he'll send you another office we know that but if you want to make it it's three attributes of the same God not three God three attributes of the same God and so how could Christ be out there the White Horse conquering and standing here with a book in his hand it isn't the it isn't Christ notice now the holy spirit in the Revelation and Christ is the holy spirit is Christ and another farm right notice it is the Lamb that opened the books and the lamb is Christ and Christ is not seen anymore from that but he is seen in the Book of Revelations the 19th Chapter coming on a white heart am if you'd like to read it let's turn to Revelations 19 uh 116 let's read it right quick now while we're father we we got enough time I hope s it'll make it just a little better to US 19 1911 begin at the 11th verse and read down including the 16th and I saw heaven open Behold a white heart not on the earth in heaven and he that set on him was called faithful true and righteous does he judge and make war his eyes were flames of fire and on his head was many crowns look at the diadem and he had a name written that no man know but himself I wish I could stop on that just a minute oh my I got a good notion but maybe nobody knows did you ever know that the name of Jehovah is not correct anyone know Dr veale you know that's true the translators could never Translate spelled JV JB hu I mean it isn't Jehovah they couldn't touch it they don't know what it is called it Jehovah but it wasn't his name look every time a victory is won or something goes on a name is changed look at the days of Abraham he was first Abraham and never could have that baby until his name was changed to Abraham and Sarah s a r r a could not have nothing but a dead womb until her name was changed to S Jacob means supplanter deceiver and that's what he did he put sheep skin on himself and deceived his Prophet father to take the birth rights he put popper sticks in the water speckled them Scar the cattle when it was pregnated with the with her young to make speckled cattle and sheep nothing but a deceiver but one night he caught a hold of something real and he know what it was real and he stayed with it and held on until he overcome and his name was changed and called Israel meaning a prince with power before God is that right every Overcomer Simon was a fisherman but when his faith caught in know that with Jesus when he told him he was the Messiah and told him who his name was and what his father's name was he was was overcome and changed from Simon to Peter Saul Good name Saul was a king one time in Israel but he sa didn't fit an apostle might be all right for a king but not an apostle so Jesus changed his name from what from Saul to Paul look at the Suns of thunder and on down and Jesus his name on Earth was Redeemer Jesus when he was on Earth he was a redeemer that's true but when he conquered death and hell and overcome him and ascended on high he received a new name that's the reason you H way they doing they don't get nothing it'll be revealed in the Thunders notice the Mysteries he's coming rioting hallelujah it's got to be something to change this church you know that she's got to be something Hallelujah notice no man know but himself I noticed no man know but himself and he was clothed with a vure dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God the Lord oh notice and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he tread The Wine Press of the fierceness of the wrath of almighty God and he had on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and Lord of lords there comes the Messiah there he is not this fellow on this horse back here watch a different here he stand with the book in his hand here the Redemptive work is just he had took his place yet so it was not the Christ that went forth the Holy Spirit I disagree with that great man no sir I don't do it I wouldn't want to do that but this is what my revelation of it is if you got something different well that's all right but it ain't all right with me I believe it this way and notice Christ is not seen anymore see from the time there but he is on a white horse so if this guy is riding a white horse he's only an impersonator of Christ get that notice the rider on the White Horse don't have any name he might use two or three titles but he hasn't got any name but Christ has a name what is it the word of God that's what in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word made flesh the rider has no name but Christ is called the word of God that's what he is he's called that now he's got a name that no man knows but he's called the word of God this guy is called Nothing see but he's on a white Hearts the writer has no eror as far he's bold did you notice yeah had a b but said about having any arrows so he must be a [Applause] bluffer right maybe he's got a lot of Thunder no lightning but you find out Christ had both lightning and thunder where out of his mouth goes a sharp two- AED sword and he smites the nations with this guy can't Smite nothing Hallelujah but he's playing a part of a hypocrite he's going forth riding on a white horse going out to conquer Christ has a sharp sword and watch it comes from his mouth The Living Word that's word of God revealed to his servants like he said to Moses go stand there and hold that stick out call for flies and there was flies sure whatever he said he done it and it come to pass his Living Word God and His word is a selfs person God is a word who is this mysterious riter of the first church age Dan who is he let's think of it who is this mysterious riter that starts forth in the first church age and rides clont out into eternity goes to the end the second seal comes forth and goes right on out into the end the third seal comes forth and goes right on out into the end fourth fifth sixth seventh every one of them winds right up out here in the end now at the end time these books has been rolled up all this time with these mysteries in them it's broken amen then out comes the mystery to see what it is but actually they started forth at the first church age because the CH First Church age received the message like this a white horse rider went out they really he's Mighty and he's conquering power he's a great fellow in his conquering power you want me to tell you who he is he's the Antichrist exactly what he is now because you see if an antichrist Jesus said that the two would be so close together until it would deceive the very elected the bride if it was possible Antichrist it's the Antichrist Spirit remember in the church glory to his name [Music] [Music] m [Music] ah [Music] oh [Music] glor in Exel SE day oh Angels We Have Heard On

Doug up here wanted us to mention him for a procedure that he's having this week and we certainly hold up his mom in prayer Jackie's joined us a couple of times and we want to remember her I asked brother Israel if I could say something real quick if you don't mind I don't suppose anybody is going to speak up and say that they do but I just love and appreciate each one of you this morning I wanted to say God bless you our you know Merry Christmas God bless you brother Brown say God bless you best thing that we could say to one another so very thankful for the church and this assembly and the stand for the message and and the hour that we live it's a very late hour brother Ben was reminding us us that after our 500 a.m. prayer meeting yesterday and just kind of struck me and and he said how we were built for today and this is a golden age and I had remembered brother brandom he talks about the golden age to the Jews and how Solomon and when they took that message and just applied it to their heart and lived it it was a golden age to them and and I didn't remember how brother brandham talked about this being a golden age because of course not everybody has accepted it but we have and we're very thankful and so I just like to read this quote from the invisible Union before we pray if I could brother Brown says I'm thankful to God to be living in this time of the closing scenes of this world's history if I don't know if I would have had a say so before the foundation of the world and God would have laid out the whole program to me said to me I want you to preach and now what age do you desire to go to the Earth to preach I would have chose this age for I think this is the Golden Age and so we're just so privileged to be here and to live in this golden age and of course brother Israel's been encouraging us not to get distracted but strive for that stature of a perfect man and the Born Again experience we had a birth a natural birth a couple of them this you know last month or so and and we're talking about the spiritual application we had two bir births uh you know in process somewh longer some are shorter um we had a long one on Friday I I guess and uh with with baby olant William James is that right so some of them come quick some of them come slow but you know two were were birthed and and baptized and so thankful for that so I just want to encourage everybody let's not get distracted press onward press upward and and strive for the that press for the mark of the high calling in Christ and I was just real thrilled last week if you weren't here you missed there some excitement I guess I'll call it and our precious brother Ezekiel he got in the spirit and came up here and gave gave brother Israel five and that was awesome and I I kind of wanted to do that and I didn't and so then I wanted to run up there and give him a hug for doing it and I didn't and I just cried kind of like I'm doing now my my nephew calls it the uh the Weeping Spirit or something but just so thankful and thrilled to be with you this morning just want to encourage each one so so God bless you this morning let's hold up one another and we all have little differences maybe Joe does things a little differently than you would like him too or we should but let's give one another the benefit of the doubt and the encouragement we all need and let's get get behind the word today and just love our Lord and worship him today so God bless you dear Lord we're so thankful will be in church today lots of places things Lord we've been busy we've been worried about Christmas time off traveling Lord presence the children and all these things Lord and sometimes it gets in the way of the the true worship and so we're thankful that we can set that aside this morning Lord many visitors many uh just Gathering to draw closer to you to have your spirit amongst us Lord and we appreciate brother Israel and his St for the gospel his children as family Lord to support the work and we're behind that 100% And and sometimes we falter we fail Lord every day I know I do and our families recognize that more than anybody they see us up they see us down and so just put ourselves our families our friends Lord we want to apply that token once again for our lives that you would look past Lord our mistakes our failures and help us to do that for one another another to encourage one another in the the work Lord and the the message of the hour we're thankful that we can bring our needs before you Lord not to direct you of course to to do something in our lives that we want but may we come in alignment with your perfect word your perfect will for our lives Lord we know that your desires are for us to be in health sometimes we have to go through things to be an overcomer but if we'll put our trust in you Lord in the word of God the message of the hour that will see us through so help us Lord these needs for the traveling for brother Doug Wilson his mom Jackie Lord their procedure he's got and uh mom Lord and her health condition and those things we just commit everything to you that you'd be there the other request Lord I I don't remember them but you do and so we bring them all to you Lord and pray that each one would put their faith in you Lord and trust in you for the answers that you would we know you'll give us an answer to our prayers

it's always good to be gathered here here in his name amen and it uh just a nice atmosphere here we thank the Lord for the songs that have gone forth and um as brother Scott mentioned there's no service tonight we just trust that the Lord will bless bless you you take that time with your families it's always um just a special time of the year it seems particularly for kides little kids they love Christmas time um for parents for me anyway it's very stressful time and uh I would just maybe make a truce don't give me nothing I won't give you nothing how about that and we just be friends all right so but praise the lord we love to give show our affection and love to each other by sharing little gifts and things and so we certainly appreciate that um but I'd like to go right to the word um this morning greet the brothers in Phoenix we ask you to stand and we'll turn our Bibles into Deuteronomy chapter 29 and then Matthew Chapter 2 little message that we had on Sunday night we'll maybe continue in that just a little bit and and bring it uh for the season today Matthew or Deuteronomy 29 always good to see brother Kurt and sister yeah good friends and all of our friends amen God bless you Matthew or Deuteronomy 29 and 29 this secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law isn't that powerful one more time the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law that's good amen we'll take one more scripture in Matthew chapter 2 verse number seven then Herod when he had privately called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when we have when ye have found him bring word again that I may come and worship him also when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was and when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy amen and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worship him and when they had opened their Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrr and let us pray Lord Jesus Jesus we ask your blessing on your word we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated last Sunday night I it's kind of a an unusual kind of a a different topic or subject I call it um laying in the presence of the son of man and that would be my subject and then maybe for a title this morning unwrap the deity unwrap the deity this God's great gift that has to be unwrapped and like any gift Christmas time you can move too quickly or you can unwrap it too slowly but there's a timing and there's a delicacy as you unwrap the gift depending on what kind of gift there is inside and as we uh move forward in the word we thank the Lord for the great Revelation that has come to us in this our day and um we've shared with you where the Apostle Paul had warned about the maturity of the word and how that you should be teachers and yet you're still behaving as children and if we look across and I gave this example to the church last Sunday that if brother random was to look into our assembly or let's say he sat in the back of one of our assemblies and were to examine me preach are you song Lead are you Worship the Lord or doing whatever we're doing in the name of this great message would he be pleased would there be a uh thumbs up would there be a uh hey you need to work on that would there be that critical or would we be right on target and I'm just talking about a man William brandham how much more our lord Jesus and so just putting those things in line and perspective here this morning this great deity that has come I'll read for you a quote here where brother vam he talks about this um God's Gift always find their places in 1963 paragraph number 52 he says this here God's gifts always find their places now gold in the Bible how fitting it fits to Christ because gold speaks of deity gold is deity we'll get to it in just a moment frankincense speaks of service and myrr is death God deity in service to die and that's what he was the very thing that they brought identified what they thought he was and I say that to us today the things that we bring to him identifies what our thoughts is about him I want you to think about that the way you worship the way you prepare the way you come the way you throw it on the altar or set it on the altar or uh respectfully lay it on the altar that's how you think that's a that's a enter enter view of how you think about what we're doing here today and I say that to us today the things that we bring to him identifies our thoughts what our thoughts is about him you understand what I mean see if you're if you believe it with all your heart every word of that you'll identify it by giving all that you have to it see but if you believe it's a good place to associate with better people around church and things like that that's just about what you give just a few social hours with some congregation or something but if you if you really believe it with all your heart then you give everything that's in you to it see and it identifies you amen that you truly believe the message Hallelujah that you believe it to be the truth so what you give identifies you yeah amen it shows you where you stand and where whether you really believe the message and you give your whole heart to it we don't have to convince you that this is right we don't have to pump you into praise we don't have to keep it interesting for you it's already interesting that's why I came cuz something caught my interest that's why I'm praising the Lord I'm not praising the Lord looking over here looking over here I'm I'm looking up praising the Lord this has this has nothing to do this has nothing to do with what other church members are doing this has nothing to do with what everybody else is doing this is about My Worship to [Applause] him amen Lord open my eyes to who I'm praising and worshiping open my eyes why I even came here this morning open up my eyes Lord of the value of coming in your presence amen amen amen amen praise the Lord Brother brandom I'll read this again this morning he talks about the different attitudes that people have depending on where where where the way they are taught he says that in the how the angel came to me 1953 paragraph number three it's been one of the most amazing things that I've noticed along the lines of my Ministry for our lord Jesus is the peculiarity of the people and the study of human life is one of the greatest things that a person can study to watch the N watch nature of people and the different parts of the Nations and the worlds to where you go you'll notice that there are different there's a different attitude that people take towards Christ towards his service towards his um servants towards worship and one of the things has been that one type of meeting will just be wonderful in one part of the country okay where it won't work in other part of the country now I believe mostly to blame for that or not to blame but mostly is the way the people are taught and the church will never live higher than its Pastor teaching it's not just live higher than his Pastor live higher than his Pastor teaches amen so what teaching are you listening to you seldom find that if you got a good sound saying gospel teacher you usually find that type of a church it's where you're Pastor leads you the pastor that you feed on so um brother Brandon makes that clear that these the different attitudes that people take it's because of the way uh the way that they are taught the way that they learn and let's say we've all been under the tape teaching we claim that don't we and the tape teaching is mature teaching it's solid teaching it's not babies it's not skin milk it's not patting people on the shoulder it's not cutting corners for people God is not going to grade on the curve he's got a standard and everybody has to come through to be a son or daughter of God and that's this message that we have received amen and so if we're really listening to that teaching our life should bear witness of that true amen the way we give should bear witness to that the way we worship God the way we give the way we even think about other people the way we approach this Bible that's correct it should be reflected upon the way the prophet approached his Bible amen I believe that with all my heart and I believe that these great truths and Mysteries they're surrounded with types they are and shadows and their symbolism that's correct it's like well Lord why don't you just tell us what you're saying I was reading in Zechariah Chapter 1 and two where it talks about a red horse rider just in my daily time reading this week and the prophet Z said what what meanthis red horse rider and then the angel brings him the interpretation of what the red horse rider was glory and I thought well if you're going to give me the interpretation why we even talking about a horse anyways why is all this mystery surrounding you see and I believe that you know with symbolism and mystery and things that are hidden and things that have to be uncovered and revealed it takes energy for that and it takes people who really are interested and so you can't just walk by and catch a glancing conversation that the Lord is having and say okay I got the cliff notes I'm out of here no no you've got to what what did you say Lord what was that what does that mean how does that impact my life I mean you have to develop a prayer life for God to speak to you and for you to understand what he's saying one thing he'll speak to you it's another thing for him to unpack what he is actually telling you he gives a vision with symbols and then the symbols have to be broke down that's correct but we're so impatient we don't even wait for that to happen that's correct and it really reveals who we are and what we are it brings the interest up and those that are interested will stay and those that don't don't understand they'll still stay they'll wait they'll wait eat my flesh drink my blood what are we talking about here Lord these are Mind Games you're playing tricks why don't you just tell us and they come to Jesus says why do you speak to us in Parables he says so that in seeing they won't see and hearing they won't hear but to you yes sir I have given you a patience a a shut up and sit down be quiet until I get done talking you got to wait on me you ain't going to you're not going to run this Revelation at your pace I need to know right now Lord no you're going to sit down and you're going to wait on the Lord and you're going to wrestle it out with the angel and when God gets through with you it will be a perfect work it won't be an overnight thing you'll be a a a building that was made with real material am solid stuff good stuff stuff that can take a punch stuff that can get a hit and keep coming that's what the whole Bible is made up of Believers yes sir who have been punched hit and they struggled and they've gone through what they've gone through and they kept coming hit that little woman that San woman called her daughter and her people her race he called her race dogs race race is it a Hot Topic oh you don't woke up now you asleep race let's talk about the best race there is oh that'll wake up any crowd and Jesus hits her on her race this wasn't given to your race they're dogs and right there a half of Christianity runs off he called me a dog I'm out of her he call me but she stayed right with it didn't she what she had the Believers have and that's a tenacity and that's the ear to hear oh my this ear to hear is how God speaks to his children and he unveils himself little by little Page by Page like this here quote by quote you like read like you like move on I can't move on I'm wrestling with this right here move on I can't move on God is dealing with me right here and that's the way Revelations work you don't have to say Amen if you don't see it but when you do see it you will say amen hallelujah sometimes you got to wait and let the Lord reveal it to you then it becomes real to you then you can bring that to your prayer life and that is called Faith that's right and that's how you please the lord it's with your faith for it's impossible to please him without it and so this this uh great revelation of what came down in our day this great uh light amen you know it's interesting how Herod he didn't know nothing about what the star was and what the King was or anything but he maned to some people who did and so instead of him developing a prayer life studying the scriptures for himself he try to hire somebody to get him a revelation okay y'all go find him for me and when you find them come get like you go to Sunday school I can't make it I'm tired but you go to Sunday school and tell me what they said give me all the highlights from the sermon and when you get it all together then come bring it over to me while I'm in my pajamas and my Christmas sweaters and no no no this is what har is is you you go find them you go find him he didn't develop a prayer life he didn't ask God to show him nothing he he tells these guys go get him go get him and then come back and tell me where this Christ is so I can worship him too to a believer that don't even sound right that's right amen that's right amen I mean it's like I'm going to get this Revelation and come back and tell you for what you wouldn't value it if I gave it to you you would you you would treat it as something cheap because you didn't pray for it yourself you never studied it yourself and it's sad that many Believers are sitting in our churches and they've developed an attitude towards a revelation because of something they heard that somebody else said but they've never studied it for themselves Jesus said in St John chapter 5 verse 39 search the scriptures for in them you have eternal life search them correct you take the scriptures you search it for yourself and then when I ask you who I am you'll have an answer from your heart it will be sincere it will be genuine it won't be what somebody else is telling you to say Amen so this great Open Door uh Ministry that brother bradam uh has brought in this last day in questions and answers he says this here Church of the Living God I'm sorry and this is in the message uh uh the world is again falling apart 1963 paragraph 146 the Church of the Living God the bride moves right on just the same she'll go in the Rapture by the word that's right the word and the word will come together if we're a part of Christ part of it we have to be his word CU he is the word right yes sir they have refused the anointed Word of Promise of this age and he's all always the word if God sent us an anointed promised word again for this age in 1946 he would be the same he was when he come in the beginning the anointed word for the age now he saying this is 1963 actually Hebrews 138 throws it right back in your lap and says he is the same yesterday today and forever that's exactly right and he would stay with the father's promised word for this age if Jesus comes he would be just exactly what the word said it would be in this age 148 paragraph 148 says that's what Elijah was in his age that's what Moses was in his age that's what Noah was in his age that's what everywhere every Prophet ever come the word when it come in its fullness the entire word made flesh Among Us it did just exactly what it said it would do in that age if it would come today he would be just exactly Jesus Christ Living out his promise of what he promised to do just as the word amen can I get a witness questions and answers 1964 questions and answers number two 1964 brother bam says this here paragraph 49 so being a well-trained theologian had nothing to do with it being Meek and gentle had nothing to do with it what made him different he was the word made flesh not the word for the day of Moses Moses was that day word not the word for the days of Noah Noah was the word for that day not the word for the Days of Elijah Elijah was the word for that day but he was the present tense word and they were living in the back the same thing repeats that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost when God reveals to you and you see it thus sayeth the Lord and accept it not what you are what you was or nothing about it it's what God has done for you now there's the evidence yes sir amen so brother bam is bringing this word made flesh Moses Elijah Noah all those days going by Jeremiah word made flesh and here it is again today the word made flesh a Vindicated Prophet that God has used in this hour for the office of bringing the entire fullness of the word to his people to God's people amen let's take a little bit further in the message the trial 196 4 and we'll get into why this confuses people sometime and you have a group of people that they'll make um they'll make brother Bram is something in the scriptures that God never made him they'll make him Christ or God and they'll want to baptize in his name or Worship in his name or remove the Lord Jesus um and salvation and they they go over for over overboard on on that side over there because of the word being made flesh in our day and then you have another group of people who will minimize who he was and try to make him just like a regular you know like a Billy Graham or Oral Roberts or a nice fine preacher or Minister that had a gift this is more than just a man who had a gift this was the word for an age this was a turning Corner this was a very PIV pivotal pivotal time in your church uh Bible History and as brother Joe read the quote we're living in that golden age where we're seeing things that other people wanted to see they wanted to see the end time like how we have it here and brother brandom tells us in the trial 1977 he says 1964 paragraph 76 Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom when the son of man is being revealed in the days of the son uh in the days of Sodom when the son that was God revealed in human flesh which was one time called MDC the father MDC at that time had no father no mother no beginning of days no ending ending of life ever who he was he Remains the Same Jesus had father and mother but this man had neither father nor mother mother and he appeared to Abraham in the form of a son of man Elohim Jehovah the church now has served the term through the church age in the baptism of the Holy Ghost but Jesus said here to make Malachi 4 and the rest of the scriptures real to you see that in the last days just before the coming the world is will be setting will be like Sodom and the son of man will reveal himself as the son of man like he did in the days of Sodom blind prosecutor can't you see that his words are true they are not nail scars and prints and Thorns it's the Son of God impersonated in his church as son of man it has to fulfill malach 5 4 and the rest of the scriptures I call to the Court's attention look at that real good son of man like God the Father God the son God the Holy Ghost it's the same God three different attributes of the same God now this is son a man revealed then as a prophet son of David the king now the Son of God to the church ages and God isn't man God God is the spirit and the spirit's son is the Holy Ghost which is revealing the church age but promis here in the last days that the son of man would be revealed amen now this office of the son of man is the office of a prophet it's not the office of a pastor or an evangelist although a son a man a prophet can do those works it's not the office of just a teacher or brother so or Reverend so and so that has a local Ministry for a time period maybe in you know whatever country he's from his little church or whatever he's doing that's a local Ministry local pastors we have many of those thank God for them but the office of the son of man is the office of a Prophet this is a prophetic anointing a major prophet that is sent to reveal and to impersonate the son of God in this office of the son of man now this office of the son of man we see Ezekiel had that office Jeremiah had that office and here we are again this uh office you know the Reverend William brandham was a son of man he was not the son of man Capital the son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ but here is a son of man revealing the son of man in the last days that's amen amen and so when we realize that that's what's taking place that's what's on the tapes that's what the message is then we know this is not a junior word this is not a word underneath the bible or let's try to fight it against the word this is the same thing that wrote your Bible that's what it is your Bible was written by men who were moved of God words of the prophets pinned and then recorded and put together and called The Bible and God's Great message of this day is a continuation of what the Bible said would be here in the last day amen so we don't argue them one against the other on we don't the Bible said this but the prophet said this that's that's a different spirit that does that that's somebody who hasn't got a revelation where they worshiping the Lord at amen you know Jesus said this but Peter said this you know one baptized this I'll take what Jesus said over what Peter said you know you need to go and pray and ask God to reveal to you you don't read your Bible that way that's right this part is Anointed but this part is not that anointed and we'll read this part and it's a little Junior anointing and this has more deity and this has less you don't read your Bible that way way it's all God it's the word of the Lord and God uses men throughout the entire scriptures and when the Revelation comes to you you'll see that this message is all God hallelujah more popular to say that maybe years ago is becoming less popular today but we're going to take a stand on God's word amen praise the Lord so here brother brandom is talking about the blind prosecutor it's not nail scars and prince it's not the Jesus at Calvary that he's speaking of here but we're talking about the Jesus that came back and revealed his word to the people at the closing of the Gentile dispensation he promised he would come back church amen and he did come back and he brought us a beautiful word is it isn't it nice you know I've been in the message for 30 plus years or more 40 years almost something like that and you know the tapes still burn in my heart yes amen they still make me weak yes they still bring tears to my eyes still moves me I thank God there's there's no CNN program there's no news organization there's no movie what there is no book that move moves me like the Bible and the word of God moves us because we we're one with that amen amen God bless you so much amen this is not the nail scars he says blind prosecutor who's he talking to Blind prosecutor can't you see it's his words are true it's not nail scars and prints and Thorns it's the Son of God impersonated in his church that's a strong statement but who said it it that's a strong statement but who's supposed to repeat it who's responsible to unpack that Revelation to realize that's for us and for our children you got to repeat these things to your children God gave them to you and they're very very precious and some people step over it they kick over it they'll throw it to the side in the weed pile we don't need that we don't understand it I you trying to make yourself he's trying to make himself you know they said all of those things but still these are the statements that were made in our day and it separates but there are beautiful Revelations when you can catch it there is a beautiful gift laying inside when God Reveals His word to you can I go a step further spiritual food and due season brother banam says this here but now God has promised us paragraph 160 promised us these things in the last days in Malachi 4 said that Jesus Christ would come down and impersonate himself Amen in human flesh like he did at Sodom amen that's right and that the world would be in the Sodom condition and as it was then the son of man will be revealed that day see this son of man that come down in the form of a man which was Elohim by Abraham before the promise son came look what it was Abraham said it was God and the Bible said there was three men came to him dust on their clothes travel sat down eat like men and Jesus said just at the time the world gets in a Sodom condition then the son of man will reveal himself again not Son of God Son of Man see would reveal himself s now so what's the prophet telling us there says that God he said that in Malachi 4 that Jesus Christ would come down and impersonate himself in human flesh like he did at Sodom that's right and said that the world will be in a Sodom condition so we see that this is not the office of a missionary or a pastor right this is the office of a Vindicated Prophet to come down and impersonate himself in human flesh now we all are Tabernacle tabernacling deity we all have a portion of the Holy Ghost in us as Sons and Daughters of God that brings us into the new birth and if God has a son it will be a Son of God he'll be a daughter of God absolutely we're bone of his bone life of his life Jee and so forth but to in order for the fullness to come down and manifest he chooses a vessel yes that didn't choose himself chooses a vessel that actually tried to drink tried to smoke but the angel said don't drink or smoke there'll be a work for for you to do when you get older gave him that commission as a little boy didn't read the scripture to him too young didn't interpret what his life would mean Too Young just simply told him don't drink don't smoke I got a work for you to do when you get older but he got older didn't he and the pressures of Life hit him just like it hits any teenager or any young man or young woman and he got pressured remember that and his uncle in the family pressured him and called him a and you know he didn't want to take a drink it wasn't his intention to take a drink but the pressures of Life pushed him to try to take a drink and he went to go take a drink and that presence came down and protected that vessel now true he'll he can always be saved if he took a drink just like some of us took drink more than one drink some of us took several drinks amen but God's blood redeemed us and saved us but here is a vessel that he did not allow him to take a tree did not allow him to put the cigarette and smoke it why why was that this is not just a pastor it's not just any ordinary Ministry this is Once in a generation this is once in historical terms of the Gentiles we have never seen a light like this come down never happened before and it won't ever happen again amen am I yelling too loud loud no no no this is uh this is Prime real estate in in history speaking yes amen if you can preach brother Brandon where would you want to preach he had all the ages he could have picked out but he wanted to preach in the same age that I'm living in amen and we can't even shout and praise the Lord you know them old saints that they said you going to dance what age would you want to dance in I want to dance in that age and we're in this age we won't even dance well God's going to give us our dance back ain't he look at your neighbor and says the Lord's going to give me my dance back Are you ashamed to dance I'm talking about dancing for the Lord Lord give me my dance back give me the victory that's all I want is the victory if I get the victory Victory with the victory comes a [Music] dance yes sir dancing started in the church dancing started in heaven the world don't know nothing about they got all these dances they call this move and that the dirty chicken and the Funky whatever they call it they ain't got no kind of dancing like what we got don't nobody know how to dance like a son and daughter of God Can Dance before the Lord because he's been so good to them and he's revealed to them and give them the joy of the Lord amen HJ yes sir amen huah so he kept he protected this vessel didn't he and this is ABCs for many of you but this is new material for some of you but he kept this vessel uh pure and clean for the purpose of manifesting in this great anointing that will be re represented to the Gentiles impersonating the Son of God again now there's a danger line in there we'll get into that just for a moment look what happened at lot this is in the invisible Union of the bride of Christ look what happened to Lot and them down in Sodom look at Billy Graham Oral Roberts them down them down there amongst those denominations look at the elected Abraham Church pulled out look at what kind of sign that Jesus himself the incarnated God standing there in human flesh you say that was an angel the Bible said it was God Lord God Elohim standing there in human flesh showing that he would so anoint his church in the last days it be God working in human flesh again as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man all right can I go a little bit further Saints we got service tonight no service tonight oh I got plenty of time is that what you're saying God bless all right I love preaching God's word to the people who believe it look at this message here I just take a few more moments and then I won't hold you long all right the prophet of God says here in one in a million yeah paragraph number 10 and he is supposed to according to the scriptures Return To Us in this last days and this type of ministry that will be after the baptism of the spirit and speaking in tongues Divine Healing and so forth these things the capping of the Pentecostal message is what we're speaking of today this ministry of Christ himself impersonated among his people with the very same things that he did when he was here on Earth in his body the bride which is part of him doing the same things as husband and wife or King and Queen just before the marriage ceremony amen all right let's take one more on this then I got a couple things I want to say here in the anointed ones at the end times brother brandom says this paragraph 259 put another scripture here Luke 17:30 Malachi 4 as Janice and jambers withstood Moses the anointed word of the hour so will these men not man men anointed ones resist the truth correct in the very day that the son of man is revealed Revelations 10 1-7 read it when you get home the seventh Angel's message opening up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man that's right but the messenger yes is revealing the son of man yes can you get it separated now that's where it seems to be hard for you you see not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it left the Shu he can't organize it it's the grain itself again we had a hard time getting this one last time last Sunday help her out sis brother we'll get it we finally got it but I don't know why we got stuck on this one I think my numbers here are different than their numbers there but the devil don't want me to read it but how many will wait for us to get it right so I can read it and then you can read it then after I read it and you read it who going to say Amen we got time amen who going to say amen amen pardon give it the words all right in the very day the son of man is revealed in the very day the son of man is revealed Revelations 10 1-7 read it when you get home the seventh Angel's message opening up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated now that's where it seems to be so hard for you you see not the son son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it's left to shook he can't organize it it's the grain itself again so who is revealing to the public a son of man is revealing the son of manre the seventh angel Ministry which your pastor your preacher your priest the brothers who started Works missionary efforts this brother who started a church preached for 40 years that brother who established the work who sent the message over here those are great Brothers they're pastors they are not Angel messenger they're not the seventh angel messenger so this separates just an ordinary Pastor or Ministry this is the seventh angel Ministry which happens to be the ministry of a son of man revealing the son of man can I get a witness and it's revealing it to the public now the danger with this is there is there can be a danger line here is that when we run with these quotes like this and many brothers have then they can make it sound like we're making this ministry here this ministry here we'll make the prophet Jesus Christ and we'll replace the prophet we'll replace Jesus Christ with the prophet and we've seen that done it actually happened on the tapes and brother bandam corrected and that's what we want to deal with here just for a moment these are these are True Believers so first of all you have to be in the camp of Believers to even go so far to think that this was this true so people just glancing by and walking by criticizing they'll never get to the stage to think that a Vindicated Prophet was the anointed Christ and so the this um this happening takes place in the message it was going on for a number of years I'm going to finish up my message I have several quotes I'll finish up my message here because I had I've had this and I and I'll say this very carefully because I know some of the brothers are you know that that might hear or whatever they might say or think but I've noticed that with Revelation brothers who get revelation of these deeper things a lot of times there's Pride that goes with it sure and there's arrogancy that comes with it and then they start cutting people off and they start making and I say they we start you know making something a word test to test whether you are bride or not and you got two or three quotes or 10 quotes or seven quotes whatever it is and you'll meet somebody out here in the parking lot in the special meetings the brother up there preaching whoever preach whatever he preached you wasn't listening because he wasn't using your catchphrases anyways but you going to straighten everybody out in the parking lot though ain't you cuz you got these quotes right am I talking by myself they might know what I'm talking about and they they reach you they catch you out there and they take these few little quotes here and they give you the word test and if you don't pass it right now brother Kirk I'm going to tell all my friends that he ain't seeing it she ain't seeing it bunch of dead birds they don't have the Revelation right cuz they didn't pass my word test well well I've seen that and I've had that attitude myself I remember when um when there was a an effort to franchise the message I wasn't supposed to go here but I'm here now and I remember I got so upset at somebody that would not fall in line with what was going on in in um in Jeffersonville I'll just say it like that and I was upset with that someone would try to come against and so forth so I develop a a very bad attitude for a group of people brother George that I never even met exactly what the news will do to you the news will have you mad at people that you've never met and probably never will meet and you over here on the Southside stressing out over something you heard about in the news with people you'll probably never even meet in your life that's true and so I know it's going to get quiet here so let's get quiet so I develop this attitude the hypocrisy the Hypocrites the Believers these people that can't get this Revelation all a while I should be praying and reading my Bible and feeding on the message the message didn't come for me to become some kind of uh word test Giver or some kind of like teacher over to go around seeing who got it and who don't got it I don't have time for it you don't have time for it the coming of the Lord is at at hand pick up your Bible pick up the message and bring it to the Altar and stay there until you're changed and ready for the Rapture that's what this message is for so but but I've seen this accompany some pride I've seen this accompany some arrog can see and even you'll see it in the scriptures where Paul was sick he was buffeted with this sickness and he sought the Lord three times he says Lord take this away of he says because of the abundance of what You' seen too much you know too much I've sent a messenger to keep you on your knees God help us God help us what have we seen today help us Lord I sent the message Meer of Satan to Buffet you because of the abundance of Revelations all right so brother bam here is dealing in this this is 196 um 1 Revelations chapter 5 and I'll have to close here God bless you Brothers you Saints he says and that brings me to leads me to say something that I would rather run than say it leads me to say something that it grinds my heart to the bot to say it but what I say I am forced to say realizing that this is being taped and the world will hear it but I have I have left the ministry for a cause that I'm sorry that I have to leave it for and perhaps many of you have heard it I I closing my office and so forth and leaving the field I don't know where our Lord will lead me to and that I have no control of of whatever he will have for me to do but I'm thinking at the end of the road where I must come down a long life's journey I have made so many mistakes that I'm very sorry from my heart of because of I guess being human and weakness and so forth causes a person to do things or say things and even act that they would not want to act otherwise but being the weakness of human being we have those times yes if there's anything that has been in my heart to do was to hear those words of our Lord Jesus at the end of the journey to say it was well done my good and faithful servant and many times I've said it I I like to have been standing there when he said come up unto me but I did desire to hear it say Well done that I did not hear the voice in the original say come unto me back in the times of the writing of the Bible but I do desire to hear it say well done ver paragraph 25 drop down a little bit he says because of that it forces me to say I'm leaving the ministry because that there is something arose up among the people that caus me to do it that is they have been taken they that I have been taken from the bracket of a minister or a brother and being called Jesus Christ and So-Cal and that would brand me an antichrist and I'll meet God as a quitter before I would meet him as an antichrist to take away from him yes I heard of it a few years ago and I thought it was a joke I met a couple breth which I don't see neither one of them in the meeting this morning two or three of them one time in a fishing trip and they approached me by the subject of saying brother brandom aren't you the anointed Messi Messiah the Christ and I put my arms around the neck of both Brethren or all of them and I said Brethren as much as I tried to be a true servant of Christ I would not have you I would not that you would say such things as that and if it would ever be said of me then I would leave the field with a clear conscience and you who do that will be responsible for every soul that I would have saved during that time see for taking me from the field and I thought that ended it and he says he heard of it a few more times and Skip on to paragraph number 31 and brother bam here gives us the reason why they do this I never really caught this but it's part of the ministry yes it is in paragraph 31 he says I went to the Lord here not long ago when I heard it about a year ago and then I went went to the Lord and He referred me to the scripture that when John came forth preaching that they hadn't had a prophet on Earth for so many years until it would they was All Amazed in their hearts thinking maybe John was the Messiah so then I John they went and asked him and he said that he was not you read that in Luke the 3r chapter the 15th verse so but that kind of quiet it down so I let it go like that but then when it come to this then I know that something must be done I say this that the visions and the angel of the Lord that appeared at the river if this is to be my last message or the last thing to the church to the world those things are truth as far as the angel of the Lord so here brother brandham is bringing a correction to the some brethren who are made him from a minister to be in the Lord Jesus Christ and so he goes to the Lord and the Lord refers him to the scripture and shows him that in the scripture because it had been so long like never for us that a prophet had come to the Gentiles on such a magnitude you talk about a Vindication brother George it's like overly Vindicated it's like so Vindicated you can't you don't know where to start and to stop on the Vindication of what happened in this day and it been so long we hadn't seen one so this is where this comes fromen the people are so excited they're good people they are actually believers they just need to be adjusted they need to be corrected they need to be put back into their right place but these were followers of John's Ministry followers of brother bram's Ministry but it went so far that he had to do something about it and I think a pastor would have to do the same thing I think of a pastor is preaching something and the people start to put him in the place that he is not that Pastor should have the character and the wherewithal to tell the people people to stop that is not how this is going I am not what you say even though it seems like a com it seems like a you know a compliment it seems like but we've seen it over the years have you has been around the message you seen these camps group and they got their main speaker their main man and they got him up there I wonder if he tried to stop them amen well brother Bron put him to the stop Glory I'm leaving the filled because this isn't right let's go a little bit further a few more moments all right it let's drop down to paragraph number 36 I thought I'd rather die here in the woods like I fell on my gun or something I seen then I thought about my little Joseph and so forth that he'd be raised and I was in no condition to hunt so I just left the woods and come home I've been tore up about 8 or 10 days and such a fix I thought I was losing my mind I just ask everybody to stay away from me and I and let me alone cuz I'm in such a fix and nervous and upset and all tore to pieces and I wondered if it would have been some enemy of mine it would have been all right right but I would have just laughed it laughed at it and went on but when it come to be precious Brothers precious sisters then that's what hurt me and and I said Lord the I said Lord the great things too great for me I'll just have to walk out and leave it in your hands I don't know nothing else to do and a few nights ago to make it sure I had a visitation from the Lord and I seen a precious one a babying a serpent which was a yellow and black telling me right along and the thing struck me on the leg but the blood was so rich it didn't take effect on me I looked down there and there's where it had bit before and I turned quickly with the gun and shot the thing and it hit it right in the middle of the thing and the brother said I turn with my gun to shoot his head off and he says don't do that just picked up the stick laying there by you when I turned my back to pick up the stick it wiggled in some some water just a small puddle of water I said Well it can't hurt very much longer now because I believe that the brother realizes the bre that that would that would happen I said it's mortally wounded so it'll die and I ask many of you members of my church here in this Tabernacle with brother Neville uh that's come approaching me with the same question brothers and sisters haven't I tried to be a true servant of Christ before you haven't I tried to be your brother now wherever it is it's a spirit on precious people many people has asked me that but it's a spirit but I hope that today that it receives a deadly wound and will die out quickly so I can return back to the ministry and remember if you ever believe me if you ever believe me to be a servant of Christ remember that is an error that is a error it's falsely thus sayeth the Lord It's Wrong have nothing to do with it I am your brother can I get a witness he said it's an error have nothing to do with it it is wrong so that was in June the 11th 1961 and so a few days later uh June the 18th seven days later a week later he's preaching Revelations chapter 5 number two and he's dealing with this um you know it's interesting how he brings this out I want you to Terry with me just for a moment he brings out Matthew chapter 18 when a a brother is taken in a fault or when there's two people that disagree how you bring a witness and then you tell it to that witness if they won't hear you bring it to the church so he's actually dealing with that and he actually uh says that's what he did in that service that we just read for you and so he's you know it's a beautiful understanding or teaching or how you know the Matthew 18 and some people will you'll take it many different ways when the brothers you know have ought with one another you bring them together they won't listen bring a witness he won't listen then tell it to the church if he won't listen then he's a heathen and a Publican that's Matthew chapter 18:1 17 but here brother Bram is referring to what he said on the tape that he did what that scripture said to do and referring to those Brothers this take it's a little bit of a quote but I'll read it for you and I trust it'll be blessing to you all right everybody okay praise the Lord this is the prophet now he's dealing with this spirit that is a spirit it got upon Believers not unbelievers not halfway these are True Believers the closest of the closest the ones who really saw who he was and brother bam is dealing with it a week later he says now Pastor I'm I'm going away this paragraph 32 being your assistant with you here in the work of the Lord as Paul would say I charge you before God and the elect Angels into this church here there's a perfect example on what to do if somebody gets out of order in the church see now if there comes something up in the church that's not right then let the individual who knows that that's not right go to the person and if the person will not be Recon then the next thing to do is to take a witness and go or maybe one or two witnesses and go to this person to get them reconciled or get the things straightened out now listen close now this is being taped also and then if if that don't work don't never let a little ISM a little something another a little bad feeling ever rise up among you give get it out of the way right now so that's it's time it's the little fox that spoils The Grapes you know so keep it out of the way any little funny um feeling go and tell the person to it's say I'm wrong I don't feel right toward you or something help me to pray over it that I'll get better because we don't want nothing but just purely the unadulterated holy spirit of God Among Us that's all we want then will the giftss and things will work right and everything will be coming right why have half a church when you can have a whole one why accept a substitute when the whole skies are full of the genuine see we don't want that so if a little funny feeling ever comes up among with you members one to another you go to that person now do does that happen to church people little funny feelings sure but not in here right not in this church we don't have funny feelings in this church do we yes we do that's why it's written in the Bible like before you got here before you had the funny feeling it already was dealing with your funny feeling so when you got your funny feeling you know to go to the word you're not supposed to build up a team of people Amen to talk about how offended they were how they offended you and build up a group of people to you know to build up a team of how they they did you wrong you're not supposed to do that Jesus said not to do that you go to the person the Bible says alone amen amen amen he said brother Israel we're supposed to be Jingle Bells and Merry Christmas well this is your Jingle Bells this is your gift all right Merry Christmas to you if there's a funny feeling take the word of the Lord forget about the Christmas tree get that funny feeling out of you right and here brother bradam is dealing with it in his own Ministry but this is the real one this is with people that were making him something that wasn't scriptural and so there is a warning in this great revelation of this son of man yes there is am yes there is there is a way we have to walk and carry ourselves because Spirits are not Prejudice they'll get on anybody amen amen is that right we're not beyond that funny feelings a bad Spirit we're not Beyond any of that so brother Adam is dealing with it here and he says now Satan will constantly punch punch at you MH amen paragraph 36 now remember now if you have error or fault against your brother if your brother has has something against you but if a brother has something against you see go to him and be reconciled tell him that you've had a strange feeling about him going to make it friends and pray and go down at the altar and get the thing out of the midst of you now Satan will constantly punch at you until you're finished here on Earth just remember that you'll never have a time but what there's a punching going on all the time cuz you're in a battle did you ask to come to Christ going to a picnic that's right well you're sure going to be surprised because it's a constant battle I've been on the field for 31 years I fought every inch of the way that's right Israel had to fight every inch of the way Palestine was given to them but they had to fight every inch of the way to get it now remember this now then if there's something comes up in the church then let the pastor and if you if you have to come get the pastor to take him to the person then if they won't hear that then come up before the church and tell it before the church give them so much time to be reconciled maybe from one Sunday to the next and if they will not not hear the church then the Bible said let them be as a heathen and a Publican let's see as long as they are protected by the church Satan cannot get to them but when the church looses them from under the protection of the church and the blood of Christ then Satan will go to work on them that'll bring them right into reconciliation again see you understand that don't you Pastor yes sir so that's the thing to always remember to do is to be reconciled come to God and go God's way what does that prove to us two or three of our Brethren that knows that I've labored under this other one for two or three years that's right but when it come to the place I thought as them man I could finally love those men enough they can they can't get away from it and I took Witnesses but that didn't work I had to bring it to the church and then from the pulpit last Sunday I said don't I don't want to hear it one more time I'm free from it I turn it over to God see and commit it back to him and it immediately it shows that those people were called now if they had been when they come to the scripture correction and the man can't stand the scripture correction he gets all angry and blows up it shows he's not right with God right but a genuine saint of God will be reconciled to God by the word that's right and the word is the correcting way those Brethren ought to be very thankful to God that see the Bible said false Christ would rise in the last days and would deceive the very elected if it was possible but it's not possible no sir the elected was for ordained so they will not be deceived you see so soon as them brothers they come up there at the house the next day see even till they got and had begin to give me their scripture and the Holy Spirit by the scripture just condemned everything they were saying you see so there it was they seen the elected group of people walk out in the presence of God it makes me thankful for people like that yes sir that's real men when you can see a man that's wrong and proven wrong then that shows he wants to be a Christian he walks up and says I'm wrong wrong that's a real Christian your brother Adam says they actually came up to his house with the scripture and was trying to show him and he just condemned the whole thing with the scripture they're trying to convince brother brandham and he condemned the whole thing with the scripture he said brother Israel why would you preach on a message like this and Christmas and visitors come because they won't come during the year this is when you can hear it this this is the this is the time to preach on these things when we got you here I was going to close 30 minutes ago but it's too many visitors here I got to keep I got to keep moving you guys want to see the you know the Christmas tree you want to see hear about Jingle Bells or something but we don't have no Jingle Bells we have joy Bells though huah the joy of the Lord is our strength we talk about that and if these things get right then man what a wonderful Christmas what a beautiful Christmas we can have if these things are right but here the prophet is showing us that even true believers had this happened to them and this great gift that God has wrapped and sent to us in this day is not the man is the gift although we see the man is gifted life but what was he magnifying he was magnifying the Lord Jesus Christ he was magnifying it in our lives and bringing it to a full manifestation that we too amen as Believers if we lay in the presence of this son that we too will ripen and we will get all the immature green things out of us and we'll become into His Image we want to give God our best that's correct amen that's correct and I don't know how to worship him until he reveals to me how to worship Him amen like I've said many times if you really want to give me a gift the best gift that I get is when I go by it myself because I know exactly what I want you think you know what he wants you think you know what she wants oh she would just love this she would just love that you know who really knows what she wants she does and she's running up and down those aisles and this one and blue and green and yellow me three minutes that the right size get that one boom gone shopping is over with but that's not how she shop right she goes up and down those AIS up and down don't let her have no Nikes on either she going upstairs downstairs nice comfortable shoes just like a trooper and I can't hang with somebody said amen a brother back there said amen know exactly what I'm talking about you're going to find out brother bonson what we talking about here in a minute yes when it's time to get a gift for me the best person who knows exactly what I want like I love when people fix my plate brother George but you know who really can fix my plate perfectly that would be me that's me I know exactly what I want on my plate you know somebody else is fig oh he needs vegetables you know he must more green things more just wet salad that's you fixing my my plat let me fix my plate where's the gravy at where's the beef at and the and the Lord will reveal to us I believe that's a real prayer is Lord Teach Me How To Worship if you came with the sincerity on Christmas is a worship day if you came to the sincerity to Worship the Lord you know the song leader telling you this brother so and so worships that way this one worship that way it's a simple prayer Lord Teach Me How To Worship you show me how to praise you give me give me a give me a dance that comes from you Lord reveal teach me how to pray that's the disciples ask Jesus teach us to pray amen you know we just take the prayer we want to do this we want to do that but Lord teach us how to pray exactly and we lay in the presence of this word and that's where we ripen and we thank God for these great gifts that he's given us God bless you richly don't you love the Lord oh my let us pray thank you Father for your word today we thank you oh God that you will answer our request even if you teach us how to study teach us how to approach you better teach us how to Be an Effective witness teach us how to reach the the lost the unlovable teach us Lord how to be a true worshipper and Lord I believe you will teach us that I just pray oh God that this service here this morning will find his resting place for the Believers we thank you Lord for revealing to us what has happened in this day that it's a son of man revealing the son of man we thank you for that we thank you Lord that you can correct us if we go overboard on any Revelation and Lord we want to take that correction we thank you for the example of the Prophet that he gives and shows it through his own life is witness here he corrected the people he corrected the situation and he didn't move forward he didn't ignore it he dealt with it Lord if there's funny feelings towards one another Lord help us to deal with it the way the Bible says to do it it's our prayer Lord God as we move forward in service to you help us we pray in Jesus name amen there is none like you oh there is none like you no one else can touch Heart Like You Do I can search for all oh F there is none like nobody like him there is none there is none like you oo no one else Touch My Heart Like You
