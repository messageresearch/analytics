word tonight may you minister to our hearts we pray we love you and we thank you for all these these blessings in Jesus name amen God bless each of you so happy to be in the house of the Lord with you this evening to be back from uh we had a wonderful trip in Florida and the night of worship was very nice they had maybe 500 or more um Believers that gathered at the school there's a banquet on the night Friday night Saturday night they had the night of worship choir sing singing and other songs and just had a wonderful time kind of apologized to the samanos I didn't really greet them from the pull pit Sunday morning but we were so happy to have them along with us in the in that trip and it was just very very nice and I spoke on the Sunday morning there and just had a wonderful time my wife is at home not feeling well as many others are but um we're glad to be here with you tonight appreciate the brothers that took over the service while we were gone brother George he always does a very a very fine job and each of you I have a portion in the message I want to read before we go to the tape it's in the message communion and it's paragraph number 64 the last message brother Brandon preached and it's been going right along with these messages that we have been bringing on on love and unity and um some would say well brother Israel is there anything going on no there's nothing going on everybody's doing good far as I know and um and so um these are just the messages that were been on my heart and um I think the Lord has Vindicated it every time of just the the response I'm getting from different ones on you know just the need in the Lord has just backed it up in my own heart on those messages on love and communion and with one another and unity of the spirit and all those things that we that we absolutely need to do amen and so um in this message communion 1965 in paragraph 64 brother mam says this as we will be preparing to go to the Lord's Supper um in the next few days he says this and it's just really really striking he says is this communion just something I go up for it in order say well the rest of them take this I will too it's a revelation that I am part of him and I am part of you and I love you and I love him and we're taking this together as a symbol of our love to God and our love and fellowship to one another very simple but very profound how that communion service isn't just an individual service it's a love that we have towards God and towards one another and not only a love towards one another we're actually part of one another the enemy does doesn't want us to grasp that he wants us to stay individual and separate that and push it off yeah we heard that before but let's go deeper than that and I believe that's where the Rapture and all the things that we need in growing closer to the Lord and receiving a double portion of his spirit and having more of the Holy Ghost I think is founded upon this right here the love of God so brother random takes this message 1956 divine love he's preaching it at the brandham Tabernacle on a Sunday morning he's going to be reading from Romans chapter 4 and um so he's at home and this is the main service for the brandham Tabernacle and entitled Divine love so as we prepare to go there let's sing only believe amen [Music] only Bel only Bel all things are possible only believe only be only be all things are possible oh can you lift your hand and say Lord I believe and Lord I believe Lord I believe that all things are possible Lord I [Music] Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe God bless you may be seated we just left the meeting and started over to see a woman friend of our Mrs doble over in in Edmonton Alberta and we're just 20 miles of the Canadian line when we got the news that my brother was dying so we turned right around to a snowstorm and started right back home making us 11 days and traveling we got in late last evening and up late last night and early again this morning so very tired but as soon as I got to my mother actually we got a place where we call in again she said brother Neville has been out there that's a real Pastor that's some we should appreciate that might not maybe your loved ones has never come to that spot maybe but in an hour of crisis when you know that something taking place and know to a friend

and there're free just come get you want extra service over laying down here now we're happy to see uh many of you still holding out to Christ and now just for a few moment of your time I would like to speak just something because of being here with you I'm tired my voice is low and I had some big meetings in Indianapolis was a great heavy meeting and that night we were so happy to see hundreds walk down through that Tabernacle around 10,000 people seated come down to give their hearts to Christ on night Russell Ford man how they was thrilled and the work that P brother T started years ago still going on you know I'd like to have a place like that sometime one of the greatest place i' seen six there just something about I guess I'm temperamental I see a great workers someone it started I had a feeling for that now being horse and we've been up in the mountain trying to get to a sick woman a friend of ours way up in Canada was just ready to cross the border when I heard the news that my brother was dying and turned back and we drove for day in and out and night in and out with been 10 days sitting in that car so you can imagine how feeling this morning and U but I'm thankful to you all again for praying for my brother because he the chist is on his road to recovery again God giving him another chance and so I I thank you and I'm praising God for all things amen many big decisions have to make the worldwide here are coming up Africa shining in the face places everywhere I don't know which way to turn everywhere everywhere and there's about at least 10 or more great outstanding conferences setting right now and each one calling to go to I got to make some kind of decision next 24 hours for the next move so pray for meay and I I need your prayer I hope shutting that F off didn't bother you all here on the front too much for a minute I I've been exposed to so many things in my life life of traveling for the Lord and all kinds of conditions and diseases and and leprosy and I've hugged lepers and shut their hands and and every kind of disease and went into their isolation ws and tamps and everything around the world and I I I'm not a boy anymore I guess you know that and I'm getting up towards and I hear Brother BOS was the other day there almost 90 years old and he when I was in Indianapolis he had a blood plot running into his heart he had death struggles and he s unconscious Miss BOS was called to have prayer for him went over there we announced it and started praying next day he called me I said I'd like being in a meeting with you sometimes I see like here 47 years old I be as shamed of myself just just the human part I guess but oh how valuable it is and how wonderful nothing like being saved amen being saved you don't realize friend I'm sure that the devil keeps that away from you as much as he can he does for me to realize what the value of a soul is did you ever just imagine what it is and what eternity means and how long you're going to be that way amen you realize this is the time when you make your decision for eternity amen last Sunday with you here I believe I preached on the Assurance of how that God had promised and ordained you and call you before the foundation of world and put your name in his book you had nothing to do with it God did it is that wonderful the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and why it never happened till 4,000 years later but God when he spoke it he had to do it because he has to keep his word in the same time that the lamb was wrote down your you were wrote with him amen our names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life not the night we come to Christ but before the foundation of the world so that's the assurance and brother touched on that this morning in this marvelous Sunday school reading now let's just read for a scripture somewhere just for a little uh I wanton thus something is on my heart I just like to speak it for a few moments and then we'll dismiss and expect the services again tonight and now I got a message on my heart coming down the other day and I want if God willing if I'm back here next Sunday morning to bring it to the Tabernacle for the first just something that's on my heart of the time I went into a place to eat and I thought am I going crazy what's the matter me I can't stand these musics and all this your stuff that you had today these silly women singing down out of the ivory Palace or and all this I said it must be something wrong with me and the Holy Spirit said oh no oh no if you love the world are the things of the world the love of God's not even in you so I thought well I don't want to get adjusted then to this world that's and then the Holy Spirit began to reveal this message to me I wouldn't have time this morning at two ties besides maybe the Lord's willing next Sunday morning if we're still around I got some tips to make this week but if I'm still around next Sunday morning God will brother Neville announc on his broadcast on Saturday and we'll be in try to bring this message I want you to try to bring somewhere it's a gospel message of the day hour and season I had predicted 6 months ago that this was the closing year for America and we'll see what it is according to the gospel or not amen this is the time when she's gone amen she either going up or down this year amen right now you young children I want you to bring me a piece of paper and write it in the fly your Bible that when brother Venom's done passed on for him you see whether I was right or wrong know whether the Lord still speak now in Romans the fourth chapter I want to read just for a portion of words to continue on what shall we say then that Abraham Our Father pertaining to the flesh has found for If Abraham were justified by works he has for off the glory but not before God for what sayith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckon of Grace but of death but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justify the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness and may the Lord add his Blessing to the word now the little subject if we should call it so that I wish to speak to you about is divine love and when Divine love has been projected and come to its destination father's Grace takes its place amen H can you think of that I ponder over so we get it real close on see when Divine love is projected am and comes to its Destiny then Sovereign grave takes over amen now it's um it's a strange thing that how that people the type of people and what we do in our associations now we all have to face these facts that there is people that you just love to be around and there's people that find people and you love them but yet there's something about the person that you just you just can't hardly stay around now we want to talk of fact amen now the reason that is is because of the atmosphere that the individual himself or herself creates because you are a minister create us amen because you're Sons and Daughters of God no matter how far you stooped in sin you're still Sons and Daughters of God because you're fallen degenerated in your soul and mind but God is your creator and in your Fallen as state you are lost undone creation of God dominated by the dev that's right but still your sons and daughters of God he's not willing that any of you should perish but all might come to repentance and he's done everything that that La possible for the only God himself to do this to give the the opportunities to the creatures of here to accept and to be what he wants you to be back in your right estate again and no person I hear it is and it's pre shot but no person is in their right mental status until they have accepted the Lord Jesus amen that's a deep word but that's the truth no person is mentally right until they have accepted Christ Jesus as personal savior that's sounds but it's the Bible am certainly that is true he is the one and in your created being now you'll be crazy to the world when you do that because you have to come out of the atmosphere you're in into this other atmosphere when you do that God lifts you right up from the world and you live in a Heavenly atmosphere am see and then to the world you're just contrary to what that is see and this is contrary to the world Amen see now what you want to do is be lifted up by Christ into a an atmosphere so where you are uh Happy peaceful and then in there you create a situation prise God and now many times we in churches this may seem strange but if you just watch it that this is for the church is for the people the people get one another's spirit and instead of getting the Holy Spirit you go into a group of people and you walk the way that uh person acts and and then find people to come into that congregation the first thing you know they act the same way you always you take a good woman and a bad man and he'll she he'll either become a good man or her a bad woman in the atmosphere that you live in you project to your Associates amen what you are then what type of people ought we to be if we're a Christian amen what type of atmosphere should we live in in a consoling soothing healing atmosphere we should live in with our hearts constantly in prayer with a deep love for every person we come and contact with that's if I say this to the little churches prayed for me for the world mission that's my success in praying for the six if I can't get right down into the ceiling of the sickness with the person it usually doesn't do any good you've got to come right down till it's just you feel it yourself here's sometime a go old Mexican man down there on a platform when he run through the platform much safe he fell down grabbed out his Rosary I I told him it's not necessary and to The Interpreter brother penosa so he raised up he put his arms around again going somewhere he was lying I looked at him I looked at him old wrinkled up feet probably never wore shoes in his eyes I looked at my shoes said f him I give him a shoes he was blind now I look he was a wider across his shoulders big man weigh 200 and something I guess he couldn't wear him a coat and as he was standing there in the gray hair I thought him a daddy I thought if Daddy would have lived to be about this age he'd have been about the same age man this around 65 70 years old and I entered into a love of that man to a way that I thought maybe he never had a decent meal in his life maybe he ever sat down at a table in his life and all this and then walking around the darkness then something come into my heart God be merciful he's a man he's a brother then when that's right there's something on amen there's a creation moves around and you it's projected to this person in a few moments I heard him hiring something over my shoulder and he was H I can see I can see what was it Divine love sympathy had been projected by the Holy Spirit into this man and by that at the end of the road where he couldn't nothing to be done and love had taken its place and love had met love then s went to work and God Who s Grace restored the sight to the man see first you have to enter into that St that's what you have to do to a sinner many people pray for Sinners that's all right but that's not the way to win a sinner it's your business to win the center you don't win by playing for him you win win wining by talking to him and introducing to him Christ that's your business that's your duty is to win Sinners by talking to them and projecting to them the love of God through the word of God that wins the cner some say I you go church I sure like that woman I like that color because you're winning that if you stay home and just pray for the sinner never went to contact him there very little can be done but you you got to pray and then go that's go and do it now the projecting of this love here a few days ago I was listening to a testimony of um a great plow manufacturer standing on the platform well there's that businessman from around the world sitting on the platform and this plow man he got up he said well I didn't know why I had to be operated on and I love the man and he's a great follower of brother Robert our friends and so once he said when I found out that I was getting sick and having Stone trouble kidney stone I went to eat dinner with brother or and said brother or got up and said um brother I I see that you're in distress so he said I'm I'm going to pray for you and he said well praise the Lord I just want you to say that brother oral and said oral come over and put his hands on his kidneys and said I reuke this kidney stone and to leave this man immediately and said when he did it said I got released and said just a little while and come back again said I went again to brother or and said he prayed again I got released but the Every Time come back it come wor and he said that the next thing I thought of if I could go down and said to brother BR and could stand before him and the Holy Spirit would come to him he would tell me then why and I didn't get a he one PL on so he made his way out and he come to Louisiana I was in Services there and I stood before him for 20 minutes the holy spiritless youth didn't say a thing I prayed for him and he said he felt better and he come on down then he went getting nervous excited he went from place to place everybody PR for him pray for him and he loved the Lord but finally got to the place he would shipped him off the nail they always looked him over and said you got one chance out of 1,000 of Li inste of an infection your whole body poison and uremic and all forget water said you got one out of one pound so he said I took it he said I pray oh God you know I love you and I went to all your servants and he took the chance and he put him the sleet and said when he woke up in the room he said there's a light shining in the room and the glory of God was all around him and the doctors was astonished amen theyy come in and say what's happened here why said I feel like going home what was it see did build his hopes up on if anything ever happens to me I'll go to brother Robert if that fails I'll go to brother R and yet he loved the Lord Jesus God had to let everything El failed to lay down his said even when the doctor said we can't do nothing and then when Divine love had come to it in all great and tou it Place Hallelujah it'll do it every time if your Moes are right your Alterna is right if you have Divine love and believe walk for God in nothing when it comes to look like the end of the road has com and H great amen how I seen it work how I've noticed it in my own life and not by just a theology or not with some kind of somebody else's experience I'm so glad today that I can talk from a personal exper to know that that is the truth why do we fear that as long as we know the love of Christ is resting divinely in our hearts that we pass from Death on life all demons out of hell out even the if you continue in that love and faith it's just like a little baby you take a little baby I'll show you so the little fellas can get it Hallelujah here's Mrs Kelly s year before one of a drunken soldiers I believe it was run into him out there
