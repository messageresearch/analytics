and just ask you be with us now as we as we hear this word Lord in your name we ask it amen so uh we in the six seal is revelation 612 through 16 let's read that together if you want to turn to that and I beheld when we had opened the Sixth Seal he had opened the Sixth Seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth even as a fig tree casteth through untimely figs when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Man and every Bond Man and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks Fallen us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the Wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand amen let's sing only believe together oh [Music] believe only believe all things are possible only [Music] believe only be only [Music] believe all things are [Music] possible only [Music] you may be seated brother Bron making where you live or die you come forth anyhow he don't dying isn't nothing to a Christian you don't die anyhow now Daniel 12 said that everyone that was found written in the book would be delivered here God is about to deliver his second son Israel after the tribulation see the second time Israel his Israel is his son you know that Israel is God's son so he's going to deliver him here in the tribulation period just exactly the way he did down in Egypt now let's stop here again and and get something else so before we bring it into home now watch here these two prophets look what they're going to do now just like Moses did down there and there was given me a read and um the third verse of the 11th chapter and I will give power unto my two witnesses that they shall prophesy 1,23 score days clothed in sackle these are the two olive trees you remember that zbell and so forth was rebuild the Temple and the two candlesticks to stand before the god of the earth If any man hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth remember out of the mouth of Christ come the sword word devire their enemies and if any man shall hurt them he must in this manner be killed now we know the fire in the 19th Chapter of the coming of Christ proceeded his sword from his mouth which was the word is that right the word oh if you get this material now for that seal tomorrow night see the word is the thing that God slays his Enemy by see now look here when these prophets are prophesying they're they If any man mistreats them harms them fire proceeds from their mouth Holy Ghost Fire the word the word is God word is fire word is the spirit see proceeds from a mouth look at Moses let's see what come from his mouth they Israel got to way they were doing there the I mean Egypt they were mistreating these Jews Moses what they wouldn't let him go Pharaoh God put the words in moses' mouth see it's God's thoughts going into moses' heart he goes over now to express it then it becomes a word stretched his hand forth Let There Be flies here come flies look here and if any man hurts them fire proceeded out of their mouth and devour their enemy there it is they can speak what they want to and there it happens amen and if any man hurt them they must in this manner be killed brother God rides on the scene here they have power to sh uh uh Power to shut the heavens that it rain not in the days of their prophecy Elijah he knows how to do it he's done it before amen Moses knows how to do it he's done it before that's reason it's kept back now amen I can say something awful good right here but night see all right and have power power over the waters to turn them to blood and to Smite the Earth with plagues as off as they will what is it heart can bring these things but the word they can do nature any way they want to here it is there the one who brings on this six seal they uncover and open it up it's a power of [Music] God to interrupt nature Hallelujah see the six seal is completely an interrupt of nature do you get it now there's your seal who does it it's a Prophets The Other Side of the raptured with the power of God the word of God they just condemn nature they can stand earthquakes turn the moon into blood the sun can go down or anything of their command amen there you are there you are see see how the seals open down there in the church age i' showed the martyrs and now here's these two prophets stand here with the word of God to do anything the nature they want to and they shake the Earth it shows exactly who does it it's Moses and Elijah because there's their Ministry re impersonated again both man oh my do you see it now see what the six seal is it's those prophets I notice don't let it choke you but watch what opened that seal [Music] Prophets The Lord there you are hallelujah oh we're living in the eagle day brother head up the the glory god Hallelujah they open that six seal they have power to do it amen hu Hallelujah there's your Sixth Seal coming open see now we Dro right Beaker and Jesus spoke it would take place way back down in the Old Testament back in Ezekiel back in the old prophets they spoke it would take place and here the six seal open and they say well that's a mysterious thing what did it here's the secret of it the prophets cuz the Bible said so here they can open it anytime they they do anything the nature they want to and they do the same thing they did do because they know how it's done amen glory GL to God I seen that I just raised out the church I walked up down the FL I thought Lord how I thank you heavenly father there it is that's it God they open that sick seal amen watch them if any man hurt them fire proceeded out their mouth the word Holy Ghost come up on the apostles you see fire proceed out their mouth now notice over in Revelations 19 we see the same thing and a great sword proceed from his mouth word Christ coming and he slay his enemies with it is that right now he's on his Road watch him now all right these have power to shut the heavens that it reain not in the days of their prophecy boy that's interrupt nature now how long did uh did this man uh Elijah close the heavens for there you are exactly how long's Daniel 70 last part of the 70 weeks and there you are exactly what did Moses do he he he turned the waters into blood he done all these kind of Miracles just exactly what's predicted here under this six seal amen and here they are in Revelations 11 doing the very same thing amen there's three different place in the scripture out there blending the thing right together that's the opening of the six seal right there it is hallelujah hallelujah amen glory now notice these have power to shut the heavens and days of their prophecy about it won't rain and power over the waters to turn them to blood to Smite the Earth with plagues as off as they will oh my there you are I turn it over here to the place see all nature is interrupted in this sixth plague or Sixth Seal open it's exactly what happened now look the here God is about to deliver his son Israel after the same manner uh the tribulation that he did down there he sent Moses down there and delivered Israel is that right and he done these very same thing he sent Elijah to Ahab 7,000 come out is that right sends them right back over here again in time of the tribulation and calls out the 144,000 now see you notice between Revel between the sixth chapter or Sixth plag Seal Pardon Me The Sixth Seal and the seventh seal the seventh chapter of Revelation mathematically set together right just like America is number 13 13 states is started with 13 stars in the Flag 13 colonies 13 Stripes everything's 1313 and appears right here in the 13th chapter of Revelations that's right she's 13 and a woman now when he was about to deliver his only begotten son which was his only begotten Jacob is his son but this is his only begotten son Matthew 27 let's see what he did there Matthew the 27th chapter and I remember remember his son had been beaten and had been troubled and they had made fun of him and he was now hanging on the cross at 3:00 on Good Friday afternoon just about the take place Matthew 27th chapter of Matthew and the the 45th verse I believe it is now from the sixth hour there was Darkness over all the land until the ninth hour now notice just exactly what he did back here now in this sea and I beheld when he had opened the six seal alow there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon and the moon became his blood Blackness Darkness Egypt Blackness Darkness God delivering Jesus At The Cross just before he brought him up to the resurrection first Darkness sun went down in the middle of the day and stars wouldn't shine two days so many is going to raise him up with a mighty Triumph after the sun and moon and stars and everything in Egypt all these taking place he delivered Israel to the promised land here it is in the tribulation period here stands them prophets to who has the control of the word of God gives them they can only speak as God gives them the word amen now they're not Gods they're amateurly they are because Jesus said they were said you call them Gods who the word of God came but look that's the one God brings the word to and when he speaks it it happens that's all and here he is with a commission from God to Smite the Earth whatever he wants to oh my stop the heavens thank and he does what's the matter he's fixing to take the 144,000 out for Redemption out of the book of redemption and that's under the Seal of redemption Hallelujah in The Sixth Seal that's it my dear friend that's that six seal been so mysteriously let's just take we got 10 more minutes let's just take a little I got about two or three pages well I got you can just see here I think it's about on that one I think I got about 15 pages that left I could get to amen oh there's so much on that M you can just keep going from place to place but I'm afraid to confuse you want to scatter too much with and I'm not I can't hold it together like I should and Isaiah let's take this Isaiah the prophet seen this six seal open and spoke of it now that's where it's in partner not see well the whole whole Plan of Redemption Le under these seals a whole book now remember we seen Jesus saw it is that right see Jesus saw it and now we find others that saw it we find a TI out in Jacob we find it typed out in Egypt we see it typed out at the cross now let's go back to Isaiah I got a whole lot more prophets dra down here too let's just I like this this of Isaiah let's go back here to Isaiah the 13th chapter of Isaiah I like Isaiah is a a complete Bible in itself you know do you know that see Isaiah starts out with Creation in the middle of the book he brings John at the end he brings the millennium and the 66 books in the Bible and 66 chapters in Isaiah it's a complete uh encyclopedia itself notice 13th chapter now of of Isaiah let's begin here at the sixth verse how ye for the day of the Lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the all Mighty watch this six seal opening up here now come back here 713 years before Christ come he's been 2,000 years that' be about 7even about 2700 years ago Isaiah seen this seal hanging there all right therefore shall all hands be faint and every man's heart shall melt what did Jesus say and because iniquity of shound the the love of many shall wax and man's heart will be failing for fear SE roaring see man's heart will faint and they shall be afraid Pains of Sorrow shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that tra travaileth they shall be amazed one at another their faces shall be ashamed no of it here oh their faces ashamed we got to get to that just a minute go a whole that behold the day of the Lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fear Fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the Sinners thereof out of of it the lamb that's all of it notice for the stars of Heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light the sun shall be darkened in his going forth and the moon shall not cause her lights to shine and I will punish the world for their evil and the iniquity and the wickedness of their iniquity and I will cause the uh I don't know how to spell it AR I can't say it see of The Proud deceased and will lay low the Hess of of the ter terrible see there just exactly Isaiah saw the same thing that Jesus spoke of that the seven seal reveals when he's cleansing the land with tribulation amen that's the tribulation period this six seal amen yes he was a prophet and the word of God was made known to him that's 2700 years ago truly I just want to say this the whole world is Isaiah here as a woman all creation is travailing [Music] amen what's all it's groaning and travailing about like a a a woman that's to be mother the Earth itself s nature why this city here let's take our own City when beard Johnston prostitution and filth and scum like any other City why I believe God would be better off looking at the way he had it thousand years ago when the Ohio travel down they had no backwaters and floods they had no sin in the valley the Buffalo roome through here and the old Cherokee hunted him and made a decent living there was no trouble at all but man come in that's where sin comes in when man begin to multiply upon the face of the Earth then sin and violence set in yeah that's right always man right well I think it's a disgrace I standing the other day in my home country there now in Arizona now all I read when I was a kid about gonal and and cooches and those old Apaches call I preached to them up there fine people and some of the finest people you want to meet are those Apache Indians and then I went over there to to Tombstone where they have all the old relics and things from the war and I looked at they always you know they always classed jono as as a renegade to me was a red blooded American absolutely he was only fighting for his rights like anyone would do he wanted not that pollution in his land and look what it is nowen turning his children his daughters into prostitutes and everything else and white men coming there a white men's a rascal the Indian was a conservative he was a he was a a conser a he go out and kill a buffalo the whole tribe eat ever thing was left of it they use a hide for clothes and Tents and everything else and a white man comes to shoot it for a Target why it's such a disgrace I read an article in a paper we an Africa that great Place full of wild game they got these guys Arthur Godfrey and I'm going there shooting these elephants things out of helicopters and things like that a picture of an old female elephant trying to die and the tears like pulling down her face and two big males trying to hold her up to keep why it's a sin that's not sport I stand out on the field out and where hunt and things like that and see where them white Hunters come out there and shoot them deer and cut a high Quarters off of it and sometime kill eight or 10 little doors and leave them lay there the fonds running around trying to find their mmy you mean that sportsmanship that's Pro pure murder in my book I hope Canada never gets any road as long as I live to keep them Renegade Americans out of there that's right they're the poorest Sports I ever seen in my life right not out all of them it's some real genuine man but not it's one out of a thousand you find shoot anything they can see any way they want to that's right that's a murder right he heartless you shoot out a season while up there in Alaska there was up there one of them guys and said I picked up I go out there now and find whole herds of them great big elk or not elk but the Moose laying there with 50 cal machine gun bullets to their horns where these American Pilots out there in Alaska machine gun and out of that plane a herd of moose that's pure murder they know that whenever they kill the Buffalo they could get the Indian he starve to death that's the reason Coes had to surrender his all his princes and all the rest of them his children all his people were starving to death they went out there with big great big loads up and buffalo building them planesman they shot off all them Buffalo 40 50 in the afternoon they know when they rid of that they got rid of the Indian oh my stain on the flag way they treat them Indians there you

monitor speaker turned up a little if you can figure that button out there and and uh that'll help me a little bit and so uh let's turn in our Bibles to Ecclesiastes the thir chapter and for our scripture reading today and I was listening in to some of the services from uh from Alaska there and it looked like brother Israel was uh it looked like he was having a good time looked like doing a good job there and so uh seemed like the people was was being blessed and so that's that's good Saints Ecclesiastes the third chapter pretty familiar scripture here Ecclesiastes 3 the first verse to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill a time to heal a time to break down a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away Stones a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get a time to lose a time to keep a time to Cast Away a time to Rend and a time to seow a time to keep silent and a time to speak A Time To Love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of Peace what prophet hath he that worketh in that wherein he labor I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therein let me read that again I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it he hath made everything beautiful in his time also he ha set the world in their hearts so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end I know that there is no good in them but for a man to rejoice and to do good in his life and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor it is the gift of God I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and God requireth that which is passed and moreover I saw Under the Sun the place of judgment that the wickedness was there and the place of righteousness that iniquity was there and I said in my heart God shall judge the righteous and the wicked for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work can you say Amen to the word this morning amen may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated and uh I would title this this morning uh your season is coming and uh brother John of course he didn't know what I was speaking on this morning but I was listening to those songs and and U you know Saints there is a time appointed for you and I for all things can you say all things there's a time appointed to you and I for all things and ever since I gave my heart to the Lord's Saints I have been happy can you say Amen to that this morning but there are times in my life where I've been happier than others now I've always been happy but there's times where I have enjoyed myself more than others there's been good times and there's been bad times there's been easy times and there's been hard times there's been times of Plenty there's been times of famine there's been times where I was uh happy to get out of bed every day and then there's been times brother Miguel where I had to make myself get out of bed there's been times where I've enjoyed going to work and there's been times where I've hated every minute of it there's been times where uh my family's been doing good there's been times where my family has struggled there's been times where I've been doing good at work there's been times where I've struggled at work there's been times when the church is doing good and there's been times when the church has struggled there's been times when everybody's rejoicing and there's been some dry spells is that right Saints there's been times Saints there's been been times where my marriage has been better than others there's been times where my children have done better than other times there's been times where I've had a better relationship with the people around me than than I than I have at other times there's been times Saints where I've been a better Christian than I have at others there's been times where my prayer life has been better there's been times where it's been rough there's been times where I've I've read my Bible a lot more there's been times where I hadn't read it enough there's been times where I've heard the message a lot and there's been times where I haven't listened to it near enough there's been good times and there's been bad times and all of these times are ordered of the Lord can you say amen and so I I there's a time appointed for every season and every purpose under Heaven is that right Saints so if you don't like how things are right now today in your life just wait a minute cuz it's going to change amen if you don't like where you're at today just wait a little while and things are going to change amen or on the other hand of that if things are going great watch out because things is going to change amen things are going to change nothing's going to remain constant here we have no continuing City but we seek one that is to come and many times change you'll find is both good and bad is that right think about when you first got married sisters you might look at your husband today and say well he he's not as romantic as he was when we first got married well that may be true but he's probably not as big an idiot either so you take the good with the bad don't you sometimes things is good sometimes they're bad sometimes they're both is that right amen now brother Bram said in the believer's position in Christ in paragraph number eight he says God's Got A Time for all things he's got a time when he was he says we plant corn we got a time that we plow corn then at the time we harvest corn and the spring Rings crumb and the drought through the summer the fall rains the Snows and you can't just plant my wheat today and tomorrow go out and harvest it that's right you can't just plant today and tomorrow Harvest now there is a law of sewing and reaping but there's a time in in between and that time in between is ordered of the Lord is that right so everything has appointed times and the Lord's timing is perfect Saints there's not one thing out of cater it's all going according to the plan of God now you say well I don't believe so in my life brother George Well you may not understand it now but if you look back across your life you'll find that everything happened for a purpose now when you're going through some times when you're going through some struggles you might not think that everything happens for a purpose but it is for a purpose because the Bible said in Romans 8:28 my favorite scripture that all things work together for the good of those that love the Lord and so as long as you love the Lord you can have confidence that everything is working for your good is that right brother Chuck it might not feel like it's for your good but the Bible said it's for your good I choose to believe what the Bible says over what my feelings say amen and brother Braham said this God has uh believer's position in Christ and I'll tell you I'm going to read a lot from the believer's position in Christ today we heard this tape at a camp uh uh up in up in Canada there and it just blessed me it's only 40-some minutes long but it is a jam-packed 40-some minutes and so he says believer's position to Christ he says God has times for season and he has seasons for his word and he says he has times in the scripture where it said and the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick and that's when Jesus was ministering to at the and at the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick maybe at other times the presence of the Lord wasn't there to heal the sick now we don't like to think about that but I'm just reading what a prophet said he said maybe at other times the presence of the Lord wasn't there to heal he heal the sick and we find out that God works everything seasonally God works everything seasonally you remember how that the pool would be troubled the waters would be troubled and and when the waters were troubled if you was able to get in God would bless you now God was always a Healer but you could only be healed when the waters was troubled is that right so our job today Saints is when the water is troubled jump in amen don't stand back and watch and don't stand back and criticize but when the water is troubled jump on in there today amen so we understand that God's word that he was always a Healer he's always a Healer is that right and he says but there are times when the presence of the Lord was there to heal amen other times he may not be there to heal but remember I was thinking about this brother Brown talked about those two sisters or not two well were Two Sisters in Christ but the two ladies that went through the prayer line and one of them had an ulcerated stomach and the other one had some kind of tumor on her neck y'all remember that Saints and and and brother brandom said that that they were prayed for in the prayer line and they left out of there they were still sick and and one sister he said she just kept on testifying she kept on testifying how God had healed her and she kept on and she kept on and she kept on so much so that her husband who was a Baptist I believe brother brah said he he he got on to her and said you're you're bringing a reproach because you're sitting here sick you can't eat you can't you can't you can't hold nothing down and you're saying you're healed when it's obvious you're not healed and you're bringing a reproach but Saints she wasn't testifying to what she felt she was testifying to what the word said she wasn't bringing a reproach she was testifying to what the word of God said and brother BR said one morning she got up and she'd fix breakfast for the kids and there was some oatmeal left on the table and a piece of toast left on the table and she said oh that looks good but that just burned me up if I tried to eat that but she eat it anyway is that right is that what he say say she eat it anyway two months after she'd been prayed for she'd struggled for two months solid after she'd been prayed for and she got up one morning and that toast looked good amen I'll tell you they a't a morning of my life toast don't look good to me and she said she said I'm going eat it she ate it and she said I'm going to pay for that but I'm going to eat it anyways and he said a few minutes went by and she said she felt hungry again brother Brown say she scooped her out some more oatmeal and eat that oatmeal and a little bit later she was hungry again he said she fried her up some eggs and some bacon got her a cup of coffee come on somebody this morning got her a cup of coffee and she had her a gastronomical jubilee that day and she was so excited she ran down the street to tell her her the sister that was with her that had been prayed for also and she got to the house and she thought somebody died cuz she was heard all the screaming and commotion going on when she walked in that sister was fluffing out the sheets trying to find where that tumor went that was on her neck but it wasn't there she said I went to bed last night looking at that tumor in the mirror and it's not there today he said that healing angel had come through that way times and Seasons but God's always a Healer amen he said the very he said this I love this he said uh uh uh I'm sorry back there y'all on the message why I just want to read a little bit of this quote I'm gonna skip down a little bit he says when I he says now I got their names and addresses for documented statements now see all this stuff coming against the message today they don't ever bring up this we got names and addresses for documented statements where these sisters was sick and then God healed them and he said when that angel of God he said he said any B any now anybody that's a Bible student knows that sometimes God does not come right on the scene when he should come that we think he should you remember Daniel Prayed and it was 21 days before the angel could get to him that's right how many he knows that he says he says what happened the very angel of God that made the promise not me now I had nothing to do with it the very angel of God that spoke to those two sisters through brother Bram and told him that they were healed he said that very angel of God he says I didn't know him but it said thus sayith the Lord it taken him almost two months and he was passing through the neighborhood confirming what the word had been spoke see when the word is spoke it's going to happen amen it might not happen when we want it to happen it might not happen when we think it should happen but it is going to happen Saints but let me tell you this yes he was just as much healer after it was spoke as he was when the healing finally took place amen so the Lord doesn't change his times and seasons change amen you know when he does what you know when he does something when he wants to he does what he wants to do we're not in charge of God God's in charge of everything amen and and when he heals you when he gets ready to when he wants to now I was thinking also about that little brother running down the street holler praise the Lord for healing me when his eyes come open brother Bram gives an example of Moses he said he knew he was to be a deliverer and he said but he was trying and he was trying to do the right thing but he was at the wrong time so Moses was born and he knew he was to be a deliverer and he was trying to do right he was trying to deliver his people but he failed brother Bram said to recognize the time element of God he was trying to do the right thing but it wasn't time yet is that right Saints and he he went out and brother BR said he did it himself and he slew the Egyptian and that's where he failed and brother Brown said in a believer's position in Christ he says now he said in that Moses when he was here knowing that God made a promise and that he was going to deliver the children of Israel while Moses knowing that he was called for that purpose now when you have a call from God that doesn't all together mean you just jump right out let me read that again when you have a call from God it doesn't altogether mean that you just jump right out and he says and you're doing the will of God he says you have to find the will of God and the time of God to do it Moses thought well the children of Israel will understand now that I'm to be their deliverer so he starts out to do so and killed a man and he found out that it the children of Israel did not understand so Moses knew the word of the Lord and he knew that God had promised to deliver the children of Israel and he knew that he was called for that purpose but brother BR said we don't just jump right in there when we feel a calling of God on our life he didn't he didn't use the method that the prophet taught us of remaining neutral and going to the Lord in prayer amen and feeling how we feel led and then waiting and seeing how we feel led and then waiting some more brother Chuck and then brother Brown said then you commit it to the Lord in prayer and you go the way you feel led and you have confidence that if you make the wrong decision you're doing it in prayer and you're doing the best that you can and he said then you have confidence that if you make the wrong decision the Lord will straighten you out he said Paul started this way but he got a Macedonian call right that's right and if you're doing it in prayer you're doing the best that you can amen so many times we find people are paralyzed they don't want to do anything because they don't want to do the wrong thing and that's just what the devil wants you to do but if you follow the steps and you follow the process do something Saints and he made the Assumption Moses did that a lot of us made he assumed that if it was in God's word it was God's will for him but he failed to recognize it must be God's time and season also now brother BR said Believers position in Christ paragraph 11 he said as Full Gospel people I think we've made many mistakes by looking into the word and say God said this and we failed to find the direct revelation of our life to fit this program my that's rich Saints he says when we find that then it's got to happen and I think there's where it has been failed see that's such a striking statement that as Full Gospel people and we are full gospel Saints he said we look into the word and we say God said this so it's his will for me and I'll tell you if we read something in the word it's got to fit the rest of God's pattern see we can't read something in the word and say well that must mean this it's got to flow through God's pattern this Bible amen we we can't just listen listen to the message and take one quote and say this means that because it's got to fit the rest of God's pattern it it's it's not only that when you figure out what it says and you think you understand what it means and you have it saying something contrary to what the Bible said you got that figured out wrong too because the message will not contradict the Bible now people will try to take part of the message and make it contradict this Bible but it cannot contradict what's already been spoken amen that's where the message gets blamed for a lot of falsehood that the message didn't do if somebody took something the message said and try to make it say something it didn't say see you can take a quote over here and a quote over there and piece them together and say well brother BR said these two things so that means this but if it don't run in continuity with the rest of the message it's not right see Saints you you you got to look at what he said before what he said after what kind of context was he saying it in what did he say the paragraph before the paragraph after what do he say the message before and the message after see if you listen to stature of a perfect man you'll get one understanding but if you don't listen to Blasphemous names at the same time you'll never truly understand the virtues of to God because he he he he he sheds more light on it now if you listen to recognizing your day and this message you'll find what brother Bram said about cutting and splicing these tapes it's pretty severe and we don't have to worry about cutting and splicing today so much what we got to worry about is copying and pasting but it's the same thing taking part of what he said taking this over here and try to add it to that over there amen we try to place things out of context I can't remember if I talked about this the last time I was here or not but I had a brother that used to minister for me and I asked him to minister and he said brother George I'm not ministering anymore he said I forfeit my right to minister to play the tapes now we all love playing tapes and we love hearing the word of God but I said said brother you're taking that type out of place because brother brandom when he said he forfeit your rights he said you got a right to smoke you got a right to drink you got a right to these things by the law you got a right to do it you get 21 years old or whatever the age is now you can you go buy legally you got a right to go buy alcohol or you got a right to go buy cigarettes you got a right to do those things you got a right to do it but to a Christian you forfeit your rights to serve God we forfeit our right to sin we forfeit our right to drink and smoke and we forfeit our our right I guess it's our legal right to say whatever we want to say whenever we want we forfeit those things we forfeit our right to those things because we're Servants of God but we do not forfeit our god-given rights I'm not going to Forfeit my right to preach the gospel I'm not going to Forfeit my right to be healed come on Saints today I don't forfeit my right to be saved today I don't forfeit my right to apply the token to my family I don't forfeit my right to God's word I don't forfeit the rights that Jesus Christ paid for that I might be blessed I'm not going to spit in his face and tell him I don't want the rights that he paid for yes sir it's all right Saints you got a right today to claim your healing you got a right today to claim your family you got a right today for the Holy Ghost you got a right to peace and love and joy it's your rights today we don't forfeit those rights we got a right to these things it's when you take something to Prophet said and you it might sound good but it's got to fit the pattern I've also seen Saints where many times when brother brandom says things and he's talking and he's trying I've always said brother Brown spins the first half of the message trying to explain to you what to look for trying to explain who he is and then he spends a laugh half demonstrating why he is what we should be looking for is that right he tells the people we're looking for this to come we're looking for this to come we're looking at these scriptures and we're seeing this to come and then that discernment line starts and he demonstrates why he is what he told us to look for and when he's trying to explain things many times he says things like we or us amen but he's talking about himself he's trying to get us to see who he is he's trying to get us to recognize he he can't just come right out out and say I am the Messenger of Malachi 4 I am the Messenger of Revelations 10:7 but he tells you what they are and he tells you what they'll do and then he demonstrates why he's that amen but sometimes he says it in a way where we think oh that's us too amen that man was special and I want to do my part but nobody can take his place trying to do God a service without being his will I love this he said there's five musts he said I want you to remember these I'm gonna skip down just a little bit to save time he said let me go down to paragraph 118 paragraph 119 he said ' there is your five musts he said' it's got to be that way it's got to be his time his season when he said it would be and he says and the man he chose must be a prophet and he said and that Prophet must be Vindicated and if you don't have those five elements in place then you're placing it incorrectly amen now many times we find that we must wait on the Lord there's a law of sewing and a law of reaping and that law still stands today and but we don't know Saints when you make the deposit you don't know how long it's going to be before you get the interest on it we just don't know that's all in God's place and the reason for that is that we must learn as Believers today that we are helplessly dependent on the grace of almighty God there there there's not one thing that I have the ability to do in myself to deserve God's blessings I I can't work enough work for the Lord to be blessed of the Lord I I I can't I can't I wasn't good enough when I was born to be blessed to the Lord you wasn't good enough none of us was good enough we're all completely dependent on the grace of God today can you say Amen there there's there's none of us we we might feel like Oh I'm a good Christian and I'm a good well if you are a good Christian it's because of the grace of God we never earned that we didn't go looking for it God came found us so if there's anything good about us and I know we got a lot of good attributes and a lot of good qualities trust me it didn't come from me it only came from him I know because I know what I was without him I know the man that I was without him and I know there's anything good it only came after him we're dependent on the grace of God no matter how long we've been in the message you've been in the message 50 years you're still dependent on his grace amen we're so tied up on works and I I believe in works we're so tied up on those things though people say well that brother told Brother Bram said I ain't preaching no clothline religion well we got to preach a clothline religion brother Bram said if you're not preaching a closed line religion then you're not preaching the gospel so we need some more of that but we still are dependent on the grace of God you can get the dress right you can get the hair right you can get all the the the verbalization right you can say the right things you can know the right quotes but you still got to have the grace of God now one of my favorite stories I shared it Thursday night in Mesa so if mesa's streaming in today listen to it again it won't hurt it ain't going to hurt nobody he says in key to the door he's talking about Papa Cox y'all know the story about Papa Cox he said this old man was a nice old man and he says I liked him well what would you give to hear Brother Brown say that about you amen he said I went to see him and I said Papa why don't you become a Christian and he said he loves me and he said brother brandom I would become a Christian when I can get good enough and he says I tell you what do Papa you look around till you find where you can get good enough then tell me where that place is and I want to go too is that right s now you can't work your way in there and he says he says I said Christ never come to save good man he come to save bad man well thank the Lord for that Saints Christ come for me and he says when you think that you're good he didn't come to save you he come to save them that he knows are bad right Christ died to save Sinners see and I said papa there's a line right here and he says well I I smoke these cigarettes I said I ain't going to even talk about them he said I've tried to give them up brother brandom I said all right we we ain't going to talk about cigarettes he says well when I can I said don't don't say no more about them that's right let him go he said I want to ask you a question he said all right what is it he said Do You Believe believe there is a God he said certainly I believe it he said I believe that as strong as you do I would guess brother brandom and I said do you believe that that same God crossed his strain and was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the person of Jesus Christ in order to save save man he said yes I believe that and he said he died to save sinners like you and I see yes I believe that I said now it's just like this we're all in one big building over here and we're in jail and I can't stand over in this corner and say this will help me get out of jail I stand over in in that corner and say that will help me get out of jail we're all in the same fix and every man that was born in this world was born in sin shaped in iniquity come in the world speaking lies he's a renegade to begin with now this is very interesting he says someone asked the other day said brother brandom if there would be any difference between Adam and Eve and their children today if they were all naked walking in would their bodies be the same I said no sir so I asked brother brand would there be any difference between Adam and Eve and us today in their bodies and he said no sir we was coming home from squirrel hunting brother Fred and I and a bunch of them I said no they wouldn't be the same said you mean Eve wouldn't be a woman like her daughters and Adam wouldn't be a man like his sons I said in many respects but not in all physical respects he said what would be the difference I said they wouldn't have any Naval they were created right they wasn't attached to nothing and as long as that bears there on everything that's born in this world it shows it's a renegade to begin with so Saints if you can look down at your belly today and you got a belly button you were born a renegade to begin with is that right as far as I know we all got one so there ain't no good no bad it don't matter brother John if it's an inie or an Aude if it's on there you was born a renegade you're born that way and he said he said sure there's a difference they wouldn't have an own Neal they wasn't connected to any female to come here see God created them now he says I want to say something every man in this prison house who's holy uh he said who is the one that wasn't born by sex so anybody that thinks they're holy anybody thinks they're righteous anybody thinks they're good he said who which one of us was born without sex and he says doesn't matter what he is we're all in the same prison but God made himself one of his creations and come Beyond sex through the Holy Blood that he created himself and through that blood he redeemed us I said you believe that Papa and he said I believe that I said Christ died for bad man like you now there's only one way to do there's nothing you can do he offers it to knew you you can't Merit it nothing you can do to get it he just gives it to you will you accept what he did for you to keep you from hell he said I'll do that he said but if I could just he goes right back to it again but if I could just get rid of these cigarettes he said the cigarettes will take care of their s he said you just I ain't asking you he says I'm not a legalist I believe in grace oh we need to read that in some message churches today Saints we're not legalists we believe in grace he says all the father was given has given me will come to me I said if you believe that with all your heart he said with all my heart I believe it then will you accept it on those basis that you're not worthy of it he's the one that's worthy don't look at yourself look at him cuz you ain't doing nothing for yourself look at the one that did something for for you that's who we look at today he said what about him he said oh he's worthy I said that's it then except what he gives you he said I do and I baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ and him go out of here and light up a cigarette man he wouldn't make it through a message church today to save his life he baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he went out of there and lit up a cigarette is that right Saints now God has a time and season appointed for everything brother Bram goes on in that quote and I'm going to uh paraphrase it to save a little time he said a few weeks ago he was down at his home place and he saw a vision and then that Vision he he he saw basically what he saw that Papa Cox had fell and he mashed his back up and he found out that they went and took Papa Cox he was laid in the bed and they went and took his cigarettes to him and he said he said that uh they brought the cigarettes to him when he was in the bed and the desire had left him weeks ago see he got the first part right and the rest of it took care of itself amen he said put first things first don't try to get good you're bad to begin with so as long as we can look down and we got a naval we're going to be fighting this flesh we're going to be fighting this human nature and many times we're going to have to wait on the Lord and we don't like to wait in this flesh this flesh wants everything right now we live in a fast food society and we want it fast but they can't get it out the drive-thru fast enough we we we complain about everything we we we can't the the church is too hot I like it 68 degrees and it's 72 degrees and I don't like that I got a wait in line too long at the M McDonald's drive-thru and my internet's too slow and just everything's bad the pews aren't comfortable preacher preached too long service went too long what else was you going to do anyways service is too long so hurry up through service so we can get home and look at our phone for three hours it's a it's a day and age we live in Saints we we can't handle nothing can't handle no inconvenience that's that flesh that we're battling and that space of time between the sewing and the reaping we don't know we do know that if we seow we will reap good or bad if you cast your bread upon the Water it won't return void but we don't know when it will return and so there's a space there that we're waiting on the Lord and that makes us uncomfortable it's difficult to do that if if we stay with it though the Bible said they that wait upon the Lord will renew their strength so if we'll wait on the Lord we'll get stronger while we're waiting now that's what the word said that waiting does you good nobody wants to wait I don't want to wait but it does US good doesn't it you ever planted a garden I don't know how you would here I'm just talking about when I was back East when we had what they called dirt and I would plant a garden you know when you plant that Garden every afternoon you go back out there and check it brother John you go look see if it's grown any see if the tomatoes is blooming yet y'all got Tomatoes here all right they probably don't bloom in this heat but you go check it to see if it's blooming yet to see see if the fruit's ready yet to see if the vegetables are ready every day you go check it you tend to it and and you and you watch it but you can't just keep digging the seed up over and over again it'll never grow you got to plant it and leave it sometimes you got to forget about it but since you cannot Harvest a fruit or a vegetable from that Garden until it's time it's got to be time if you try to harvest in the spring you won't have a harvest if the spring rains come in the fall it ruin the crop everything has a time everything has a season and we can't Harvest until it's ready but we can be prepared for the Harvest remember Sarah and Abraham prepared now everybody thought they was crazy everybody thought they lost their mind but said they went to get the bird eyye I didn't even know what that was I had to look it up they got the bird eyye ready they got the booties ready they got everything ready today we would we would get the nursery ready we'd paint the room the right color and get all the stuff ready they got ready they were expecting the Harvest they were ready when the time came they were preparing the whole time whether it had come or not they were getting ready like it was coming it's like if you pray for rain you better bring an umbrella if you're going to ask God for something believe he's going to give it to you now we don't know the time but we got to believe we got to have faith that he's got Abraham waited 25 years and the Bible said he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God those little women that got prayed for in the pray waited two months but they didn't stagger they were told they were being a reproach they were told they were lost their mind probably that little blind brother the guy little catholic guy that guy prayed for he's blind and he went out and he he was still blind he come back brother BR I thought you said to God heal me he said I thought you said you believe me it didn't say when he healed you he said you just go testify he said he was on the street corner handing out newspapers saying extra extra praise the Lord for healing me extra extra praise the Lord for healing me he was testifying to what the word said not what his circumstances said not what his physical ability said not what his body was saying what the word said they put him in the barber chair making fun of him hey did John did did did did did the Lord Heal you yes the Lord healed me praise the Lord for healing me and his eyes came open he was preparing for the Harvest it was his season it was his time it was time for him well you say well I I'm in one of those bad Seasons right now I I'm struggling here I'm struggling there I'm having a tough time in my family I'm having a tough time in my home or I'm having a tough time at work or I'm having a tough time with my life right now I can't get it all together I'm in one of those seasons and then you say well I hadn't been I hadn't been like Abraham I hadn't been strong like that I hadn't been like those sisters I hadn't held strong to my faith I i' I've I've I've I hadn't been as graceful as I wanted to be I hadn't been I've been complaining too much come on somebody today well I want you to notice Moses hadn't done a super job either Moses knew he was supposed to be delivered but he got ahead of God and tried to do it himself and he slew the Egyptian he ran to the back side of the desert and and brother Brown said that when when he got back there believer's position in Christ paragraph 7 he said when he got On The Backs side of the desert he said Moses got back there he said then Moses lost all the hopes and all the power that he had the man that was sent here to deliver the children of Israel the man that was called to God to do it the man that knew he was called to God to do it he failed he had some troubles he messed up and he got back on the back side of the desert and he lost all the hopes that he had he lost all the power that he had thinking of the freedom thinking that the freedom wasn't for the children of Israel Moses the deliverer got to thinking that the freedom wasn't for the children of Israel he lost all thoughts of Freedom till God met him one day in a burning bush and then when God season came along just exactly then he revealed his plans to Moses now the reason that Moses had forgot about Freedom God's promise that he would free them but God hadn't forgot his promise so you might forget that you're being healed but God hadn't forgot about it the reason Moses forgot about it he had forgot about the promise Moses tried in himself and failed and that's what the church has done many times we've tried in ourself to do things when we fail to find God's element of time you say I hadn't been as gracious as I should have been while I'm waiting on the Lord I've been Moody I've complained a lot I've complained a lot about my situation I've complained about how bad I got it come on somebody and I I felt sorry for myself come on somebody felt sorry for yourself today I I think we've all been guilty of it you might even been angry with the Lord because he hadn't come when you thought he should come brother man said Moses even lost his feeling for the people in bondage he lost all hopes and he lost all the power he had and he'd forgotten about those people that was down in Egypt in bondage he' forgot all about it and sometimes Saints when you're in the middle of the battle you forget that other people are fighting the same devil too we forget when we're talking we're looking around everybody else but we forget that everybody else is fighting the same enemy we're fighting everybody's struggling in some kind of way when you're in the middle of something sometimes you can't seem like you can't see the end of the road you can't see that God's delivering you know I remember back you know when I first got married and and and and me and sister Brandon get into a spat or something I know the rest of y'all ain't never did that I'm just talking about me remember I was an idiot so so you find get into a spad and oh it just seemed like everything's bad everything's wrong the marriage is terrible everything's over we ain't never going to make it out of this and then 30 minutes later we make up and everything's great and never remember it no more see when you're in the middle of the battle everything seems worse you don't see how God can do it you oh I'm so sick in my body I don't see how I can get no better God can heal you and you don't even know he healed you people say it all the time Sister Barbara I got up and I didn't even know I just wasn't hurting anymore and I finally realized after a day or so hey my elbow's not hurting or my knee's not hurting or my chest ain't hurting no more or my back ain't hurting no more God does it so simple we we don't even recognize it sometimes brother said in believer's position in Christ paragraph nine he said God revealed himself to him in a burning bush and he found out that the very thing that was in The Burning Bush was the thing he lacked and the thing that's a whole lot with us today that many times we try to do the program our we failed to get what's in the burning bush the direct revelation of the will and time of God what God would what good would it do you to plant some corn out here today it would rot because this was preached in January he said uh nothing happened he said if no if it happened to sprout in the cold weather would kill the germ it wouldn't work he said we got to have a season for it so then when Moses found out now the real direct will of God and the real time of God and the revelation of everything to do now try to keep him out of Egypt he said now when when Moses found the real thing the real Revelation when he found the real plan of God he said then you couldn't keep him out of Egypt is that right he had a revelation then he knew that it was God's time then he knew that it was the season for it then he had that Revelation in his heart he couldn't keep him out of there he said right down into Egypt he went just as hard as he could go and so Moses knew what the word said about it and the Lord revealed to him that it was time and in the and in the man who once had given up on his people the man who had once lost all his power the man had lost the feeling for his people the man that had lost hope that man that had once done that all of a sudden the man was set on fire by the revelation of God and Saints that's what we need today is God to that's all it's going to take you might be struggling and you might be tested all going to take is a revelation for you all it's going to take is God to set fire to you and then you'll forget all about the trouble you forget all about your failures all you need is a revelation today all you need is God to show you it's time it's your time it's your season it's time when's he going to do it when he's ready so you might be discouraged or might have been discouraged but your season's coming Saints all it takes is revelation all it takes is one time when you're in prayer God to open it up to you and show you it's time now it's the season for it now oh you might have been struggling with this for years you might have some kind of personal issue and you've been struggling for years all it's going to take is a revelation all it's going to take is God to set fire to it you say it's time I'm finished I'm done amen Moses walked down into Egypt and said I'm here and the I am sent me that's all it's going to take Saints for you to walk in to your family and say I'm here the I am has sent me and you're my family and I claim you in the name of Jesus Christ all it's going to take is is the Revelation for you to say I am here healed and I I'm I'm getting better every day I'm getting stronger every day I'm feeling better God quicking to it's my season it's my time and once he shows you the plan there ain't a devil in hell can stop you from it Saints once he shows you his will no you got to tell the devil step aside then you're not listening to it anymore so Saints don't get discouraged today if your time hasn't come yet your season is coming the burning bush is waiting for somebody Moses had to wait 40 years Abraham had to wait 25 years brother brandham waited on the Lord to heal his stomach for years but God is faithful he's faithful brother Brandon watched as thousands were healed that were worse off than him but God is faithful there's a season appointed for each of us there's a season appointed for you today and your season is coming May the musicians come brother John would you come maybe you've been struggling today with your health maybe you've been
