[0:00] turn deer Isaiah 53
[0:08] God hiding himself in Simplicity and
[0:11] revealing himself in the same
[0:14] this brother random opened this message
[0:17] up before the Seven Seals series that he
[0:21] brought to us
[0:22] and we will be
[0:25] um
[0:27] going through this message here starting
[0:29] that paragraph 143
[0:32] I believe it is and are starting at 104
[0:36] ending that paragraph 143
[0:39] two places in the scripture brother
[0:41] random reads here
[0:43] as Isaiah 53 and in Matthew chapter 11
[0:46] we'll just take Isaiah 53. before we
[0:49] read let us pray
[0:51] Lord Jesus to come to you this morning
[0:54] asking you to bless us with your
[0:57] presence
[0:58] bless us with your anointing Upon Our
[1:01] Lives reveal more of your word to us
[1:04] each of us Lord and bless those that are
[1:07] on their way Lord that are coming
[1:09] gathered in your name we give you all
[1:13] the praise the glory and the honor we
[1:15] ask you Lord to take full control of the
[1:18] service speak to our hearts we pray from
[1:21] the youngest one to the oldest one bless
[1:24] the other classes this morning as well
[1:26] we pray in Jesus name amen
[1:30] Isaiah 53 verse 1.
[1:33] who hath believed our report into whom
[1:37] is the arm of the Lord revealed
[1:39] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:42] tender plant and that's a root out of a
[1:45] dry ground he hath no form or calmliness
[1:48] and when we shall see him there's no
[1:51] beauty that we should desire him
[1:54] he's despised and rejected them men a
[1:58] man of sorrow and acquainted with grief
[2:00] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[2:03] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[2:08] yeah I think we will read Matthew
[2:10] chapter 11 if we can turn there quickly
[2:13] verses number 25 and 26
[2:32] and you have that you can say Amen
[2:40] at that time Jesus answered and said I
[2:42] thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and
[2:45] Earth because thou has hid these things
[2:47] from the wise and The Prudent and has
[2:50] revealed them unto babes even so father
[2:53] for so it seemed good in thy sight amen
[2:57] the thing only believe amen
[3:02] [Music]
[3:09] only believe
[3:11] [Music]
[3:13] that all things are possible
[3:19] only believe
[3:24] only believe
[3:30] only believe
[3:33] all things are possible
[3:39] only be I bless you may be seated
[3:43] brother Branham
[3:45] and um
[3:47] now in Isaiah the 53rd chapter of Isaiah
[3:52] the first verse 13.
[3:55] I want to ask this question now this is
[3:57] not pertaining to the Seven Seals at all
[3:59] this is just a message for I know I had
[4:02] to have dedication I couldn't go into
[4:04] that because I wouldn't have time but I
[4:06] thought just for a little dedicational
[4:08] service little memorial service
[4:10] for this church or a little dedicational
[4:13] service brother then they uh
[4:16] they wouldn't be time man to go into
[4:19] what I want to say see on this opening
[4:22] of this book so I will tonight
[4:25] and uh now this is just a little service
[4:28] that it'll blend right in with it also
[4:30] now listen to every word catch it and
[4:33] and if you're taking it on tapes or
[4:35] anything then you stay right with that
[4:39] teaching you don't say nothing but what
[4:40] that tape says just say just exactly
[4:42] what the tape says I think now because
[4:45] some of those things will go to
[4:46] understand a whole lot about this now
[4:48] why it's misunderstood see and you be
[4:51] sure to say just what the tape says
[4:53] don't say nothing else see I don't say
[4:55] that on my own it's him that says it and
[4:59] um so many times confusion people raise
[5:01] up say well so and so said it meant
[5:03] so-and-so yes just leave it it's the way
[5:05] it is that's the way we want the Bible
[5:07] just the way the Bible says it that's
[5:08] the way we want it just just like that
[5:10] don't put on our interpretation to it
[5:12] it's already interpreted
[5:15] now uh
[5:18] who has believed our report and to whom
[5:22] is the arm of the Lord revealed
[5:26] and you read it again now closely
[5:29] who has believed our report question
[5:34] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[5:38] revealed in other words if you have
[5:41] believed our report then the arm of the
[5:44] Lord has been revealed
[5:46] who has believed our report
[5:49] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[5:51] revealed now I want to read also in the
[5:55] book of Saint Matthew's gospel
[5:59] the 11th chapter of Saint Matthew
[6:03] and now you bring your papers and things
[6:05] because constantly we're if you don't
[6:08] have a recorder uh you uh you bring the
[6:11] uh your paper so we can get it the 11th
[6:14] chapter of Saint Matthew the 25th and
[6:19] 26th verses
[6:21] 11 26 and 27.
[6:29] all right
[6:30] Jesus speaking in prayer
[6:35] I want to begin a little bit behind that
[6:38] let's make it the 25th and 26th verse I
[6:43] believe that's where announced though
[6:44] for I had it March in my Bible
[6:47] at that time Jesus answered and said I
[6:51] thank thee Oh father
[6:54] a Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou
[6:57] has hid these things
[7:00] from the wise and prudent
[7:03] and has revealed them unto babes
[7:07] even so father for so it seems good in
[7:13] thy sight
[7:16] catch those two scriptures
[7:19] who has believed our report
[7:23] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[7:26] revealed
[7:28] even
[7:29] stand Jesus thank God that he had hid
[7:33] the mysteries from the wise and prudian
[7:37] and would reveal it to babes such as
[7:41] would learn for it seemed good to God to
[7:44] do that
[7:45] now from this text uh from the scripture
[7:49] reading I draw this text
[7:52] God
[7:53] hiding himself in Simplicity then
[7:58] revealing himself in the same
[8:01] now for the tapes I keep repeating so
[8:04] for the papers because they're they're
[8:06] taping it think God hiding himself
[8:10] in simplicity
[8:13] than revealing himself in the scene
[8:18] it is strange to think how that God does
[8:21] such a thing as that
[8:24] God will hide himself
[8:27] and something so simple that'll cause a
[8:30] wise to miss in a million miles
[8:33] and then turn right back around in that
[8:35] some simple thing in the Simplicity of
[8:39] his way of working and reveal himself
[8:41] right out again
[8:43] I thought it made a a text that we might
[8:45] study this before we go into the the
[8:49] great teachings of the
[8:51] Seven Seals
[8:54] many miss him by the way he reveals
[8:57] himself
[8:58] now man has her own ideas of what God
[9:03] art to be
[9:04] and what God is going to do and as I
[9:07] have made the old statement many times
[9:10] that man Still Remains man man is always
[9:15] giving God praise for what he did do and
[9:19] always looking forward to what he will
[9:21] do and ignoring what he's doing
[9:26] that's the way they miss it they look
[9:28] back and see what a great thing he done
[9:31] but they fail to see what a simple thing
[9:33] he used to do it with
[9:35] you
[9:36] and then they look forward and see a
[9:38] great thing coming
[9:40] that's going to happen and nine times
[9:43] out of ten it's already happening right
[9:44] around him it's so simple that they
[9:47] don't know
[9:51] one day uh a man up here at Utica
[9:55] and if some of his people sure I don't
[9:58] say this for any Affinity radical
[10:01] exposure of the man he was a a veteran
[10:05] of the Civil War
[10:07] and um I believe he was I don't know
[10:10] which side he was on but I believe he
[10:12] was a rebel
[10:13] but he uh he was an infidel
[10:17] and he claimed that there was no such a
[10:20] thing as God
[10:22] he lived in Utica his name of Jim Dorsey
[10:25] many of you people might have known him
[10:27] he's giving him any watermelon when I
[10:29] was the little fella he used to raise
[10:31] watermelons down on the river and the
[10:33] bottoms there and he was quite a friend
[10:35] to my daddy
[10:38] but he said one day
[10:40] one of the great outstanding things that
[10:43] was ever said to him in contrast
[10:46] I was just a little boy in those days
[10:49] but uh in contrast to his belief that
[10:53] caused him to walk away and drop his
[10:56] head and cry
[10:59] and I understood that by this the man
[11:02] was gloriously converted to Christ
[11:06] at the age of about 85 years old
[11:09] he asked the little girl one day who was
[11:12] coming from Sunday school why did she
[11:15] waste your time on doing such a thing as
[11:17] that she said because she believed that
[11:20] there was a god
[11:22] and Mr Darcy said that he said child you
[11:27] are so wrong to believe in such a thing
[11:29] as that
[11:30] and said that the little girl stooped
[11:33] down and picked up a little flower out
[11:38] of the off of the ground pulled it from
[11:41] its petals
[11:42] and said Mr Darcy could you tell me how
[11:47] this lives
[11:50] there it was
[11:53] when he began to search back
[11:57] he could have said to the child what's
[11:59] growing in the Earth
[12:01] and then the questions could revolve
[12:03] back where deers come from how'd that
[12:05] seed get there
[12:07] what happened on on and running on back
[12:09] until he seen
[12:12] see not the great glamorous things that
[12:15] we think about but it's the simple
[12:17] things that God is so real
[12:21] the simplicity
[12:23] so it pleases God to reveal himself
[12:27] and then hide himself then hide himself
[12:30] and reveal himself in simple little
[12:34] things
[12:35] it's it's put over the top of the head
[12:37] of man because if you say why would it
[12:40] just God do that is because that man was
[12:44] made up in the beginning not to try to
[12:48] shift for himself
[12:50] a man was made to rely completely upon
[12:55] God
[12:56] that's the reason we're liking into land
[12:59] there's sheep a sheep cannot lead
[13:01] himself he has to have a leader
[13:04] and the holy spirit's supposed to lead
[13:06] us amen so man is made that way and God
[13:10] made all of his works so simple
[13:14] that the simple could understand it
[13:17] and God makes himself simple with the
[13:20] simple in order to be understood by the
[13:23] sample and otherwise he said in Isaiah
[13:26] 35 I believe he said the fool should not
[13:30] error therein it's so simple and we know
[13:34] that God is so great
[13:36] do we expect it to be some great
[13:39] something
[13:40] and we miss the simple thing
[13:43] we stumble over simplicity
[13:48] that's how we miss God Is by stumbling
[13:51] over simplicity
[13:55] God is so simple until the scholars of
[13:58] these days and all days missing a
[14:01] million miles
[14:03] because in their intellects they know
[14:06] that there's nothing lacking so great
[14:10] but in his Revelation he makes it so
[14:13] simple they go Plumb over the top of it
[14:15] and miss it
[14:17] now study that stud it all and you
[14:22] people who are visiting here when you go
[14:24] to your motel rooms take those things
[14:27] and ponder over them we don't have time
[14:29] to break it down as it should be broke
[14:32] down but I want you to do it when you
[14:34] get to the motel or hotel or wherever
[14:36] you're staying or the home gather
[14:37] together and study over it miss him by
[14:42] the way that he reveals himself or he is
[14:45] so great yet hides himself in Simplicity
[14:51] to make himself known to the least
[14:57] see don't try to get the great because
[14:59] he goes over the top of it
[15:01] but listen to the Simplicity of God and
[15:06] then you find God now you're in the
[15:08] simple ways
[15:10] High polished worthy wisdom educated
[15:14] always misses him
[15:16] now I'm not here and there I know there
[15:20] are School teachers two or three that I
[15:22] know of setting in here and I'm not here
[15:24] to
[15:25] contradict school and education and try
[15:29] to support illiteriness I'm not here for
[15:31] that but what it is the people as Soul
[15:35] play so much upon that
[15:39] until they're even in the seminaries and
[15:41] so forth they're missing the very thing
[15:44] that God has left before them
[15:49] that's why uh not against brother who
[15:53] are in denominations
[15:55] but I'm against system of denominations
[15:58] because it tries to magnify uh itself
[16:03] and and and educate its ministers and
[16:06] such such a place until if they don't
[16:08] have the proper schooling and education
[16:11] they're ousted and and they have to
[16:13] stand the psychiatrist test and so forth
[16:15] I've never think that it was God's will
[16:18] to test the minister by Psychiatry but
[16:21] to testing by the word
[16:23] [Music]
[16:25] would be God's way of testing his man
[16:28] that he sent out to have the word preach
[16:32] the word
[16:33] now today we preach philosophy we preach
[16:37] Creed and denominationalism and so many
[16:40] things in leaving off the word because
[16:43] they say it can't be understood it can
[16:46] be understood he promised to do it now
[16:49] we're asking him to do it now we're
[16:52] going to take a few characters here for
[16:54] a few minutes let's notice in the days
[16:57] of Noah nors they
[17:02] God seen worldly wisdom so greatly
[17:06] punctuated and respected he sent a
[17:10] simple message by a simple person to
[17:14] show them his greatness
[17:17] now we know that in the day of of Noah
[17:22] they claim that a civilization was so
[17:27] mighty than until we have never reached
[17:30] that spot yet in our modern civilization
[17:34] and I believe that it will finally be
[17:37] reached because our lord said as it was
[17:39] in the days of Noah so will it be at the
[17:42] coming of the son of man and he gave
[17:44] some illustration
[17:46] and they built the Pyramid in the speaks
[17:49] are in Egypt and they built gigantic
[17:52] things that we have no power today to
[17:55] build such with
[17:57] it they had a an embalming if they could
[18:00] embalm a body to make it look so natural
[18:02] until it still stays today we cannot we
[18:06] cannot make a mummy today we're having
[18:08] the stuff to make it with
[18:10] they had colors that that hold so fast
[18:13] for four or five thousand years ago it
[18:16] still remains just the same color it was
[18:18] see we don't have no such as that today
[18:20] and many great things of that
[18:23] Civilization uh
[18:26] speaks of its superiority over our
[18:29] modern civilization
[18:31] and so you can imagine how education and
[18:34] science of such great tokens that we
[18:37] have left that there was such a
[18:39] civilization what the what a great
[18:43] civilization that must be well these
[18:45] memorials how that science and and
[18:50] modern civilization and education was
[18:54] was uh a must with the people they must
[18:58] be it had to be
[19:01] there was hardly any I guess India
[19:03] literacy among them at all
[19:06] and so God's searching through that
[19:08] great economy at that day in their
[19:11] systems could not perhaps find the right
[19:15] type of a man until he found on
[19:18] illiterate maybe farmer
[19:21] by the name of Noah a sheep herder
[19:25] and he gave him his message to preach to
[19:28] the people that was so simple to the
[19:31] their scholarships of that day until the
[19:35] people stumbled over the Simplicity of
[19:38] the message
[19:39] and yet the message was in the face of
[19:43] science radical
[19:46] how could there be rain in the skies
[19:48] when there was no rain up there
[19:51] and the simple message of of building an
[19:54] ark constructing is something to get
[19:57] into that there's no water to float it
[19:59] why become a fanatic
[20:04] I need to become a a
[20:07] uh what we would call if you'd excuse
[20:10] the expression of today
[20:13] a oddball
[20:16] and nearly all God's people are oddballs
[20:20] they are
[20:22] I'm glad to be one of them amen so you
[20:25] know they they're different from the the
[20:28] Modern Trend of civilization
[20:31] so they become odd
[20:34] strange he said his people wants to
[20:36] Peculiar people oh it strange but a
[20:41] spiritual priesthood a royal Nation
[20:45] offering spiritual sacrifices to God the
[20:48] fruits of their lips giving praise to
[20:50] his name what a what a people
[20:55] got him
[20:57] and notice now what a great thing that
[21:01] must have been in that day for some
[21:04] fanatic to come forth to the church
[21:08] of fanatics and preaching a gospel that
[21:12] was seemingly uh all out of line to
[21:16] their way of believing
[21:18] and scientists well it was simply crazy
[21:24] how they could scientifically prove
[21:27] there was no rain there but this simple
[21:29] sheep herder believed if God said it
[21:34] would rain it would rain
[21:38] and so they just compare that with the
[21:41] day about some money gets healed they
[21:45] say it's only emotion
[21:47] uh I can scientifically prove to you
[21:50] that the cancer of the substance are are
[21:54] the thing is still there
[21:56] but to the simple believer
[21:59] is gone see because he's not looking at
[22:04] the substance he's looking at the
[22:05] promise just the same as Noah did so
[22:09] don't you see as it was in the days of
[22:12] Noah so shall it be in the coming of the
[22:16] son of man
[22:17] scientifically
[22:19] no one the doctor could say look at your
[22:22] your lump is still there
[22:25] your cancer remains your arm is as
[22:28] crippled As It Ever Was you're crazy
[22:31] and remember that that same Spirit from
[22:34] the days of Noah that said
[22:37] there's no rain up there we can shoot
[22:39] the moon with instruments and there's no
[22:41] rain there but if God said there would
[22:44] be rain there for faith is the substance
[22:48] of things hoped for the evidence the
[22:51] things have not seen and Faith takes its
[22:54] final resting place on the word of God
[22:57] that's where it Finds Its resting place
[23:00] if you understand it's resting places on
[23:04] God's word that's where Noah arrested it
[23:06] God said so
[23:07] that's settled
[23:09] now if you notice again then now Noah is
[23:14] believing such was a fanatic

[1:12:28] stand have you stand and take one
[1:12:31] portion in the word of God very familiar
[1:12:33] texts in Mark chapter 11.

[1:12:44] good friend amen we've the Lord hand of
[1:12:47] praise and his wife and family I've
[1:12:50] known them for many years way before I
[1:12:52] was married in Sacramento we used to
[1:12:55] paint together and he's he's been here
[1:12:58] in the cities originally from here but I
[1:13:00] met him in California and we just a lot
[1:13:03] of water under the bridge with her
[1:13:05] brother and he's here today and so we
[1:13:07] appreciate him
[1:13:09] I know some of you Saints have saw his
[1:13:11] name in the prayer request but there's
[1:13:13] the the prayer request made flesh right
[1:13:16] there that's him amen
[1:13:18] in um
[1:13:20] Saint what what did I call Mark 11.
[1:13:24] Saint Mark chapter 11.
[1:13:28] for our scripture reading
[1:13:39] and
[1:13:45] this is our lord Jesus speaking here
[1:13:56] verse number 12.
[1:14:05] and on the morrow
[1:14:07] when they were come from Bethany he was
[1:14:09] hungry
[1:14:11] and seeing a fig tree afar off having
[1:14:14] leaves he came if happy
[1:14:17] he might find anything there on
[1:14:20] and when he came to it he found nothing
[1:14:22] but leaves for the time of figs was not
[1:14:26] yet
[1:14:27] and Jesus answered and said unto it no
[1:14:31] man eat fruit of the Hereafter forever
[1:14:36] and his disciples heard it
[1:14:39] verse 22
[1:14:41] Jesus answering and saith unto them have
[1:14:44] faith in God
[1:14:46] verily I say unto you that whosoever
[1:14:48] shall say unto this mountain
[1:14:50] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:14:53] the sea shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:14:56] shall believe that those things which ye
[1:14:59] saith shall come to pass he shall have
[1:15:02] whatsoever he saith
[1:15:05] this scripture at stumped the prophet as
[1:15:08] he called it for many years and so much
[1:15:11] that he would not preach on it
[1:15:13] it held him back because he couldn't see
[1:15:15] how a man can say whatever he wanted to
[1:15:20] say according to Jesus and if he
[1:15:23] believed in his heart that God would
[1:15:26] give it to him he couldn't understand
[1:15:27] that verse 24 therefore I say unto you
[1:15:30] whatsoever things you desire When you
[1:15:33] pray believe that you receive them and
[1:15:36] you shall have them and when ye stand
[1:15:38] praying forgive and if you have ought
[1:15:41] against any that your father also which
[1:15:44] is in heaven May forgive you of your
[1:15:46] trespasses but if you do not forgive
[1:15:48] neither will your father which is in
[1:15:51] heaven forgive your trespasses amen
[1:15:55] amen we thank God for the reading of his
[1:15:58] word
[1:15:59] there was one more place to think I
[1:16:01] wanted to take here but we'll pray right
[1:16:04] there
[1:16:05] let's pray
[1:16:06] Heavenly Father
[1:16:08] we ask your blessings upon us this
[1:16:10] morning we read your most holy word two
[1:16:14] portions in this scripture of you
[1:16:17] speaking to a fig tree
[1:16:20] and you
[1:16:23] spoke to it in such a way that somehow
[1:16:27] it heard you
[1:16:29] and it obeyed you
[1:16:31] and you spoke to the winds and the waves
[1:16:35] and it somehow it heard you and it
[1:16:38] obeyed you
[1:16:40] Lord I pray that we will hear you
[1:16:43] and we would obey you this morning
[1:16:45] that's my prayer we ask in Jesus name
[1:16:49] amen God bless you may be seated
[1:16:52] let me ask you something does that did
[1:16:54] that fig tree have ears
[1:16:59] does the wind and the waves have ears
[1:17:04] to hear
[1:17:06] Jesus spoke to him in whatever language
[1:17:09] Jesus used Aramaic or Hebrew whatever
[1:17:12] language he used he spoke and that tree
[1:17:16] heard it
[1:17:18] amen the disciples heard it too
[1:17:22] and the next day they went to see the
[1:17:25] tree and it had been cursed from The
[1:17:28] Roots
[1:17:30] and this really uh got the attention of
[1:17:34] the disciples now I want to read
[1:17:37] something from the message just for a
[1:17:38] moment what the prophet says here
[1:17:42] about this scripture it's in the message
[1:17:45] I stand at the door and knock
[1:17:47] 1957. I'm going to read two places there
[1:17:51] stand at the door and knock and he says
[1:17:53] this same statement again speak to this
[1:17:55] mountain 1957.
[1:17:58] I know I didn't give you this somebody
[1:18:00] says so you all got to work real hard
[1:18:03] back there to follow me this morning for
[1:18:05] the part that I didn't give you
[1:18:08] brother Branham says this and I want you
[1:18:12] to listen to this closely and we'll
[1:18:13] trust it this will bless your heart and
[1:18:16] we'll we'll
[1:18:18] let the Lord have his way in our life is
[1:18:21] that what you want this morning
[1:18:23] are you are you ready to leave already
[1:18:29] did you come here to get a glass of
[1:18:31] water
[1:18:32] did you come here to use the bathroom
[1:18:34] [Music]
[1:18:36] it's like so some people come here so I
[1:18:38] can go use the bathroom
[1:18:41] we come here to hear the word of the
[1:18:42] Lord I trust that something will be said
[1:18:46] to bless you to help you to encourage
[1:18:50] you along the way
[1:18:52] I mean I know we started a bit late and
[1:18:54] we'll make up the time here all right
[1:18:56] and this message is paragraph 58 you
[1:19:00] must open that door of faith and let him
[1:19:04] in then he will give you the desire of
[1:19:06] your heart
[1:19:07] he that wadeth upon the Lord shall renew
[1:19:11] his strength
[1:19:12] they shall Mount up like eagles they
[1:19:15] shall run and not be weary they shall
[1:19:18] walk and not faint
[1:19:20] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:19:24] you ask what you will it'll be given to
[1:19:27] you
[1:19:28] oh verily I say unto you if you if thou
[1:19:32] shall say to this mountain be removed
[1:19:35] and in the original Greek Lexicon says
[1:19:38] be raised up and thrown into the sea and
[1:19:43] believe that it's being done oh my I
[1:19:46] believe that it's being done you shall
[1:19:49] have what you say certainly oh I don't
[1:19:53] have to ha it don't have to be
[1:19:55] spontaneous
[1:19:56] spontaneously it don't have to be that
[1:19:59] way certainly not just as long as you
[1:20:02] believe it there is where Christians
[1:20:04] fail today
[1:20:06] he says that again and speak to this
[1:20:08] mountain paragraph number nine he says
[1:20:10] and to think that Jehovah God who could
[1:20:14] shed forth his great Glory as we look
[1:20:16] towards heaven and the stars and the
[1:20:19] solar system is more than dust in his
[1:20:21] hand and he'd be so concerned that even
[1:20:24] when Jesus of Nazareth passed by that
[1:20:28] simple fig tree
[1:20:30] and looked upon it as if it to find
[1:20:33] something to eat he said no man eat from
[1:20:35] thee in the original Greek it says for a
[1:20:39] season
[1:20:40] which the word forever only means for a
[1:20:45] season
[1:20:46] forever is the space of time because
[1:20:48] it's forever and conjunction forever but
[1:20:51] an eternity has no beginning or ending
[1:20:55] so he said no man eat it for from thee
[1:20:58] for a season
[1:21:00] now you notice immediately something
[1:21:03] happened to that tree though it didn't
[1:21:05] show that it happened and on the next
[1:21:08] day they passed by Peter looked at the
[1:21:11] tree and he said behold the fig tree
[1:21:13] without curse yesterday is drying up
[1:21:16] something had taken place
[1:21:20] he looked at them and said verily I say
[1:21:22] unto you if you should say to this
[1:21:24] mountain and be removed and cast into
[1:21:25] the sea and don't doubt in your heart
[1:21:27] now on the original it says this
[1:21:30] the Greek Lexicon it says if you should
[1:21:33] say to this mountain be lifted up and
[1:21:36] thrown into the sea don't doubt it in
[1:21:39] your heart but believe that it is being
[1:21:42] done you shall have what you say
[1:21:46] we are looking for things so spontaneous
[1:21:50] but what did he mean you look at the
[1:21:54] mountain and say be thou lifted up and
[1:21:57] thrown into the sea then in your heart
[1:21:59] believe that what you have said is
[1:22:03] taking place now you don't see it taking
[1:22:07] place but it is taking place because the
[1:22:11] word can't lie everything else can lie
[1:22:15] everything else can let you down
[1:22:17] everything else can have a a question
[1:22:20] mark but not the word of God there is no
[1:22:23] question marks on his word when we read
[1:22:26] it we just say Amen even if we can't
[1:22:29] explain it even if I can't preach on it
[1:22:32] yet it's still God's word
[1:22:34] and it will do exactly what it said it
[1:22:37] will do amen I trust the Lord will bless
[1:22:40] you this morning
[1:22:42] amen
[1:22:44] believe that it's being done
[1:22:47] that's the tall mountain in my life
[1:22:50] that's a tall order to ask a mountain to
[1:22:55] be lifted up and thrown into the sea
[1:22:58] but if you say it and believe it in your
[1:23:02] heart what did Jesus say maybe it'll
[1:23:05] work no he did not say maybe it'll work
[1:23:07] he said it is being done it's already
[1:23:10] done it's happening you can have
[1:23:13] whatever you say whatever you say
[1:23:18] amen
[1:23:20] now praise the Lord I feel good this
[1:23:22] morning
[1:23:23] and this great message on the third pool
[1:23:27] we've been talking as we took Saint John
[1:23:29] chapter 6.
[1:23:31] and was bringing that the last couple of
[1:23:34] services on how Jesus's Ministry
[1:23:36] consisted of those three pools
[1:23:39] and brother Branham brings that out to
[1:23:41] us and how his ministry consisted of
[1:23:44] those three pools and how there is a
[1:23:47] promise of the third pool to the
[1:23:50] believer
[1:23:52] it's something that you're attracted to
[1:23:55] you know there's there's deep things in
[1:23:57] the word of God that you can't explain
[1:23:59] but you're attracted to it
[1:24:01] you want the understanding to it you
[1:24:03] might not know what it is but there's
[1:24:05] something that pulls you towards it
[1:24:08] and it's it's something clean
[1:24:12] it's something Noble
[1:24:14] it's a key
[1:24:16] it's something that will change your
[1:24:18] direction something that'll give you
[1:24:21] faith and power to overcome
[1:24:24] you know he's got it you know it's in
[1:24:27] the word but you can't articulate it
[1:24:30] quite right you can't explain it just
[1:24:33] right but you know that God's got the
[1:24:36] answer for you so what do you do you
[1:24:39] stay faithful
[1:24:40] you stay with the word you stay in his
[1:24:44] presence and he might drop a crumb to
[1:24:47] you
[1:24:48] Hallelujah and he might open up
[1:24:51] something to you
[1:24:53] that's more precious than gold more
[1:24:57] precious than a promotion on a job
[1:25:00] more precious than anything in this
[1:25:02] world
[1:25:04] we desire that don't we
[1:25:06] they're called Mysteries
[1:25:08] it's a mystery until it's revealed
[1:25:12] and then once it's been revealed the
[1:25:15] mystery is now history
[1:25:18] as brother banham tells us in Christ The
[1:25:21] Mystery of God revealed I don't have to
[1:25:22] quote here with me but that mystery is a
[1:25:27] mystery to those until it's been
[1:25:29] revealed once it's revealed
[1:25:31] it's a history remember he preached the
[1:25:35] uh Services since the end of the time
[1:25:39] three years later he's referring back to
[1:25:42] it and he's telling the people remember
[1:25:44] the sirs is this the time message
[1:25:47] division the rock the blast the unknown
[1:25:52] writing he says that it was a mystery
[1:25:55] three years ago but it's been revealed
[1:25:59] now the mystery is history and history
[1:26:04] is his story
[1:26:07] not your story or my story his story if
[1:26:12] it ain't his story it ain't history and
[1:26:15] ain't worth reading about
[1:26:17] but when God says anything you might not
[1:26:20] know what it means today but if he opens
[1:26:23] it up to you then Revelation becomes
[1:26:26] story
[1:26:29] praise the Lord
[1:26:31] it's the beauty
[1:26:33] of this great message
[1:26:36] so we brought a few things on that third
[1:26:37] pool as brother Branham had brought it
[1:26:39] to us and shared some of those things in
[1:26:42] the ministry of Jesus
[1:26:46] then we brought how we know that there's
[1:26:48] a great persecution coming the prophet
[1:26:51] warned us of it told us thus saith the
[1:26:53] Lord the great enemy
[1:26:56] to the church has always been Rome
[1:27:00] and those forces will join together
[1:27:04] again
[1:27:06] to bring a persecution upon the church
[1:27:09] how many no that's true
[1:27:11] let me know we're not looking for
[1:27:13] America to turn back to God
[1:27:16] and get back better again
[1:27:19] uh uh how many know we're not looking
[1:27:22] for a great Revival to take place
[1:27:24] amongst the church world out there
[1:27:28] but that the Revival the taking place of
[1:27:32] the word opening happens to individuals
[1:27:35] and those individuals should be you and
[1:27:38] I
[1:27:39] and the ministry of the third pool has
[1:27:42] an attraction to the believer
[1:27:45] it's very mysterious we don't understand
[1:27:48] it fully but it's opening up more and
[1:27:51] more to us
[1:27:54] and the prophet of God deals with this a
[1:27:57] little bit in the message I'm going to
[1:27:59] take this message the anointed ones at
[1:28:01] the end time
[1:28:02] I want you to notice what he says here
[1:28:04] in paragraph 238
[1:28:07] on my end it's different than maybe in
[1:28:09] some of the tablets or phones but I
[1:28:12] think the sisters can pick this up
[1:28:13] notice Revelation 16 13 to 14. between
[1:28:19] the sixth and seventh vow I want you to
[1:28:23] hear this three unclean spirits like
[1:28:26] frogs did you notice that went out of
[1:28:29] the mouth of someone now notice quickly
[1:28:32] are you ready say Amen
[1:28:35] a trinity of spirits
[1:28:38] and now denominational brother set still
[1:28:41] just a minute don't get up and walk out
[1:28:43] of the room back out there on this radio
[1:28:46] telephone hookup don't turn your tape
[1:28:47] recorder off is that still just a minute
[1:28:50] to listen you're born of God you will
[1:28:53] a trinity of frogs a frog is an animal
[1:28:57] that always looks backwards
[1:29:00] he never looks where he's going he looks
[1:29:03] where he comes from see don't you see
[1:29:07] where was trinitarianism born at
[1:29:10] remember three unclean spirits
[1:29:12] individual Spirits are you getting it
[1:29:15] notice they look back to the nicer
[1:29:18] Council where the Trinity Doctrine was
[1:29:20] born at not in the Bible there's no such
[1:29:24] a thing they look back in the nine city
[1:29:27] council at night Rome where the Trinity
[1:29:29] was born at notice where they come from
[1:29:32] notice and The Trinity of frogs came out
[1:29:35] of an old Trinity give birth to a new
[1:29:39] Trinity their mother what did it come
[1:29:42] out of a trinity the dragon scene the
[1:29:46] Beast and the false prophet a trinity
[1:29:49] knew when
[1:29:52] when were these frogs come out when did
[1:29:54] when did it notice they was there all
[1:29:58] the time but it wasn't manifested until
[1:30:02] between the sixth and the seventh vile
[1:30:06] just before the seals open
[1:30:09] to reveal it
[1:30:11] for in the message of the seven Angel
[1:30:13] the mysteries of God will be known
[1:30:16] all these trinitarian things and false
[1:30:19] baptisms and everything was to be made
[1:30:21] manifest God help us to see what's truth
[1:30:26] and not think it's somebody trying to
[1:30:29] say something
[1:30:30] I feel that Spirit resenting
[1:30:33] that you see I'm not speaking of myself
[1:30:36] brother I'm speaking of the Angel of the
[1:30:38] Lord that's in the camp that's exactly
[1:30:40] right notice a trinity the dragon how
[1:30:43] many knows what the dragon was
[1:30:45] it was Rome and the dragon stood before
[1:30:49] the woman to devour her child as soon as
[1:30:51] it was born that's right what does the
[1:30:54] beast mean in the bible a power all
[1:30:56] right false prophet false prophet a
[1:31:00] false anointed one see started where
[1:31:04] this false prophet singular false
[1:31:08] prophet the first pope and from there
[1:31:11] come out the and the mother of
[1:31:14] harlots the whole thing
[1:31:16] false Trinity was Rising not in the
[1:31:20] early days wouldn't be made manifest in
[1:31:22] the early days it went right on through
[1:31:25] with it but when the Seven Seals become
[1:31:29] and open those Mysteries and revealed
[1:31:33] them that's when the frogs the unclean
[1:31:36] spirits like frogs come out to manifest
[1:31:40] themselves
[1:31:42] a trinity Doctrine against the truth
[1:31:46] y'all reading that up there
[1:31:48] that's not me right that's a prophet you
[1:31:51] could say Amen
[1:31:53] so it was after the seals had opened up
[1:31:57] he says they were always there it was
[1:32:00] always hidden there but the word of the
[1:32:03] Lord being revealed manifested other
[1:32:05] spirits all right
[1:32:09] see where it come from
[1:32:10] where it's going back to ecumenical
[1:32:13] council they're all Brothers anyhow Same
[1:32:16] Spirit same thing and watch so deceiving
[1:32:18] performing Miracles and these are devils
[1:32:21] that go forth to all the gods of the
[1:32:24] earth working miracles to deceive them
[1:32:26] in the last days and we'll succeed in
[1:32:29] doing it what did God say about that
[1:32:31] evil spirit he said I'll go down and get
[1:32:34] into the mouth of those prophets because
[1:32:36] cause them to prophesy a lie to cause
[1:32:40] Ahab to come out there to be destroyed
[1:32:43] that's second Kings chapter 22.
[1:32:49] God said go you will succeed you will
[1:32:53] get them to believe it they're not on
[1:32:55] the that word to begin with see go for
[1:32:59] you will persuade him you'll be the one
[1:33:02] will do it when you get in those false
[1:33:05] prophets because he's relying right on
[1:33:08] them and he don't know nothing about the
[1:33:10] word neither will he try to learn about
[1:33:13] it he can't do it because he's a thistle
[1:33:17] to begin with seeing you'll succeed look
[1:33:21] here at these false frogs looking back
[1:33:24] while you know what they said back there
[1:33:27] at niacia so here the prophet is now
[1:33:30] opening up in Revelations chapter 16.
[1:33:34] this false Trinity that would be
[1:33:37] revealed in the last days
[1:33:40] they come to light after the word had
[1:33:43] been revealed
[1:33:45] the word had to be spoken
[1:33:47] the word had to be revealed and once the
[1:33:50] word is revealed it uncovers everything
[1:33:54] not just the things of light but it
[1:33:57] uncovers what darkness is it uncovers
[1:34:01] what sin is the Pharisees were okay
[1:34:04] until Jesus came and when Jesus came and
[1:34:07] spoke the truth his truth revealed the
[1:34:11] lie that they were living under and
[1:34:13] that's what any truth will do it reveals
[1:34:16] the lies the darkness the hidden things
[1:34:20] so that you can know how to overcome to
[1:34:23] recognize the enemy and his tactics and
[1:34:26] then you can overcome
[1:34:28] pretty powerful
[1:34:31] and this is why the third pool means so
[1:34:33] much to us this opening of the word even
[1:34:37] though we don't have all the details of
[1:34:39] it maybe or how to operate it because
[1:34:41] it's a very deep and vast subject even
[1:34:45] in the prophet's life remember he always
[1:34:47] questions is this that third pool Lord
[1:34:51] or is this the furthermen of my Ministry
[1:34:55] now when he preached the message my new
[1:34:58] ministry
[1:34:59] he is now explaining to the people for
[1:35:02] one of the first times what this great
[1:35:05] uh uh uh this super anointing did to him
[1:35:09] as it pertains to speaking into creation
[1:35:13] he had the God had given him this
[1:35:17] scripture in Matthew in Mark chapter 11
[1:35:20] to open it up to him what it meant
[1:35:23] so God was training him what Mark
[1:35:27] chapter 11 meant
[1:35:29] he could not understand how that would
[1:35:31] apply uh outside of the atonement how
[1:35:35] that could could apply even though Jesus
[1:35:38] hadn't given his life yet
[1:35:41] and he he gave explanations for it he
[1:35:44] stayed away from it until the Lord began
[1:35:46] to open up to him what the new ministry
[1:35:50] was
[1:35:51] if you you study it a little bit more
[1:35:53] you'll see that it's connected to the
[1:35:56] third pool has the elements of it but
[1:35:59] it's interesting he doesn't really
[1:36:00] identify it as a third pull he just
[1:36:03] identifies it as his new ministry
[1:36:06] and how he had to keep climbing up
[1:36:09] remember when the Lord came to him and
[1:36:12] told him he would have a gift taken to
[1:36:14] the people of the world it would start
[1:36:17] with signs wonders and miracles is that
[1:36:20] right
[1:36:21] and then what did the angel tell him if
[1:36:23] you'll be sincere
[1:36:25] and humble
[1:36:27] then it'll get greater and greater
[1:36:30] you know what happens is if you get more
[1:36:34] Revelation and you don't get the
[1:36:36] humility with the Revelation then you
[1:36:39] got a bad attitude on you where you can
[1:36:42] be right but your spirit ain't right
[1:36:44] and it's very very it's more treacherous
[1:36:48] of amongst those of us who have the real
[1:36:51] word for us to fall in that trap because
[1:36:55] we do have the real word but if the
[1:36:57] humility doesn't come with it then
[1:37:00] there's a trap setting there for you to
[1:37:03] raise up and think you're better and no
[1:37:06] more than God and then even begin to
[1:37:09] correct the prophets
[1:37:12] mm-hmm
[1:37:14] so not just
[1:37:15] not just the revelation we need a thorn
[1:37:18] yeah
[1:37:20] amen we need a thorn
[1:37:23] the Apostle Paul had a thorn in his
[1:37:25] flesh
[1:37:26] through the abundance of Revelations
[1:37:30] and I sought the Lord to get this thing
[1:37:33] off of me Lord I'm sure I can serve you
[1:37:37] better if I all my bills are paid
[1:37:41] I know I can serve you better if they
[1:37:44] give me a a raise on the job
[1:37:47] if I make more money Lord of all my
[1:37:49] family and my my my all my friends and
[1:37:52] family and brothers and sisters are all
[1:37:55] saved I'll serve you better
[1:37:58] that's all you think
[1:38:00] but every one of us has a thorn
[1:38:03] job had one Paul had one the apostles
[1:38:07] had one Jesus had one
[1:38:12] yes and this keeps you on the road to
[1:38:15] Damascus
[1:38:17] this keeps you in the dust looking for
[1:38:20] God to purge out everything that's not
[1:38:23] like you
[1:38:25] know as he opens up more of his word we
[1:38:28] need him to open up more of humility
[1:38:33] not to see how big I can be how great I
[1:38:36] can be let's see how little I can be how
[1:38:41] less popular I can be
[1:38:44] we do things to be popular are we doing
[1:38:47] things to be unpopular
[1:38:51] yeah
[1:38:52] yes
[1:38:54] post those videos of ourselves preaching
[1:38:57] so somebody can get saved or so they can
[1:38:59] hear us preach
[1:39:01] y'all ain't gonna say Amen but it's true
[1:39:04] yet the same
[1:39:06] we're not in this to get popular
[1:39:08] we're in this to get in the Rapture to
[1:39:12] leave out of here with the changing of
[1:39:14] the body
[1:39:15] amen when I needed to have a bunch of
[1:39:18] friends we're not in there to be wealthy
[1:39:21] we're not here to be in no problems
[1:39:23] we're here to make the rapture
[1:39:27] the tribulation is not our getting out
[1:39:29] of here
[1:39:31] the Rapture is how we get out of here
[1:39:34] and if I was supposed to go through the
[1:39:36] tribulation I could have stayed in the
[1:39:37] denomination but he called me out under
[1:39:40] this great voice
[1:39:42] so that I can make the rapture right
[1:39:44] amen
[1:39:45] so let's take this new ministry just for
[1:39:47] a few moments
[1:39:49] amen
[1:39:52] amen amen so we know that there's a
[1:39:54] great persecution coming
[1:39:56] we talked about it we read about it a
[1:39:59] little bit
[1:40:00] let me just hit on that just a little
[1:40:01] bit on what brother Branham talks about
[1:40:04] the great enemy Rome
[1:40:06] he says this here
[1:40:10] get it for you here
[1:40:17] oh my
[1:40:19] Daniel had a vision
[1:40:21] and Daniel chapter 5. remember that
[1:40:24] vision of the end time Daniel chapter 7
[1:40:26] and Daniel chapter 5 and Daniel chapter
[1:40:29] 2 of the image the head of gold and of
[1:40:33] silver and then the waste of brass and
[1:40:36] the legs of iron and the feet of iron
[1:40:39] and clay
[1:40:40] and that iron and Clay spoke of
[1:40:44] these are governments
[1:40:46] these are nations that ruled under the
[1:40:49] Gentile Kingdom can I get a witness
[1:40:52] and you know today you hear people just
[1:40:55] squealing and crying about communism
[1:40:59] and what the Liberals is doing to us
[1:41:03] oh yeah I know where exactly where I'm
[1:41:05] at this morning
[1:41:07] is this a red state or a blue state
[1:41:11] uh-huh
[1:41:13] and we get caught up in that don't we
[1:41:16] come on tell the truth shame the devil
[1:41:19] we get caught up in it
[1:41:22] and the preachers got caught up in it
[1:41:24] too
[1:41:26] and brother Banner says they would
[1:41:27] holler and cry about communism
[1:41:32] and he said it just made him sick that
[1:41:34] these preachers are talking about
[1:41:36] communism when God rose up communism for
[1:41:41] a purpose
[1:41:43] huh
[1:41:45] and he uses that in his hands
[1:41:49] oh my if I can get it for you here
[1:41:51] quickly all right
[1:41:54] it was a two or three of them I wanted
[1:41:55] to read for you
[1:41:56] but he says that God rose that up to to
[1:42:00] persecute the because of the
[1:42:03] filthiness of the Catholic Church here
[1:42:05] it is right here he says this in the
[1:42:07] message the seven Church ages 1954.
[1:42:13] he says
[1:42:16] now just as Israel come in it's Beauty
[1:42:19] back in the beginning under Abraham come
[1:42:22] down through the Patriots and then the
[1:42:25] day of Ahab it went into the Dark Ages
[1:42:27] darkest age of the church scene see went
[1:42:31] out there and in that time how that Ahab
[1:42:35] Mary Jezebel brought idolatry into the
[1:42:37] Orthodox Church
[1:42:39] the same thing that protestantism
[1:42:42] married romanism in the 1500 years of
[1:42:47] the Dark Ages in perimist church and
[1:42:50] come out with idolatry under the form of
[1:42:52] Christianity going on out into a
[1:42:55] lukewarm age that's coming on before us
[1:43:01] but the battle continues in the message
[1:43:03] uh the mark of the beast
[1:43:06] 1954 he says this paragraph 134 he says
[1:43:11] that's the red dragon the devil where's
[1:43:16] his seat at not in Russia in Rome
[1:43:20] said the devil give him his seat and his
[1:43:23] authority red dragon not Russia I hear
[1:43:28] great Minister saying that the Russian
[1:43:31] is the Antichrist why the Russian has
[1:43:35] nothing to do with the Antichrist that's
[1:43:39] communism the faultry of the
[1:43:41] protestantism and Catholicism has
[1:43:45] produced communism the reasons the
[1:43:48] Russians drove them out there because
[1:43:49] they had all the money had all the
[1:43:52] prayers said to them saints and so they
[1:43:54] built the biggest buildings had all the
[1:43:56] wealth of the people bundled it up like
[1:43:59] that and they seen me live no different
[1:44:01] it was not different from any of the
[1:44:03] rest of the world and they spewed it out
[1:44:06] and formed communism now if you get one
[1:44:09] more night if God does I'll prove to you
[1:44:12] that communism is working straight in
[1:44:16] the hands of almighty God to destroy the
[1:44:21] Roman and remember I say this is God's
[1:44:24] prophet the Russian Empire will drop an
[1:44:28] atomic bomb of some sort on the Vatican
[1:44:31] City and destroy it in one hour
[1:44:34] thus saith the Lord and the Bible said
[1:44:39] that God took them cruel-hearted men and
[1:44:42] put them in his hands and they were
[1:44:44] instruments in his hands to fulfill his
[1:44:47] will and to bring back to bring back to
[1:44:51] her exactly what she had coming to her
[1:44:55] continues on a little bit more and he
[1:44:57] says this here all right
[1:45:01] glory to God
[1:45:04] amen
[1:45:09] in the ten versions 1960 the prophet of
[1:45:12] God says this year in
[1:45:17] part of me I just to save time I'll take
[1:45:19] the greatest battle ever followed
[1:45:23] the prophet says speaking of Russia
[1:45:25] paragraph 55 in Russia I want to say
[1:45:30] this for the benefit of the veterans and
[1:45:33] so forth here and you Bible students

[1:46:28] it's in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:46:30] amen did you all get that
[1:46:33] yeah who's looking for it to come up

[1:46:56] they're a great help to me this in the
[1:46:59] greatest battle ever fought
[1:47:02] says I want to say this for the benefit
[1:47:04] of the veterans
[1:47:06] and so forth
[1:47:07] and you Bible students what are you
[1:47:11] fussing and hollering about Russia
[1:47:13] you don't hear me telling you to build a
[1:47:15] bomb shelter
[1:47:17] do you what you fussing about Russia
[1:47:19] Russia ain't nothing
[1:47:21] she ain't gonna win no Wars she ain't
[1:47:25] going to conquer no world
[1:47:27] communism isn't going to conquer no
[1:47:30] world what's the matter with people can
[1:47:32] God's word fail listen it's on the tape
[1:47:36] now to the world I speak wherever these
[1:47:39] tapes may go and to you people here no

[1:47:43] believe this Russia communism isn't
[1:47:48] conquering nothing God's word Can't Fail
[1:47:51] romanism is going to conquer the world
[1:47:54] so what's romanism romanism is a spirit
[1:47:59] of denominationalism
[1:48:03] it's Catholicism
[1:48:06] birthing daughters you can't get a
[1:48:09] witness
[1:48:10] and those daughters are churches right
[1:48:14] we're not talking about homie on the
[1:48:16] street out here doing all the problems
[1:48:17] we're talking about the churches on the
[1:48:19] corner causing all the problems and the
[1:48:23] romanism spirit will come together with
[1:48:28] this great Dragon to persecute the true
[1:48:31] bride to come after her and we know that
[1:48:34] we realize that
[1:48:36] and so brother banham gives us these
[1:48:39] things because he tells us you know what
[1:48:41] to look for
[1:48:42] you know where to stand
[1:48:45] and the message Look Away to Jesus he
[1:48:47] tells us you won't see it in
[1:48:50] manifestation greatly now hope you're
[1:48:52] with me this morning
[1:48:53] you won't see it in Great manifestation
[1:48:55] now but wait until the squeeze comes
[1:49:00] and he says now watch what I'm going to
[1:49:02] tell you now he says watch the third
[1:49:05] pool then so he's given us a time to
[1:49:08] look for and what to look for when you
[1:49:10] see this great Council begin to squeeze
[1:49:14] and put pressure that you can't pray for
[1:49:16] the sick
[1:49:18] you can't Gather in his name
[1:49:21] you can't you got compromise on your
[1:49:24] Evangelical what's Evangelical teaching
[1:49:26] the baptism of the Holy Ghost these
[1:49:29] signs shall follow them that believe the
[1:49:31] gifts of the church God still fills with
[1:49:33] the Holy the Evangelical teachings they
[1:49:36] want us to compromise on that but that's
[1:49:39] God's word that's the way his son is
[1:49:43] Born Into the family he's got to come
[1:49:45] this way
[1:49:47] but that's the pressure
[1:49:49] it starts you know with people giving
[1:49:52] you pressure and then it physically
[1:49:55] comes down to where they want to stop
[1:49:57] you from preaching so brother random
[1:49:58] tells us all these things all right
[1:50:02] can I preach on faith just for a minute
[1:50:05] faith
[1:50:07] Jesus said
[1:50:09] if you have faith
[1:50:12] the size of a mustard seed
[1:50:16] you can say to this mountain
[1:50:20] be thou removed
[1:50:22] and be cast into the sea
[1:50:25] and then you can have what you've asked
[1:50:27] for huh
[1:50:30] this faith is this is this the faith
[1:50:34] that you know when Jesus came to this
[1:50:36] fig tree
[1:50:37] it wasn't the time of figs but he he
[1:50:40] cursed it for a season
[1:50:43] and he
[1:50:47] as as the prophet brings it out to us in
[1:50:49] the message my new ministry the Lord was
[1:50:53] teaching him
[1:50:55] how to operate this great gift
[1:50:59] or this promise
[1:51:01] under the atonement or outside of the
[1:51:05] the atonement of you say to this
[1:51:08] mountain and you can have what you say
[1:51:11] that's a strong promise for the Lord to
[1:51:15] give someone
[1:51:16] you know and what brother Branham he
[1:51:19] brings it in not to just the ministry
[1:51:22] let me take a a quote here in my new
[1:51:26] ministry here with the prophet of God
[1:51:27] says here in paragraph number 91 he says
[1:51:37] he says something like this paragraph 92
[1:51:40] something said to me who do you think
[1:51:43] how do you see those Visions on the
[1:51:45] platform
[1:51:46] how do you see those Visions out here
[1:51:48] what is it do you think it's your own
[1:51:50] wisdom that you could predict something
[1:51:52] that would happen every time to the
[1:51:54] letter
[1:51:55] do you think it's you speaking
[1:51:58] would you think sometime when the Holy
[1:52:00] Spirit gets into the message and you
[1:52:02] don't know what to say what is it
[1:52:05] speaking then
[1:52:07] what is it when a man will speak with
[1:52:10] tongue that he don't know nothing about
[1:52:12] what is it that will interpret the same
[1:52:15] tongue
[1:52:16] neither one of them knowing anything
[1:52:18] about it is it the individual or is it
[1:52:22] the spirit of the Living God
[1:52:24] I said that that is true I see it it's
[1:52:28] God that's speaking
[1:52:30] and all the church needs is a step
[1:52:34] closer to him a more of a consecrated
[1:52:38] life to live with him go up to paragraph
[1:52:42] number 91 just quickly you see
[1:52:48] and I I got out after I was speaking
[1:52:50] there for a while inside myself just
[1:52:52] thinking until I become so unconscious
[1:52:54] of something near I was talking to
[1:52:56] someone and something said to me that's
[1:52:58] in the atonement
[1:53:00] for if a man or a woman is so
[1:53:05] consecrated and surrendered to God that
[1:53:10] God just moves in and uses their voice
[1:53:15] and it isn't the man speaking it's God
[1:53:18] that's him speaking so here brother
[1:53:21] Branham is teaching us
[1:53:24] he's teaching us this great law of the
[1:53:27] third pool and how it kind of works we
[1:53:30] have the properties of it
[1:53:32] huh
[1:53:34] we see it on display
[1:53:36] you know God's a god of order
[1:53:39] and the solar system there's laws
[1:53:42] and there's things that hold things
[1:53:44] together and those laws are already
[1:53:47] there they've always been there but
[1:53:49] great intellectual Minds will tap into
[1:53:52] that and come up with a formula and
[1:53:56] bring it to others so you can teach
[1:53:58] people math or trigonometry or how speed
[1:54:02] and how light works those are all laws
[1:54:05] now those same educated Minds today have
[1:54:08] turned and trying to make God prove
[1:54:11] himself when they're using his laws to
[1:54:13] prove what they talking about
[1:54:16] he quote something to you I heard from
[1:54:19] this Oxford Professor he John Lennox is
[1:54:22] his name he's a believing Christian but
[1:54:24] a professor he's a scientist that's what
[1:54:25] he says he he was speaking to a group of
[1:54:28] Oxford men on the truth in the existence
[1:54:32] of God it was really good and just a one
[1:54:34] paragraph he says
[1:54:36] at the rise of Science in the 16th and
[1:54:40] 17th century Alfred Morris Whitehead and
[1:54:44] many others commented that men became
[1:54:49] scientific because they expected the
[1:54:53] laws in nature
[1:54:55] and they expected law in nature because
[1:54:57] they believed in a law Giver
[1:55:00] ladies and gentlemen I'm not ashamed of
[1:55:03] being both a scientist and a Christian
[1:55:07] because arguably
[1:55:09] Christianity gave me my subject
[1:55:13] I'm amazed that it is serious thinkers
[1:55:16] today continue to ask us to choose
[1:55:19] between the god of science God or
[1:55:23] science that's like asking people to
[1:55:26] choose between Henry Ford and
[1:55:29] Engineering as an explanation of the
[1:55:31] Motorcar and I thought that was
[1:55:33] beautiful
[1:55:34] you trying to ask people to choose
[1:55:36] between Henry Ford
[1:55:38] or this great this great explanation of
[1:55:43] Science and there is no explanation that
[1:55:46] you have him before because of these
[1:55:49] great truths
[1:55:51] and science is there because of God any
[1:55:55] true any man that really studies the
[1:55:58] solar system he's got to say like Albert
[1:56:00] Einstein there is a God any man that
[1:56:04] really is honest you got to say somebody
[1:56:06] created this this is too orderly this is
[1:56:09] too purposefully this is too designed
[1:56:12] too well put together
[1:56:15] had to be a god and when you look in the
[1:56:19] mirror you gotta say the same thing
[1:56:21] there's got to be a god somewhere and
[1:56:24] he's the one who brought us here and he
[1:56:27] has laws and he has instructions
[1:56:30] that we need to know
[1:56:33] and how many how many of you preachers
[1:56:35] here how many preachers here today let
[1:56:36] me see you raise up your hand one only
[1:56:39] one preacher here thank you brother
[1:56:40] one preacher willing to raise up their
[1:56:43] hand let me give you one more chance how
[1:56:45] many preachers here let me see you slip
[1:56:47] up your hand
[1:56:48] two one two and the one I had didn't
[1:56:52] raise his hand
[1:56:53] I mean one two three four preachers
[1:56:57] y'all so scared
[1:57:03] out here today I'm not going to bother
[1:57:04] you let me see your hand
[1:57:08] thank you
[1:57:11] any preacher knows if you're a preacher
[1:57:13] today
[1:57:16] if the preachers can't help you brother
[1:57:17] Joe where you at I mean
[1:57:20] any preacher knows today you ask them
[1:57:23] well how do you know God called you to
[1:57:25] preach oh that's a powerful question
[1:57:29] where did you know he called you
[1:57:32] that's a life-changing question that's a
[1:57:35] that's a mystery that has to be revealed
[1:57:38] to that man
[1:57:39] and young people they'll come and say
[1:57:41] brother Israel how do you know you're
[1:57:43] called
[1:57:44] it's like there's something I had to
[1:57:46] work it out
[1:57:47] God had to reveal that something you
[1:57:50] have to open up
[1:57:52] that isn't you know you wake up and you
[1:57:54] get instructions on how to preach
[1:57:57] instructions to go and operate in the
[1:58:00] call of God it doesn't work that way
[1:58:03] it's a life
[1:58:04] it's a Ministry and then God reveals
[1:58:07] himself one step at a time can I get a
[1:58:10] witness preachers
[1:58:12] it's not an easy task
[1:58:14] and
[1:58:16] and when God is calling here the prophet
[1:58:19] he's calling the prophet into this great
[1:58:21] ministry of the the his new ministry
[1:58:24] questioning it didn't know exactly how
[1:58:27] it operate or how it worked he it took
[1:58:30] me since it was 15 years that the Lord
[1:58:34] had gave him this promise but he
[1:58:36] couldn't see this scripture in
[1:58:38] manifestation yet
[1:58:40] until
[1:58:41] my new ministry in 1959
[1:58:46] he's out there trying to
[1:58:49] hunting for squirrels
[1:58:52] he's on a squirrel hunt
[1:58:55] not in church not all spiritual not in
[1:58:57] the suit and tie he's out squirrel
[1:58:58] hunting
[1:59:00] brother Banner makes a statement he says
[1:59:04] God came to him
[1:59:06] to confirm to him in his own way how he
[1:59:10] could speak to him
[1:59:12] and so God used squirrels and hunt him
[1:59:15] to speak to the prophet because that was
[1:59:18] his nature
[1:59:19] and let me say this to you Saints here
[1:59:22] any of you here God will find you
[1:59:26] when he's ready for you to do anything
[1:59:31] he'll find you and he'll roll upon you
[1:59:33] when you ain't expecting it
[1:59:35] and you think it's gonna happen like
[1:59:37] this it'll happen like that he'll find
[1:59:39] you if he's got something for you to do
[1:59:42] um
[1:59:43] and the devil will find you too
[1:59:47] so brother Branham is out hunting
[1:59:50] he said he gets up into there he's not
[1:59:52] getting any squirrels nothing was by
[1:59:54] nothing was out there he didn't make any
[1:59:56] shots so he finds a warm spot in the
[1:59:59] tree
[2:00:00] and he just as he gets comfortable
[2:00:03] and the nice the warm is in Colorado
[2:00:05] nice warm sun setting up on them
[2:00:11] wherever he was hunting I think it was
[2:00:12] Kentucky but he was a nice warm sun and
[2:00:15] it's setting up on him he's just thought
[2:00:17] he said I'll take about a nap I got
[2:00:18] about an hour before I picked the
[2:00:20] brothers up so I'll take a nap here
[2:00:23] so he sits down to take a nap and finds
[2:00:25] a comfortable spot and then this
[2:00:27] scripture comes to him Mark chapter 11.
[2:00:31] so God finds him in the woods where he's
[2:00:35] at to confirm a promise to him
[2:00:39] I want you to have that confidence this
[2:00:41] morning that whatever God's got for you
[2:00:44] he will find you
[2:00:47] you don't have to take nobody's spot
[2:00:50] you don't have to hate on nobodies for
[2:00:52] others to recognize you
[2:00:54] you don't have to put your name on any
[2:00:56] list nowhere God will find you
[2:01:01] all you gotta do is be what God called
[2:01:05] you to be and be grateful and be
[2:01:09] thankful and here's another one be
[2:01:11] faithful
[2:01:13] be faithful to what he's given you
[2:01:22] got a little Ministry there it's online
[2:01:25] I only got two followers
[2:01:28] be faithful to those two followers
[2:01:31] those of you that do that or have that
[2:01:37] well if I get a hundred followers then
[2:01:39] I'll be faithful no be faithful to the
[2:01:40] two
[2:01:42] be faithful to your family
[2:01:45] huh
[2:01:47] that's a that's a that's a congregation
[2:01:49] right there
[2:01:51] they're not supporting you you're
[2:01:53] supporting them but that's a
[2:01:54] congregation that can hear you every
[2:01:56] night
[2:01:58] amen so I need brother Israel's I need
[2:02:00] brother so and so I need reference
[2:02:02] so-and-so so they can get me to preach
[2:02:04] you got a home preach right at home
[2:02:08] five o'clock we have in church
[2:02:11] around the beans and cornbread
[2:02:14] right at this dinner table
[2:02:17] is that a Ministry or no
[2:02:20] huh
[2:02:21] don't despise the day of small things
[2:02:24] and there he is
[2:02:26] in the woods and the The Voice brings a
[2:02:30] scripture to him
[2:02:31] and this is Matthew this is Mark chapter
[2:02:34] 11.
[2:02:36] and as it begins to bring the scripture
[2:02:38] to him
[2:02:39] he was
[2:02:41] challenged about the this being under
[2:02:44] the New Covenant and then then that
[2:02:46] scripture that quote I just read for you
[2:02:48] he brings in that any man or woman that
[2:02:52] will consecrate themselves
[2:02:56] I'ma close right here
[2:02:59] they would consecrate themselves
[2:03:03] to God
[2:03:05] then the god of heaven will move in on
[2:03:08] that individual he said man or woman now
[2:03:11] that's the quote we read it right we're
[2:03:14] not talking about preachers
[2:03:16] we're talking about believer
[2:03:19] who was Jesus speaking to Mark 11. he's
[2:03:22] talking to believers
[2:03:24] [Music]
[2:03:26] whosoever
[2:03:28] says to the mountain be thou removed
[2:03:33] who's he talking to to believers
[2:03:37] amen
[2:03:38] amen
[2:03:40] and they would consecrate themselves
[2:03:42] then God will speak through them
[2:03:48] uh
[2:03:50] beautiful
[2:03:53] I like what he says in paragraph
[2:03:55] number 120 he says this here
[2:04:02] and well I stood there for about a few
[2:04:04] minutes
[2:04:05] I could hear no shooting around
[2:04:08] the rest of the boys around anywhere
[2:04:11] I happen to look to my back way up in
[2:04:13] the woods about 90 yards I thought
[2:04:16] something was on the stump and I watched
[2:04:18] it and after a while I jumped off and it
[2:04:21] was a gray squirrel
[2:04:22] so far all the way across the hollow up
[2:04:25] on the top of the ridge when they come
[2:04:27] along about the side of the tree I shot
[2:04:29] it
[2:04:30] it was about 90 yards and I killed it I
[2:04:34] said there's one I might as well turn
[2:04:36] and look this other way for the others
[2:04:38] because they're coming so he had spoken
[2:04:41] that they would be there he says he got
[2:04:43] one he looked for the others because
[2:04:45] they're coming see God has a way of
[2:04:50] bringing things to you that's the point
[2:04:53] I want to make to you this morning
[2:04:55] making you sure
[2:05:00] of what you're
[2:05:06] come on somebody
[2:05:08] is that is that deep enough
[2:05:11] that's too shallow
[2:05:13] God has a way
[2:05:15] of confirming his word to you
[2:05:19] the individual
[2:05:21] it don't work until you believe it
[2:05:24] it's not important until you can see it
[2:05:28] everybody else can shout but if you
[2:05:29] can't see it it's just everybody else
[2:05:31] shouting right
[2:05:33] right but God has a way of bringing
[2:05:36] things huh to you
[2:05:40] and he makes it personal to you
[2:05:44] there's a quick testimony real quick
[2:05:46] just a little of my own testimony here
[2:05:48] you know when when I come into into the
[2:05:51] ministry coming to the you know into the
[2:05:53] Arizona area there here
[2:05:56] and there's a great men of God that I
[2:05:58] loved I heard about him and I wanted to
[2:06:00] meet them
[2:06:01] and I remember I was
[2:06:03] I was at love divine fellowship at the
[2:06:06] time brother Baker is our pastor in just
[2:06:09] a few years here and I was out eating
[2:06:11] somewhere and I saw this great Minister
[2:06:13] from another city in town
[2:06:16] and he's a he's a legend and he didn't
[2:06:19] know me of course I knew him I knew of
[2:06:21] him great ministry I'm just a young pup
[2:06:23] as I say
[2:06:25] young pup looking up at the big dogs
[2:06:28] and I see this brother in the in the
[2:06:30] restaurants where I run over to him hey
[2:06:32] brother God bless you my name is so and
[2:06:35] so Ma I would love for you to come
[2:06:37] I'll talk to our the pastor I'd love for
[2:06:40] you to come and fellowship at our church
[2:06:42] and he looked at me and he said just
[2:06:43] like this he says well brother so and so
[2:06:46] is my friend and I'm here for that
[2:06:49] very cold shoulder
[2:06:53] very it was uh
[2:06:55] it's like if you didn't know now you
[2:06:58] know we don't operate that way
[2:07:01] you know that's all fun and games
[2:07:03] everybody getting along and you come in
[2:07:06] and you're inviting me but this brother
[2:07:08] over here is my friend
[2:07:10] and that brother where you at I don't
[2:07:12] really know him so I'm not going over
[2:07:14] there and you know it just shook my
[2:07:15] little mind
[2:07:16] I'm just a young pup I don't know who's
[2:07:18] Fred is whose friend I heard you preach
[2:07:21] I like your preaching can you come and
[2:07:24] bless us but no this is my friend and
[2:07:27] now it ain't my friend
[2:07:29] well you know what he didn't even know
[2:07:31] he didn't even know brother Baker at the
[2:07:33] time I don't I don't believe he even
[2:07:34] knew him
[2:07:37] man so I went back to my table at
[2:07:39] Cracker Barrel
[2:07:42] and the little pup was deflated
[2:07:45] a little discouraged
[2:07:47] I was like even to this day when I see
[2:07:49] that brother I got a little like
[2:07:51] kind of a little you know
[2:07:54] I love them I like them I really do a
[2:07:57] good great Minister big name big
[2:08:00] Ministry I he's an example I still look
[2:08:02] to him but I will never forget how he
[2:08:04] treated me that way
[2:08:05] but he doesn't even know that he did
[2:08:07] that but what he did was what it does is
[2:08:09] it makes you find
[2:08:13] an example
[2:08:15] that won't let you down
[2:08:18] and that's in this message right here
[2:08:21] huh it makes you find a position that's
[2:08:26] stable
[2:08:28] find a position in the word and stick in
[2:08:32] that position and God will come to you
[2:08:36] you don't have to go run under and
[2:08:38] follow a Ministry over there you don't
[2:08:40] have to go run and make friends with
[2:08:42] this one over here God will bring your
[2:08:44] friends to you God will bring the
[2:08:47] anointing to you God will let you find
[2:08:50] your place
[2:08:52] and then years later
[2:08:56] I I always look to other brothers I
[2:08:58] would bounce things off of them
[2:09:00] brother George knows what I'm talking
[2:09:01] about he call her you see something in
[2:09:03] the word you'll call this brother hey
[2:09:05] what do you think about that I heard
[2:09:06] what do you think about had a handful of
[2:09:08] Brothers like that that I bounce things
[2:09:10] off of
[2:09:12] or wouldn't say it but what I was doing
[2:09:14] brother Joe is I was asking permission
[2:09:17] to say Amen to what I saw
[2:09:21] that's how the Lord revealed it to me
[2:09:24] Israel you're asking these other
[2:09:25] brothers permission before you say Amen
[2:09:27] to what you read there it's that's a
[2:09:30] powerful quote that I just showed you a
[2:09:33] powerful quote you heard that tape how
[2:09:34] many times look at that quote right
[2:09:36] there and you go you kidding me say Amen
[2:09:39] yet you gotta go call Reverend so and so
[2:09:43] to get okay
[2:09:45] if he sees it that way then we can both
[2:09:47] say Amen together yeah
[2:09:50] you can't handle the word that way how
[2:09:53] about somebody
[2:09:55] you got to pick up your Bible it's got
[2:09:57] to be your Bible
[2:09:59] and when you open that thing you know
[2:10:01] there's a potential of an explosion to
[2:10:03] happen when you open that thing he might
[2:10:06] show you something that will blow things
[2:10:09] up in your life in everybody else's life
[2:10:12] but Lord show me your word that's all I
[2:10:16] want show me your word for my life
[2:10:23] does he have the freedom to show you
[2:10:26] more of his word
[2:10:31] mm-hmm
[2:10:33] and these precepts
[2:10:35] are being taught to us if we can catch
[2:10:38] the teaching from the way the prophet
[2:10:41] handles this new ministry of his
[2:10:45] it was his new ministry to teach us how
[2:10:48] to handle whatever God has for us that's
[2:10:51] new
[2:10:52] huh
[2:10:54] can you receive that huh the humility
[2:10:57] that he took
[2:10:59] the patience that it took for him to to
[2:11:02] keep listening to what God was trying to
[2:11:04] show him and to reveal to him
[2:11:08] and
[2:11:10] and like science has gotten to these
[2:11:13] laws and these algorithms and they can
[2:11:16] tell you how fast light travels and how
[2:11:19] fast you know
[2:11:21] how long it'll take you to stop when
[2:11:24] you're breaking and rain and how fast 55
[2:11:27] miles an hour it'll go in the velocity
[2:11:30] all of those were laws that they got
[2:11:32] into that they took from God
[2:11:35] they understood it and brought it in and
[2:11:37] we have those laws this is God's word
[2:11:40] for us
[2:11:42] and the prophet has opened up this word
[2:11:46] so that we can make
[2:11:49] Mark 11 work in our life
[2:11:53] can you say Amen to that
[2:11:55] what is James chapter 5 tells us James
[2:11:58] chapter 5 verse 10 says this I'm closing
[2:12:03] right here
[2:12:05] foreign
[2:12:12] James chapter 5 verse 10 says
[2:12:15] to take the prophets
[2:12:18] as an example
[2:12:22] um
[2:12:23] take my brethren the prophets who have
[2:12:26] spoken in the name of the Lord for and
[2:12:31] what
[2:12:32] example
[2:12:34] of suffering of Affliction and of
[2:12:37] patience
[2:12:40] look at the patience the prophet had
[2:12:43] as God unfolded these things to him
[2:12:50] let's take this last one in paragraph
[2:12:51] 258
[2:12:54] in my new ministry he says this here
[2:12:58] now every one of you not only ministers
[2:13:00] but all of you
[2:13:02] ought to pray for these people you don't
[2:13:05] know what God might do while you're in
[2:13:07] prayer for somebody else what if you'd
[2:13:09] say the right thing here's a woman
[2:13:11] standing here
[2:13:12] that's so sick they have to hold her up
[2:13:15] what if your prayer would be the right
[2:13:18] thing just like Banks said the right
[2:13:21] thing like Hattie said the right thing
[2:13:26] what if you would say the right thing
[2:13:28] your prayer to cause God to come down
[2:13:32] and do something
[2:13:34] see this is just not one person
[2:13:38] this is the Church of the Living God
[2:13:42] who everybody
[2:13:45] now everybody be in prayer so so let's
[2:13:49] take the title of that message What's
[2:13:51] the title of the message
[2:13:53] my new ministry
[2:13:56] can we say it like this everybody's new
[2:13:58] ministry
[2:14:00] huh
[2:14:02] because his new ministry will affect
[2:14:05] your new ministry

[2:14:11] a prophet
[2:14:12] examples of spoken word in creation how
[2:14:15] God can get a man use a man with the
[2:14:19] scripture that Jesus brought and at the
[2:14:21] end
[2:14:23] he brings it to all of us I love that
[2:14:27] that's when it's interesting right
[2:14:29] the picture ain't proper until I can see
[2:14:32] myself in the picture where everybody at
[2:14:34] where am I at
[2:14:36] you got the family album out you're
[2:14:38] taking those pictures
[2:14:40] it don't get important to you start
[2:14:41] seeing yourself

[2:14:45] you take out the family picture you'll
[2:14:47] be looking for yourself don't you
[2:14:50] or is that just me
[2:14:52] this is the family album right here
[2:14:55] you should be looking for yourself in
[2:14:57] there
[2:14:58] you listen to the message here the
[2:15:00] proper preaching on the third pool you
[2:15:02] got to see yourself in there some kind
[2:15:05] of way there's an effect for you as the
[2:15:08] seals open up and revealed these unclean
[2:15:10] spirits that were already there the
[2:15:12] seals open up it reveals the True
[2:15:15] Believer
[2:15:17] that is already there it's already in
[2:15:20] you you just gotta consecrate your life
[2:15:23] get into the word be patient be faithful
[2:15:27] be unmovable and let God bless you and
[2:15:32] keep you don't you love him

[2:15:38] morning God bless you

[2:15:41] Heavenly Father we ask your blessings
[2:15:45] upon each one gathered here today
[2:15:47] I know Lord there's a lot of statements
[2:15:49] made that some of the visitors maybe
[2:15:52] wouldn't understand Are Young
[2:15:55] young believer young Christian coming up
[2:15:57] but Lord there's a portion that everyone
[2:16:00] can receive
[2:16:01] a something from you
[2:16:04] and it's thinking of brother bank's
[2:16:06] prayer

[2:16:16] that used to give us bread let's go tell
[2:16:18] her we got saved
[2:16:20] and he just said that unconsciously he
[2:16:23] said it just like that he wasn't saying
[2:16:25] it to be you know to make something he
[2:16:27] was just being a believer
[2:16:30] and you came on the scene
[2:16:33] and you brought a great and tremendous
[2:16:37] it's greater than the law of gravity
[2:16:40] greater than that
[2:16:42] greater than any of these laws or these
[2:16:44] great
[2:16:45] great scientists of our of our of our
[2:16:49] day they've invented things to help us
[2:16:51] live better but your word is greater
[2:16:54] than any of that that they that they can
[2:16:57] invent
[2:16:58] but it's actually they're just
[2:17:00] discovering what you already had here
[2:17:04] but your word opening up into the soul
[2:17:07] of a man or woman
[2:17:09] and reading the scripture in mark 11.
[2:17:12] Lord set it off one more time

[2:19:50] just a little report from the service
[2:19:52] the youth service last night was a
[2:19:55] tremendous success in my opinion it's
[2:19:58] very great very nice
[2:20:01] brothers gave their testimonies it was a
[2:20:03] completely full house there at the
[2:20:05] Tucson Tabernacle the real burden came
[2:20:08] from Isaac Jr
[2:20:10] he was talking to his dad and and they
[2:20:13] were talking to me about doing something
[2:20:16] for the Youth and getting other churches
[2:20:18] involved and they wanted to get the
[2:20:20] Tucson Tabernacle involved months and
[2:20:22] months ago
[2:20:23] and so I was talking with them and I
[2:20:26] kind of
[2:20:27] I move a little slow on certain things
[2:20:30] it's not a credit sometimes it's helpful
[2:20:33] sometimes it's hurtful but I gotta move
[2:20:36] when I feel it and
[2:20:38] I just
[2:20:40] you know as we thought about it the
[2:20:42] motive was right the objective I believe
[2:20:44] was right and we talked and had a
[2:20:47] meeting with brother Dan
[2:20:48] Evans and
[2:20:50] brother Dan and the Tucson Tabernacle
[2:20:53] really took and put the whole their
[2:20:56] whole heart into planting it together
[2:20:58] they did a very good job I thought how
[2:21:01] many of you were there last night let me
[2:21:04] see those things it was a nice crowd
[2:21:06] nice service nice out when you say I
[2:21:08] thought it was nice Brothers
[2:21:11] brother uh Isaac Jr he's our good friend
[2:21:14] brother his dad their Ministry they're
[2:21:17] just one of my best friends there I see
[2:21:20] them every week I talk to them when
[2:21:22] Isaac got cancer it was like one of our
[2:21:25] family members got it remember that
[2:21:28] but he gave his testimony
[2:21:30] and he didn't know exactly why he but
[2:21:33] and I heard his testimony many times but
[2:21:35] he he gave a portion of his testimony as
[2:21:38] to why he said earlier this year
[2:21:41] he realized he needed the Holy Ghost
[2:21:45] and that it's time to stop playing
[2:21:48] Church
[2:21:49] he said it had a multi-purpose was it
[2:21:53] for his family was it for him was it for
[2:21:54] his church he kept asking why would he
[2:21:57] be diagnosed with a cancer Mass on his
[2:22:00] heart 18 or 19 years old served the Lord
[2:22:04] was helpful in his church never miss
[2:22:07] church out of all the people to get hit
[2:22:09] with something why would he get hit with
[2:22:11] it I asked the same question and he gave
[2:22:14] his testimony he did a wonderful job and
[2:22:17] I really really enjoyed him because I
[2:22:20] know them and and he's like one of us as
[2:22:23] he was giving out testimony just it
[2:22:26] brought tears to my eyes to think how
[2:22:29] God brought him through that
[2:22:32] and we could have buried him
[2:22:34] but yesterday we got to hear him preach
[2:22:37] and the anointing came down it was a
[2:22:40] nice service I mean yeah it was
[2:22:42] beautiful very nice nice atmosphere
[2:22:44] another young man gave his testimony of
[2:22:46] of going in the world and the Lord
[2:22:48] calling him and just did a really really
[2:22:52] good job and so
[2:22:54] I say thumbs up on that youth meeting I
[2:22:57] think it was a success and young people
[2:22:59] that were involved in that and so we
[2:23:01] thank the Lord Brother Isaac didn't get
[2:23:04] to get up and really say anything I
[2:23:06] really liked for to hear him Isaac
[2:23:09] Osorio he's a little shy about his uh
[2:23:12] his English he's not shy about laughing
[2:23:15] out loud though but
[2:23:18] um he's shy about speaking English like
[2:23:21] that but I really wanted him to get some
[2:23:23] credit last night because him and they
[2:23:25] really that was he kept pushing kept
[2:23:27] pushing kept pushing and I was like I
[2:23:30] kept thinking to myself Isaac that's
[2:23:32] what you guys want to do go do it but he
[2:23:34] wanted me involved into it so I'm like
[2:23:36] okay we'll do it and also glad to be a
