[0:01] When I come into his
[0:05] presence, I humble myself. Could we
[0:09] stand together
[0:10] tonight? Both my
[0:13] hands and
[0:15] I
[0:16] begin to
[0:19] worship him.
[0:24] Yes, I
[0:26] worship him for all you've done,
[0:31] Lord. For all you have done for
[0:38] me, you've
[0:41] redeemed and set me
[0:46] free. And
[0:49] because, just because
[0:54] You are
[0:56] God. Sing that second verse with
[1:00] me. And when I come into his presence, I
[1:06] humble
[1:09] myself remembering what he's done. All
[1:13] the victories he has won. So I'll
[1:18] praise him.
[1:22] Oh yes, I will

[1:29] again. Yes, when I come into his
[1:34] presence, I humble
[1:38] myself, remembering what he's
[1:42] done, the victories he has won. So I'll
[1:48] praise him.
[1:50] Yes, I
[1:53] will. I'll
[1:57] praise
[1:59] him
[2:00] for
[2:02] all he has done for me.
[2:08] He's
[2:09] redeemed and
[2:11] set me free.
[2:16] And
[2:18] because just
[2:21] because he is God for all you've done,
[2:29] Lord,

[3:21] to what the Lord has in store for us.
[3:24] Amen. Have a couple of specials this
[3:26] evening, which is wonderful news for me.
[3:29] Without a voice, it's the more specials
[3:31] the better. So I see our our brother
[3:34] Jeff here. I'm not going to call on you
[3:36] to sing, but it' be awfully easy to say
[3:38] come up and lead. But welcome all those
[3:40] that are visiting from Charity tonight.
[3:43] God bless you. God glad you brought your
[3:44] lick of fire with you and we just we
[3:47] came to worship him this evening. Trust
[3:49] he gets all the honor and glory. It's
[3:50] our desire tonight.
[3:52] [Music]
[3:56] Amen. As Lord and Savior as we come
[3:59] before you tonight, Lord God, we're so
[4:01] grateful to know you, Lord, to be able
[4:03] to serve you. Thank you, Lord, for
[4:06] shining the light in our pathway.
[4:07] Father, open our eyes so we can see.
[4:11] Lord God, we're nothing in ourselves. We
[4:14] know that, Lord God. It's just your
[4:16] amazing grace. And we just want to
[4:18] praise you tonight, Lord. Asking that
[4:19] you'd pour out your Holy Spirit, Lord,
[4:22] upon this little body of believers,
[4:24] Father. Just let that spirit fall aresh,
[4:26] Lord
[4:28] God. Lord, we're needy people. Just ask
[4:31] for your blessings upon us in the
[4:33] service. Lord, may everything that's
[4:35] said and done be done for your honor and
[4:37] glory. Lord, may you be magnified as
[4:39] you're deserving. We ask it and give you
[4:41] thanks for all things in Jesus name.
[4:46] Amen. Maybe you just stay where you're
[4:50] at, but turn around and shake hands with
[4:51] a few people that are around you this
[4:53] evening. So good to see all the smiling
[4:55] faces
[4:56] tonight. Amen.

[8:10] praise into the
[8:13] house of the Lord.
[8:18] as we bring the sacrifice of
[8:22] praise into the
[8:25] house of the Lord.
[8:30] And we
[8:31] offer up to
[8:34] you the
[8:36] [Music]
[8:38] sacrificees of
[8:41] thanksgiving that we
[8:43] offer up to
[8:47] you the
[8:50] sacrifice. Let's just sing now together
[8:52] one more time. Oh yes, we bring the
[8:57] sacrifice of praise.
[9:00] into the
[9:02] house of the
[9:06] Lord. Yes, we bring the sacrifice of
[9:11] praise into the
[9:14] house of the Lord.
[9:18] willingly
[9:20] offer up to
[9:23] you the
[9:27] sacrificees of
[9:30] thanksgiving. We
[9:32] offer up to
[9:35] you the
[9:39] sacrificees of joy.
[9:47] We will
[9:49] remember. We will
[9:52] remember. We will remember the works of
[9:57] your
[9:59] hands. Oh, we will
[10:02] stop. We'll give you praise for great is
[10:07] thy faithfulness.
[10:09] [Music]
[10:12] You're our
[10:14] creator, our life
[10:18] sustainer,
[10:20] deliverer, our comfort, our
[10:24] joy. Throughout the
[10:27] ages, you've been our shelter and our
[10:31] peace in the midst of the storm.
[10:38] We will
[10:40] remember. We will
[10:43] remember. We will
[10:46] remember the works of your
[10:50] hand. We will
[10:53] stop. We'll give you praise for great is
[10:58] thy faithfulness. With signs and
[11:01] wonders, you've shown your power.
[11:04] With signs and
[11:06] wonders, you shown your
[11:09] power with precious blood. You showed us
[11:14] your
[11:16] grace. You've been our
[11:19] helper, our liberator. You're the giver
[11:24] of life with no
[11:29] end. We will remember.
[11:33] We will
[11:35] remember. We will remember the works of
[11:40] your hands. We will stop. We will
[11:45] stop. We'll give you praise for great is
[11:50] thy faithfulness.
[11:56] When we walk
[11:58] through life's darkest
[12:01] valleys, we will look back at all you
[12:06] have
[12:08] done. And we will
[12:11] shout, "Our God is good. Oh, and he is
[12:17] the faithful one."
[12:22] We will
[12:25] remember. We will
[12:28] remember. We will remember the works of
[12:33] your
[12:35] hands. And we will
[12:38] stop. We'll give you praise for great is
[12:43] thy faith. I wonder if we could just
[12:46] sing that third verse together one more
[12:48] time. But when we get to that part that
[12:49] says, we will shout, "Our God is good."
[12:52] That doesn't need to be a future time.
[12:54] There's no reason we can't shout tonight
[12:56] and say, "Our God is good and he is the
[12:59] faithful
[13:04] one." When we walk
[13:07] through life's darkest
[13:11] valley, we will look back at all you
[13:16] have done. Let's shout together. We will
[13:20] shout
[13:22] Our God is good and he is the faithful
[13:29] one.
[13:31] Oh, we will remember. Yes, we will
[13:37] remember. We will remember the works of
[13:42] your hand.
[13:45] And we will will stop and we'll give you
[13:50] praise for great is our
[13:53] faith. And I still
[13:57] remember I still
[14:00] remember the day you saved
[14:04] me. The day I heard you call out my
[14:09] name.
[14:11] You said you love
[14:14] me. You'd never leave me. Oh, and I've
[14:18] never been the
[14:24] same. We will remember. Oh, we will
[14:30] remember. We will
[14:33] remember the works of your hand.
[14:38] Oh, we will
[14:40] stop. We'll give you praise for
[14:45] grace. Sing it one more time and say, "I
[14:48] will
[14:50] remember." I will
[14:54] remember. I will
[14:57] remember. I will remember the works of
[15:02] your hands. I will stop.
[15:05] I will
[15:07] stop. I'll give you praise for great is
[15:12] thy
[15:16] [Music]
[15:27] faithfulness. Amen. Brother Trevor, if
[15:30] you would, Sister Abby could come and
[15:31] sing for us. We'll sing a chorus as
[15:33] you're coming forward.
[15:34] The joy of the
[15:37] Lord is my strength. The joy of the
[15:43] Lord is my strength. The joy of the
[15:49] Lord is my strength. The joy of the Lord
[15:55] is my
[15:57] strength. Oh, the joy of the
[16:00] Lord is my strength.
[16:04] The joy of the
[16:06] Lord is my strength. The joy of the
[16:13] Lord is my strength. The joy. And maybe
[16:18] we can sing one more verse. He gives me
[16:20] living water. Oh, he gives me living
[16:24] water and I thirst.
[16:28] He gives me living water and I thirst no
[16:33] more. He gives me living water and I
[16:37] thirst no more. The joy of the Lord is
[16:43] my
[16:46] strength. Amen. That's my testimony. God
[16:49] bless you all. I'd like to give just a
[16:52] real short testimony. I'll keep it
[16:54] short.
[16:55] Um me and
[16:57] Abby have kind of been dealt our first
[17:01] really tough trial of our marriage and I
[17:04] believe we've passed it and I want to
[17:06] just share some of the little details
[17:08] about that. So about a month and a half
[17:11] ago, almost two months ago at my job, I
[17:15] was um wrongly alleged of, you know, I
[17:20] work with children with autism, so I'm a
[17:23] therapist with them and they're my
[17:25] patients. Someone had said that I was
[17:28] like cursing at the child and I was like
[17:32] making fun of them and putting them in a
[17:34] like restricted position and stuff like
[17:36] that. And I had a bunch of people side
[17:38] with me saying like, "Trevor is not the
[17:40] type. This isn't true." But management
[17:42] just on hearsay with no evidence other
[17:44] than their word took their side and I've
[17:48] was basically forced into a position of
[17:50] finding a new job. But that being said,
[17:54] um the Lord did provide uh me a new job
[17:58] which is amazing. And I just want to say
[18:02] um maybe give a rose to my wife, but she
[18:06] has shown absolute unwavering faith
[18:09] through the entirety of it. There is not
[18:11] one time where she was like scared or
[18:13] nervous or like, "Oh, Trevor, I don't
[18:15] know what we're going to do." She was
[18:16] completely confident the whole time. And
[18:18] I can't say the same for myself. But I'm
[18:21] just so happy she really kind of kept me
[18:23] grounded through that. Um, and uh,
[18:27] during this time I uh, just really
[18:31] leaning on just the word and looking for
[18:35] any nuggets in the Bible I could find
[18:37] that would be encouraging to me some,
[18:40] you know, find myself in a story or
[18:41] something. And I found a specific
[18:44] scripture that like I wouldn't really
[18:46] put it with my
[18:48] situation, but being in the fire of it,
[18:52] you kind of make the connection with it.
[18:54] And so I'll read it to you. It's um I
[18:57] have it. It's in John 6. Jesus is
[19:01] telling his disciples to eat of his
[19:04] flesh and drink of his blood, which is
[19:06] kind of a test to them. And they're
[19:07] like, "What? Like we got to we got to do
[19:10] this." But their confidence behind it
[19:12] there and some left him. Some some of
[19:15] them abandoned Christ. But in verse 67
[19:18] it says, "Then Jesus said unto the twel,
[19:21] will you also go away?" And Simon Peter
[19:23] answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go?
[19:26] Thou hast the words of eternal life, and
[19:28] we believe and are sure that thou art
[19:31] that Christ, the son of the living God.
[19:34] And in so in my situation I you know
[19:38] telling Abby I'm like who can we go to?
[19:42] We can only go to
[19:43] him. And the Lord helped me and Abby in
[19:48] writing this song. So we wrote this song
[19:50] together through inspiration of the Lord
[19:52] and just would like to share that with
[19:54] you this evening. So we hope it's a
[19:56] [Music]
[19:59] blessing. Oh Lord.
[20:02] Oh Lord, to whom shall we
[20:07] go? But
[20:09] [Music]
[20:10] you, oh
[20:13] Lord, oh Lord, to whom shall we
[20:17] [Music]
[20:21] go? Oh
[20:24] Lord, oh Lord, to whom shall we go?
[20:31] But
[20:33] you, oh
[20:35] Lord, oh Lord, to whom shall we
[20:40] [Music]
[20:44] go?
[20:47] Thou
[20:49] hast the words of
[20:54] eternal life. And
[20:58] we
[21:00] believe that thou art that living
[21:07] Christ, the
[21:11] son of the
[21:14] living God.
[21:19] To whom shall we
[21:21] go but
[21:25] [Music]
[21:27] you, oh
[21:30] Lord, oh Lord, to whom shall we go?
[21:36] But
[21:38] you, oh
[21:41] Lord, oh Lord, to whom shall we
[21:49] go?
[21:52] Thou
[21:54] hast the words of eternal life. And
[22:02] we
[22:05] believe that thou art that living
[22:12] Christ, the
[22:15] son of the
[22:19] living
[22:22] God. To whom shall we
[22:26] go but
[22:28] you? One more time. Won't you sing with
[22:31] me? Oh
[22:34] Lord, oh Lord, to whom shall we
[22:38] [Music]
[22:40] go? But
[22:42] you, oh
[22:45] Lord, oh Lord, to whom shall we? Let's
[22:49] sing that part one more time.
[22:53] Who, oh
[22:56] Lord, oh Lord, to whom shall we
[23:01] go? But
[23:04] you, oh
[23:06] Lord, oh Lord, to whom shall we
[23:15] go?
[23:17] Thou
[23:19] hast the words of
[23:24] eternal life, and
[23:28] we
[23:30] believe that thou art that living
[23:37] Christ, the
[23:41] son of the livinging
[23:48] God, to whom shall we
[23:51] go but
[23:58] you? To whom shall we
[24:02] go but you?
[24:06] [Music]
[24:10] [Applause]
[24:16] Amen. Brother Zach and the
[24:18] Somano girls also have a song for us
[24:21] tonight. So maybe we can just I'm
[24:25] sorry. I'm sorry. I thought somebody
[24:27] said something there. So um we'll just
[24:29] sing a little capella chorus. Sister Po,
[24:31] you can stay there because I think
[24:32] Zach's going to be playing as they're
[24:34] coming.
[24:38] Amen. He is here.
[24:46] Hallelujah. He is
[24:50] here.
[24:54] Amen. He is
[24:58] here.
[25:00] Holy, holy.
[25:24] Call
[25:25] out your name.
[25:31] [Music]
[25:38] You will
[25:41] never
[25:43] be the same.
[25:50] [Music]
[26:07] to
[26:08] be God.
[26:10] [Music]
[26:16] There is no mountain too
[26:20] tall. He cannot move
[26:27] it. There is no storm to talk. God
[26:33] cannot calm
[26:39] it. There is no sorrow too deep. He
[26:45] cannot
[26:50] sit if he carried the weight of the
[26:56] world upon his shoulders.
[27:04] I know my brother that
[27:07] he will carry you.
[27:15] If he carried the weight of the
[27:20] world upon his shoulders.
[27:29] I know my sister that
[27:32] he will carry you.
[27:38] He said,
[27:41] "Come unto
[27:46] me
[27:47] all who are
[27:53] we and
[27:56] I will
[27:59] give you rest.
[28:02] [Music]
[28:07] There is no problem too big. God cannot
[28:13] solve
[28:18] it. There is no mountain too tall. He
[28:24] cannot move it.
[28:31] There is no storm too dark. God cannot
[28:38] calm
[28:42] it. There is no sorrow too deep. He
[28:48] cannot sue it.
[28:54] If he carried the weight of the
[28:59] world upon his shoulders.
[29:02] [Music]
[29:07] I know my brother that
[29:10] he will car you.
[29:18] If he carried the weight of the
[29:23] world upon his shoulders,
[29:28] [Music]
[29:31] I know my sister that
[29:34] he will carry you.
[29:40] He said,
[29:44] "Come unto me
[29:50] all who are we
[29:53] [Music]
[29:57] and
[29:59] I will
[30:02] give you rest.
[30:10] [Applause]
[30:16] Let's stand together tonight. I sure
[30:18] appreciated the specials we had.
[30:21] Amen. If the brothers could come and
[30:23] take any prayer requests that may have
[30:25] been turned in, brother Ben, if you
[30:27] could bring those. And how many just
[30:30] have a unspoken need on your heart
[30:32] tonight? Want to make that known with an
[30:33] uplifted hand. Amen. So, I know we've
[30:37] got number that are out of town. We'll
[30:40] be traveling back and then just keep our
[30:42] pastor in prayer as well as he'll be
[30:44] traveling to Liberia this coming week.
[30:46] So, brother Ben, if you'd bring the rest
[30:47] of
[30:48] [Music]
[30:52] requests, God bless you all.
[30:57] was thinking this morning when our
[31:00] pastor mentioned the
[31:03] uh cursed of he that's hangs on a tree
[31:06] and I was I know it's Easter week. I was
[31:10] thinking
[31:11] and that the prophet told us that excuse
[31:15] me that Jesus Christ didn't die because
[31:18] of nails on the cross. He died of a
[31:21] broken heart.
[31:24] And I was thinking how
[31:26] Peter, he said, "I'll never deny you.
[31:28] I'll I'll go I'll die for you." And uh
[31:32] the Lord said, "You're going to deny me
[31:34] thrice." And when he denied him three
[31:37] times, I believe they on the last time
[31:40] they made eye
[31:42] contact and the the Bible says that
[31:45] Peter went and cried bitterly. I wonder
[31:49] what went through his mind.
[31:52] But then when after the resurrection
[31:54] when they seen him on the
[31:56] shore, Peter was the first one who he
[31:59] got off the boat and just took off
[32:01] running to
[32:02] him. And then uh after the uh the upper
[32:07] room experience when the pillar of fire
[32:10] divided themselves among
[32:13] them when he came to the point where
[32:15] they were crucify him, he said, "Don't
[32:18] crucify me. Crucify me up upside down.
[32:20] and I'm not worthy to die like my
[32:23] Lord. With that thought, I just we let's
[32:27] just worship him tonight and just know
[32:30] that he died for us from a broken heart
[32:33] cuz he was rejected by the whole world.
[32:36] He died lonely of a broken heart. Peter
[32:38] rejected him. And I believe that uh when
[32:42] they made eye contact, the Lord Jesus
[32:45] gave him a look of love. That's why he
[32:48] went and cried bitterly. the Bible
[32:53] says. And uh with that thought uh also
[32:57] um brother Will I had the opportunity to
[33:00] go to San Carlos
[33:02] Friday, brother Will's work down there
[33:05] and oh man, I said Will really works
[33:09] hard. It's far climbing the mountains.
[33:12] We got to pray for brother will that God
[33:14] would help him and give him
[33:17] strength because those uh it's and then
[33:20] I saw the pictures there in that little
[33:22] humble place. I saw the pictures where
[33:24] there the prophet was preaching there
[33:26] and they were packing them. I saw a
[33:28] brother packing them because he had just
[33:30] did discernment. He was so weak. And I
[33:32] told us Apaches there, you know that God
[33:35] doesn't uh the prophet clearly told us
[33:39] that he he wouldn't go nowhere unless
[33:41] the the God told him to go. Otherwise,
[33:43] he wouldn't go because he said if if he
[33:46] doesn't tell me to go, he might not be
[33:48] there. So I told the Apaches, God told
[33:52] Brother Bram to come here to this humble
[33:55] place. He loves the Apaches. Why?
[33:58] There's Apaches everywhere else, New
[34:00] Mexico and everything. Why did he tell
[34:02] him to go to San
[34:04] Cardinals? So, let's pray for brother
[34:06] Will that he be strengthened, Lord. And
[34:09] I believe there's predestinated seeds
[34:11] over
[34:12] there.
[34:14] Yes. With that, uh, we have a prayer
[34:17] request here that sister Sherry and Mesa
[34:19] is asking for her son Blake in the
[34:24] hospital with a serious painful
[34:25] infection stripped in his hand. also for
[34:29] that salvation of his
[34:31] soul. Pray that uh this sister would
[34:36] give her a peace that surpasses all
[34:38] understanding and that God would come on
[34:41] the scene for that young boy Blake and
[34:44] would save his soul. That's the most
[34:47] important thing. And also the physical
[34:49] healing that he would take all that pain
[34:51] away. Thank you. Let's pray.
[34:55] Lord Jesus, come before thee here this
[34:58] evening, Lord, with great expectation in
[35:01] our hearts, Lord, that you would speak
[35:04] to us, Lord, that you would use Brother
[35:07] Musgrove in a special way, Lord, an old
[35:10] soldier of the cross, Lord, a veteran,
[35:14] Lord. I pray that you would use him
[35:16] mightily. Take over his mind, take over
[35:18] his heart, his vocal cords, Lord, and
[35:21] speak to us, Lord. and we'll be careful,
[35:24] Lord, to give you all the honor and all
[35:26] the glory, Lord, this evening. Lord, the
[35:28] sick and the afflicted, Lord, we play
[35:31] pray for them, Lord. We pray for the
[35:32] young people that are going through
[35:34] trials and this hard time, Lord, in this
[35:37] the most evil time that's ever been in
[35:40] the history of man, Lord, oh God. But
[35:43] you said you'd be with us even in the
[35:45] end of the world, Lord. We love you here
[35:48] this evening, Lord. and we want to
[35:50] worship you in spirit and truth. Lord,
[35:53] bless us, Lord, as we commit this
[35:55] service into your hands for your keeping
[35:58] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[36:07] Amen. Maybe we can sing that chorus. The
[36:09] name of the Lord is a strong tower. The
[36:11] righteous run into it and they are
[36:13] saved. The name of the Lord
[36:17] is a strong
[36:21] tower. The righteous run
[36:25] into him and they are
[36:29] saved. The name of the Lord
[36:34] is a strong
[36:38] tower. The righteous run
[36:41] into it. They are
[36:45] saved. Blessed

[36:51] Lord. Blessed be the name of the
[36:56] Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord

[37:16] Lord most
[37:19] high. The name of the Lord
[37:24] is a strong
[37:28] tower. The righteous run
[37:31] into this. They are saved.

[37:45] town. Let the righteous run into
[37:49] it. And they are
[37:52] sing blessed be the
[37:55] day. Blessed be the name of the
[37:58] Lord.

[38:31] of praise.
[38:33] Blessed be the name of the
[38:35] Lord most high. Amen. God richly bless
[38:39] you. We're so happy to be in the house
[38:40] of the Lord with you this evening. We
[38:43] have a very special guest, very honored
[38:46] guest actually, our dear friend and
[38:49] brother, the Reverend the Elder, the
[38:52] pastor David Musgrove. And we're so
[38:55] happy to have him with us. And his dear
[38:57] wife is here. And we send you greetings,
[39:00] my dear sister. Let's get make them feel
[39:03] welcome. Praise the
[39:05] Lord. And brother Loker and his dear
[39:08] wife is here. God bless them. All the
[39:12] those saints there from charity that are
[39:14] gathered here. I see brother Nathan
[39:16] there. God bless him and his their
[39:19] daughter there. And each of you. We're
[39:20] so glad to be in the house of the Lord.
[39:23] We come expecting to hear from the Lord
[39:25] tonight. Amen. Brother Musgrove. I've
[39:28] known him for a number of years since
[39:30] they moved into the city. And uh he told
[39:33] me he's been preaching since he was 15
[39:35] years old. He'll be 77 in August. So
[39:39] he's over 60 over 61 years of preaching
[39:44] now. How many of you are even 60 years
[39:47] old? He's been preaching for a little
[39:50] while. He might have something that you
[39:53] need to know.
[39:55] He just might. And he's looking very
[39:58] well, isn't he? He's solid in the word.
[40:02] I thank God for him. He's uh um you
[40:06] know, I follow him from a distance. And
[40:09] great leaders are like that. You have
[40:11] more people watching you than perhaps
[40:12] you realize. And when we see each other,
[40:17] it's always nothing but love and
[40:18] respect. And so, the Lord made it
[40:20] possible for him to be here with us
[40:22] tonight. We want to make him feel very
[40:24] welcome as he breaks the bread of life
[40:27] to us. And so as he prepares to come, we
[40:30] just let him have let the Lord have his
[40:31] way and just and um ask God to bless us.
[40:36] If you look come looking for something
[40:39] to say amen to, the Lord will give you
[40:41] something to say amen to. If you come
[40:44] looking to criticize, you will find that
[40:47] also. But I'm coming expecting to have
[40:50] the Holy Spirit impart eternal life to
[40:54] me that I can grow in his grace and
[40:56] mercy to be ready for the rapture and
[41:00] the coming of the Lord. Amen. That's why
[41:03] we're here to get ready so we can go
[41:05] home. So as you prepare to come with all
[41:08] of your heart, let's sing Amazing Grace.
[41:12] Oh,
[41:15] amazing
[41:18] grace. How
[41:20] [Music]
[41:23] sweet that
[41:26] saved a
[41:29] rich like
[41:31] [Music]
[41:34] me. I
[41:37] once was
[41:40] lost, but
[41:43] now I'm
[41:46] found. I was
[41:49] blind, but
[41:51] now I
[41:53] [Music]
[41:56] see. Praise
[42:00] God. Praise
[42:02] God. Praise God.
[42:05] God. Praise
[42:08] God. Praise
[42:11] God. Praise
[42:14] God. Praise
[42:18] [Music]
[42:19] God. Praise
[42:22] God. Praise
[42:25] God. Praise
[42:28] God. Praise
[42:31] God. Praise God.
[42:35] Praise
[42:37] God. Praise
[42:40] God. Well, God bless you, bride. It's
[42:43] wonderful to be here with you. Some of
[42:46] you I have met before and all of you, I
[42:49] believe I've met before the foundation
[42:50] of the world. I believe we was there
[42:53] shouting and singing together. So, we
[42:57] reacquaintance down here on this earth
[42:59] getting ready to go back where we come
[43:01] from. Brother Brandham said we're like a
[43:03] arrow that shoots through time from
[43:06] eternity and goes back into eternity.
[43:08] So, we're just on a little trip tonight
[43:10] and what a blessing being here. Uh so
[43:13] happy for you to see this beautiful
[43:15] building that God has given to you. Not
[43:17] a popular thing now for people to have a
[43:19] church I guess but nevertheless you have
[43:22] to fight uphill but it's really good to
[43:24] see you in fellowship and here to unite
[43:27] yourselves together as the Bible said
[43:29] the much more so as you see the day
[43:31] approaching. So we thank the Lord to see
[43:34] you in the word how we love your pastor
[43:36] and appreciate him so much. We've known
[43:38] him for a few years and he uh has been
[43:42] over to our church and spoke before at
[43:43] Charity Tabernacle. We always enjoyed
[43:45] his his ministry and his precious wife
[43:47] and family and all the talent. May God
[43:50] bless them and bless you for your stand
[43:53] with them and the work that God has
[43:55] given you here in Tucson, Arizona. And
[43:58] we appreciate you very
[44:02] much. And I believe that uh like I said,
[44:05] we have the same father and we come from
[44:08] the same seedline of the life of God. So
[44:11] therefore, today we are one in Christ
[44:13] Jesus because my father is your father.
[44:17] And where I came from, you came from.
[44:19] Where I'm going, you're going. Amen. So
[44:22] we're just united together to fellowship
[44:24] tonight around what we know that God has
[44:26] called us to be. I don't tell them to be
[44:29] too heavy on that uh elder. It sounds
[44:31] really old, you know. So I was the other
[44:35] day, you may be seated for a moment. Uh
[44:37] uh we went by a a place, one of these
[44:40] gym show deals and uh and so anyway, I
[44:45] believe I came from eternity, you know,
[44:47] and I know you do also. And this man uh
[44:50] was standing there looking at a dinosaur
[44:53] and they said the dinosaur was something
[44:55] like 72 million years old or something
[44:57] like that, you know, this dinosaur
[44:59] skeleton and everything. So I walked up
[45:01] and I I told the guy, I said, "Wow, he's
[45:04] almost as old as I am." And the guy
[45:06] said, "Speak for yourself." He thought I
[45:09] was crazy. But you know, we do go all
[45:11] the way back in eternity. We come from
[45:13] God. We're going back to God. And so
[45:16] today, we don't just unite as somebody
[45:18] that we have met here in this life. We
[45:20] unite as somebody that is eternal. I
[45:23] look today at you as eternal. I look at
[45:26] you that you come from God. And brother
[45:27] Brandham said that in order to have
[45:30] eternal life, you had to come from a
[45:32] part of God. So that's what we believe
[45:35] today. that we are a part of Jehovah God
[45:38] that's here in this life for a few days.
[45:40] We wouldn't have had to come had it not
[45:42] been for the fall, but through the fall
[45:44] we came here to manifest the attributes
[45:46] of God. So, it's wonderful to be here. I
[45:49] fight the battle with you. I was
[45:51] thinking about a beautiful uh quote of
[45:53] the prophets where he said in Acts 4
[45:56] when they assembled together, I was with
[45:57] them when the building shook after the
[46:00] prayer meeting. The building shook where
[46:02] they were sitting. I was identified with
[46:05] them there. I preached with Paul at Mars
[46:09] Hill. I was with John on the aisle of
[46:11] Patmas and seen his second coming. I was
[46:14] with Luther in the reformation. I was
[46:17] with Wesley, the fire brand, the snatch
[46:20] of the fires when the great revolution
[46:23] against the angelic church. I was there
[46:25] with him and I am here tonight. And he
[46:28] said, "And I'd like to say I'm here
[46:29] tonight at Shalom Tabernacle and I'm
[46:32] identified with you. The same kind of
[46:35] group, the same kind of experience. I
[46:38] must be a Christian. I must stay
[46:41] identified where the word of God is
[46:43] being manifest. I'm identified with a
[46:46] group that feels the spirit of God. I'm
[46:49] identified with a group that knows he's
[46:52] unveiled and knows he's the same
[46:54] yesterday, today, and forever.
[46:58] Amen. I know that that is not it's not
[47:01] fanaticism. It's Jesus Christ the same
[47:04] yesterday, today, and forever. You know
[47:06] what brother Brandham said? His message
[47:08] swept the world. Jesus Christ the same
[47:10] yesterday, today, and forever. He said,
[47:12] "Do you know what that means? That means
[47:15] that he's ever present tense. He was
[47:18] present tense 10,000 years ago. He's
[47:21] present tense today and he'll be present
[47:23] tense tomorrow. the same yesterday,
[47:25] today, and forever. I'm identified with
[47:28] a group that is here tonight. Yet,
[47:31] they're called a bunch of heretics, yet
[47:33] a bunch of fanatics on account of the
[47:35] word of God. But I'm not ashamed of the
[47:37] gospel of Jesus Christ, for it's the
[47:39] power of God and salvation. And I'm one.
[47:43] I'm with them living apostles. I spoke
[47:46] of vindicated God veiled in human form
[47:49] in men and women. God in his immoria
[47:53] again. Who is God immoria? It's you.
[47:57] Godia that's chose your body to dwell
[48:01] in. So God immoria again unveil himself
[48:05] to make himself known to his people. And
[48:07] brother Brandham even said that every
[48:09] fiber of your body would be filled with
[48:11] the Holy Ghost. Then what does that make
[48:13] you? There's only two, the Holy Ghost or
[48:15] the unholy ghost. It makes you the very
[48:18] characteristic and attribute of Jehovah
[48:21] God. Amen. Yet a little while in the
[48:24] world won't see me no more. I'll be
[48:25] veiled in
[48:27] them. But ye shall see me for I'll be
[48:29] with you even in you all the way to the
[48:32] consummation the changing from Luther
[48:34] Wesley and on for the glory of God. I'm
[48:37] still the same God that liveth and going
[48:39] back to the original glory. He was
[48:42] broke. He has broken every
[48:43] denominational veil, every sound barrier
[48:45] that sounds that says, "Oh, that's
[48:47] fanaticism." He broke right through
[48:49] that. The sound that came out there
[48:51] said, "Oh, them people are crazy." He
[48:53] broke right through that veil. He
[48:56] didn't, "Oh, you can't do it. You're
[48:58] nothing but a bunch of fanatics." He
[48:59] broke right through that. No such thing
[49:01] as all these things that God is doing.
[49:04] Well, I can say today there is such
[49:06] thing and you're here today. So, may God
[49:09] richly bless you. We love and appreciate
[49:11] you. Some of y'all knew me. One of my
[49:13] brothers back here knew me back when I
[49:15] was just a young man. I used to have
[49:16] black hair, you know, and I was a little
[49:18] younger, but I'm a little older now, but
[49:20] I've had some experiences with the the
[49:23] the the the great things of God. And I
[49:26] can say my testimony would be as brother
[49:29] Bam said on Statue of a Perfect Man. We
[49:31] don't care a tent or a cottage. Why
[49:33] should I care? Live or die, sink or
[49:35] drown. This is the thing I'm interested
[49:38] in is the kingdom of God. Whether I
[49:41] maintain my home, whether I maintain my
[49:43] family, whether I maintain whatever it
[49:45] is, let me maintain Christ, the hope of
[49:48] glory. Build me up, oh Lord, unto this.
[49:51] Let Christ be my head that workketh
[49:53] through me on my foundation, my faith
[49:56] that's in him. Let virtue and knowledge
[49:59] and temperance and patience, godliness,
[50:01] and brotherly kindness work in me, oh
[50:03] Lord, is my prayer. I don't care. Live
[50:05] or die, sink or drown, denomination or
[50:07] no denomination, friend or old friend,
[50:10] let that work in me. Let Christ's virtue
[50:12] and knowledge flow out that I might be
[50:14] able to teach those. So that's my
[50:16] testimony tonight. Amen. So it's
[50:19] wonderful to be here with you, my wife
[50:21] and I, and of course, Brother Jeff,
[50:23] Sister Holly, and Brother Barrett and
[50:25] his precious daughter. It's wonderful to
[50:27] be here in fellowship with you. I I told
[50:30] brother uh brother I tell I told brother
[50:33] Israel I said well I supposed to came
[50:35] over for a prayer meeting here a while
[50:37] back and I coming down with co and so I
[50:39] said I wanted to come over so bad and be
[50:41] in the prayer meeting but I wasn't able
[50:43] to make it so I owed him one but uh it
[50:45] ended up owing him one I guess he
[50:47] thought meant that I was going to come
[50:48] over and speak for you so here I am
[50:50] tonight. Amen. And I pray there'd be
[50:52] something said that will enlighten you
[50:55] to who you are. Because brother Random
[50:57] said, if we ever find out who we are,
[50:59] the rapture would take place. I don't
[51:02] have a message to tell you how to get
[51:03] through the tribulation period. I don't
[51:05] know anything about that. But I've got a
[51:07] message to know to tell you how to get
[51:09] ready for the rapture because I don't
[51:11] have nothing to do with the tribulation
[51:12] period. All this stuff's going on out
[51:14] here. It's scary if you didn't have that
[51:17] anchor in Christ Jesus. I've already
[51:19] been connected to my theophony. I know
[51:21] that I got a body awaiting me, standing
[51:24] right here. And so do you. You have that
[51:26] great presence of faith today. And I can
[51:30] truly say, "Oh, death, where is thy
[51:31] sting? Oh grave, where's thy victory?"
[51:34] Because there's something that's
[51:35] bubbling up in my soul to know that I am
[51:38] eternal tonight. I'm come from God. I'm
[51:40] going back to God. I'm a part of God
[51:43] standing in the pulpit tonight
[51:44] proclaiming his word and that he is the
[51:47] same today as he ever was because he is
[51:50] the almighty God. The power of his
[51:52] spirit is living in the believer. So if
[51:55] you don't mind standing with me just for
[51:56] a moment for the the reading of the word
[51:59] of
[52:01] God in Gen in Galatians
[52:06] 3:16-18. Now to Abraham and his seed
[52:10] were the promise made. That's ab that's
[52:12] Galatians 3:16 and 18. Now to Abraham
[52:16] and his seed were the promise made. He
[52:19] saith not and to his seeds as of many,
[52:22] but is one and to thy seed which is
[52:26] Christ. And so this this evening I'd
[52:29] like to preach a little small message if
[52:31] you don't mind on the real true seed of
[52:33] God. How many believe you're a true seed
[52:35] of God? Oh, I like that. Amen. The true
[52:37] seed of God, you may be seated. The true
[52:40] seed, we know if you look at the seed
[52:43] itself, it means that when you plant the
[52:46] seed for a specific plant variety, the
[52:50] resulting plants will be genetically
[52:54] identical to the parent plant, exit
[52:57] exhibiting the same characteristics.
[52:59] That's what a true seed is. And a seed
[53:02] always will produce seeds. Amen. But uh
[53:07] a an an untrue seed does not have seeds.
[53:10] It's hybrid because there's no seed that
[53:13] it produces. You ever eat a seedless
[53:15] grape? It can't reproduce
[53:17] itself. You ever eat a watermelon with
[53:19] no seed in it? It can't produce itself.
[53:22] But we realize the true seed implies
[53:24] that the offspring plants grow from the
[53:27] seed and are essentially clones of the
[53:30] parent plant inherited the same traits
[53:32] and characteristic. So now is what we're
[53:35] looking at is the seed of God. Because
[53:37] there's only real two really two seed on
[53:39] the face of the earth. That's the
[53:41] serpent's seed and the seed of God. You
[53:44] go back in the garden of Eden, there was
[53:46] two trees. Tree of life and the tree of
[53:49] knowledge of good and evil. And from
[53:51] there came four seeds. And we realize
[53:54] those seeds is what we want to look at
[53:55] today. Because you know, you take a
[53:57] little acorn for instance. That little
[54:00] acorn that you find in the field, that
[54:02] little acorn is screaming out, "I am an
[54:06] oak tree." You look at that little
[54:08] acorn, you say, "Now wait just a
[54:10] minute." But inside of that little
[54:12] acorn, there is an oak tree. And when
[54:15] that first little sapling comes forth,
[54:17] you can hear the voice of that little
[54:19] seed saying, "I am a oak tree." Amen.
[54:23] That's the confession because that's
[54:25] what he was born to be. And as he grows,
[54:28] people might say, "Are you crazy or
[54:29] what? You think you're you're just a
[54:32] little bitty seed." But see, that seed
[54:34] has got life in it. And a real true seed
[54:37] of God has got life in it to know where
[54:40] they come from and know what they're to
[54:42] be manifesting in their generation.
[54:45] So that little seed starts growing. He
[54:47] might go through the storms and all the
[54:49] things it goes through, but it's got an
[54:51] inner uh inner life in it that is
[54:55] growing and growing and growing. And
[54:58] that little seed is not perfect until
[55:01] when that oak tree is completely filled
[55:04] out, it'll drop another seed that's got
[55:07] the same life in it. Because that's what
[55:09] it's literally striving toward, to
[55:12] produce other seed. And that seed will
[55:14] fall on the ground or sometime a
[55:16] squirrel will get the little seed and
[55:18] take and bury it in the ground. But when
[55:19] it buries in the ground, there's
[55:20] something in that little seed that's
[55:23] going to come forth and bring forth
[55:24] another oak tree. So you are a seed of
[55:28] God. But let me tell you something. You
[55:30] are not a seed without being uh
[55:33] germatized by the life of God. It's
[55:37] there's a little uh uh a little thing
[55:39] they do to a seed to feel it to see if
[55:43] it's it's literally been germatized or
[55:45] not. And it's what they do with seeds.
[55:47] They take the oak tree seeds there and
[55:50] some are not germatized just dead seeds.
[55:53] They're they can never produce. So it's
[55:57] what they do. They put them in in water.
[56:00] And when they put them seeds in water,
[56:02] the ones that goes down to the bottom is
[56:04] the ones that's germatized. And the
[56:07] others just float on the top. And they
[56:09] know no use planting the ones that just
[56:12] floats on the top because they're not
[56:14] germmitized. But the one that's
[56:15] germatized, it falls in that water down
[56:18] to the bottom. And they say, "Now
[56:19] there's a true seed." And that's the way
[56:22] the word of God is. The word is the
[56:25] water of the washing of the word. And
[56:27] when the true seed of God is put in the
[56:29] water, they got a depth to them. They're
[56:32] not floaters way up here on the top just
[56:34] to say that I'm a believer of the
[56:36] message, but they go deep into the word
[56:38] and they're anchored in by the true
[56:40] blood cell of God
[56:42] itself. We're not here today just
[56:45] because God chose us to be believers. We
[56:47] are here because of we have within us
[56:49] the capabilities to bring forth eternity
[56:53] and be changed from the moment in the
[56:54] twink of an eye in the great rapture
[56:56] that lays ahead. That's how you are true
[56:58] seeds of God. So are you a floater today
[57:01] or are you deep in the word of God? Uh
[57:03] are you just up here in salvation
[57:05] somewhere? Are you deep into redemption
[57:08] knowing that you got to be redeemed back
[57:09] to what you come from? Because remember
[57:12] now you come from somewhere and even Job
[57:16] was challenged by God. Job where was
[57:18] thou and where was you today? I'd like
[57:21] to challenge you. Where was you when the
[57:23] foundation of the world was laid? I was
[57:26] there. Where was you at all of the times
[57:29] that brother Brandham said when all the
[57:31] reformers came forth and all the things
[57:34] happened from the time of the church
[57:35] ages that we've been in? I was there.
[57:38] You was there. We was there when God
[57:42] spoke his word and created the heavens
[57:45] and the earth. I was there. I was a
[57:47] thought in the mind of God. Elohim
[57:50] thought about me and one day he spoke me
[57:53] and I become an expression of Elohim
[57:56] which was the logos of God. I become a
[58:00] living creation. I become impossible to
[58:03] be deceived. I can't be deceived. You
[58:05] can't be deceived. The church world
[58:08] thought even Billy Graham that you could
[58:09] be deceived. But we know the prophet
[58:12] come along. He said it said if it was
[58:14] possible he would deceive the very
[58:16] elected. But it is not possible for you
[58:19] to be deceived because you are a true
[58:21] seed a born seed a filled seed of God.
[58:26] So living inside is that living dynamo
[58:28] with the life of God. So if you're just
[58:31] a floater today, then let me allow the
[58:34] Holy Spirit to impregnate you with the
[58:37] power of the word, which will change you
[58:40] from just being a floater out here in
[58:42] life, floating around into the depth of
[58:44] the reality of what God really is in the
[58:46] heart of the believer. Amen. That's what
[58:49] God is depending on you to do. My in the
[58:53] word is a thought expressed in the
[58:55] beginning was the word. And brother
[58:57] Brandham even said the earth is the word
[58:59] of God. You realize that the earth. So
[59:03] he reached down even to the dust of the
[59:05] earth and created a body for Adam to
[59:08] dwell in. But that was his word. He took
[59:10] it out of the word. Everything comes
[59:13] from the word of God. So even the dust
[59:15] of the earth was the word of God. And
[59:18] that word was made flesh. And there was
[59:21] Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. A
[59:25] question was asked by brother Brandham.
[59:26] What was the difference in Adam and Eve
[59:29] and what we are today? And brother
[59:32] Brandham said, 'Well, Adam and Eve did
[59:34] not have a belly button. Now, everybody
[59:36] knows what a belly button is because
[59:38] they did not come that way of life. They
[59:41] was a spoken word of God. And then God
[59:44] took Eve out of the rib of Adam and
[59:48] created itself and took the feminist
[59:49] part out of Adam and put it in
[59:52] Eve. Why? so they could
[59:55] reproduce. The two trees in the Garden
[59:57] of Eden was trees of
[1:00:00] reproduction. One would have been death,
[1:00:03] the other would have been life. And
[1:00:05] because that Eve listened and was beg by
[1:00:09] Satan, she ptook of the tree of
[1:00:12] knowledge of good and evil. And then
[1:00:13] there was death, but till then there was
[1:00:16] no death. And Adam, because that he
[1:00:19] loved Eve, parttook of the fruit also.
[1:00:20] Those was two trees that was going to
[1:00:23] reproduce. One was going to reproduce
[1:00:26] eternity. The other tree would reproduce
[1:00:29] death. And a woman become by by
[1:00:32] partaking of the unforbidden fruit, she
[1:00:34] become a producer of death. Because
[1:00:37] every time that she had a child, that
[1:00:39] child would die. That child would have
[1:00:40] diseases. That child would go through
[1:00:42] what your natural body goes through
[1:00:44] today. Now, we didn't cause that because
[1:00:48] we are victims of circumstance. Because
[1:00:51] we was born in a body that was born out
[1:00:55] of a a a death
[1:00:57] situation, but it wasn't meant to be in
[1:01:00] the beginning. But the tree of life
[1:01:02] where it would have been born, there
[1:01:04] would have been a spoken word creation,
[1:01:07] a spoken word like Adam and Eve was. And
[1:01:09] Eve would have bore children. And those
[1:01:11] children would have been brought forth,
[1:01:13] but not through pain, not through
[1:01:16] conception of of sex, but been brought
[1:01:19] forth of the ver power of the spoken
[1:01:21] word as Adam would speak and there would
[1:01:23] be a
[1:01:24] creation. And because it come the other
[1:01:26] way which was provided by God for the
[1:01:29] animal life to come forth. But yet
[1:01:31] because that Adam and Eve ptook of the
[1:01:33] unforbidden fruit, then every person
[1:01:36] that was born from a woman was born to
[1:01:42] die. Amen. But had have it been born
[1:01:45] through Adam and Eve through the spoken
[1:01:47] word, they would have never had to die.
[1:01:49] they would have come to a a time of life
[1:01:51] which would have been a perfect time of
[1:01:54] life just like your theophony is in a
[1:01:56] glorified condition and be able from
[1:01:58] therefore walk and talk and live forever
[1:02:01] and ever and ever throughout eternity.
[1:02:04] So I just want to bring that to you to
[1:02:05] see about the difference between the
[1:02:07] seed of God and the seed of the serpent.
[1:02:11] Now, the thing of it is is God put your
[1:02:14] name on the lamb's book of life before
[1:02:18] the foundation of the world. So, those
[1:02:20] names on the lamb's book of life, not
[1:02:22] just in the book of life because you
[1:02:25] could be taken out of the book of life,
[1:02:27] but your name cannot be taken out of the
[1:02:29] lamb's book of life because when it was
[1:02:32] put there, it was a seal of God in that
[1:02:34] lamb's book of life that prove that you
[1:02:37] come from God and you're going back to
[1:02:38] God.
[1:02:40] So therefore, that true lamb's book of
[1:02:42] life, but not in the book of life. Like
[1:02:44] Judas, his name was taken out of the
[1:02:46] book of life. And that doesn't even
[1:02:47] record that Judas was ever even born. I
[1:02:51] mean, even at the white great white
[1:02:52] throne judgment, people like Judas and
[1:02:55] people that had no representation here
[1:02:57] on the earth and their na their name was
[1:02:59] taken out of the book of life, they
[1:03:00] won't even have a chance at the great
[1:03:02] white throne judgment because there'll
[1:03:04] be nothing written about them.
[1:03:06] I mean, at least, you know, if you're uh
[1:03:09] in the book of life and you do live as a
[1:03:12] Christian and maybe there's no seed of
[1:03:14] the life of God in there from the Lamb's
[1:03:16] book of life, you know, you'd have a
[1:03:17] chance of the great white throne
[1:03:19] judgment. But I'm not preaching to
[1:03:21] you're not on the going to the white
[1:03:23] great great white throne judgment. Your
[1:03:24] name is written in the Lamb's book of
[1:03:26] life put there and God will not lose you
[1:03:29] because he said all the Father hath
[1:03:31] given will come. Now, I praise out of
[1:03:33] this that you'll have a faith, a real
[1:03:36] faith that locks in. And that faith that
[1:03:39] locks in today, you'll never shake.
[1:03:41] You'll never want to go back because
[1:03:43] once you realize who you are, there's no
[1:03:45] going back. What would you go back to
[1:03:47] the pig pin for? When you're called to
[1:03:49] be a seed of God, manifesting and
[1:03:52] reproducing the very life of Christ
[1:03:55] himself. So therefore, there was a time
[1:03:58] when you was born. You was a spoken word
[1:04:00] seed of God. And you must be born again.
[1:04:04] Meaning that you got to hook back into
[1:04:06] that same life you had in the beginning
[1:04:08] because you had a a birth there. You had
[1:04:10] a life there. You had a representation
[1:04:12] there in the mind of God. But all of a
[1:04:15] sudden when you come down to the world,
[1:04:16] all the confusing, all the the winds
[1:04:19] blowing and the oak tree almost blowed
[1:04:21] out from its roots, but it's got deep
[1:04:23] enough roots till them oak trees can
[1:04:25] hold
[1:04:26] on. But you've got to have a root tree.
[1:04:29] You've got to have roots to that tree
[1:04:30] because you get all kinds of stuff like
[1:04:32] what's happening now right here in
[1:04:33] Tucson and the wind blowing and the
[1:04:36] devil trying to bring the false
[1:04:38] representation of the bride of Christ
[1:04:40] into light and the papers and everything
[1:04:42] else. That don't bother me none because
[1:04:44] I've got a representation in heaven. And
[1:04:46] they can't they can't uh they can't
[1:04:48] smudge you. They can't they can lie on
[1:04:51] you or whatever they want to do. But God
[1:04:52] has a record and said they are perfect.
[1:04:56] Do you know there's nothing against you?
[1:04:59] You are of the seedline of God and
[1:05:01] there's nothing against you because you
[1:05:03] have the life of God living in
[1:05:06] you.
[1:05:09] Therefore, God himself unveiled and
[1:05:13] being led by the spirit. We are the sons
[1:05:15] of God, the original reproduction from
[1:05:19] the tree of life.
[1:05:21] Now, you've got to realize how that
[1:05:23] you're represented. Because if you think
[1:05:25] you're represented by just what the
[1:05:26] flesh is, you're not going to get very
[1:05:28] far. And a lot of people spend all their
[1:05:31] time looking in the mirror and saying,
[1:05:32] "Oh, why are you such a failure? Why
[1:05:34] can't you do this and that?" But what
[1:05:36] why don't we start saying what God
[1:05:38] thinks about us? And when you know what
[1:05:41] God thinks about you, it's going to be
[1:05:43] alltogether different. There was a
[1:05:45] beautiful quote where the prophet
[1:05:47] identified Christ and what Christ was.
[1:05:49] Because we know he was God manifest in
[1:05:51] flesh. Jesus Christ was God manifest in
[1:05:55] flesh. In him was both father, son and
[1:05:58] holy ghost. Cuz he was the fullness of
[1:06:00] the godhead bodily. And in our
[1:06:03] preconception of the idea of what the
[1:06:06] working is sometime is backed by
[1:06:09] tradition. We come out of a church. We
[1:06:11] come out of trinitarianism or whatever
[1:06:14] you come out of wonders or whatever. And
[1:06:16] then we have a traditional mindset of
[1:06:19] what we think God is all about. But we
[1:06:22] got to go beyond that traditional
[1:06:23] mindset that you was maybe raised in or
[1:06:26] you maybe thought about God. And you
[1:06:28] have to lose all of that to take on the
[1:06:30] mind of Christ. And that's what this
[1:06:32] message is. the very mind of Christ
[1:06:34] revealed to the bride of Christ to be
[1:06:37] able to produce reproduce the very life
[1:06:39] of Jesus Christ itself. St. Mark 16,
[1:06:43] it's a living example of the revelation
[1:06:46] of God's word to the believer. So today,
[1:06:49] you're not just somebody on the earth
[1:06:50] and will I thank the Lord because I'm a
[1:06:52] believer. No, you are reproduction of
[1:06:55] Jesus Christ. Can I say that? Hello,
[1:06:58] Miss Jesus. You're a reproduction of
[1:07:01] Jesus Christ. Well, I'm a believer. Oh,
[1:07:03] even more than that. You're a true seed
[1:07:05] of God that's got the life of God living
[1:07:07] in you. Amen. In our trinitarian, I was
[1:07:10] had a trinitarian background. When I was
[1:07:12] young, I was in the what they call a
[1:07:14] Christ ambassadors, the CE, they call it
[1:07:17] Christ ambassadors, CA uh young people's
[1:07:20] uh deal. And I was like the leader of
[1:07:22] the young people's deal back 15 16 years
[1:07:25] ago, 16 years old. And so I was taught
[1:07:30] that there was three gods, you know, God
[1:07:31] the Father, God the Son, God the Holy
[1:07:33] Ghost. And you know that that that that
[1:07:36] stays with you. I was taught that the
[1:07:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost was a speak in
[1:07:41] tongues that it was some emotional
[1:07:43] workup or something. You felt the
[1:07:45] shivers and you know, you can do that.
[1:07:47] You can One one man said, "If I've got
[1:07:50] to get on the floor to get the Holy
[1:07:51] Ghost, I'm not going to do I said,
[1:07:53] "Well, you probably won't get the Holy
[1:07:54] Ghost because when you say, "I'm not
[1:07:56] going to," God usually makes you do that
[1:07:58] way, you know. But the Holy Ghost, we
[1:08:01] know, come through this the gifts and
[1:08:03] and we sought the gifts. I've spoken
[1:08:06] tongues. I've interpreted. I've run the
[1:08:09] aisles with all the Pentecostal people.
[1:08:10] Had a good time. But there come a time
[1:08:13] when God came to me with this revelation
[1:08:16] that I realized that I no longer had the
[1:08:18] opportunity of the gifts, but I had the
[1:08:21] giver.
[1:08:22] And that's the key tonight is this
[1:08:25] message brought the giver and revealed
[1:08:27] in a shout voice in the trump of God the
[1:08:30] very giver as he descended from heaven
[1:08:32] and come down to take you
[1:08:35] home. And I didn't choose this. He chose
[1:08:38] me. You didn't choose to believe this.
[1:08:41] He chose you. And he put within you the
[1:08:44] ability to respond to the power of the
[1:08:46] unveiling of the word of God. You look
[1:08:49] back and say, "Well, how did it happen
[1:08:51] to me? Why did he choose me? Look how
[1:08:52] many million that's represented right
[1:08:54] here tonight. You're one in a million.
[1:08:57] There's several million that's
[1:08:58] represented right in this building
[1:08:59] tonight. And you happen to be one in a
[1:09:01] million that had a seed of life that's
[1:09:04] in you. And you believe this because
[1:09:06] God's in you. You don't believe because
[1:09:08] of who you are. You believe it because
[1:09:10] God is in you. And brother Brandard
[1:09:13] said, "You're not the bride. God is the
[1:09:15] bride. But he's in you with a seed of
[1:09:18] the life of God in a reproduction that's
[1:09:21] brought brings forth eternity. And you
[1:09:24] have the power to impart eternal life.
[1:09:27] How do you impart eternal life? By
[1:09:29] letting somebody know as they reveal the
[1:09:32] word of God that you are that word.
[1:09:34] Tonight, I'm here to preach eternal
[1:09:36] life. I'm not here to preach you into
[1:09:39] another 25 years or 30 years. I'm here
[1:09:42] to tell you tonight that you are
[1:09:44] eternal. You come from God. And brother
[1:09:46] Brandham said that eternity is like a
[1:09:48] circle. You remember that eternity. It
[1:09:50] didn't have a beginning or an end. And
[1:09:52] it dropped down to that little hickey of
[1:09:53] time. And that's what you're in. That
[1:09:55] little hickey of
[1:09:57] time. You're a victim of circumstance to
[1:10:00] be down here. But brother Bram said, you
[1:10:02] go right back into that eternal circle
[1:10:04] again. When you come out of this time
[1:10:06] element, this time element I'm in
[1:10:08] tonight. I I this is not me. You're
[1:10:10] looking at me and you say that's a
[1:10:12] that's a man called brother Muskro. But
[1:10:14] the real me is something that's on the
[1:10:17] inside that is alive. And brother
[1:10:20] Brandham said the devil can't get your
[1:10:22] soul. God has your soul in his hand. He
[1:10:25] said because your soul is that part that
[1:10:27] come from God. And that's why that soul
[1:10:30] that come from God is in you and it
[1:10:34] can't be taken
[1:10:35] away. Satan, you cannot get to God's
[1:10:38] people. I don't care if you took and
[1:10:40] tied them up to a post somewhere and
[1:10:42] whipped them with a bull whip. You can't
[1:10:44] get God out of them. You can try to boil
[1:10:46] them with oil. You can try to mock them.
[1:10:48] You can try to talk about them. They're
[1:10:50] not shook by that because they know who
[1:10:52] they are. They know where they come
[1:10:54] from. They're not of this world. They're
[1:10:56] just in the world for a few days. God
[1:10:59] himself made manifest in the word of
[1:11:01] God. Jesus Christ, brother Ram said,
[1:11:03] have faith with the power because he had
[1:11:06] power. He had that life. He was God
[1:11:08] himself manifest in flesh. See, brother
[1:11:11] Brandham said Jesus was the body, but
[1:11:13] God was a spirit in the body. So the
[1:11:16] body had to be brought forth without a
[1:11:18] sex act. It still came through the womb
[1:11:20] of a woman. The body did, but without a
[1:11:22] sex act, or he would have went back and
[1:11:24] been brought forth like that uh a Abel
[1:11:28] was Cain and Abel. But he couldn't be
[1:11:31] brought back that way. There had to be a
[1:11:33] spoken word. And you are a true Mary.
[1:11:36] And what did Mary say? Brother Brandham
[1:11:38] said the difference in Mary uh in the
[1:11:41] Bible and Eve was the fact that Mary
[1:11:44] said, "Be it unto me according to thy
[1:11:47] word, O Lord." And Eve was begal by
[1:11:52] Satan to partake of the tree of
[1:11:55] knowledge of good and evil that would
[1:11:56] bring forth
[1:11:57] death. We live in a very knowledgeable
[1:12:00] age, a very smart age. Brother Bram
[1:12:03] said, "The devil reached up and pulled
[1:12:05] off uh uh pulled off of the tree of life
[1:12:08] and the first thing they had was an Adam
[1:12:09] bomb and then all of the wars and the
[1:12:12] rumors of wars and everything else.
[1:12:14] They're from the tree of the knowledge
[1:12:16] of good and evil trying to figure it out
[1:12:18] up
[1:12:19] here. Oh my, wouldn't it be something
[1:12:21] instead of all the politicians if they
[1:12:23] did the conduct, order, and doctrine in
[1:12:24] their White House over there? It make a
[1:12:27] big difference." Amen. But they turned
[1:12:30] it down. instead the knowledge that man
[1:12:32] would have to be able to produce. And
[1:12:34] now what a mess it's in. I'll tell you
[1:12:36] if we look at it though and we say,
[1:12:38] "Thanks be to God. I never saw it come
[1:12:41] together so perfect." Every piece of the
[1:12:43] puzzle is coming together. And you could
[1:12:46] have preached it for years. I've been in
[1:12:47] the message now since 1967 when I first
[1:12:51] heard about a prophet. And the first
[1:12:52] tape that I heard which was God's eagle,
[1:12:55] I never looked back. The Assembly God
[1:12:57] Church, I said goodbye. They started
[1:13:00] they started fasting and praying that
[1:13:02] I'd stay in the Assembly of God church.
[1:13:04] I said, "Hey, go east, man. I'm already
[1:13:06] I've got a revelation from God. I done
[1:13:08] heard from the prophet of God in this
[1:13:10] end time. Amen. I'm on my way to the
[1:13:12] resurrection." Amen. It didn't even
[1:13:15] wasn't even a second thought to me. They
[1:13:17] want me to be a pastor of a church
[1:13:18] there, Assembly God Church that I was
[1:13:20] raised in. But I said, "No." I said,
[1:13:22] "I've got something higher to fly than
[1:13:25] to sit on the barnyard fence and pluck
[1:13:28] around with the chickens.
[1:13:30] I'm sorry. They just couldn't help
[1:13:32] theirelves. But hey, I couldn't help
[1:13:33] myself because I was an eagle either.
[1:13:35] And you can't help yourself with your
[1:13:37] front kin folk think you're crazy or
[1:13:39] whatever. Your next door neighbor, you
[1:13:40] can't help the fact of what you are.
[1:13:42] You're an eagle. And you try to act like
[1:13:45] a chicken and you're going to be a most
[1:13:46] miserable person on the face of the
[1:13:48] earth when you're an eagle. Amen. Cluck
[1:13:51] around trying to act like a float around
[1:13:54] here and float around there and an eagle
[1:13:56] one day. No. No. you when you realize
[1:13:58] you're an eagle, there's no more on the
[1:14:00] barnyard. You're ready to soar into
[1:14:02] heavenly places and you're sore to ready
[1:14:05] to go into that place that God has
[1:14:06] called you to be
[1:14:08] in. Look at Jesus Christ. Just to give
[1:14:10] you an example, and I know brother Paulo
[1:14:13] is a long-winded preacher. I'm going to
[1:14:15] preach a lot. I didn't ask how long he
[1:14:17] preached, but an hour hour or something.
[1:14:19] So, I'm not going to keep you very long
[1:14:21] tonight, but I just enjoy sharing the
[1:14:23] faith that I've got in you. I've got
[1:14:25] faith in you. I know that you have not
[1:14:28] been brought into this message by no
[1:14:31] man. You've been brought in by God
[1:14:32] himself. And so therefore, I'm preaching
[1:14:35] and having a good time letting you know
[1:14:37] who you are. Brother Brandham said that
[1:14:40] Jesus had faith with his power. How did
[1:14:44] he? He said, "I could do nothing in
[1:14:47] myself." Why? He relied upon what he
[1:14:50] was. He relied in knowing that he was
[1:14:52] the word. You mean Jesus knew that he
[1:14:55] was the word? Yes, he was the word. He
[1:14:58] knew that he was brought forth by a
[1:15:00] virgin birth. So therefore, he knew that
[1:15:03] he was that one that was to be the
[1:15:05] Messiah. And brother Brandham said he
[1:15:07] had faith in God who made him the
[1:15:10] word. Can you have faith in God who made
[1:15:13] you a believer? Faith in God who made
[1:15:15] you a true seed. Amen. Not faith in your
[1:15:19] own self and your ability, but faith in
[1:15:21] the God that said that I have your soul
[1:15:25] in my hand and I'm not going to lose
[1:15:27] you. I can't lose a one. He had faith in
[1:15:30] God who made him the word because he
[1:15:32] understood his position. He knowed what
[1:15:35] he was because the scripture had said he
[1:15:38] was this and every scripture tied in to
[1:15:42] prove that he was exactly what the
[1:15:44] scripture said he would be. and he knew
[1:15:46] what he was. Now, here's the key for you
[1:15:49] knowing what you are and that you're
[1:15:51] Germanized by the seed word of God's
[1:15:53] life. Therefore, he relied upon what God
[1:15:57] had made him. And when you know that God
[1:16:00] has made you a believer, you're not
[1:16:01] relying on whether you can hold on or
[1:16:03] not. You're relying on the fact that God
[1:16:06] made you a believer and that the word of
[1:16:08] God is absolutely personally your
[1:16:11] identification.
[1:16:13] And when you know that something's going
[1:16:15] to happen. Amen. He made him that. He
[1:16:18] can rely upon what God had made him.
[1:16:20] These signs would follow them that
[1:16:22] believe. He had faith in what he was.
[1:16:24] And if you're a believer, you have faith
[1:16:26] in what you are. You're a believer. And
[1:16:29] if you got faith in God, the Bible said
[1:16:31] over here, if our hearts condemn us not,
[1:16:34] we have faith in God. See, it doesn't
[1:16:37] condemn us because we have faith. We
[1:16:39] have confidence toward God. If you want
[1:16:41] to read that, it's found in St. John
[1:16:43] 3:12. Brother Ram said, "Not only thing
[1:16:46] now, the only thing you have to do then
[1:16:48] is have faith in what you are." Have
[1:16:51] faith in what the word says you are. If
[1:16:54] the word says you're redeemed, have
[1:16:55] faith in that. If the word says you're a
[1:16:58] believer, have faith in that. If the
[1:17:00] word said he would send Malachi 4,
[1:17:02] you've got faith in that. And brother
[1:17:04] Brandham had faith in what he was
[1:17:07] fulfilling because the angel met him one
[1:17:09] day and told him and giving the
[1:17:11] scripture, "Behold, I'll send you Elijah
[1:17:13] the prophet before the great and
[1:17:14] dreadful day of the Lord." And he knew
[1:17:16] by that who he was. And he could
[1:17:19] identify by the scripture and the works
[1:17:20] that he done. See, I am that I am. And I
[1:17:24] am the Jesus said. See, he he read it is
[1:17:29] written of me. Didn't David in Psalms
[1:17:31] and the prophets and all this speak of
[1:17:33] him? I am the bread of life that cometh
[1:17:36] from God out of heaven. I am the tree of
[1:17:38] life from the Garden of Eden. I am all
[1:17:41] these things. Jesus said, I am that I
[1:17:44] am. And he knew with his perfect faith
[1:17:47] that he was the anointed Messiah. Now,
[1:17:50] you've got to know with your perfect
[1:17:51] faith that you are a true seed of God.
[1:17:54] You've got to know by your faith that
[1:17:56] you're not called to perish. You're
[1:17:58] called to live eternally.
[1:18:00] I'm looking at you today, people that's
[1:18:02] going to spend eternity with me. I'm
[1:18:04] looking not at a church believer. I'm
[1:18:06] not looking at just a message claimer.
[1:18:08] I'm looking at people that's deeprooted
[1:18:10] in the fact that we going to spend
[1:18:12] eternity together. We come from God. We
[1:18:15] going back to God. Amen. It is written
[1:18:18] of me. Didn't David the Psalmist and the
[1:18:20] prophets and all them speak of him? I'm
[1:18:21] the bread of life. I am that I am. And
[1:18:24] he knew that he was the anointed
[1:18:25] Messiah. That the spirit of God was upon
[1:18:28] him. He said, "Now I in myself do
[1:18:30] nothing, but it's my faith in God and
[1:18:33] God was in him. The word made manifest."
[1:18:36] We always worried about the right
[1:18:37] interpretations. Well, he's got an
[1:18:39] interpretation or she got an
[1:18:40] interpretation. But brother Brandham
[1:18:41] said the right interpretation is the
[1:18:44] manifestation. So it's what God is
[1:18:46] manifesting. You are the manifestation
[1:18:49] of the interpretation. You are the seed
[1:18:52] life of God on the face of the earth.
[1:18:54] And the world cannot hold you down.
[1:18:58] Impossible. You are the very life of God
[1:19:00] today. If I'm looking for God today, am
[1:19:03] I going to look in the sky or am I going
[1:19:05] to look at
[1:19:07] you? God immoria. That he could choose
[1:19:10] your body to come down and dwell in and
[1:19:12] represent him in
[1:19:14] eternity. Oh my. Some of you looking at
[1:19:17] me like, I don't know whether I don't
[1:19:19] know for sure whether I have that kind
[1:19:20] of faith or not. Yes, you do. Is all you
[1:19:22] got to do is let go and let God. Brother
[1:19:24] Ben said the key to the baptism of the
[1:19:27] Holy Ghost is to let go and let God. And
[1:19:30] when you let go and let God, that little
[1:19:32] seed life will burst forth and all of a
[1:19:34] sudden you'll say, "I am that I am."
[1:19:38] Praise be to God. Amen. You don't even
[1:19:40] come in, you don't come in Jesus name
[1:19:43] alone. But I am that I am. I am an
[1:19:46] adopted, manifested son of God. I can
[1:19:48] write my name on the checkbook and claim
[1:19:50] it. Claim my family. Yes, you can claim
[1:19:53] your family. Because this promise is
[1:19:55] unto you and to your children and to
[1:19:58] many as far off as the Lord our God
[1:20:00] shall call. You take a hold of that in
[1:20:02] reality and claim it. Amen. And the
[1:20:05] devil shakes when he sees that you know
[1:20:08] who you are. It was a secret of who you
[1:20:11] was. If he had opened the lamb's book of
[1:20:13] life, Amen. and showed the devil who you
[1:20:16] was, he'd have tried to kill you before
[1:20:18] you even came alive. But he didn't know
[1:20:20] that you was the real true seed. He
[1:20:22] didn't know the power that you'd have in
[1:20:24] this generation in the midst of Leosa
[1:20:27] where it's a cold and neither hot nor
[1:20:29] cold but lukewarm. But he knew that out
[1:20:32] of that lukewarm condition there would
[1:20:33] be a seed of life as brother Brandham
[1:20:35] said just maybe a little mustard seed.
[1:20:38] Amen. As Jesus represented the kingdom
[1:20:40] of heaven is a little mustard seed. But
[1:20:42] one day when that life amen hits that
[1:20:45] mustard seed what is it in? It's in the
[1:20:49] condition of faith and it breaks forth
[1:20:51] or something takes place. So bride, it's
[1:20:54] a privilege to be able to walk in this
[1:20:56] life with such a mighty manifestation of
[1:20:58] God in flesh again. Amen. And I wasn't
[1:21:01] in the Garden of Eden as far as being an
[1:21:04] Adam or Eve, but I I'm really I'd rather
[1:21:07] be here on the earth today being able to
[1:21:09] manifest his
[1:21:10] attributes because really to the devil
[1:21:13] really he got one pulled over on him
[1:21:16] because the Garden of Eden though he
[1:21:17] thought he had overcame bringing forth a
[1:21:20] life but the thing of it is he could not
[1:21:22] make them lives
[1:21:24] eternal but the seed in the soul was
[1:21:26] eternal but he was trying to impersonate
[1:21:29] what the tree of life could bring forth.
[1:21:31] forth and bring it in such a way to
[1:21:33] where that it had to come through the
[1:21:34] the union of a man and woman and through
[1:21:37] the the way that the tree of knowledge
[1:21:38] of good and evil would bring it. But he
[1:21:41] could not produce you as a true son of
[1:21:44] God. And he knew that would have eternal
[1:21:46] life, but he couldn't have eternal life.
[1:21:48] An angel to come and try to save and to
[1:21:50] take the whole world. And today, you
[1:21:52] know why it's so bad out there? This is
[1:21:54] Satan's Eden. But while he's got a
[1:21:57] Satan's Eden, we got a heavenly Eden
[1:22:00] that we've already connected with. I
[1:22:03] already feel the presence of that new
[1:22:06] heaven and new earth. I already am
[1:22:09] represented at the marriage supper of
[1:22:10] the lamb. Thousand-year millennial
[1:22:13] reign. I'm already represented there. I
[1:22:15] can feel the pull of it tonight. I can
[1:22:17] feel the reality of it tonight. It's not
[1:22:20] a dream to me. It's something that is
[1:22:22] substance. It's present tense faith.
[1:22:26] Jesus never preached a funeral. I told
[1:22:30] him something happens to me. I'm getting
[1:22:31] a little older. I said, "Don't have a
[1:22:33] funeral. You just have a Hallelujah."
[1:22:36] Amen. Time because I'm not dead. I
[1:22:40] cannot
[1:22:41] die. Amen. I'm just on the other side in
[1:22:43] that theophony. And I know that they're
[1:22:46] in service tonight. I told him the other
[1:22:48] day in service, I said, "Well, it's good
[1:22:50] to be uh hooked up with this one and
[1:22:52] that one, Puerto Rico and Costa Rica." I
[1:22:54] said, 'But mainly we're hooked up to
[1:22:56] heaven. And in heaven, as it is in the
[1:22:58] earth, in heaven, they're rejoicing.
[1:23:01] They're in this service tonight shouting
[1:23:03] and saying, "Come on, do you come to
[1:23:05] perfection and bring forth the life of
[1:23:07] the person of Jesus Christ? We cannot
[1:23:09] come to be perfect either." But they're
[1:23:12] crying out, "Come on, keep on pressing.
[1:23:15] Come on, young people. Don't be floaters
[1:23:17] and be floating in and out of the world.
[1:23:19] Take a hold of the reality and drop into
[1:23:22] that word and let it be anchored into
[1:23:24] your heart forever and ever. And the
[1:23:26] more you hear it, the more it becomes
[1:23:28] real to
[1:23:29] you to the life of God is brought forth.
[1:23:32] What is the life that's in the seed?
[1:23:34] It's the Holy Ghost itself. And we
[1:23:37] sometime and I know raised in
[1:23:38] trinitarianism, I thought the the Holy
[1:23:41] Ghost was a third person in the Godhead.
[1:23:43] That there was three different people.
[1:23:45] God the Father, God the Son, God the
[1:23:47] Holy Ghost. I used to when I went to
[1:23:49] pray, I was confused. Now, do I pray to
[1:23:51] God the Father or God the Son or God the
[1:23:53] Holy Ghost? And then all of a sudden, I
[1:23:55] heard the prophecy these three are
[1:23:58] one. That God the Father, the same one
[1:24:02] was God the Son and the same one is God
[1:24:04] the Holy
[1:24:05] Ghost. And that's what confused him so
[1:24:08] with Jesus Christ. They thought he was
[1:24:11] just a good rabbi. And they would ask
[1:24:14] Jesus, even Philip said, "Lord, show us
[1:24:18] the father and it'll suffice us." And
[1:24:20] Jesus said to Philillip, "Have I been so
[1:24:22] long with you and you don't know me?" He
[1:24:24] was saying he was the father. But see
[1:24:27] how the the intellectual side tries to
[1:24:29] take and I don't know come up with some
[1:24:31] kind of a a puzzle of some kind that
[1:24:34] will never give you the right true
[1:24:35] revelation. So if God the father was God
[1:24:40] and God the son was God, what is the
[1:24:43] Holy
[1:24:44] Ghost? Because Mary was overshadowed by
[1:24:46] the Holy Ghost. Then the Holy Ghost has
[1:24:49] got to be God immoria in
[1:24:52] you. The very life of God living in you.
[1:24:56] If I would say I see the Holy Ghost in
[1:24:59] this building, you'd say, "Now wait just
[1:25:01] a minute." You close your eyes, said
[1:25:03] that's the third person in the godhead.
[1:25:06] I had a man to tell me one time a
[1:25:07] minister I'd kind of preached about the
[1:25:10] life of God being the Holy Ghost in the
[1:25:11] believer. And the man says, "Well, what
[1:25:14] am I going to do and say now?" He said,
[1:25:16] "What am I going to tell the people?" I
[1:25:18] said, "What's that?" He said, "Well, the
[1:25:21] cannot be the Holy Ghost itself." I
[1:25:24] said, "Well, the Holy Ghost is the life
[1:25:25] of
[1:25:26] God. It's the same life that you had in
[1:25:29] the beginning. The Holy Ghost is not
[1:25:31] 2,000 years old. The Holy Ghost eternal.
[1:25:33] The Holy Ghost is God itself. And in the
[1:25:35] beginning when we shouted for joy and we
[1:25:37] sang together, what was that? The life
[1:25:39] of God that was in us was the Holy Ghost
[1:25:42] life itself that represented us in
[1:25:44] eternity because it was the life of God.
[1:25:47] And like the prophet said, the Holy
[1:25:49] Ghost is the very life of God that's
[1:25:51] given to the
[1:25:52] believer. And so he said, "Well, no, the
[1:25:56] Holy Ghost is like uh" I said, "What is
[1:25:58] the Holy Ghost?" He said, 'Well, I said,
[1:26:01] is the problem of it is you got a
[1:26:02] trinitarian mentality with a profession
[1:26:06] that you believe the message and a
[1:26:08] trinitarian mentality. He scratched his
[1:26:10] head on that when he had on a shark suit
[1:26:13] and he was upset. But it really, you get
[1:26:15] to thinking about it when you limit God
[1:26:17] to the third person in the Godhead or
[1:26:19] something way off somewhere and don't
[1:26:22] realize it's the very life of God in
[1:26:24] you, you have limited God in your life.
[1:26:26] That's why you sit some time with a dis
[1:26:29] a distant thought is that you thought
[1:26:32] you had it figured out here. But all of
[1:26:34] a sudden, God comes in and reveals that
[1:26:37] the Holy Ghost is God's own life living
[1:26:40] in you. And if every fiber of your body
[1:26:42] is filled with that life, then you are
[1:26:44] the Holy Ghost on the earth manifested,
[1:26:47] walking around living. And every day, as
[1:26:50] brother Barrett and I was talking about
[1:26:51] the other day, every day that you live,
[1:26:53] the refilling of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:26:56] power of the word revealed. And when the
[1:26:58] word goes forth, the Holy Ghost in you
[1:27:01] is quickened. The Holy Ghost quickening
[1:27:04] the Holy Ghost and letting you know, not
[1:27:06] it's my brother, my sister, but it's me,
[1:27:08] Lord, that you're speaking to. I'm
[1:27:10] represented in you, Lord, in your word
[1:27:12] and everything that you do and
[1:27:13] everything that you speak. Because I am
[1:27:15] a true son, a born son, a fil son and
[1:27:18] daughter of
[1:27:19] God. Amen. Why? Because you are the
[1:27:22] representatives of God on the face of
[1:27:25] the earth today. I think it's so hard
[1:27:27] sometime to believe that we are the body
[1:27:29] that God chose. But the bride is the
[1:27:31] body that he chose to manifest himself
[1:27:34] in. And that body that he chose is not
[1:27:36] by your choosing. You did not choose me.
[1:27:38] God said, "I chose you and ordained you
[1:27:41] that you'd believe, receive, and
[1:27:44] manifest the reproduction of the very
[1:27:46] life of the blood cell of God itself."
[1:27:50] We the blood cell of God, the attribute
[1:27:52] of God. That's why in us is all the
[1:27:55] fullness of the Godhead bodily in the
[1:27:58] bride. Because you take a spoonful of
[1:28:01] ocean, brother Brandham explained, and
[1:28:03] you dip that spoonful of ocean,
[1:28:05] everything is in that ocean. That is
[1:28:07] ocean. You could say, "I have the
[1:28:10] ocean." Huh? Come on now. I have the
[1:28:13] ocean. And somebody say, "You're crazy.
[1:28:15] As big as the ocean is, you have I do."
[1:28:18] Every element that's in that ocean is in
[1:28:20] this spoon that I've got right here. And
[1:28:22] every element of the Holy Ghost itself
[1:28:25] is what is living in your life and
[1:28:28] predestinated to it before the
[1:28:29] foundation of the world. That is God's
[1:28:32] own life amorphia living in you, moving
[1:28:35] his being. So bride, I pray tonight we
[1:28:38] can realize who we are and realize the
[1:28:41] reality of
[1:28:43] God. Proverbs 8:27 said, "When he
[1:28:46] prepared the heavens, I was there. When
[1:28:50] he set a compass upon the face of the
[1:28:51] depth, when he established the clouds
[1:28:54] above, when he strengthened the
[1:28:56] fountains of the deep, I was there. When
[1:28:58] he gave to the sea the decree and the
[1:29:00] waters should not pass, he command in
[1:29:02] his commandment. When he appointed the
[1:29:04] foundation of the earth, then I was by
[1:29:06] him as one brought up with him. And I
[1:29:10] speak to you tonight as one who was
[1:29:15] there. I was there so I can speak to you
[1:29:20] personally at present tense. I was
[1:29:23] there. Look at look at uh God speaking
[1:29:26] to Job. Job, gird up now thy loins like
[1:29:29] a man. For I demand of thee an
[1:29:32] answer from thee. Where was thou when I
[1:29:36] laid the foundation of the earth,
[1:29:38] declared if thou has understanding? Who
[1:29:41] hath laid the measures thereof? If thou
[1:29:44] knowest, or who hath stretched the line
[1:29:46] upon it? Whereof are the found fountains
[1:29:50] foundations thereof fastened? Or who
[1:29:52] laid the cornerstone thereof? When the
[1:29:54] morning stars sang together and all the
[1:29:56] sons of God shouted for joy, I was
[1:29:59] there. You was there. How many believe
[1:30:01] you was there? Oh, look at that. Amen.
[1:30:03] No wonder we having such a wonderful
[1:30:05] time tonight. You was there. I was
[1:30:07] there. Amen. Or who shut up the seas and
[1:30:10] the doors when they break forth as if it
[1:30:12] had issued out the womb. When I made the
[1:30:14] cloud and the garments thereof, the
[1:30:16] thickness dry and the darkness and uh
[1:30:20] you was there as sons and daughters of
[1:30:21] God. So therefore I don't speak to you
[1:30:24] as somebody that is uh trying to
[1:30:27] understand. I speak to you as a
[1:30:29] eyewitness by experience that I was
[1:30:32] there before the foundation of the world
[1:30:34] and I'm here in this time element and
[1:30:36] the thank God that he chose me for this
[1:30:39] generation.
[1:30:41] I mean you say well I'd like to live to
[1:30:42] Noah's day because he's the same
[1:30:44] yesterday and forever. But we don't
[1:30:46] build an ark now. Is he the same
[1:30:48] yesterday and forever? Yes. But we're
[1:30:49] not building an ark. Why didn't God make
[1:30:51] us build another ark? Because you was in
[1:30:53] a different
[1:30:53] generation. You went all through the
[1:30:56] generations God did and he said, "I'm
[1:30:58] going to make them the generation that's
[1:31:00] going to bring forth of the person of
[1:31:02] the characteristic of God
[1:31:05] itself. That's why we are so happy
[1:31:08] today. We was born in the general. I
[1:31:10] could have been born in the Pentecostal
[1:31:11] age. I could have borne the age of
[1:31:14] salvation. And they're preaching
[1:31:15] salvation all over the world, but
[1:31:18] they're not preaching redemption because
[1:31:20] he's redeeming you back to what you was
[1:31:22] in the beginning. And there's a
[1:31:24] difference there. There's the real
[1:31:26] reproductive seed of the life of God is
[1:31:29] they you are represented in the age when
[1:31:31] he took us all the way back and hooked
[1:31:34] you into your theophony. And you just
[1:31:36] remember if I die tomorrow, I'm not
[1:31:39] dead. I'm in my theophony and I'm
[1:31:41] shouting with brother Brandham and those
[1:31:43] men of God that went up before him and
[1:31:45] those women of God that's on the other
[1:31:48] side and then I'm going to have receive
[1:31:51] a glorified body like I had in the
[1:31:53] beginning. Oh, it's so real. The prophet
[1:31:56] revealed the mysteries of God as it was
[1:31:59] revealed through the prophet and all the
[1:32:01] mysteries of God have been revealed.
[1:32:03] Amen. But you got to have faith in God.
[1:32:05] I had a quote. I think that if they
[1:32:07] could they might put this quote up. But
[1:32:08] did you get that quote? If you didn't,
[1:32:10] I'm going to read it. Oh, I think yeah,
[1:32:11] he's got it now. Now, you know, but
[1:32:14] you've got to use faith in God to make
[1:32:16] it work. So, you got your own
[1:32:18] resurrection inside of you.
[1:32:22] I mean, you know, you say, "Well, am I
[1:32:24] going to is there going to be a a cloud
[1:32:25] sweep over or some kind of a fog that's
[1:32:27] going to change me?" No. You got your
[1:32:29] resurrection in you right now. You've
[1:32:32] got your own resurrection inside of you.
[1:32:35] Your resurrection lays inside of you in
[1:32:37] your
[1:32:38] spirit. What spirit? The Holy Spirit.
[1:32:41] God's own life lays in you right now.
[1:32:45] Amen. It lays inside of you. Now, when
[1:32:47] Jesus died on the cross, his soul
[1:32:50] descended to hell, and he preached the
[1:32:52] souls that were in prison that repented
[1:32:55] not in the longsuffering days of Noah.
[1:32:58] But his body went to the grave, but
[1:33:01] before he died, he committed his spirits
[1:33:03] into the hands of
[1:33:05] God. Into thy hands I command my spirit.
[1:33:08] You see, his spirit went to God. His
[1:33:10] soul went to hell, but his body went to
[1:33:13] grave. But then on the third day, he
[1:33:16] came back. Amen. And he went back into
[1:33:22] the tomb and got his body. And then when
[1:33:26] he got his body, he went then up into
[1:33:29] the grave the the the realm of God and
[1:33:33] uh and picked up his
[1:33:35] spirit. See, the body, soul, and the
[1:33:37] spirit and the resurrection took place.
[1:33:40] And then when he come back to earth, he
[1:33:41] wasn't glorified yet with that glorified
[1:33:43] body. But then when he went back to the
[1:33:45] father was glorified, his body was then
[1:33:47] he come down and appeared to many. And
[1:33:50] then he walked through the
[1:33:51] walls. You mean that's the kind of body
[1:33:53] I'm going to have? We'll be traveling
[1:33:56] like a thought. Brother Paul, you won't
[1:33:58] have to worry about the planes no more.
[1:33:59] If God tells you to go to Liberia like a
[1:34:02] thought, you can be there to proclaim I
[1:34:04] am that I am is on the face of the earth
[1:34:06] today. Amen. I am that I am is here. I
[1:34:10] am that I am. Praise God. There's going
[1:34:12] to be a resurrection as sure as we're
[1:34:15] looking at each other today. There's
[1:34:17] going to be a rapture and a
[1:34:18] resurrection. And I know it's close at
[1:34:20] hand. It can't be much longer. So
[1:34:24] therefore, God, may he give us the great
[1:34:27] faith to be able to unite as one in this
[1:34:31] great promise of God, the blood cell of
[1:34:34] God's own life, the blood cell of his
[1:34:36] body. Amen. Represented in a Genesis 2.
[1:34:41] I I there's some things here I won't go
[1:34:43] into, but we know in the Garden of Eden
[1:34:45] it all is clear. Only two seed lines.
[1:34:48] I'll tell you when I heard serpent seed,
[1:34:50] the people turned their nose up at that,
[1:34:53] you know, but man, I was shouting. I
[1:34:55] said, "Praise God. I can see who I am
[1:34:58] and see who the devil is." I was so
[1:35:01] thrilled and so happy. People said,
[1:35:02] "Well, I don't know much about the
[1:35:03] serpent said. You don't know much about
[1:35:05] it." You need to know something about it
[1:35:07] and the depth of what it done. It
[1:35:08] revealed who you was and the seedline
[1:35:10] you come from. It showed you the
[1:35:12] seedline of the devil is
[1:35:14] weak. Amen. It is weak. The devil don't
[1:35:18] have any power over you. He might have
[1:35:21] power over the unbeliever, but the man
[1:35:23] in faith, you can look at the devil and
[1:35:25] say, "Satan, get behind me." You can
[1:35:27] look at the devil, it might have your
[1:35:29] family bound, say, "Satan, you get
[1:35:31] behind me." And brother Brandham said,
[1:35:33] "The pastor in the pullpit is
[1:35:35] commissioned to be over every spirit."
[1:35:38] And brother Brham said, "I take every
[1:35:40] spirit in this place under control." And
[1:35:42] we today have the power in the spirit
[1:35:43] over Satan. Anything he can produce or
[1:35:46] anything he can say, we got power over
[1:35:48] that. So may I just encourage you bride
[1:35:52] to recognize who you are. And if you
[1:35:55] ever recognize who you are, you'll never
[1:35:57] spend a day in depression. You'll never
[1:35:59] spend a day in question. You'll never
[1:36:02] spend another day at down in the dumps.
[1:36:04] But you'll rise to the occasion. Amen.
[1:36:07] And give him the glory for everything
[1:36:09] that he is to you. May God bless you.
[1:36:11] It's been a privilege speaking to you.
[1:36:13] Amen. We'll be in great prayer for your
[1:36:15] pastor as he's in Libya and also my
[1:36:17] son's fixing to go to
[1:36:19] Nigeria. So, we pray that God gives them
[1:36:21] a mighty time in the Lord and that they
[1:36:24] are able to preach eternal life because
[1:36:26] they are carrying the power to be able
[1:36:28] to impart eternal life to others. And
[1:36:30] Brother Brandham said, "We have the
[1:36:31] power to impart eternal life." The man
[1:36:34] out on the street there somewhere that
[1:36:36] God would lay on your heart to speak to.
[1:36:38] And you'll know if it's God because
[1:36:40] there'll be a hunger there. You're able
[1:36:42] to impart eternal life. How do I do
[1:36:44] that? Because you're able to get him to
[1:36:46] know really who he is. And if his name's
[1:36:48] on the Lamb's book of life, the proof of
[1:36:50] that will be his response. That is your
[1:36:53] proof that your name was on the Lamb's
[1:36:55] book of life because something inside of
[1:36:57] you said, "Amen." The Assembly of God
[1:37:00] might church might have been fasting and
[1:37:02] praying that you'd stay in their
[1:37:04] bondage, but that had nothing to do with
[1:37:06] me at all. I said, "I know. I've been
[1:37:08] eagle of God. I'm ready to fly and soar
[1:37:11] into heavenly places." And I've been
[1:37:12] soaring ever since then. Amen. I've
[1:37:15] never needed a chicken meal no more. As
[1:37:18] far as the chicken barnyard, I mean, I
[1:37:21] like chicken all right, you know, but
[1:37:22] still only good chickens to cook
[1:37:24] chicken.
[1:37:25] Oh, but there I'm telling you that but
[1:37:27] real eagle food. You rip off that food.
[1:37:30] You come to the house of God and when
[1:37:32] the word of God goes forth, you can't
[1:37:34] hardly wait for the church house doors
[1:37:36] to open. You can't hardly wait to hear
[1:37:38] the word of God read because you are the
[1:37:41] word manifesting the word in this
[1:37:43] generation. God bless you. We love and
[1:37:45] appreciate you. Amen. We pray that God
[1:37:48] continues to bless you all here. We want
[1:37:50] you to know we're not in competition
[1:37:52] with you, but we're in faith with you.
[1:37:55] We are one in Christ Jesus. May God
[1:37:57] continue to bless you with the great
[1:37:59] unveiling of the mighty God. Get deep in
[1:38:01] the word now. Don't be a floater, but be
[1:38:03] deep in the word of God. That's where
[1:38:05] you'll find your promises at. And every
[1:38:07] promise in the book is mine. Every
[1:38:10] comma, every period, the whole book is
[1:38:13] mine. It's a revelation to me and a
[1:38:15] heart to me. God bless you. Let's b our
[1:38:18] heads for a moment of prayer. If you'd
[1:38:19] stand.
[1:38:22] Father, what a privilege to be with your
[1:38:24] people today. Amen. It wasn't God above
[1:38:29] us or God with us in this service. It
[1:38:33] was God in us. Lord, we thank you for
[1:38:37] the opportunity to be able to speak to
[1:38:39] your seed of life, Father. And to be
[1:38:42] able to claim it, Lord, and to be able
[1:38:44] to anoint it with faith that we might be
[1:38:47] able to see who that we are and
[1:38:49] recognize the hour that we're living in.
[1:38:51] Father, we're not in the Pentecostal age
[1:38:53] no more. We're in produced fast that
[1:38:55] went to through justification,
[1:38:57] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:38:59] Ghost. But we're in the very
[1:39:01] person of the life of reproduction.
[1:39:03] Lord, reproducing what we was in the
[1:39:06] beginning that's going to change us from
[1:39:09] mortality to immortality. Father, we
[1:39:12] thank you for this people and their
[1:39:13] precious pastor. Lord, may you continue
[1:39:15] to bless them. May the windows of heaven
[1:39:18] be opened at all times.
[1:39:20] May there be a a safety zone that we can
[1:39:23] find with all the threats of the atomic
[1:39:26] bombs and the wars and everything going
[1:39:28] on, Lord. But we find a safety zone in
[1:39:31] you. Cuz there's only one place that
[1:39:34] we're safe, and that's in your anointed
[1:39:36] presence, Lord. We commit ourselves into
[1:39:39] that presence. May you help us, Lord, if
[1:39:42] there be one here tonight that maybe is
[1:39:44] blinded. Brother Vandom said that the
[1:39:46] clogs are blocked up. They can't really
[1:39:49] feel that flow of the genuiness of the
[1:39:52] Holy Spirit flowing out of them, Lord.
[1:39:54] They've been blocked up by the world or
[1:39:57] maybe not knowing who they really are.
[1:39:59] Especially young people, Lord, that have
[1:40:01] problems sometime finding what they
[1:40:03] really are, but not this group, Lord.
[1:40:06] They have found out that they have an
[1:40:08] eternal
[1:40:09] representation. Be with them, I pray,
[1:40:11] Father, your lovely name. We ask him to
[1:40:13] be with your precious pastor, Lord, as
[1:40:15] he travels. May there be a meeting
[1:40:18] that's already sitting, waiting, Lord.
[1:40:20] And that the hunger of the people would
[1:40:22] be there, Lord. Because if there's a
[1:40:25] hunger and a thirst, they shall be
[1:40:26] filled. We commit ourselves into your
[1:40:29] hands in Jesus name. Amen. And amen.
[1:40:39] Oh my. Praise the
[1:40:41] Lord. Amen. We enjoy that word.
[1:40:47] Amen. Let's sing that.
[1:40:50] Arise and
[1:40:53] shine. Thy
[1:40:57] light has
[1:41:00] come and the
[1:41:03] glory of the
[1:41:08] Lord. Risen upon thee. Risen upon thee.
[1:41:17] Shalom.
[1:41:19] Shalom. Peace and good morning. Peace
[1:41:22] and good
[1:41:24] morning. He is on the throne.

[1:41:48] Shalom. Peace and good
[1:41:51] morning. He's on the throne.
[1:41:57] Shalom.
[1:42:01] Shalom. We are
[1:42:05] almost. Let's take one
[1:42:10] verse. Shalom.
[1:42:13] Shalom.
[1:42:17] Shalom. Peace and good
[1:42:21] morning. He's on the throne.
[1:42:27] Shalom.
[1:42:29] [Music]
[1:42:31] Shalom. We are
[1:42:34] [Music]
[1:42:36] almost
[1:42:37] Amen. We are almost home. It won't be
[1:42:41] long. Just any day now, we'll be we'll
[1:42:45] be out of here. I'm so glad for the word
[1:42:48] of the Lord that we heard tonight. Did
[1:42:50] you enjoy
[1:42:52] that? Amen. Let's give the Lord another
[1:42:54] hand of praise.
[1:42:57] Amen.
[1:42:59] Yes. Oh my. Satan is trying to attack
[1:43:02] our our bodies, but I uh the Lord has
[1:43:05] already touched me and I'm healed. I
[1:43:08] claim I'm just an eagle. up is going to
[1:43:10] fly up a little bit higher into my
[1:43:12] healing tonight. Amen. And brother
[1:43:15] Musgrove opened right in Galatians
[1:43:17] chapter 3, our scripture that we read
[1:43:19] this morning. And uh he said, "I'm going
[1:43:22] to call you bride." I think he took off,
[1:43:25] but it's in the first seal. I had that
[1:43:26] in my notes there, paragraph 151. He
[1:43:29] said, "I'm going to call you
[1:43:31] bride." Amen. I've been called a lot of
[1:43:33] things, but I'm so glad to be called the
[1:43:36] bride. Amen.
[1:43:38] And so we're not just church members,
[1:43:41] we're
[1:43:42] believers in this word of life that
[1:43:45] changes us. And we look forward to that
[1:43:48] great resurrection and the rapture of
[1:43:51] his church portion of the word of God
[1:43:54] tonight was the breeding of that tonight
[1:43:58] that we can become in his image, flesh
[1:44:02] of his flesh, bone of his bone, life of
[1:44:05] his life. Amen. You enjoy that? Amen.
[1:44:09] God bless you richly. Amen. We'll sing
[1:44:12] one more. Let's see. I really want to
[1:44:14] sing that, but I can't. I don't have the
[1:44:17] voice for it or the words, but uh let's
[1:44:20] go to the Lord in prayer. Brother Nathan
[1:44:23] Bar come and dismiss us in a word of
[1:44:26] prayer. Sorry. Um yes, come forward.
[1:44:29] Brother Nathaniel, did you pray already?
[1:44:33] They didn't have you pray. Okay.
[1:44:36] So good to have you. God bless
[1:44:39] you. Amen. How many appreciates the word
[1:44:42] of the Lord? Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:45] Praise God. There's no clock in this
[1:44:47] church. Amen.
[1:44:48] [Laughter]
[1:44:50] So, and this uh P the platform here is
[1:44:53] very very comfortable. So, I was getting
[1:44:57] with Sister Sharon. I think she here's a
[1:44:59] clock here. So, uh we we don't we don't
[1:45:02] uh have an alibi just yet, I guess. Uh,
[1:45:05] but I was kidding with her. She wanted
[1:45:07] to make sure that there the platform was
[1:45:09] too hard. You may be seated just for a
[1:45:10] second. It was too hard originally and
[1:45:13] uh they added some cushion on it so the
[1:45:15] preacher would be comfortable and and uh
[1:45:17] could have a an extended time. Amen. So,
[1:45:20] it's good to be here with everyone uh
[1:45:22] this evening. And I just kind of by
[1:45:24] surprise found out that Brother Muskov
[1:45:26] was was preaching. So, we were kind of
[1:45:28] on our way home from San Carlos this
[1:45:30] morning and I uh said, "Well, I guess
[1:45:32] I'm not coming home now." So, I just
[1:45:34] made a detour. So, I was very happy uh
[1:45:37] to be here and hear him. How many
[1:45:38] enjoyed that? Amen. Praise the Lord. And
[1:45:42] so, don't just be a floater. Amen. Get
[1:45:44] into the deep things of God, you know,
[1:45:45] and realize that I'm not just a
[1:45:47] Christian saved by grace. I'm a son of
[1:45:48] God that's been redeemed back to where I
[1:45:51] was supposed to be before the foundation
[1:45:53] of the world. Amen. And so, we had a
[1:45:56] wonderful time in San Carlos uh over the
[1:45:58] weekend. I didn't make Friday night, but
[1:46:00] I was there last night and this morning.
[1:46:02] And the Lord gave a little thought last
[1:46:04] night on uh the voice of the blood in
[1:46:08] the third exodus. Amen. Knowing that
[1:46:11] that just as the first Exodus, they came
[1:46:13] out in that Exodus under a lamb. Amen.
[1:46:16] Under the shed blood of a lamb. And
[1:46:18] there they were, the household, every
[1:46:19] one of them was set in order. And that's
[1:46:22] that's that's what we have today. Amen.
[1:46:24] It's not just a loose message, but we're
[1:46:26] being set in order. we're being
[1:46:27] positionally placed so we know who who
[1:46:30] we are, what our position is in Christ.
[1:46:32] Amen. And so this is not just a general
[1:46:35] evangelistic message. This is a message
[1:46:37] of redemption. Amen. And the voice of
[1:46:40] the blood is speaking resurrection to
[1:46:43] you. It's speaking redemption to you.
[1:46:45] And think about that. In the first
[1:46:46] Exodus, they were they came out under
[1:46:48] the blood of that lamb. Amen. And so
[1:46:51] they they were every house eating the
[1:46:54] lamb. Hallelujah. And we know you are
[1:46:56] what you eat. Amen. And so they were
[1:46:58] eating the lamb when the evidence that
[1:47:00] they were eating the lamb with the blood
[1:47:02] was on the door. And they came out in
[1:47:04] that Exodus under that blood. And in
[1:47:06] this in this hour were coming out under
[1:47:08] the blood of the lamb slain from before
[1:47:10] the foundation of the world. Amen. And I
[1:47:14] just want to give a little just kind of
[1:47:15] a little illustration. There were
[1:47:17] several testimonies and one brother
[1:47:18] said, "I had an awakening last night."
[1:47:20] Amen. So that's what it's all about.
[1:47:22] Amen. and being awakened to our position
[1:47:24] being being again just climbing a little
[1:47:27] higher each and every service each and
[1:47:28] every day moving higher and higher
[1:47:32] faster and faster. The next thing you
[1:47:33] know we're traveling like a thud. Amen.
[1:47:36] And so just speaking uh just to kind of
[1:47:38] uh reiterate what brother Musco was
[1:47:39] saying. I won't be very much longer but
[1:47:41] I like what he said. There's this two
[1:47:43] spirits. Amen. There's the Holy Ghost
[1:47:45] and the unholy ghost. Amen. Which one
[1:47:48] are which one are you tonight? Amen. So,
[1:47:51] uh, my wife gave me a little something
[1:47:52] that she had read and I was going to
[1:47:54] read it last night, but I I, uh, I
[1:47:57] forgot about it, but how many has heard
[1:47:58] of Thomas Edison? Amen. So, you know, in
[1:48:01] the natural, he did all all kinds of
[1:48:03] things. He was, you know, ate from the
[1:48:05] tree of life and was very successful,
[1:48:06] but I don't know if this is true or not,
[1:48:08] but I thought it was very prevalent, you
[1:48:11] know, to to uh, whose report are you
[1:48:13] going to believe? And so when he was a
[1:48:15] young man, the story goes that he came
[1:48:17] home from school, the teacher gave him a
[1:48:20] letter and it said, "Don't show this to
[1:48:22] anybody but your mother." And uh as the
[1:48:25] mother opened it up, she would she began
[1:48:27] reading it and would just began crying
[1:48:29] and crying. And young Thomas Edison
[1:48:32] said, "Mommy, mommy, what does it
[1:48:34] say?" And the mother, you know, she
[1:48:36] said, "Honey, the teacher says that you
[1:48:39] are a genius and we don't have the
[1:48:41] ability to teach you." And so to go home
[1:48:44] and have your mother teach
[1:48:45] you. And so there of course you know
[1:48:48] Thomas Edison grew up he became the
[1:48:50] famous inventor and so on and so forth
[1:48:51] all these accomplishments. And there
[1:48:53] when he was getting older in age uh he
[1:48:56] happened to be going through some of his
[1:48:57] old old things you know reminiscing and
[1:48:59] he came across an old keepsake from his
[1:49:02] mother. And there in the corner was an
[1:49:04] old crumpled up letter. And he happened
[1:49:06] to open it up and for the first time in
[1:49:07] his life, he read that original letter.
[1:49:10] And to his surprise, it actually said,
[1:49:12] "Miss
[1:49:14] Edison, your son is is incapable of
[1:49:17] learning. He's he's practically
[1:49:18] handicapped. He's deaf. There's there's
[1:49:20] nothing that we can do for him. Just uh,
[1:49:23] you know, teach him yourself because we
[1:49:25] can't do anything for him." Amen. And
[1:49:27] so, who whose report are you going to
[1:49:28] believe tonight? Amen. Are you going to
[1:49:30] believe what the blood says about you?
[1:49:32] what the present tense word of God is
[1:49:34] speaking to you or are you going to
[1:49:35] believe what's out what's out here in
[1:49:37] this world? Amen. So, let's rise up in
[1:49:39] faith. Let's go from here rejoicing with
[1:49:42] a with a new freshness of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:44] in our life with a a rekindling of the
[1:49:47] unity of the faith and move forward.
[1:49:49] Amen. Marching with arms together as one
[1:49:53] body in Christ Jesus. Is that is that
[1:49:54] your desire? Amen. So, let's bow our
[1:49:56] heads for a word of prayer. Our heavenly
[1:49:59] father, Lord, we're so thankful for your
[1:50:01] mercy, oh God. Thank you, Father, that
[1:50:03] you've called us to this great glorious
[1:50:04] hour, Lord, knowing that there's nothing
[1:50:06] that we can say or do, Father, but it's
[1:50:09] your grace, Lord, through and through,
[1:50:10] Father. And Lord, may we go from here,
[1:50:13] Father, a new people, Lord, with a
[1:50:14] renewed faith, Father, an awakening of
[1:50:16] to the reality of what you have called
[1:50:18] us to, Lord. And continue to climb up,
[1:50:21] Father, higher, higher and higher, Lord,
[1:50:23] into the depths of God. And Lord, may
[1:50:25] you continue to pull us, Lord, as your
[1:50:27] little lambs pull us into your bosom,
[1:50:29] Father. Give us strength, Lord. May we
[1:50:31] find that specific portion of the word,
[1:50:33] Lord, that would bring to us such a
[1:50:35] reality, Lord, of who we are in you and
[1:50:37] who you have made us, Father. That we
[1:50:39] can be unshakable in our faith. That we
[1:50:41] can be unmovable, Father. Lord, in this
[1:50:43] hour, Lord. Father, at this beloved
[1:50:46] church, Lord, we pray you'll continue to
[1:50:47] bless them, Lord. Bless all the
[1:50:49] officers, all the uh everything that's
[1:50:51] coming or going, Lord. May they
[1:50:53] continue, Lord. May you visit them in
[1:50:54] the night season, Lord, with fresh
[1:50:56] revelations of the Holy Ghost, Lord,
[1:50:58] outpourings of your word as never
[1:51:00] before, Father. Lord, as brother Israel
[1:51:03] is to be going overseas, Father, may you
[1:51:05] strengthen him. May the pillar of fire
[1:51:07] go before him. May you heal his body,
[1:51:09] Father. And Lord, may you prepare the
[1:51:11] hearts of the people, Lord. May he
[1:51:12] impart eternal life to them, Lord.
[1:51:15] Father, we thank you for all things. We
[1:51:17] commit the service into your hands. In
[1:51:18] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[1:51:20] pray. Amen and amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:51:23] God bless you. Bless you. Amen. God
[1:51:26] bless you richly. Let's give the Lord a
[1:51:28] hand of praise and stand. And I'm
[1:51:30] pressing on the upward way. New heights
[1:51:33] I'm gaining every day. I'm pressing
[1:51:37] on the upward
[1:51:40] way. Oh, new heights I'm
[1:51:44] gaining each and every day.
