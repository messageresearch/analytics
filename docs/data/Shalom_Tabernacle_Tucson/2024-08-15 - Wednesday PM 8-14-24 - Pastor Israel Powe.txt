your presence now father just bless us we pray bless every heart we pray Lord we commit our ways to you now Lord forgive us of all of our sins and shortcomings right now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and we thank you amen amen God bless each of you we're so happy to be in the house of the Lord with you this evening welcome you to the house of the Lord uh thank you Saints for coming out and appreciate brother Joe for the services over the weekend and I trust it was a blessing to you amen the seven seal amen where else you going to get that there's only one place you're going to get that that's from the voice of God it come from Heaven amen that's not authored by a man or group of people but that light came from heaven and so we're so glad to be a part of that and part of the work of the Lord in this last days we' like to go right into the word in Ephesians chapter 6 6 verse number 18 St John Chapter 13 just before we go to prayer and I really want to go and take some time to go into prayer thank you I need a little more thank you to go into prayer tonight to get into the spirit of prayer as we gather together in his name and um there's a time to read there's a time to study there's a Time time to meditate but there's also a time to pray and I would like for us to get into and sometimes they all go together and but we really like to get into the spirit of prayer I'm watch my time here tonight and I trust that the Lord Jesus will bless us everyone amen and so in Ephesians chapter 6 verse number 18 says this praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints I'll take that one more time praying always now we know this is the Christian armor we've been talking about put on the whole armor of God it says praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplications for all the saints amen St John 13 3 4 and 35 our lord Jesus speaking he says when you have that you can say Amen a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another amen may God add a blessing to the reading of his word I bless you may be seated we'll take a a moment and um just so happy to see all of your fine Faces tonight it's good to see you we don't know when it's our last time to come together but it's always good good to see uh sister Bethany and Edward making it back amen and so God bless each of you uh brother bam took a little Message Church order sis uh 1958 I'm going to read a couple places that out of there and just to remind us on a few things on a Prayer meeting just to encourage our heart he takes this message Church order 1958 and as he's laying out the order and the direction of how we should approach the Lord we've been through it many times he says this I think is paragraph 21 in that church order 1958 this is a software version so I don't know if that number is the same you have there he says I think that yes I think first that every member or every worshipper of the brandom Tabernacle should be so much in Divine love with each other until it would their hearts would long for each other when they have to go away to leave each other at the service at night I am a True Believer in Divine love the Apostle Paul said that that was the evidence of the Holy Spirit by this manner all men will know you are my disciples said Jesus when you have love one for the other and we believe that it's the love of God that sent Jesus Christ to the Earth to die for us all God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but would have everlasting life and the everlasting life here is God's own life because we become Sons and Daughters of God by the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is the Seed of Abraham and gives us the faith that Abraham had when he believed God before he was even circumcised you know this is um this is a a statement that we all know and we've heard it many times John 133 5 by this shall all men know that you are my disciples when you have love one for another and so the spirit as brother random identified it in what house will you build me the spirit of this city Tucson he said I can't think of any place more spiritually dead than the City of Tucson then he talked about the fighting amongst the churches the members the congregations and then so if we just put that aside just for a moment the churches but just just let's focus that to just this little church you know we should have love for every member in this little Tabernacle and if there's anything that we have anything that's contrary that's bothering us between someone we want to get that out of our spirit we just don't want it in our mind we don't want it in our spirit we don't want any funny feeling towards anyone and here brother bam is laying that out to this Divine love that every member should have for one another our care Our concern our love for one another and so that Divine love is is a Divine love for every word of course we know that as a believer we have to love the word of God Amen but it's not just for every word it's for every believer every member and it's even for the Sinner and I think if we can focus our divine love towards everyone you know we have things that we have to get accomplished as we work together we we we we we you know I was listening to brother Dalton's testimony brother Jim Dalton his given us testimony how brother Randon was talking to a brother about those Tall Pine trees that grow so straight and he talked about how he warned that brother to never get off alone to yourself stay in Fellowship because those trees are straight because as they're growing they bump against one another and that straighten that keeps us straight and so it's not that we you know we all need to be bumped huh is that right or wrong we all need a bump every now and and that's what Fellowship is and that's what Godly love for one another is is I want to see the best come out of you you want to see the best come out of me we're on the same team I love you you love me I want you to prosper on every level in your life and I don't want any kind of funny anything towards any family member you know this little group is pulling a sign and that little group has this agenda and this one we can't talk to that one and that one can't speak to this one you just don't want that so we're just reminding one another to love one another this is how Jesus know that you're my disciples when we have love one for another and of course we want to love the word we want to love the sinner but we want to love one another too think of the people that's sitting in this the little families that are associated with this little church and let's move in that direction and so that's what I would like our prayer to be focused on tonight one of the points that I wanted to bring is the unity of the spirit the unity in this little Tabernacle for divine love first now we want the Lord Jesus to show himself in Greater measure in healings and spiritual happenings and the anointing coming in our services this is something that we desire Paul told us to and let's take the scripture in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 just for a moment so I'm going to put this this is a bulletin board for our prayer tonight these points please don't forget them just take these few little notes in your mind about being love in the unity and then Desiring we have not because we ask not many times in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse 31 says this but covet earnestly that means to desire earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way look at verse uh 1 Corinthians 14 ver1 follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesy we want to see we thank the Lord for the healings that we have seen but we want to see those healings increase and I believe that you know the saints that are sick and they're weak and they're Afflicted God has touched them many many times but we want more of that we want to see it happening we want it to raise in our midst we want to see the power of God God and I believe the True Church of the Living God we're not asking for something that's not in his word that is in the word I want a double portion of his anointing I want this church to have a double portion I want the signs wonders and miracles that Jesus said would accompany his church to accompany my Ministry my prayer life and I believe that that should be our prayer tonight as a group of Believers that the holy spirit will answer our prayer requests when we bring them it's very deliberate we're we're not shooting in the dark it's a scriptural prayer desire spiritual gifts the Bible says that and this is in the word amen and so that our healings would increase that the salvation would increase we want to see souls coming to the kingdom you say well brother Israel you know we're in a gleaning time all of all of the you know the great miracles of of of missionary works are beyond our Shores but God is still a savior and our attitude he never told us to stop fishing I mean we're not catching a lot but he never said stop casting the net and when your love is right then your witnessing will be right you view that Center that one you come across in wherever you're traveling you'll start to view them as maybe it could be a seed of God starts with that love for the sinner love for one another love for the word of God Amen our healings would increase our Salvation would increase and then this this is another one that is scriptural I'll read it for you in the message there we want to pray that God would give us greater Revelation and this is on the heels of this tremendous message that we heard on Sunday how many know the seven seal that's a tremendous word of the Lord that was that's it's it's Rich it's very deep it's very heavy there's something for everyone but I don't think it's something that like Revelation is like something well I'm going to listen to the tape I'll listen to the pastor and if it sticks it'll stick to me well that's not the attitude that brother Adam gives us in this quote here I'm going to read for you just for a moment this is in the message um the indictment paragraph 265 1963 the indictment the prophet says now what did they do they didn't know it today men walk ignorantly they don't know that that's the truth they think it's some kind of a ISM they don't dig down deep enough to get into the spirit of Revelation they don't pray enough they don't call upon God enough you know Revelation means so much to us that it's not just a happen stance it's something that we can actually pray for Lord open up my understanding on a level that has never been open before I'm sitting under the greatest Ministry that the world has ever known it's here God gave us that much now Lord open my eyes so I can see what the prophet is saying and just a little crumb just a piece of it just a a table Spoonful a a cup full Lord open up my heart um for divine re Revelation and this revelation God opening up our understanding and revelation is going to is going to help us in our maturity and this is big a big problem a lot of Christians they don't they we're Believers True Believers but they they're they still bicker and complain and trip over the same baby items that we should be maturing over and that's a revelation issue if God is revealing his word to you then that Mellows you out it gives you depth it gives you the ability to work with other people who are immature acting like a baby you know babies start acting like a baby and then we start all acting like bab we all fighting because he started and that one started it who's the adult in the room well the man that has the Revelation the woman that has the Revelation they're the adult in the room the Revelation comes from the word so he said Lord give me a revelation so what so I can argue no so I can change my beh Behavior so that I can mature under this seven seal anointing that I can become a seed of God that's um ready or or or or or or maturing in that atmosphere for the Rapture and so Lord increase our love for one another increase our love for the word increase our love for The Sinner and increase my my revelation of this word every one of us needs a deeper Revelation in his word amen he said well you know I was on this trip here I had a wonderful trip maybe I'll tell you more about it on Sunday the Lord willing but one of me and one of the brothers we were talking and when he first came into the message there was an old Deacon brother that had all the red volumes and me and this Brother Tyrone we were talking about how excited we were when we came to the message and how we were trying to build our library we were just Reminiscing on that and he said one of the deacons told him uh he had all the red volumes sitting on his wall in his study there and the Deacon told him he says Brother Tyrone you can have all of those books because I read them already and I thought that was hilar I was like are you kidding me so you read it already so now you can give it away that that's not the purpose of your seal book or the church age book or any message is that you can get through reading it and then you can pass it on to someone else no you have to internalize it you have to read it again you have to let it soak let it let it let it uh settle in into your heart let God open up another layer to you another level to you and that's a prayer that we can pray now brother bandom tells Us in the message trying to do God a service without being his will in 1965 paragraph 259 and he says this here he says there won't be any denomination just remember brother Jack here is a historian many of you here are there there's never been a Revival about three years after the Revival they started a denomination on it is that right and this last great miracle move of God in this last days it went 20 years and it's a million miles from a denomination going further away all the time the Shucks pulling away no cooperation no nothing with it always it pulls away from it there can't be no more it's a wheat now but we're plenty green uh-huh that's right have to lay in the presence of the sun to be mellowed up that's all of it plenty green we haven't got the sincerity the sacredness the thing we ought to have in our midst showing us to things yet now he says this at the at the end of his ministry this is November of 1965 he makes these statements that we are plenty green we don't have the sacredness or the sincerity this is what he's telling the people that's following the message all right so his ministry is coming all the way up God's getting ready to take him off the scam in just a few days from there around Christmas time and he's making these statements he continues on in the morning message the next day and God's provided place of worship paragraph number 40 look at what he says here and it's just really beautiful to hear it and then put yourself into this time frame he he says I believe the church is beginning to hear the message and begin to understand but friends listen we've got to lay in the presence of the sun we've got to be ripened our faith isn't ripe intellectually we're hearing the message that God has given us and seeing the signs that he showed us and proving it by the Bible it's there but oh how the church needs to lay in his presence till it tenders up you know and gets sweet in the spirit so that it can bathe down sometimes in speaking the message you got to get harsh you have to break it in like that because you got to clinch a nail to make it hold but when the church once gets it the elected is called out and separated then in the presence of God I know it'll be something like the people was there when it takes its Rapture so brother banam is now identifying to the church world to the people uh did you all get that it was 65 you got it he's identifying to the church world to the message Believers followers November 65 that you are beginning to hear the message but you got to lay in the presence of the son to get ripened now I want to be more mature than I've ever been as a Believer I don't want to be so easily upset and teed off from this world's challenges or challenges Believers I believe that you know God's given us a tremendous work a tremendous word and and it's time for us to move on to move on not just to quote battle with someone else a quote and your quote and my quote against you but no I'm talking about maturing in the presence of the Lord and that comes by divine revelation you can't make yourself see anything God make me see God you can't make yourself see anything if you see anything it's because of God's grace but you can sure pray pray for God to open up your understanding when the word is coming forth so that you can leave from the presence of the Lord a better Christian than what you was than the last time you heard the seven seal amen and he says now the church God's only provided play place of worship this is my last quote the church re teach you now but remember when you leave here start moving out of the Shu now you're going into the grain but lay in the presence of the sun don't add what I've said don't take away what I've said because I speak the truth as far as I know it as the father has given to me see don't to come seek the Lord Jesus that's what we're telling you tonight and then you yourselves lay right in his presence just make love to him oh Lord Jesus Son of God I love you tender My Heart Lord take away all the filth and the love of the world let me live holy in this present world before you don't you like that that's coming down to the close of his message there he's telling it's very simple you fall in love with Jesus and he is the word and in falling in love with him you fall in love with his people it's very simple it's difficult to do many times and but we have these little attitudes and these little immature ways about us that the Holy Spirit needs to bake all of that out of us and I don't want to have an attitude toward towards any a bad attitudes towards any other human being on this planet not in this city not in this church not on this planet I want my heart free from all man free from any um evil gu or thinking and that comes as the Holy Spirit as I fall in love with him as I worship Him I seek the Lord and I lay myself right in his presence to make love to him oh Lord Jesus Son of God I love you tender My Heart Lord take away all the filth and the love of the world and let me live holy in this present world before you now we have spoke on that coming church that brother R talks about with ananas and Safar and how no sin will enter that church and as I really look into that towards myself and you know that no sin would enter into me when he's talking about the church he's talking about people he's talking about people he's talking about individuals that no sin would enter me as an individual that I would make it right before I came here to the house of the Lord that's what I want to increase that's what I'm asking God to increase now so that Divine love and a second thing that we can focus on praying is for Wisdom James 1 15-6 says this about wisdom I just have one I think those was my last scripture here we just take James chapter 1 and verse five if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and abrath not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed how many of you here can use more wisdom you know wisdom and Revelation are the same because the foolish version and the wise version the wise version had oil in her lap the wise version had a true Revelation so this Revelation and God giving you wisdom how to handle the word let's just take that one discipline of not adding or not taking away that is a discipline and it's easy for us to make the story to fit our point to add a little bit of juice to the story if we're trying to make our point but it but a real True Believer a true Minister a true sister or brother that that is preaching the word or speaking the word you don't need to add anything not to none of the Visions not to none of the word and you don't need to take anything away from it don't hold that back don't say that they they can't take take it you took it um you don't add you don't take away and this is this is his word that that that God gives this discipline for the Believers that they don't add they don't take away and this is what brother random says there in that last message that we read for you there is not to add not to take away you just say what I said amen yes are there some things that cause controversy of course they're all through your Bible but the discipline is the maturity is just to say what he said I don't have a message I don't have to make it sound more interesting I don't have to make it sound less interest I don't have to do any I just have to say what it says and that's where the power of God is right there is when you don't add to it you don't take away from it and then you give everybody a chance to hear it just like he said it many people they have formed an opinion over many of the visions of the Prophet because of the ministers that they have listened to but you need to go get those tapes for yourself listen to those visions that brother Adam gave in November of 65 and then you tell me that you can stand before God and say he didn't mean what he said or you want to add an interpretation to it no no no no brothers no my sister you say what it says and God will bless it that's where the blessing is is when we keep it right there and so let's do that and then finally so those are two spiritual things the Divine love love for one another Lord increase our love increase the gifts of the Spirit the healings signs wonders Miracles your presence give us wisdom Lord and then we have some natural things that we need to we need a church building and God has one for us and um can't nobody take that from what God gave you can't nobody take it from you but you have to believe that and you have to have faith in that and you have to be willing to declare it before you see it right if his commandment is that we have to be gathered in his name I like that point John's always brings that up the Commandment is that we should Gather in his name but he ain't going to provide a place to gather no he provides a place to gather just like he provides everything else and you know there's folks here they're at the crossroads in their careers and they're looking for a place to settle themselves for jobs careers for school and so forth and we need to pray for that that is something that we place in the it's a carnal thing it's a natural thing but you want to place that in the hands of the Lord you don't want to go online and compare what everybody else says a good job is but you want the holy SP Spirit to provide you a job and it will be the right job how many can say Amen to that how many's ever taken a job that it wasn't the right job but when God gives you a job and he he's able to do that but you have to ask him he's able to give you the direction that you need you must ask him and those are the carnal things career job want to pray for our musicians our deacons our chur trustees the administration those that handle every aspect of the church and the orders of the thereof pray for that do that there's three things the Divine love wisdom of God and administration in these carnal things in our life and I believe God will do that amen we'll search our hearts and we'll see if there's something developing in our mind towards someone towards some group say Lord take that out of me no I want to have perfect I want to have pure love for every man every woman I want my I want my thoughts and my attitud my thoughts to be positive towards everyone and keep me Lord in the place that you've called me to be that's what I want that's my prayer little things develop all the time people meeting one another after service jacking them up um if it was in a playground it'd be a fist fight but it's we're so spiritual we ain't going to swing on you but we do it spiritually we got attitude we need to get let that go we need to let the Holy Spirit give us love for every member on every Pew not just the nice ones that are like you amen Am I Wrong Am I Wrong no I'm I'm that's a prayer for me towards anyone Lord Jesus my love for the brothers my love for the other churches my love for the Saints my love for every member first my love for you which is the word and then that goes to the brothers and then that goes to the sinner Lord I need that and that's a revelation that you have to give me I can't make myself more mature but the wisdom of God coming down will give me that and I believe we can pray I just pointed out the scriptures to you so they're scriptural for us to ask for that amen amen God bless you we'll take a few prayer requests here that we have and brother good friend of mine sister Judy's mother uh sister hope Luna she's passed away she was 98 years old she was like like your mom s and you sister at least they always she always dance in the spirit little lightweight sister she danc they have a video of her dancing for the Lord all of her life and she's going on to get her reward that's coming up in August the end of August so pray for that household sister Judy and Pat mothers passed on sister Lucille McCoy mother Lucille needs a touch from the Lord she's in the hospital there um brother Doug the gentleman Doug
