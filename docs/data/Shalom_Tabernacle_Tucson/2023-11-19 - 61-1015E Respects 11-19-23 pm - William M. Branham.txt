Lord tonight we're going to listen to the message respect X starting from paragraph number 44 to paragraph 26 and then uh once again I wanted to say thank you sister Aaron and for and all of the teams put together for making sure that everything went smoothly um me and my wife were kind of nervous that Joe was going to be gone and you gone but it worked out just great amen so if you have a chance to thank her and sister uh Barbara and sister um Elisa sister Alisa opened her home at the end of the services to some of the visiting pastors there we certainly appreciate that amen so thank you brother Chris he said amen and I'm sure you all thank them good to see you brother will I know you have a birthday coming up but this this message here really struck my heart I was listening to it yesterday and I want to turn into it paragraph number 191 if the sister can get it there I'm going to move this my care over yellow one here and uh brother brandom I don't generally read a quote from the message we're listening to sometimes I'll read afterwards but this really stood out to me from this message as I was listening to it and I'll tell you why um message respects paragraph 191 just to show you how easy we could speak things that we shouldn't speak I was in The Minister's meeting earlier this year or or just a few months ago actually and um one of the brothers had these were pastors that we were speaking together and one of the brothers had brought up brother Coleman if you all know brother Joseph Coleman he um started a a movement with it's called the seven Thunders and they're still in a group of Brethren that follow what he teaches and they they look to him as what they call a chief a chief Apostle and he was an apostle he established churches and so forth and whether we agree or disagree with him that's another another thing but his name came up and the brother said cuz he knew brother Coleman he says well what brother Coleman is preaching is nothing but a bunch of emotions and I was just sitting there and I I kind of semi agreed with it I didn't agree with it I just kind of heard what he had to say and I but I want you to listen to this quote or hear the or read this quote and we'll hear it just now brother B says when we receive the Holy Ghost is not shaking hands with the pastor receiving the Holy Ghost is receiving Christ into you because he is God's messenger of the day the Holy Ghost is God's messenger and we must respect him when he comes don't say he he he look at that woman shouting there and crying crying tears running down her cheeks look at that man there shaking his hands and trembling and crying you know what that is that's a bunch of worked up emotion you're blaspheming the Holy Ghost You' got to respect that and so it just happen so easily just in common conversation and like I say I was with pastors and the brother specifically said that he said that's just a bunch of worked up emotion and you just got to be careful with that I mean you might not agree with the brothers or pastors or whoever but don't you say stuff against people shaking or rolling or whatever they're doing and they call it the Holy Ghost just leave it alone serve the Lord with all of your heart because you don't want to be guilty you don't know the Holy Spirit Works in all of those groups all of them yes Jehovah Witnesses Baptist he works amongst all of them because he's got a bride that he's calling out and we don't know who those people are so this this message just really struck me like whoa I need to be more respectful towards everyone my wife my children the ministry the groups I agree with and the ones I disagree with okay amen so let's stand to our feet and we'll go right into this message paragraph number 44 through 26 brother Bram will be reading from the scripture Psalms 105 and Ecclesiastes chapter 12 if you want to have your Bible ready let's sing only believe only believe only believe all things are possible only really only be ho [Music] believe all things are possible oh can we make a confession let's lift our hand Lord I believe and Lord I believe Lord I believe that all things are possible oh Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I God bless you you may be seated brother Grand now I don't expect to talk very long tonight maybe 30 minutes or 40 upon a little subject here that I would like to first read a scripture found in the book of Psalms Psalms 105 and reading down to the 15th verse inclusive while I read this Psalm I want you to listen real close to the reading of the word because God's word will never fail oh give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people I just think of that give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the People Sing unto him sing Psalms unto him talk ye of his wondrous work glory in His holy name let the hearts of them that Rejoice that seek the Lord seek the Lord and his strength seek his faith everm more remember His Marvelous works that he has done his wonders and his Judgment of his mouth oh ye Seed of Abraham his servant ye children of Jacob his chosen he is the Lord Our God his judgments are in all the Earth he has remembered his Covenant forever the word which he commanded to a thousand Generations which Covenant he made with Abraham and his oath unto Isaac and confirm the same unto Jacob for a law and to Israel for an Everlasting Covenant saying unto thee will I give give the land of Canaan the lot of your inheritance when they that when when they were but a few men in number yay very few and strangers in it when they went forth from one nation to another and from one Kingdom to another he suffered no man to do them wrong Hallelujah yay he prove Kings for their sake saying touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm Hallelujah I want to take a a subject from there of respects reading here David crying out to the Lord respects is what we owe to God and that's one thing that I would like like to uh drill this to the heart of every person here tonight that in all things that we see going on we must give respect to it we must respect it and David said that when there were very few men of Israel perhaps Abraham Isaac and Jacob who is speaking on very few men that he rebuked Nations and kings KS for them God rebuked the Nations and Kings saying touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm over in Ecclesiastes the 12th chapter and the 13th verse it's written like this see let us Shar the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the full duty of man the conclusion of the whole matter is to fear God and when you cannot have respect un until you have fear you've got to have fear of God Solomon said also in the Proverbs that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom amen the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom now that don't mean that you're afraid of him but that means that you're giving him respects and reverence and when you respect God you fear God you fear that you might displease him in some way you fear L you would do something wrong you wouldn't want to I fear my mother I fear my my wife I fear my church I fear all of God's servants unless I should put a stumming box somewhere in their way I I fear the people I fear the people of the city unless I should do something wrong that would cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian see you've got before you can have respect you've got to have fear here and God demands it he demands respect God does he demands it and fear brings it and we know that fear brings respects now you take for instance a man he's a farmer or maybe he's a a shop worker and uh nobody pays any attention to him but let him get a job on the police force and come down the street as a a policeman with his badge and uniform on or maybe someone wouldn't speak to him the day before hello there John how are you see why is it it's kind of an awe our fear our respect because of it maybe he gets elected to be the mayor of the city or maybe who would President Kennedy tonight be if he wasn't President Kennedy what if he was just a same man he is but yet he was a worker worked at col Gates down here for uh $40 a week see he'd come through the city here and nobody would pay much attention to him on his own Associates but being he's a president of the United States he deserves a respect you see and that and because that God is God he deserves a respect that's right Hallelujah and he we've got to respect him and give a fear to him and that brings respect God has demanded that for himself and for all his servants God demands respect for his servants he uh his servants how we know that they're his servants because he vindicates these servants by his word he takes these servants and makes them Servants of God and proves that they are servants by making his word work through them servants then as you respect that servant you respect God so when I respect you and you respect me and we respect each other then we're respecting God did not Jesus say in so much as you have done at the least of these my little ones you have done it unto me and it would be better for you that a millstone was hanged at your neck and you were drowned in the depths of sea than to offend one of them where I say you behold their FA Angels always beholds my father's face which is in heaven now we know that they are that we being children of God that we are a part of God and God demands this respect then God shows who his children are he he shows it by wonders and signs and that it's being done now now we're going to start now and call into question some of these people now if I was going to say for one to start with I think of of let's take Noah for a moment now Noah had a revelation from God yet it was contrary to anything that science would prove to be true but yet he had spoke to God and God had spoke to him and he went about preparing an ark where the scoffers and mockers as the Bible says said that they would be in the last days like it was in them days that those scoffers scoffed at Noah while they thought that he was out of his head because he was building an ark so but God brought judgment upon them scoffers because they would not listen to the messenger of God and come into that Ark under his preaching then God sent his Divine judgments on the Earth first he made a preparation for all who would receive it to escape it and then if they did not Escape it there's only one thing left if they won't take God's preparation of Escape then there's only one thing left that's Divine judgment amen you can only do two things it lays either Mercy or judgment you have to accept one of the other that's where we stand tonight we either take God's mercy or we stand his judgment there's just no way of getting around it God always makes a way of Escape for those who desire to escape then he's got what's left over has to stand the Judgment not because that God wants them to but because they have chosen that way themselves see they make their own choice that's where we stand tonight friends the same thing we can either take God's way of Escape or we can stand his judgments either one we want to do aren't you happy tonight that you have tucked the way of Escape amen because all that refus the way of Escape will have to come under judgment then there is another man I'd like to speak of that was a great Mighty Prophet by the name of Moses the People Israel should have understood according to the scripture that God was going to deliver them and was going to bring them out of Egypt but as soon as God got his man ready and sent him down into Egypt they had no respect for him they turned him out and said will you slay us as you did the Egyptian which caused them to stay in bondage uh extra 40 years they stayed in bondage because they refus to respect the deliverer that come to deliver them that put them back in bondage again not because God wanted to stay the time was exactly right but they stayed 40 years over because they refuse to accept God's provided way of Escape how I believe that that's what's the matter tonight same thing see that they refused the way out and God was determined and had told Abraham and them in his Covenant as we read David singing of it tonight he had promised them that he was going to do a certain thing so God's going to keep his promise he was going to bring him out anyhow but perhaps nearly another generation died off the old generation laughed at Moses and so forth and would not accept the message that generation 40 years died off and Moses come into another generation see what I mean if they don't accept it then God will let that generation die out and he'll bring in another generation to do it amen so they had refused it and then we find out this next Generation to come up when Moses went down there to vindicate himself you know Moses was scared to go down again Moses is 80 years old now and he had been gone 40 years and when he talked to God at the burning bush he said who will I tell them that sent me God had no name he said who will I tell them that sent me so I say the god of your fathers appear to me they'll say who is the god of our fathers well what do I tell him he said you tell them that I am that I am you tell them that I am that I am all that and he said what is that in your hand Moses he said it's thick and he threw it down and turned into a serpent and put his hand in his bosom and turned to leers and went back and healed he said go down and take these signs and perform them before the people and it'll be an a Vindication they'll know by these signs that I sent you for deliverance amen oh brother Hallelujah God always does that God always gives Supernatural signs amen see and now when he came down and called the people and done his signs before them all Israel believe every one of them and they went right straight to the Palace the for deliverance and then the Pharaoh decided he would not give him deliverance and God turned judgment loose on pharaoh and we know what happened in Egypt strange after they had seen all those signs happen and then they come to the Red Sea and found out that the very God that performed all those signs here at the Red Sea doubted God the very first thing that he was able to make a way of Escape now there's where we make our mistakes when a little sickness strikes us when a little disaster a little trouble strike somewhere in a way then we go to Falling Away a young convert somebody will make fun of and say well you ain't nothing but a Holy Roller well I hate to be called a holy Ro you see see there you are you get that doubt that's the time to stand there amen that's the time to respect the messenger that's the time to to give glory to God hallelujah and Moses said I've done these already 10 Miracles before you God's G you 10 Miracles and then you're afraid of the see certainly how much more would it take for you to believe Hallelujah he walked back and stuck his rod and held it before the Sea and the storms came down and blow across the other other side and they went across and as soon as they got over there immediately be to complain they had no bread just same thing then God Ran bread out of heavens for then they complained they had no water and just one complain after another and I noticed you say well maybe they were the unconverted type well maybe they were there was a mix multitude went with them truth but I want to bring another thing into your uh into your remembrance if God sent the messenger and Vindicated by the signs that he was a messenger sent from God then it's up to them to obey this messenger amen exactly they must obey the messenger all right and have respects to that messenger look at Joshua and Caleb they stayed right by his side amen yes sir whatever Moses in they was in it too whether mes right or wrong they stay right with him anyhow see because they know that was God's message messenger and there one day we find out that even Mariam a prophet and Aaron the high priest made fun of moses' wife because she was an Ethiopian and thought was there enough women of our own group to marry instead of going down there and marrying that woman that wasn't Moses choice that was God's choice for Moses amen and when they made fun of it that anged God in such a way until he struck maram the prophecies full of leprosy Moses own sister what about that her a Propet but what was she doing she was making fun in irreverence to God's messenger amen the messenger of the Covenant of that day and she was irreverent and also Aaron the high priest the very mouth he of Moses yeah right he was with her and Aaron then when he saw his sister struck with Leprosy he went in and told Moses would you let your own sister die and Moses went into the Tabernacle and fell before the Lord and begin to weep call out for God Mercy for his sister and the spirit of the Lord came down and said call Aaron and maram to stand here before me oh my Hallelujah God demands respect God sends his message you listen to it you reverence it don't care if they call it a bunch of holy rulers or whatever they call it let the world do what they want to but you give respects amen so there stood Mariam God said call Mariam and call mooses call Aaron here your brother and sister to stand before me and when they come in before God God said don't you fear God said that to the high priest and to maram the prophet said if there be any A man among you spiritual or prophets I the Lord will make myself known to him I'll speak to him in Visions reveal myself and dreams to him and so forth if he's spiritual or private but said my servant Moses I speak lip to ear with him amen said don't you fear God in other words you talk about Moses you're talking about me if you can't respect Moses you don't respect me said Haven I proved among you that he's my servant Hallelujah and you have no reverence for him at all what that would be a lesson for the people of this day oh amen no respect no har now he said because you didn't do that that's the reason you got leprosy that's the reason these things is went said because you ought to know that this is my servant you do know it amen So when you say something against him you're saying it against me amen so Moses prayed for her life to be spared and God did spare her life she didn't live very long afterwards she died but she did get cleansed of her lepers and is out of the camp for seven days you know for for having for a purification get herself uh cleaned again from her leprosy God healed but what he was trying to get to them is this you've got to respect what I do amen and if that was the attitude of God in that day and God can't change God wants us to respect what he's doing yes he demands itah said you either respect that or something else is going to happen amen a man told me the other day he said I poor man sweeps up over here here in the market for a living he's had a breakdown in very bad shape he's Lutheran by faith and they had communion he's too a unable to walk to the church so he tuck a cab said it cost him 80 cents to go down 80 cents to come back his neighbor very ungodly seen him pray in the Lord's Prayer one morning laughed at he made fun of him he said to this neighbor he said to this man he said where'd you go on a cab this morning said it was communion I went out to the church he said what is communion said when we take the bread and the wine he said I had mine too this morning at the table with a slice of light bread a pine of whiskey I know of three boys one time that mock communion in the church Noah them and they went up in a hotel room and got some ham sandwiches and um bottle of whiskey and had their communion up there making fun of the communion they had in a Pentecostal Church less than three months from then all three was two one of them was dead and two was in the insane institution you can't disrespect God you've got to respect God if you don't believe it just keep still keep away from it or either do that or come reverently and respect it don't make fun of people in the spirit don't talk about people that's worshiping in the spirit of God let them alone I was standing right there on the corner preaching some years ago as a boy preacher and there was a woman came by she's Catholic of faithful I know her her husband is Catholic she was nothing and a very handsome Pretty Woman nice looking about 20 years old 22 I knew her as a girl here in the city and she came by and stood there and she said I wouldn't let my pet cow have the religion at William Brandon's got and the next night before I could get to her her she was dying in the hospital don't know yet what killed her she was dying out there in the hospital and her husband came to get me he said he was a Catholic and he come and said come quickly and say a prayer for my wife she's been calling for you all evening she's dying well I said I will go and I got in the car and left the meeting and started to the hospital and I run up on the steps I met the nurse and she said she's already dead and he said come say a prayer for her anyhow I said she's dead said say a prayer I won't do any good now said well come look at her and I went down she had a that reddish black I could be called arban hair very pretty woman few freckles across her face here with a great big brown eyes and that woman that nurse said Billy she died in such Agony until she screamed out your name as L as she could incept telling you forgive me till the freckles stood out on her face like warts and those big eyes and set way out and her eyelids are half closed over of course you know what happens when a person dies there both kidney and bowels move and she was lar just steaming all over and died in such Agony because not because she disrespected me but she disrespected the gospel that I was preaching that God was working signs and wonders some time ago in new ay while I was standing there talking to a sinner leading him to Christ a big old ru-h handed man in a garage a man was a friend of mine his son-in-law run the Gars next door I was standing there preaching at a dinner hour eating a sandwich and talking to him about God through the daytime I'd find somewhere where i' go at dinner time and try to win his soul to Christ he said Mr Brandon he said just a boy preacher myself he said Mr Brandon said my mother had that kind of religion that heartfelt religion and the tears was running down his cheeks I said how long she been gone said years she always prayed for me I said the god that heard her prayers is trying to answer him right now for her and this man walked in there he said ell is drunk said hey Billy listen said anytime you want to come over my garage said you've come but said don't bring that old Holy Roller religion of yours over there I turned and looked at him I said anywhere Christ is not welcome I'll not be and so he turned around and said oh get next to yourself boy now I just heard in my heart of voice say you reap what you sow it'll be better you that a millstone was hanged at your neck and drowned in the depths of sea and his own son-in-law that very same afternoon run over him with a two ton Chet truck loaded down mashed you down in the ground see you got to respect God you got to do you God demands respects and he demands it and so maram ought to know better so art Mo art Aaron to know better then knowing this that Moses was led by the spirit of God to do what he he was going to do baptist Minister wrote me a letter a couple days ago up here oh if he didn't rate to go he said a guy that's as lazy as you are a Ministry that would be equal to the El of the prophets he said and then to see you sat around home doing nothing so Billy is acting the secretary at the time he wrote him a letter that and then he thought well I believe I'll just answer him he said but he thought he better let me read before he answered it but it had a lot of diplomacy in it he said now this is not my dad this is me said you just said that uh Daddy had a Ministry like that of Elijah and said you said he sat out on a creek bank somewhere with a fishing pole and his hand her up in the mountain with a rifle and he say said what would you say about Elisha when he set three years by the side of the brook said don't you know that they're led by the spirit of God to do what they're doing amen see everybody wants to run it their own way but man must be led by the spirit of God and we must give it respect that's all you're other day a precious Soul you're in the city seen another brother he said where's bill at he said he's gone up in Canada he said I guess going to hunt and he said yes he's going to hunt oh nonsense to such stuff all right that man not knowing that I was under the power of the Holy Spirit by a vision of thus said the Lord to go hallelujah what would you do at the day of the Judgment what good would it do to me go to the bedside of that man and pray for me the first place he doesn't believe me and people when they come around and say these things like I don't know it they don't believe it though they pat you on the back and call you brother yet you know they don't believe it see they don't believe it and you can have not one thing you can do for them they'll call for you to come pray but it doesn't do any good cuz you see they disrespected you got to believe it watch those you really believe and watch what happen you've got to respected Jezebel in the Days of Elijah how she disrespected Elijah how she Elijah was actually her pastor sure oh she wouldn't receive that goodness no she was a she was a atheist or Infidel Idol worshipper and she had her own Pagan priest but yet Elijah was her pastor God standing there to be Pastor he was pastor with if he did Bor her out and tell her all of her sins yet he was her pastor she wouldn't receive it at all but and she disrespected him she hated him sure she did what happened to her God let the dogs eat her in the street am that's right because what she disrespected the message amen amen that Elijah was preaching God demands respects you got to have it you ever get anything from God you go to respect God and you must do it from your heart the bottom of your heart you must do it but she disrespected God as she disrespected his Prophet now she know Elijah was a prophet they didn't have anything in Israel could keep up with Elijah while his visions and everything was perfect before God and he but he condemned them Mercy yes he on every denomination everything else and everything is called sin he condemned it from the least to the greatest amen King and all he didn't pull any punches for none of them all right but they had to know he was a prophet they just couldn't keep from knowing that yes sir even Ahab tried to accuse him for the drought and he did pray God to send the drought yes he did and he said I have power and our close of Heaven it'll not even rain or do won't fall to I call could you imagine that little jezz that painted up face stomping up down that floor that old hypocrite that old hypocrite causing all these little children out here to suffer and all like that Elijah was trying to bring him back to God trying to win a nation back to God see and look like she could tell the people and you mean to tell me you'd believe on a man like that that would close the lands up like this and not even rain or do and all this hypocrisy or his witchcraft out there whatever she want to C and he's nothing but just a a witch or sus or something he's closed the heavens and a want rain making all these people suffer and you say then that's the will of God it was the will of God Amen no matter what see you must look at what you must respect God regardless of what he does he knows what he's doing did look bad children suffering people suffering cattle dying sheep dying no water nowhere the nights was hot and sulty the sun was as brightest brass in the skies to the daytime for 3 years and 6 months Elijah s up on the mountain said not even do a fall will I call from oh how they hated him and when he they had found him he said you're the one that's troubling Israel are you old Elijah looked back in his face said nay not me but you're the one that's troubling Israel that's right see even Ahab didn't have respect for him you know what Elijah told Ahab said because you shed the innocent blood of nebot so the dogs will lick your blood too in the street and they did amen because they disrespected God's messenger exactly right they disrespected it now Mariam disrespected it Aaron disrespected it no matter who you are Christian are not Christian you've got to still bring respect to God and respect what he's doing or suffer the consequence it's either receive it or going into judgment either one you want to how I can stand with testimony for hour after hour of what I've seen in my lifetime what I've seen in the other countries and other parts of the Nations and so forth the things that's taking place but to Omit that just so that you'll get the the idea of what I'm trying to say to you you must respect it I've seen young people sit in the meeting and snigger and life in a meeting and less some 24 hours be crushed into the streets oh I've seen young people sat in a meeting in one year when I was in a place and next maybe within 6 months go back to the same place and practically every one of them was gone or landay stricken somewhere with diseases and things that's right you have to respect it I remember a certain young girl one night Tennessee and I was going out the door preaching in a big Baptist Church I was going out the door I felt led that night to call her to come to Christ well she laughed in my face when I called her to come come to Christ she had to be one of the deacons daughters and stand at the door that night she waited for me and I come out she said I want you to know something right now don't you never embarrass me like that again I said God was calling you she said nonsense I'm young so I got plenty of time for that said my Daddy's got enough religion for all of us at home I said not enough for you sister everyone has to have their own religion she said if I want anybody to talk to me about that I'll get somebody that's got some sense not somebody like you I said go say what you wish you you don't bother me but someday you'll regret it not long after that passed through the same city here she come down the street with her unders skirts hanging down slopping with a cigarette in her hand and offered me a drink of whiskey same thing here's her testimony she said you remember the night you called that said that was the truth she said the spirit of God was testifying to me that night trying to get me to come and said since then I could see my mother's Soul frying hell like a pancake and laugh at it that's what happened see you've got to respect God all you got to do it brother that's all Jezebel disrespected it and remember another time there's some ear River children they had been raised up in a home Elijah after his days of course the people hated him because he call that famine in the Land There were some people that taught their children that Elijah a man like that been translated taken into heaven he got killed somewhere and they just bearded him and hit him they didn't believe it so Elisha took his place now he was a messenger the day now after Elijah had been taken up so he passed down to a certain city and the children Little Children of that City run out making fun of him said say you old ballhead why didn't you go up like Elijah did see they didn't believe Elijah went up there it is it wasn't a disrespecting the man it was disrespecting his message he was the successor to Elijah to Elijah he had the anointing the spirit of Elijah was up on him he went up there and done the very same things that Elijah did all right hallelujah amen Jesus said he that bre on me the works that I do shall he do also amlu these signs shall follow them they disrespected it and they disrespected Elijah because he believed in elishah because the spirit was upon him and he turned around and smoked the jarden with his man and opened up the jarden went up and done the same kind of Miracles that Elijah did and even all the preachers up at the school the prophet said the spirit of Elijah rest is up on Elijah Hallelujah no abroad in the country and the people are bet the L look that bunch of Holy Rollers fanatic saying that man went to heaven without dying horses come down we didn't see any certainly they didn't certainly not they didn't we didn't see any horses we didn't you hear any chariots anywhere nonsense the old fell died and they buried him and then they trying to make a lot of uh too over just like they say today the same thing like they said about Jesus they said while they come and stole his body at night time they even paid soldiers to testify that but he raised from the dead and Elijah was tuck up in a chair of fire with horses of fire this young Prophet walking along there going down through the city and he lost his hair as a young man he was going down so these little children run behind him said hey hey why didn't you goow up with Elijah said you old Baldhead you see and they were given disrespect and what did Elijah do he turned in the power of the spirit and cursed those children what happened two sheep bears come from the woods and kill 42 of them right disrespects irreverence you can't do that you've got to respect God if they had have kids and said now if their father and mother said now look children they say that Elijah was taken up now we don't know about that but anyhow I I I don't know whether it's so or not but I tell you the best thing to do is just don't say nothing about it just go ahead when he passes we hear he's coming down through the city today go to have a street meeting up there if he does if you children on the road to school today me you say how do you do Reverend how do you do sir or something like that speak to him but instead of that no doubt they've been told at home oh I heard Papa and Mama set at the table and laugh and one other saying what do you know they said that old holy Rover was taking up you ever believe anything like that and they say this a little baldheaded fell this is baldheaded is a pumpkin up there ain't over about 35 years old and here he's coming down through there day you go to whole street you expect us to believe such nonsense as that why isn't nothing but a little just a a mockery that's all it is because he won't come to our churches he's just like Elijah was he won't come to our churches we he'll probably some kind of a witchcraft whoo hopes that he's got like Elijah they didn't believe him so the little children was taught that at home yes if they've been taught reverence and respect that have walked out there before that prophet of God and ask for prayer for themselves but they had been taught to snigger and laugh and to make fun about like the children of today more too many of them today would make fun at a street meeting they would make fun at the preaching of the Gospel so Elijah cursed them in the name of the Lord not because of the children but because of the irreverent parents that have brought the children up that way to disrespect God two sheep bears come out and kill 42 of them now it's irreverence God demands respect when they disrespected his Prophet they disrespected him no matter how much they didn't believe they ought kept their mouth shut stay away from it but no they had to put in their nickels worth they had to say something that they ought not have said and what happened to him let's take some people who did respect it let's take the shunamite woman to the same Prophet Elijah she was actually not an Israelite she was some shuna but she believed in God and she seen this man pass through the town heard him speak she's seen the signs that he done it's told in history I don't know where it's true or not that one day a bunch of wild dogs was trying to catch a little girl now this isn't scripture it's just a story that I read and said this shunamite woman was standing on the corner and she saw that these dogs was going to kill this little girl and this holy man was passing through town and he raised up his staff to God and cried out for Mercy for them little children like that and the dogs turned and went away from them was it was store not sounds like it could be I don't know but anyhow this woman said when the Bible when she perceived that this was a holy man she perceived something had happened she seen what he was and perceived that he was a holy man from God and instead of disrespecting him like Jezebel did she respected him she said to her husband we are well able to do this I pray thee let's build him a little house out here somewhere let's give him a little place far he's weary I watch him he's getting old and I noticed his gray hair is hung down in his beard his little old staff his little skinny arms as he walked along the little flabby arms like that and here he come walking along packing a little Cru of oil on his side with a piece of sheep skin wrapped around him and the hot sun is by looks scared and red and uh I pray thee let's make him a little station to stop here let's get the contractor and come out here and build him a little place and put him up because I perceive that his Spirit by his Spirit he's a holy man he's a man what a difference now her husband agreed she he said darling I have no that man too I've listened at him I've watched him I've seen his works I know he's the holy man of God so we'll just do that so they called the contractor and build him a nice little place and put him a little bed there to rest so he can lay down and rest fixed him a place to wash his feet and got some water and things and fixed it in there and when the prophet came by of course i' blessed his soul to see that something had been done for him he said to G said go call her and asked her what could I do for her could I speak to the king to the chief chap he she said I dwell among my people and there's nothing I have eat of but Gesa said she has no children and her husband is well in age he's old they have no children and I imagine Elijah laying on this little bed that she had blessed him by making had his feet all washed and his beards all washed out and thing laying there no doubt but what he seen the vision of the Lord because they always did that so said go call her and tell her to stand here before me oh Hallelujah go call her because she has she's respected God go tell her to come here when she stood in the door he said thus sayith the Lord about this time next year year you'll bear a baby and about that time next year she had the baby then Satan when he got to be about 12 years old his father had him out in the field one day and Satan said I'll get rid of that child so he just give him a sun stroke and he died in his mother's arms did that discourage her no sir she said sad mu and go forward don't stop go up to Mount Carmel to the mountain because he just passed through here of the day there you are that's respect that's respect face and her husband said you're going to the man of God said it's neither new moon or Sabbath he won't be up there and she said all will be well just saddle them you and let me go on and so away they went and they got up into the mountain and when oh Elijah looked out of the cave and he' come out there and looked at he said this looks like that shunamite woman coming said she must be grieved he said go meet her and when he said she's grieved in her heart and God's never told me nothing about it see God don't have to tell you everything see so he don't even tell his prophet profs everything he just he just does what he wants to do he's God now Elijah said God what if Elijah said this why didn't you tell me why she's coming why did you tell me all about it you never seen a thing but he was all right with Elijah whatever it was and what if she have come up and said she' say you said you was a servant of God you hypocrite I do believe you ain't nothing but a Holy Roller it'll never happen see God tries us sometimes see what we'll do so instead of that she run right up to his feet and worship like she was to God and she said and she revealed to him what was the matter and Elijah said take my staff and go lay it on the child and when he did the woman said as the Lord God liveth in your soul never die hallah thou servant of God I'll not leave you I'm going to stay here to God sends the vision amen oh I just stayed there a little while longer gted up his loins and Tuck his staff and here he went he went into the room where that baby was was laying a dead baby walked up and down the floor like that a few times because of a reverent woman a woman that respect him a man that respected him leave him to be a man of God he walked back and forth up and down the floor until God answered amen then he laid himself up on the baby in his s seven times and picked it up and give it to the mother walked on out back up to the cave went because she respected the man of God Amen what about Martha was always thinking about fixing Jesus a good dinner Mary wanted to hear the word of God so she just sat around listening at him she didn't care where the Piller cases was changed or where the the curtains was dusted or where they had anything to eat or not she just wanted to hear what Jesus would go to say but Martha always wanted to cook him a good dinner and be sure that the chair was made soft and it was set just right and everything was cleaned up like that but she wanted to do something for Jesus in her way Mary wanted to do it in her way but one day when Lazareth come many people talk against Martha said she ought been more interested Oh no just a moment see there come a time for Martha to show hers and then when Jesus when Lazarus died her brother she sent for him to come pray for him he did not come he ignored the call he went on somewhere else she sent again and still ignored the call but when finally he comes seen like now that she could have walked out to him and said why didn't you come why didn't you come when I called you my brother was laying there sick we've left our church we left our organization we done everything to follow your message because we did believe that you were a man of God but how could a man of God and we two orphan three orphan children here three orphan people and our livelihood was making tapestries for that Temple we was members there our mother and fathers was members there but because that you hop just into a thing that believe in this what you're trying to teach saying that you're a son of God our Prophet sent from God and these things how can we ever believe you a man that wouldn't even listen to me when I call for you when I was in need and had need of you you ignored my message and went on and I sent again and you still ignored it why did you do a thing like that if she'd have done that the story would have been different tonight oh amen what did she do she run right streight to where he was fell down at his feet and said Lord if thou would have been here my brother would not have died oh there you are what was she doing she was respecting she was in the presence of God and she respected she called him her Lord Lord if thou would have been here now that I sent for you that was all forgotten now you're here see if you would have been here my brother would have G out have died he said thy brother shall rise again oh she said yes Lord I know he'll raise again in the last day and um and he said uh she he said but I am the resurrection and life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die I believe Lord that thou art the Son of God that was to come into the world and even now Lord even now not Lord you are to done this you are to done that but even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you what if we could say that to someone tonight oh my brother I believe that what you ask God God gives it to you the same results would come but no matter how much he was see if he was and we know he was a Son of God if she had disrespected it it would never work that was from her heart she said even now whatever you asked God God will give it to you that's it that's it from her heart she believed it if you had took a hunting trip or a fishing trip that would have been no difference to her no if Elijah had went on a hunting trip or went somewhere it made no difference to it to the shunamite woman she still believed to be a man of God sure no matter what he did he was still the man of God to her because she had seen God moving in his life and to Mara no matter what taking place she' seen what God did for him she said even now Lord whatever you ask God God will give it to you there you are he said th brother shall rise again and so he said where have you been and they went down to the grave and he called Lazarus from the grave age of being dead for 4 days why because Lazarus sister respected what he was if you can't respect the man respect the office he holds in God that's exactly right see respect him if a minister comes up your pastor always respecting I've heard congregations talk about their pastor how just talk about him running down ridiculing how's that Pastor ever going to do anything for you he can't do it you you don't you don't read I don't say this church but I mean churches I have seen that if you you've got to love your pastor you've got to know that he's a human being but yet God has made him his Pastor the Holy Ghost has made him overseer then you've got to respect him in that manner and no matter what the pastor's done if you respect him in your heart as servant God will respect you for doing it amen he that he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me Jesus said he that don't receive me can't receive him see they said God was your father said your father's the devil so you see you've got to respect it and believe it believe that he is yes Martha believ it that's one little thing I hit on this morning that's serop woman that time when she come up look how she was turned down bitterly there he was a Jew she was a gentile and she run up to him she didn't know how to approach him but she had a need and she know that he was that Son of God she believed that she if if God would answer his prayer for others he' answer prayer for her and she know what he said was a word of God if it's a word of God for the Jews is a word of God for the Gentiles too whatever he said and Jesus give her a trial she said Lord have mercy now watch no he said thou son of David because she'd heard the Jews saying thou son of David now he wasn't son of David to her see he said thou son of David that would have been the way a Jew would approached him because she'd heard the rest of she tried to come like David because she's trying to find respect she was trying to show her respect and she wasn't just making out Jesus would know if it was no he didn't know that so as she come up she said thou son of David have mercy upon my daughter because she's very next with the devil he turned and looked at her and said it's not meat for me to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs wasn't that one that was one not only turned her down on her request but called her a dog right and a dog's one of the lowest names the Bible has you know so he said uh not meatly take your children's bread and cast it to the dogs she said that's truth Lord Lord then she got it he was no son of gave it to her but he was Lord said true Lord that's right but the children eats the scraps under the I mean the the dogs eat the scraps under the master's table that got it that was it that was a respect Jesus turned to her said great is your faith now go home you're going to find your daughter just as you have believed that's it why it was her approach what if she turned around and said he turned around that it's not meat for me to take in other words it's not proper say a Catholic come up and say oh brother random uh I know God hears your prayers for these people here would you pray for me I'd say well it's not right for me to take these children's time up here I'm here to pray for these Pentecostals not for you bunch of Catholics see what would she had said oh man I'm actually you stomped out of here like everything see but she turned and she said that's true Lord that's true Lord but we're we're willing to the dogs are willing to eat the scraps under the master's table see that caught him right quick he turned and said great is your faith and then we find another case see it was her approach her respects she was respecting God as she respected him so we find one time there was a Roman and he was a great man and he loved the Jews and he had a servant that was sick himself he didn't feel worthy to go ask Jesus see you always want to feel a lot little than what you are don't never be big in your own sight see now if you're big let somebody else say about you see but now when you uh this woman or this man rather he said he was a Roman Centurion and he had a sick servant so he sent to get this sick servant healed and Jesus said I'll come heal so on his Ro the Romans SE coming I man said oh my here comes that Holy One here comes that Holy One well I'm a old count Gentile I'm I I'm a Roman Cent I'm a general or an officer I I I really not a Jew I have no right for that holy man to come see the respects see I don't have right to have that Holy servant of God come to my house so he would come to the door and he called and said Lord I'm not worthy that you'd come under my roof probably had a palace of a home a centurion said I'm not worthy that you'd come under my roof and I I didn't think myself worthy to even come to you so I sent some of your your own blessed people to Jews but I have a servant here it's very sick and he said I'm a man under Authority said I say to this Soldier you go and he goes I say to this one you come and he comes what did he say there I know that you have all power you can say that this disease go and it goes and you can say that this would come and they would come see you recognize as he had authority over these soldiers so Jesus had authority over all sickness and diseases only thing you have to do Lord is just speak the word [Music] hallelujah just speak the word my servant aah Jesus stop turn around to them Jews said I haven't found Faith like that over in Israel he said it's all right with your Ser why because he respected it he expected Jesus Christ who was the the the god of Heaven now I guess it's getting late I just want to say one more thing is this all those great respects and so forth but today somehow it's different God can do something today and people like that I believe that we' have been different today about 40 years ago when the Holy Ghost was first begin to fall but what the people do locked up the preachers called them Holy Rollers went out on the wouldn't even feed them in the cities and everything like that they broke corn on the railroad tracks to live by what do they do they had another 40 years the church has suffering went through everything two Wars in that much time see skilled all thousands of them when she probably done been gone home now what would taken place when God begin to pour out the Holy Ghost upon the the church in the last days what would have happened 25 years ago when he began to send down his signs and wonders and miracles what would have taken place if the people all rallied over what did they do they said it's hoodoo it's hypnotism he's a midal telepathist he's this that or the other what if all the nation would have went together and said blessed be the name of the Lord what if the methodists and Baptists and Presbyterians and all with a dra hands other and said thank God here's what we've look for am the Holy Ghost is being poured out why here's man who sees Visions here's prophets Among Us here's here's all these great gifts here's speakers with tongues here's Divine healers here's everything's been poured out upon us thanks be to God it come through a humble little Bunch called Pentecostals let's all go back to the Bible again let's go back break up our organizations and all be one brother the great churches all together would have come together what would have happened brother there wouldn't be been had need of a hospital in the land today that's right no there had been such powerful great gifts and Wonders working amongst the people there had been such a respect of perhaps a church had done been gone home in the Millennium had been on but no they disrespected it they called him Holy Rollers the newspapers waited to say every slandering dirty thing they couldn't whatever dirty slang to it they could do it and things like that in churches he hard and laughed at it and made fun of them and turned them away and tried to keep them out of the cities and everything else of disrespect now I could say a lot about that but it's getting late let me come to the brandom Tabernacle please now God's beginning to pour out gifts upon us we see it now what is the gift of God today is the holy spirit it's the Holy Ghost that's in us we've got to respect that we've got to respect it on every person that comes upon we've got to reive to God's Divine gifts when he sends those gift is no matter how real they are it'll never help us until we get to a place that we can respect it somebody can give a prophecy if you don't believe in that prophecy it'll never do you any good amen you've got to have reverence and you've got to respect it you've got to believe that it comes from God believe until it's proved wrong then when it's proved wrong then you have a right to disbelieve it then don't associate with it no more but as long as it been provve out to be the truth then believe it like Old Samuel said that day when he wanted a king he said I want to ask you one thing have I ever taken any of your money from you have I ever asked you for a living or have I ever told you anything in the name of the Lord but what come to pass he said you don't need no King and your king will do you no good and he told him he brought him the question said have I ever told you anything is thus sayith the Lord of what happened now then the people disrespected Samuel oh we know Samuel that's right you we can't say that you never told us anything what was right but but still we want to do it this way see you mustn't do that you must do it God's way when we receive the Holy Ghost is not shaking hands with a pastor receiving the Holy Ghost is receiving Christ into you because he is God's messenger of the Holy Ghost is God's messenger and we must respect when he comes on say look at that woman shouting there and crying tears running down her cheeks look at that man there shaking his hands and trembling and crying you know what that is that's a bunch of worked up emotion you're a blaspheming the Holy Ghost you got to respect that remember here some time ago I was an argon about been about 12 years ago and two little Catholic Reporter girls come down not because they were catholic nothing no more that cuz I've had just as many Protestants more Protestants and half Catholics to make fun of me and um and and so these girls come down to give a report so as soon as they got in there I caught the spirit soon as he come in and I said all right I like criticism you get off your sleeve now and this girl pulled out a cigarette and started my I said just don't like that while you're in my cabin just leave it Al so sat there a little bit and she looked at me as if she could run through me like that and she be to talk something she said well I want to ask you some questions I said say on she said how comes that you're connected up with this bunch of Holy Rollers up here said are you one of them I said I'm one of them and she said well U do you mean to tell me to be anything Godly about that I said not you as a Catholic wouldn't believe it she said how do you know I'm a Catholic I said I know you're a Catholic I'll tell you what your name is New York that Tu her off her feet she said what do you mean to tell me that that kind of a people they say will live your on Earth and be in heaven she said I wouldn't want to be in heaven with such people that I said you don't have to worry very much as long as you think that way you won't be there anyhow see I said you won't have any worry about that I just stood looked her right in the face and um uh a couple of the brethen was sitting in the building I said I'm not being irritable I I just want to let you know where you're standing see and I said you're going to write a want to come out here to find out some stuff and you would never write what I told you you'll make it your own story you go ahead and do that but I want to tell you one thing you write anything Scandal you want to and I said before you die my voice will call back into your ears if it doesn't then you know I'm a false prophet Hallelujah I said no you just write whatever you want to it's up to you I'll give you a liberty to go write what you want to but before you die you'll hear my voice screaming in your ears it'll do you no good wow I said now you go ahead and write what you want to she stood there a little bit she said well what do you think about that idiotic Bunch up there screaming and caring on last night I said they're all Christians Christians I said sure they're Christians I said they're Christians filled with the Holy Ghost and she said that's not no Holy Ghost I said what would you call the Holy Ghost see what she had to say about it I said I'd like to tell you something she said well I wouldn't want to associate myself with a bunch like that I said I don't think to much danger I said if you ever associate yourself like that I said because if you ever associated with God or with any of the Saints you'd associate like that she said the Bible Saints I said yes I said you're Blessed Virgin Mary you call her who is your goddess I said before God would ever let her come to Heaven she had to go up to the day of Pentecost and receive the Holy Ghost and staggered under the power of God like a drunk woman she said that is aive I said hold your pce just a minute I turned over here to the Bel I said look here turned over I said here it is right here in the book she turned her head I said you haven't even got the ocity to read God's word I said sure see disrespectable I said now you can take your pack of cigarettes off the table there go when you're ready but I said I want you to know one thing you write whatever you want to but remember the last words I say in the name of the Lord you'll remember it before you die she never wrote nothing that's right she just let it go what is it disrespects trying to make fun doing something they don't know what they're doing right but here in the Tabernacle we want you all to know these things here when God begins to pour out the Holy Spirit upon people sometimes I know I've seen people get in the flesh when they were when they were under the anointing of the spirit I've seen them go to extremes with things but didn't you say nothing about it you respect it bow your head you might not understand it neither would I but I want to respect it anyhow now we must have respects to God and when God pours out the Holy Spirit I just say thank you Heavenly Father you have doing something for that poor precious soul that wants to come to your home like I do somay and I see man like here one time a brother that's in the ministry said that I talked about him and we went and got all the tapes and sent to him as brother a Allen and he said that I made fun of him talking about blood coming out of your hand and and calling that the initial evidence the Holy Ghost and and of his blood and a coming out of his hands and forehead and things he said that was uh was that I made fun of that and told him that it was of the devil I sat back I wrote him a letter I said brother Allan he wrote a piece and you you read it dear brother Brandon see and so then put off tracks all across the country instead of come and see me about it he did that but I here what I said I said I'll take all six nights at Phoenix and send you my tapes and show you which Leo and them did and sent the tapes them I said only one time your name was called the people put up on my desk and said brother Brandon brother Allan had just been in the town and told us that the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost was bleeding in the hands and bleeding in the face and or running out of your hands that was initial evidence I said I disagree with brother Allan upon that being initial evidence of the Holy Ghost because it was were in the Bible were they ever bled up their hands and and oil come out of their face and hands for prove they had the Holy Ghost that's said the Holy Ghost was a power of God in their lives and Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe see my name they shall cast out devils and so forth but I said here's one thing I would say about brother Allen he's a great man of God and if I could preach as good as brother Allan could I'd never have a healing service as I just preach the gospel then see after you done put that paper out and everything that I did that just on what somebody else said but even I disagreed with the brother upon his theory I certainly wouldn't want to blaspheme the brother then standing right there up here in um Minnesota that night in Minneapolis Minnesota and there was in that Great cathedal temple with Garden Peterson and this guy that wrote that book against a Allen and said everything about him that could be said and said he even had the ocity to write that book of biting Devils about that woman showed Prince on my hands where a devil bitter and things like that now I I certainly I don't know whether that could be true or not because the Devil is a spirit you see but this woman claim the big hairy devil come and bit her all over the hands and all over the face and everything like that and he said AA Allen wrote that book and the man that wrote the book wrote a nice article about me and here he was sitting right there in the meeting that night when brother Peter them come told me there he said and was bragging on me and down in AA Allen I thought here's a time I can take up for brother Al so I walked out there and I said I was reading here the article in the paper today and this certain man that's in the city and I and knowing he sitting right out there I said he said here that U AA Allen and all the criticism I said although I appreciate the man saying the compliment about me that he did I said that I wasn't out for money and things like that and held the cleanest meetings of any of them and so forth the nice things he said I said I appreciate that but if that man that wrote this article you're in the paper never checked his notes any closer than to say a a Allen wrote this Bon of devils AA Allen never wrote that book I know the man that wrote it I said he never wrote the book at all and if the man never checked up on his article any closer than that I doubt that the rest that he's ever said about brother Allan is the truth take it up for brother Allan and I said besides if brother Allan would be wrong I'd rather be found at the Judgment bar taking my stand with brother Allan in the wrong when he's trying to win souls to Christ than to be criticizing what the man's trying to do amen right yes sir every who calls on the name of Jesus Christ I'm with him whether he's Protestant Catholic or whatever he is I I might disagree with him upon theology but I want to respect him as a servant of Christ and is my brother see no matter what he does we've got to give respect to the Holy Spirit exactly right yes sir and when we get to doing that then God will going to pour His blessings Among Us just us little group right here about 50 or 60 or maybe 75 people sitting in here tonight if we would just all together bind ourselves together and give Godly respects to God and to the Holy Spirit what he's doing in this day and respect every gift and every office that he's saying into our midst God will just continue to pour out his Spirit upon us and we'll grow in numbers and multiplies don't you believe that sure we've got to have respect unto God let us bow our head just a moment for prayer before we go to prayer I'd like to know if there's anybody in here would like to say brother brandom I want you to pray for me that I'll have great respects for God that I'll always be able to keep my mouth shut against God's things no matter what they are and may God place in my heart to respect every Divine gift he sends into the church would you just raise your hands and say pray for me God bless you I'm nearly in the church and I have mine up to God help me to be a servant of yours help me to respect my brothers help me to respect my sisters and every spirit of God that comes into the meeting whether it be speaking with tongues whether it be interpretation of tongues whether it be prophecy whether it be Gifts of discernment whatever it is I say oh Lord Jesus send them send them oh Lord I am thankful to you now Heavenly Father we know that thou are a great and terrible God we know that thy wrath is terrible when Once thou has th uh temper up why it's it's terrible thing the wrath of God can destroy the world in a second but when you look down upon the blood of the Lord Jesus then your wrath is turned away oh hide me over in the Rock of Ages Lord God keep my soul covered with the blood of the Lord Jesus not only mine Lord but those that are in here too tonight we love you Lord Lord and every gift that you has given us though they may call us anything they want to do Lord that still will not don't want that to have one thing to do with it we still

great alls sufficient gift of Jesus Christ we thank you for his grace and his Mercy who makes all these other minor things uh uh eligible to us by his vicarious suffering and bleeding at Calvary he sanctifies the common people that hears him gladly and Lord we're so glad that you've come to Common People in the Bible in the book of St Luke we read that the common people hurting gladly today they say oh that's just a common Bunch but Lord that's the bunch that heard you when you were here in flesh the Common People heard you gladly the hoty the rich and many of those would not hear you the Kings the potentates the priests of the day would not hear you but the Common People gladly received you and father tonight we are common people and we gladly receive you we are glad like they were when they come back rejoicing and thinking it was a wonderful thing and happy because they could bear the reproach of his name when they reproached them and called them everything and they were so happy because it was a privilege for them to suffer for the name of Jesus Christ father God We join ourselves with them Disciples of that day and say happy are we I stand ton night like St Paul of old when he stood before Ag gria and he said in the way that's called heresy crazy that's the way I worship the god of our fathers and when a gria said Paul too much learning has made thee mad he said I am not mad O gria then he finally got into a place she said thou almost persuadest me to be a Christian he said I would that you were a thy even without these chains of bom oh God what love that Paul had he said he would become a curse that is people might be saved oh Father God give us love for one another like that give us that undying love that decency that respects for one another to be Christian enough to look over each other's mistakes to look over because a man has been blessed of God and he might make a mistake oh father let us not look at that mistake knowing that's a precious brother that maybe Satan did trap him into something but if he did we pray Lord that you'll help he or she out of that place that we'll have love in our hearts to go to the lost sheep and bring them back to the fold Grant it Lord forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us Grant it Lord lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and
