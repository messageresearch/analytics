[1:32] streaming let's sing only
[1:36] believe
[1:38] only
[1:39] [Music]
[1:41] be
[1:43] only
[1:47] be all
[1:49] things
[1:52] possible
[1:54] only
[1:57] believe only
[1:59] [Music]
[2:04] only
[2:07] be all things are
[2:12] possible
[2:14] only
[2:16] be you may be seated brother
[2:24] Brena and he'll attack the Book of
[2:28] Genesis upon it
[2:30] it's uh uh being
[2:32] authentic he'll say that it isn't
[2:35] authentic he'll stir the minds of people
[2:37] watch where the devil lays that book of
[2:39] Genesis or the Book of
[2:41] Revelations the first and the last and
[2:44] the Book of Revelations has more symbols
[2:47] in it than all the rest of the books in
[2:50] the Bible it has more symbols because it
[2:52] is a book of
[2:55] Prophecy it's a prophetic book therefore
[2:59] it has to be understood by a prophetic
[3:03] class this book is not meant for
[3:06] everybody there's nobody can understand
[3:08] it hardly this book is made for a
[3:11] certain class of
[3:14] people
[3:15] hallelujah all over Deuteronomy says the
[3:19] hidden things belong to the Lord that is
[3:23] right and he reveals to us his children
[3:26] the hidden things so it doesn't go the
[3:29] carnal cannot comprehend them great
[3:31] things of the scripture because it's
[3:34] foolish to them but to the ones who are
[3:36] lovers of the word of God that's who the
[3:39] book was written to to the
[3:42] church the revelation of Jesus Christ to
[3:46] the church at Ephesus to the Church of
[3:49] Samia to the church to the church it's
[3:51] all down the revelation of Jesus Christ
[3:54] to the church I like that I notice
[4:00] it also is the consummation of the
[4:06] scriptures the complete consummation and
[4:09] it's geographically placed at the right
[4:12] place at the end of the
[4:15] Bible the revelation of the whole thing
[4:18] placed back here with a blessing to who
[4:20] reads it and hears it with a curse to
[4:23] them that'll add to or take away it's
[4:25] the complete Cannon amen all the
[4:30] absolute nothing can be added to it amen
[4:34] and when a man tries to take anything
[4:37] away from it or add anything to it God
[4:39] said he'd take the same part out of The
[4:41] Book of Life see he would take his part
[4:44] from the book if he added to it
[4:48] therefore when we see the manifold
[4:51] revelation of Our Lord who he is what he
[4:57] is if any person shall add something to
[5:01] that or take anything away from it it's
[5:02] a false
[5:04] prophecy many US tried to say they had
[5:06] something later than that but that is a
[5:09] complete revelation of the Lord Jesus in
[5:13] his church age and in his days a
[5:17] revelation of Our Lord now now unveiling
[5:22] the Greek word something that's been hid
[5:26] un UNR uh revealing Christ
[5:29] now the next verse we find in the second
[5:32] verse the first verse is unveiling
[5:36] Christ the Revelation or the
[5:40] uncovering oh how the last age and the
[5:44] coming of the
[5:46] Lord was on was covered up to the
[5:52] apostles they asked the question but
[5:54] only one lived to have the Revelation
[5:56] still he didn't understand it because
[5:58] the history was not yet
[6:01] made now the history of this book or the
[6:06] the context of this book was directed to
[6:09] the seven churches in Asia Minor that
[6:13] van was it was directed to those seven
[6:17] churches there were more churches in
[6:19] those seven at that day but each one of
[6:23] those churches were sign significant
[6:25] about the characteristic in that church
[6:29] that would follow it down through the
[6:31] age the characteristic of that church
[6:34] like Ephesus it had a characteristic
[6:36] Samia pgus and on down Philadelphia each
[6:40] one of those churches had a
[6:42] characteristic in it that would appear
[6:45] again in the ages to come oh if you
[6:49] could only any man can see the the
[6:52] spiritual application of the scriptures
[6:55] and could say that they wasn't inspired
[6:57] Hallelujah your very actions the very
[7:00] motives the very objectives of the
[7:02] people why it proves that the scripture
[7:06] is inspired to see how God applies those
[7:10] things just once you do here is a type
[7:14] of something like Abraham offering up
[7:16] Isaac his only son a type of God gave
[7:19] his son hundreds of years later how that
[7:23] Joseph was sold in in prison hated of
[7:26] his brothers loved of his father Jesus
[7:29] enti
[7:30] how the spirit worked through Joseph A
[7:32] man and simply typed the Life of Christ
[7:36] perfectly how David the son of David sat
[7:41] on the same Mount when David was
[7:43] rejected his King and went up over the
[7:44] hill n of all is looking back weeping as
[7:48] a rejected
[7:50] King a few hundred years after that the
[7:52] son of David climbed the same Hill as a
[7:56] rejected King and WEP over Jerusalem the
[8:00] spirit and type and form oh then can you
[8:05] see the great Pentecostal Church in this
[8:08] last days can you see how God
[8:11] inaugurated at the day of Pentecost that
[8:14] Spirit should remain in the church to
[8:17] all
[8:18] ages they got farming indiff they had to
[8:22] have a denomination they had the United
[8:24] church and state together and they
[8:26] finally did it and caused hundreds of
[8:28] years of persecution
[8:30] then the Reformation they come out in
[8:32] each year they've been cutting off from
[8:34] the spirit and adding on to the Natural
[8:36] off of the spirit and add on to the
[8:38] Natural until now they're just ready to
[8:40] do it again yes we're living in these
[8:45] last closing hours the confirmation of
[8:49] the church we are in the Philadelphia or
[8:51] the lady oan
[8:53] churching God now the first chapter
[8:58] first verse was introduced to to John
[9:01] Now who is the writer John John it was
[9:04] not a revelation of
[9:07] John and uh we know that it
[9:10] wasn't because it was the revelation of
[9:13] the Lord Jesus
[9:17] Christ he was he was chosen for a
[9:22] disciple and uh the book itself reveals
[9:26] the thing that it
[9:27] was Jesus Christ to who he was
[9:31] revealing and it was sent to the and
[9:35] signified this by his Angel unto John we
[9:39] do not know who the angel was the Bible
[9:44] doesn't say who the angel was but we
[9:47] know that it was a prophet because the
[9:50] Bible later said that I Jesus has sent
[9:53] my angel to testify these things which
[9:55] must shortly come to pass then we find
[9:58] out that when John started to worship
[10:01] the angel the angel said see that you do
[10:04] it not Revelations 22 I believe it is
[10:07] and he said for I am of thy fellow
[10:09] servants and of the
[10:12] prophets it might have been
[10:14] Elijah it might have been one of the
[10:16] prophets John was an apostle but this
[10:19] Prophet was sent and John being an
[10:22] apostle look at the nature of the rest
[10:24] of his Epistles proved that it wasn't
[10:26] John wrote it because it has no nature
[10:29] natur like John take first John 2 John
[10:32] so forth and read it and look at the
[10:34] nature of that then look at the nature
[10:36] of this John was a riter and was an
[10:39] apostle but this is the spirit of a
[10:43] prophet a different person all together
[10:47] see wasn't John's writing wasn't John's
[10:50] Revelation it was God's revelation of
[10:54] Jesus Christ to the churches
[10:57] amen and it had John was just the writer
[11:00] The Scribe and um and the book declares
[11:04] the same
[11:05] now it wasn't addressed to John it was a
[11:11] address to the
[11:14] church all right John at that time was
[11:17] the pastor of the Ephesian church and
[11:21] now the book is addressed to John or to
[11:25] the church not to John now the third
[11:28] verse he announces the blessings listen
[11:31] to this blessed is he that readeth and
[11:35] they that hear the words of this
[11:37] prophecy and keep those things which are
[11:40] written therein for the time is at hand
[11:44] what time is it hand the time these
[11:47] things take place when this revelation
[11:51] of Jesus Christ is completed in each
[11:54] Church age now the reason he wrote it
[11:57] like this if he' have said um well now
[12:00] there looking if it been
[12:02] revealed if he it would have been
[12:04] revealed to John that he was go to come
[12:08] as soon as those churches there was
[12:11] finished that's the way John thought it
[12:13] but if it was them churches as soon as
[12:16] they was finished they come if he knew
[12:17] if it' been revealed to him there's
[12:19] going to be seven long Church ages
[12:21] several thousand years or several
[12:23] hundreds of years then there wouldn't be
[12:25] no reason of waiting they just live
[12:27] their Church A J therefore
[12:29] God spoke it and it wasn't revealed to
[12:32] them it wasn't revealed to Martin Luther
[12:35] the things that John Wesley knew about
[12:36] the Scripture it isn't revealed to the
[12:39] Baptist what the Pentecostals knows
[12:41] about scripture because it's in a
[12:44] different age it's a different time and
[12:47] God Reveals His things just in the
[12:51] season oh you can't plant corn in the
[12:54] springtime and reap at the same time you
[12:56] plant a seed and it grows to maturity
[12:59] God plants his word and it grows right
[13:01] out and then we look back and say there
[13:03] it was well sure we see it after it's
[13:06] been revealed now blessed the word the
[13:10] announcement of the blessing on the
[13:12] third
[13:13] verse to them that read or hear its
[13:18] Mysteries the carnal mind shuns it
[13:21] because the carnal mind knows nothing
[13:22] about
[13:23] it no wonder the carnal mind doesn't
[13:26] know it
[13:27] because it's Satan in that carnal mind
[13:31] and Satan is
[13:33] exposed and Satan does not want himself
[13:36] exposed do you notice how horrible it is
[13:39] for Satan when he thinks he's going to
[13:41] be exposed watch in one of the services
[13:44] watch the action of the people you watch
[13:46] out on the meeting just before Satan's
[13:48] go to be exposed over a certain person
[13:50] you see their face changing you see they
[13:53] don't know what to think all at once the
[13:55] Holy Spirit comes down and exposes that
[13:57] devil
[13:59] oh he hates that kind of a
[14:02] meeting it's the reason we've had such a
[14:04] battle because the word of God exposes
[14:08] the
[14:10] devil see it tells what he is amen like
[14:15] you say this woman sitting here under
[14:17] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit say
[14:19] her name is Miss Jones she come from so
[14:22] and so what does that do it picks up her
[14:25] spirit brings it up to a place how do
[14:27] you know me that man doesn't know me so
[14:29] it must be some Spirit what kind of
[14:31] spirit is it it's the spirit of God H
[14:34] what's the matter with me you have
[14:36] tuberculosis cancer whatever it is but
[14:38] thus sayith the Lord oh oh how Satan
[14:42] hates
[14:44] that because it exposes him now the
[14:47] carnal mind looks on and says mind
[14:50] reading mental telepathy they don't know
[14:53] it's foolish to them but to those who
[14:55] know what it is oh what blessing what is
[15:00] it a
[15:01] revelation a revelation of who of the
[15:05] man on the pulpit of Jesus Christ in
[15:07] this last Church AG revealing himself
[15:10] like he promised you would do the
[15:14] Revelation see and Satan hates that my
[15:19] how he hates it he's
[15:21] exposed exposes his plan Satan hates the
[15:25] revelations and Genesis they got wrot
[15:26] down here that is exactly true now
[15:29] why does he hate a Revelations why is he
[15:32] so against Revelations is because that
[15:35] the inire cannon of God's word and God's
[15:39] church is solemnly built upon
[15:44] Revelation it will never be through a a
[15:50] school no matter how many fine
[15:52] seminaries we have they are way back in
[15:55] the dmed
[15:56] age the Bible and the church is
[16:00] absolutely a
[16:03] revelation let us turn I've got some
[16:05] scriptures right I here uh Matthew the
[16:07] the 16th chapter and the 18th verse
[16:09] let's just take a little look at Matthew
[16:11] 1618 see where the scriptures is for
[16:13] it's the
[16:15] Revelation coming down from the
[16:17] mountain the 17th verse and Jesus
[16:20] answered and said unto him blessed art
[16:22] thou Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood
[16:27] has not revealed it un to thee but my
[16:31] Father which is in
[16:32] heaven and I say unto thee Thou Art
[16:36] Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my
[16:40] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[16:42] Prevail against
[16:44] it now the Catholic Church says he built
[16:47] it up on
[16:49] Peter well that that's really carnal
[16:54] thinking you couldn't imagine a
[16:57] spiritual mind
[16:59] of comprehending such a thing as that is
[17:01] god with his own son standing there and
[17:05] yet would build his church upon a common
[17:07] hard near sin born
[17:10] man the man proved he with that same
[17:13] Spirit up on him he cursed Jesus and
[17:15] denied him right to his
[17:17] face it wasn't
[17:20] Peter or neither was it a rock that was
[17:23] laying there as some Churches claim it
[17:25] was was not a rock CA Peter the rock
[17:29] that he was speaking about there was not
[17:32] Peter neither was it himself now many of
[17:35] the Protestant people try to say it was
[17:38] Jesus it was him that he built the
[17:41] church upon on he no that's still wrong
[17:45] if you notice it was not Jesus neither
[17:48] was it Peter it was the
[17:52] Revelation flesh and blood has not
[17:54] revealed this to you but my Father which
[17:57] is in heaven has done this this
[17:59] Revelation look I want to asked you in
[18:02] the Garden of Eden there was no
[18:04] scriptures
[18:06] written and then the two boys Cain and
[18:10] Abel and they both wanted to make a
[18:12] sacrifice and to find favor with God
[18:15] when they did so Cain come and built an
[18:18] altar Abel build an altar well if that's
[18:21] all God requires God would be unjust to
[18:24] condemn
[18:25] Cain all right then Cain made a sacrif
[18:29] so did Abel both of them made a
[18:32] sacrifice Kain worshiped and so did Abel
[18:36] Kain did everything that able
[18:40] did so if going to church belonging to
[18:44] church making sacrifices and praying and
[18:48] worshiping God is all God
[18:51] requires then God would be unjust to
[18:55] condemn Cain for doing exactly what he
[18:58] said to do
[19:00] but you see Abel by a
[19:05] revelation he know that it wasn't fruit
[19:08] that brought him out of the Garden of
[19:09] Eden as many carnal minds think today
[19:11] Abel come and offer the fruit of the
[19:14] land and God refused it but it was
[19:18] revealed I mean Cain did excuse me Cain
[19:21] offered the fruit of the
[19:23] land because he thought that's what
[19:25] brought him out of the Garden of Eden
[19:27] What's that revelation watch's the
[19:29] disagreement with it watch how it hurts
[19:31] today but it was not fruit that brought
[19:34] him out Eve never eat no
[19:38] apples certainly how did she realize she
[19:41] was
[19:42] naked if eating apples it pertained to
[19:45] the sexual life had
[19:48] to now we take that as a study and we
[19:51] have get back in they haven't got one
[19:54] scripture some of them say well she said
[19:56] I got a son from The Lord yes sir so do
[19:59] the
[20:00] prostitutes God has to make all life but
[20:04] it's a perverted Li look at the nature
[20:06] that boy was of his daddy the devil
[20:10] hatred mean
[20:12] M see and then how
[20:16] Abel when the parents probably told him
[20:19] that the trees had fruit on it and so
[20:22] forth but it was revealed to
[20:25] Abel Abel went and got a lamb for blood
[20:29] taking life not a fruit tree bringing
[20:32] apples and bananas and pears but Able by
[20:36] spiritual Revelation Hebrews
[20:38] 11 offered unto God a more excellent
[20:42] sacrifice God testifying of it amen for
[20:46] it was revealed to him by
[20:48] faith that's where God build his
[20:51] church for Flesh and Blood never
[20:54] revealed this do you never learned it in
[20:55] a
[20:56] seminary somebody ever taught it you
[20:59] somewhere but my Father which is in
[21:01] heaven has revealed it to you there the
[21:04] whole thing is on
[21:06] Revelation the whole church Upon This
[21:08] Rock of revelation of Jesus Christ I
[21:13] build my church you might take what the
[21:16] pastor says you might take what the
[21:17] Seminary teaches you might take what the
[21:20] church says and it's not right yet you
[21:22] might be able to explain it with
[21:23] eloquence but until God has revealed to
[21:27] you that Jesus Christ is his son and you
[21:31] are saved to his blood upon that
[21:34] Revelation that he is my savior Upon
[21:38] This Rock I'll build my church and the
[21:42] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail again so
[21:44] then you see what Satan is so against
[21:47] the Book of
[21:49] Revelation anything that's revealed
[21:52] spiritual Revelation Satan's against it
[21:55] that's why so against the ministry today
[21:58] they call what is

[1:03:53] with um
[1:03:56] well we've been off and on and it seems
[1:03:58] like we can't get out of it but I wanted
[1:04:03] to go into it one more time this morning
[1:04:06] Ephesians chapter
[1:04:08] 6 and by way of announcements the little
[1:04:12] kids the Sunday school has a play for us

[1:04:25] support them uh this afternoon I'll be
[1:04:29] regular service but we'll take time to
[1:04:31] have that Ephesians chapter 6 verse
[1:04:34] number 10 says finally my brethren be
[1:04:40] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[1:04:43] His might put on the whole armor of God
[1:04:46] that ye may be able to stand against the
[1:04:51] Ws of the devil amen we'll take one more
[1:04:55] scripture in in Luke
[1:04:58] 4 I think we read this last time we read
[1:05:02] it
[1:05:09] again this is a conversation that Satan
[1:05:13] is having with Jesus the son of God
[1:05:17] you'll find it in Matthew chapter 4 I
[1:05:19] believe but Luke chap 4 is where we're
[1:05:22] going to read verses number one and
[1:05:26] Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:29] returned from Jordan and was led by the
[1:05:31] spirit Into the Wilderness being 40 days
[1:05:34] tempted of the devil and in those days
[1:05:36] he did eat nothing and when they were
[1:05:39] ended he afterward hungered and the
[1:05:42] devil said unto him if thou be the Son
[1:05:46] of God command these stones that it may
[1:05:50] that it be made bread and Jesus answered
[1:05:54] him saying it is written that man shall
[1:05:58] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:06:01] word of God and the devil taking him up
[1:06:04] into a high mountain showed him all the
[1:06:06] kingdoms of the world in a moment of
[1:06:09] time and the devil said unto him all
[1:06:13] this power will I give thee and the
[1:06:16] glory of them for that is delivered unto
[1:06:21] me and to whomsoever I will I give it
[1:06:26] if thou therefore will worship me all
[1:06:29] shall be thine and Jesus answered and
[1:06:32] said unto him get thee behind me Satan
[1:06:35] for it is written thou shal Worship the
[1:06:38] Lord thy God and him only sh thou serve
[1:06:43] amen so we're going to be exposing
[1:06:45] Satan's tactics just the title is
[1:06:48] Ephesians chapter 6
[1:06:51] exposing Satan's tactics let's pray one
[1:06:54] more time lord Jesus
[1:06:57] we commit ourselves into your hand once
[1:06:59] again as we read a portion of your word
[1:07:02] Lord may you open it up to our heart
[1:07:07] understanding for this service Lord
[1:07:09] bless the Saints there in Phoenix

[1:07:14] different ones that were streaming Lord
[1:07:17] the good
[1:07:18] speeds faithful Saints Lord that you
[1:07:20] would remember them and feed them is our
[1:07:24] prayer and each one from our youngest
[1:07:27] ones to the oldest ones in our midst we
[1:07:30] pray in Jesus name amen God bless you
[1:07:33] may be seated
[1:07:36] exposing Satan's tactics now this is a
[1:07:39] conversation that we see Jesus having
[1:07:43] with
[1:07:44] Satan um it's a it's a it's a pattern or
[1:07:48] a layout of how Satan attacks and his
[1:07:53] schemes and the ways he goes about doing
[1:07:57] things and we read many scriptures for
[1:07:58] you last time on his um you know who he
[1:08:05] was you know there's a scripture in
[1:08:07] Ezekiel that says that that you are
[1:08:12] wiser behold Thou Art wiser than Daniel
[1:08:16] and we know that Daniel Noah and job
[1:08:20] were
[1:08:20] specifically brought out as righteous
[1:08:23] men that even if they lived in the city
[1:08:27] that City had gone so far into sin that
[1:08:30] even if those three righteous men were
[1:08:32] in the city the Lord points out those
[1:08:34] characters Noah uh job and Daniel and
[1:08:39] here the prophet is pulling and catching
[1:08:43] Satan in the spirit showing that he was
[1:08:46] wiser than Daniel now in 1 Chronicles
[1:08:52] chapter 21 we read that for you last
[1:08:54] time but let's take 2 Samuel chapter
[1:08:59] 24
[1:09:02] briefly if you can turn there in your
[1:09:05] Bible and this is the word of the lord
[1:09:10] it's recorded twice this happening we
[1:09:13] read um first uh 2 Samuel last Sunday
[1:09:18] let's take we were at 1 Chronicles 21
[1:09:22] last Sunday Let's Take 2 Samuel chapter
[1:09:25] 24 and this is what the Bible says and
[1:09:29] again the anger of the Lord was kindled
[1:09:31] against Israel and he moved David
[1:09:35] against them to say go number Israel in
[1:09:38] Judah for the king said to joab the
[1:09:41] captain of his host who which was with
[1:09:44] him go now through all the tribes of
[1:09:46] Israel from Dan even to berseba and
[1:09:50] number ye the people that I may know the
[1:09:53] number of the people and job joab said
[1:09:56] unto the king now the Lord thy God add
[1:09:59] unto the people how many soever they be
[1:10:03] and H
[1:10:04] hundredfold and that the Eyes of My Lord
[1:10:07] the king may see it but why doth my Lord
[1:10:11] the king Delight in this thing not
[1:10:15] withstanding the king's word prevailed
[1:10:18] against joab and against the captains of
[1:10:22] the host and joab and the captains of
[1:10:24] the host went out from the presence of
[1:10:26] the king to number the people now it's
[1:10:30] recorded a little differently in 1
[1:10:33] Chronicles how many remember that in
[1:10:35] Chronicles 21 verse one it says that
[1:10:38] Satan stood up against Israel and
[1:10:41] provoke David to number Israel so which
[1:10:45] one of those are true uh both of them
[1:10:48] are and Satan was behind it
[1:10:52] all but he gets it into the mind of
[1:10:55] David to number the children of Israel
[1:10:59] which was which ought not to have been
[1:11:02] so I'm not sure exactly why I don't know
[1:11:04] if it was because it was his pride to
[1:11:07] know how many people so you can boast on
[1:11:09] the number because there's places in the
[1:11:11] Bible where they were numbered it's
[1:11:13] called a census you know you want to
[1:11:15] know how many soldiers foot people and
[1:11:18] so forth and so numbering the people it
[1:11:22] was done before but why was it wrong for
[1:11:24] David to number the people however or
[1:11:28] whatever we know it was wrong and
[1:11:31] finally after he did it and remember
[1:11:34] something moved him to do it the Bible
[1:11:36] says that the Lord was upset with Israel
[1:11:39] so he moved David but when you uncover
[1:11:42] what actually happened in Chronicles
[1:11:45] along with uh 2 Samuel you see that
[1:11:50] Satan was behind this and David was a
[1:11:54] man after God's Own Heart heart David
[1:11:56] wasn't a a lukewarm person David had
[1:12:00] experiences with God and he was very
[1:12:04] well equipped as a true representative
[1:12:08] of a man that really loved the Lord and
[1:12:11] served him but look how Satan got into
[1:12:14] him to number the people and the
[1:12:17] scripture goes on to say in verse 10
[1:12:19] that David's heart smote him after that
[1:12:23] he had numbered the people and David
[1:12:25] said unto the Lord I have sinned greatly
[1:12:27] in that I have done what I have done now
[1:12:30] I beseech thee Oh Lord take away the
[1:12:33] iniquity of thy servant of course we
[1:12:36] know that the prophet Gad came to him
[1:12:40] and gave him three options how you want
[1:12:43] to take this beating David give you
[1:12:46] three options did your parents ever give
[1:12:48] you options
[1:12:50] on it's either a belt or a switch which
[1:12:53] one you going to get it
[1:12:55] though and so he gives David these
[1:12:58] options and David chooses to go into the
[1:13:01] hands of the Lord the ultimately lose a
[1:13:04] lot of people but I wanted to point out
[1:13:06] that in 2 Samuel 24 it doesn't mention
[1:13:09] Satan at all there's no mention that
[1:13:13] Satan was behind any of this but as the
[1:13:17] word of the Lord begins to open up
[1:13:19] you'll see that it was Satan that moved
[1:13:22] him to do it and he fell into it it and
[1:13:25] after he did it he was convicted the
[1:13:28] Bible says his heart smote him now this
[1:13:34] um this
[1:13:37] Satan Desiring and having the power and
[1:13:41] the ability to give power to whomsoever
[1:13:45] he
[1:13:46] will um we see this in the Book of
[1:13:50] Job and the Book of Job 1 ver 7
[1:13:55] says uh just right at the beginning
[1:13:57] there it says that the sons of God there
[1:14:00] came a day that they uh came to meet the
[1:14:02] Lord and Satan came with him he came
[1:14:06] with this congregation now so what is
[1:14:09] Satan doing here so the Lord asked him
[1:14:12] Satan where comest thou what are you
[1:14:14] doing he says I'm just doing my thing
[1:14:17] I'm roaming through the Earth to and
[1:14:20] fro he like this just cruising through
[1:14:23] the Earth to and fro and then the sons
[1:14:27] of God meet and he shows up there too
[1:14:30] twice is recorded in the scripture
[1:14:32] chapter one and chapter two in chapter
[1:14:35] one and the Lord asked Satan have you
[1:14:39] considered my servant job remember if
[1:14:42] the Lord ask a question it's not because
[1:14:44] he don't already know the
[1:14:46] answer but he asked Satan have you
[1:14:48] considered my servant job and look at
[1:14:51] what job says job says well yeah
[1:14:57] and the Lord says he's there's no one
[1:14:59] like him he says well yeah you got a you
[1:15:01] got a hedge built around
[1:15:04] him everything around him is covered
[1:15:07] taking care of his house his animals
[1:15:11] everything that he has his very life is
[1:15:14] covered but but if you remove all that
[1:15:18] I'll get him to curse you to your face I
[1:15:20] will get in him and I will cause him to
[1:15:24] look you in the face and curse you
[1:15:28] that's what I'll do but I can't get to
[1:15:30] him now what a powerful thought to see
[1:15:33] how Satan his bounds are have been
[1:15:37] ordered he can only come as far as he is
[1:15:42] allowed to come remember Satan can't
[1:15:45] make you do anything but he can
[1:15:48] influence you and he's behind every evil
[1:15:53] thought every evil
[1:15:55] you know if he was to Shadow you and
[1:15:58] Shadow you in your day and follow you at
[1:16:01] your work which he does and we don't see
[1:16:03] it like that but he Shadows us and
[1:16:05] follows us he'd be taking notes on your
[1:16:09] behavior and he will move against you
[1:16:12] just as soon as he can but when God has
[1:16:16] a hedge about his children thank God for
[1:16:19] it if you have a protection around you
[1:16:23] that's not in Your Own Strength that's
[1:16:26] because the Lord has his protection
[1:16:30] around you and we thank God for it and
[1:16:32] so we see that this that this power that
[1:16:37] the enemy has can never be underestimate
[1:16:41] let's go to the message here just for a
[1:16:44] moment and here what the prophet of God
[1:16:46] says about this don't never
[1:16:50] underestimate his tactics paragraph
[1:16:53] number 29 in the message bomb of Gilead
[1:16:57] he says this
[1:16:59] here that's what's the matter today all
[1:17:02] the nation goes into sin whiskey joints
[1:17:04] of people getting cold andal uncensored
[1:17:07] radio programs uncensored television
[1:17:10] program and it's so fascinating and sin
[1:17:15] is so beautiful until it attracts the
[1:17:18] attentions of the people and if they're
[1:17:21] not truly born again where their attent
[1:17:24] attraction is on Christ and and
[1:17:27] single-minded then they'll go after that
[1:17:30] stuff they'll act like those people the
[1:17:34] spirit of that will get on them used to
[1:17:38] be the old Pentecostals wouldn't let
[1:17:40] their children go to picture shows the
[1:17:43] devil pull one over on their eyes he
[1:17:46] brought the picture show right into the
[1:17:48] house that's right and so you see how he
[1:17:51] got it slick wise slimy me as he can be
[1:17:56] don't you never underestimate him you
[1:17:59] stay under the cross it's the only place
[1:18:02] to stay for
[1:18:04] safety the prophet of God continues in
[1:18:07] the message expectations and he says
[1:18:10] this here paragraph 75 he says talking
[1:18:15] about brother Argan brigh he says A Real
[1:18:17] Fine brother he's not here tonight or he
[1:18:21] be on the platform minor arganbright is
[1:18:24] a gun Barrel straight he's a fine man
[1:18:27] you can put your trust in minor organ
[1:18:29] bright arganbright as a Christian I've
[1:18:32] been with him on all kinds of meetings
[1:18:34] he was sitting there that night when 15
[1:18:36] witch doctors on each side trying to
[1:18:40] blow the thing away and seeing there the
[1:18:43] storm lifting around 30 or 40,000 people
[1:18:48] that tent shaking them witch doctors
[1:18:52] cutting that feather and pointing it
[1:18:54] toward Ward me with them scissors and
[1:18:57] going through there and chanting and
[1:19:00] said they they call the storm they did
[1:19:03] it don't you never underestimate them so
[1:19:08] they called the storm and said we'll
[1:19:10] blow it away and that great big place
[1:19:13] moving up and down like that so brother
[1:19:15] man was talking about some meetings he
[1:19:17] had in Germany and how those witches and
[1:19:20] witch doctors came together and he used
[1:19:23] they used the titles of Father Son and
[1:19:25] Holy Ghost and they cut their little
[1:19:28] thing their little Wizardry you know in
[1:19:30] the US we'll laugh at that we're kind of
[1:19:32] funny we'll joke at it because we don't
[1:19:35] understand that black magic is real and
[1:19:38] demon powers are real and witches are
[1:19:41] real we're not talking about the guy out
[1:19:43] here playing games but there is a dark
[1:19:46] demonic power that the prophet of God
[1:19:49] told us about and this is why we just
[1:19:52] don't run out on the on the gospel
[1:19:54] Mission field of our own accord and go
[1:19:58] out there thinking you can just say
[1:20:01] whatever you want to and do whatever you
[1:20:03] want to and not have a life of prayer
[1:20:05] and not be called of God to do it you'll
[1:20:08] come up short because them powers are
[1:20:10] real we see it in the book of Acts we
[1:20:14] cast out Satan by the one that Paul
[1:20:16] speaking them demons turned on them
[1:20:19] quickly wrapped them up handled them
[1:20:22] kicked them out and they took off AB
[1:20:24] used so we know that the power of Satan
[1:20:27] is real and we're not glorifying him but
[1:20:31] that's the reality today is Sunday
[1:20:33] that's a reality and Satan is real
[1:20:36] that's another reality and you got to
[1:20:38] face the fact that you have a real enemy
[1:20:42] not just after us as a group but after
[1:20:45] each and every one of us as individuals
[1:20:48] you think you are a a servant of the
[1:20:51] Lord or a Christian for so many years
[1:20:53] you was born in the message or you were
[1:20:55] raised around it or you're old and wise
[1:20:59] you've seen churches split come and go
[1:21:01] or you've been in it for a long time you
[1:21:03] seen a lot don't you never ever ever
[1:21:07] underestimate Satan's power because they
[1:21:10] are real and demon powers are real and
[1:21:14] if Satan can keep you satisfied where
[1:21:17] you're at he'll let you stay there he'll
[1:21:19] take you as far as he can get you to go
[1:21:22] but if he's got you hooked up into
[1:21:24] something he'll keep you right there
[1:21:25] cold church member whatever it is and
[1:21:30] brother brandom tells us this in the
[1:21:31] message one more quote here Israel in
[1:21:33] the church and he says this here
[1:21:36] paragraph
[1:21:41] 34 just a little above that he says when
[1:21:44] Jesus come they were holy men and Jesus
[1:21:46] said you are of your father the devil
[1:21:48] said you do eror not knowing the power
[1:21:51] of God neither the word of God could you
[1:21:54] imagine the Lord Jesus Christ calling a
[1:21:57] holy righteous scholar Bible student a
[1:22:01] devil but he did now if you go back
[1:22:05] you'll find out where it come from and
[1:22:07] watch it's moving right out today in a
[1:22:09] terrible Force oh it behooves you my
[1:22:13] brother sister to consider what you're
[1:22:17] listening at and don't you never
[1:22:20] underestimate Satan's power for deceive
[1:22:25] don't you never underestimate him you
[1:22:29] can't listen to
[1:22:30] everybody come on somebody you can't
[1:22:33] hear every song you can't download every
[1:22:37] every ad somebody send you every text
[1:22:40] somebody every tape somebody send you
[1:22:43] every quotation or note that somebody
[1:22:46] sends you has to come through the filter
[1:22:49] of God's word and God did not call you
[1:22:53] to listen to every
[1:22:56] body that's why you it behooves you to
[1:22:58] consider who you're listening to because
[1:23:02] his ability to plant a seed and all he
[1:23:05] has to do is plant a seed of doubt
[1:23:09] that's it you don't have to backslide
[1:23:12] today we're not working on you to
[1:23:14] backslide today but he's looking at you
[1:23:16] in five years from today he's looking at
[1:23:18] your future he's trying to destroy you
[1:23:23] and so it behooves us to consider his
[1:23:26] tactics it's a real enemy a real devil
[1:23:28] and we don't hear it much and we don't
[1:23:30] realize it as much as we should but here
[1:23:33] on the tape tape after tape the prophet
[1:23:36] is crying out this warning to stay with
[1:23:40] the
[1:23:41] word and every few years a new doctrine
[1:23:44] starts and folks just fall off their
[1:23:46] backslide and say what was they
[1:23:48] listening to that was always in the T
[1:23:50] what was they listening to good
[1:23:53] question and so don't never
[1:23:56] underestimate the watch is moving right
[1:23:58] out in a terrible force it behooves you
[1:24:01] my brother and sister to consider what
[1:24:03] you're listening at and don't you never
[1:24:06] underestimate Satan's power for
[1:24:10] deceiving don't you never underestimate
[1:24:13] him he's smooth as he can be and the
[1:24:16] Antichrist Spirit isn't
[1:24:21] communism no the Antichrist spirit is so
[1:24:23] closed
[1:24:24] like the real thing till deceive the
[1:24:27] very elect if possible said Jesus
[1:24:30] Matthew 24 it's a religious spirit oh
[1:24:34] while Cain and Abel they were brothers
[1:24:37] The Crow and the dove sat on the same
[1:24:39] Roots Esau and Jacob were brothers Judas
[1:24:41] and Jesus was in the same church one the
[1:24:45] preacher the other one the
[1:24:47] treasurer see there's always just the
[1:24:50] deceiving of course our treasurers are
[1:24:53] Sanctified and filled with Holy Ghost
[1:24:56] and Satan told the evil was 90% truth
[1:24:59] 90% truth the lie that you can't tell
[1:25:03] how I've heard me men
[1:25:06] bypass pieces in the
[1:25:09] scripture just to keep from it hurts
[1:25:13] their theology they bypass the quotes
[1:25:15] too they bypass some of the Visions yes
[1:25:18] they do but if this part's right that's
[1:25:21] parts right let's put it together and
[1:25:24] make it fit through the whole Bible now
[1:25:28] so here that warning the prophet giving
[1:25:31] us don't ever
[1:25:34] estimate Satan's power now brother bam
[1:25:37] tells us and I brought this many times
[1:25:41] over the years it's a set of quotes on
[1:25:44] Satan's power to
[1:25:46] reason to get you the reason in fact
[1:25:50] brother brandham tells us it was what he
[1:25:53] studied the human race on it was his
[1:25:56] most beneficial his most famous attack
[1:26:00] was human
[1:26:02] reasoning it he says that it was a
[1:26:05] supernatural thought for him to catch it
[1:26:08] to use reasoning and brother bandam
[1:26:11] tells us that reasoning makes sin
[1:26:14] appealing so he's not going to come
[1:26:17] right out because he because he can't
[1:26:19] make you do anything but he can
[1:26:22] influence persuade you talk you into you
[1:26:25] talk you down how many people have been
[1:26:28] arrested and being interrogated for
[1:26:31] hours and hours and hours and hours and
[1:26:33] hours and hours and they'll get people
[1:26:35] to confess to crimes that they never
[1:26:37] committed this this just a police
[1:26:39] officer that that'll get a a young guy
[1:26:42] or young girl in the room and pressurize
[1:26:45] them so much that the nerves can't take
[1:26:47] it they're tired and they just give up
[1:26:49] and they confess and say they did
[1:26:51] something that they never did it happens
[1:26:54] all all the time what about Satan
[1:26:57] talking to you and working on
[1:27:00] you
[1:27:04] yes so this is what reasoning does what
[1:27:08] is reasoning and and remember we're
[1:27:11] talking about the three man the body the
[1:27:13] soul and the spirit the body the spirit
[1:27:15] and the soul and in that Spirit you have
[1:27:17] conscious memory reasons affections and
[1:27:19] imaginations what is reasoning this is
[1:27:21] what reasoning in because we use it
[1:27:23] every day we use it in driving we use it
[1:27:27] it to adjust our speed we use it can I
[1:27:30] take that green light or can I do this
[1:27:32] or not am I going to fall am I going to
[1:27:34] stumble should I go down this dark alley
[1:27:36] we use it all the time it's a part of
[1:27:38] being a human being and Satan sees that
[1:27:40] so he's got to use something that you're
[1:27:42] familiar with it's like a
[1:27:46] fisherman so what is reasoning reasoning
[1:27:49] is the action of thinking about
[1:27:51] something in a logical way a sens of
[1:27:54] away what's wrong with that what's wrong
[1:27:56] with that to internalize what the
[1:27:59] prophet said and say is that reasonable
[1:28:02] yeah that makes sense to me that that we
[1:28:04] do it all the time but that's the Avenue
[1:28:07] of
[1:28:07] reasoning and Satan uses it it is his
[1:28:12] most famous tactic to get you to reason
[1:28:17] with the word of God and then it's the
[1:28:21] use of Reason especially to to form
[1:28:25] conclusions we use that to form
[1:28:27] conclusions so the prophet of God tells
[1:28:30] us this in so many places I read two or
[1:28:33] three of them through the set of quotes
[1:28:35] I gave you back there says let's take
[1:28:36] this one here in the first one there in
[1:28:40] the message take on the whole armor of
[1:28:42] God paragraph
[1:28:44] 82 the prophet of God says this now
[1:28:47] notice Satan tried to get in there to
[1:28:49] spy out to see how he could get a hold
[1:28:52] of that human
[1:28:54] race and he took one of the most famous
[1:28:58] tactics will show well it showed that he
[1:29:03] had to be a supernatural power to think
[1:29:06] of it and he used this the first time
[1:29:10] and was successful and he's done it ever
[1:29:12] since and still successful to a certain
[1:29:16] estate now let me ask you something all
[1:29:18] of the controversial issues that are in
[1:29:20] the message today why are there
[1:29:23] controversial
[1:29:25] they're controversial because they don't
[1:29:27] make sense with our
[1:29:29] timeline they don't make sense with that
[1:29:32] Vision he gave in 1977 or the brown bear
[1:29:35] or the 10th Vision or the third pool
[1:29:38] they don't make sense because here we
[1:29:39] are in 2024 is not
[1:29:43] reasonable but what did the tape
[1:29:46] say what did the scripture say so I'm
[1:29:51] not in the business of explaining the
[1:29:53] word word of God but as a Believer it is
[1:29:57] my duty to say what the word
[1:30:02] says is that right Saints absolutely and
[1:30:06] Satan will come in and he'll start
[1:30:08] working on you on some reason of that
[1:30:11] doesn't make any sense you know that
[1:30:13] time has passed here we are it doesn't
[1:30:16] you know we don't need to do that
[1:30:17] anymore brother B talked marriage and
[1:30:20] divorce that's not necessary anymore and
[1:30:22] look at what they did to it foot washing
[1:30:25] not necessary anymore in many churches
[1:30:27] what about the gifts of the Spirit why
[1:30:30] do we need gifts of the Spirit in the
[1:30:31] church well because the Bible said so he
[1:30:35] put them in
[1:30:37] there why do we need a healing service
[1:30:40] when I got health care and I got a
[1:30:43] famous doctor and I got a dental plan
[1:30:46] why do I need Divine Healing what's the
[1:30:48] big deal with cutting my hair just a
[1:30:50] little bit of it what difference does it
[1:30:53] make in water baptism isn't it good
[1:30:55] enough that they're getting
[1:30:58] baptized you know what reasoning is a
[1:31:02] powerful tool that's what gets you to
[1:31:05] stop because something sounds
[1:31:09] reasonable but you got to weigh it out
[1:31:12] with God's word and God's word will
[1:31:15] always stand the test of
[1:31:17] time but there why do we need to preach
[1:31:20] the Holy Ghost today you know we got the
[1:31:22] word you don't even need this alter here
[1:31:25] what you got the alter up here for take
[1:31:27] it out take it out put it in the
[1:31:29] basement or put it out ain't nobody
[1:31:31] using it
[1:31:33] anyways we can use this space up here
[1:31:36] come on help me preach what do we got to
[1:31:39] all what do we need the Holy Ghost
[1:31:42] for huh because that's the only answer
[1:31:45] for the
[1:31:47] Rapture and I I don't care if I stop
[1:31:50] preaching it or every other Pulpit stops
[1:31:53] preaching in it it's in your Bible and
[1:31:57] it's on your tapes yes sir that
[1:32:00] authenticates it and God would always
[1:32:03] have a man or a woman that believes it
[1:32:06] do that with all my
[1:32:08] heart so he used reasoning this great
[1:32:13] power of reasoning let's take this in
[1:32:16] the message the trumpet gives an uncer
[1:32:18] sound
[1:32:19] 1963 the prophet of God says this in
[1:32:22] paragraph 121
[1:32:24] says now the enemy
[1:32:26] spy Satan tried to find out what could
[1:32:30] he do to break into that so he knowed he
[1:32:34] just couldn't come out and Bluff her so
[1:32:37] the only thing he could do was to get
[1:32:39] her on
[1:32:41] reasoning and that's what God uses today
[1:32:44] to fortify his church is his word and
[1:32:49] Satan comes around with reasoning power
[1:32:52] Satan know that that was the loophole
[1:32:55] that was the place that people would
[1:32:58] break the
[1:32:59] easiest was at
[1:33:05] reasoning yes can I go a little bit
[1:33:08] further let's take this one
[1:33:10] here in the message the way of a true
[1:33:13] prophet he says that he introduced the
[1:33:17] program of reasoning against the word
[1:33:20] being so and it sounded very
[1:33:24] logical that was in the message the way
[1:33:27] of a true Prophet but I'm going to take
[1:33:28] this one here this is in the message
[1:33:31] there's only one way provided by God
[1:33:35] 1963 paragraph 92 the prophet of God
[1:33:38] says this
[1:33:41] here one word caus every heartache every
[1:33:44] sickness every death even the coming of
[1:33:48] the Lord Jesus to die to redeem us Eve
[1:33:51] she disbelieved she just reasoned with
[1:33:54] Satan Satan reason with her well
[1:33:57] honestly God won't do it see that's
[1:34:01] Lucifer's business today you know
[1:34:04] Satan's in business Lucifer's in
[1:34:05] business that's his business right there
[1:34:09] say God can't turn us down we're too
[1:34:11] big We Stand tens of thousand million
[1:34:15] strong you think God turn us down he's
[1:34:18] sure he's already done it when you
[1:34:21] reject his word you're on the other side
[1:34:23] it isn't God turns you down you've
[1:34:26] turned God down there it is all right
[1:34:31] let me move off of this here I got one
[1:34:33] more I want to read in this and this is
[1:34:35] very important I pray that you'll hear
[1:34:37] this here paragraph 77 in the message
[1:34:41] proving his word
[1:34:44] 1964 prophet of God says this
[1:34:48] here paragraph 77
[1:34:51] Satan led her to to disbelieve it for
[1:34:56] Satan himself never did believe it he
[1:34:58] don't believe it so he led her to
[1:35:01] believe it and he still does the same
[1:35:04] thing and teaches others the same and
[1:35:07] they just believe it like she did God
[1:35:10] fortified his people behind his word
[1:35:14] that your o that's your only defense not
[1:35:16] your denomination not your father or
[1:35:18] your mother it's all right but behind
[1:35:22] God's word that's the place that the
[1:35:24] believer is protected behind the word
[1:35:28] when that little Avenue was broken there
[1:35:32] with a little wonder if it's right or
[1:35:35] not it wouldn't reasoning come in and
[1:35:38] took the place of Faith they broke the
[1:35:42] bars and God kept his God kept his word
[1:35:45] he performed it Satan tried to get her
[1:35:47] to disbelief so you see the little
[1:35:49] Avenue was broken right there and that's
[1:35:51] all he has to get the little Avenue to
[1:35:54] open up so Satan studies the human race
[1:35:58] he
[1:35:59] studies and he knows that the most
[1:36:01] famous tactic was
[1:36:06] reasoning now if he was shadowing you
[1:36:09] today um what would he what would he do
[1:36:13] in studying you do do you think he knows
[1:36:17] uh what your Temptations are he knows
[1:36:20] the flavor The Taste whatever whatever
[1:36:23] you are and he watches you and so you
[1:36:28] young Brothers know that you're supposed
[1:36:29] to turn your head on something that's
[1:36:31] ill Fame you see something that's wrong
[1:36:34] you look at it 1001 1002 turn your head
[1:36:38] 1001 100002 and some places you go just
[1:36:40] have to have your head on the
[1:36:42] swivel or put your head down or look up
[1:36:45] because there's so much
[1:36:48] craziness now I shouldn't have to have
[1:36:50] my head on a swivel In The House of the
[1:36:54] Lord I shouldn't have to come to church
[1:36:56] and I'm just like oh my good unless the
[1:36:59] sinner's trying to be
[1:37:01] saved but not amongst our sisters and
[1:37:03] our brothers right but Satan studies
[1:37:06] that and he sees that okay he's turning
[1:37:08] his head he's tur his head he's turning
[1:37:10] his head but that one took 1,1 1002 13
[1:37:14] then he turned his head
[1:37:16] H why did he take him so
[1:37:18] long let's write that down we'll make
[1:37:22] sure his new secretary or the next job
[1:37:24] he's at will drop somebody along that
[1:37:27] fits that whatever it is he studies
[1:37:31] that's what I would do that's what you
[1:37:33] would do I know there's fish in the lake
[1:37:36] I know that they live
[1:37:38] there so I'm going fishing for something
[1:37:40] that I know it's there it's just a
[1:37:41] matter of me getting them to bite what
[1:37:45] color are they biting on what part of
[1:37:48] the lake and I'm taking notes if I
[1:37:50] caught him in October then this time
[1:37:52] next year in October
[1:37:53] I'm going to be there because I'm
[1:37:56] studying the species the fish that I'm
[1:37:58] going after and Satan has studied you my
[1:38:01] brother my sister this is why for the
[1:38:03] for you know for those of us that know
[1:38:05] the word and it's the seven seal message
[1:38:09] that uncovers who Satan is that's why we
[1:38:12] know who he is the Bible says that he
[1:38:14] deceives
[1:38:16] all both small and great and many
[1:38:20] temples Tabernacles sanctuaries and
[1:38:23] religious people are worshiping him
[1:38:26] thinking they're worshiping God because
[1:38:29] his power to
[1:38:31] deceive can never be overestimated but
[1:38:35] we have we've underestimated
[1:38:39] him we haven't given him the
[1:38:43] respect of his ability to crush you if
[1:38:47] you ever get out of the the program and
[1:38:50] plan of God you know with our own power
[1:38:53] we have no power against him he's wiser
[1:38:57] than
[1:38:58] Daniel who in here could have the
[1:39:02] testimony that Daniel had no friends no
[1:39:06] church no Believers nobody to encourage
[1:39:09] him and he kept the victory in a foreign
[1:39:12] land and kept his dietary laws stayed
[1:39:15] faithful with his prayer life and had
[1:39:18] the victory in a foreign land we can
[1:39:21] barely get by if we don't have enough
[1:39:23] young people in our
[1:39:26] church who here is better than Daniel
[1:39:29] not to compare like that but he's wi sir
[1:39:32] wiser than
[1:39:34] Daniel M so with
[1:39:39] that the
[1:39:41] tempter is there to tempt us on every
[1:39:43] level on every hand we see it in Matthew
[1:39:46] that we read with our lord Jesus but
[1:39:49] then we also
[1:39:50] know there are three major things that
[1:39:55] brother Brandon says a man has to be
[1:39:58] careful
[1:39:59] of especially a minister how many know
[1:40:02] what they are huh money women and
[1:40:07] popularity which one of those would be
[1:40:09] the worst you'd
[1:40:10] say oh a brother fall with a woman he's
[1:40:15] dead in his ministry that's a death blow
[1:40:17] just pack it
[1:40:19] up up door the doors have closed
[1:40:24] that's a horrible one right but is that
[1:40:27] the worst of the
[1:40:29] three y'all ain't helping me preach this
[1:40:31] morning I give you permission to say
[1:40:35] Amen so here the prophet of God is three
[1:40:37] places I want to read for you here we
[1:40:39] all know it but I want to read it for
[1:40:41] you to bring it into the
[1:40:44] room so this is what we know that
[1:40:47] brother brandom tells us and why are
[1:40:49] people so uh tossed about in paragraph
[1:40:52] number 13
[1:40:54] he says um so I knew that usually in
[1:40:59] reading that men who get the Lord
[1:41:02] blessed them just a little bit nice
[1:41:05] little detail
[1:41:07] there nice little detail there the Lord
[1:41:10] bless a man just a little
[1:41:13] bit so he's preparing himself to go into
[1:41:16] the meetings with the ministry that
[1:41:18] nobody has had before he didn't have a
[1:41:20] contemporary to to go and compare care
[1:41:23] how they should act when an angel come
[1:41:26] in because nobody else had Angels coming
[1:41:28] to them like that he couldn't go to his
[1:41:30] Pastor Dr Davis he had to go on the
[1:41:33] field and here he's preparing to go to
[1:41:35] the battlefield and he notice in the
[1:41:37] word so brothers and sisters this is for
[1:41:41] us this is part of the armor that we put
[1:41:44] on to prepare
[1:41:47] ourselves Satan don't stop he says here
[1:41:50] usually in reading that men who get the
[1:41:53] Lord blessed him just a little bit
[1:41:56] there's about three major things that
[1:41:59] usually brings a minister to his back to
[1:42:03] the rut notice them one of them was
[1:42:06] money women popularity those three
[1:42:10] things I noticed in the scripture money
[1:42:13] was a prophet balum sold out his gift on
[1:42:16] the account of money when Bayo offer so
[1:42:18] much money many of you are acquainted
[1:42:21] with that story Samson it was to Delilah
[1:42:23] and he goes on he talks about Saul it
[1:42:25] was
[1:42:27] popularity paragraph number
[1:42:30] 18 and this is the three major causes
[1:42:35] that I see in the Bible that cause men
[1:42:38] to fall and I ask our heavenly father to
[1:42:42] please let me shun at all times at all
[1:42:47] times at all times those things as
[1:42:53] especially these three major
[1:42:58] things amen amen and had kept a covering
[1:43:02] over
[1:43:04] them I thought you saved brother bam I
[1:43:06] thought you got the Holy Ghost I thought
[1:43:08] you were believer I thought you was
[1:43:10] called of God keep a covering over
[1:43:14] it
[1:43:16] yes Lord keep it
[1:43:19] covered because these are three of the
[1:43:21] major things
[1:43:24] he tells us go a little bit further
[1:43:27] being led of the Holy Spirit Minneapolis
[1:43:30] paragraph number
[1:43:32] n9ine then after he told me and sent me
[1:43:34] into the work I knew that there would be
[1:43:37] things that we'd have to watch and one
[1:43:41] of them is money the other one's
[1:43:44] popularity and women there's three
[1:43:47] things that man falls with and
[1:43:51] ministers especially
[1:43:53] so he's talking about man and ministers
[1:43:55] especially notice in The Bible series we
[1:43:58] find out bam so he goes on just a little
[1:44:01] bit there in the message show us the
[1:44:04] father prophet of God says this
[1:44:10] here don't worry I'll preach on Grace
[1:44:12] next time and we'll all be happy
[1:44:16] okay but if you can see it this is God's
[1:44:20] grace show us the father
[1:44:23] you know safety is is under is under
[1:44:28] what did you call it it's under
[1:44:32] um you know we'll praise the hero that
[1:44:36] saves the day but you know the guy that
[1:44:38] kept you safe from getting in an
[1:44:40] accident what's it called
[1:44:43] underrated preparation and safety is as
[1:44:47] boring as the day goes by just
[1:44:49] boring until a trouble happens and then
[1:44:53] you was like oh where well I didn't have
[1:44:56] I didn't have insurance I need to back
[1:44:58] up I need to make sure I got this I got
[1:45:00] to take care of this if you did all
[1:45:02] those things every day ain't nobody
[1:45:04] gonna praise you for nothing but God
[1:45:08] gave us a way that a man can prepare
[1:45:11] himself and stay and and watch out for
[1:45:14] these
[1:45:15] things through a life of prayer sure so
[1:45:19] he says here
[1:45:25] I know there'll be a lot hooked up into
[1:45:27] this there was nobody on the field in
[1:45:30] them days and me being a Baptist coming
[1:45:32] out amongst Full Gospel people I
[1:45:34] realized what it was going to be and
[1:45:37] there was three things that I noticed in
[1:45:38] the Bible that always a minister and one
[1:45:42] of them was money the other one was
[1:45:44] popularity and women so I know that Saul
[1:45:47] fell because of popularity balum because
[1:45:49] of money Samson because of women so then
[1:45:53] I know those three things was a
[1:45:56] hindrance that we must always keep
[1:45:59] covered up and money of course would be
[1:46:02] the
[1:46:03] greatest and or trying to think you're
[1:46:08] just a little better what than somebody
[1:46:14] else so we see this
[1:46:18] Pride that
[1:46:21] Satan fell because of
[1:46:24] it and we see that the prophet of God
[1:46:28] gives a warning to men to
[1:46:31] keep these three major things covered in
[1:46:34] prayer now there is a a interesting
[1:46:38] scripture is found in Hebrews 12
[1:46:41] verse1 and it talks
[1:46:43] about the besetting sin and let's turn
[1:46:47] there quickly so we can just touch this
[1:46:49] just for a
[1:46:50] moment this is not just the everyday sin
[1:46:53] this is a a sin that constantly
[1:46:56] besets Hebrews
[1:47:01] 12:1 I think that's where it is
[1:47:03] therefore saying we also have compassed
[1:47:05] about with so great a cloud of witness
[1:47:08] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:47:12] sin which does so
[1:47:14] what easily beset us and let us run with
[1:47:19] patience the race that is set
[1:47:23] before us so brother bandam calls these
[1:47:26] the besetting
[1:47:29] sins these are the sins that they don't
[1:47:33] go away
[1:47:35] easily and he identifies Moses's temper
[1:47:40] as a besetting
[1:47:42] sin and when Satan got Moses to strike
[1:47:46] the rock twice he got into he got into
[1:47:50] his anger he got into his temper and it
[1:47:52] caught him off
[1:47:54] guard Moses loved the
[1:47:57] Lord and he loved the people of
[1:48:00] God he was trying to help these people
[1:48:04] and these people kept pushing him and
[1:48:08] pushing him and pushing
[1:48:11] him to finally he
[1:48:14] snapped I mean I feel sorry for the guy
[1:48:18] he sna got his bch water for you rebels
[1:48:25] brought us through the Red Sea gave us a
[1:48:28] token the death angel passed signs
[1:48:30] wonders and miracles food out of the
[1:48:33] heavens and yet some of y'all still
[1:48:37] upset not
[1:48:40] satisfied he
[1:48:43] cracked cracked he cracked his temper
[1:48:46] snapped on them brother random tells us
[1:48:49] here in the message Israel and the
[1:48:51] church
[1:48:56] and he was born in this world to be a
[1:48:58] deliverer just like Christ paragraph 18
[1:49:02] and oh how his work how he was a
[1:49:04] lawgiver he went up into the mountain
[1:49:06] and stayed 40 days come back out with
[1:49:08] the law and he his besetting sin was
[1:49:12] temper he broke the Commandment went
[1:49:15] back up showing that the priesthood Must
[1:49:18] Die
[1:49:20] away all right let's get into this
[1:49:22] besetting s a little bit more the
[1:49:24] message making the valley full of
[1:49:26] ditches the prophet of God says this
[1:49:28] here paragraph number 11 says drop down
[1:49:32] a little bit our heavenly father in the
[1:49:34] name of Jesus thy beloved child we come
[1:49:36] as humbly as we know how ask you for
[1:49:39] forgiveness of our sins and trespasses
[1:49:42] whatever we have did or said into this
[1:49:45] day or any other time in our life that's
[1:49:47] against us tonight we humbly bow and
[1:49:50] confess and I pray for this audience of
[1:49:53] people as they raise their hands many of
[1:49:56] them Father are maybe desperately in
[1:49:59] need of forgiveness some besetting sin
[1:50:03] some habit some sickness some disease or
[1:50:06] Affliction some loved one that's in
[1:50:08] trouble whatever it is father I pray
[1:50:11] that you forgive and forget all their

[1:50:39] what I got somebody on my side I know

[1:50:45] Satan don't like me and he don't like
[1:50:48] you either sure don't no he don't stand
[1:50:52] still paragraph 22 he says this
[1:50:55] here and it come to a place where they
[1:50:57] were totally cut off at the Red Sea
[1:51:00] seeing as if all nature quivered for
[1:51:02] them the skies could have wept
[1:51:05] everything the mountains could have
[1:51:06] shook they were in terrible condition a
[1:51:08] covenant people as you are and as we are
[1:51:12] and had come up against the blockade
[1:51:15] maybe you're there tonight maybe it's in
[1:51:18] the way maybe you got an Affliction
[1:51:21] Maybe you got to have it maybe it's some
[1:51:25] besetting sin that you can't lay
[1:51:29] down something has blocked your road and
[1:51:33] the world was looking saying now let's
[1:51:35] see how much he's going to keep his
[1:51:37] religion in this kind of a time that's
[1:51:40] the way Israel stood but Moses said
[1:51:43] stand still and see the glory of God
[1:51:45] don't get
[1:51:46] flustrated stand
[1:51:49] still praise the Lord
[1:51:52] I won't ask you I won't embarrass you
[1:51:54] but how many of you have ever had a
[1:51:56] besetting
[1:51:58] sin you know some things just Dro right
[1:52:00] off some things drop right off others
[1:52:02] struggle with it but it didn't bother me
[1:52:04] drop right off drop right off but this
[1:52:06] thing right
[1:52:08] here keeps bothering
[1:52:11] me I'm tired of it I'm sick of
[1:52:15] it you know Paul had an
[1:52:18] issue where he was looking for healing
[1:52:23] and God wouldn't heal him like in the
[1:52:26] Bible said he was the Healer why you
[1:52:28] won't heal me I sought the Lord three
[1:52:30] times I sought the Lord please Heal Me
[1:52:33] Lord Heal my eyes I can read better heal
[1:52:35] my eyes I can preach better heal my eyes
[1:52:37] I can serve you better then the Lord
[1:52:39] showed him I've allowed this on you
[1:52:44] because the abundance of
[1:52:46] Revelations I got to keep you here Paul
[1:52:50] because of the revelations you see too
[1:52:54] much and then Paul knew he put it in
[1:52:57] perspective he says now I'll glory in my
[1:53:02] afflictions by his grace his grace is
[1:53:05] sufficient for me how many need his
[1:53:07] grace I guarantee you you need his grace
[1:53:11] sometimes we think we doing it on our
[1:53:12] own we ain't doing it on our own it's
[1:53:14] his grace that's keeping us from falling
[1:53:19] back into the sin that he delivered us
[1:53:22] from
[1:53:23] from besetting sins they come back they
[1:53:27] come back to haunt you you've been
[1:53:29] prayed for come back to H come back to
[1:53:31] get you come back to get you by his
[1:53:35] grace we are saved today thank God for
[1:53:40] it
[1:53:42] yes so we know that these besetting sins
[1:53:45] they
[1:53:46] exist
[1:53:48] huh try to lay them down they don't
[1:53:50] leave like that
[1:53:53] brother Bram says greater is the power
[1:53:55] of Christ that's than that little
[1:53:58] besetting sin that you can't
[1:54:00] overcome let's take the Holy Spirit and
[1:54:03] fight the devil down walk out Victorious
[1:54:07] as the heroes of the Cross let us pray
[1:54:11] that was in the message the Oneness of
[1:54:16] unity
[1:54:17] amen got two or three more on that the
[1:54:20] setting sin but we'll move on just a
[1:54:22] little a little bit I just want to show
[1:54:23] you that you know even with the real
[1:54:27] adversary a real devil then you got the
[1:54:30] real
[1:54:32] you
[1:54:33] problems the issues that are in
[1:54:36] you that you you will self-destruct all
[1:54:39] by yourself did you know that you got
[1:54:42] the you got the ingredients to do it you
[1:54:44] will fall back you will fail it's in you
[1:54:48] it's in your Fallen nature it's in your
[1:54:51] DNA it's
[1:54:54] there but when God Saves you we now he
[1:54:57] now gives us the
[1:54:59] blood to
[1:55:01] overcome these weakness these weaknesses
[1:55:04] and so forth so here brother bandam
[1:55:07] deals with something here see if I have
[1:55:10] time to get into this yes he deals with
[1:55:12] this in the message Christ is revealed
[1:55:14] in his own word now he's talking about
[1:55:17] the neurotics of the age how this age is
[1:55:22] en entirely
[1:55:24] nervous they have this oppression upon
[1:55:27] the
[1:55:29] age he calls it tensions brother bandam
[1:55:32] calls them it's in the message Christ
[1:55:34] was revealed in his own word paragraph
[1:55:37] number 18 I was just talking to a young
[1:55:38] Minister and his wife in the room just a
[1:55:41] few moments ago and both of them are
[1:55:43] nervous just like the rest of the world
[1:55:47] rest of the human beings on Earth I said
[1:55:50] remember Satan's God A Punch coming at
[1:55:54] you don't care who you
[1:55:59] are he's got a right for that one
[1:56:05] punch which would you had it rather be
[1:56:07] that punch be blind or be an arthritic
[1:56:09] setting in a chair or be nervous see
[1:56:12] he's got somewhere he can punch you he's
[1:56:16] got a right to that open
[1:56:19] place now that's the spot you got to
[1:56:22] keep covered all the
[1:56:26] time and to see this nervous age that
[1:56:28] we're living in and last week's tap I
[1:56:31] think we'll reveal it to you the great
[1:56:33] hideous things that we're going to speak
[1:56:35] on in these days when we can get a place
[1:56:38] sufficient of the opening of those last
[1:56:41] plagues to be poured out upon the Earth
[1:56:43] those vows rather pouring out of the
[1:56:46] vows in the seven Thunders and those
[1:56:48] hideous sights that's coming upon the
[1:56:51] Earth
[1:56:53] man now and people today are in such a
[1:56:57] nervous condition the whole
[1:57:01] world he goes on further in that same
[1:57:03] message and he's dealing with the
[1:57:05] imagination of men that they would be
[1:57:09] tormented they'd be tormenting
[1:57:11] themselves he goes deeper and talks
[1:57:13] about how the hybrid foods have caused
[1:57:17] this you know the food today it's not
[1:57:20] about nutrition now they've supercharged
[1:57:23] it with something else it's the
[1:57:26] experience it's the class it's the it's
[1:57:29] the
[1:57:30] notori it's on the you know what's it
[1:57:32] social media not not political media not
[1:57:35] the media outside but my
[1:57:38] media social media and it's all around
[1:57:42] what we're eating this this is
[1:57:45] interesting how Satan will use
[1:57:49] that and supercharge it but brother M is
[1:57:52] you got to keep that spot covered in
[1:57:54] prayer so Satan got an open shot at you
[1:57:58] like you can't brace for it you can't
[1:58:00] cover your face for it he gets one solid
[1:58:03] knock against your
[1:58:05] Noggin right in the face he got a spot
[1:58:08] to hit you he has a right brother random
[1:58:14] says have you taking that punch
[1:58:17] yet that's a real
[1:58:21] question are you taking it
[1:58:25] now or is that punch coming up the road
[1:58:27] for you the this is real information for
[1:58:30] you Satan does not want to be exposed he
[1:58:33] does not want to be uncovered and really
[1:58:36] he has something that he's trying to
[1:58:38] achieve through you now Satan wants you
[1:58:43] to do something he wants something from
[1:58:47] you remember let's go back to our text
[1:58:51] when he's talking to Jesus he showed him
[1:58:54] the kingdoms of the world in a moment's
[1:58:56] time like maybe it was an app he can
[1:59:00] download and just show it like you can
[1:59:02] see the world in a moment's time just go
[1:59:05] look but Satan took him up to a high
[1:59:07] place showed them the kingdoms of the
[1:59:09] world in the glory of them he said I'll
[1:59:11] give it to you because it's been given
[1:59:14] me the power to give it to whoever I
[1:59:17] choose I've always wondered about this
[1:59:23] I've always wondered about this
[1:59:26] um you know how Satan's kingdoms work
[1:59:29] the Bible says that Satan cannot cast
[1:59:32] out Satan or his kingdom would be
[1:59:34] divided how there's even a Unity amongst
[1:59:36] that but you know you know in the rap
[1:59:39] industry or rock and roll or rhythm and
[1:59:42] blues or country resting or whatever
[1:59:45] worldly music you'll always have you
[1:59:48] know just the neighborhood guys and the
[1:59:50] local guys and the regional guys and
[1:59:52] then you'll have a
[1:59:54] superstar that like transcends all Races
[1:59:57] cultures and
[1:59:59] everybody it's like everybody wants that
[2:00:02] everybody wanted to be a Michael Jackson
[2:00:05] or Elvis Presley or the
[2:00:08] Beatles who who gives one the power and
[2:00:11] the ability to
[2:00:13] excel in their anointing in their
[2:00:16] notoriety and their
[2:00:18] Fame Everybody Wants To Be A Tailor
[2:00:21] Swift
[2:00:23] some of y'all probably got her music
[2:00:25] downloaded that's yeah no sir nobody
[2:00:28] here do praise the Lord delete delete
[2:00:33] delete yeah but who who gives these
[2:00:35] people this
[2:00:36] anointing what do they get it from they
[2:00:39] all wanted they all in the studio they
[2:00:40] all putting in work who gives some this
[2:00:43] ability to rise above the other and so
[2:00:46] now now everybody underneath that they
[2:00:50] look ascribe to that everybody wanted to
[2:00:52] be a Michael Jackson or the latest rap
[2:00:54] group or whatever I can call them out
[2:00:56] there and the little little guys in the
[2:00:58] neighborhood I had a little rap
[2:01:03] group you see what I'm doing today
[2:01:05] though don't you it that didn't work out
[2:01:08] for me did
[2:01:09] it praise the
[2:01:13] Lord but everybody's quoting that music
[2:01:16] Corner think you're a star think you're
[2:01:17] this in the mirror trying to do why do
[2:01:19] some achieve and others don't Satan's
[2:01:21] got got the
[2:01:22] power he's got the power the Bible says
[2:01:25] so and here we see it clearly when he
[2:01:28] comes to job in the worship meeting he
[2:01:33] wanted job but he couldn't have job
[2:01:36] until God said go get
[2:01:39] him till God dropped the protection off
[2:01:42] of him oh my
[2:01:45] goodness if you ever can give God praise
[2:01:48] for his grace and mercy to keep you
[2:01:52] you ought to be the most grateful and
[2:01:54] thankful that you're not caught up into
[2:01:56] some foolishness because if he moves his
[2:01:59] hand off of you there go your family
[2:02:02] there go your husband there goes your
[2:02:04] marriage there goes your morality all of
[2:02:08] it if God's
[2:02:11] Grace isn't there to keep you
[2:02:14] covered so what does he tell us to do in
[2:02:17] his word he tells us wherefore put put
[2:02:22] on the whole armor of God put it all
[2:02:26] on put on the helmet of
[2:02:29] salvation that you are
[2:02:32] saved put on the breastplate of his
[2:02:38] righteousness I think is Psalms 27 I
[2:02:41] quote it every morning every Sunday
[2:02:43] morning as I'm
[2:02:45] preparing it talks about how he the the
[2:02:49] false Witnesses are risen up against
[2:02:51] against me Lord lead me into a plain
[2:02:56] path because of my enemies and this
[2:02:59] these paths and these Pathways that you
[2:03:02] go down it's like the Lord delivered you
[2:03:05] from this anger this temper this lust
[2:03:08] and all the things of the world and he
[2:03:10] puts you on a plain path called
[2:03:11] salvation The Road to Glory but then
[2:03:15] Satan comes in the pathway now to get
[2:03:17] you to open up one of them Gates
[2:03:21] to go down the neighborhood path just
[2:03:25] for a little
[2:03:27] while and that's his job he's the
[2:03:30] tempter he's the wicked one he's behind
[2:03:34] it all it's not my brother it's not my
[2:03:37] sister it's the devil that gets in
[2:03:40] between my brother and my sister that's
[2:03:44] right that's right and we see this
[2:03:47] discourse with job I'll take a few
[2:03:50] moments on this
[2:03:53] amen I'll leave job alone just for a
[2:03:55] minute let's take our lord Jesus that
[2:03:57] was a scripture I read
[2:03:59] this this morning so the prophet of God
[2:04:03] takes this
[2:04:05] message the Harvest
[2:04:08] Time and he says in paragraph 107 let's
[2:04:11] take this quickly all right my time is
[2:04:16] almost gone not gone yet but it's almost
[2:04:19] gone in the Harvest Time paragraph 1 107
[2:04:22] I don't have it here sis so if you can
[2:04:24] just throw it up there as soon as you
[2:04:25] get
[2:04:27] it yes remember the Bible said in the
[2:04:29] mouth of three Witnesses let every word
[2:04:32] be established we'll get on that in a
[2:04:34] few minutes look at this the three
[2:04:37] Temptations of Jesus the three
[2:04:40] Temptations of ministers today where
[2:04:44] they make their fall the three
[2:04:46] Temptations of the church and where they
[2:04:48] make their fall three Temptations of the
[2:04:52] organization where it makes its fall and
[2:04:55] the three Temptations in the what in
[2:05:00] individuals and where they make their
[2:05:02] fall now it all runs in threes so
[2:05:05] brother bam is now taking this uh
[2:05:09] dialogue with Jesus and Satan and he
[2:05:12] breaks it down uh to the temptation of
[2:05:15] Jesus ministers Church organizations and
[2:05:18] individuals and there's three
[2:05:20] Temptations and he deals with it the
[2:05:23] first Temptation brother brandom says in
[2:05:26] paragraph 147 in the Harvest time now
[2:05:30] closely confined this now now he finally
[2:05:33] this one that would arrive and had to be
[2:05:35] tempted just exactly like the rest of
[2:05:38] them was tempted now notice how striking
[2:05:42] Satan makes his every attack just the
[2:05:46] same each
[2:05:48] time he tried to give him the natural
[2:05:51] bread just like he did Eve if you'll eat
[2:05:54] this and take this or something another
[2:05:57] he's got it and that's what he does to
[2:05:59] every organization that's what he does
[2:06:01] to every individual he tries to give you
[2:06:04] the natural things that you can look
[2:06:08] at he wants you to eat something besides
[2:06:13] the word that's his first tactic here
[2:06:17] let me move on just a little bit I want
[2:06:18] you to get that message you get a chance
[2:06:20] and hear it for yourself preach right in
[2:06:22] Phoenix December
[2:06:25] 1964 preaching right in Phoenix and then
[2:06:28] the second temptation is this paragraph
[2:06:31] 2112 he says this here I want you to
[2:06:35] watch this and I'm going to close here
[2:06:36] in about 10 minutes I'll try to finish
[2:06:38] right at noon okay is that okay Saints
[2:06:42] all
[2:06:43] right notice if Satan fails here then
[2:06:46] he'll try his second scheme look at your
[2:06:50] neighbor and say second scheme
[2:06:53] all y'all didn't look look at him tell
[2:06:56] him his his who we talking about your
[2:07:00] enemy his second scheme first he try to
[2:07:03] get you to take something that's not the
[2:07:04] word notice Satan fails here then he
[2:07:07] tries his second scheme on you get you
[2:07:11] to disbelieve the word and go to the
[2:07:13] Seminary he'll try his next scheme now
[2:07:16] here is where you want to be real
[2:07:18] careful just sit just for another five
[2:07:21] minutes minutes on this part if you will
[2:07:23] then he makes you a
[2:07:26] supernatural offer I'm going to come
[2:07:29] back to all this just before closing if
[2:07:32] he can't tempt you away from the word no
[2:07:34] I'm going to stay with the word then
[2:07:36] he'll give you a
[2:07:39] supernatural
[2:07:43] offer I tell you you get up there dive
[2:07:45] off the temple bring it back up see show
[2:07:48] the people that you can do something
[2:07:50] Supernatural boy he got him there watch
[2:07:53] this watch when he get this in where the
[2:07:55] Temptation come maybe he might let some
[2:07:58] of you speak in tongues think you got it
[2:08:00] or he might even let you prophesy though
[2:08:02] it not be with the word I've seen people
[2:08:04] stand up prophesy was contrary to the
[2:08:07] word as East is from West see it's the
[2:08:10] word that you live by them Supernatural
[2:08:14] gifts Satan can just hand them out by
[2:08:19] handfuls they don't mean one thing who
[2:08:21] who can hand them
[2:08:22] out huh Satan can hand out Supernatural
[2:08:27] gifts by
[2:08:30] handfuls hand them to people gift to
[2:08:32] sing gift to inspire they go out here
[2:08:36] and cut a deal and get in business and
[2:08:39] get greater and greater inspired by a
[2:08:42] gift that should be used in the church
[2:08:44] but they they misappropriated and Satan
[2:08:47] can hand those out by
[2:08:50] handfuls and and
[2:08:52] then brother bam tells us this is where
[2:08:55] Eve was carried away in her
[2:08:59] Supernatural understanding that was a
[2:09:01] supernatural offer when he offered her
[2:09:04] reasoning against the word it looked
[2:09:07] like a common conversation but it was a
[2:09:09] supernatural
[2:09:11] conversation that he was inspiring her
[2:09:15] to disbelieve God's word what about
[2:09:18] today now let's take this last one here
[2:09:22] the third one is found in paragraph
[2:09:26] number
[2:09:27] 29 now Satan's third scheme we'll get to
[2:09:31] it quickly because we don't want to take
[2:09:32] more time than possible maybe another 15
[2:09:35] 20
[2:09:35] minutes if you want to go that far
[2:09:37] notice his third scheme his third
[2:09:40] Temptations If the others had failed
[2:09:44] this one won't he now offers you a
[2:09:49] position in the church
[2:09:56] you know positions in the church is
[2:09:58] always a touchy touchy
[2:10:01] spot who's next in
[2:10:05] charge who's more important than I'm
[2:10:08] important but I'm more important than
[2:10:10] which one are you are you number two or
[2:10:12] number
[2:10:15] 32 come on
[2:10:17] somebody y'all not helping me this
[2:10:19] morning it's all right but but it's
[2:10:21] still the truth this is a prophet now he
[2:10:23] said he says I'll give you the world
[2:10:26] you'll be a king I'll make you an offer
[2:10:28] if this one failed this one if others
[2:10:30] fail this one won't he now offers you a
[2:10:32] position in the church like he did Jesus
[2:10:38] I'll give you the world you'll be the
[2:10:40] king I'll make you they all belong to me
[2:10:43] so I give it to you now this offering of
[2:10:47] a
[2:10:49] position is where Satan fell by
[2:10:53] and when he inspires
[2:10:55] you inspires us he wants to inspire Us
[2:11:00] in that realm to make us better than
[2:11:04] someone else to have us even more
[2:11:08] anointed than God
[2:11:11] himself we can actually we'll actually
[2:11:14] we're actually doing it of Our Own
[2:11:16] Strength our own
[2:11:19] power and it Satan all along inspiring
[2:11:22] that
[2:11:23] thought that I am better than the our
[2:11:27] church is better than their Church our
[2:11:30] church shows more love than their our
[2:11:33] church has more anointing have you heard
[2:11:35] our choir sing our praise and worship is
[2:11:37] on what about our musicians and know we
[2:11:39] got the baddest musicians in this city
[2:11:42] that's us yeah yeah come hear us a got
[2:11:45] nobody praise like we could praise you
[2:11:47] hear our pastor
[2:11:51] right he's good he can preach got to
[2:11:53] come hear him ain't nobody preach like
[2:11:57] him position yeah those other churches
[2:12:00] there are brothers but we're above them
[2:12:03] a position he offers if the other two
[2:12:06] don't don't don't fail this one will not
[2:12:09] fail and it's showing us how Satan comes
[2:12:12] to Jesus the organizations to ministers
[2:12:16] to the
[2:12:18] individual and we're trying to uncover
[2:12:20] him
[2:12:21] this is why Ephesians 6 is not a
[2:12:23] scripture you read once it's not
[2:12:26] something that weering just some words
[2:12:28] or a play that the kids are going to
[2:12:29] play out here these are actually the
[2:12:32] dress wear for the believer that he's
[2:12:35] got to put on in prayer in prayer each
[2:12:40] piece of equipment has to equip That Man
[2:12:44] helmet of salvation breastplate of right
[2:12:47] Spirit of Truth sword of the spirit
[2:12:49] Shield to block all the fiery
[2:12:52] darts does the devil ever throw any
[2:12:55] fiery darts at you anointed thoughts
[2:12:59] anointed catch you in a dream catch you
[2:13:02] at work catch you out of nowhere anoint
[2:13:04] a thought and throw it at you you got to
[2:13:07] have the shield of faith my
[2:13:09] brother you got to pick up your faith
[2:13:11] Shield say in the name of Jesus think
[2:13:15] all these things put the tapes on pick
[2:13:17] up your Bible go to God In Prayer cuz
[2:13:21] this my brother and sister you got to be
[2:13:23] able to stand in the evil day and this
[2:13:26] is the evil day no question about
[2:13:30] it it's what does he want from us he
[2:13:34] wants your praise your worship if he
[2:13:36] can't get you to praise and worship him
[2:13:38] that's what he wanted Jesus to do then
[2:13:41] he wants to use you to curse God to say
[2:13:45] things that's not in the
[2:13:48] word remember he got Peter to
[2:13:52] CSE remember that Spirit came on Peter
[2:13:55] and caused him to say something that was
[2:13:58] not in the word and Jesus rebuked him
[2:14:00] remember that it's in 1954 I don't know
[2:14:03] the message I just got it quoted here
[2:14:06] 1954 May the 16th paragraph number three
[2:14:10] he said a spirit it was a spirit that
[2:14:13] was on the apostle that was making him
[2:14:16] say that when he rebuked Jesus time to
[2:14:19] Remember When yeah uh Peter rebuked
[2:14:23] Jesus when he was talking about he had
[2:14:24] to go suffer at the cross Peter rebuked
[2:14:27] him and Jesus turned around and rebuke
[2:14:32] Satan
[2:14:33] uhhuh now what does Satan want from
[2:14:38] you well if we'll just take a few
[2:14:41] scriptures I'll reference them and maybe
[2:14:43] we'll get to them another time my time
[2:14:45] is
[2:14:46] gone what he wants from
[2:14:50] you he can't have it but he wants it
[2:14:56] anyway he wanted to sift Peter as
[2:15:01] wheat the Lord looked at Peter just like
[2:15:04] this
[2:15:06] I I mean that would have shook me up I
[2:15:08] think if I would have really really
[2:15:09] internalized he says Peter Satan
[2:15:14] desires to sift you as wheat you know
[2:15:18] what the sifting of the wheat is you
[2:15:20] have the whole wheat grain the whole
[2:15:21] stock it grows up it's got the whole
[2:15:24] plant the leaves and everything when
[2:15:26] that thing comes to maturity the head of
[2:15:28] the wheat kind of bowels over and
[2:15:30] there's a little wheat what they call a
[2:15:31] wheat berry or the wheat grain in there
[2:15:33] you can hear it rattle like that how me
[2:15:35] know what I'm talking about it's mature
[2:15:37] wheat it's grain it's it's in there but
[2:15:40] you got to get it out of there and so
[2:15:42] you beat it you break it down you put it
[2:15:44] through a process and then you got you
[2:15:46] know you get it separated from the stock
[2:15:49] and then you have to get the
[2:15:51] shaft so you they throw that thing up
[2:15:54] and then the Wind Blows the shaft off of
[2:15:56] that's a process it continues to happen
[2:15:59] and Satan desires to sift you Peter as
[2:16:04] wheat but but I pray for
[2:16:10] you I pray for you and he can't have you
[2:16:14] aren't you so glad that he prayed for
[2:16:16] you that's the only thing you got goingn
[2:16:19] for you
[2:16:21] is that he loves you and he built a
[2:16:25] hedge about you that Satan can't get you
[2:16:29] until God says it's your time to go but
[2:16:34] he desires you he'll hinder you he'll
[2:16:36] trip you up he's after you he's trying
[2:16:38] to tempt you trying to get you and with
[2:16:40] all the weaknesses that you have
[2:16:42] inherently he's still there's a real
[2:16:44] enemy after you but Peter I pray for
[2:16:48] you I pray for you
[2:16:51] and if Jesus prayed for
[2:16:53] me you think he'll hear his own
[2:16:58] prayer
[2:16:59] amen I got to make it who prayed for you
[2:17:03] Jesus prayed for me he prayed and I
[2:17:05] forget the scripture there that those
[2:17:07] that would come into the he prayed for
[2:17:09] these but not these alone but those that
[2:17:11] would believe their
[2:17:13] word a prayer way out to
[2:17:17] 2024 Jesus prayer caught you this
[2:17:20] catching you today Jesus prayed for you
[2:17:24] but he can't have you because I pray for
[2:17:28] you don't you love the Lord thank God
[2:17:31] for his goodness to
[2:17:33] us you know they they did this I'll just
[2:17:37] drop this in because I looked it up a
[2:17:39] little bit brother brandom takes the
[2:17:41] message a thinky man's filter that we
[2:17:43] heard on Wednesday a portion of
[2:17:45] it and he talked about how the tobacco
[2:17:48] companies how they came up with the
[2:17:51] slogan so I started to look back a
[2:17:53] little bit how they um they lied to the
[2:17:57] American public as you know there's a a
[2:17:59] gentleman Mike Bloomberg that has this
[2:18:02] organization it's called stop that's
[2:18:04] where I got some of the information that
[2:18:06] he talks
[2:18:07] about and from early in the 50s they
[2:18:09] knew that this drug was
[2:18:12] addictive but because of greed and
[2:18:14] because of the money they kept lying and
[2:18:16] pushing it to the people and it came up
[2:18:19] with the slogans in the filter and the
[2:18:21] filter was a feminist type of thing so
[2:18:24] the Marboro company comes up with a
[2:18:26] master plan and they create this Cowboy
[2:18:30] ain't nothing more tough than a cowboy
[2:18:32] brother Rick than a cowboy with the
[2:18:35] filter cigarette and it went into the
[2:18:37] billion they 300 times the sales
[2:18:40] went it was all around greed and money
[2:18:45] and many of the CEOs don't smoke but
[2:18:47] they'll they'll sell it to people it's
[2:18:49] all about greed and money but Satan was
[2:18:52] behind that how he attached himself
[2:18:57] through brother bam called it a nicotine
[2:19:00] devil that's what he called it it was on
[2:19:02] the tape here it's a devil called
[2:19:04] nicotine but this company now because of
[2:19:07] money because of greed they are
[2:19:09] instruments of Satan and they lied and
[2:19:11] lied and they got that to the people got
[2:19:14] everybody hooked on it and they they
[2:19:16] made it smoother they added mint flavors
[2:19:19] they did all these things things to it
[2:19:21] they made it go right into your your
[2:19:23] mental faculties quicker so you can be
[2:19:26] satiated and then you have to have
[2:19:28] another one and then you're hooked on it
[2:19:30] and the Food and Drug Administration the
[2:19:32] food companies have done the same
[2:19:35] thing it's not about
[2:19:37] nutrition it's about hooking you on
[2:19:40] something so they can keep their pockets
[2:19:44] full and if marijuana is wrong and we
[2:19:48] believe it is what about all the other
[2:19:50] the
[2:19:52] drugs
[2:19:55] huh he's a
[2:19:57] master in his lies and his deceit and
[2:20:02] that drug that Tobacco Company lied to
[2:20:05] the people and they continue to lie till
[2:20:08] today they say it's less harmful less
[2:20:11] tar they got these heated pro pro you
[2:20:14] know the vaping products that out there
[2:20:17] it's still the same devil
[2:20:21] but it just looks like a business to me
[2:20:23] an American Business I mean everybody's
[2:20:25] free to make their own choices right
[2:20:28] right we're free to make our own choices
[2:20:30] that businessman just looking after his
[2:20:32] family not he didn't hurt nobody he
[2:20:35] didn't put nobody on cancer it's just my
[2:20:36] business I'm just own a tobacco farm not
[2:20:39] knowing that Satan is inspired
[2:20:42] it the prophet picked it up and catches
[2:20:45] it and then he ties in this food the
[2:20:48] hybrid food with the mental oppressions
[2:20:51] that we have
[2:20:53] today everybody has lost their mind or
[2:20:56] losing it and everybody's hooked on
[2:20:59] something but you need to get hooked on
[2:21:02] Jesus because he is the original
[2:21:06] lifegiver and he
[2:21:09] satisfies a man in his
[2:21:12] soul if you can just only get that
[2:21:15] filter of his word God bless you God
[2:21:18] bless you stand
[2:21:21] with your loins Girt with truth stand
[2:21:24] with the sword stand with the word of
