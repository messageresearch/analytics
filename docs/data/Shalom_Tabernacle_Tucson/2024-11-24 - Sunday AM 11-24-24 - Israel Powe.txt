blood before him Beyond the Veil now Joseph down into Egypt he goes and there he was exalted from his prison to the right hand of pharaoh and was made the caretaker and everything prospered in the days of Joseph now when Jesus returns even the desert shall Blossom like a Roose Hallelujah is the son of prosperity type of Joseph they put Joseph in uh the general had him in his house everything he done he prospered they put him in jail and the whole jail prospered everything they done he prospered and when he exalted the highest and Pharaoh next to Pharaoh everything in Egypt prospered above

shall the dead Christ everything will bow to the every knee shall bow in every tongue shall confess start now some man sins go before some follow but now notice what taking place how glorious when Joseph stand after he married a gentile and received a family ephra and Manasses his son did you notice at the end when Joseph Jacob started to bless Ephraim and Manasses when he started to put his hands he put Ephraim on the right Manasses on the left to get the right hand blessing the oldest but when he started to pray his hands crossed and he gave the youngest one the right hand blessing instead of the one that was on the right hand and Joseph said not so father said you have put the blessing on Manasses instead of all the ephra and he said God has crossed my hands what from the Jews the oldest the first CH of God through the cross come the blessing back to the Gentiles to get the [Applause] bride blessing come to the cross from the Jew to the Gentile rejected they rejected the cross therefore he got the Gentile bride now when Joseph before this when he was heard of his Brethren who they had been out of Fellowship for many years the Jew now watch we're getting back to Zachariah now where they whale and mourn wail and even families will separate themselves from other families how did we do it how could we have ever done it they say where did you get them scarved then prince in your hands even those that pierced him he'll come in the clouds and they'll see him even those who pierc every house will mourn and they were waale they w't know what to do and when Joseph you know the story when he seen his brothers and he make out like he couldn't speak Hebrew got the interpretator to interpret farm and he couldn't speak Hebrew act like but he wanted to find out and when finally one day when they brought his little brother did you notice it was Benjamin set jph to of fire what is it today let's go to S to of Fire our Joseph Jesus that young church has been down in Iran now has kept the Commandments of God and the newborn people is gaed into Palestine and restored back again that's six point star of David the oldest flag in the world a nation has been born in the last few years there's Israel nations are breaking Israel Awakening the signs that the Bible foretold the Gentile days numbered with horrow encumbered return oh dispers to your own the day of redemption is near man's hearts are failing for Fears look at the be filled with the spirit your L trimmed and clear look up your Redemption is near Hallelujah false prophets are lying

hearts are failing for fear be filled with God's spirit your L and clear look up your Redemption is near oh Joseph when you seen little Benjamin sing there that's his little brother you see little Benjamin out over sitting over there the tribes of the earth of the Jews return back there where there be 144,000 sent there to receive Christ when the them coming they'll say oh this is our God who we waited on then they'll see the Pierce where of these comes he said in the house of my friend and they'll whale cry each family the CRI of David and neph all will separate themselves he spaming wheat to themselves when they seem standing in the air the one they pierced what will his message be watch what Joseph said when he said watch another thing when Joseph got the children before him he looked at him he seen little Benjamin he seen ephra he seen the rest of them there the Gad and all of them and the 12 tribes the 10 tribes then standing before him you seen them all stand there he knew they were his brother and he looked at little Benjamin re his stroat begin to fill out who knew that was his what did he say let every man leave me what happened to his wife and children they went into the palace or will the Gentile Church go the Rapture in to the Palace the bride Hallelujah the bride will be taken off the Earth in the Rapture then when he returns his bride isn't there when he makes himself known to his Brethren the Jews those who pierced him those who rejected him but his wife and his loveed and his close friends there his his own God sent companions as in the temple and when he looked he said they were they didn't know they said oh this great Prince they begin to say one to another about these things what they had done I think it was Ephraim or not Ephraim but I forget which one it was now that that said well U we ought not to killed our brother Joseph said you see we're getting paid back reuben reuben said we ought not to have killed our brother said because you see we're getting paid back for what we've done and Joseph said I didn't think you could understand he Hebrew but he noce some things KS understand speaking in tongues but he knows all about it you know the Gentile kingdom come in with speaking in tongues and interpretations in the head of gold the first head before it fell what ended that first Gentile dispensation a handwriting of unknown tongues on the wall and a man there could interpret and tell what it was it goes out the same way amen in and goes out the same way they thought he couldn't understand them tongues that he speaking but he know it they said you see what we got and Joseph then seen their sorry for what they had done now he sees their sorrow and regret for rejecting him so he choking up in his throat now he's ready to dismiss his church from the earth take her into glory amen then return in the all the tries of the earth shorn what did they do Reuben all of them begin to cry they said oh oh they fear they said this is him now we know we're in part now he will kill us now he we know that we're going to be destroyed right now because that is Joseph has been away from us so long that's Joseph our brother now we're really in for it he said don't be angry with yourself God did this to preserve life amen what did God do why did the Jews reject Jesus so that we Gentiles so that the people be called out for his name sake God did it to preserve the life of the Gentile church right all the tribes who rejected him were mourn they'll hide themselves in and rocks and things they H fall on his Mountain they rejected him all the kinds of the Earth shall whail because of them and each family and Israel there will separate themselves families will separate one from the other and say why did we do it how did we come to rejected how there he stands there's a God who we waited for and there he is with nail prints in his hands and we did it that's exactly what them brother said right down there when they come back and said there's Joseph who we sold he said I'm Joseph your brother who you sold into Egypt oh they were scared and they mourning and wailing and run to one another what can't we do he said don't be angry with yourselves because God did this all God sent me a head God created all man white man black man brown man yellow man every man God created every man he created the Gentile Creed the Jew he created all it's all for his glory and the Jews had to be rejected in order to take a gentile bride that's the reason all these types are so the Gentile bride and her offsprings with her that glorious Pentecostal Church washed in the blood of the Lamb with all the power of the Resurrection living in him will rise someday in the Rapture a moment in a twinkling of an eye the gold be in the presence of Jesus while he returns back and dismisses everything to make himself known to his brother watch what the scripture says here in closing oh behold he cometh with clouds and every I shall see now he's talk about the second coming not the Rapture and they also which Pierce him seventh chapter the first ver uh seventh verse of this first chapter every eye shall see him and they also which pierc him and all the kinds of the Earth shall wail because of him even so amen then he gives that great great quotation who is this who is this J go far I am Alpha and Omega I'm A and Z amen the Greek A and Z Greek alphabet acts 236 Peter said there's not another name given under Heaven whereby man must be saved or no I beg your pardon M qu he said let all the house of Israel know surely that God has made this same Jesus who you crucified both Lord in Christ John 147 and12 Thomas said Lord show us the father is satisfied said I've been so long with you you don't know me said he that seen me has seen the father why I say th show me the father I am a father a one am I said that one time to a person a lady said just a minute Mr Ram said you and your wife are one two I said but not that kind she said I beg your pardon I said do you see me she said I do I said you see my wife she said no I said then they're a different kind he said when you seen me you have seen the father so that was enough for that so in St John or first John 57 to8 you always put it down 1 John 578 the Bible said the speaker the very same man that wrote this Revelation that Jesus giving he said there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word the word is the son the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one there are three that bear record in earth water blood and spirit and they agree not are one but they agree in one you cannot have the father without having the son you cannot have father or some without having the Holy Ghost right but you and water blood and spirit that's the elements it takes to get into his body when a natural birth takes place what's the first thing happens when a woman giving birth to a baby first thing is water second thing is blood that right next thing is Spirit the baby touches the breath start breathing water blood and spirit that constitutes the natural birth also the spiritual birth water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ justification by faith believing on the Lord Jesus Christ water what's the next blood sanctification cleaning up getting around elsewhere you NZ people failed you just went that far and didn't go no farther the vessel is Sanctified on the altar ready for service but not in service blessed are they Beatitudes are hunger and thirst for Rising for they shall be still amen the vessel is Sanctified that's true that's like the Virgin the word virgin means pure holy un adulterated Sanctified five had oil and five did not five was sealed and the other just remain in sanctification have you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe you Baptist Presbyterian we don't know where any Holy Ghost and how was you baptized after he ra these hands upon them they were then after being saved and Sanctified they were filled with the Holy Ghost Lord right water blood spirit Jesus come to wash and to cleanse and to sanctify church that he might come and live in with his own blood he gave his own God born blood that he might cleanse us from our sexual birth and give to us a Sanctified holy vessel that he himself might come a little while the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me because I personal pronoun will be with you even in you to the end of the consummation amen all the way through I'll be with you and in the works that I do shall you do also these sign shall follow and believe God in the church hallelujah oh my deity there are three that bear record in heaven father word son Holy Ghost they are one now you can be saved without being Sanctified you can be Sanctified not have the Holy Ghost right Sanctified Spirit without being filled sanctifying your heart cleansing your heart without filling it with something that's what he said when the unclean spirit's gone out of him man he walks in dry places comes back finds his house all garnished he comes in last the state of that person many times seven times worse than it was at the first that's what happened to you Pilgrim Holiness nazarin and so forth you accepted and when the Holy Ghost come begin to speak in tongues and give signs wers you called the devil and blasphemed the works

sister back here in the back here just each of you all together make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations isn't that nice says Make a Joyful Noise not a mournful noise not any kind of noise but a joyful noise noise for the Lord is good Romans chapter 7 is where we'll take our text for a Thanksgiving message it's the same message the prophet took when he brought the message the invisible Union of the bride of Christ in verses number 1-6 we'll turn there know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead so if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that ye should be married to another even to him who raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law somebody say praise the Lord praise the Lord that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter amen may God add a blessing to the reading of his word title of the message this morning is Thanksgiving in the Golden Age a Thanksgiving in the golden a age God bless you you may be seated now this scripture in Romans chapter 7 as the prophet brings it to us that was a Thanksgiving text that he took in the message invisible Union of the bride of Christ and this is one of the latter messages that he preached a series there in shreport 1965 of November he took the invisible Union works his faith expressed trying to do God a service without it being his will I've heard but now I see God's only provided place of worship and on the wings of a snow white dove he brings a series of solid you know solid teaching and real core uh visions and things that we believe and hold to very firmly these messages he made made it very clear that he would have been preaching it in his own Tabernacle but that uh he had the opportunity to preach across the Nations to the churches that followed his message so he asked for the courtesy from Brother the pastor there brother Jack Moore that for the local church not to take it personal some of the statements that he would make because there would be some Doctrine in there the courtesy and brother BR of operated that way I love the way he respected other people their pulpits their Ministries when they told them told him the Lord told them something he respected that and he wasn't um a person that went around telling everybody what to do offering his opinion all the time and brother Billy Paul had shared that with us that you know if a brother came in or person came in and told Brother banam the Lord told him to do this and told him to do that he would just tell them well you need to do what the Lord told you to do and but if they came in and asked for the will of God then he can open up his heart and share with them um what he saw what he the Lord has showed him and I just love that you know that freedom that he had and he gave he extended but in this message he um opens up and tells us that this was a Sunday school teaching and that it was actually Romans chapter 7 was a prophecy of the Church of the last days and so if you look into the text there in Romans chapter 7 and you look at it as a future prophecy then that is um not so much to the people that heard it it's not so much even when it was wrote or written prophecy speaks of the future and so when there's a prophetic scripture or a prophetic Vision or the truths like first second and third pull there's a prophetic element to it meaning that there's a future unfolding of those things that we the true church should be looking for God is a God of Prophecy your Bible is written in the spirit of Prophecy when you go down on your knees to pray if God reveals something to you it's in the sense of Prophecy he's showing you something to come this is how warnings come this is what dreams are this is really what gifts are for this is really what the scriptures are for so you can prepare yourself for what's to come it's prophetic the Bible is written that way it's not written as like a story so we can just laugh and hahhaa and be interested in what happened in the Old Testament those things did happen there are some funny funny moments there is some moments that are intriguing but really it's a prophetic book and as you can see how it pertains to your life then you'll know how to handle yourself govern yourself you know how to choose a job choose a wife choose a husband choose a career based on the prophecy of the prophetic utterances that are in the Bible It prepares us for what's to come we already know what happened we already know what was yesterday but who knows what tomorrow holds the word does who knows how to prepare how to know and no to build an ark you can't build it when it starts raining you have to build it before it started to rain who gave him instructions how smart was he what kind of IQ did he have who down who told him the secret the Lord did and the same Lord that spoke to Noah Moses Jesus John the Baptist ought to be the same Lord when you fall down on your knees that's speaking to you he will prepare you and you think you need to be smart to prepare yourself or get yourself ready how can you get yourself ready for things you know nothing of so we place our life in his hands he's the Good Shepherd I'm just a sheep I can't fight for myself I don't even know where I'm going I don't know which way is up or down but the shepherd knows and when I put my life In His Hands everything will work out all right always has in every age amen so it's prophetic this scripture is prophetic this teaching is prophetic and so here's where I got my title here in paragraph number 31 in the message um The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ I'll read for you here sister could pick it up for us in the back there paragraph number 31 he's laying this message out beautifully I'd like to title these few remarks that I was going to make here and some scriptures that I would like to follow up closely behind if the Lord are willing to the Thanksgiving message to the invisible the invisible Union of the bride of Christ The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ doesn't sound like a Thanksgiving message though any Scripture we're thankful for all of it I'm thankful to God to be living in this time of the closing scenes of this world's history I don't know if I would have had a say so before the foundation of the world if God would have laid out the whole program to me and said to me I want you to preach now what age do you desire to go to the Earth to preach I would have chose this age for I think this is the Golden Age I certainly would have loved to have been here during the time of his visit to Earth but I think this right now is a greater time because it's a time that he's coming to take the people that he's redeemed nearing the resurrection when all the redeemed will come forth what a glorious opportunity we have to speak to a dying people great time we are enthused about it and we know that history is closing out the world's history will soon be over then we're going to step into a new day to the great Millennium that is one believer I believe in the Millennium reign with Christ so so very nice wouldn't you say that this is the Golden Age greater age any other age it's a beautiful time what a tremendous opportunity to live in this age I wonder if we don't see it that way it's closing history we're living in an age where there it it there may not be a tomorrow we're living in an age where it's going to finally all be over with and it's been revealed to us the age that we're looking in we know that it was a prophecy this scripture in Romans chapter 7 so let's look at that just for a minute quickly Romans 7 interesting how the Apostle Paul speaks verses 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 he starts out with saying know ye not Brethren I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth so he's bringing in the Old Testament law and he's bringing to the the men or the people that he's speaking to know that the law had dominion over a man while he liveth basically saying a dead man can't break the law a dead man can't commit adultery a dead man can't sin it it's only effect if you're alive the laws the Commandments only work if you're alive to do them when you're dead doesn't matter and so he's bringing that and then he brings in the woman being married to a husband and he he he he shares with us and he brings this type of the law with uh Grace and typing it to marriage and divorce the great subject in here he's he's speaking of is adultery a very interesting subject um it's a powerful Commandment that through your Bible Thou shalt not commit adultery was written and that is a man or woman uh uh living with someone that wasn't their husband wasn't their wife and this is the adultery that he's speaking of here but he's typing it to a man with the law and then uh the woman with her husband and then he brings in Christ with the body of Christ with Believers very nice how he brings that in he you notice he just doesn't say Christ you're United with Christ he said you're United with the body of Christ take your Bible with me for a minute verse four wherefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God so he's basically talking about marriage and divorce and he's talking about how a woman if she's married to to a man and she goes out and lives untrue to that man which is her husband she shall be called an adulteress she committed the sin of adultery but if her husband be dead then that law of her having to respect or live under that law that's dead she's free now to remarry and live in marriage and she won't be an adulterous now that's right it's it's uh he the the Apostle Paul is taking the Old Testament scriptures of the law of Moses because the Jews were so caught up in those laws the 220 something laws that were there not just the Ten Commandments all the laws on what to eat dietary laws the clothes to wear how to treat your animal how to treat the stranger all these laws that were caught up in it and now he's bringing them from the law over to Christ and the example that he's giving that if a man and a woman are married in holy matrimony and that husband dies then that wife can now remarry and she did nothing wrong when she does so in verse four says wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that ye should be what married to another even to him who is raised from the dead so ain't no single people in God's Church everybody's married you married to Christ if you're a Believer you you you've divorced the law of sin that ruled in your body and that thing is dead now thank you Jesus it's dead it's the old man now I'm remarried I'm married to Christ and he is the word and he is the body of Christ you know it's funny how we can be married to Christ and we looking at Jesus and Christ but then we'll disclude all the body of Christ there's some brothers there's some sisters there's young people there's the church that's made up of the body of Christ that you have to be joined with mhm yes yes and so verse five when you are in flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death talking about your old nature but verse six but now we are delivered from the old brother Israel actually he wasn't brother Israel he was just Israel the thug Israel the unbeliever y'all was thugs too sir y'all was Renegades too the Old Law the old Israel but now being dead where wherein you were held that we should serve in the newness of the spirit and not in the oldness of the letter now we become married to him to him that raised up from the dead so you'll see Paul is bringing this instructions on marriage and divorce but Christ in the church he does it in Ephesians chapter 5 as well he brings in a husband and wife how a a wife should be subject to her husband even as the church should be subject to Christ he does that play with that relationship between husband and wife Paul does that and it makes it more visual to you now so that we can bring forth fruit unto God and that we should serve in the newness of the spirit so what did this prophetic message bring to us one of the things that the prophet of God brought to us in this message is that this age this time we're not looking for a Revival we're looking for the coming of the Lord in our generation and if the coming of the Lord ain't a Revival the the coming of the Lord is an event it's a very special event it it's not a it's not a a nothing it's a something and if the Lord is coming coming to you personally coming to the church coming to the Believers to Rapture it that will be a special time you know many people like to use that quotes in paragraph 2 that we're not looking for Revival we're looking for the coming of the Lord so they'll try not to you know they'll try to downplay any move of God to the individual that's right yes sir but I don't care who you are if the word is fire and it touches you you will move if the word is on fire and it drops in your heart it will make you move it will have a response over your life you can't hold your peace amen amen and so it's a prophetic utterance in Romans chapter 7 and he's bringing this as a Sunday school teaching and then Paul brings the illustration between law and Grace marriage and divorce and then shows us all that we are married to Christ and the the real Sin here the real highlight here is adultery tree he brings it out that ye if if she lives with a man while her husband is still alive she shall be called an adulteress the scripture speak of this adulteress adulteress adulteries adulteress adulterer many many ways that it's written but the goal for this text and the goal for the Christ being you being married to Christ is that your faith would be unadulterated how many like that there's not a scripture that's that's used unadulterated but brother random used it an unadulterated Faith your faith needs to have no adultery in there and it's beyond a man in a woman getting married I'm talking about single people unadulterated faith is what the goal is that you would be married to Christ amen in the newness of life in the newness of the leather letter so he takes this and brings it to us some of the prophetic utterances in this message so now the goal is that our faith is unadulterated he brings in paragraph 79 n the responsibility of a church after now we understand that it's Christ in the church or he's talking about a man and a woman but he's now talking about individuals and being married to Christ the word he who rose from the dead that you would walk in the newness of life then he drops in this sacred trust so let's get to it here just a minute in paragraph number I think I gave it to you back there sis paragraph number mhm 79 look at this Saints her body is given to her talking about a woman now a sacred Trust From God no female dog no bird nor other animal nor the creature like that no she's the only one by it she is the reason it's so sacred she's to bring forth life into the Earth her body is the bedding grounds of life therefore that's the reason she's given this sacred trust now hear you might disagree many of you theologians that's what's defiled the whole human race is that adultery at the beginning her beding ground was marred she brought forth those twins Canan Abel one act two children search the scriptures uh-huh notice now we find that her body is the betting ground therefore it's a sacred trust not to defile that now who is he talking about you Brothers some of your brothers say man he's talking about them sisters no he's talking about you he's talking about you the church that's right don't let it stay carnal Saints you know they they criticize Us in the article about you know some statement that was made in marriage and divorce about the woman and how her her you know her her um Her Sacred body and the origins and so forth and then some men will take that as like yeah the message is hard on sisters you missed the whole point he ain't talking about sisters he's talking about the church that there's no adultery in you the cleanliness that life is supposed to come forth out of your vessel and he called you to be a sacred trust you can't read everything in the news you can't look at everything out there in these worldly entertainments my brother my sister God has giv you a sacred trust to keep your vessel your body clean amen right notice her body is the beding grounds paragraph 81 therefore it's a sacred trust not defile not to defile that now I'm speaking now bringing this to an illustration to show you where the church stands I'm not speaking of you women whatever you are that's between you and God or you men but I'm speaking of the church and Christ did we get that can we see that s some s don't see that some brothers don't see that but that's what he just said right there he's talking about the church and Christ talking about it's harder than the sisters it's hard on everybody to get this right yeah you see God have mercy on us to look past the carnal and see the prophetic utterance of Romans chapter 7 and what it was talking of Amen I want to name three things things that she must not get away from now I'm speaking keep the church in mind while I'm speaking this to the Natural Woman as Paul here in the seventh chapter of Romans so he brings that down and let's drop down to paragraph 100 we know what those three things are right virtue Womanhood and what was the other one we know what those three things were word that he talked about let's read it for you paragraph 100 100 I'm speaking of how it can get away when you get to mixing up with the world the church and all the Fashions and things that we have were no more like the original Pentecost was than days from night we've drifted off somewhere into some dark chaos somewhere and lost what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman now she why she's a type of the church which has the same responsibility a woman has a sacred responsibility to Motherhood to her virtues to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility to what prayer and to what the word and to Christ just the same as a woman has amen so let me read those three sacred things we go back up to paragraph number 90 87 notice she has a sacred Trust of virtue that's been given her trusted to her by the Lord God gave her that virtue she has a sacred trust to Womanhood committed to her that she must not break the woman I'm speaking of is here is her conduct and her character am around men and then he goes on he says she has a sacred trust to Motherhood so there's a a s a sacred trust to her virtue a sacred trust to Womanhood a sacred trust to Motherhood can I get a witness look what he says in paragraph 88 he says look on these screens and see these movie stars kissing and hugging and slopping around over these women woman does that is of a bad character she might be virtuous otherwise but see in her heart when those glands sex glands are in the lips the man kisses a woman he's actually potentially committed adultery sex glands are in the woman's lips and in the man's lips he can kiss her her on the hand it wouldn't mix through her sex gland but the sex glands is in the lips how many denominations preach in that one that kissing is potentially adultery and you young people that are in public school you know your friends that kiss and they kiss around and slopping and kissing around don't get involved in that that's so if it's of a bad character for someone to do that wouldn't it be of a bad character for me to sit down and look at it and be entertained by it talking about a love story if they ain't married they don't need to be kissing a movie it's just a movie and you're watching it and you're being entertained by by and is it Thanksgiving or what but you know this is the age that we're in if be kissing and slapping around holding hands how many you worldly people had a boyfriend or girlfriend when you was like six years old like what you doing with a boyfriend what you talking about a girlfriend you talking about in love you're eight you barely tie your shoes sure can't keep your room clean you can't have no boyfriend or girlfriend somebody help me preach this morning a boyfriend and a girlfriend for what what you going to do you're going to do nothing we was out on the schoolyard one time and try to get those clovers she loves me she loves me not she loves me she loves me not so you got to get one that has three cuz you want to leave it on she loves me how many know what I'm talking about how many don't know what I'm talking about yeah foolishness the nonsense you saw in some love story or some movie or something and you're just a little pup talking about you in love you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend I wonder if he loves me or likes me did you read your Bible please Saints young people don't get caught in that Spirit now I've dealt with it we all deal with it it's a normal thing but my warning to you is don't get involved in that you see them kids out there doing that on the schoolyard they doing that plus don't get involved in that my dear young people we love you so much amen so this is a sacred trust that we have to to to the word to Christ and to prayer now he brings that sacred trust to the church and then he goes deeper and brings out a great prophecy we've brought it out many times and it's found in Luke chapter 23 let's turn there quickly and this is Jesus speaking of the day when they wouldn't want to have children anymore Luke 23 now you have to keep this in mind that he's talking about the church and when he's talking about the church he's talking about men and women he's talking about a spiritual condition amen Luke chapter 23 in verse number 27 and behold there followed him and there followed him a great company of people and of women which also bewailed and lamented him but Jesus turning unto them and said Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children for behold the days are coming they're coming see the prophecy there he's talking about it's coming the future in the which they shall say blessed are the barren blessed are the wombs that never bear and the PS which never gave suck then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us the disrespect that they have for human life today and all of the abortion and all of the sexual intuitions for the young kids all the way up to the animals everything is sexualized it's a disrespect to that that channel that God brought to bring human life in it's a game now it's it's become entertainment to look at something like that so that you can your fantasy can be wild or whatever it is it's disrespectful it's the highest form of disrespect this the the the adultery it's a it we're living in an an adulterous generation it's not just the act of adult adultery is the laws are adulterous the people have adulterous Minds The filmmakers the movie makers it's surrounded and centered around adultery and Jesus said behold the days are coming when they will say blessed are the girls that don't have babies the wombs that don't bear the breast that don't give suck now now he's not just talking about women the natural he's talking about the church where they'll practice birth control we know the we know the quotes they'll practice birth control in the church now they want the sensation of being a Christian they want the camaraderie and the social aspect of being a Christian but when there's a soul at the altar that needs to be born again we don't have time for that our hamburger lunch is too important for us to have time for our soul to be bored at the altar God have mercy on us when a church loses that burden when a pastor loses that burden for souls to be born yes sir then he need to go sit down and let his ministry go amen amen come on I want to see a soul be born again I want to see a birth take place amen that's what a Believer wants that's what a Christian wants that's what the Church of the Living God wants a birth amen I want it to birth in me yes sir I want a move of God on me yes I want to move of God in Me In you in all of us amen and so this is prophetic are the church have the churches gotten that way yes go visit around you'll see what's more important the building program how many people they got their music program who's the most famous preacher I I had to ask the Lord to help me and forgive me you know I just we had those beautiful meetings wonderful but the stress of the time of the service how they were long I didn't even have an altar call God have mercy on me that I would close a service down because somebody thinks the service is too long and not open up the altar yes thank the Lord for the meetings yes I thank God for them but I didn't have an altar call we had one sinner come to the altar but the pressure of time people getting up people looking at their watch people stressy antsy it's after 12 it's after 12:30 what we here for any where are you going anyways God have mercy on us that's not a rebuke to you I'm rebuking myself all right yes make it time for The Altar for those souls to come so they can be born again God help us all right excuse me so I've repented y'all forgive me I'm try not to do that again y'all got to leave leave but if we didn't have an altar call we'll open it up people need to pray they need to pray remember that after the service one service for the John remember how the worship came now the Holy Spirit came down so nice but the food was ready got to go eat amen my I was trying to be nice this morning Thanksgiving no it's true I was trying to just but you know we come here to worship and then finally at the end of the service the anointing comes and then we got to get out of here you sometimes you got to go you got to go but every time you know you want to be open for the Holy Spirit to bless you he might want you to stay a little longer all right every service isn't that way I'm just saying that if that service is there we should be sensitive to that amen that's right cuz the day will come when they will say blessed are the wounds that never bear and the PS that never gave such so he brings in the sacred trust he brings us in Luke 23:27 can we read what the prophet of God says about that excuse me paragraph 119 read this many times but it's a spirit it's prophetic it's it's prophetic to the churches here in Tucson that the churches in whatever City your churches in today I want you to notice Jesus spoke of it also if you like to read it Jesus made mention of this thing would come to pass did you know that in the last hours just before it crucifixion Luke 23 today it's a disgrace for her to have a child child see then they shall say and begin to say to the mountains follow us follow on us and the hills cover us for if they do these things in a green tree what shall they do in a dry speaking of the day when women wouldn't no more want children they want a dog or a cat or something like that but she don't want children anymore why she's oh mother hubard if she has a child see she don't want that's the remarks of Hollywood it don't want this woman to be an old mother Hubbert so she'll have some operation performed to himself or her one that will keep them from having children they don't want no children Jesus spoke of it and what did he say at that time they'll begin to cry for The Rock and the mountains to fall on us she'll practice birth control so she can go to parties she can't be bothered with the baby nursing her it'll disform her when she's pregnated it'll disform her she won't look like she used to her husband ignorant enough to let her go that way she won't give him a Child Jesus spoke of it and he said that when they were doing this at that time they'll go to crying then for the rocks to fall fall on them it's coming of the Lord they pay great sums of money for cats dogs to mother that's right she must mother something because it's a god-given nature to her he goes on and he talks about how a woman it's in her nature to Mother something he talks about how the church is bringing forth members it's in our our nature to do that but you don't we don't want the kind that the word will produce we want the kind that's socially uh adaptable to the people's taste a thinking man's filter he BR that message that you you there's a desire that you sucking on a desire so you'll find the church that fits that desire and if it's a 30 minute sermon that's what you like that's the church you'll go to if it's the desire of a worldly person's taste but if the word prod uces a child it'll be just like all the other children that were born acts 238 youngans screaming hooping hollering it's uncomfortable to have a baby with you and go on an airplane it's uncomfortable to have a baby and you can't go to the Opera you can't go into a quiet place with a baby your lifestyle is limited that baby will embarrass you it will spit up on you it'll cry when everybody you wanted to be quiet it's a baby you was a baby too and somebody had patience with you until now you're a man now the church don't want the babies in the church no more it's too uncomfortable messes up our service it went too long all that screaming and hollering why she's dancing why he running up and down the aisles the question is why you ain't running up and down the aisles maybe that's the question dancing is a sign of what victory do you have the victory no don't tell me show me praise the Lord amen amen churches they don't want that I mean let's be honest to get out you know a nice reasonable time I want to I don't want to sit in church all day long ain't nobody helping me I got things to do like you do right got plans you got things you want to go on Wednesday night but what am I here for anyways ultimately I want the Holy Ghost to fall down in all of our services I want them to fall down every time and and Lord if you fall down in the service I will worship you I will Entertain You Lord would you make that commitment yes sir to him yes all right it's total disrespect for life they don't want the babies to be born now let me close this message up with this here these few little thoughts here as as brother brandham was several minutes into his sermon he says he he asked a congregation he says you're probably wondering what does this have to do with Thanksgiving and and he goes and he relates to us in other messages that Thanksgiving is the only real American holiday all the others were catholic but you know what they have they have a day for every day of the year now they have Secretaries Day they have days for different like donuts the national whatever day they got a day for every day you want to think of that people want to celebrate but the only real uh American holiday which was founded upon being thankful is Thanksgiving the giving of thanks to the Lord how many of of us are thankful for the Lord there is nothing we have we have no complaints brother George all we have brother Zach is a heart of thanks I am overwhelmed with the goodness of God that he's been so good to me when I don't deserve it he's still been so good so kind so longsuffering and merciful His blessings overtake me I can't count them they're innumerable the song says count your blessings name them one by one you can't count all the blessings and this is the day of Thanksgiving and so what he does what the prophet does is he ties in the pilgrim fathers to the seven seal message oh my how how what is the pilgrim fathers coming over with that first original Thanksgiving have to do with the seven seal let's share it with you just now all right because they're related is that right when when you respect the truth God will reveal more truth to you see there's an attitude that we have to have towards God's word and we want God to reveal more to us but we're disrespectful to the little things that he's given to us but if you thank God for the little bit that he's given you he's got more to give you more of his truth more of his word here where brother Ram says in the message um it's in the church ages the Philadelphia Church age and he says this here he's talking about Peter paragraph 180 he was the Lord when he was born he was Christ the lord then when he received his name of Jesus that made him Jesus Christ the Lord that's exactly what was revealed to Peter he knowed who John and Mary was when he said go baptize in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost so it could be revealed because Jesus know that Peter had the gift of Revelations he know because it had already been revealed to him by the spirit above and when God sees that man can receive Revelations from above he can trust that man to do something with him okay when it's revealed to him because he says no man can reveal this but his father God is the only one who can reveal it and he know Peter was in contact with the spirit so when God can see that Peter can accept Revelation then God can do something with him this is the same thing that we've been bringing to you that you know reading quotes or putting scriptures out there of our behaviors and things doesn't change anyone it only makes you aware of what the truth is but the Revelation has to drop in you and that's what we pray for Lord you said it in your word there's a quotation right there but I'm not living it just yet I'm not feeling it just yet but give me a revelation of it Lord make it one with me and when God sees that a man can receive Revelation now he can do something with that man this is what he did with Peter wasn't even converted yet but he had to gift the revelations and so the prophet goes forward and says this in the invisible Union paragraph 192 I'm going to close here okay who said take your time I had two people I need a third Chuck said it I said who else said that Miguel can I take my time who else who said that who said don't take your time nobody all right God bless you you all are a very smart crowd the prophet of God says this here God bless you Saints God bless you paragraph 192 he says you may say what's this all got to do with Thanksgiving what you talking about brother brandom here it is a quarter and a nine you didn't say nothing about Thanksgiving what a message for the occasion to me yes indeed the pilgrim fathers were very thankful for their new found way of life being separated from the old English denominations and Creed they could marry to the new anointed word for their age that's right the new anointed word of their age age for their day so can we be thankful as pilgrims like Abraham separated ourselves from the things of the world all of our Associates Abraham was a pilgrim God has separated us from all the dead religions I'm speaking Across the Nation now all the dead Creeds and to what separated us and open to us a new land a new message for this day what did it do paragraph 196 what did it do he opened up the Seven Seals of the last message you know that notice that the Seven Seals which all the mysteries of the seven Church Ages was sealed with Seven Seals the reformers didn't have time to do it in their days they didn't live long enough but this blessed revelation of the seven seal is open to us in the last days from a prophecy that went forth to Arizona amen how many's thankful to be married what you married to said brother isra I'm single no you're not there's no single Believers here what you married to the new anointed word because of the Seven Seals that is a Thanksgiving Day what a golden day for Thanksgiving you know when brother Brandon preached this message he says this may be our last Thanksgiving and for him it was he said we might not meet like this again and for him that was absolutely the truth right but did he leave a message of Thanksgiving for us Thanksgiving during Christmas time during Easter time during every day of my life a golden age of Thanksgiving for a new land a new land a new message thank God for this message thanks God for being married to Christ what are you married to this morning aren't you married to Christ the word and you put away the old letter the old man is all put away God richly bless you thank you Lord Jesus for a beautiful
