of time did this take place take Smucker's glorious uh Reformation I guess some of these Scholars have that and it's the history of the church and I forget not just what page it's on but it taken place from the time of the the thing was produced or given to the church by St Augustine of Hippo Africa that was ad 354 and it lasted till 1850 the massacre of Island see so that time is from ad 33 uh ad 3354 let me get that right now from 8354 to to 81850 1850 according to the history there was 68 million Protestants put the death recorded on the Roman martyrology for disagreeing with the pope of romeen That's History if you want said wrong well then maybe George Washington wasn't here in Lincoln you know know us live back to see it but I believe he was here anyhow I see signs that they were here brother Brandon the 19th Chapter of uh and 18th verse yet have I kept me 7,000 of Israel 7,000 in Israel all hasn't bowed their bowed to balum and ever mouth or or be to B Every Which has not kissed in mouth who has not kissed him please explain this for me about this uh about the 700 it was 7,000 see and that's kissing baa don't you know how many here was f a Catholic you kiss images see and remember in the time of Babylon in Nebuchadnezzar when the Gentile kingdom was issued in see when Gentile Kingdom issued in it come in by the worship of a man Nebuchadnezzar made a statue of a man and if you got a spiritual mind now listen to this Revelation that spirit that man that he made a a revelation of or he made a image of by his Revelation was Daniel a religious man being worshiped see it because he named him um belar was it or Bel jar which was the name of his God and he made an image of that God which was the image of Daniel and Daniel refused to bow to his own image and here it is again see now now watch the Gentile kingdom was issued in in the days of Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar a gentile King putting church and state together by taking a holy image of a holy man and forcing worship to it the Gentile Kingdom ends in the feet with a handwriting on the wall by a political power that's United church and state together to force kissing images amen image of a holy man brother Brandon when this Rapture takes place when the Rapture takes place will the young children that do not know right from wrong go in the Rapture if their names are on the book that's right all

exactly what you're supposed to be doing don't don't start see when you do you twist the very thing away from the purpose that's intended for you get little peculiar thoughts and you get own ideas about things don't take your own idea just when you're set listen to things like that say thank you Lord I'm just going to walk a little closer to you don't quit work and say I'll sell out everything a man running up here day from North Carolina just before we left he said glory to God can you tell me where uh some great somebody was and I said oh yes sir said this guy's got the said this guy is a

about it I said let's go in and sit down maybe we talk this thing over we did see don't don't you see friends don't you never desire a Ministry you know what I mean you be happy you're just where you are you just go right on after the Rapture of the Bride when does the church that had to go through the tribulation period stand judgment they don't stand judgment is it before or after the Millennium the church oh I beg your pardon pardon me everyone wrote this um when does the church that after the Rapture of the Bride when does the church that had to go through the tribulation period stand at the judgment is it after or before after the rest of the Dead live not for a thousand years they didn't go with their bride let's see you have said many times that communism was raised up by God to serve his purpose as king nebuchad now where did the communism fit into the picture that will it finally will finally do how does it wind up many scholars believe that in the uh Kingdom of the north God and Magog mentioned in the scriptures goes down against Israel in the um in the can't make out just what that is yeah yeah I believe of the some of the tapes taken say you said it would finally drop it that communism would finally destroy um Catholicism or the Vatican by uh uh an explosion is this right yes Revelations 16 you'll find it and Revelations 18 uh 8 and 12 if the person sure want take this piece of paper on that you can look it right up yeah see Al last Al last a great City for in one hour she's come to her end you see the merchants and everything Earth bought her merchandise it will be that's right and don't it's qu just forget about communism it's nothing in the world but a bunch of of people that's nothing but Barb iians it's ungodly it's a system let me show you something just show you how simple it is why there's only 1% of all Russia that's communism they need a messenger 1% than 99% of them are still on the Christian side 1% now how can 1% control 99% that ought to explain it to you right there God did permitted what would they be throw out long ago see sure brother brand you said that Rome would take the government well the Jews at the last three and A2 years that is going the the first three and A2 years of the tribulation or will it be the last three and a half is this correct it will be the last three and A2 years that's right not the first C it's already passed got one more after this um my dear brother will the Malachi 45 Elijah go to the Wilderness as First Kings 17 tells us the other Elijah did well I wouldn't exactly say that he would um that he would go to the Wilderness but he be this you see he was elishah and Elijah did you notice most of men like that are men who are away they they keep away from the people they're very odd they don't associate too much with people you know how Elisha Was Elijah and John the Baptist and that nature of that Spirit see and uh they don't he he I believe the man be a lover of the Wilderness and maybe stay in the wilderness but now it's to say he's going to be a Hermit and live in the wilderness I don't know about that sometimes they did Elisha didn't but Elijah did then John he he lived in the wilderness and or tell these other prophets when they come out of Judea there I don't know where they'll stay they may camp out on the hill somewhere what they'll do in the days of their prophecy I I don't know what they will do but you what I'm trying to say is this they will they um will they be a um they're trying to ask will they just be Wilderness dwellers well they have to go to Northern British Columbia get enough Wilderness to dwell in now somewhere you see so it'll be someone the Wilderness is all cut out see there's not much Wilderness left see so the only thing that they might be a lover of the Wilderness see and stay maybe a lot in the wilderness and there'll be have you can notice the nature of is that uncompromising see and you you'll know it when come you'll see it you're you're wide awake now here's one I don't know how to touch it and U I got another this before this night I'm going to ask him to snap the tape this minut um if God is one personality why or how could he talk to himself on Mount Transfiguration well I've just explained that to see see I'd like to ask you this I'm going to uh when Jesus prayed to the father you see uh I believe you have the baptism Holy Ghost don't you brother won't you to stand up just a minute you claim to have the baptism Holy Ghost I do too and what is that then I don't claim that I'm have the I have the powers Within Myself to unfold these Mysteries I don't have the power to heal the sick it's God I believe you're a minister if I'm not mistaking you from Arkansas all right now and in you you have is to preach the gospel ordinarily you was raised on a farm and around I catch you just don't know nothing about but something come into you to preach the gospel you don't claim that to be yourself at all that's another person called the Holy Ghost is that right okay I want to ask you do that Holy Ghost dwells within you is that right uh you talk to him speak to him pray to him all right that's all want thank you very much how you get it Jesus I'll ask you one how did it come that when Jesus and John 3 he said when the son of man shall be which now is in heaven see now is in heaven shall it come to Earth see the son of man which now is in heaven and here he stood right here talking to the person amen are you answering me that amen Jesus and the father was the selfs same person just the same as the Holy Spirit in me you're looking to me preaching but it's not me it's not me can speak a word that could bring as you know an animal sit there and look at it and kill the animal and eat it that's creative power that doesn't lay any human being it's not me could take a little boy here lay the doctors lay him on his back with heart trouble the night and say thus saith William brand no thus sayith the lord it's finished and rain out the doctor next day and it's all gone a kid with leukemia till its eyes are bulged out and yellow all over in the stomach until they're taking it to the hospital to give it blood and things to even get it here and five minutes time cry for a Hamburg and take it back to the doctor the next day and can't even find a trace of it that's thus say William Brown that's thus sayth the Lord yet he is an individual different from me but the only way he's expressed is through me see that's how Jesus and the father was Jesus said it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me now the son of man shall ascend from Heaven which now is in heaven see what was it he was omed present because he was God Amen now this other I I want to say these words um explain what she was talking about all for the Lord speaketh unto Thee thank you Father God we thank you for the spirit of your being here and we are told father that one time when the the enemy was coming in and the spirit fell upon a man and prophesied to him and told him it set the thing in order where they know how to go and defeat the enemy and where to find the enemy and I thank you Father that you remain the same God that you ever was you're still just the same we changing ages change in times change in people but you never change your systems are the same Your Grace is the same your works are the same because they are marvelous and a way past any knowledge of man that understand Hallelujah so we are thankful Lord that your secrets are HID into the hearts of your servants and we are so happy for this Lord and may we go forth as shining lights from place to place and trying with love to bring others in that we might sing every little corner and cast The Net in be sure that we get every fish that belongs to you and then the lamb shall take his bride to be ever at his side we're waiting for that time through Jesus Christ's name amen how many sick is in here let's see your hands well it looks to be about hold your hands up again about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 167 about 47 all right it's 11:30 we can pray for the sick right now but theight into the the you would you like to do that I believe right now would be a good time to do it tell you why the holy spirit standing right in here his anointing now as far as we have moved up into that Spirit now see and you see that something you know that something something is present if you could ever believe you ought to believe it right now if you ever going to believe it's now now we want you just to come real quietly and uh let those that are in that aisle there that raised up their hands step out into this aisle then go down this way and then we take them aisle by aisle and this 45 4547 it won't take very much I'm going to ask brother Neville if he'll come step right down here with me and we're going to pray for them first them is coming out into the aisle just stand up just a minute now so we can pray for you here and lay hands on everybody now that's right just everybody's going to come in that prayer line them is going to come in the prayer line now now see conserving the time so we be sure to get it we're going to pray for you now look friends now let me explain it to you Jesus Christ said this these signs shall follow them that believe now watch he never said if they pray for if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover and if God can take a unfailing case of Leukemia and a little girl that can't have faith for herself and make that thing perfectly whole if he can take the next case with a little boy and so healing because the doctors can't even find any rheumatic fever in his blood or anything else what can he do for you now them little bitty fellas they don't understand what prayer would be they just laid hands on and it did it we can understand it now while you're stand to pray now heavenly father with your great presence laying here the great Holy Spirit the one we have the picture of the one that we read in the Bible he's present right here now he is revealing himself through human flesh how we have seen him without one time failing through the years to be able to reveal the very thoughts of the human heart to reveal the sin that they've did tell them exactly what happened and what will be without one time failing and we know that the god of Abraham Isaac and of Israel Still Remains God in the person of Jesus Christ and now by his Spirit descending from Heaven under the blood that was shed at Calvary coming down among people to make his manifested in human flesh just before the burning of the world the great Holy Spirit represented in human flesh those precious people who has accepted the blood atonement and the Holy Spirit takes into their being God represented in human flesh therefore it would not be the human flesh only just to perform the act like in baptism or so forth with a commission that these signs shall follow them that believe by laying hands on the sick the Holy Spirit would see to it that they got well if they had believed now father we know that these things are true these people standing or going to pass under the hands of ministers who has received this Holy Spirit and they're ready Lord to lay hands upon the sick and we know father that if these people are only believe just as every word that you promise is got to happen so it does and it cannot happen with without faith for it is impossible to please God without faith we just can't do it and now with faith believing with this promise laying before us with the seals of the Bible being open to us that God keeps his word may these precious people who are sick Lord and my feeling for them as a human being in a mortal body like theirs and uh there same holy spirit that dwells within us Lord dwells in them and we feel sorry for each other and and knowing that the New Covenant in the new blood if the old one offered healing how much more will this new and better do father may it be so that these people won't fail but will receive their healing as they pass by the hands of thy servant through Jesus Christ's name amen

future that lays ahead of you oh my that's something worthy worthy of praising him for amen I'd like to direct our attention in the scripture in one place of scripture we have several but we'll take Hebrews chapter 12 to get into our message here this morning and again I'm so happy to see each of you so nice to see your smiling faces there Hebrews chapter 12 in verse number 18 for you're not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burn with fire nor unto the Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of the trumpet and the voice of Words which voice they that heard in treated that the word should not be SP spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with the dart and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake but ye are come unto the Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angel angels to the general assembly and to the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel amen the blood speaketh better things may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so we have been talking about healing and the healing of the whole man and as you look at a man today as brother Brandon brings it those three rings and he brings that to us in the message um the greatest battle ever fought and he says that here just to go over it I've read read it several times I just trusted it will stick in my heart and in your heart too paragraph number 72 he says if you'll sit down when you get home and draw three little rings you'll find out that the outside body has five senses that's contacted by and that is see taste feel smell and hear that's the five senses that control the human body inside of that the body is a soul and that soul is controlled by imaginations con ience memory reasons and affections that's the thing that controls the soul but the spirit it only has one sense oh let's get it the spirit has one sense and that sense is either dominates it either Faith or doubt and there's only one Avenue to it that's free moral agency you can accept doubt or you can accept Faith how many believe that this morning you can accept doubt or Faith this morning either one you want to work on therefore Satan began at the principal part to cause a spirit of man to doubt God's word god began at the principal part to lay his word in that Spirit there you are that's what does it if this church right now could be put together and knitted together with such that every person would be in one Accord with with not one Shadow of Doubt anywhere there would not be a feeble person in our midst in another five minutes there would not be nobody here Desiring the Holy Ghost but what would receive it if you can just get that certain thing fixed now there is where the battle begins right in your mind whether you will so powerful tremendous the prophet of God brings this conscience memory reason affections and imaginations man to us and shows us that if we can get that all lined up in another five minutes there wouldn't be you know we come here with different things on us we've battled to get here we've tired or fought through some of us tripped over that or stumbled into this and barely made it and you got your mind on all kind of other things and Satan wants to see to it that your mind is on everything but what it's supposed to be upon and that's the goodness of the Lord and the uplifting of his name and praise and thanksgiving and then feeding from heaven above he wants you to look around you know who's there who's not and so all that kind of stuff I want you to get that off of your mind for a moment and look so much deeper the inner man needs to grow and needs to uh come up higher into the things of the Lord and his word is the only thing that will do that for you amen and brother bam says it in the message enticing Spirits he's talking about putting God first paragraph 45 now all things ought to be considered prayerfully first seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added I am positive sure this morning if men and women could only get into the position of where their soul their thinking their attitude will be perfect in the sight of God that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed can you say Amen remember when he's talking about churches who is he talking about the pews is he talking about it's a picture of somebody no he's talking about people individuals and why not me why not you when he's talking about a powerful church that ever existed if I can get my mind my thinking my attitude in that right channel that would be one of the most powerful brother Israel's that ever existed you got to put your name in there and you got to stop waiting for other people to say amen and then you say Amen you got to find your own Amen in the scripture and then run with it and God will bless you you can't you're not we're not going to highfive one another all the way into Glory unless we already reading the same thing amen and I'm not going to I I can't carry two people I'm sometimes getting by just by myself but if we uh stay with the word everything we have need of is right in the word and I'm running the race and I look over there's a brother God bless you there's a sister God bless you too but where we headed to we're running in a race and if we following one another guess what we're you know you might find yourself doing things that's not in the word of the Lord so we follow him is that right and so this Blood speaking better better things on uh Thursday Wednesday night we have brought to you uh the message brother brandham brings on the seven compound names of redemption and those seven compound Nam names were was Jehovah Rafa the Lord who heals Jehovah Shalom the Lord is our peace Jehovah Rah the Lord is my shepherd Jehovah situ the Lord is our righteousness Jehovah Gyra the Lord will provide Jehovah shama the Lord is present or the Lord is there and Jehovah ni the Lord is my banner and those are what the Lord is but now when that becomes what the Lord is to you then he becomes my shepherd my peace my righteousness my deliverer my banner it becomes my confession so not only is it seven compound names of redemption we can say there's seven Redemptive confessions that you can make and that will make a difference in your life because that's what that's what is to you and brother bam goes further and tells us what does compound mean that means if you get one you get the other ones along with it and sometimes we only have faith for one but if you get one you get the other six too and that is really all that you need amen and so this uh these seven compound names of redemption they speak um and as we think of our confession and how powerful that means I shared with the church here uh some time ago when I first moved here I took a class in English and they had us to take a paper and write a paper on whatever the subject was but I took one on healing and how the doctors reports and so forth how they prove that if your attitude is right to the patient on the bad news it tremendously affects the outcome to that patient and then I started looking further and on what they they call the placebo effect on many matters on drugs that people would take there's nothing in this pill but they think there's something in there that helps them the doctors have documented this this is not you know these are not preachers trying to make something up this is these are the facts that they find that if people think they're being healed think something is helping helping them it actually helps them amen the doctors know this and there was actually and I didn't mention this this part but there's actually a doctor and I think he's in Houston or somewhere he does he does Placebo surgeries he actually took people under the knife open up their knee research it for yourself open up this guy's knee closed it back up again and didn't do anything the patient is sitting there watching a a previous surgery take place and he believes that this thing is helping him now now this is like I said these are not snake handlers these are not religious people trying to get you to join their church this is what the doctors this is what science says and it is tremendous to think of that without one scripture just sitting in a room you have allergies take this pill here Everybody Take One and it's going to help you and some of you all don't even know there's nothing in that pill just sugar or whatever there's no medication in it at all but you think it's going to help you and it does help you this really opens up a great um Avenue to what how powerful the human being is the man is in his thinking and his thoughts just naturally now this is even apart from the scripture this is just a man a fallen man a man who determines that he wants to get something done a goal in his mind it it it might not even be it might be just to make more money or to be more successful if he determines it in his mind him or her it is tremendous what a man can do that has a madeup mind and what about a Believer who has the word amen and so we we shared that with you and then we played the tape the way back part one of it for a Wednesday night prayer meeting and we came back and prayed the played the second part and then brother bham says this I want to play this part for you it's in the message the way back it's about five minutes and and I'll let the prophets say this sorry sister I didn't give your heads up but let me take this next quote as they're preparing to get that all right in this Jehovah Gyra just thinking about the compound names brother banon makes the statements in several places he says they're inseparable able they are compound this is the argument that Dr that Dr Bosworth used on that Baptist intellectual the great debate that brother bam didn't want to be a part of where this picture was taken right here he took his first he said I'm G give you my first question Dr Beth if you can answer yes or no it'll s oh my if it'll settle an argument for an unbeliever won't it settle it for you you too oh God the name Jehovah Gyra the seven Redemptive names do they apply to Jesus yes or no I didn't hear you they all apply to Jesus and how how many of you here are saved this morning let me see your hand if you're saved you're healed if you're healed he's your Shepherd if he's your shepher he's your B he's got every he's your provider everything you have need of is in him because he's my savior don't let the devil fool you don't let the devil take those blessings from you if you are saved here in two years you'll still be saved tomorrow morning you'll still be saved and on the other side you'll be saved what about your healing huh ain't nobody sick over this there ain't no believer sick over here I am healed by his stripes I'm already healed It's Already Done Lord please Lord please heal me what you talking about he's already healed you if I'm a good boy he'll heal no you have nothing to do with being a good boy he's already healed you Mind Body Soul oh he's healed the whole man it's all right there amen thank you let's take this quotation here paragraph 183 in the message the way back he the prophet here you may be [Music] seated let me tell you a little something speaking at a quanas before some doctors at a meeting the other day I've taken a physical with a famous doctor I'm going overseas had a physical examination I did this purposely and he was let me he did me an upper and lower GI natur taking the heart blood and everything thank God it was fast so when I I drink in this SP meal I just made myself real tense and he pressed on my stomach looked through the X-ray he said brother Brandon I said yes sir he said you're stomach feels normally but it nothing goes out I said it don't I said it's supposed to he said yes sir he said my I don't understand I said um what shall I do he said think of something real good to eat I said why you want do that PA notice what he's going to say and he said a nice big juicy steak I said I'll compromise for a plate of fried squirrel with pinto beans and he said all right start off I changed and started thinking he said there she goes I said' what did that doc he said a little electrical wire in your brain sent word down to your stomach I said is that right then speaking I said you remember the little wire I said Doctor what makes you dream did you Dre he said yes I said what is it a part of you that's dreaming he said you're subconscious I said a normal human here's one conscious and here's a subconscious you have to go to sleep to get into that conscious he just told me he said I found something brother Brandon again I can't explain it said it's not your nerves he said it's something inside of your nerves I said my soul he said yes said I it just what makes you what you are and I said I asked him about Visions he didn't know nothing about it so I told him I said one conscious is here the other one's here you have to get out of this conscious let it become darant in order to get in here but some part of you went somewhere because you can remember dreams and places you was at in your dreams years and years away so that's right I said you see that's normal but God so sets it to some of us that our first conscience and subconscious is right together we don't go to sleep God just uses it to see things that was and which is and shall come that's prophetic and he said Mr Brandon I've read your books on healing he said I certainly agree with you so I'm going to tell you said we have absolute cases here I can prove it science if there's a doctor post can tell you that he said said let a person have a malignancy or a tuber or an ulcer or something that's real bad we know it's going to kill him and we'll tell him that and said if he gets all tore up flustrated angry upset and going on said that patient will die right away but so that patient usually if he's a Christian or something he doesn't mind dying it's just one of the things we have to do dying is part of living so he just goes ahead and takes it on I lift him at times out so almost that attitude retires that case said he'll Linger on and on and on and on before he kills him I said all right doctor let me finish my story I said put a lie detector on your arm and stand and try your best to make a lie sound like the truth and watch that needle go negative why it's a vibration in your nerves you wasn't made to lie you were made to tell the truth a lie such a horrible thing till it interrupts your nerves you ain't made to be angry you're supposed to be peace like a child with God see you're not supposed to be flustrated you're supposed to have faith walk with God see I said that's it I said now doctor if the this man living in his first conscience can take the attitude that if he dies he's safe so what difference does make it'll retire the case for a long time what will it do when it drops out of that first conscience back into the second on the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll take the case completely away a doctor raised up and said marvelous tears run down his cheek I said Doctor you know what's the matter I said our churches don't teach that he said Mr random that's truth I said we need to go back to Pentecost he said I'm Presbyterian said my wife is Presbyterian I said you Jed a presbyterian lot she said that's about it I said doct a Christian is born again you can't go Jour you got to be born he said Mr brand that's the truth and tears going to run down his cheeks we baptizing pretty soon now you join a presbyterian Lodge and I wonder if if there's any message lodges that people join in their mind even maybe your church isn't a lodge but youve have that large mentality just a group just following along just any old thing if if this is what can happen in the natural what about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and an in an innumerable number of scriptures that support the believer that he's already healed and we know the real healing is the healing down in our soul can I get a witness the real the inner man that when that gets healed that's what that's what really really matters and this this starts with basic salvation Romans chapter 10 and sometimes we're so Sanctified and revelated on the seals and the Mysteries that we miss Romans chapter 10 can we turn there quickly just for a moment I just thought about this and I want to bring this in Romans chapter 10 every time I pull over it takes me out of my time but I'm going to take my time and what I get done I'll get done if I don't get done then we'll eat eat it another time all right in verse five Romans 10 Moses described the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall Ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shal believe in thy heart that God had raised him from the dead what it say who shall be saved the man that believeth and confesses he shall be wait wait wait you got to stop doing this wait you got to come over here and join wait don't the scriptures don't mention none of that deal with this first deal with this first believe in your heart confess it with your mouth and you shall be said thank you Jesus thank you Lord that's the word I needed to hear all of my life just believe on me and then tell me that you believe in me and I got you covered you shall be saved Hallelujah we complicated don't we right and when we complicate it it only complicates our faith this same scripture is in Deuteronomy 30: 11- 14 it says this commandment which I command thee this day is not hidden from thee neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou should say who shall go up for us to heaven and to bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it neither is it beyond the sea that thou should say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it you know because we are believers and we believe the whole word and I'm talking we I'm talking about message people which I call myself a message preacher message believer whatever you call it I am a Christian first right can we can can we say Amen everybody okay with that are we Christians and the mentality of Believers Christians in the message we have this All or Nothing mentality and so instead of just bringing that man right to Romans chapter 10 to confess and believe in his heart to get that done remember that Papa Cox remember that get this part done we want to indoctrinate them with all the other things that we ain't even living fully yet and and and really it's confession it's speaking it out with your mouth and you shall be saved it's just that simple and your confession will bring other things in your life into existence it will settle it in your life but your testimony has to remain steady constant and positive it has to say what the word says you can't compromise you got to just stay right with that original confession and this is where the blood speaks in this situation with the squirrel fried squirrel and pinto beans that caused his blood to speak it spoke in his body to get down into his digestions and start things to moving that's just in the natural the blood speaking but here was talking about Abel how his blood spoke from the grave when his brother Cain took his life his blood righteous blood spoke but now at Calvary we see the blood speaking again through Christ Our Lord our savior now this Blood speaking is redemption speaking and brother brandom brings these seven Redemptive names also bringing in the seven Stripes of blood that brings Redemption always the believer back into fellowship with Christ this red heer the hiss up and all of the the cedar wood that was the things that were brought together and they burned his heer and that blood was struck uh seven times over the door at the Tabernacle Over The Mercy Seat speaking of the seven Church ages speaking of divine Fellowship you can go further and speaking of the Seven Virtues the stature of a perfect man this God's perfect number it speaks those things and if your confession can speak that he's Jehovah Rafa he's Jehovah Shalom he's Jehovah R the Shepherd he's Jehovah your righteousness your provider he can also speak that he is your faith your virtue your knowledge your Temperance your patience your godliness brotherly kindness and then the Capstone of love that's what what our lives ought to be speaking that through the seven Church ages the Seven Seals the seven Stripes of blood the the blood was a type or spoke of the Redemption the price that was paid for the believer this is why it's not our righteousness it's his righteousness it's not our Holiness I'm not keeping myself but the shepherd is keeping me I would have lost my mind like everyone else but I got the Prince of Peace in my Camp I would have done a lot of things but he's my provider this morning he's all of that is wrapped up into the one name and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God Emmanuel I call him Jesus Jesus thank you Jesus it's all in Jesus this morning yes no other name no other way to baptize I lift my hand in Jesus name I'm walking by faith in Jesus name I'm preaching this message in Jesus name I'm going in the Rapture in Jesus name amen not my name not the name of this church but it's all wrapped up in him these Redemptive names this confession and we know this great and tremendous message that was brought to us can I take my time and brings to us the message of the token now how do you apply the token if you don't say nothing you can't do it you can't apply the token by keeping it zipped up you got to say something let's go into it just for a moment the message the token he says this here paragraph 338 how many thank God there is a token I'm sure Rahab is Happy there's one huh I'm sure the Believers Through the Ages are glad that there's one what about you and I the token is a sign that the purchase has been made and been accepted now you can't get the token from the railroad Fair until you pay the price and the only way you're going to pay the price is to pay it that's right what believe it accept it full obedience to the whole word of God will entitle you to the Token full obedience not part of it as far as your denomination goes but all of it look at your neighbor and say all of it full obedience to the word which is Christ brings you into Christ paragraph 349 then when we pray we must present the token Lord I have obeyed you fully I've repented of my sins I feel that you have forgiven me you forgive me I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ the holy spirit is upon me now I have a need for certain things for your glory Lord I ask for it so you're speaking right there I'm asking for it it's mine now then there is something anchors back here true true it's yours that does it then it's all over amen prophet of God continues it says this here paragraph 362 talking about this token and believing for it believe for safety then apply it see believe for it here is what you want to believe for see you want your own safety you believe for your safety then apply the token for the whole family see you say how can I do that claim itall how do you do it you claim it how do you claim it you say that's mine that belongs to me this is how you apply the token for your family you it's not just you're thinking about it you're actually presenting it in prayer sometime you got to call their name out and claim and they don't even have to know what you're doing and they could be the worst that you ever thought and they're doing things that is totally contrary to what your desire in your heart would be but you take that token and you present it in prayer and you begin to claim your loved ones claim your family you claim the blood of Jesus Christ that speaketh greater things if it worked for you it work for others he says you claim it how do you do it you claim it if it worked on you then you and the word become one amen amen see see it works for both of you you and the word are one then apply it to your children apply it to your loved ones like Rahab did she applied the token to her family she applied it to her mother she applied it to her brother sisters and got them all in you apply it say Lord I'm going after my son I'm going after well the Lord knows I'm going after I don't have to say it no he says say it actually say that's part of the prayer Lord I'm going after my son I'm going after my daughter I'm going after my loved ones I claim them Lord you say it this is how you apply it it's not a secret applying these are words that have to come out of your mouth words that the Holy Spirit hears you hear it God hears it you speak it your outer conscience hears it the physical man hears it everything about you hears it and what are you talking about not what's out here on the news and stuff you're claiming what's in the word of God and it will have an effect upon you going after my daughter I claim her Satan you turn her loose I'm coming after her I apply my token the Holy Spirit the holy spirit that lives within me catch my daughter there I'm going to her now with your anointing upon me he'll do it amen let me say this the word of God works Saints it works I don't want to hear what we tried out already and it it don't work well are you still alive I mean who said it's over it's not over the word of God works and it works all the time and the believer knows it works all the time he's never failed one time so we stay right there we claim those promises we claim them when we feel like we claim we don't feel like it still God's word how many knows that you're saved have you ever met made a mistake and you didn't feel saved was you still saved though in reality how many fell down and stumbled for a little bit do things that saved people don't do but are you still saved thank you Jesus it works when I don't work it keep you when I can't keep myself it still works what about your healing what about your family what about the token it still works yes hallu it's working right now it's working right now it's working I might not see it I might not feel it but it's working all things work together for the good the word of the Lord Can't Fail there are no empty promises they all work all the time and we claim it amen for the glory of God paragraph 373 then apply the token in prayer with consideration with believing apply it with such what y'all going to help me preach this morning apply with such love and so forth to you know it's going to take it's going to take place that's all apply it in confidence believing it's going to help and when you talk to that child say when you talk to that child when you talk I ain't speaking when you talk to that child when you talk to your husband when you talk to your wife when you talk to this loved one you got to talk to somebody now believe that it's going to help just stand there and say Lord I've claimed them they're mine I'm getting them for you Lord amen I got to read that one more time I'm going read this until we all say Amen to it amen I know you're saying Amen in your spirit I want to hear you say Amen in your mouth and in your body can I get a amen does the word uh I mean does the word deserve an amen an amen says so be it and everybody has their own so be it don't you look at this take it then apply the token in prayer and with consideration with believing apply it with such love and so forth till you know it's going to take it's going to take place that's all apply it in confidence believing is going to help and when you talk to that child and when you you talk to your husband you talk to your wife you talk to this loved one believe that it's going don't be fishing for the foolishness and the garbage you've apply the token when you talking to them that's what you thinking about huh am I wrong when you talk to that child you apply it with such love and consideration I claim the token over them amen and I'll admit some people you talk to they just get on your nerves make you want to fight them and argue with them but you we're not doing that fighting is over we're applying the token with such love believing that it's going to help just stand there and say Lord I've claimed them they're mine I'm getting them for you Lord interesting thing we had a good meeting there in in in uh Mexico a Preta faithful brother Ezekiel and his family took me down and Ezekiel interpreted for me very faithfully and the brother everything was just nice and I took a few moments and spoke 30 minutes or so on one morning and um one of the brothers got up and spoke brother Mark and he said something that really blessed me he said that I wonder when Paul was reing Saul uh for afterward Paul wreaking havoc to the churches I wonder if there were some True Believers actually praying for him instead of running from him and talking about all the bad that he did I wonder if there's a True Believer saying Lord save that man you see uh uh uh our prayers work Saints but you got to pray them for them to work you have to speak them for them to work and believe that they're going to work it is that powerful yes it is apply with such love so you speak it and you say it with love these are words that come out of your mouth now this this confession isn't it is naturally just taking the word so you just walk up you're coming out of wherever you're coming from church or denomination or the streets and you just come into the presence of the word all right you come to church you salvation first glance at it and someone brings to you the words of truth all right and then you read those and you start applying them for your life you're like man thank you Lord I'm saved so glad to be saved I'm GNA crawl up in some big church sit on the back pew and just be saved all the way the glory don't bother me know and that's how some are but you got work to do sis brother sister you got work to do he called you for a purpose I mean if that was the case everybody that came to the Altar and was saved and poof they be gone cuz it's it was accomplished you got saved now go to Glory no no he saves you and he leaves you here to start dooking it out and battling out with demons and devils and to be a witness in your neighborhood and and this this is a a mental recognition that brings you to this now brother bam deals with this just a little bit on the power of mental faith and have three places 1 2 3 four five places that I'm going to read on this intellectual faith I think it was Tommy Osborn I I sh I was sharing with you all or you can read it yourself where he came into brother Bron's meetings and he saw that maniac and the signs wonders and miracles and something said voices told him you can do that you can do that you can do that and that started his ministry he met brother brandham brother bam spoke very highly of him and he had a tremendous Ministry here's what brother bam says in the message perfect Faith paragraph 35 now you see somebody else do something by a work or act of God or promise of God and many of them say I can do that too it's an imagination and when they do you find them wrecked up out there somewhere it's got to be a substance now that is potentially a faith that is something that would bring you to a faith it's potentially like if you ask me for an oak tree and I give you an acorn potentially you have an oak tree but it hasn't produced itself yet so brother bam brings in this intellectual Faith he he says it leads to a wct out somewhere and then he then he brings a balance but it potentially is a faith because it got to start somewhere and a mental like I can do that too yeah I can lay hands on the sick too I want to see the dead rais how many ever knew Christians thought you would see the dead raised how many had that faith when you came in sure do you still have that Faith did God backslide no the word is still true but we get around people and we start you know backing up on it but it's still the truth and so it's potentially a faith he goes further and he says this paragraph 53 and afterwards the disciples asked Jesus saying why could not we cure him Jesus said because of the lack of faith of your unbelief that's right because of your unbelief now remember they had the power Jesus had given them the power to heal the sick raise the Dead cast out Devils just a few days before that they had the power but not the faith to use the power now there's the brandom Tabernacle there's the church the bride today the holy spirit is here with the power but you haven't got the faith to move it see what I mean it takes Faith to move it so he's talking to his own church now huh 1963 his own church right it's after the seals can I get a witness somebody yes he's talking to the brandom Tabernacle he's the pastor him brother Neville and he's identified here's the brandom Tabernacle so he goes further in the message Blasphemous names 1962 it says this here paragraph 143 the biggest part of our faith is mental Faith by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition mental recognition of God but if this coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes this there is a Godly spiritual Faith then what does that Faith do that Faith recognizes own only the word no matter what anything else says it only recognizes the word because in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word is still God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and when the word itself is pouring into our faith our mental Faith becomes a spiritual Revelation so it has to start in the intellectual by hearing it naturally talking about this whole man the whole being you hear it intellectually you hear it in your mental faith and then it's pouring in then your mental Faith becomes a what spiritual Revelation can I get a witness is that true or no absolutely the truth brother random is dealing with this mental faith in paragraph in 1953 he's talking about this mental Faith paragraph 73 says this why brother it's by faith you're saved is that right but listen in accepting of your faith God confirms your faith by the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you say you believe and you don't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you do not it your faith isn't accepted in the sight of God you got a mental faith and in that and in in instead of the heart faith Faith that's right so he separates the mental Faith instead of a heart Faith but you got to start somewhere you start by reading the word you start by confessing that word it's on the mental you saying it because the Reverend said it you're saying because Sunday school teacher saying because the tape says it say because the Bible says it and it's just a mental Faith but you got to start somewhere and um I mean you listen to the other stuff out there in the world it's just on the natural level you got to start with the word of God reading that and hearing that just on the natural level start somewhere brother Bam's talking about the mental faith of a a fallen Son of God in the message let me take this one here paragraph 47 in the message Be not Afraid here's what he says about a mental Faith paragraph 47 he says it is true that someone might have enough mental Faith to raise up out of a wheelchair or get up out of a cot or a stretcher but when it comes to Discerning a spirit perfectly that takes you God that's only you the greatest miracle that we seen in the ages is that so here brother Bron is talking about even with a mental faith can pull someone out of the stretcher out of a wheelchair just with mental faith it kind of goes on in this same line in this message the Messiah and he says this here paragraph number 33 a little a little bit above that he says there's something about a man he is a God he was made to be a god his purpose here on Earth was to be a God to have a dominion over everything in the earth oh my now don't let that stagger you CU I got some more scriptures wrote down here see here the other night I saw a telecast of a man with psychic mental Faith set a glass of water he stood back oh we didn't get it yet so I want you to hear this one paragraph 33 in the message Messiah I want you to read it rather and here the other night I saw a telecast thank you of a man with psychic mental Faith set a glass of water and stood back and kept concentrating on that glass of water till it bursted it just by concentration watching that glass of water and the glass cracked and the water run out just pure mental consecration why that's his fibers that's his makeup if he can do that got a power in him by mental thinking that can break a glass of water and him being a sinner that shows that there was something made in that man he's a fallen Fallen perverted condition but if that man can only get back to God and let God get into him why with that power turned loose of the kingdom of God he didn't have no conductor he was like a shotgun he just splattered everywhere but if that spirit that's in a man can be converted and put Christ in there where he's got a conductor a conductor is a wire that conducts it amen and let a man with the same faith in the conductor of the word of God he can raise the dead cleanse the lepers cast out Devils amen he's fashioned like a god he looks like God sure what was that's the reason God was man man was God and this is his offspring man he's only trying to get a hold of a man trying to get man into his hand now this is what brother Bram said you believe it or not it's up to you it's up to you but he brings this man that mental concentration can burst a glass or just concentrating on it a sinner now not not the blood not the Holy Ghost just the man Fallen man what about a man that is filled with the Holy Ghost what about a daughter of God that would take God at his word what about you what about me what about taking God at his word all things are possible to them that believe amen yes he goes further that man is the Messiah it's a powerful message Go Get It Go Get It what message was that the Messiah 1961 0117 go listen to that amen it's free you can go listen to it all right now how do we how do we apply this these seven stripes or these seven compound confessions how do we apply the blood that speaks better things you know we speak many things that we shouldn't speak but the blood speaks and the word of God speaks and when it speaks it speaks better things and so brother bam shows us how to take this natural um confession of the word you walk up to the promise you just come up to it sent her off the streets believer in the church preacher whoever you come up to the word you read the quote and it's just a quote it's just a scripture and then how do you apply that well you read it you say well I believe it okay and that's a good start you believe it because it's the word of God that doesn't mean it's Anchored In My Heart yet I got all kind of stuff I need to channels that need to be cleared out and cleansed up and this is where your level of repentance will change this is where the sincerity of your repentance will get deeper where as you're clearing out these channels that we're talking about does don't have nothing to to do with nobody else or the other group this is between you and God you and the heavenly father and that's I'm sure um uh many of us has repented the wrong way or not thoroughly and we haven't kept our hearts and channels cleansed from unbelief but the word of God gives us the answer and we have examples and examples and examples and here brother bam shows us how to do it for the next 10 minutes with will let him do that for us all right and the message accept God's Gift one two three quotations all right can you say amen for that long well if you say Amen it's only helping you right it's good for you make it better you you'll feel better should I keep going sir all right you all are the precious most precious people in the world God bless you let me read these three quotes for you because it it really helped me to look at this and to grab a hold of this and I believe it'll help you too the message accept God's Gift he says this here I remember one day paragraph 7 I remember one day I looked upon there and I saw what he done for me I crawled humbly to him there laid my name on top of a book and oh what was written under it said Lord will you forgive me and seemingly he took his hands dipped into his side and said yes and he wrote across that book pardon closed it up put it back in the sea of forget forgetfulness I've been happy ever since I'm trying my best in my humble way to tell every Mortal on Earth Jesus Christ loves you and he's the only thing that's holding the wrath of God off of you receive him as your personal Savior and when you've done that now he also was stripped on his back with stripes we are healed we were healed not we will be we have already been healed every person has been healed and now the only thing you have to do is to believe that first in your heart before you can say it if you're just saying it from your lips it won't do you any good Hallelujah this isn't a shallow ofay it's it isn't something that's just I heard someone say last evening on the broadcast every person that believes has been filled with the Holy Spirit now I'm not disagreeing with the minister but he's probably didn't understand understand the scripture Paul in Acts 19th Chapter asked those Baptist people up there have had they receive the Holy Ghost since they believe now not when you believe the holy spirit is a gift of God after you believe it's God's gift to you for believing but you can believe Jesus being the Son of God and accept him as your personal Savior and still not have the Holy Spirit The Gift of the Holy Spirit is God's personal gift to the believer you're saved because you believe but you're filled with the Holy Ghost when God's personal gift comes upon you which is the holy spirit now see it's not a shallow Affair it's something deep we're not babies anymore we're men and women the church should be in that condition tonight not shallow but deep in God not now healing is not something you just say well yeah I believe it I believe it now that's all right if that's the best you can do just mentally or just say well yes I see it I believe that I accept it then if you accept it on those bases keep saying it over and over say it out loud say it over and over just keep saying I'm Healed I'm Healed say it till actually you believe it and when you believe it then something's going to take place now that's beautiful right there that is lovely because you can grasp that you just say it cuz of word he just keeps saying it keep saying it five years 10 years rest of your life keep saying it and then something will take place you'll actually believe it I mean we repeat a lot of things over and over again again just negative stuff all the time contrary you got to say something why don't you say what the word of God says and then say it again and again and again keep saying it I keep saying it until actually you believe it's something to take place don't have a negative testimony every time you confess well I still feel bad today I guess you go right straight back in the same rut that you was in the beginning there's not man or woman in here that is baptized with the Holy Spirit but what would start your confession I believe I lost the Holy Spirit I believe it's gone from me I believe you'll go right down you'll never listen close you'll never live above your confession Jesus is the high priest of our confession is that right Hebrews 3:1 any Scholars knows that same word profession is confession amen we take one more come let us reason together 1955 the prophet of God says this paragraph 79 says see friends it isn't intellectual it has to come from down here that's right something has to happen here God bless you may it happen down there tonight May the true and living God who's here get out of your mind and and get into your heart say oh Jesus yes it's reasonable if you're here and can make these others be well you can make me well too and I now accept it and just keep saying it into keep saying it into your heart till after a while something anchors down there and you know you're healed just as well as you know that shirt's white it's over then that's right you'll raise over to your neighbor and say something happened yes sir it'll be over that's right so we keep saying it until something happens we keep saying it till we actually believe it but we say it how many times over and over that's healing over and over and over you confess your salvation the same way I'm saved by God's grace thank God I'm saved I'm born again Christians yeah we was on the boat one time my friend fishing a couple years back the guy offered us some I guess extra bait worms or whatever at the end of the day and we took them great he says you guys want a couple of beers he says no and he looked at us and my fishing partner says we're born again and that settled it and I just L that I always remember yeah just tell them you're born again no and so that's what we confess for the rest of our life is that right we just keep saying it can I read one more sir and then I'll close Okay the message is why 1961 he says paragraph 82 that's the same thing with Divine Healing I see people get all worked up try to get nervous saying oh if I could just you know why you go Plum over the top of it you leave it behind you you're going out there excited and trying to reach for something when it's right here by you just simp simple just say thank you Father you promised it to me I now receive it that's all Watch What Happens now mean it in your heart just keep saying it over and over say if you don't believe it all together keep saying it until you do believe it keep saying it over I thank you Lord for my healing cuz what is he Christ is the high priest of our confession is that right Hebrews 3 all right he's the high priest of our confession amen God bless you richly we thank the Lord that we got something to talk about let this be your gossip huh gossip about this talk about this one last quote I didn't give it to them this is just blessed me I found it the other day 1951 one he says take God at his word start thanking him for it amen praise him until it comes now thanking and praising are two different things thanking is thank you Lord for this thank you for healing thank you for our Salvation thank you for opening doors praising is something like Lord there's nobody like you Lord what was my life without you what would my life be you're just a wonderful creator the way you've got everything set up you've always looked over me there's nobody like you Lord Jes that's praise that's how we praise him so let's let me let me read that get that for me sis 1951 believest thou this it says take God at his word start thanking him for it amen praise him until it comes do you have a praise for him you know sometimes we want to thank him yes and that's good and sometimes we want to ask him he told us to ask him but what about a praise do you have a praise this morning what would your praise be about him do you have a praise in your heart oh my there's nobody like you and we thank God for it amen God bless you let us pray the musicians May Come
