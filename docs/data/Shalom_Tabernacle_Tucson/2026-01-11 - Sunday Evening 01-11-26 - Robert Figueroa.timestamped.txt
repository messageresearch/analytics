[20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[20:21] &gt;&gt; Blessed be your name, Lord Jesus. We
[20:24] enjoyed brother Minnow leading us in a
[20:26] song this morning.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've asked brother Dingwall if he
[20:30] would mind doing the same this evening.
[20:34] There's a song that he said that he
[20:35] wouldn't need the words for, but we all
[20:37] know it. It's my hope is in the Lord.
[20:39] We'll try it maybe in the key of F with
[20:40] him. Brother Kim, you're going to need
[20:41] to come up here to sing from up here,
[20:43] though. So,
[20:46] we can bring you the mic there.
[20:56] Sure. They're going to miss the dingles
[20:57] when they head back north again, but
[20:59] sure want to take advantage of them as
[21:00] all we can while they're here. So, amen.
[21:02] God bless you, sir.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; I stand in awe within the presence of
[21:13] the Lord
[21:16] in whom the wisdom of the aes
[21:21] lie.
[21:24] for whom the raging of the sea
[21:29] subsides.
[21:32] The living sacrifice,
[21:36] the only source
[21:39] of life,
[21:41] my hope
[21:44] is in the Lord.
[21:48] From this time on
[21:52] and ever more,
[21:55] oh
[21:57] my hope
[22:00] is in the Lord
[22:04] forever more.
[22:10] His tender mercies come with every
[22:14] rising sun.
[22:18] to meet the sinner in his brokenness,
[22:26] to offer healing and forgiveness.
[22:34] And those who trust
[22:37] in him will find their hearts
[22:41] at rest. My hope
[22:46] is in the Lord
[22:50] from this time on
[22:54] and ever more.
[22:57] Oh my hope
[23:02] is in the Lord
[23:06] forever
[23:07] more.
[23:10] How many of you know what it is to have
[23:13] the Lord come and meet you in your
[23:14] brokenness?
[23:17] &gt;&gt; His tender mercies renewed every day. I
[23:19] usually don't get through that verse.
[23:21] His tender mercies are renewed every
[23:24] day. his tender mercies
[23:28] with every rising sun.
[23:33] To meet the sinner in his brokenness,
[23:41] to offer healing and forgiveness.
[23:49] And those who trust
[23:52] in him will find their hearts
[23:56] at rest.
[23:58] My hope
[24:01] is in the Lord.
[24:05] From this time on
[24:09] and ever more.
[24:13] Oh my hope
[24:17] is in the Lord
[24:21] forever more.
[24:28] My hope
[24:31] is in the Lord
[24:35] from this time on
[24:39] and ever more.
[24:43] Oh,
[24:44] my hope
[24:47] is in the Lord
[24:51] forever
[24:53] more.
[25:05] Amen. One of the Psalms David said,
[25:07] "Some trust in chariots, some trust in
[25:11] horses, but we'll remember the name of
[25:13] the Lord." Amen. That's who I want to
[25:15] keep my trust in, my faith, my
[25:17] confidence in.
[25:19] Hallelujah.
[25:21] Amen. They can sing a song as well.
[25:23] Enjoy it. You come
[25:53] Well, when I think
[25:56] of how he came
[26:00] so far from glory,
[26:06] came to dwell
[26:09] among
[26:11] the lowly
[26:14] such as
[26:20] to suffer shame
[26:24] and such disgrace.
[26:28] And on Mount Calary,
[26:31] take my place.
[26:35] That's when I ask myself
[26:39] this question.
[26:42] Who am I?
[26:47] Oh, who am I
[26:51] that a king would bleed and die for?
[27:01] Who am I that he would pray?
[27:08] Not my will thine fall.
[27:14] The answer I
[27:18] may never know
[27:21] why he ever
[27:24] loved me so
[27:28] and to an old rugged cross he would go
[27:35] for who am I
[27:42] then I'm reminded
[27:45] of his words.
[27:49] I'll leave you never.
[27:54] If you'll be true,
[27:58] I'll give to you
[28:01] life forever
[28:05] and forever.
[28:08] I wonder what
[28:11] I could have done
[28:15] to deserve
[28:18] God's only son.
[28:22] He'll fight my battles
[28:26] until they're won.
[28:29] For who am I?
[28:34] Oh, who am I?
[28:38] that a king would bleed and die more.
[28:47] And who am I
[28:50] that he would pray
[28:53] not my will thine?
[28:58] The answer
[29:00] I
[29:02] may never know
[29:06] just why he ever
[29:09] loved me so
[29:13] that to an old rugged cross he would go.
[29:20] Oh, to an old rugged cross he would go.
[29:27] Yes. to an old rugged cross he would go.
[29:34] For who am I? Stand and let's all sing
[29:38] it together. Oh
[29:42] am I
[29:44] that a king would bleed and die for?
[29:54] And whoever
[29:57] that he would bring,
[30:01] not my will, my Lord.
[30:06] know the answer.
[30:09] I
[30:11] may never know
[30:15] just why he never
[30:18] loved me so
[30:24] rugged cross. He was gone
[30:28] for
[30:37] Hallelujah.
[30:49] Amen. God bless everyone. We have a few
[30:51] prayer requests this evening.
[30:54] Brother Andy's mother and father-in-law
[30:57] will be moving back to Haiti on Friday.
[31:00] So, we've really enjoyed seeing them
[31:02] worship with us. So, we want to pray for
[31:06] God's hand upon them there.
[31:08] Jackie Lloyd sick in the hospital in New
[31:11] Mexico and Bethany McFaten is sick and
[31:15] needs a touch from the master. Let's bow
[31:18] our heads and go to him in prayer.

[31:23] that we can stand before you. Joining
[31:25] our hearts, Lord, and spirits being in

[31:38] angels, Lord, would just keep them safe.

[31:46] God has touched their lives,
[31:49] Lord Jesus. We're thankful for the
[31:51] things that we've heard this day, Lord.
[31:54] Help us, Father, to get out of the way,
[31:57] Lord. That realize and recognize every
[32:00] gift among us, Lord, that has been
[32:02] edifying would continue that way, Lord.
[32:05] Never let it be about ourselves, but
[32:07] just you, Father, and your word. Lord,
[32:11] lead us and we'll follow. God, we need
[32:14] you tonight. Lord, we pray the gift of
[32:16] preaching that's going to come before us
[32:18] now. just be blessed mightily. Lord, let
[32:22] it fill our souls, Father. Let us leave
[32:25] better people for it. And Lord, this
[32:28] offering we pray that you just bless it
[32:30] to its intended use. Intended use,
[32:33] Father, for your kingdom. We'll give you
[32:35] all the praise and the glory in the name
[32:38] of Jesus Christ. We ask it. Amen.
[32:48] is
[32:52] of the Lord.
[32:56] Sing it one more time. We're in the
[33:01] presence
[33:07] of Jehovah.
[33:14] God Almighty,
[33:20] you're the prince
[33:23] of peace.
[33:29] Trles

[33:36] hearts are men.

[34:19] enough
[34:22] for me.
[34:28] Jehovah
[34:30] Raa,
[34:36] you're my healer.
[34:43] And by your stripes,
[34:48] I have been
[34:52] set free.
[34:57] Jehovah
[35:00] Sh,
[35:05] you are with
[35:09] me
[35:12] and you supply
[35:18] all
[35:21] my needs.
[35:27] You are more
[35:31] more than enough. So much more. So much
[35:36] more
[35:39] than enough.

[35:46] than enough
[35:49] for me. You just tell him now one more
[35:52] time. Lord, you're my provider. You're

[37:15] my needs.
[37:21] And you are
[37:24] more than enough.
[37:29] So much more
[37:33] than enough
[37:43] for
[37:45] me.
[37:47] Hallelujah. Amen. I love that. My hope
[37:51] is in the Lord. Amen. I'm trusting in
[37:55] him. So, we welcome each of you to the
[37:57] house of the Lord. So glad to be in his
[38:00] presence once again. I remember when I
[38:03] gave my heart to the Lord. It was two
[38:05] years I was running from the Lord. And
[38:08] when he finally got a hold of me, I was
[38:10] a pl in a place that I shouldn't be. And
[38:14] I got down on my knees and I prayed a
[38:17] simple prayer and I said, 'Lord, if you
[38:19] would change my desires
[38:21] and but put in my heart to be in church,
[38:25] I will serve you.
[38:28] And there was no shining miracle. I
[38:30] didn't speak in I didn't shout or
[38:32] anything. But when I got up off my
[38:34] knees, it was just like that.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; All those desires had left me. Things I
[38:40] struggled with have was just gone. And I
[38:43] know it doesn't happen like that for
[38:44] everybody, but that's what happened for
[38:46] me.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; And I love being in church. Even if you
[38:50] cancel church, I'mma find somewhere to
[38:52] go praise the Lord
[38:54] on Sunday night or whenever. And so we
[38:57] count it a privilege to be here with you
[38:59] all tonight. Amen. So good to have you.
[39:02] And I appreciate brother Mow there and
[39:04] we try to squeeze on him a little bit
[39:06] more. Amen.
[39:09] Um,
[39:11] but uh, we found somebody else to
[39:13] squeeze on tonight.
[39:15] That's our good friend, brother Robert
[39:16] Figureroa from the lighthouse in the
[39:18] desert there in Fort Wuka. He's a pastor
[39:21] there. He's been a friend to our
[39:23] ministry for many years. I've preached
[39:26] for him and he's come to speak for us
[39:28] and we just have a love and respect for
[39:31] brother Figureroa. How many can say amen
[39:33] to that?
[39:34] And that's his dear wife there in the
[39:36] back there. God bless them. And so let's
[39:40] uh let's just give them a hand for just
[39:46] being who they are. Amen.
[39:56] We'll do it at his funeral, too, but
[39:57] it's better to do it when they're alive.
[40:00] And so as he comes, let's all stand to
[40:03] our feet and sing that old hymn of the
[40:05] church, Amazing Grace.
[40:08] Amazing
[40:12] grace,
[40:15] how sweet
[40:18] the sound
[40:21] and sing
[40:24] a rich
[40:26] like me.
[40:29] Like me, like me.
[40:32] I once
[40:35] was lost
[40:38] but now
[40:41] I'm found.
[40:44] Was blind
[40:46] but now
[40:50] I see. God bless you.
[40:54] It was grace
[40:57] that on
[41:00] my heart
[41:03] to
[41:07] raise
[41:09] my fears.
[41:14] Hallelujah.
[41:17] Oh, how precious
[41:23] that praise
[41:26] appear
[41:28] they are.
[41:31] I first
[41:36] you praise God for that this evening.
[41:38] Amen. Praise God.
[41:42] Praise God.
[41:45] Praise God.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[41:54] Praise God.
[41:57] Praise God.
[42:01] Hallelujah.
[42:03] Praise God.
[42:06] Praise God.
[42:08] Praise God.
[42:11] Praise God.
[42:14] Praise God.
[42:17] Praise God.
[42:20] Praise God.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise. Praise the Lord. Amen. Are
[42:28] you happy this evening?
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be in the house of the
[42:31] Lord?
[42:32] &gt;&gt; As our brother said, he loves to be in
[42:34] the house of God. Amen. I think it was
[42:36] David who said, I was glad when they
[42:38] said unto me, let us go into the house
[42:40] of the Lord. Amen. And so here we are
[42:42] this evening and I brother Beno a man of
[42:45] such caliber and here I am. I'm a nobody
[42:48] preaching. But you know I believe in
[42:50] God's in God's economy we're all
[42:52] somebody. Amen. But I appreciate our
[42:54] brother his ministry and I both your
[42:56] ministry because when he calls a man he
[42:58] calls a wife as well. We're thankful for
[43:00] that. My wife is here with me as well
[43:02] tonight and but you know I'm Bobby's
[43:04] father. That's how I'm known around
[43:06] here. Amen. So God bless you all. If you
[43:09] have your Bibles tonight, uh, with this,
[43:12] turn to Psalms 37, verse 23 and 24.
[43:17] And as we're talking back there in the
[43:19] office, you're turning there, uh,
[43:21] Brother John Yarro walked in, he said,
[43:23] "Bro, he's a brother
[43:27] uh, Israel says something." And he said,
[43:29] "Well, he's a good man talking about
[43:30] me." And I said, "Well, coming from a
[43:32] good man, I said that's I take that as a
[43:34] compliment."
[43:36] And I didn't realize that the first uh
[43:38] scripture here in Psalms 37:23,
[43:41] it reads, "The steps of a good man.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; The steps of a good man are ordered by
[43:46] the Lord." Aren't you happy, Brother
[43:48] John?
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He gave you testimony that I'm a
[43:51] good man. I gave you testimony. He's a
[43:53] good man. Amen. So, here we are in the
[43:55] scriptures, brother John. The steps of a
[43:57] good man are ordered by the Lord, and he
[44:00] delightth in his way.
[44:02] You know, God delights in our way.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; God actually likes us.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; He smiles when he looks at us. You
[44:11] think?
[44:12] &gt;&gt; You think he smiles when he when he
[44:14] looks at us?
[44:15] &gt;&gt; There goes my son. There goes my
[44:16] daughter.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Come here, Gabriel. Look, I want you to
[44:19] see. Look what they're going through.
[44:20] Yet, look, they're in church tonight.
[44:22] Give me praise, honor, and glory. Amen.
[44:25] The Lord delightth in his way.
[44:28] Though he fall, see never said the earth
[44:31] is going to go just perfect all the time
[44:34] &gt;&gt; as we know the word perfect.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Though he fall, he shall not be utterly
[44:39] cast down. For the Lord uphold of him.
[44:43] Amen. With his hand.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say praise the Lord tonight?
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, tonight as we gather
[44:50] around your word, Lord, Father, and your
[44:53] spirit is already here, Lord. We we've
[44:55] invited you, Lord. You're the guest of
[44:57] honor, Lord. You're the main one,
[44:59] Father. We want to put all our thoughts
[45:01] upon you tonight, Lord, and your eternal
[45:04] word, Father. Speak to us, Father, and
[45:06] help us, Lord, to to be able to say the
[45:09] right thing, Lord, and and anoint every
[45:11] heart to receive, Father, for we here,
[45:13] Lord God, for these few moments here
[45:15] tonight, Lord, to to just get closer to
[45:18] you, Father. We thank you, Father, for
[45:20] your mercy and your grace, for
[45:22] delighting in our way, Lord. Amen. How
[45:25] precious, Lord, is your word, Father.
[45:28] How we thank you tonight. We ask that
[45:30] you be with us, Father, in all that we
[45:32] do and say and you bless your people. We
[45:34] ask it in Jesus' name. And the church
[45:36] said,
[45:36] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[45:37] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Be seated tonight.
[45:41] I was telling brother Israel, I spoke
[45:43] this morning on on the word of God, the
[45:45] actually the Bible. I brought my little
[45:47] Bible with me tonight. Uh but uh you
[45:50] know this this Bible we just don't seem
[45:53] to re uh value it as we should.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Uh this this Bible is is dripping with
[46:00] blood.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; And I I told the church this morning I
[46:04] said you know I said William T William
[46:07] Tindale
[46:08] he he translated this Bible into English
[46:13] and he paid a price for that.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; They burned him alive. And I said, you
[46:18] know, this this little Bible, I said, is
[46:20] dripping with the blood of William
[46:22] Tinddale.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; It's dripping with the blood of millions
[46:27] &gt;&gt; and millions who took it to their heart.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; And we don't value it as we should.
[46:34] Brother Brand said we should read it
[46:35] every day.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; If it's just one verse, read one verse.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; There's power
[46:41] &gt;&gt; in the word of all you need is one
[46:43] verse.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; I've heard of one verse as saved. souls
[46:47] of the past.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; They just heard one verse,
[46:51] &gt;&gt; one little pamphlet, one little
[46:53] brochure. That's all it took.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Lupe Lopez, you you
[46:57] remember brother Lupe from from uh
[46:59] Awapeta uh Mexico and uh he said that he
[47:03] found he was in the in the gu in the in
[47:05] the in the at the dump and he found a
[47:07] track and it was it was about brother
[47:10] Brandham and that's all it took out of
[47:12] the dump. Amen. God God works in
[47:15] wondrous ways, does he not?
[47:17] &gt;&gt; So, who we here we find my my message
[47:19] tonight is the steps of the righteous.
[47:23] I believe that they're ordered by the
[47:24] Lord. Do you believe that tonight?
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Uh a lot of times we make plans and we
[47:29] think we're going to do this and we're
[47:31] going to do that and tomorrow we're
[47:32] going to run over here and this is going
[47:34] to be my land. And and God has other
[47:36] plans.
[47:37] I I think his plans supersede brother m
[47:40] our plans
[47:42] &gt;&gt; a lot of times
[47:43] &gt;&gt; you know there's a how many know Spanish
[47:46] here this this evening now any Spanish
[47:48] speaking well
[47:55] we we make a plan and God he's got other
[47:57] plans and he he because he's ordering
[48:01] our steps.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's watching over his flock. He's
[48:06] watching over you and I. In Psalms
[48:09] 37:31, the there David writes, "The law
[48:12] of his God is in his heart. None of his
[48:15] steps shall slide."
[48:18] &gt;&gt; My my my I'll give you a few more
[48:20] witnesses of that. Psalms 119:13,
[48:24] "Order my steps in thy word,
[48:27] &gt;&gt; and let not any iniquity have dominion
[48:31] over me." And over here, Paul gave an
[48:33] answer in the New Testament. He says,
[48:35] "Sin shall not have dominion over you."
[48:38] Hallelujah.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Blessed be his name. Amen.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Sin shall not have dominion over me.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's given us the power. Amen.
[48:49] The authority over every every serpent,
[48:53] scorpion, and snake, and everything of
[48:55] the of Satan. He's given us authority
[48:57] over all that
[48:59] &gt;&gt; and over all the power of the enemy. He
[49:01] said,
[49:02] &gt;&gt; "My my my."
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Why? Because our steps are ordered.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; God's watching every little from the
[49:08] first step we took as a little baby.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; When mama and papa would say, "Come on,
[49:14] come on." And we took our first, God
[49:16] ordered that step.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; And every step thereafter, hallelujah.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Until he calls us home,
[49:23] &gt;&gt; he's ordered my steps. Amen. I know in
[49:25] whom I had believed.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. My my brother Israel left this
[49:31] pulpit anointed here for me tonight. My
[49:34] my my Proverbs chapter 2:7 and 8.
[49:39] He layeth up sound wisdom for the
[49:41] righteous.
[49:42] He is a buckler. Hallelujah. To them
[49:45] that walk uprightly.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; He keepeth a path of judgment and
[49:50] preserveth the way of his saints. You
[49:54] know, God's always gone before us. Amen.
[49:56] We're just following in his footsteps.
[49:58] Amen. He's watching all our days upon
[50:02] this earth. God is watching us every
[50:05] moment. Amen. He's watching. He's He's
[50:07] taking care of us. He said he would. He
[50:10] He's His hand is up is holding us up.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like that little song. I can't
[50:15] even walk without without him holding my
[50:17] hand.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; In Revelations chapter 2 verse 8 to10,
[50:23] sometimes the steps will take us into
[50:25] places where we don't want to go.
[50:28] Who wants a trial?
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Who wants who wants to go into the fiery
[50:33] furnace of trials? But yet he he he he
[50:36] takes our steps and he brings us right
[50:38] into that.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose for that.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; God is not a God of chaos. He's not a
[50:44] God of of just He is a God of purpose.
[50:47] There's a reason for every I said this
[50:49] morning to the church, he every word he
[50:52] has spoken has a purpose behind it.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; He doesn't waste words. Well, we waste
[50:58] words. We waste time. We waste
[51:00] everything. But God does not waste his
[51:02] words.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Every word has a purpose, amen, behind
[51:07] it. And there's power in every word of
[51:09] God.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Blessed be his name.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Revelations 2:8. And unto the angel of
[51:15] the church in Smeirna, write these
[51:18] things the first and the last, which was
[51:21] dead and is alive. I know thy works and
[51:24] tribulation and poverty, but thou art
[51:28] rich, and I know the blasphemy of them
[51:32] which say they are Jews, but they are
[51:34] not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
[51:37] Fear not of those things which thou
[51:39] shalt suffer. Behold, the devil shall
[51:43] cast some of you into prison, that ye
[51:45] may be tried, that ye shall have
[51:48] tribulation 10 days. You know that every
[51:50] day represented a hundred years or a
[51:52] thousand years in Smeirna. He be thou
[51:55] faithful. He says unto death and I will
[51:59] give thee a crown of life.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; My my my.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; But he doesn't hold back. He says you
[52:05] know some of you are going to really
[52:06] going to suffer. You're going to go you
[52:09] you you may even go to death, but you're
[52:11] going to receive a crown of life.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; In the smearing and church age in the
[52:16] church age book, paragraph 116-2,
[52:19] brother Brandham says this. Now the Lord
[52:21] God Almighty says, "I know
[52:25] there he is walking in the midst of his
[52:28] people.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; There he is, the chief shepherd of the
[52:32] flock.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; But does he hold back the persecution?
[52:38] Does he stem the tribulation? No, he
[52:41] does not.
[52:43] My my He simply says, "I know your
[52:47] tribulation.
[52:49] I am not at all unmindful of your
[52:53] suffering."
[52:54] What a stumbling block this is to so
[52:58] many people like Israel. They wonder if
[53:01] God really loves them. How can God be
[53:05] just just and loving if he stands by and
[53:09] watches his people suffer?
[53:12] Surely God won't let me suffer. You
[53:15] know, we don't understand the love of
[53:17] God.
[53:19] He says what that is what they asked in
[53:22] Malachi 1 1-3. The burden of the word of
[53:27] the Lord to Israel by Malachi. I have
[53:30] loved you sayaeth the Lord. Yet we say,
[53:33] "Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not
[53:36] Esau Jacob's brother? Sayaith the Lord.
[53:39] Yet I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau, and
[53:43] laid his mountains and his heritage
[53:45] waste for the dragons of the
[53:47] wilderness." You see, they could not
[53:50] figure out God's love. They thought that
[53:54] love meant no suffering.
[53:57] They thought that love meant a baby with
[54:00] parental care. Those of you that have a
[54:03] little baby, you only want to fly the
[54:05] land on his forehead. That that's
[54:07] parental care. That's not God. Our God
[54:11] is not like that. He has a purpose in
[54:14] what he allows in our life.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; He says, "But God said that his love was
[54:20] elective love." Hallelujah.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; The proof of his love is election.
[54:27] that no matter what happened, his love
[54:30] was proven truly by the fact that he
[54:34] they were chosen unto salvation. And
[54:37] this night I can say, "Praise be to God.
[54:39] We've been chosen to salvation." God has
[54:43] chosen us. Jesus said, "Many are
[54:45] called."
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Many. The call goes out. Whosoever will.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Israel. Whosoever will, let him
[54:54] come. Many are called but few are
[54:58] chosen.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; My my my think of that because God has
[55:03] chosen you to salvation through
[55:05] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[55:08] of the truth. He may commit, listen to
[55:10] this now, he may commit you to death as
[55:14] he did Paul.
[55:16] Wow, those are strong words.
[55:21] uh he says he may commit you to
[55:23] suffering as he did Job. That is his
[55:27] prerogative. He is sovereign
[55:30] &gt;&gt; but it is all with a purpose.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. If if he did not have a purpose
[55:38] then he would be the author of
[55:40] frustration and not of peace. His
[55:43] purpose is that after we have suffered a
[55:46] while we would be made perfect. be
[55:49] established, strengthened, and settled.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; As Job said, he put strength in us.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; And he says, you see, he himself
[55:57] suffered. He learned, Christ learned
[56:00] obedience by the things that he
[56:03] suffered. He was actually made perfect
[56:06] by the things that he suffered. In plain
[56:09] language, the very character of Jesus
[56:12] was perfected by suffering. And
[56:15] according to Paul in he has left his
[56:18] church a measure of suffering
[56:24] that they too by their faith in God
[56:28] while suffering for him would come to a
[56:31] place of perfection. I was telling
[56:34] brother Israel the word perfection. Many
[56:35] times we think of something that no no
[56:38] mistakes or you know something is just
[56:40] uh we use perfect but perfection many
[56:44] times it means to come of age to to come
[56:48] to maturity
[56:50] to become a man as Paul said when when I
[56:52] was a child I speak as a child I I I I
[56:55] as a child but when I became a man I put
[56:57] away childish things there's got to be
[57:00] maturity that come that comes into our
[57:02] life
[57:02] &gt;&gt; and and what brings that is this the
[57:06] things that God allows in our life, the
[57:08] things that go wrong, the things that go
[57:10] the way they shouldn't go sometimes and
[57:12] the pain and the heartache and all that
[57:13] we go through in life. And those of us
[57:15] that are 16, 15, 16 and above, you know
[57:17] what I'm talking about. Maybe some of
[57:19] younger ones have not suffered yet, the
[57:21] death of a loved one, but we have. And
[57:23] we know what it is. We know what the
[57:24] pain is to lose someone like that. And
[57:27] it's such a it's it's a it's a horrible
[57:29] thing, but but God knows how to use that
[57:32] to our good
[57:33] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says in Romans 8:28
[57:35] that that all things work together for
[57:37] good.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; All things work together for good to
[57:41] them that love God
[57:42] &gt;&gt; to them who are the called according to
[57:45] his purpose.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; There's this purpose always. He has a
[57:50] purpose. James 1 chapter verses 2 and 4.
[57:54] 2 to 4. My brethren, count it all joy
[57:57] when you fall into diverse temptations,
[57:59] knowing this, that the trying of your
[58:02] faith workketh patience. But let
[58:05] patience have her perfect work, that you
[58:08] may be perfect and entire, wanting
[58:11] nothing. There's that word perfect
[58:12] again. The the the that we're not how
[58:15] are we going to be perfected unless the
[58:18] trials come?
[58:20] &gt;&gt; How how are we going to be honed unless
[58:22] these things come against us? to to home
[58:25] that to bring that character because
[58:28] God's not working on this. He's working
[58:30] on our character.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; We understand that's the only thing
[58:32] we're taking home with us
[58:34] &gt;&gt; is our character. Amen.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; We're not taking our homes or our cars
[58:38] or our bank accounts. They're going to
[58:40] stay behind.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; But he's t we're taking our character
[58:44] &gt;&gt; and and and God is working on that
[58:47] because that's the only thing we're
[58:48] going to have up there. That's what's
[58:50] going to allow us to stand there with
[58:52] Christ as as kings and priests with
[58:55] character
[58:56] &gt;&gt; because we've gone through we've gone
[58:58] through the that that fiery furnace of
[59:01] temptations and of trials and
[59:03] heartaches. Romans 8:17 says, "And if
[59:06] children," he says, "then hes
[59:09] of God." Oh, we like that. Joiners with
[59:12] Christ. Yes. Amen. Yes. I love that.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; If so be.
[59:18] If so be
[59:20] &gt;&gt; that we suffer with him
[59:23] &gt;&gt; that we may be also glorified together.
[59:27] See, it's all through the Bible.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; For I reckon that the sufferings of this
[59:32] present time are not worthy to be
[59:36] compared with the glory which shall be
[59:40] revealed in us.
[59:42] My my my
[59:44] &gt;&gt; everything we go through, God is he's
[59:47] perfecting us. He's bringing us to that
[59:48] maturity that we become real men and
[59:52] women of God with backbone.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. With character that we know how to
[59:56] take our stand. Amen. We know when to
[59:59] when to speak and when not to speak.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; When is better to remain silent? We we
[1:00:04] we we're we're we're supposed to be uh
[1:00:06] uh led by the spirit of God every moment
[1:00:09] of our life, allowing the spirit of God
[1:00:11] to have control of our of our thoughts,
[1:00:14] having control of our of our words that
[1:00:17] we speak. Amen.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; In the spirit church 117-1,
[1:00:23] brother says, "Unless we suffer with
[1:00:24] him, we cannot reign with him."
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; My my you have to suffer to reign. Amen.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; The the reason for this is that
[1:00:35] character, and we've heard this many
[1:00:36] times, character simply is never made
[1:00:41] without suffering.
[1:00:43] Character is a victory,
[1:00:46] not a gift.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; A man without character can't reign
[1:00:51] because power apart from character is
[1:00:54] what?
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Satanic.
[1:00:57] But power with character is fit to rule.
[1:01:01] When we see men that are reigning here
[1:01:03] on earth now and have reigned in the
[1:01:04] past like Saddam Saddam Hussein and
[1:01:06] Adolf Hitler and Stalin and and all
[1:01:09] these men and even even Castro in Cuba
[1:01:12] and and these this man uh Kmeni
[1:01:15] Ayatollah over in in Iran how they've
[1:01:18] killed and murdered h some hundreds some
[1:01:22] thousands some millions. See that's
[1:01:24] that's reigning without character.
[1:01:27] There's no character in these men. But
[1:01:30] God won't bring us to that place. He'll
[1:01:32] not put that power in our in our hands
[1:01:34] unless we have the character to handle
[1:01:37] the power. He had Jesus had the
[1:01:40] character to handle the power.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; When he he when he lay on that cross
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; and he had the the power he said I can I
[1:01:49] can call my my father will send 12
[1:01:51] legions of angels.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; He had the power. It laid the tip of his
[1:01:56] tongue. Think of it in my mind's eye.
[1:01:58] back and see the archangel uh Gabriel
[1:02:02] standing there maybe not understanding
[1:02:04] the whole plan of God. You we we hear
[1:02:06] the song a song that brother John used
[1:02:08] to sing for us many a time where they're
[1:02:11] standing on there on the hill of Goltha
[1:02:14] and all the powers of Satan over here
[1:02:16] and all the powers of God. Maybe Gabriel
[1:02:18] and I see my mind's eye Gabriel standing
[1:02:20] there with his sword in his hand and
[1:02:22] saying Lord just speak the word Lord and
[1:02:26] I'll change the scene. Think of it. He
[1:02:29] had the power to change it, but he had
[1:02:33] character. He knew what he was doing.
[1:02:36] And there was a last night as I was
[1:02:38] praying, I was reading there where where
[1:02:41] Christ was at Gethsemane and and he was
[1:02:44] going through that great battle. And I
[1:02:46] thought, oh my, what a battle he had to
[1:02:49] fight, folks. You know, brother Brandon
[1:02:51] says he he went to he went to Calvary as
[1:02:55] a man like you and I. He couldn't die as
[1:02:59] God. He had to die as a man. He felt he
[1:03:04] he he he said, "Father, if it be
[1:03:07] possible, let this cup pass from me."
[1:03:10] You think he was just making words up?
[1:03:13] It was it was from the depth of his
[1:03:15] soul, his heart.
[1:03:17] That that part of him didn't want to do
[1:03:19] that because he knew how painful, how
[1:03:20] horrendous it would be. But he but he
[1:03:23] knew that if he didn't do it, we'd all
[1:03:26] be lost. And he did it for us. Next time
[1:03:29] you read the story of Gethsemane, I hope
[1:03:32] it touches you like that. You realize
[1:03:34] the price that he paid. He went to
[1:03:36] Calvary as a man. He suffered as a man.
[1:03:39] He died as a man. My my. So a man
[1:03:44] without character can't reign.
[1:03:47] Power without character is sitanic.
[1:03:50] And since he wants us to share
[1:03:53] even his throne on the same basis that
[1:03:55] he overcame and is sat down in his
[1:03:58] father's throne, then we have to
[1:04:00] overcome to sit with him.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to be sitting at the
[1:04:05] overcomers table.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're not an overcomer, you
[1:04:10] can't sit there. I'm sorry. But I pray
[1:04:12] every one of you this this evening are
[1:04:13] overcomers. Amen. And we're all going to
[1:04:16] sit at that table, the overcomers table.
[1:04:19] Amen. And the little temporary suffering
[1:04:21] he says we we go through now. Temporary.
[1:04:25] Come on. Temporary
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; suffering that we go through now is not
[1:04:29] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[1:04:31] glory that will be revealed in us when
[1:04:35] he comes. Oh, what treasures are laid up
[1:04:38] for those who are willing to enter into
[1:04:40] his kingdom through much tribulation.
[1:04:45] I like the song that says, "Must I be
[1:04:48] carried to the skies
[1:04:50] on flowery beds of ease
[1:04:54] while others fought
[1:04:56] to win the prize
[1:04:59] and sailed through bloody seas.
[1:05:03] Sure, I must fight if I would reign.
[1:05:08] Increase my courage, Lord." Would that
[1:05:11] be our prayer tonight? increase my c my
[1:05:14] courage, Lord. I'll bear the toil,
[1:05:16] endure the pain, supported by thy word.
[1:05:21] I'm so glad that the, you know, the word
[1:05:23] of God, as I was talking on the Bible,
[1:05:25] 8,800 promises in the word of God.
[1:05:28] Here's one. Psalms 34:17-19.
[1:05:31] The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth
[1:05:33] and deliverth them out of all their
[1:05:35] troubles. The Lord is nigh unto them
[1:05:38] that are of a broken heart,
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; and saveth such as be of a contrite
[1:05:43] spirit.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Many are the afflictions of the
[1:05:47] righteous.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; I said many are the afflictions. Are you
[1:05:51] hearing me this evening?
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Many are the afflictions of the
[1:05:55] righteous, but the Lord deliver them out
[1:05:58] of them all. Hallelujah.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; He's my deliverer tonight.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Man, I might be afflicted, but
[1:06:05] I've got a deliverer. Hallelujah. I've
[1:06:07] got one that knows. He He's ordered
[1:06:10] these steps for me. He's watching my
[1:06:12] steps for me. He knows what's coming. He
[1:06:15] knows that I can endure.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; He He knows. He's placed it in me.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; There has no temptation taken you, but
[1:06:22] such as is coming to man. But God is
[1:06:24] faithful. who will not suffer you to be
[1:06:27] tempted above that you're able
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; but will with the temptation also
[1:06:33] provide a way to escape
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; that you might be able to bear it and
[1:06:38] that's it brothers just bear it
[1:06:41] temporary. It's only for a short while.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; One day we'll break through all this and
[1:06:46] we'll step into eternity.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:06:54] Amen.
[1:06:57] 1 Peter 4:12-16 says, "Beloved, I think
[1:07:01] think not strange concerning the fiery
[1:07:04] trial which is to try you." It's
[1:07:07] talking. It's a sure thing like I guess
[1:07:10] death in taxes. You're going to get
[1:07:13] tried. If you're a Christian, you're
[1:07:14] going to get tried. You're going to
[1:07:15] suffer for that.
[1:07:17] You know, before when Satan had you as a
[1:07:19] trophy in his in his little cabinet
[1:07:22] cabinet up there, he worried about you.
[1:07:24] As soon as you start serving God, he's
[1:07:26] like, "Who's this?" And they all start
[1:07:28] turning their eyes toward you. And then
[1:07:31] now you're under the guns. There was no
[1:07:34] battle back then, but you were losing.
[1:07:36] You're you're going to hell, but now
[1:07:39] you're going to heaven. Now you've got a
[1:07:40] battle in your hands.
[1:07:43] You've got you've got you've got every
[1:07:45] trained gun trained upon you
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; to destroy you. Amen.
[1:07:51] As it says, many of the afflictions of
[1:07:53] the righteous, but the Lord deliver them
[1:07:55] out of them all.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't think it's strange. Why
[1:08:00] am I going through this?
[1:08:03] You ever had pastors, pastors, someone
[1:08:05] come why am I why am I suffering this?
[1:08:08] Why is this happening to me? People ask
[1:08:10] that question. It's a It's a good
[1:08:12] question to ask if they don't know the
[1:08:14] answer. But if we're serving God,
[1:08:17] there's your answer right there.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Don't think it's strange. Don't Don't
[1:08:21] think it's something that shouldn't be
[1:08:23] happening. It should be happening.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; It's going to happen. It's it's a sure
[1:08:28] thing.
[1:08:29] As though some strange thing happened
[1:08:31] unto you. He said, "But rejoice in as
[1:08:34] much as you are partakers of Christ, of
[1:08:37] Christ's sufferings.
[1:08:39] But when his glory shall be revealed, ye
[1:08:42] may be glad also with exceeding oh my I
[1:08:45] think just one minute in that presence.
[1:08:48] We're gonna forget all of that.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; We It won't even come through our mind,
[1:08:53] brother Israel, no more. We won't even
[1:08:55] think about it anymore. Hallelujah.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; It could have been the worst. You might
[1:08:59] have been gone through the worst trials
[1:09:00] of your life of anybody here. But it
[1:09:03] doesn't matter. One minute, one second
[1:09:05] in the presence of God will change all
[1:09:07] of that. What glory
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; God has prepared for us.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Oh exceeding glory. Hallelujah.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; My my my.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; He says here, he said, "You may be glad
[1:09:21] with all exceeding joy if you be repro
[1:09:23] reproached for the name of Christ. Happy
[1:09:26] are ye."
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; They can call us a cult all they want.
[1:09:31] To them, anybody that doesn't believe
[1:09:32] the Trinity is a cult.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; You can call me a cult all you want. I'm
[1:09:37] I don't believe in no three gods.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe in one God.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; His name is Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; So here here we we're going to get
[1:09:46] reproached. Don't be ashamed.
[1:09:50] Don't be ashamed of that. Let him call
[1:09:52] you a brandomite. I take that badge with
[1:09:55] honor.
[1:09:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, that you find me worthy
[1:10:01] enough to to even carry the name of of
[1:10:03] of a great man named Brandom. a great
[1:10:07] man of God.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; If ye be reproached for the name of
[1:10:11] Christ, happy are ye, for the spirit of
[1:10:13] glory of God restth upon you. On their
[1:10:16] part, he is evil spoken of, but on your
[1:10:19] part, he's glorified. My my my. Can you
[1:10:23] imagine that? Our life is glorifying
[1:10:24] him. That's why we're here on earth.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; We're here to glorify him.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Our life should be a a glory to our Lord
[1:10:32] Jesus.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Blessed be his name. But let none of you
[1:10:37] suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as
[1:10:41] an evildoer. I know some brothers that
[1:10:43] that are in prison today. And they were
[1:10:45] brothers, but they did wrong things.
[1:10:48] They're suffering. They're not suffering
[1:10:49] for as Christians. They're suffering for
[1:10:51] e for evil they did.
[1:10:54] And maybe they deserve what they're
[1:10:55] getting. And God will forgive them.
[1:10:58] They're in prison. And I believe God can
[1:11:00] forgive a man in prison. You believe
[1:11:01] that, brother Israel?
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; But you know something? I've always said
[1:11:04] this. I might have said it here before
[1:11:06] that we're all farmers. Did you know you
[1:11:08] as a farmer, we're planting seeds every
[1:11:11] day?
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Come on. Every choice we make is a is a
[1:11:14] seed
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; we plant.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; If you make the wrong choice, you
[1:11:18] planted the wrong seed and you keep
[1:11:20] planting those seeds. Just wait a little
[1:11:23] while. You're going to have a harvest.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; The wrong kind of a harvest.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; You see, God will forgive you. But then
[1:11:30] you got to deal with that harvest.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; You got to deal Amen. What you reap, you
[1:11:36] reap. What you sow is the law of God.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; It is a law of God. It's unbendable.
[1:11:43] It's unbreakable. What you sow, you will
[1:11:47] reap.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; God will forgive you.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; But you got to deal with those things.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; It's going to be that much harder.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; It's going to be that much more
[1:11:55] difficult.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; It's going to take that much more
[1:11:57] surrender.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:12:02] Let none of us suffer as a murderer or
[1:12:04] as a thief or as an evildoer or as a
[1:12:07] busy body in other men's matters. Yet if
[1:12:10] any man suffer as a Christian,
[1:12:13] hallelujah, let him not be ashamed.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Don't don't be ashamed. If if they they
[1:12:19] if they call you sister because you you
[1:12:21] you're you're dressed decently in this
[1:12:24] world that we're living in right now.
[1:12:27] You stand out like you know you you know
[1:12:28] you do you stand out like a circle. I
[1:12:30] can I can look across a Walmart or
[1:12:32] whatever and see some see some ladies
[1:12:34] and oh their message
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; right away. I I can pick you up because
[1:12:39] you're you you're you're you're an
[1:12:41] you're you're you're like an emblem like
[1:12:44] a like something that's just you you you
[1:12:47] what's the word I want to say? You're a
[1:12:48] representation
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; of the church of the living God.
[1:12:53] Because the church is is a is is typed
[1:12:55] as a woman and you as women, God God has
[1:12:58] given you that. Amen. Brother B said
[1:13:00] your body is a sacred thing. You want to
[1:13:03] cover it up. Amen.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; And the world is is a different way. But
[1:13:08] you you God God will bless you for that.
[1:13:10] Don't be ashamed of that.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Wear it as as a badge of honor. Amen.
[1:13:15] that you are a child, a daughter of God,
[1:13:18] and you conduct yourself as one. Like
[1:13:20] that slave that would walk around and
[1:13:22] with his chest out and and they, oh, we
[1:13:25] want to buy him. Oh, he's not for sale.
[1:13:27] Well, why is he different? Well, we
[1:13:28] found out that back home, he's a son of
[1:13:30] a king. Hallelujah.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Back home, you're a daughter of the king
[1:13:34] this evening.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Back home, we're the sons of the king.
[1:13:37] Hallelujah.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:42] Spirit and church age 117-2. Think it
[1:13:45] not strange. Well, I think I read this
[1:13:47] already. I think I must have gone up.
[1:13:50] You know, every child, Brother Brand
[1:13:52] says, must be tested and tried.
[1:13:56] And we're going to be tried. God's going
[1:13:58] to try us. He's going to see if we're
[1:14:01] made up of the the stuff we should be
[1:14:02] made up of. If we're the real thing.
[1:14:06] Hebrews 12:6 it says, "For whom the Lord
[1:14:08] loveth, he chastineth and scourgeth."
[1:14:11] You know, a son of God, brother Israel,
[1:14:13] he don't get away with anything.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; If you're a if you're a child of God,
[1:14:17] daughter, daughter of God, you don't get
[1:14:20] away with anything. You ever notice
[1:14:21] that?
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Every time it never fails.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; We find out all we find ourselves on our
[1:14:28] knees saying, "Oh, God, I sure messed
[1:14:30] up. Please forgive me.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; I sure messed. father just have have
[1:14:34] have mercy upon me.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Because we don't get away with anything.
[1:14:38] And the Bible says here, "Whom the Lord
[1:14:40] loveth, he chastineth
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; and scourgeth every son whom he
[1:14:45] receiveth."
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; If you endure chastening, God dealeth
[1:14:49] with you as a as with sons. Hallelujah.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; For what son is he whom the father
[1:14:55] chastineth not? But if ye be without
[1:14:58] chastisement,
[1:15:00] whereof all are partakers, then are ye
[1:15:03] bastards and not sons. Well, I'm so glad
[1:15:07] that I don't get away with anything.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. You know, I cannot
[1:15:13] chasen somebody else's child. Sometimes
[1:15:16] I wish I could. Especially when you're
[1:15:18] standing behind the pull brother Israel
[1:15:20] and little kids, they're they're laying
[1:15:22] them people haven't been taught right.
[1:15:25] They just they're running up and down
[1:15:26] the the aisle or whatever, you know, and
[1:15:29] they just they're just riing. They just
[1:15:31] don't they don't sit down for a moment
[1:15:33] and and all they need is just a little
[1:15:35] bit of chastening. You don't have to
[1:15:37] hurt the child, but let them know this
[1:15:40] this is not done in church. This is
[1:15:42] church. My kids when they were two years
[1:15:44] old, they knew how to sit in church.
[1:15:47] They we used to go to a church where our
[1:15:48] services were six hours long
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; and they learned they learned real quick
[1:15:53] as soon as they start getting I would
[1:15:54] take them and I take them outside
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; and I and I give them a little bit of a
[1:15:58] on the backside and then I wait till
[1:16:01] they stop crying and I bring them back
[1:16:02] inside and sit down and then they did it
[1:16:05] again. I sometimes in service I got up
[1:16:07] three times. But let me tell you
[1:16:09] something. It only took about two weeks.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Two weeks of that and they're done. They
[1:16:14] know what's going to happen. Kids are
[1:16:16] smarter than we are. Believe me, the
[1:16:18] little guys, they're smarter than we
[1:16:19] are. They understand. And so, you teach
[1:16:22] a child how to behave. Amen. And like I
[1:16:25] some I can't I cannot chastise somebody
[1:16:28] else's child, but I could chastise mine.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; And God don't just chastise other other
[1:16:34] children that are not his. He'll
[1:16:36] chastise his kids.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; If we're his kids this evening, he's
[1:16:41] gonna he's going to chastise us. He's
[1:16:44] not going to let us get away with
[1:16:45] anything. And I praise God for that. I'm
[1:16:48] glad that God is he does that with us.
[1:16:51] Amen. In Proverbs 3 11 and 12, my son
[1:16:55] despise not the chastening of the Lord.
[1:16:57] Neither be weary of his correction. For
[1:17:00] whom the Lord loveth, he correcteth even
[1:17:03] as the father the son in whom he
[1:17:05] delightth.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; My my my.
[1:17:08] In spirit churches 117-3.
[1:17:11] Now this special condition of smeirnina
[1:17:14] must be applied to every age.
[1:17:18] But we spoke about smeirnina. There is
[1:17:20] no age free from it.
[1:17:24] See there is no true believer free from
[1:17:26] it. This is of God. Listen. He says
[1:17:30] he'll put you on a on a he'll put you to
[1:17:32] he he'll take you to death. He'll he'll
[1:17:35] he'll allow all the one place he says
[1:17:36] he'll bring tensions in the church in
[1:17:38] your church to test you. Come on. In the
[1:17:42] church,
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; he he'll he'll he'll put you in a
[1:17:45] hospital. Whatever it takes,
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; God will do. And here, brother says,
[1:17:50] "This is of God. This is the will of
[1:17:54] God. It is needful." My my my. We need
[1:18:00] the Lord to teach us the truth that we
[1:18:02] are to suffer and be Christlike in doing
[1:18:06] it. love sufferth long and is kind. See,
[1:18:11] character
[1:18:13] comes at a cost.
[1:18:16] It comes as as as with sacrifice.
[1:18:19] We we here in this lady seeing lazy
[1:18:21] church age sometimes that spirit gets
[1:18:24] around us.
[1:18:26] We become lazy. We don't want to pay a
[1:18:28] price.
[1:18:30] We don't know what it is to sacrifice
[1:18:31] anymore.
[1:18:33] you know you this this evening coming to
[1:18:35] church that you came to church tonight
[1:18:37] it was a sacrifice
[1:18:40] and it's also it's an investment that
[1:18:42] you given to the kingdom of god but you
[1:18:44] know we we need to realize that that it
[1:18:47] takes sacrifice
[1:18:49] you think William Tinddale wasn't didn't
[1:18:51] know the the price that he would pay for
[1:18:54] what he did but yet he did it he paid a
[1:18:57] price it was a great sacrifice for him
[1:19:00] and all those that that have suffered in
[1:19:02] the past because of sacrifice. People
[1:19:05] today in this day and age, they don't
[1:19:07] want to sacrifice. It's too hard to to
[1:19:10] to spend an hour or two reading their
[1:19:12] Bible. But we we can sure get on with
[1:19:15] Facebook or Tik Tok or I don't know what
[1:19:18] they call these things. And we can spend
[1:19:20] hours.
[1:19:22] Come on.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; We can do that. Stand in front of a
[1:19:26] television or play video games or
[1:19:29] whatever it might be.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Uh you know, but to to to to take a
[1:19:34] sacrifice to go and sit down somewhere
[1:19:37] and get your Bible and start reading and
[1:19:38] praying and meditating upon God and
[1:19:41] spending two or three hours a day doing
[1:19:44] that. Can we do that? Can we sacrifice
[1:19:47] that much? I know we're busy. I know
[1:19:48] there's some of you are really busy. You
[1:19:50] got a lot you got a lot on your plate,
[1:19:52] but you've got to take the time. It's
[1:19:54] for it's for your own good. That's what
[1:19:56] strengthens you.
[1:19:59] I I preached a message some time ago. I
[1:20:01] think it was with a with a men and I
[1:20:03] talked about prayer and you know prayer
[1:20:06] is is the victory is won on our knees.
[1:20:10] It's not won when we're out there and
[1:20:12] the temptation comes and we're and we
[1:20:14] and we went over it. No, it was won won
[1:20:17] back there on our knees. I saw a picture
[1:20:20] some years ago.
[1:20:22] She must have been a Pentecostal lady, a
[1:20:24] black a black lady, long hair, decently
[1:20:27] dressed. She's on her knees and she
[1:20:29] knows she's touching God. Her hands are
[1:20:31] up in the air like this and she's just
[1:20:33] praising the Lord and and that really
[1:20:36] caught me because I said, "Wow, that's
[1:20:38] that's a beautiful picture of a of a
[1:20:40] young lady, her dress, ride and hairs
[1:20:43] and and just worshiping God and on her
[1:20:45] knees." But what it said underneath
[1:20:48] really caught my attention. It said,
[1:20:50] "This is how I fight my battles.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; This is how I fight my battles." How do
[1:20:56] I fight my battles? I you sit somewhere
[1:20:59] you read the you read the word of God.
[1:21:00] You listen to a tape. You spend that
[1:21:02] free what free time you have. You give
[1:21:05] it to the Lord. That sacrifice, you
[1:21:08] know, the flesh would rather probably
[1:21:09] watch Facebook or Tik Tok or or whatever
[1:21:12] they have out there. I'm not real coined
[1:21:15] with all that stuff, but you know, if we
[1:21:17] spend that time with God, Amen. And that
[1:21:20] strengthens the inner man.
[1:21:23] It gives us strength that when we're
[1:21:25] we're in the temptation,
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. we have the power, Amen. to to be
[1:21:30] victorious over it
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; and to win in every battle that we come.
[1:21:34] We're we're we should be a church of
[1:21:36] gate takers tonight.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. every gate that's before us that
[1:21:42] we are ready to to take it immediately
[1:21:45] because we're walking in the light of
[1:21:48] the word of this day that strengthens us
[1:21:51] every hour. Amen. To that every victory
[1:21:55] for that God has given us. Amen. Others
[1:21:58] have fought those those those fights and
[1:21:59] those battles before us and now it's
[1:22:01] fallen in our hands. Amen. We have we
[1:22:05] have to continue on with his torch and
[1:22:07] take this battle to the devil and
[1:22:09] destroy him on every hand.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; God has given us that.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; We are more than victors. We are more
[1:22:15] than conquerors. The Bible said through
[1:22:17] him that loved us.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. What shall separate us from the
[1:22:21] love of Christ till tribulation distress
[1:22:23] or nakedness or peril or sword? Amen. As
[1:22:26] it is written, we are killed all the day
[1:22:28] long. We are as accounted as sheep for
[1:22:30] the slaughter. My He's on us every day.
[1:22:33] 24 hours a day, seven, seven days a
[1:22:36] week, all year long. He don't let up.
[1:22:39] But man, we are more than conquerors.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; That power that lays within us. Amen.
[1:22:45] Just let it be unleashed. Amen. But you
[1:22:47] got to be the right kind of vessel.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; You've got to be a vessel that's paying
[1:22:51] that that sacrifice and and sacrificing
[1:22:54] yourself to the Lord and giving him. The
[1:22:56] Bible says that we should be a living
[1:22:58] sacrifice. That's that's scriptural.
[1:23:00] Friends,
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; I beseech you, brethren, by the mercy of
[1:23:03] God that you present your body as a
[1:23:05] living sacrifice,
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; holy,
[1:23:09] acceptable, not unto yourself or unto
[1:23:11] the pastor or somebody unto God,
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; holy, acceptable unto the Lord, which is
[1:23:17] your reasonable service. It's a given.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; God expects that from us.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That our lives should be holy
[1:23:24] before him.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; My my my.
[1:23:28] And if they're not, because we're not
[1:23:29] spending enough time fighting our
[1:23:32] battles.
[1:23:33] How do we fight our battles? On our
[1:23:35] knees.
[1:23:36] How do we win them? On our knees.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Pray that you enter not
[1:23:43] into temptation."
[1:23:45] It's one thing to be tempted. It's
[1:23:47] another thing to enter into the
[1:23:49] temptation. We're all tempted.
[1:23:53] To be tempted is not sin. It's when you
[1:23:55] allow that sin to to come on your life,
[1:23:58] you enter into it. Jesus said, "Pray
[1:24:00] that you enter not." Amen. Character
[1:24:03] comes as a as a cost.
[1:24:05] Matthew 5:11-12,
[1:24:09] Jesus said, "Blessed are ye when men
[1:24:11] shall revile you and persecute you and
[1:24:16] say all manner of evil against you
[1:24:18] falsely for my sake." He says, "Rejoice
[1:24:22] again." Every time we should we be
[1:24:23] rejoicing and be exceeding glad for
[1:24:26] great is your reward in heaven for so
[1:24:29] persecuted they the prophets which were
[1:24:31] before you.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Again the spirit and church age 118-11.
[1:24:37] The cloudy skies and the storms of life
[1:24:40] are no signs of God's disapproval. If
[1:24:43] you're going through a hard time right
[1:24:45] now that doesn't mean God's against you.
[1:24:48] God's ordering your steps, friend.
[1:24:51] He's watching over you.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; You're the apple of his eye. Hallelujah.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Do you ever see yourself that way?
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; The apple I'm the apple of God's eye.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; God really cares for me.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Cast your cares upon
[1:25:08] him."
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; For he cares.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; He cares for you.
[1:25:15] The cloudy skies and storms of life are
[1:25:17] no signs of God's disapproval. Neither
[1:25:20] are bright skies and still waters signs
[1:25:22] of his love and approval. Neither
[1:25:25] neither or. His approval of any of us is
[1:25:29] only in the beloved.
[1:25:32] His love is elective which he had for us
[1:25:36] before the foundation of the world.
[1:25:41] Does he love us? Ah yes. But how shall
[1:25:44] we know? We shall know.
[1:25:48] Brother is because he said so.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; He said he don't lie.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; My God don't lie.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; He's truth. He is He is the very the
[1:25:59] very foundation of all truth. He's a
[1:26:01] fountain of all truth.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Why? How am I going to know Lord that
[1:26:06] you love me? Son, I I I said so. I told
[1:26:10] you that I love you.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; That should be enough.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; His word is enough. Amen. I said his
[1:26:17] word is enough.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; He says here and it says we shall know
[1:26:24] because he said so and manifested that
[1:26:26] he did love us for he brought us to
[1:26:28] himself and gave us of his spirit
[1:26:31] placing us as sons. How shall I prove my
[1:26:34] love to him? By believing what he said
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; and by conducting myself with joy amidst
[1:26:41] the trials.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Anybody got any trials tonight? Come on,
[1:26:46] don't be afraid to raise up your hand.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; We all got trials.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; We all got temptations.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; If you if you don't, you're dead. Better
[1:26:56] check your pulse. If you don't have any
[1:26:58] trials or temptations,
[1:27:01] he says here, "Conducting thyself with
[1:27:05] joy amidst the trials that he in his
[1:27:07] wisdom allows to come to pass." My my
[1:27:12] my. So because everything is going good
[1:27:15] and oh I got money in the bank, my tank
[1:27:17] is full of gas and I feel good and my
[1:27:20] children are okay. That doesn't mean
[1:27:22] that God is is is could be happy with
[1:27:25] you. You understand what I'm saying?
[1:27:27] Doesn't mean that that everything is
[1:27:29] good with God. Just like if everything
[1:27:31] is going wrong and everybody's sick and
[1:27:33] you and you're broke and you can't make
[1:27:35] your you can't even make a payment on
[1:27:36] the mortgage or whatever, it doesn't
[1:27:38] mean that God's against you.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. measure your life. You know, Paul
[1:27:43] said, "Examine yourself
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; to see if you're in the faith or not."
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "What?" He says, "Don't you
[1:27:50] know yourself.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Don't you know?" He said, "I I don't
[1:27:54] know. You don't know me, but you know
[1:27:56] yourself. I know myself. I know this
[1:27:59] guy.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; I know the problems he gives me."
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; I said, "The worst the worst enemy we
[1:28:06] got is the one that looks at us in the
[1:28:07] mirror when we're brushing our teeth.
[1:28:09] That's the guy we got to watch out for.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He says now
[1:28:18] he said how by believing what he said
[1:28:20] and by conducting myself with joy amidst
[1:28:23] a trial. That's that's the key to find
[1:28:26] the joy in the trial.
[1:28:28] To find how can it be you say you you'd
[1:28:32] have to be mad or crazy but no but
[1:28:34] there's something it's on the inside. He
[1:28:36] can't get on the inside. He can attack
[1:28:39] this outside all he wants. He can attack
[1:28:41] my mind and depress me. I was reading
[1:28:44] some of David's writings and he says
[1:28:46] why? He's talking about his depression.
[1:28:47] He's so depressed and he doesn't know
[1:28:49] what to do and he's asking God why am I
[1:28:51] like this? I'm just par paraphrasing
[1:28:53] that. But you know he went through
[1:28:55] depressions. David did. Who who who
[1:28:59] doesn't from time to time.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; We all go through depressions. Sometimes
[1:29:03] you can wake up after a good Sunday
[1:29:04] night, wake up on Monday morning and
[1:29:06] you're depressed and don't even know why
[1:29:10] because he's got access to this. But
[1:29:12] there's something on the inside of the
[1:29:13] inside.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God put a no fishing sign
[1:29:17] there. He says, "Satan, you stay away.
[1:29:20] That belongs to me."
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; That's a soul. Amen. That's the eternal
[1:29:23] part. That's a part he predestinated.
[1:29:26] That's a part that we're that's going to
[1:29:28] see God again. Hallelujah. This flesh
[1:29:31] will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; But that soul, hallelujah, will stand in
[1:29:36] his presence.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. In first John 3:1, behold
[1:29:42] what manner of love the father has
[1:29:45] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:29:47] called the sons of God. That's God's
[1:29:50] love.
[1:29:51] Amen. He chose us. He He bestowed that
[1:29:55] upon us. Therefore, the world knoweth us
[1:29:59] not. Amen. In the world, we're just a
[1:30:01] sore thumb sticking out. We don't listen
[1:30:04] to their dirty jokes and their and all
[1:30:06] their cor all their talking about sports
[1:30:08] and I don't even know who got a
[1:30:09] touchdown or who I don't know when the
[1:30:11] Super Bowl has already passed or still I
[1:30:13] don't know. I have no idea. I don't
[1:30:15] care.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with me.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; And and 10 years now, who cares who won
[1:30:20] the touchdown? Who had the winning
[1:30:22] touchdown for the for the game? Nobody
[1:30:23] cares anymore. It's all temporal.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; And those men that were playing on the
[1:30:28] field, a lot of them afterwards are
[1:30:30] fighting dementia from all the hits they
[1:30:32] took on their head.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; And a lot of them, they've lost all the
[1:30:35] money they had because they didn't know
[1:30:36] how to handle it. They're they're poor
[1:30:38] and their bums and and they're living on
[1:30:40] the streets
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; when one time they were in a Super Bowl.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; That's the world.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the pay that they get.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; But there's a glory that's awaiting us.
[1:30:51] Amen.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; It's Amen. The bi Bible says that our
[1:30:54] mind our we can't even imagine
[1:30:58] how wonderful it is.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. What manner of love has the father
[1:31:03] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:31:05] called that what a what an honor brother
[1:31:09] Israel this brother min to be called a
[1:31:12] son of god.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; No greater honor amen that god should
[1:31:17] bestow upon me to be a son of god.
[1:31:21] No, even the president, the kings, they
[1:31:25] never attained that honor. We will, we
[1:31:29] have attained an honor way above
[1:31:32] anything in this world with his
[1:31:34] temporaless.
[1:31:35] 1 John 3:1 says, "Behold, what manner of
[1:31:37] love has he says, therefore the world
[1:31:39] knoweth us not because it knew him not."
[1:31:44] 1 John 4:10, here it is love, not that
[1:31:46] we loved God, but that he loved us and
[1:31:50] sent his son to be a propitiation for
[1:31:53] our sins. First John 4:19, we love him
[1:31:58] because he first loved us. Do you
[1:31:59] realize how how John would write about
[1:32:02] love? Little children, love one another
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; because love, God is love, he would say.
[1:32:09] And you would think, surely, John, you
[1:32:11] got greater revelations of that. Uh you
[1:32:14] you know, John, you you were on the
[1:32:16] aisle of Pat. Listen, man. You you you
[1:32:19] saw the church ages as they unfolded
[1:32:23] before you. You you saw the the
[1:32:26] messengers. You saw you saw the
[1:32:28] messenger came in this last church. You
[1:32:30] looked into the eternal day. You look
[1:32:32] you saw the judgment, the white throne,
[1:32:34] judgment, and the eternal day. be all
[1:32:36] that. Surely you've got you you you you
[1:32:40] were there when when the seven thunders
[1:32:43] sounded out and you you were you were
[1:32:45] John, you were about to write them down.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Think of it. What revelations, John, you
[1:32:52] have
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; and he comes back with the middle.
[1:32:56] Little children
[1:32:58] love one another.
[1:33:00] Amen. For love is that's that's of God.
[1:33:04] You say you love your God and and you
[1:33:06] hate your brother.
[1:33:08] He says the love of God is not in you.
[1:33:10] You're a liar.
[1:33:12] He he he put such an emphasis
[1:33:15] for us to love one. There was that to me
[1:33:19] there. If there's a revelation you could
[1:33:20] receive that's above every revelation is
[1:33:22] to have love one for the other because
[1:33:26] Satan he knows how to come in
[1:33:30] and cause differences among a group.
[1:33:34] He's an expert. He's been doing it for a
[1:33:35] long time. We're no match for him. We
[1:33:38] need to come back to the word and
[1:33:40] regardless of what I think my sister my
[1:33:42] brother said still say Lord I want to
[1:33:46] love that person. You know, if if you if
[1:33:49] you have somebody in your I'm going to
[1:33:50] I'm going to quit now, but I don't want
[1:33:52] to hold you too long as I think I
[1:33:54] already have.
[1:33:56] But you know, if
[1:33:58] you think that I lost my train of
[1:34:01] thought
[1:34:04] happened to you, brother Minnow,
[1:34:07] I'm 72, so I guess I got a good excuse.
[1:34:10] Brother Israel don't have an excuse yet.
[1:34:12] He's too young. Amen.
[1:34:16] 1 Peter 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God
[1:34:18] and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:34:20] which according to the abundance mercy
[1:34:22] hath begotten us again unto a lively
[1:34:25] hope of the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:34:26] from the dead to an inheritance
[1:34:28] incorruptible, undefiled, and death
[1:34:31] fadeth not away." It's not temporal,
[1:34:33] friends. Everything here is temporal.
[1:34:35] You buy a new car, oh, it's got that
[1:34:38] smell good. That new car smell good.
[1:34:40] Just give it a couple of years. After
[1:34:42] you paying the paying the uh the monthly
[1:34:44] payment, it gets old real quick. You got
[1:34:46] a new house that goes, it gets old real
[1:34:48] quick. Everything here is temporal.
[1:34:51] Every joy this world could produce,
[1:34:54] every euphoria, everything, every high
[1:34:57] is temporal.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; But God's highs are eternal. Hallelujah.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; I said God's highs are eternal.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my. His blessings are eternal.
[1:35:10] There's no time limit to it.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:35:14] Hallelujah.
[1:35:16] Verse six. Wherein we greatly rejoice.
[1:35:19] For now, for a season, if need be, ye
[1:35:22] are in heaviness through manifold
[1:35:24] temptations, that the trial of your
[1:35:26] faith, being much more precious than of
[1:35:29] gold that perisheth, though it be tried
[1:35:32] with fire, might be found unto praise
[1:35:35] and honor and glory at the appearing of
[1:35:38] Jesus Christ. It's worth more than gold,
[1:35:41] friends.
[1:35:43] that character that comes out.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Bram talked about
[1:35:46] himself where God took him like a rose
[1:35:49] and crushed him to get the fragrance
[1:35:52] out.
[1:35:53] You know, sometimes God has to take us
[1:35:55] like that and crush us a little bit to
[1:35:58] cause a fragrance to come out. The right
[1:36:00] hopefully the right kind kind of
[1:36:02] fragrance does come out.
[1:36:05] So, I ask you as I close tonight, what
[1:36:07] is the difference between a believer and
[1:36:10] an unbeliever?
[1:36:12] What is the difference? You know the
[1:36:14] believer his house burns down. The
[1:36:17] unbeliever his house burns down. The
[1:36:20] unbeliever he loses the child. The
[1:36:23] believer he loses a child.
[1:36:26] So what's the difference?
[1:36:28] What's the difference? The pain is the
[1:36:30] same for both I would think. But there
[1:36:32] is a difference. See, God is doing
[1:36:36] something in our lives.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; We're in his hands. He has ordered our
[1:36:42] steps before us.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Every step that I take, I like that
[1:36:46] song. Every move that I make, every tear
[1:36:50] that I cry, he knows my name.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; There's there's there's something about
[1:36:55] that. There's a there's a a a intimacy
[1:37:00] between me and my God, between you and
[1:37:04] the Lord Jesus as he orders your steps
[1:37:07] and he brings you through these hard
[1:37:09] times. As we know, he he carried us
[1:37:12] through those hard times. He never left.
[1:37:15] I'll never leave you nor forsake you,
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; but I'll be with you until the end of
[1:37:20] the age.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. If if the musicians would come
[1:37:24] tonight,
[1:37:28] I just feel to sing one song and then
[1:37:31] I'll be giving it back to brother Israel
[1:37:32] or or the song leader, whoever comes
[1:37:35] here. But
[1:37:39] I want to live
[1:37:42] the way he wants me to live.
[1:37:45] I want to walk the steps he has ordained
[1:37:47] for me to walk.
[1:37:49] I want to be I want I want my heart to
[1:37:53] be encouraged every day. Not not a
[1:37:57] coward.
[1:37:59] God doesn't respect cowards.
[1:38:03] That armor that we're given in
[1:38:06] Ephesians,
[1:38:07] it's only for the front.
[1:38:10] There's no armor for the back.
[1:38:13] I don't want to be like Ephraim that
[1:38:15] turned his back on the day of battle and
[1:38:17] ran.
[1:38:18] but to stand.
[1:38:20] That's where the Bible says, "Stand,
[1:38:22] therefore,
[1:38:24] stand against the ws of the devil. For
[1:38:27] we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[1:38:28] but against principalities, against
[1:38:30] powers, against the rulers of the
[1:38:32] darkness of this world." Amen.
[1:38:36] We are to take a stand. Stand therefore
[1:38:39] stand having your loins
[1:38:41] uh girdled about and your and having a
[1:38:45] breastplate of righteousness, your feet
[1:38:47] shaw with a preparation. All this is for
[1:38:50] the front to face the enemy. Amen. To be
[1:38:53] able to live that life. Say, Lord, I
[1:38:54] want to live that life. How many want to
[1:38:56] live that life? Sacrifice.
[1:38:59] It's going to take sacrifice.
[1:39:01] It's going to take pain.
[1:39:03] Are you willing? Are you willing?
[1:39:06] There's a price to pay. Amen. That that
[1:39:09] that man that found that pearl a great
[1:39:11] price. Jesus said in the parable, he
[1:39:13] sold everything he had to go purchase
[1:39:16] that because that was more important
[1:39:18] than everything he had. He said, "He
[1:39:21] that loves son or father or mother more
[1:39:23] than me or son or daughter more than me
[1:39:25] is not worthy of me." Are we willing to
[1:39:28] pay the price and say, "Lord, I'm I'm
[1:39:31] going to live the way you want me to
[1:39:33] live as a promise to him." He's given us
[1:39:36] in this Bible over 8,000 promises. Can
[1:39:39] we give him just one?
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Can you give him just one? Say, "Lord, I
[1:39:45] want to live the way you want me to."
[1:39:47] You stand with me tonight. Amen.
[1:39:51] Hallelujah. Glory to God. I want to live
[1:39:57] the way
[1:40:00] he wants me to.
[1:40:05] I want to give
[1:40:09] until
[1:40:10] there's just no more
[1:40:15] to give. I want to know.
[1:40:20] Yes.
[1:40:23] There's just no more.
[1:40:28] I could never
[1:40:31] ever
[1:40:33] love the Lord.
[1:40:37] Father, tonight as we stand in this
[1:40:40] congregation here, Lord, every one of us
[1:40:43] knows ourselves, Lord, as we reminded
[1:40:46] tonight to to prove ourselves, to
[1:40:49] examine ourselves, to see if we're in
[1:40:52] the faith or not, Lord, are we somewhere
[1:40:55] wrong somewhere, Lord? Oh God, would you
[1:40:59] just show it to us, Lord, and that we
[1:41:01] can make it right? Because I I want to
[1:41:04] live, Lord, the the way you want me to
[1:41:06] live. I I want to give until there's
[1:41:08] just no more to give. I I'm willing to
[1:41:10] pay the price, Lord. Make the sacrifice,
[1:41:14] whatever it takes, Lord Jesus, that you
[1:41:18] might reign in this heart of mine, Lord.
[1:41:21] That I might be able to help others,
[1:41:24] Lord. that you would bless this this uh
[1:41:27] uh vessel here to be a blessing to
[1:41:31] others, Lord. And and that they could
[1:41:33] turn around and they could be a blessing
[1:41:35] to others. And Lord Jesus, they could
[1:41:37] just be a a a time of self-sacrifice of
[1:41:40] one for the other, putting our brother
[1:41:43] before us, Lord, preferring our brother
[1:41:46] before us. And Lord, not thinking of
[1:41:48] ourselves as being too highly. And Lord,
[1:41:51] humbling ourselves in your presence.
[1:41:52] Realize that as the prophet said, we're
[1:41:54] nothing. We are nothing, Lord. And we
[1:41:58] until we realize that we're nothing.
[1:42:00] Then God can come and make something out
[1:42:02] of that nothing. And Lord, tonight,
[1:42:05] Father, as we surrender and and we sing
[1:42:07] this song as a promise to you, not just
[1:42:11] words to speak out in a little nice
[1:42:13] little harmony, not because it sounds
[1:42:16] just right to the ear, but Lord, may it
[1:42:18] sound right to the heart as we sing
[1:42:21] this, Father. And and we just give our
[1:42:23] hearts to you, Lord, and say, "Father,
[1:42:25] this Sunday night, I I'm going to drive
[1:42:27] my stake in the ground tonight."
[1:42:29] Hallelujah. this 11th of January of
[1:42:32] 2026.
[1:42:34] And who'd ever thought we'd be here
[1:42:36] tonight, Lord, but you knew, Lord, we we
[1:42:40] drive the stake down and say, Lord, as
[1:42:42] of tonight, I'm willing to pay the
[1:42:44] price. I'm willing I'm willing to
[1:42:46] sacrifice, Lord. Lord, that I might be a
[1:42:49] living sacrifice unto God. Oh, bringing
[1:42:53] every thought to the obedience of
[1:42:54] Christ, Lord, as as I give myself to
[1:42:58] you, Lord Jesus.
[1:43:00] Father, we just ask it, Lord, as we sing
[1:43:03] this promise to you. Father, receive it
[1:43:05] from every every heart tonight. Lord,
[1:43:08] I'm going to live
[1:43:12] the way
[1:43:15] he wants me.
[1:43:20] I want to give
[1:43:24] until there's just more
[1:43:29] to give. I want to love
[1:43:36] to
[1:43:38] just no more love.
[1:43:43] I could never
[1:43:46] ever out love.
[1:43:49] Tell him that one more time.
[1:43:53] I am going to live
[1:43:56] the way
[1:44:00] he wants me to live.
[1:44:05] I'm going to give
[1:44:09] until there's just no
[1:44:14] to.
[1:44:16] I'm going to love
[1:44:20] love love till there's just no more
[1:44:25] love.
[1:44:27] I can never
[1:44:30] ever out
[1:44:34] of
[1:44:53] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let me enjoy the
[1:44:56] word of the Lord
[1:44:58] tonight. And so, um, this is brother
[1:45:01] Andy's,
[1:45:03] uh, father-in-law and mother-in-law,
[1:45:06] and they are going back to Haiti,
[1:45:09] and they've been with us for some time,
[1:45:12] and we certainly thank the Lord for the
[1:45:14] fellowship that we've had with them.
[1:45:17] They don't speak English,
[1:45:20] but they have been here rejoicing with
[1:45:22] us for some time.
[1:45:24] And if you heard the news and what's
[1:45:26] going on in Haiti,
[1:45:28] it's a lot of trauma and troubles there,
[1:45:31] bandits and gang members that have taken
[1:45:35] over uh many of those areas.
[1:45:39] And uh we're going to pray that the Lord
[1:45:40] Jesus would place his hand over their
[1:45:43] life.
[1:45:45] They wanted us to pray for them and and
[1:45:48] that's what we're going to do tonight
[1:45:50] and just commit them into God's hands.
[1:45:53] And um I'm going to ask the brothers of
[1:45:56] the church to come forward and even some
[1:45:59] whoever would like to come and just
[1:46:01] surround them as we pray for for them
[1:46:04] and pray God's blessings upon them
[1:46:08] as
[1:46:10] we send them forth as lambs amongst
[1:46:14] wolves as it were.
[1:46:18] But he orders our steps.
[1:46:21] Brother Robert, the steps of the
[1:46:22] righteous are ordered of the Lord.
[1:46:26] And we know the Lord Jesus has it all
[1:46:29] under control. We don't understand it
[1:46:31] all,
[1:46:32] but Lord, you understand. So, let's bow
[1:46:35] our heads as we pray. Lord Jesus,
[1:46:40] for my dear brother and my dear sister,
[1:46:43] we lay our hands upon them, Lord, and
[1:46:47] ask you, Lord Jesus, that you would lay
[1:46:49] your hands upon their life.
[1:46:52] Oh God, go before them,
[1:46:56] order every step that they would make.
[1:46:59] Guard them,
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; guide them, protect them
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; from all hurt, harm, and danger.
[1:47:07] Father, we're your sheep.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; You're the great shepherd.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Lead them, Lord Jesus.
[1:47:15] Oh God, that they would make it back to
[1:47:17] their home safely.
[1:47:20] And Lord, may they be a testimony
[1:47:23] wherever they go. And may you bless
[1:47:26] them,
[1:47:27] Lord. We know our brother has some
[1:47:29] health issues,
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; but Lord, you're the healer tonight.
[1:47:35] And we pray Lord that you would heal our
[1:47:37] brethren,
[1:47:39] heal our sister, restrengthen them Lord.
[1:47:43] Oh God, we commit them into your hands
[1:47:46] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:47:48] Go with them now Lord in Jesus name. In
[1:47:53] Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:47:57] God bless you my brother, my sister. God
[1:48:00] bless you. Love you sister.

[1:50:12] Now declare it. He's done great things
[1:50:15] for He has done great things.
[1:50:22] Yes, he has.
[1:50:24] He has
[1:50:27] great things.
[1:50:31] Oh,
[1:50:32] he has done great things.
[1:50:38] Bless his
[1:50:44] great.
[1:50:52] You believe that tonight?
[1:50:55] For he has done great things.
[1:51:04] He
[1:51:05] has done
[1:51:07] great things,
[1:51:20] man. and he's done great things and he's
[1:51:23] doing great things. How many you enjoy
[1:51:24] the word of God to tonight? I believe
[1:51:27] brother Amen. Give the Lord a hand of
[1:51:29] praise. Amen. Thank you, brother Robert.
[1:51:33] I believe you read some the same quotes
[1:51:35] that brother Menow did. How does he
[1:51:38] know? How do you know he loves you?
[1:51:40] Because he said so. He said so. That's
[1:51:44] good enough for me. Amen. Let's sing
[1:51:47] that one more praise here. Bless the
[1:51:48] Lord, oh my soul. Oh my soul, worship
[1:51:51] his holy name.
[1:51:54] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, my soul.
