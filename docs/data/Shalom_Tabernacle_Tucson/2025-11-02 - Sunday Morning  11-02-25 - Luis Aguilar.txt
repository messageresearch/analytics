========================================

[music] Continuing [music] [music] with the U series on the Holy Spirit and this first one that we started was what is the Holy Ghost 1959 December 16th. We'll start at paragraph 23 and end after 48 and this is from the book of Acts chapter 7. Let's all bow our heads in prayer. Heavenly Father, we're grateful to be here today. You are our Holy Spirit, Father. And we thank you for the word of God says you are our spirit. Lord, we pray that you just anoint everyone, the Sunday school children, the adult class, the whole service, everything that will be done in this house of worship this day. Father, we want to hear from you and we need more of you every day. Cover us in thy precious blood, Lord. Lord, if there be anything we Lord have neglected that we know we should do, we pray your forgiveness. Pray, Lord, that you just lean and guide us ever. Help us to see your word clearly, Lord, and to act upon it, Lord. We just look forward to this day. We'll give you all the praise and the glory. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen. head. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. [music and singing] Only believe. Only [music] believe. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Only [music] believe. All things are [music and singing] possible. Only believe. You may be seated. Brother Brennham. Just like I was talking to our brother Jeff today and he said, "I would like to be at the meeting tonight, but I'll be there tomorrow night." He didn't know the meeting was going on because we didn't announce it just right here. Some of the brother Leo and them wrote to some of our friends and told him out of town. Well, because we didn't have room. Now, I said, "Brother Jeff, if you sent me down to turn on one of your oil wells and I didn't know nothing about it, I'd probably blow it up. I might turn the wrong key or start the wrong motor. I'd have to know how to do it before I did it." And that's the way with receiving the Holy Ghost. You've got to know what you are coming for and how to receive it and what it is. Now the first place the Holy Spirit has been promised we could take 10 weeks and never just skip the age of this subject what the Holy Spirit is. But the first thing I want to approach it just enough to give an outline each night. Then see the following night if there's any questions. How many in here has not received the Holy Ghost? Been baptized with the Holy Ghost. Raise your hands. You know you haven't been. Just look at the hand. Now [clears throat] I want to talk on it as a Holy Spirit being a sign for it is a sign. We realize that that all promises is given to us by Abraham was the father of the promise because God gave the promise to Abraham and to his seed after him. The promise is made to Abraham and to his seed. And this sign is to a covenant people. Now there is a vast difference [snorts] between just a Christian and a Holy Ghostfilled Christian. And now we're going to get this from the scripture and place it just exactly in the scripture. the first place there is a Christian professed to be a Christian. But if this Christian has not yet been filled with the Holy Ghost, he's only in process of being a Christian. See, he is professed to believe it. He's working to it. But God has not yet given him this spirit of the Holy Ghost. He's not yet reached that goal with God that God's recognized it because that God made a covenant with Abraham after he had called Abraham which is a type of calling the believer today. He called Abraham and Abraham moved out of his country and went into a strange land to dwell among strange people. And that was the type of when God calls a man to stop his meanness, repent of his sins, he turns then from the crowd that he was in to live in a new crowd. among new types of people. And then after God found Abraham to be faithful to the promise that God gave him that he would have the child and through this child all the earth would be blessed. Then God confirmed his faith by giving him a sign and that sign was circumcision. and circumcision is a type of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Just the very next uh verses of this chapter that we have just read, if you want to take it down and the um uh Stephen said in the 51st verse, "Ye stiff necks, uncircumcised in the heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did." So do you. The circumcision is a type of the Holy Ghost. And God gave Abraham the the circumcision sign after he had accepted God on his promise and walked out into a strange country. &gt;&gt; It was a sign. and all his children and his seed after him should have this sign in their flesh because it was a distinction. It was to separate them from all other peoples. This sign of circumcision and that's what God uses today. It's the sign of circumcision of the heart. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit that makes God's church a separated church from all other creeds, faiths, and denominations. &gt;&gt; They're in all kinds of denominations, but yet they are a separated people. You let me talk to a man two minutes, I can tell you whether he's received the Holy Ghost or not. &gt;&gt; So can you separates them? It's a mark. It's a sign. And the Holy Spirit is a sign. And it's any child that refused circumcision in the Old Testament, which was a foreshadow of the Holy Ghost, was cut off from amongst the people. He could not have fellowship with the rest of the congregation if he refused to be circumcised. Now, pattern that to today. A person that would refuse to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost can have no fellowship among those that has the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You just can't do it. You have to be a nature. Like it's my mother there used to say birds of a feather flock together. Well, it's an old proverb, but it's a true one. You don't see doves and crows fellowshipping. Their diets are different, their habits are different, their desires are different. That's the way it is with the world and with a Christian. When you have been circumcised by the Holy Spirit, which means to cut off a flesh. Circumcision could only be in the male. But if the woman was married to a man, she was part of him. She was circumcised with him. You remember in Timothy where it said, "Never notwithstanding, she shall be saved in childbearing if she continues in faith and holiness with all sobriety." Now, circumcision, you know, when the Sarah laughed in the tent behind her at the message of the angel, when he said, Abraham, not knowing who he was, a stranger, where is thy wife Sarah? How did he know that he had a wife? As Jesus said, as it was in the days of Lot, so will it be in the coming of the son of man. Remember those signs wasn't committed down to Sodom and Gomorrah in the world amongst the religionists, &gt;&gt; but it was to the elect, the called out &gt;&gt; and Abraham was called out. And the word church means called out &gt;&gt; the separated like Abraham separated himself and have been circumcised. And then when Sarah laughed at the very message of the angel, God would have killed her on the spot. But he could not bother Sarah without bothering Abraham because they were one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. She was part of him. You're no longer twain but one. So circumcision, the Holy Spirit today circumcises the heart and it's a sign, a given sign. Someone said the other day, I just repeat this not as a joke because it's a truth, but it sounds like a joke. As I've often said, this is no place for jokes. &gt;&gt; But there was a little German out on the West Coast where we were just at. He received the Holy Ghost and he went down the street and he would walk a little peace and he'd raise up his hands and speak in tongues and he would run and he would jump and he would shout and he was at work carrying all like that and his boss said to him, "Where have you been?" I like those places where you have been. He said, "You must have been down amongst that bunch of nuts." He said, "Then you think they are nuts?" He said, "Sure they are." He said, "Well, praise the Lord for the nuts." And he said, "You know what? The nuts play a big part." He said, "For instance, the automobile You take all the nuts out of it, you ain't got nothing but a bunch of yunk. So that's just about right. You are so different when the Holy Spirit comes on you until the mind of this world don't like you and they're against you and they don't want nothing to do with you at all. You're born of another world. &gt;&gt; You are just as much an alien, 10 times more alien you'd be if you'd go into forest plum regions of African jungles. &gt;&gt; You're different when the Holy Spirit comes. And it's a sign. It's a mark amongst the people. Now you say then, brother Brandham, that sign of circumcision was given to Abraham. That is true. Unto his seed. Yes. All right. Now we are going to turn to Galatians 3rd chapter 29th verse and see how that could apply to us. Galatians 3 and 29. and just see how this circumcision could apply to a gentile if we are Gentiles which by natural birth we are. Now the first I want to read the 16th verse. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promise made. Abraham and his seed. He said not and to seeds just any kind of a seed. Oh, I'm Abraham's seeds, too. No, to a seed. Abraham's seed. Not the seeds as of many, but as of one and to to they and to thy seed, which is Christ. Christ was Abraham's seed. Do you believe that? All right. Now, let's get to 28th and 29th verse. There is neither Jew nor Greek, neither is there bond or free, neither is there male or female, for we are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ, then ye are Abraham's seed and are hes according to the promise. &gt;&gt; How do we take on Abraham's seed? By being in Christ. &gt;&gt; Then we are Abraham's seed. And what was the seed of Abraham? As we might go on to Romans 4 in different places, Abraham never received the promise while he was circumcised to show that circumcision was just a type. He received the promise before he was circumcised. And it was a type of recognition of his faith that he had before he was circumcised. Now when we are in Christ, we become Abraham's seed and are hes with Christ. Therefore, no matter who we are, Jew or Gentile, and the seed of Abraham, the seed of Abraham has the faith of Abraham, who takes God at his word. Regardless of how ridiculous it seems, how unusual you act, how peculiar it makes you, you take God at his word regardless of anything. &gt;&gt; Abraham at 75 years old and Sarah at 65 took God at his word and called anything contrary to it as though it wasn't. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What do you think the doctors thought of that day? What do you think the people thought when they seen an old man 75 years old going around praising God? He's going to have a baby by his wife and her 65 years old about 25 years past menopause. But you see, it makes you act funny. The faith of Abraham and when you're circumcised of the Holy Ghost, it does the same thing to you. &gt;&gt; It makes you do things that you didn't think you would do. It makes you take God's promise and believe God. Now, it's also besides a se a promise and a sign, it's also a seal. Now, if you will go with me unto Romans, first I want you to go with me to uh Ephesians 4:30. And let's read here just a minute. Ephesians 4:30 says this. Now you've heard so many people say that different things are seals. If you go into the church, you have the seal of the church. And some people says it's keeping a certain day, a Sabbath day. That's that's a seal of God. Some of them says if we put our membership into a certain denomination, we are sealed into the kingdom of God. Now, the Bible said, "Let every man's word be a lie, and God's be the truth." Now, Ephesians 4:30 reads like this, "And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. I'm going to have to get a little bit hard on this. Now lay down. Are you legalist brethren? Just hold quite for a little bit. Did you notice how long that seal last? &gt;&gt; Not to the next revival. Until the next time something goes wrong. Until the day of your redemption. &gt;&gt; That's how long you're sealed. &gt;&gt; Praise God. until the day of your redemption. When you are redeemed up to be with God, that's how long the Holy Spirit seals you. Not from revival to revival, but from eternity to eternity. You are sealed by the Holy Spirit. That's what the Holy Spirit is. It's a seal of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he's found you found grace in his sight. Hallelujah. And he loves you and he believes you and he's putting a seal up on you. &gt;&gt; What is a seal? Anyone want a seal designates or means of finished work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has saved you, sanctified you, cleaned you up, found favor with you, and sealed you. He's finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're his product until the day of your redemption. The sealed is a finished thing. What is the Holy Ghost? It's a sign. We're going to get on that a little later on in another message. The sign Paul spoke of tongues was a sign to believers or unbelievers. Now notice, but in this the Holy Ghost is a sign. I mean, and the Holy Ghost is a seal. It's a sign that God gave to his chosen children. To reject it is to be cut from the people. &gt;&gt; And to receive it is to be finished with the world and all the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And to be a product that God has put a seal of approval on. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Thank you. Away. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; So great. There is no one else like [music and singing] you. Yes, there [singing and music] is no one else like you. You are [singing] great. You do [music] miracles so great. There is no one else like you, Lord. There is no one else like you.

There is no [singing] one else like you, Lord. There is [singing] no one else &gt;&gt; like you. Amen. Brother Chris Smith, would you open our service with a word of prayer this morning? [music] Why don't we just give our Lord and Savior a praise offering this morning? [applause] There's no one else like you, Lord. Hallelujah. Dear Lord, &gt;&gt; you do deserve all the glory we can give you. Lord, &gt;&gt; dear heavenly father, the promises, Lord, prayers, your answer, Lord, &gt;&gt; we appreciate it, Lord.

We just want to worship you this morning, Lord. Just please Lord come down here with us today Lord just worship Lord so we can worship you Lord Jesus may your presence be here we love you so much Lord please be with us we ask this in Jesus Christ's [music] name amen you can be seated if [music] you'd like this morning Amen just I want to mention mention something before we start the uh the rest of the singing and before [music] they bring the prayer requests. But um most of you were here on Wednesday night. Brother Chuck gave a a praise report where they were traveling back from um from Minnesota and they had a flat tire on their car and it happened in one of the only two places in [music] maybe a thousand mile stretch where they had one of the tire places that uh was able to change his tire. [music] Um, and you know, we just believe that the Lord bad things are going to happen to us, but the timing of them couldn't be better than than what it was with with Chuck. And so, you know, the vehicle had a flat and it was just within miles of of one of the two places that they could have had the tire changed. So, um, just wanted [music] to thank the Lord for that and I want to thank him in advance. We have another timing thing. Saw the lights flickering this morning. And I'm thankful that that's happening this Sunday instead of next Sunday. But we need for we need we need for that to be [music] fixed before our special meetings. We have our dedication meetings. We don't want to have any distractions. And we just so just remember that in prayer that [music] whoever's working on that that give the electricians wisdom. They'll be able to find out what the problem is. And we are in store [music] for a wonderful week of worship and looking forward to what he has in store for us. Somebody can say, "Every day with Jesus is sweeter than the day before." Every day with Jesus, oh, it's sweeter [singing and music] than the day before. Every day with Jesus, oh, I love him more and more. [singing and music] Jesus saves and keeps me more. And he's the one I'm [music and singing] waiting for.

We'll probably be missing these two windows. I think John um we'll probably have to use the overflow. So, get here early. your seat that you we normally tend to sit in may or may not be available. Just bear [music] with us. We'll change it up a little bit, try to squeeze a few more seats in. So, just be in prayer for all those things and the Lord will help us through everything. And he'll be ministering to us this morning. He'll be ministering through our [music] precious brother Luis Aguilar from South Phoenix Church. That's our pastor, Brother Octavio Ordonius. And [music] love them and appreciate them. We want our brother just to be right at home. His young family, brother Alex here, I think mom and a couple of other little ones are probably in the nursery. So, make sure you say hi to them and welcome them this morning. Amen. [music] God bless you. Anything I'm missing, Brother Chris, Brother Ben? Yes, sir. Great question. I didn't think to text brother Israel just a few minutes ago, and so I haven't heard back. If we hear back, we'll let brother John know as he sings for [music] us. Um, so we may or may not have communion tonight. I'm not sure. So, just be here and then we'll commune [music] one way or another. So, thank you for that, brother Chris. Anything else? Let us all stand and amazing grace, how [music] sweet the sound. It's really sweet when you just remember that he saved a wretch like me as our precious brother [music] comes this morning. Amazing [singing] grace, how sweet the Oh, think about it. He saved a wretch like [singing] me. A wretch. Oh, like me. Yes. Well, [singing] I once [music] Oh, think about it today. Yes. [singing] But now, right now, I'm [music and singing] Aren't you thankful you can see this? Now I can see [music] was his grace. It was his grace that taught [music and singing] my heart to [music] embrace my fear. [music] [singing] How precious, how [music] precious did that grace of the hour I [music] believe. And through many [music] angels [music] I have Glor. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. and God bless you this morning. Would you be so [music] kind to just take your seats just for a few moments? I'd like to to greet you and introduce myself. Um, [music] for the ones who don't know me, I I'm Brother Luis Aguilad. I come from South South Phoenix, [music] a small little church there by South Mountain Church. Our pastor there is brother Octavio Ordonius. I have my uh our little cousin here with us and my wife and my two little boys. I think they're in the in the nursery and uh I really feel comfortable and I feel at home that uh the brothers that welcome us and we feel very very nice and that's our first time being here in in Shalom Tabernacle. I've been knowing brother Israel for for some time and I was telling I asked brother Israel back in New Mexico about a couple months ago. I I remember I was I come from a small town in East Texas. I was born and raised there and I've been living in Phoenix for about six years. And uh when I was a little boy around 12, 13 years old, I my uncle used to take me to these meetings in a small town called Jasper, Texas. &gt;&gt; And uh you know, so my mom would make sure, hey, you go with your uncle, he's going to take you to these camp meetings. And so I'll go and I remember seeing a colored brother there and I would see him real fire and he had a lot of energy and and I always had as years go on I had this doubt. I said, "Is that brother Paul? Is that not brother Paul?" And so when I finally got chance to sit down and talk with him, I don't got a lot of chance to sit down and talk with him, but that one time that I did, I said, "Brother, were you that brother back in Jasper, Texas many years ago?" He says, "Yep, that was that was me." So, so I I to me it's a really tremendous blessing for me as a as a 12year-old boy to see him and to now as years go on, we've gone in this journey and to have the privilege to stand behind this pulpit. &gt;&gt; So, I I don't take it lightly. I'm so glad to to be able to be here and to have fellowship with every single one of you. Amen. We we we worship the same God you worship. We believe the same message you believe and we're in the same journey in the same battle as all of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you please stand as we go into the word? Amen. Are you ready to go into the word this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to the book of Revelation uh chapter 3 verse 20. Amen. And what a what a beautiful church that the Lord has given you. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we plan on being here uh this coming weekend. Um we possibly won't be here for the whole services, but we'll try to be here Saturday and try to bring as many young people as we can and try to be the first ones here. Amen. I'm sure you're going to have a lot of people coming over. So, we're going to try to be the first ones here. Amen. [snorts] So, try to save us some seats for us, please. [laughter] Let's go. Revelations 3 20. And it it says, "Behold, I I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and and will s with him and he with me." Amen. Let's bow our heads. We go to a word of prayer. [snorts] Dear Lord, heavenly father, Lord, we give you thanks, Lord, in this beautiful morning, Father, as we gather here as a as a group of believers, Lord. Father, and a beautiful church, Lord, a beautiful atmosphere, Lord, and tremendous worship, Father, that's that's in this place, Lord. Father, as we going to enter in your word, Father, help us to help me to speak it right, Father, for your people. Lord, help your people. They're going to hear your word, Father, may go into fertile ground, Lord. May you close my mouth if I say anything wrong, Lord. Father, may you bless this beautiful congregation and brother Paul, wherever he's at. Father, may you be with him, Father. But we ask this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Amen. Before you take your seats, won't you greet your brother, tell them good morning? Tell him to give him a nice smile. Amen. Amen. You may then you may take your seats. Amen. Amen. So once again, God bless you. Okay. Amen. you may take your seats. And this this morning I I hope not to take too much time, but this is something that we spoke to the to our church last week. And um but I want to go a little bit on in a different direction. And if [clears throat] I can place a little bit of a a title so we can understand in the direction that we're going, I like to entitle it a spiritual eclipse. Now here in the scripture that we find here as we all know it's we find it we find that it's a church of Laaya. Now as we know there's seven church ages and here in this last church age we find Jesus outside of his church knocking trying to get back into his church. Uh and he says, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock." And brother Brandham says as as he read the as he read the scripture, Brother Brandham says it, "I don't find it in the scripture that the church led him back in." &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brham says in the message, the Messiah 1961, he says, he says he's trying to get back in his own church where they pressed him out. And he says, "Isn't that pitiful that the most pathetic thing I can think of of him in his own church, giving his life for that church and being being doing the way he did and sent the light to the church and he and he said he did and they rejected it and they pushed him on the outside, accepted some kind of creed or something the church had made up. And there he is standing at the outside trying to get in. Now, as we see the the seven church ages, how the beginning of the word was Ephesians, where Ephesians came out, they had the original word. And as time begin to go, they got a little bit more colder. They got more formal. They started accepting other things besides the word. And if you notice that in in in the Ephesian church age that he says, you have tried them which say that they're apostles and you're not, and you found them liars. Because the people they receive the word from the apostle Paul. They knew the scriptures. So when somebody will come and preach something that was anti-word &gt;&gt; or to add something or take away, they would quickly say that's not the word. &gt;&gt; That's not what the apostle said. &gt;&gt; So you notice and as the next church age went on, they they let something slide in. Then the next church age, well, we can start doing this. It doesn't matter. It's fine. and then the next church age, the next church age, and the next church age until finally we find him in the seventh church age kicked out of his own church &gt;&gt; and he's trying to get back in. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham says we could take this to a church. We can we can talk it about it as an individual, as a marriage, as a family. Jesus trying to get back in. But whenever he arrives, we don't like what it does to us because he applies the word and and he he he acts us sometimes make us act a little funny. Brother Ram says it makes you say amen. It makes you raise your hand. It sometimes, brother Bram says the sisters, they don't want to get in the spirit because it makes the makes their makeup run off their their faces. You see? And so they're now they're cold and they're formal. Brother Ram says he sent the light to the church &gt;&gt; and they rejected it. Amen. Now, Brother Brandham says in the message, the invisible union of the of the bride of Christ, he says the seven seals which all the mysteries of the seven church ages was sealed in the seven seals. The reformers didn't have time to do it in their days. They didn't live long enough. But this blessed revelation of the seven seals is open to us in this last day from a prophecy that went forth to Arizona. Now, Brother Brandham just finished saying that the seven seals is a revelation of the seven church ages. So, when brother Brandham preached the seven church ages, believe it was 1960, he had a an understanding of the seven church ages. But when 1963 came, the revelation came of the seven seals. Now, Brother Brandham says, "NOW I understand it." &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now, now I want to I really want to run, but I want to take time with this. So, let's go to Revelations chapter 6. Amen. So, Revelations chapter 6 verse 1. And it says like this, "And I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals." Now, who is that lamb? It's Jesus. Jesus is the lamb. He opened the seals and I heard as it was a noise of thunder. Brother Ram says, "What is the voice of thunder?" Brother said, "It is the voice of God." And one of the four beasts saying, "Come and see." Now John as John the he's a scribe and he's writing this in aisle of Patmas and he's writing this. He only sees a symbol. He doesn't see the revelation of this. He just sees a symbol. He just sees a beast. He sees a horse. He sees a dragon. He doesn't know what it means. But it wasn't revealed. As years and hundreds of years ministers would read this scripture and not know what it really meant. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So John, he's just writing it. He doesn't have the revelation of it. Now he says in second verse and and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer. Now brother Bam says I said I thought that was the Holy Spirit was not once the seals were revealed to me that rider that white horse is the antichrist. coming out in the first church age, something innocent. Because the devil, he won't he won't approach you with a a skeleton skull and a skeleton horse and a fire. No, he's going to come up to you like I'm white. I'm innocent. I'm an innocent little horse. What can I possibly do to you? And that's what it little doctrine, little just a little teaching. It doesn't hurt. Real innocent. But he was a writer and he had a he had a bow but he had no no arrows. So brother R said he was a bluff and as time went on he received a crown that he was innocent. Sometimes we allow that in our our own lives. We allow something happen in our marriage, in our home, in our church. We there's something innocent. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't matter. But brother Brandham says that that white horse rider is the antichrist spirit because those spirits look so alike, &gt;&gt; so similar, &gt;&gt; but it would deceive the very elected if it was possible. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Ram says in the fourth seal says, "Have you noticed that the writer is a he and he had in his hand?" So, he's a man, false prophet. Now, here's here's where here's going to he's going to be a something heavy right here. I want you to really chew this. But his bride, &gt;&gt; not not he's not talking about Jesus. He's talking about the rider that's riding that horse. Are you following me? The rider that's following that horse, he has a bride &gt;&gt; and it's called the church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She [snorts] Jezebel. Ahab and Jezebel. So that rider was riding an innocent white horse, Antichrist spirit. And he has a bride. It's not the bride of Jesus Christ. It's that rebellious loudest saying church age that rejected the word that Jezebel. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says in the fifth seal, he says, excuse me, the first seal, this guy isn't called nothing. He doesn't have a name. He's just a rider on a white horse that has a has a bow and has a crown. That's all it is. But he's on a white horse. He doesn't have a name and he's sitting on a white horse. Now, Brother Ram says he was given a crown. He crowned a man a superman. Crowned him. The the Bible didn't call him a pope. The bi the Bible called him a false prophet. He says, "Of course, he must have been a must have been a false prophet by his antichrist spirit." Now this white horse had had an anointment and his anointment was false teaching. False teaching that was that's what he brought forth was false teaching. Brother Ram says by his antichrist spirit that taught antichrist against the original word because if he taught against the original word it was antichrist. It was and the word is God. See Christ. All right. Now after that we find him then crowned and when he got crowned now he sees very innocent and he's very helpless. Now brother Bham says the beast the living creature that said come and see that was sent to combat that white horse rider that white horse rider what was he doing? False teaching. It's going a little bit off the word here little bit off the word there. Something very innocent. It doesn't hurt to just do this. Take away that. So, but then God sends the anointment of the lion. &gt;&gt; Is that right? The lion. God sent the lion which represents the word to combat that antichrist spirit. Now, let's go to verse three. It's chapter 6 verse three. And he says, "A second seal." And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, "Come and see." And there went out another horse that was red, and power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another, and there was given unto him a great sword. Brother Ram said, "It is the same rider, just a different horse, changing ministry. He was given a sword. He took away peace to kill one another. Now, Brother Brandham says what this was, it was a real dark tribulation period where now that white horse was very innocent. We're going to teach a little bit here. But now he changes his ministry. The same writer, just a different ministry. Now he has a sword and he says, "If you don't agree with me, I'm going to kill you if you don't agree with me." Amen. &gt;&gt; He was a bloody red horse and he took away peace to kill one another. Brother Ram says in the second seal says the Roman Catholic Church put 68 million Protestants to death for people not bowing down to that Catholic dogma dogma. You see he started very innocent, very subtle. says there were millions fed to lions and slaughtered in every way because they wouldn't bow down to that Catholic dogma. &gt;&gt; I really recommend you go to those seven church ages. Go to those seven seals. This is history. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is taking out a history and putting it to the people's eyes. Look what happened there. And as we get in deeper into this, you're going to see how how the these denominations how they failed. Now, that's the red horse, same rider. And that he he he puts down his bow, picks up a sword, and kills anybody who disagree with him. Now, the living creature to combat this red horse anointment. Now, again, these are not literal horses. These are not little literal uh uh lion. It's spiritual. Amen. This is spiritual. John is just he sees this but he doesn't see the full understanding of it. Now to combat this red horse. Brother Ram says it was the ox that came to combat that red horse. Now an ox, he's not a a fighting animal. He's very very calm. He's a brother says we find he sent the ox during the time of the tribulation period he's a sacrificial animal and in this tribul tribulation tribulation period that's all the people could do was just work be slaves and offer themselves as sacrifice because if you spoke up at all they'll kill you right there. So that was the anointment of the ox. All you could do is just surrender yourself, work as a slave, and offer yourself as a sacrifice and to seal your testimony. As time goes on, the church ages go on. Now, we we see a third horse. Let's go to chap uh chapter 6 verse 5. And it says like this. And when it opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, "Come and see. And I beheld, and lo, a black horse, and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, "A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny, and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine." Now, same rider, just a different color horse. Now, this black horse, Brother Ram, said, represented the dark ages. Oh, dark. He had a pair of balances in his hand, saying, "A measure of wheat for a penny, three measure of barley for a penny, but see thee thou not hurt, the oil and the wine." Now this real innocent white horse giving a little teaching, trying to take a little bit one of the word. Now he changes. He says, "You don't agree with me? I'll kill you if you don't agree with me." Now he got more power. He turns into a black horse. And now he says, "You want prayer? Do you have $2? I give me $2 and I'll pray for you." &gt;&gt; And now he started charging for stuff. That's tremendous. &gt;&gt; You see how this Antichrist spirit is? He was charging for prayer. You wanted prayer, you call the priest over, but you have to give them a couple coins. Brother Brandham says that's why Russia kicked out the Catholic Church and it turned into a communist country. And he said, Brother says, "Communism is a tool in the hand of God &gt;&gt; because Russia, communism is going to avenge the blood of the saints." There's a quote that Brother Bram says that Russia has a bomb ready to throw it to the Catholic Church because the Catholic Church killed many Christian believers. Brother Ram says Mexico. Brother Ram says in the first seal he says Mexico where the poor Mexican people have a couple pesos and they don't make a lot of money but if they need something from the from the priest or whatever his name is need something you got to give them a couple dollars that you make which are hard money. You notice how far the church has gone from what the apostle Paul has brought &gt;&gt; charging for prayer and then they come with this great idea. HOW CAN WE MAKE more money? So now the pope innocent white horse then he gets a crown. The Bible doesn't call him a pope. He calls him a false prophet. And he kills anybody who disagree with him. And then he says, you know what? I got power over heaven, over hell. I and I am the instead of the son of God. &gt;&gt; That's tremendous. And then he has a triple crown. And then he says, I got power over heaven and hell. And he says, guess what? I got so much power that I can take your loved one who did not live a Christian life. I can take him out of hell, put him in a place called purgatory, and then when he's cleansed in purgatory, he goes to heaven, but just give me some money or some charge. I'll give you a certificate declaring that your loved one that is in hell, he's in purgatory and he's going to go to heaven. Bro, this is history. You don't have to go to the message to look at this. This is history. Brother Brandham has taken out a history and applying it to the word charging for prayer. THERE'S NO SUCH thing as a purgatory. YOU GOT TO ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says when you die, YOUR TIME IS UP THERE. YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO YOUR BODY. You got your opportunity is right now. &gt;&gt; There's many people in the grave. There are many bodies in THE GRAVE WHO LOST THEIR OPPORTUNITY, WHO HAD A LOT OF POTENTIAL, but they're sitting in a grave. Father Ram says that young rich ruler, he wanted him as an evangelist. But where is he at? He's found in hell tormented. &gt;&gt; Brother says, "When you die," he says when you die, your body, your soul leaves your body. You can't go inside your body because your time is up. You can't go to heaven because you don't have the token which is the Holy Spirit. So there's only one place you can go and that's torment. &gt;&gt; There's no such thing as a purgatory. There's no such thing as certificates. There's no much thing give me money and you're saved. If you give that amount, you're saved. You give this amount you're not saved. That does not exist. You love the Lord. So then to combat that spirit, he sends the living creature of the man which was the reformer's age. Martin Luther, John Wesley, God said, he said he sent out the wisdom of a man, a man like a head on a beast, which was the power that went out for the reformers. It's tremendous that uh Friday was the 31st of October. That is the day that Martin Luther wrote 95 thesis and nailed it on the Catholic door of the church. The putting out everything that he disagreed with the pope and the Catholic church. &gt;&gt; That is what we need today. more men and women of God that stands for the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They could have killed him. &gt;&gt; He But see, Martin Luther was intelligent. He was wise because the pope the the the Bible was written in Latin. The people were humble. They didn't know how to read. So the pope would go up there and the priest would go up there and he says, "You got to do this and this cuz the Bible says it." The people were humble. They were farmers. They didn't understand. They didn't know how to read. So they just agreed with it. &gt;&gt; But Martin Luther was a wise man. He he he began to read this. He says, "Wait a minute. It doesn't say that here. &gt;&gt; He didn't say there's a purgatory. It doesn't say if you're saved because of the pope or because the word of the church." HE SAYS YOU'RE SAVED BY GRACE. &gt;&gt; He begin to make these notes. He says, "That doesn't make sense." He says, "The just shall live by faith." that you're justified, you're forgiven. And he says, these are two quotes that that I like from Martin Luther. There's many quotes. He says, "A simple layman," which means a simple member of the church, a simple layman armed with the scripture is greater than the mightiest pope without it. [laughter] &gt;&gt; This is tremendous, brothers. I I recommend you go look what Martin Luther said. &gt;&gt; Look what Martin Luther He what Martin Luther did. He stood up. He says, "Wait a minute. The Bible does not SAY THAT. TOOK PEOPLE OUT. THEN WHAT HAPPENED? He died. The church grew and they became a denomination and they went right back to the Catholic Church." Here's another quote from Martin Luther. The law says do this and it's never done. Grace says believe this and everything's already done. &gt;&gt; So some of the points that he had Martin Luther had was saved by grace alone through faith alone according to the scripture alone to the glory of God alone alone. So Martin Luther, he went in combat that that black horse rider spirit that was charging for money. He says, "There's no such a thing. You're saved through through grace. You're saved by grace through faith. &gt;&gt; We're all saved. You just got to believe it." &gt;&gt; You can't see it. You can't touch it, but you got to believe it. I'm not going to give you a certificate that your sins have been washed away. You got to believe that, brother and sister. &gt;&gt; It's through faith. Amen. Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as time went on, the last we get here to the last church age, you can see how how of a mess and chaos the church is going into. Now, let's go to the fourth seal. Chapter 6, verse 7. And it says, "And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, come and see. And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was death, and hell followed with him, and the power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword, and with hunger, and with the death, and with the beasts of the earth. Now, we see now that these three colors, white, then we have red, and we have black. But they're all mixed. They're all mixed together to turn into one horse. A pale yellow sickly horse. But now he has a name. He didn't start off with a name. He was innocent. But now in this last fourth seal, now he tells us his name. &gt;&gt; And his name is death. You notice if you lay off the word just a little bit and you follow something very innocent eventually it will take you away from the word completely &gt;&gt; because leaving the word of God leaving the presence of God is death. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says he sent the fourth beast to combat this last horse rider. He was death and hell followed him. He had a sword to kill and he killed with hunger. The red horse he killed and he took away peace. This one he's he's not killing also with the sword but he's killing people with hunger. today. There's so much food today, brothers. There's so plenty of food, mass producing food everywhere. There's plants and there's there's these warehouses. There's so many food, but we're not talking about literal food. We're talking about spiritual food. The people are hungry for the REAL WORD OF GOD. That's why the scripture says, "Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled. &gt;&gt; Just like in the time of Elijah, there was a famine in the land. It was dry. There was there was no food." &gt;&gt; He commanded the heavens to shut, not to open, not to have any rain. But finally, when Elijah, he took those false prophets to Mount Carmel and he challenged them. And this is the God who answers by fire. There it was all those prophets. And he says, "You get GET THE CALF. I'LL GRAB THE CALF and you chop it up. Do what you want to do. Just hurry up." And you notice that Elijah, he had a sense of humor because it started from the morning until 12:00. He was sitting down and he said, "Are you done yet or do you if you read the scripture? Go to the scripture." &gt;&gt; He makes fun of them. &gt;&gt; Elijah had a sense of humor. So, he wasn't always just, "Brothers, God bless." He had a sense of humor. &gt;&gt; He says, "Is he in vacation? If he is, we got some business to do. You better go call him. &gt;&gt; If he's sleeping, we better go wake HIM UP BECAUSE WE GOT A SHOWDOWN." YOU NOTICE BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD ALWAYS SAY, he says, "Oh, those cemeteries." Oh, I'm sorry. Those seminaries. Brother Brandham had a sense of humor. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD had a sense of humor. Now, that pale horse, those three horses mix into one. Anything that's anti that goes against the real has to be death. But again, the devil's never going to approach you with a skeleton face and a skeleton horse and, "Oh, I'm the devil." No, it's innocent. Innocent. It doesn't hurt to do this. Doesn't hurt to do that. Brother Ram says, "Naturally, they killed 68 million Protestants and put them to death in the Roman church." Brother Ram says in the fourth seal, he says, "Now God only knows how many he caused to spiritually die by this by his anti-Bible word teaching." This is the one he put 68 billion to the sword and killed them. And probably literally billions not millions billions died spiritually on his false teaching. No wonder he took that name of death. So this brothers in this last day people are not dying literally. People are dying spiritually. This is a spiritual death by anti-word teaching by letting the bar down just a little bit. Just one thing I was telling the church last Sunday, brothers, by hearing this from brother Brandham, brothers, we should be praying all night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are we doing with our young people, with our children, with the church? &gt;&gt; Amen. People are spiritually dying and we're going to give accounts for that. &gt;&gt; We're going to give accounts as me as a husband. I'm going to GIVE ACCOUNTS FOR MY WIFE AND CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; People spiritually dying now. His name is called death &gt;&gt; and he's writing and the people who are following him are heading that way. But that living creature to combat that pale sickly horse by the name of death is an eagle. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THE LION. It's not the ox. It's not the man. It's an eagle. &gt;&gt; And the eagle IS A PROPHET. &gt;&gt; TO BRING FORTH the revelation &gt;&gt; of the word. &gt;&gt; He's revealed now. He wasn't revealed in Luther's time or in Wesley's time. It wasn't re revealed then, but he's revealed now. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY IT WAS brother Brian in 1963 when those seals were open, he says that white horse is not the Holy Spirit. It's the antichrist. &gt;&gt; It couldn't be revealed then, but it's revealed now. &gt;&gt; Now, it wasn't revealed in the lion or the ox of the man, but it's revealed under the eagle age of the prophet. Now, brother Ram says, "Was there mis excuse me, why did there excuse me, in the message, the feast of the trumpets, 1964, was there mysteries that was still hid?" Revelation 10, we find at the end of the seventh angel's message that these mysteries that had been hid would be revealed. &gt;&gt; Notice the reason is because there had been no prophets during this age. &gt;&gt; There had been no prophets. only Apostle Paul was a prophet but everybody else they weren't. The last one brother says the last one is to be to be uh prophesied in the scriptures that the last seventh angel messenger would be a prophet to reveal these things. The Bible said that God does nothing until he reveals his secrets to his servant the prophets. &gt;&gt; That's why it's revealed in our day. We have the revelation of the word. That's right. &gt;&gt; It was great what Martin Luther said. It was great what John what John Wesley SAID. LIVE A SANCTIFIED LIFE. BUT NOW WE GOT SOMETHING GREATER. &gt;&gt; WE GOT THE HOLY Spirit &gt;&gt; and access for you. &gt;&gt; All you have to DO IS ACCEPT THE HOLY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; Back then you just believe. You're justified now. Then John Wesley came. But now you have to live a clean life. You got to put some 30 things away. You have without holiness, no one will see God. &gt;&gt; And then here came the seventh angel messenger. And he says, he says, "Come up higher. Now it's time for you to receive the word to be filled with the word and filled with the Holy Spirit because that's the only way you can overcome this spiritual death that's in the world." &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Now this this this one quote here is really impacted me. So I want you to really chew on this quote on the message of the fifth seal line 195. And uh [clears throat] I want you to notice this. I want you to notice the numbers. Brother Ram says and I'm going to see if the brothers will be so kind in the back kind of put that that number there once we're done here because I I kind of learn more by looking than I am by hearing. So it says, "Brethren, in the in the days of the lion that came, the original word, because a white horse had a false teaching, the lion brought the word." Notice when the in the days that the lion came, the original word, about 100th of them listened to the lion. In the days of the ox came just a tiny little group that listened to the ox message. And the day the days of the man came, he worked among men. You see, he was shrewd. He got a little group out. And then what did he do? Satan seen that. So he just sends them right back and marries them into it. &gt;&gt; What that means is that came Martin Luther took the take the church out. Then Martin Luther dies, the church denominates and marries right back to the Catholic Church. Here comes John Wesley leaves the Catholic Church. John Wesley dies. They denominate and marry back into the Catholic Church. But brother Ram says, "Not this message. &gt;&gt; Not the message. This message would not be denominated." Now 199. And remember, when the eagle finally comes, it will be 100th of 1% &gt;&gt; that'll listen. It's an eagle age. Now, I'm not sure if it's possible, sisters or brothers. Okay, look, 100th is 1%. Now, for you young people, when you What does 1% mean? You have your phone, right? Your phone, you that's about the way we understand it, right? You're charging your phone. When it's fully charged, what is it? &gt;&gt; 100%. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And when it loses charge, it goes to 1%. &gt;&gt; So, it's not 100, it's only 1%. Now, brother Ram says in the days of the lion, he didn't say it was 100%. He said it was 1%. &gt;&gt; Only 1%. When the lion came. When the OX CAME, A SMALLER group than 1% came out. Now, when the man came, it was a smaller percent than 1%. But when it finally got to the eagle age, it's not 1%. It's 0.01% &gt;&gt; that will listen to the prophet William Mary and Brandham &gt;&gt; only 0.01% brothers this is 1963 he's talking here he says listen that will listen to the message I wonder how many people are actually living that message and that 0.01% 01%. &gt;&gt; That's what brother Ram says in the rapture. He says it won't be a lot of people. It'll be very few brothers. WE GOT TO FIGHT FOR THIS. WE GOT TO FIGHT FOR EVERY inch that we to get THIS GROUND. &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T be lazy around. We got TO PRAY. WE GOT TO RECEIVE THE HOLY Spirit &gt;&gt; for it to be not to no reserves in us. But the day that we get there, WE CAN SAY, "LORD, I DONE EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY could to live this message." Say, "Lord, rebuke me. Chasten me. There's something you see that's wrong IN ME. SEARCH MY HEART, OH GOD. SEARCH ME [screaming] NOW. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE SEARCHED THEN. I WANT TO BE SEARCHED RIGHT NOW." &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY. BROTHER BRAM SAYS THE THE BRIDE THE BRIDE IS BEING formed right now. &gt;&gt; She's being rebuked right now. &gt;&gt; Not over there. &gt;&gt; We're receiving it right now. &gt;&gt; We're being tested right now. There's people there people who are refusing the test. They're refusing it. They want to postpone the test. &gt;&gt; IF YOU POST POSTPONE THAT TEST, IT'LL BE in the tribulation period. Then you'll be tested. But right now, the bride, she's being tested. She's being tried. Right now, &gt;&gt; 100th is 1%. &gt;&gt; The time of the eagle, it was 0.01%. That will listen to the message. I wonder how many people are actually living the message. You love the Lord. Now, in Matthew 24, we're not going to read the scripture. It mentions signs in heavens concerning the last days before Jesus comes. Here we have stars. We have the sun and the moon. And the sun represents the son of God, Jesus. Is that right? &gt;&gt; The moon represents the bride. Amen. Now, the moon shines in the absence of the sun. Right now, there's daylight. We have the sun. There's not a moon out there. So, the sun is shining right now. But when the sun goes away or hides, now the moon comes. But the moon does not have a light of her own. She reflects the light of the sun. &gt;&gt; Now, brother says the sun is Jesus, the word, the light, and we reflect the light of the world in this dark age. Let's go real quickly to Isaiah chapter 60 verse1. Isaiah 60 verse1 verse2. Amen. Isaiah 61 verse two. And it says, "Arise, shine, for the light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall rise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. Brother Ram says, he says he it's a contrast of scriptures because the first one he says, "Arise and shine, for the light is come." And the second verse it says, "For behold, there should be darkness on the earth and gross darkness upon the people." One thing is darkness, the other thing is gross darkness on the people. And brother Ram says in the message shalom, it says darkness. This loudest say a church age. Now when Jesus which is the word in the loudest of church age was on the outside of the church knocking at the door trying to get in darkness gross darkness upon the people. If you go to the Philadelphia church age brother scripture says that there that Jesus says he placed an open door. He says that open door is not in the Philadelphia church age. It's not in the loud church age. It it's right in the middle. So as the church is is is journering on is traveling on from Ephesus Mir Titara Pergamus is going on and it gets to Philadelphia God places an open door before going into Laosa &gt;&gt; because LAOSA GOES INTO CHAOS GOES INTO DARKNESS &gt;&gt; but he places an open door. It's like going down the highway. You're going down uh what is this highway? I I 10. YOU'RE GOING TO I 10 and and uh you're going to to Phoenix. Now if you TAKE GOING TO PHOENIX that's an example LOUDA BUT GOD SAYS I PLACE AN EXIT &gt;&gt; DON'T GO STRAIGHT &gt;&gt; TAKE THE EXIT &gt;&gt; DON'T GO STRAIGHT AND GO INTO CHAOS BROTHER ABRAHAM SAYS THAT OPEN DOOR IS THE HOLY GHOST IS JESUS CHRIST IS THE MESSAGE &gt;&gt; IT'S THE MESSAGE of the hour &gt;&gt; THAT YOU NOTICE WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM TOOK A PICTURE IN DALLAS TEXAS. There he is in Dallas, Texas, standing like this and there's a pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Where was he at? Standing before the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the GREAT SHEPHERD. &gt;&gt; STANDING IN THE THE DOOR OF THE SHEEPFOLD. No one can come in and NO ONE CAN COME OUT UNLESS THE PASTOR KNOWS WHO IT IS. &gt;&gt; Jesus is our great shepherd. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO COME IN THAT SHEEPFOLD JUSTIFIED, SANCTIFIED, and be baptized with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; So, as you see that open door, HE SAYS, "DON'T GO CUZ IT'S CHAOS. NAKED, WRETCHED, MISERABLE, BLIND, AND DON'T EVEN KNOW IT. BUT I'LL place an open door. It's an exit. Take the exit." The open door. &gt;&gt; And we are in that open door. It's this message right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the light is the the now the message shalom. He says now it's light time coming for the believers but it's gross darkness for the people. Light has come for the believers but gross darkness for the people. What is the light? The word. &gt;&gt; That's the light. &gt;&gt; The word. When you go into your house, you can't see it's dark. What do you do? YOU TURN ON THE LIGHT SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING. &gt;&gt; Is that right? you driving down the road. What do you do? It's dark aside, you turn on the light. So you can see John 3:16. I'm gonna read this scripture real quick. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but hath everlasting life. For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, &gt;&gt; but that the world through him might be saved. Now is a time of grace and mercy. It's not time of judgment, brother and sister. It's time of grace. When that when that woman that was caught in the act of adultery, the Pharisees dragged her out and it got Jesus and trying to tempt him says the law says to stone her, that's what the law says that when Moses says, "But what do you say?" Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram, scripture says that he looked at her. He looked at her but not with eyes of flame of fire. Because if you go to the book of Revelation in the sevenfold personage of the Lord, one of those items is a flames of fire, judgment. &gt;&gt; But when he was here on earth, it was grace. &gt;&gt; It was mercy. &gt;&gt; So whatever you do, brother and sister, God, Jesus, and the word is not here to condemn you. THE GOSPEL IS NOT to condemn you. The gospel not to put you IN PRISON BECAUSE YOU ALREADY ARE IN PRISON. &gt;&gt; BUT THE GOSPEL IS TO TAKE YOU OUT OF PRISON. TO TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE FREE, THAT YOU CAN FLY, THAT YOU'RE OKAY. THAT'S NOT THE GOSPEL TO TELL you're wrong. You're wrong. You're wrong. The gospel is to set you free. &gt;&gt; There he was. Jesus looked at her with the eyes of mercy, of grace, and forgave her. But there's going to come a time in the day of judgment where it won't be eyes of grace, &gt;&gt; but it'll be eyes of flaming fire &gt;&gt; of judgment. 18 He says, "He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God." 19. And this is the condemnation. This is what happens when a person gets a gives into prison and they're about to give him his for someone who commits a crime. The judge comes and says, "This is what you're here for. This is the condemnation. The light has come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil." What is the light? The word. &gt;&gt; That's right. When we receive the word, when Jesus is knocking on the outside, we don't want him to let him to come in because when he comes in, the light turns on &gt;&gt; and then we're we he sees everything that we're hiding. The first thing he does, he goes into your living room &gt;&gt; and he sees maybe things are out of order. You kind of get ashamed, but it's okay. It's a living room. He'll clean it up and he you can have fellowship. Then he comes into the to the kitchen and he sees everything nasty that we eat, everything that we see, all the perversions that we eat. We let him that far. But when it comes down to the bedroom, where there's intimacy, whether your deepest, darkest secrets are that your mom and dad doesn't know, that your wife doesn't know, that your husband doesn't know, that your pastor doesn't know. No, Jesus, you can't come in here. &gt;&gt; WE REJECT THE LIGHT. WE WE LOVE DARKNESS rather than light because our deeds are evil. &gt;&gt; We don't want Jesus to see them. Brother, I would rather have Jesus see it now than rather see it over there. &gt;&gt; That's why I repeatedly say, say, brother and sister, we should be praying and say, Lord, if you see anything wrong in me, DO PLEASE DO IT NOW. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO CONFESS MY SINS NOW. I WANT TO GET RIGHT WITH you right now. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is what the light does. &gt;&gt; It turns on the light, &gt;&gt; but it's not to expose you to make you all that look to expose you as a sinner, as a as a hypocrite, &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S TO EXPOSE THAT YOU REALLY ARE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT IT'S REALLY EXPOSING. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE DEVIL IS TELLING YOU, DON'T LET HIM come in. Because if you let him in, he's going TO CONDEMN YOU. HE'S GOING TO EMBARRASS YOU. HE'S GOING TO EMBARRASS YOU. BUT THAT'S NOT IT. IS TO EXPOSE the devil that you really are a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; That's why we're fighting so MUCH TO LET JESUS in &gt;&gt; because we think HE'S GOING TO EXPOSE US AS SINNERS, but he's not. HE'S GOING TO EXPOSE you that you really are a son and daughter of God. Just like in the beginning when there was gross darkness upon the earth and then God said, "Let there be light. And there was light. And when he turned the light on, he saw the earth was void and empty. [clears throat] And he began to form the earth. He began to separate the waters. He began to separate this. And that's what he does with our life. Let there be light. The word comes and places our life in order. Now, as I'm getting ready to close, when brother Brandham, he preached to seven church ages in 1960, he drew on a black board seven moons that he was revealed to him by the Lord. Remember the sun, son of God, the moon is the bride. Is that right? Seven moons, seven church ages. And I don't have an image here, but he says uh got the first moon that had more light and it got more darker and darker and darker until he got to Laosa. It was just a little bit of light left. now. And after he was done preaching that series, Brother Ram says in the message uh scriptural signs of the time of 1964, Brother Brandham says that in the back of the church of the tabernacle, the seven moons appeared that he drew in the blackboard that the angel Lord drew those same exact moons to vindicate what the prophet did. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says in that same message, scriptural signs of the time, he says people were fainting when they saw the seven moons in the back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So one is the blackboard, two is the the the seven moons in the back, and the third before 1963 ended, December 30th, 1963, Jerusalem goes into an eclipse. Why? Because in January 4th of 1964, the Pope Paul V 6 goes to Jerusalem. You notice brother Ram says he took the name of Paul &gt;&gt; like the first messenger but he takes the number of six the man and it to goes into total darkness before the pope goes into Jerusalem. Brothers, brothers, I wasn't even born yet. You imagine how much little time we have now. &gt;&gt; Brothers, we we have to get ready. &gt;&gt; Now, what did it mean for the pope to go to Jerusalem? The message shalom. He says, "It isn't Isn't it strange that just before the pope took his journey to Jerusalem that the moon and the heavens made a total blackout just a few days before he took his journey? He's coming here also." You know, now that he's that has never been known. See, but what does it show that this that he's doing this to win fellowship as he met on that day after he come into Jerusalem? He met with the Greek Orthodox Orthodox hierarchy. And what does that reflect? Fellowship is what they're wanting. Protestants and Catholicism joining together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which they are doing, which they are doing right now and will completely do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God reflected this to us in the moon. A total blackout. So that's three signs vindicated before 1963 ended. the blackboard that brother Brandham wrote the seven moons in the back and the total eclipse before the popes goes to Jerusalem and what was he doing the pope Catholicism joining with the Protestants having fellowship that's what the SCRIPTURE SAYS COME OUT OF HER DO NOT PARTICIPATE FROM OUR SINS GET AWAY FROM that &gt;&gt; Martin LUTHER HE GAVE HIS LIFE TO LEAVE THAT THING AND THEY'RE GOING RIGHT BACK AT IT JOHN ASHLEY GAVE HIS LIFE TO GET THE PEOPLE out of THERE AND THEY GO RIGHT BACK TO IT. PROTESTANTISM, Catholicism joining together in fellowship. It's a spiritual eclipse, gross darkness upon the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; People don't want to hear the word anymore. Probably people want to go to church anymore. We left we left the we left Phoenix early in the morning and and uh it might sound kind of funny but I'm not talking about a church you know you know even though I am right the Catholic church right but uh we left and 7 7 o'clock in the morning 7:15 in the morning and we drive by and the whole parking lot of the Catholic church is filled up. I told my wife, we have service at 9:30 &gt;&gt; in Phoenix. Doors open 9:30 and service begins at 10:00 and we got people coming in when the preaching starting. &gt;&gt; Oh boy, that's that's crazy that the Catholic Church is 7:30 in the morning and it's packed AND US TO HAVE THE MESSAGE OF the eagle. &gt;&gt; And brother BRAM SAYS YOU GOT TO AT LEAST COME 30 minutes before the service even starts. and the Catholic CHURCH HAS ALREADY FILLED UP THE PARKING LOT. I TOLD MY WIFE, "That's tremendous." I said, "The church, we got people coming out. I'm about to go up there and preach and there's people still coming in. I'm about to preach." Tell my wife that's why receive the message of the eagle. Gross darkness upon the people just like it was in the time of Egypt. All the people of Israel, they're in Egypt. But God sends a mighty prophet by the name of Moses, a stutterer WHO DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TALK. BUT GOD SENT HIM. GOD VINDICATED HIM. God confirmed him. Sent him out there. And he gave he told the Pharaoh to let his people go. &gt;&gt; Pharaoh rejected. It's scriptural that God hardened his heart for a purpose. So the people CAN SEE THAT GOD WAS WITH MOSES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The same thing with the prophet. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, SO GOD CAN GOD CAN SHOW US THAT he has a prophet in our day. &gt;&gt; But he was there plagues and plagues, gross darkness hitting the people of Egypt, striking the land of Egypt until finally the last plague. What was that last plague? Death. Brother Ram said it was so dark. And the scripture said it was so dark you can feel it. The people of Egypt can feel the darkness that was in Egypt. But in Goan, &gt;&gt; there was light in Goan. &gt;&gt; Not one single plague hit Goan. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the city. It wasn't because where they were located necessarily, BUT BECAUSE THEY OBEYED WHAT MOSES SAID. YEAH. &gt;&gt; MOSES SAYS, "TAKE [screaming] A LAMB, SLAUGHTER IT, cook it, and put the blood of the lamb on the doorpost &gt;&gt; because in that night, the angel of death will pass by." &gt;&gt; By obeying the word, &gt;&gt; THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS OBEY THE WORD THAT THE PROPHET SAID IN OUR LAST DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And plagues after plagues was hitting and striking Egypt. But in GAN THERE WAS LIGHT IN OCEAN. &gt;&gt; NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON WAS STRUCKEN BY it because they OBEYED THE PROPHET OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And this last plague, it's not literal death, not natural death, it's spiritual death. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram says in the message Christ those who got the blood on the doorpost out here the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. Brother Ram says those who are born again &gt;&gt; they know where they're standing &gt;&gt; if they're really born again. &gt;&gt; You got to know where you're standing brother and sister on the word. &gt;&gt; Not on the church, not in the doctrine. Not on anybody else. Not even on brother Brandham. Brother Brandham says in the message shalom, we said, "What are you going to turn to?" Turn to brother Brandham. Brother Brandham says, "You'll be foolish if you do that." &gt;&gt; We ought to look to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; They'll, he says, they'll be in they'll not be entangled with every yoke and every doctrine and tossed here and there and every cult because they know where they're standing in Christ through the blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's spiritual darkness, but in this last day, that's why God or Moses said, "The Lord thy God will raise up a prophet out of the midst of thee of thy brethren." What's all of this with all this death and gross darkness? What can we do? What can we do? What can we possibly do? If there's gross darkness, where can we go? Brother Ram says in the message shalom, I'm I'm I'm finishing up now. The musicians can come forth. Brother Ram says in line 40, he says, "My new year's message is to the church elected in Jesus Christ for 1964." Not just not just to the church groups, but to the elect. I'm going to read that again. My new year's message is to the church elected in Jesus Christ. Remember that first horse, that rider, he had a bride, too. Who was the bride? The church. The Jezebel church. The loudest in church, the rebellious church. But brother says, "My message is not to that church." He says, "My new year's message is to the church elected &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ." Not just to the church groups, but the elect. The elect lady. You see this bride. She's a lady. She knows how to sit down. &gt;&gt; She knows how to stand up like a lady, &gt;&gt; talk like a lady. &gt;&gt; Now, brother says, there's women that smoke and they spit tobacco and they drink. Sometimes they they they drink more than a man. They spit like a man. But this is a lady. She sits down like a lady, stands up like a lady. &gt;&gt; She doesn't let no man touch her. &gt;&gt; She's a lady. &gt;&gt; Just like Rebecca. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As Abraham told Eleazar, I want you to go find a wife for my son Isaac. Go out there to my people. I want you to find her. Eleazar as a type of brother random. Eleazar goes, he prays and he says, "Lord, will you send her?" He had camels. Eleazar had big strong men with him. Eleazar was also a strong man, too. And in the evening time, there's the damsels came out to bring out water and he and the leazar goes up to her says, "Would you get fetch me water?" And he says, "I will and I'll give water for you and your camels." &gt;&gt; And there she is. You imagine how much water that Eleazar drank and all of those camels. How much water those camels drink? She was just a a young lady. She didn't have two buckets. She probably just had a little Spanish. We had a little call like can we have a little bucket, you know, just that's that's all she had. Come back, fill it, go back over there, fill it there. By the time she went over there, they already already done drinking that one. Come back and do it again. But Rebecca Eleazar and his servant said, "No, don't help her. Don't help her. She has to do it by herself. She has to show that she has character. Don't help her. Eleazar strong man. He could have helped her. These other strong servants, they could have helped her. But the bride has to do it by herself. &gt;&gt; No one is going to help you. &gt;&gt; This is an individual affair. &gt;&gt; She had to SHOW THAT SHE HAD CHARACTER. SHE HAD TO SHOW THAT SHE WAS A LADY. SHE WASN'T COMPLAINING, GOING BACK AND GOING HERE, GOING BACK AND GOING HERE. OH, NOBODY HELPS me here. Nobody calls me there and nobody wants to uh motivate ME TO COME TO CHURCH. NO, SHE DID IT HERSELF. &gt;&gt; CUZ SHE HAD CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; SHE WAS AN ELECT LADY. SHE KEPT GOING BACK UNTIL THOSE CAMELS WERE SATISFIED. SHE HAD CHARACTER. YOU HAVE TO DO IT BY YOURSELF. [screaming] YOU HAVE NO ONE'S GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE ALTAR AND SAY, "BROTHER, YOU GOT TO DIE. YOU GOT TO DIE." YOU YOURSELF HAVE TO DIE TO YOURSELF &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BRIDE HAS CHARACTER. IT'S NOT TEMPER. It's not anger. A character is a Christlike character that follows the word. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Not just to the church groups, but the elect. The elect lady, the elect lady of the church, Christ's bride. &gt;&gt; That's who I'm addressing. Brother Ram says, "What I can say to this last church age and we're entering the gross darkness and chaos." My says, "My my New Year's message is shalom. Peace. Shalom." That's my New Year's message to the church. Shalom. peace. &gt;&gt; People look for peace, but the only peace you can ever find is with the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; with the word. You're not going to find peace anywhere else, young person, brother, or sister. You're not going to find it anywhere else. You're not going to find it in the church. You're not going to find it decreed. You're not going to find it anywhere else. You're going to find peace the day you find God. But if you're looking for God, it's because God's been looking for you. &gt;&gt; Jesus always comes in the darkest hour. &gt;&gt; And the spiritual eclipse that we're living in, there shall be light in the evening time. &gt;&gt; There's light in Go. &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you please stand? Let's bow our heads. Dear Lord, heavenly father. Lord, we give you thanks this beautiful morning, Lord. Lord, a morning of resurrection, Father. Lord, you know your people. I don't know your I don't know the people here, Father, but you do, Lord. You know their need. You know their desires, what they're going through, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; Father. But I pray, Lord, in this hour, Lord, that could say I said [music] something, Lord, that would motivate them to keep going forward. Now, oh Lord, if I said something [music] that was wrong, Lord, may they cast it out, Lord Jesus. But Father, may you be with these people, beautiful, [music] kind people, Lord, and may you give each and every single one of them, Lord, your Holy Ghost. May you seal them with your Holy Ghost, Lord, as we living in this dark hour, Lord. Lord, may you protect us, Lord. Help us [music] to obey your word as darkness is going by and the the angel of death is passing by. Lord of spiritual death. Lord, help us to apply the blood on our doorpost to be born again Christians of [music] God, not tossed about here and there. But Lord, I place them all in your hands. Father, you bless all the young people, Lord, the children, Lord, all the departments, Father. What a beautiful church. Lord that is here today, Father. &gt;&gt; May they grow, Lord. May they stay together. [music] May they stay united working together, Lord. Father, in harmony, Lord, for all things are possible, Lord, if we can just work together, [music] Lord. Do not let an evil spirit come amongst them, Lord. Be with them and you protect them with your precious blood and our dear pastor, Brother Israel. Lord, be with them. [music] Give them wisdom. Give them understanding, Father. guidance, Lord, to guide the people here, Father. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord, be with them, Father. Give them a dove of portion of your Holy Spirit, Lord, [music] &gt;&gt; and the people that are here. But we ask this in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] And amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. ful. Walk where [singing] the de drops of mercy are bright. [singing] Shine all around us [singing] by day and by [singing] night. Jesus the light of the world.

Let your love shine through me in the night. Oh, lead me, Lord. I'll follow where you want me to go, [music] though. Oh, won't [singing] you lead me, Lord?

Lord, I pray that you would bless brother Louise, Lord, very greatly [music] for his efforts, Lord. Oh, God, for his his ministry and his labor, Lord, here in the church this [music] morning, making the trip, making the the journey, Lord, to be with us, Lord. Oh, God. I just think of [music] how Lord you started your church Lord. you put your spirit in your church, Lord, [music] and how it veered off, Lord. But how you knew that it would, and how you sent, [music] Lord, a restoration ministry in this last day, Lord, you didn't have to do that, Lord. No obligations, Lord, but you in your loving kindness, Lord. You came down, Lord, and said, [music] "This is the way. Walk therein." Oh God, in this day of Lord gloomy darkness, it's not fully dark, not fully light, Lord. It's deceptive, Lord. But oh God, [music] you said your people have observed a great light. Oh Lord Jesus, we're so thankful [music] for that, Lord. for the spirit that you've placed in the church to combat, Lord, the spirit of Antichrist in [music] this day to rise up out of it, Lord, to rise a little higher. The spirit of an eagle, Lord, you've said to [music] your church, come out of her. Be not partaker of her her sins and her iniquities, [music] Lord Jesus, in this confusion of Babylon. So thankful for that, Lord Jesus. [music] What would we do without it? Oh, God. on our own. We had no chance, no shot, [music] Lord. And oh God, I pray that you would, Lord, give us all the character of of Rebecca, Lord. How that speaks to us, Lord, this morning. Oh God, that that labor, Lord, the bride has made herself ready, you said. Oh God, [music] feeding the very power, Lord, that would take her to her her bridegroom. Lord Jesus, let us be found doing the work of the Lord. Lord, believing, Lord, trusting, oh God, day by day. Please be with brother Israel, Lord, in his [music] ministry, Lord. Give him safe travel. Give him safe passage, Lord. Bless, Lord, greatly the meetings that he went out, Lord, there to be a part of, Lord. And let your spirit move and work through him, Lord. Work in those meetings. Bring a blessing, Lord. or bring a unity of the bride of Christ, Lord. We're detached from them physically, Lord, but oh God, we know that we're one in in the spirit of Christ. Bless us, Lord. Watch over us. Keep us all close to you, Lord. I pray that you would bring us back at the appointed time to hear from you, Lord, and just receive [music] from you a little higher, Lord, a step further in you, Lord Jesus. Pray these things in the name of the [music] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Yes. Shine [singing] on me. [music] Oh, let it shine on me. Let [music] the light [singing] from the lighthouse. Shine [singing] on me. [music] Let it shine on [singing] me. Let it shine on [singing] me. Let [music] the light from [singing] the lighthouse shine [music] on me. Amen. So, [music] just a couple of announcements. Choir practice at 3:30 this afternoon for those who are in the choir. Um, and then there will be [music] no communion tonight. So, brother Chris, thank you for for reminding us of that. So, um, Sister P, do you by chance know that song, [music] Silver and Gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee? And we won't we won't try that one. But just I was thinking when [music] brother Luis was sharing um about just with with the Catholic church and having to pay the [music] priest and how far people had come in in a short period of time from back to the initiation [music] of the church which was that open door of Pentecost. So we read about that in chapter 2 of Acts. Chapter 3 starts out with John and Peter which they say was the first [music] pope on the way to the temple to pray. And there was a lame man that was brought to the gate beautiful at the entrance to the temple. And [music] it was the exact opposite of that. It wasn't Peter or John, can I pay you [music] something? But it was asking, can you pay me something? You know, arms for the poor. And they said, silver and gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ [music] of Nazareth, rise up and walk. And he went leaping, shouting, and praising God. Amen. is that [music] is that's our standard. That's what we look at. That's the image in our mind. That's [music] where that's back at back to Pentecost. And we started the service today with what is the Holy Ghost? What's it given for? [music] And that's the open door is that open door of Pentecost. And so, amen. Lord, just that's my expectation. I want to see a church that's on fire and we have somebody that comes in with a need and is they go leaping and shouting and [music] praising God. Amen. I said I wouldn't do it and but [music] so I won't. Amen. Key of F. When the redeemed are gathering in as you go. I am thinking of a rapture in our blessed [music] home on high.
