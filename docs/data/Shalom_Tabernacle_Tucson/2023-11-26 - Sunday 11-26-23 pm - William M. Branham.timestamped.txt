[31:10] with music and we appreciate our sister
[31:13] tonight so with that brother Tim we've
[31:16] been you know brother isel's been
[31:19] talking about the firstborn before the
[31:21] meetings and then they continued if
[31:22] you'll notice with brother whisper the
[31:25] different ones with the Z zer Bell the
[31:28] the what brother Brown he called it the
[31:30] pyramid message I looked it up today he
[31:33] called it the pyramid message three
[31:35] times that might be significant I don't
[31:37] know he also called it the pyramid
[31:39] message five times I think or at least
[31:41] there's a quote five
[31:43] times probably insignificant but brother
[31:47] Israel said we should do the birth pains
[31:49] tonight so I'm really looking forward to
[31:51] continuing and building upon what he's
[31:53] talked about so be good to hear a
[31:55] portion of that we won't get it all
[31:57] tonight we'll cut cut it just for the
[32:00] sake of time the first part of that
[32:01] you'll remember brother Brown talks
[32:03] about brother Victor Leo a translator
[32:06] and in the beginning of this message be
[32:08] good to go back and hear it I kind of
[32:10] read through it and when you read it
[32:11] you've heard it so many times you can
[32:13] almost say the it was a prophecy that he
[32:17] translated about uh brother Bram the
[32:19] message and in the last words or
[32:21] something about the love divine and we
[32:24] appreciate that so much so make sure you
[32:26] read that look into that and all that
[32:28] we'll also cut a little bit off the end
[32:30] but this is also the message you're very
[32:32] familiar with that part where brother
[32:35] Brenham is a new Bible and the pages
[32:37] stick together so we hear that that's
[32:40] where we'll we'll start and it's just
[32:43] really neat there's a lot of
[32:44] significance to that as you know where
[32:47] the Lord you know in the
[32:50] scriptures quoted half half of the a
[32:53] scripture there and so we'll have part
[32:55] of that um we won't get into all of it
[32:58] but we'll start the tape right there in
[33:01] the scripture so if you'll stand with us
[33:03] we'll sing the theme song and get right
[33:05] into birth pains
[33:08] tonight
[33:13] only
[33:15] only
[33:18] believe that all things are possible yes
[33:24] when we
[33:25] only
[33:29] believe
[33:31] only
[33:34] believe
[33:36] only
[33:39] believe all things are
[33:44] possible
[33:46] only
[33:50] Bel let's remain standing and brother
[33:52] Brandon will read the
[33:54] scriptures in St uh John's gospel the
[33:59] 17th chapter and beginning with the 20th
[34:03] verse I wish to read for um a
[34:10] text I think that is right neither pray
[34:15] I for these alone but for them also
[34:18] which Shall Believe on me through their
[34:21] words
[34:23] that I believe I have got the wrong
[34:26] place
[34:29] excuse me just a moment I'm looking for
[34:32] Jesus prayer
[34:34] that or not Jesus prayer rather but for
[34:37] his U I might have got marked down here
[34:40] on my text something wrong it's where
[34:42] Jesus prayed that or was saying that as
[34:45] a woman in travail for birth of her
[34:47] child birth child birth is that Luke or
[34:49] John Jack which is that even 16th of
[34:53] John I thought that was right but it
[34:56] didn't sound very much like it the 16th
[34:59] of
[35:02] John 21st verse sure 21st verse sure
[35:07] here we
[35:10] are John St John 16 and
[35:16] 21 that they may be no brother Jack
[35:19] that's still
[35:22] wrong ver
[35:25] 16
[35:27] 16:21 I got the 16th chapter of St John
[35:31] 21st verse but it Am I
[35:35] Wrong woman
[35:38] it well there's a mess in this mix in
[35:41] this Bible yes it wrong they printed it
[35:44] wrong yes sir you know what that's
[35:47] exactly the truth here's a brand new
[35:48] Bible I've just gotten it and it's got
[35:50] It's got the it's printed wrong just
[35:53] just draw a breath there's a reason why
[35:54] it was done and you God will show you
[35:57] bring out this wonderful all thank you
[36:00] thank you very much
[36:01] 16:21 thank you very much that's
[36:06] true a woman when she very verely I say
[36:10] unto you that you shall sleep weep and
[36:15] lament but the world shall rejoice and
[36:18] ye shall be
[36:21] sorrowful your sorrow shall be turned to
[36:24] Joy a woman when she in is inail has
[36:29] sorrow because her hour cometh but as
[36:32] soon as she is delivered of the child
[36:36] she remember no more anguish anguish for
[36:41] joy that a man is Born Into the world
[36:45] thank you very much my brother I sure
[36:47] appreciate that
[36:50] now that certainly is the misprint in
[36:52] the Bible page has been put in wrong and
[36:55] I just found it on my old old scopio
[36:57] Bible and picked up this one and run up
[36:59] here with it just few moment SC calls my
[37:01] wife just give me this for Christmas
[37:03] present
[37:04] now I want to to speak this afternoon
[37:09] upon a subject that I
[37:11] announc birth pains now that sounds very
[37:17] bad but it's in the Bible I believe that
[37:20] Jesus year was speaking of as he said
[37:23] you will have uh sorrow but your sorrow
[37:27] shall be turned to Joy speaking to his
[37:31] disciples here knowing that the birth of
[37:34] the of
[37:36] Christianity was coming into
[37:40] existence and now the old has to die in
[37:44] order that the new is born to have
[37:48] anything that gives birth has to have
[37:50] Pains of distress and they certainly was
[37:54] going to go through a pain of distress
[37:58] and
[37:59] anguish to get from the law unto Grace
[38:03] normal natural birth types the spiritual
[38:07] birth all things of the natural is types
[38:11] of the
[38:13] spiritual and um we find out if we look
[38:16] out here on on the ground and see a tree
[38:18] in the earth growing is struggling for
[38:21] life that goes to show that there is a
[38:23] tree somewhere that doesn't die
[38:27] because it's a it's crying out for
[38:29] something we find people no matter how
[38:32] old how sick what condition they're
[38:35] crying out to live because it shows
[38:39] there is a life somewhere where we live
[38:43] live forever notice how perfect now in 1
[38:48] John 5:7 I believe it is if I'm not
[38:51] mistaken it said there are three that
[38:54] bear record in heaven the father father
[38:56] the word and the Holy Ghost these three
[38:59] are one there are three that bear record
[39:01] in Earth that's water blood and spirit
[39:04] and they agree in
[39:07] one now notice the first three are one
[39:12] the second three are Earthly which agree
[39:14] in one you cannot have the father
[39:16] without the son you cannot have the son
[39:18] without having the Holy Ghost but you
[39:21] can have the water without the blood and
[39:25] the blood without the spirit
[39:27] I think to our ages has proved this to
[39:29] be true water blood spirit justification
[39:34] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[39:36] spirit that types or makes the or
[39:42] antitype which takes away from the
[39:45] natural birth look on a a woman or
[39:48] anything intervail for birth the first
[39:52] thing comes to pass the breaking of the
[39:54] water a normal birth second thing is the
[39:58] blood and then comes Life water blood
[40:04] spirit and that constitutes the normal
[40:07] natural birth and so is it in the
[40:10] spiritual realm it's water justification
[40:14] by faith believing on God receiving as
[40:16] your personal Savior and being baptized
[40:19] second is sanctification of the spirit
[40:21] that God cleanses the spirit from all uh
[40:24] elements of the world and the desire of
[40:26] the world and then the Holy Spirit comes
[40:29] in and gives New Birth and fills up that
[40:32] Sanctified vessel for instance like this
[40:35] that I told you what you don't believe
[40:37] lay aside and then take the pine notice
[40:40] now a glass is laying out in the chicken
[40:42] yard you don't just pick that up and put
[40:44] on your table and fill it up with water
[40:46] or milk no but picking it up is
[40:49] justification cleansing it is
[40:52] sanctification calls the Greek word
[40:54] sanctifies a compound word which means
[40:56] means cleansed and set aside for service
[40:59] not in service for service then when you
[41:03] fill it it is put in service excuse this
[41:07] now not to hurt that's where you Pilgrim
[41:11] Holiness nazarin failed to walk on up
[41:13] into Pentecost you was cleansed by
[41:15] sanctification but when you were ready
[41:17] to put in service by the gifts of
[41:19] speaking in tongues and another thing
[41:20] you turned it down drop back out in the
[41:22] pen again see now that's that's what
[41:25] happens at all always does that now not
[41:27] to criticize you now but just I I want
[41:29] to get this off my heart and it's been
[41:32] burning me ever since I've been here so
[41:34] I might as well just if Carl's Grace and
[41:37] Deus and them and your alls I I'll try
[41:39] my best to deliver my soul from it see
[41:41] that's up to you normal typing the
[41:46] spiritual now we find out then and it's
[41:50] fully born when the baby usually now
[41:54] when the water breaks you don't have to
[41:55] do very much about
[41:57] it and when the blood comes you don't
[42:00] have to do much about it but in order to
[42:02] get life and the baby you've got to give
[42:05] him a
[42:06] spanking to make him yell
[42:08] out and um that's uh now without
[42:13] education as my brethren here are so
[42:17] well trained to it there's but I have to
[42:21] take nature to type
[42:23] it and there you are that's what happen
[42:26] at taking a real spanking to get this to
[42:28] them now you take a little some kind of
[42:30] a shock maybe wouldn't have to spank him
[42:33] but just shock him a little the very
[42:37] idea of him being born sometimes will do
[42:39] it grab him Shake him you don't start
[42:41] breathing spank him a little and then he
[42:45] yells
[42:46] out and unknown tongues to himself I
[42:51] guess
[42:53] but anyhow he he's making a
[42:57] noise when I think if a baby is born
[43:00] just by by still birth with no sound no
[43:04] emotion that's a dead baby that's what's
[43:08] the matter with the church today the
[43:09] system we got too many stillborn
[43:11] children right they need a gospel
[43:14] spanking you see and so uh to wake them
[43:18] up to bring him to themselves so that
[43:21] God can breathe the breath of life into
[43:23] them and now we find that that's so true
[43:28] it's crude theology but it's the truth
[43:30] anyhow so notice in a seeds birth the
[43:35] old seed must
[43:38] die before the new one can be born so
[43:42] therefore death is hard anytime so it's
[43:47] painful it's
[43:49] distressful uh birth is the same because
[43:52] you're bringing life into the world and
[43:55] it's it's painful Jesus said that his
[43:59] word was a seed that a sar went forth to
[44:02] SW now we're all acquainted with that
[44:05] and I want to teach this like a Sunday
[44:07] school lesson because it's Sunday notice
[44:11] then
[44:12] this uh word being a seed but remember
[44:17] the the seed is only bringing forth a
[44:20] new life when it dies and that's the
[44:21] reason it was so hard for those
[44:24] Pharisees to understand our Lord Jesus
[44:27] Christ because they were under the
[44:30] law and the law had was the word of God
[44:34] In seed form but when the word was made
[44:39] flesh and become not law but
[44:43] Grace now Grace and law cannot exist at
[44:46] the same time because Grace is the far
[44:50] above law laws not even in the
[44:53] picture and therefore it's so hard hard
[44:56] for the Pharisees to die to their law so
[44:59] that Grace could be born but it must go
[45:04] the two laws cannot exist at the same
[45:06] time there cannot be a law says that you
[45:08] can run this seore and the other says
[45:11] you can run it one says you can one says
[45:13] you can it has to be one law at a time
[45:17] maybe one time you could have went
[45:18] through it caution go through it but
[45:20] this time it's red stop and so there
[45:24] cannot be two laws exist at the the same
[45:26] time
[45:28] now we notice that always my thought now
[45:31] to you it takes pain distress
[45:36] discomfort look how them Pharisees died
[45:39] to that law through pain distress
[45:43] discomfort but it must
[45:46] be now we find that rain which brings
[45:50] forth fruit upon the Earth it's bned as
[45:55] the PO said in the fields of
[45:58] thunder and a ragged Jagged
[46:01] Skies but if we didn't have the Thunder
[46:04] and the Ragged Jagged Skies the little
[46:08] distilled drop of rain that's been
[46:10] lifted from the Seas and distill from
[46:13] the salt it would not be
[46:16] born it takes that lightning thunder
[46:20] blast ragged rugged fearful thing to
[46:24] bring forth the soft petal drops of
[46:28] water it takes pain to bring forth birth
[46:32] it takes dying and as the clouds die
[46:37] rain is born because rain is a part of
[46:40] that
[46:42] cloud one has to see so the other one
[46:46] can
[46:49] exist my brethren here some of them was
[46:51] able they could give you all the laws of
[46:53] those things I can't
[46:56] now let's drop over to another thing
[46:59] just for a little proof I think one of
[47:01] the prettiest flowers everybody has
[47:04] their own ideas of them but I think the
[47:07] prettiest flower that I've nearly ever
[47:09] seen is back in the East our Pond Lily
[47:13] how many you ever seen a Pond Lily oh
[47:15] there's just nothing like it to
[47:18] me but did you
[47:20] notice what that Pond Lily had to be I
[47:23] think of what Jesus said consider the
[47:27] Lily how it toils and
[47:30] spins but yet I say unto you that
[47:33] Solomon in all of his glory was not
[47:36] arrayed like one of these for Solomon's
[47:39] glory and his arrayment was all
[47:43] artificial but the Lily in its beauty is
[47:47] life that's making it beautiful not some
[47:52] artificial uh smear on paint on just
[47:55] just
[47:57] like our
[48:01] women I don't think you have to have all
[48:04] this
[48:05] green you know and ey wiers you know out
[48:10] like that and all that manicure or not I
[48:13] get that stuff mixed up all on your face
[48:15] to make you
[48:17] pretty pretty is as pretty
[48:21] does if you'll add a
[48:24] little
[48:26] Acts 2 and
[48:28] 4 mix it all up together a little John
[48:32] 3:16 it'll be anything that Max fact
[48:35] ever did try
[48:38] [Applause]
[48:41] to your husband will love you more
[48:44] everybody else will I'm sure God
[48:47] will
[48:49] Lily he said consider it how it grows
[48:53] toils has to bring itself up this Little
[48:57] Pond Lily look where it come through
[49:01] dirt muff mud Muddy Waters dirty Waters
[49:07] pressed its way through all of that this
[49:10] little germ of Life working itself from
[49:12] the bottom of the pond where the frogs
[49:15] and and things are at and then brings
[49:20] itself up through all of that but when
[49:23] it gets in the presence of the Sun
[49:26] it's
[49:28] born the little seed burst open into
[49:32] life it cannot do that until it goes
[49:35] through all that
[49:37] process it's got to come through that
[49:39] that's what makes
[49:42] it is because that the sun itself is
[49:46] what's drawing it and when it gets fully
[49:49] above all the dirty Waters and muck and
[49:53] so forth then it's so happy it just
[49:56] gives its life out freely and it's a
[49:58] beautiful life when it gets in the
[50:00] presence of that which is drawn it
[50:03] up I think that's a beautiful type of
[50:05] Christian Life when something is drawing
[50:08] you out of the world until one day
[50:10] you're born right into its Presence by
[50:13] the Holy Spirit how
[50:15] beautiful if you try to help it you kill
[50:19] it like a little chicken when it's being
[50:23] born you know if you ever notice one of
[50:26] the little fellas right on top of his
[50:28] little beak or any bird that's born from
[50:32] an egg it's it's got It's maturing this
[50:36] old egg
[50:38] shell the old inner parts of the eggs
[50:41] has to to rot
[50:43] away and it has to take this little beak
[50:46] and scrape back and forth Until It
[50:49] Breaks the shell out we call it pipping
[50:52] its way out down in Kentucky where I
[50:55] come from
[50:56] piping his way out they've never found a
[50:59] better
[51:04] way why it's God's provided
[51:07] way you try to help him you kill him
[51:10] pick the shell off of him you'll die see
[51:13] he's got to
[51:15] labor strain Break
[51:19] Forth that's the way a Christian has to
[51:22] do it ain't somebody just shaking your
[51:24] hand take in you got to lay there till
[51:28] you die Ro and are born into the kingdom
[51:32] of God it's God's provided way you don't
[51:34] go in by book or Shake hand and jar pump
[51:37] up pull down you you just simply uh had
[51:41] to get away from the old
[51:43] Shell
[51:45] notice no better way have they ever
[51:48] found they found no better way for a
[51:51] baby to get What It Wants besides God's
[51:54] way for yes now when that little baby's
[51:57] born you could um set a bell down here
[52:01] Bes side his little crib say my little
[52:05] son I am a a
[52:09] theologian in the way I've read books on
[52:11] how to raise a
[52:13] baby and I tell you you're a modern
[52:16] child you've been born in a modern home
[52:19] by a modern
[52:21] parent when you're hungry or need mother
[52:24] I just ring the little
[52:26] bell it'll never
[52:30] work the only way that it can get what
[52:33] it wants is the cry for that's God's
[52:36] way and that's the way that we get what
[52:39] we want is cry Far Cry out don't be
[52:43] ashamed say I'm hungering for God don't
[52:47] care where the deacons pastors or
[52:49] whatever it is around scream out anyhow
[52:51] the Joneses are sitting there what
[52:53] difference does it make cry out that's
[52:55] only way there is to get it until you
[52:57] get
[52:58] help he taught that when he was here on
[53:01] Earth you know about the unjust Jud a
[53:04] little do
[53:06] drop I don't know the farmer of it maybe
[53:09] there' be a science share I'm go to say
[53:11] way I think it might be
[53:15] a some kind of a congested group of
[53:19] atmosphere come together in a dark
[53:23] night and it falls to the
[53:26] Earth and when it does it's borned in
[53:30] the
[53:31] night but in the morning it's laying
[53:34] there cold and shivering on a little uh
[53:37] blade of grass or hanging on your
[53:38] clothes
[53:40] line but just let the sun shine out once
[53:44] did you notice how happy it gets it just
[53:48] glistens and quivers why it knows that
[53:51] it's that sunlight is going to draw it
[53:54] back to where it was at the beginning
[53:56] and so is every man or woman that's born
[53:59] to the spirit of God there's something
[54:01] about it when light spreads over
[54:04] us that we're happy because we know
[54:06] we're going back to where we come from
[54:10] from the bosom of
[54:12] God can Sparkle with joy when the Sun
[54:15] hits it of course KN it's going the
[54:17] where it come from Little crude things
[54:20] but we could keep on with them but let's
[54:22] find something else we know the old
[54:25] seed
[54:27] is must before the new seed can come out
[54:30] of the old seed it must rot absolutely
[54:34] not die only but rot after its
[54:40] death we know that to be
[54:43] true that's the same thing in New
[54:48] Birth we never go
[54:52] back but we go forward when you're born
[54:56] again and that's why I think today we
[54:58] have so
[55:00] many uh not so many rather genuine New
[55:05] Birth is because the seed is
[55:09] maybe of sympathize with the word or the
[55:12] person but they don't want to rock away
[55:16] from the old system that they were in
[55:19] they don't want to come out of it they
[55:22] want to stay in the old system and claim
[55:25] the new birth or the message of the age
[55:29] we found that under the Luther Wesley
[55:32] Pentecostals and all other ages they
[55:35] still try to hold on to the old system
[55:37] and claim this but the old system age
[55:40] must
[55:42] die rough in order to bring forth the
[55:45] new one they still want to claim notice
[55:48] they know the old system is dead but
[55:51] they just don't want to rot out of it
[55:56] now rock is what it really is done away
[56:00] with when a a claim is made that they
[56:03] are
[56:04] newborn but a claim is only a begotten
[56:08] sign rotten brings forth the new birth
[56:11] got to rot away from it just as we did
[56:13] in all ages through the wesling and all
[56:16] fourth but the thing of it is after that
[56:19] new Perth is born Wesley or Luther came
[56:22] forth with one word the just shall live
[56:24] by faith
[56:27] well he could not no longer cling on to
[56:30] the old system he had to come out of
[56:34] it and then when the calvinist got the
[56:37] angelan church in such a condition under
[56:40] the calvinistic doctrine until God
[56:42] raised up an Armenian
[56:45] Doctrine which was John Wesley the old
[56:48] system had to die in order for the new
[56:51] to come on and when Wesley's age ceased
[56:56] and all the little ages or blades that
[56:58] come out on the stock of the tosel in
[57:01] Wesley's time see when Pentecost come
[57:04] out with the restoration of the gifts
[57:07] they had to come out of Baptist
[57:11] Presbyterian Pilgrim Holiness
[57:13] nazarenes Church of Christ socalled and
[57:17] all that they had to come out of it R
[57:20] away from it to accept the new birth
[57:23] you're always called crazy
[57:25] but it's as like Paul said when he rot
[57:28] it out of what he once he said in the
[57:31] way that's called heresy that's the way
[57:33] I worship the god of our fathers in the
[57:36] way that's called heresy see it accepted
[57:38] the new life that the Old Testament had
[57:41] give birth to the new and he had to rot
[57:43] away from the old just make it a shadow
[57:45] in order to be that's just where we are
[57:49] at
[57:50] now
[57:53] now bear with me me but that's my
[57:57] idea the churches has got so
[58:00] systematically till you can't get into
[58:02] one unless you belong to one you've got
[58:05] to have a fellowship card or some kind
[58:07] of a identification and by believing
[58:10] this the only door I really have open is
[58:12] these
[58:13] businessmen and as long as they're not
[58:15] an organization I can go in with them
[58:18] but and get the bring the message that I
[58:20] feel that's on my heart to the people
[58:23] but it's not so systematic saying I love
[58:25] you Pentecostal people and Pentecost is
[58:28] not an organization anyhow you just call
[58:31] yourself that Pentecost is an
[58:35] experience and not a
[58:37] denomination but you see the thing of it
[58:40] is is so hard for many men when they
[58:42] look at it and believe it and see it so
[58:44] identified by God in the word yet it's
[58:47] so hard to rot away from that thing
[58:49] you've been in what would I do where did
[58:51] I get my meal what God is your meal meal
[58:55] God is a thing for you to hold on seek
[58:57] ye first the kingdom of God and his
[58:59] righteousness I'll leave it lay at that
[59:01] you know what I'm talking about we are
[59:03] told by God's
[59:06] prophets that we are to have a new Earth
[59:10] a new Heaven and a new Earth if you want
[59:13] scripture that is revelation 21 I can
[59:14] quote it before you have it here John
[59:16] said I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth
[59:19] for the first heaven and first Earth was
[59:22] passed away it was gone
[59:26] now if we're to have a new Earth the old
[59:30] Earth and the new Earth cannot exist at
[59:32] the same time or the new world the old
[59:34] world cannot exist at the same time
[59:36] there can't be two World orders together
[59:38] at the same time now in order to get the
[59:41] new Earth the old one has to
[59:44] die now if the old one has to die then
[59:48] it's giving birth pains for a new one
[59:51] now and then if a doctor went to examine
[59:54] a patient
[59:55] that was in labor now the one of the
[59:58] things that doctor would do which I'm
[1:00:01] talking in the presence of two or three
[1:00:03] I know of good medical doctors here
[1:00:06] Christian
[1:00:07] doctors and I I I would ask you this one
[1:00:11] of the first things that doctor does
[1:00:13] after he's been watching the patient is
[1:00:16] to time the pains birth pains he times
[1:00:23] the pains how close together and how
[1:00:25] much more terrific each one gets one is
[1:00:29] more harder to have than the other one
[1:00:33] next one still harder get closer
[1:00:36] together that's the way he diagnoses the
[1:00:38] case by the birth pains
[1:00:42] well if the world has to give away to
[1:00:45] the birth of a new
[1:00:47] world let's just examine some of the
[1:00:50] birth pains were're having on the earth
[1:00:53] and then we'll see about what day and
[1:00:55] it's about how far she is along in her
[1:00:58] labor yes the first world
[1:01:02] war showed great pain birth pains it
[1:01:05] showed one of the first birth Pains of
[1:01:08] her going into labor because of that
[1:01:12] time for her we had brought forth the
[1:01:16] bombs and we had uh uh machine guns and
[1:01:20] poison gas and you remember maybe many
[1:01:23] of you cannot was just a little boy of
[1:01:25] about 8 years old but I remember them
[1:01:27] speaking of this mustard and chlorine
[1:01:29] gas and so forth how this looked like a
[1:01:31] just get started and they said it would
[1:01:33] burn up the whole earth it kill
[1:01:35] everybody well it might be a a Breaking
[1:01:39] of that it's winds blowed across the
[1:01:41] Earth and how everybody was scared to
[1:01:43] death of that great weapon of poison gas
[1:01:47] the Earth went through its first birth
[1:01:51] pains and we find out now we've had had
[1:01:54] a second war world war and her pains was
[1:01:59] much greater more terrific all the time
[1:02:02] the birth Pains of the earth she almost
[1:02:05] had to give away during the time of the
[1:02:07] atomic bomb because it would destroy a
[1:02:10] whole city it was much greater than the
[1:02:13] Pains of the first world war of
[1:02:15] Destruction to the earth now she knows
[1:02:19] that her time of Deliverance is at hand
[1:02:23] that's the reason she's so nervous
[1:02:26] flustrated as she is is because that
[1:02:29] there is a hydrogen bomb and missiles of
[1:02:33] the air that could destroy the whole
[1:02:36] world one nation is scared of the other
[1:02:38] no matter how little it is they've got
[1:02:40] those missiles that they claim just one
[1:02:42] of them they can direct them by the
[1:02:44] stars and drop them anywhere in the
[1:02:45] world they want to Russia as I heard on
[1:02:49] news the other day she claims that she
[1:02:51] can destroy this nation and and keep the
[1:02:54] Adams or the things from breaking up her
[1:02:57] Nation we don't know what to do about it
[1:03:00] everyone's making these claims and it's
[1:03:01] so people's science has broke into God's
[1:03:05] Great laboratory until they're going to
[1:03:06] destroy themselves God let always let
[1:03:10] wisdom destroy
[1:03:12] himself God doesn't destroy anything man
[1:03:14] destroys himself by wisdom as he did at
[1:03:17] the beginning taking Satan's wisdom and
[1:03:20] instead of God's word now she knows she
[1:03:23] must give away she cannot stand it
[1:03:26] Russia I believe would destroy this
[1:03:28] nation today if she thought that she
[1:03:30] could destroy it and then preserve
[1:03:32] herself any of those little Nations
[1:03:34] could do it but they're afraid because
[1:03:37] they know that this world cannot stand
[1:03:40] in its orbit under such conditions so
[1:03:43] the world knows that her birth pains is
[1:03:45] so great she's got to give away there's
[1:03:48] going to be a new birth born at hand I'm
[1:03:52] thankful for that I'm tired of the this
[1:03:54] one any anyone knows that that here it's
[1:03:58] a place of death and sorrow and all
[1:04:02] kinds of discrepancies and so forth I'm
[1:04:04] glad that she has to give away I'm glad
[1:04:06] that time is at hand as John said of old
[1:04:09] even so come Lord Jesus now she must rot
[1:04:13] of course as I have said in order to
[1:04:14] bring new birth look what she's rotted
[1:04:17] into notice my
[1:04:20] brethren she's totally rotten
[1:04:25] her politics and systems is just as
[1:04:28] rotten as they can be there isn't a
[1:04:29] sound bone in her in her World Systems
[1:04:33] her politics and her religious politics
[1:04:36] and whatever it is one says I'm a
[1:04:38] Democrat I'm a republican I'm methodis
[1:04:40] I'm Baptist why the whole thing's rotten
[1:04:43] to the
[1:04:44] core got to be something give away she
[1:04:47] can't stand if you put a George
[1:04:49] Washington or an Abraham Lincoln in
[1:04:51] every County in this United States is
[1:04:53] still couldn't come back it's beyond
[1:04:56] Redemption there's only one thing can
[1:04:58] help her that's the coming of the
[1:05:00] Creator
[1:05:03] amen she knows she must give away she's
[1:05:07] in pain and distress one don't know what
[1:05:10] to do the one's looking this way and one
[1:05:11] that way and everything one scared of
[1:05:13] the other one trying to do something to
[1:05:15] destroy this and this and trying to
[1:05:16] contradict that and destroy the other
[1:05:18] until now they've got it in the hands of
[1:05:20] sinful man who could destroy the whole
[1:05:23] world and a 5 minutes time so she knows
[1:05:27] she can't stand it the people know she
[1:05:29] can't stand it and the world knows that
[1:05:31] they going to it's going to happen for
[1:05:33] God said it was the whole heavens and
[1:05:36] Earth's going to be on fire it's going
[1:05:37] to be a renovation of the whole thing so
[1:05:39] the new world can be born God has
[1:05:42] prophesied it she's rotten in all of her
[1:05:44] systems and she's got to do that to
[1:05:46] right away that's why she I said she's
[1:05:48] so nervous and red in the face and
[1:05:50] flustrated and earthquakes everywhere
[1:05:53] and up and down the coast and tidal
[1:05:55] waves in Alaska and shaking up and down
[1:05:58] the coast of earthquakes and things and
[1:06:00] people writing shall we leave it shall
[1:06:01] we leave it see they don't know what to
[1:06:03] do there's no safety zone but
[1:06:07] one that's Christ the son of the Living
[1:06:10] God and there's only one thing that is
[1:06:13] the safety zone and that's him all
[1:06:16] outside of there will perish this is
[1:06:18] certain as God said so now let's look at
[1:06:22] the doctor's book if she is in this kind
[1:06:24] of a condition and see if this is
[1:06:27] supposed to happen when the new Earth is
[1:06:30] to be born Matthew 24 in the doctor's
[1:06:34] book which is the Bible and let's see
[1:06:36] what's prophesied what are symptoms
[1:06:38] would be now if a doctor knows the
[1:06:41] symptoms of birth of a child and just
[1:06:43] about time the child's to come he gets
[1:06:45] everything ready because he knows that
[1:06:47] that is the um the time the child's to
[1:06:50] be born to C all symptoms shows the the
[1:06:53] water's broke the blood and now the it's
[1:06:56] time the child's dropped it's time for
[1:06:58] the child to be born and so he gets
[1:07:00] everything ready for it now Jesus told
[1:07:03] us just exactly what would take place
[1:07:05] just at this time he told us in Matthew
[1:07:08] 24 that the church true church and the
[1:07:12] other Church would be Church natural
[1:07:14] Church spiritual would be so close
[1:07:17] together
[1:07:19] impersonators until it would deceive the
[1:07:22] very elected if it was
[1:07:25] possible how that in was the days of
[1:07:28] Noah how this eating drinking marrying
[1:07:30] giving in marriage and all this uh
[1:07:33] immorality of the world that we see
[1:07:35] today the Bible the book the doctor's
[1:07:38] book said it would happen so when we see
[1:07:41] this happening we know that the birth is
[1:07:44] at hand amen it's got to be yes sir now
[1:07:49] we look at that as as a nation as not a
[1:07:52] nation but a world now
[1:07:54] Israel the church let's start back with
[1:07:56] her a few minutes and let's follow her
[1:07:58] for the next 10 minutes maybe Israel had
[1:08:02] birth pains under every Prophet that
[1:08:05] came to the Earth she had birth pains at
[1:08:08] his message for what did he do the
[1:08:11] prophet had the word and um and she had
[1:08:16] sown so much rottenness and made so much
[1:08:19] systematic orders in her being until
[1:08:22] this Prophet sh off of her foundation
[1:08:25] they were hated by everybody so
[1:08:29] therefore when God sent a prophet the
[1:08:33] church itself wanted to birth pains
[1:08:35] because the prophet the word of the Lord
[1:08:37] comes to the prophet and him
[1:08:40] only that is the word that's spoken for
[1:08:43] that day is made manifest by the prophet
[1:08:45] of that age always has been and the
[1:08:48] church has built so many systems around
[1:08:50] the word until he shuer off her rocker
[1:08:53] honey come she had birth pains what was
[1:08:56] it back to the word back to the life
[1:09:00] systems doesn't have a life it's only
[1:09:02] God's word has
[1:09:04] life the systems is filled around it
[1:09:07] well it does not have life it is the
[1:09:10] word that gives life his message rocked
[1:09:14] The Remnant back to the word a little
[1:09:16] group of come out believe sometimes
[1:09:17] maybe in no's time only about eight
[1:09:20] people but anyhow God rocked The Remnant
[1:09:23] and destroyed the rest of it had to rock
[1:09:26] away it did that all down Through the
[1:09:29] Ages until
[1:09:31] finally the church delivered to them a
[1:09:36] Manchild and that Manchild was the word
[1:09:39] itself made
[1:09:41] flesh in the beginning was the word and
[1:09:43] the word is with God and the Word was
[1:09:45] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:09:48] dwelt Among Us he conquered every devil
[1:09:51] every Power upon the Earth and that come
[1:09:54] against him with the father's word only
[1:09:55] every Temptation that Satan give him he
[1:09:58] rebuked Satan not with his his own
[1:10:01] powers that he had but with the word of
[1:10:03] God it is written it is written it is
[1:10:07] written for he was the word when Satan
[1:10:11] flew against Eve she wasn't the word so
[1:10:13] it failed when he flew against Moses it
[1:10:16] did the same thing but when he hid into
[1:10:18] this son of God he was 10,000 BTS that
[1:10:21] knocked the loose feathers out of him
[1:10:23] when he come back and said it's written
[1:10:26] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:10:28] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:10:30] mouth of God there was that man child
[1:10:33] made flesh God's Eternal Word himself
[1:10:36] manifested in a body of Flesh here on
[1:10:38] Earth to represent the word that's how
[1:10:42] he know what was in their hearts that's
[1:10:44] how he could tell fil where he was who
[1:10:47] he was he could tell Simon Peter who he
[1:10:49] was told the woman at the well why he
[1:10:52] was the word
[1:10:54] yes right the Bible said in Hebrews the
[1:10:57] 4th chapter the word of God is sharper
[1:11:00] more powerful than a two-age sword uh
[1:11:03] cutting us Su even to the mar of the
[1:11:05] bone and a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:11:09] the intents of the
[1:11:10] heart why those blinded Pharisee priests
[1:11:14] couldn't see that that was the word made
[1:11:18] manifest or they wrapped up into a
[1:11:21] priesthood and a system and the old
[1:11:23] system had had to give away it was the
[1:11:25] word but what have been promised had
[1:11:27] been fulfilled so if it's fulfilled it's
[1:11:29] got to run away it's the whole the seed
[1:11:32] went
[1:11:33] on Moses could not have brought Noah's
[1:11:36] message neither could Jesus have brought
[1:11:38] Noah's message because it was another
[1:11:40] age and the old seed was right but it
[1:11:43] served his purpose and was dead and gone
[1:11:45] on the transformation from the old to
[1:11:47] the new where the life was at was what
[1:11:50] was worrying the people what worries
[1:11:53] them yesterday name we're not building a
[1:11:55] wall like we start off with Luther's
[1:11:57] message go right down a straight line or
[1:11:59] Pentecostal message right we are turning
[1:12:01] the corners we're building a
[1:12:04] building God's word is the blueprint
[1:12:07] anybody can run a straight line but it
[1:12:09] takes a Mason to turn the
[1:12:11] corner it takes the power of God to do
[1:12:14] that it takes an anointed one from
[1:12:16] Heaven to be sent down to do that it has
[1:12:19] an every
[1:12:20] age in the prophet's age the world the
[1:12:23] Lord comes to those prophets and they
[1:12:25] turned those Corners made those
[1:12:27] difference but the builders wanted to
[1:12:29] build a wall it's not a wall at all it's
[1:12:31] a
[1:12:33] building a building of God now we feel
[1:12:37] and know that this is the truth that the
[1:12:40] systems was rocked in every age and
[1:12:42] every one of their systems had to root
[1:12:45] and die out until she brought forth that
[1:12:48] church out of that rotten mess came
[1:12:51] forth the word itself
[1:12:53] the word of the Lord come to the
[1:12:57] prophets never come to the
[1:12:59] priest it come to the
[1:13:02] prophets and notice and when it did
[1:13:05] finally that word all together was born
[1:13:09] here in human flesh the fullness of the
[1:13:12] godhead bodily rested in him he was the
[1:13:19] word the prophets is part of the word
[1:13:22] the word for their
[1:13:23] age we today are part of the word who
[1:13:27] follow the word but he was the entire
[1:13:30] fullness of the word he was the word yes
[1:13:35] he said when they was accusing him
[1:13:38] making himself equal with God because he
[1:13:39] was the son of God they said to him well
[1:13:42] you make yourself God he said isn't it
[1:13:44] written in your laws that you called
[1:13:46] those who the word of God came to Gods
[1:13:50] the prophets and they
[1:13:52] were then how can you condemn me when I
[1:13:55] say I am the Son of God where the
[1:13:57] fullness of the godhead bodily rested in
[1:13:59] the Son of God he was the full
[1:14:01] manifestation of God that's what finally
[1:14:04] the birth pains under those prophets
[1:14:06] while them being the word they pointed
[1:14:08] that fullness of themselves the fullness
[1:14:11] of the word and then finally the systems
[1:14:14] died away until the word was made flesh
[1:14:17] and dwelled Among Us watch How It Was
[1:14:19] portrayed in Jacob watch how was
[1:14:21] portrayed in Joseph exactly loved of his
[1:14:25] brother his father hated by his brother
[1:14:28] without a cause he was spiritual could
[1:14:30] fora tell things and interpret dreams he
[1:14:33] couldn't help being that he was just
[1:14:34] born that he was predestinated to be
[1:14:36] that but was hated by his brothers and
[1:14:39] finally sold him for 30 pieces of silver
[1:14:42] almost 30 pieces and was raised up set
[1:14:45] at the right hand of pharaoh look in his
[1:14:47] prison there was a butler and a baker
[1:14:50] one was lost and one was saved Jesus in
[1:14:52] his prison on the cross cross one was
[1:14:54] lost one was saved exactly then exalted
[1:14:57] into heavens and sat down on the throne
[1:14:59] of God and when he shall leave again
[1:15:02] there will be a sound go forth bow the
[1:15:04] KNE and every tongue confessed and when
[1:15:06] Joseph left the throne and started
[1:15:08] forward a trumpet sounded and every knee
[1:15:11] had to Bow Joseph was coming so someday
[1:15:14] the great Trumpet Of God shall sound the
[1:15:16] dad he Christ shall rise and every knee
[1:15:18] shall bow and every tongue shall confess
[1:15:21] to this word but what's coming after
[1:15:23] what's he coming here for notice she
[1:15:27] brought forth this complete word which
[1:15:29] was made flesh under birth Pains of the
[1:15:31] prophets that blasted out he's a coming
[1:15:34] he's a coming he's a coming now but she
[1:15:38] was without a prophet for 400 years
[1:15:41] according to history and the scripture
[1:15:43] from Malachi until John they only had
[1:15:48] theologians priests pastors now here we
[1:15:52] can imagine
[1:15:53] without that what kind of a rotten
[1:15:56] condition her system must have been in
[1:15:58] 400 years without a message direct thus
[1:16:02] sayth the Lord from God so the priests
[1:16:05] prophets and so forth had got it into an
[1:16:07] awful mess she was rotten then John the
[1:16:10] promised Elijah of Malachi 3 not Malachi
[1:16:15] 4 Malachi 3 because Jesus said the same
[1:16:19] thing in in Matthew the 11th chapter
[1:16:22] when John's Eagle Eye got filmed over as
[1:16:25] I believe P's early ages expresses and
[1:16:28] he said go ask him if he is the one or
[1:16:31] should we look for another thing and he
[1:16:35] said Jesus after sending his disciples
[1:16:37] back after telling to stay at the
[1:16:39] meeting and watch what happened and go
[1:16:41] show John these things and bless his he
[1:16:43] not offended he turned and looked to the
[1:16:45] his disciples and the people he was
[1:16:47] speaking to you he said what did you go
[1:16:48] out to see when you went to see John he
[1:16:51] said did you go out to see a man and
[1:16:53] soft rment and he said I say unto you
[1:16:56] that's the kind that stays in King's
[1:16:58] palaces he said did you go out to see a
[1:17:01] h a reed that was shaken by the wind in
[1:17:04] other words every little thing come
[1:17:05] along he shook by it I'll tell you if
[1:17:09] you just come over join our group we can
[1:17:10] give you a better salary not John if you
[1:17:14] just won't preach against this and that
[1:17:15] well you can join in our groups not John
[1:17:18] said then what did you go out to see a
[1:17:21] prophet and I say you more than a
[1:17:24] prophet for if you can receive it this
[1:17:27] is he who was spoken of by the prophet
[1:17:29] saying I'll send my messenger before my
[1:17:31] face to prepare the way that's Malachi
[1:17:33] 3:1 not Malachi 4 at all that's a
[1:17:36] different because that Elijah come the
[1:17:38] world's to be burnt immediately and the
[1:17:40] righteous walk out on the ashes of the
[1:17:41] wicked now notice his message never
[1:17:44] stirred them very much from their
[1:17:46] ecclesiastical sleep they just said
[1:17:49] there's a crazy man down there passing
[1:17:50] by soon call himself crazy trying drown
[1:17:53] people down there in water why there's
[1:17:55] nothing to that old man why he don't
[1:17:57] even have on right kind of clothes he's
[1:17:58] got his sheep's getting wrapped around
[1:18:00] where he his PO his job's turkey why
[1:18:02] what Seminary did he ever come out of
[1:18:04] what Fellowship card we not even
[1:18:06] cooperate in his meetings we just let
[1:18:08] him stay down there and starve it out
[1:18:10] the world hasn't changed very much
[1:18:13] neither has the systems but we'll just
[1:18:15] let him stay down there he don't have
[1:18:16] any you know why he didn't remember his
[1:18:19] father was a priest but why didn't he
[1:18:22] follow the line of his father which was
[1:18:24] customed for the children to do in those
[1:18:26] days because he had something too
[1:18:28] greater a message he was to introduce
[1:18:30] the
[1:18:31] Messiah for the Holy Spirit had said so
[1:18:34] that little Rim that that had been
[1:18:36] brought back by the message of Gabriel
[1:18:38] down there knew that that would be so so
[1:18:41] we're told about 9 years old he went to
[1:18:43] the Wilderness after losing his father
[1:18:45] and mother that he went into the
[1:18:47] Wilderness because he had to hear
[1:18:49] exactly C in that great big theological
[1:18:52] uh building there that said now I know
[1:18:54] that you're supposed to be the one to
[1:18:55] announce the Messiah Isaiah said you was
[1:18:57] coming so you are going to be that voice
[1:18:59] now don't you think if brother Jones
[1:19:01] here just beats that just exactly and
[1:19:02] he'd be easily persuaded but he never
[1:19:04] learned any of their systems his message
[1:19:07] was too important he went out into the
[1:19:09] Wilderness to stay notice this message
[1:19:12] wasn't like a theologian he used types
[1:19:15] he said oh you generation of
[1:19:18] snakes calling those clergymen snakes
[1:19:22] the one of the bad things that he had
[1:19:24] found in the wilderness one of the
[1:19:25] sneaking things the snakes and he
[1:19:28] thought that's just about the best
[1:19:29] comparison I know he said you generation
[1:19:31] of bipers who's warned you from the
[1:19:34] Wrath to come don't begin to say we
[1:19:36] belong to this and that for God's able
[1:19:39] these stones to rise children to Abraham
[1:19:42] these Stones what he found in the
[1:19:43] wilderness and on the creek Bank also
[1:19:46] the axe what he used in the Wilder laid
[1:19:48] to the root of the tree what he saw in
[1:19:50] the wilderness every tree that bringeth
[1:19:51] forth not good fruit you know where he
[1:19:53] got his firewood see he h him down and
[1:19:55] cast Into the Fire make firewood out of
[1:19:57] it see his message wasn't a clergyman at
[1:20:01] all it was after nature in the
[1:20:04] wilderness but he had the message to
[1:20:07] announce and had the faith in his
[1:20:10] message to say that Messiah is so close
[1:20:12] to coming so he's right here among you
[1:20:16] now I say unto you there's one standing
[1:20:18] in the midst of you you know not whose
[1:20:20] shoes I'm not worthy to Bear he'll
[1:20:22] baptize with the Holy Ghost in
[1:20:24] fire who is he John I don't know but one
[1:20:28] day there come a young man walking down
[1:20:30] to the river ordinary looking man just
[1:20:33] old John the Baptist was standing over
[1:20:36] there the Blessed old prophet and he
[1:20:38] looked across the Jordan he said behold
[1:20:41] there's a lamb of God that takes away
[1:20:43] the sin of the world how do you know
[1:20:44] know in John he in the wilderness that
[1:20:46] told me to go baptize the water said
[1:20:48] upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit
[1:20:50] descending he is the word that'll
[1:20:53] baptize with the Holy Ghost this message
[1:20:56] couldn't come from a theological
[1:20:58] standpoint or some man-made Creed system
[1:21:00] and had to come directly from
[1:21:03] God well his message didn't Shake him
[1:21:05] very much they thought oh he said he saw
[1:21:08] that I doubt it very much I didn't see
[1:21:09] nothing looked all my I couldn't see
[1:21:11] nothing about it the priest them said
[1:21:12] but he saw it and we know now he saw it
[1:21:16] sure it is but you notice what it got it
[1:21:19] never stirred them out of their sleep
[1:21:21] they went right on cut his head off is
[1:21:22] the same but it it never stirred them
[1:21:25] but it did get the remnant the one that
[1:21:28] had the life in them that little Bunch
[1:21:31] an and and Simeon and a few of those
[1:21:35] that were waiting all for the coming of
[1:21:38] the Lord and Anna in the temple blind a
[1:21:43] prophetes that serve the Lord by prayers
[1:21:46] and then one day when she was in the
[1:21:48] spirit and Simeon had prophesied and
[1:21:52] said old man he said the Holy Ghost told
[1:21:55] me that I will not see death until I see
[1:21:59] the Lord's
[1:22:00] Christ well some of the priests you know
[1:22:02] said poor old fell just a little off you
[1:22:04] know why he's got one foot in the grave
[1:22:06] now and he doesn't sleeping well just
[1:22:08] let him alone he's been an honorable old
[1:22:09] man but he's kind of but you see what
[1:22:11] did he have it was revealed to him by
[1:22:15] the Holy Ghost that's the same thing
[1:22:17] that is revealed to you people this
[1:22:19] afternoon the Holy Ghost brought you
[1:22:22] here for some reason the some the Holy
[1:22:25] Spirit look at these priests and clch
[1:22:27] and here from Methodist Baptist Catholic
[1:22:29] and all they was moved by the Holy Ghost
[1:22:32] the hours here so the Holy Ghost moved
[1:22:35] on them and they've been looking for it
[1:22:37] hungering then just in a one day they
[1:22:41] don't didn't have television thank the
[1:22:42] Lord for that day so they uh they was
[1:22:45] down up on the hillsides of Judea there
[1:22:48] was a a baby born a star appeared and so
[1:22:51] forth but after 8 Days the mother
[1:22:54] brought the little baby in wrapped in
[1:22:55] swatling cloth it's swatling cloth I'm
[1:22:58] telling told that was a they didn't have
[1:23:00] nothing to put on it it was a a little
[1:23:02] uh rag off of a yolk of an ox I'm told
[1:23:05] that was a swalling cloth here come
[1:23:08] Joseph and man coming in with this
[1:23:09] little baby Out imagine the mothers
[1:23:12] stood back from a distance with their
[1:23:13] little babies with needle work and
[1:23:15] everything said look at there see see
[1:23:17] there she is see she was pregnant but
[1:23:19] that man here she comes in De stay away
[1:23:21] from her keep your distance they still
[1:23:22] think the same thing but Mary with that
[1:23:26] baby in her arms it didn't make any
[1:23:29] difference what they thought she know
[1:23:31] whose son that was so is every believer
[1:23:34] that accepts God's word into their heart
[1:23:37] I don't care what the system say you
[1:23:39] know what it is but the promise of God
[1:23:42] it was revealed to you by the Holy Ghost
[1:23:45] when you were overshadowed with his to
[1:23:47] you know where it's at no man has a
[1:23:49] right to preach the gospel until he's
[1:23:51] met God back on the back side of the
[1:23:52] desert and that burning bush where
[1:23:55] there's no ecclesiastical system in the
[1:23:57] world can explain it away from you you
[1:23:59] were there it happened to you I don't
[1:24:01] care what the system say you are a
[1:24:04] witness of it
[1:24:06] Hallelujah I feel like that colored man
[1:24:09] I talking about I ain't got room up here
[1:24:10] now see I feel very religious at this
[1:24:13] time when I think that that's right God
[1:24:16] himself revealed to
[1:24:18] you Simeon had the promise sitting over
[1:24:21] in his study that morning
[1:24:23] well I guess there might have been
[1:24:24] several hundred babies brought in every
[1:24:25] morning about 2 and a half million Jews
[1:24:27] in the country these babies come in many
[1:24:30] born every eight days the mother had to
[1:24:32] come offer offering for purification now
[1:24:35] here come Simeon sitting there you know
[1:24:36] maybe reading the scroll of Isaiah I
[1:24:38] don't
[1:24:39] know but all at once now if the Holy
[1:24:42] Ghost has made you a
[1:24:44] promise the Holy Ghost has got to keep
[1:24:46] that promise if it's really God he if he
[1:24:50] if a man comes to you and says a certain
[1:24:51] thing God doesn't back it up it isn't
[1:24:53] scripture to begin with forget it and if
[1:24:55] he says it so and God still doesn't back
[1:24:57] it up it's still wrong because God
[1:24:59] interprets his message he's his own
[1:25:02] interpreter what he says comes to pass
[1:25:04] then God said hear it for it's the truth
[1:25:06] that's only common sense if he says it
[1:25:08] happens and it happens that tells it it
[1:25:10] must be every time exactly the truth
[1:25:12] because God don't tell lies and so man
[1:25:15] here Simon steing there taking the
[1:25:17] persecution he was the remnant he' heard
[1:25:19] John and the little remnant of that day
[1:25:21] and here he was was sitting there uh
[1:25:25] listening to this scroll knowing I mean
[1:25:26] knowing that John was coming because he
[1:25:28] he was part of the rim that the word was
[1:25:30] revealed to him and all at once when
[1:25:32] that baby come into the temple that was
[1:25:34] duty of the Holy Ghost to reveal that it
[1:25:36] was there so he moved by the Spirit come
[1:25:40] out of the little study room right down
[1:25:42] to the hall hit that line of women
[1:25:44] coming right down along that line of
[1:25:46] women until he got down to where this
[1:25:48] little baby was is all standing away
[1:25:50] from picked up the baby in his arms said
[1:25:53] Lord let your servant depart in peace
[1:25:56] for my eyes have seen your
[1:25:58] salvation and at that time another one
[1:26:01] of the little elected in that day was
[1:26:03] Anna a prophetess she's sitting over
[1:26:06] there blind in the corner raised up
[1:26:09] blind here she comes led by the spirit
[1:26:12] among all the women and the people
[1:26:14] crowding out the temple till she come
[1:26:16] right straight to where the Christ child
[1:26:18] was if the Holy Ghost could lead a blind
[1:26:21] woman him what about a Pentecostal group
[1:26:25] that's supposed to have your
[1:26:28] eyesight I won't go any further you know
[1:26:30] from there on notice oh my how that that
[1:26:36] church must have been in an awful mess
[1:26:39] again it surely must have been in that
[1:26:41] day but it rocked the little Remnant as
[1:26:44] it said now let's be honest if we see
[1:26:47] that church in that condition today
[1:26:49] haven't we arrived at that time again
[1:26:52] now just look at the things that promise
[1:26:55] of the Bible that would be going on in
[1:26:57] the church at this time we see what's
[1:26:59] going on in the world and we see it's at
[1:27:01] its end now let's look at the
[1:27:03] church she the
[1:27:05] church had birth pains under Luther now
[1:27:10] we know these seven Church agents and
[1:27:12] seven Messengers to them Church agents
[1:27:13] according to Revelations now when Luther
[1:27:16] had to come forth it certainly throw the
[1:27:18] church into birth pain but it brought
[1:27:20] forth the Luther that's right
[1:27:23] after that it got in trouble again so it
[1:27:24] brought forth a Wesley that's right got
[1:27:27] forth again and it brought forth a
[1:27:29] Pentecost each of them messengers of
[1:27:32] their age Rock the back to the word the
[1:27:36] message of their age the message of
[1:27:39] according to the Bible I've got come in
[1:27:41] a book out on that the commentary the
[1:27:42] first four chapters of Revelations read
[1:27:44] it soon as we get it on press and it
[1:27:47] proves beyond a shadow of Doubt what
[1:27:48] Luther's message was justification what
[1:27:51] uh sanctification is the next process in
[1:27:53] the natural birth and then come the
[1:27:55] Pentecostals exactly now notice each age
[1:28:00] Rock the church and give it birth pains
[1:28:02] but what did they do after the birth
[1:28:04] Pains come instead of going on with the
[1:28:06] word they got a bunch of man together
[1:28:08] just like the first one did exactly
[1:28:11] right after the rocking of the apostles
[1:28:13] then we find her going off again then we
[1:28:15] find out Along come uh uh many of the
[1:28:17] others activist and many of the Great
[1:28:19] reformers back in the beginning each age
[1:28:22] done as you studied in PR Council and ni
[1:28:24] fathers all back you find it all in
[1:28:26] there each age was rocked every time a
[1:28:28] messenger come forth with thus sayeth
[1:28:30] the Lord now she is in the worst stage
[1:28:34] that according to the scripture that
[1:28:37] she's ever been amen we are in the lady
[1:28:40] oan Church age a rich but blinded Church
[1:28:45] age that don't know
[1:28:47] it there wasn't nowh in the Bible that
[1:28:50] Christ was ever put out of the church
[1:28:52] but the lady of sea age she's in the
[1:28:55] worst age she's the rottenest she ever
[1:28:56] was said I said do Queen have need of
[1:28:58] nothing and don't know that you're naked
[1:29:00] miserable blind poor and don't know it
[1:29:03] yes sir so I counsel thee come by I say
[1:29:06] for me that I might open your eyes and
[1:29:09] that'll that'll certainly the eyes save
[1:29:12] of God will certainly bring light to the
[1:29:14] church if it wants to open its eyes to
[1:29:15] what God has said notice quickly now now
[1:29:19] she is in that stage Beyond a out of
[1:29:22] doubt we're in the lady of sea church
[1:29:24] age now her messenger is Promised in
[1:29:27] Malachi the 4th chapter he's promised to
[1:29:29] do it and the message is to bring back
[1:29:33] the word bring the people back to the
[1:29:35] word birth is to be she's to be
[1:29:38] delivered of a new birth from According
[1:29:41] to Malachi 4 in the church world today
[1:29:44] there is two systems of work and now
[1:29:46] listen read your
[1:29:49] clo now see if you going to say Amen on
[1:29:51] this this there's two systems working in
[1:29:55] the church world today I'm going to get
[1:29:58] this off my shoulder and then I have it
[1:29:59] over with we all know that that's the
[1:30:03] word of God and the denominational
[1:30:06] system there is the two systems that
[1:30:09] work just as it was Jacob and Esau one
[1:30:14] after the spirit the other after the
[1:30:15] Flesh and what is it Esau and Jacob was
[1:30:19] fighting in the woms of the mother
[1:30:22] even to the time they were born and so
[1:30:25] is the
[1:30:26] denominational and the word fighting one
[1:30:29] against the other they have been since
[1:30:30] Luther first brought the First
[1:30:32] Reformation I hope that's simple enough
[1:30:34] that you can understand it these men if
[1:30:37] they pick up this and go out with it
[1:30:39] they can make more sense to it see to
[1:30:41] bring it to a place you would I just
[1:30:42] want to lay this seat hope they make it
[1:30:45] come to life notice see it's always been
[1:30:48] that that's the reason she's bearing
[1:30:50] birth pains because her there's a fight
[1:30:52] in her there's the Esau just the man of
[1:30:55] the world very religious and uh oh he's
[1:30:58] all right good fell clean moral as far
[1:31:01] as know but he don't know nothing about
[1:31:03] that
[1:31:04] Birthright he's born that way he's
[1:31:06] shaped that way and Jacob I don't care
[1:31:10] what he is he wants that Birthright he's
[1:31:13] the spiritual one and them two today is
[1:31:16] in the womb of the church there's a
[1:31:19] great big system trying to be formed
[1:31:21] called a world Council of churches and
[1:31:23] from the womb of the church is coming
[1:31:25] forth two children you just weren't my
[1:31:28] word the
[1:31:30] world the world word must
[1:31:34] deliver the word bride
[1:31:37] church the church has got to be
[1:31:40] delivered out of her a bride for Christ
[1:31:43] damn it fell asleep in all ages or make
[1:31:46] up that bride that come out on the word
[1:31:48] that they come out on like from your
[1:31:50] feet coming to your head
[1:31:52] she gets get greater and more you have
[1:31:54] to have and so forth as the body grows
[1:31:57] up so does the body of Christ grow up
[1:31:59] and then finally the head will come to
[1:32:01] it the head of it will now if we know
[1:32:04] it's C it's it's all linked to the head
[1:32:06] the head does a turning pulling but
[1:32:08] these systems will not grow out of that
[1:32:11] because it's a system and it cannot
[1:32:13] bring forth a cuckle BG cannot bring
[1:32:16] forth a bunch of wheat but they're both
[1:32:18] in the same field watered by the same
[1:32:21] water and the same
[1:32:23] sunlight one is the word one is not the
[1:32:26] word them two are fighting they've been
[1:32:29] fighting since the first reformation and
[1:32:30] they're still
[1:32:32] fighting now I don't have go any further
[1:32:34] on that do surely you know what I'm
[1:32:36] talking about there we are there you are
[1:32:39] system what system are you
[1:32:41] in just imagine now if you would have
[1:32:44] lived back in the other days under the
[1:32:46] Jing of God's prophets and words that
[1:32:48] come forth what side would you want to
[1:32:49] be on back there well you got the same
[1:32:51] Choice today she speaks to bring forth
[1:32:54] the perfect word back there and the
[1:32:55] words coming for the word Bride As a a
[1:32:58] woman is a part of a man taken from him
[1:33:01] so the church will have to be a word
[1:33:04] abiding church every word of the Bible
[1:33:08] not systems dogmas or nothing added to
[1:33:10] it it will have to be an unadulterated
[1:33:12] pure virgent
[1:33:14] word right in the days of the lot of
[1:33:17] Luther when the church B that Luther for
[1:33:19] you one under her pains but he come
[1:33:21] forth to shall live by faith this is not
[1:33:24] the
[1:33:25] communion now we find out under the days
[1:33:28] of John Wesley she gave pains again but
[1:33:30] there there's a Wesley
[1:33:32] barn but what did he do went right back
[1:33:35] like mother did and on the days of
[1:33:38] Pentecost was your father's mothers come
[1:33:40] out of that thing and hated it they went
[1:33:43] out on the street your mother with no
[1:33:44] stockings on that beating on an old tin
[1:33:46] Cannon talking about the baptism of the
[1:33:48] Holy Ghost and some old guitar they L
[1:33:50] out on the street cars TR stayed all
[1:33:52] night in jail and we were so starchy and
[1:33:55] went right back into an organization and
[1:33:57] made oursel the same muck that draw
[1:33:59] their children back then if they come
[1:34:00] out of they turn over in the grave
[1:34:03] they'd be ashamed of you I know that's
[1:34:06] hard but it's the truth you say I
[1:34:08] thought you love people if love isn't
[1:34:10] corrected then how can you produce love
[1:34:14] love is corrective and I do love the
[1:34:16] world I'm I'm zealous of God's church
[1:34:20] and to see these systems that binding it
[1:34:22] down on her dogmas and it's rotting it
[1:34:24] away God declaring his word to be the
[1:34:26] truth and still they hold on to
[1:34:28] it amen that's true you know it's the
[1:34:31] truth brother sister that's just that's
[1:34:34] a simple way of telling you it isn't a
[1:34:36] breaking down of Greek and things but
[1:34:38] it's the breaking down showing Common
[1:34:40] Sense surely you can understand that two
[1:34:42] and two is four see now we know that
[1:34:46] that's right now the word must produce
[1:34:50] the bride but but the old system has to
[1:34:53] keep its type it has to produce an
[1:34:56] Esau who sold his birthrights here it
[1:35:00] comes I feel
[1:35:02] it I hope you don't think I'm crazy well
[1:35:05] if I am let me alone I feel good this
[1:35:07] way I'm better this way than I was the
[1:35:09] other way I maybe to the I know where
[1:35:13] I'm at I know where I'm
[1:35:16] standing look it's going to produce a
[1:35:20] stillborn baby
[1:35:23] an ecclesiastical system is going to
[1:35:25] bring all the denominations together to
[1:35:27] produce a
[1:35:29] Esau that hates
[1:35:32] Jacob
[1:35:34] amen I hope you see it a still born dead
[1:35:39] denomination all of them going
[1:35:41] together
[1:35:43] oh word
[1:35:45] Believers give into my
[1:35:48] message hear me not my message but his
[1:35:52] message that he firmly declares to be
[1:35:54] the truth you've got to choose from
[1:35:56] somewhere you can't sit still after this
[1:35:59] You' got to make your choice remember
[1:36:01] the other day down to Westford hole
[1:36:03] there on that morning on that breakfast
[1:36:05] how the Lord let me show that wheat hats
[1:36:07] come up through Luther do Wes the tosel
[1:36:10] and so forth and little springs off
[1:36:11] every Church represent in a stock of
[1:36:13] corn then went right down into that
[1:36:15] wheat as it was and there was that
[1:36:16] little sh looked just exactly like the
[1:36:19] real grain of wheat when you go out and
[1:36:21] look at you don't know your wheat you'll
[1:36:22] say you got wheat there but it's just a
[1:36:24] Shu then you open that Shu up there's no
[1:36:26] wheat there at all way back as a little
[1:36:28] bud of Life coming forth you take a
[1:36:30] glass and look at it and when Pentecost
[1:36:32] first come out it was so close Jesus
[1:36:34] said in Matthew 24:24 it would deceive
[1:36:37] the very elected if it was possible what
[1:36:40] was it to do a support to the grain is
[1:36:43] that right now the tossel look here the
[1:36:45] blade doesn't look like the grain that
[1:36:47] went in neither does the tossle but it's
[1:36:49] a little more like it and the shook is a
[1:36:50] whole not like it but still it ain't the
[1:36:52] wheat it's a carrier of the wheat don't
[1:36:55] you see how those messages has come with
[1:36:57] birth pains but the life left right out
[1:36:59] there to go to the next message the life
[1:37:01] went right out of Luther into Wesley's
[1:37:03] message right out of Wesley's message
[1:37:04] into Pentecostal message now it's time
[1:37:07] again to leave the shook what's the
[1:37:10] matter there's nature in every form
[1:37:13] declaring that's a true now you see why
[1:37:16] you think I'm crazy maybe I am as I said
[1:37:19] but there's something in me I can't stop
[1:37:22] it I never put it there it never come to
[1:37:26] my own choosing it's God and he confirms
[1:37:28] it to prove that it's the truth to make
[1:37:31] it the truth not as I have anything
[1:37:33] against Lutheran Wesley Pentecostals or
[1:37:35] Baptist or whoever nothing against
[1:37:37] nobody the systems is what I'm against
[1:37:40] because the words against it not the man
[1:37:43] look at these priests and cl been
[1:37:45] sitting here today they wouldn't be here
[1:37:47] if they listen to the system but they
[1:37:48] had the common audocity of the word of
[1:37:50] God to to step out and accept it
[1:37:53] Hallelujah Hall means praise our god it
[1:37:57] won't hurt
[1:37:58] you mean so be it I believe
[1:38:01] it I believe and know that it's the
[1:38:04] truth it's confirmed to be the truth
[1:38:07] someday you find out maybe too late now
[1:38:11] watch watch the Bible said his wife has
[1:38:16] made herself ready at the End of the Age
[1:38:18] how did she make herself ready to
[1:38:20] becoming his wife and what did what kind
[1:38:22] of garment she had on his own words she
[1:38:24] was dressed in his righteousness that's
[1:38:26] what his right See Vision notice just
[1:38:30] closing I want to say this one thing
[1:38:32] just before
[1:38:33] closing that's what led me to say
[1:38:36] this thus sayith the Lord a man would
[1:38:41] say that without putting it in his own
[1:38:44] thinking he'd be a hypocrite and should
[1:38:46] go to hell for right if he'd try to get
[1:38:49] a bunch of people find people like this
[1:38:51] and deceive him why he'd be a devil in
[1:38:54] human
[1:38:55] flesh God would never honor him you
[1:38:57] think God would honor a devil or a lie
[1:39:01] never see it goes over the top of their
[1:39:03] heads and they don't get it he pulls the
[1:39:06] elected out look at all the prophets
[1:39:08] through the age how he got the elected
[1:39:10] look coming down through even to the
[1:39:12] Reformation like uh the Roman Catholic
[1:39:14] Church burnt Jon of AR to a stake for
[1:39:16] being a
[1:39:17] witch that's right later on they found
[1:39:20] out she wasn't she was the saint of
[1:39:23] course they done pen dig up priest body
[1:39:24] and throw them in the river but you know
[1:39:26] but that don't sett it in the books of
[1:39:28] God Amen no they call St Patrick one too
[1:39:32] you see and he's by as much as I am one
[1:39:35] so we notice look at his children look
[1:39:37] at his place up like how many killed
[1:39:38] look on the mology and see how many was
[1:39:40] killed there you see it isn't so but the
[1:39:44] claim of the people that doesn't make it
[1:39:45] so it's what God Said and proves that is
[1:39:48] truth prove all things hope fast to that
[1:39:51] which is good now we find out here about
[1:39:55] a a few months ago one
[1:39:58] morning I was walking out of the house
[1:40:00] and a vision came and I challenge
[1:40:03] anybody here that snowed all these years
[1:40:05] to say at any time that the Lord ever
[1:40:08] let me say thus sayth the Lord by what
[1:40:09] had happened how many knows this the
[1:40:11] truth raise your
[1:40:13] hand could anybody speak
[1:40:18] contrary it's true don't paying
[1:40:21] attention to the messenger look at the
[1:40:23] message you did that's what it is it
[1:40:25] isn't that don't notice the
[1:40:29] little baldheaded you know person
[1:40:31] because it's just a it's just a human
[1:40:33] being and we're just all the same but
[1:40:36] watch what's happening that's what
[1:40:37] declares
[1:40:39] it I was taken now I know people say all
[1:40:42] kinds of things and we know that a lot
[1:40:44] of it's not right I can't answer for
[1:40:46] what any man says I got to answer what I
[1:40:48] said and I can only say whether it's
[1:40:50] truth or not and I I I'm the one that
[1:40:52] has to be responsible for it not what
[1:40:53] somebody else says I can't judge no one
[1:40:55] I wasn't sent to judge but to preach the
[1:40:58] message notice I was to have a a preview
[1:41:03] of the church and I was taken by someone
[1:41:06] who I could not see and was set up on
[1:41:09] like a stand and I heard the sweetest
[1:41:12] music I ever heard and I look coming and
[1:41:16] a bunch of little ladies about look to
[1:41:19] be of all some age around 20 18 20 and
[1:41:23] they all had long hair and was fixed in
[1:41:25] different dresses type dresses and they
[1:41:28] were marching just as perfectly in step
[1:41:30] of that music as it could be and he went
[1:41:32] from my left going around this way and I
[1:41:35] watched him and I looked in to see who
[1:41:36] was talking to me and I couldn't see no
[1:41:38] one then I heard a rock and roll band
[1:41:42] coming and when I looked over to my
[1:41:44] right side coming up this way coming
[1:41:46] back here come the churches of the world
[1:41:51] and some of the each one carrying their
[1:41:53] Banner from where they were from some of
[1:41:56] the dirtiest looking things I ever seen
[1:41:58] in my life and when the American Church
[1:42:01] come up it was the awest I ever seen the
[1:42:06] heavenly father is my judge they had on
[1:42:09] these tattletail gray skirts like one of
[1:42:13] these barroom girls with no back on it
[1:42:16] up here holding up like a gray looking
[1:42:17] piece of paper and like hoola dancing
[1:42:21] paint short bobbed hair smoking
[1:42:24] cigarettes and twisting as they walked
[1:42:26] to rock and roll and I said is that the
[1:42:30] Church of the United States and the
[1:42:32] voice said yes it is and when they
[1:42:34] passed by they had to hold it like this
[1:42:36] and put the paper behind them when they
[1:42:39] passed by I I started to cry I just
[1:42:42] thought of all my labor and all that
[1:42:44] I've done and everything that we
[1:42:45] ministers has worked together and
[1:42:47] brother I I don't know how much you
[1:42:49] believe about these Visions but it's
[1:42:50] truth to me it's always proved to be
[1:42:53] true when I seen that annoying what was
[1:42:55] going on my heart like to broke in me
[1:42:57] what have I done how I miss could have
[1:42:59] stayed right with the word Lord and how
[1:43:01] could have done I thought why could you
[1:43:03] give me a vision not Longo and see me in
[1:43:05] there and I said well will they had to
[1:43:07] be judged he said Paul's group too I
[1:43:08] said I preached the same word he did
[1:43:11] Christian businessman carried the
[1:43:12] article of it and I said why why would
[1:43:16] it be like this and I seen that bunch of
[1:43:18] prostitutes going by like that all
[1:43:20] dressed up like that and call the church
[1:43:22] of Miss
[1:43:23] USA now I just painting and directly I
[1:43:26] heard that real sweet music come again
[1:43:28] and here come that same little bride
[1:43:31] coming by again he said this is what
[1:43:33] comes out of and when she walked by
[1:43:36] she's exactly like the one was in the
[1:43:38] first place walking to the step of the
[1:43:41] music of God's word marching on by and
[1:43:44] went out of sight I stood there with
[1:43:46] both hands up crying like that want to
[1:43:47] come to I stand on my porch out there
[1:43:49] looking around across the feet
[1:43:52] what she's to be the same bride the same
[1:43:56] kind build out the same kind of material
[1:43:59] that she was in the first place now read
[1:44:01] Malachi 4 and see if we're not supposed
[1:44:05] to have a message in the last days
[1:44:07] that'll turn the hearts of the children
[1:44:10] back to the fathers back to the original
[1:44:13] Pentecostal message word by word
[1:44:16] Brothers we are here now this church is
[1:44:19] supposed to get us sign and it's last
[1:44:22] sign we find out here in the in the in
[1:44:25] the scripture see now see the great
[1:44:28] birth pains has been in this lady of sin
[1:44:30] age it's boring their church is being
[1:44:32] born again not there'll never be another
[1:44:35] organization anyone knows that every
[1:44:37] time a message went forth ask these
[1:44:39] historians after a message went forth an
[1:44:41] organization come up out of it oh
[1:44:43] Alexander camel everything else Martin
[1:44:46] Luther and everything they made an
[1:44:48] organization out of it and usually uh
[1:44:50] message only goes for about three years
[1:44:53] of Revival this has been going for 15
[1:44:56] years and there's been no organization
[1:44:58] come from it why the Shu was the
[1:45:04] last we're at the
[1:45:06] end see the birth pains see what's the
[1:45:10] matter just the remnant will be brought
[1:45:12] out just the remnant will be brought out
[1:45:16] that's why I'm crying and straining and
[1:45:18] pushing and lay aside ever favor of man
[1:45:21] on Earth to find favor with God and just
[1:45:23] moving on in his word she's in pain
[1:45:26] that's what's the matter she's going to
[1:45:27] give birth she must make her choice the
[1:45:31] handwriting is on the wall we see the
[1:45:34] Earth is just about ready to
[1:45:36] go that's right and we see the church
[1:45:39] she's so rotten she's about ready to go
[1:45:42] and the birth pains is on all of it on
[1:45:44] both the world and the church and
[1:45:46] there's about to be a new world born and
[1:45:48] a new church born to go to it for the
[1:45:50] Millennium we know that look God gives
[1:45:54] her and listen to this post now I'm
[1:45:56] closing her final sign her final message
[1:46:01] her final
[1:46:03] sign her final sign is she has to get
[1:46:06] the conditions like she was at the
[1:46:07] beginning the world the church look how
[1:46:09] it was in the beginning all them years
[1:46:11] without from Malachi until Jesus look at
[1:46:15] it all the years now look at it all back
[1:46:18] in there with corruption that got into
[1:46:20] it look at the Earth how it was on each
[1:46:21] time like days of Noah so forth has to
[1:46:24] be in the same kind of a type and we see
[1:46:25] that as it was in the days of Noah we
[1:46:27] see all these things just pattering up
[1:46:29] then we get one final in Luke the 17th
[1:46:32] chapter the 28th verse Jesus said as it
[1:46:36] was in the days of
[1:46:38] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:46:42] the son of
[1:46:43] man or as it was in s see now Jesus read
[1:46:48] this same Bible the same Genesis we read
[1:46:51] out close don't miss it the same Bible
[1:46:55] we read Jesus read and he said to his
[1:46:59] church look back and see when the days
[1:47:02] of Sodom returns again perverted
[1:47:05] people man losing their natural look at
[1:47:08] the homosexual how it's on the increase
[1:47:10] across the world today and newspaper
[1:47:13] just reads if you already get my office
[1:47:14] and read letters from mothers for their
[1:47:16] boys and homosexual is in the increase
[1:47:18] of I think it's 20 or 30 % in California
[1:47:21] alone over last
[1:47:23] year a great bunch of the of even
[1:47:26] government people has proven to be hom
[1:47:28] sexuals you government man know that
[1:47:31] your magazine or read
[1:47:34] it and in the
[1:47:38] different things that's taking place if

[1:48:34] y to him and for the of living for the
[1:48:40] land

[1:49:00] message for the almighty God the god of
[1:49:04] Abram the god of is God of Jacob
[1:49:09] witnesses witnesses the message that
[1:49:13] done
[1:49:14] [Music]
[1:49:17] for I have the right understanding of
[1:49:20] the scripture that's exactly what God
[1:49:23] Said would take place that him who
[1:49:25] speaketh the tongue also pray that he
[1:49:26] may interpret that' be true I've told
[1:49:29] you truth then God's here confirming it
[1:49:32] it's the truth that's true now look what
[1:49:34] was that last
[1:49:49] message
[1:49:55] and the church says amen God bless you
[1:49:58] tonight church it's would sure be easy
[1:50:01] for me tonight to say that was 1965 and
[1:50:04] that was those denominations and that
[1:50:06] was you know not for our day but let us
[1:50:09] not think that but let us there's he
[1:50:11] said two
[1:50:13] systems church and there's the true and
[1:50:16] the false there's the denominations and
[1:50:18] then there's the he called it the word
[1:50:21] bride Church there we know time is short
[1:50:24] we want to be on the right side of
[1:50:26] things he's talking about those birth
[1:50:28] pains and contractions in Russia and
[1:50:30] Israel we see those things timing and
[1:50:34] quicker and Qui quicker he says we're at
[1:50:36] the end I know we don't doubt that we
[1:50:38] believe that so let us get ready the
[1:50:41] wife his bride has made herself ready by
[1:50:43] his righteousness amen so we sure
[1:50:46] appreciate you we sure appreciate each

[1:51:01] brother John but maybe you could help us
[1:51:02] close out if that would be okay there's
[1:51:04] a a quote there in the bulletin I think

[1:51:08] upon one another and those things so
[1:51:10] we'll do that if we could we'll sing a
[1:51:12] little bit and then let John close us
