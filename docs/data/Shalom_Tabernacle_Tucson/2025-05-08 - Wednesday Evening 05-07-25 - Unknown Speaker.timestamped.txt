[3:57] made
[4:02] victorious through the blood. Let's
[4:06] stand. God bless you all. Let's stand
[4:07] and sing that one more time. Oh, we've
[4:11] been made more than
[4:18] coner
[4:20] over in this
[4:25] life. We've been
[4:28] made
[4:33] victorious through the blood of Jesus
[4:37] Christ.
[4:41] God bless you all. Welcome to Wednesday
[4:43] night's service. Good to see you
[4:45] all. I'd like to read a scripture this
[4:49] evening. Ephesians number one verse 5.
[4:53] says, "Having predestinated us unto the
[4:56] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[4:59] himself, according to the good pleasure
[5:02] of his will, to the praises of the glory
[5:05] of his grace, wherein we he hath made us
[5:10] accepted in the beloved." God bless you.
[5:15] Brother John, would you be able to open
[5:17] service with prayer, please?
[5:20] [Music]
[5:28] Let's bow our heads. Thank you, Lord,
[5:29] for your goodness and faithfulness to
[5:31] us. And Lord, the privilege that we have
[5:34] that we too often take for granted to be
[5:37] able to come into your house and worship
[5:39] you and have a place where we have the
[5:42] liberty to worship you in spirit and in
[5:44] truth. And and Lord, we just want to
[5:47] take full advantage of these
[5:49] opportunities. and we come together this
[5:51] evening, Lord, we appreciate the
[5:54] fellowship with our brothers and
[5:56] sisters, but we also, Lord, more
[5:58] importantly, and the reason we're here,
[6:01] Lord, is just to draw closer to you. And
[6:04] Lord, we just ask that you would speak
[6:05] to us tonight through your word. That
[6:07] you would just draw us closer to you.
[6:09] Show us, Lord, where the areas that
[6:10] we're falling short. And and Lord, I
[6:13] believe it's each of our desire this
[6:14] evening to draw closer to you. and and
[6:17] Lord, just help us to die out to
[6:19] ourselves and not hold on to anything
[6:22] that's unpleasing to you. Ask you
[6:24] forgive us, Lord, for our shortcomings.
[6:26] And uh Lord, we just commit this service
[6:29] into your hands and ask that your
[6:30] perfect will would be done. We pray in
[6:32] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Thank you,
[6:35] brother
[6:36] John. We'd like to welcome you all once
[6:39] again to Shalom Tabernacle and those

[6:44] him?

[7:53] the temple there. One day he cried, "Oh
[7:57] Lord, be merciful to

[8:46] The dumb was made to talk. The power was
[8:51] spoken with love upon the
[8:55] sea. The blind was made to
[8:59] see. I know it could only be that mercy
[9:05] of that man from let's sing that other
[9:08] verse, the fourth verse. Oh, Nicodemus
[9:11] came by night to know the way of right.
[9:16] He asked the son of God, "What must he
[9:23] do?" For he said to him, "He must be
[9:28] born again by the spirit of that man
[9:32] from
[9:35] Galilee." Oh, I love that man from
[9:40] Galilee.

[19:26] On a
[19:28] hill far
[19:31] away stood an
[19:34] old rugged
[19:38] cross, the
[19:40] emblem of

[20:32] I will
[20:34] cling to the old
[20:38] rugged
[20:42] cross and
[20:45] exchange it someday for a crown.
[20:53] Oh, that
[20:55] old rugged cross.

[23:07] Ephesians chapter 1. We like to turn
[23:10] there. We're going to be starting the
[23:12] adoption series and I know that'll be a
[23:15] blessing to you. We'll listen to a
[23:18] portion of that to paragraph I believe I
[23:21] gave it in the back there. You all got
[23:22] that note right? Good. Thank you. And uh
[23:25] about 45 minutes or
[23:27] so. These are the messages that actually
[23:31] place the believer and give us a solid
[23:34] stand in the word of God. Amen.
[23:37] So when you get that uh scripture you
[23:40] can say amen. Ephesians chapter
[23:42] 1 verse number three.
[23:47] Blessed be the Lord God of our father,
[23:49] the Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed
[23:52] us with all spiritual blessings in
[23:56] heavenly places in
[23:58] Christ, according as he hath chosen us
[24:01] in him before the foundation of the
[24:05] world, that we should be holy and
[24:08] without blame before him in love, having
[24:12] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[24:14] children by Jesus Christ to himself,
[24:18] according to the good pleasure of his
[24:20] will, to the praise of the glory of his
[24:24] grace, wherein he hath made us accepted
[24:27] in the beloved, and whom we have
[24:30] redemption through his blood, the
[24:32] forgiveness of sins, according to the
[24:36] riches of his grace, wherein he us
[24:46] will according
[24:57] that in the
[25:02] [Music]
[25:05] disposition
[25:08] heaven
[25:11] earth also we have
[25:15] and
[25:16] inheritance being
[25:19] [Music]
[25:24] perfect. Thank you. Verse 11. In
[25:28] whom also we have obtained an
[25:31] inheritance. Someone say inheritance.
[25:34] Inheritance. being
[25:37] predestinated according to the purpose
[25:40] of him who workketh all things after the
[25:43] counsel of his own will that we should
[25:47] be
[25:49] um that we should be to the praise of
[25:52] his glory who first trusted in Christ.
[25:55] And so as we prepare to listen to this
[25:57] message um the adoption series as we
[26:00] start that let's sing only believe.
[26:02] Amen. Aren't you happy to be here
[26:04] tonight?
[26:06] Amen. This is a format that it comes in.
[26:08] If you can if you don't have that, we
[26:10] can get a copy. I think most people have
[26:12] this. We've done this before and I know
[26:14] it'll be a blessing to you again.
[26:18] Only
[26:19] [Music]
[26:22] believe.
[26:24] Only
[26:27] believe that all things are
[26:34] possible.
[26:35] Only
[26:39] believe.
[26:41] Only believe.
[26:47] Only
[26:51] believe all things are
[26:57] possible only. Let's lift our hands and
[27:01] say, "Lord, I believe." A
[27:03] confession.
[27:05] Lord, I
[27:09] believe.
[27:11] Lord, I
[27:15] believe that all things are
[27:21] possible. Lord, I
[27:27] believe.
[27:29] Lord, I
[27:33] believe.
[27:35] Lord, I believe.
[27:40] All things are
[27:45] possible Lord
[27:49] I bless you may be seated brother
[27:52] Brandham
[27:57] you feel good
[28:03] well it's always as I've said before I
[28:06] was happy when this said unto Let us go
[28:09] into the house of the Lord. I believe
[28:12] David made that statement once. Let us
[28:15] go into the house of the Lord. I don't
[28:18] know any better place to be to you than
[28:20] in the house of the Lord. Amen. Now,
[28:24] tonight we are got some friends here
[28:28] that's all the way from Georgia and
[28:30] they'll probably be driving down after
[28:32] after the lunch tonight. And then we
[28:35] will some of them from way down. I hope
[28:39] you stay
[28:40] over and what rooms we got is open to
[28:44] you.
[28:46] And then Wednesday night we'll continue
[28:50] on on the study and then the Lord
[28:52] willing next Sunday again and then
[28:55] Shitakqua begins on the 6. So all that's
[28:59] got your vacations planned, we're
[29:01] expecting a great wonderful time. Amen.
[29:05] At the Shiakqua, there's where we always
[29:08] have such a marvelous
[29:10] time. Not too big a crowds. We run
[29:13] sometimes it'll hold up to about I
[29:16] suppose we could put 10,000 in it easy.
[29:19] But usually last year I think we had
[29:21] around about
[29:23] 7,000 something like that was a packed
[29:25] out place. But there's plenty of room to
[29:28] stand and seats that they could run all
[29:30] the way out.
[29:32] And uh so we are looking forward to
[29:36] that and glad to see many of our
[29:39] minister brothers and
[29:42] uh can't ever think of his name here.
[29:44] Missionary brother Humes and sister
[29:48] Humes is that you sitting right here?
[29:50] The little ones we're glad to have. I am
[29:52] a missionary and other ones brother
[29:57] Pat Dalton and all just so many. Brother
[30:01] Beer and seen brother Collins just a few
[30:04] moments ago
[30:06] and oh it' be kind of hard to call them
[30:08] all but we are very happy to have you in
[30:11] the house of the Lord
[30:13] tonight. This great precious brother
[30:17] Neville sitting behind me here to pray
[30:19] with me while we are going to teach the
[30:21] word. Charlie, glad to see you and
[30:23] sister Nelly here tonight, the little
[30:26] ones.
[30:28] This is and Bible teaching is usually a
[30:32] very Yes, brother Welch. I just was
[30:35] looking for you. I see you sitting back
[30:36] there
[30:40] now. Bible teaching is usually a little
[30:44] treacherous, a little, you know, kind of
[30:47] walking out on the thin ice we call it.
[30:50] But we just feel that maybe at this
[30:55] point and at this time it might be good
[30:58] to kind of bring the the church to what
[31:03] I think to a a complete
[31:07] uh understanding positionally of what we
[31:10] are in Christ Jesus. Amen. And sometimes
[31:15] I think that preaching is a wonderful
[31:18] thing. But I believe sometimes, brother
[31:21] Beer, that teaching goes beyond that.
[31:25] Amen. It kindly especially to the
[31:28] church. Now preaching usually catches
[31:31] the sinner, brings him under
[31:34] condemnation by the word, but teaching
[31:39] places the man positionally what he is.
[31:44] And we can never rightly be able to have
[31:48] faith until positionally we know what we
[31:52] are. Amen. Now, if the United States of
[31:57] this fair land here sent me over to
[32:00] Russia as an
[32:03] ambassador of this nation to
[32:05] Russia, then if they have officially
[32:10] sent me to Russia, all the power that
[32:14] the United States has is behind me. My
[32:18] word is just the same as the United
[32:20] States. If I have been recognized as an
[32:24] ambassador. Amen. And then if God has
[32:28] sent us to be his
[32:30] ambassadors, all the power that's in
[32:34] heaven, all that God
[32:37] is, all of his angels and all of his
[32:42] power stands behind our words. Amen. If
[32:45] we are correctly and
[32:49] ordained sent messengers to the people,
[32:53] God has to honor the
[32:56] word. For he has so solemnly
[32:59] written that whatever you bind on earth,
[33:03] that will I bind in
[33:06] heaven. Whatever you loose on earth,
[33:09] that will I loose in heaven.
[33:13] I give unto thee the keys to the
[33:16] kingdom. All such great promises he's
[33:19] given the
[33:22] church. And I am after the other day of
[33:26] many of you I suppose are here this
[33:28] morning to hear as I tried to in my
[33:33] humble simple way to explain the the
[33:37] vision that I saw of heaven.
[33:43] I would by no means ever try to doubt
[33:46] anything that anyone ever told me that
[33:48] God told
[33:50] them. I believe it even if I didn't see
[33:53] it in the scripture, I would still uh
[33:56] want to believe that brother's
[33:58] word. Uh, I might just stay right along
[34:01] with the Bible, but still I would
[34:03] believe that maybe brother had just
[34:04] misunderstood in it some way that he
[34:07] might have just got it mixed up a
[34:10] little. And still I would believe he he
[34:13] to be my
[34:15] brother. And if there's anything that
[34:17] burns within my
[34:19] heart and I hope it never leaves in my
[34:22] years to come that I'll never forget
[34:25] what happened last Sunday morning as a
[34:27] week.
[34:29] Amen. It has done something to me that's
[34:32] revolutionized my life.
[34:36] I I do not fear. I I have not one fear
[34:40] of death.
[34:42] Death has no fear at all. And it doesn't
[34:47] for you if you just understood.
[34:51] Now maybe if you'd have to have the
[34:54] experience to know it because there's no
[34:57] way to explain it, you cannot find words
[35:01] because it doesn't lay in the English uh
[35:06] dictionary
[35:07] or no other
[35:09] dictionary because it's in an
[35:13] eternity. No yesterday, no tomorrow.
[35:17] It's all present tense.
[35:21] And it's no uh I feel pretty good and an
[35:25] hour from now I don't feel so well and
[35:27] another hour I feel good again. It's
[35:30] present tense all the time.
[35:34] Never a cease. Just that
[35:37] glorious
[35:39] peace
[35:41] something and there can be no sin. There
[35:44] could be no jealousy. There could be no
[35:46] sickness there. There could be nothing
[35:48] ever reach that heavenly shore. Thank
[35:51] you, Lord. And if I may have the
[35:55] privilege of saying this, which maybe I
[35:58] do not, if I do not, then I pray God
[36:00] forgive
[36:01] me. But if I have the privilege, and it
[36:05] was that God let me be caught
[36:09] up to see something, I would refer to
[36:13] the first heavens.
[36:16] And then I believe one in the Bible by
[36:19] the name I believe it was Paul that was
[36:22] caught up into the third heavens.
[36:27] And if it was this glorious in the first
[36:30] heavens what does that third heavens
[36:33] hold?
[36:37] No wonder he couldn't speak of it for 14
[36:39] years.
[36:41] He said he did not know whether he was
[36:43] in body or out of body.
[36:47] with that great apostle, not to share
[36:50] his his his office or not to try to make
[36:56] ourselves anything like he
[36:59] was. But I can say with him, I don't
[37:02] know whether it was in this body or out
[37:05] of the body. Only thing it would just as
[37:08] real as I'm looking at
[37:10] you and I've always wondered
[37:13] about if I'd passed by I'd see a little
[37:18] cloud floating by a spirit and say there
[37:20] goes brother and sister that's Charlie
[37:23] and
[37:24] Nelly that's brother and sister Spencer
[37:26] going
[37:28] there that always puzzle me if my eyes
[37:32] is in the grave a decay
[37:38] rottening. If my ears is not here to
[37:41] hear
[37:42] anymore, and if my blood is all gone
[37:46] back and they've been bombed it and it's
[37:48] in the waters or in the ground and my
[37:53] mental faculties, my brain cells are all
[37:57] gone. Then how would I be any more than
[38:00] just a spirit floating
[38:02] around? that wearied me. How would I
[38:06] like to say hello, brother Pat? Oh, so
[38:10] glad to see you. Hello, brother Neville.
[38:14] How would like to see you? But I
[38:17] thought, well, if I don't have anything
[38:19] to see with, any mouth to speak with,
[38:23] it's rotten. It's
[38:25] dust. How would I be able to say,
[38:28] "Hello, brother Pat. Hello, brother
[38:30] Neville." Or so forth. Hi, Charlie.
[38:34] But now I know that that's
[38:36] wrong. For it is written in the
[38:39] scriptures which I say it's not
[38:41] contrary. For if this earthly tabernacle
[38:45] be dissolved,
[38:48] we have one already waiting.
[38:52] Another tabernacle that has eyes, ears,
[38:58] lips, mental faculties.
[39:01] If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved,
[39:05] it has a body that I can feel, can talk.
[39:09] And now it comes to me just now that
[39:12] Moses had been dead and in an in
[39:16] unmarked grave for 800
[39:18] years. And Elisha had went to heaven 500
[39:23] years before. But on Mount
[39:25] Transfiguration, they were found talking
[39:29] with Jesus.
[39:32] Hallelujah.
[39:35] After Samuel had been dead for at least
[39:39] three to five years, and the witch of
[39:42] Endor called him up, and she fell on her
[39:46] face, and she said, "You have deceived
[39:48] me
[39:50] because you are Saul yourself."
[39:53] She said, "Because I see gods." She was
[39:57] a heathen, you see, "I see gods rising
[40:02] up." And Saul couldn't see him yet. And
[40:05] he said, "What does he look
[40:07] like? Describe him to me." Said, "He's
[40:11] thin and he has a mantel over his
[40:15] shoulder." Said, "That's Samuel the
[40:18] prophet." Hallelujah. Bring him here
[40:20] before
[40:21] me. And I want you to notice that Samuel
[40:24] had not lost any of his
[40:26] personality. He was still a prophet.
[40:30] He told Saul exactly what would happen
[40:33] the next
[40:35] day. So you see, death does
[40:38] not completely diminish us as we weep
[40:42] and whail and lament at the grave. It
[40:46] only changes our dwelling place.
[40:51] It takes us from a place to what is
[40:55] age? If I live one more hour, I'll
[40:59] outlive a many 16y old
[41:02] person. I'll outlive a many
[41:05] five-year-old
[41:07] person. Age is
[41:09] nothing. We're just set here for a
[41:13] purpose to do
[41:15] something. Well, now many of these
[41:19] little prettfaced mothers sitting here,
[41:22] some of them 60 or 70 years old, would
[41:25] say, "Oh, what have I done, Brother
[41:27] Brandham?" You've raised your
[41:29] children. You've done what you were
[41:32] supposed to do. Maybe some old dad
[41:35] sitting here said, "Well, I've hard the
[41:37] fields. I've done this. I never preach."
[41:40] But you did just what God sent for you
[41:43] to do. There's a place for you. Amen.
[41:47] Speaking to an old doctor yesterday, one
[41:50] of my doctor friends
[41:54] buddies, 80s something years
[41:58] old
[42:00] and his
[42:03] sister-in-law is here at the church
[42:07] tonight and she's been just a tingle
[42:10] teeny bit worried about him.
[42:12] And I went to see him. And as soon as I
[42:16] began to talk to him, he brightened up.
[42:19] Told me about a hunting trip he taken
[42:21] many years ago up in Colorado, the very
[42:23] same country I hunt at. Just as
[42:26] brilliant and
[42:27] bright. And I said, "Doctor, how long
[42:30] you been practicing?" He said, "When you
[42:32] were
[42:33] nursing." And way down. I said, "A many
[42:36] a time." He said, "I've practiced taking
[42:38] my buggy.
[42:40] I put my saddle bags over my
[42:44] horse. I've tucked the little
[42:46] satchel and I've walked and I said,
[42:49] "Yes, down along the creek banks 2:00 in
[42:52] the morning with your flashlight trying
[42:54] to find the house where her little child
[42:56] had the tummy ache or mother and labor
[42:58] pains." So, that's
[43:01] right. And I said, you know, doctor, I
[43:04] believe across this dividing line here
[43:07] between mortal and immortality. God has
[43:10] a place for good old doctors. It's
[43:13] served like
[43:14] that. Great tears come in his eyes and
[43:18] he started crying. He reached up his
[43:19] feeble hands and said, "Brother, I hope
[43:22] so." Across the
[43:26] land, God judges a man's
[43:29] soul, what he is. Then I give him this
[43:33] satisfying
[43:35] scripture. Many times pling through
[43:37] those dark muddy fields at night trying
[43:39] to help
[43:40] somebody. Maybe never get a penny for
[43:43] it, but it's all
[43:45] right. I said Jesus said in the
[43:48] scripture, "Blessed are the merciful,
[43:52] for they shall obtain mercy."
[43:58] And that is
[43:59] true. And tonight we want to set the
[44:02] church in these three lessons if God
[44:06] permits how and what to look to what we
[44:10] are. We're going to begin at the first
[44:13] chapter of the book of Paul's letter to
[44:17] Ephesus. And we're going to take the
[44:20] three first chapters in our next three
[44:23] studies. trying to get a chapter a
[44:26] evening if we
[44:27] can tonight, Wednesday, and next Sunday
[44:32] morning. Ephesians, the first
[44:35] chapter.
[44:36] Now, as we study together, I'd like to
[44:40] say
[44:41] this, that this book of
[44:45] Ephesians perfectly
[44:48] parallels the Old Testament Joshua.
[44:54] Ephesians, the book of Ephesians. Now,
[44:57] remember, if we happen to get just a
[44:59] little off to your teaching, just
[45:02] forgive us and bear with us a while.
[45:06] Before we open it, let's ask him to help
[45:09] us as we bow our
[45:10] heads. Lord, we are
[45:14] approaching thy holy and sacred
[45:19] rit which it is more secure than all the
[45:23] heavens and earth.
[45:26] Are we reading this word called the
[45:29] Bible that both heaven and earth will
[45:32] pass away but my word shall never
[45:39] fail. that upon this solemn hour that I
[45:44] come to this pull pit tonight before the
[45:47] purchase of your blood, these precious
[45:50] darling
[45:52] mortals that set here tonight, grasping
[45:56] for every little hope that they can to
[46:00] hold on for that life that is to come.
[46:05] May it be so sufficient tonight that
[46:08] every believer here will see his
[46:10] position and everyone who has not yet
[46:13] come into this great fellowship will
[46:16] press the kingdom Lord and knock at the
[46:19] door until the keeper opens the door.
[46:24] Granted,
[46:25] Lord, we are reading in here where this
[46:28] Bible is of no private
[46:33] interpretation. God forbid that I, your
[46:37] servant, or any other servant would ever
[46:39] try to put their own interpretation to
[46:42] the word.
[46:44] Let us just read it and believe it the
[46:48] way it is written.
[46:50] And especially we shepherds of the
[46:54] flocks, we pastures who someday will
[46:58] gather y in that glorious land
[47:01] with the little flocks. And we'll stand
[47:04] in the presence of the Lord Jesus.
[47:08] And we'll see that generation come up of
[47:11] Paul and of
[47:13] Peter and of Luke and Mark and Matthew
[47:17] and all them. and see them judged there
[47:21] with their
[47:23] groups. God grant that I can lay 10
[47:27] million trophies at your
[47:30] feet while I humbly crawl up and
[47:35] lay my hands upon your precious feet and
[47:40] say, "Lord, they are yours.
[47:44] Oh
[47:46] God, fill us freshly with thy spirit and
[47:50] with thy love and thy goodness.
[47:53] And may we, as the poet has expressed in
[47:56] the song many years
[47:59] ago, dear dying lamb, thy precious blood
[48:05] shall never lose its
[48:08] power until all the ransom church of God
[48:12] be saved to sin no
[48:15] more. And ever since by faith I saw that
[48:20] stream, thy flowing wound
[48:23] supplied. Redeeming love has been my
[48:26] theme and shall be till I die.
[48:32] Then in a nobler, sweeter song, he goes
[48:35] on to
[48:38] say, "I'll sing thy power to save."
[48:44] When this poor liispering, stammering
[48:46] tongue lies silent in the
[48:50] grave, then the grave does not hold any
[48:53] death for your
[48:55] children. It's only a resting place or a
[48:59] hiding place for this corruption will
[49:02] put on incorruption.
[49:05] May we tonight see this Lord plainly as
[49:09] it is given to us in the word.
[49:11] Give us understanding and place us,
[49:14] Lord, at our post of duty that we might
[49:17] serve faithfully until you come. We ask
[49:20] this in Jesus' name and for his sake.
[49:23] Amen.
[49:34] Now, the book of Ephesians, as I was
[49:37] just
[49:39] saying, I to my opinion is one of the
[49:43] greatest books of the New
[49:46] Testament. It leaves us on where
[49:51] Calvinism runs out on one limb and
[49:54] Armenianism runs out on the other limb.
[49:57] But the book of Ephesians draws it
[50:00] together and positionally places the
[50:04] church. Now I typed it with
[50:08] Joshua. If you notice, Israel was
[50:11] brought up out of Egypt and there's
[50:14] three stages of their
[50:17] journey. One stage was leaving Egypt.
[50:21] The next stage was the wilderness and
[50:23] the next stage was Canaan.
[50:27] Now, Canaan does not
[50:31] represent the age of the
[50:35] millennium. It only represents the age
[50:38] of the overcomer, the dispensation of
[50:42] overcoming. Because in Canaan, they
[50:46] killed and burnt and tuck cities and
[50:49] there will be no death in the
[50:51] millennium.
[50:53] But another thing that it
[50:55] does, it brings up justification by
[50:59] faith after they believed in Moses and
[51:01] left Egypt. Sanctification through
[51:04] following under the pillar of fire and
[51:05] the atonement of the sacrificial lamb in
[51:08] the wilderness. And then entering into a
[51:11] land that had been
[51:15] promised. Now what is the land promised
[51:18] to the New Testament believer?
[51:21] The promise is the Holy
[51:25] Spirit. For it shall come to pass in the
[51:28] last days, Joel 2:28, that I will pour
[51:31] out my spirit upon all flesh. Your sons
[51:36] and your daughters shall prophesy upon
[51:38] my handsmaids and my maid servants will
[51:40] I pour out of my spirit and they shall
[51:43] prophesy.
[51:44] I'll show wonders in the heavens above
[51:46] and in the earth, pillars of fire and
[51:48] smoke and
[51:50] vapor. And Peter said on the day of
[51:52] Pentecost after taking his text and
[51:56] preaching, repent every one of you and
[52:00] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[52:03] for the remission.
[52:06] Yes. To remit, to forgive, to take away
[52:12] all back.
[52:14] trespasses. Did you notice Joshua before
[52:17] they crossed Jordan, Joshua said, "Go
[52:21] through the midst of the camp and clean
[52:24] your clothes and sanctify every one of
[52:27] you and let no man come at his
[52:29] wife. For within three days you'll see
[52:33] the glory of God."
[52:36] See it is a it is a process of getting
[52:40] ready to inherit the
[52:44] promise. Now the promise to Israel was
[52:47] God gave Abraham the promise of the
[52:51] land of Palestine and it was to be their
[52:55] possession
[52:57] forever and there was to always remain
[53:00] in this land. Now they come three stages
[53:04] coming to this promised land. Now watch
[53:07] it's perfectly typed in the New
[53:10] Testament. Now this is I've said
[53:13] disagrees with some of the thinking of
[53:16] yours. Some of you precious Nazarene
[53:18] people, church of God and so forth.
[53:21] Don't let it hurt but just watch it
[53:23] closely and watch the types. Watch and
[53:25] see if every place don't hit just
[53:28] perfect. There was three stages of the
[53:31] journey. And there's three stages of
[53:33] this
[53:34] journey. For we are justified by faith,
[53:38] believing on the Lord Jesus
[53:40] Christ, forsaking the land of Egypt,
[53:42] come out and then are sanctified through
[53:46] the offering of his blood, washed from
[53:49] our sins, and become pilgrims and
[53:53] souljourers.
[53:55] claiming that we are seeking a land, a
[53:58] city that's coming are a
[54:01] promise. So did Israel in the
[54:03] wilderness. Souljourers no place to
[54:07] rest. Traveling not at night, following
[54:10] the pillar afar, but finally come to the
[54:15] promised land
[54:18] where they settle
[54:20] down. That's where the believer comes.
[54:23] He comes first to recognition that he's
[54:26] a sinner. Then he is separated by the
[54:29] waters, the washing of the water by the
[54:32] blood and are the washing of the water
[54:35] by the word rather believing on the Lord
[54:38] Jesus Christ. Then being justified by
[54:41] faith, he becomes a partaker and a peace
[54:44] with God through
[54:46] Christ, baptized into the name of Jesus
[54:49] Christ to omit him into the
[54:54] journey. You get
[54:56] it? Into the journey. Then he becomes a
[55:00] souljourer and a
[55:03] pilgrim. He's on his journey to what? a
[55:07] promise that God made. Amen. Amen.
[55:10] Israel had not yet received the promise
[55:13] but they were on their
[55:18] journey and
[55:21] without raising please do understand
[55:25] that's where you the Nazarene and
[55:27] pilgrim holiness and so forth fell
[55:29] because Israel when they come to the
[55:33] spot of Kadesh Barnea when the spies
[55:36] went over and said the land is great But
[55:39] some of them come back and said, "We
[55:41] can't take it because the cities are
[55:43] walled up and so forth." But Joshua and
[55:47] Caleb stood out and said, "We're more
[55:49] than able to take it."
[55:52] Because of their already signed up,
[55:56] documented statements. They believed in
[55:59] two works of grace, justification, and
[56:02] sanctification, and could not move any
[56:04] further.
[56:06] And
[56:07] listen, that whole generation perished
[56:12] in the
[56:16] wilderness. But two that went over into
[56:19] the promised land and brought back the
[56:21] evidence that it was a goodly land and
[56:25] we were more than able to take it
[56:26] because it was God's promise. Then
[56:30] instead of the people going on receiving
[56:32] the Holy Spirit, speaking with tongues,
[56:35] receiving the power of God, the baptism
[56:37] of the Holy Ghost, signs, wonders,
[56:40] miracles, they felt that it would break
[56:42] down their tradition of
[56:45] doctrine. And what happened to it?
[56:48] Perished in the land.
[56:52] That's right. But the believers, the
[56:55] Caleb and Joshua outfit that was going
[56:58] on to the promise,
[57:01] they moved on over into the land and
[57:05] took the land and settled down in the
[57:08] land as a
[57:11] possession. And we never stop at
[57:14] justification,
[57:16] sanctification. Let's go on to the
[57:20] baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[57:22] Let's not stop at a believing on the
[57:25] Lord Jesus, being baptized. Let's not
[57:27] stop because he cleaned us up from a
[57:29] life of sin. But now we pressed on into
[57:34] a position
[57:36] to a promise of the baptism of the Holy
[57:38] Ghost. For Peter said on the day of
[57:40] Pentecost, "For the promise is unto you
[57:45] and to your children, and to them it's
[57:48] far off, even as many as the Lord our
[57:50] God shall
[57:52] call." So Ephesus here sets us like
[57:57] Joshua positioning.
[58:00] You notice Joshua after crossing over
[58:03] the land and taking the land then he
[58:06] divided the land. Ephraim here, Manasses
[58:11] here and this one here, Gad here,
[58:16] Benjamin here. He divided the land. And
[58:20] notice, oh, this just burns our hearts.
[58:25] Each one of those Hebrew mothers giving
[58:28] birth to those
[58:30] children. She spoke the very place in
[58:33] her labor pains where they would be
[58:36] positioned in the promised
[58:39] land. Oh, it's a great study. We could
[58:43] only go into it in details which would
[58:45] take hours after hours.
[58:49] Someday when we get our church fixed, I
[58:52] just like to come and take a solid month
[58:54] or two. Amen. Just stay right in it.
[58:57] Watch when they each one of those
[58:59] mothers when she called out
[59:03] Ephraim when she was in labor
[59:06] positionally placed him where his feet
[59:09] was sitting in
[59:11] a just exactly every one of them
[59:15] wherever they were at. And Joshua not
[59:18] knowing this, but by
[59:21] inspiration led of the Holy Spirit after
[59:24] being into the promised land give each
[59:27] man his promise exactly what the Holy
[59:29] Spirit promised through the birth back
[59:31] there.
[59:34] How that God has set some in the church
[59:38] through the labor pains.
[59:40] Oh, they get tremendous
[59:43] sometime when a church is groaning under
[59:46] the persecution of the outside world
[59:50] believing on the Lord Jesus that the
[59:52] promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[59:54] real to us as it was to
[59:56] Pentecost. How they groan and cry or
[1:00:00] labor pains. But when they are born and
[1:00:05] positionally born into the kingdom of
[1:00:08] God, then the Holy Ghost has set in the
[1:00:12] church some
[1:00:14] apostles. So the church is now this is
[1:00:17] my purpose of doing
[1:00:18] this. The church is always trying to
[1:00:22] take somebody else's corner,
[1:00:26] but don't do that. You can never raise
[1:00:29] corn in Ephraim's corner if you're a
[1:00:33] Manasses. You've got to take your place
[1:00:37] in Christ.
[1:00:39] Positionally take it. Oh, it gets deep
[1:00:42] and rich when we get in
[1:00:43] here. How that God puts one in the
[1:00:47] church to speak with tongues, another
[1:00:50] Now, we have been taught many times we
[1:00:52] all have to speak with tongues. That's
[1:00:54] wrong. We all got to do it. No, we
[1:00:56] don't. They all didn't do one thing.
[1:00:58] Each one was each lamb was provided and
[1:01:02] divied up by inspiration. And each one I
[1:01:05] could take the scriptures and show to
[1:01:07] you exactly that he put them in the
[1:01:10] place where they were supposed to be.
[1:01:12] Amen.
[1:01:14] Thank you, Lord.
[1:01:15] Positionally, how that the two half
[1:01:17] tribes is to stay across the river. How
[1:01:20] that their mothers cried that in their
[1:01:23] birth. and how that each place was
[1:01:25] supposed to be. And now after you're in,
[1:01:28] that don't mean that you're out free
[1:01:30] from war. You still have to fight for
[1:01:32] every inch of ground you stand on. So
[1:01:36] see, Canaan did not represent the great
[1:01:40] heaven because it's war and troubles and
[1:01:44] killings and fightings and so forth. But
[1:01:47] it did represent
[1:01:49] this that it must be a perfect walk.
[1:01:55] That's where the church is failing
[1:01:57] today. Lord, on that walk,
[1:02:01] do you know that even your own behavior
[1:02:04] can knock somebody else out of getting
[1:02:06] healed?
[1:02:09] Your misbehavior of unconfessed sins of
[1:02:12] you
[1:02:13] believers can cause this church to
[1:02:16] bitterly fail. And at the day of the
[1:02:18] judgment, you'll be responsible for
[1:02:20] every bit of
[1:02:21] it. Or you say, "Now wait a minute,
[1:02:23] brother Brandon." Well, that's the
[1:02:26] truth. Think of it. Joshua after he
[1:02:30] crossed over into the land, God gave him
[1:02:33] the promise that just think to fight a
[1:02:36] entire
[1:02:38] campaign without losing a man,
[1:02:42] without having to have a nurse or a
[1:02:44] first aid or a band.
[1:02:49] God said, "The land's yours. Go
[1:02:52] fight." Think of fighting a campaign and
[1:02:55] there's no Red Cross around at all.
[1:02:57] There's nobody going to get hurt. And
[1:03:00] they slay the Amorites and the Hittites,
[1:03:04] but there wasn't one herd among any of
[1:03:07] them until sin come in the
[1:03:11] camp. And when
[1:03:13] Achen took that Babylonian garment and
[1:03:17] that gold wedge and hid it under his
[1:03:19] camp, then the next day they lost 16
[1:03:23] men.
[1:03:25] Joshua said,
[1:03:27] "Stop. Stop. Wait a minute. There's
[1:03:30] something
[1:03:33] wrong. Something's wrong. Yeah, we're
[1:03:35] going to call seven days of
[1:03:39] fast. God made us a promise. There would
[1:03:43] be nothing hurt us. Our enemies will
[1:03:45] fall at our
[1:03:46] feet." And there's something wrong here.
[1:03:52] Something went wrong somewhere cuz we
[1:03:54] got 16 dead men laying here. They're
[1:03:57] Israelite brothers and they're dead.
[1:04:00] Why did they die? Innocent man. Because
[1:04:03] one man stepped out of the line.
[1:04:12] You see reason this needs to be taught?
[1:04:14] Amen. The church lining up lining up
[1:04:18] with the word of God. Amen. lining up
[1:04:21] with God, lining up with each other.
[1:04:23] Amen. Walking perfectly upright, soberly
[1:04:26] before all man fearing God.
[1:04:30] Because one man stole a garment and done
[1:04:34] something that he should not done took
[1:04:35] the life of 16
[1:04:38] men. I think it was 16, maybe more. I
[1:04:42] believe it was 16 men that was dead.
[1:04:45] Joshua called said, "There's something
[1:04:47] wrong. God made the
[1:04:51] promise and something's wrong.
[1:04:56] We bring the sick up before us and they
[1:04:59] failed to be healed. We need to call a
[1:05:02] solemn fast.
[1:05:04] Call an
[1:05:05] assembly. Something's wrong
[1:05:08] somewhere. God made the promise. God's
[1:05:11] got to stick to that promise and he will
[1:05:13] do it.
[1:05:15] Amen. And he called a fast and they
[1:05:18] found out the castle lots and Achen
[1:05:21] confessed it and they killed Achen
[1:05:23] family and all and burnt their ashes and
[1:05:27] left it there for memorial and Joshua
[1:05:30] went right on through the battles taking
[1:05:33] everything without a scratch or
[1:05:35] wound. There you
[1:05:37] are. One day he had needed a little
[1:05:40] time, extra time. The sun was going
[1:05:42] down. The man couldn't fight very good
[1:05:45] at nighttime. Joshua, that great warrior
[1:05:48] anointed of God, positionally placed
[1:05:50] into the land like Ephesians to the new
[1:05:53] church, possess possessed the possessing
[1:05:56] the land, taking it over. He needed some
[1:05:59] time. So he said, "Son, stand still."
[1:06:04] And she stood still for about 12 hours
[1:06:09] until he took the land.
[1:06:13] See now the book of Ephesians place us
[1:06:17] positionally in Christ what they was in
[1:06:20] the holy land. We are placed not in the
[1:06:24] holy land but in the holy ghost.
[1:06:28] Amen.
[1:06:31] Now let us read just a
[1:06:33] word. See how perfect the church is.
[1:06:39] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[1:06:43] will of God. Oh, I like that. Yes. God
[1:06:48] made him an apostle. No elders laid
[1:06:51] hands on him. No bishop sent him
[1:06:53] anywhere. But God called him and made
[1:06:57] him an apostle.
[1:07:01] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[1:07:04] will of God to the
[1:07:07] saints, sanctified ones, which are at
[1:07:11] Ephesus and to the
[1:07:14] faithful in Jesus Christ. Watch how he
[1:07:19] addresses this. This is not to the
[1:07:23] unbelievers. This is to the church.
[1:07:26] Amen. It's called to the called out
[1:07:30] ones, the sanctified and called ones
[1:07:33] that are in Christ Jesus.
[1:07:37] Now, if you want to know how we get in
[1:07:39] Christ Jesus, if you'll turn to 1
[1:07:41] Corinthians
[1:07:42] 12, it said, "For by one spirit." Yes.
[1:07:50] Are we all baptized into one body? How?
[1:07:56] Baptized by what? The Holy Ghost. Not by
[1:08:00] water baptism, you church of Christ
[1:08:02] people, but by one capital S P I R I T.
[1:08:08] By one spirit.
[1:08:11] Not by one handshake, by one
[1:08:15] letter, not by one
[1:08:18] sprinkle, but by one spirit. Amen. We
[1:08:23] are all baptized into one
[1:08:28] body. Our possession, the land that God
[1:08:32] give us to live in the Holy Ghost. Just
[1:08:34] as he give Canaan to the Jews, he's give
[1:08:37] us the Holy Spirit by one spirit. Are we
[1:08:42] all baptized into one body? Amen.
[1:08:49] You get it? Amen.
[1:08:51] Now he's talking to the spiritual
[1:08:54] Canaanites.
[1:08:56] Amen. Israel, the spiritual Israel who
[1:08:59] has possessed the
[1:09:01] land. Oh, aren't you glad you come out
[1:09:04] of Egypt's garlic?
[1:09:08] Aren't you glad you're out of the
[1:09:09] wilderness?
[1:09:11] And remember, they had to eat mana,
[1:09:15] angels, food out of heaven until they
[1:09:17] crossed over into the land. And when
[1:09:21] they crossed over into the land, the
[1:09:23] mana cease to fall. They were fully
[1:09:26] matured then and they eat the old corn
[1:09:29] of the land. Amen.
[1:09:33] Now, now that you're not babies
[1:09:36] anymore, now that you're not desiring
[1:09:39] the censor milk of the gospel, that you
[1:09:42] don't have to be babyed and patted and
[1:09:44] persuaded to come to church, now that
[1:09:48] you're real fully matured Christians,
[1:09:51] you're ready to eat strong meats now.
[1:09:54] Amen. You're ready to come into
[1:09:57] something. He said, "You're ready to
[1:09:59] understand something that's deep and
[1:10:01] rich."
[1:10:03] Oh, we'll get into the hidden sense of
[1:10:05] foundation of the world. Praise God. He
[1:10:09] said, "Now that you've come into this,
[1:10:11] I'm addressing this to
[1:10:14] you. Not to those who've just left
[1:10:16] Egypt, not to those who are still in the
[1:10:19] journey, but to those who are in the
[1:10:22] promised land. That has received the
[1:10:25] promise.
[1:10:27] How many's received the promise of the
[1:10:28] Holy Ghost? Aren't you glad that you're
[1:10:31] in the land
[1:10:34] over here now eating the old corn
[1:10:37] eating the strong things of God. Got a
[1:10:40] clear understanding. Your your spiritual
[1:10:43] mind is all unmuddled up. You know
[1:10:47] exactly who he is. You know exactly what
[1:10:50] he is. You know exactly where you're
[1:10:52] going. You know exactly all about it.
[1:10:55] You know in whom you have believed and
[1:10:57] persuaded he's able to keep that which
[1:10:59] you've committed to him against the day.
[1:11:01] Oh, that's the one. That's who Paul's
[1:11:04] talking to. Now listen
[1:11:07] close now. Watch. The faithful in Christ
[1:11:23] Jesus. Amen. Aren't you glad to be the
[1:11:26] faithful in Christ Jesus? Amen. Strong
[1:11:30] meats. Amen. God help
[1:11:33] us. Um let's stand to our feet. We don't
[1:11:37] have any written prayer requests, but if
[1:11:39] there's anyone that has a request
[1:11:41] tonight would like to make that known,
[1:11:43] we can reach. Yes. Sister Heather,
[1:11:52] she went through her surgery. Well,
[1:11:53] Sister An. All right. Wonderful. Let's
[1:11:56] say praise the Lord for that and we'll
[1:11:58] pray for her recovery or complete
[1:12:00] recovery. Was there someone else had a
[1:12:03] request tonight?
[1:12:12] Yes. Okay. Good. We'll pray
[1:12:15] for Sister Abigail's coworker there. Um,
[1:12:20] I know there's others that need a touch
[1:12:22] in their body. Continue to pray for
[1:12:24] Sister Lori, her recovery. I think it's
[1:12:27] over. I forget what Randy says. 28 hours
[1:12:31] of accumulated surgeries. That's how
[1:12:34] much her body's been under. We're just
[1:12:37] praying that the Lord will recover her
[1:12:39] completely. Amen. Brother Joe.
[1:12:54] Christina and Anna. All right, we'll
[1:12:56] pray for them. The Lord will bless them
[1:12:58] and as their graduation is coming up,
[1:13:01] God will be with them. Was there any
[1:13:04] other requests here
[1:13:05] tonight? All right. Well, praise the
[1:13:08] Lord. Let us sing that
[1:13:11] song. Let's see here.
[1:13:18] As we go begin to go down on our knees
[1:13:21] to
[1:13:23] pray, let's sing that song. Grace,
[1:13:26] grace, God's
[1:13:28] grace,
[1:13:30] greater. Marvelous grace of our loving
[1:13:33] Lord.
[1:13:38] Marvelous grace of our
[1:13:43] loving
[1:13:46] Lord. Grace that
[1:13:50] exceeds our sin and our guilt.
[1:13:58] on
[1:14:00] Calary's
[1:14:05] mount. There where the blood of the
[1:14:12] lamb was
[1:14:15] spilled.
[1:14:17] Grace, grace.
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:14:22] God's
[1:14:25] grace. Grace that will
[1:14:29] pardon and
[1:14:31] cleanse within.
[1:14:33] [Music]
[1:14:37] Great.
[1:14:39] Grace,
[1:14:42] God's
[1:14:44] grace, grace that is
[1:14:48] greater than
[1:14:50] all our sin.
[1:14:55] Sin and
[1:14:57] despair like the
[1:15:00] sea waves
[1:15:03] cold threats and the
[1:15:07] soul with
[1:15:10] infinite love.
[1:15:14] Grace that is
[1:15:17] greater. His
[1:15:19] grace
[1:15:22] contour points to the refuge. the
[1:15:29] mighty
[1:15:32] cross.
[1:15:34] Grace,
[1:15:36] grace,
[1:15:39] God's
[1:15:41] grace, grace that will
[1:15:45] pardon and
[1:15:48] cleanse.
[1:15:51] Hallelujah. Praise.
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:15:56] Grace,
[1:15:58] God.
[1:16:00] Grace, grace that is
[1:16:04] greater than
[1:16:07] all our
[1:16:10] sins. Dark is the stain that we
[1:16:17] can not hide.
[1:16:21] What can
[1:16:24] avail to wash it
[1:16:29] away? Look, there is
[1:16:34] flowing a
[1:16:36] crimson
[1:16:39] tide, wider than snow you can
[1:16:45] breathe. Let's take the last verse.
[1:16:51] marvelous
[1:16:53] infinite
[1:16:56] matchless
[1:16:58] grace. It's
[1:17:00] freely
[1:17:02] bestowed on all who
[1:17:08] believe. You that are longing to
[1:17:14] see his face.
[1:17:18] Will you this moment his
[1:17:23] grace
[1:17:27] receive
[1:17:29] grace
[1:17:31] grace God's
[1:17:35] hallelujah. Amen. Praise
[1:17:38] the heart.
[1:17:43] Cleanse
[1:17:45] within.
[1:17:48] Grace,
[1:17:50] grace,
[1:17:52] God.
[1:17:55] Grace, grace that is
[1:17:59] greater than
[1:18:02] all our sins. Also, I failed to mention
[1:18:07] brother uh Roland McGraw and sister
[1:18:11] Denell, his wife, and their son. They
[1:18:13] all need special prayer as he's getting
[1:18:16] aged and she's been his
[1:18:18] careaker, and she's broken down in her
[1:18:21] body as well. So, remember the McGraz
[1:18:23] prayer. Amen. So, you can pray at the
[1:18:26] altar, pray at your seat. God bless you.

[1:38:46] Amen.
[1:38:48] [Music]
[1:38:51] Oh, glorious
[1:38:54] victory. That day he set me
[1:38:59] free and made my
[1:39:03] heart. His very
[1:39:07] throne. My life is no longer
[1:39:11] mine. I'm a prisoner of love
[1:39:16] divine. And now I live. Now I live to
[1:39:21] praise his name. Who I am. Who I am,
[1:39:29] Lord. Who I

[1:41:51] hand and tell them who I am.
[1:41:55] Who? Brother Andy, you come and dismiss
[1:41:59] us in a word of prayer.
