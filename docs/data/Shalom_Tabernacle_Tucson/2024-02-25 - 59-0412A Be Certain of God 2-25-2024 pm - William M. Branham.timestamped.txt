[37:23] surprise there was a lady who could in
[37:27] interpret languages that last evening I
[37:31] was speaking
[37:32] here and was the Holy Spirit was
[37:37] speaking rather and was calling the
[37:40] people out in the meeting and telling
[37:43] them of their different afflictions and
[37:46] their diseases and sometimes I couldn't
[37:49] make them understand just who it was and
[37:53] then the Holy Spirit would call their
[37:56] name
[37:57] out as you've noticed him doing that and
[38:01] then they were telling me this morning
[38:03] which Visions to me are just like a
[38:07] trance and they were telling me of a
[38:10] woman that I had called back in
[38:13] somewhere in the
[38:15] audiences and had told her
[38:17] that a certain Affliction had gripped
[38:22] her but she was couldn't understand me
[38:26] because she didn't she was from a
[38:29] another
[38:30] country a Finnish
[38:32] woman and then the Holy Spirit to show
[38:36] that he's no respected person spoke
[38:39] through here and called her name and
[38:41] told her to bless God spoke in a
[38:45] language that I didn't know and called
[38:49] the woman and give who she was and
[38:53] something about to uh the Lord Lord's
[38:56] blessings upon her or something other in
[38:59] Finnish
[39:00] language I don't even know English let
[39:04] alone finish so it goes to show that God
[39:09] speaks in all the languages and all
[39:12] human beings belong to
[39:14] him how
[39:17] wonderful he is doing the exceedingly
[39:22] abundantly I do not wish to take too
[39:25] much of the time but just
[39:27] while this is on my
[39:28] mind I
[39:30] remember sometime ago at the Sam Houston
[39:34] Coliseum in down in Houston
[39:37] Texas and we were trying to had such an
[39:42] overflow crowd to we were trying to take
[39:44] care of part of them at the Coliseum and
[39:47] part over to Raymond riches I'm sure
[39:51] that the angelist temple knows who
[39:53] Raymond Richie is he was a personal
[39:55] friend to the founder of this
[39:58] church and I would pray over here for
[40:01] our prayer line then go over to the
[40:03] Coliseum and praying and one night when
[40:06] my brother was taking me from the prayer
[40:09] line I heard a little Spanish girl
[40:13] weeping and she would have been the next
[40:17] in line according to the numbers of the
[40:19] prayer cards I was
[40:20] calling and she wasn't nothing but a
[40:23] child of 15 years old something
[40:27] well my brother started pushing me on
[40:29] and the man that was supposed to take
[40:33] me but somehow Something Told me see
[40:37] that child I said oh bring her here and
[40:41] they brought her over and she gave her
[40:43] prayer card to the man and so she came
[40:46] over and I be to speak to her and and
[40:50] she just stood there I thought she might
[40:52] be deaf and
[40:54] dumb but find out she couldn't speak
[40:57] English she could not understand one
[41:01] word of
[41:02] English and so I asked if there was an
[41:05] interpreter and they got a man and
[41:08] brought him up for the
[41:10] interpretation well I asked her a few
[41:13] questions and she began answering me uh
[41:16] Through The
[41:17] Interpreter and then all of a sudden the
[41:19] vision
[41:21] come and I said I see before me a little
[41:25] girl
[41:26] with little platted hair hanging down
[41:29] her back she's sitting by an old
[41:32] fireplace eating yellow corn from a cob
[41:38] that's being took from a KD which hangs
[41:40] over the fireplace and she's eaten too
[41:43] much of it she falls violently ill and
[41:47] she's taken to the bed by her mother and
[41:50] throwed into
[41:53] epilepsy and then the vision left and
[41:56] the little girl turned to The
[41:59] Interpreter and said in Spanish I
[42:01] thought he couldn't speak
[42:06] Spanish and The Interpreter said you
[42:09] spoke English did you not brother
[42:11] brandom I said I did he said well she
[42:14] said you spoke Spanish I said stop the
[42:17] recorders all along the road and they
[42:20] stopped and we played it back and every
[42:22] word was English then we had her to
[42:25] repeat what I said and as long as the
[42:30] vision was going on she heard every word
[42:32] in
[42:35] English why hear how hear we every man
[42:38] in our own tongue wherein we were born
[42:42] God is still
[42:45] God now when I begin to say words within
[42:48] myself she didn't understand that at all
[42:51] but the Holy Spirit speaking English was
[42:54] interpreted to her in Spanish
[42:57] God
[42:58] is a good God as or Roberts places him
[43:04] certainly is
[43:05] true and if we could only grasp that
[43:09] this afternoon that his goodness to that
[43:12] little woman Finnish or whatever she was
[43:15] last night to be sure that her faith
[43:19] would be
[43:20] recognized he called her in her own
[43:24] language wonderful now overseas many
[43:27] time we see that happen in the foreign
[43:30] countries that I'll be standing speaking
[43:33] and it'll turn right back around and use
[43:36] my language and call people and their
[43:37] names and everything just like it does
[43:39] here in their own native
[43:41] language that's what I call
[43:44] Pentecost I I believe it that's the Holy
[43:49] Spirit now the last few nights we
[43:52] haven't been giving out any prayer cards
[43:54] for a prayer line
[43:56] so I believe it would be an order
[43:58] tonight to have a prayer line to pray
[44:01] for the sick all next week beginning
[44:04] Tuesday night we expect to go all
[44:07] through next week so you come out each
[44:10] night come praying bringing somebody
[44:12] with you the boys will be giving out the
[44:15] prayer cards in about 35 minutes as soon
[44:18] as the service is finished here and you
[44:21] who want a prayer card just remain now
[44:24] they'll bring the prayer cards up here
[44:26] and give them out to anyone who wants
[44:28] them may the Lord add His blessings to
[44:31] all that we do for we do it in his
[44:37] name now to our subject and to our
[44:40] lesson for a few
[44:43] moments Brother David read the
[44:46] scriptures because I just met an old
[44:50] friend that's sitting present this
[44:54] afternoon about two years years ago I
[44:56] was up on the River of No Return with my
[45:00] good friends the Christian
[45:03] businessman I'm uh love to
[45:06] hunt and they had a new guide that year
[45:10] and I kind of fell in love with this man
[45:13] a young fell that and he would I liked
[45:18] him there seemed to be something about
[45:20] him that was a little more than a
[45:23] cowpoke and I met his wife she was a
[45:27] waitress at the
[45:29] restaurant at the place where we were
[45:31] eating up at North Forks near Salmon
[45:35] River
[45:36] Idaho and on the road back it happened
[45:39] to be that God let this young fellow
[45:43] become a Chum to me to hunt with
[45:47] me and I remember getting a good shot
[45:51] one morning at my elk way across the
[45:53] valleys and and got him very very Humane
[45:56] and this young fellow was helping me
[45:59] skin him out and I was noticing him and
[46:03] I said to him Jim are you a
[46:07] Christian and I believe he said he
[46:09] belonged to some church or something
[46:12] another but there was something about
[46:15] him it seemed
[46:17] honest that night when we went in sit at
[46:21] the table I kept watching him while he
[46:23] was laying on his Camp bags sleeping I
[46:26] passed by and laid my hand upon
[46:29] him and asked God to save him and today
[46:35] him and his lovely little wife meets me
[46:37] back here in the back they are both
[46:39] Pentecostal Believers has got the Holy
[46:41] Ghost setting present
[46:44] now Prayer Changes Things brother
[46:49] gisby oh he's so real if we'll just pray
[46:53] and then believe that we get what we ask
[46:58] for so that's why I had brother
[47:00] duplicity to read the word for me I just
[47:03] had to greet Jim and his
[47:05] wife God's given a lovely little baby
[47:08] since then we're
[47:11] happy now Brother David was reading out
[47:14] of the book of kings of Elijah the great
[47:20] prophet and it must have been a terrible
[47:24] morning dry and
[47:28] hot there hadn't had no rain for three
[47:31] years and six
[47:33] months it was so dry and hot till the
[47:36] world was ready to blaze into
[47:40] fire the people were starving in the
[47:44] streets and there was a cry
[47:48] everywhere all this had been brought on
[47:51] because of the moral decay of the nation
[47:57] Israel was loved of
[47:59] God but when they got out of the will of
[48:03] God the enemy taking them
[48:05] over God loves his church but when we
[48:09] get out of the will of God the enemy
[48:12] takes the church
[48:14] over and Ahab who was king of Israel at
[48:19] that
[48:20] time and to my thinking the most wicked
[48:23] King Israel ever had
[48:27] because he married an idolator
[48:31] Jezebel she was a sinner and an ungodly
[48:36] person and instead of being a man of his
[48:40] own house he gave into to
[48:43] her and through that they had caused the
[48:46] nation to come to moral
[48:50] Decay that went after brought the nation
[48:53] into idolatry because of that went after
[48:56] her
[48:58] Idols it's something similar to
[49:02] today all the people agreed that it was
[49:06] all right for him to do
[49:08] that because the
[49:10] government the king and the queen
[49:14] endorsed
[49:15] it and they was the most popular people
[49:18] in that
[49:20] nation and because the king and the
[49:23] queen did it the people thought that it
[49:27] would be all
[49:29] right now that's about the picture of
[49:32] our country
[49:34] today many people just follow one
[49:40] another and they think because that the
[49:43] government has given the boo sellers
[49:46] license to sell whiskey that it's all
[49:49] right to get drunk it's
[49:53] wrong and many times good women think
[49:58] because that the cigarette companies
[50:00] puts these pictures out on these
[50:03] advertisements of women smoking
[50:05] cigarettes and the movie stars and many
[50:08] of them and the popular women smoke that
[50:11] it's all
[50:13] right that's what's caused our moral
[50:16] decay in this
[50:19] nation the backbone of Any Nation is
[50:23] motherhood break motherhood you broke
[50:25] the back of the
[50:28] nation and when I've got a statistics
[50:31] that shows that I believe it's about 80%
[50:35] of cigarette smoking mothers has to
[50:38] raise their babies own
[50:40] bottles because there so much nicotine
[50:43] in their blood it will kill the baby
[50:45] before it's 18 months
[50:49] old you talk about a
[50:53] sabotage that's one of the greatest
[50:56] sabotages the nation's
[50:59] got and regardless of all of the
[51:02] warnings that the doctors put out such
[51:06] slogans as cancer by
[51:08] carload and All These Warnings the
[51:12] people want to follow one
[51:16] another because it's
[51:19] some silly woman actress of some sort
[51:23] advertises cigarettes and and blows it
[51:26] through her nose and acts
[51:29] smart but that's no place or no thing
[51:32] for a lady to
[51:35] do it's
[51:38] wrong I was passing down one of your
[51:41] street chair a few days ago and I seen
[51:45] in a
[51:46] barroom it said tables for
[51:51] ladies I don't mean to be rude and I
[51:54] don't want to Hur hurt anyone's feelings
[51:57] but ladies don't go in places like
[52:00] that they've never had one in
[52:04] [Applause]
[52:08] there I'd imagine they've never had a
[52:11] customer and never
[52:13] will because it's no place for
[52:17] ladies
[52:18] but find people
[52:22] sometime see those things and and see
[52:26] people who are up and up what we call go
[52:30] into such places and they think that's
[52:32] the thing for them to
[52:35] do feared God and keep his Commandments
[52:39] for this is the whole duty of
[52:43] man but you see the the king had said
[52:48] this is all right because his wife
[52:51] thought it was all right and they caused
[52:54] a moral Decay and then they thought
[52:58] because they were prosperous no
[53:01] Wars and so forth that that was a sign
[53:04] that God was with them Prosperity is not
[53:08] always a sign that God is with
[53:10] you many times that's
[53:16] deceiving the rain falls on the just and
[53:19] the
[53:21] unjust but it's by their fruits they are
[53:24] known
[53:26] and so this nation was really
[53:30] corrupted and God had sent judgment up
[53:33] on
[53:35] it all the preachers had bent under the
[53:38] heavy
[53:39] load because the members of the church
[53:42] had forced them to do things I feel
[53:46] sorry for a preacher that's gotten no
[53:48] more God about him and to let his
[53:50] congregation dick to him and get him off
[53:53] in a rut like that
[53:55] I believe that we need preachers that's
[53:58] man that's God-fearing godsent servants
[54:03] who's not afraid to call black black and
[54:05] white
[54:07] white the gospel's been handled too much
[54:09] now with kid gloves
[54:12] on we need some
[54:15] oldfashioned preaching like Billy Sunday
[54:17] and John the Baptist and some of them
[54:20] oldfashioned Hellfire and brimstone
[54:24] messages again back to the people I know
[54:26] it's not popular so when they got away
[54:29] from that you see what a condition the
[54:31] Nations got
[54:32] in so it it takes that
[54:36] brother and all that the pastors would
[54:39] give in so they let the that had a
[54:42] social gospel no
[54:44] doubt and so but there was one who
[54:48] didn't give
[54:50] in there was a little old prophet in the
[54:53] land in that day he didn't bow down to
[54:56] any of their Idols for he know that
[55:00] Jehovah was a holy
[55:02] God and he required Holiness and
[55:07] cleansiness and
[55:09] decency for he know that Jehovah could
[55:12] not
[55:13] change and if Jehovah to bring the
[55:17] children out of Israel had to cleanse
[55:20] them and sanctify them and when they
[55:24] walked de dis orderly according to his
[55:26] Commandments he placed judgment upon
[55:28] them he know that Jehovah was the same
[55:31] yesterday today and
[55:33] forever therefore he would not give in
[55:37] Old Jezebel hated
[55:39] him and all of her company hated
[55:43] him but God loved him and respected him
[55:48] because he never let down on the word of
[55:51] God he stayed with
[55:53] it God give us more Elijah in this cruel
[55:56] evil day of corruption that we're living
[55:59] in that's not a
[56:03] scared to preach what's the truth what
[56:05] the Bible says without Holiness no man
[56:09] shall see the
[56:11] Lord you must be cleansed from your sins
[56:15] by the blood of the Lord
[56:18] Jesus
[56:19] now there was a woman in the
[56:23] land neither one of these people know
[56:25] each
[56:26] other but she must have been an
[56:29] honorable
[56:30] woman she must have been the type of
[56:33] woman that Elijah was a
[56:36] man because God chose that
[56:40] woman out of all the women that there
[56:43] was in Israel to entertain his
[56:46] prophet and he would have never chose an
[56:49] immoral woman to entertain his
[56:52] prophet and this woman was was a Witter
[56:56] woman the drought was in the
[57:00] land and she started out after the death
[57:03] of her
[57:04] husband she had a little baby to
[57:08] raise and she was struggling to try to
[57:12] make a living for the little
[57:14] fell and finally the bread begin to ceas
[57:20] and it come to a place one day when she
[57:23] went in to look at her little
[57:26] fella and she's seen his little sleeves
[57:30] out toring she might have looked at
[57:34] herself in a miror and seen that how
[57:36] she' left the table with something on it
[57:39] for the
[57:40] baby and her own cheekbones are sticking
[57:44] out and her little frail looking
[57:48] arms she didn't mind it for
[57:51] herself but the little boy
[57:56] she was trying she didn't want to see
[57:58] him
[58:00] die so finally one day she went to the
[58:03] meal barrel and there was just one
[58:06] handful of meal
[58:09] left she goes over to the Cru to see how
[58:13] much oil and just about a good
[58:19] tablespoonful that stood between her and
[58:23] death
[58:25] I suppose that night there was an
[58:27] allnight prayer
[58:30] meeting isn't it strange how God lets us
[58:33] get right down to the end of the
[58:36] road no doubt but she checked
[58:39] up said Lord God something like
[58:43] this I've served you I've done all that
[58:47] I know how to do I've met your
[58:51] requirements and here I've got one
[58:53] handful of meat meal and a spoonful of
[58:56] oil between death for my child and
[59:00] myself all night long she must have
[59:05] prayed and when the little fellow would
[59:07] wake
[59:09] up turn over and say
[59:13] mama would you go back to the cupboard
[59:16] and see if there just a little bit of
[59:18] that bread
[59:21] left she'd go back cry a
[59:26] little and then she
[59:29] would come back and give him a little
[59:32] water to
[59:33] drink far she knew she could just had
[59:36] this little bit and it had to maybe make
[59:38] the next
[59:40] day and the little fellow maybe couldn't
[59:42] sleep good because of
[59:46] hungry I've been through those places no
[59:50] doubt but what there's many here have
[59:52] been through those places I seen SE my
[59:55] mother leave the table of the morning
[59:57] sit back in the house and
[59:59] cry when she what we had on the table is
[1:00:02] some stale
[1:00:04] bread and she'd pour some coffee over it
[1:00:06] and some sugar over the top of it for us
[1:00:08] kitties and go back in the room and
[1:00:12] weep say I'm not hungry when she was
[1:00:16] hungry us trying to go to school like
[1:00:21] that and the woman as she seen old was
[1:00:25] that crucial hour coming no doubt she
[1:00:28] checked up and said
[1:00:30] Lord I've done all that I know how to
[1:00:34] do when you've done everything that you
[1:00:37] know how to
[1:00:39] do and met every requirement that God
[1:00:43] has
[1:00:44] required that's where Faith takes a hold
[1:00:48] that's where faith comes
[1:00:50] in if you've met every requirement that
[1:00:53] God required you to
[1:00:56] do then sometimes God tests your faith
[1:01:01] to see what kind of a reaction you'll
[1:01:03] have on your
[1:01:06] action oh he's good at
[1:01:08] that it just that's it just proves
[1:01:11] whether you really believe what you
[1:01:13] think you
[1:01:15] believe you know he does that many times
[1:01:19] one morning there was some Hebrew
[1:01:21] children was going to be burnt
[1:01:23] up
[1:01:25] and they knew that they had done God's
[1:01:29] Will and they said we're not afraid of
[1:01:34] the king's
[1:01:35] Commandments our God is able to Deliver
[1:01:38] Us from this fiery
[1:01:40] furnace nevertheless we not bow to his
[1:01:45] image God was going to give him a test
[1:01:48] to see what their reaction to their
[1:01:51] action would
[1:01:52] be and he let them walk right straight
[1:01:55] to the fiery furnace before he ever
[1:01:58] moved but when all of God's requirements
[1:02:02] has been met and you're certain of God
[1:02:06] that God will do it stand still then and
[1:02:09] God will do
[1:02:12] it if you sat in these
[1:02:15] meetings and You' seen the Lord God move
[1:02:19] out over the audience Healing The Sick
[1:02:22] and Afflicted and yet you you seem to
[1:02:25] still have your
[1:02:27] disease and when I asked for to put
[1:02:29] hands on each other and youve made your
[1:02:33] wrongs right before him you've accepted
[1:02:37] him and you've been baptized in
[1:02:39] Christian
[1:02:40] faith and your heart's clean before him
[1:02:44] then sometime when God delays his answer
[1:02:47] he's only wanting to see what you'll
[1:02:50] react by just be sure that you believe
[1:02:54] believe that it's God and then hold on
[1:02:57] to it don't you
[1:03:00] move if you've been prayed far hands
[1:03:03] laid on You by Believers the Bible said
[1:03:05] these signs shall follow them that
[1:03:09] believe that's God's
[1:03:13] requirement and God requires you to
[1:03:16] believe his
[1:03:18] word
[1:03:20] job God let the devil test job once when
[1:03:25] job went out and made a burnt offering
[1:03:27] for his
[1:03:28] children they had a party so job know in
[1:03:31] his days what teenagers is like what
[1:03:34] they were made up of that mind that
[1:03:37] can't get
[1:03:38] settled and so job said perhaps what if
[1:03:42] my children did
[1:03:44] Sin I'll offer a burnt offer for him
[1:03:49] anyhow and when he was standing Pat on
[1:03:53] that offering
[1:03:55] it's what God required a burn
[1:03:59] offering that's all he required to
[1:04:02] confess and make a burnt
[1:04:05] offering and job not he did that and
[1:04:09] then the devil was turned loose on him
[1:04:12] and he begin to kill his children
[1:04:15] destroy his
[1:04:17] goods and he had some of his church
[1:04:19] members come to him and said you are a
[1:04:22] secret sinner
[1:04:25] you've got something in your heart that
[1:04:27] you haven't confessed
[1:04:29] job but job know that he hadn't done it
[1:04:34] he was sure that he had met God's
[1:04:38] requirements and he stood Pat on it
[1:04:42] that's it he know he confessed his
[1:04:45] sins call for God to try him search him
[1:04:49] and see if there was anything wrong see
[1:04:52] God was just waiting to see see what job
[1:04:54] would do because Satan said I'll make
[1:04:57] him curse you to your face but God said
[1:05:00] there's none like him in the earth he
[1:05:02] won't do it God had confidence in him
[1:05:06] and maybe if your healing is angering a
[1:05:08] little bit God's got confidence in you
[1:05:10] that you'll hold
[1:05:13] on if you believe that the Holy Spirit
[1:05:17] the signs and wonders that he promised
[1:05:19] is being done here then accept it and
[1:05:22] hold on to it God's requirement I'm the
[1:05:25] Lord who heals all thy
[1:05:28] diseases when you receive the Holy
[1:05:30] Spirit get born again and the devil
[1:05:34] begins to tempt you oh you're wearing
[1:05:36] the same clothes you look like you used
[1:05:38] to but you are sure that something
[1:05:42] happened inside of
[1:05:44] you God changed your
[1:05:47] life don't make any difference what the
[1:05:49] devil said just get away from it because
[1:05:53] you're sure that is
[1:05:57] God
[1:05:59] amen amen means so be
[1:06:02] it I'm sure the holy spirit is here
[1:06:10] now I'm sure of
[1:06:13] it and I know that what we ask we will
[1:06:17] receive it it might not come just right
[1:06:20] now but it's got to come God promise is
[1:06:27] true we asked him for anything we don't
[1:06:31] doubt we believe that what we ask for we
[1:06:34] get because we met God's requirements
[1:06:38] giving our life to him surrendered our
[1:06:40] will to him our lives our soul all that
[1:06:43] we are we have surrendered to
[1:06:46] God then our heart condemns us not we
[1:06:50] can have what we ask for if ye abide me
[1:06:53] in my word and you ask what you will and
[1:06:55] it shall be done unto
[1:06:58] you that's his
[1:07:00] promise just be sure that you know God
[1:07:04] and know it that's his
[1:07:06] promise someone said to me many times
[1:07:09] brother said aren't you afraid brother
[1:07:12] brandom when you go there at night time
[1:07:14] that maybe that angel of the Lord might
[1:07:17] leave you sometime I said I'm sure he
[1:07:22] won't because because he promised me he
[1:07:25] wouldn't do it and I've got faith in God
[1:07:28] to believe it he'll meet that
[1:07:33] requirement that night at Portland when
[1:07:35] that Maniac ran out on the platform to
[1:07:37] kill me you've read the
[1:07:40] story you better be sure of it
[1:07:43] then but I was sure that I wasn't trying
[1:07:46] to speak of myself when he called me a
[1:07:49] snake in the grass and spit in my
[1:07:51] face and said to tonight I'm going to
[1:07:55] knock you all the way out into that
[1:07:58] audience and I just stood
[1:08:01] still he weighed 250 or more and I
[1:08:03] weighed
[1:08:05] 128 I had to look up to him those great
[1:08:07] big gantly arms and his teeth setting
[1:08:10] his eyes fist drawed back running
[1:08:13] towards me and the spirit of
[1:08:16] God said because you challenge the
[1:08:19] spirit of God tonight you'll fall over
[1:08:21] my
[1:08:22] feet that was God that wasn't me so he
[1:08:26] said I'll show you whose feet I'll fall
[1:08:28] over and he drew his fist back to hit me
[1:08:31] and when he did I said Satan come out of
[1:08:34] the man and he fell and pinned my feet
[1:08:37] to the floor to the policeman had to
[1:08:39] roll him off of my
[1:08:41] feet just be sure it's God and then hold
[1:08:44] on to
[1:08:46] it stay with
[1:08:49] it when God says anything he has to keep
[1:08:52] his word
[1:08:54] just be certain that it's
[1:08:57] God take God's word if God Whispers your
[1:09:01] heart I'm the Lord that Health thee stay
[1:09:04] with it that's God's
[1:09:07] promise God promises to give the Holy
[1:09:10] Spirit stay with it until it
[1:09:14] comes I was reading Old Uncle Buddy
[1:09:17] Roberson's book here some time ago and
[1:09:21] he was pling corn he said with his old
[1:09:23] mule
[1:09:25] elec and he got mad at elec that morning
[1:09:28] because she was tramping down the K and
[1:09:31] he bitter on the
[1:09:33] ears and she run off and looked at him
[1:09:37] and he said elec I'm ashamed that I bit
[1:09:40] you he said and look he he me preaching
[1:09:42] sanctification with the teeth full of
[1:09:44] mule hair he said what a
[1:09:48] disgrace and then he got ashamed of
[1:09:51] himself and he got down in in the roll
[1:09:54] of corn and said Lord if you don't give
[1:09:57] me the Holy Ghost when you come back
[1:09:59] you'll find a pile of bones laying here
[1:10:02] then he received
[1:10:04] it be certain it's God then hold on to
[1:10:09] it she was certain she'd walked up right
[1:10:12] before God and God proved it by inviting
[1:10:16] his Prophet to live with her see God
[1:10:20] confirms
[1:10:22] things so
[1:10:24] the morning was
[1:10:26] breaking the
[1:10:28] birds was beginning to sing as Dawn
[1:10:31] begin to
[1:10:32] break she looked at the little fell
[1:10:35] again and she patted him she knelt down
[1:10:38] and said Lord
[1:10:40] God he'll be getting up in a few
[1:10:43] minutes I'll go and prepare the last
[1:10:46] thing I
[1:10:48] got and give it to him and then I'll
[1:10:51] take him in my arms and will'll die
[1:10:56] together so she went and got the handful
[1:10:59] of meal now meal was a meal offering
[1:11:03] which means Christ the
[1:11:06] word and when they ground the meal
[1:11:08] offering in the days of the Bible they
[1:11:11] used a certain bur that ground every
[1:11:14] little bit of meal just exactly the same
[1:11:18] there was no difference in it well that
[1:11:21] types this the same means Jesus Christ
[1:11:26] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:11:29] when God ground his life out of him at
[1:11:32] the calvary he gave it to the church
[1:11:34] that he'd be the same yesterday today
[1:11:37] and
[1:11:38] forever then she goes and gets the orl
[1:11:42] the orl represents the spirit that's we
[1:11:45] why we anoint with orl it represents the
[1:11:48] spirit and she put the SP the oral and
[1:11:52] the meal together and begin to prepare
[1:11:55] it and when the spirit and the word gets
[1:11:58] together something's going to take
[1:12:02] place she was at the end so she got the
[1:12:06] word and the spirit and begin to mix it
[1:12:10] together now it's ready for
[1:12:13] bacon she goes out in the yard to pick
[1:12:16] up two
[1:12:17] sticks did you notice the Bible said two
[1:12:21] sticks now in the old days
[1:12:25] Jimmy I guess we've done it many times
[1:12:27] ourselves you take two sticks and cross
[1:12:29] them and you put the fire right in the
[1:12:31] middle and as the sticks burn you push
[1:12:34] them in if you're camping out at night
[1:12:36] it keeps the fire going all night long
[1:12:39] pushing it in the fire was in the middle
[1:12:43] if you notice the two sticks represented
[1:12:45] the
[1:12:46] cross self-
[1:12:49] sacrifice now should' mix the word and
[1:12:52] the the spirit together and was ready to
[1:12:56] put it to the
[1:12:59] fire and she goes to pick up these
[1:13:02] sticks and perhaps she just got the last
[1:13:05] one in her hand and was starting back in
[1:13:08] the house and she looked at the gate
[1:13:11] there was a gentl looking old man
[1:13:14] perhaps baldheaded and Whiskers hanging
[1:13:16] down standing leaned across the gate he
[1:13:20] said would you fetch me just a little
[1:13:22] drink of
[1:13:25] water she looked at him and thought
[1:13:28] well I've got just about a half a gallon
[1:13:32] in the
[1:13:33] house but the poor old fell looks so
[1:13:38] thirsty I'll be willing to divide with
[1:13:42] him and she might have said yes kind sir
[1:13:46] I will get you a little of the water
[1:13:49] because the Springs are dried up and
[1:13:51] everything all water dried up and
[1:13:56] she started in to get the water and he
[1:14:00] no you see God answers on both ends of
[1:14:04] the
[1:14:05] [Music]
[1:14:06] line about two hours before that the
[1:14:10] brook had dried up on top of the
[1:14:11] mountain where Elijah was he said
[1:14:14] Elijah go down to the city and keep
[1:14:18] walking until you find a woman with two
[1:14:20] sticks in her hand she's going to feed
[1:14:23] you
[1:14:24] God does things
[1:14:27] real I've sent you down there and she
[1:14:30] just go to feed you she hasn't got
[1:14:33] nothing in the house but I'm going to
[1:14:35] feed
[1:14:36] you and he walked down the street till I
[1:14:39] seen that woman packing those two sticks
[1:14:41] and that must be her so he had to catch
[1:14:44] her attention he said would you fetch me
[1:14:47] a little water and she said I will and
[1:14:50] she turned and started he said and just
[1:14:53] bring me a little Marshall of bread in
[1:14:55] your hand Elijah seeing that Vision
[1:14:58] already know what the conditions
[1:15:00] was and she said as the Lord
[1:15:03] liveth Elijah knew she was a Christian
[1:15:06] then or believer as the Lord liveth I've
[1:15:10] only got just a handful of meal and a
[1:15:13] spoonful of oil that I've already
[1:15:15] prepared I've dressed it got it ready
[1:15:19] and I'm taking these two
[1:15:20] sticks to make a little cake for my son
[1:15:23] and I and we're going to eat it and
[1:15:27] die see now here comes a great
[1:15:31] lesson but Elijah
[1:15:34] said bake me one
[1:15:38] first oh what is it there what lesson do
[1:15:41] we learn seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:15:44] God and his
[1:15:47] righteousness Bak me one first and she
[1:15:51] looked she he said I wonder who that
[1:15:55] is there's something about the
[1:15:59] man that seems to be
[1:16:03] different and he said break me one first
[1:16:05] and bring it and she started in to do
[1:16:08] what he said then she heard that
[1:16:10] comforting word that always Comforts for
[1:16:13] thus sayith the
[1:16:15] Lord the barel will not be empty and or
[1:16:19] the cruise run dry until the day that
[1:16:22] God sends rain on the
[1:16:24] earth what was it that very dark crucial
[1:16:28] moment come but God's always on the
[1:16:30] scene if you're sure that it's God if
[1:16:35] you've repented of your sins if you've
[1:16:37] met God's requirement then be sure that
[1:16:41] God will keep his
[1:16:46] promise if men and women could only
[1:16:49] realize
[1:16:50] that God's oblig ated to his promise and
[1:16:55] if you've met his requirements if you
[1:16:58] confessed your
[1:16:59] sins and you've made your wrongs right
[1:17:02] and you've done everything God has
[1:17:04] required then hold on to God you've got
[1:17:07] to see daylight he's got to bring it
[1:17:10] through just be certain that it's
[1:17:14] God and he'll take care of the rest of
[1:17:17] it if you're sure that it's
[1:17:22] God
[1:17:23] some time ago I was over at a little
[1:17:26] city in Arkansas about 15 years ago not
[1:17:30] quite that long I'd say 12 years
[1:17:33] ago I have a terrible segregation in
[1:17:36] Arkansas and I've been into a little
[1:17:38] church and the policeman helped me in
[1:17:40] and out and I was coming out of the
[1:17:43] church and I could hear someone saying
[1:17:47] Mercy
[1:17:49] Mercy I thought where is that coming
[1:17:52] from
[1:17:53] and I looked over to my left standing
[1:17:55] over to one side stood a a negro man way
[1:18:00] out from the white people he had his
[1:18:03] little cap in his hand hard Mercy
[1:18:08] Mercy and something struck me that man
[1:18:11] wants to talk to me and I said to the
[1:18:14] policeman I said I want to go over and
[1:18:16] see that man oh he said Mr brandom you
[1:18:19] can't do that you'd start trouble here
[1:18:22] in Arkansas
[1:18:23] said you can't do that he said we just
[1:18:26] can't let you do that I said but the
[1:18:28] holy spirit's telling me to
[1:18:32] go he said well brother brandom you'll
[1:18:34] start a race right so all these white
[1:18:36] people here to be prayed for and you go
[1:18:38] over there that color man I said I can't
[1:18:40] help what kind of laws you got I follow
[1:18:42] a law and that law is a law of the
[1:18:46] spirit and he said go to that man and
[1:18:49] I'll just pull loose from him and I went
[1:18:52] over there and I heard his wife say be a
[1:18:54] good courage honey The Parson is
[1:18:57] coming and I got over there I said how
[1:18:59] do you do he had his hands out like this

[1:19:18] a younger man than I thought you was him
[1:19:21] blind and he said has you got just a
[1:19:23] minute I want to tell you something I

[1:19:49] them off they done wrapped around the
[1:19:51] optical nerve and he couldn't take them
[1:19:55] off and he said I never heard of you in
[1:19:57] my life Parson Brandon but said last
[1:20:00] night about 9:00 I went to
[1:20:03] bed he said I dreamed I saw my old mommy
[1:20:07] come up to my
[1:20:08] bedside and she said to me honey rise up
[1:20:12] and put on your clothes and go down to a
[1:20:15] city called moark and have brother

[1:20:26] all my heart he said my own M never told
[1:20:29] me a lie in her life and I got up and
[1:20:32] put on my clothes and my wife helped me
[1:20:34] to the bus station and we went over to
[1:20:37] the auditorium and they told us you were
[1:20:39] here and we come over here and been
[1:20:40] standing here and it raining as hard as
[1:20:42] it could
[1:20:43] rain I looked at him I put my arms
[1:20:47] around him I said Lord God I don't know
[1:20:51] but somehow he
[1:20:54] certain and I'm certain that you let his
[1:20:58] old mamy come to him in a dream to tell
[1:21:00] him that he's going to get his sight and
[1:21:02] he's so sure that he's going to get his
[1:21:05] sight Lord God let it be now and I know
[1:21:08] more said that and he started batting
[1:21:10] his
[1:21:11] eyes he said Thank You

[1:21:16] said sure I can see said I know what I
[1:21:20] was going to see and his wife said said
[1:21:22] honey can you really see said sure you
[1:21:24] see that red car sitting there said sure
[1:21:27] I can see a great scream went up from
[1:21:30] everywhere and the people glorified
[1:21:33] God what was it he was certain that God
[1:21:37] had spoke to him in that dream and if
[1:21:40] God's certain by a dream how much more
[1:21:42] certain is he by his
[1:21:44] word be
[1:21:46] certain hold on to it God will bring it
[1:21:50] to pass let us pray
[1:21:56] Lord when I think of many of the
[1:22:01] experiences I don't know today where
[1:22:04] that man is thou
[1:22:06] knowest I may never have the privilege
[1:22:09] of looking at him again on Earth but no
[1:22:12] doubt sometime across the river
[1:22:15] y when we have both climbed the golden
[1:22:18] stairs into your
[1:22:20] kingdom I shall see him
[1:22:25] there because he was certain he couldn't
[1:22:28] read your word but you spoke to him by a
[1:22:31] dream and by his truthful
[1:22:34] mother and he was certain that his
[1:22:37] mother wouldn't
[1:22:38] lie and if you had sent him a dream of
[1:22:41] his mother he knew that he was sure that
[1:22:45] he was to getting sight I believe father
[1:22:48] that's the reason you gave it to him he
[1:22:50] moved from his bed he went into action
[1:22:54] he put his faith to
[1:22:56] work and you confirmed his faith by
[1:22:59] giving him his
[1:23:00] sight there are many sitting here Lord
[1:23:03] today many out in radio land that's read
[1:23:07] the word and heard the promises but has
[1:23:10] never been just sure of
[1:23:13] it God let him be certain
[1:23:17] today that if God has said so he has to
[1:23:21] keep that word right
[1:23:23] and sometimes he lets reaction come just
[1:23:27] to see what we will
[1:23:29] do May every person now that's both here
[1:23:33] and in The Invisible
[1:23:35] audience let them take a hold of your

[1:23:44] their
[1:23:45] unbelief and hold on to that promise
[1:23:48] until daylight breaks for them Grant it
[1:23:52] Lord may they be sure and certain that
[1:23:55] you will keep your promise every one of
[1:23:58] them for we ask it in Jesus name and for
[1:24:02] his sake
