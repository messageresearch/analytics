all Earth I long you be like all through [Music] life from Earth to Glory I [Music] what was he a man of sorrow acquainted with dream is that what he was he walked about among men dressed like other men he wouldn't know him from no one else but he could stand look up on the congregation and know what they were thinking about when he spoke it was words that you knew that it was coming from a true heart that really knew what he was talking about amen while the soldiers that come to see went said never a man spoke like this would you like to be like that or your words were so seized and they just took a hold to the people's hearts and grip them like that now you can be like him just get him in here is that right he'll make you humble and when someone smites you on one side face you say God like you I know you don't mean it when they pierce his hands and his Sid so forth he saids father forgive them they don't know what they're doing that was it forgiving humble Spirits that's the way we ought to be that's the way we got to be we ever make the Rapture now when you get like that I can say you're coming nine to the Holy Spirit Hebrews a great famous letter written by St Paul I believe what is the book of Hebrews now the letter of the Hebrews was Paul speaking to the the Hebrew Church separating law From Grace in The Book of Hebrews he was telling the Hebrew convert how that they want to continue on in the law and he told them what law was the grace let's read now this book was written in about um uh 80 uh 94 somewhere now far the law having being are having a Shad of good things to come the first Fe first phase of the first verse of the 10th chapter of Hebrews the law having a shadow of the good things to come now remember Abraham of course Abraham didn't live under the law Abraham lived under green how many know that as long for the law was given but Moses lived under the law David all those Liv under the law and all that the law provided was a shadow of the good things to come isn't that marvelous just being a shadow you remember one night last week we was teaching on Revelations 12 word of woman let's read it right quick turn for Revelations 12 and let's get it I think that's a beautiful background for this here to is sh and they appeared a great Wonder in heaven a woman what does a woman mean in the Bible Church a woman clo with the sun and the moon under her feet a woman a church cold with a bright light had raised and or lesser light was fading away see now the Moon is a shadow of the sun is that right see the the moon I've seen the moon through those great glasses out there I used mother used tell us about the Man in the Moon you've heard that you know what that is I looked at it two great powerful grasses it's Mountains and the Sunshine and Mak a shadow great crator nothing to grow on the moon it's just so hot in daytime it's my and at night time it's so many times below zero nothing could live and you can sit in that glass as if and stand out here a half a mile from you you see 120 million years of life space through that glass 120 million years how many miles would that be oh my now and the moon and when the sun has gone down the moon shines oh uh you call me the half hour anyhow but look I just see something moving look in the creation all things Heights and patterns sometime I get to preaching there have a few nights of this I just feel like I could just move on and on and on see just to see it I begin to jump up in front of you you know on the Holy Spirit bring and hang it up there for you see all the things of Shadows and types when God made the heavens and the Earth he made the the moon to shine in the absence of the sun to give light while the sun was gone see a beautiful type of Christ and the church the church is the Moon to give the light to the world while the sun is gone see what I mean a lesser light amen and then otherwise the moon and the sun is H husband and wife as Christ and the church is husband and wife the wife being the weaker vessel only gives a smaller light in the absence of her husband and the church can only make manifestations of the Holy Spirit and remember the moon cannot give any light of her own and when you see the Moonlight it's not the Moonlight it's a reflection of the sunlight and Christ the SE end it up is that right and shines his light on the church to reflect his light and power to the world in his ADD amen do you what I mean Genesis in the beginning now he sees the woman standing you look at her she's the woman you'll seen a few moments she's the Jewish Orthodox Church the wife of God the begotten and no is sent not to begotten she begotten of God sure but she's the wife and God had to put her away sometimes back there on account of spiritual fornications is that right and then he returned again and received her again and married her and said he was married to a back Rider is that right the wife that had gone away from him now what a beautiful picture this is to see this woman standing there and the moon under her feet and the sun shining at her head let's look at her just a moment now and see what she looks like and her feet and upon her head and upon her head a crown of 12 stars now what the stars do stars giv lesser light is that right well what does a star Shine from if I could walk out tonight and see that great bright star Little Star you sure are a beautiful thing what makes you shine like that well he to talk you say brother Bron I'm not shining well what's making you shine it's something shining on me see if the sun shining on me brother B I just help right up the path for you or then the true Pastor the pit if he's anointed of God it's not the pastor shining it's not him a good preacher it's not him a good pastor it's the Holy Spirit shining on him giving the gospel on amen amen you what I me just beautiful how it's all TI down now the woman had the moon under her feet the sun of her head and 12 stars in her crown the 12 apostles this Bible is built upon the doctrine of the Apostles and Christ the Chief Cornerstone amen that right the foundation of the Apostles now you see that woman this to begin with don't see 12 stars all right and see being with child trailing in birth came to be delivered now there's the Jewish Orthodox Church as the law is fading out the gospel is coming in and just as it's fading there's got to be a new dispensation so the woman is with child and she's in pain pain and travel pain being prevailing and child birth in other words the Roman Empire had her hover down just crying oh Messiah come oh Messiah come Messiah come here we see her again over here now as she's travailing bringing forth newborn babes in Christ Jesus coming come Lord Jesus come Lord Jesus amen and the prevailing in birth there pains to be delivered now watch what she did and that now he stops the rider does now he sees another scene comes on now watch the woman here ready to be delivered now the first thing the law was fading out that dispensation of them candles stick we had the other night distance from Satan coming in that was the law being a shadow of the good things to come amen just the shadow wish we had time to go into all the priesthood and show how everything in there shattered this dispensation here how everything happened back there was a shatter of it just the same as the sun is that's the reason people say I was a typologist I have to be I have any education so I have to look in the Bible I see back there what they was I know this about what this is going to be see I look back there and see if I see the moon shining I know it's a little light It's a Wonderful light but there's a greater light somewhere I know what the sun's going to look like when I see the moon amen I see what the sun's going to look like if I've never seen it if I see the moon and it's the shadow of the son I know what the sun's going to look like when it appears see what I mean now this woman was travailing she was sort of bringing forth a child and she was standing there the sun rising at her head the moon going under her feet the done passed away see she's done live through the dispensation of law all speaking see having the shadow of good things to come see just the Shadow the sun was the perfect now and the both can't shine the same time the law could hang but it won't shine because the gospel out Shin to see that's right the moon can hang here 12:00 to day you'll have to look very close to see it that's right because the sun's so much brighter till just out kind amen it may be still hanging there to show that it was last night but it's it's light's done gone that's the law the Law's light has done gone and live that's right now it's a gospel of dispensation of grace and the power of the Holy Ghost the resurrection of Jesus Christ manifest itself in a greater life I's look at this woman again just now and there appeared another wandering heaven and behold a great Dragon great red dragon having seven heads and 10 horns and seven crowns upon his head be taken that to the night look and his tail drew a third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them into the Earth you know what that was I tale wasn't like a for taale like you say the devil's God it was that pale that lie that he told and the Very Jews by the Roman Empire crucified the Lord Jesus and over two-thirds of the Jews denied Jesus Tri the Stars which was in heaven and watch what he did and he cast them to the earth and the Dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered to devour her child as soon as it was born now you say the dragon had something to do with the Jews certainly they said this Jesus says he's a king we have no King but Caesar that right see the devil preparing them Jewish Hearts back there to deny Jesus Christ when he comes can you see the devil denying Hearts today to deny the power of the Holy Ghost when he come amen just exactly the same yet honest and sincere but if they're deeply seek after God like some of them jeed did they will God out received him anyhow that's right they didn't care what the church said but it cast twoth thirds of them to the ground and the dragon stood before the woman to devour her child as soon as it was born now who stood what government what power uh stood before uh the woman the Jewish Orthodox Church to devour Jesus Christ when he was born Rome so the red dragon was Rome so you see where the beast that's to come out of Rome all right now watch and she brought forth a man child that was Jesus who was to rule all nations with the rod of arms what did the prophets all say Jesus to do when he come rule the nations with a rod of arm is that right they fail to see first coming to the Gentiles when he returns then he does rule All Nations amen he will come he is up on his throne now he's sitting on God's Throne amen he that overcomes shall set with me on my Throne as I have overcome and set on my father's Throne now he's wanting to come back and who where is his Earthly Throne the Throne of David God said he give him the Throne of David in the Millennium we'll sit on David's throne and we'll see the great king of kings setall there he is he's sitting on his father's throne in other words he's sitting in God's power in spirit now but when he comes back he'll set in an Earthly body Hallelujah on David's Throne now he's setting in the Majesty of father now when we say father it's Jesus it's the spirit of God by the holy spirit in us now he's on his father's Throne right hand of Majesty we use the body name Jesus Christ to appearer the Holy Spirit which is God whatever you ask the father in my name that will I do for I am my father alone you had a little W world see me no more that's the body will be taken away but you see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever now he will return in his body again and will set on a literal Throne a man that will eat and drink and take hands Glory oh my you say you're too emotional brother like make the emotion you can't hold yourself without I think of it how could you stand at a ball game or something you like feel well and just keep living you Feast how could you catch a great big bass about five pounds and all that big green your PL sure something's happen and when he really gets saved and filled with the Holy Ghost something happens when the word of God begins to manifest for we're setting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit teaching us and guiding us and setting us in order what a wonderful time now watch rule all nations of the r of arms and she brought forth a man child who was rot all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto God and to his throne I watch and the woman fled Into the Wilderness where she had a place prepared of God A wilderness the church now that she should be sped a, 203 score days which we we are on to Hebrews we'll get back on this maybe tonight all right to Pro you from the persecution of the church and all through those Dark Ages the people come over year what is America America was established at premis Rock for one purpose freedom of religion amen is that right and the Bible said that she fled from the dragon amen and had a place prepared in the what what was America when she come here see where she was nourished for a limited time a time time in the dividing just about 165 or 70 years where she had a place prepared and then this nation raised up and formed images to the Beast and spoke like the beast in to the confederation of organized Church religion now the church is getting so she can't have her Freedom no more to shut down that the holy ruler stop that stuff we unionize the thing make an organization and they what are they doing form an image to the Beast every time make a little power we are the Methodist we are the Baptist we're the nazares we're the Pentecostal we form our we got our own counsel of churches we got this he said Pentecostals yester the S of God the mest of all the Pentecostals belongs to the confederation of church he's just as much in the image of the Beast as they are amen as see Catholic we chop these Pentecostals up too the word of God says so see what I mean we can only be honest this is the truth brother because God not C I'm said it because he said it I'm just using his word just speaking it to you and the only way I know how to put it together I don't I just have to stand Here let him put it together and he gives it out and you receive it and then just take it now watch it Heap up and come that way just the same thing about healing or anything else it's God's spirit moving it just brings it right to pass now watch and the woman fled Into the Wilderness where she had a place prepared of God God prepared America for freedom of religion that she should be uh fed there 1,23 score days and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against the and his Angel the dragon who was the dragon Satan and what nation did it represent and he had Angels amen didn't the bible say that in the last days that the ministering spirits of the devil would be like flaming Angels amen but if they speak not according to this let him alone amen the devil would transform his his Messengers in angels of life and organize right back just exactly right Rome did brother sister I don't see where you can find a loophole in that God just got it all walled up there right here in his word there it is and he said it did now watch and Michael the Archangel the great one who stands in the presence of God and his angels fought against Satan and his Ang Angel the red dragon and that was the church that's led by the Holy Spirit and the angels of God fought against the organization and its angels and ministries of Life see how this perfect it a speaking not of something up into the glory is speaking of Spiritual Beings in Rome the red dragon is stood before the woman to devour her child now and they Prevail not neither was there found place in anymore for them in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceived the whole world that Roman to going into ever nation that City that rules over all the Earth he deceived it many churches organizing just like him making an image into the Beast and was cast out into the Earth and his angels were pass out with him say they don't have a conception of the scripture look when the AR enemy met Jesus Christ when he first met him he didn't go with him just roundabout way he met Jesus out there and he said now where's his reach his spot it's his stach right now because he's in fasting he said if thou be the Son of God I won't you to perform a miracle for him I know the scriptures and I want you to perform a miracle tell me that you're this with this miracle worker if you're the Son of God turn these stones into bread eat then I'll believe you now look at that same anointing on preachers today say if that guy's a Divine healer if that church believes in Divine Healing let let him let him heal this and I'll believe it see what it is it's a devil amen amen Jesus turned to him to the scripture said it's written that man shall not live by bread alone amen but you don't have to clown for the devil see and now watch The Devil said I think you I get him up on top of the temple he said now look you set up here on top of the temple not looking right over Jerusalem Now cast yourself down just before you get the ground then the angels will bury you up for it's written in the word yes sir he quoted scripture Satan did don't tell me them guys can't quote scripture you better know where you're standing amen yes sir fundamentally Z can be he said all right polish scholar but know sometimes no more about God than a hot and top know about Egyptian knife he said when he cast down like that said it's written he'll give these angels charge concerning if you're the Son of God now the Bible say the scripture says if you're the Son of God jump off this Temple because the Angels you got a hold of you all the times you can heal whatever you want to you can do whatever you want to because the Bible said so Jesus said yes and it's also written am shall not temp the Lord thy God Amen that's right oh my things that are getting this time man so look up here on top of this look here all these kingdoms there's United States of America's coming up G Mighty Nations here's Rome now here's all these nations around here here's Italy here's France here's Germany Belgium there's all these nations of the world the whole world over that their mind right that's who governs them the devil governs in the United States or you say all that or do the Bible said it did amen said these are mine said I do with them whatever I want to I'm quoting scripture J just never denied it he said I'll give him everyone to you if you'll just worship me right here if you'll say I'm right agree with me in the scripture you know I'm a teacher I have a big Seminary whole lot of angels out here and if you'll just agree with me I'll give every one to you let you be the ruler Jesus said get the hints Satan that's right don't tip me walked around there and Angels come and minister to him what is it Jesus knew that he was going to fall air to every one of them anyhow he's going to be air in the Millennium every nation of this world will be broken ground to pieces and Jesus Christ will be the king of the world Amen king of King Lord of Lord he couldn't rule in such a condition as that he's going to rule when peace Will Rule and reign in every heart and love without a li when Jesus child return to Earth again it's going to be his anyhow you didn't have to bow down to Satan no now what quickly and I heard a loud voice saying from heaven now is become Sal salvation now has become strength and the Kings uh Kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accuse them before God day and night and they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by their testimony all right and they love not their lives un death therefore Rejoice the heavens and ye that dwell on the in the earth W unto the inhabitations of the Earth for the and the Sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he has but a short time I see where he's roaring about so deceitful acting like a uh uh organizing itself up and bringing people and polish it up did you know where polish and all that first come from it originated by the devil Amen in the heavens where the devil the first thing he wanted was to make a kingdom that outshine Michael B watch Cain his son when Cain come into existence he fixed his order as it was on Easter morning with beautiful flowers fixed it all pretty and put the very polished fruits and laid that up the altar made everything so pretty he said surely God will receive that isn't it beautiful look at that same nature in church today see won't God receive us if I if our pastor has a a degree if he knows how to speak very fluidly good English and an eloquent speaking man won the best class of the city come to us look at our great sline look at our great crosses look at our fine Pew look at our thousands of dollars organ and look at all these things here that we' got and a nice polishing Arch beacons other businessman of the city surely they'll come to us the same old devil amen when God looked down he said there's nothing in it right and here come able ragged pulling a little lamp behind him with a great Vine wrapped around his neck laid him up on the Altar and talk the L begin to chop him back up and the blood begin to fly and the lamb blatantly crying God said that's it able amen that's it able to the shedding of the blood cleansing amen I feel like a Holy Roller this morning I really do notice back to Hebrews right quick the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very but and not the very image of the things not the see just the shadow of it not the very image of the things can never see not the very image of the same can never with those sacrifices they offered year by year continually make a make the come there to perfect now the Lord all having a shadow of the good things to come can never make the comer perfect now did the bible say that if that if the law could not make perfect then the Bible speaks that there can be a Perfection amen amen do you believe there is a Perfection amen let's turn to St Matthew the the 5th chapter I believe in a 40 and about the 48th verse and see if we can find that I believe that's about right if I take Matthew so I can read for you the 5 and 48 yes that's it just exactly Jesus speaking in the beatitude be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect how you going to do it be perfect as your father in and those sacrifices under the law could not make the comer perfect why now watch this a little while for then would not they had not have ceased if they make the perfect then did not have ceas kept on with the law see because that's the worshiper my did you read this look at here for the worshipper the Ley the worshipper once heard should have no more conscience of sin what's happened to you out there then what are you carrying on fussing with your neighbor about the Bible said the worshipper once heard has no more conscious of sin that's kind strong Doctrine is it now this week you haven't been fed on skin milk anyhow we've been in De V rich and you talk it very nice and I thank God for you I just want to come back teach some more to you see because you're able to take it see I notice the worshipper once heard so now the law couldn't do it but in this testate the said if the law could have done it then Jesus wouldn't had to die but here if the worshipper then he come watch you watch your a little part of but these sacrifices which a remembrance is made are sin every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sin why how much time we got oh my just a little bit we'll we'll close and we start up again tonight because I told you that quck look let's take it just in a little tight quickly the worshipper once heard has no more conscience of sin Jesus said be you perfect even as the father in Heaven is perfect here's the Old Testament out there the worshipper comes he knows he's done something wrong he goes out and hunts him a land with a spot that brings it to it washs in the lad brings in the high priest stand at the alt the priest then the high priest stands at the altar and he takes the lamb he examines it over there's not a blemish on it nowhere then the the Lamb's laid up on the altar the worshipper puts his hands up on the lamb and said I confess my sins that I I broke the Sabbath I done this day or the other I sinned I've done something wrong and the priest kills a lion catches the blood puts it over here and burns it as a sacrifice on the brass altar which means divine judgment as the smoke went up Israel fell on his knees and gave their prayers as it went up on the smoke of this burnt blood no blood on fire watch what takes place now this great pupo went to smoke up in all Israel and thousands of trumpets sound and every man dropped everything he had and went to prayer all right three times a day that was made the worshipper then went back out with the same desire in his heart maybe come in for committing adultery and he said Lord I did wrong I committed adultery I've got to die because you said if you sin you're going to die so this innocent lamb will die in my place so I offer you my lamb I paid my money for it so I'll come in and offer you my lamb and I confess my sin and this lamb has taken my place an innocent you I ought to die you was going to kill me but you told me if I get this lamb and let this lamb die in my place then I could go free then he cut his throat got his blood thr it on the brazing Divine alar of judgment and the blood the folk went up to God and God received it said I receive it the man walked right back out there with the same lust in his heart another that's right and this place where Jesus is the Lamb of God why the GM of life is in the bloodstream amen and that was an animal life and an animal blood had no conscience of sin certainly not so it wasn't strong enough because it knew not what sin was but when God came down into the blood cell that was in Mary's womb that created the BL of Christ Jesus that human blood amen was powerful enough to take the human heart and when the worshipper comes and puts his hands on Jesus head and confesses his sins and the lamb was killed and his name is written on the Lamb's Book of Life and God gives him the same Holy Spirit was in that blood and he confesses his sins on he has no more desire of sin amen amen hallelujah how the goel amen no more desire sin then the worshipper walked out with a clean heart the worshiper the law being a shadow but in Christ it was taken away he taken away the first so he could add the second he couldn't have you at the same time you can't have a law that says it's a $5 fine to run this street right out the next say you can go free you can't do it you couldn't put judgment so judgment is based upon something not upon a lamb upon Christ amen Christ the son of God who was God manifested in the p and The Germ of life that come into the womb of Mary that developed that cell C the cell that brought forth this body to shed blood down Us in order that God could be made blood and the Bible said we are saved through the blood of God Amen I used to say that I was saved by Jewish blood there was not one spot of Jewish blood in his body he was neither two genti he was God Amen there's not one drop of the mother's blood in a baby that's your doctor it's all wraps in the mother's blood but not the mother can it's got TB can die and child birth a TB in the baby taking for as long don't touch your breath it won't have TBS the the blood is in the mail a hand can lay but she hasn't name with the the rooster it'll never hat it isn't f it hasn't got any blood in it and that's just like many times I've said a lot these old churches around here you got a bunch of eggs all right but they're lay right there Rock unless they got the the born again and fill with the Holy Ghost and they got life they G or you say we got AIDS I know you have but what good is it doing you can hover with the gospel preach the Holy Ghost around they walk out say I don't believe that and Indiana and J for of it look over here when we having the healing service to Lord our preaching oh everybody likees to see the healing and the Miracles and so forth but I want to laying out the gospel walk out I don't believe no such stuff as that my church don't believe that there you are the mark of the beast amen you can't receive it you're blind amen they lay the gospel out tell them not the root God Earth have no life how you going put life those life in the male Christ Jesus brought life to the blood of God is that right brought the life of God down into the male amen hallelujah that's right Jesus Christ the son of God come down to bring life to the human race is that right amen and in him after his blood being shed and the Holy Spirit coming in the blood of Jesus Christ which was that blood cell when it was offered to Calvary it takes away the very desired sin amen so if you still have a desire of sin better come back to the alt again right now and that same life that was in that blood cell returns back into your blood sell and gives you the same life Jesus said I give to them eternal life amen now if you all interested in Greek words go look up see what the Greek word Eternal means it comes from the word zoee z o e look what Zoe is Zoe is a life of God himself and if Jesus through his death gave up his own life which was Zoe we have eternal life and can't perish amen hallelujah hallelujah when the old flesh begins to lust that a the spirit know now get your gospel Co on look Romans 81 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not answer the flesh but after the spirit amen thank you spirit give life amen let give amen what a beautiful lesson which we had time to continue while we will like look God required life the very first time sin was committed and if you notice the parent and Garden of Eden substituted animal lives you notice it but animal life went out and got sheep and killed him and they made garments to cover their sin up with is that right sheep skin let's take a little drama I've seen a picture not long ago that I like just not it's just mental picture I never seen it drawn I see our mother Eve and our father Adam and the colored man sitting there the Chinese sitting there this will shock you every human being the pygman in Africa the Bushman up in the trans ball the Heathen don't know what his right left hand his hair is sticking all over him like as wild as an animal he's got the same blood in his veins that you got the Chinese can go down and take the blood plasma and give it to a white man the colored man the same blood is in his veins as in the white man's veins they can give blood one to another but there's not one animal that can give a blood plasma why God has made of all Nations one blood amen exactly every one of us come over that same Tree of Life for almighty God Amen where you yellow brown black or whatever you are amen We Are One blood ask your doctor now if that's right amen white color no matter who you are brown or whatever you are don't make any difference Chinese Japanese negro whatever you may be don't have one thing to do with it you got the same blood and the same Jesus Christ died for one died for all the wall teaching to made us all one in Christ hallelujah what a message for that there Adam and Eve Eve beautiful woman oh my I see that ad that dark Shaggy lock hanger on his head those bright flashy eyes look over to his little sweetheart even such a perfect filt woman and her hair look up her eyes as blue as the sky Adam loved her oh how he loved her but when sin entered in the little home was broke up because an old rful Beast the devil had got into an animal called The Serpent not a reptile remember the Bible doesn't say that the devil was a snake he wasn't a snake in the beginning the snake wasn't like he is now in the beginning the curse put him where he's at the Bible said he was not a reptile he was a beast and the most subtle of all the beasts of the field he looked more like a man than anything you've ever had walked upright there's where the devil got him and come to eeve this beautiful maid woman and she did what was wrong pick your idea of it I got mine all right now then she brought forth her first son Cain the nature after the daddy a murderer a hater so forth notice them what taking place after that then when God came down to talk fellow ship had been broken could you imagine Adam and Eve sitting out in the garden of the evening under them great palm trees God will comeing out and say my children yes father is all well all is well have you enjoyed the blessings of your father this day yes Father we've enjoyed Here Comes Leo line up Leo Nows like a kitten head and Pats him on the head he kneels himself down here comes seed of the tiger and all them comes up lays down now around and God's Great voice roll through the top of them trees my creation have you enjoyed what your father has given you to say yes Father everything no death no sorrow there it is that's way God always this wonderful and then Michael looked and said I could do that too oh brother don't get yourself contrary to God's word I Mar these churches today I can make an organization to as good as they are get away from it says God's word yes but God God was the one speaking and then the first thing you know then when she s then God come down and Roars into the top of trees he wants to be worshiped he's God and his children wasn't there to worship here come Leo up and knelt down and here com sheo up and knelt down and all of them come up and knel down but words Adam he said CA have you seen Adam no Leo you no Adam where thou see the nature of a man he run from God it already been Adam say father I sin I've done wrong where are you I confess my sins where are you father but he was hiding get back behind the curtains Adam where th my boy Adam Adam my boy where are you you look down you seen stand behind the bues said come out said I can't of naked I told you you were naked he said the woman you give me and the woman said the serpent didn't there you are then the great picture of the fellowship was broken God can't talk to these people no more he's done said so when God speaks he's got to keep his words got to all right so I got to talk to you so God went over and got some sheep skins bought them old bloody sheep skins back show them back in the bushes and said put them on here come Adam and E wraps up in these old sheep skins they made them themselves a religion first they Jared a church somewhere thought they was going to get by with a fig Leaf chirt you know just hiding behind something but when they went to stand the presence of God their fig Leaf religion didn't hold out well here he comes out with BL running down over his manly shoulders look at little Eve let's draw a picture that pretty little thing Adam's sweetheart and why his darling and here she comes out and the blood running down her legs here's Adam and the blood running off of his shoulders I see around his collar here ramp around his shoulders the blood shagging in his hair look at little Eve her head bent down old bloody sheep skins walk out before God said Adam because you listen to your wife and instead of me I tuck you from the dust of your Earth and dust you'll return said woman because you listen to the serpent instead of your own husband see Church who you're supposed to listen to your husband not to some Creed but to your husband here's his word do you because you listen to The Serpent inste of your husband which I can say a little while so if you listen to The Serpent and S your husband you took life out of the world you will bring life in the world not multiply your sorrows and your conceptions your desire shall be to your husband serent because you did this offs your leg and you'll crawl on your belly all the days of your life you'll be hated by all and th shall be your meat oh my Something's Happened eight begin to come in Eve shoulders Adam's got a rheumatism in his back he begins to look look over e tears are running down her pretty cheeks her lips would never have to have manicure on them or what the stuff you put on now never have to have that on them they were all pretty and red but now they're turning out pale wrinkles are coming in them wrinkles are coming under her eyes ad paars begin to sip out chags begin to come here and Graves that go to set in tears are dropping off of his manly chest his chest is begin to sink in holla water conditioned Mart land little Eve know she was the cause of it said oh Adam what have I done darling I'm going to preach on that one of these nights what have I done she leaned her little head over on his shoulder D him along about this she said honey I'm the cause of it and we're condemned look at us we're turning back to the dust and God it he safe from us now we can't see him no more look at these old bloody I'm ashamed to take this off before you Adam he said darling I wouldn't take this off before you for nothing what's happened to his sun and he begins to cry the tears on off his own cheeks back on top of her head hear it run down their bosom like that mixing tears and blood running together so he put his arm around his little wife God said depart out of my presence sin he can't do nothing else he's God that's what makes his words so real he's got to keep his words amen matter how bad it hurt depart out of my presence Adam put his arm around his little wife like got he the start moving down to the Garden of Eden I can hear that old buy speak every time ad make a step one blood smacking against his legs as he walked on God there goes his boy there goes his girl this is seem as be my Billy Paul and Rebecca there they go your daughter and your son what can he do what can he do he's God he has to keep his word I pronounced death on him and I trusted him thought they wouldn't do it but they did it anyhow why did they do it then God conceived his thought he said I'll take their place I'll die their sin That's my boy I can't let him go like that that's my girl I'll die in his place said just a minute he said I'll put IM between thy seed and the serpent seed your seed shall bre the serpant said in other words I will overshadow a virgin someday and come down and be made flesh myself and I'll take the sinner's place man was made an image of God and then God was made an image of man to redeem man back to himself God taking his place that's how I know Jesus is God now let's change our scene 19 4,000 years has passed we're in Jerusalem this morning I hear a noise what is it I look outside sin and the Earth bath with wars and rumors of wars and blood adultery and sin and shame and disgrace of the all Springs of that couple look at just like Herod 70 of her boys and girls died on gism and prostitution from sin look at at Adam and Eve children how they're dying dying in that little weak blood down there somehow with a tone it's an animal's blood ain't got no life in it it can't come before God that life it goes out that blood it can't come because it's a dumb brute it's got to have some kind of a life that knows right from wrong God come down now in flesh under a virgin knows right from wrong now it's Jerusalem I hear a noise what is it oh away with him crucified why is it the very creator of the human race his own children crying for his blood they're God's Own creation crying for his own blood when I to held himself and would have done it it's child have been lost don't you see that's Jehovah from the garden of e since you seen there veiled in this human flesh oh my notice a little farther wish we get on this lesson a little farther down there it said that Tabernacle Solomon building a tabernacle but the most high dwth not in houses made of hands but a body has thou prepared me when Solomon built the temple Jehovah there's a good one Hallelujah that's C just right thank the Lord for that there's a revelation just fresh righty now you're going to get it when Solomon built the temple and it was dedicated God came into that Temple and dwelt there is that right and when Jesus Christ was dedicated to God on the river of Jordan God came down and in Jesus Christ jeh amen confession of sin always had to look to the temple confess sin has to look to Christ there's the temple of God God dwelt in Christ there he is now you believe Jehovah don't you thought of that before or sometimes when we're moving along in the spirit and setting Heavenly places how Christ can move in the church like that see how the revelations move there's a perfect Revelation coming from God he's setting up the platform now I know that come from there I know it did the temple was where God dwelt and the people anywhere in trouble like Jonah in the belly of the whale look towards the temple anywhere they look to this Temple and pray them out here and now the temple of God was not made with hand you said you prepared me a building but that wasn't it but a body has thou prepared me there it is God in Christ then I hear that howling mob who are seen look at him there they're crying for his blood his own children screaming out away with him their creator their God their maker their father away with him now he's become their redeemer now they reject me but see they don't know they don't know who I am they don't know that I'm the very one that pronounced this curse upon them down in the garden of be I've come down to redeem them if I if I if I refuse why I could speaking Legion of angels have come to me or if I would there going to be wrong and after all I was the one put the curse on them now I'm come to take the curse off of them let them to their crucify me here he goes draging through the street beat exactly hook him up to a post like this beat his ribs so it show through he is a little man the Bible said no Beauty we should desire him look at his body beaten ribbon bruised Moy spit from his own children spitting in their daddy's face crown a thorn on his head tears and things M running down his body tears and blood running together F droing off here he comes go look out the window and see what he looks like there he goes I hear old cross dragging down through the street making a roar bumping noise as it goes down for little bodies are moving and they're walking along with me with a whip you over we got our organization we got our churches we don't need you come around and fall us out about our church you making yourself the god of the Sabbath why you do something about it now you Holy Roller and the Very Creator moving along there in flesh there's that blood cell moving up it's bathing down his back he moves a little farther let's look I notice over his back he's got a roll thr across his shoulders and it's roll throughout without seeing and look all over that little Rob now little white Rob that becomes red spot it's that blood coming through his back where he was by Stripes were healed oh could I ad that God keep me mentally right I don't care if it cost my blood what

man come along help him bear the cross H it up on his shoulders he moves on he can hardly move now look at him as he goes as he's moving on all them little spots run into one big spot and that's why I

blood be against the leg the second Adam going to die for the human race God made Adam himself and living here on Earth going Young To Die For the human race the BR of bulls and goats cannot take away
