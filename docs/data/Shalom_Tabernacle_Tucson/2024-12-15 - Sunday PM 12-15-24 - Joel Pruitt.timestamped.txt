[39:48] turn to Psalms chapter 85 and verse 4
[39:52] Psalms 85 and 4

[40:20] verse4 turn us oh god of our salvation
[40:23] and cause thine anger toward us to cease
[40:25] wil thou be angry with us forever wil
[40:28] thou draw out thine anger to all
[40:30] generations wilt thou not revive us
[40:33] again that thy people may rejoice in
[40:36] thee show us thy mercy oh Lord and grant
[40:39] us thy salvation I will hear what God
[40:42] the Lord will speak for he will speak
[40:44] peace unto his people and to his Saints
[40:48] but let them not turn again to Folly and
[40:52] the next chapter is a very familiar
[40:54] Malachi 4 we're going to start with the
[40:56] first verse in Malachi chapter 4 we all
[40:59] may know this one by heart but just to
[41:01] lay a foundation here tonight Malachi 4
[41:05] and verse
[41:06] one say am man when you get
[41:09] it for behold the day cometh that shall
[41:12] burn as an oven and all the proud Y and
[41:15] all that do wickedly shall be stubble
[41:17] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[41:18] up sayith the Lord of hosts that it
[41:20] shall leave them neither root nor Branch
[41:22] but unto you that fear my name shall the
[41:24] son of righteousness arise with healing
[41:26] in his wings
[41:28] and ye shall go forth and grow up as
[41:30] calves of the stall and you and ye shall
[41:33] tread down the wicked for they shall be
[41:35] ashes Under The Souls of your feet in
[41:38] the day that I shall do this sayith the
[41:39] Lord of hosts remember ye the law of
[41:41] Moses my servant which I commanded unto
[41:43] him and for all Israel with the
[41:45] statues and judgments behold I will send
[41:48] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[41:50] of the great and Dreadful day of the
[41:51] Lord we can say this day this scripture
[41:54] is fulfilled amen and he shall turn the
[41:57] heart of the fathers to the children and
[41:59] the Heart of the children to their
[42:01] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[42:04] with a curse and you may be seated may
[42:05] the Lord add His blessings to the
[42:09] word now tonight I would just like to
[42:12] just to lay a background if you look all
[42:14] the way back to to Eden you could say
[42:17] that that was quite a Revival that was
[42:19] perfect Perfection was in Eden there was
[42:21] uh Adam was there and all the animals
[42:23] were there and then God saw that he
[42:25] needed someone
[42:27] he needed a helpmate so he sent him so
[42:30] he actually put him to sleep and he
[42:31] brought Eve from the very side of Adam
[42:35] which just lost this here
[42:40] there you want me to switch mics we're
[42:42] good all right so he he actually uh and
[42:45] I heard this said not too long ago and I
[42:47] thought it was good in the Garden of
[42:49] Eden God was creating an animal and he
[42:51] might take a a male monkey from the dirt
[42:53] and he'd take a female monkey from the
[42:54] dirt and yet he and he would go on so
[42:56] forth like that a male and female he
[42:58] would bring them from the dirt but then
[43:00] when he made man he made him in his own
[43:02] image and then when he made woman the
[43:04] bride he actually took her from the very
[43:06] side of himself and so we see that that
[43:09] was a type on down through the Bible you
[43:11] can find that and also if you study the
[43:14] message you'll find that there was a
[43:15] first Eve that would fall but there was
[43:17] a second Eve that would not fall aren't
[43:20] you thankful for the promises of God
[43:21] tonight and I'm just thankful that we
[43:23] are to have the promises held over us as
[43:26] the Bride of Jesus Christ Christ I'm not
[43:28] worried about falling away because I
[43:30] can't fall away and so tonight you may
[43:33] fall down you make make you're going to
[43:34] make mistakes you're human amen just as
[43:37] your pastor would preach this morning
[43:38] and and there's we might even be a
[43:40] guilty of many of those things here
[43:42] tonight and and the best we can do is as
[43:45] Christians is say Lord forgive me and
[43:46] and do better and get up and keep going
[43:49] but what we what we do is we've got to
[43:51] be real careful not to get down on
[43:52] ourselves and say well maybe I'm not
[43:54] bride because that's not even a thought
[43:56] in the Bride of Jesus Christ because
[43:59] this flesh may fall but the soul that is
[44:01] in you will never die can you say Amen
[44:04] tonight God has given you the authority
[44:07] in this age to to believe this word and
[44:09] to live this word somebody has got to be
[44:12] able to live this message or the message
[44:14] came in vain can you say Amen because
[44:16] God would not send you something and say
[44:19] this is the message for you to live and
[44:20] then say well there's nobody on the
[44:21] earth to live it no somebody had to be
[44:24] there and be created for such a time as
[44:26] this it is a season of blessings for the
[44:29] bride it is a season of Revival for the
[44:31] Bride of Jesus Christ it is a season it
[44:33] is our season it is the Bride season and
[44:36] so many times we may have all kinds of
[44:38] we may have all kinds of doubts that
[44:40] would come and like I was like I said
[44:42] Thursday night there's going to be all
[44:43] kinds of Mind battles and things that
[44:45] are going to attack us in our minds but
[44:46] none of those things move me why because
[44:49] I'm anchored by the message of the hour
[44:51] I'm anchored by the word that is coming
[44:53] my day and I don't just believe it but
[44:55] I'm going to stand on it I'm going to
[44:56] live it to the best of my ability by the
[44:58] seed that is on the inside of me I can't
[45:01] help but follow the message of the hour
[45:03] how about you tonight and so if we go on
[45:05] down brother Brandon would talk about
[45:06] Revival and and I was thinking about the
[45:08] Garden of Eden and the Garden of Eden
[45:10] was in one Big Revival they had
[45:11] everything they had they had every herb
[45:13] of the field they had every tree and
[45:15] every fruit and they could walk in peace
[45:17] with the animals and there was nothing
[45:19] there there was nothing to harm them it
[45:21] was Perfection it was a real Revival why
[45:24] because it was the original Revival it
[45:26] was perfect but then come along doubt
[45:28] and anytime there's doubt and if you let
[45:30] that doubt really get a hold of you it
[45:32] may take you farther than you thought it
[45:34] would and if you let that if you if
[45:36] you'll actually give in to that devil
[45:37] that tries to talk to you then that
[45:39] Devil's going to take you farther than
[45:41] you really ever thought he could well
[45:43] I'm a good person but there's got to be
[45:45] something anchoring you to more than
[45:47] just being a good person it's actually
[45:48] got to be something in this message that
[45:50] says I'm going to believe what a prophet
[45:52] said regardless of how I feel I'm going
[45:54] to believe what a prophet said
[45:55] regardless of what soul so said about a
[45:58] prophet I'm going to believe this
[45:59] message regardless of what the critics
[46:01] say I'm going to believe why because I'm
[46:04] a Believer and a Believer can't help but
[46:06] believe this word so I'm here tonight to
[46:08] not try to bring you a new message but I
[46:10] want to tell you look back to the
[46:11] message of the hour because that is the
[46:13] restoration message that is what is
[46:15] going to bring you into Revival in this
[46:18] day it's not a man's Revival but it is a
[46:20] word Revival brought on by a prophet of
[46:22] the hour so if you look there in Malachi
[46:24] 4 remember it wasn't just saying there
[46:27] will be another great healer coming
[46:28] along or there would be another great
[46:30] evangelist coming along or another great
[46:32] prophet come but it would be the Elijah
[46:34] that would come and restore all things
[46:36] and restore you back to the faith of the
[46:39] original Pentecostal fathers it is more
[46:41] than just an idea is more than just an
[46:44] opinion but it is the word of God a lot
[46:46] of churches are built on man's opinion a
[46:48] lot of churches are are built on on all
[46:50] kinds of different men's ideas and
[46:52] doctrines and and I would say it tonight
[46:54] that there's many of them who have got
[46:56] doctrines in the church church and and
[46:57] they've got Creeds in the church and
[46:59] while they're good people that is not
[47:01] the word that we're following today but
[47:03] they'll call us crazy and they'll call
[47:04] us Fanatics and they'll say well they'll
[47:06] just following a man but what we're
[47:07] really following is the Bible what we're
[47:09] really following is the message of the
[47:11] hour and so what they're looking at is
[47:13] they see a man standing there but we
[47:15] didn't see a man we saw prophecy
[47:17] fulfilled in our day and we're looking
[47:20] past the veil of Flesh and we can see
[47:22] God in a man that is coming our day amen
[47:25] so I'm not looking at the man you can
[47:26] point out mistakes you can point out
[47:28] whatever you want to but I'm not looking
[47:29] at the man I'm looking at the word that
[47:31] has been fulfilled in my day I love the
[47:34] man I love the messenger I love the
[47:36] prophet but more than that I see a word
[47:38] that is coming my day and when you get a
[47:40] revelation when the church when the true
[47:42] church get a true revelation of the
[47:44] message that has come nothing can shake
[47:46] you away from this message nothing can
[47:48] take you out of this message well can
[47:50] you just preach with me for a little bit
[47:51] tonight we are more than able to stand
[47:53] on this message because brother John
[47:55] it's not you standing for a message but
[47:57] something on the inside of you took a
[47:59] stand for this word because there was
[48:01] something that reached out to you and
[48:03] grabbed a hold of you you may not have
[48:04] been looking for the message but the
[48:06] message found you you may have been in a
[48:08] Pentecostal church or or any
[48:09] denominational church but the message
[48:11] found me in in my lowest condition the
[48:14] message found me I've told people this
[48:16] before when I was about 17 years old my
[48:19] dad passed away and I I I I really
[48:21] couldn't I didn't have a revelation of
[48:22] what the message really was I knew
[48:24] brother Brandon was a good man and I
[48:25] knew that he was a real Prophet because
[48:27] of the things he did but I was looking
[48:29] at the wrong thing I was looking at the
[48:31] signs and they said well he never missed
[48:32] well that's good but all these other men
[48:34] claimed to have this tear but I failed
[48:36] to see the message that followed the
[48:38] sign and so I started looking and I went
[48:40] to a UPC Church and I know that's awful
[48:43] to admit but I went and I heard the
[48:45] first service there a man got up and
[48:47] preached on the initial evidence of the
[48:48] Holy Ghost being speaking in tongues
[48:50] there was something on the inside of me
[48:52] that wouldn't accept that nonsense there
[48:54] was something on the inside of me said
[48:57] that's wrong they could outshout me they
[48:58] could out speak in tongues they could
[49:00] outrun the aisles but nothing inside
[49:02] nothing there would actually feed my
[49:04] soul and something on the inside of me
[49:07] said you know better than that you know
[49:09] that there's a real word you know
[49:10] there's a real message trying to don't
[49:12] be trying to run away from it but you
[49:14] can run but the message is going to
[49:15] bring you back so I'd say tonight if you
[49:17] got children that have walked away if
[49:19] you've got children that have left you
[49:21] don't you worry about them hold that
[49:22] Faith over them and that seed on the
[49:24] inside of them we'll bring them back to
[49:26] the message of the hour nothing can take
[49:28] you out if there's something on the
[49:29] inside to hold you can you say Amen
[49:31] tonight so there was a brother Brandon
[49:34] would go on to say this now there is
[49:35] Cycles to Revival there's cycles and so
[49:39] brother one of the Cycles is a cycle of
[49:40] Revival and then death amen so you'll
[49:43] see a church they get on fire and
[49:44] there's different types of revivals
[49:45] brother man talked about a national
[49:47] Revival the national Revival he said
[49:48] they turned it down in 1956 and it's no
[49:51] longer a national Revival there will be
[49:53] no more Revival for the nation as we see
[49:55] it but then there's a person Al Revival
[49:57] and this personal Revival is something
[49:59] more than just a feeling but it is a
[50:01] word that is growing on the inside of
[50:03] you and it is actually making
[50:05] powerhouses out of the Sons and
[50:06] Daughters of God it is making men live
[50:08] the message and women dress like they
[50:10] should in the message it is making
[50:12] people that that couldn't live it on
[50:14] their own but the word on the inside of
[50:16] them is living out through them they
[50:17] were they are living Epistles read of
[50:19] all men we can look at a message
[50:21] believer and there's just something
[50:22] different about a message believer we're
[50:24] not just Pentecostals coming in here to
[50:26] have a good time although I believe in
[50:28] having a good time in the house of God
[50:30] but that's not all there is to it we've
[50:31] come here to feed on the word of God we
[50:33] we listen to the tapes not just to hear
[50:35] a man but to hear the word of God for
[50:37] our generation it's not just something
[50:40] to make us different but it is something
[50:42] to change our bodies and take us into
[50:44] Rapture see this message didn't come to
[50:46] just make us live different on this
[50:47] Earth but it's going to make us all the
[50:49] way different all the way through listen
[50:51] if you're one of his you can't be lost
[50:54] and if you're one of his and you come up
[50:56] in that day if you happen to go by way
[50:58] of the Grave you're going to come up
[50:59] with those Saints why because there's a
[51:01] there's a general Resurrection there's a
[51:03] resurrection for you and then there's a
[51:04] Rapture for the living and I'm here to
[51:06] say tonight I ain't missing it I'm not
[51:08] going to be here when the bombs fall I
[51:10] believe the message and the message is
[51:12] inside of me so you can go ahead and
[51:14] call me crazy but when he calls me I'm
[51:17] just call me gone because I'm going to
[51:19] be living leaving this world I'm here to
[51:21] tell you tonight that I I don't want you
[51:23] to look at the message as just another
[51:24] set of rules no you can't help but live
[51:26] the message if it's on the inside of you
[51:28] the pastor don't have to get up every
[51:30] service and and correct the way a lady
[51:31] dresses If the message is on the inside
[51:33] of you you know the the the law is for
[51:35] the law Breakers amen amen but Grace is
[51:37] to those that'll actually they want to
[51:39] do right and and there's Grace for you
[51:41] that want to overcome there's grace to
[51:43] you that want to live this message I
[51:44] know the devil's fighting you I know the
[51:46] devil's in your minds and I know the
[51:48] devil will fight that flesh because it's
[51:50] an unconverted part but he can never
[51:52] touch the soul and me he don't even have
[51:54] the keys to his own house so don't let
[51:56] the devil tell you that you're not more
[51:58] than a match for him don't let the devil
[52:00] tell you that you're not an overcomer
[52:02] you are more than enough to overcome
[52:05] this
[52:06] devil more than able more than able when
[52:09] the devil tries to steal your joy you go
[52:11] ahead and tell him listen devil you
[52:13] ain't got no hold on me you can't hold
[52:15] my hands down in the house of God you
[52:17] can't cause me to St there and be bored
[52:19] with the word of God no the word is what
[52:21] is Reviving me in this end time it is a
[52:24] word Revival let's get back to my notes
[52:27] and see if I can get through this but
[52:29] tonight we're not looking for just a
[52:30] feel-good Revival although we ought to
[52:32] feel good in church there's no reason to
[52:34] hang our heads down in church we ought
[52:36] to be the most happy and blessed people
[52:38] on the face of the Earth to know what we
[52:40] know if this word ain't enough to make
[52:42] you happy then nothing's going to make
[52:43] you happy because we have the full
[52:45] restored word and so brother Brandon
[52:47] would go on and he talks about the
[52:49] nation not having
[52:50] Revival but he but he goes on down and
[52:52] he says this and and he says you know he
[52:54] said the fields has been already reaped
[52:56] burnover this is 1961 and he said you
[52:59] pick up a stock once in a while but very
[53:00] few so there's very few coming from a
[53:02] national Revival that's why you may go
[53:04] overseas and I I know my brother's been
[53:06] to Africa there as well and you'll see
[53:08] people still coming to the Lord and it
[53:09] seems like there's a little bit more of
[53:11] a Revival fire there than there is in
[53:13] America and it's I I often think it's
[53:15] because of the distractions we have over
[53:17] here because of you know we have so much
[53:19] access to TV and internet and we have
[53:21] access to money and we have access to
[53:23] whatever we want to but it's a
[53:25] distraction from the m thing in your
[53:27] life if anything has first place over
[53:29] God in your life I say lay that thing
[53:31] aside you say what is it that's an idol
[53:33] that has taken up your time that is that
[53:35] is a God to you well can you say Amen
[53:37] tonight that is that is taking if your
[53:39] phone is taking up more time than you
[53:41] spend in church or or or you spend
[53:43] reading your Bible or or more time than
[53:45] you do hearing the tapes I say lay that
[53:47] thing aside for a while and fall in love
[53:49] with Jesus again find out what it's like
[53:52] to be in Revival again well you say well
[53:54] if the church was in Revival I'd shout
[53:56] more you be the Revival in Shalom
[53:58] Tabernacle you go ahead and lay down the
[54:01] things that are besetting you the
[54:02] besetting sins and the things that are
[54:04] harm in you you be the Revival here
[54:06] tonight and watch the Revival fire
[54:08] spread anden you put a you put a good
[54:10] hot log that's got fire on it and with
[54:12] some other logs and the next thing you
[54:13] know they all catch on fire amen so
[54:15] that's a personal Revival and and if
[54:17] you're really in Revival you can't help
[54:19] you can't help but look around and see
[54:20] other people start feeding off of that
[54:22] Revival and but what we'll do is we sit
[54:24] there cold and dead it's 12:00 and like
[54:26] a mule looking at a new gate and we're
[54:28] sitting there looking at the preacher
[54:29] saying preach is Happy preacher and the
[54:31] preacher's preaching the word to you and
[54:33] that ought to be enough to make you
[54:34] happy well come on Church there's no
[54:36] reason to think that the preachers needs
[54:39] to be more on fire but I need to be on
[54:41] fire for the message of the hour I need
[54:43] a Revival your pastor said it this
[54:45] morning we don't want to just see a new
[54:46] church but he wants to see the church in
[54:48] Revival he wants to see the fire burning
[54:50] in the hearts of people again when he
[54:52] opens them doors on Wednesday nights he
[54:53] wants to see people that can't wait to
[54:55] get there when he opens the doors on a
[54:57] Sunday night he wants to see people who
[54:59] can't wait to walk in them doors why
[55:01] it's not to hear the preacher it's not
[55:02] to hear a tape but what it is it is to
[55:04] meet with God and let the Revival fires
[55:07] burn again well come on somebody this is
[55:09] not just another church but this is a
[55:11] church where the word is being preached
[55:13] and this is a church where the message
[55:15] is being raised up as the standard let
[55:17] us be the standard today and let the
[55:19] message live through us let us preach
[55:22] the word and if you preach the word I
[55:23] believe that it will come back amen if
[55:25] you cast your your bread on the water
[55:27] it'll come back and I I hear I I say
[55:29] tonight your pastor is going to preach
[55:30] the word regardless of your response but
[55:32] you might as well go ahead and let him
[55:33] enjoy it once in a while amen sometimes
[55:36] when you're standing up here and you're
[55:37] preaching your heart out and and you say
[55:39] well oh me well go ahead and make that
[55:40] thing right and back the preacher for a
[55:42] minute well come on somebody go ahead
[55:44] and make that thing right and say Amen
[55:46] to the word of God once in a while
[55:47] sometimes that amen is enough to drive a
[55:49] devil out of you sometimes that amen is
[55:51] enough to say I'm on this side and I'm
[55:54] saying Amen to the word of God look at
[55:55] me devil you ain't got no hold on me
[55:58] just because you had a hold of my mind
[56:00] and just because you you caused me to do
[56:02] things I'm ashamed of the devil has no
[56:04] hold on this bride there is no chains
[56:08] holding you the message is not a bondage
[56:10] to you but it is freedom in the Holy
[56:12] Ghost to you why because it is the
[56:14] message the message is not just a it's
[56:17] not just a quotebook and it is not just
[56:19] a book and a tape but the message is
[56:21] actually the word of God living in The
[56:23] Bride of Jesus Christ and your pastor
[56:25] standing here he he can stand here and
[56:27] he can read quotes and and and and he's
[56:28] not just reading the quotes just to just
[56:30] to say look who I'm following no he's
[56:32] reading the quotes cuz he believed the
[56:33] quotes and he believes this message and
[56:36] I I promise you a man that is gifted
[56:38] could go preach and make money somewhere
[56:39] else but he didn't sell out to money he
[56:41] didn't sell out to fame but he's
[56:43] standing here preaching to a little
[56:44] group in Tucson because he cares for
[56:47] your soul and he wants you to follow the
[56:49] message of the hour not because it's a
[56:51] man because it is Christ it is the word
[56:54] today I hope this is all right brother
[56:56] Israel but I'm just here to tell you
[56:57] tonight that the message still works and
[56:59] the message still changes lives and the
[57:01] message is still on fire just because
[57:03] you might feel cold the message ain't
[57:05] cold the message is still very much
[57:08] alive I believe there's just as much
[57:10] power in the word tonight that was
[57:11] spoken in 1947 1955 1965 all the way
[57:16] through I believe every one of the tapes
[57:17] of brother Brandon was standing there
[57:19] physically and he might be able to stand
[57:20] there and and with the gift of God tell
[57:22] you things but the same God is here
[57:24] tonight if you have need of anything
[57:26] thing he is still here the message is
[57:29] still
[57:30] alive so what we need tonight do we need
[57:33] a Revival how many needs a Revival every
[57:36] one of us need a Revival I need a
[57:38] Revival it's a personal Revival to me
[57:40] because the message the message is here
[57:43] the Revival is here but I've got to
[57:45] participate in the Revival that has come
[57:48] so I believe it's a restoration message
[57:50] I believe is to restore restore
[57:52] everything can you say amen I don't
[57:54] believe it was just a partial
[57:55] restoration I don't believe this message
[57:57] came to say well some people's going to
[57:58] shout no we had that with Pentecost some
[58:00] people's going to speak in tongues we
[58:02] had that with Pentecost and that's part
[58:03] of it but that wasn't all of it well can
[58:05] you say man amen if that if part of it
[58:08] was okay you could have been a Lutheran
[58:09] If part of it was okay you could have
[58:10] been a Wesley and if part of was okay
[58:12] you could have been a 1906 Pentecostal
[58:14] but there was a fullness of the
[58:16] restoration to come and it came to a
[58:18] bride that was willing to accept it can
[58:20] you say Amen brother brandham says it
[58:22] here brother bam talks about uh The
[58:25] Awakening of the bride and I like how he
[58:27] says it here he and then the third seal
[58:29] 1963 he says he says now that's the
[58:31] reason today that the revivals that
[58:33] we're supposed to have we have
[58:34] denominational revivals we have had we
[58:36] haven't had a real stirring no sir don't
[58:38] think we've got revivals we haven't oh
[58:40] they got millions and millions of of
[58:41] church members but not a Revival nowhere
[58:43] the bride hasn't had a Revival yet now
[58:45] the world calls building churches a
[58:48] revival can you say Amen the Revival
[58:51] would or the world would call a Revival
[58:54] having a a church full building a bigger
[58:57] Church to to hold the people the numbers
[58:59] is a Revival but that is not what a
[59:01] prophet would call a Revival a prophet
[59:03] never called that a Revival matter of
[59:04] fact he would say they've got more
[59:05] members than they've ever had but they
[59:07] are dead than they've ever been they're
[59:09] quieter in church and listen if they got
[59:11] programs for the kids it'll hold the
[59:13] kids if they've got if they got certain
[59:15] events going on it'll hold them but
[59:16] we're not here for that the social
[59:18] aspect of it we want Fellowship we want
[59:20] to love one another and we should we
[59:22] should always come together and love one
[59:24] another brother R talked about the
[59:25] Tabernacle being so in love he said that
[59:27] when they'd leave on Sunday night that
[59:29] they couldn't wait to get back on
[59:30] Wednesday night because because they had
[59:32] such fervent love for one another I
[59:34] think that's the way we ought to be but
[59:36] we ought to more than that want to come
[59:37] back here and meet with God on his terms
[59:40] you say on his terms yeah because he
[59:42] said that you'll come here and he said
[59:44] you'll sit together in Heavenly places
[59:46] and and you'll actually feed on the word
[59:47] of God where the carcass is the Eagles
[59:49] will be gathered and and also he would
[59:51] say things like this and I just believe
[59:52] that the Bible and the message are are
[59:54] kind of the same Authority in my heart
[59:56] and I hope it is to you but the
[59:57] messenger would come and say if God is
[59:59] in your heart you can't wait for them
[1:00:01] doors to open out yonder well can you
[1:00:02] sayen so if we can get God in the hearts
[1:00:04] of the people you don't have to beg
[1:00:06] people to show up to church but the
[1:00:08] people will come to church what we need
[1:00:10] is Revival church I believe there's Holy
[1:00:12] Ghost filled people sitting at home
[1:00:13] tonight but they need to be revived and
[1:00:15] what's already inside of need to be
[1:00:17] awakened Again by the word of God come
[1:00:19] back to the word of God live the word of
[1:00:22] God it's later than you think let's go
[1:00:24] ahead and get ready for a rapture
[1:00:26] brother Brandon would go on and he would
[1:00:28] say it like this he said' now he said we
[1:00:30] haven't had Revival the bride hasn't had
[1:00:32] Revival yet see there's been no Revival
[1:00:34] no manifestation of God to stir that
[1:00:36] bride yet we're looking for it now it'll
[1:00:38] take those seven unknown Thunders back
[1:00:40] there to wake her up again see I'm not
[1:00:42] preaching the thunder so don't get
[1:00:44] scared but I'll say what a prophet said
[1:00:46] is that okay you know the Thunders are
[1:00:49] are okay if you're saying what a prophet
[1:00:51] said it was a man's opinion that made
[1:00:53] the Thunder Doctrine wrong amen it it's
[1:00:56] an opinion of a man that'll that'll form
[1:00:57] a Doctrine and call it whatever they
[1:00:59] want to call it and then that's what
[1:01:00] makes it wrong but what when you're
[1:01:02] saying what a prophet said I can say
[1:01:04] Amen to it amen and so brother Brandon
[1:01:06] would go on down the exposition and in
[1:01:08] the later see in church age he would say
[1:01:10] now this messenger of Malachi 4 and
[1:01:11] Revelations 10:7 is going to do two
[1:01:14] things one according to Malachi 4 he
[1:01:16] will turn the hearts of the children to
[1:01:18] the fathers and two he will reveal the
[1:01:20] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:01:22] Revelations 10 which are the revelations
[1:01:24] contained in the the Seven Seals well
[1:01:27] can you say amen I hope that's okay
[1:01:29] tonight so you're going to see that a
[1:01:30] prophet is coming to wake up a bride
[1:01:33] well I hope this is okay we'll go on
[1:01:35] down with some quotes and we'll lay it
[1:01:36] in there now there was still healing
[1:01:38] campaigns going on when brother bam said
[1:01:39] this there was still Revival in the land
[1:01:41] according to the nominal church when
[1:01:43] brother brandham said this there was
[1:01:44] still uh there was still men with their
[1:01:46] big tents going around and and having
[1:01:48] all kinds of numbers in there and
[1:01:50] brother Billy Graham would go and still
[1:01:51] fill up stadiums at this time there was
[1:01:53] still people showing up for Revival now
[1:01:55] it may not have been what it was 20
[1:01:56] years prior to that but there was still
[1:01:59] uh there was still an urgency in the
[1:02:00] land for a Revival but what they missed
[1:02:03] was the word that would come with the
[1:02:05] message and so brother BR would go on
[1:02:07] down here and he's talking in 1964
[1:02:09] recognizing your day and its message he
[1:02:11] would say everywhere now there's no
[1:02:13] Revival everybody's complaining
[1:02:14] ministers crying and he was talking
[1:02:16] about he's reading uh The Herald of his
[1:02:18] coming ma magazine he said one of the
[1:02:20] finest papers on the field The Herald is
[1:02:22] coming but they hardly will print
[1:02:23] anything unless it's about fast pray
[1:02:25] fast pray sound a trumpet how many reads
[1:02:27] it he said you know you see it all the
[1:02:29] time fast pray fast pray it's all you
[1:02:31] hear and these are good things the
[1:02:33] prophet is not saying not to fast and
[1:02:34] he's not saying not to pray but it's all
[1:02:37] they were looking for was just the the
[1:02:39] feeling of it or or the prayer of it or
[1:02:41] the fasting of it and they're missing
[1:02:43] something the prophet goes on and says
[1:02:44] this he says you see it all the time and
[1:02:46] he goes on down he says now he said
[1:02:48] we're going to have a great breaking of
[1:02:50] the day there is a great thing going to
[1:02:53] happen all of you pray pray pray we're
[1:02:55] not too late yes see why did they do
[1:02:57] that why did they do that they want a
[1:02:59] Great Awakening and they're crying and
[1:03:01] believing that there will be an
[1:03:03] Awakening well can the church say Amen
[1:03:05] this is a quote now and we're still in
[1:03:07] recognizing your day in this message he
[1:03:09] said now they're good people why is it
[1:03:11] what have they done they have not
[1:03:13] recognized The Awakening of the Bride so
[1:03:16] what they did they were still looking
[1:03:17] for the signs and they were still
[1:03:19] looking for something to come but they
[1:03:21] missed what God was doing right there in
[1:03:22] their midst they missed the main thing
[1:03:25] why because they're looking for an
[1:03:26] emotion and they're looking for a
[1:03:28] sensation and they're looking for
[1:03:29] something to make them feel different
[1:03:31] but the word had come and woke up the
[1:03:33] bride it was calling out the bride and
[1:03:35] restoring her back just like the prophet
[1:03:37] said he would do in Malachi 4 so brother
[1:03:41] Brandon would go on and brother Brandon
[1:03:43] would say it like this he said now
[1:03:45] history keeps repeating itself in the
[1:03:47] generations of Israel we see Revival
[1:03:49] this in a different sermon I'll have to
[1:03:50] get it down here in a second he said
[1:03:52] it's a different Revival in one
[1:03:53] generation only to see the fires fading
[1:03:55] in the next how many's ever seen that in
[1:03:57] a message Church you'll see a man that
[1:03:59] come to the message and maybe they come
[1:04:01] out of something and they're they're on
[1:04:02] fire for God but their kids are there
[1:04:04] because they're there and their
[1:04:05] grandkids are there because they're
[1:04:07] there and and I'm not I'm not condemning
[1:04:09] third and fourth generation Believers
[1:04:10] but you've all you all have to have your
[1:04:12] Revival brother brandham said every
[1:04:14] generation has its chance at the word
[1:04:17] can you say amen and so in the third
[1:04:19] generation Embers May glow be glowing
[1:04:21] slightly but in the fourth there may be
[1:04:23] no vestage whatsoever of that original
[1:04:24] flame then God lights the fire again and
[1:04:27] the same process is repeated it is
[1:04:30] simply the manifestation of the truth
[1:04:31] that God has no grandchildren well can
[1:04:34] you say amen and so salvation is not
[1:04:37] passed on by natural birth any more than
[1:04:39] there is any truth to Apostolic
[1:04:40] succession it isn't in the word you
[1:04:42] start out with truly Born Again
[1:04:43] Believers and when the next Generation
[1:04:45] comes along they're no longer just
[1:04:47] playing Christians but they have to take
[1:04:49] it they have taken a denominational name
[1:04:51] and are now Baptist Methodist Etc and
[1:04:53] that is exactly what they are two so
[1:04:56] you'll see denominations and they'll and
[1:04:58] they'll they say look at the numbers we
[1:05:00] got but the problem is their fires have
[1:05:02] already flamed out and it is be what the
[1:05:04] grandparents had or the great
[1:05:06] grandparents had there's nothing left
[1:05:08] but a form of godliness in the
[1:05:10] grandchildren and if we're not careful
[1:05:12] in the message you'll teach your kids
[1:05:13] that God sent a prophet but them kids
[1:05:16] need the baptism of the Holy Ghost our
[1:05:18] kids need a chance at the word our kids
[1:05:21] need to know that just believing in a
[1:05:23] prophet is not enough but to follow the
[1:05:25] word and B ISM follow the word in a new
[1:05:27] birth follow the word all the way down
[1:05:29] till it'll change your body it ain't
[1:05:32] enough to say God sent a prophet but let
[1:05:35] that person have an experience for
[1:05:36] themselves it's not enough for you to
[1:05:38] have Revival I want our young people to
[1:05:40] have Revival I needed a Revival and God
[1:05:43] sent me a personal Revival I say every
[1:05:45] one of you tonight pray that God will
[1:05:47] send you a Revival pray that God will
[1:05:49] send you such a Revival that your kids
[1:05:51] can see your Revival pray that God will
[1:05:53] send you such a Revival that the people
[1:05:55] on the street can see you're in Revival
[1:05:57] pray that God will send you such a
[1:05:59] Revival till the pastor can stand here
[1:06:01] and he can't hardly preach because the
[1:06:03] fires are burning so hard in the
[1:06:05] congregation until they're standing
[1:06:07] there want more of the word more of God
[1:06:10] and the altars are filled again oh come
[1:06:12] on somebody the altar has not been done
[1:06:14] away with the altar calls need to come
[1:06:16] back in the church until some people are
[1:06:17] willing to get down there and say you
[1:06:19] know what I got to die to this party I
[1:06:21] got to die to my own ideas I got to die
[1:06:23] to my own opinions and give out to what
[1:06:26] I want and let God have his way in the
[1:06:28] church again God wants to move in you
[1:06:31] God wants to move in your family God
[1:06:33] wants to live through you more than you
[1:06:35] want God to move through you but he
[1:06:37] needs somebody that is willing and able
[1:06:39] to let the Holy Ghost move through him
[1:06:41] again listen Church we're not just here
[1:06:42] to play Church we're not just here to
[1:06:44] have church three times a week and
[1:06:46] you're not here just to hear a good
[1:06:47] sermon but you're here to grow in the
[1:06:50] word of God that has been given you I
[1:06:51] believe that the message has come and
[1:06:53] the bride has been aw awakened by the
[1:06:56] word I believe that you've been woke up
[1:06:57] by the message of the hour we're not
[1:06:59] looking for another message to come the
[1:07:01] message is here can you say
[1:07:04] Amen I'm not looking for a for a new
[1:07:06] message I'm not looking for another
[1:07:08] messenger because this is the final
[1:07:10] message to the final church can you say
[1:07:13] amen and so we believe what he said now
[1:07:15] I want to go ahead and propose to you
[1:07:17] this and I hope it's okay that if this
[1:07:18] is the final age then the the the cycle
[1:07:21] of Revival and death has ended because
[1:07:23] we are in a constant Revival until the
[1:07:25] Rapture of the church now you may not
[1:07:27] always feel like you're in Revival
[1:07:29] personally you may not always feel like
[1:07:32] the church is in Revival but what you
[1:07:34] have is a Revival in you I hope this is
[1:07:38] okay I've got a quote to back that up
[1:07:41] brother BR go on down here I just want
[1:07:42] to get to this because I forgot to start
[1:07:45] my timer on time so we'll be okay buddy
[1:07:48] won't we brother Bram said that cycle of
[1:07:50] Revival and death has never failed all
[1:07:53] you have to do this is in the church age
[1:07:54] book uh the exposition yeah the fision
[1:07:56] church age he said uh the cycle of
[1:07:59] Revival and death has never failed all
[1:08:00] you have to do is recall the last move
[1:08:02] of God in the spirit when men and women
[1:08:03] dressed like Christians went to church
[1:08:06] prayed all night took to street corners
[1:08:07] and weren't ashamed of the
[1:08:09] manifestations of the spirit that sounds
[1:08:11] like a good place to be
[1:08:14] again it wouldn't hurt none of us it
[1:08:16] wouldn't hurt none of us to go ahead and
[1:08:18] exercise our freedom in the house of God
[1:08:20] you know a prophet when he preached
[1:08:22] Church order he didn't come and take the
[1:08:24] moving of God out of the church he just
[1:08:26] put it in order in the church but he
[1:08:27] didn't say we got to get rid of no he
[1:08:29] was a word Prophet everything that the
[1:08:31] word taught he stood for it don't be
[1:08:33] scared of getting out of order one time
[1:08:35] I'll just tell you this I believe if you
[1:08:36] get too fanatical the pastor will tell
[1:08:38] you you're too
[1:08:39] fanatical the deacons will do their job
[1:08:42] but until then just go ahead and worship
[1:08:44] God freely the way you ought to in the
[1:08:48] way that's called heresy that's the way
[1:08:50] I worship God and I believe tonight we
[1:08:53] ought to worship Him Freer than we ever
[1:08:55] had have because a message of
[1:08:57] restoration has come a message has come
[1:08:59] not to just raise us up but to restore
[1:09:02] us all the way back to everything not
[1:09:04] just a Pentecost but all the way back to
[1:09:06] an Acts 2 church and I believe if an
[1:09:08] Acts 2 Church would stagger like drunk
[1:09:10] men it's okay for you to stagger like a
[1:09:12] drunk man I say if it's okay for them to
[1:09:14] be called drunks in the middle of the
[1:09:16] day then what about us have you ever
[1:09:18] been accused of being a drunk man in the
[1:09:19] middle of the day I'm not talking about
[1:09:21] real
[1:09:23] liquor but really have you ever been so
[1:09:25] full of the Holy Ghost to where you
[1:09:27] couldn't speak in English or Spanish or
[1:09:30] whatever you speak have you ever been so
[1:09:33] full of the Holy Ghost that you just
[1:09:35] lose yourself in your prayer closet I
[1:09:37] know a prophet put these things in order
[1:09:39] but I think what we've done is we've
[1:09:40] decided we didn't need that anymore I
[1:09:42] say our young people need a chance at
[1:09:43] the word and they need a Revival in
[1:09:45] their
[1:09:48] hearts we don't want the word didn't
[1:09:50] come to get rid of the Revival the word
[1:09:52] is the Revival this is all part of the
[1:09:54] word we you can stand up here and and
[1:09:56] and every part of this message that you
[1:09:58] read is the word to you it is to revive
[1:10:01] your soul it is to make you feed on
[1:10:03] something listen you're to grow up as
[1:10:04] calves in the stall you're to be fat on
[1:10:06] this word is that all right I preach at
[1:10:09] a home and my brother gives me a great
[1:10:11] big
[1:10:12] amen here to be fat on the here to be
[1:10:14] fat on the word all I got to get off of
[1:10:15] that before he listens and I lose all my
[1:10:17] Pulpit time at home brother man would go
[1:10:20] on down like this he said they weren't
[1:10:22] ashamed of the manifestations of the
[1:10:24] spirit they left their old old dead
[1:10:26] churches and worshiped in homes old
[1:10:29] store
[1:10:30] buildings he didn't say Banks but we can
[1:10:32] say Banks they were we're part of his
[1:10:34] people aren't we worship in Banks soon
[1:10:37] to have a nice church and we thank the
[1:10:38] Lord for that man God is good that's air
[1:10:41] that's a miracle for you all you say God
[1:10:43] ain't doing no Miracles God worked out a
[1:10:45] miracle for this church you ought to
[1:10:47] praise him for it thank God for what
[1:10:49] he's doing for you God's moving even
[1:10:51] when you don't feel him
[1:10:53] moving he said and they they had their
[1:10:55] old store but they had reality but it
[1:10:58] wasn't too long a time until they begin
[1:10:59] to get enough money to build a fine new
[1:11:01] church they put in a choir instead of
[1:11:03] singing unto God for themselves they put
[1:11:05] gowns on the choir and they organized a
[1:11:07] movement and ran it by man come on
[1:11:09] church this is a dangerous place to be
[1:11:11] when man starts taking control of the
[1:11:13] worship in the church and man starts
[1:11:14] taking control of what is said in the
[1:11:16] church let God be God and let the
[1:11:18] message be the authority over the church
[1:11:20] let the message say what is allowed in
[1:11:22] the church let the message say what we
[1:11:24] need to worship like come on somebody
[1:11:26] let the message be your absolute again
[1:11:28] make the message great in your homes
[1:11:30] again I hope that's
[1:11:32] okay it's all right it's all right to
[1:11:35] Worship in the house of God believe it
[1:11:37] or not your pastor would enjoy it if
[1:11:38] you'd say Amen once in a while see I get
[1:11:41] to go home tomorrow so I'm not worried
[1:11:43] about what you think about me but your
[1:11:45] pastor wouldn't mind that a
[1:11:47] bit I hope this is a help to you tonight
[1:11:49] I'm not trying to condemn anybody y'all
[1:11:50] are wonderful to preach to but what I'm
[1:11:52] saying is a spirit of leoa is everywhere
[1:11:55] and and the spirit of leosia is not a
[1:11:56] church on fire it is a lukewarm
[1:11:59] church so what Spirit should we be
[1:12:02] fighting against not the churches on
[1:12:04] fire but the leoan churches or the
[1:12:07] churches that have a form of godliness
[1:12:10] but they deny the power thereof and so I
[1:12:12] would say like this they have a form
[1:12:14] some of them may shout some of them may
[1:12:15] speak in tongues some of them may run
[1:12:17] the aisles some of them could probably
[1:12:19] even live a good Christian life but if
[1:12:21] they miss the word that has been given
[1:12:23] in their generation then they're not
[1:12:24] raptured material I hope this is all
[1:12:26] right tonight listen I believe it takes
[1:12:28] a message to make a Rapture I believe
[1:12:30] that this message didn't come just to
[1:12:32] call you and say well be good people be
[1:12:34] good Methodist be good Baptist no the
[1:12:36] message calls you to be different in
[1:12:38] this day not just to act different don't
[1:12:40] be different just to be different but it
[1:12:42] called you from the normaly of this
[1:12:44] world to be set aside and ready for the
[1:12:47] coming of the Lord I hope this is okay
[1:12:49] tonight listen I don't want to say
[1:12:50] nothing that the messenger didn't say
[1:12:52] but I believe sometimes we get so bound
[1:12:54] up and we're so worried that we're going
[1:12:56] to be deceived you can't be
[1:12:59] deceived you're so worried about being
[1:13:01] deceived by a man in the Pulpit all
[1:13:03] right all right if the man saying what a
[1:13:06] prophet said that is the word of God to
[1:13:08] you brother Brandon would say hope this
[1:13:11] is all right you can find the quote if
[1:13:12] you want to he said in his absence we
[1:13:15] are his body and his
[1:13:18] voice what a prophet said in his absence
[1:13:21] in another place he would say under her
[1:13:24] messenger
[1:13:25] the bride would be the final voice to
[1:13:27] the final age so do you have a voice but
[1:13:30] you have to be under the messenger of
[1:13:32] the hour it's not my opinion that's
[1:13:34] going to change you it's not my thoughts
[1:13:36] that's going to change you but is the
[1:13:37] thoughts of God that would be spoken by
[1:13:39] a prophet in our in our generation and
[1:13:41] we say what a prophet said we do what a
[1:13:44] prophet said we're not hearers only but
[1:13:47] we're doers also of the word of
[1:13:49] God many will come and say have not I
[1:13:52] done these Mighty Works have not I done
[1:13:54] have not I prophet side have not I I'm
[1:13:56] just going to say this and not try to
[1:13:57] add to the word but have not I listened
[1:13:59] to every tape and have not I went to
[1:14:00] church three times a week but have you
[1:14:02] accepted the message for your generation
[1:14:04] have you accepted the Revival that God
[1:14:05] has sent to you have you been on come on
[1:14:08] somebody there's no reason listen if you
[1:14:10] can't enjoy the word here what makes you
[1:14:12] think you're going to enjoy the Rapture
[1:14:13] morning if you can't en word the if you
[1:14:15] can't enjoy the word in church what
[1:14:17] makes you think you're going to have fun
[1:14:18] in heaven where it's so noisy you may
[1:14:20] not even be able to hear yourself
[1:14:22] brother Brandon we talk about how where
[1:14:23] Jesus is there's always a lot of noise
[1:14:25] listen I know sometimes we overuse that
[1:14:27] stuff and we take it out of context
[1:14:28] because I I've seen Services where the
[1:14:30] spirit of the Lord had come in and and
[1:14:32] the people are just quiet and they're
[1:14:33] crying their eyes out and and the Holy
[1:14:35] Ghost is in the service and and people
[1:14:37] are being changed and delivered I've
[1:14:38] seen that but let me go and tell you
[1:14:40] something when you've been set free
[1:14:41] that's the time to worship when you've
[1:14:43] been set free that's the time to take
[1:14:45] your victory dance when you've crossed
[1:14:47] the Red Sea that's the time to beat the
[1:14:49] tambourine I believe we've come into our
[1:14:51] land of promise it's time to take your
[1:14:53] victory dance here tonight and let the
[1:14:55] Revival fires burn
[1:14:58] again we have overcome this message is
[1:15:02] is an overcoming message and God has
[1:15:05] went before us in battle and so when you
[1:15:08] say that you don't have Revival you're
[1:15:11] telling me the message don't work
[1:15:14] okay when you're telling me that you
[1:15:16] don't have
[1:15:18] Revival personal Revival then you're
[1:15:21] telling me you have not surrendered to
[1:15:23] the word of the hour
[1:15:25] if you surrender to the word of the hour
[1:15:28] this word will change you if you have
[1:15:31] surrendered yourself listen not part of
[1:15:34] yourself not just your mind and say well
[1:15:36] I I'm going I'm going to be the message
[1:15:38] an intellectual faith will never change
[1:15:40] you an intellectual faith is not going
[1:15:42] to cause you to take a Rapture an
[1:15:43] intellectual faith is not good enough in
[1:15:45] this bride but you've got to renew your
[1:15:47] mind as I spoke about Thursday night and
[1:15:49] get your mind right so you can accept
[1:15:51] what God has said and believe with the
[1:15:54] heart that this message is enough to
[1:15:56] overcome every giant that'll stand in
[1:15:58] your way everything that tries to keep
[1:16:00] you from your promises God's message
[1:16:02] that he sent is more than enough for
[1:16:06] you this messages are absolute can the
[1:16:09] church say Amen brother B would go on
[1:16:12] and say it like this he said they begin
[1:16:14] to get a new building and he said they
[1:16:17] they he said they let down the bars the
[1:16:18] goats came in on down a little farther
[1:16:20] on that quote he said the Cry Of Joy was
[1:16:23] gone
[1:16:26] have we ever gotten there in our own
[1:16:28] lives to where we come to the message I
[1:16:31] remember the first time I realized I was
[1:16:33] raised in the message for most some of
[1:16:35] my life and I I so I knew the message
[1:16:39] but knowing the message did not convert
[1:16:41] me knowing the message did not fill me
[1:16:43] with the Holy Ghost knowing the message
[1:16:45] was not enough to hold me but I had to
[1:16:47] get a revelation that God had sent a
[1:16:50] message for me personally not just for
[1:16:54] my dad not just just for my mom not just
[1:16:56] for my pastor but for me personally it's
[1:16:59] good to know your pastor is going in a
[1:17:00] Rapture but what about you if my pastor
[1:17:03] don't go I'm going anyway if the church
[1:17:06] ain't in Revival I'm in Revival anyway
[1:17:08] if brother George comes up here and and
[1:17:10] he plows through a service and and and
[1:17:12] and and and and maybe maybe he Don't
[1:17:14] Preach very good one time I know it
[1:17:16] never happens but but if it ever did and
[1:17:18] he's struggling you say well brother
[1:17:20] George just didn't have it tonight
[1:17:21] something he said could have changed
[1:17:23] someone's life for an eternity right
[1:17:25] there something a man said on a night
[1:17:27] when you didn't feel God moving I say
[1:17:29] it's time we come with our expectations
[1:17:31] to the house of God and say I'm going to
[1:17:33] receive whatever God would have for me
[1:17:35] in the house of God tonight if I don't
[1:17:37] feel it I'm going to be blessed anyway
[1:17:39] I'm going to sing anyway I'm going to
[1:17:41] shout anyway I'm going to raise my hands
[1:17:44] anyway why because God has given me the
[1:17:47] ability to know who I am in this
[1:17:50] generation and when the bride will
[1:17:52] recognize who she is guess what we're
[1:17:53] going to be out of here church if you
[1:17:55] can recognize who you are recognize your
[1:17:58] day recognize your Revival if I could
[1:18:00] say it that way recognize the Revival
[1:18:03] fire is here the word is changing Hearts
[1:18:07] tonight let me get on down here just a
[1:18:09] little farther brother brandham said now
[1:18:11] watch but watch when the spiritual bride
[1:18:15] when she begins to have a Revival when
[1:18:18] she begins to come back and line herself
[1:18:20] up with the word of God now I love how
[1:18:23] he ties all that together together this
[1:18:26] is in the invisible Union of the bride
[1:18:27] of Christ
[1:18:28] 1965 paragraph 49 he says but watch when
[1:18:31] the spiritual bride when she begins to
[1:18:34] have a Revival when she begins to come
[1:18:37] back and line herself up with the word
[1:18:41] of God watch then again you see how that
[1:18:44] the scriptures at that time there'll be
[1:18:46] a message sweep out to catch that bride
[1:18:48] catch that woman elect can you say amen
[1:18:51] for as the world Satan the deceiver who
[1:18:52] deceived the first bride is sitting
[1:18:54] against God by believing his word and
[1:18:55] now today as we see the church natural
[1:18:57] in your intellectual gospel there we go
[1:18:59] back to the intellectual faith and
[1:19:00] intellectual gospels and everything's
[1:19:02] done by with intellect anymore well if
[1:19:04] you can just believe it this way they
[1:19:05] can talk you into anything but listen if
[1:19:07] man can talk you into it another man
[1:19:09] will talk you out of it but we have not
[1:19:11] been talked into the message by an
[1:19:12] intellectual mind but we have come by
[1:19:14] Revelation to know that the opening of
[1:19:16] the word was here we see the revealing
[1:19:18] of the son of man in our time what was
[1:19:20] it a son of man revealing the son of man
[1:19:22] to the people it is time for the bride
[1:19:24] to recognize that we are awake in this
[1:19:27] generation we've seen the word come in
[1:19:29] our time we are not like those who have
[1:19:30] failed to see The Awakening but we have
[1:19:32] been awakened by the word of God yes
[1:19:36] that's why the people didn't wake up it
[1:19:38] wasn't because they didn't believe he
[1:19:39] was a prophet I was watching One Time on
[1:19:41] YouTube and I saw I saw I won't call
[1:19:44] their names but they were they were on
[1:19:45] TBN and they were saying what a great
[1:19:47] prophet brother brandham was and even
[1:19:49] walking into Portland I believe it was
[1:19:50] into the auditorium they said it was
[1:19:52] like a god man standing there see they
[1:19:54] could recognize the gift of a prophet
[1:19:56] they could recognize that God was
[1:19:58] working through a man but they could not
[1:20:00] accept the word that was given now those
[1:20:03] that could accept the word that's the
[1:20:05] bride now the church world at the time
[1:20:08] could look at it and say I see the
[1:20:10] prophet I believe that the message came
[1:20:13] or not the message I believe that the
[1:20:14] gift has come and I believe that now
[1:20:16] we're looking for a Great Awakening now
[1:20:18] we're looking for the word listen and
[1:20:19] they missed it because it was God in
[1:20:21] Simplicity in a Kentucky hillbilly that
[1:20:24] would stand there and it was God being
[1:20:26] revealed night after night what to get
[1:20:28] the attention of the people for a word
[1:20:30] that was to come and be open to
[1:20:32] them but they would stand there and they
[1:20:35] would say well we'll follow him and then
[1:20:36] they'll say well he got off on his
[1:20:38] Doctrine when the doctrine was the very
[1:20:39] thing that God was trying to get there
[1:20:40] attention for the whole time so you say
[1:20:43] I'm not I'm not following the signs I'm
[1:20:46] not following a sign I believe the signs
[1:20:48] I love to go to build my faith I believe
[1:20:50] I said it the other night to build my
[1:20:51] faith I go back and I can watch the Deep
[1:20:53] call to the deep and we played it one
[1:20:54] night there in church and just a
[1:20:56] testimony we played it there one night
[1:20:57] in church and shortly after uh we had a
[1:21:00] sister that lost her hair and if she's
[1:21:02] watching and I I hope this is okay she
[1:21:03] lost her hair and had to start wearing a
[1:21:04] hat and a and a scarf and things over
[1:21:07] her head to church and she come up for
[1:21:09] prayer uh maybe that following week and
[1:21:11] we had just played that deep call to the
[1:21:12] deep I think the previous Wednesday or
[1:21:14] two Wednesdays before and and we're
[1:21:16] stand and and and we get down and she
[1:21:18] comes up for prayer and and she gets
[1:21:20] prayed for and within I believe it was
[1:21:22] within two weeks her hair was grown all
[1:21:24] all the way back out so what was it it
[1:21:27] was building faith from from seeing what
[1:21:29] God had done listen I I listen this
[1:21:31] wasn't done in a corner God is still
[1:21:33] using God is still using the same
[1:21:35] anointing today he's still using the
[1:21:37] same word today and all we have to do is
[1:21:39] follow the prescription of the word and
[1:21:41] God can still cast out Devils come on
[1:21:43] somebody you can still Lay Your Hands on
[1:21:44] the sick why because God still uses men
[1:21:47] God still has a pro a pastor in the
[1:21:49] Pulpit God still has deacons at their
[1:21:51] post of Duty God still has somebody
[1:21:54] who's willing to work in the economy of
[1:21:56] that God has laid
[1:21:57] out so so I saw that and I saw that
[1:22:00] faith that was built listen and those
[1:22:01] are good things we we thank God for the
[1:22:03] healings and we thank God for the
[1:22:04] Miracles and we thank God for the
[1:22:06] stories and and the true stories that
[1:22:08] that people would get up out of
[1:22:09] stretchers and and Congressman Upshaw
[1:22:11] and all these things that were great
[1:22:13] testimonies it was God working through a
[1:22:15] man and and raising people up listen but
[1:22:17] that was just to get your attention for
[1:22:19] what was to come well can you say Amen
[1:22:21] now brother Brandon would not point to
[1:22:23] that and say look what I've done look at
[1:22:25] my Ministry when the other healing
[1:22:26] evangelists would say look look at my
[1:22:28] crowd and look at the people that are
[1:22:29] getting healed but there was no message
[1:22:31] to follow it but in our case oh come on
[1:22:33] somebody in our situation we were given
[1:22:36] a prophet that didn't just come to heal
[1:22:38] people but he came to get your attention
[1:22:40] for a word that would change your
[1:22:44] body is that okay tonight so we don't
[1:22:48] follow the signs but the signs follow
[1:22:49] the Believers the signs follow the
[1:22:51] Believers even today the signs follow
[1:22:53] the Believers but Believers are not just
[1:22:55] sign followers if that's all right
[1:22:57] that's we got Bible for that I'll get to
[1:22:58] it in a minute if I need to back that up
[1:23:01] brother Brandon would say it like this
[1:23:02] he said
[1:23:03] now we see the church natural and your
[1:23:05] intellectual gospel going further and
[1:23:06] further away from the word I want you to
[1:23:09] notice that in this message that brother
[1:23:11] brandham was doing in the invisible
[1:23:12] Union of the bride of Christ he talks
[1:23:13] about the word so powerfully and I
[1:23:17] believe tonight that the word should
[1:23:18] have the preeminence in our
[1:23:21] churches I I believe that that should be
[1:23:23] more than the songs I believe that
[1:23:25] should be more than just the more than
[1:23:27] more than anything the word should have
[1:23:29] the preeminence because the Bible tells
[1:23:31] us that that uh that that that that
[1:23:33] Christ uh that God we we we should he
[1:23:35] should have the preeminence of all
[1:23:37] things and and and and we should never
[1:23:39] we should never look to anything else
[1:23:41] have no other gods before you and and
[1:23:43] Christ should always have the
[1:23:44] preeminence in our midst and in our
[1:23:45] services I believe he is the main
[1:23:48] attraction he is the main thing he is
[1:23:50] the theme of our services he is the
[1:23:53] theme of our life he is the main thing
[1:23:55] in all of us but I think if we're not
[1:23:57] careful we separate the word from Christ
[1:24:00] and make it two separate things but in
[1:24:02] the beginning God uh the word was with
[1:24:04] God the Word was God and God came down
[1:24:06] in flesh and dwelt Among Us and when he
[1:24:07] left and ascended then his Spirit would
[1:24:09] come and live in men and you could
[1:24:11] accept the same word that he was now how
[1:24:14] can God accept something other than
[1:24:16] himself but if you have the real spirit
[1:24:19] of God you can't accept nothing but him
[1:24:21] you can't accept nothing but the word
[1:24:23] that is Christ and so brother Bon would
[1:24:25] stand there and he would talk about he
[1:24:27] said the natural intellectual gospel
[1:24:28] going further and further away we find
[1:24:30] that the women of the world on the
[1:24:31] streets members of such as carrying
[1:24:33] themselves in the same atmosphere you
[1:24:36] can't tell them they've lost all sense
[1:24:38] of common decency the people have see
[1:24:41] and that's the way the church has and
[1:24:43] you can see it going straight to the
[1:24:44] ecumenical council just as certain as
[1:24:47] anything in the world and right into
[1:24:48] Rome as hard as it can go see cuz it's
[1:24:50] prophesied and there she is that's her
[1:24:53] behavior now I want you to notice who
[1:24:55] he's talking to but then watch again to
[1:24:57] the spiritual church who's that
[1:25:00] tonight well come on somebody where's my
[1:25:02] spiritual church at tonight but then
[1:25:04] watch again to the spiritual church how
[1:25:06] to that group of people called out the
[1:25:08] elected through every Revival in Martin
[1:25:11] Luther it happened the same way in
[1:25:12] Reformation it happened the same thing
[1:25:14] in the time of John Wesley it happened
[1:25:16] the same thing when Pentecost first
[1:25:17] started they Dro them women right back
[1:25:19] in line with the word and then they
[1:25:21] Drift Away there she goes right back
[1:25:22] over into chaos but then the time that
[1:25:24] the people are ready to line up there is
[1:25:27] a message comes forth and they line with
[1:25:31] it so for the message to come somebody
[1:25:34] had to be ready to accept the message
[1:25:36] somebody had to be willing to dress like
[1:25:38] a lady in this message some man had to
[1:25:40] put off their their their cissified ways
[1:25:42] and had to start dressing like men again
[1:25:44] well come on somebody somebody had to
[1:25:46] start acting like uh men men again and
[1:25:49] women had to start acting like women
[1:25:50] again listen that is a perversion in the
[1:25:52] world that we see that is creeping into
[1:25:54] the message circles and start causing
[1:25:56] men to start dressing like sissies and
[1:25:58] saying well it's okay for our boys to
[1:26:00] wear shorts again well come on somebody
[1:26:02] you say well that's just a prophet's
[1:26:03] opinion I'll take his opinion over your
[1:26:05] opinion I'll take his opinion over my
[1:26:07] opinion I'll take his opinion over any
[1:26:09] preacher's opinion why because I believe
[1:26:11] it's a spirit that gets on the people
[1:26:13] that causes them to disbelieve one word
[1:26:16] if you want Revival line up with the
[1:26:18] word if you want a Revival in your
[1:26:20] church quit pushing the envelope and
[1:26:22] saying well I can watch more TV in the
[1:26:24] home and I'm not going to go to hell for
[1:26:26] listen you may not but you may have a
[1:26:28] cold house of God to set in and you may
[1:26:30] have a hard time living in this world
[1:26:32] with all the spirits that are coming off
[1:26:33] of that television and coming out of
[1:26:35] that screen and and twisting your mind
[1:26:37] to think different ways and start acting
[1:26:39] like the world and and you see some
[1:26:40] naked women on the TV and and pretty
[1:26:42] soon you you grow so accustomed to it
[1:26:45] that it doesn't bother you anymore but
[1:26:47] get back to the house of God and line up
[1:26:49] with the word of God and those filthy
[1:26:51] things won't be in your home no more
[1:26:53] those filthy magazines will will be gone
[1:26:54] that filthy TV program will be turned
[1:26:56] off well come on somebody it's time for
[1:26:59] the house of God and the people in the
[1:27:00] Church of God to start acting like
[1:27:02] Christians
[1:27:05] again well what about your phone brother
[1:27:07] Joel what about your phone I tell you
[1:27:09] our phones are a problem our phones are
[1:27:12] a problem our phones have come in listen
[1:27:14] these are all distractions from the
[1:27:16] Revival that is going
[1:27:19] on the Revival's here but we're not
[1:27:22] participating because we're distracted
[1:27:24] did by the
[1:27:26] world so brother B would go on like this
[1:27:29] and this is in I believe this is the
[1:27:31] anointing ones at end time and brother
[1:27:33] BR would say it like this he said now
[1:27:34] friends go back with me where's the
[1:27:36] first Revival come after the death the
[1:27:39] days when the grain of wheat had fallen
[1:27:41] to the ground the body the bride of
[1:27:42] Christ Christ organized his bride excuse
[1:27:45] me he said his church he never organized
[1:27:47] it he just said Apostles prophets and so
[1:27:49] forth in the church to keep it clean but
[1:27:52] at Nia Rome 306 years later they
[1:27:55] organized it and made an organization
[1:27:57] out of it is that right and he he said
[1:27:59] and it died everything that didn't agree
[1:28:02] with that church was put to death and it
[1:28:03] laid still for hundreds of years in the
[1:28:05] dirt but after a while up she come in
[1:28:08] Luther the first little sprigs of corn
[1:28:10] come up the second it budded out from
[1:28:13] there and then they went they had
[1:28:14] swingly and so forth and and other
[1:28:15] organizations and so forth then after a
[1:28:17] while come the Anglican along and then
[1:28:19] what happened here comes Wesley along
[1:28:21] with the new Revival the tossel that
[1:28:23] looks a little more like like the wheat
[1:28:25] then what happened he said to that it or
[1:28:27] it organized and dried up and died the
[1:28:30] life went right into the Shu and the Shu
[1:28:31] come forth almost perfectly like the
[1:28:33] wheat but finally its Folly was made
[1:28:35] manifest now if you remember in the
[1:28:37] scripture we we read at the beginning it
[1:28:38] said return not again to Folly and in
[1:28:42] the Book of Psalms there he said he said
[1:28:44] will not wil thou not revive us again
[1:28:45] but he goes on at the very end of that
[1:28:47] the scripture we read and he says return
[1:28:49] not again to Folly so he said what is it
[1:28:51] they he said they they they turned again
[1:28:53] and and they went along with a new uh
[1:28:55] what happened he organized dried up and
[1:28:57] died the life went back in the shuck and
[1:28:58] the shuck come forth almost perfectly
[1:28:59] like the wheat but finally its Folly was
[1:29:01] made manifest in the last eight or 10
[1:29:03] years especially in the last three years
[1:29:05] now what does it do pull away from the
[1:29:07] wheat now why hasn't there been an
[1:29:09] organization start up in these last 20
[1:29:10] years of this great Revival it's
[1:29:12] anointed prophets anointed teachers and
[1:29:14] so forth but why ain't there there is
[1:29:16] nothing Beyond The Grain see it's black
[1:29:18] without an organization oh my a blind
[1:29:20] man could see that it cannot organize it
[1:29:23] is so firmly against it it's the grain
[1:29:24] of wheat itself the son of man will be
[1:29:27] made manifest how many knows that it has
[1:29:29] amen the son of man will be made
[1:29:31] manifest in the last excuse me the son
[1:29:33] of man will be made uh manifest and he
[1:29:35] said uh let me get on back here to where
[1:29:37] I was at I'm sorry I I I apologize I get
[1:29:39] so caught up in this stuff and I've got
[1:29:41] so many quotes here that I might just I
[1:29:43] might be all over the place but the son
[1:29:44] of man will be made manifest the grain
[1:29:45] of wheat will come back to itself again
[1:29:47] the son of man in the last days and
[1:29:49] there will come false impersonations of
[1:29:50] it in the last days that'll almost
[1:29:53] deceive the elected if possible look at
[1:29:55] their organizational Shucks pulling away
[1:29:57] now it only lets the wheat be known to
[1:30:00] the elected which are part of it notice
[1:30:02] now how beautiful this is brought in
[1:30:04] here now only he said notice the
[1:30:06] anointed ones and he goes on down he
[1:30:08] said notice the anointed prophets will
[1:30:09] be false and there among it will be true
[1:30:11] anointed how are you going to tell it by
[1:30:14] the
[1:30:15] word many will come and say have not I
[1:30:17] done this have not I done this have not
[1:30:19] I prophesied have not I spoken tongues
[1:30:21] have not I shouted have not I've done
[1:30:23] all these things but what about the word
[1:30:25] that comes what about the word that is
[1:30:26] being made manifest in their lives they
[1:30:28] can shout and they can go out and cuss
[1:30:30] right outside the door they can shout
[1:30:32] and they can turn right around and cut
[1:30:33] their hair they can shout and then they
[1:30:34] can go out and act like Hypocrites
[1:30:36] remember there was two men that brother
[1:30:38] Brandon went to in that meeting and both
[1:30:39] of them would speak in tongues and he
[1:30:41] said one of them was a real Christian
[1:30:42] and one of them was the biggest
[1:30:43] hypocrite he'd ever met what was it it
[1:30:45] was just an anointing on the individuals
[1:30:47] but when the word comes and changes
[1:30:49] lives it's not just an anointing that
[1:30:51] comes but it is a change from the inside
[1:30:53] out when you go out there and you do
[1:30:55] make mistakes listen you're going to
[1:30:57] make mistakes you're going to fall down
[1:30:59] but something on the inside is going to
[1:31:00] get you back up again and keep marching
[1:31:02] on in the house of God and if you miss a
[1:31:05] Wednesday night you're not going to get
[1:31:07] used to missing a Wednesday night you're
[1:31:08] going to get out on Sunday morning and
[1:31:10] and say Lord forgive me give me the
[1:31:12] strength and change my job situation
[1:31:15] change my mind change my heart and let
[1:31:17] me get back in the house of God again
[1:31:19] you say staying home's cool no staying
[1:31:21] home ain't cool that's what the world
[1:31:22] calls good but the Bible has told us to
[1:31:24] assemble together and the prophet has
[1:31:26] told us to assemble together and and I
[1:31:28] say we need to get back in line with the
[1:31:30] word if we're going to call oursel
[1:31:32] bride I hope that's all right you know
[1:31:34] the prophet laid it out pretty plain but
[1:31:35] we've watered it down to such a point
[1:31:37] now that everybody's okay listen Church
[1:31:40] everybody might be fine in your opinion
[1:31:42] listen I you want to thank good of
[1:31:43] people and that's fine but I want to
[1:31:44] just say this for me and my house I want
[1:31:47] to line up with the word and every man
[1:31:50] in this building that has a family
[1:31:51] sitting here tonight you need to make
[1:31:53] that a challenge to yourself I want to
[1:31:55] line my house up with the word of God I
[1:31:57] want my wife to be a real Christian lady
[1:31:59] I want my kids to be in the house of God
[1:32:02] I'm not going to send him to Sunday
[1:32:03] school I'm going to take him to Sunday
[1:32:05] school I'm not going to send my wife to
[1:32:07] church because I'm tired I'm going to go
[1:32:09] with her to the house of God listen
[1:32:10] Church I'd rather you be in the will of
[1:32:12] God and be sitting there tired as you
[1:32:14] can be but fulfilling the word for your
[1:32:17] day listen it there's no reason for us
[1:32:18] to sit at home God has given us the
[1:32:21] ability to not be like they are overseas
[1:32:23] where when they don't have
[1:32:24] transportation and they walk hours what
[1:32:26] is it is a desire on the inside of
[1:32:28] somebody I say let the Revival fires
[1:32:30] come in your heart and you can't stay
[1:32:32] away from the church
[1:32:34] anymore is that all right tonight I say
[1:32:37] let the Revival fire start let the word
[1:32:39] come in your heart God will move for
[1:32:43] you this is on my heart tonight church
[1:32:45] it's not because your pastor said he
[1:32:47] want a Revival I need
[1:32:48] Revival our church needs Revival my
[1:32:52] family needs a Revival how many can say
[1:32:54] that for your house my family needs a
[1:32:56] Revival we've drifted I need a Revival
[1:32:59] we we we don't turn on the tapes like we
[1:33:01] used to I need a
[1:33:05] Revival it's one thing for a preacher to
[1:33:07] sit there and study it's another thing
[1:33:09] for him to take his family in there and
[1:33:11] sit him around around a table and say
[1:33:13] we're going to hear the message tonight
[1:33:15] it's one thing for a preacher to sit
[1:33:17] there and study and say well I got a
[1:33:18] pretty good word from the Lord but what
[1:33:20] about your family that's sitting there
[1:33:22] what about the TV that's on the other
[1:33:23] room with all kind of filthy garbage
[1:33:25] well come on somebody the preachers are
[1:33:26] got to be held accountable too it's not
[1:33:29] just the it's not just the people that
[1:33:30] we preaching there listen when I'm
[1:33:32] pointing my finger at you I don't mean
[1:33:33] to be pointing at anybody but I'm
[1:33:35] pointing them back at myself as well
[1:33:36] because I've got to line up to the same
[1:33:38] message that I'm preaching to you
[1:33:40] tonight I need Revival we all need a
[1:33:43] Revival brother brandham said when the
[1:33:45] when the Revival come to the ocean it
[1:33:47] wasn't to there was no more water in it
[1:33:49] than there ever was before it's not
[1:33:50] about building numbers it's not about
[1:33:52] when when when you get the new church
[1:33:53] don't say well we want to fill this
[1:33:55] place up no what about Reviving
[1:33:56] yourselves
[1:33:57] first revive ourselves Lord create in me
[1:34:00] a Revival let me be the Revival let me
[1:34:03] be the Revival to Tucson you say well
[1:34:05] it's just a desert and there listen you
[1:34:07] see these Cactus out here if they had
[1:34:08] some water they might turn into a flower
[1:34:11] but I believe we' we we've become so
[1:34:13] we've become so sticky with one another
[1:34:15] and we've started picking on this church
[1:34:16] because they don't see it our way well I
[1:34:18] hope this is okay tonight it's on my
[1:34:20] heart your pastor may be going away for
[1:34:22] a while but when he gets back he'll take
[1:34:23] notes and clean all this
[1:34:28] up but I but did the prophet not say
[1:34:31] that when you get dry you start picking
[1:34:34] at one
[1:34:36] another what a prophet taught so what do
[1:34:38] we need we need the Revival to be in us
[1:34:41] again we need we need the water to come
[1:34:43] back in the services again I I don't
[1:34:45] want to go to church and just and just
[1:34:47] participate in the service by showing up
[1:34:48] and sitting on the Pew but I want to go
[1:34:50] and be the joy of the Lord in that
[1:34:52] service I I want to go and if nobody
[1:34:54] else says amen I want to say Amen to the
[1:34:56] word if nobody else can pull on the word
[1:34:58] of God I want to pull on the word of God
[1:35:00] if nobody else feels like worshiping let
[1:35:02] me worship anyway if the church feels
[1:35:05] cold let me be on
[1:35:08] fire hey no reason to point at everybody
[1:35:10] else say look at them they're dead what
[1:35:12] about me well come on church I I I know
[1:35:15] this is simple but I believe the word
[1:35:18] has come in this day to wake up a bride
[1:35:20] I believe that she is now seeing the
[1:35:22] word and becoming the word today listen
[1:35:25] when the prophet came and Revelations
[1:35:26] tells you there was a little book open
[1:35:28] and that little book had contents in it
[1:35:29] that were good for you and that little
[1:35:32] book maybe to the world has still got
[1:35:34] the seals on it because it has not been
[1:35:36] revealed to them why because they would
[1:35:38] not accept it as a revealed word but we
[1:35:40] have seen the revealed word in action we
[1:35:42] know that God's still alive we've seen a
[1:35:45] Prophet come and do the works that Jesus
[1:35:47] did we've seen a man stand there night
[1:35:49] after night we've seen the works and it
[1:35:51] got our attention for the word that was
[1:35:53] would come and restore the bride
[1:35:56] again he's not restoring it's just a
[1:35:58] Pentecost but he wants restored
[1:36:02] powerhouses this is the final
[1:36:05] Revival this is not just a Revival it is
[1:36:08] the Revival it is the bride's Revival
[1:36:10] brother brandham and I love the quote
[1:36:11] and I I I believe I've got it in here
[1:36:13] somewhere if you need it I'll find it he
[1:36:15] said every chance every generation has a
[1:36:17] chance at its Revival every generation
[1:36:19] has its chance at the word and so I
[1:36:22] believe tonight that it's not just you
[1:36:24] know you know we may have found the word
[1:36:25] and I'm thank I thank the Lord that I
[1:36:27] found this message but I've got to make
[1:36:29] it accessible for my children so that
[1:36:31] they can find it too you say well I'm on
[1:36:33] fire for God if you'll get back in the
[1:36:35] house of God your children will come
[1:36:36] back to the house of
[1:36:38] God you know we want to tell our kids to
[1:36:40] go to church and line up to the word and
[1:36:43] they look at us and they're like well
[1:36:45] what about
[1:36:47] you what about you Dad you're always on
[1:36:50] your phone or you're always watching TV
[1:36:52] well help me Lord
[1:36:54] my kids are looking at me and I'm
[1:36:55] telling them be in church every service
[1:36:57] and and I go to church every service but
[1:36:59] listen church that ain't enough I need
[1:37:00] to set my example at home too so that
[1:37:02] think can no I'm not just a hypocrite in
[1:37:04] the house of God but I believe what I'm
[1:37:06] talking
[1:37:07] about brother Israel can stand here and
[1:37:09] preach the message to you but his kids
[1:37:12] are sitting there home and he knows you
[1:37:14] know your kids are your worst critics
[1:37:16] I've got a daughter who I I I don't even
[1:37:17] crack the top 10 favorite preachers in
[1:37:18] her
[1:37:20] mind George ain't there either don't
[1:37:22] worry
[1:37:24] but she'll sit there and start naming
[1:37:26] off all these preachers she heard and
[1:37:27] she's got names that I don't even know
[1:37:30] people that I wouldn't never listen
[1:37:32] to but she heard him
[1:37:34] somewhere and I'm sitting there thinking
[1:37:36] what about me but you know what you know
[1:37:39] kids are
[1:37:41] impressionable and when you raise him in
[1:37:44] the fear and I know my time's almost up
[1:37:46] I'm looking at the
[1:37:48] clock George said he pulled for an hour
[1:37:51] and it must have been a long time ago
[1:37:52] since that hour was up
[1:37:56] but you know kids are impressionable we
[1:37:59] can tell them things and that's good but
[1:38:01] what they see you doing is a lot more
[1:38:02] powerful to your
[1:38:04] kids when when you tell them hey you
[1:38:06] need to be free to Worship in church and
[1:38:07] you're sitting there like a bump on a
[1:38:08] pickle come on
[1:38:10] somebody it's good to Worship in church
[1:38:12] we need to go worship today we're going
[1:38:14] to we're going to church to worship why

[1:38:45] George he didn't call somebody else to
[1:38:46] pastor this church brother Israel but he
[1:38:48] called you why because you're the man
[1:38:50] for the hour you're the man that God saw
[1:38:52] fit to put confidence in you are the
[1:38:55] people that God saw fit to place the
[1:38:57] seed of the message in because he knew
[1:38:59] you could live this message you say well
