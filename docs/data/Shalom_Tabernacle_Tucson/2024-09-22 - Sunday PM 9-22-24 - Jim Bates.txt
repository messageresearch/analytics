Lord in there and maybe a healing or two or the victory or oh my the Rapture is in you now that's a powerful quote we could have just just rallied around that for the rest of this evening so we thank

he comes again make our brother feel welcome God bless you thank you I really appreciate um just all the hospitality here and just I feel so welcome um sorry I'm a little emotional that that song got me right in the heart you know I'm going to share a little bit of my testimony I don't do this very often but I feel at home so I'm going to get a little bit transparent I'm going to share some things about hopeless case saved by grace so maybe we can turn I want to read a scripture with you it's found in First Corinthians and we all know this one we'll read it together I just appreciate all of you how you made me feel so welcome here feel like I'm at home amen and uh we'll read this love chapter these words are just so powerful verse one of Corinth 1 Corinthians 13 says though I speak with the tongue tongues of men and of angels and have not charity love I become the sounding brass and of a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith and so that I can remove mountains and have not charity I'm nothing and though I besto all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profited me nothing charity or love suffereth long it's kind charity envieth not charity vth not itself it's not puffed up does not behave itself unseemingly seeketh not her own is not easy easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things love never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether they be tongues they shall cease whether they be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I also am known now abideth faith hope and love these three but the greatest of these is love let's just pray gracious Heavenly Father we love you and we can say that because you first loved us Lord and it was your amazing grace that stooped down and found an empty case a hopeless life and brought meaning Lord and we we just want to be part of your purpose you said the bride was your purpose you said in fact some in her is summed up and manifested the entire wisdom and purpose of God and it's hard for us to Fathom that but we believe it because you said it help us Lord to just become part of your purpose that these shells Lord these just be like a dead Badger skin veiling the Shina glory to this world and help us to get out the way just to share from our hearts this evening Lord that you'd be glorified and be lifted up we ask it now in Jesus name amen God bless you can be seated there was one quote that I missed this morning and I thought it would be appropriate to read it just now if you are a Christian amen amen you will it's out of Pardon he says that's the reason the church is cooling off that's why the great Revival that just struck the land had put Millions into the church it it is they have to got to a place that they're using these experiences and so forth as a tradition instead of being Godly sorrowful and letting the Holy Spirit do the work of his office within you instead of letting the Holy Spirit do the work of his office within you and creating in You a New Life life and making you so hungry to go to church that you can't stay away from church if you are you will then that's what it is not not to sign tickets and join and have so forth It's to be it's to have the Life of Christ in you that just you just long to go it just longs to go there's something within you pushing you so I thought I would start with that but I do want to share a little bit of my testimony and and I have a heart for some of the younger people people I was once a younger person and um I was born in Alaska and raised there my my dad was a minister not in the message I wasn't raised in the message um he was a good man my grandma I think she was somebody that came on of that probably that Pentecostal Branch brother po her name was Ida she was from Mount iron Minnesota born in 1900 and she had the Holy Ghost simple I I I think there was no way for me to ever be an atheist because of my grandma because she lived it I saw simple Faith she was uh 93 when she finally passed but when she was about 90 my auntie could never get her to go to the doctor and uh so she convinced the doctor to come to her house which is kind of now was Insurance these days they don't do that but I remember sitting there by my grandma when the doctor came in with his little bag and grandma looked at him kind of suspicious and looked at my Aunt her daughter you know Auntie goes well Ma I got a doctor to come see you and she goes Jesus is my doctor that was my grandma and so from a young age I you know I'd go to church I was raised it was Assembly of God when we were real young and then as I got a little older my dad went to a kind of a charismatic fundamental whatever they call it church and um but you know I I I was raised in that and so I had a background to know right and wrong but I saw hypocrisy in church there was so many things that I couldn't quite Square I couldn't be an atheist but I was done I rebelled and um so I went out into the world and I was just living like as rough as you can get I got addicted to everything there was to be addicted to in that time frame it's worse now the designer drugs they had but you can't be playing in a rock band and not have access to all that kind of lifestyle I was hooked on smoking cigarettes and drugs and alcohol and just live it right at just living and yet my dad was a pastor and I'm sure it must have made him feel pretty rough you know but I've been searching and I knew and this is going to sound kind of ironic but it's my story I want to just give you a little bit of my testimony um this rock band the guy who was our league guitar player his name was Mark and um he was the roughest guy I ever knew when it came to partying he was just like times 10 and yet I I I kind of left that scene for a while and tried to get right with God because I just felt like the devil was fighting that battle you know I'm out there in the world and I I just not miserable a miserable the devil's a bad Taskmaster you know he convinces you that he's got this better way but he just kicks you when you're down he don't love on you he don't care about you he just tricks you into think you young people you think it's shiny out there it's nothing but heartache and I I saw I went back to the church for a while and started trying to make my life right again you know trying to be something and I heard about Billy Graham was coming to Anchorage Alaska and they were looking to have counselors for the Billy Graham crusade so I signed up and they sent a bunch of ministers to the churches in advance like a month in advance and I think remember brother Bram said how Billy Graham would go to a city get 30,000 comrades come back and couldn't find 30 well I think he probably heard brother Bram on tape say that so he thought he would find a way to solve that problem by getting ministers to go in in advance and get everybody kind of ready and then like follow up after he left so he started this program and so I went through all this these classes they sent brother Billy sends his team out to all these I call him brother Billy he was one of them Messengers don't be scared about that he's a good man I tell you what he has an anointing there was an anointing there but so I went through the classes and you had to take an oral and a written exam to pass it yeah to be an actual Cru you know Crusade counselor got a little badge and then You' sit in the audience and we were at the solivan arena that was like a big old you know Arena and Billy was kind of on this platform down their preaching and you would sit up in the audience and when you did the altar call and people started going down you would follow them down there and then walk them through Romans 3:23 for all of sin and come short of the glory of God Romans 6:23 for the wages of sin is death you know you just walked them through the Salvation scriptures and but he also said put down on your list 10 people that you want to go to the biligram and get saved and be praying for them and so for a month the number one person on my list was Mark the guitar player in my band and so I'm praying for Mark and his wife Stacy and I'm I'm just you know and I went there was seven nights and he was there I went all six as a counselor one night I couldn't go the next day I'm at work I ran a warehouse I was really young I ran this warehouse and I get an intercom call back in the days you know was Jim come to the top you know whatever they give you an intercom over there here's Mark standing there and he's beaming he said I went to billly Graham last night and got saved I just jumped and shouted in my work now you think about this because he's the guy who gave me my tape so now now he's he's saved and he's doing good and he goes to some church for a while and I'm starting to backslide again and all of a sudden I heard he went into some cult my buddy the guitar player he's been going there for about a month and I thought I'm GNA go see my buddy Mark and see what he's got himself into and I get to his house and he wasn't quite home yet from work I'm sitting there with his wife Stacy and I looked at his bible and I see some notes in there serpent SE and I'm like what in the world has he got himself into and I thought you know what when he starts trying to point me to some other man besides Jesus Christ and get me to some other book besides the Bible I'm going to take him to task and thank God the Holy Spirit came to me and said if you want to be a good talker you got to be a better listener why don't you just listen to what Mark has to say and when he's done then you just take him in love to the Bible and to Jesus right well here's a guy who' been out there party with me had no background one month in the message and he preached me a three-hour sermon that blew my mind he went from Genesis to Revelation I for the first time I've been raised as a pastor's son I I taught in the chapel and I went to a Christian School all four years in my high school I I knew the Bible I thought but I could never Square things about our doctrine of the godhead or the evidence of speaking in tongues or any of those things I couldn't Square them and all of a sudden he's saying well Jim why was it blood why did she have to be born why did he have to be born of a virgin why why was it that all through the Scriptures it talked about that in the serpent had a seed where did that come from what was the fall what was this carnality why did and all a sudden the scriptures just went like like brother BR said the lashes of your eye or your shoelaces I just all of a sudden I was like scared almost about how he tied the Bible together in three hours he goes why seven Gentile Church ages this is not just seven churches of Asia Minor that Paul went and ministered to this is prophecy about seven Gentile Church ages man he just went and he was anointed and he says I want to give you this tape and he handed me my first tape there's a man here contr on the light now I had big hair I mean crazy hair if I didn't blow dry it out it was kinky curly like I put curlers in it and so I'd always tried to do the wave or the mullet or whatever was going on in the 80s rock band days so I had this big hair I was hooked on everything there was and I'm driving around my little truck listening to that tape for three days every time I was in that truck I was listening to that tape and all of a sudden I stopped and I thought when was the last time I had a cigarette I haven't drank I went to work and they said what happened to you I go what do you mean they go you used to cuss every other word like a sailor you don't cuss I had to stop to think what had happened to me and I started going what is this I've been to church all my life but I never had anything happened to me like this a miracle happened in my life because I couldn't quit smoking for the life of me I tried he was gone no desire for I realized because I used to be having one here one burd in an astray reaching for another when I was working on something because I just was like that much of a habit you know and so I knew something happened to me I went to one of my best friends I told you this morning you thought you had friends his name was Frank I went to his house and he said hey Jim what's going on man grab a beer I said no sir I never turned it down I drank it like water he looked at me and he said all right fine I got some good stuff in the let's the bong fired up and I said no sir he's shaking his head now he goes all right fine I I got this eightball cocaine sorry I'm just telling you my last story you know and I he said I got it to go out with some girls but I I'll share a line with You' I said' no sir he goes what happened to you you going to church or something I said it's not that at all Frank I said it's not church I didn't get it in church I got it in a truck I got it off of a tape he goes well my my sis my sister got me a Bible for Christmas I said go get that it was still in the box brand new we opened it up red script that's the last time I ever saw him ever saw him again after that but God changed my life so I started going to a little Message Church up there that's where I met Jesse's dad he was one of the elders there good man a really good man and you know I just took I told you I got the entire tape collection when I when I first heard I said I want more of these tapes where do I get them and they said well brother Jose's got the biggest collection there is so I got me a duplicator and a bunch of empty boxes of cassettes and I went knocked on his door and he opened the door just come on in he had like about 300 tapes I duplicated everyone I could get um I was hungry I I just this was the I mean it just changed me I was so excited about how this word was opening up to me for the first time like it was alive I went to my my work and I everyone at work knew all a sudden Jim went from this crazy party in rock and roller to this I mean I have my church J book and my Bible in the breakroom you know I'd be sitting there reading I go to my office and close the door and I started reading in the church age book about the logos being the thought expressed and all of a sudden the word became alive to me and I put my head on my desk like he was there in the room with me he was becoming alive the written word was becoming a living word to me and I was so I had to have more and I had to have more and so I started getting the tapes and I tell you I listened to the tapes and listened to the tapes listened to the tapes got into the books I I saw the pastor studying there all the red books and little spoken word books I have you could go see my library it's they're dog eared and page and highlights and you look at my church age book I just became somebody who was hungry for the word but I started being called a theologian by the church group some of the people in there said Jim slow down buddy you know I would go to a place and they'd be talking about hunting and fish and I like to hunt and fish but I was wanting to talk about the word and they started making me feel like I was an oddball you could ask my wife I'd leave there crying like what's wrong with me everyone thinks I'm a fanatic you know and I got to where and I found out later it's probably a gift but I got to where these quotes will come like this now when that anointing falls on me I've had people say Jim I need to know where a quote's at and they would just and I would just tell them but it's just like the Lord does that well because so he started calling me oh Jim baates the Jim debates they call me because they couldn't they couldn't pull one over on me with their doctrines well BR and Brad didn't say that well brother Bram also said this so I was Jim debates the Theologian the quatic I kind of got this reputation and you know it got to where I started hearing some of the stuff of being preached and I was like that's not what brother Braham said I or I'd go and find a quote now I'm just going to tell you this is my testimony I saw where butter Braham said he was going to get a bear twice as big as the one in his den and I said okay to the ministers well where's this at oh stop it stop it stop it that's that that got broke or I go see you know I'm I so I'm sit there going if this is this is the truth man if this is thus sayith the Lord a vision or a prophecy then it's got to be butter BR said if you can find one place where I've messed up put a sign on my back false prophet that's so that's my mentality I'm just telling you my truth this is where I was at so I hear these brothers and I go to them well what about this did he ever get this tent like he was going to get or sh you start to sound like those guys down there you know they just start to tell me stop that so I got I was was like getting upset with this I was like you guys aren't saying what he said so I quit the church before tape churches were popular we just started for about three years I just started listening to the tapes little small couple families and I started getting anchored in this word even more and I got to where you know I'm just if that's the way they're going to be I'm not going to go hang out with them because they're denying this word now I'm just telling you my test I want you to listen because I got something I want to share with you that change my life even more so I'm in this kind of uh place and I thought you know I was reading where brother Bram said if you ever want to do something nice for me do it for my family is that how you feel brother Poe that's how I feel you know when someone does something nice for my family it just makes me feel like don't do it for me do it for my family bless my children bless my wife and I thought I want to get brother Billy Paul up here fishing so I wrote him I was I was you know sending some of my ties down there because I didn't have a church I didn't have a pastor at the time so I just picked a thing and I found William brandham Evangelical Association and started sending ties there found out later brother brandham actually created that and they sent me a little receipt about my ties I was a rebel I'm just telling you I was a rebel but I thought I was a good rebel I was passionate about this word and I and if you weren't saying what brother Bram said I was going to go after you cuz it was the precious thing that changed my life and deliver me from all this stuff this thing was so precious to me don't touch it leave it alone you know and so brother Billy Paul said brother Bates I'll come but you got to cooperate with that Pastor I said brother Billy he says brother Bates you want me to come I said yes sir so I want to brother Frank was our pastor and me and him were like loggerheads I mean we fussed I mean I'd go after him and he he didn't like it I'd pin his ears back and he was older than me and more in the mess he's longer than me but he couldn't quote the quotes like I could I'm just sharing with you my story and so I said brother Frank let's get together and get brother Billy Paul up here fishing he said okay brother Bates that's the prophet's son let's do that so we cooperated kind of and he was a pastor and the old Pastor there was a big Scandal the church had split there was the old Pastor now that brother Frank was a new pastor and there was a couple other factions and you know so we finally get brother Billy Paul up there and we're going to take him out fishing at this Lodge and I flew out early with one brother that I was just like that guy's off in the program you know that's what they called it actually back then they called itself the program so I'm like not going to have anything to do with that I read all about the nickel aans in my church age book I was equipped these guys Conquering the lady right you with me you guys this is probably some of your testimony too and so I had been talking to brother Billy I've been writing him letters I've been asking the same questions about the quotes these brothers were shut me down and brother Billy Paul was just like Daddy said it I believe it that settles it I was like man this guy believe he's a Believer I found some I could talk to that he's not going to just deny it he's just gonna you know and he didn't make he didn't interpret it to me he didn't explain it away he just said if Daddy said it if God thought it brother BR spoke it I believe that's that's brother Billy Paul you've heard him say that right so he gets up there and I thought man brother Billy Paul's gonna crack these guys head and straighten them all out I'm going to be Vindicated that I'm right and they're wrong so we got to this Lodge and we're fishing there about five factions of us all in different directions Old Pastor new pastor somebody from the program from up out of the states and then we had Wild Bill I don't know if ever you met Wild Bill but that guy was a class of his own if you ever heard brother Billy Paul or Brother David Bram talk about dark Brownie and tell that story they told it all over the world that happened in that Lodge that night so we get back to the lodge after fishing and we're sitting around this group of us brothers and uh I think it was David Bram was like 19 early '90s 991 maybe 1991 or something like that and um Rush limbo had just come on the air and so David brand was like brings up politics and we're all talking about it and I watched brother Billy and all of a sudden he just how many of you knew brother Billy Paul first time that man hugged me I thought I was going to melt you never could feel real love like that we just read that love chapter you know it that's how he behaved those attributes is what I saw in that man now I'm not trying to glorify him he'd slapped me if he was here like brother B stop it but you know it's just what I saw in him and so then he goes he says well you know Daddy said in Jezebel religion that final attack would be on the White House he comes stomping out of the Wilderness you know here we go here we go we're going to get in third pole we're going to get in all this you know and he did but he did he took the conversation to to the message and then pretty soon you know we started to I'm ready to and then all a sudden he goes he says say say brother and he picked out somebody he goes you got a testimony tell me your testimony here's brother Frank telling about how he was a druggie he was so bad on acid that he said he couldn't even read a tape measure the little faces were looking at him telling him to kill himself he had to hug a tree to see if there was something real and then God saved him by this message and I'm listening to his testimony I'm like man God saved that man then he went to this brother he told his testimony this brother and pretty soon it started changing the atmosphere in the room and once that atmosphere started changing in brother Billy started telling testimonies about the angel of the Lord and his dad and the Ministries and the things that he saw and now it's starting to get really thick in there and then one one person had to get up and leave and there was an empty chair and brother Billy says you never notice when they you go to talking about him he says they come they draw an ey he says and there's always an and when he pointed that chair a bomb dropped I've never been in in a presence like that more powerful than that in that presence that love you know you've heard about people say it gets milky in the room you're in a presence where in that presence man you can't bring your stuff in there in your in that presence you love everyone in that presence you don't look down on anybody you don't think you're better than anybody else we were on our face on the floor crying we got up hugging each other we had a prayer meeting and a song service in a little Lodge in Alaska and it I I I was in a presence that I couldn't even I mean I felt like I was going to just I don't know fall apart you're not it's not a paranoid fear at all but you're in a reverence and and a love that just I can't explain and so the next morning I get up early I'm still like struck by this bomb that just dropped on me I'd been saved but God had delivered me he took me he took all those things away from me I was in love with this word but I want you to hear this so I get up early and I'm in we're on these little tiny cabins you know and this big Lodge where we were in and I was up early I thought I'm the first one up so I went outside and it's just quiet hearing the birds it's the beautiful Alaska there's this little Lake down there I look on the dock and there's brother Billy and Brother David are ready to fish they're already up and I don't know what I look like but brother Billy looked at me he said brother Bates and he motioned me down there and he says are you all right I saides sir he says you sure I said brother Billy it's just I'm still trying to absorb what happened last night he goes what Happ you know how brother Billy would fish he was fishing he goes what are you talking about brother Bates I said that love that came in the room he when I said the word love he grabbed me because he knew I caught it he grabbed me but you know how brother Billy was he'd be intense he grabbed me and he just pulled me in he says brother Bates he says if you think that was something you should have seen my dad and he started telling me about his dad he says I knew my dad better than anybody I had to take him from the pulpit he says brother Bates I had to make sure I didn't keep him there too long I had to make sure that you know I didn't take him too soon because then somebody wouldn't get healed and I and I was I took that job seriously he said I could read my dad like a book he says but I couldn't tell the difference between his friends and his enemies I said brother B I'm telling you the truth he said he treated everyone the same he said you know those men that just my daddy and he knew it he loved those men brother Bateson you can't Bluff that and I'm sitting here thinking I've been fussing with these brothers in that Lodge and I didn't love them right I didn't I couldn't separate them from what I thought was false Doctrine and yet God loved me when I was nobody and I sat there I said brother Billy and he says no brother ba you remember he said Daddy said nothing but perfect love will enter in over there he said what you felt last night he said if you would have been around my daddy you would have saw that every day and I thought man I said' brother Billy I don't know I said I he said 'now get that love brother Bates but stay in the front lines don't stop fighting just fight different you're not fighting your brothers you're fighting spiritual wickedness in high places it's the devil that tries to separate us it's the devil that tries to get us off over here looking at each other instead of that love that came in that room now I'm telling you my testimony so I went away from that Lodge and I was like praying now differently like Lord I need that Divine love what do I do and he spoke to my heart and said be brother Frank's friend I said well that's not too hard to do he's kind of a nice guy now I heard his testimony so I called him up now this I'm telling you that worked on this it worked here it started here you know the love starts with you and this church I feel the love here don't lose that get it stronger love one another love those others I mean I saw that at the prayer breakfast just loving all these other churches and pastors and all this just you know what it's not compromising it's just showing that love that God had for us when we were unlovable and so I I started calling him up let's go have coffee and he was a coffee connoisseur and got me hooked on breves and to this day brother Frank needs to repent for that but no I'm but I became his friend and and I I would start to go and help him I started and the Lord told me to go back to that church I said go back there you took me out of there he says brother Bates now you're ready go help I didn't go to church anymore to see what I could get I was going to see what I could give so I started going and I told Brother Frank I'm gonna come here I'm not going to give you no trouble bring I'm gonna bring my family here I said because God told me to come he said come ahead and he blasted me he told me later he said man I tried to get you to he said I would have left he I saidwell God told me I said I wasn't a saint brother Frank I had some bad thoughts but I said I knew God sent me back there but as we started becoming friends we started talking and we started being able to communicate and then something else happened we brought brother Billy Paul up again fishing and he was dealing with me about my Ministry and things on an island in the middle of Alaska and he said brother B tell me about your ministry I said sir I don't have one he said sir I said I don't have one he said I said well I quit he said really and he started telling me his testimony he started sharing some things with me and telling me testimonies about his dad and so he says you ever been to Jeffersonville I said no sir he said would you come and there's another brother standing right there I like what you asking him why are you asking me and I I said well yeah yeah I'll come and I was just really bummed about us not catching fish right then you know that's what I was thinking about I was kicking the dirt like it's rainy and windy and it's bad and we're not catching fish and right then a little bit of a cloud broke and you can see bit bit of a mountain and brother looked at me and he goes brother bat I said yes sir he says you see that mountain I said yes sir he said before one Speck of that mountain was there before there was a world he said God knew who would be here how many fish we'd catch and what we be talking about stop worrying oh that presence hit me I was like okay now he's got my attention so I go to the airport and I'm with like probably seven or eight brothers the pastor and all these brothers and he goes he says brother Bates are you coming to Jeffersonville in front of all them grab me by the shirt and pull me in his face and I'm like why isn't he asking them why is he telling me I said yes sir I'm coming well that was when they took their vacation you know from the voice of God this was the old quadrangle so I told my wife says we're going to Jefferson's Ville as soon as I can get off at work so August 12th was 1994 or whatever it was I got on a plane with my wife and went to Jeffersonville for the first time and brother Billy Paul says now when you get to town call me well you know Sharon Johnson was watching this morning from over here in Phoenix she's a good friend of mine her and her husband Mike was still here then they said hey if you go to Jeff we have some good friends that you can stay with so we called them and they said yeah we live in Henryville come on up you can stay with us we got a perfect place for you so I we got into we drove actually flew into like Ohio and then drove a car over and got there at 3: in the morning so this brother met us took us to his house so it's a Saturday morning we get up I I got there at 3: but I was up at 9 o'clock 8 o'clock in the morning ready to go we I'm in Jeffersonville so I called brother Billy he said brother Bates he said when'd you get in in I said 3: in the morning he says you said you'd call I said brother Billy it was 3 in the morning he said I told you when you get here call me I said brother Billy I sorry it was 3 in the morning I'm over here he goes he goes all right you're coming to my house for dinner tonight he said I'm gonna hand the phone to this guy and he's going to tell you how to get to my house so I'm in Henry Bell says Sellersburg I'm okay I'm from Alaska I have zero clue zero why was I singled out out of all these people why did he invite me and now I'm going to his house for dinner which I just thought everybody did so I go to my and I said hey don't make dinner first tonight we're going to brother Billy Paul's for dinner tonight and he just go he looked at me like didn't say anything for a while I said you all right brother he goes you're going to brother Billy to dinner I said yeah he goes I've Liv her four years I don't even know where he lives now all a sudden I get this this complex like why is this happening to me what's what's wrong you know so that night I get to brother Billy's house my wife's with me and I get into his house and he takes me through his entire house and gives me a tour of every room in his house I mean what a transparent man just like let me show you this is this room this is that room and everything and I I didn't see any evidence of an unbeliever in that house I'm telling you he he lived what he lived this message so then I go and sit by the couch closest to the door like okay brother Billy you don't have to have me here he goes I know I said well why are you doing this he goes because you're my friend I go brother Billy you've been fishing with me a few times and I write you letters how am I your friend this is what he told me I'm just telling you my testimony this is not to put anything on me I want to glorify God here in a minute because this love that changed my life I want to tell you he said brother Bates I put my pants on one leg at a time like you every morning he says I get people to put me up here on a pedestal and make me something here and I he said others make me a devil he says I feel comfortable around you I thought I put him on a pedestal I did you know I was like I'm not guilty of that I didn't make him feel that way I guess he said we can talk about the word we can joke about brother Bill we can you know talk about he said I just like he needed a friend that made him feel like that instead of you know and I I didn't know that I made him feel that way but I'm still I'm still uncomfortable he goes well what do you want to do I said I've never been here brother Billy you've asked me to come I don't know he goes you've never been here that's right he goes let's go we're getting in the car right now Sister L got in the back with Mell he got in there he gave me a personal tour of all Jeffersonville now I'm just telling you I was that privileged but God was doing something so then we went to the BAM Tabernacle on Sunday that next day first time ever I got to sit right by Brother Billy there was an empty chair sitting by me and they played brother Collins played a second-handed robe man I'm telling you that anointing was so strong in there and I was just feeling it and I was just having a time and afterwards brother Billy Paul said you know Daddy said that the angels are all around the wall I said one was sitting right by me he he liked that and you know so I got that exp he goes what are you doing Monday I said well I don't know I'm what he goes you're going to come meet me for lunch just me and you just me and you so Mall got with the sister and they went have to do something I go over to brother billies and he's got this little Bronco too and I piled in it with him he says now we're going to go have fish not like in Alaska but we're going to go I like long joh and Silvers or some little place he liked to go get fish fish and chips we get there and we get our food and he sits down at the table and he saids now brother bat I'm G to talk to you like a big brother he said I hear you're fussing with them brothers up there I'm going to crack your head I said brother Billy you just don't want he said sir I said you should hear what they I said who am I talking to this man's been to it all what who do I think I am you know that little bit of fight still in me you know and so he just started taking like we had our drinking glasses he goes now what if he says what if that Pastor butter Frank's here and you're here who put you there I said God he say don't think God can put him there he said how are you going to do that if you don't if you don't have that love he started telling me stories about his dad he told me we sat there for probably two hours and he just talked to me like a big brother he said now I'm going to say happened to you and I said yes sir he said I'm going to give you some advice now you young people listen to me this might be good advice for you he says I want you to cooperate with everyone and compromise with no one I thought about that for to this day I think about it it's a Razor's Edge only the Holy Ghost could do that one it'll bump that way you're compromising one it'll bump that way you're not cooperating so I ask God every day Lord help me stay balanced I don't want to compromise on this word but I want to cooperate brother Braham cooperated he put his Circle bigger he didn't he didn't let them draw him out of their Circle he just put his Circle bigger drew them right back in brother Braham Liv the message he preached and it started to change my life I felt like I was like Peter can you imagine Peter that time Peter looked and he saw he saw his his word his the the most powerful force he'd ever seen that could ra speak to the storm raise the dead you know just multip of bread and Fishes now sweating it out in the garden soldiers were trying to drag him away and he pulled his sword and said I'm GNA protect this message I got you Lord chops an ear off Jesus said Peter you don't even have a clue what you're doing and the Lord showed me he says you don't need to protect this message Jim Bates you don't need to defend it it defends itself and when it looks weak it's not weak it's stronger than ever when Jesus went to Calvary it looked we but that was the word overcoming for Peter Peter needed salvation after you're converted Peter and God showed me that was in my life how many of you have been a little bit like Peter take your quotes and go whacking people and trying to fight and fuss just relax rest in this word and that's what God did to change my life it was like he delivered me of all those things but he started to show me this love without that love you're not going it's not compromising it's elective and it it corrects the air here but it does it like we just read doesn't behave itself unseemly it's not easily provoked it doesn't puff itself up it's not it doesn't do those things it believes all it endures all things and I just ask God every day Lord give me more of that love let me read you something I'm not going to take much longer brother but I got just a couple things for you and then we're going to close this but I want to read you something that BR Bram said he said love he said God's love love is the most powerful thing that there is in the world it conquers Anything Is Love by this you shall conquer by love divine love loving one another loving the cause of God loving Christ loving suffering Humanity that's how you conquer you know brother brandham stopped a bowl with love a charging Bowl Hornets in a nest a an insane man that was going to come up there to punch him out he said it was love he cast out Devils by love and so when Billy Paul told me he says brother Bates he says stay in the front lines just fight different I started realizing that the most powerful weapon we have is love it disarms the enemy he doesn't know what to do with that you're fighting back you're just playing in his ground then chopping with your sword so my advice to any young person here that's like I was this message meant everything to you and you want to defend it just get behind that get into Christ get into Christ and he is love and let him work through you get out of his way let him do his work I got another one for you this one's for the home he says love should go govern the home love is the greatest force that was ever put into the power of a man a home that's not disciplined by love is not much of a home if the husband and wife doesn't somly love each other they cannot trust each other that's why I think that instead of resting our faith upon some emotion which is all right or some gift which is all right like shouting speaking with tongues or with other things that we take for saying that we had the Holy Spirit when we do this those things are all right but if we would come back to the principle love first and then those things I think our church would progress a lot faster if we would get God first and God is love now he says love is two different words and he talked about the agapo and the pho right you got that up there that fast look at them this is awesome so the love you have for your wife agapo is the love divine love now that love you have for your wife and the love God Is So contrary just listen to the love that you have for your wife of a man insult her you would kill him on the spot with that kind of a love a filo love but with a goppo love you'd pray for his lost soul that be the difference there's two different types of love and I'm almost sure that many of us has been deceived with having fileo love thinking it's a goppo love filo love is in is intellectual agapo love comes from the heart that's human love affectionately love in Godly love Godly love doesn't question human love reasons but Godly love doesn't it's perfect in its Trust trust it's perfect it just produces faith when you really love Faith Works by love we need more faith to overcome we need more love we need that love from the heart the love of God the agapa love not the intellectual love that would want to go out there and whack somebody that you feel like has done you wrong in that presence I'm telling you in that presence and you've probably how many of you have been in that presence you know what I'm talking about it takes you you can't see you can't everybody looks lovely to you brother po I I couldn't in that presence I couldn't I couldn't be that guy anymore I couldn't be the same Jim Bates anymore and now brother Frank we still don't always agree on everything but I love that man he's one of my best friends and I would die for him that's the truth that's what the love of God can do to you I want to tell you a little story and I'm going to read you one more quote and then I'm done now I want you little girls to listen up you little boys I got a story for you there was this Christian home and there was a little girl in there how old are you sis with the black dress you're 11 years old maybe about that age and this little girl she'd go with her mom to the store a little Dime Store she saw this little cheap costume ring she really wanted it how many of your little girls wanted some jewelry ever she wanted that ring really bad mama yeah maybe it was $5 or something can I have that ring she said well maybe if you do your chores and save your money you can get it so this little girl does does her chores she works hard she does all the things her mama tells her she gets her little change and she saves up till she has enough money to buy that ring she goes and gets that ring and she's so happy and proud she's earned this thing and so she shows her daddy when he gets home daddy daddyy look what I got I got this ring and I I put all this into I saved up for it I did all these things and I and daddy would go up there every night to say prayers with her before she went to bed he said honey you love Daddy yes Daddy I love you would you give me that ring oh no Daddy I I couldn't do that every night week after week he'd say the same thing one day he went up there and she was sitting on the edge of her bed she had her head down and she was kind of like trembling a little bit daddy walked up to say prayers and she put her hand out he put his hand out and she dropped that little ring in there he said oh honey he said I've been waiting for you to do that he said' I got this real diamond ring for you that I've had all along just waiting for you to give that up now we think that doesn't sound fair that little girl earned that see that's how we are sometimes we hang on to something we feel like we deserve or earned we're hanging on to something but God's got something way bigger for you amen don't you know we you know I was I was there thinking I was doing something for God and I I had earned this I had done all this but he said Jim give me that this is what I want to give you I gave my life for you I'm giving you my Holy Ghost that's love that I want you to go and love on my people tell them this testimony you know and so I had to give up my little thing that meant so much to me that I thought I earned it's by Grace we heard that this morning nothing you can do to deserve it he's got he's got something worth so much more than our little things we're hanging on to what are you hanging on to this this evening give it to God here's the last quote we're going to read and then we're done now I know you guys know this quote you're you're you're ra I love your pastor here the more I talk to this man I feel like we're twin brothers you know I got a twin brother over in in in Malawi and um and he's just I feel like we're twins we just we just like think we can finish each other's thoughts but this is beyond the curtain of time I'm more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only Supreme Beauty and joy how many are longing for that whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love I got this job I I got this I want I got I want to get married I want to well that's fine but put him first put him first whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love get to where you can love everybody even every enemy no matter if the plane is rocking the lightning is flashing or The Guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not matter get perfect love if you are not saved except Jesus Christ as your savior now if you have not been baptized in water be baptized now if you have not received the baptism of the Holy GH Spirit receive it now press on to that perfect love which will take you to that beautiful and joyful place beyond the curtain of time that's my testimony I ask God lord I need more love I want to be more like you I want to everything else aside that pearl of great price give up everything for that let go of what you're hanging on to and let God give you that perfect love it's the most beautiful ring there is do you love him you still love me thank you for letting me be transparent and share that it's pretty personal to me there's a lot more to my testimony but that's the part I I felt to share with you but it changed my life in a lodge in Alaska with the prophet's son and that Divine love come in a room I could never be the same I just want to go back to that place I want that feeling I want that feeling every day Lord let me just feel that love where I I can just feel like there is no jealousy there is no animos there is none of that there's no you can't bring your stuff in there you can't bring your little petty things you can't bring any of that in that presence it won't go there let's um get the musicians to come on we'll sing that little song I love him because he first loved me stand together thank you
