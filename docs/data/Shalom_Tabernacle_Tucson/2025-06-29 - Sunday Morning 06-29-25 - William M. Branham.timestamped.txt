[0:15] [Music]
[0:45] Good morning everyone. Can we all stand?
[0:48] God bless everyone richly. We're going
[0:51] to be continuing with the
[0:52] Philadelphiaian church age from
[0:54] Revelation 3 verse 7-13.
[0:59] We're going to start at paragraph 146
[1:01] and end after 194.
[1:05] Let's all pray together.
[1:07] Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful to
[1:10] be here this morning. Thank you, Lord,
[1:12] for the faithful, Lord. We desire to
[1:15] hear your word, Father, and hear from
[1:17] heaven this day, Lord. And we're asking
[1:20] all your blessing on the Sunday school
[1:22] classes, everything that would be said
[1:24] and done. Amen. Lord, as we listen to
[1:26] this Philadelphiaian church age, Father,
[1:29] it speaks of an open door that we know
[1:31] is the revelation of your deity, Lord,
[1:35] and who you are. And we're thankful for
[1:37] that supreme deity, Father, that you
[1:40] opened our eyes to Lord Jesus. And it's
[1:44] only you, Father. Not a revelation of
[1:47] another, but just you. And so we're
[1:49] grateful, oh God. be with everyone that
[1:52] may be traveling and may be on the way.
[1:54] And Father, let us have eyes to see,
[1:58] Lord, and ears to hear this morning. And
[2:00] we'll give you the praise for it all in
[2:02] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:07] Can we sing only believe?
[2:10] Only
[2:12] believe.
[2:16] Only
[2:17] believe.
[2:21] All things are possible.
[2:27] Only
[2:29] believe.
[2:32] Only
[2:34] believe.
[2:37] Only
[2:39] believe.
[2:43] All things are possible.
[2:48] Holy
[2:50] be.
[2:53] You may be seated, brother Brandham.
[2:57] Don't say, "Well, I slip around this
[2:59] way." There's a man one time slipped
[3:01] around and got in another way. Do you
[3:02] know that? You ever read the parable of
[3:04] it? There's a man slipped around, got in
[3:06] the other way. Now, I'm the or
[3:09] at the wedding supper. We pick it up in
[3:11] the morning.
[3:12] At the wedding supper, how that man got
[3:14] in there. We'll try to take that in the
[3:17] morning. I was going to sit down. I'm
[3:18] going to let it go in the morning. How
[3:21] that man got into that place from the
[3:23] wedding supper or for the wedding
[3:25] supper. All right. Straight is the gate,
[3:27] narrow is the way. Water is the gate,
[3:30] the entrance unto the Lord God. I have
[3:34] set the open door. I have the keys.
[3:39] I'm the only one can open it. I'm the
[3:41] only one can reveal it. I have the keys.
[3:43] Amen. Is that right? Amen. Then
[3:48] no man can come to me except my father
[3:51] draws him and all the father has given
[3:54] me will come to me.
[3:56] No man can be saved only through Jesus
[3:59] Christ. Not through any church, any
[4:01] organization, any bishop, pope, just
[4:03] through Jesus Christ. He has a key. He's
[4:06] the only one. The keys of what? David.
[4:10] The future coming millennium where he'll
[4:12] sit on the throne of David. I have the
[4:15] keys of David. Amen. I'll open this door
[4:17] and nobody can shut it. Nobody can open
[4:19] it but me and nobody can shut it to me.
[4:22] How can it be? How can a man know he is
[4:24] a Christ until he's revealed himself to
[4:27] him?
[4:28] He reveals himself. He has the key. He
[4:31] can open it or leave it alone. See, I
[4:34] have the key to the door. I am the door.
[4:38] I am the way. I am the truth. I am the
[4:42] light.
[4:45] I am the alpha. I am the omega. I am the
[4:49] first and the last. I am the father. I
[4:52] am the son. I am the holy ghost. I am
[4:55] not I was or will be. I am. That I am
[4:59] the whole thing. I am not I was or will
[5:03] be. I am. That means living presence for
[5:08] eternity.
[5:09] I am always was, always will be. I am
[5:13] now as though always was and always will
[5:15] be. See, he he just I am have the keys
[5:18] of David to the kingdom. No man can shut
[5:21] it. The seventh verse proves that.
[5:24] All right. That he has the keys of
[5:26] David. No man can shut. Now, let's see
[5:28] what the next thing is. For thou has a
[5:31] little strength.
[5:33] Oh
[5:36] said to this little group down here, you
[5:38] got just a little strength now. What
[5:40] does that mean? Just like a man that's
[5:42] been dead and kind of shaking himself.
[5:44] Coming to life, reviving up a little.
[5:47] Amen. Coming to life. You've come out of
[5:49] them old dead creeds and everything. You
[5:51] begin come to life a little bit. Shaking
[5:53] yourself. Kind of waking yourself up.
[5:55] You got a little strength, but I'll set
[5:56] a door before you now. Amen. As soon as
[5:58] it come out of of Lutheranism and
[6:00] papalism and all those other isms and
[6:03] and Methodistism and everything, he
[6:04] said, "I put a door before you now. You
[6:06] got a little strength. What are you
[6:07] going to do about it?" It's set before
[6:10] you. You can walk in or walk out. Either
[6:11] one you want to. The door is set before
[6:14] you. You've got a little strength. Just
[6:17] come into life. You're just beginning.
[6:19] So it was with the early church. Notice
[6:22] at the end of the leady age went back to
[6:26] works again. Now if you notice over here
[6:28] to to show that this church is between
[6:31] these two if you get over into the lady
[6:33] of sin age or the lady of sin church age
[6:35] I know thy works right the end of the
[6:38] lady age what was it thy works in a seat
[6:41] where Satan's at what was the seed of
[6:43] Satan see went right straight back into
[6:45] denomination again you semblies of God
[6:47] and Pentecostal oneness and church of
[6:51] God oh don't you see brethren what
[6:53] you've done you went right straight back
[6:55] to the thing that God hated Amen. Break
[6:58] up brotherhood. Look at the Assemblies
[6:59] of God. Some of the finest people in the
[7:01] world's in them assemblies of God. Look
[7:03] at that United Pentecostal church. Just
[7:05] as fine as you ever met in your life.
[7:07] Look at the church of God. And because
[7:09] of those organizations, they fuss and
[7:10] squealing and fussing one another and
[7:12] call one another buzzers and rat den.
[7:14] Well, it's a disgrace.
[7:16] One thing God hates is sewing discord
[7:18] among brethren. That's right.
[7:21] Organizations is what does it sows
[7:23] discord among brethren. We should be
[7:25] standing the bricks and saying we are
[7:27] brothers. We are not divided. All one
[7:31] body. We one in hope and doctrine.
[7:34] Doctrine of the Bible. One in charity. I
[7:36] like that old song. Onward Christian
[7:38] soldier. Yes sir. The end of the ladies
[7:41] s went back to works again. Our
[7:43] Pentecostal denominations went back to
[7:46] the denomination. Let's get verse 15. I
[7:48] got here verse 15 of Revelation 3 and
[7:50] see if that isn't right. Revelations 3
[7:54] and um and uh or let's see if I wrote
[7:57] that down right. Revelations Oh, no. No,
[8:00] I I wrong. Verse 15. It's a verse 15 of
[8:03] this same chapter shows the same thing
[8:05] down here. Yeah. I know thy works that
[8:08] are neither cold or hot. I know thy
[8:09] works. So they went back to their first
[8:12] thing again. Went back with their
[8:13] strength and went back to the
[8:15] Pentecostal denominations. The fifth
[8:18] verse of u of the same chapter. All
[8:21] right.
[8:23] Uh
[8:24] between the two ages they got a little
[8:28] strength between the two denominational
[8:31] nickelian doctrinal age. Now when the
[8:35] Lutheran year had formed went back into
[8:39] the nickelian the great archbishops and
[8:43] so forth. Then along come Wesley, they
[8:46] form the archbishop of Canterbury and
[8:49] all these different great all of that in
[8:51] the churches and so forth and in that
[8:53] age. Then over here in the Pentecostal,
[8:56] they go right back to the same thing
[8:58] again. All the great denominations, the
[9:00] doctrine of the nickelians. But between
[9:03] these two ages, he opened the door and
[9:05] give the church a little strength to
[9:07] revive it enough that they shake his
[9:08] head. Look out and see where it was at.
[9:10] Amen. Get the revelation. Amen. You
[9:13] didn't see anything knocked out, you
[9:15] know, and first thing shake his head and
[9:17] look around and shake his head. By the
[9:20] way, I was dreaming about that last
[9:21] night. Charlie had thought a shot of
[9:22] squirrel knocked him off a limb and I
[9:24] seen an old woman over there. Oh, was
[9:26] she ever angry with me? She's going to
[9:28] come get me. This squirrel had a little
[9:29] white spring around his neck. That
[9:31] little thought shook his head too many
[9:32] times, looked at me and he took off as
[9:34] hard as he could go. Right back to the
[9:35] woods. You know that old woman might
[9:37] miss the church.
[9:39] Amen. She tried to stomp me. I got away
[9:42] from her somehow. Huh? But uh oh, just a
[9:46] little life. Enough to know to to uh I
[9:49] know I went down the street and she's
[9:50] going to cut me off down there and I
[9:51] turn my phone around so quickly I had a
[9:53] trailer back up. Flipped the whole thing
[9:54] around and cut off the other way. Keep
[9:56] her from
[9:58] just did get by. Now you have a little
[10:02] strength left. So you want to use the
[10:03] strength to really turn about faith
[10:06] between the two denomination. Do you
[10:08] notice kept his word?
[10:12] Watch the next verse here. Now you have
[10:14] a little strength and it's kept my word.
[10:17] Kept my word. That's how they got the
[10:19] strength. That's how they got the
[10:21] revelation. The one that got a hold of
[10:23] the Bible when Luther printed the Bible
[10:25] and come down through the westerly age
[10:27] and so forth. They got a hold of kept
[10:28] the word and seen the revelation of
[10:30] Jesus Christ being God made flesh among
[10:32] us and the water baptism in the name of
[10:34] Jesus. So they went right into her.
[10:35] Amen. There you are. They they got his
[10:38] name. Amen.
[10:40] See, why it's just as plain as plain to
[10:43] read a newspaper just and you can't deny
[10:46] cuz right here it is figured right here
[10:48] in the Bible and here it is right here
[10:49] and we got it's a history it's exactly
[10:52] where the Pentecostal church started got
[10:54] its name about 198 10 12 somewhere along
[10:58] there it begin to fall now
[11:01] or has not denied the name has not
[11:05] denied my name now I like that has got
[11:08] the got the keys to David. Now he can
[11:11] keep his word and and put you into the
[11:14] kingdom.
[11:15] His name had been revealed. They got out
[11:18] of the church that had a name that they
[11:21] were dead.
[11:24] And now they got into the church that's
[11:26] got the name that is got life.
[11:31] Come out of the dead. Father, son, holy
[11:33] spirit name of father, son, holy spirit.
[11:37] That don't even make sense.
[11:39] Amen. See, it's give there for a
[11:41] revelation. His whole book is wrote on
[11:44] revelation.
[11:45] That's what it is. He reveals himself.
[11:48] Now, he said, "Go baptize the people in
[11:50] the name of the father, son, holy
[11:51] ghost." Matthew 28:19.
[11:53] Now, what one of them names you going to
[11:54] use? Now, most of the trinitarian people
[11:56] baptize in the name of the father, in
[11:58] the name of the son, in the name of the
[11:59] holy ghost. That's not even scriptural.
[12:02] Ask anybody say it's in the name sang or
[12:04] not names. name. Name of the father and
[12:07] the son and holy ghost. See? All right.
[12:09] Father is not a name.
[12:12] Son is not a name. Holy Ghost is not a
[12:15] name.
[12:17] So what is it? Something dead.
[12:20] There's no name to it. But through those
[12:22] dead titles by the life of Christ, it
[12:26] reveals. And Peter must have had the he
[12:28] was standing right there
[12:30] with the keys of of the kingdom of
[12:32] heaven in his hand. And the kingdom is
[12:34] the Holy Ghost.
[12:36] Hanging on his side, the keys of the
[12:38] kingdom are always the revelation
[12:40] because Jesus told him, "Oh, brother."
[12:43] Don't you see that? Peter was the one
[12:45] that was blessed with the revelation of
[12:46] truth.
[12:48] There he was standing right there and he
[12:50] heard Jesus say, "Go ye therefore teach
[12:52] all nations, baptizing them in the name
[12:55] of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."
[12:56] Peter turned around and said, "Lord, I
[12:58] sure got the keys here. I got the
[12:59] revelation what that meant cuz I know
[13:01] father's no name, son's no name, and
[13:02] Holy Ghost no name, but I know what that
[13:04] name is. I baptize you in the name of
[13:07] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[13:12] Right now, it's like if you reading a
[13:14] love story and that's the last book of
[13:16] Matthew, last part of Matthew. If you
[13:20] picked up a love story, some of you
[13:21] ladies, I know you don't do it.
[13:25] See, but if you did when he was a
[13:27] sinner, see, you picked up the story
[13:28] down to, you know, his little old girl
[13:31] and picked up this story and said, "John
[13:32] and Mary lived happily ever after." Huh?
[13:35] Who's John and Mary? Now, there's only
[13:37] one way if you know who John and Mary
[13:38] is. That's go back to the first book and
[13:40] read it. Is that right? Well, then in
[13:43] the last book of Matthew, the last verse
[13:45] that Jesus said, "Go ye therefore teach
[13:47] all nations baptizing them in the name
[13:48] of the father and of the son and the
[13:50] holy ghost, teaching them to observe
[13:52] whatever I've commanded them." Now, if
[13:55] if father's no name and son's no name
[13:56] and holy ghost is no name, you better go
[13:58] back first of the book. See, now if we
[14:01] go back to the first book, first chapter
[14:03] of Matthew, you find this. I just like
[14:05] to give this little illustration kind of
[14:06] might be somebody here that's never
[14:08] seen.
[14:10] Watch this. This is the father. This is
[14:13] the son.
[14:15] And this is the holy ghost.
[14:18] Now watch closely. Father, son, holy
[14:21] ghost. That's what Jesus said. Matthew
[14:23] 28:19. Is that right? Father, son, holy
[14:26] ghost. Now who is this? Father. Listen
[14:29] class. Father. Holy Ghost. Son. Now
[14:34] who's this? Holy Ghost. Who's this?
[14:37] Who's this? Son. All right. Now this was
[14:41] the father of who? Jesus Christ. Is that
[14:43] right? Now Matthew the 1st chapter 28
[14:47] verse. Let's read it.
[14:50] We take the love story now and see what
[14:51] it reads like. Lord
[14:56] we see who who this fellow was of that
[14:58] he said go baptize him in the name of
[15:00] the father and of the son and holy
[15:02] ghost. All right. Now the first chapter
[15:04] of Matthew starts out with the
[15:06] genealogy. the book of the generations
[15:08] of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the
[15:10] son of Abraham. Abraham got Isaac, I got
[15:12] Jacob, and on and on on and on on down
[15:14] till it comes to the the 18th verse. Now
[15:18] you see go ahead down here to the 17th
[15:20] verse. And so all the generations from
[15:21] Abraham to David were 14 generations and
[15:24] from David until the carrying away of
[15:25] Babylon 14 generations and carried away
[15:27] of Babylon of Christ for 14 generations.
[15:30] Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[15:33] this wise. When his mother Mary was
[15:36] expoused to Joseph, are you reading
[15:38] behind me? Amen. Listen close. When his
[15:41] mother Mary was expoused to Joseph, she
[15:44] was found with a before they came
[15:45] together, she was found with a child of
[15:47] God the father.
[15:50] Does that read like that?
[15:53] Found with a child of what?
[15:56] I thought somebody said this was his
[15:57] father.
[15:59] Now if the Holy Ghost is one person and
[16:01] the father is another person, then he
[16:03] had two fathers.
[16:06] What you got? I legitimate child.
[16:10] Oh, he said it slipped up for me to
[16:12] misprint there. All right. And Joseph,
[16:14] her husband, being a just man, not and
[16:18] not willing to make her a public
[16:20] example, was minded to put her away
[16:22] privately. But while he thought on these
[16:24] things, behold, the angel of the Lord
[16:25] appeared to him in a dream, saying,
[16:26] Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to
[16:30] take unto thee, Mary, thy wife, for that
[16:32] which is conceived in her is of the
[16:36] Holy Ghost, the two or three witnesses,
[16:39] let every word be established. Amen.
[16:42] The Holy Ghost was his father. Well, he
[16:45] said God was his father. Amen. Now, if
[16:47] there were two different people, which
[16:49] one was his father?
[16:52] See where you get yourself? You just
[16:53] hang yourself right out in the middle of
[16:55] midair. Amen. Now you've got to say that
[16:58] the Holy Ghost is God himself. It's the
[17:01] Holy Spirit which is God. Amen. Now you
[17:04] got two now instead of three.
[17:08] All right. All right. 21st verse.
[17:12] That which is conceived in her. Who who
[17:14] was one conceived this? The Holy Ghost.
[17:17] All right.
[17:18] and she shall bring forth a son, and
[17:22] thou shalt call his name
[17:25] name Jesus,
[17:28] for he shall save his people from their
[17:30] sins. All this was done. Now all this
[17:33] was done that it might be fulfilled
[17:35] which is spoken of the Lord by the
[17:37] prophet saying, "Behold, a virgin shall
[17:39] be with child and shall bring forth a
[17:41] son, and they shall call his name
[17:44] Emmanuel, being interpretated God
[17:48] with
[17:50] us." Amen. What was his name? Amen.
[17:55] Now, who is John lived happily ever
[17:58] after? What is the name of the father,
[18:00] son, and holy ghost? When Jesus was born
[18:02] on earth, he was Christ the Lord. At his
[18:05] circumcision eight day later, his mother
[18:07] gave him the name and his father gave
[18:09] him the name of Jesus. He was Jesus
[18:12] Christ the Lord Jesus Christ. Then he
[18:16] was Lord when he was born he was Christ
[18:18] the Lord. And then when he received his
[18:21] name with Jesus that made him Jesus
[18:23] Christ the Lord. Amen. That's exactly
[18:25] what was revealed to Peter. You know who
[18:27] John and Mary was when he said go
[18:29] baptize in the name of father, son, holy
[18:31] ghost. So it could be revealed because
[18:34] Jesus know that Peter had the gift of
[18:36] revelation.
[18:39] He know because it already been revealed
[18:41] to him by the spirit above. And when God
[18:43] sees that a man can receive revelations
[18:45] from above, he can trust that man do
[18:48] something with him when it's revealed to
[18:49] him because he said no man can reveal
[18:51] this but his father. God's the only one
[18:53] who can reveal it. He know Peter and was
[18:56] in contact with the spirit. So he Peter
[18:58] knowed the revelation and then he went
[18:59] up there and said repent and be baptized
[19:01] in the name of Jesus Christ for
[19:02] remission of his sins. Now just a few
[19:05] days before that Jesus told Peter the
[19:07] same time when he told him who the
[19:08] revelation was upon this rock I'll build
[19:11] my church and gates of hell shall not
[19:12] prevail against it. And I say thou art
[19:15] Peter and I'll give thee the keys
[19:19] oh the keys to the kingdom.
[19:23] Praise the Lord. I'll give you the keys.
[19:26] Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind it
[19:28] in heaven. What you loose on earth, I'll
[19:31] loose in heaven. Then on the day of
[19:32] Pentecost at the inauguration of the
[19:34] church, 10 days after Jesus said, go
[19:37] baptized in in the name of the father,
[19:38] son, holy ghost, Peter by spiritual
[19:40] revelation. No, there was no such a
[19:41] thing as name of father, son, holy
[19:43] ghost. When nobody else taught that to a
[19:44] Catholic age. Amen. And every person's
[19:47] baptized in the name of father, son,
[19:48] holy ghost is actually baptized in the
[19:50] Catholic faith. Amen. Right? Not in
[19:52] Christian baptism. There was reference.
[19:54] Now on the day of Pentecost, they were
[19:57] all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[19:58] speaking in tongues and and acting like
[20:00] they were drunk. And they were drunk.
[20:03] They were drunk on new wine. The new
[20:05] wine had come from heaven out of Canaan
[20:06] and above. And when they were all
[20:08] screaming and shouting and acting like
[20:11] they were drunk and so forth, Peter
[20:12] stood up in the midst of them and told
[20:14] them that they were not drunk, but they
[20:15] were they were this was that that the
[20:18] prophet had said would come to pass. He
[20:19] poured out his spirit. And now they they
[20:22] said, "Man and brethren, what can we
[20:24] do?"
[20:27] Man and brethren, what can we do? That's
[20:30] the question. How are we going to get
[20:32] it? Amen. Who's got the keys? Come here,
[20:34] Simon.
[20:36] You got the keys. Well, I'm going off
[20:37] your side. What are you going to say? I
[20:39] remember Jesus Christ said, "If you
[20:41] abide on earth, I'll abide in heaven."
[20:44] If you loosen on earth, I'll loose in
[20:45] heaven. If he's God, he has to keep his
[20:47] word. Amen. Amen. Now you Catholic
[20:51] priest, show me your forgiveness of
[20:53] sins. A Catholic priest told me one time
[20:56] said, "Didn't Jesus say, "Whoever sins
[20:57] you remit to them, they're remitted."
[20:59] That's what he said it. "Whoever sins
[21:00] you retain, to them, they're retained."
[21:02] Yeah, that's whoever you forgive,
[21:03] they're forgiven. Whoever you don't
[21:05] forgive, they're not forgiven. I said,
[21:06] "That's correctly what it said." He
[21:07] said, "Then didn't Christ give his
[21:09] church, which we are his church, the
[21:11] power to forgive sins on earth."
[21:13] Certainly did. I said, "Now, if you'll
[21:16] forgive him the same way that they
[21:17] forgive him, I'll go with you." Amen.
[21:21] I said, "How' they forgive him?" They
[21:23] tell him, "Go do an Oveni or something
[21:24] way you do." No, sir. Peter said,
[21:27] "Repent."
[21:29] Amen. Amen. Repent every one of you.
[21:33] Amen. And be baptized in the name of
[21:35] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[21:37] sins. And then you shall receive the
[21:38] gift of the Holy Ghost. The key went
[21:40] click on earth and went click in heaven.
[21:42] That's it.
[21:45] That's the reason when Paul met some had
[21:47] already been baptized for the same man
[21:48] had baptized Jesus. He said, "Have you
[21:51] received the Holy Ghost since you
[21:52] believed?" He said, "We know that there
[21:53] be a Holy Ghost." He said, "The what?"
[21:55] You take the Greek word said, "How was
[21:57] you baptized?" They said unto John.
[21:59] Said, "That won't work anymore."
[22:01] Heaven's done closed. Come be baptized
[22:03] in the name of Jesus Christ. So they
[22:05] heard this. They were baptized over
[22:07] again in the name of Jesus Christ. And
[22:08] when they did, Paul laid his hands on
[22:10] them. The Holy Ghost came upon them. He
[22:11] spoke in tongues and prophesied. Oh,
[22:14] brother. That's back in the beginning.
[22:16] That's exactly that's the open door that
[22:18] was set right here. Geographically, it's
[22:21] right. The evening lights and every
[22:23] scripture in the Bible leads right to
[22:25] it. We could stand here for hours and we
[22:27] got 15 more minutes time about 35
[22:31] different comments to make here.
[22:34] We'll get them in the morning if we
[22:35] don't get them tonight. All right. Now,
[22:38] all right. and no man shutth it. Or thou
[22:42] has a little strength and has kept my
[22:44] word. All right. And has not denied my
[22:47] name.

[46:07] of the Lord.
[46:12] Amen.
[46:14] Amen. just like to share something that
[46:16] has been uh going through my mind the
[46:19] last week. I was reading a little
[46:21] devotional book and came across
[46:22] something that uh Hudson Taylor had said
[46:26] and how many have heard of Hudson Taylor
[46:28] missionary to the AA Indians and um
[46:33] we're had this on my heart and the first
[46:35] song we're singing here I am to worship
[46:37] but talk about how Christ all for love's
[46:39] sake became poor and Hudson Taylor was
[46:42] was born in a wealthy family I believe
[46:44] he was going to medical school and felt
[46:46] the call to be a missionary and just
[46:48] like you know I just going to have to be
[46:50] a big change for me in in my life and my
[46:53] expectations, but I need to get to where
[46:56] I just completely depend on God. And I
[46:58] remember reading his um his biography
[47:01] and one time before he left um England,
[47:07] he's like, I need to get to where God
[47:09] proves himself just like with David
[47:11] where he killed the lion and the bear
[47:13] before he's ready to take on Goliath.
[47:14] And he was like, I need to be able to
[47:16] trust God. So he was working for a guy
[47:19] and the the man that he was working for
[47:22] it knew the family well and but the guy
[47:24] was a good boss but he didn't pay on a
[47:26] regular basis and he would pay but maybe
[47:29] two three months would go by like Hudson
[47:31] I'm sorry I forgot to pay you. Here's
[47:33] your wages for the last three months.
[47:35] Well that can be difficult to pay your
[47:37] bills if you have monthly bills or
[47:40] get groceries every day. Um, and so
[47:43] Hudson was like, "You know what? I am
[47:45] going to," his boss told him, "Look, if
[47:47] I forget, just tell me." And so it was
[47:49] just a little thing, but Hudson said,
[47:50] "You know, I'm I'm going to I'm going to
[47:53] just take God at his word that he will
[47:56] he's he's he's my provider and I'm going
[47:59] to believe that and I need to be able to
[48:01] trust on him and not take matters into
[48:03] my own hands."
[48:04] So, he just purposed in his heart, I'm
[48:06] not going to ask my boss for the money
[48:10] regardless of how badly I need it. And
[48:13] so, um, his rent was due and he was
[48:17] like, "Okay, today is due and Lord, I I
[48:20] I don't want to be your servant and and
[48:23] have this reputation that I'm not able
[48:25] to to pay my bills." And so he's uh he's
[48:29] at work, half an hour left in the day.
[48:31] And and you know, his boss, you know,
[48:34] Hudson's like, "Okay, God, you know, I'm
[48:36] waiting on you." And about a half an
[48:39] hour left. He says, "Hudson, it's been a
[48:40] while since I paid you, hadn't it?" And
[48:42] he, "Yes, sir. Well, it's" He says,
[48:45] "Well, I'll take I'll take care of that
[48:47] Monday." It was a Friday. And um he's
[48:50] like, "Okay." You know, that's God's
[48:52] going to provide somehow. And so he um
[48:57] um he left
[48:59] and and later that evening after dinner
[49:01] he's walking down the street he runs
[49:02] into his boss Hudson. He says come here.
[49:05] He says after you left somebody came and
[49:08] paid us in cash for you know a large
[49:11] bill that was owed. So here I have your
[49:13] wages here for the last three months and
[49:15] paid him a couple hours left in the day
[49:17] but he was able to go and pay his rent
[49:19] before. So, you know, he um he left a
[49:23] comfortable lifestyle and one of the
[49:24] quotes that we're so acquainted with was
[49:27] with Hudson Taylor was that one that
[49:29] said, "He is no fool who gives what he
[49:32] cannot keep to gain that which he cannot
[49:34] lose." So, he gave up his earthly
[49:36] possessions and traded it in for for
[49:39] eternal life for the exceedingly great
[49:42] riches that Paul talks about. And um so
[49:46] that's the that's the quote that we're
[49:47] so familiar with. But I I came across
[49:49] another one this week and just thinking
[49:51] about the
[49:54] mountains in our life and the tests and
[49:56] the trials that pastor's been talking to
[49:59] us about the tutors that that that
[50:02] children had back in in Bible days and
[50:05] how that the Holy Spirit is our tutor
[50:06] today. And and and God loves to test his
[50:09] children. And um so just you know along
[50:13] those lines I was reading this little
[50:16] devotional and
[50:18] this was what Hudson Taylor said about
[50:21] he says in every he says there are three
[50:24] stages in every great work of God. First
[50:27] it is impossible
[50:29] then it is difficult then it is done.
[50:32] And that just that just hit home with
[50:35] me. First it's impossible, then it's
[50:38] difficult, and this is then it's done.
[50:40] Think of Mount Everest. You know, 150
[50:42] years ago, people looked at it
[50:44] impossible, could never be climbed.
[50:46] People tried it, they lost their lives.
[50:48] Today, there's hundreds, sometimes
[50:51] there's a hundred in a day that climb
[50:54] it. And so, you know, it's just a matter
[50:56] of perspective, but from God's
[50:58] perspective,
[51:00] it's done. It's finished. And I'm just
[51:02] I'm so thankful for that. So, Before we
[51:05] brought the prayer request, I just
[51:06] wanted to to to share that. And and then
[51:10] one one other thing that just struck me
[51:14] this morning um was along those same
[51:18] lines.
[51:19] This is the front of our of our
[51:22] bulletin.
[51:24] And we see this so much. Be still and
[51:27] know that I am God. But I just want to
[51:33] go with you into the Psalm 46. And maybe
[51:36] we could just read that because that's a
[51:38] psalm not about we always, you know, I I
[51:41] grew up, you walk into church, be still
[51:43] and know that I'm God. Be still and I
[51:44] know that I'm God. And it's like, let's
[51:46] be reverent. Let's be quiet. But in
[51:48] context of that chapter,
[51:50] God is talking about all of the awesome
[51:54] things that he's done, that he will do,
[51:57] that he can do. and he's saying, you
[51:59] know, just sit back and watch because
[52:02] I'm an awesome God. And so I I think as
[52:05] we come into church and we see this,
[52:07] don't look at it as, you know what, I'm
[52:09] here to be quiet. No, I'm here because
[52:12] we serve an awesome God and he
[52:15] specializes in things thought
[52:17] impossible. So just maybe we can just
[52:20] read this and just maybe it'll change
[52:22] your thinking a little bit about this
[52:23] verse. It did mine when I when I took it
[52:26] into context.
[52:28] says, "God is our refuge and strength, a
[52:30] very present help in trouble. Therefore
[52:33] will not we fear, though the earth be
[52:36] removed."
[52:40] I'm going to just stay with on there.
[52:43] Uh, and though the mountains be carried
[52:44] into the midst of the sea, though the
[52:46] waters thereof roar and be troubled,
[52:48] though the mountains shake with the
[52:50] swelling thereof, seal, there is a
[52:53] river, the streams whereof shall make
[52:56] glad the city of God, the holy place of
[52:58] the tabernacles of the most high. God is
[53:01] in the midst of her. She shall not be
[53:03] moved. God shall help her. And that
[53:06] right early, the heathen raged, the
[53:08] kingdoms were moved. He uttered his
[53:09] voice. The earth melted. The Lord of
[53:12] hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is
[53:14] our refuge. Cila, come behold the works
[53:17] of the Lord. What desolations he hath
[53:20] made in the earth. He maketh wars to
[53:22] cease unto the end of the earth. He
[53:25] breakth the bow and cutth the spear and
[53:28] sunder. He burneth the chariot and the
[53:29] fire. Be still and know that I am God. I
[53:33] will be exalted among the heathen. I'll
[53:35] be exalted in the earth. The Lord of
[53:38] hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is
[53:40] our refuge. So the whole thing is
[53:42] talking about how God is with us. And
[53:44] just just watch. Look at the impossible
[53:46] things that he's done. And so be still
[53:49] and know that I am God.
[53:52] He is God. He doesn't never change. He's
[53:54] the same yesterday, today, forever.
[53:56] Amen. So let's just stand together this
[53:59] morning.
[54:01] As the brother Joe Galante comes to
[54:04] bring the request to us, you just want
[54:06] to think of the Mount Everest in your
[54:08] life, what you think is impossible.
[54:11] God's already said is done, but we'll
[54:14] just sing that chorus. God, any rivers
[54:17] you think are uncrossable?
[54:20] God in any rivers
[54:25] you think car
[54:29] uncrossable
[54:32] God any mountains
[54:37] that you can't tunnel
[54:41] through
[54:45] God specializes
[54:51] in things thought
[54:55] impossible.
[54:58] And he will do
[55:03] what
[55:05] no other
[55:08] power
[55:10] can do.
[55:16] [Music]
[55:19] God bless everyone.

[56:51] become new to everyone. May you save,
[56:54] Lord, and heal and deliver and fill with
[56:56] your spirit, Lord. And everything uh
[57:01] Sister Eloise needs, we pray that you
[57:03] would just grant it, Father. Thank you,
[57:06] Lord, for what you've done with Sister
[57:08] Snow. Lord, Brother Snow, Brother Robert
[57:11] here. Lord, we thank you for the Pole
[57:13] family, Lord. Keep them safe, Lord, as
[57:16] they would be traveling back tomorrow.
[57:18] Lord, we pray today's meetings would be
[57:21] a great blessing there in Canada also.
[57:24] Thank you for their lives, Lord, and
[57:26] their dedication, Lord, the whole
[57:27] family, Lord, and the music ministry.
[57:30] Father, Lord, for everyone here today
[57:33] that may have some something on their
[57:35] heart, Lord, we pray that you'd meet
[57:36] them in a special way, Lord, as the word
[57:39] comes forth, Lord, that you just quicken
[57:41] it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[57:44] And we'll thank you for it. Amen. Amen.
[57:49] Oh, there is nothing.
[57:52] [Music]
[57:55] Oh, there's nothing

[58:04] that my God can do.

[58:24] There is nothing,
[58:26] no nothing
[58:30] that my God
[58:32] can do.
[58:36] Amen. You can be seated.
[58:40] I don't know that we've sung this song
[58:42] as a congregational, but the words for
[58:44] it. Joy knows it. I know it. Just follow
[58:46] along and and it'll be a blessing to
[58:48] you. Think of the words. If you don't
[58:50] know it, just read the words and it'll
[58:51] encourage you. So,
[58:56] Even though I walk through the valley of
[59:01] the shadow of death,
[59:05] your perfect love is casting out fear.
[59:10] [Music]
[59:12] And even when I'm caught
[59:15] in the middle of the storms of this
[59:18] life,
[59:21] I won't turn back. I know you are near
[59:26] and I will fear no evil
[59:31] [Music]
[59:34] for my God is with
[59:40] me.
[59:42] And if my God is with
[59:46] [Music]
[59:48] me,
[59:50] whom then shall I fear?
[59:54] Whom then shall I fear?
[1:00:00] Oh no, you never let go through the calm
[1:00:05] and through the storm. Oh no, you never
[1:00:10] let go in every high and every low. Oh
[1:00:16] no, you never let go. Lord, you never
[1:00:20] let go of me.
[1:00:29] And I can see a light
[1:00:32] that is coming for the heart that holds
[1:00:36] on.
[1:00:38] It's a glorious light beyond all
[1:00:42] compare.
[1:00:45] And there will be an end to these
[1:00:48] troubles.
[1:00:50] But until that day comes,
[1:00:54] we'll live to know you here on the
[1:00:58] earth.
[1:01:00] And I will fear no evil.
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:08] For my God is with
[1:01:14] me.
[1:01:15] And if my God is with
[1:01:21] me,
[1:01:23] then whom then shall I fear?
[1:01:27] Whom then shall I fear?

[1:01:38] caling, through the storm. Oh no, you
[1:01:43] never let go. in every high, every low.
[1:01:49] No, you never let go. Lord, you never
[1:01:54] let go of me.
[1:01:59] Yes, I can see a light that is coming
[1:02:03] for the heart that holds on. And there
[1:02:07] will be an end to these troubles. But
[1:02:11] until that day comes,
[1:02:16] still I will praise you.
[1:02:20] Still I will praise
[1:02:23] you.
[1:02:25] Yes, I can see a life that is coming for
[1:02:30] the heart that holds on. And there will
[1:02:34] be an end to these troubles.
[1:02:38] But until that day comes, how many want
[1:02:41] to say, "Lord, but I will praise you."
[1:02:46] Still, I will praise
[1:02:50] you.
[1:02:54] Oh no, you never let go. Through the
[1:02:58] calm, through the storm.
[1:03:01] Oh no, you never let go. and every high,
[1:03:07] every low. Oh no, you never let go.
[1:03:12] Lord, you never let go of me. One more
[1:03:17] time. Oh no.
[1:03:20] Oh no, you never let go. Through the
[1:03:25] calm, through the storm.
[1:03:28] Oh no, you never let go. In every high
[1:03:33] and every low
[1:03:37] you never let go. Lord, you never let go
[1:03:42] of me.
[1:03:48] Amen. As our brother Robson comes to
[1:03:50] introduce the tape this morning, we'll
[1:03:51] just sing one more song together. This
[1:03:53] one we all know. My heart was distressed
[1:03:58] neath Jehovah's. Well, I just need to be
[1:04:00] in the right key, don't we? Stay in G.
[1:04:03] It's um I I'm singing the wrong one.
[1:04:06] That would help if I looked at the right
[1:04:08] one. We're singing He Abides and that's
[1:04:10] in the key of G. And I was singing I'm
[1:04:13] sorry. I was singing He brought me out
[1:04:14] of the myy clay. We're going to sing He
[1:04:16] Abides and it is in the key of G. So,
[1:04:21] all right. I'm rejoicing night and day
[1:04:25] as I walk the narrow way.
[1:04:29] to God. All my life I see.
[1:04:34] And the reason of my bliss, the secret
[1:04:38] all is this, that the comforter abides
[1:04:43] with me.
[1:04:46] Yes, he abides.
[1:04:49] He abides.
[1:04:52] Hallelujah. He abides with me.
[1:04:58] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[1:05:02] the narrow. Brother Joe, as we sing the
[1:05:04] last verse, he's with me everywhere.
[1:05:07] [Music]
[1:05:10] Oh, he is with me everywhere.
[1:05:14] He knows my every care. I'm as happy as
[1:05:19] a burden, just as free.
[1:05:23] For the spirit has control. Oh Jesus
[1:05:27] sisfies my soul now the comforter of
[1:05:35] He abides.
[1:05:38] He abides.
[1:05:42] Halleluah. He abides with Let's stand

[1:05:49] night and day as thou art and there will
[1:05:54] for the comfort of my
[1:06:00] There's no thirsting for the things of
[1:06:03] the world they've taken place long ago I
[1:06:08] gave them up instantly
[1:06:13] my night was turned to day all my burden
[1:06:18] way. Now the comfort of my me.
[1:06:25] He abides.
[1:06:28] He abides.
[1:06:31] Hallelujah. He abides in me.
[1:06:37] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[1:06:41] the narrow way. for the comforter abides
[1:06:46] with me. Let's listen to him play a
[1:06:50] verse.
[1:07:01] [Music]
[1:07:14] Beise,
[1:07:17] be of us.
[1:07:20] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:07:22] Be abides with me.
[1:07:26] Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[1:07:30] walk the narrow way. For the comforter
[1:07:34] abides with me.
[1:07:40] Amen. Hallelujah. Praise his name this
[1:07:42] morning. So good to be with each one of
[1:07:44] you. Love to be in church. Love to sing
[1:07:46] that song. Brother John. Here I am to
[1:07:49] worship. You know, we've been talking
[1:07:51] and thinking and listening and hearing
[1:07:53] about being tested and tried. He was
[1:07:55] telling my story the other day. How the
[1:07:56] devil will tell you this thing, that
[1:07:58] thing, take you through the other thing.
[1:08:00] Only the Lord allowing it though. And
[1:08:02] we're being tested because we know
[1:08:03] character is a victory. Just not a gift.
[1:08:05] I give you character today, Brother Joe.
[1:08:08] No, I've kind of had to earn it
[1:08:09] different ways. And you see the little
[1:08:11] problems and things. It's just a test.
[1:08:13] And I I just keep my test. I hear about
[1:08:15] your test, but I'm just going to keep
[1:08:16] mine because a lot of times mine seem a
[1:08:19] lot easier. And so just real thankful to
[1:08:21] be in church. We missed the pose, but
[1:08:23] just trust uh in the perfect will of the
[1:08:27] Lord this morning. And
[1:08:29] yeah, I was just touched. If you weren't
[1:08:31] here on Wednesday, make sure to listen
[1:08:32] to that. If if the Lord would give you
[1:08:34] the time, if you could take the time to
[1:08:36] do that, it'll tell teach you about
[1:08:37] those tests and how we sometimes it's
[1:08:40] the same test Brother Joe's got to go
[1:08:42] through to to make sure we're getting on
[1:08:44] track. So, do that. Listen to that. The
[1:08:46] Lord would teach you and lead you that
[1:08:48] way. And uh just been so good to be
[1:08:51] reminded of these things. Brother Rams
[1:08:54] tells us constantly we're in the last
[1:08:56] days and we know what the time piece is
[1:08:58] and people are wondering and did we
[1:09:01] successful there or not and how's Israel
[1:09:03] doing today but with the time piece
[1:09:05] reminding us to get ready. So want to do
[1:09:07] that this morning we'll be listening to
[1:09:09] Jezebel religion Elijah and talking
[1:09:13] about there's not going to be any rain
[1:09:15] till I call for it. So what would that
[1:09:17] mean today for God's people? You know,
[1:09:20] sometimes I get a little daydreamy in
[1:09:22] the back, but let's hear from heaven
[1:09:24] this morning. Something Elijah would
[1:09:26] tell us about the rain. Speaking of
[1:09:28] rain, our precious sister. So nice to
[1:09:30] hear this report of our precious sister
[1:09:32] Lori come back to the dry desert from
[1:09:35] the Seattle area and maybe she'll maybe
[1:09:37] the Lord would allow her to bring some
[1:09:39] rain our way or he would touch us this
[1:09:41] week. I think that might be in the
[1:09:42] forecast. So let him speak to you, rain
[1:09:45] on you this morning. Only believe as we
[1:09:47] go to this table.
[1:09:50] Only
[1:09:51] believe,
[1:09:56] only
[1:09:59] [Music]
[1:10:02] all things they are possible
[1:10:06] if we would only
[1:10:10] be.
[1:10:14] Only
[1:10:15] believe.
[1:10:19] Only
[1:10:21] believe.
[1:10:25] All things are possible.
[1:10:31] Only. Let's confess that we are
[1:10:34] believers this morning. Yes, Lord,
[1:10:39] I believe.
[1:10:43] Lord,
[1:10:45] I believe
[1:10:49] all things are possible.
[1:10:54] Say, Lord, I
[1:10:57] believe.
[1:11:00] Lord,
[1:11:02] I believe.
[1:11:06] Lord,
[1:11:08] I believe.
[1:11:12] All things are possible
[1:11:18] Lord I believe.
[1:11:23] Amen. Brother Van
[1:11:29] let's remain standing just a moment
[1:11:31] while we offer God thanks today. Let's
[1:11:33] bow our hands.
[1:11:35] Gracious and holy father God, we are so
[1:11:39] glad that you are a a God and a very
[1:11:42] pleasant help in the time of trouble. We
[1:11:46] thank you for what you have done for us.
[1:11:49] We just cannot express from our hearts
[1:11:53] how we appreciate this and how you've
[1:11:55] come to our rescue when we're in
[1:11:58] trouble. We have learned through the
[1:12:00] years to trust you and believe you. And
[1:12:02] I pray this afternoon, Lord, that you'll
[1:12:05] pour your blessings upon this people.
[1:12:08] May there not be a feeble person in our
[1:12:10] midst when this service is ended. If
[1:12:12] there would be one in here who's not
[1:12:14] right with God, may the power that
[1:12:16] raised Jesus from the grave quicken
[1:12:18] their mortal bodies, Lord, in their soul
[1:12:20] and turn them to you. Granted, Lord,
[1:12:23] those without the Holy Spirit, may this
[1:12:25] be the one great day that they'll never
[1:12:28] forget. or may it be the day that God
[1:12:31] pours his spirit upon man. Granted,
[1:12:34] Lord, forgive our sins. We would pray
[1:12:37] that you would bless Brother Sullivan,
[1:12:39] our gracious and precious friend, and
[1:12:43] his thoughts for the people, and to try
[1:12:47] to bring them every possibility that he
[1:12:50] can to help them. I pray that you'll
[1:12:52] bless brother Sullivan. Bless the
[1:12:55] ministers throughout the land
[1:12:56] everywhere. Give to them exceeding
[1:12:59] abundance. Lord, may they stand gallant
[1:13:02] in the pulpit and proclaim the word of
[1:13:04] God. For we're living in the closing
[1:13:06] hours of the history of this world. Let
[1:13:10] thy goodness overshadow us in these
[1:13:13] times. For we ask it in Jesus name.
[1:13:16] Amen. We be seated.
[1:13:23] I am so grateful to you people as to God
[1:13:28] for this.
[1:13:30] Brother Sullivan tuck it up on himself.
[1:13:34] You see, it would be right for brother
[1:13:36] Sullivan to do that. So, we were fix to
[1:13:39] prepare for it. We thank you for your
[1:13:41] kindness and now for the the blood
[1:13:44] offering. If you didn't have to do that,
[1:13:47] you know, that wasn't necessary.
[1:13:50] Just uh they paid the expenses, the
[1:13:52] hotel and the food, what we had that
[1:13:55] that's all was necessary. But thank you
[1:13:58] very kindly and it'll go to help
[1:14:02] missionary and bring people to God. It
[1:14:05] won't be any cigarettes bought with it,
[1:14:07] any whiskey, nothing. It's wrong. It'll
[1:14:09] go for the right thing. And I pray that
[1:14:12] God will put that on your account up
[1:14:14] there. and multiply it by 10,000 each
[1:14:18] dollar, a penny or nickel that you gave
[1:14:21] towards this service. And now I want to
[1:14:25] thank the
[1:14:27] United States Army for letting us have
[1:14:30] this building, the setting to have these
[1:14:33] services.
[1:14:35] I certainly do thank them with all my
[1:14:37] heart and as I understand Sullivan said
[1:14:40] everything will be paid up right. We've
[1:14:43] never left a city yet on one cent what
[1:14:46] everything is taken care of. We just
[1:14:47] don't believe in anything else. Um you
[1:14:50] mustn't owe anyone. You must be square
[1:14:52] and straight. And if you owe somebody,
[1:14:54] go face them and tell them that you owe
[1:14:56] them, but just give you a little time,
[1:14:57] you'll pay. See, always that's a better
[1:15:01] that's a good mark of Christianity being
[1:15:03] honest upright. You want to live just
[1:15:06] what you talk about. If you don't live
[1:15:08] it yourself, how you expect somebody
[1:15:10] else to live it? See, so you are written
[1:15:12] epistles read of all men. So always be
[1:15:15] honest, just true. Tell the truth. No
[1:15:18] matter how bad it hurts something, tell
[1:15:20] the truth anyhow. Of course, you can
[1:15:22] always tell it the same way each time.
[1:15:24] And if you tell a lie, you'll have to go
[1:15:26] a million miles around and still you
[1:15:28] come back to that lie again and you just
[1:15:29] made an awful thing. Just be honest, and
[1:15:31] you can always tell it the same way
[1:15:33] because it's the truth. That's the way
[1:15:35] it's the Bible. Tell it just the way the
[1:15:37] Bible says it. Don't compromise with it.
[1:15:39] see it just that way. If it's written
[1:15:41] right here and and you can point your
[1:15:43] finger to this. It's that that's where
[1:15:46] you defeat Satan.
[1:15:48] Satan said to Jesus, "If thou be the son
[1:15:50] of God, let's see you perform a miracle.
[1:15:52] They say you're a miracle worker. Turn
[1:15:54] these stones to bread and let's see
[1:15:56] you're hungry." He said, "But it is
[1:15:57] written, man shall not live by bread
[1:15:59] alone." He took the father's word and
[1:16:02] defeated the devil right on his own
[1:16:04] ground. So you can do the same thing.
[1:16:07] defeat the devil on his grounds with the
[1:16:10] word of the law.
[1:16:12] Then I will always be grateful to
[1:16:14] brother Sullivan.
[1:16:17] This
[1:16:19] excuse this expression
[1:16:21] highly when they made brother Sullivan
[1:16:23] they throw away the pattern.
[1:16:26] None of you there's only one man I ever
[1:16:28] met in my life that reminded me of
[1:16:30] brother Sullivan. That was eh Howard
[1:16:32] Cable. I don't know whether he ever know
[1:16:33] him or not from the from brother Caleb
[1:16:36] was just a good old country boy like
[1:16:39] brother Sullivan and he'd stick his
[1:16:41] hands down his pocket so far to his
[1:16:43] suspenders and draw way down talking his
[1:16:46] head sideways and he was just one eh
[1:16:48] hard kid and so I'm I'm so glad to have
[1:16:52] brother Sullivan as a friend and a
[1:16:55] brother in the gospel
[1:16:58] and I pray that God will bless him and
[1:17:00] his little church up here, his precious
[1:17:04] wife,
[1:17:05] his loved ones,
[1:17:07] and to you, the other ministers that's
[1:17:10] here, to you and your congregation, full
[1:17:14] gospel preachers
[1:17:17] upon all the little technical things of
[1:17:19] the scripture, we might disagree with
[1:17:21] one another. I disagree with my wife on
[1:17:25] some things. You know what that's on?
[1:17:30] She likes
[1:17:32] apple pie and I like cherry.
[1:17:35] So we disagreed. Now I tell you what I
[1:17:38] do with mine. I like a good hot piece of
[1:17:41] cherry pie. I can stand it right now
[1:17:46] and pour butter on top of it. Then pour
[1:17:49] molasses on top of that. Or rather you
[1:17:52] got something to eat.
[1:17:54] My wife's afraid of it. I think she's
[1:17:56] afraid of the calories.
[1:17:59] she might like it, but you know how the
[1:18:01] women are. They're afraid they get so
[1:18:02] thin you could stick them with a pen,
[1:18:03] cut them to the bone, and yet they want
[1:18:05] to they want to reduce. That's the
[1:18:08] nature of them, I guess. So, and um but
[1:18:11] I like that and we disagree upon that.
[1:18:14] Other things were all right, but you
[1:18:15] see, we're not perfectly in agreement.
[1:18:18] So, we would see the same thing,
[1:18:20] brethren. But the main thing, we're
[1:18:23] eating time.
[1:18:25] That's the main heaven principally upon
[1:18:28] the baptism of the Holy Spirit in the
[1:18:30] coming of Christ and the great
[1:18:32] evangelical fundamental doctrines of the
[1:18:34] Bible. We certainly stand arm in arm
[1:18:37] with that as one big united brethren
[1:18:43] without a denominational barrier without
[1:18:46] anything to hinder us. We marched
[1:18:48] towards calary
[1:18:50] as one great army together.
[1:18:53] If I can ever be of any help to you,
[1:18:56] I'll be glad to do it.
[1:18:59] And I'm sure you'd say the same thing to
[1:19:00] me and you can be a help to me. And
[1:19:04] that's one thing you can do that I know
[1:19:06] is pray for me. That God will never let
[1:19:09] me go wrong. I I it's not in my heart to
[1:19:12] go wrong. I I want to go right. I want
[1:19:14] to do what's right because I realize
[1:19:18] as brother Jack Moore told me one time,
[1:19:20] he said, "Brother Brandon, I wouldn't
[1:19:22] stand in your boots for all your
[1:19:23] experience at the day of the judgment
[1:19:25] because God's going to require you a
[1:19:27] great answer."
[1:19:29] That because he's given you millions of
[1:19:32] people in your hands.
[1:19:34] Now, if I'm no longer going to stand
[1:19:35] there and answer for those people, then
[1:19:37] what kind of a gospel have I got to
[1:19:40] preach? What kind of a sincerity want to
[1:19:43] hold the purchase of his blood in my
[1:19:45] hands? And as he's given me a gift uh
[1:19:49] beyond a shadow doubt any sensible
[1:19:51] thinking person would know it has to
[1:19:52] come from God. And with that if I lead
[1:19:54] somebody off on the wrong path just
[1:19:56] because a certain group said that God
[1:19:59] would make me pay for it at the day of
[1:20:00] the judgment. But when I seen the vision
[1:20:03] here not long ago and heard them people
[1:20:05] scream out. Did you get your little book
[1:20:06] last night? The businessman's voice.
[1:20:09] That's good. And in the vision sometime
[1:20:13] we'll have it printed in full detail.
[1:20:15] That's not all of it. But in that and
[1:20:18] seeing that and I stood there just as
[1:20:22] just as I'm standing right now and I was
[1:20:24] looking at myself laying there on the
[1:20:26] bed watching my wife and yet standing
[1:20:28] here looking at myself and here was
[1:20:30] those people standing around like that
[1:20:32] when I said will Paul have to be judged
[1:20:35] for the gospel he preached. Said yes. I
[1:20:37] said, I preached every word just exactly
[1:20:40] the way he did and the million street
[1:20:42] out. We are resting on that.
[1:20:46] That's the way I want it to be. Want to
[1:20:47] cross everything. I want to be that way.
[1:20:49] Just like that. Just what Paul said. I
[1:20:52] want to add one thing to it. Take one
[1:20:53] thing away from it. Just what the Bible
[1:20:55] said. That's the way I want to keep it
[1:20:56] going. So, and of course you keep it
[1:20:59] like that. Denominations on every side
[1:21:02] is going to rise up a barrier against
[1:21:04] it. And then many times the brethren
[1:21:06] think that I'm against my brothers.
[1:21:10] God knows different than that. As long
[1:21:12] as he knows what's true. See, it's not
[1:21:14] against brethren. It's a system that's
[1:21:17] make us not to be brothers. It isn't the
[1:21:19] word of God keep us from being brothers.
[1:21:21] It's the system that we join into that
[1:21:24] keeps us from being brothers. That's
[1:21:26] right. So where must we stand? Stand on
[1:21:29] the word and God will draw men to it.
[1:21:32] That's right. moment that don't never
[1:21:34] organize it, denominational it just keep
[1:21:37] it though in God and just keep moving
[1:21:39] on. Just watching the end, hold steady.
[1:21:42] God will bring the rest better.
[1:21:48] There's been some many things you've
[1:21:49] done for me. I appreciate it. Now,
[1:21:53] if I can help you towards giving you a
[1:21:55] prayer cloth or something.
[1:21:58] Now don't ask me doctrine
[1:22:01] because I I don't desire to do that. So
[1:22:04] many people writes me questions about
[1:22:06] marriage and divorce and so forth which
[1:22:07] is a tangle in the church. I always
[1:22:10] refer them back and say ask your pastor.
[1:22:14] People's wrote me letters here and say
[1:22:15] what about this and what about that? I
[1:22:16] refer the letter back. You'll get it.
[1:22:19] See your pastor on little things because
[1:22:21] after all he's your shepherd. He he's
[1:22:24] he's the one that God sent to watch over
[1:22:26] you. And we might disagree upon it, then
[1:22:29] that cause a confusion in your church.
[1:22:30] We don't want that. No, no. We just want
[1:22:33] you to quit doing things that's sinful,
[1:22:35] things out of the Bible, just keep
[1:22:36] moving on towards God. See, and if you
[1:22:39] cause little frictions and things like
[1:22:40] that, that upsets the church. So, I'd
[1:22:43] rather your pastor tell you about
[1:22:44] marriage and divorce and these things
[1:22:46] and them things. Let him do it. He's
[1:22:48] God's servant, too, and he's equipped to
[1:22:52] do that. Remember the good Samaritan
[1:22:55] that found the man wounded. He brought
[1:22:58] him to the inn. That's the church. And
[1:23:00] gave the man there two pints and told
[1:23:02] him if he need any more. He pay him when
[1:23:04] he come. So he's got two pints. He's
[1:23:07] able to doctor up. If he's a man of God,
[1:23:10] if he's a man of God and stands on the
[1:23:12] word of God, he's got what God gave him.
[1:23:14] The spirit and the word. Is that right?
[1:23:17] How is it we're to worship in spirit and
[1:23:20] in truth? And the word is the truth. Is
[1:23:22] that right? Now,
[1:23:25] thank you very kindly again. And now I'm
[1:23:29] awfully tired and real tired of this
[1:23:31] afternoon. I never didn't stay in
[1:23:33] another hotel as long as I live. Big
[1:23:36] drunken party and all night long beating
[1:23:38] the doors and screaming and winning.
[1:23:42] I just sat up all night. That's all. And
[1:23:45] so I I never intend to have another
[1:23:48] hotel. I'll go to a motel. I'm going to
[1:23:51] get me a truck so I can sleep in it
[1:23:52] outside or the ground somewhere. I'm
[1:23:54] going get me a tent and a sleeping bag
[1:23:56] or somewhere where I can get to myself
[1:23:58] somewhere. That's right. It's so sinful
[1:24:00] this nation. No wonder it's honeycomb
[1:24:03] and rotting to the cold.
[1:24:06] Right up here in another place in your
[1:24:07] state, not only this state, everywhere.
[1:24:10] Right up here. A few years ago, I was in
[1:24:12] a religious meeting up here in the
[1:24:14] state, a big city. And that night a
[1:24:17] religious group, a Orthodox church with
[1:24:21] teenagers
[1:24:23] had a convention.
[1:24:26] I never I've been in Africa under a
[1:24:28] voodoo and everything. I never heard
[1:24:30] anything like that. And the next
[1:24:32] morning, I can't tell you exactly what a
[1:24:34] mixed audience laying on the floor
[1:24:36] immoral things that have been done.
[1:24:38] Whiskey bottles over and then young
[1:24:40] kids,
[1:24:42] boys and girls in the same room all
[1:24:44] night together. And the next morning,
[1:24:46] the Holy Father sitting out there come
[1:24:48] up bowing to him right now
[1:24:51] under the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:24:56] Have I gone crazy? What? What's the
[1:24:58] matter? I just can't stand those things.
[1:25:00] And something shakes me to pieces when I
[1:25:02] see that. Is that to represent my Lord
[1:25:05] Jesus? a drunken immoral party with
[1:25:09] immoral things that used on them young
[1:25:12] men and women laying on the floors and
[1:25:14] the waste baskets and bottles and oh my
[1:25:16] goodness. Could you call that
[1:25:19] Christianity? No wonder the world's in a
[1:25:21] sinful condition. Well, what does a
[1:25:23] sinner say when he looks at that?
[1:25:25] Thousands of them.
[1:25:28] Them young girls so drunk they couldn't
[1:25:30] hardly stand up and in the room all
[1:25:31] night them boys and all the dirty talk
[1:25:33] you ever heard in your life. I put
[1:25:35] pillars over my head like this to try to
[1:25:36] go to sleep
[1:25:39] out in the floors drunk and run up and
[1:25:41] down the floors like that. Religious.
[1:25:43] Now I can expect these sinful people
[1:25:46] like now that call themselves sports out
[1:25:47] here in a bowling game. One of my kids
[1:25:49] to start throwing a bowling alley out
[1:25:51] and running out of the country. Call
[1:25:53] that sport. That's not sport. What's
[1:25:56] this? If you want to be right, get right
[1:25:58] with God
[1:26:00] through
[1:26:03] I want to read for you just the words
[1:26:06] out of the Bible.
[1:26:08] You find this
[1:26:11] few words I want to read here text
[1:26:18] found in the 17th chapter first Kings
[1:26:20] first verse. As the Lord God of Israel
[1:26:24] liveth, before whom I stand, there shall
[1:26:28] not be due nor rain in these years
[1:26:33] according to my word.
[1:26:40] First Kings first chap uh 17th chapter
[1:26:44] first verse.
[1:26:47] If I can send you a prayer cloth
[1:26:49] anytime, just write it to me. My
[1:26:52] secretary here is present now. Brother
[1:26:54] Maguire, how many's ever got a prayer
[1:26:57] cloth from us? Let's see your hand.
[1:26:59] Stand up, brother Jim. I want to see you
[1:27:00] and your wife, too. Here's my secretary
[1:27:02] and his wife, the ones that works.
[1:27:04] That's a boy and girl that sends you
[1:27:05] your prayer cloth
[1:27:08] from the meeting. Both consecrated
[1:27:10] Christians. And the voice, that sweet
[1:27:13] little boy you hear on the phone when he
[1:27:14] call me, that's the little lady sitting
[1:27:16] there, his wife, her father, mother here
[1:27:19] with us today and and the loved ones all
[1:27:22] around. So, and then you know my field
[1:27:24] secretary, Mr. Mercer, brother Leo
[1:27:27] Mercer is here somewhere and brother
[1:27:28] Jean Golden and uh so if we can send you
[1:27:33] a prayer call anytime, anything we can
[1:27:34] do, pray for you on the phone, anything
[1:27:36] we can do, we'll do it.
[1:27:42] This strange looking man
[1:27:48] with his staff in his hand,
[1:27:51] his step study,
[1:27:54] his eyes gleaming with the glory of God,
[1:27:58] his beard glowing on the side,
[1:28:01] an old hairy piece of sheep skin wrapped
[1:28:04] around him. He's making his step just as
[1:28:07] sturdy as he walked down the road to
[1:28:11] Samaria.
[1:28:14] He wasn't very much to look at,
[1:28:17] but he had thus sayaith the Lord
[1:28:22] for that great nation of Israel.
[1:28:26] Yeah. Elijah the Tishbite,
[1:28:29] a prophet of the Lord.
[1:28:32] He wasn't much to look at, but he had
[1:28:35] the word of the Lord. He wasn't afraid
[1:28:38] to stand before the king, for he had
[1:28:41] been in the presence of greater than a
[1:28:43] king.
[1:28:45] He'd been in the presence of Jehovah.
[1:28:48] Therefore, he knew where he was
[1:28:50] standing.
[1:28:54] And when he walked before the king, he
[1:28:56] didn't stutter and stammer.
[1:28:58] He know what he was talking about.
[1:29:01] He could say to the king, "Thus saith
[1:29:05] the Lord God of Israel,
[1:29:07] there will be no rain or no doom
[1:29:12] until
[1:29:13] I call for it." Why did he say that?
[1:29:17] Till I call for it according to my word.
[1:29:19] Because he had the word of the Lord. He
[1:29:22] was a prophet.
[1:29:24] The prophet has the word of the Lord.
[1:29:29] It's a striking thing
[1:29:32] to see the parallel between
[1:29:35] Israel of the Old Testament
[1:29:38] and America.
[1:29:41] Now
[1:29:43] both of them are great nations.
[1:29:47] Both of them had been founded and their
[1:29:51] people had come there because of
[1:29:54] religious persecutions.
[1:29:59] Israel had been persecuted by Pharaoh
[1:30:05] and had been in bondage for hundreds of
[1:30:08] years.
[1:30:10] Or they were deprived of worshiping the
[1:30:12] true and living God
[1:30:15] and have been deprived of that privilege
[1:30:20] and they become slaves.
[1:30:24] But God had made them a promise in his
[1:30:26] Bible or in his word and by his prophets
[1:30:31] that he'd give them a land
[1:30:34] and they'd come into this land and drove
[1:30:36] back the occupants of that land and had
[1:30:39] possessed their inheritage.
[1:30:44] For God had a purpose of doing that.
[1:30:49] And so is this great nation of ours.
[1:30:55] We come here and on Plymouth Rock,
[1:30:59] this nation was founded
[1:31:03] on freedom of religion because our
[1:31:05] forefathers had fled
[1:31:10] Roman persecution
[1:31:13] of the modern Jezebel system
[1:31:17] and had come up and stood many great
[1:31:20] persecutions and martyrdom under that
[1:31:23] false system
[1:31:25] of Jezebel.
[1:31:28] And according to the Bible of
[1:31:30] Revelations the 13th chapter, God had
[1:31:32] promised them an oath and a place for
[1:31:36] the woman was carried into the
[1:31:38] wilderness where she was fed for a time,
[1:31:40] time, and a dividing of time.
[1:31:44] God had made the promise to America
[1:31:47] or to the church, to the woman to come
[1:31:51] into this country. Did you notice
[1:31:52] Revelations 13? All the other beasts
[1:31:55] that come up out of the sea waters.
[1:31:57] Revelation 17:17 said the waters which
[1:32:00] thou saw us as thickness and multitudes
[1:32:02] of people. All the other beasts that
[1:32:05] come up out of water, thickness and
[1:32:06] multitudes of people. But when the
[1:32:08] United States come up, it come up out of
[1:32:10] the earth where there was no people.
[1:32:13] And remember when it come up, it looked
[1:32:16] like a little lamb.
[1:32:19] Now a lamb has two horns
[1:32:23] and that's civil and ecclesiastical
[1:32:25] powers. But when they united remember
[1:32:28] then that lamb spoke like the dragon did
[1:32:31] before him and the dragon was wrong.
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:32:38] When the dragon stood before the woman
[1:32:40] to devour her child as soon as it was
[1:32:42] born, the red dragon
[1:32:45] who stood before the woman Israel to
[1:32:48] devour the child as soon as it was born
[1:32:49] and stand out of persecution, killed all
[1:32:51] the children from 2 years old. Rome
[1:32:56] the dragon
[1:32:59] stood at the woman to devour her child
[1:33:02] as soon as it was born.
[1:33:07] And then we find that this country came
[1:33:10] up as a freed country
[1:33:14] and was
[1:33:16] had a lamb which means the lamb of God.
[1:33:20] But after a while this same system
[1:33:24] that we have
[1:33:26] spoke like the dragon and exercised all
[1:33:30] the power the dragon had before him.
[1:33:38] They parallel one to the other
[1:33:40] perfectly.
[1:33:42] And remember
[1:33:44] when these Israel came up and took her
[1:33:49] homeland in Palestine,
[1:33:52] drove back all the occupants of that
[1:33:54] land and possessed the land. We came in
[1:33:57] and took it from the Indians, drove them
[1:33:59] back and possessed the land.
[1:34:02] God had a reason for that.
[1:34:05] God was going to show the world what he
[1:34:07] could do with a a little band of people
[1:34:10] that wanted freedom and freedom of
[1:34:13] religion to serve God.
[1:34:15] What did they do for Israel? He made
[1:34:18] Israel the most mightiest nation in the
[1:34:20] world. And she stayed that way until she
[1:34:24] got out of the will of God. What did he
[1:34:26] do with America? He made her the
[1:34:29] mightiest nation in the world
[1:34:31] until she's getting out of the will of
[1:34:33] God.
[1:34:35] Parallel one to another. Exactly.
[1:34:38] When Israel came over in the land,
[1:34:42] they were a a great people because they
[1:34:45] had great leadership.
[1:34:49] They had god-fearing men over them
[1:34:54] such as David,
[1:34:56] King Solomon.
[1:34:59] All the world feared them.
[1:35:02] And they enjoyed that privilege of no
[1:35:06] wars, no troubles, and living under the
[1:35:09] power of God until people from all over
[1:35:12] the known world come to sin.
[1:35:16] God gave him a gift of discernment.
[1:35:19] is up on Solomon
[1:35:22] and the queen of the south from Queen of
[1:35:25] Sheba came all the way across the Sahara
[1:35:27] desert, taking her three months
[1:35:29] just to hear the wisdom of Solomon.
[1:35:33] And when she saw that Solomon could
[1:35:35] discern spirit and made known to her the
[1:35:39] secrets in her heart, she said, "All I
[1:35:42] heard about you was right and more
[1:35:43] besides."
[1:35:45] She was convinced that that was God
[1:35:50] and America
[1:35:52] upon the basis of our forefathers who
[1:35:56] came here for religious freedom.
[1:36:02] We had godly man in them days as
[1:36:04] leaders.
[1:36:06] George Washington, Abraham Lincoln,
[1:36:10] man of renowned character,
[1:36:13] man of God.
[1:36:16] America was America in those days.
[1:36:21] George Larson here at Valley Forge
[1:36:24] before he crossed the Delaware praying
[1:36:27] all night
[1:36:30] until he was wet come to his waist
[1:36:32] kneeling in snow
[1:36:35] and the next morning when the Americans
[1:36:38] started to crosses only about 20% of
[1:36:41] them had shoes to wear the American army
[1:36:46] but they had a principle
[1:36:49] they had something that they had to
[1:36:51] fight for.
[1:36:53] They didn't care what comer went. The
[1:36:56] farmers come in, stopped his pine, took
[1:36:59] out his ox and got his life and went to
[1:37:01] fight for what he know was freedom.
[1:37:06] The next day, I think it was four or
[1:37:08] five bullet holes musket bullets went
[1:37:12] through his coat and hat and never
[1:37:13] touched him.
[1:37:16] man of God who founded this nation.
[1:37:19] Great man.
[1:37:22] No wonder they wrote long. May our lands
[1:37:25] be bright with freedoms holy light.
[1:37:28] Protect us by thy might. Great God our
[1:37:31] king.
[1:37:35] Some time ago I talked to an old man
[1:37:37] down at Cardon, Indiana.
[1:37:40] He told me about when the capital was in
[1:37:42] Cardon and how he said how he went in
[1:37:43] the ox cart down to hear
[1:37:47] the governor speak and he and the
[1:37:49] governor's only two had had two pieces
[1:37:51] of suit on said that he raised the sheep
[1:37:53] and sheared them and washed the wool.
[1:37:55] His sister spun it and made him a coat
[1:37:57] to go with his trousers. And the old
[1:37:59] fell sitting there of about 85 or 90
[1:38:02] years old
[1:38:04] pulled his beard like that and he said,
[1:38:06] "Billy, that's when Americ was
[1:38:08] American."
[1:38:12] I looked at the old fell and I thought,
[1:38:14] "Boy, you a lot of these young ones
[1:38:16] wouldn't believe it, but you're telling
[1:38:18] the truth.
[1:38:21] What happened to Israel after all this
[1:38:23] godly background?"
[1:38:27] They begin to get cared for you.
[1:38:31] They begin to get to a place where they
[1:38:34] well they didn't care what went on. They
[1:38:37] begin to go get slack in their worship
[1:38:40] to God. Although they held a farm of
[1:38:43] religion
[1:38:45] just like we had.
[1:38:48] They had a farm of godliness, but they
[1:38:52] begin to get free with their people and
[1:38:54] and they begin to bring in different
[1:38:57] heresies in their church.
[1:39:00] The worship of Balum begin to creep in
[1:39:04] and Israel become pleasure mad, drunk,
[1:39:10] and such things as that. and finally
[1:39:14] brought in a leader
[1:39:17] who didn't know God,
[1:39:20] Ahab,
[1:39:22] who succeeded his father. And his father
[1:39:26] was an ungodly man,
[1:39:30] rich man, but an ungodly man.
[1:39:35] And he done all the sins more than
[1:39:38] anyone before him ever done.
[1:39:41] But Israel in their drunken stuper,
[1:39:47] they put a man in like that
[1:39:52] and put him on the throne
[1:39:54] to be a ruler over them.
[1:39:59] They thought it was all right,
[1:40:01] just like a lot of Americans today.
[1:40:05] He's a good politician, so what
[1:40:07] difference does it make?
[1:40:10] It won't make any difference because
[1:40:12] he's a good politician.
[1:40:15] A lot of Americans, too many of them,
[1:40:19] has sold out their birthight
[1:40:24] as an American
[1:40:28] and say, "What difference does it make
[1:40:29] as long as you can get a few extra
[1:40:31] dollars from the government and live?"
[1:40:32] They sold out to the belly
[1:40:36] and to the lust and crave of a sinful
[1:40:40] world and forgot the very thing that we
[1:40:42] landed on the rock for.
[1:40:47] They forgot our heritage
[1:40:52] and went and sold out to the pleasure
[1:40:55] mad crowd
[1:40:58] as it was in the days of Israel. So has
[1:41:00] it been. America's took that same old
[1:41:04] right down the same path.
[1:41:08] Pleasure.
[1:41:10] After a while, the government endorsed
[1:41:12] sin. Just as long as you had a
[1:41:14] synagogue, what difference did it make?
[1:41:17] That's exactly what America know.
[1:41:20] And we begin to organize ourselves
[1:41:22] together and make little groups and more
[1:41:25] sinful, more sinful, more sinful. we to
[1:41:28] stay with the real principles that we
[1:41:30] landed here for.
[1:41:32] Sin begin to creep into the churches
[1:41:34] just like it did then.
[1:41:36] Women begin cutting off their hair,
[1:41:38] wearing immoral clothes, cutting them
[1:41:40] off each year, and man began doing this
[1:41:43] that and the other and playing cards and
[1:41:45] making bunk old games in the church.
[1:41:47] just as whirly as they was.
[1:41:50] Pleasure mad
[1:41:52] drunken stoopers
[1:41:55] ministers graduating from the seminary
[1:41:58] and the bishop saying preach boys
[1:42:00] whatever you wish to. As far as I am
[1:42:03] concerned the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:42:05] dried up 1900 years ago until the church
[1:42:08] got to nothing but an organization like
[1:42:11] a lodge.
[1:42:15] May you never forget this afternoon.
[1:42:20] Become like a lodge. Worlds begin to
[1:42:22] creep in.
[1:42:24] Ministers begin to compromise just like
[1:42:26] they did in the days of Ahab.
[1:42:31] Sinful,
[1:42:33] rotten to the core.
[1:42:36] And on and on it went
[1:42:41] just as hard as it could go. Although
[1:42:44] God sent them prophet after prophet and
[1:42:48] with tender mercies he begged to the
[1:42:51] people and they turned their back on it.
[1:42:55] They wanted their way. They were
[1:42:57] Israelites. They were free. They were a
[1:43:00] great nation. Their forefathers did so
[1:43:02] and so. David and Solomon. They could do
[1:43:04] what they wanted to. Just the same thing
[1:43:07] that we based oursel on.
[1:43:11] Exactly.
[1:43:15] what Washington our forefathers and what
[1:43:17] they stood for. But brother, we are a
[1:43:19] million miles from those things.
[1:43:23] Our churches are a million miles, the
[1:43:26] old the Methodist church today to what
[1:43:28] the Methodist church used to be.
[1:43:31] What the Pentecostal is today and what
[1:43:33] it used to be. What the Baptist is today
[1:43:36] to what it used to be.
[1:43:39] We had time to go back and talk of John
[1:43:42] Smith and many of those early reformers.
[1:43:46] John Smith said before he died said the
[1:43:49] horrible thing is that the Methodist
[1:43:50] women are beginning to wear gold rings
[1:43:52] on their fingers.
[1:43:54] Methodist what would he say today to sin
[1:43:57] with their hair cut off and paint all
[1:43:59] over their face wearing shorts?
[1:44:01] [Music]
[1:44:02] It's because of sin.
[1:44:07] What's God done in America?
[1:44:09] Sent revival after revival. Revival
[1:44:12] after revival.
[1:44:14] Ministers has preached the word. Tried
[1:44:17] to call people back to God. And what did
[1:44:20] they do? The same thing Israel done.
[1:44:23] Spirit,
[1:44:25] made fun of them, call them holy rulers,
[1:44:29] throw them in jail.
[1:44:32] If one of my sisters and one of my
[1:44:35] brothers out of this church today would
[1:44:37] have stood in that hotel last night and
[1:44:39] raised up their hands and praised God
[1:44:40] and shot out of that room, they'd be in
[1:44:42] jail at a
[1:44:45] drunken, stupid bunch of idiotic unholy
[1:44:49] rollers can stand up there and scream
[1:44:51] all night and drunk and cuss and grab
[1:44:54] their clothes off their women and carry
[1:44:55] on and fall on the floor and scream all
[1:44:57] night long and even they can't say a
[1:45:00] word.
[1:45:02] No wonder we are doomed under the hand
[1:45:04] of God.
[1:45:05] [Music]
[1:45:09] Notice
[1:45:12] on and on God set ministers perform
[1:45:15] signs and wonders proving his word and
[1:45:19] the most of the thing.
[1:45:23] A lot of modernistic
[1:45:26] clergymen
[1:45:28] turned it down and made fun of every
[1:45:30] revival
[1:45:32] such as so-called church of Christ and
[1:45:34] their days of miracles has passed trying
[1:45:37] their best to shut it off from that
[1:45:39] little remnant of God
[1:45:42] as it was in Israel. So is it today?
[1:45:45] Many times God has to take his people
[1:45:47] out of them organizations and
[1:45:48] denominations, take them out in the
[1:45:50] wilderness alone to talk to them.
[1:45:52] [Music]
[1:45:53] He's going to have a rim. They don't
[1:45:55] worry about that.
[1:45:58] He did, Daniel will. Now
[1:46:01] on and on they went through sin
[1:46:05] waiting through things while their
[1:46:07] leadership. There's nothing to stop it.
[1:46:11] Well, honest, I know many nations that
[1:46:15] if they catch the people on the street
[1:46:16] dressed like we do here in America, they
[1:46:18] put them in jail.
[1:46:20] When I went to St. Angelo in Rome. Now
[1:46:23] think of it as low as that is. They had
[1:46:25] a sign up there by St. Angelo Catacon to
[1:46:28] the American women. Please put on
[1:46:30] clothes and honor the dead.
[1:46:35] If there's anything that makes you sick
[1:46:36] is to see a bunch of so-called Americans
[1:46:39] come in.
[1:46:42] I was sitting down at Luzon.
[1:46:45] We were enjoying some steak one day.
[1:46:47] brother argued right now. Next day we
[1:46:49] went back cuz it's good eating. I could
[1:46:51] get some water there. They wouldn't
[1:46:52] serve nothing but wine. I get water. I
[1:46:56] had to pack me a jug of water under my
[1:46:58] own arm all the time cuz they wouldn't
[1:47:00] serve you water at the table.
[1:47:03] Then I went in there and everything was
[1:47:04] good. The Miss America come in with a
[1:47:07] little dirty snotty nose poodle dog with
[1:47:09] enough 10 cents to wear jewel on like
[1:47:11] that and a cigarette way out the end
[1:47:13] like this. sat down there putting on
[1:47:15] something that she wasn't
[1:47:18] and set that poodle on the table.
[1:47:24] Dirty filthy thing is a dog is the worst
[1:47:26] thing that God speaks of. Even the tile
[1:47:29] off of them can't even be paid in the
[1:47:30] house of God. It's like the wh of a
[1:47:33] the Bible said.
[1:47:35] And yet there you are.
[1:47:39] They'll practice birth control
[1:47:42] and pay $1,000 early for a little old
[1:47:44] dog and lead her around and give her a
[1:47:46] child's love so she can run out all
[1:47:48] night long
[1:47:50] and a practice birth control.
[1:47:53] What's waiting chaos?
[1:47:58] I may never hear my voice again,
[1:48:01] but I want you to remember this. We're
[1:48:05] at the end.
[1:48:09] There we find what taken place.
[1:48:12] What did finally the great hour come
[1:48:20] Ahab
[1:48:22] was elected.
[1:48:25] And when he did, he married Jezebel,
[1:48:30] that rotten old woman
[1:48:34] who led all of Israel to idolatry.
[1:48:39] And as
[1:48:42] Israel did that, why did it? They must
[1:48:45] have been in a backsliding condition to
[1:48:48] ever let a thing like that happen to
[1:48:49] their nation.
[1:48:51] The laws are made by the people for the
[1:48:54] people.
[1:48:57] And we've done the same thing.
[1:49:02] There was a time when America wouldn't
[1:49:04] have
[1:49:06] they know better than to let the old
[1:49:08] prostitute
[1:49:10] old harlot that dumped the blood of the
[1:49:13] martyrs, killed them. And the reason
[1:49:15] they fled here for freedom,
[1:49:18] they wouldn't have put up with nothing
[1:49:19] like that.
[1:49:21] It shows we're in a backsliding
[1:49:23] condition. A whole nation
[1:49:27] to elect such as that.
[1:49:30] Oh, of course. Now, some of you good
[1:49:32] squareback Democrats will think this
[1:49:34] that, oh, well, he'll make a good
[1:49:36] political head. That might sound all
[1:49:38] right to reason to the carnal mind, but
[1:49:40] to the word of God in the spiritual
[1:49:42] mind, it don't make sense.
[1:49:45] Apparently, it does.
[1:49:47] few extra dollars out and some taxes or
[1:49:50] something like this cut
[1:49:52] and we are having a hard time are
[1:49:56] missionaries in the field today because
[1:49:58] now we are considered a Catholic nation.
[1:50:02] Well, sure Russia's considered communist
[1:50:04] because they got a communistic leader.
[1:50:07] Red China's considered communist because
[1:50:09] it's got a communistic leader. We're
[1:50:11] considered Catholic because that we have
[1:50:13] a Catholic leader.
[1:50:17] Oh, when Ahab was on the throne, you say
[1:50:19] he's on the throne. That's right. But
[1:50:22] Jezebel was the head behind that throne.
[1:50:26] She was the one that done the leading.
[1:50:30] Look how she took the very laws of the
[1:50:32] land and twisted them around.
[1:50:37] And for her own gain and for greed
[1:50:41] and made Ahab do it because she was
[1:50:43] married to him. Amen. That's with our
[1:50:47] leader today.
[1:50:49] I say he isn't a nice man, but look
[1:50:51] what's behind him. The harlot. The very
[1:50:55] thing that we run here to be America for
[1:50:58] the very principles that America's built
[1:51:00] up on.
[1:51:03] We by our own free choosing a thing like
[1:51:06] that.
[1:51:10] Now you see why my voice is going to be
[1:51:11] stopped pretty soon.
[1:51:13] Somebody's going to know.
[1:51:17] Yes. Why? Revelations 2:20.
[1:51:23] She called herself a prophetus.
[1:51:26] You just watch the wave of sin happen.
[1:51:28] Now you watch core go plum to the core.
[1:51:33] You watch modernistic watch ungodly
[1:51:36] things happen in the churches and
[1:51:38] finally there'll come a persecution.
[1:51:41] The Bible says so. Thus saith the Lord.
[1:51:45] Certainly there will be. Then what's
[1:51:48] going to happen?
[1:51:50] Just like it did then. So will it be
[1:51:53] now? She was the power behind it. She
[1:51:56] was the one who controlled it. Read the
[1:51:59] um I believe it's the seven about the
[1:52:02] 17th or 18th chapter along in there.
[1:52:04] You'll find what Jezebel did. how she
[1:52:07] took Ahab and he couldn't say nothing
[1:52:09] about it because it was his wife.
[1:52:14] Look what the nation was built upon.
[1:52:16] Then a backsliden Israelite
[1:52:20] with a pagan wife behind him who was a
[1:52:23] worshshiper of Balum. And what did she
[1:52:25] do? She finally made everything so
[1:52:27] modernistic and so nice and the people
[1:52:29] had it so easy until the whole church
[1:52:32] fell for it. Preachers and all.
[1:52:35] Did Elijah say, "Lord, I'm the only ones
[1:52:37] left."
[1:52:40] And as it was then, it parallels today.
[1:52:44] All of us afraid to say anything.
[1:52:49] Is it just like the same thing today?
[1:52:52] They were afraid to say something.
[1:52:55] So we find out they were just loose
[1:52:57] halfhazard drunk carrying on pleasure
[1:53:01] mad everything else
[1:53:03] just as it is today.
[1:53:06] Jezebel twisting those scriptures. What
[1:53:08] did she laws as is Jezebel will twist?
[1:53:11] Remember Jezebel she calls herself a
[1:53:14] prophetus
[1:53:16] to subdue the people and she says that
[1:53:19] she is the only voice of God on the
[1:53:22] earth. Amen.
[1:53:25] She'll make the carnal mind believe that
[1:53:27] as sure as the world
[1:53:29] there'll come a worship of a woman in
[1:53:31] the United States and they'll be
[1:53:32] married.
[1:53:34] I've seen it 30 1931 seven things
[1:53:37] happened. I got it right on paper here
[1:53:40] with me. Wrote it in 1931. How that I
[1:53:44] said this President Franklin D.
[1:53:46] Roosevelt
[1:53:48] he will cause all the world help do it.
[1:53:51] send the world to war. Hadn't come to
[1:53:54] war yet during time of the depression. I
[1:53:57] said another thing
[1:54:00] and then my mother a squareback Democrat
[1:54:02] if she didn't look at me hard when I
[1:54:03] said that. I said I don't care if he's a
[1:54:05] Republican or if he was a socialist or
[1:54:08] whatever he is. This is thus sayaith the
[1:54:11] law.
[1:54:13] And I said doing this they're permitting
[1:54:15] women to vote.
[1:54:17] And when they do that, they've done one
[1:54:19] of the greatest disgraces this nation
[1:54:21] ever done. And I said, "Someday they'll
[1:54:24] pay for it." And they did it this last
[1:54:26] election. That's what elected women.
[1:54:30] And you precious colored people in the
[1:54:33] south, how you voted.
[1:54:35] You say, "You got a business saying that
[1:54:37] poor people." Oh yes, I have. It's the
[1:54:38] word of God.
[1:54:40] And the stain of of Abraham Lincoln, the
[1:54:44] one that freed you laying counter in
[1:54:47] that museum on a woman's dress and you
[1:54:49] sell your birthight.
[1:54:55] You people for politics because you're
[1:54:57] just a good democrat voted for something
[1:54:59] like that and soldier birthrights of
[1:55:01] Americanism and Christianity.
[1:55:04] Now give it over to the prostitute that
[1:55:06] run us in this nation or made us what we
[1:55:08] were.
[1:55:09] H see how she's been creeping in real
[1:55:13] easy until now she's on the throne.
[1:55:16] Sure. The White House throne. Watch
[1:55:20] already. Did you see the other day about
[1:55:21] Catholic schools and Protestant schools?
[1:55:23] Support the Catholic school but not the
[1:55:25] Protestant. Oh brother,
[1:55:28] you watch for a wave of stuff coming
[1:55:31] forth. Now
[1:55:33] notice and as they did it, look what
[1:55:36] taking place.
[1:55:38] all of this sin heaping in got to a
[1:55:42] place and got the nation in that kind of
[1:55:43] a staggering place. A few years ago when
[1:55:46] they had the Pentecostals first broke
[1:55:48] out, it saved the nation a few years ago
[1:55:50] when Al Smith was going to run.
[1:55:53] America know better then. But Pentecost
[1:55:56] got so worldly it went right on in and
[1:55:58] sold their rights as a Christian to
[1:56:00] politics.
[1:56:02] And it's politics ahead of the Bible.
[1:56:06] Oh my.
[1:56:10] Now just a minute and watch to how this
[1:56:12] comes out.
[1:56:14] Now we find out what they did and the
[1:56:16] things they did. We see it paralleling
[1:56:18] here just exactly.
[1:56:20] Sin on every hand. Jezebel come in. She
[1:56:23] bewitched all the people. And notice
[1:56:25] finally she be to build big shrines to
[1:56:28] Balum. Is that right? and the Balum
[1:56:32] priest flocked from everywhere to get
[1:56:34] into that place and begin to contaminate
[1:56:36] the lands with Balum worship.
[1:56:40] Look how they've done. Look how they've
[1:56:41] weeded in just the things they've done.
[1:56:43] Look where they're at today. Look at
[1:56:45] Catholicism. Swallowing up, swallowing
[1:56:47] up, swallowing up. Marrying into
[1:56:49] breaking this exactly what Daniel said
[1:56:50] they'd do. Iron and clay wouldn't mix
[1:56:53] but mingling their seeds one with
[1:56:54] another. Breaking. Every Protestant girl
[1:56:57] mir Catholic boy has to raise her
[1:56:59] children Catholic. All like that
[1:57:00] marrying in a meeting like that until
[1:57:02] it's come to a place to the whole United
[1:57:04] States is all wormed over. What are we
[1:57:06] going to do as missionaries going out
[1:57:08] there to liberate in South America and
[1:57:10] all over the part of the world? Tommy
[1:57:11] Osman and them trying to get the people
[1:57:13] out of that paganism and they can point
[1:57:15] their finger right back that we elected
[1:57:16] our leader.
[1:57:21] What's what's going to happen to this
[1:57:22] world? It should shake every person in
[1:57:26] here.
[1:57:31] How are we going to answer? What's the
[1:57:32] missionary going to say when they say
[1:57:34] you come here to liberate us from this
[1:57:36] and your own people put the same thing
[1:57:37] in your office there on the throne?
[1:57:40] How are we going to look back in the
[1:57:43] pages of history? Turn back and see if
[1:57:44] it if it's absolutely almost
[1:57:46] unconstitutional for it to be.
[1:57:50] They wouldn't do it years ago. But see,
[1:57:52] we've sold out our Christian rights to
[1:57:54] politics and that's how the devil weave
[1:57:56] himself in.
[1:57:59] Ahab was nothing but a figurehead for
[1:58:01] Jezebel.
[1:58:03] That's all this will be. Just a
[1:58:05] figurehead.
[1:58:07] He won't do it himself, but that system
[1:58:10] behind him will guide into it. Exactly.
[1:58:14] Ronald,
[1:58:19] pitch your conscience to Christians.
[1:58:23] Wake yourself up.
[1:58:25] It's later than you think.
[1:58:28] the condition that we're in,
[1:58:31] condition that they were in, and how
[1:58:34] they let themselves get loose. How the
[1:58:36] great loving heart of God must have
[1:58:38] cried out and weeping as he seen his
[1:58:41] missionary people made him an example.
[1:58:44] All the nations coming everywhere
[1:58:45] because God had blessed them, seeing
[1:58:47] them in unity, spiritually serving God.
[1:58:51] And then to think that he he longed to
[1:58:54] see them come back to their first love
[1:58:56] and do what was right but continued that
[1:58:59] they went away and away and away to
[1:59:00] finally Jezebel come in. That's exactly
[1:59:03] what we done. Drifted from the
[1:59:06] principles of Christ went up God sent
[1:59:09] his ministers across the nation. They
[1:59:11] preached holiness pilgrim holiness.
[1:59:14] Nazarines Pentecostals get back to God.
[1:59:18] Get back to God. And the real oldtime
[1:59:22] established churches just laughed and
[1:59:24] made fun. A lot of them modernistic
[1:59:27] believers while they condemned
[1:59:29] everything that that man done and said
[1:59:31] it was of the devil.
[1:59:34] What did it do? And the church begin to
[1:59:36] listen to the majority begin to listen.
[1:59:40] First thing you know, if the Catholic
[1:59:41] woman could wear these kind of things,
[1:59:43] the Protestant could do. If the Catholic
[1:59:45] Church could do this, the Protestant
[1:59:46] could too. Then if the Methodist school,
[1:59:48] what about the Baptist? Then if the
[1:59:49] Baptist good, what about the
[1:59:50] Pentecostals? See, that's what man-made
[1:59:53] systems bring you into.
[1:59:57] [Music]
[1:59:59] That's true.
[2:00:01] That's the reason I'm against it.
[2:00:03] Because God's word is against it.
[2:00:08] Man-made systems.
[2:00:11] [Music]
[2:00:13] God's against it. His word's against it.
[2:00:15] His prophets will be against it. His
[2:00:17] true servants will be against it. All
[2:00:20] that's born of the spirit of God will be
[2:00:22] against it.
[2:00:26] Look how Israel got how they floated
[2:00:28] with the tide till finally Jezebel come.
[2:00:31] Look how America got and floated with
[2:00:33] the worldly tide until finally Jezebel
[2:00:36] took the throne.
[2:00:38] That's right. Now, Jezebel actually
[2:00:40] wasn't on the throne of Egypt or throne
[2:00:42] of Israel, but she was the main head
[2:00:45] behind the throne. And the Catholic
[2:00:49] hierarchy is not on the throne of the
[2:00:50] United States, but she's the system
[2:00:52] behind it because he's married to her.
[2:00:55] And the Bible said in this country, they
[2:00:57] make an image like unto the beast.
[2:01:01] Brother, sister, what's the matter with
[2:01:04] Well, I I know what it is. The Bible
[2:01:05] said to get this lady of an age, and
[2:01:07] there's where we're at.
[2:01:09] You might hate me now, but one day you
[2:01:12] won't when you find out what's true. You
[2:01:14] may disagree and get up and stomp out of
[2:01:16] the belly. That just shows your
[2:01:18] literacy. But someday you'll realize
[2:01:23] someday you'll know that it's the truth.
[2:01:26] I speak it in the name of the Lord.
[2:01:29] Put myself up for a target
[2:01:32] which finally will drive me to the
[2:01:34] grave.
[2:01:37] I'm going to be a witness till I die.
[2:01:40] God will help me. That's right.
[2:01:43] Here we are in this condition we are
[2:01:46] today.
[2:01:48] All of it going on like that in Israel.
[2:01:51] How Ahab did a figurehead for Jezebel
[2:01:54] because he he was married to her.
[2:01:57] America, our leader, how did our you
[2:01:59] know our leader was a rich man? How many
[2:02:01] know that? A multi-millionaire.
[2:02:04] Somebody told me in a magazine or some
[2:02:06] radio or television or something, Jack
[2:02:08] Benny or somebody made a Ernie Ford I
[2:02:11] believe or somebody said that his father
[2:02:14] helped him get two states that he didn't
[2:02:16] own
[2:02:18] just about owns the rest of it. How did
[2:02:20] he get it?
[2:02:22] How did that money come through the
[2:02:25] whiskey traffic and liquor?
[2:02:28] That's reason he dropped the taxes on
[2:02:29] whiskey and stuff. That's what made him
[2:02:32] a rich man.
[2:02:34] The very thing that damned our nation,
[2:02:37] the very thing that corrupted the minds
[2:02:39] of our people, the thing that sent our
[2:02:41] boys to be drunkards and our girls to be
[2:02:43] prostitutes.
[2:02:45] The money off of that made him a rich
[2:02:46] man. The same thing that old Jezebel
[2:02:49] system. The same thing that persecuted
[2:02:53] our people. The same thing that drug
[2:02:55] them out in Romanism and burn them and
[2:02:57] pulled them apart and done everything to
[2:02:59] them. The same blood of the martyrs, the
[2:03:01] Bible said, is in her.
[2:03:05] There they are married together.
[2:03:09] And we Americans stagger right on.
[2:03:12] Oh well, we got a few extra dollars and
[2:03:14] we're having a good time. Better off
[2:03:16] than all the rest of the nations. But
[2:03:17] brother, you just wait a minute. Let's
[2:03:19] take it letter by letter now for the
[2:03:21] next few minutes. See what happened.
[2:03:24] The preachers got right along this nut
[2:03:26] down with them. Went right on with them.
[2:03:27] All the system, the whole Israelite
[2:03:30] system went right on with Jezebel.
[2:03:32] They had a farm. Yes. And don't the
[2:03:35] Bible tell us that in this last days
[2:03:37] we'll have a form of godliness?
[2:03:41] All the prophecies are fulfilled,
[2:03:42] brother.
[2:03:44] We're at the end. Nationally, we are at
[2:03:47] the end. Spiritually, we are at the end.
[2:03:50] Every system it's at its end. Next thing
[2:03:53] is the coming of the Lord and the
[2:03:56] translation of the church.
[2:03:59] God sent every sign, wonder, done
[2:04:01] everything he could do, kind of all the
[2:04:03] people. He constantly they moved right
[2:04:05] on in. Look at this town here. Look at
[2:04:07] this country around here
[2:04:10] with tens of hundreds and hundreds of
[2:04:12] Pentecostal people.
[2:04:15] And because of standing on truth, where
[2:04:18] are they at this afternoon?
[2:04:20] Because someone told them not to
[2:04:21] cooperate with the need. You poor
[2:04:25] deliberate
[2:04:27] God be merciful to you is the only thing
[2:04:28] I can say.
[2:04:32] When you Christians got no more backbone
[2:04:34] than that,
[2:04:37] you got a wishbone instead of a
[2:04:38] backbone.
[2:04:40] Right?
[2:04:43] What we need is preach a gospel with
[2:04:45] teeth in it. That'll chop the thing to
[2:04:47] pieces.
[2:04:51] We're just like the rest of them. Then
[2:04:53] you wonder why we holler about it. Then
[2:04:56] you see you get the cold shoulder. I
[2:04:57] expect it. I have to.
[2:05:00] All this went on in Israel. Finally
[2:05:04] one day come stomping out of the
[2:05:05] wilderness.
[2:05:07] Cover old hairy looking fella.
[2:05:10] Elijah the Tishbite.
[2:05:13] He never come up out of any
[2:05:14] organizations. He come out of the
[2:05:15] wilderness.
[2:05:18] He had nothing to do with him. He was a
[2:05:20] prophet of the Lord,
[2:05:22] brother. He shot that Jezebel kingdom
[2:05:25] for everything within.
[2:05:30] They hated him. He had no cooperation.
[2:05:33] I'll guarantee you that. The Bible says
[2:05:36] not.
[2:05:38] Certainly. He even made them painted
[2:05:42] face Jezebels burn up. I imagine
[2:05:45] he didn't laid the axe to the root of
[2:05:47] the tree like John did. The chips fall
[2:05:50] wherever they wish. But he laid her in
[2:05:52] there. Amen. He shook the nation,
[2:05:57] showing that they were wrong in trying
[2:05:58] to call them back to a true living God
[2:06:01] and back to his word instead of a
[2:06:03] Jezebel worship.
[2:06:11] What did they do? Did they receive him?
[2:06:12] They hated him.
[2:06:16] But his word went forth just the same
[2:06:18] because he had thus sayeth the Lord.
[2:06:22] God worked with him and showed he was
[2:06:23] anointed prophet by the things that he
[2:06:25] said coming to pass and all that he did
[2:06:27] prove that he was God's prophet
[2:06:30] but yet they would not believe it
[2:06:33] because he tore up their playhouses.
[2:06:37] He told them that they were wrong. Ahab
[2:06:40] was arrested about
[2:06:43] true and you notice they didn't believe
[2:06:46] him
[2:06:48] but he preached it just the same. None
[2:06:50] of the preachers agreed with him. Amen.
[2:06:53] He said, "I'm the only ones left, Lord.
[2:06:55] Look at them. They won't eat one. Nobody
[2:06:56] will cooperate." But he had a mission to
[2:06:59] do and he did it. He had the word of the
[2:07:02] Lord. Thus sayeth the Lord.
[2:07:06] And he attacked in the nation. He
[2:07:07] attacked the church. He attacked
[2:07:09] everything there was. But God was with
[2:07:11] him.
[2:07:13] We are promised in the last days that he
[2:07:15] will return to this country, too.
[2:07:18] [Music]
[2:07:19] I know Jesus when Matthew 17 when they
[2:07:22] asked him why scribes say Elias watch
[2:07:24] what he said Elias truly must first come
[2:07:28] pack in the future tense
[2:07:32] but then he gives John as an example
[2:07:34] John wasn't Malachi 4 John was Malachi 3
[2:07:36] behold I send a messenger before me to
[2:07:40] prepare the way Malachi 4 he said before
[2:07:44] the great and terrible day of the Lord
[2:07:45] shall come when all the earth will be
[2:07:47] burned like stubble before that day.
[2:07:49] I'll send Elijah
[2:07:52] and it wasn't John
[2:07:54] because the Lord never burnt the earth
[2:07:57] when John came. And if you notice in the
[2:07:59] in the last chapter of the last verse,
[2:08:02] he said, "And he," what's he talking
[2:08:05] shall turn the hearts of the fathers to
[2:08:08] the children, and the hearts of the
[2:08:12] children to the fathers. Now watch the
[2:08:14] first John came, the first Elijah, what
[2:08:17] did he do? He came and brought a message
[2:08:20] and turned the old Orthodox hard hearts
[2:08:23] to the faith of the young church, the
[2:08:25] children. But when the next Elijah comes
[2:08:28] in the end time, he's to go back and
[2:08:30] take the the father's hearts,
[2:08:33] the children's hearts rather, and turn
[2:08:35] them back to the faith of the
[2:08:36] Pentecostal fathers.
[2:08:39] See the difference? He'll not be one of
[2:08:42] these your so-called we have today.
[2:08:44] He'll go right back to Acts two and
[2:08:46] start right from there. He'll preach the
[2:08:48] unadulterated gospel. Just say the same
[2:08:51] things that Peter did on the day of
[2:08:52] Pentecost.
[2:08:54] Cause what he said on Pentecost is
[2:08:55] vindicated the rest of scriptures
[2:08:56] through. You'll not twist around with
[2:08:59] some organization when Elijah comes.
[2:09:01] You'll hate women like Elijah did just
[2:09:04] like or bad women just like John did.
[2:09:07] You'll be a wilderness lover just like
[2:09:09] they were. He'll not spare. We're
[2:09:11] looking for him to come. He'll come. God
[2:09:13] said he will. And he'll be here.
[2:09:28] Amen.
[2:09:31] Hard to stop just in the middle of
[2:09:33] something like that.
[2:09:36] you just feel,
[2:09:38] Lord, I want to I want to be right. I
[2:09:40] want to live the way that he wants me to
[2:09:42] live. And it's don't want to get to
[2:09:44] where we just look and say, "Oh, he was
[2:09:46] talking about the Methodists. He was
[2:09:48] talking about the Baptists. He was
[2:09:49] talking about the Catholics." But you
[2:09:52] look at what's happened since that
[2:09:53] message was preached. And we can look
[2:09:55] among our own ranks and see the same
[2:09:57] things going on.
[2:10:00] So Lord, help us. Help us to help us to
[2:10:03] be right.
[2:10:05] Help us to be more like you. I think
[2:10:07] that's each of our desire.
[2:10:10] I want to love
[2:10:14] love till there is just
[2:10:19] no more love.
[2:10:22] I could never
[2:10:25] ever out love
[2:10:28] the Lord.
[2:10:32] I'm going to live
[2:10:35] the way
[2:10:39] he wants me
[2:10:42] to live.
[2:10:44] I'm going to give
[2:10:48] until there's just no more
[2:10:53] to give.
[2:10:55] I'm going to love
[2:11:00] till there's just
[2:11:04] no more love.
[2:11:06] I could never
[2:11:10] ever out love
[2:11:13] the Lord.
[2:11:18] And he's my Lord.
[2:11:25] There is
[2:11:27] no other
[2:11:30] one
[2:11:33] who can calm the storms
[2:11:38] of life
[2:11:41] like my Lord.
[2:11:47] He gives rest
[2:11:51] to the weary.
[2:11:55] Gives new life
[2:11:58] to the hopeless.
[2:12:01] There's no doubt
[2:12:06] about it. He's my Lord.
[2:12:15] Yes, he's my Lord.
[2:12:22] There is
[2:12:24] no other
[2:12:26] one
[2:12:29] who can calm the storms of life
[2:12:37] like my Lord.
[2:12:40] Lord.
[2:12:43] He gives rest
[2:12:47] to the weary,
[2:12:50] gives new life
[2:12:54] to the hopeless.
[2:12:57] There's no doubt
[2:13:02] about it. is my Lord
[2:13:11] and I feel like going
[2:13:16] on.
[2:13:20] Yes, I feel like going
[2:13:25] on.
[2:13:29] Though trials
[2:13:31] may come
[2:13:33] on every
[2:13:36] hand,
[2:13:38] I feel like going
[2:13:42] on. I feel like pressing on.
[2:13:46] I feel like pressing
[2:13:51] on.
[2:13:54] Yes, I feel like pressing
[2:13:59] on
[2:14:03] though trials
[2:14:05] may come
[2:14:07] from every
[2:14:10] hand.
[2:14:12] I feel like pressing
[2:14:16] on
[2:14:18] one more time.
[2:14:20] I feel like pressing
[2:14:25] on.
[2:14:28] Yes, I feel like pressing
[2:14:33] on.
[2:14:37] Oh trles
[2:14:40] come
[2:14:41] from every
[2:14:44] hand
[2:14:46] I feel thy pressing
[2:14:51] on
[2:14:52] let's all stand together this morning.
[2:14:56] Oh Lord, prepare
[2:15:00] me
[2:15:02] to be a sanctuary,
[2:15:11] pure and holy,
[2:15:18] tried and true
[2:15:25] With thanksgiving,
[2:15:29] [Music]
[2:15:31] I will be a living
[2:15:39] sanctuary
[2:15:46] for you.
[2:15:49] Ask him again.
[2:15:52] Lord prepare
[2:15:55] me
[2:15:58] to be a sanctuary,
[2:16:02] [Music]
[2:16:06] pure and holy,
[2:16:13] tried and true
[2:16:20] with thanksgiving. living.
[2:16:26] I will be a living
[2:16:29] [Music]
[2:16:33] sanctuary
[2:16:37] [Music]
[2:16:40] for
[2:16:42] you.
[2:16:45] [Music]
[2:16:48] Purify
[2:16:51] my heart.
[2:16:54] Let me be as gold
[2:16:59] and preious
[2:17:01] silver,
[2:17:03] purify
[2:17:06] my heart.
[2:17:09] Let me be as gold
[2:17:15] pure
[2:17:17] gold

[2:17:27] my heart's one desire
[2:17:34] is to be
[2:17:39] Holy
[2:17:42] set upon
[2:17:45] for you.
[2:17:48] Lord, I choose to be
[2:17:54] holy,
[2:17:58] set upon
[2:18:00] for you, my master,
[2:18:05] ready to do
[2:18:08] your will. Let's sing the second verse.
[2:18:12] Lord purify
[2:18:16] my heart.
[2:18:19] Cleanse me from within
[2:18:24] and make me holy.
[2:18:28] Norri
[2:18:31] my heart.
[2:18:34] Cleanse me from my sin.
[2:18:40] Deep within
[2:18:44] reach
[2:18:46] fighters fire.
[2:18:52] My heart's one desire
[2:18:58] is to be
[2:19:03] holy.
[2:19:07] Set upon
[2:19:10] for you,
[2:19:12] Lord. I choose to be
[2:19:19] holy.
[2:19:23] set upon
[2:19:25] for you,
[2:19:27] my master,
[2:19:30] ready to do
[2:19:33] your will.
[2:19:39] Brother Trevor, would you come and
[2:19:40] dismiss us with a word of prayer?
[2:19:44] [Music]
[2:19:51] Let's all bow our heads.
[2:19:57] Dear heavenly father, Lord, we thank you
[2:20:00] so much, Lord, for this service this
[2:20:01] morning.
[2:20:04] Lord, we count it a privilege, Lord, to
[2:20:08] be one of the few that gets to come
[2:20:11] together, Lord, in this organization,
[2:20:14] this congregation, this family here,
[2:20:16] Lord, to just worship you, Lord, and to
[2:20:19] love you, Lord, and to show you our
[2:20:21] appreciation,
[2:20:23] Lord. The greatest honor that we could
[2:20:25] have, Lord, is to know that Lord, you
[2:20:28] came down here, Lord, and you just
[2:20:30] consumed our sacrifice we gave to you,
[2:20:32] Lord. Lord, we just ask that you would
[2:20:35] just go with each and everyone here,
[2:20:37] Lord, and just bless and touch each one,
[2:20:41] Lord, that is here, Lord. Those who are
[2:20:43] streaming, those who couldn't make it,
[2:20:45] Lord. And just help us this evening,
[2:20:48] Lord, with the continuing of the word
[2:20:50] that you have for us, Lord. We love you
[2:20:52] so much and we give this prayer to you,
[2:20:55] Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:21:03] Amen.
[2:21:04] Amen. You're dismissed. And let's come
[2:21:07] back this evening expecting joy
[2:21:09] afternoon. Let's sing that chorus as we
[2:21:11] go. Since Jesus came into my heart,
[2:21:17] what a wonderful change in my life has
[2:21:21] been wrought. All since Jesus came into
[2:21:26] my heart,
[2:21:29] I have died in my soul for which long I
[2:21:34] had sought. Since Jesus came into my
[2:21:38] heart.
[2:21:40] [Music]
[2:21:41] Since Jesus came into my heart.
[2:21:47] Oh, since Jesus came into my heart.
[2:21:53] Oh, floods of joy for my soul. Like the
[2:21:57] sea billows roll
[2:22:01] since Jesus came into my heart.
[2:22:07] Well, I have ceased from my wonderings
[2:22:10] and going astray
[2:22:14] since Jesus came into my heart.
[2:22:19] And my sins which were many are now
[2:22:24] washed away. Since Jesus
[2:22:28] came into my heart.
[2:22:32] Since Jesus came into my heart.
[2:22:38] Oh, since Jesus came into my heart.
[2:22:44] Bloods of joy, oh my soul, like the sea
[2:22:49] billows roll
[2:22:52] since Jesus. The last verse. I'm
[2:22:55] possessed of a hope. Oh, I am possessed
[2:22:59] of a hope that is steadfast and sure.
[2:23:04] Since Jesus came into my heart
[2:23:10] and no dark clouds of down my pathway
[2:23:15] obscure since Jesus came into my heart.
[2:23:22] Oh, since Jesus came into my heart.
[2:23:28] Oh, since Jesus came into my heart.
[2:23:35] Floods of joy for my soul. Like the sea
[2:23:40] billows roll
[2:23:43] since Jesus came into my heart.

[2:24:16] Heat. Heat.

[2:25:00] Heat. Heat.
