It's good to see all of you tonight again. &gt;&gt; And that'll be all the music for tonight. Thank you very much. Beautiful. You know, the next thing on God's schedule is a resurrection. Don't believe what you see on the internet. They they're looking at some other Bible. But we have a destination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not just going around circles. And so tonight, we're going to speak on a subject, our journey, the hope of the resurrection. And Elijah says over here in the message u the token, God's big clock ticks perfect, not late, not fast, perfectly on time. &gt;&gt; You think things are out of kilter, you got to trust God. He knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; God's big clock ticks perfect. It won't be one minute fast or one minute behind. It will be just exactly on time, on schedule, and perfectly balanced &gt;&gt; every time. So, we'll just set this here. Maybe it'll stay there. No, but you know it's here. And so, we want to look at First John chapter 2 in your Bible. We're going to speak from Brother Brandham's Absolute tonight if it's okay with everybody. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; First John chapter 2, verse one. My little children, these things write I unto you that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the father, Jesus Christ the righteous. And he is the propitiation for our sins. And not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. Jesus came to die for all the world. &gt;&gt; Not just the Baptists, not just the Brandomites, no whole world. &gt;&gt; And one day every knee shall bow. Verse three. And hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments. Now look down at the bottom of the chapter, verse 28. And now little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming. If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him. you know on into chapter three. Behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God. Therefore the world uh knoweth us not because it knew him not. Beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be. But we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is. and every man that hath this hope in him purifith himself even as he is pure. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your mercy to us. We thank you, Lord, that you brought us away from the busy world into the house of prayer this evening. We just thank you that there's a group that believes all your word. We pray that you would bless each one. Lord, I don't know everybody's problem here, but I know you and I know that you sent me with these words. We pray that he'd be a blessing to everyone and everybody could take something home with him. Bless Pastor Paul where he is tonight. Protect him. Keep us Lord in the center of your hand. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated. All through scripture, we find in the year of or in the year that a certain king died and uh in the month and the year and sometimes very specific dates. And now that we have everything, you know, computerized and have everything, you know, at our fingertips, they have discovered the Bible is right. There's all kinds of scientific evidence, you know, and so on this earth, we live by the calendar and by the clock. It's ticking even as we speak. And if you behave will be up before midnight. But um everything that is, everything that has been, everything that will be, it's all governed by the word of God, by prophecy. God is in total control. &gt;&gt; Don't you think for a minute that God isn't aware? You see, with our God, there's no surprises. He knows exactly what's happening. He's watching every life. He's watching his seed, especially. So, I'm only here to remind you of what has been spoken. There's no shortcuts. There's no magic way to get to heaven. You must start at the foot of the cross. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, right here in this Bible is our road map, our book of directions. And God has sent us a vindicated prophet to make it clear to us, bring certain things to our remembrance because we had the Bible for 500 years, but certain things had to be made real for today. You see, so here we are in what is it? It's already September. Uh we can't go back the way it used to be. &gt;&gt; I'm all for our president. He's he's doing good, but all he's doing is resetting the thermostat a little bit. &gt;&gt; It's still going to burn. &gt;&gt; We're not going back. Damon and Andy are back to Andy Griffin. No, no, it's going this way, you know. And so, uh, we can't go to the sides. We got to go forward. So, the fact is that the clock keeps ticking, ticking, ticking, and everything we deal with is timesensitive. So, um, as the time ticks by, we really need to be making serious preparations for the catching away of the bride of Christ. Because the Bible says in Revelation 19:7, "His wife hath made herself ready." That doesn't mean she's sitting on the porch waiting for some. No, she's doing she's doing she's listening. She's getting ready. Okay. So, in the getting ready, now some of you don't know who I am, but that's not important. But you're going to hear some things that you've heard before because when you get to my age, it's okay to repeat yourself, you know. But listen, might be something you need. Excuse me. So, in getting ready, there's four things you're going to keep in mind and put in practice every day &gt;&gt; all the way from the youngest to a buddy here to all of us. Okay? One, you read at least one chapter out of your Bible every day. &gt;&gt; That's not hard to do. You got to make time for it. Read one chapter. You listen to at least 20 minutes of God's prophet. You read one page out of the church age book and you pray at all times. like when you're stuck in traffic, when things aren't going right, just settle down and pray. &gt;&gt; God answers prayer. Okay? So, that's the four items you must remember. Brother Brandham says, "Prayer changes things. Prayer changes death to life." We've seen it. Prayer changes sickness to health, changes sinners to saints. It's prayer. You might laugh too much. You might shout too much. You might eat too much, but you will never pray too much. So Paul says over in 1 Timothy, I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath or doubting. So we can never pray too much. Okay? You might do a lot of other things. And so as we implement these four steps in our daily routine, you'll have peace in your home guaranteed. &gt;&gt; And uh you'll stay in contact with your heavenly father &gt;&gt; and you'll be preparing for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. and you'd be a whole lot easier to preach to instead of coming here with all your stuff and fuzzes. No, leave all that out there. &gt;&gt; Come prayed up. You see, so today, every one of us is on a journey. Okay, where are we going? We're going to the gate of the resurrection. It's closer than it was last week. Okay, but there's many distractions along the way. It's like when you drive somewhere, there's all these signs. No, we got to get there, you see. And so, um, how do we remain focused and, uh, you know, on the goal and not wander off on the side roads? Well, because we have a we have a voice on the dash or on your phone. You know, that's called GPS, but that really means God's positioning system. &gt;&gt; God knows where you are. &gt;&gt; Yes. I &gt;&gt; mean, he can see us better than that girl on the on the phone. I mean, she can see through the dark and through the rain. That's fine. But God knows where you are every minute. See? And so it's a magnetic pole that pulls us towards the word of God. And that's why we have our hope in the resurrection. Now, brother Random says it's the cardinal resting place of the gospel. No matter what he did, if he did not raise again from the dead, then all of it was in vain. &gt;&gt; It proves to me that he was God. So you see, just with that one statement, I don't have any time to argue with some of my friends that Jesus wasn't God. Well, then what are you doing? you're wasting your time. You know, Jesus was God. And I think it's the great coronation of the full gospel is the resurrection and its divine promises. So to my opinion, the resurrection is the greatest of all the promises in the things in the scripture. &gt;&gt; And Paul says over here in First Corinthians, if in this life only we have hope in Christ, we're of all men most miserable because we're we're just we're going through blindly. No, we have directions. We have things that are coming to pass. God is in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Ramon had great admiration for Paul. If you if you read the Churches book, he was the first one. It set the norm for the rest of them. And um one of the key statements for today, yeah, September 25 is Galatians 1:8. Because Paul had been through this area and he had baptized some people and now he's coming back to visit and some legalists, some some wise guys had come in there and said, "Well, Paul's okay." But see, you got to do it this way. &gt;&gt; Paul said that is a perversion of the gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I come back next week or if you know, brother Poe or George or William Bremer, whoever comes, if an angel comes down and preaches anything different than what I've already given you by revelation, &gt;&gt; going to the hot place. &gt;&gt; That's simple. &gt;&gt; So, we're not playing games. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; So, there is a resurrection for those who have surrendered their entire life to Jesus Christ and can say amen to all the word, not just their favorite parts and and repeating what somebody said. No, it's got to be all the word. You see, anybody can read and repeat, but only a few can take it really serious. Okay? All others will continue to play church, and the day after the resurrection, guess what? This church will be full. All the churches will be full of people. Oh, wow. It was serious. Well, a little bit too late. &gt;&gt; So, let's take advantage of the time we have. Okay? And um so as believers in God's word, we come from a long line of travelers. Remember our title, our journey, the hope of the resurrection. And so we have the children of Israel, for example, that traveled for 40 years. They enjoyed many, many blessings of God, uh had daily provisions, healing, their shoes didn't wear out, all kinds of blessings. But their journey was characterized by unbelief because they they they enjoyed all that but they didn't take it serious. Um Abraham for example traveled about 500 miles from Haran down to Hebron and his trip was characterized by faith. He didn't know where he's going. Just following God, you know. And then we have Eleazar, his helper. He retraced those same 500 miles to go and find a bride for the master's son. He was accompanied by an angel and his journey was characterized by success. Then we have Mary and Joseph. They traveled about 90 miles from Nazareth down to Bethlehem obeying the law. But of course today we have people that they would they would pay money and get a free pass and well you know because she's pregnant or whatever. No, they obeyed the law you know. And so they went down there under difficult circumstances, but you know, God's clock is ticking. There's no shortcuts. There's no excuses. And there's of course many more that we could go into, but we we've got uh you know, only got 50 minutes left here. And so um the most difficult journey was taken by Jesus Christ, our Lord. They began up in Cesaria Philippi. That's the northernmost point of Israel that they visited. And that's where they were in Matthew 16 when he asked the disciples, "Well, who do you all say I am?" Well, that happened up there. Then they started south. Okay? And so as they go south, um they um traveled u about 140 miles down to Jerusalem. Now, these numbers could be off, so don't you know, now I want to tell you something. This see this level is here to remind me to stay level with what I'm saying. But it's got another purpose if I see anybody even thinking about going to sleep. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; That's the first warning. So, they came down to Jerusalem and then they went across the Kidron Valley over to Gethsemane with his disciples. That's about 600 yards. Then back over to Jerusalem as a prisoner to the private cell in the house of the high priest Kosis about 700 yards. It's all very small over there. Then they went out to Pilot's judgment hall condemned without a proper trial about 500 yards. All walking, you know, people making fun. Then over to Calvary as a convict total of about a mile and a half. That was the most difficult journey. And there at Calvary, they're the the most religious people on the planet. &gt;&gt; They couldn't see that this was the fulfillment of the scriptures they had memorized back here. &gt;&gt; They didn't have a New Testament, okay? That wouldn't written yet, but they had a Bible. It was 200 years old at the time. And they couldn't understand that this was the fulfillment. And they crucified the lamb of God. And it was all done according to words of prophets for the benefit of the purchase of Calvary, you and me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he went for. You see, we're the predestinated seed of God throughout seven ages. So, our journey today is from right here in dark lessa. Now, it's hard to believe that it's dark lessa when we have $50,000 cars. We got a $1,000 phone and all the benefits of Leosa, &gt;&gt; but it's dark. &gt;&gt; Yes. Now, a long time ago in 1959, Brother Brandham was preaching in the um islands of the Caribbean. And so, there were some Americans with him. And one of the Americans later testified that during that time they were down there for several weeks. And then he spent four hours one day with brother Brandham. And he asked him, uh, why do you say so much about 1977? Okay, any genius can see that was 18 years ahead. And so, uh, Brother Brandham said, "Well, when I was looking through the stream of time, in other words, he's seeing numbers." He said, "By the time it got to 77, it was so dark spiritually. I didn't see how anybody could live in that darkness." &gt;&gt; Now, we're over 40 years the other side. &gt;&gt; It's very dark. &gt;&gt; When we have all kinds of things going on and people joining up and people making fun, all these things, all these things are going on. But God is preparing a bride &gt;&gt; with the word for this day. Okay. Okay. So, as we're experiencing the darkness of Leadyia, remember the words of Jesus in Matthew or where in John 17:20 when he's praying for the disciples. And he says in his prayer, and I don't pray just for these sitting here, but I'm praying for those over there in Tucson. I'm praying for those way out there that would believe on me by their word. And that's what we have a New Testament for. We have their word and we believe &gt;&gt; and it's doing something in our lives and we're glad that we have a church to come to. That's right. &gt;&gt; We're not under a tree somewhere, you know. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, we were on his mind before he ever went to the cross. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says here and speak to the rock. Now, we're going to talk about a journey how that God brought his people out of Egypt into the promised land. A perfect type of leaving sin coming into the spirit land. Now there's three stages of the journey. Israel in Egypt, Israel in the journey, and Israel in the Palestine, the promised land. He says, which are all a perfect type of justification by faith coming out. Other words, good people, but they're in sin. Now they're coming out. Two, sanctification as they pass through the blood, you know, on our journey. And three, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, entering into rest. Now that is just the gospel. Okay. So it's perfectly the stages of the church. That is where the church is staged now. Okay. Some today are in the journey. They're coming out. They're passing through. They're they're they're in justification. We're not going to look down on them. We were there one time. It's a journey. You see, others are going through the blood, through the process of redemption and sanctification. And others are resting in the Holy Spirit. We all together are the church. You see, &gt;&gt; all forming the church of Jesus Christ in this journey to the resurrection. &gt;&gt; So, we're making progress. We're marching forward. Now, we're into redemption and completeness. 1954. Now, we are moved by the Holy Spirit in going now into the promised land. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not true, I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you. Is that right? Now, we have a promised land that we're going to see. Each day marks a milestone. &gt;&gt; We're not the same person we were last Sunday. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We either ate too much or we we did a lot of things, but now we're here. You see, another day, another milestone. And there's a big dark shadow setting right out before us. It's called death. And every time our heart beats, we move one step closer to that. One of these days, it's going to take its last beat. We're going in. I want to be at my time. Now, for those of you that aren't from Kentucky, that means I want to be ready, okay? As I hope each one of you is tonight. When I know that it's lying just before me and I have to meet it, I don't want to be a coward. I want to wrap myself in the robe of his righteousness, walking into it, knowing this, that I'm sure that I know him in the power of his resurrection. And when he calls from among the dead, I'll be called out with him that's living. God is God of the living. &gt;&gt; And that's one of the differences between us and the Catholic Church and a few others. God is God of the living. We're going someplace. You know, &gt;&gt; okay, another place, God has a provided way. 1956. I imagine when the ages roll on, he will just still be better all the time. When we look back and we see what God has brought us out of, brought us through, brought us into, you know, the three stages we just talked about. The Christian life is a journey. This here is a pilgrimage and we're just passing through this land. We're not going to stay here. You know, many times we build a house and we say, "Well, the family and I will will anchor down here." But for how long? You don't know. If you look, check the records. Not everybody dies at 95 years old. &gt;&gt; You don't know how long you're here. &gt;&gt; Okay? And so, um, we always would like to get to a place where we can say, "This is ours for good." But it isn't here on earth. We don't have such a place here on earth. But there is something in you that calls out for such a place. &gt;&gt; And before there could be anything in you calling out for that place, that place has to be in existence. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's very simple formula or there would be nothing here to call for it. The deep cannot call to the deep unless there's a deep to respond to it. So there has to be a place first to make this deep call out to it. Very simple. Okay. Now in the message communion 1962, he's in prayer. He says, 'We want to keep under the blood at all times, for we don't know just what might happen. All things are about wound up. &gt;&gt; We feel, Lord, that the coming of the Lord is at hand. And we're fixing to take a journey. We're in the journey now. Okay. Um we're fixing to take a journey. And as we think of a journey, we might think of suitcases and extra clothing and extra shoes. But how different is this journey? It's not packing up. It's unpacking, laying aside. As your great servant Paul said in the book of Hebrews, we lay aside every weight of unbelief that so easily besets us that we might run with patience the race that is set before us. So on this journey we have three kinds of believers. Now I didn't make this up. Brother Ram said in every congregation there's three kinds of believers. And as you look around you can probably you know come to your human conclusion. Well we know which one she is and we know who he is. Who are you? &gt;&gt; That's the question. You see, so the word is preached equally. No discrimination. Word goes out. But you see, church is like a hospital. Nobody checked your papers at the door. You come in, the word ministers to you. And and the word decides who gets to stay and who has to leave. You see, so the makebeliever and the unbeliever are just along temporarily. Okay? um they kind of enjoy the free ride because they have very little invested. &gt;&gt; Some of them don't pay tithe. They come when they feel like it. They drag in 20 minutes late. &gt;&gt; That's the make believer and the unbeliever. No, you got to be got to be serious. &gt;&gt; So soon they will jump off because they can't handle the pressure, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Or the responsibility of the preaching of the word. They want a real simple way to just push the button, you know, sit there in your pajamas. That's not church. No, let's be serious. &gt;&gt; So now they look like believers, uh, but they're impersonators, okay? They can quote, but they can't live it. So don't waste your time judging people, okay? God knows who are his and he will take care of the separating at the right time and he'll take care of the rewards. He knows what he's doing and he doesn't need our canary brain to try to figure it out. Scripture says in what is it? Psalms 46:10, "Be still. I'm God. Don't need your opinions." &gt;&gt; Yeah. But the true believer feeds every day on the word of God. He loves it because it's his life source along the way. &gt;&gt; He stays in tune. He stays in step in the correct atmosphere. And he stays balanced. &gt;&gt; You don't want to hear that sound again, do you? &gt;&gt; No. Okay, I'll be nice. The scripture says in Romans 3:23, "All have sinned and come short of the glory of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. The preachers's kids, brother Brandham's family, all the Brandhams, all the Smiths, everyone has sinned and come short of the glory of God. And none of us were born angels or perfect human beings. Now, I've got grandchildren. I know all about it. But you see, scripture says we're born in sin, shaped iniquity, come to the world speaking lies. But in John chapter 3, we have the solution. We get a glimpse of the three kinds of believers. Because in 3:16, for God so loved the world. Now, you see, a lot of people carrying spoken word books, they want to just kind of sidestep John 3:16. Well, that's for Billy Graham. No, that's for every child of God. &gt;&gt; If you don't start your journey at the foot of the cross, you're not going anywhere. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, God so loved the world. Who's that? All those that came short of the glory of God. and he freely gave his only begotten son which is the only solution. And then here comes the choice that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life. Okay. But then we get into 17 and 18 that a lot of people forget where it says for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved. It's the only solution. &gt;&gt; Not this other stuff. No, through Jesus Christ. Verse 18, he that believeth on him is not condemned. Thank you. But he that believeth not is condemned already. Why? Because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God. And if I come back someday and we'll go into the book of Acts, that was the problem all through the book of Acts. They didn't mind the miracles. They didn't mind the the the the loaves and fishes and all these other things, but just don't mention that name. And that's the problem today. They want to steer away from the name, but that's the foundation of the gospel. Okay? So, there's definitely hope for the believer, those that make the right choice. Now, in our journey, when we're going to an unfamiliar place, uh you're going to go on vacation, maybe you haven't been there before. Oh, well, I'd like to go there. Well, you got to have a map. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now, it used to be all you people, you know, uh over 50, you remember there was a map book. Well, it's in alphabetical order. So you start in Arizona &gt;&gt; and you want to go to Texas. Well, it's way down there, you know, and so you have to uh check New Mexico and everything else, but u now we have an electronic map and we have a voice to guide us every step. So in this journey, God has drawn the lines. He's highlighted certain certain verses for this time. &gt;&gt; We're not building an ark. We're not going to walk across the desert. No, we have certain verses that are of interest and uh the promises for this time &gt;&gt; and all you have to do is study the map. &gt;&gt; And our prophet said, "Read your Bible and pray." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's real simple. &gt;&gt; It's two of the steps. Remember, there's four. &gt;&gt; Brother Paul will probably come down here and, you know, ask you what the four steps were. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, pay attention. Okay. So you just simply have to recognize where you are in the plan of God. You see, recognize the signs around you. He will quicken the truth to you. &gt;&gt; And God has even provided a voice on the desk. Everything William Brandon said is on every cell phone on the planet &gt;&gt; in more than one language. &gt;&gt; You have no excuse. You see, &gt;&gt; so along the way, we have certain regrets, but we can't change the past. It's gone. You can't go back and change that. You see, the only thing you can do is repent &gt;&gt; and ask for the blood of Jesus Christ to cleanse you from all unrighteousness and correct the attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, anybody can can read and repeat. But what about the attitude? You see, &gt;&gt; so um we have over here, you know, for the present, God gives us breath today in order to make decisions which will affect our future. We already know about the mistakes we made, you know, we don't need to be reminded. uh we'll just consider that to be a learning process. &gt;&gt; We don't repeat the same mistakes. &gt;&gt; A mistake is one thing, but if it continues, it's a bad habit, &gt;&gt; which alerts you to the fact that you're anointed with an evil spirit, &gt;&gt; and you have a besetting sin. &gt;&gt; I don't know your life, but for some reason, we're going to go through this. You see, and so you need to genuinely repent, ask for prayer, get yourself in the influence, under the influence and the anointing of God's word, into a correct spiritual atmosphere. God's bride makes herself ready. All the rest don't care. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're doing what they do. They think they're right, you know, but God's bride is making herself ready. So, in today's lesson, we're simply attempting to remind you of the truth. Not here to condemn, but just to face the facts. Okay? And brother Po didn't know I was going to be here. I called him Monday and I told him I was going to come down and fellowship. You're going to be here Wednesday. Well, guess what? He already had his ticket. He was already on the way out of town. Oh, this will work fine. So, God works things out, you know. So, Brother Ram very simply said, "We have tapes on that. We've got tapes on what we believe &gt;&gt; and we've been listening for a long time, but we never needed anybody to tell us what tape and what. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Where's the spirit of God in all this mess, you know? So, as a bride, those on the journey here in 2025, it would be to your advantage to follow the four steps. Okay? That way, you stay in tune and you stay in step with God's program. Now, according to Philippians 4:7, we can actually have the peace that goes beyond all understanding. You don't have to stay up at night, you know, drinking coffee and figuring it all out. You can have the peace that passes all understanding. &gt;&gt; Now, very few people know how all these nice cars work. Okay? Some do. I don't. I know you push the button and we go, but so I understand to a certain point, but God's peace goes beyond that. You see? So, it goes beyond the understanding. It goes beyond the criticism, the religious fanaticism, legalism, and that godly peace will keep your heart and mind through Christ Jesus. Okay. Paul also wrote in the early to the early church in Rome in chapter 8:e 16, the spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, joints with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time. Now, we all have things we're dealing with. You know, I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. It's going to be a lot better than anything you can imagine. So, not only in Christ will the glory be revealed. Not only in the prophet our age will the word uh be made alive, but in us, in you and me, we are the flesh and blood believers of 2025. People are looking at us to see if Hebrews 13:8 is still alive. &gt;&gt; And we have Galatians 1:8 as our as our guide so that people can see Hebrews 13:8. You see, so as we make this journey, we have ups and downs, sufferings, rejoicing, victories, and so forth. But it's the minister's duty to encourage and remind us and keep the people focused on the present truth. &gt;&gt; That's his job. the scriptures that pertain to the hour that we're living in our current Bible promises. But you read all the word because it's all for our admonition, you know. So over here in this tape, discernment of spirit 1960 in Phoenix, I think it is a great uh prayer that he has here. And we're here this morning, Father, gathered for no other purpose but to know and to study to know rather the will of God and what we must do to make Christ real to the people of this generation. That's what brother Brandham did. He had a way of making it real to us. If he's just telling us about a a simple uh story in the Bible, but it came alive. And that's our job today. make Christ real to the people of this generation, knowing surely that in the day of the judgment, we will be brought face to face with this generation. And being ministers, we will be judges. And those people to which we have spoken and their attitude towards the word that we bring to them will determine their eternal destination. Your attitude, &gt;&gt; we only preach the word freely, no discrimination, but then your attitude will determine your destination. Therefore, Lord, in that day, we'll be a judge for or against the generation that we preach to. So, when we travel, we have to make preparations. You all know that. We got to check the schedules. We got to plan ahead. And God is not the author of confusion. No, no, no. You get there late, you're not going. So, he's very organized. He's very much on schedule. And um in the tape, uh what is it? his wonders to perform 1958. God in his great wise providence moves every cog just to hit at the right time. And that gives us faith. Sometimes we think, "Oh, everything's just topsyturvy. There's no way out of this mess." Don't think that God is making it all work exactly to his time program. &gt;&gt; It is working to his program. Might not be according to your program or people out there, but it's God's program. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. now and he knows exactly the schedule and everything is coming down right on time. &gt;&gt; Now Moses lived 40 years in Egypt because he was in a basket in the water and a pagan princess drew him out of the water and gave him the name Moses. Now that was directed by God obviously you know and so he was one step from the throne. He had servants. He didn't have to do anything. Just he snapped his fingers. Everything happened, you know, and so a lot of luxury but uh he was on a journey. Okay. The this great servant Moses 1955. Now Moses after taking the situation in his own hand found that he was total failure. And what's he talking about? Because he was convinced that he was the deliverer and he had to free the the people out of bondage. So he's going to kill these Egyptians one at a time. Well, total failure. He ran from the presence of Pharaoh, ran from the presence of God and was a stranger for 40 years back there. And he married an Ethiopian girl and so she had a lot of temper who and Moses had a lot of temper. &gt;&gt; Oh, prophet says, I would just imagine things weren't so peaceful back there on the back side of the desert at times. In other words, it was tough. Maybe not always pleasant, &gt;&gt; but it was God's program. &gt;&gt; He goes on, "Now, if you think you married a woman that has a little bit of temper, nobody said, "Amen." Scared. If you think you married a woman that has a little bit of temper, maybe God is trying to tame you down a little bit and vice versa. Okay, now we'll stop there for a minute. you know, uh, when people start getting attracted to each other and they think they're going to get married and all that. Well, in Spanish, we say you found the other half orange, you know, perfect fit. And so, we we have this idea of 50/50. But, see, if you're thinking 50/50, then when you put your head on the pillow at night, that's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Thinking who won? Did I win? Did she win? &gt;&gt; Okay, the better formula is 8020. You give 80%. Give everything expecting 20. Then she's doing the same thing. And you meet in the middle. Perfect. Okay. And then out there, what was God doing? Schooling into the man's mind what the program of God was. Wow. Just imagine God using a highteered woman to speak some sense into his mighty prophet. &gt;&gt; Moses and all the prophets were humans. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. Moses was back there waiting, hurting sheep out in the desert. There's a perfect picture here before us tonight of a believer out of fellowship with God. Now, see, we wouldn't want to think about that about Moses. He was human. He was out of fellowship with God for 40 years. &gt;&gt; He was in the palace for 40 years. Now, he's got to take all got to erase those 40 years before you can use him at 80 years old. So, here they are living on the desert and just like here, the wind blows, dirt comes in. They didn't have a nice sealed place with air conditioning. And so she's trying to keep the place clean. Her name was Zapora. And he's out there watching the father-in-law's sheep. Now sheep are very uh docile and very peaceful animals, but they smell. So he's out there with these sheep all day long. And he comes in. He's tired. And what's she What do you think? She said, "Moses, shoes, please. at the door. The same thing every day. Nobody told him what to do in the palace. You know, this is different. So, he had to take the shoes off. Well, then one day he's out there and he sees this bush burning. Now, he never seen that before. So, he gets a little closer. He gets closer to the to the bush and all of a sudden, Moses, yes, sir. Take off your shoes. &gt;&gt; See, he had heard that before. God was schooling into the man's mind. So there he was, no fellowship. Not one thing in 40 years have spoken that God did for him. He was out of fellowship. And when the church gets out of fellowship with God, miracles cease, signs and wonders cease, revival cease, God just moves right on when you get out of fellowship. Now the thing to do, in other words, to remedy the situation is to keep the love of God in your heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but they said this and he said that and that other church over there. No, real simple. Keep the love of God in your heart. &gt;&gt; Keep fellowship with him. And he will add these other things as we mature. &gt;&gt; Now, there's probably, you know, children here under 15 that would love to have the keys to the car, &gt;&gt; but it's not going to happen. as they mature, as we can trust them. I mean, I raised three kids and I remember telling them years ago, I'm going to trust you until you give me a reason not to, you know. And so, we have t people today, they they get in the Bible, oh, look what it says here. They hear brother Ram say certain things. Well, see, now that's today. I'm the man or whatever. Making plans for the future, and they don't know what they're talking about. Just today, I had a big argument. not in an argument, but he was asking me, "What about the about the millennium?" Okay, we got a few things here about the millennium, but it's only for those that are mature enough to get there. &gt;&gt; We don't need that information now. &gt;&gt; We need to get to the resurrection. Don't worry about the rest of it. &gt;&gt; As we've matured and so Moses out of fellowship, no fellowship out there in a strange country among strangers, not his own people. She was Ethiopian. He was a Jew. completely out of the reach of God seemingly and God all the time knowing that no matter how much of a mess man makes out of the program of God is going to straighten it out. &gt;&gt; So you see there is hope. &gt;&gt; Okay. So in traveling we must be aware of the dress code. I know it's kind of hard to believe for some people but you know it used to be that there was a difference between men and women's clothing. I spend a lot of time in the airport and I see every kind of perversion you can imagine including the tattoos everywhere. We live in a perverse world. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Rammit addressed that also because in 1964 he said if this goes on the way it is right now or whatever he was focused on I don't know but he said if it goes on the way it is now in 50 years it'll be total insanity. So that circle closed in 2014. So we've been 11 years in total insanity. It's not a surprise. So um what do we have here? Well, the way of a true prophet, 1963. And usually prosperity causes sin. Many people look upon prosperity as blessings. It would be if we could handle it right, but it usually leads to sin, dishonoring God. So you want to say what he said. That's what we're trying to do. Okay. How Israel had drifted off into a terrible sin. Got away from God. Got away from his commandments and his precepts. Gone off all together on a tantrum. And women walk the streets in their fine immodest clothes. Now, if you go in the shopping center, you're going to notice that there's all kinds of stuff for the women and the men. And usually the skimpier the clothes, the more they cost. So, because Satan is the designer, you see, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, the men went about gambling and drinking the roadous and so forth. And uh where's it at down here? Sin was disregarded by the ministry. Just laying wide open. Sin was not rebuked from the pulpit anymore. It was on the loose. So you see one thing that Satan has accomplished in our time better than any other time um in all of history really he's blurred or erased the lines of distinction. you know, the men looked like women, men, women look like men. And so sometimes it's almost impossible to tell the difference. And um William Brandon had a few words for that. Called it Tommy rot, perversion, sodommites. And we're living right in the middle of insanity. &gt;&gt; So be careful how quickly and how you, you know, tend to have an attitude of throwing rocks at the churches that uh you know aren't doing it. just the way we think it ought to be when you let your boys and girls uh dress the way they do. &gt;&gt; Children must live your convictions until they have their own Bible-based convictions. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. This is pretty hard here. Anointed ones at the end time 1965. You say, "Well, whether we're Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostals, we're all the same." We are not the same. You are a separated people, holy unto the Lord, dedicated to the word and to the spirit of God to bear fruit of his promise of this day. We are different and you are not one of them. I know that's awful strong, but it's the truth just the same. You are dedicated to a service. You are dedicated to a service in this last day. Come out from amongst it. Now, I was sitting from here to the organ when he preached this. I heard all this live. Of course, it went over my head, but it's very true. I don't care how real it sounds, how much they try to impersonate. If it is a lie, if it is contrary to God's word for this hour, &gt;&gt; I don't care what it is. If it's contrary to the written word of God for this hour, it is a lie. &gt;&gt; You can take that to the bank. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God will have nothing to do with it. No matter how sincere, how educated, how smart, how true it sounds, how reasonable it sounds if it's contrary to the word of God for this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; According to St. Paul, the ministry must be properly equipped for the journey. You'll find that in second 2 second Timothy 3:16. And remember in the church age book chapter 4, uh, paragraph 189, they must be properly equipped and say what he said. For this journey, you also have to have proper papers. So, everybody has a birth certificate. That's your natural birth. But then you have to have a passport if you're going to get on the plane, if you're going to go somewhere. You know, we call that born again. And then the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the visa to go to certain places that are hard to get to. So, we get to one of my favorite subjects beyond the curtain of time. Right after brother Random had that experience in May of 1960, he says here in the rejected king, I heard a voice then that spoke to me that was in the room and it said, "This is what you preached was the Holy Ghost. This is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it." That's pretty serious. I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there. and my precious friends, my beloved, my darlings of the gospel, my my begotten children of God. Listen to me, your pastor. I wish there's some way to explain it to you. There are no words. I can't find them anywhere. But just beyond this last breath is the most glorious thing. There's no no way to explain it. There's no way. I just cannot do it. But friends, whatever you do, lay aside everything else until you get perfect love. &gt;&gt; Get to a spot that you can love everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we've been hearing this for years. We have to put it into practice. We have to get serious. You know, where you can love everybody, every enemy, everything else. That one visit there has made me a different man. I can never never be the same, brother Brandon. And a couple months later, he's u telling about the same thing, the tape from that time. Just remember, I'll say this in the faith that I have in that vision, whatever it was, and I'll speak it in the name of the Lord. Except you have that perfect love, you will never be there because nothing could ever be there without it. Your spirit would would be out of place there. My friends, you old people, you young people, you do not know what time you're going to leave. We don't know that. See, we know the past. We won't try to forget some of it. We know we're right here, but we don't know the future. See, but let me persuade you as a Christian brother, one that loves you, except you're born again and the spirit of God and love comes into your heart, you will certainly miss that place. &gt;&gt; So all we can do is warn you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So we must have, you know, make preparations. We got to have proper dress code, properly equipped, proper papers. One thing else, we got to be flexible. You know, now that doesn't mean come to church when you feel like it. We got a time when things start, but you got to be flexible because some of your ideas aren't aren't just exactly right. You see, there is a precise schedule and God knows the details. So, we get zealous and we come up with private ideas and we come up with interpretations. We've seen that over the years. We figure it out. We make plans. But you can count on one thing for sure. God will fulfill his word on his schedule. &gt;&gt; There's no room for fanatics. There's no room for legalists. Along the journey, you're going to face many temptations, trials, pitfalls. But the scripture in Hebrews 4 says that we have a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities &gt;&gt; because he was tempted in all points like us. His mercy and understanding extend to every part of the journey. Okay? His mercy is to all generations. When we're tempted, we have an advocate. Okay? So we can come boldly into his presence. We seek his mercy. It's like an oasis. It's a refreshing. And we're not victims. We're overcomers. We're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus. Revelations 12:11 says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony. So see, that's that's back to balance. He the blood of the lamb is for sure, &gt;&gt; but your testimony is what kind of shakes sometimes. Amen. &gt;&gt; But your testimony has to be in line with the blood of the lamb. And that's how you overcome. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So in our journey, we become restless, become critical. We develop attitude. Where's the promise of his coming? All things continue the same. I'm tired of the pastor always preaching right at me. So much griping and complaining. &gt;&gt; Probably not in this church, but those other churches I've been to. &gt;&gt; So you're bored. You got too much free time. But if you spent that same time and energy reading the word, praying for the needs of the others, you see, um then the trip would seem shorter and your attitude would improve in direct proportion. So along the way, we see signs, you know, like when you're going to Phoenix so far, and then when you get closer, signs are sooner, you know, that's kind of is with this uh this trip here. And uh we have to make adjustments as we get closer because see the Holy Spirit is not shortsighted. Holy Spirit can see the whole program. You see, and our God can see the entire journey. He knows the end from the beginning. And he can see through all time and space. He knows about the fusses you had. &gt;&gt; He knows you should have prayed before you got here, you know. And um he knows what your attitude's going to be when you go drink coffee tonight. &gt;&gt; Why did brother Pope invite him? Man, he surely could have done better than that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I've got enemies out there. I don't not everybody's my friend, you know. So, it's okay. So, God knows all these things. That's right. &gt;&gt; See, he knows it all. And the devil sets traps. Leodosa is like a minefield. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And our attitude towards God's word and God's messengers determines our deter our destination. &gt;&gt; So, couple other things here will be done. Character is not a gift. It's a victory indicating that things you have to overcome to or obtain it. Peter was rough. Mary was mild. Both had things to overcome and both had to go to the upper room. &gt;&gt; Character is not a gift no matter what your name might be. So, as we're on this journey, we have expectations for the reunion that'll take place when we arrive. We see our loved ones that we haven't seen for many years. But God has planned it so perfectly. Just like in Acts chapter 1, he said he came back and he was with the disciples, you know, a month or so. Well, he brings our loved ones to us right at the end of the trip. We've been instructed that prior to the going away. There'll be a period of a month or so when we'll get together with other members of the body. We'll have this time to take care of the greetings, who made it, who's not. You know, all that's going to be taken care of because see, only God has the list. I don't know who they are. God has a list. These are going, these are staying back. And you can't change that. Okay? So, there'll be a time to to take care of the greetings. And then he takes us to his house. All our attention will be on him. Brother Rem told one individual, "One of these days, you'll hear a knock at the door. You'll be vacuuming, doing the dishes, whatever, maybe washing the car, and you'll hear a knock on the door, &gt;&gt; and you go open the door, &gt;&gt; there's your mom, &gt;&gt; there's your dad, there's your grandpa, whatever. &gt;&gt; You know, I'm depending on that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you'll know the resurrection has is set in. So, um, some of us have been on this journey a long time and, uh, we have to a lot to be accountable for and we have a great responsibility. We've seen many signs and it all indicates that they're almost home. So, I just want you to digest these things, think it over. If the musicians are come, we'll try to close this. But know that God can see your attitude. He sees where you've been. He's full of forgiveness, you see. And he wants you, the bride, to be there. So, let's stand together and uh we can sing that. Um, all to Jesus I surrender all. All to him I freely do. Oh, to Jesus I surrender all to him. I freely give. I will ever come and trust him in his presence daily. [Music] I surrender all. I surrender all [Music] to thee my blessed savior I surrender all shall we pray heavenly father we thank you for your mercy we thank you Lord for this portion of your word that you let us study Tonight, we pray that everybody can take something home. If it was just two words, Lord, that they could remember the four steps, how to stay balanced, how to stay in step. We just pray that you would bless each one as they go and there be peace. And Lord, may others see that there is a Christian people that live by the word of God. We're not a political party. We're not trying to, you know, turn everything back. No, just living the word for our day. Thank you for your word. Thank you for all things. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] Oh, I surrender all. All to thee, my bless I surrender all. Oh, I surrender all. Oh, I surrender. I surrender all [Music] to thee. My blessed savior. God surrender all. Let us praise the Lord for our precious brother tonight by putting our hands together. We appreciate brother George. We're so thankful he feels right at home to come and worship with us. These brothers that are getting up there in age that spent this time with our precious prophet, Brother Brandham, and that are balanced in the word, they're fewer and fewer. We're so thankful to to take advantage of them every time that we get and we just want them to continue to be right at home. And I I I had intended to ask the young people these questions before. He said, you know, take good notes. So, we're going to give our young people a little quiz in a moment. And uh we're just appreciate our brother tonight. He talked about the balance. Do you know what those? So the young people I mean people like Rebecca and Jeremiah and Elijah, Nina, Anna, Timmy, Lydia, Nathaniel, Rachel, Ella, and those. So what is the level for those two items that he told us? Young people, does anybody know? Were you paying attention tonight? What are the two reasons we have that level? To stay balanced and why, Nathaniel? Stay awake. So, I know you all did real good. Hopefully that wasn't for one of my kids tonight. So, what are the four things, young people, that brother George encouraged us to do? There's four things, young people, you're not you're you're kind of there, but I'm talking about these ones right here. Rachel, you always take good notes. Now, what are they? Very good. Thank you for that. [Applause] So, he's given us about 12 tapes. Anna probably has them all. Maybe our 20 minutes could be one of those. What tapes was he quoting from tonight?
