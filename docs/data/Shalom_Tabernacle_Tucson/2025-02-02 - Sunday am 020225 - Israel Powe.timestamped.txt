[1:52] believe
[1:54] only
[1:57] be only
[2:02] believe all things are
[2:07] possible
[2:09] only
[2:12] be you may be seated brother
[2:17] Brandon now the second Church age was
[2:20] called The Church age of
[2:24] Samia and it taken place the
[2:27] Samia age was issued in at the same time
[2:32] the Ephesian age went
[2:34] out the Ephesian age was from
[2:39] ad55 to ad
[2:42] 170 the Suna Age come in at 170 and goes
[2:46] to
[2:47] 312 this church is the persecuted Church
[2:52] the one that wears the Martyr
[2:55] Crown is a church of
[2:58] tribulation and God's promise to it to
[3:01] the elected Church in it was to give it
[3:04] a Crown of
[3:07] Life each church had a star that was
[3:10] held in God's hand which represented the
[3:12] messenger to that church
[3:15] age the best that I could think was a
[3:18] messenger at the Ephesian Church age
[3:20] because the Bible does not say who they
[3:23] are was Paul because he established the
[3:26] Ephesian church and was the minister of
[3:29] that church Church age that brought the
[3:31] light to the church which St John taking
[3:33] it up from there and then polart and on
[3:35] down AP polart rather on down now the
[3:39] Samia age I believe with all the that I
[3:43] have been able to find was
[3:48] ireneus and now I want to give you the
[3:52] reason why that I chose
[3:56] arenus instead of poar
[4:00] now most all clergymen wants to think
[4:03] and Bible teachers that that angel was
[4:07] polart apart was a disciple of St John
[4:12] that is true and apart sealed he was a
[4:15] marter they stabbed him out of the heart
[4:17] and killed him now but he was a great
[4:21] man a notable man a Godly Man sweet no
[4:25] doubt one of the greatest Christians
[4:28] we've ever had
[4:30] and there was nothing you could say
[4:31] against his life the reason that I chose
[4:35] arenus because I believe that arenus
[4:39] was more closer to the scripture than
[4:42] polart was because apart lean kindly
[4:47] towards the Roman idea of setting up an
[4:52] organization and and arenius was firmly
[4:55] against
[4:56] it he absolutely denounced
[5:00] it and then as we all know the great
[5:03] issue was coming at the nine Council one
[5:07] of the great issues was whether God was
[5:10] three or God was
[5:13] one and arenius Tu theide that God was
[5:18] God now it just one I might read from
[5:22] the aning fathers volume one page 412
[5:28] just a little quotation if you want to
[5:30] put that down volume one of the n i Nan
[5:34] fathers and on page
[5:38] 12 and it's uh if you want the volume
[5:41] it's the last part of volume three you
[5:43] can might read the whole thing is
[5:44] several uh chapters of it or several um
[5:50] sentences now I'll begin to read right
[5:52] the last about the last 20 30 verses of
[5:56] it I won't read it all but just part of
[5:59] it
[6:00] all the other Expressions likewise
[6:05] being being out the title of one and the
[6:09] same being see he's trying to say what
[6:12] they called him father son Holy Ghost
[6:14] and he said that's
[6:16] titles not names titles of the one
[6:21] being that's exactly what we teach yet
[6:25] today as for the example and then in
[6:28] parenthesis in English
[6:30] the Lord of power the Lord father of all
[6:35] God Almighty most high Creator the maker
[6:41] and such like these are not the names
[6:44] and titles of succession of different
[6:48] beings but of one and the same
[6:54] amen by the name of which the one God
[6:57] father is
[7:00] he he who all these things Grant to all
[7:05] of EX existence the boom of all
[7:09] existence arenus says that all these
[7:13] titles are summed up into one name under
[7:18] one
[7:19] God and there are only titles of what he
[7:23] was he was the rose of
[7:27] Sharon that's what he was
[7:30] that's a title he was the Morning Star
[7:34] he was Alpha he was Omega that's titles
[7:38] of what he was he was father he was son
[7:41] he was Holy Ghost but there's one
[7:44] God one God and his name is
[7:48] one and that's one reason that I thought
[7:51] arenius was correct in his in his
[7:55] diagnosis this year or interpretation of
[7:57] the scripture another thing but I'd like
[8:00] to read you it's found in the book um
[8:04] how did it
[8:05] happen and this is by the
[8:08] historians and um how did it happen but
[8:12] RC Hazelton the history of the early
[8:14] churches and here on page 180 the
[8:18] spiritual gifts in iren's time ad 177 to
[8:25] 202 now reason I'm quoting this it's
[8:28] going on tape you see and and it'll be
[8:30] taken off on
[8:32] books it was in iris's
[8:35] time that the most of the Apostolic
[8:39] Church of France had all the gifts of
[8:43] the Holy Ghost that was from him
[8:46] teaching
[8:48] arus church members at lines that's
[8:51] lines French spoke with
[8:54] tongues it was not uncommon to see
[8:57] someone dead brought back back to
[9:02] life healing
[9:05] was healing was an everyday occurrence
[9:09] in all the Evangelist Evangelical
[9:12] churches
[9:14] everywhere at our Aras know how to
[9:17] teach Miracles were frequent in fact
[9:21] those churches were never without a
[9:25] miraculous manifestation of God's
[9:28] presence either by vision supension of
[9:32] the elements of nature in a miracle to
[9:35] remind the Evangelical Christians of
[9:38] that
[9:40] day there was his beloved
[9:44] disciples but from the histories of the
[9:49] past we cannot glean a single instance
[9:53] of raising the dead in the first Roman
[9:56] Church
[10:00] that's people that don't not interested
[10:02] in either side they're just telling the
[10:04] truth it's
[10:05] historians that's why I think arenus
[10:08] because you see he had the same faith
[10:13] that Paul and the disciples had handed
[10:16] down that's why I have believe that he
[10:19] was the angel of the Church of uh saman
[10:25] because he was he had the same
[10:29] scriptural teachings and the same
[10:32] scriptural teachings upon the basis of
[10:35] God's word will produce the same thing
[10:38] every
[10:40] time if you will just simply take God's
[10:44] formula and Carri it out to the letter
[10:47] no matter what the churches say just
[10:48] follow it just the way it says it'll
[10:50] produce the same thing and that's what
[10:53] arenius did now I think that polyart was
[10:57] a fine man understand but I say that he
[11:00] leaned too much to organize the church
[11:02] and like the nickol adans was doing they
[11:05] were organizing the church and and
[11:07] bringing a Brotherhood together which
[11:09] seems all right
[11:11] intellectually but you see the spirit is
[11:13] so far ahead of the intellectual so that
[11:16] you can't even think right to to the
[11:18] spirit my high thoughts are higher than
[11:21] your thoughts sayith God my ways are
[11:23] higher than your ways so there's only
[11:26] one way to do that just follow him by
[11:28] the blue print that's right now we might
[11:32] think if you was going from here if I
[11:34] was going uh to Chicago tonight oh I
[11:37] might out here get me a compass and say
[11:39] now let's see Chicago set right this way
[11:42] all right I'll take right off I wouldn't
[11:44] get out of Jefferson there see I got to
[11:47] get me a road map and it's it's a lay
[11:50] way lined out that I can go to Chicago
[11:53] in 6 or 7 hours of travel by automobile
[11:57] but I can't just cut anyway
[11:59] the airplane just can't cut anyway he's
[12:01] got a a airline or certain height and
[12:04] things that he has to fly a certain
[12:07] degrees that he has to stay in there's a
[12:10] way made and God has a way God has a way
[12:14] for his church for his people and he
[12:17] never did intend it to be controlled by
[12:19] popes Cardinals Archbishop or general
[12:22] overseers the holy spirit is the tutor
[12:26] of the Church of the Living God the
[12:28] raising
[12:30] and all the Holiness don't go to a
[12:32] cardinal or a priest to make him a holy
[12:35] man in the church anything the Ley is
[12:38] just as right much right to the Holy
[12:41] Spirit as any preacher Pastor Deacon
[12:45] trustee whatever more Ley and the reason
[12:49] they call it nickol Lans as we had last
[12:52] night nickol we broke the word down took
[12:55] it from the Greek and n i c KO o me
[12:59] nickel which means to conquer or to
[13:03] overthrow what nko nickel Le
[13:09] Ley to conquer the Ley and overthrow it
[13:13] by giving them an order of man clergymen
[13:17] that would teach them and would uh they
[13:20] would get their own conclusions together
[13:23] that's how the N Council was held
[13:26] because many got together and fixed step
[13:29] uh an order in the Ning Council we ain't
[13:32] going to talk too much on it because
[13:34] that's Thursday nights in the Ning
[13:37] Council but there's where the Roman
[13:39] Catholic Church was formed out of a
[13:42] group of people that were converts of
[13:44] Saint Paul and irenius and St uh Martin
[13:49] and on down they were converted
[13:52] Christians to the from paganism over to
[13:57] Christianity but wanted to pull the
[13:59] church back into a an Old Testament form
[14:03] of ministry like having high priest and
[14:07] and Apostolic successions like one Pope
[14:10] to another Pope another Pope if we could
[14:12] go on down through this Bible you'd find
[14:15] out that that's just exactly the truth
[14:17] and how God condemned the thing from the
[14:19] very beginning and last night's Church
[14:21] they said I hate it and so did the
[14:23] church am God never intended the church
[14:26] to be run by man amen God runs his
[14:29] church and he runs it through gifts of
[14:33] the Spirit the gifts of the Spirit is in
[14:35] the church to correct the spirit amen
[14:38] he's got five ministerial offices in his
[14:41] church first of them is Apostles are
[14:45] missionaries missionary is the highest
[14:47] calling there is Apostle the word
[14:49] missionary means one Saint Apostle means
[14:52] one Saint why they ever chose to be
[14:54] called a missionary I don't know but
[14:56] they are Apostles all apostles
[14:59] prophets teachers evangelists pastors
[15:03] now that's the elected offices of God to
[15:06] his church then in each local church
[15:09] there's nine spiritual gifts that come
[15:12] among the people that is knowledge
[15:15] wisdom Gifts of healing working of
[15:18] Miracles speaking with tongues
[15:19] interpretation of tongues and all these
[15:21] things go in each local body and every
[15:26] person in the church has an individual
[15:31] Ministry and that individual Ministry
[15:35] goes together with the rest of the
[15:37] ministry to edify the body of Jesus
[15:40] Christ amen and never I remember
[15:43] this that here is I'll draw these lines
[15:46] tonight the first church Ephesus Samia
[15:51] Heros
[15:53] thara
[15:55] Sardis Philadelphia lady OA
[15:59] now remember as this goes on this church
[16:03] had the fullness of the spirit but at
[16:07] the end of the church age we find that
[16:10] it was being pressed out the next Church
[16:13] age pressed a little more little more
[16:16] though this one there was just a little
[16:18] teeny
[16:20] Speck you have a few things he said oh
[16:23] when we get to that th Church age now
[16:27] after that come God raised up a German
[16:30] by the name of Martin Luther that swung
[16:32] the church back again it started out a
[16:35] little more he preached justification
[16:38] Along come Martin Luther preach
[16:41] justification Along come John Wesley and
[16:44] preach
[16:46] sanctification then in this church age
[16:49] here they come right straight back again
[16:51] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost again
[16:54] with the same signs and wonders coming
[16:55] right down here's where it went out
[16:57] through 1500 years of Dark Ages and
[17:01] there where the darkest the longest
[17:03] church period we had in the church ages
[17:05] then here's where it starts coming out
[17:07] justification sanctification baptism
[17:09] Holy Ghost and the Bible says that in
[17:12] the end of this age that this little
[17:16] minority here will be squeezed down
[17:18] because the same church of Pentecost
[17:21] will start doing the same thing they
[17:22] started back here niol
[17:25] adans oh God let me keep my mouth shut
[17:28] like get to that see well I can see that
[17:32] see until you can see here and I'll show
[17:35] you that the messenger to this church
[17:37] age will hate denominations
[17:40] amen the spirit will raise up in the
[17:43] children it's always been and now we got
[17:47] to now if you notice this how it was
[17:50] great there when I finally smothered it
[17:53] all the way out then it starts back
[17:55] Luther pulled it back justification
[17:58] sanctification
[17:59] baptism the Holy Ghost and then right at
[18:01] the end time he Smothers it right down
[18:04] until this is almost completely gone out
[18:07] you're just a little teeny bit there
[18:09] that's when he screams that if he don't
[18:12] cut the work short for the elected sake
[18:15] there will be no flesh saved see there
[18:19] you are right at the end time now bear
[18:22] that in mind now we're going to start on
[18:24] this uh Samia Church
[18:27] Age first I want to break it down here
[18:29] on some paper that I that I
[18:32] have now the second Church age being
[18:36] Samia and I believe you'll all agree
[18:40] with me or hope you do or halfway anyhow
[18:44] that irenius was the star to that church
[18:47] age he was God's messenger because he
[18:50] swept the country in the France G down
[18:53] in there and he established churches and
[18:54] every one them established up on the
[18:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost speaking in
[18:58] tongues ra the dead Healing The Sick
[19:00] stopping the rains and Performing
[19:02] Miracles daily they know that the Living
[19:05] God lived among the
[19:07] people that was a man of God Amen
[19:10] because Jesus said no man can do the the
[19:13] people said no man can do these works
[19:14] except God be with him it was Nicodemus
[19:17] that told Jesus that now a city of
[19:21] Commerce a Trading Outlet to Lydia and
[19:24] to the
[19:25] West the third largest city in Asia
[19:29] a great Harbor City noted for wealth
[19:33] temples buildings schools medicine and
[19:37] signs Jews lived at at Samaria and they
[19:41] evangelized the
[19:43] Samaritan
[19:44] people pollart was the first Bishop of
[19:48] Samaria polart and other Faithful
[19:50] Servants established the Deep faith of
[19:53] God in the believing Samaritans early
[19:56] church fathers give exhalation of the
[19:58] truth to
[20:00] Samaran the church age of
[20:03] Samaria the name of the church was Sam
[20:07] Samia rather that
[20:10] means uh
[20:14] bitterness mura It's associated with
[20:17] dead because they were dying A
[20:21] persecuted church God called and
[20:23] persecuted God looked upon their
[20:26] persecutions and gave great to
[20:29] Bear he looked upon his tribulations and
[20:33] gave them victory over death looked upon
[20:35] their poverty and give them riches in
[20:39] him the Church of Samia passed through
[20:43] the fiery furnace of tribulations but
[20:46] was a sweet smelling savior unto him
[20:49] that's that Remnant now not the whole
[20:51] saman church just a Remnant I'm speaking
[20:54] of the great 10 days of tribulation
[20:57] means 10 years all the bloodiest
[21:01] persecution I don't know where I can
[21:03] spell his name or pronounce it or not
[21:04] this was the emperor at that time I
[21:06] believe was the bloodiest one of all of
[21:08] them since Nero in '
[21:11] 67 d i o c l e t i
[21:16] n during the year of
[21:20] 303 to 312
[21:23] ad God exhorts Samia to be faithful unto
[21:29] death as he was and I will give you a
[21:32] Crown of Life As the father has given me
[21:37] God promised the
[21:38] Overcomer and tribulations the victory
[21:41] over the second death fear not them
[21:44] which can kill the body but he that can
[21:47] destroy the soul kill the
[21:49] soul it the Samar was to endure to the
[21:53] end fear not man and a crown of life
[21:56] will be given you the persecution of
[21:59] Christianity in the ages are typed in
[22:02] the church ages of samarra are very
[22:06] important we want to get to it just in a
[22:08] little bit Lord willing now if some of
[22:11] you missed some of these why if I write
[22:13] them a little too fast for the rest of
[22:15] the class and we we are you can

[1:11:07] day so pray for us pray for us pray for
[1:11:09] us so God bless you we like to go right
[1:11:11] into the word it's in the Old Testament
[1:11:14] we've been in uh dealing with this great
[1:11:17] character Joshua and
[1:11:19] Caleb and we like to stand and we're
[1:11:22] going to go to Joshua chapter 3
[1:11:30] so good to see brother Kurt brother Kurt
[1:11:32] my phone just died right on us and then
[1:11:35] I couldn't get it charged and then I got
[1:11:38] busy and so I apologize I know you you I
[1:11:41] know you figured that out and so thank
[1:11:44] the Lord amen Joshua chapter 3
[1:11:59] there's so many types and shadows in the
[1:12:02] Book of
[1:12:03] Joshua because it uh reflects where we
[1:12:07] are
[1:12:08] today and uh one of the definitions of a
[1:12:12] type and a shadow is are the events
[1:12:16] people or circumstances that happen in
[1:12:19] the
[1:12:19] natural that represent something
[1:12:22] spiritual so that's a type that that's a
[1:12:25] shadow and it's common characteristics
[1:12:29] or common themes that are played over
[1:12:32] and over again and then you could see
[1:12:34] that as a type and the shadow if you
[1:12:37] stand in the sunlight your body casts a
[1:12:40] shadow and it's you casting that shadow
[1:12:44] if you can follow the shadow follow the
[1:12:46] type you can find what's causing the
[1:12:49] shadow to exist so the Old Testament is
[1:12:52] full of these full your Bible is full
[1:12:55] full of types and shadows in Joshua the
[1:12:58] Book of Joshua is a tremendous type and
[1:13:01] Shadow of the day that you and I live in
[1:13:04] today so let's take Joshua chap 3: 1 and
[1:13:07] Joshua Rose early in the morning and
[1:13:10] they removed from Shum and came to
[1:13:12] Jordan and he and all the children of
[1:13:14] Israel and lodged there before they
[1:13:17] passed over and it came to pass after
[1:13:20] three days that the officers went
[1:13:23] through the host they commanded the
[1:13:26] people saying when you see the Ark of
[1:13:29] the Covenant of the Lord your God and
[1:13:30] the priests the Levites bearing it then
[1:13:34] ye shall remove from your place and go
[1:13:38] after it yet there shall be a space
[1:13:41] between you and it about 2,000 cubits by
[1:13:45] measure come not near unto it that you
[1:13:48] may know the way by which you must go
[1:13:51] for you have not passed this way his th
[1:13:55] to four and Joshua said unto the people
[1:13:59] sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the
[1:14:04] Lord will do wonders among you and
[1:14:07] Joshua spake unto the priest saying take
[1:14:09] up the Ark of the Covenant pass over
[1:14:12] before the people and they took up the
[1:14:15] Ark of the Covenant and went before the
[1:14:18] people and the Lord said unto
[1:14:22] Joshua this day will will I begin to
[1:14:28] magnify thee in the sight of all Israel
[1:14:33] that they may know that as I was with
[1:14:38] Moses so I will be with
[1:14:43] thee what a promise amen let us pray
[1:14:47] Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on your
[1:14:49] word this portion of the word we read
[1:14:52] this morning bless uh the furtherance of
[1:14:55] this service I pray you'll help us to
[1:14:58] say only what you want us to say and to
[1:15:01] hear only what we need to hear in Jesus
[1:15:05] name we pray amen God bless you you may
[1:15:08] be seated as you're being seated take
[1:15:10] one more scripture in the same book
[1:15:12] Joshua chapter number 24 this is at the
[1:15:16] end of his life and
[1:15:19] Ministry Joshua is now coming to the end
[1:15:24] of his day
[1:15:25] here and
[1:15:28] um he's going
[1:15:30] to give his final address to the
[1:15:37] people
[1:15:39] and
[1:15:44] um and let's read the testimony of
[1:15:48] Joshua here
[1:16:03] yes excuse me just a
[1:16:05] moment J
[1:16:08] 24 and
[1:16:10] 31 and I like this
[1:16:12] scripture um let me just get it right
[1:16:23] here and take verse 29 and it came to
[1:16:26] pass after these things that Joshua the
[1:16:29] son of nun the servant of the Lord died
[1:16:32] being 110 years old and they buried him
[1:16:35] in the border of his inheritance and
[1:16:38] timna the Sarah which is in the Mount
[1:16:42] Ephraim on the north side of the hill of
[1:16:45] gash and Israel served the Lord all the
[1:16:49] days of Joshua and all the days of the
[1:16:52] elders that overl Jos Yeshua and which
[1:16:56] had known all the works of the Lord that
[1:16:59] he had done for Israel and so you know
[1:17:03] this is really a
[1:17:05] testimony of the leadership of
[1:17:08] Joshua how the
[1:17:10] elders that uh worked with him that
[1:17:13] served with him you could see his
[1:17:17] influence over their life and that's
[1:17:20] what you call a legacy that's when your
[1:17:24] life
[1:17:25] outlives when you leave from here your
[1:17:28] testimony still leaves on it leaves an
[1:17:32] imprint on other people it's an example
[1:17:36] it's a guide It's you know something
[1:17:39] that people can refer to to draw how
[1:17:44] will you handle things how would you
[1:17:47] have dealt with that and this city has
[1:17:50] had a number of those that have come our
[1:17:52] way one of the great ones in my own eyes
[1:17:55] was was brother McHugh brother Doug
[1:17:58] McHugh many times I have thought in
[1:18:01] myself how would I and there's his
[1:18:02] brother right there bless you how would
[1:18:05] I how would brother Doug do with this
[1:18:08] what was his thoughts be I think that of
[1:18:11] brother Dalton brother green and many
[1:18:14] brother Carpenter and many of the elders
[1:18:17] that I knew personally and how would
[1:18:21] they have handled how would they have
[1:18:23] stood but yet you still have
[1:18:26] to like I was listening to a tape where
[1:18:29] brother Wesco preached here uh some time
[1:18:31] ago he he used an old Southern Southern
[1:18:35] expression he says every tub has to sit
[1:18:38] on its own
[1:18:39] bottom and uh yeah you can laugh at that
[1:18:43] that was it was a little humor but every
[1:18:46] tub has to sit on its own bottom and
[1:18:48] every individual has to take their own
[1:18:52] stand and um we have examples that the
[1:18:55] word of the Lord gives us and uh we go
[1:18:59] and we look at the types and shadows and
[1:19:01] it's a beautiful thing when you can
[1:19:04] recognize your day or your time amen or
[1:19:09] your
[1:19:10] season is this my time is this my season
[1:19:16] and when you can recognize that as we
[1:19:18] brought to you the other day on those
[1:19:20] five must that it must be God's time it
[1:19:24] must must be God's season it must come
[1:19:27] through a prophet that Prophet must be a
[1:19:30] Vindicated prophet and those five musts
[1:19:34] are some of the disciplines that we we
[1:19:38] must operate in as a Believer so when
[1:19:40] we're catching types and shadows then we
[1:19:45] always want to know where does that type
[1:19:49] start where does it end because the type
[1:19:52] in Shadow is just that it's a pattern
[1:19:55] of things that have gone that has
[1:19:58] happened before and then now you can use
[1:20:01] that for an example for you now the
[1:20:06] prophet of God makes the statement and
[1:20:08] I've read it for you many times in the
[1:20:11] church age book and then also and the
[1:20:14] spoken word is the original seed to let
[1:20:17] us stand like Joshua and Caleb so he
[1:20:20] pulls these two characters out of the
[1:20:24] Bible out of history and tells us that
[1:20:28] it's going to have a spiritual
[1:20:30] background to it he says that in this
[1:20:34] message and and we've mentioned it many
[1:20:37] many times and I don't want it to get
[1:20:38] old to you but because it becomes a
[1:20:41] pattern to us now let us stand like
[1:20:44] Joshua and Caleb 808 he says now watch
[1:20:49] close this is going to have a spiritual
[1:20:52] background let us stand like Joshua and
[1:20:55] Caleb as we see the promised land coming
[1:20:57] in sight it's nearing the time to be
[1:21:00] given Joshua in Hebrew means Savior and
[1:21:04] represents the promised end time leader
[1:21:07] to take the church over Caleb represents
[1:21:10] the True Believer who stayed with
[1:21:14] Joshua so this is our position this is
[1:21:18] one of the positions that we must take
[1:21:22] as we see there is a spiritual
[1:21:25] background to the stand that we have to
[1:21:28] take amen and that God gives us uh these
[1:21:33] positions that we have to find that we
[1:21:37] have to take and and and then when we
[1:21:40] can see that we can identify the age and
[1:21:43] time that we're living in I'm know I
[1:21:46] know where I'm looking what I'm looking
[1:21:48] for I know what's going on because I
[1:21:51] watched the type in the shadows now
[1:21:54] brother br makes this statement in the
[1:21:56] message stand stand still
[1:21:59] 1957 and he says this here paragraph 17
[1:22:03] it's a nervous age what is it then I
[1:22:07] give this solemn warning to the church
[1:22:09] stand still God always commands to stand
[1:22:14] still before he does anything the church
[1:22:17] is is in a neurotic stage every church
[1:22:20] is prelighting and pulling and fussing
[1:22:23] and stewing it's a neurotic age but
[1:22:27] stand still now that's the message
[1:22:33] notice Caleb here the people had just
[1:22:36] come back the spies from over in the
[1:22:38] promised land there was that Cades
[1:22:40] Barney and they had been brought through
[1:22:42] many trials and had seen the hand of God
[1:22:45] a very beautiful picture of the Full
[1:22:48] Gospel Church and many of them had been
[1:22:51] discouraged discouraged and upset
[1:22:54] because so many different isms and
[1:22:56] things has happened in the church but
[1:23:00] that don't take away the real thing
[1:23:02] God's calling his church to Halt stand
[1:23:06] still don't be jumping and running not
[1:23:09] knowing what you're doing come back to
[1:23:11] the word back to Christ we see this
[1:23:15] nervous age this neura is anany can't
[1:23:20] stay settled can't stay put constantly
[1:23:24] have to be
[1:23:25] entertained it's even in our
[1:23:28] advertisements even in the commercials
[1:23:31] everything is so quick it so fast it
[1:23:33] doesn't stop it's always trying to sell
[1:23:36] you get you to move get you to buy get
[1:23:38] you to move get you to run after
[1:23:41] something and it's part of the neurotics
[1:23:44] of the age you know there's nothing
[1:23:46] going on so I should be entertained
[1:23:48] every moment of the day why don't you go
[1:23:50] out and just meditate on the Lord one
[1:23:52] time why don't you get quiet before the
[1:23:55] Lord why don't you stop talking so much
[1:23:59] as I'm looking in the mirror as I say
[1:24:01] that stop talking so much and do more
[1:24:05] listening than talking you know
[1:24:09] receiving instructions instead of always
[1:24:12] telling people what they ought to do and
[1:24:14] what they should have did and this one
[1:24:16] did it right and that one didn't get it
[1:24:17] right why don't you stand still because
[1:24:20] the age is so neurotic it's so neurotic
[1:24:24] that if you take time to and the holy
[1:24:26] spirit gives you enough gunon to move up
[1:24:29] to the altar or go down on your knees in
[1:24:31] prayer soon as you get down on your
[1:24:33] knees tell me why that Spirit wants you
[1:24:37] to get up and run and get up and go and
[1:24:40] hurry God and push God to to move on you
[1:24:44] like immediately it doesn't work that
[1:24:46] way Saints you can complain about your
[1:24:48] food not coming too fast enough you can
[1:24:51] complain about everything else not
[1:24:52] moving too fast enough but you're not
[1:24:54] going to make God move any faster than
[1:24:58] he wants to because he can't develop
[1:25:01] patience in you if he answers you every
[1:25:04] time and he's there at every moment of
[1:25:07] every hour that you feel like he should
[1:25:09] be there stand still see the salvation
[1:25:13] of the Lord let God develop what his
[1:25:16] answer is going to be to you we can't
[1:25:20] stand still long enough we you know
[1:25:22] we'll we'll you know the a service we
[1:25:26] have to get up and go get we have to get
[1:25:28] up and we have to we have to move and
[1:25:30] God is speaking many
[1:25:32] times but if the movie is good enough we
[1:25:35] ain't more going nowhere whatever we're
[1:25:37] streaming if it's a job we have our time
[1:25:40] we going to sit there because we're
[1:25:42] getting paid or whatever it is but when
[1:25:46] God is speaking and it's time for the
[1:25:48] Lord stand still Hallelujah relax
[1:25:54] you're in a hurry this one in a the age
[1:25:57] is in a hurry but God is not in nobody's
[1:26:00] hurry amen amen well I got to get this
[1:26:03] done before I'm 40 before I'm 50 I got
[1:26:05] to make sure I got to make sure my
[1:26:07] retirement I got to make sure I got to
[1:26:08] get this done before I'm 70 I got to
[1:26:09] make sure I get this done who are you
[1:26:12] serving who's in control over your life
[1:26:16] who had it all figured out before you
[1:26:18] got here and before you knew anything he
[1:26:22] had it already worked out and he wants
[1:26:25] you to rest in his arms and depend on
[1:26:29] him for
[1:26:31] everything amen it's like the Lord
[1:26:34] blesses us and then we run off from
[1:26:35] there Lord I got it from here now I'm
[1:26:37] going to stress my way all the way
[1:26:39] through Heaven the stressing ain't on
[1:26:41] you let God worry about it we're
[1:26:45] Believers and we don't always have the
[1:26:48] answer
[1:26:49] am come on
[1:26:52] somebody we got to wait on the Lord we
[1:26:56] got to be of good courage and what the
[1:26:58] psalm say and he will strengthen thine
[1:27:01] heart wait on the Lord be of good
[1:27:05] courage and he shall strengthen thine
[1:27:09] heart wait I say on the Lord that's what
[1:27:12] the Bible saying amen so these Caleb and
[1:27:17] Joshua we went through it last uh last
[1:27:20] week all of the tests and temptations
[1:27:22] they had to go through they were just
[1:27:25] alive it looked like they just made it
[1:27:29] because all of the tests all of the
[1:27:30] trials all of the others that ran off
[1:27:34] and did whatever they were
[1:27:35] doing and here J Caleb and Joshua
[1:27:39] remained
[1:27:40] alive and two were the witnesses to go
[1:27:44] over and take the promised land amen you
[1:27:47] know that's not a easy
[1:27:49] task that's not that wasn't easy for
[1:27:52] them to go against the en higher
[1:27:54] multitude you take the children of
[1:27:56] Israel 2 million people I don't know
[1:27:59] what the population of Tucson is was a
[1:28:01] million plus or something like that you
[1:28:03] take the population of Tucan times
[1:28:07] two and the groups of people and the
[1:28:10] different leaders in that group of
[1:28:13] people and here's Two Little
[1:28:17] Voices my praise the Lord that's not
[1:28:20] easy to do my brothers we can all praise
[1:28:22] the Lord when everybody is praising the
[1:28:24] Lord but who's got the grace enough to
[1:28:28] say Lord I'm coming to praise you I
[1:28:32] don't care who's sitting next to me I
[1:28:35] don't care what the church is going on
[1:28:38] I'm going to praise the Lord I'm going
[1:28:41] to lift him up I'm going to serve him
[1:28:43] till I die if everybody else leaves I'll
[1:28:46] still be standing like Joshua and like
[1:28:50] Caleb to amen yes amen glory to take
[1:28:55] that
[1:28:55] population and they stood against it
[1:28:59] they withstood all the Temptations of
[1:29:01] the others people that they knew
[1:29:03] Brothers people that were circumcised
[1:29:05] like them those that went through it you
[1:29:07] know they all saw the same thing they
[1:29:09] all heard the same tapes they heard the
[1:29:11] same message they looked at Moses just
[1:29:14] like we looked at Moses but here God
[1:29:17] kept them alive what a tremendous stand
[1:29:20] that they took and the Lord is now
[1:29:24] giving us them as a type and a shadow
[1:29:30] what's a type what's a shadow it's a
[1:29:32] recurring theme
[1:29:34] so for example you you watch any people
[1:29:38] that's suffering okay it doesn't matter
[1:29:41] where they're from or what what the race
[1:29:44] is or what the citizenship is you watch
[1:29:47] any group of people large group of
[1:29:49] people that suffer and suffer extremely
[1:29:51] through history you go back and see
[1:29:53] there's
[1:29:54] always the other side of the suffering
[1:29:58] there's characteristics that go with it
[1:30:01] and if you can open up your heart and
[1:30:03] mind you will learn something if you go
[1:30:06] back in history and you just follow
[1:30:08] people that have suffered like the
[1:30:10] children of Israel like our lord Jesus
[1:30:13] like many others Through the Bible it
[1:30:17] produces um a type and a shadow you know
[1:30:22] and I did a quick little look at that at
[1:30:25] the just the word suffering it's it's
[1:30:28] through the scriptures and the Lord
[1:30:33] places
[1:30:35] it
[1:30:37] um with not just the suffering in Romans
[1:30:40] 8 says that the
[1:30:42] sufferings are not worthy to be compared
[1:30:44] to the
[1:30:46] glory so sufferings and Glory are
[1:30:50] mentioned in the same and the say yes
[1:30:52] slavery was bad yes persecution is bad
[1:30:56] yes suffering is bad but what is it
[1:30:58] producing you see suffering and having
[1:31:03] lack of or your heart being hurt or you
[1:31:07] being disappointed as a child of God
[1:31:09] there's a purpose behind that there's a
[1:31:12] there's an anointing there's a quality
[1:31:15] trying to be developed through the
[1:31:19] suffering you we can't get it until you
[1:31:21] suffer we can't get it until you are mad
[1:31:25] and ready to give up we got to get you
[1:31:27] on an area where you don't know where
[1:31:30] tomorrow is going to hold you don't even
[1:31:32] know who your friends are you can't
[1:31:34] trust nobody nowhere and then God has to
[1:31:37] get you there to develop a
[1:31:40] characteristic in you that on the other
[1:31:43] side you can use it later in your walk
[1:31:48] with the Lord amen is true suffering
[1:31:51] Romans 8 2 Corinthians 1
[1:31:54] that our Affliction and
[1:31:57] our and all the things of the sufferings
[1:31:59] that we go through is connected to our
[1:32:03] Salvation and
[1:32:04] consolations Philippians 3 says that I
[1:32:07] may know him the power of the
[1:32:10] Resurrection The Fellowship of his
[1:32:13] sufferings being made conformable unto
[1:32:16] his death sufferings that I may know him
[1:32:19] do you want to know him yes there's
[1:32:22] sufferings amen associated with knowing
[1:32:25] him yes it is amen but the end of the
[1:32:29] fruit is that you will get to know him
[1:32:32] right Hebrews 2 says he became him for
[1:32:36] all things by whom all things and
[1:32:39] bringing many sons unto
[1:32:41] glory to make the captain of their
[1:32:43] salvation perfect through what through
[1:32:48] good
[1:32:48] times through everybody liking you to
[1:32:52] your ends being made met all the time
[1:32:55] till your plans come through the way you
[1:32:58] want it to no it's through
[1:33:00] sufferings that you are made perfect let
[1:33:03] me let me say it like this if you can
[1:33:05] praise the Lord when everything is going
[1:33:08] bad don't worry about it you'll praise
[1:33:10] him through any other
[1:33:12] time the good times we already got that
[1:33:15] praise down you going to be here during
[1:33:17] the good times we already know that
[1:33:20] you're going to keep the smile on your
[1:33:22] face and have a nice attitude through
[1:33:24] the good times we got that we want to
[1:33:26] talk to you when you're
[1:33:28] broke when nobody likes you nobody loves
[1:33:32] you you can't even get nobody to come
[1:33:34] and visit you when you're sick they
[1:33:37] don't even call to find out a check on
[1:33:39] you how you're doing huh yes yes and
[1:33:44] then during those times it develops and
[1:33:47] finds out who you are under pressure
[1:33:49] shows us who you are amen and these are
[1:33:54] some of the types and the Shadows 1
[1:33:56] Peter 1:11 says searching what or what
[1:33:59] manner of time of the spirit of Christ
[1:34:01] which was in them did signify when it
[1:34:04] testified before the sufferings of
[1:34:07] Christ and the glory that should follow
[1:34:11] praise the Lord so there's Glory that
[1:34:14] comes after The Suffering 1 Peter
[1:34:17] 4:13 1 Peter 51 goes even deeper
[1:34:23] 1 Peter 4:13 says but rejoice in so much
[1:34:26] as you are partakers of Christ
[1:34:31] what are you partakers of Christ
[1:34:34] sufferings if you are what you supposed
[1:34:36] to
[1:34:37] do
[1:34:39] Rejoice look at your neighbor and say
[1:34:42] rejoice look at them good now and tell
[1:34:45] them
[1:34:51] Rejoice you don't have a neighbor to
[1:34:54] look at is that what that was oh
[1:34:57] Hallelujah
[1:35:01] Rejoice we are fellowshipping with his
[1:35:06] sufferings I can be broke as long as the
[1:35:08] Lord is with me I can walk by myself if
[1:35:12] he's with me I can do without any kind
[1:35:15] of a friend as long as I got him with me
[1:35:18] I can
[1:35:20] Rejoice if the Lord is with me how many
[1:35:24] know what I'm talking about yes the Lord
[1:35:28] is with me he's at my right hand he said
[1:35:31] he's got my life in his hands it's
[1:35:35] already covered praise the Lord bless
[1:35:37] his wonderful name first Peter 51 the
[1:35:40] elders which are among you I exhort who
[1:35:43] am also an elder and a witness of the
[1:35:46] sufferings of Christ and also a
[1:35:50] partaker of the glory am that shall be
[1:35:54] revealed Amen brother sister whatever
[1:35:56] you're going through if you're a
[1:35:57] Believer now whatever you're going
[1:35:59] through as a Believer is some glory in
[1:36:03] this amen there's some Glory up the
[1:36:07] road
[1:36:09] Rejoice through the tests through the
[1:36:12] trials and here is
[1:36:15] Joshua and
[1:36:17] Caleb holding their position as
[1:36:21] Believers finding a position finding
[1:36:24] something to stand upon finding
[1:36:26] something to be like finding something
[1:36:30] in the word of God that can keep them
[1:36:34] through the hour of multiple
[1:36:37] Temptations glory to God we need it in
[1:36:40] this hour I need it you need it every
[1:36:45] believer needs to have something that
[1:36:48] you're standing on it can't be a Sunday
[1:36:51] morning service it can't be a group of
[1:36:54] people it can't be your bank account it
[1:36:57] can't be your youth or your health there
[1:36:59] got to be something more than that
[1:37:01] because your health will leave you your
[1:37:04] money will leave you your friends will
[1:37:07] leave you but there's a promise in the
[1:37:10] word that I shall never leave you I will
[1:37:14] never forsake you I will
[1:37:17] always be with you even until the end
[1:37:24] glory
[1:37:26] [Music]
[1:37:29] amen and there is an
[1:37:32] hour of great test and great
[1:37:35] Temptation I believe the
[1:37:38] believer and looking in the word of God
[1:37:42] he'll have to be able to get to the
[1:37:43] point where he can say this time is the
[1:37:48] time that the prophet spoke about that's
[1:37:51] what I see what's going on that's what's
[1:37:52] going on
[1:37:54] the Bible spoke of it the prophets spoke
[1:37:57] of
[1:37:58] it so I've been thoroughly
[1:38:01] warned God help me to keep my Integrity
[1:38:06] us God through the test through the
[1:38:09] trial brother sister it only gets better
[1:38:13] the Lord's got a blessing for you the
[1:38:16] Lord's got something that will overrun
[1:38:19] your cup overflow your cup can't nobody
[1:38:22] bless you the Lord can bless you if you
[1:38:25] just bless me one more time Lord I can
[1:38:29] get my praise back if you bless me one
[1:38:32] more time I get my Ministry back if you
[1:38:35] can bless me one more time lord I'll do
[1:38:39] exactly what you called me to do the
[1:38:42] Lord's got a blessing for you my brother
[1:38:45] and my sister it's in the word of God
[1:38:48] yes it is yes it is yes it is this is
[1:38:52] what Joshua and Caleb that to keep their
[1:38:55] head above all the criticism of the
[1:38:57] hour all of the
[1:38:59] foolishness all of the Temptation one of
[1:39:01] The Temptations that I've seen I don't
[1:39:04] have it here in my notes but it's
[1:39:07] this this
[1:39:09] temptation to disassociate yourself from
[1:39:13] the messenger of the day of the hour
[1:39:17] we've seen that and I've counted Moses
[1:39:20] is mentioned in the bible over 800
[1:39:24] times and in the Book of
[1:39:26] Joshua he's mentioned 58 times you'll
[1:39:29] see this name Moses continued to reoccur
[1:39:33] reapeat why is that because Moses was
[1:39:36] part of Joshua's commission and so the
[1:39:40] prophet of God takes this message as I
[1:39:42] was with
[1:39:44] Moses so I will be with thee Joshua 3 I
[1:39:50] can't think of a a more tremendous
[1:39:51] promise uh uh my my brothers my sister
[1:39:55] the Lord is telling Joshua as I was with
[1:40:00] Moses so I will be with
[1:40:04] thee now what a tremendous commission
[1:40:08] what a tremendous importance to his
[1:40:13] calling we see this that
[1:40:16] they the Lord is now establishing Joshua
[1:40:20] and we know Joshua is a type of the last
[1:40:23] day
[1:40:24] messenger he's also a type of the Holy
[1:40:27] Spirit and he's also a type of a true
[1:40:31] Ministry true Minister we use those
[1:40:35] examples and Jesus is the Supreme
[1:40:38] example is that right as a minister I
[1:40:41] got to have an example somebody to stand
[1:40:45] on and Jesus gives us that example
[1:40:49] amen and so the prophet of God goes
[1:40:52] through this in this message as I was
[1:40:55] with Moses so I will be with
[1:40:59] thee now that's a tremendous promise and
[1:41:03] we want to look at it just a little bit
[1:41:05] is that
[1:41:06] okay now this Legacy of
[1:41:10] Joshua Joshua 24:31 the elders serve the
[1:41:15] Lord even the elders that outlive Joshua
[1:41:19] all the days of the elders that saw what
[1:41:22] he was doing am there's a quotation
[1:41:24] where brother banam is comparing Joshua
[1:41:27] and Moses and he says that Moses sent 12
[1:41:30] Spies to spy out the land but Joshua
[1:41:33] only sends two to Rahab or to Jericho to
[1:41:37] spy out the land because the two when
[1:41:40] you got more people you get more
[1:41:42] opinions he also says that the officers
[1:41:46] in the church probably were smart and
[1:41:49] they gave them a hard time about
[1:41:52] Crossing Jordan when they crossed Jordan
[1:41:55] because it was a rainy season and the
[1:41:57] floods were were the waters were high
[1:42:00] doesn't make sense let's wait until the
[1:42:02] springtime let's wait till the water is
[1:42:04] down or or so forth you you you're
[1:42:07] coming at the wrong time but the
[1:42:08] commandment and the leadership of the
[1:42:10] Lord through Joshua was we're going to
[1:42:12] cross over in three
[1:42:14] days and so the leadership of the Lord
[1:42:17] doesn't always make sense in fact it's
[1:42:20] always contrary many times
[1:42:23] to what naturally would make sense he'll
[1:42:27] he
[1:42:29] uses he'll cause you to take a stand
[1:42:32] over something that's completely
[1:42:35] ridiculous and give you the the the
[1:42:38] power to give a testimony of something
[1:42:40] that's completely ridiculous Abraham and
[1:42:43] Sarah he's 100 she's 75 or 90 or 75 and
[1:42:48] they're going to have a
[1:42:50] baby and they don't have any children
[1:42:52] right now now but now you go and testify
[1:42:56] that you're going to have a son not
[1:42:58] through Hagar not through another but
[1:42:59] through your wife Sarah that you've been
[1:43:01] married with all these years if God was
[1:43:04] going to give you a baby he would have
[1:43:05] did it in the season when you were
[1:43:07] fertile when you were young in your
[1:43:09] youth why are you still holding on to
[1:43:11] that Let It Go but God is a god like
[1:43:14] that he'll give you a promise he wants
[1:43:17] to see you hold on to that promise
[1:43:20] because that promise had to go through
[1:43:21] the test of unbelief and others around
[1:43:25] you that will criticize you and see if
[1:43:28] you're gonna still hold on to his
[1:43:31] unchanging hand you know everything out
[1:43:33] there is going to change but this right
[1:43:35] here is not going to change so if you
[1:43:39] hold on to the
[1:43:40] word
[1:43:42] amen heavens and earth will pass away
[1:43:45] but the word of the Lord it always will
[1:43:50] reoccur it'll sneak up on you it'll come
[1:43:54] back into existence amen it's no book
[1:43:58] like this Bible it's written hundreds
[1:44:00] and hundreds of years ago and it's never
[1:44:03] failed when a man or a woman educated or
[1:44:08] uneducated will stand on God's word
[1:44:11] it'll defy science defy the doctor's
[1:44:14] report defy uh history defy everything
[1:44:18] if you can find a promise in God's
[1:44:21] Worden amen
[1:44:24] amen
[1:44:26] amen
[1:44:28] yes because his word is
[1:44:31] true and we stand with his word so as I
[1:44:35] was with Moses prise the Lord I'll be
[1:44:38] with you Joshua this day shall I begin
[1:44:41] to
[1:44:42] magnify thee in the sight of all Israel
[1:44:47] that they may
[1:44:49] know that as I was with Moses
[1:44:53] I'm G to be with you
[1:44:55] too now interesting what the prophet of
[1:44:58] God says
[1:44:59] here let's get into it just for a little
[1:45:05] bit so let's look at Moses just a little
[1:45:09] bit as the prophet takes in paragraph
[1:45:11] number
[1:45:11] 23 excuse me
[1:45:31] we got it there as I was with Moses
[1:45:33] paragraph number 23 but one day God
[1:45:36] heard the Cry of his people amen God
[1:45:38] remember that he had Covenant with those
[1:45:40] people not only that but he also
[1:45:42] remembered he had a servant who had
[1:45:44] called and had Chosen and he had a
[1:45:47] covenant with that servant and God will
[1:45:49] never change his Covenant or change his
[1:45:52] desire
[1:45:53] or change anything God will always keep
[1:45:56] his
[1:45:57] promises although Moses had failed him
[1:46:01] and had done that which was wrong yet
[1:46:05] God kept his Covenant when God calls a
[1:46:09] man to do something he must do it just
[1:46:13] got to do it someone asked me sometime
[1:46:16] ago sh shall we seek our gifts for our
[1:46:19] ministry some Methodist Brethren who
[1:46:21] just received the Holy Ghost I I said no
[1:46:23] don't do that when you do then God can't
[1:46:26] use you I said the only thing to do is
[1:46:29] just go ahead being a Christian if God
[1:46:32] has called you he'll place you just
[1:46:37] exactly where you
[1:46:40] belong usually those who seek and try to
[1:46:43] get things if God would give them
[1:46:46] something they be more or less be a
[1:46:48] stuffed shirt usually the man that God
[1:46:51] calls is the man that's trying to run
[1:46:54] from him if anything Moses Paul
[1:46:57] different ones trying to get away from
[1:46:58] the call but we find here that God in
[1:47:01] spite of all the failure that Moses had
[1:47:04] done he still had his hand on him Lord
[1:47:08] and he called him to go do a service
[1:47:10] called him to a commission and what a
[1:47:13] consolation that must have been to
[1:47:14] Joshua when he heard God say as I was
[1:47:17] with Moses so will I be with you praise
[1:47:22] the Lord although if I'm trying and I
[1:47:25] fail God won't leave me praise the Lord
[1:47:28] I never have much confidence in anybody
[1:47:31] that's too afraid to do anything amen
[1:47:33] I'd rather be found a failure than too
[1:47:36] lazy to try amen amen one time it was at
[1:47:40] the Ballard and Ballard FL Flower
[1:47:42] Company a Hired Man hired a man and he
[1:47:45] was going to sign his name and the man
[1:47:47] had no eraser on the end of his pencil
[1:47:49] and Mr Balor said to him says why
[1:47:52] haven't you got a an eraser he said I
[1:47:54] don't make mistakes you know there's
[1:47:56] people that think like that
[1:47:59] true that's right there are PE there are
[1:48:02] Christians ministers human beings that
[1:48:06] think they don't make no
[1:48:09] mistakes how many of you here have ever
[1:48:11] made one
[1:48:15] mistake see something wrong see so every
[1:48:18] hand somebody should have just stood up
[1:48:21] but a few people don't want to raise a
[1:48:22] hand I want make a mistake I want to
[1:48:24] witness that everybody makes
[1:48:27] mistakes huh
[1:48:30] yes you made a mistake not raising your
[1:48:37] hand so if you never had made a mistake
[1:48:39] before you just made
[1:48:41] one I don't make mistakes he says he
[1:48:44] says then I can't use you because if you
[1:48:48] make mistakes if you don't make mistakes
[1:48:50] you won't do nothing that's true God
[1:48:54] don't hold you responsible for your
[1:48:57] mistakes he holds you responsible for
[1:48:59] your willful sin he that sins willfully
[1:49:03] after he has received the knowledge of
[1:49:04] the truth but a man that's going to do
[1:49:07] something is going to blunder he's going
[1:49:09] to fall he's going to make mistakes but
[1:49:12] if he's really divinely called and God
[1:49:15] is in his heart he'll Rise
[1:49:18] Again amen all of us make mistakes all
[1:49:22] of us say things that we shouldn't say
[1:49:25] we do things that we shouldn't do we're
[1:49:28] wrong we're wrong so many times but I'm
[1:49:32] so glad the Lord doesn't hold it against
[1:49:35] us he looks at our heart he looks at
[1:49:39] what our desire is and he judges us
[1:49:42] accordingly here what the prophet says
[1:49:44] yes amen paragraph 31 I like that for
[1:49:48] any good soldier if he's apt to get
[1:49:50] wounded or hurt but if he's a if he's a
[1:49:53] still a soldier and got a purpose and
[1:49:55] something to fight for he'll rise and
[1:49:58] try again any good soldier of the Cross
[1:50:01] will do the same thing and to Joshua the
[1:50:04] new commander of the army after Moses
[1:50:07] had passed on seeing that God stayed
[1:50:10] with him in his mistakes he held his
[1:50:13] commission up prise the Lord no matter
[1:50:15] what Moses done it was Moses's office
[1:50:19] that God
[1:50:21] respected he was prophet he was above
[1:50:24] all the prophets he was really more than
[1:50:27] any Prophet they had when his own sister
[1:50:30] laughed at him for marrying an Ethiopian
[1:50:32] girl he called them together he says
[1:50:34] don't you fear God said if there be
[1:50:37] among
[1:50:38] you one who is spiritual or a prophet I
[1:50:41] will speak to him in visions and make
[1:50:43] myself known to him in dreams but it's
[1:50:46] not so with Moses I speak lip to ear
[1:50:49] with him don't you fear God see that's
[1:50:52] not a good thing to trap upon God's
[1:50:55] people you hurt him when you do so God
[1:50:59] had commissioned Moses his failures
[1:51:02] meant
[1:51:04] nothing God knowed his heart and God
[1:51:09] knows your heart my brother my sister
[1:51:14] I'm so glad if nobody else knows my
[1:51:17] heart he does he knows your heart sister
[1:51:21] he knows your heart brother amen young
[1:51:24] man he knows your heart and if in your
[1:51:27] heart you really want to serve him you
[1:51:29] really want to do what's right you
[1:51:31] really want to be pleasing to him God
[1:51:34] knows that and so we serve him that way
[1:51:39] many Christians feel so guilty and
[1:51:42] they're always guilty living under guilt
[1:51:44] all the time but go back and look at
[1:51:47] your motives and your objectives you
[1:51:49] come back you make a mistake you have a
[1:51:51] little weakness in your life or trouble
[1:51:54] in your life and you'll make a mistake
[1:51:55] you'll slip you get caught up and the
[1:51:58] issues and the problems come and then
[1:52:01] there's that old devil to come whisper
[1:52:04] in your ear that about your your faults
[1:52:07] and your failures and your mistakes
[1:52:09] he'll whisper those mistakes to you so
[1:52:11] bad you wouldn't even want to come to
[1:52:13] church you won't even want to say Amen
[1:52:16] or praise the Lord or nothing because of
[1:52:19] all of your mistakes and your faults and
[1:52:22] your failures but God looks at your
[1:52:26] heart I'm so glad he looks at the man's
[1:52:29] heart because he knows men in and out
[1:52:32] through and through and if in your heart
[1:52:36] you want to serve him he'll make a way
[1:52:39] for you to serve him yes he does he give
[1:52:42] you the grace to serve him he does he
[1:52:45] knows the heart of man sometimes the
[1:52:49] words of man can deceive many but God
[1:52:52] looks at the heart and God judges man
[1:52:55] upon the heart but the prophet says that
[1:52:58] he knew what was in Moses's heart didn't
[1:53:00] matter what he did because he knew what
[1:53:02] was in his heart Lord glory to his name
[1:53:07] Glory oh
[1:53:09] my so we see
[1:53:12] this was Joshua's
[1:53:15] example in this example now he has the
[1:53:19] Assurance to know as that God is going
[1:53:22] to be with him like he was with Moses
[1:53:25] now the prophet of God also tells us
[1:53:28] that
[1:53:31] Joshua um didn't make the mistakes that
[1:53:35] Moses
[1:53:37] made and
[1:53:39] that um he
[1:53:42] actually
[1:53:45] um was he he he did better than than
[1:53:48] what Moses
[1:53:49] did he actually succeeded in the great
[1:53:55] purpose of Abraham's Vision that we read
[1:53:57] last week that I am going to raise up a
[1:54:02] people that your seed will be in bondage
[1:54:05] for 400 years and then after the 400
[1:54:10] years I will uh deliver them with the
[1:54:14] mighty hand how many remember that that
[1:54:17] was spoken to Abraham Abram he said I'm
[1:54:20] going to bless you I'm going to bless
[1:54:22] your seed after you and years and years
[1:54:25] and years and years later your seed will
[1:54:28] multiply and they'll go down into a land
[1:54:31] and they will be afflicted by another
[1:54:35] nation and they will treat them horribly
[1:54:38] and
[1:54:39] Cru and then I'm going to deliver them
[1:54:41] with the mighty hand and then here the
[1:54:44] Great Commission is to get out of Egypt
[1:54:47] and then go over into the promised land
[1:54:50] this was the position for Joshua and
[1:54:52] Caleb so it wasn't just that God
[1:54:55] delivered them and kept them alive from
[1:54:58] all of The Temptations of the
[1:55:00] Brethren of the 10 uh temptations that
[1:55:04] they had to overcome in years of being
[1:55:08] able to resist the temptation and then
[1:55:10] going through the 40 extra years of
[1:55:13] running around in the wilderness until
[1:55:15] they died off the men of War died
[1:55:18] off and they had all of this Commission
[1:55:21] Now it wasn't just that they just
[1:55:23] survived they're just alive now they're
[1:55:26] going to go in and possess the land this
[1:55:30] was the position of the holy

[2:03:10] do it he stayed with the word God gave
[2:03:14] him the blueprint he stayed with that
[2:03:16] word he worked with that word until God
[2:03:21] begin to Vindicated years later we see
[2:03:25] that Noah was right everybody else was
[2:03:30] wrong because Noah was standing on God's
[2:03:35] word what was his word it's going to
[2:03:39] rain it's going to rain it's going to

[2:04:19] there let me slide that in everybody
[2:04:21] else is doing this so we show me the
[2:04:24] scripture where everybody else I'm
[2:04:26] supposed to follow what chapter what
[2:04:28] verse it's everybody else everybody else

[2:04:34] said they going to do believer make
[2:04:37] believer and unbeliever they're all
[2:04:42] recorded and the True Believer stays
[2:04:46] with God's word hallelujah amen glory
[2:04:50] hallelujah it's ridiculous sometimes it
[2:04:52] seems lonely huh huh but he told
[2:04:57] Joshua don't let the book leave out of
[2:05:00] your
[2:05:01] mouth stay with that original commission
[2:05:05] what was the original
[2:05:08] commission the words of
[2:05:10] Moses you got to quote him you got to
[2:05:12] bring him to the people Moses said this
[2:05:15] in the law Moses said that in the law
[2:05:19] Moses said this Moses said that prise
[2:05:22] the
[2:05:24] Lord the prophet said I'm going to get
[2:05:26] to it yes Hallelujah 58 times in the
[2:05:30] Book of Joshua we Moses is gone why
[2:05:34] Joshua still talking about Moses because
[2:05:37] those are the
[2:05:39] instructions stay with that
[2:05:43] word am if Joshua failed to do that his
[2:05:47] ministry would
[2:05:48] fail Joshua a type of the Holy Spirit a
[2:05:51] type of the last day ministry right last
[2:05:55] day
[2:05:56] believer you sisters can take Joshua as
[2:05:59] your example you don't have to be a
[2:06:00] preacher or a pastor take Joshua as your
[2:06:03] example don't turn to the right or to
[2:06:05] the left stay right with that word and
[2:06:09] there is your
[2:06:11] success
[2:06:12] amen amen you know God honored Moses's
[2:06:18] office huh can I get to that just for a
[2:06:21] little bit I'm going to close this
[2:06:24] now God honored Moses's office paragraph
[2:06:28] number 32 he says this
[2:06:33] here Glory name no matter what Moses
[2:06:37] done paragraph 33 it was Moses's office
[2:06:42] that God respected he was a prophet he
[2:06:46] was above all the prophets he was really
[2:06:48] more than prophets that he had so let me
[2:06:50] ask you this what is your office
[2:06:54] today do you know your
[2:06:56] office your office my office our office
[2:07:01] is the office of a
[2:07:04] Believer amen we're not explainers we're
[2:07:09] not make Believers we are True
[2:07:11] Believers and that's our position so
[2:07:13] what does a Believer do Believers have
[2:07:16] promises and God respects the office of
[2:07:20] his elect
[2:07:22] touch not my
[2:07:23] anointed wherever the anointing is
[2:07:25] that's where God is remember Paul pers
[2:07:28] Saul persecuting the church the Lord
[2:07:30] told him he says you're hard for you to
[2:07:32] kick against the Pricks he says who am I
[2:07:35] persecuting you're persecuting
[2:07:38] me that's me you're persecuting who is
[2:07:42] he persecuting people like you and I
[2:07:45] Believers that is your office that God's
[2:07:47] respect God doesn't respect your
[2:07:49] emotions your upset Ness your worry and
[2:07:53] all God respects you as a Believer you
[2:07:56] believe God's word you get God's
[2:07:59] attention he loves it yes he does when
[2:08:03] you put him to the
[2:08:06] test he loves it when you claim every
[2:08:11] promise when there is no evidence that
[2:08:14] it's getting any better he loves when
[2:08:17] you
[2:08:18] testify before the blessing come
[2:08:22] and you testify anyway that all is well
[2:08:27] everything is taken care of I'm already
[2:08:30] healed it's taken care of he loves
[2:08:34] it yes he does am am anybody can testify
[2:08:39] after it's done but
[2:08:42] Believers testify what the word says
[2:08:45] about the situation amen amen amen
[2:08:50] hallelujah God bless
[2:08:52] you one last little portion I want to
[2:08:55] get here this is on the commission of
[2:08:59] Joshua this is the this is the
[2:09:03] importance of his
[2:09:06] commission paragraph 37 now Joshua the
[2:09:08] new Warrior only two left now that ever
[2:09:11] left the promised land that was Joshua
[2:09:14] and Caleb now Joshua the new Commander
[2:09:17] to lead an army to step into the place
[2:09:20] where great man like Moses
[2:09:22] stood it was no little
[2:09:26] task and think of a minister today
[2:09:30] that's called of God to step into the
[2:09:32] tracks where Jesus
[2:09:34] stood what a command what a commission
[2:09:39] but each that's called of God is
[2:09:43] commissioned to stand in the same in
[2:09:46] that same place I'll be with you even in
[2:09:52] you to the end of the way each minister
[2:09:56] is called to stand where he did so so so
[2:10:01] we ain't calling up other people to find
[2:10:03] out where we supposed to stand no my
[2:10:06] position in my stand is in God's
[2:10:11] word same for
[2:10:14] you stand in the tracks each minister is
[2:10:17] the ordained of God it's commanded to
[2:10:20] stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and
[2:10:23] perform the duties that Jesus performed
[2:10:27] that's quite a command is it yes it
[2:10:33] is you can't do this on the side this is
[2:10:37] your life
[2:10:39] now we have to do the
[2:10:42] impossible is that right yes we have to
[2:10:45] call on
[2:10:48] God
[2:10:50] right we we have to believe he's going
[2:10:52] to do
[2:10:54] it we have to believe it's already
[2:10:56] done
[2:10:58] uhhuh you got to demand of
[2:11:03] God you have to call on
[2:11:06] him
[2:11:08] amen
[2:11:11] yes let's take this here in uh the
[2:11:14] second-handed robe then give it to you
[2:11:15] but it's 1956 a second-handed robe
[2:11:18] paragraph
[2:11:20] 113 and and my brother don't you be
[2:11:24] afraid to ask God
[2:11:28] anything we got to get this up here
[2:11:30] because we're G to read it together in a
[2:11:32] minute and my brother paragraph don't be
[2:11:35] afraid to ask God anything you must
[2:11:37] demand God or ask God for anything that
[2:11:41] he has promised for if I am introducing
[2:11:44] in a God that's omnipotent and all
[2:11:47] powerful and if I be a servant of God I
[2:11:49] must do the work works of God and if I
[2:11:53] do the works of God I must demand of God
[2:11:58] to bring these things to pass because
[2:12:02] he's demanding of me to produce the
[2:12:07] impossible I have to ask him I have to
[2:12:10] call upon him and stand there and say
[2:12:13] God you promised
[2:12:16] it so do you every person
[2:12:22] God you promised it you promised it
[2:12:26] Lord you promised
[2:12:28] [Music]
[2:12:30] it to do the
[2:12:32] impossible I've got to have God give it
[2:12:35] to meu so that I can complete the
[2:12:40] task getting all these people to cross
[2:12:43] over into their Ministry and place them
[2:12:47] in their position was Joshua's
[2:12:50] tremendous task
[2:12:52] he had that task to do and he did a very
[2:12:54] fine job didn't he Joshua was no
[2:13:00] joke there's a lot of people playing
[2:13:02] around playing church but not Joshua
[2:13:05] there probably a lot of foolishness you
[2:13:06] couldn't run by him either huh and the
[2:13:10] elders that serve with him what a legacy
[2:13:14] praise the Lord what a
[2:13:17] Ministry and we see the type
[2:13:21] we see the
[2:13:23] Shadow and here is the day we're
[2:13:25] supposed to live
[2:13:28] it that's the shadow what's it reflected
[2:13:32] upon right 2102 East Broadway right on

[2:13:38] Pew take that shadow of the Old
[2:13:40] Testament and it's pointing right at you
[2:13:44] brother
[2:13:45] sister don't try to pass it off on
[2:13:47] nobody else it's talking God's demanding
[2:13:49] of you to get the task done to get the
[2:13:52] job
[2:13:54] done Joseph got the job done didn't he
[2:13:57] Abraham got the job done Daniel got the
[2:14:00] job done job got the job done the Old

[2:14:07] about
[2:14:09] uslu what about us are you getting it
[2:14:13] done Lord say yes I'm getting it done by
[2:14:16] his grace My Confession that was the
[2:14:19] shadow what the shadow reflect ref in
[2:14:22] on it's not just Bible stories in Sunday
[2:14:26] school it's reflecting on you you have
[2:14:29] to demand God to get the impossible done
[2:14:33] in your
[2:14:34] life there's nothing too hard for
[2:14:39] God Joshua commanded the son to stand
[2:14:42] still didn't he yes he called on God
[2:14:48] well Moses never did that no one else no
[2:14:50] Joshua did it called the son to stand
[2:14:54] still I'm in the battle I need more time
[2:14:58] stand still I'm doing something for the
[2:15:00] Lord and this is all in my way stand
[2:15:02] still that's what he did Joshua the
[2:15:05] believer
[2:15:08] huh
[2:15:10] yes he'll do it for you too he'll get
[2:15:13] you to get the impossible done God bless
[2:15:16] you so much thank the Lord for his
[2:15:18] goodness to usj as we just highlight a
[2:15:21] little bit of the life of Joshua for you
[2:15:25] and I to find our position and stand as
[2:15:28] a
[2:15:29] Believer right we find that place don't
[2:15:33] we it's so nice to know our season and
[2:15:36] our time and we have to be able to say I
[2:15:40] believe we can say this is that day that
[2:15:44] the prophet spoke about remember the day
[2:15:46] of
[2:15:48] Pentecost the spokesman Peter said
[2:15:51] this is
[2:15:53] that that Joel talked about so what did
[2:15:56] he do there was something taking place
[2:15:57] today and he went back and picked up the
[2:16:00] prophecy of Joel that's what you and I
[2:16:02] do today yes the prophet talked about it
[2:16:06] no so we can talk think about it in 1965
[2:16:09] or 1963 or the ad or BC it's so where
[2:16:13] does it reflect today yes this is what
[2:16:17] the prophet talked about that's why I'm
[2:16:19] standing the where I'm standing the
[2:16:21] prophet told me to the shadows and the
[2:16:23] types don't fail brother random says you
[2:16:26] watch the Shadows you watch the types
[2:16:28] they don't fail there's always been
[2:16:30] crazy folks in our midst it's always
[2:16:32] been unbelievers always been people
[2:16:34] getting persecuted there always the
[2:16:35] wrong suffering or the right suffering
[2:16:38] for the wrong that's always been there
[2:16:40] they treat you right they're unfair to
[2:16:42] you they lied on you they to on you they
[2:16:45] stole from you it's all through the
[2:16:47] Bible it's happened and it will continue
[2:16:50] to happen
[2:16:51] what kind of position are you going to
[2:16:53] take as a Believer
[2:16:55] though Joseph kept his Integrity through
[2:16:58] all that he went through they lied on
[2:17:02] him they accused him of things that was
[2:17:04] horrible they sold him into slavery
[2:17:08] because he had dreams they did all this
[2:17:10] and he stayed with it he stayed with it
[2:17:12] he stayed with it and it looked like he
[2:17:14] probably wanted to give up no doubt he
[2:17:17] wanted to give up but he didn't give up
[2:17:19] did he and God was looking at him all
[2:17:21] the time and God said I'mma turn it
[2:17:24] around and when God turns it around he
[2:17:27] turns very well he knows how to turn the
[2:17:32] situation very well and those that were
[2:17:35] hating him and those that were
[2:17:37] criticizing him are now looking to him
[2:17:40] for
[2:17:42] salvation if Joseph
[2:17:44] fails everybody else fails but because
[2:17:49] Joseph kept his
[2:17:51] Faith he was able to save his daddy his
[2:17:55] family his Brethren Lord Egypt Pharaoh
[2:17:59] everybody was blessed because of this
[2:18:02] one man if you get your position right
[2:18:05] everybody in your job will be grateful
[2:18:07] everyone in your family everything
[2:18:09] around you your
[2:18:11] neighborhood the birds flying over your
[2:18:14] house will be
[2:18:16] blessed because the blessing of the Lord
[2:18:19] is upon you you walk outside the

[2:33:37] field would you
[2:33:39] go would you go to the streets and
[2:33:42] witness the
[2:33:44] gospel would you go the extra mile if he
[2:33:47] called you to
[2:33:49] know that's a song but it's a very it
[2:33:52] can be a very
[2:33:55] um that's a commitment
[2:33:57] song you said if if you call me I will
[2:34:01] answer if you call me I will go and many
[2:34:05] times you'll call but we don't want to

[2:34:35] your
[2:34:37] heart he deals with your heart it might
[2:34:40] not make sense it might be the wrong
[2:34:42] time it might be inconvenient to you you
[2:34:44] might think it's supposed to happen this
[2:34:45] way but if he calls you in your heart
[2:34:49] that that is the Lord Jesus that's how
