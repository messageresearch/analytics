tonight amen that's our prayer amen we're going to listen to a portion of the message here uh Church order we listen to the one in 1958 this was preached in 19 uh 63 I believe the end close to the end of the year and um brother random will take part of that message tonight and I think it's going to be a blessing to all of us it it's always a groundwork for what the Church of the Living God should look like and I know every church is Sovereign and maybe our song service might go a little bit longer or we might not have two songs or three songs we might conduct ourselves you know as we grow in the Lord and what we need and what um we have available but this is uh what the prophet put on the tape that he believed was the way the Church of the Living God should be operated amen so we heard that in 58 and this is five or six years later after the Tabernacle was rededicated he had already preached the seals and here he's bringing Church order again and so as we prepare to go there um let's sing only believe before we do let's read a scripture and that would be found in 1 Corinthians chapter 14 like to welcome you all to the house of the Lord so good to see each of you and those that had to travel and you made it back safely God bless you amen 1 Corinthians chapter 14 and this is the Apostle Paul speaking verse 37 If any man think himself to be Prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant wherefore Brethren covet not to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues let all things be done decently and in order amen and and one of the messages the church order messages you know the Apostle Paul said the things that I write our Commandments one of the church orders brother bam says you let this tape be an absolute to you and you go back to this tape and so it's not the so much the writings of brother Brandon but the word the voice of God In Our Generation so we like to go to that tonight if it's ready I don't know if it's ready if I don't see the uh deal on the screen there amen praise the Lord and so let's sing only believe all things are possible oh only Bel only believe all things are possible only believe only believe only Liv all things are possible only I like to make [Music] a lord I believe let's lift our hand all things are possible Lord our I believe you I believe your word I believe it Lord Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe God bless you may be seated brother brandham you be ready to turn them off now I motion my head to you like that pleas my motion my head to you [Music] you Brethren we' called this meeting together here tonight for the purpose of knowing how that to operate the Church of the Living God which we believe to be a part of this church I want to first thing I want to say that in my travels around the world so far as I know this is one uh of the most spiritual places where you feel the spirit of God more than any other place I know I had two other places in mind it used to be but so far we we don't uh seem to see those places one of them has went into the organization and the other has U has kind of fallen so uh I was called yesterday and was has told me that you all want a meeting to ask me these questions concerning your duties in this church and I um that's what I'm here for tonight is in to to set the church or to give to you the things that I think that that is what's substantial to make this church to continue on Brethren I'm sure that you do realize that is I've made this remark about uh this being a spiritual place it isn't the biggest place in the world and it isn't what we have the most singing the most screaming and the most hollering or the most speaking in tongues and things that isn't it but it's the quality of the spirit that's operates here in this Tabernacle and so far I want to command and thank brother Neville and and you Brethren here trustees and deacons and Sunday school superintendent and all for for what you have done and helping keeping this us away it's been a long prayer a mind and a desire s a boy to see the church put in order and kept in order now we dedicated the church I told you a little later I had something to talk to you about how to set this thing in order the way it should be run and um you started off uh after leaving here we had ministers and so forth but now brother Neville being just young Among Us come Among Us I thought it'd be better for brother Neville to get better established in the faith before I presented such things as I'm about to do now but now after I find out that he is uh getting well established in the faith and understands what the doctrine is and and has uh played the part of a faithful witness to Christ and holding for what we believe to be the truth I think it's the hour now would be a good time to approach him and among you elders and things for the church that you would take these orders and remember them they're the best of my knowledge before God and then I'm looking to you to carry these things out the way that I'm saying because somebody has to be a head around here you have to have now I'm not trying to assur Authority or something like that but you see a man or anything with two heads to it it it doesn't know how to go God never did have two heads to his church he never did it's one head he always dealt in every generation as we've studied through the scriptures there's always one individual that he deals with because you get two men you got two opinions it's got to come to one final absolute and my absolute is the word the Bible and as a pastor here of the church my absolute is the word and I I know you are brothers you kind of look to me to be your absolute to what as long as I follow God as Paul said in the scripture you follow me as I follow Christ and then I'd expect you Brethren at any time that you see me to get away from this scripture to come to me privately and tell me or I'm wrong I don't care if you're one of the truste if you're the janitor whoever you are your duty bound to me as a brother in Christ to tell me when I'm wrong scripturally if it's a question let's sit down and solve it out together that's why you've come I suppose to me tonight brought me in here is because that there's questions here that seems to be questioning you in your mind for the things that I have have here I remember Brethren I don't know there's no name signed on any of these tickets but and they wrote and I can't don't know who wrote them but their questions that's on your mind and I'm here to answer them the best of my knowledge and remember God is looking to me to see that I stay in the word and I'm looking to you to see that you carry out the word see in this church and keep it spiritual for remember all the forces of of the dark kingdom of Satan will be turned against you as you begin to grow and the Lord and you must be soldiers not just fresh recruits you're age soldiers now have been trained to fight and Satan will come among you cause you to dispute with one another if you can turn him down just immediately you're Brethren and it's the enemy and we're here to hold a standard in this evening light time that when the world is darken and the whole church kingdom is going into the Council of churches and pretty soon they'll try to tack a sign on this door here closed then we're going to have to meet other places because they'll certainly close these churches one of these days if we don't take the mark of the beast and uh we're depending on staying true to god Till Death sets us free and that's what we we intend to do now straight to the and I would ask that if ever a time that any of these things come into question that this tape may be played before the members of this church at your meetings or prayer of the meeting just before the meeting starts turn this tape on and play it and may the congregation here understand that these men are Duty bound to God is their oath in this church to help hold these principles you may disagree with them and if I let you run it then I disagree with you we've got to have some Source somewhere where there's got to be an ultimate and best that I know I'm giv it under the Holy Spirit letting him be my ultimate and let this tape be your ultimate on these questions now the first one is how shall the church act towards calls for financial help uh uh for food and clothing what what act what what should the church do now we realize that the church is responsible for its own for our members here of the church we are totally responsible as far as we have needs to supply them with we are respons responsible for our own that's steady constant members of the Tabernacle come here and worship with us we are Duty bound to them as our brothers and sisters who have proven to be our members of this Gathering now we realize that there is millions tonight without food without clothing and we would love to be able to help the whole group of them to do everything we could but financially we cannot do that that we can't support all the world but we are Duty bound to our own and I think in that and then if we have anything left over that you would want to contribute to people who are not members here of this church something that you want to give to them it should be met between the the board of the deacons the deacons is the one that that has to meet this opposition or this problem rather because that in the Bible when the dispute come up about food and clothing and so forth in the book of Acts they call the apostles in about it they said go look out for yourself uh seven man of honest report and full of the Holy Ghost that they might attend to these things because we will give ourselves continually to the word of God and in prayer and it isn't the pastor's duty to look out to the for the food and so forth that's supposed to be by the deacons it isn't the trustees it is the Deacon's office to do this and then this should be remember in the Bible they was contributing to their own the Greeks and the and the Jewish where the argument come up that one was getting a little more than the other but it was people who had sold all their goods and given into the church for its support and then to to be divided out among them equally and there was a little dispute come up and there's where we got our first deacons and that's one of their duties is to do that I think that as our own as our own people uh we should take care of them and it should be turned in any complaint to the chairman of the deacon board and then it should be met by the Deacon board and see what they are able to do about it and all of those things which is clothing and food and financial help or whatever it is should come through the deacons then the deacons when they decide that they are that they are what they're going to do about it then it should be presented then unto the uh the treasure to see if the treasure is able at this time to pay this certain amount of Finance or or buy these clothing or whatever it is to that but the the Deacon board should meet on that and it doesn't go to the trustees or to the pastor it's a Deacon's thing alog together now then question number two is it s sufficient to say openly from the pulpit that tongues and interpretations should be done in a meeting before the service that's the second question on this uh slip of paper that I have here which is a little card now this would be uh pertaining to the pastor here see because he after all over the spiritual part he's the head of that deacons are a policeman in the church to keep order and to take care of these things and feeding the poor and so forth the trustees are over the finance in the building that's what they are to look at but the pastor is over the the supervising of the spiritual part and this would go to you brother Neville now there some time ago when the uh order was set the church uh I do believe in speaking in tongues and interpretation and all the fine spiritual gifts that's ordained of God to be in the church but we are living in a day just like it was in the Bible time where the church churches now you notice Paul he founded the church at Ephesus the Ephesian Church which is a well-established Church did you notice we believe that Paul and did say so himself that he spoke with many tongues and we know that he had gifts of tongues not ones that he had learned but those who were spiritually given to him because how he speaks it in Corinthians there and the same time I'm not just turning in the Bible and reading it for you because it would make our our stay here too long tonight as I don't have too much time and now but just so that you could openly see now uh Paul never one time had to speak to the Ephesian church or to the Roman church or any of those other churches about their spiritual gifts about how to put them in order but he did have to speak to the Corinthians continually about it because they made it an issue all the time and Paul said when he come among them if uh they found found out one had a tongue and one had a Psalm and he thanked the Lord for all their fine gifts and things like that and if you notice in the first chapter or two of Corinthians Paul was telling positionally what they were in Christ how he they were positionally in Christ and after he told him L like a father he be to let the whip down on him and say I hear there contentions among you and I hear that you get drunk at the Lord's table he didn't UNC christianize them and don't you Brethren do that un christianizing but it's the way they're behaving themselves in the house of God that's where it say now I would say this that as Paul of old said that when you come together if one speaks let another uh interpret there be no interpreter then hold your peace but if there be an interpreter I've watched The church here and I've seen you grow up I've seen many spiritual gifts operating among you frankly one I had to come brother Nev about with a word from the Lord to correct him on something that he was doing and if I if the Lord is the Holy Ghost is made me an overseer of the flock then it's my duty to tell you the truth and I'm very grateful for brother Neville he heeded to the truth I can only say it as he tells me now on this as I noticed your church growing and noticed it and in the church here's the way we had it first and this is the way we we want it again now if you don't watch when babies the first thing a baby does is try to talk when he can't talk he makes a lot of bubble and noise and and so forth but he thinks he's just he can out talk the preacher at that time well we find that not only in the natural life but we find that in the spiritual life also it's a little one and if you try to correct that baby and spank him a little bit because he gooing and trying to talk you you'll ruin the child and you'll hurt him and it's best to let that baby grow a little while until he actually can speak his words right and then tell him when not when Papa's talking or When Mama's talking but when it's appropriate time let him have his say do you understand me now let him talk when his time comes to talk now if I've ever had anything that's been a thorn in my flesh out in the meeting is someone to rise up when speaking and then give a message in tongues and break the spirit I've just come out of a meeting in New York and different places to where ministers let that go on time after time and it's nothing but but a confusion see when God is dealing in one line of thought he it would be it would he would be defeating his own purpose if he's trying to get a line of thought to you to the congregation to make an altar calling something bu him for instance like this we're sitting at the table talking and we're talking uh about the Lord and Junior runs into the table real quick takes all the attention away from what we're doing and hollers scream out dad mom m my I just hit a home run down the team and we doing all this that and the other and when we were right on a real right down sacred subject now him hitting a home run that's all right at the baseball game that's all right but he's out of order when he breaks in on the message that we're talking about let him wait till his time comes and then tell us what he did at the baseball game now that's just the same thing we find with gifts today that's the reason God cannot trust too many spiritual gifts with people they don't know how to control them that's what's the matter today the reason we don't have no more than we do and we do find there's a lot of impersonation of spiritual gifts but I don't believe that's so here in our church I'm thankful for that I don't believe it's an impersonation at all I believe we have genuine gifts but we must know how to control those gifts then when you go to doing something good just like you working for a boss and you start out on the first year job and you're willing to take orders then the boss has confidence in you and will keep raising you up to a higher office all the time now I believe that time has struck the brandom Tabernacle to know what to take the gifts that God gives us that God can trust us with something even greater and what we have got but we cannot uh go along and you see a man that's always have to be tell him and everything and remember the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophet says the scripture when you see a man that you have to correct or a woman and that person gets out of order and then you're telling them the scriptural truth then it shows that the spirit that's on them isn't of God because the Bible said the spirit of the prophets are prophesying that's testifying preaching speaking in tongues or whatever it is C tongues interpreted is prophecy so it's subject to the prophet and the word is the prophet so we we see that it's out of order for a man or woman to jump up and give a message no matter how much they want to do it while the preacher is in the pulpit now I suggest this for the brandom Tabernacle that being that our our gifts that we find and we have some very fine gifted people here now each one of those gifts are a Ministry of their own they are gifts just like preaching is a gift like healing is a gift like other things are gifts these are gifts they are ministries of Their Own and each man is commanded to wait on his own Ministry therefore let the brandom Tabernacle be operated like this and in the day especially this day when we've had so much um I don't want to say this but so much make belief we don't want make belief no man no honest person wants to have a make belief we if we don't can't have the real let's not have any at all let's wait till we do get the real I believe you you man would agree with that we don't want nothing make believe brethren we can't start on make believe something and leave in this world we got to have what's real what's genuine if we haven't got it let's wait till we do get it then say something about it see now I would say let all these men and women who speak in tongues and prophesy and give messages and I I'm believing with you man if they are genuine now the Bible has said prove all things and hold fast to that what's good for with stammer lips and other tongues will I speak to this people this is the rest that I said that they should enter into over in the book of Isaiah now I would suggest this so that the sanctuary will only be ministered by one gift at a time for it brings it straight back in order again what I'm trying to say if one Speaking let the spirit of the prophets be subject to the prophet do you understand now let those who have a Ministry to the body of Christ and now it's being said now let it be done let those who have a Ministry to the body of Christ wait on their Ministry because it is a Ministry from Christ to the church but you can't all Minister the same time there's got to be one at a time the brandom Tabernacle should be like this let those who speak with tongues and those who interpret tongues and those have prophecy that's to be given to the church let them come among themselves early in the before the meeting starts let them Gather in an appointed room and wait on the ministry of the Lord as the pastor has to do himself before he comes into the audience he must take the Bible study in the quietness of his room in the spirit and be anointed to come out before the audience to speak if he doesn't he's going to be confused when he gets out there let each man and each woman with a spiritual gift come before the Lord and being that the pastor has a single Ministry he is a prophet the English word a preacher means a prophet that's a fourth tell of the word let those who have Ministries that has to be part of someone else like one to speak with tongues and another to interpret they wait together on their Ministry they cannot stay in a private study and speak in tongues and then come tell the other what he said because because he to have both tongues and interpretation now if he has that very well we want it to receive it like that and we want the church to benefit by these gifts that's in our church God sent them to us and it's we want our church to benefit by these spiritual gifts so let the man who speaks with tongues and the one who interprets and the one who prophesies let them come together before before the the church ever meets let them meet in a room to themselves waiting on the ministry of the Lord to the church is it understood and then like this if brother Neville say well I let me pardon me let me say this if brother Collins speaks with tongu and brother Hickerson gives the interpretation then they have a Ministry together for the church now that isn't the ministry of brother naille that's your ministry to the church I'm giving this as example then you Brethren should be just as interested in getting your ministry in the place in the house of God as a pastor is interested in getting his because it's just essential that you do it but you can't do it in the privacy of your own room if you speak and you interpret you've got to come together now come together in the church off in a room to yourself because you have a private Ministry it's not an openly Ministry it's one that's to help the church see it's something to help the church but it isn't to be done in the main congregation only the way I'm going to tell you it is to be done see then whatever brother Collins speaks and brother Hickerson gives the interpet ation as example then let brother uh somebody write this down what it is and then if it's coming now we all know that the Lord is coming we're aware of that and if brother Neville got up each night and said behold the Lord is coming behold the Lord is coming that would be all right see but he's saying that the pastor at the platform for for he's got the word for that and if he be a pastor Prophet to the church or Pastor rather he's to study the word of the Lord and tell you what's written in the word of the Lord about the coming of the Lord and you're warned by that a Ministry otherwise to the church which he wouldn't have any connection with is tongues interpretation of tongues which is prophecy or a prophet speaking that's something is not written in the word what's written in the word he's to bring it but what's not written in the word is what you're to tell him like for instance uh tell um brother wheeler thus sayeth the Lord tomorrow in his sandpit not to go to it because you'll be a truck turnover or something like that it's got to be done and you've spoken and he's interpreted and then lay that on the platform after your ministry is finished the other night after the church the hymn starts singing and so forth if your Ministries finished then let them come forth with what prophecy has been given and I do not think that we have or if you do put this in there when these people meet together let them who have wisdom first come because you see if one speaks in tongues and gives an interpretation according to scripture that cannot be received unless it be uh witnessed by two or three people two or three more witnesses see has to witness to that that they believe it to be the word of the Lord because sometimes in these minor Ministries just like in any other Ministry you get Spirits that's wrong see they'll fly in there and we don't want that no we want these Ministries ready to be exposed if they to be exposed because anything of God can don't worry about exposing it it'll it'll stand the test if it's of God it's like the pastor if somebody challenges him on the word he don't have to back up about it you know it's just exactly what he's talking to come on up here see and same as these other Ministries got to be the same way now if if one speaks in tongues and gives a message now some people speak in tongues when they're just edifying themselves the Bible say they just have a good time to speak in tongues they feel and they do speak in tongues they actually speak with tongues and it's the spirit doing it but if it's sitting out there in the audience of speaking in tongues just edifying themselves then it isn't any profitable thing for the church the man's edifying himself or the woman or whoever is doing it see to speak in tongues as a gift of God to edification as Paul says in the scripture that it's to edify the church so it had to be some direct message from God to the church outside of what's wrote here in the Bible see it's something if you could ask me brother brandom uh how must I be baptized I can tell you right quick you don't have to speak in tongues and tell me that it's wrote right here in the Bible what to do about that see I don't have to you don't have to ask ask no questions on that have somebody speak in tongues and tell you see that's already written but if you say brother Brandon uh what must I do I've got a decision here I've got to make whether I should U uh take this church or go to another church or something like that or should I do this now that have to come from God see God has to tell us that but that would have to come to another Ministry because the word don't say let arm and nille leave brandom Tabernacle and go to the Fort wi gospel t Tabernacle see they don't say that in the word here see so that's what these gifts are for like a person come up here and say you believe in Divine Healing we preach that we believe it we believe in nor and the all but here some man says he can't get through what's the matter then it takes God through tongues interpretation through prophecy or some way to go down in that man's life and pull out that thing that he's done and tell him about that's a Ministry that doesn't belong to the pastor it belongs to these ministering gifts but they're not to be done out there in the audience see now Paul and remember one time had to tell those tell those Ephesian Church anything about that they were in order the Roman church or none of those other churches only the Corinthian Church and they never could get themselves now Paul believed in speaking in tongues he had speak in tongues in the Ephesian church as same as he did in the Corinthian Church see but he could speak to the Ephesians greater things than what just speaking in tongues interpretive Tong now then if someone writes a message that's been given in tongues or given in Prophecy and laid upon the platform it must be read by the pastor before the service starts of thus sayeth the Lord from these people who spoke and interpreted and if that comes to pass exactly the way the interpretation said we raise our hands and give thanks to God for his Spirit among us if it doesn't come to pass then don't do it anymore to that evil spirit's out of you God don't lie he's always truth then you see you're old enough now to act like man not children goo goo goo you got to have some meaning to something Let the church now is is coming in order come to this order if one prophesy if one come among you unlearned and you speak in tongues you'll be a barbarian to him you don't know what you're talking about see and really in this day where there's been so much confusion about it it causes a stumbling BLX but let one speak in tongues and another interpret and give the message and let it be read off right here at the platform of what's going to take place and then let it happen and see what happens tell them at tomorrow at a certain time or next week at a certain time it's going to be a certain thing then let the unbeliever sitting there listen to that and see it's foretold before it happens then they'll know what kind of spirit's among you it'll be God's spirit that's what Paul said then if one can prophesy and reveal the secret things won't the whole congregation fall down to the unbeliever and say God is in the midst of you see because it cannot be but now we don't what when we was a child Paul said I acted like a child he told the Corinthians there I spoke like a child he had a child mind but when I become an adult I put childish things away now I'm telling you all see now a few years ago you were children with these gifts playing back and forth but you've been to a long school now it's time to be man not use these just to play with these gifts are sacred they're of God and you don't play with them let's let God use them that's what your ministry wants to be that's the way to put the brandom Tabernacle in the service and and if this is question anytime let this tape stand as a witness that's the way it's to be done in the brandom Tabernacle if there would be a stranger come in CU you have them all the time because this been an inter denominational Tabernacle there's people come in that doesn't have this well training they don't have it they don't know better in their own pastors they'll jump right up and break his message up and tear Al or call up and speak in tongues and everything like that you're a better trained man in that see then after the service if he gets unruly then it's a Deacon's place to go to them don't let your pastor have to do it let it comes to a spot where no Deacon here but a deacon is supposed to see to that see now after the service if the person just raises up and gives a message the pastor if he wants to stop just a minute go ahead very well see that's up to the pastor but then immediately let the Deacon before that person gets out of the building take them to one side and talk to them about and if they question it bring him to this tape and say this is what the bishop or the overseer of the church which is Bishop the any overseer that's what it's called in the Bible Bishop PR see so that's General overseer of the church let this is the arst and way our church does it now we love for you come give your a message but if you've got a message from the Lord and it's let it be given come up here and lay it on our platform and our Minister will read it to the congregation a message to this congregation but it must not be just repeating scriptures and things like that it must be a direct message to the people of something that's fixing to take place or something they should do is it understood all right now is there any better way to keep order in the church than to uh keep uh reminding the people uh with a uh repeat from the deacons accordingly no that I've just explained that that's question number three the deacons your duty is to keep order in the church with kindness friendliness and then you are supposed to if someone gets out of order in the church or comes in here like a drunk or somebody com in like the shot that Minister out of the platform other night up there you heard about that that drunk coming in with a double barrel shotgun scream for his wife and and wanted wife and went up towards the pastor and and the pastor showed him his wife sitting there but he's going to shootter right in the church and the pastor started dealing with him and instead of uh in instead of the U uh the man with the shotgun turned around and shot the pastor out of the pull pit and then shot his wife and then shot himself now if there been a bunch of deacons there when that man entered that door that shotgun that had their arms around the shotgun out of his hand see see that's that's orderly deacons and now these things have gone the way they're doing now you might can just expect anything but remember the deacons are God's policemen in the house of God no matter what anybody else thinks sometimes a policeman won't have to go and make arrest on somebody maybe one of his friends but he swore into an office he's got to do it anyhow that's his duty to his City see that's the duty of a deacon to the church and U if uh someone jumps up and starts interrupting the pastor or something know like that and a pastor in his message the Deacon's supposed to walk up to them people two or three of them say could we speak to you brother see bring him from the church out into the office in here or some other office and speak to him about it say you not to interrupt you know it's a it's a great fine by the law to interrupt a service anyhow see but some people such as a delinquent person or something come among you know and and some religious fanatic and and start carrying on then the deacons and if and if the deacons don't seem to be able to control it then the trustee board or anyone else in the church can step up and give help to such a person you know and um and now let me ask the question again here is there any better way to keep order in the church than to re remind the people with a repeat from the deacons now occasionally now I think that the the pastor ever so often or play this tap let that stand for a witness deacons are policemen and their word is Law and Order and they have the authority from the church and even from the laws of the nation to make that house of God be the right place and anyone to contro a deacon like that is subject to two to 10 years in federal prison if you tell them to go and they don't do it or something like that somebody with dis orderly conduct you just don't don't know what he's doing to he's subjecting himself relive on himself to all kinds of fines anything and then if it comes to a spot at somebody and I like and somebody jumps up and get this arly just maybe speak in tongues or something I wouldn't go in on that see let them go because if they're stranger if there are own people then just let the next night you deacons just get this tape and say now we're going to play the orders of the church before we start the service I want everybody to understand it you pastors and you all can work together like that now brother brandham what about the Sunday School um brother Bram about the Sunday School all right should it be before the preaching service yes we've always had it that way have the Sunday school before the preaching service and um that gives a chance for the little fellas who attend Sunday school to dismiss their classes and if and if they want the little fellas don't understand it they have to sit all the way through the preaching service and then have Sunday school the little fell are wore out let the Sunday School be first have a set time just at one set time that Sunday school goes to session Sunday school superintendent is supposed to see that at this Sunday school goes to session at a certain time set time and it's dismissed at a certain time all the Sunday School allow so much time for that then dismissed should the teacher for the adult class be someone other than the pastor if it's so agreed if the pastor wants to teach the Sunday school and then bring the message later that's fine and dandy if he wants to do the double service but if he doesn't then have your adult Sunday school teacher see for your Adult class and then if U if the uh Pastor uh has somebody else there in mind and the person wants to do it give yourself 30 minutes or whatever you go to allow your Sunday school for 30 or 35 40 minutes whatever it is and there should be a bell set your and when that Bell is tapped that means or either the church bell when it Taps on the outside that's dismissing Sunday school and when that bell rings that mean everything come to order right there there' be so much time then for a hym or two whatever you to sing not too much time you wear the people out but keeping them too long see and U just tap the Bell have a hymn and whatever you're going to do and then send your classes to the place and immediately when that time comes say it's going to be at at 10:00 or 10:30 or 10:15 whatever it is tap that Bell and ever teacher dismisses her class come to the audience out here and then and give the report Sunday school report and then dismiss the whole thing and let all that wants to stay for preaching service be next and it's an AR questions how many you mean have a spit class in other words oh yes you should have a three-year-old can't understand what a 14year old would understand I think I got that a little farther how many classes should there be you should put your classes and like a little bitty class that wants to have flannel graph that's too much for a 14-year-old boy or girl you should have a someone to take a class for those little babies some old mother or something who knows how to take care of other classes I think U should be uh somebody who's more uh able to present the word see and uh there should be classes to say now they be like a class of from the at least three classes there should be a little bitty baby class there should be from about 5 years old and all the others under that should be kept with a mother and taking in the nursery if necessary during the time of the preaching if they go carrying on that's what the nurser is out there for and I think that the the classes should be range from like the little babies about five or six years old up to eight or nine 10 something like that and then from 10 years old on to 15 should be in the teenage class and and then the adult class over at 15 because they if they're old enough to nowadays they can get a job and they're want them to vote at that age almost so they they should be able to hear the word but come out in the main Auditorium and have that uh who should be the teachers there you are that's up to you to bolt your own teachers in and you ought to do that put them in there get somebody and meet with the church and say uh who's uh who here feels LED of the Lord and then get a qualified teacher and then let it be done it's got to be strictly business brother if the teacher can't qualify to it then change teachers when the time comes is under God if I feel like an arm and devil can't no more qualify to be Pastor here I'm going to mention it to the church when I'd see one thing here think that you deacons couldn't qualify to be deacons I would to mentioned it to the church and I find out there's a certain Deacon out here doing something he shouldn't do and he doesn't keep his post of Duty and so forth like that or a trustee or whatever it is I can't vote it in or out the church has to do that but I'm certainly going to present it before the church because that's what it should do that's what I'm supposed to be as overseer I'm supposed to look and see what's going on we're going to heaven not out here somewhere to Rally or something to have a lot of fun and run over one another and play baseball we're here handling the most gracious thing there is on Earth the word of God and be carried on in Godly order um who should be the teachers that's up to you to select them uh but I would take for the babies I'd take an old woman some that can do that but for the teenagers I'd take some teacher that's strict and not just going out here and having weener roast that' be all right they want to go on to weener roast but just put all the thing of that put it to the word that's somebody who's able to hold the word and it's going to be this church stands not for weener roaster all right and and little picnics that you want to go together in Fellowship that's fine that that's what you should do the entertain the children but in this place in here this is the word of God witer roast is when you get together something like that but not in this house of God and these no of course we know we don't believe in this your foolishness of of parties and everything like that around here we we you know better than that who should be over the Sunday School to keep it in order the Sunday school superintendant that's what his business is he's not supposed to have anything to do with the deacon trustees pastors or nobody else he's got an office of his own whoever your Sunday school teacher is I know not that Sunday school teacher is supposed to see that every class is in its place and every teacher is present or substitute another teacher for that teacher if they're not there on that date then just before the Sunday while the lessons are going on this Sunday school superintendent is to go by and take up the offerings that they've had in there their Sunday school Collections and the report of how many present how many bibles they had in this class and so forth and make a report of it and then stand before the audience just before the preaching service when he's give the spot to do it when they have the Sunday School report after the Sunday school is over tell how many teachers how many present how many the whole Sunday school total whole C total of offerings and so forth like a deacons trustees pastors are not supposed to do that they have nothing to do into it that is a Sunday school superintendent's job and then if he sees that the Sunday School needs certain things then he is to present that to the U uh uh to the trustee board and the trustees has a meeting up on it first and then the trustees that they find that there is sufficient funds and so forth through the treasure then this can be purchased if you wants something there for literature or whatever it is or some Bibles or something they want to buy a Bible for uh the one you know it can uh find the most words and quote the most scripture or some Prize or something they going to give away like that or said they want to buy it to the church then let that be presented to the to the to the um the deacons and then let them find out if it's if it's if it's in the Treasure see and that I think that takes care of them five questions on that now on the next one is brother brandham in respect to the order of the church we have tried to go accordingly to the way we understand the orders given in the dedication of the new church and by doing so some have gotten mad and left the church and others will not listen to anything we say especially the children we have talk to the parents about their children and they won't take care of them now have we misunderstood or are we going about it in the wrong long way thanks now let me answer this as they come down um in respect to the order of the church we have tried to go accordingly to the way we understood at given in the dedication of the new church now that's correct you're doing right now this is supposed to be deacons I suppose because it's right here it's a Deacon's job all right and by doing so we have often people has often gotten mad at us they do at me too they'll do it any man see a person that does that there's something wrong with that person they're not right with God for the spirit of Christ is subject to Christ teaching Christ house Christ order and any man that or any woman or any person children that would get angry with a Godly Deacon that would tell them to be or any parent would get angry with the Deacon really we want everybody in this church that we can get but if that would only cause trouble somewhere else there's a thorn or a rabbit in the wood pile as we used to say it that person isn't right if they leave there's only one thing to do let them go and pray for them and maybe some of the deacons go to the church or go to the house sometime and find out why they left and ask them what was wrong then and if they see if he can reconcile them if he can't then take two or three Witnesses with him that they might be understood then if it can't be understood then it's told before the church that they are a member here of the church then they are and then if they're not members of the Church of course they're not members of this congregation they should be made to be rud see they they've got to listen to our ERS here because this is the orders of the church this is things we don't want to do things that I don't like to do but it's things that must be do I'm exposing myself and tell them here but this tape it's me they can hear me talking and know that's me not you man you've asked me these questions and I'm giv it to you the best that I know how from the word of God now if those people get angry go out from you what does the scripture say about it brother BR they went out from us because they wasn't of us that settled it left the church that's what they did all right others will not listen to anything we say especially the children the children are supposed to know discipline they should get it at home but even if it's mine my kids get in here at any time they get this hardly I don't want you to draw one string Sarah Rebecca Joseph Billy or whoever it might be you tell me I'll see to it if they can't behave then they'll stay away from church till they do learn to behave this is not an arena this is a house of God this is not a place to play and skate and write notes and laugh and cut up this is the house of God be cared out Godly you come here to worship not even to visit this is not a this not a picnic ground this is not a visitation place this is the visitation place of the Holy Spirit Spirit listen to what he has to say not to one another we don't come here to Fellowship uh with one another we come here to fellowship with Christ This is a house of worship and children must be disciplined and if they are of the parents let it be known if these deacons if these parents of the children will not listen to what these deacons said then this parents should be corrected themselves we have talked to the parents about about the children and they won't take care of them if they are members of this church then you should take two or three with you and call that parent into a private meeting into one of the offices I don't care who it is if it's me if it's brother Neville it's Billy Paul and his little boy if it's brother Collins and one of his children or any the rest of you we are we love one another but we're Duty bound to God in this word it's do no matter who it is we're to call one another in and be honest with one another how can God ever deal with this if we're not honest with one another how are we going to be honest with him see this is an order we must keep the house of God and deacons are supposed to know how to do that and that's why I'm telling you now I keep them things call them and if this you tell the parents and they won't listen to the won't listen to it then you get you another Deacon or one of the trustees or some good person in this church and call they your trust take your Deacon boore all your deacons together say brother Jones brother Henderson brother Jackson or whoever it might be see they children are disbehaving we've told them two three times about these children they won't listen to it then call Brother Jones in or brother whoever it is and say brother Jones We've called you in here for a meeting we love you and you're a part of us you're one of us let me just set this certain tape and listen to what brother brandom said about it see now we've asked you to make those children behave see if they won't behave and you can't make them behav in church leave them with someone while you come to church until they learn how to behave themselves in the house of God but this is an order it's got to be carried out see now other question goes on now have we misunderstood no sir you haven't misunderstood that's correct I'm saying it again the orders in the army they don't ask you will you go do a certain thing if you're in the Army you're compelled to do it see and that's the way it is in the I'm compelled to preach the gospel I'm compelled to stand for this regardless of what my other man and Brethren and so forth say about it I'm compelled to do this I have to hurt feelings and cut man to Pieces but if I you don't want to get like oswal see if you can't disagree with a man and things then shake his hand and still have the same feelings towards him then there's something wrong with you if I can't disagree with a man bitterly from one side to the other and still think as much of him as as Christ would then there something wrong with my spirit I haven't the spirit of Christ if he says well brother brandom I believe that you are teaching is this all right brother let's come together to reason you and I we'll take it ourselves we'll go over here in the room to ourselves we'll reason it out and he just cuts me to pieces and I have to say things back to him if in my heart I can't feel the same about him and he's still my brother and I'm trying to help him then I'll never help him there's no way for me to help him if I don't love him what's use of going over there tell you in the first place first brother I don't love you and let me get that out of my heart right here before we go in there because I can't help you until I love you and that's right and that's the way see car it on you've done it exactly right that's the way it should be you never misunderstood it are we going about the wrong way no it is the right way to car that let order be kept because it's constantly uh Little Children mothers little babies and things they they'll cry and if they get crying too much and interrupting your pastor up there remember you are here his bodyguards you're his gospel bodyguards see and if it's interrupting the message of the Lord then you are deacons what are you to do just like man speaking in tongues he's Duty bound and a man preaching he's Duty bound to the word he's Duty bound to these things each one of you Duty bound to an office and that's that's just what we're uh we're here to do amen how many can say Amen to the word of God thank God for that it's always good to hear that over again amen it reminds us the house um that this is not an arena we're handling the word of life and um brother bam makes this statement in there I just read that he said says we're here handling the most gracious thing there is on Earth the word of God Amen and that's what we do when we come here even a little prayer meeting like this we're here um drawing closer to his word amen let's all stand to our feet and I trust that the Lord will bless us as we hold these um things in our heart each one of us we had a prayer request here for um the the king's daughter-in-laws Naomi King's her dad had a pretty serious health uh situation there and um believe he was taken to the hospital and had some medical intention what was his name again brother Mario Galant and uh we'll keep him in prayer the Lord will bring him through that and um trust that the Lord will grant that of course you want to remember the stoles their family there and their um sister Nora sto is her name she is um has a lot to do with the passing of her husband for they've married for many many years and they have property and things that she has to do um and so she asked me to have the Saints pray for her she thanks the church for their support and we sent flowers and I know there's a number from this church that contributed to the the GoFundMe account for for them to help with the expenses and certainly appreciate that and the church contributed and um our family was able to go we certainly appreciate appreciate your prayers we left thir we left Sunday afternoon at 3: we drove straight through 16 hours and got there the next morning and um then afterwards we drove straight back and um and the lord gave us the grace to do that Levi did a lot of the driving I did quite a bit and so we're so glad that the Lord allowed us to do it and to be back here safely we've taken that Journey many times for The Family Camp and we always see accidents and deer and dead animals and people with dead tires and we did that for years we've never had an accident we never even had a flat tire in all our travels and this is God's goodness and Grace to us and we thank the Lord for bringing us back here safely again and so like to wish each of you a Happy New Year we would have loved to been in the house of the Lord with you in the New Year service but um it didn't work out but um as we look forward to what the Lord Jesus has for us we certainly I'm certainly under expectation What the Lord Has for me amen and so we certainly want to thank the Lord for that was there another prayer request here Sister Jesse Phillips passed away last night and um we want to remember them in prayer they have a really large family True Believers many of them were in brother branham's meetings and she's gone on to get her reward and so we want to remember the Phillips family and um yes is there another request here we' like to make mention here tonight amen so God bless you remember pray for one another amen let's sing that um he is here you list sing then he is here hallelu he is [Music] hereen he is here oh holy I will bless his name again he is here this closely hear him calling now your name he is here you can touch him you will never ever be the same I'm thinking of a request as brother bandam is talking about the duties of the officers of the church Sunday school superintendents deacons trustees Ministries pastors want we ask you to pray for the Brethren that are holding those positions those that are ushering we had a some break-ins here I had my wallet taken and brother Ben truck went through and then there's been a little vandalism around here the last few days or so and so um you pray for the deacons and the Brethren and and we always want to watch and pray we know that we're in a great battle you hear brother brandom talk about that preacher that was shot in the pulpit and the deacons shouldn't allowed that to happen and and it's happening more and more in our day that houses of worship are being broken into and and all this kind of stuff and so we know it's very serious want to be on our as it were our head on the swivel watch him pray and um take matters very very seriously as we're handling the most precious thing that we could handle the most precious thing on earth more important than what they're doing at the UFA or any scientific field or any corpor operation this is the Church of the Living God and we take that very serious we should and God is here to bless us and prepare us for his soon coming amen so we thank the Lord that we can gather and we just want to pray for one another and pray for God's blessing amen so we'll do that we'll take a moment and go to the Lord in prayer and God bless you you can pray in your seat you can come forward
