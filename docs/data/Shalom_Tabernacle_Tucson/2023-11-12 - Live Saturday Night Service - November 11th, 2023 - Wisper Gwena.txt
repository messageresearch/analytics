enjoyed as well the ministers meeting that we had with brother Fason amen like brother ISRO said you know it's it's almost like if you know everyone was here it was just so beautiful we appreciate the Lord for that amen without wasting much of your time I just want us to go straight um into the ministration of the word last night um we lay the background and um by God's grace I just want to take it a little further and then just bring um a teaching around that I said last night that I was just laying a background amen but before we get to um the word I just want to maybe give you a background to what I'm going to talk about and how this all came to me I'm a firm believer in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe that like brother Paul was saying that you got to be born again the Christian Journey starts from there so I'm a firm believer in that and um we were just teaching on this I've been teaching on it for for years is now um but it got to a certain time um when I just couldn't understand certain aspects about the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know you get to a place where you think that you understand something and then when things begin to unfold then you realize that what you thought you knew you actually don't know I got to that place where I I really really got so confused about certain things and when I get to those levels at times you know then I just take time to pray I wake up in the morning about 3: in the morning at 3:00 a.m. and uh I would just go and start to pray and I do that for days and just carry on and carry on and I was so burdened at that time and I wanted to find out what what really you know this was all about and one day when I was in prayer really burdened about that issue I don't know how I can explain it because I can't but whilst I was in prayer the Lord revealed to me what I had to go and read and the Lord directed me to a specific Court when I Rose from there I knew exactly where to go and read now that is has only happened to me three times in my life where something like that is revealed in such a supernatural way and in all the three instances it is when I was in prayer so I rose up from there and I went and I took the message that the Lord had revealed to me and I went straight to that quotation and there was my answer and that just changed me so completely and by God's grace I just want to touch on that now this was about 11 years ago and since then you know the Lord has just been revealing this more and more and getting to understand the word even in a more clearer way you know when the Lord opens up a channel then it continues to just unfold and to unfold by his grace so we thank God for his goodness amen so by God's grace I want us to just now come to to the time of the ministration of the word I'm going to ask you to stand to your feet as we get to the reading of the word amen praise the Lord hallelujah this the same scripture that we read yesterday for the benefit of those that were not here I'm just going to just background this and touch on what we spoke about before I get into what I want to talk about tonight in the book of Zechariah IAH chapter 4 the Bible says starting from verse one and the angel that talked with me came again and wed me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and he said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bow upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bone and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and SP to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of H who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace un it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall so shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of horse has sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fr through the whole earth and then another scripture in the book of second Peter chapter 1 starting from verse 5 and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity we may be seated as we bow our heads Heavenly Father we have read Thy word we come now now to this sacred part the part that we cannot handle father it takes you and you alone Lord I confess my inabilities but I ask that you can step in Lord father may you increase as we all decrease that's our prayer tonight we commit the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you praise the Lord so by God's grace we just carrying on from where we left amen and uh we we want to speak on the zeru Babel commission amen but by God's grace we are going to part two I just want to see whether this thing is working or it's not no it's not working for me all right so we have to go back to to plan B he knows our plan B all right so um we just carrying on from where we left off last night we established last night that the Bible tells us of a zerubabel the book of Ezra speaks of a zerubabel that was there in the days of of um uh in the days of Ezra in the days of King Cyrus who went to rebuild the house of the Lord in Jerusalem but Zechariah speaks of another zerubabel who we say is building a spiritual Temple how do we know that the zerubabel of Zechariah is building a spiritual Temple we know that because of the way that he actually builds that building the Bible tells us that he brings forth The Headstone with shouting crying Grace Grace unto it in other words he doesn't come with building equipment he doesn't come with an ordinary building material that we use to build a physical building but he comes with a spiritual angle to his building amen we then saw that the Bible gives us a way to identify who this zerubabel is because the question that we have is but who was this zerubabel and to identify him we say that the Bible gives us a way to identify the zerubabel and we find that according to the Bible in the book of Zechariah Chapter 4 in verse number five then the Bible says then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what this be and I said no my Lord and he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel so there is a specific word of the Lord unto zerubabel and that specific word that is unto zerubabel we are shown in the Bible what that word is is that right church because we find that in Zechariah 4 verse number two the Bible says and he said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of God with a B upon on the top of it and seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof so what Zachariah was looking at like we said yesterday it was something like this I'm on the picture it was something like what that picture is showing us amen praise the Lord if you just take me to the picture so what Zachariah was looking it was something like that and when Zachariah said but what is this my Lord then he is told that this that you are looking at is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel now a question was asked and the question was but is zerubabel not the Lord Jesus Christ now I give you to understand that the scripture says this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel so the word of the Lord comes unto zerubabel now Jesus Christ is the word so the word cannot come to the word but the word comes unto a prophet so this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel it tells me therefore that zerubabel must be a prophet and not the Lord is that right church so the word of the Lord unto zerubabel so to identify zerubba Bell we got to look into the word of the Lord that came unto him and that is the way that we are able to tell who this zerubabel is and according to what Zechariah tells us is that he's got to come with a message around the candlesticks around the lampstands and when we find that man that brings the message aen who is identified as a prophet of God then we know that that is zerubabel and we are not ashamed like I said yesterday to declare to the world that we know who zerubabel is because zerubabel is none other than that prophet of God I wish that my young man can see me but he's hiding behind the screen all right so he is none other than the prophet of Malachi 4 he is our zerubba Bell and how did we establish that he is zerubba because we know he's the one that came and he started preaching on the seven Church ages and not only did he preach on the seven Church ages but after he preached on the seven Church ages then God came behind what he had preached and he drew exactly the same pictures by the pillar of fire in other words what God was saying was that what this man has said I have put my signature to it this is not the word of a man this is the word of the Lord that has come unto a generation so we are not second guessing Amen on who has the authorized version of the seven Church ages we know who has the authorized version because God himself came and he Vindicated it by a pillar of fire and I want to say that it was the message of the seven Church Ages which is the message of the seven golden candlesticks it is what made brother Branham zeru Bell because Zariah was told this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel and I want to say that if he had not preached on the seven Church ages he could have been Malachi 4 he could have been Revelations 10:7 but what made him zerubabel to me is because he then brought the message of the seven churches because that is what was saying in the book of Zechariah this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel so zerubabel had to come with a specific message are you with me tonight then we found out amen that the main Commission of zerubabel was the bringing of The Headstone is that right so the purpose of the coming of zerubabel was that he would bring forth The Headstone thereof amen and then we established yesterday that that there is only one type of a building that can actually have a headstone on top of it the zerubba build that came during the days of Ezra amen he was coming to build a physical Temple that was in this form here amen and we found out yesterday that if you've got a building like this there is no way that you can actually put a headstone onto it because a headstone ties the entire building so you can put a Cornerstone onto a building like that but where are you going to place the headstone if you place it there that corner is not tied I'm still on the same picture if you put it on there that corner is not tied that corner is not tied that corner that is way behind there is no tied so where do you place a headstone on a building that is in that type of a ship there is only one type of a building which you can place a headstone on and we get to understand that it is in the shape of a pyramid so when we get to the pyramid it is the only building amen if you take me to the next one that you can put a headstone on because if you put a headstone here you tie that corner and you tie that corner and you tie that corner and you tie the corner that is behind so the only building that you can put a headstone on it is got to be in the shape of a pyramid now if brother branam was a ruber bell then we get to understand that he had to bring amen a spiritual pyramid because he's building not a physical building but he's building a spiritual house or spiritual houses rather so he had to bring a pyramid message and then we found out yesterday that in the message is this the sign of the end in paragraph 129 the prophet says now that was mans and mans and months before the pyramid message was preached so we get to understand that brother Branham preached a pyramid message is that right and we establish what that pyramid message was it was the message the St of a perfect man because the prophet says in paragraph 373 you remember the pyramid message it's the Capstone what did he do the Holy Spirit kept off the individual and seal it when it added to our faith righteousness and godliness and faith and so forth and kept adding to it till we got the seven things and we know the prophet was speaking about the message the stature of a perfect man now the main part of the message of zerubabel like I said it is the bringing down of The Headstone and if brother Bram came and if he did not bring down the headstone then it means he was not zerubba Bell because before zerubabel the pyramid amen cannot be completed because the headstone has not yet come there on if you take me to the picture so if you are building aen we're going forward so if we are building aen then the way that this picture can only be completed is if the headstone comes on it before The Headstone comes on it it is not complete are you with me praise the Lord in the highest so because brother Bram we know was the ruber bell and if he was the ruber Bell then we can emphatically say that that pyramid was completed wow why because the Bible says truly Elijah shall shall first come and restore all things not some things but all things and the Bible also tells us that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished so if he came he finished the mysteries of God if he came He restored all things and not part things therefore I can as well give you to understand that the pyramid was completed is a right Church why because he came but then as we take it a step further I want to say that though I'm saying that the headstone came and The Headstone is here but the way that God actually does it the prophet tells us in the message the stature of a perfect man because he says there are two big beings to which he brings the headstone the prophet of God says in paragraph 354 and this being when it's completed is the Church of God going into the Rapture and this being and completed is a servant of God in the Church of God that's going in the Rapture Glory see what I mean there you are there is the full thing so the prophet tells us amen that there are two beings upon Who The Headstone is going to come take me to the picture one step so there are two beings upon whom this the the the The Headstone is going to come all right he's not moving at the pace that I want him to move but it's okay so the prophet of God tells us that this being here which is the one that is in red amen that is the Church of God that is going in the Rapture and then he turns around and he says and this being here glory to God is the individual amen is the sevenant of God that is in the Church of God that is going in the Rapture so how did God actually do this the way that God did it he sends a message amen that produces this being here which is the Church of God that is going in the Rapture so there is a being that God is dealing with that is going in the Rapture and that is represented by the seven churches and the Seven Church age Messengers but then there is an individual that is in the Church of God that is going in the Rapture so what God did is he completed the being which is the church that goes into the rapture the full mechanics of that church God brought down when he brought Malachi 4 who is our zeruel are we with me are you with me tonight so that was completed but when that was completed where is the work of God now the work of God is now on this being here I'm still on the picture the work of God is still amen now the focus is on this being here glory to God and that being amen which is the individual he is the one that is going into the Rapture are you following me Church glory to God in the highest so the focus praise the Lord is now on that individual it is now on you and I we are the focus of the message of the hour and I hear the prophet of God begins to tell me and he says in paragraph 172 Christ never sent me to build organizations Christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that there might be the PowerHouse by the that there might be the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word by his word see build up the individual to that place so the focus of the message of the hour it is the building of the individuals and I hear the prophet loud and clear and the prophet says God never sent me to build organizations but God sent me to build individuals God sent the prophet to build you and I we are the focus of the message of the hour we are the ones that are to be built built what to Hallelujah built amen into the stature of Jesus Christ what for that we might become the dwelling place of the Spirit by his Works glory to God in the highest Hallelujah so now the prophet of God because he's a Ruel he's now going to come with a message that is going to build the individual and that's now he turns to the book of Peter and he now pulls the scripture of second Peter chapter 1 and then in second Peter chapter 1 the Bible says and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity and we know that from here this is where the prophet of God preached the pyramid message is that right church now when the prophet of God preached that message he was drawing a picture of a pyramid and as he drew that picture of the pyramid he amen had to make some certain diagrams onto it praise the Lord in the highest if you take me to the picture so the prophet drew that picture as he preached that message that was the pyramid that the Prophet Drew but now when the prophet brought this message then he placed the holy ghost at the top here amen and when the prophet placed the holy ghost at the top there that gives rise to different understandings and that is where our lesson is going to be tonight before we get to the preaching part Hallelujah the prophet plac the Holy Ghost right at the top there amen and this brings us to a very important lesson because the prophet placed the Holy Ghost up there it gives the impression that before you get the Holy Ghost you got to add all these virtues and you can't get the Holy Ghost until you have added all these virtues because the Holy Ghost is up here hallelujah is that right not only does it give that impression and watch I'm saying an impression not only does it give that impression but after we had picked up that impression than many of us including myself back then before 11 years ago I heard then the understanding that because the prophet in many quotations he says the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new New Birth it then gives the understanding that the new birth is also up there come on but I want to say to you tonight to say that the new birth is up there is actually an error why do I say what I'm saying praise the Lord in the highest okay there's a bit of a slight delay in the change of the screens so just bear with us praise the Lord so now I'm saying that to place the new birth at the top here is actually an error and why do I say that it is an error because when the prophet of God preached the message the stat of a perfect man he never placed the new birth at the top here come on come on now I had listened to the message the stature of a perfect man I had read the message the stature of a perfect man but I'd never got to understand that but when the prophet preached the message the stature of a perfect man though he placed the holy ghost at the top here but he never place the new birth at the top here where did the prophet place the new birth he the new birth at the bottom here oh let's get into the message of the Prophet so that we can prove this by the message the stature of a perfect man the prophet in the message the stature of a perfect man in paragraph 1141 he says and here is what we do what's the first thing have faith and be born again that's laying the foundation oh glory to God oh glory to God this is what we do what's the first thing have faith and be born again take me to the court that's laying the foundation so where do we find the foundation according to the prophet it is at the bottom have faith and be born again where do we find the new birth it is at the Foundation stage hallelujah oh let's establish that according to the Prophet The Prophet then in paragraph 142 then he says and after we lay the foundation secondly you add to your foundation add to your faith Peter said here add to your faith first you have faith then you add virtue to your faith this is the next column first pour your foundation Faith then to your faith add virtue come so the first thing that you got to do it is to pull the foundation then in paragraph 102 the prophet of God says notice you must be born again and when you are born again you can be born again without having faith that's right so you see on my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith it is impossible to please God so the prophet of God glory to God he put Faith at the foundation and he says have faith and be born again take me to the picture so he says have faith and be born again but where is Faith it is at the foundation here so the new birth is at the foundation there so now we can make this chat clearer and I can get back to the diagram I was using yesterday praise the Lord take me to the next one so have faith and be born again so we find then that the new birth is the foundation and it is right here at the bottom glory to God in the highest and we are clear according to the message the stature of a perfect man that that is where the Prophet go the prophet of God placed the new birth but we still have the baptism of the Holy Ghost up there and the question that then comes to a Believer is then what do we do with the quotations where brother Branham says that the new birth is the baptism of the Holy Ghost I give you to understand that yes the new birth is still the baptism of the Holy Ghost we have quotations that say that many quotations that say that I'll just take one or two here the prophet of God says in the smiling Church ede what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth Hallelujah so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth it is the spirit of God coming in and filling you after you have repented having heard his words Oh Glory to God so what is it that happens you hear the word like brother Paul was preaching in the morning uh when you hear the word Acts chapter 2 amen verse 37 they were pricked in their heart there was conviction that Came Upon them and when that conviction Came Upon them Hallelujah then they repented and after the repentance it leads you to a birth Hallelujah and of course there are many quotations we know where the prophet of God also says that the new birth is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that right and then the question then comes so is there a contradiction in the message there is no contradiction in the message and that brings us now to what brother Ferguson was saying in the ministers meeting there's got to be a Reconciliation of these quotations oh praise the Lord in the highest we got to be real good students of the word the Lord Jesus Christ is said in the Book of Luke chapter 24 verse number 25 he says oh fools slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have said now we are not fools amen we are children of the most high and as children of the most high we believe all that the prophet is saying if the prophet says the new birth is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost we say Amen if the prophet says the bapt the the new birth is the baptism of the Holy Ghost we still say Amen but there's got to be a Reconciliation of these quotations and I am here to tell you that those quotations indeed they reconcile we ain't got time to go through the reconciliation of it but I believe that they perfectly reconcile the question is when he is saying that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth and when he's saying the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not the new birth what exactly is he referring to glory to God but we know that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth is that right he goes on and he says here we all know that the Bible teaches the new birth and they substitute handshakes and everything else for the new birth but it will never take the place of the new birth it's got to be an experience a born again so the new birth is still an experience he goes on and he says we all know that any kind of a birth is a mess that's what the new birth is it's a mess but it brings life it ain't a style or a put on or a Declaration of of Creeds is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's the secret of the real believing Church born [Music] again what is the secret of the real believing Church it is the new birth glory to God in the highest so I can as well come back to my picture now and I can say yes according to the quotations if you take me to the picture the prophet of God has told us that the new birth amen is the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that right is that what the quotations are telling us so we can as well we know that according to stature of a perfect man he has placed the baptism of the Holy Ghost at the foundation he has told us that the new birth is the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we still have the Holy Ghost that is up here and the question that then comes is so what is this holy ghost that is up here do we have two different holy ghosts the answer is no there is only one Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God so how come then Preacher Man that we've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost here and we've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost up there what is going on Preacher Man let me say to you that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not a single event but the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah it is a journey oh let me bring it to the quotations the prophet of God says we should be unfolding God's spirit pouring out not just one little GHA not one little baptism but baptism after baptism not Revelation just shall leave by faith or sanctification or the gifts of the Spirit but revelation after Revelation power after power glory after Glory so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not a single event Oh Glory to God in the highest but the prophet of God tells us exactly how he believes these things because he says in the message you must be born again in paragraph 35 he says and now I'm saying this and I know it's going on tape and I want to say this to the pastors I want to say this to the pastors that will perhaps receive this step I suppose maybe just a little different from what the regular Church teaches it I teach and believe and believe can sufficiently prove by the scripture that you are born of the spirit and then baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit and the prophet of God says here and you are born of the spirit and then I'm still on the same one and then glory to God baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and then means that it's something that is coming after so you are born of the spirit of God and then after you born of the spirit of God and then and the prophet of God says I want to say this to the pastors I teach and believe and believe can sufficiently prove by the scripture Oh Glory to God so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not a single event but the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a journey according to the prophet it starts with a new birth and then it begins to grow Hallelujah he puts it in another way when he gives us the example of a baton the message uncertain sound he says in paragraph 42 as I Illustrated it like a Buton when a man is saved that much of him is God that's the little light that comes in to make him quit doing what's wrong now if you can take all the malice and envy and strife and unbelief out that little button like of the light and power of God will keep growing growing growing growing crowding out unbelief and you don't do it by exaltations or bodily exercise you do it by a sanctified consecrated life that the holy spirit moves through [Music] you oh glory to God how are you going to grow when you are served glory to God a little light like the size of a Pon comes inside of you but then now that little light of Amen that is the size of a Buton which is the power of God hallelujah will keep growing uh and it will keep growing uh and it will keep growing and growing and growing uh crowding out unbelief uh how is it going to be growing uh as you are living a Sanctified life and as you are having the Holy Spirit move through you is that what the prophet is saying church so there is a growth that is coming and the question then comes so where are you growing to Hallelujah what are you growing true Oh Glory to God the prophet of God in the message Blasphemous name names let me just as well say right here that the message the stature of a perfect man and the message blasphemia names are exactly the same messages and if you want to get the full picture of the stat of a perfect man you got to go through the two messages together that's the only way that you're going to get the full picture of what the prophet was bringing here so we get now to the message Blasphemous names and in paragraph 168 the prophet of God says now when the member is born by the Holy Ghost into the family of God so what happens first a member is born by the Holy Ghost into the family of God and something is now coming has proven to heaven these virtues in him that God can see virtue knowledge Temperance patience brotherly kindness and godliness in him then God seals him all places him and there that's where you see the Sons and Daughters of God so the prophet introduces another word here he says then God seals him so there is the baptism amen which is at Birth and then after the baptism of at Birth I'm still on the same cord then after the baptism at Birth hallelujah what happens next then the believer is proved to have these virtues inside of him that God can see all these virtues then God comes and seals him but then the prophet then changes the language and he says then places him Hallelujah now we are talking about the placing of a son yes and I've had to highlight it to say all places him now when we started talking about the placing of his son what are we now talking about we are now talking about adoption is that right church so a member is Born Into the family by the Holy Ghost and then is proved to have these virtues then God places him but the placing of a son it is the adoption of a son son take me to the diagram now so in the diagram we can now say that a member is Born Into the family of God and when a member is Born Into the family of God he's born by the Holy Ghost then he proves to have these virtues Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness amen then the prophet says then he seals him or places him brother whisper is it you that is just saying this or the prophet really said it it is the prophet that said it brother whisper are you saying that the prophet says that at the top here this is your adoption yes that's what the prophet of God says oh let me prove it by the quotations so that you know it is not me that is saying this but it is the prophet that's the way he taught it in the message blasphemia names he says then you have the spiritual you will be you have the Holy Spirit and will seal all these things unto you is that Holy Spirit covers this from your faith up to the Holy Spirit seals you in with Christ then you become one amen you become one see you and Christ live together if that day you will know that I'm in the Father the father in me I in you and you in me see then that's a sealed unit of the Lord [Applause] God then he says in paragraph 152 now and then they are Vindicated and and oh let's read it together they are Vindicated and placed when that time takes place they become come Vindicated Sons and Daughters of God then he says in paragraph 153 do you remember over in the Book of Matthew the 17th chapter the first to the 5ifth verse Jesus on Mount Transfiguration and he says you have heard hear ye him the sameon I just hear about a year ago preach become so popular hear ye him and we know what the message here is him is all about it is about adoption is that right church he goes on and he says the placing of a son in Ephesians 1:5 also God has predestinated us unto the adoption of sons see a family when a son is born into it it's a son then but that son had TOS to raise it and if that son never did come to to the right kind of a son he never become air but if he was the right son and the son that would obey his father then that son was adopted or placed positionally Hallelujah he become air of what the father H Oh Glory to God in the highest so we can conclude safely church that according to the message of the Prophet that the holy ghost that is at the top here it is your adoption until 11 years ago I never knew it Hallelujah that this holy ghost that is at the top there according to the teaching of the message in the stature of a perfect man in the message blasphemia names it is actually your adoption take me to the picture so right there at the top amen that Holy Ghost that the prophet is talking about it is talking about [Music] adoption and the prophet has done told us that in the Old Testament when a child was born that child was a member of the family but then that child had to be placed under tutors and governors to be taught to get to maturity and then at a certain point he was then adopted and let me say church that even nature itself it tells us exactly the same thing you don't give birth to a child with beards if you give child if you gave birth to a child with beard you run away from that baby you don't give birth to a child that is talking if the moment the child is born the child starts talking you run away from that child am I speaking reality you don't don't give birth to a child that is walking if that child jumps out of mommy's tmy and starts running around the whole Hospital W will run away so even nature itself tells us that the process amen that the way a child is born a child is born as a baby take me to a picture glory to God in the highest so when a child is born the child is only but a baby but when does that child become a member of the family it is the day that the child is born that day they become a member of the family if that child is a poor amen the very day that that child is born the child is named and the name has got a Ser him they are saying that this baby though the baby can't talk though the baby can't scream though the B sorry can't walk but that baby is identified as a member of the PO [Music] family Oh Glory to God even when they go to getting the best certificate the best certificate will say so and so send him this family identified as a member of that family and there is a lot of rejoicing oh congratulations a baby has been born to the poor family baby has been born to this family there is a lot of rejoicing because a New Birth has happened a family member has been added but that baby that has been added glory to God nobody knows what the baby's going to grow to become but give the baby time glory to God then the baby will begin to move and he will go amen becomes a toddler from becoming a toddler amen I'm still on the same picture from becoming a toddler that baby will begin to go to school and that baby will go to high school then that baby will go to college and at some point that baby will start to work is that right but all along amen though the baby is growing but father is saying yes you are my child but I cannot give you my business to handle because you are still growing you still need to be to tou but there comes a certain time glory to God when father now says my son is now mature I can give him to handle my business and I can give him the checkbook Authority that what he signs is signed what he fires is fired uh now his signature is as good as my signature it is the very some son that was a baby some years ago but what has happened with the baby the baby has been growing and growing and growing crowding out unbelief and at a certain point then the father is happy and when the father is happy then the father calls for an adoption glory to God in the highest then the father says now I give you my authority speak the word what you speak materializes when you are still a baby you can speak and people ignore you because they say that's child talk but when you get to a certain point amen even your father when you begin to speak the father says okay I'm listening my son carry on why because father knows I'm now talking to out I'm now talking to a mature somebody I'm now talking to somebody who I've given Authority praise the Lord in the highest so when a child is born the child amen is placed take me to the picture is placed under tutors and governors and what are those tutors and governors doing they are guiding the child to come to their maturity and the prophet tells us who is the tutor he says the tutor is the holy spirit so God gives you Birth by the Holy Ghost God hands you over to the tutor the Holy Ghost God grows you to maturity by the same Holy Ghost is that right church and I want to say to you tonight that we can prove by the word that the prophet taught us that every one of these stages from one level to another another it has got to take a birth the prophet of God says in the message Blasphemous names he says in paragraph 28 it's a birth I've been birthed into this into this into this into this and I've put numbers around it so you can see how many times the prophet is actually saying it into this into this into this and the prophet says it seven times then the love of God Christ comes down and seals all that I need what for for service for service Oh Glory to God take me to the picture so the prophet of God is telling us here that you are bir into this you are birth into that you are birth into that you are birth into knowledge into temp into patience into godliness until you get to brotherly kindness you are birth every stage but every birth is a mess and every birth takes the baptism of the Holy Ghost without the baptism of the Holy Ghost they cannot be a birth Hallelujah so I can as well say saints that it takes a birth for us to get to the next level and that birth it takes the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that right Saints glory to God in the highest thank you it takes a birth amen are you with me church and let me say to you tonight that it is an impossibility for you to even get to a place where you are going to add those virtues without the baptism of the Holy Ghost are we going to prove it by the word that unless you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's no way for you to add those virtues can we show it by the word the Bible says unto your faith add virtue is that right but the prophet tells us what is virtue the prophet tells us virtue is strength virtue is power and the prophet of God says say for instance you write a check and there is no funds in the bank the check will bounce insufficient funds and the prophet tells us that that woman that had the blood issue when she came and touched the ham of the Lord Jesus virtue went out of him but the reason why virtue went out of him is because there was virtue inside of him so before virtue can be drawn out of you virtue must come inside of you can you say amen amen you need to have that virtue before that virtue can be drawn out of you is that right church but virtue is power but how do we get power EXs chapter 1 verse number 8 but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you without the baptism of the Holy Ghost there is no power Hallelujah is that right church then the Bible says unto your VT add knowledge and the prophet of God tells us what type of knowledge that is he says this is not worldly knowledge the prophet of God says that is supreme knowledge it is a Godly knowledge it is a knowledge to know that God can't lie it is a knowledge to know that God keeps his word is that what the prophet says it's a supernatural knowledge it is not a knowledge amen that is a knowledge of this world Amen it is a knowledge of the word but I give you to understand that you can't add that knowledge without the baptism of the Holy Ghost why do you say what you are saying Preacher Man John chapter 16 verse number 13 the Bible says when he the spirit of Truth is come he shall lead you into all truth so in order to get into all truth what do you need first you need the spirit of Truth you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost John 4 verse number 23 the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship Him in spirit and in watch the order of the Scripture it is in spirit and in in other words you can't get truth before you get the spirit when he the spirit of truth is has come he will lead you into all truth true worshippers it's got to start with the spirit and the spirit leads you to the truth can you say Amen so you can't add that knowledge unless the spirit is inside of you are you getting me tonight oh let's take another one let's look at godliness the prophet of God says what is godliness the prophet says I look through the dictionaries I went through four or five dictionaries trying to see what godliness is all about and I couldn't find it but he says I then went to a brother's house and right there is where I then found out what godliness is is then he says what is godliness he says godliness is to be like God glory to God now how can you be like God unless the spirit of God is inside of you the prophet of God says if I had the spirit of John villinger you would expect me to pick up some guns I'll be an outlaw is that what he says he says if I had the spirit of an artist then I you would expect me to paint some pictures is that right if you want to be like God then you got to have the spirit of God so godliness can only come after you have the spirit of God inside of you say Amen [Music] somebody so you need the Holy Ghost before you can have godliness inside of you because it only takes God glory to God to produce himself in the life of an individual oh let's get this clear tonight church and let's really make it plain and simple and clear now we started by showing this diagram take me to it the prophet of God says amen that there are two beings that the Holy Ghost and the cing of the storm is coming on to the prophet of God says that there is the church that is going in the Rapture and there is the individual that is going in the Rapture and then the prophet of God tells us that the way that he has dealt with the church is the way that he deals with the individual and that's why he superimposed these two diagrams is that right now let's hear what the prophet says paragraph 146 Blasphemous names he says it has been the holy spirit that made the Ephesus Church it was the Holy Spirit that birth the Manan Church the holy spirit that gave the pagamos church and the tiyan church in the Dark Ages is the holy spirit that's built that bride the elect that's pulled out of all the organization systems Right Through the Ages like that there is an elected a predestinated bride of Jesus Christ that the Holy Spirit has called out the elect and it's been the Holy Ghost in This age that age that age that that that that and I've numbered them again so you can see what he's talking about he mentions that seven times in other words the prophet is pointing back to his diagram to show us that it has been the Holy Ghost where if you take me to the diagram again it has been the Holy Ghost in that age in that age in that age that that that that but the way he built the church is exactly the same way that he builds the individual now we all can agree that Ephesus had the Holy Ghost is that right if Ephesus had the Holy Ghost then the way he built the church is the the way that it builds the individual so it means at Faith the individual must also have the Holy Ghost smer until we go amen until we get all the way to laia it's been the holy ghost that has been building the church say Amen somebody if it wasn't the holy ghost that build the church then we are also saying that even in our age the age of brother Branham because that age is still under the cing it would not have the Holy Ghost but the prophet is telling us it has been the holy ghost that built that church that church that church that that that that and the prophet says he does the individual in exactly the same way oh glory to God so we can safely conclude church that we need the Holy Ghost in order for us to climb up amen the ladder to the stat of a perfect man it starts with a new birth glory to God in the highest Oh Glory now I can come back to the commission of zerubabel and we'll find a place to close glory to God Zachariah chapter number four the Bible says the hands of zerubabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of host has sent me unto [Music] you so zeru Babel lays the foundation with his hands why is he laying the foundation we say it yesterday night that the reason why he's coming to lay the foundation is because when it comes to laia that building has totally been destroyed and Christ is standing outside of the church he has been kicked out completely and the Bible says in Revelations 3 CH verse number 20 behold I stand at the door and I knock he's been kicked out of that church Edge he's nowhere near that church Edge so because he's rejected zerubabel then comes along and zerubabel with his hands he lays the foundation but what is that Foundation the prophet told us that that Foundation is the Cornerstone and what is that Cornerstone that Cornerstone is Jesus [Applause] Christ so he comes to lay again that foundation and what is the foundation he has already told us lay the foundation be born again so zeru Babel comes and he begins to build the church and he says when we are building this church when we are building this individual it's got to start with the foundation it's got to start with the new birth oh let me say church this message starts with the Holy Ghost this message continues with the Holy Ghost this message finishes with the Holy Ghost this message is about the baptism of the Holy Ghost from start to finish glory to God in the highest without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are feasting on a wrong principle he is the principal team of the message if he not the principal theme of the message you have missed it somewhere if you end up with another principal theme who is not Jesus Christ you have missed it somewhere can you say Amen somebody he is the Cornerstone and he is the Capstone he is the alpha and he is the Omega he is the holy ghost at the foundation he is the holy ghost at the top he is the St and he is the finishing he is the same God oh glory to God in the heart yes so zel comes and he says we're going to lay the foundation we're going to start again you got to start with the new birth you must be born again that's why brother Paul was saying in the morning young children you got to have an experience oh let me also Echo that and say you must be born again unless you have a true experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you ain't not started you you got to get to that place where you become a son or a daughter of God you got to migrate from being a grandson of God because God does not have grandchildren God has Sons and Daughters say Amen somebody you must be born again so zerubabel comes along and he lays the foundation and as he lays the foundation then he starts to build that house glory to God but the Bible says the hand of zerubabel it has laid the foundation his hands shall also finish [Applause] it let me say we are living in a special age we are living in an age amen where zerubabel lays the foundation but zerubabel also finishes the building in the same age oh this is a special age Church it is an age of a Sharp quick work glory to God where the house is started and the house is completed can you say Amen Joel propes side of this day in Joel chapter 2: 23 the Bible says and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first [Music] month that is talking about a sh sharp quick work oh glory to God because ordinarily your former rain it comes in another month and then the crops begin to grow and they begin to grow and at a certain point then you have the latter rain which is your Harvest rain which is bringing the crop to maturity is that right so that you can come into the Harvest is that right they don't ordinarily come in the same month it was a type of what was to happen in this age that you will have that God is going to send the former rain and the latter rain all in the same age oh we are living in a special age church we are living in an age where God is doing everything he's starting the building he's building the building he's completing the building all in the same age God sent us a message that can bring us to a completion say Amen somebody God plants the plant God Waters the plant God fertilizes the plant with the fullness of the word that the plant might grow and come to its maturity in exactly the same age and let me say to you tonight Church what God starts God will finish my God does not do half jobs no no no no what God starts he will finish it zerubabel has laid the foundation zerubabel will also finish it so let me repeat we are living in an age where what God starts is finishing it whatever it is that God has started he's going to finish it why do I say what I'm saying because I am fully persuaded Philippians chapter 1 verse number six being confident of this very thing that he which began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ oh let me say to you tonight if God started a good work inside of you he will finish that good work he did not start something in you so as to leave it halfway he will finish what he started are you with me tonight are you with me tonight what God starts he's going to finish it I don't care what the devil is trying to resist it I don't care how many demons from the pie of hell are trying to resist what God started but what God started he's going to finish it are you with me tonight because God Amen once he starts something he's going to complete that which he started if he started a work of Salvation in you he's going to finish that work of Salvation the Bible tells me we are predestinated unto the adoption of sons therefore let me say our adoption is not even a maybe Oh Glory to God it is not a maybe but it is a definite because you are predestinated unto the adoption of sons say Amen somebody so I might as well tell you you're going to be adopted otherwise the Bible is lying is that right but the word of God cannot lie what God starts he will finish if God says you're going to be adopted then you're going to be adopted I don't care how many demons are against you I don't care how much United States of America is trying to pull you down but there is enough word there is enough Holy Ghost there is enough power that is in this message to take you to where God wants you to be can you say Amen somebody can you say Amen somebody God is going to finish the work that he started if he brought you here he has a Destiny for you if he pulled you out of the world he has a Destiny for you if he took you into the message he has a Rapture for you the Rapture is yours Heaven is yours oh give God a hand of Praise somebody I might as well say there's going to be a performance of the things that God has said in you about you what God said about you there's going to be a performance around it I don't care how many weapons are formed against you my Bible tells me no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper every tongue that rises against you thou shall condemn so we can condemn it tonight and say these children of God these sons of God uh these Daughters of God they're going to make it anyhow whether Satan likes it or not you're going to make it by the grace of God you're going to make it by the grace of God oh you might as well start to rejoice and say thank you Lord my journey it is already secured uh my destination uh it is already secured uh my going uh it is already secured give God a hand of Praise somebody oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah there shall be a performance the devil is a liar I don't care how many times he opens his mouth but he's still a liar you are a child of God you are a son of God you are a daughter of God oh Hallelujah so hold on Child of God there shall be a performance what God said he will do he will perform it inside of your life there is enough power in this message to produce children of God there is enough power in this message to produce the power of God the prophet of God says Christ Christ never sent me to build organizations Christ sent me to build individuals to the St of Jesus Christ that they might be the [Applause] PowerHouse I can begin to preach right here God sent you the Holy Ghost God sent this message that you can become what a Powerhouse a Powerhouse oh brother that the purpose of this message it is to take an ordinary people and to change them to become Supernatural people it is to take an ordinary people oh glory be to God and produce temples that are the dwelling place of the most high it is to take an ordinary people and produce Jesus Christ on two feet again that's what this message is All About Now what is a Powerhouse a Powerhouse is a house where electricity is generated or a house where electricity is stored that's a Powerhouse and the prophet of God is telling me here that God sent him to build individuals until they come into the stat of Jesus Christ until they become powerhouses when you have got that St built in you you become a Powerhouse there is a thousand, V that is resident inside of you and what does electricity do it can electrocute Oh Glory to God when you become a Powerhouse then you can electrocute any demon you can electrocute any disease you can electrocute that cancer you can electrocute that diabetes you can electrocute that blood pressure you can electrocute any problem whatever it is there is enough power that is resident inside of you if you are a child of God if you are a daughter of God there is enough power oh tonight the devil is in trouble oh tonight the devil is in trouble I believe in a message that produces a real power this message is not something to play with this message produces what it says if God started something in you he will finish it if he started the work of healing inside of your life he will finish it so healing is yours care not what the devil tells you but if God starts a work he will finish that work amen and [Applause] amen let me drop in two testimonies here in our church we have a certain sister young sister got married and the were expecting their first child and as they were expecting this first child they went to the doctors and the doctors they did their scans and they said we are afraid that the baby does not have a nose and you can imagine how devastating that news is to a sister young sister just recently married expecting their first child and the husband and the and and the sister they say they were recommended and they said we recommend that we remove this baby terminate and the couple said no we can't do it we're going to keep the baby so they carried on they went to the next SC I don't know yet how many weeks it was but say you know you're about 28 weeks or there about they went for the scan and the doctor said the situation is still exactly the same the baby does not have a nose what what do you want to do they said we want to keep the baby and they carried on Amen went to 32 weeks and they scanned again and the doctor say that the baby does not have a nose but we can't terminate it now it's too late they said let's carry on and the husband and the sister they were quiet and they were just praying the father of this sister is one of our ministers and he's a Gifted Man he has the gift of praying for the sick many testimonies around his life called the dead and he says Dad this is what the situation pray for me and the father prayed for that girl but the father himself started to say to this girl and he says you know don't worry about it you know these things can happen he himself could not amass the faith and the child started to say to to the dead A Gifted Man and she said to the dead why are you saying what you are saying you don't have faith I I'm keeping the baby and she carried on like that she never even told me one day she was listening to the message I was preaching I took the quotation where the Prophet talks about that woman that came to the prayer line and was holding a hanky and the prophet says oh don't weep sister and then the prophet of God says God will heal you and then the sister removed the hanky from the face and there was no nose and the prophet prayed for that situation and when the prophet prayed for that situation a few months down the line the prophet passed through the same place and the sister came along and he says do you remember me do you remember the quotation a brand new nose had grown there and I was preaching one day not knowing that I had a couple in the church that were actually going through that and they said we took that and we said the god of that sister is is going to be the god of our child They carried on with the with the pregnancy 37 weeks they went for the final come the doctors had now said this is going to be a test case we are getting all the other doctors from all the different countries this was the best doctor that is in London they called the others from France and they said get ready this child is about to be born we want every one of you to come the child came a few days earlier than they expected but when they went to the 37th week then they started doing the scan and the doctor stopped and he says huh they said let's repeat the scan and they did the scan again and the doctor was tattled and the sister started thinking what is the doctor seeing come on and as the doctor carried on then he say sister I don't know what happened but your baby is got a [Applause] [Music] nose that child was born that child we dedicated and that child has a nose contrary to Medical signs I'm talking about a Powerhouse I'm talking about a message that has got power we've got another sister that is in the church if you come to our church we'll show you these people they are not fake they are real we've got another sister this sister the doctor say she has got something on the back of her spinal cord and they said you've got a growth and they said this growth is aggressive and it is growing at a very fast PA so they said we've got to quickly operate so they took her into surgery very quickly and there was only one doctor that could perform that operation and that doctor said I've got just one opportunity if we miss this we will not be able to do anything and because of this growth that is aggressive we got to do it very quickly they said okay fine let's carry on with the operation the sister went for the operation the doctor opened the spinal cord and they told the sister that after we open this you're going to be bad reading for some six months because it's a very delicate operation so they went ahead and they did this operation and the doctor when he tried to operate then he says the growth was too aggressive it had now entangled itself around the nerves in the spinal cord so the doctor could not do anything about it so the doctor closed up that sister now the sister is going to go 6 months with an operation that did not take away the growth and the doctors after they did that then they say to the sister 6 months you'll be getting ready to die because this is too aggressive the sister said I believe God and the sister said I'm going to start listening to the message of the Prophet I'm going to listen to the message message after message she took her earphones and she put them into her ear and she said this is what I say to Satan I say to Satan if you want to stay in this house in this house we listen to the word [Music] [Applause] 24/7 so if you want to stay here you better stay but if you want I'm going to torment you by the word and the sister started listening to the message message after message then that brother that I was talking about that gifted brother he prayed for this sister over the phone and when he prayed for the sister the sister then went into they said you're going to get a wheelchair and then you know you you you will not be able to walk they took her into a uh a ward for her to recover and then to go home and getting ready to die and the sister got into this gear to say I'm going to believe God the nsy says you're not supposed to move one day the NES come into the world and they see this sister walking about and the sister screams and says hey what are you doing you're not supposed to be up you can't even be standing and the sister said I feel well I was just brushing my teeth and they said you can't do that he says but I [Applause] can remember the doctor had failed to take the thing then one day the doctor said let's take you back for a scan and we see what is happening inside they took her back to the scan they put it in you know they have to put this liquid in there that shows the the growth they call it a Dye I think so they put that and pumped into her and they took her into the scanner and they looked and the doctor then said put her back they said pump some more Dy into her and put it back and these people that were ping this sister because they said it's a delicate case we can't just handle anyhow then they put her back into the scanner and she was wondering what is going on then the doctor looked and says okay fine you can take her back the next morning the doctor got to the hospital and he came to to the sister and he say sister wake up it was too early in the morning and the sister woke up and the doctor say to this sister I got some good news to tell you the sisters disappeared where did it go we have a God who when doctors have failed he can perform an operation without even causing any blood to spill I'm talking about a Powerhouse this message has got enough power to produce something inside of us come on Church of the Living God

solution inside of your life let me say this message is an answer to mountains Oh Glory to God because the Bible says in Zechariah 4 who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a [Music] PL and to prove that brother Branham was the rubel he started getting bothered amen with the scripture of Mark chap 11 if you say to this mountain why was he bothered with that scripture because he was the ruber bell and he has a message to the mountains so he started asking God did you mean a literal mountain and God says I meant a literal Mountain one day when he's out hunting then God says are you not hunting are you not looking for squirrel speak the word and the prophet spoke the word let there be a squirrel there and there was a squirrel let be another and there was a squir
