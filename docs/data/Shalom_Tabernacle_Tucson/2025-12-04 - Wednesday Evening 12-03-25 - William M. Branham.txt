His oath is gone and in his blood support me in the welling flood. When all around my soul gives way, he then is all my hope and stay. On Christ the solid rock I stand.

When he shall come with trumpet sound, oh may I then in him be found, dressed in his rightousness alone, called bless to stand before the throne. On Christ the solid rock I stand.

Welcome to the house of the Lord tonight. Amen. So good to see each and every one of you. God bless you richly. Um we're going to be finishing up a tape entitled Believe from the Heart. It's about 30 minutes or so. And there's a couple of quotations I wanted to read out of there for you and the scripture reading that brother Brandham used in when he opened up that message. And so if you'd like to turn your Bibles into the New Testament, Mark chapter 11. Like to welcome my visitors, Matt and Cheryl. And these are the families of Brother Nathan. Amen. his sister and her husband. Welcome. Amen. And uh brother Papiso is going back to the Eastern Cape, South Africa this week. He leaves on early Friday morning. And we really enjoyed him to be here with us. And so make sure you shake his hand and send him God's blessings. Amen. Brother um Christopher Mesa is here. God bless you. Wave your hand, brother. He's been with us before. He has a ministry. He does a lot of street uh witnessing and preaching. I believe he's from the California area as well as myself. Although we didn't we never met in California, but we know the same people, but he's in Jeffersonville now. And uh he's happy to have him with us. Amen. God bless each of you. Happy birthday, Sister Barbara. I think so. Is it your birthday? Yes. To her. God bless you. So, praise the Lord and God bless each of you. In the scripture in Mark chapter 11, Jesus speaking here, he says this, very familiar scripture. Verse 22. who in Jesus answering saith unto them, have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, what thingsoever you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them, and ye shall have them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Such powerful scriptures there. Brother Bam tells us in the belief from the heart message in paragraph number 33, he says this. Well, it seems like then upon thinking those things that there could be a placing by reading the word of faith that would go beyond the intellectual conceptions into the heart. Jesus said, "If thou shalt say in thy heart." Now, we get all frustrated in our minds. We go out and say, "Oh, I seen that done." Yes. And once in a while, it just hop skip and so forth. But it seems like it just can't get moving right is because we try to mix the intellectual with the supernatural. They have no dealings with each other at all. Intellectuals will say one thing and supernatural will say another. And any man that's ever led by the spirit of God does not take any thought of any intellectual, but he is led from his heart by the spirit of God. He is misunderstood. People say, "Oh, how could it be?" Um, paragraph 39, he continues on. He says, "Now, if you try to bluff that, it won't work. If you try to reason in your mind, say, yes, God's word is right. I believe that. I believe it will come to pass. I think that." Now, if that's intellectually, you just might as well stop thinking it until something comes down on the inside of you that just says it's so. And that's all there is to it. There is not enough demons out of torment could ever shake it from you. It's something on the inside called the heart. There is where real faith finds its resting place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that what you want to happen to you tonight? &gt;&gt; Something to happen in your heart. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, send me something in my heart. Amen. So let's sing onlyly believe. Singing only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Holy Lord I believe. Let's lift our hands and say Lord I believe. Lord I believe that all things are possible. Lord, I I believe. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. All things are possible. Lord, I believe. God bless. You may be seated, brother Brandham. It was a few days ago when we were just TO SEE HOW GOD DOES THINGS SO simple and we are so frustrated till we look for great big things. &gt;&gt; Be satisfied with little things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch him when he does his glorious works. &gt;&gt; How he protects you. Don't be looking way over the top of something. Look down here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice I begin to think this that it is possible that when a man like the apostles and when you can live close to God AND GOD TO HIS GRACE OPERATES THROUGH you that the more God YOU GET THE MORE GODLY YOU BECOME. &gt;&gt; The more eternal life comes in the more of the intellectual it pushes out. &gt;&gt; Now I don't mean to be a fanatic. I mean to be a real sane sound believer not a bunch of ism but a real solid true sensible intelligent believer and I watch I've seen it work and to think that if you get into that contact with God it becomes to it isn't your voice anymore IT'S NOT YOUR THOUGHT ANYMORE IT BECOMES GOD'S THOUGHT AND GOD'S VOICE. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE JUST THE VINE OR JUST A BRANCH. He's the vine and it's his spirit that goes in and energizes. &gt;&gt; As long as YOU CAN GET YOURSELF OUT OF THE WAY, HE'LL FILL IT UP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And then you can be a witness just like Noah's ark was a witness. Like Jesus was a witness of God. He become SO FULL OF GOD TO HIM AND GOD WAS ONE. God dwelt in Christ reconciling the world to himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The very expression a man's work declares his character. CHRIST WAS GOD'S WORK. &gt;&gt; AND CHRIST DECLARED GOD'S CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; His healing for the sick, his longing for saving the souls till even he gave his own life. God's work, God's character was declared in Christ. And if you can just empty YOUR OWN INTELLECTUAL THOUGHTS OUT AND GIVE GOD THE right away, &gt;&gt; HE CAN DECLARE HIS CHARACTER THROUGH THE WORK OF YOUR YIELDING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Empty up. Get the world. Get your doubt out of the way. If you come to the altar to be prayed for, SAY, "I'LL GO AND SEE IF I'LL GET HEALED." God can never declare his works. &gt;&gt; You've got to get your own thoughts out of the way and let him feel you. &gt;&gt; Now, the way I'm noticing these things, like this old bull up here was going to kill me that time, like them hornets back out by the fence, like many other things that's taking place, the bear in the woods. It's a study of nature. It's something that happens. I'm saying this now. excuse it as being a personal experience, but I want to tell you BECAUSE IT'S A MODERN TIME. Someone said, "Oh, well, those things happened back in the days of the prophets in the days." Well, GOD WAS SHOWING EXAMPLES. BUT DID YOU KNOW TODAY GOD'S BUILDING A CHURCH? &gt;&gt; You say, "WELL, THEY HAD PROPHETS. THEY HAD TO SPEAK THE WORD OF GOD." BUT HE'S GOT A CHURCH OF GOD TODAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Notice if something takes place, wished it could be all the time. I WOULD TO GOD THAT IT COULD BE ALL THE TIME, &gt;&gt; but it doesn't. It just comes at his will. Now, a few days ago or about two or three weeks ago, I was praying for people with leukemia. I was praying with people waiting for vision. That's sick and suffering. Many have waited on for years. For instance, this little Edith Right, crippled. I remember when her DADDY WAS LAYING DYING AND GOD SHOWED A VISION FOR HER DADDY AND LET EDITH lay there. There's a little woman. I I guess she's still in here. Mrs. Guyger from Fort Wayne. Pitiful looking little mother, young woman. She gave birth to a baby and the baby was so big. She was so little. It run her into cancer and got healed of the cancer. Now she's got almost a middle break from nervousness. She's in the menopause and the poor little thing and a real loyal husband and a little husband went everywhere praying and seeking and crying and be praying for such as that. And you know what happened? Brother Woods back there, his daddy came down, a Jehovah witness. Brother Woods was a Jehovah witness. God witnessed and declared himself to him by healing his boy David crippled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then his brother came down and his brother was living an immoral life and there the Holy Spirit turned around and rebuked him. &gt;&gt; Seen the woman he was running with and he surrendered his life and let EVERY DEVIL GO OUT of him that day and he's walking the streets now AND DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN TO SERVE GOD, testifying to his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then his poor old daddy, honest as he could be and all of his dealings as a farmer and so forth. AND WHEN HIS DADDY COME DOWN, he wanted me to go fishing with him. And we went down the to the lake on the road down a vision came that morning. And he said, "Every lake that you cross and every stream of water will be muddy. No fishing. But when you get down to the wolf creek there to the dale holler said that's going to be pretty and blue AND YOU HAVE NEVER CAUGHT A catfish in that water but YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH A WHOLE STRING OF them and said they're going to catch one or two little ones and then you're GOING TO CATCH A BIG FISH WITH A SCALE FISH. It'll be big of a species. I turned around and quoted to him. I watched the old man's eyes as he looked over towards his boys. When we went down there and got in the water, every lake was muddy going down. When we got there, it was just as blue. It hurt your eyes nearly. And we fished and we couldn't catch a bass crappie or anything. And all of a sudden, I started catching catfish and caught a whole string of them. Some of them five pounds and a piece and sometimes two on one line with a poleing line. We fished and got a string of fish. And the next morning I went back fishing. I caught one great big bluegill with a what we call the redbellyied sunfish, the biggest I ever seen. Then when the man come to me, I said, "Now sir, the Bible said if there be one among you spiritual prophet and what he says comes to pass and hear him if he doesn't." And I TOOK FOUR OUTSTANDING PROPHECIES OF JEHOVAH witness and showed him that none of them had come to pass. Every one of them failed. I said, ' Now, what about the fish? &gt;&gt; AND GOD SHOWED THAT vision to change that man and turn him around for that one man WHERE THERE WAS THOUSANDS LAYING SUFFERING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE ALMIGHTY, GOD TO LET YOU KNOW THAT HE DECLARES HIS DOINGS BY HIS WORK AND HIS CHARACTER IS DECLARED BY THE SAINTS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Look at the pool of Bethesda. You said that don't sound like God doing that. Look at the crippled, lame, halt, blind, withered, waiting. And here come Jesus right through their garments full of virtue and walked to a man and went to a man who could walk, do anything he wanted to, but had some kind of a disease and healed him and left the rest of them standing there. See his character. He wanted to show his powers. He wanted to do something. Yeah. The world stand still to notice it now. noticed day before yesterday when we went back. I come back to the Indianapolis meeting and I thought I'd have to stay just a little while away from the people. I got kind of rested up cuz I'd have 20 or 30 a day on private interviews, those visions coming. I was just about dead when I got home. No one knows what I go through on that. &gt;&gt; No one. There's no way to explain it. But then, Brother Woods and his brother and I run off down to the place in to fish again for a day and night. And that afternoon sitting back there, Brother Woods began to speak about an old woman that used to belong to the Anderson Church of God up here when they were in their bloom. How good said how she used to take them little Jehovah Witness boys and love them. And brother Wood said to his brother Lyall, he said, "Lyle, would it not be great now if we would go find that old sister and let her know that we're saved?" &gt;&gt; Now, that word found favor with God after been talking about God for a long time. But that word found favor. Those two Jehovah Witness boys, both of them, agemen, want to find an old woman and tell her that they were saved. two brothers. When they said that, the spirit of God and his sovereignty fell on me &gt;&gt; sitting there in that boat. &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish I COULD HAD VOICE THE WAY I COULD SPEAK that into the people's heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I could not no more control myself THAN YOU COULD FLY TO THE moon just by that word. AND I SAID, "BOYS, THERE'S SOMETHING FIXING TO HAPPEN." &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; It's a little animal of some sort. IT'LL BE BROUGHT TO LIFE. THERE'S GOING TO BE LIFE CONNECTED WITH IT. AND you'll see it right away. &gt;&gt; And I thought, well, now what have I said? AND I BEGIN TO THINK OF some things. What made me say that? No vision. IT WAS JUST SOMETHING SPOKE. WHAT WAS IT? IT WASN'T MY INTELLECTUALS. I COULDN'T EVEN THINK OF SUCH A THING. &gt;&gt; IT WAS DOWN BELOW THAT. &gt;&gt; IT WAS IN THE HEART THAT GOD HAD COME into &gt;&gt; he was doing the speaking. &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T EVEN WASN'T THINKING OF SUCH a thing. &gt;&gt; And it spoke. I think there's where Jesus said, "If thou believest in thy heart and shall say to this tree or to this mountain," and then don't doubt, but believe that what you say will come to pass, you'll have what you say. There's my point. &gt;&gt; Get to that spot. The word something is not yourself. It's something beyond your reasoning that speaks it. We went on. In closing, I say this. Brother Woods are sitting here as a witness. The next morning, that night, we went and the Lord gave us a great night of fishing. No one catching any fish. And we caught three there just in a few minutes. And the three weighed nearly 20 lbs. And we just had great strains of fish. The next morning, we went back and was putting the baits new on the line. And not one fish. It was over. I SAID, "LET US go into this little cove and rest a few of his brethren, and we shall fish for bluegills with a fly line." We went back up there and was fishing for bluegills back in the little cove with her boat. And every time we GET STOPPED LONG ENOUGH, THE MOTOR would stop. We wasn't fishing. We were talking about God. &gt;&gt; And Mr. Lyall, which is now he went to his sister to try to get her out, but overwitness. She told him she told him he's listening to devils that we WERE DEVILS. SAID, "LY YOU KNOW BETTER than that and all these certain things." Then Lyall caught a little bluegill about like that and he was talking so he let the little fell swallow the big hook. It went plum down into the stomach of the little fish and when he got a hold of it he couldn't pull it so he just squeezed it in his hand, wrapped it around and pulled the intros out of it. had to get this hook out of the mouth, for if he cut the hook off, it would kill dead. Fish go die anyhow. And here's the words that he said. You sure shot your wad, little fella, and throw him into the water. And he flipped three or four times and went circling down to the blue waters till he hit the bottom. Laid there just a few minutes. He come back up the top water and floed three or four times. his little fin straightened out like that, laid sideways, curled over and for about 20 minutes, us fishing, he done floated back into the wilderness, back up into some trash. And I was and someone said, "That little fish is really having a breakfast or feeding." I said, "Yes, that's right." And we said, "Oh, isn't God great?" Brother Wood said, "Oh, it's so great, Brother Brandham. We have the privilege of being here with you." Oh, I said, 'Don't think that, Brother Woods. THIS I SAID, IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT THE HOLY MOUNTAIN. It's not THE HOLY PLACE. IT'S THE HOLY GOD. &gt;&gt; NOT A HOLY MAN, BUT A HOLY GOD. &gt;&gt; And while we were talking, something moved on me. I'M GOING TO SHOW MY POWER OUT. Before I knew WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT, that scripture come to my mind. Whatsoever thou sayest, believe it shall come to pass in your heart. Say it and you will have what you say. I I just almost IT WAS FLOODING OUT OF ME. I THOUGHT, WHAT'S this going on? Lyn Bank sitting there. We were fishing. The little dead fish been laying about 20 minutes. All curled over there. floated back into the place. Little intros hanging out of his mouth. AND I LOOKED AT THAT LITTLE fish and the THOUGHT COME TO ME. HE SAID TO THE FISHERMAN, "CAST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOAT." THEY TOOK HIS WORD. PETER SAID, "LORD, WE FEAST ALL NIGHT AND TUCK NOTHING. NEVERTHELESS, AT YOUR WORD, YOU'LL tow the net." &gt;&gt; There it is. Afterward, something said to me, GOD KNOWS THE FISH. JUST SPEAK THE WORD AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT FISH. I said a little fish in the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST COME BACK TO LIFE AND GOD MY SOLEMN JUDGE OF THAT TWO MAN STAND THERE THAT LITTLE FISH TURNED ON HIS SIDE AND SWIM AWAY FROM AS HARD AS HE COULD GO ALIVE AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Speak the word. ALMIGHTY GOD AS I STAND HERE BEFORE HIM in the presence of this COMPANY AND THIS BIBLE KNOWS that's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHEN PEOPLE ARE DYING AND YET GOD SHOWED HIS POWER TO THOSE JU JEHOVAH WITNESS THAT HE IS THE RESURRECTION AND LIFE AND THERE'S NOTHING about God. &gt;&gt; Thou sayest and believe that what you say comes to pass. You will have what you say. &gt;&gt; What was it? God showing his power. Not me, just a vine or a branch. He energized the branch so I COULDN'T KEEP FROM UTTERING THEM VOICES. WHAT would I ever thought of a little dead fish laying there? Won't you eat me? I had him cut up and baited on the line. That little fish hanging there, LAYING THERE DEAD. MR. Wood sitting right here looking at me now, a witness of that. And the spirit of God swept down through that valley. AND THEN YOU THOUGHT THE RAPTURE WAS COMING. &gt;&gt; Even the Mr. Wood screamed out and said, "Oh, IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE." &gt;&gt; THAT BROTHER, WE'RE SO HAPPY TO BE HERE. THE ONLY EXPRESSION THEY could give was to me being their brother. And I turned quickly because they seem that God had USED ME TO SPEAK LIFE TO A FISH. And now that sounds crazy, BUT THAT'S THE SAME GOD THAT SPOKE LIFE TO THAT DEAD POSSIBLY IN THE EARLY YARD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE'S ALPHA AND OMEGA. THE BEGINNING AND THE END. HE'S THE LIFE, THE RESURRECTION. HE'S THE POWER OF THE everlasting one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Same yesterday and forever. &gt;&gt; That gives me to know this that someday WHEN LIFE IS GONE FOR THIS MORTAL BODY AND I'LL UNDERSTAND STILL. IF HE'S INTERESTED IN A FISH, SURELY HE'S INTERESTED IN me and you who are trying to serve him in some glorious day. God, &gt;&gt; not the branch, BUT THE VINE ITSELF WILL SPEAK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; From its headquarters in glory, those which are sleeping, Christ shall rise and go to everlasting life. &gt;&gt; What a feeling. No one could express it. WHEN YOU SEE A DEAD FISH LAYING ON THE WATER WITH HIS intros pulled through his mouth by a big-handed man who squeezed a fish like this and took it and wrenching, you hear tearing when he tore the entrance from the fish. Throw the little fell in the water. He quivered four or five times and kicked over and that was it. And see that little fell just in a moment of SPEAKING THAT WORD SWING HIMSELF BACK IN CONDITION JUST AS LOUD AS HE WAS and swung down through that water just as hard as he could go. &gt;&gt; Going back out to join his fellow fish. He's God. &gt;&gt; HE KNOW THAT PICTURE THERE. Just the same as he knowed that and had a coin in his mouth. &gt;&gt; JUST THE SAME AS HE KNOW IF YOU TOLD IF THOSE PEOPLE THEY SAY and St. Mark the fifth chapter. It said that Jesus barred Peter's boat there and went out fishing. Now I said let down for the draw and they fish. They know they fished all night and caught nothing. Just as we had done the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And caught nothing. But God wanted to see if they'd take his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said, "Let down the net for the draw." If there was no fish there taking God at his word, he'll put some there. &gt;&gt; That's all there was to it. &gt;&gt; Then that same God in his same character that was in the beginning is the same God, but the same character today. He's the first, the last, he's the same yet today and forever. &gt;&gt; He's still God. &gt;&gt; So you who were here this morning and prayed for him, let me tell you something. seeing these testimonies and God's witness whether they're true or not. &gt;&gt; That's right. You're looking for great things. You're trying to look over some great big something over here when it's right next to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. The very God that put the hunger in your soul to come be prayed for is the very same God that gave life to that fish. &gt;&gt; The very same God that stopped that bone in the field. The very same God that slayed that maniac there in my presence. The same God that brought Daniel from the lion's den. The same God that said cast your nets on this other side take for the draw. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. His works cannot fail. His character cannot fail. And his works declare his character. So he's arisen today and is here in our midst. The same yesterday, today, and forever. And we're witnesses of his character. &gt;&gt; His character has changed me when it come to be. I was once a sinner, and now I'm saved. I was once lost. Now I'm found. &gt;&gt; I once loved the things of the world. I hate it now. &gt;&gt; I once cared not for God. I love him now. &gt;&gt; Something happened to me. Something happened to you. What is it? It's God's work declaring his character. He loves us. He's interested in your welfare. He's interested in your healing. He's interested in your soul. Won't you let him have his way in your life? Don't you doubt him for nothing. You go believe in him and God will give you the desire of your heart for it's his good will to do it. He longs TO DO IT. BUT THE THING OF IT IS WE GET ALL FRUSTRATED. STAND STILL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Look at it. Say, "God, that means me." No matter who prays for me, what prays for me. It doesn't take a Oral Roberts, a Billy Grim, or a William Brandom or a Allen. It takes God. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; It takes your faith anchor in God. Say, "God, it is the truth. &gt;&gt; There alone I stand." And let let just keep in here until it drops down into here. From your head to your heart. It becomes a reality. Then it'll work. Only can it work when it comes to the heart. The Lord bless you. Now, while we bow our heads, put your desire on your heart. Place it before God right now. Will you do it while we pray? If it's for salvation, if it's for whatever it's for, you place it before God right now when we pray. My faith looks up to thee, thou lamb of Calary. Saveior. Now hear me what I pray. Take all my guilt away. Oh, let me from this day behold. While light dark may I tread. Get quiet now. and greets around me spread. Be thou my God. Be this turn today. wipe all my fears away. Nor let me ever stray from the far side. Blessed Lord, we could say like those who stood on the mount that day and said, "It's good for us to be here." And we would to build three tabernacles, put pastors in each. But the voice quickly turned and said, "Hear ye him. He's my son. Now, let us turn from pastors, from the Moses and the Elijah's and from the great man of the earth, although we're thankful for all of them. But you said first to hear him. And his word said this, not the pastor's word, neither the advances. Whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe you receive them. you shall have them. If you should say to this mountain, be moved and be cast into the sea, and don't doubt in your heart. But believe that what you say shall come to pass, you shall have what you say. Not necessarily would it be momentarily. Neither was it momentarily with Abraham and Sarah. But you said, "If you believe that what you say shall come to pass, you shall have what you say." Now, Father, here's our prayer. Take us just now. take our hearts into thy hands and squeeze them real tight with love, pushing all of the fear and unbelief from them, making them hollow and empty. and then fill him immediately with thy spirit as the tar and pitch went into the ark to keep fear and doubt from ever coming to our hearts again. And make us of thy workmanship that you might declare your character to the world through us as written epistles read of all men. May everyone that was been anointed, that's what you said, do may they be healed today from every person from the common tooth ache till the blind, afflicted, or whatever it might be. May that faith anchor now into that heart that was fearing and doubting when it come in. No God, I'll always remember myself. We three men as Peter, James, and John stood on Mount Transfiguration and seen what you did there. We'll never forget that little cove down Fanny Creek as long as we have memories and recollections. It might not mean much to the world, but when we seen the omnipotence of God, the ominate presence of the living God, move down and have sympathy enough upon mankind to show your power to bringing the little fish that was dead on the waters back to life again. That goes plum over the top of a skeptic or an unbeliever. But how it registers in the Christian heart. We know that they aren't God. You're the same God here in this room this morning. How much more do you care for the people in this room of men and women as you do for a little fish? What did that little fish mean to you? Nothing. Just declaring your word. And I pray God that you'll declare your works in every man and woman, boy and girl in here today. If there be some your Lord who does not know you as their savior have not yet experienced and would want to empty their heart out today from all the things of the trash of the world that you might fill their heart with love as Noah did the ark with the pitch. I pray that you'll deal with them in these fleeting minutes now that's left in the program. Grant it father through Jesus name. And while our heads are bowed, may thy rich grace impart strength to my fainting heart, my seal inspired. Now, if you want Christ while they're singing, want to empty up your heart this morning and God to take you just as you are there, would you raise your hand to him? Say, "Remember me." God bless you, sir. You, sir. You, sister. You, brother. You. Someone else over on my right. Raise your hand. God bless you, sister. Someone else say, "I want to empty my heart." God bless you, sister back there. Let me from this day be holy. Someone else wants to raise your hand now just before prayer. Father God, you've seen every hand seven or eight 10 hands went up. They're now emptying out all their fears and unbelief. They're now claiming thee as their allsufficient one, as their lover, as their savior, as their healer. All doubts and fears, they're desiring to be taken from them. I pray that you'll grant it, Lord, by your great grace. Let it happen just today. You could speak life to a fish, speak life to a little dead boy, speak life to Elijah Perry laying there dead and his hands crossed. speak life to a little dead baby out in Mexico, spoke life gather in Lazarus after being dead four days. How much more can we take our stand today on the rock of his eternal word and look beyond this shadow of doubt to him that said, "I am the resurrection and life." May faith take its resting place now on him, that solid rock, Christ. And may they receive everything that they've asked for. hear our prayers as we pray in Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. I love him. I love him. He pray my salary. &gt;&gt; I'll always sing again. Shake hands with someone near you. Just sit still. Now we're service. It's not over yet. I love my God. You feel all scoured out. You feel better now. &gt;&gt; You feel like the word. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's it's a cleansing blood and Lord Jesus that goes right through the heart, cleanses us from all sin and iniquity. for just my &gt;&gt; now brother Neville tonight. Amen. We thank God for that. So so powerful. There's a prayer request for brother Dave Cook Junior that is is um he's got some decisions to make on his treatment here a year or so ago or some time ago. There was a a pretty aggressive tumor found in him that the doctors can't operate. Um they couldn't take it out. It was too complicated. And then um my if that was you, you would surely want the saints to pray with you. And our God is God. He's the healer. So, we're going to take him to the Lord in prayer. Um, also my wife will be traveling back on Saturday to come back home, keep her in prayer. And, um, remember the Saints, Brother Art's family that started those Bible studies there and um, the Lord is really dealing with them, some of the young people in that. So, pray for them.

So God bless you saints and um I've been blessed by being here amongst you. The way you sing when I said the other night that I think you sing better than us I meant it and I thank the Lord for his presence while I was here and I'm taking everything back home. Sometimes, you know, when a song is sung here, and I'm thinking of uh them back home, like uh the one song that was sung just before the last one that the brother sang here. Uh oh, he knows my name. My daughter loved that one so much. So, I just thought, let me take a clip of that one. Well, please do pray for me. Pray for us. We'll be in touch all the time. I'll give report of what is taking place over there and I think I'm going back to my radio ministry and uh some other things I had I'll call it a privilege when I was over in Jeffersonville we were going with brother u William Linger he hosted me in his home and we were going to the sides and I had time to share a lot of testimony ies with him and him with me. And uh on Wednesday evening, we went to the Branam tabernacle to go and pray. They opened and I was so glad. I saw so many saints there. The parking lot was full, the one behind the building and the one in the opposite street. And after that, the brother asked me if I could go with him to the hospital and go and pray for a brother that's suffering with cancer. His name is Brother Andy Holy. So I went in there. I quoted brother Brennham. In fact, I didn't quote brother Brennan. I quoted what the angel said to brother Brennham that nothing will stand against his prayers &gt;&gt; and the angel said not even cancer. So I go to the I read some scriptures and I prayed for the brother. Well I don't doubt the Lord will heal the brother. I just asked the church to to pray with me for the brother. I just after 3 days I was in Connecticut then I received a report that the mother had seen the brother and he's she says he's made a miraulous turn for the better. Amen. I even asked the brother to take a picture because that thing's protruding like this on his neck. But I said, "Brother, take a picture of that. When it goes away, give me another picture." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us pray, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you so much tonight Lord that we could be in your house Lord and truly Lord what you said in your word is nothing but the truth Lord that where two or three are gathered in your name, you are there. We heard dear God from our prophet this evening Lord as he was stressing those wonderful words Lord dear Jesus we believe and we know Lord it's true Lord you spoke Lord it was not him speaking Lord it was you speaking through him Lord and he spoke life into that dead fish Lord not only the fish Lord many other things took place Lord I can imagine those brothers that were there with him that day, Lord. Hallelujah. When that holy hush, Lord, that spirit, Lord, was in that valley, Lord, until the brother said, "It's so good to be here." Thank you so much tonight, Lord, that your saints came in the house, Lord, to come, Lord, and offer these supplications and prayers before you, Lord God. Touch all those that were mentioned here, Lord, that are sick. Oh, dear Jesus. Those tumors are nothing to you. Lord, you know where it comes from, Lord. Our prophet said, "Sometimes you don't make Lord an immediate miraculous healing, Lord, but you reverse, Lord, that sickness back to where it comes from. Thank you so much, Lord. Go with us, Lord, as we leave your house now, Lord. Let that fire burn in us, oh Lord. Dear Jesus, bless the pastor, Lord. Bless the deacons of the church, Lord. Those prayer warriors, Lord, that are here tonight. Our sisters, Lord, our brothers, each and everyone, Lord, those that are streaming from home, Lord, and away from home in different places, Lord.
