[29:11] verses 30
[29:14] 9 and 40. Of course, we know these are
[29:16] the heroes of the faith. Those that were
[29:18] mentioned and they are laid out there
[29:22] what they did and they all did it by
[29:25] faith. And Hebrews
[29:33] 11 verse 38 of whom the world was not
[29:36] worthy. They wandered in deserts and in
[29:39] mountains and in dens and in caves of
[29:42] the earth. And these all having obtained
[29:45] a good report through faith received not
[29:48] the promise. God having provided some
[29:51] better thing for us that they without us
[29:55] should not be made perfect. Amen. Mark
[30:00] 11 23.
[30:15] You have that you can say amen.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse
[30:22] 22, we sing that song, have faith in
[30:25] God, for the answer. Those are the words
[30:28] of our Lord Jesus. In verse 22, Jesus
[30:31] answered and said unto them, have faith
[30:34] in God. For verily I say unto you, that
[30:37] whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
[30:41] be thou moved, removed, and be thou cast
[30:44] into the sea, and shall not doubt in his
[30:47] heart, but shall believe that those
[30:49] things which he saith shall come to
[30:51] pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore I say unto you, what
[30:59] things soever you desire when you pray,
[31:02] believe that you receive them, and ye
[31:04] shall have them. Amen. May God add a
[31:08] blessing to the reading of his most holy
[31:11] word. God bless you. You may be seated.
[31:13] Now, this word paradox, as brother
[31:15] Brandham defines it from Webster,
[31:18] uh something unbelievable but true.
[31:23] and other de definitions going further
[31:27] with that it's from the Greek it's a
[31:30] Greek origin the two words Napa and um
[31:35] doa it means besides or beyond or
[31:39] contrary to opinion expectation
[31:44] or a belief
[31:46] it's a statement or situation that
[31:48] appears contradictory
[31:51] or impossible at first yet reveals a
[31:54] deeper truth when it's understood.
[31:57] That's what a paradox is.
[32:00] Seemingly contradiction that is actually
[32:04] true.
[32:05] And brother Madam could have titled this
[32:08] message Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[32:10] today, and forever. Or these signs shall
[32:13] follow them that believe. You could
[32:15] entitle it any um series of supernatural
[32:19] statements, but he uses the word paradox
[32:24] and um
[32:26] he takes from his scripture and from the
[32:30] testimony of Joshua where he commands
[32:33] the son to stand still. He says his
[32:35] daughter Rebecca comes to him and says,
[32:38] "Daddy, that means Joshua stopped the
[32:41] earth."
[32:43] And he tells he says because if you the
[32:46] sun doesn't actually move. It's the
[32:48] earth that's moving. This is his
[32:50] daughter Rebecca. Brother Bham says well
[32:53] it's the shadow of the sun that's moving
[32:55] on the earth.
[32:58] That's what Joshua stopped.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; And no matter how you slice it or how
[33:03] you say it, stop the sun, stop the
[33:06] earth, we know that for 24 hours the sun
[33:10] stood still. the shadow all time stood
[33:14] still was a paradox. And the brother ran
[33:17] goes forward in this message and brings
[33:20] up David how he defeated Goliath.
[33:24] Of course, Samson, one man against a
[33:26] thousand.
[33:28] Micah the prophet against the school of
[33:31] the prophets, one against many was a
[33:34] paradox. The scripture that we read in
[33:38] Markap 11, the prophet of God tells us
[33:41] that that scripture is a paradox.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; If you look at what a paradox is, if
[33:49] you're a Christian today,
[33:52] look in the mirror, that is a paradox.
[33:59] [clears throat]
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Those of you that have been forgiven for
[34:01] much
[34:02] &gt;&gt; know exactly what I'm talking about.
[34:05] If you've been forgiven for much, you
[34:08] know what it means to be forgiven. And
[34:12] you know what Calvary means to you.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Unbelievable, but true.
[34:18] This um uh message here, Brother Badam
[34:22] takes in paragraph 104. I'll just get
[34:24] right into it and read a few places and
[34:26] just encourage your heart. We heard the
[34:28] tape and we'll I'll read from it again
[34:32] just to highlight a few of these things.
[34:35] In paragraph 104 in the message paradox
[34:38] just above that he says incredible yet
[34:40] it is so true for he is Jehovah Gyra.
[34:44] Incredible things to our knowledge and
[34:47] science but yet it is true a great
[34:51] paradox.
[34:53] It was a paradox and will be when Jesus
[34:57] Mark 11:22 and 23 when he said if you
[35:00] say to this mountain be moved and don't
[35:02] doubt in your heart but believe that
[35:05] what you have said will come to pass you
[35:08] can have what you said. It's incredible
[35:12] but it's true. It's a paradox.
[35:17] So a paradox is not a lie. It's not a
[35:20] mistake.
[35:22] It's not nonsense. It is actually true,
[35:26] &gt;&gt; but it doesn't appear to be true.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; It's really uh like a mystery being
[35:31] revealed.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Like for Noah to stand and say it's
[35:36] going to rain when it never rained
[35:38] before.
[35:39] For a man to say, "I've got the power to
[35:42] lay my life down and the power to bring
[35:44] it up again." Well, nobody's ever seen
[35:46] that done before.
[35:48] for a prophet to say a virgin shall
[35:52] conceive.
[35:54] Unbelievable. Medically, scientifically,
[35:58] we have no history of it. But yet, it is
[36:00] true.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; That is a paradox.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; This Bible is a paradox.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Everything about your salvation is a
[36:10] paradox.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; The God that we serve is the God of the
[36:15] paradox. This falls right in line with
[36:18] our burden on our heart from last
[36:20] Wednesday on a sovereign move of God.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; When God moves down and pours out his
[36:27] blessing and his Holy Spirit upon one
[36:30] individual, there's nobody that can stop
[36:32] that.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; There's nobody that can make it happen
[36:36] &gt;&gt; or stop it from happening.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; And we want it to happen in our lives.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; We want it to happen to everybody.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if it doesn't happen to
[36:46] everybody, Lord, let it happen to me.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Open it up to me is my prayer.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; Now, we desire those things, don't we?
[36:56] &gt;&gt; We long to see those things take place.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; And um you know, the the the the the
[37:04] scripture tells us that he will give us
[37:07] the desires of our heart.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; There's a promise there. Delight
[37:13] yourself in the Lord and he will give
[37:16] you the desires of your heart.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Now um we want to remind oursel of these
[37:24] things. We want to approach the God that
[37:26] we serve as the supernatural God. He has
[37:30] the final say. So
[37:31] &gt;&gt; it is not your boss. It's not your
[37:34] career. It's not the neighborhood you
[37:36] live in. It's not your inadequacies.
[37:38] It's not any of that. He has the final
[37:41] say. So,
[37:43] &gt;&gt; and if God moves it, it will be moved.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; If God establishes it, it will be
[37:49] established.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; So many times we are afraid of people
[37:54] who have no power over our life. That's
[37:56] &gt;&gt; right.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; God is in control of our lives, saints.
[38:00] He is the one who gives us the blessing
[38:02] to succeed or the strength. He's the
[38:06] lifegiver.
[38:07] He's the one that blesses you in your
[38:11] health.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Thank God for doctors. Thank God for the
[38:15] multivitamin. Thank God for eating good
[38:18] foods, but he really is the lifegiver.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; If you live somewhere and you wasn't
[38:26] eating a balanced diet, but what you was
[38:29] eating was blessed by God, I think
[38:30] you'll be okay.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness?
[38:34] &gt;&gt; He's in control of all of that. Yeah.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Now, we don't live recklessly and we
[38:38] don't go out here and do things that's
[38:39] contrary, but keep it where it needs to
[38:42] be kept.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; The Lord is the healer of our bodies.
[38:46] The Lord is in charge of all that we
[38:49] have, all that we say, all that we do.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; It is his church.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; It's not brother Israel's church or
[38:57] Reverend so andso's church. It is God's
[39:00] church.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; And he said he would build that church
[39:04] upon the rock.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. That my brother, my sister, is a
[39:07] paradox. Look at the different kinds of
[39:09] people that are in this building
[39:10] tonight. The different backgrounds.
[39:14] Some come from different kinds of homes
[39:16] and religious, you know, uh uh uh uh uh
[39:20] influences, but we're all in the same
[39:22] room tonight.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; It's like the rabbit in the hair.
[39:28] At the end of the day, we're still ended
[39:30] up in the same room.
[39:33] I might have been smarter than you or
[39:34] vice versa or you might have more money
[39:36] than me, but we're still in the same
[39:37] room.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; And I trust we're going to the same
[39:42] heaven.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; The God that we serve is the one that's
[39:45] in control of everything.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; So when a Christian falls down on their
[39:49] knees,
[39:51] it's
[39:54] it's really the realm of the the
[39:59] impossible can take place.
[40:02] When a believer begins to pray, that's
[40:05] what this meeting is. It's a it's an
[40:07] oldfashioned prayer meeting, the
[40:08] Wednesday
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Wednesday night prayer meeting where the
[40:12] paradoxes can take place.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; Something supernatural can happen in our
[40:18] lives. Amen.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Hear what the prophet of God says here
[40:21] in paragraph 123 in this message.
[40:29] Oh, the only thing God is waiting on
[40:31] now, I believe Russia don't mean nothing
[40:35] to God. He wants to get one man. He
[40:38] don't have to have a big organizations.
[40:41] He don't have to have big denomination.
[40:43] He wants to get one man that he can wrap
[40:46] his spirit into him that will tell the
[40:49] rest of it. There will be another
[40:51] paradox until he can get someone
[40:55] completely surrendered that will do
[40:58] that. That's the way God does his work.
[41:02] He uses paradox.
[41:06] It was a paradox when a great soldier by
[41:09] the name of Jehoshaphat stood in the
[41:11] gates with a backsliding man by the name
[41:13] of Ahab and said, "Before we go to this
[41:16] battle, it's not a good thing that is it
[41:19] is it not a good thing that consult the
[41:21] Lord." Now, if that man's heart is
[41:24] hungry to know the will of God, there's
[41:29] got to be a will of God somewhere.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; How many can thank God for that? How
[41:36] many need to know the will of God
[41:38] &gt;&gt; on so many levels of our life? You're
[41:41] going to get married, you got a career,
[41:43] you know, this house or this whatever it
[41:46] is, whatever the decision you are faced
[41:49] with in your life. I'm faced with them.
[41:51] You're faced with them. You want to know
[41:52] the will of God, the perfect will of
[41:54] God. And if a man wants to know the will
[41:56] of God, there is a perfect will of God
[42:01] for that man.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. I don't want to make an
[42:04] intellectual decision.
[42:07] I don't want to make a carnal decision.
[42:09] I want to make uh decisions based on the
[42:11] perfect will of God.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; That he's revealed to me. Amen.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; And there is a will of God for a man to
[42:19] know. Paragraph 136, the prophet of God
[42:21] continues here. It says this. He took Ma
[42:26] Micah instead of a well-trained school
[42:28] of ministers, renowned men. Nothing
[42:31] against him. They were great men. They
[42:34] were men who believed in not another
[42:36] god. They believed in the same god Micah
[42:39] believed in. But they've acted like they
[42:42] believed it but wouldn't take his word
[42:46] because they wanted to be popular. They
[42:49] wanted to find favor with the king and
[42:52] their blindness overlooked the true word
[42:55] of God. How could God bless what he had
[42:59] cursed? And that's a very striking uh
[43:04] set of two items there that they wanted
[43:08] to find favor with man
[43:12] and really our favor is with the Lord.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Um uh influence is a strong thing.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Influence is a powerful thing.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; And um whether we know it or not, we all
[43:26] are being influenced by something.
[43:29] and and and and whenever God is going to
[43:32] use you or or bless you in any kind of
[43:34] way, he uses men to do that.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Think about it real good. Blessings
[43:40] don't fall out of heaven in in a ball of
[43:43] fire. And he uses men,
[43:47] &gt;&gt; uses people, mamas, daddies, brothers
[43:50] and sisters. He said, "Lord, I need a
[43:53] blessing." And then some brother will
[43:54] call you.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, I need encouragement. And that
[43:57] some sister will call you. He uses
[44:00] people. That's his agency. That's what
[44:02] he uses.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; He uses you.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; I get a witness.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; He uses men.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; And you can't serve the Lord without
[44:15] serving people.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; And you've got to have people in your
[44:19] realm
[44:20] &gt;&gt; as you serve the Lord. You serve people.
[44:23] You serve the Lord. If I can't love you,
[44:25] can't say I love the Lord.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[44:28] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's it's directly connected.
[44:31] It's easy to say, "I just love you,
[44:33] Lord." But you have problems with
[44:35] people. And we all have people problems.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; And Yes. Amen.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; We all have people problems every now
[44:43] and then. Let's be honest. And and we
[44:46] are the problem many times.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Can we all say amen to that?
[44:51] &gt;&gt; You've never been the problem before.
[44:54] That's a problem if you think that that
[44:56] is a problem.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Every one of us have been
[45:00] the problem.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Keep it real.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; But you know, the God that we serve uses
[45:07] us and he uses the problems and he uses
[45:10] the agency of men and women to carry out
[45:15] his plan. He's got a purpose and he uses
[45:19] that and he's trying to get a hold of
[45:22] one man, one woman that he can pour his
[45:25] spirit into and make that individual a
[45:29] paradox. And you know with that we have
[45:33] to be very careful because we so lean on
[45:36] one another that we don't let people
[45:41] influence us away from the word of the
[45:43] Lord because that influence is very very
[45:47] strong. If I were to take five people
[45:50] that and I just paid them to praise the
[45:52] Lord the way I say they should praise
[45:54] him and set him in this church. Those
[45:57] five people will probably influence a
[45:59] number of other people.
[46:00] just on a carnal level because people
[46:02] look around, they start seeing and they
[46:04] get influenced.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. And these men, they
[46:08] were blinded. They were blinded to the
[46:11] word because of their popularity and
[46:14] they wanted to be in good graces and
[46:17] find favor with the king. We want to
[46:20] stay in favor with the King of Kings and
[46:22] Lord of Lords.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to be able to really lean
[46:27] on the word of the Lord as our absolute.
[46:30] And we'll see that how important that is
[46:32] as the day goes on,
[46:34] &gt;&gt; as these days move on, having an
[46:36] absolute and that absolute coming out of
[46:39] the word of the Lord and letting that be
[46:42] your influence and God will bless you
[46:45] and use you and then now he can separate
[46:48] you and make you a paradox.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; That's what we desire.
[46:54] Amen. The prophet continues on and says
[46:57] this paragraph 138. Men,
[47:01] you who can't rule your own house and
[47:04] then try to be preachers and deacons.
[47:08] How are you fit to be a preacher in the
[47:10] pull pit to lead the church of the
[47:12] living God and to divide for them their
[47:16] inheritance when you think more of your
[47:18] meal ticket and the offering that comes
[47:20] in than you do the word of God? and
[47:24] ashamed to say it before the women,
[47:26] afraid you won't be popular. God have
[47:30] mercy on your sinful soul.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Speak the word of God in truth. John
[47:36] said, "The axe is laid to the root of
[47:38] the tree, and the axe is the word of
[47:40] God. Every tree that don't bring forth
[47:42] the right fruit, he down and cast it
[47:45] into the fire, God bring us another
[47:50] paradox."
[47:51] So, what is he referring to in this
[47:53] scripture? Now, this isn't a deacon's
[47:56] meeting or a preachers's meeting, but
[47:58] this is a scripture he's referring to in
[48:00] First Timothy chapter 3. If we could
[48:03] turn there quickly, and
[48:07] this is what the word of the Lord says.
[48:10] That was on the tape Sunday morning. I
[48:12] hope we got this right.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; I'm just slowing it down a little bit as
[48:17] I'm reading it to you slowly. We all
[48:20] heard it. We all said amen to it
[48:23] &gt;&gt; in theory. Some of our amens are very
[48:26] quiet.
[48:28] Some of them are, you know, but we all
[48:29] are believers here. So, believers say
[48:31] amen to the word. It's not always
[48:33] verbal, but I I believe that the saints
[48:36] here are are in agreement
[48:39] &gt;&gt; with what the word of the Lord says.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Whether you say amen or not, I believe
[48:43] you you're in agreement with that.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; So, these things are true. So, let's
[48:47] slow it down just a little bit. And
[48:49] here, Brother Ratom is talking about a
[48:51] man ruling his own house. Before we read
[48:55] the scripture, let me think of this just
[48:57] for a moment. If the man can't rule his
[49:00] own house, and that's his own house. I'm
[49:04] talking about his own tabernacle. He
[49:07] can't rule his own physical house
[49:09] either.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; So, it starts somewhere, doesn't it? So
[49:13] if you don't if you're not in control of
[49:15] your tabernacle, you sure can't control
[49:17] a tabernacle at home.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm so glad I'm not a deacon."
[49:21] No, that's for everybody.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Every man, every believer
[49:27] &gt;&gt; needs to be able to know how to possess
[49:30] and contain his own vessel
[49:33] &gt;&gt; as a believer.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; So controlling his own house. Let's take
[49:37] the scripture here. 1 Timothy 3. This is
[49:40] a true saying. If a man desire office of
[49:42] a bishop, what does he desireth? A what?
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Good work.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; A good work.
[49:49] Not a stressful work. Not a bad work.
[49:52] The Bible calls it a good Everybody
[49:54] smile and say good work.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Good work.
[49:59] A bishop then must be blameless. The
[50:02] husband of one wife, viligent, vigilant,
[50:06] sober of good behavior, given to
[50:09] hospitality, apt to teach, not given to
[50:13] whine, no striker, not greedy or filthy
[50:16] lucer, but patient, not a brawler, not
[50:21] covetous, one that ruleth well his own
[50:25] house, having his what? children
[50:28] &gt;&gt; in subjection with all gravity. For a
[50:32] man not know not how to rule his own
[50:35] house, how shall he take care of the
[50:38] church of God? Not a novice or newcomer
[50:42] or believer
[50:44] less or or that word novice or newly
[50:47] planted. That word means that not a
[50:49] novice less being lifted up in pride you
[50:52] fall into condemnation of the devil.
[50:55] Moreover, he must have a good report of
[50:58] them which are without, lest he fall
[51:01] into reproach and the snare of the
[51:03] devil. Likewise must the deacons be
[51:06] graved, not double tonged, what? Not
[51:11] given to too much wine, not greedy or
[51:15] filthy lucer, holding the mystery of the
[51:18] faith in a pure conscience. Let these
[51:20] also first be proved, then let them use
[51:23] the office of the deacon, being found
[51:28] blameless.
[51:30] Even so must their wives be
[51:34] grave,
[51:36] not slanderous,
[51:40] sober,
[51:42] faithful in some things,
[51:46] &gt;&gt; faithful in all things.
[51:50] Let the deacon be the husband of one
[51:52] wife, ruling their children and their
[51:55] own houses
[51:58] well.
[51:59] For they that use the office of a deacon
[52:02] well purchase to themselves a good
[52:04] degree and great boldness in the faith
[52:06] which is Christ Jesus. You know the
[52:09] scripture on the bishop and on the
[52:11] deacon says that they must be blameless.
[52:16] Right?
[52:16] &gt;&gt; You know that that that uh qualification
[52:19] of blameless isn't just to the deacons.
[52:23] It's to the believers as well.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; I don't have it with me because I wasn't
[52:27] going to bring this but
[52:30] I want to bring it right now. Okay.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Let me just bring this
[52:35] word blameless just for a moment. If I I
[52:38] remember bringing it some time ago. the
[52:41] Lord will help me.
[52:47] That's of course if you all are okay
[52:48] with that.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; All right.
[52:55] Philippians 2:15.
[53:00] Verse 14 says what?
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Do all things without
[53:11] I thought it was only the deacons and
[53:12] their wives
[53:15] without murmurings and what
[53:19] &gt;&gt; disputings.
[53:22] Are these the scriptures?
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Are these the ones we highlight or we
[53:25] don't highlight? Are these are less
[53:27] important or these are the more
[53:28] important scriptures or are they all
[53:31] important?
[53:32] &gt;&gt; This is your B. This is my Bible.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; And and the scripture says this that ye
[53:37] may be what?
[53:40] Who talking to the deacons?
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Everybody.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Everybody.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; That they may be blameless and harmless,
[53:49] the sons of God without rebuke in the
[53:52] midst of a crooked and perverse nation
[53:54] among whom he shine as lights in the
[53:57] world, holding forth the word of life,
[54:01] that I may rejoice in the day of Christ.
[54:04] Amen.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Can I go a little bit further?
[54:08] I think there's one more in there. 1
[54:11] Thessalonians 5:23
[54:15] says this.
[54:18] Verse 21 says, "Prove all things." Okay,
[54:22] let's let's go up a little closer. Verse
[54:24] 18.
[54:26] Oh, it's so good. Verse 17.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Let's take verse 16. [laughter]
[54:33] Let's read it. It says, "Rejoice ever
[54:35] more. Pray without
[54:38] &gt;&gt; ceasing
[54:40] &gt;&gt; and everything. Give
[54:42] &gt;&gt; complain about it.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Stress about it. Talk no. Give thanks.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; For this is the will of God in Christ
[54:49] Jesus concerning you.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Quench not the spirit.
[54:55] Despise not prophesyings.
[54:57] Prove all things. Hold fast that which
[54:59] is good. Abstain from all appearance of
[55:03] evil. Yes.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; And the very God of peace sanctify you
[55:07] holy. And I pray God your whole spirit
[55:09] and soul and body be preserved
[55:13] blameless
[55:15] &gt;&gt; until the coming of our Lord Jesus
[55:18] Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you,
[55:22] who also will do it. It is the will of
[55:27] God for our hearts and our lives as
[55:31] believers to be blameless.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; That's in the word of the Lord.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; But this is brother Brandham is he
[55:42] starts to get on the preachers and the
[55:44] deacons how they can't rule their own
[55:46] house
[55:49] and how can they rule the house of God
[55:52] be leaders in the house of God. how
[55:54] their home, their children must be in
[55:57] subjection.
[56:00] So is this saying to all the other
[56:02] brothers who have children that their
[56:05] children should not be sub subject? It's
[56:08] not what it's saying. Not what it's
[56:09] saying.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; But it's highlights this office and
[56:15] really puts the squeeze on it. I mean
[56:18] for a man to be blameless any man in
[56:21] this age it will take a paradox
[56:25] &gt;&gt; that is a supernatural work
[56:28] &gt;&gt; that has to be the Holy Ghost coming
[56:31] down
[56:33] &gt;&gt; tell me a man who can be blameless
[56:35] without the Holy Ghost moving in his
[56:37] life
[56:38] &gt;&gt; huh
[56:40] &gt;&gt; it doesn't happen this is not a carnal
[56:42] okay I'm going to be a good boy this
[56:43] week this is not what this is
[56:46] &gt;&gt; this is a sovereign
[56:48] work of God. The Holy Ghost coming down
[56:52] on a man on a woman and changing them.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; A PARADOX
[56:59] &gt;&gt; LIKE JOSHUA stopped the sun, the Holy
[57:02] SPIRIT WILL STOP THE foolishness in your
[57:04] life.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord Jesus. Amen.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. All right. So, let's move forward.
[57:14] Okay. Now, the prophet of God goes a
[57:18] little further in this message.
[57:22] In paragraph 145, he says this here.
[57:27] Just got a few more moments and I'll be
[57:32] &gt;&gt; paragraph 144. But it was a paradox how
[57:34] it got. Why didn't he come down to that
[57:37] be big school up there at Jerusalem? Why
[57:40] didn't he come to Caif as the high
[57:42] priest? Why did he not come to some of
[57:45] those great trained men who had been
[57:47] trained from childhood and their fathers
[57:51] had been trained before them? Their
[57:53] fathers before them for generation after
[57:56] generation after generation trained and
[58:00] schooled fine high culture educated and
[58:04] then pick an old man out in the
[58:06] wilderness that never had a day
[58:08] schooling in his life. set him out there
[58:11] on the Jordan and said, "This is him." A
[58:15] paradox. Exactly.
[58:17] Uncredible, but yet IT WAS TRUE.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; GOD DID IT. The virgin birth of our
[58:24] Lord. Incredible
[58:26] for a woman to bring a child without
[58:28] KNOWING A MAN. GOD DID IT.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; GOD DID IT. SEE, IT'S A PARADOX. Took a
[58:34] little old woman down there, a little
[58:36] old girl, engaged to some man about 45
[58:39] years old. She herself was about 16 or
[58:42] 18, engaged to this man who was a
[58:45] widowerower of four children, and then
[58:48] took THIS WOMAN AND OVERSHADOWED HER BY
[58:50] THE HOLY SPIRIT, and conceived in her
[58:54] womb the body that tabernacled
[58:57] Almighty God, a paradox.
[59:01] Amen. I love that.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; The supernatural God has to be made
[59:07] manifested in our assemblies. Yeah,
[59:10] &gt;&gt; that's a must.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; That is not an option.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about God's church. I'm not
[59:16] talking about somebody else's church.
[59:18] I'm talking about God's church is ruled
[59:22] and reigned by the supernatural.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; God's church, God's Bible, God's message
[59:28] that he sent to us is a supernatural
[59:31] message,
[59:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:33] &gt;&gt; And the believers that follow it are
[59:36] supernatural or should be. And our
[59:39] hearts and our thoughts and our
[59:42] expectations should be for the
[59:44] supernatural to happen in our mix.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; You know, people try to challenge what
[59:50] you believe or they try to push against
[59:54] what you believe and maybe you fall out
[59:56] of favor with them on the job or
[59:59] wherever it may be. Unsaved loved ones,
[1:00:02] whatever it may be. But you know God has
[1:00:04] got got your back. Amen.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Did you know the angels are with you?
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Do you know that there's more with you
[1:00:13] than there is AGAINST YOU?
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; THAT THERE IS NOTHING CAN STOP A TRUE
[1:00:19] BELIEVER
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT BELIEVER is a paradox.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; It's supernatural all the way through.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; You think you know this intellectual age
[1:00:29] that we live in, we argue so much. The
[1:00:32] podcast is argument. the the the the the
[1:00:35] dialogue in religion, the doctrines is
[1:00:38] argument. There they say three gods, we
[1:00:42] say one. Even in the message, it's a
[1:00:44] argument constantly.
[1:00:46] We believe we believe it's literal. Some
[1:00:48] believe it's fear. IT'S A ARGUMENT. BUT
[1:00:50] WHEN GOD COMES DOWN
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; AND MANIFEST HIMSELF,
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; there's nothing to argue about.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; When you have thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:01:01] there's nothing to argue about. You just
[1:01:03] preach what thus sayeth the Lord is.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we don't have no opinion
[1:01:08] other than God's opinion. Is that right?
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; So you can walk up to the pull pit with
[1:01:12] a full clean heart and just say what the
[1:01:15] Bible says.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Say what the message says.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then everybody will love you
[1:01:22] and your church will be full. Right?
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; NO.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; HE WILL LOVE YOU THOUGH.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; That's what matters. Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a paradox for God to open our
[1:01:38] eyes. And this is what we want. This is
[1:01:41] what I'm not interested in arguing. I'm
[1:01:44] interested in God manifesting himself in
[1:01:47] my life. God is looking for one
[1:01:49] individual, one man, one woman. Here
[1:01:52] what he says in paragraph
[1:01:55] 156
[1:01:59] talking about Samson with the jawbone
[1:02:02] 155. So this little fellow was standing
[1:02:04] out there and all at once here come
[1:02:06] these Philistines and surrounded him to
[1:02:09] kill him. And he took the jawbone of a
[1:02:11] mule that was laying there, a wild one
[1:02:14] of little donkeys, picked up the jawbone
[1:02:17] of that mule, and the spirit of the Lord
[1:02:19] came on him, and there was a paradox.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; How that he beat down with the jawbone
[1:02:26] of a mule, threw that half inch thick
[1:02:30] helmet over the top of the head with the
[1:02:32] jawbone of a mule. Why? The first that
[1:02:35] old dry jaw jawbone laying there, the
[1:02:38] first lick he would have have hit, it
[1:02:41] would have bursted into a thousand
[1:02:42] pieces over the top of those helmets or
[1:02:45] those big shields. When a thousand
[1:02:47] rushed in upon him, he beat every one of
[1:02:50] them to death. Paradox. That's when the
[1:02:53] spirit of God come upon him. Oh, if we
[1:02:58] could only be jawbones in the hand of
[1:03:01] God, there would be another paradox.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, it was.
[1:03:08] If you were sitting in the stands that
[1:03:10] day from a distance watching this battle
[1:03:13] and you saw this one man going up
[1:03:15] against these Philistines
[1:03:18] and you see this man begin to shake
[1:03:20] himself and move himself, a little bitty
[1:03:22] guy. You're like, man, what's this guy
[1:03:24] doing? He start to get himself together
[1:03:27] and he reaches over, grabs the draw and
[1:03:29] you and you're looking at all of this,
[1:03:30] you be like, man, they going to smoke
[1:03:33] him. A few minutes he poof, he'll be
[1:03:36] gone. But then something happened. HE
[1:03:39] GRABS HIS JAWBONE AND THEN BOOM, BOOM,
[1:03:41] BOOM. Five men fall. Boom, boom, boom.
[1:03:44] 10,
[1:03:46] 100,
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; 200, 300,
[1:03:50] 400.
[1:03:54] At some point the Philistines, if he's a
[1:03:56] smart Philistine,
[1:03:58] he'd be like, you know, today ain't our
[1:04:00] day.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Let's go, let's go back and be the one
[1:04:04] to tell the story what happened.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; OR YOU CAN TRY TO CHANGE SOMETHING THAT
[1:04:10] CAN'T BE CHANGED.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; You know, if it was a thousand, IF IT
[1:04:13] WAS 2,000, IF IT WAS 5,000, THIS MAN IS
[1:04:17] NOT GOING TO LOSE.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; WHY? He was a paradox.
[1:04:22] Unbelievable.
[1:04:23] INCREDIBLE. [screaming]
[1:04:24] UNBELIEVABLE.
[1:04:26] BUT YET IT was true.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; It's written in the word. It's recorded
[1:04:31] right there.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to be. A paradox.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Unbelievable.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; But yet it's still true.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, if we can be
[1:04:46] only be a paradox. Let me take this last
[1:04:49] one in paragraph 161.
[1:04:52] 163
[1:04:54] prophet of God says this here when God
[1:04:57] took a bunch of ignoramises
[1:05:02] as we call them today holy rollers poor
[1:05:05] of this world's goods poured out the
[1:05:07] Holy Ghost on them in the upper room
[1:05:10] instead of pouring it out upon the
[1:05:12] Sanhadrin council where all the
[1:05:15] theologians sit where all the great men
[1:05:18] was where the head of all the churches
[1:05:20] were the ones that had studied in the
[1:05:23] scriptures and had made a great school
[1:05:26] well trained and waiting for the coming
[1:05:29] Messiah and knowing that they would be
[1:05:32] the one who would walk out and meet him
[1:05:35] and say, "Messiah, you come down as if
[1:05:39] on an airplane's wings. We sat down here
[1:05:42] on the temple steps. We seen you come
[1:05:45] down out of heaven from the golden
[1:05:47] corridors of heaven.
[1:05:49] Now we're all trained and ready to go to
[1:05:51] work. We got our schooling. We got our
[1:05:54] bachelor of art. We got our PhD LLD and
[1:05:57] all this. We're all trained. Here we
[1:05:59] stand 10,000 strong. We're ready for
[1:06:03] you. Come on. We're waiting. Calling
[1:06:06] come. But instead of that, he goes down
[1:06:09] and gets a bunch of people that didn't
[1:06:12] hardly know right hand from left.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. put them in the upper room
[1:06:17] and poured out his spirit, oh God, upon
[1:06:21] a bunch of people like that. Instead of
[1:06:24] taking the Sanhedrin council, he took
[1:06:27] fishermen.
[1:06:28] Isn't it strange that he didn't use
[1:06:31] their educations?
[1:06:33] It pleased God. It seems to please God
[1:06:37] to make his own church a paradox.
[1:06:41] The same thing he's doing right now.
[1:06:45] making a paradox out of HIS CHURCH,
[1:06:49] BYPASSING ALL THE GREAT HIGH fluting and
[1:06:52] all this stuff there that's so-called
[1:06:54] church. He and he'll anybody that he can
[1:06:57] get into his hand, it'll open their eyes
[1:07:01] and see what's truth, test it with the
[1:07:04] word of God, and in the time that we're
[1:07:06] living and place and place them into the
[1:07:09] body of paradox.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; God chose such. He makes his church a
[1:07:15] paradox. Odd people,
[1:07:19] strange people.
[1:07:23] [laughter]
[1:07:25] You [snorts] know, some people come to
[1:07:26] church, they'll even come to this church
[1:07:28] maybe for the first time and they look
[1:07:30] around and many of you all look very
[1:07:33] strange,
[1:07:36] very odd. It's like, what's the
[1:07:39] connection here?
[1:07:41] Why are you two together? Why are these
[1:07:43] families together? Well, God did it.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; You chose your friends, didn't you?
[1:07:50] How'd that work out?
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; But then God chooses
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; a family, the family of God.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; That he wanted you and me to walk
[1:08:00] together.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Isn't that nice?
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; He wanted me to know you and you to know
[1:08:06] me.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Look at your neighbor and say,
[1:08:08] "Neighbor, it's so good to know you.
[1:08:14] You be getting on my nerves, but it's
[1:08:16] good to know you.
[1:08:18] No, don't tell him that. Don't tell him
[1:08:20] that.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; But he chose that.
[1:08:25] Isn't that nice?
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; He's the sovereign God. He does what he
[1:08:29] wants to do and how he wants to do it.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; It's a paradox. And God wants to makes
[1:08:34] his make his church a paradox. All
[1:08:37] through the scripture, he takes the the
[1:08:38] the the the minority one. He takes the
[1:08:42] one that the less likely. He takes a
[1:08:44] David. He takes, you know, the people
[1:08:48] move over, they gloss over, they miss
[1:08:50] it, they can't see it. They He takes
[1:08:52] those one all the way through. And then
[1:08:54] in this time, in this age, many want to
[1:08:57] take a stand in the intellectual and
[1:09:00] defend the gospel. But God doesn't use
[1:09:02] the intellectual to defend this gospel.
[1:09:07] Thank the Lord, there are intellectuals
[1:09:09] that do do it.
[1:09:11] But what's an intellectual without the
[1:09:13] supernatural?
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; You tell me what that is.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; And what would you rather have? Is this
[1:09:19] Bible more intellectual or more? There's
[1:09:21] nobody more intellectual than God
[1:09:23] himself.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; And he took the foolish
[1:09:28] and the weak and the beggarly things of
[1:09:32] this earth
[1:09:34] to bring the kingdoms down,
[1:09:37] to bring things to pass.
[1:09:40] Let's take a few scriptures that are
[1:09:43] like paradox type scriptures
[1:09:46] if I can read one or two of them. First
[1:09:49] 2 Corinthians chapter 12
[1:09:53] says this.
[1:09:55] And he said unto me, verse number nine
[1:09:58] and 10, my grace is sufficient for thee.
[1:10:02] My strength is made perfect in weakness.
[1:10:06] Most gladly therefore will I glory
[1:10:09] rather glory in my infirmities
[1:10:12] that the power of Christ may rest upon
[1:10:14] me. Therefore I take pleasure in
[1:10:18] infirmities
[1:10:20] in reproaches
[1:10:23] in necessities in persecutions
[1:10:26] in distresses
[1:10:28] for Christ's sake. For when I am weak
[1:10:33] then I am strong.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:36] Somebody tell me that makes sense.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; That don't make sense.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; You're weak, but you're talking about
[1:10:44] you're strong. WHICH ONE IS IT, PAUL?
[1:10:46] WHEN I AM WEAK, THEN I AM STRONG.
[1:10:50] THEREFORE, he got the paradox. He got
[1:10:52] the mystery of it. So many people
[1:10:54] thinking the way up is up, but we know
[1:10:57] the way up is down.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; That's the that's the mechanics of the
[1:11:02] Bible. THAT'S THE MATHEMATICS OF THE
[1:11:04] BIBLE. The way up is down.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; And people think the way up is up.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Taking something, taking advantage,
[1:11:14] jumping over. But the way up really is
[1:11:16] down. The scripture tells us in St. John
[1:11:19] 12:24, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:11:23] except a corner of a wheat fall in the
[1:11:24] ground and die, it abideth alone. But if
[1:11:28] it die,
[1:11:31] it bringeth forth much fruit. He that
[1:11:34] loveth his life shall lose it, and he
[1:11:38] that hateth his life in this world shall
[1:11:40] keep it unto life eternal. So the grain
[1:11:45] has to die, doesn't it?
[1:11:48] It has to die. And when it dies, it
[1:11:51] actually brings forth more fruit.
[1:11:54] When you die to yourself, that's when
[1:11:56] you'll become more successful in the
[1:12:00] kingdom of God. When you let go of your
[1:12:02] ways and your and you got to have it
[1:12:04] your way. It's got to be the way you
[1:12:05] said it, the way you want it.
[1:12:06] Everybody's got to get in line behind
[1:12:08] you. When you let go of that, then God
[1:12:10] will bless you.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness?
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; It's contrary.
[1:12:20] It's a paradox, but yet it's true.
[1:12:22] Matthew 16 24-26
[1:12:26] says this. Then said Jesus unto his
[1:12:28] disciples, if a man come after me, let
[1:12:31] him deny himself
[1:12:33] and do what? Take up his cross and
[1:12:37] follow me. Verse 25, for whosoever will
[1:12:41] save his life shall lose it, and
[1:12:43] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[1:12:47] shall find it. For what is a man
[1:12:51] profited if he shall gain the whole
[1:12:54] world and lose his own soul?
[1:12:58] Or what shall a man give in exchange for
[1:13:01] his soul?
[1:13:05] There's a quotation where brother random
[1:13:07] makes the statement that persecution
[1:13:10] always strengthens the church.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; It always stren we think persecution
[1:13:15] actually weakens us. It makes us less.
[1:13:18] It hurts us and we're we're less. No,
[1:13:21] no, no, no, no, no. Persecution actually
[1:13:23] strengthens the church.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; It's a It's a little different equation
[1:13:28] than what the world would say. You
[1:13:31] think, "If you love me, you wouldn't
[1:13:32] spank me, Mom. If you love me, Dad,
[1:13:35] you'll just say yes all the time." Well,
[1:13:37] that's not love.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; It's off. It's an error.
[1:13:43] It's contrary. That's not how God
[1:13:46] operates.
[1:13:47] When God loves you, he allows things to
[1:13:50] happen to you.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; He allows distresses and squeezes. Look
[1:13:55] at Look at the Apostle Paul. The Apostle
[1:13:57] Paul went, he was going, going, going,
[1:14:00] going going going everywhere he went, he
[1:14:02] was preaching, and he'd probably still
[1:14:03] be going today
[1:14:06] if he was here. But when they hooked him
[1:14:08] up, put him in prison, locked him up for
[1:14:11] two years, what he do? He was writing,
[1:14:14] writing, writing. Many of the fine books
[1:14:17] that we have of the Bible were written
[1:14:19] from a man without a low lighting and
[1:14:24] and and meager elements to write with
[1:14:28] and and but look what it produced.
[1:14:32] Look at brother Rando's life, how God
[1:14:33] squeezed on him and how he lost what he
[1:14:37] lost and the things that he had to
[1:14:39] suffer and go through. Persecution
[1:14:42] always strengthens the church. Let me
[1:14:44] say this. Persecution always will
[1:14:47] strengthen the believer. It's a paradox.
[1:14:50] We don't ask for it, but it will happen.
[1:14:53] It's actually happening right now.
[1:14:57] God, it was pleasing God that he would
[1:14:59] make his church a paradox. I um I love
[1:15:04] the oldfashioned prayer meeting. I love
[1:15:06] the weekday service. And for a number of
[1:15:10] years, I was I was trying to find where
[1:15:12] the the history of the Wednesday night
[1:15:15] prayer meeting comes from because it's
[1:15:17] not scriptural.
[1:15:20] [snorts] But um we know the prophet gave
[1:15:23] us that example. He had a Sunday
[1:15:24] morning, Sunday night service. I know
[1:15:27] some people can't do it because of
[1:15:30] whatever the convenience is. some
[1:15:32] switched their services and so forth.
[1:15:35] But um one of the
[1:15:39] early early writers after the in the
[1:15:43] first century they
[1:15:46] were bringing out how the Christians
[1:15:49] took Wednesday and Friday because
[1:15:51] Wednesday was the the day that Judas
[1:15:57] betrayed Jesus and Friday was the day he
[1:15:59] was crucified. So that was a fast day
[1:16:02] and that's in in a lot of the histories
[1:16:04] and they they did they chose those two
[1:16:07] days because they were opposite to the
[1:16:09] Jews fast day. The Jews would fast on a
[1:16:13] Monday and a Thursday.
[1:16:16] Um and a lot of those writings talk
[1:16:18] about that and then you see the the
[1:16:20] history of it and how it just um evolved
[1:16:24] and we have a weekday service and we
[1:16:27] call it a Wednesday uh prayer meeting.
[1:16:30] Some do it on Thursday and whatnot. It's
[1:16:32] just an interesting history how it how
[1:16:36] it started. But let me [snorts] just
[1:16:38] read a few scriptures for you and what
[1:16:41] the early saints did as they gathered
[1:16:44] together.
[1:16:45] And then if the musicians will come for
[1:16:48] a moment and see if I can find these
[1:16:50] scriptures that I had written out.
[1:16:56] Acts [snorts] 2:42
[1:16:59] the scripture says this.
[1:17:14] [snorts]
[1:17:16] Excuse me.
[1:17:23] Then they verse 41. And then they that
[1:17:25] gladly received his word were baptized.
[1:17:28] And the same day there were added unto
[1:17:29] them about 3,000 souls. And they
[1:17:32] continued steadfastly in the apostles
[1:17:34] doctrine in fellowship and in breaking
[1:17:37] of bread and in prayers. Acts 5:42,
[1:17:45] brother Bam says that they were taking
[1:17:47] communion. That's how he interprets
[1:17:49] that. The breaking of bread. He said
[1:17:51] that the early church every time they
[1:17:53] met they took communion. Acts 5:42 says
[1:17:57] this here.
[1:18:11] And daily in the temple and in every
[1:18:14] house they cease not to teach and preach
[1:18:17] Jesus Christ. And Hebrews 10:25 tells us
[1:18:23] not to forsake the assembling of
[1:18:26] ourselves together. So they they daily
[1:18:28] got together. It was um home meetings.
[1:18:34] They met in different places at
[1:18:37] different times, but it was a constant
[1:18:40] daily gathering. We have a Wednesday
[1:18:44] night prayer meeting. We thank the Lord
[1:18:46] for it. Call it a weekday service.
[1:18:49] We gather to pray. We gather to hear his
[1:18:53] word to break from the uh from the from
[1:18:58] the Sunday service. And we want to
[1:19:01] always respect that and honor it. We
[1:19:04] thank the Lord for it that we can gather
[1:19:06] together and make our requests known,
[1:19:10] praise the Lord, and have have the Holy
[1:19:13] Spirit make us a paradox. That's that's
[1:19:18] our desire. So, God bless you. There was
[1:19:21] a prayer request I have from brother
[1:19:23] Richard Valencia that came in earlier
[1:19:26] this week on Sunday. He said, "I wanted
[1:19:29] you to ask I wanted to ask you to keep
[1:19:31] sister Sophia in prayers. The
[1:19:34] cardiologist diagnosed diagnosed her
[1:19:37] with aortic stenosis.
[1:19:40] The treatment is to change out the
[1:19:42] aortic valve via open heart surgery or
[1:19:46] through a trans catheter valve
[1:19:49] replacement.
[1:19:51] This isn't the news we wanted, but we
[1:19:53] know that God is in control and has the
[1:19:55] last word. We'll speak with the surgeon
[1:19:58] tomorrow, which was Monday, and most
[1:20:01] likely surgery will take place in a few
[1:20:04] months. And then so they met with this
[1:20:06] surgeon and he sent this. He says, "I
[1:20:10] wanted to update you on Sophia, Sister
[1:20:14] Sophia. They did all the preliminary
[1:20:16] tests and everything looks good for the
[1:20:19] valve replacement.
[1:20:21] She finally was released from the
[1:20:23] hospital today and is resting. Her heart
[1:20:26] surgery will take place mid January.
[1:20:30] I want to thank you for your prayers and
[1:20:32] thank God for allowing me more time with
[1:20:34] my wife. God bless you. That's from
[1:20:39] brother Richard Valencia. So, we'll keep
[1:20:42] sister Sophia in prayer. She's had
[1:20:44] health complications for a good portion
[1:20:46] of her life and she's just really hard
[1:20:50] for her to even make it out. And so,
[1:20:52] this is, you know, open heart surgery is
[1:20:54] a big deal. So, we want to pray for
[1:20:56] them. Keep them in prayer. May was there
[1:20:59] a request here tonight that anyone had
[1:21:02] like to make known?
[1:21:05] Yes, sister.
[1:21:18] Okay.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Okay. Her name is Desiree.
[1:21:28] All right. We'll keep her in prayer or
[1:21:30] someone else. We can all stand to our
[1:21:32] feet, brother. Yes.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:21:46] Yes.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. We pray the Lord will touch you.
[1:21:53] There's someone else. I didn't have any
[1:21:55] other written requests. I might be
[1:21:57] forgetting one. If you have that, you
[1:22:00] can make it known. I'm sure we have
[1:22:04] unspoken requests. Brothers Jonathan.
[1:22:06] Yes. [snorts]
[1:22:20] Amen. Thank you.
[1:22:22] That's Sister Aaron.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; She's at the hospital now.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; She's at the hospital. Okay. All right.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; All right. We'll keep her in prayer. Um
[1:22:35] that's the best thing anybody can do is
[1:22:37] pray. Oh my. Prayer changes things.
[1:22:40] Amen. Let's all stand to our feet. Amen.
[1:22:44] How many's ever been in the hospital and
[1:22:46] you can feel the saints prayers over
[1:22:48] you?
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; There's something about it. It's really
[1:22:51] special. Amen. song.

[1:47:40] Oh, it's Jesus
[1:47:43] I [singing] really want to see. [music]
[1:47:49] Yes, it's [singing] Jesus

[1:48:21] want to.
[1:48:25] Amen. I'm ask brother Miguel to come and

[1:48:50] Spirit.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; This evening with the message and things
[1:48:55] that he's [music] done for us uh in this
[1:48:57] past this whole year. So, I just want to
[1:49:01] say thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:49:04] And um this uh
[1:49:07] think about what we've gone through
[1:49:09] through this uh this year and just uh
[1:49:13] keep on the right path with with uh the
[1:49:16] message of the hour
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; and uh [music] the Bible and all these
[1:49:20] things that the supernatural that we
