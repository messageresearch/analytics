Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's sing about that song, Till the Storm Passes By. Why should I worry? Why should I fear? Let's start with the chorus there. Oh, why should I worry? Why should I fear? When the very same Jesus, he stays always near. He lives in my heart and he hears when I cry. I'll call on his name till the storm passes by. Why should I worry? And why should I worry? Why should I fear when the Mary St. Jesus stays always near? He lives in my heart and he hears when I cry. I'll call on his name till the storm passes by. Let's go to the first verse. Out on the water, storm raging high. The waters around them were troubled at night. Fear filled their hearts and they felt they would die. They failed to remember. The master was not. And he spoke the words and the winds all stood still. Even the waters they oyed his will. He calmed their storm just like he will mine. If I just remember that he lives deep inside. So why should I wory? Why should I fear? When the Mary save Jesus, he stays always here. He lives in my heart and he hears when I cry. I'll call on his name till the storm passes by. You reading the Bible? Oh, we read in the Bible how he walked with them. Brought light to the darkness when the ways grew so dim. How great it would be to have his steps leading mine and to walk with the master all of the time. And when trials come and death seems so right, I'll call the master. I know he'll be there on time. And when sickness comes and my body in pain, all I have to do is call on his name. So why should I worry? Why should I fear when we're berishing Jesus? He's always so dear. He lives in my heart and he hears when I cry. I'll call his name till the storm pass in his heart. Oh, why should I worry? Why should I fear when the very same Jesus is always so near? He lives in my heart and he hears when I cry. I'll call on his name till the storm passes on. [Music] Oh Jesus, you're the sweetest name of all. Jesus, you always hear me when I call. Jesus, here pick me up each time I fall. You're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all. Let's sing that one more time. Oh Jesus, you're the sweetest name of all. Jesus, you always hear me when I call. Jesus, you pick me up each time I fall. You're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all. Oh Jesus, how I love to praise your name. Jesus, you're still the first, the last, the same. Oh Jesus, [Music] you died and took away my shame. You're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all. Oh Jesus, you're the soon coming. Jesus, we need love and he can bring. Jesus, we lift our voices up and sing. You're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all. Jesus, you're the soon and coming king. Oh Jesus, [Music] you're the soon and king. Jesus, we need the love that you can bring. Oh Jesus. We lift our voices up and sing. You're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all. Amen. As we get ready to change the word of the service, let's all stand. I just want to be where you are. Dwelling daily in your presence. I don't want to worship from afaring where you are. Let's take that off the key. I want to be where you are. Oh, dwelling in your presence. Feasting at your table and surrounded by your glory in your presence. That's where I always want to be. Oh, I just want to be I just want to be with you. Let's take out the key. [Music] I just want to be where you are, dwelling in your presence. I don't want to worship from afar. Draw me in to where you are. Oh, I want to be where you are. Dwelling in your presence. Feasting at your table and surrounded by your glory. your presence. That's where I always want to be.

[Music] Tasting at your table, [Music] surrounded by your glory. In your presence, that's where I always want to be. [Music] I just want to be. &gt;&gt; I just want to be with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord bless each of you tonight. God bless you richly. Amen. and welcome you to the house of the Lord. We're going to go and listen to this message, the invasion of the United States. And brother Brandon preaches that he'll start the scripture reading in Chronicles chapter 18. If you want to prepare to turn your there in your Bibles and we thank the Lord for the opportunity to hear this message tonight or a portion of it preached in 1954 May the 9th the invasion of the United States. Amen. This is the stored up food that by vision brother Vanom was commanded to store it up. The angel of the Lord told him to do that so that the bride would have something to eat during the time of the famine. &gt;&gt; And we are in a famine. There's a famine in the land today. But the bride has food, good food, clean food, powerful food, anointed food. It is on those tapes. And so we thank God for it tonight. So as we prepare to go there, let's sing this. Only believe. Sing it. Only believe. [Music] Only believe [Music] that all things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. [Music] Only believe. All things are possible only. Let's lift our hands and say, "Lord, I believe." And Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe that all things are possible. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe all things are possible. Lord, I believe. God bless you. You may be seated, Brother Brandham. This was a Mother's Day message that Brother Brandham preached. God bless you. Amen. Now, this this morning in the Old Testament, turning over to Chronicles, I've been just a little bit upset while you're turning now to Chronicles, the 18th chapter. just a little tired. But if the Lord willing, I'm not sure we'll know more Wednesday night. If the Lord willing and the church feels led that way, I like to have Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday as a revival here. Just a teaching, revival on the word. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Just teaching on the word. Amen. Not healing services, but teaching. Maybe the Lord will lead us that way. and then we I just love to be with you and have a fellowship around the word with you. Thank you very much for that fine wonderful amen. Now in the 18th chapter of Chronicles and beginning with the 12th verse, we wish to base our thoughts just for a little while on this uh vital subject of the day. 1 Chronic or 2 Chronicles, I beg your pardon. 2 Chronicles 18:12 and we'll read a portion of it here and um see what our Lord will have us to know. And the messenger that went to call Micah spake to him, saying, Behold the words of the prophets, declare good unto the king with one ascent. Let thy word, therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good. And Micah said, as the Lord liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak. And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micah, shall we go up to Ramagil to battle, or shall we forebear? and he said, "Go ye up and prosper and they shall be delivered unto your hand." Now to base our thought for a few moments, just one word to him again on this. Our heavenly father, with grateful hearts, we approach thee just now in behalf of lost souls, &gt;&gt; behalf of those who are needy, in behalf of the church. Uh may the Holy Spirit get into the word quickly now we pray. Take it right straight to every heart here that has need. And when he delivers his message of the power of the word into the heart, may we all prosper by it this morning going leaving the tabernacle rejoicing and praising God saying our hearts burns within us because of his presence. For we ask that in his name. Amen. Our scene bases this morning on a tragic and the Old Testament to me is always a shadow or are a forecasting of the New Testament. Many times someone has said, "Brother Bram, why is it you always take the Old Testament?" Nearly always taking a text, you'll go back to the Old Testament. I do it because I like typology. I like my education is very limited as all know and the only way that I know to be somewhere near right is to see what the pattern was to look off the blueprint and see what it was and then I know what that was will be something similar to what this is here because it's just the shadow of it. And I always look back to the Old Testament to see what the children of Israel did, see what the punishment of sin was, see what the justice of the prophets was, see what all those things were, and then I'll have an idea what this issue, which is foreshadowing, what will be in the general wind up at the end. During this time, there had been a great thing happened to Israel. It was in the darkness of its midnight. in the Old Testament. If the Lord willing, maybe in the coming services like to show how that the seven church ages typed out in the Old Testament, how that they began just as Zach at the uh the beginning of the church ages of the Gentile church and went right down through a similar dark age and come out into the glorious time of Pentecost at the falling of the Holy Spirit and the early church of the and the Jewish dispensation then going through another period of the gentile church through a dark age and then coming out again into the millennium at the end. Now how that back in the middle centuries there this great king Ahab came up in power and he was kind of riding on the reputation of the other Israelite kings which was a Ahab himself was kind of a a borderline believer. I've often referred to him that way because he was part of the time on this side of the fence, part of the time on that side of the fence. You can never know where to stand. A man that's unstable like that. Or a person that professes to be a Christian and that unstable, you don't know what to do about the person. &gt;&gt; Today they're Christian, tomorrow you don't know where they're at. They're in church. Today they're rejoicing and singing and praising God. and tomorrow out drinking, crowousing, running around. Then that type of a person is hard to do anything with. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; I remember as a boy once we had a an old horse that he used to jump the fences all the time. And I guess many of you men at my age would know back in the horse days, buggy days. I've come a many time right down this street here driving a horse and buggy myself. I'm 45. So they remember this old horse would put a yolk on his neck like you would a cow and keep him from jumping the fence and he'd jump anyhow and he would hang that yolk and turn him around and so forth. He'd get over the fence and one day what he I wondered what was attracting that old fella and there's a big sinkhole down there. Now he was standing in alalfie oh high but he wanted some blades of orchard grass in a sinkhole and he jumped that fence and got in that sinkhole where all these wire and glass where we are are dumped and get in there to get a few mouthfuls of that archer grass and we had to get some more horses and pull him out of that sinkhole. When he got in there, he got hung up. And when he stood out there, he was quivering and bleeding and and how he was just to get a mouthful or two of that orchard grass when he was standing in Alpha Alpha almost to his knees. I've often thought of that picture. A way of a transgressor is hard. &gt;&gt; He just wouldn't stay still where he was eating and having a wonderful time. But the he had to jump the fence and go get all bruised and cut up like that just to get a mouth full of of grass of some other different kind. That's just about the way people does that jumps the fence of God's pastor. Don't you believe that? Gets out, &gt;&gt; go out today, come in in church having a wonderful time, then tomorrow sell out for something like that. It makes it very hard. Ahab was more or less that type of a person. every way the wind blowed. Ahab had his sail set was on this side or that side. His marriage got him all messed up with the a little woman which was a little princess, a king's daughter, a Jezebel, very pretty to look at, very beautiful woman, but in her heart she was wicked and she was an idoltor and she calls all Israel. Now, how would like to border there just for a few minutes? wasn't getting into the core of this on motherhood. See there. And when a man starts to get married, the type of a girl woman that he it's more than just look at beauty. You've got to get somebody both soul and body &gt;&gt; join together. Somebody that's really going to be your friend and pal that'll stick with you through thick and thin. &gt;&gt; Now, but Ahab, he just fell apart because she was pretty, I suppose. and Mary. It could be nothing else about her because of wicked as she was and she come over there and then of course being wrapped up with her like that and loved her. Why he caused all Israel to sin and to go against God and to tear down the altars of God build up the altars of Baal and they had Baal worship all through Israel at the time. Now it his wife had called righteous Neabboth. Many of you has read of him how he tuck his garden by the seat swore line had false witnesses against him because she wanted to do something for her husband and killed a righteous man in order to get a garden ad close to the palace land. All this God was looking down. And so the prophet Elijah, which was a great mighty uh servant of the Lord, prophesied and told Jezebel what would happen to her. And he told Ahab that the dogs would lick his own blood. Now when God has said anything, of course them days the direct word of the Lord came through the prophets. God in sun dry times and diverse matters spoke to the fathers through the prophets in this last day through his son Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if anything's contrary to that leave it alone. &gt;&gt; See now secondarily he speaks today through the prophet the seer and so forth. But first is this the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. down. And Ahab had done this wickedness and he went on God blessing the people for many years. And finally Jehoshaphat was king over Judah while uh Ahab was king over Israel. And then Jehoshaphat was a righteous man. He was the son of Asa. Asa was a a righteous man. and he tore down all the altars of of idols, built up the altars of Jehovah, and they having a a revival as it was up in Judah. And then after a while, Jehoshaphat or Ahab rather sent up and he found out another piece of land in Syria that he thought belonged to him that he thought he'd go get. So he asked this uh Jehoshaphat if he would come and make an alliance with him. And of course there is a great danger. Now see &gt;&gt; when they seen this great king Ahab down there and he's seen this great one up here Jehoshaphat one of them a lukewarm the other a spiritfilled man. &gt;&gt; Watch how you make your alliance. Watch what you're doing. how you yoke yourself up with unbelievers. &gt;&gt; Keep yourself clean, especially in the day that we're living. &gt;&gt; I believe church without a shadow of doubt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is burned on my heart. That's the reason I'm looking for these five nights soon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To want once more before it happens, give this church a third combing through the Bible. &gt;&gt; We're living in the shadows of the time. Amen. &gt;&gt; It could happen any time &gt;&gt; when we see the times come for things to take place. The very wickedness of the enemy, the very powers, we look at these snowstorms and everything happening, all these pestilence, all different things. That's all caused by these interruptions of firing these bombs and things. They're getting things all mixed up here and they're messing around in God's big laboratory to fulfill his word. &gt;&gt; It's going to happen. So, the man of sin rising up power so deceitful. My I heard a minister this morning, a spiritfilled man taking the mark of the beast and saying that the antichrist was Russia. What an era. Russia has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; That's scripturally. Now, but notice in this great time that we're living a warning. Now, this Jehoshaphat feeling kind of good because the great king of Israel said, "Come visit me." And he went down there and they took ox and sheep and so forth, done sacrifice all the time in Ahab's heart down there. He was a deceiver because he was not worshiping that or offering those sheep and things with a true heart because after all he leaned more to his wife's religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. And notice just as Ahab married Jezebel during a time of that great dark age of Israel, he brought idolatry into Israel. &gt;&gt; A very type of today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just in the dark age when we come out through the early apostles second round third round over into the dark age of 1500 years just as Ahab married Jezebel and brought idolatry into Israel so did the Holy Ghost church marry into isms and brought idolatry back and today it's a form of Christianity &gt;&gt; see just very dark and now it's moved on down each day each church age moves down come to that same thing to the great climax to the lukewarm condition comes lukewarm &gt;&gt; lady of see a church age &gt;&gt; oh what a horrible hour that we're living in &gt;&gt; listen I want to confess right here before I go any further I'm an oldfashioned preacher that's longing to see the old days again &gt;&gt; I've seen so much of this impersonation Hollywood glam hammeredizing the gospel, but I'm so sick and tired of it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I want to see the old fashioned. I'm afraid we're making Christianity too pretty for people. &gt;&gt; Danger line. &gt;&gt; Now, Jehoshaphat comes down, thinks, "Oh, well, this great king of Israel, I'll just oh, we it'll be all right." And right in the midst of all this big glamour, what did he do? He made an alliance to go up and to fight the enemy on common grounds because they said, "We are both the same people." But they wasn't. &gt;&gt; One was a spiritfilled group. The other was a lukewarm group. &gt;&gt; We're not the same people. &gt;&gt; No, sir. You can't have darkness. Can't have fellowship of light. &gt;&gt; This the night cannot exist in the presence of the sunlight. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the most treacherous time there is is between the times just when the sun's going down or rising up is the most treacherous time there is. There's not enough vision to see clearly. Your lights won't your automobile won't show uh good and clear. It's better either be dark or light. Jesus said be hot or cold. No lukewarm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just that's a danger line. And then Jehoshaphat when he come down and then this great alliance was made which did not please God. And notice just in the time of his all of his excitement now I have got favor with this king and oh I I I have fellowship with this neighbor. I have See be careful that church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See help us. &gt;&gt; That's what causes all the trouble around this tabernacle here and around others. &gt;&gt; See be careful that what you're mixing up with. See &gt;&gt; come right out and either be part Christ or be against him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now &gt;&gt; this fellow made the alliance and he thought he had done something great yet when he said isn't there now before we can go up we should consult the Lord about this. Now Jehoshaphat had enough religion left in him and his mistake that he had went down there to this king but he had enough religion left in him to think well we ought to at least consult the Lord. Now, Ahab is going right on out without saying a word. Just his own mechanical, physical, human uh way of doing things. I just wonder right here, church, if that hasn't been a lot of times we've made mistakes, &gt;&gt; figure it out and say, "Well, it ought to be this way and we've set it like that." I think that's where a whole lot of the American evangelism is today. That we have said it in a form of of I'd say Hollywood evangelism. Whole lot about uh glamour. We notice the evangelist comes to the platform today and my is all puffed out and tells a whole lot of uh jokes before he starts the preaching and things like that and carries on and acts like a clown in the pull pit. When it comes time to make an altar call, the people don't even see any sincerity to make an altar call by. &gt;&gt; And that's right. That's the reason the world's got a lukewarm condition the day that it's in. I wonder today it's just today uh uh the church we tried to send our boys to school to learn psychology and so forth like that to know how to put over a program to get in the pull pit to arrange our the message is so enticing that it'll catch the people and catch their attention and many of great psychologists go out as teachers like that and dramatize and put on a whole lot of something and I just wonder when If that we are always telling them the beauty and the attraction of the church, but we fail to tell them, he that will follow me, let him deny himself, pick up his cross and follow me. &gt;&gt; I wonder if we haven't made the beauty of the church too pretty for the fellow that comes in. For instance, the Baptist church today got a slogan, a million more and 44 taking in members by the thousands and the tens of thousands unconverted. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just people who walk in and join the church. &gt;&gt; And it's an endamment to the church of Jesus Christ to take such members in. &gt;&gt; They still drink. They still smoke. They still gamble. They still lie. They come to the church expecting to be entertained by a bunch of Hollywood evangelists that gets up put on a lot of glamour, a lot of big instruments setting up down on the platform when they ought to have an old fashioned god for hang out altar call down where men and women don't come to glamorize or to run up and act a clown, but to get out the altar and realize that the death of Jesus Christ there died for them that they're getting back sincere with God again. Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder if we're not living in that kind of a time. &gt;&gt; Why we take great evangelists like many it's crossing the lands today of great known evangelists who study psychology and attract the people to the church but if he wants to get them into the church then what's he going to do to them? &gt;&gt; What what are they going to happen after they get into the church? Just join the church. They go back with the same sin and the same desire that they come into the church with. They go back the same way. And that's the reason today the world looks on said, well, if that man got religion, if this person got religion, I'm afraid we've made it too easy. &gt;&gt; It's I love I think joy certainly I believe that all joys lays in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. I believe it's joyful and happy. But remember, brother, it's a way of agony and suffering in the cross. You must realize that, too. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord. That's right. I wonder if we had painted a little too a little too smooth. Like I was looking at my wife put started out and she put a rose on my coat this morning. She said, "You ought to wear it. Your mother's a living." And I said, "Oh, honey, I don't know. Mother's Day is wonderful, but that's like the world. They've commercialized the thing just merely to sell flowers and things like that. Why? It's a discredit to mother. &gt;&gt; Why my mother's my mother every day and a year." Yes, sir. Not just one day I'll say you love your mother. I sent her a bouquet of flowers last Mother's Day. Well, brother, she ought to be mother every day. But it's commercial. That flower is pretty. I love a pretty flower. I think of that just like I do. How pretty the flower is. It blooms and it's got fragrance and the passer by smells it. The animal comes by, smells it. But now look, it's pretty like the church of the Lord Jesus Christ. It's the most glorious thing. divine healings and powers and wonders and signs and miracles and freedom from sin. It's a beautiful place. But look, if that rose will have to come to church like all nature, that rose being pretty ever counted country would lick on it if she could. But nature provided a little bandits, a little spear sticking out there called thorns, and they leave them away. That protects it. That's exactly. And I think today if we haven't got the word of God sharper than a two-edged sword around the beauty of the power of the holiness of God, we're going to let every cow come on it and call it. It'll gone. It'll be an endement to the church. That's right. I think today what we need is more oldfashioned God call ministers wrong. Maybe not with much education, &gt;&gt; but it'll bring the people down to an altar in their agoniz, not with a joy and laughing and popping and chewing gum and put their name on a paper. &gt;&gt; But rather an old cry out and dying out until men and women thoroughly repent from their sins and come close to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I tell you, we've got raise up your hands. Who wants to accept Christ? All like that. That's all right, brother. But that don't that don't expel sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to repent first. &gt;&gt; Get right. &gt;&gt; Get down there and really cry out. I can remember the times in the old fashioned people would walk down through the aisles and up and down the roads of crying and talking to their neighbors. That was Christians of that day. Tell them about the things of the Lord. And today we put our name on the church book and go out and stay home and never say a word about it unconcerned. Just as long as we belong to the church, it's all right. &gt;&gt; I'm sure we're wrong there, people. Check up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For that won't stand in the judgment. No, sir. It won't nothing less. He that will follow me, let him deny himself. &gt;&gt; Take up his cross and die daily. &gt;&gt; Stay dead in the cross. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Agony. The way I'll take the way you sing with the Lord's despised few. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think today what a time that we're living in that evangelism they put it out great big bright lights and they try when you see the evangelist coming to town you wonder I my meetings has been guilty the same. That's right. I wonder who's coming to town sometime the evangelist or Jesus Christ. While they got I went into a place long ago where a certain evangelist is supposed to come and Jesus name while they had a the picture of the evangelist the man of the hour. The man's with this and the man with that. I sometimes I think of my ministry and see people coming. I get in a hotel room say God who who's the people coming to see me or you see &gt;&gt; if they're coming to see me they're lost yet but oh God tear me down and take me away. I want to represent you. &gt;&gt; One who will stand before someday with trembling hands and trembling feeble body. Look at that. See, knowing my soul hangs be your decision. Let us exalt Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Today they say, "Well, I belong to the Baptist. I'm a Methodist. I'm a belong to the tabernacle. I do this." Oh, that has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; Not a thing. I wonder sometime here not long ago I seen a an advertisement up for a certain campaign was coming to the city and the word of the man the man's name run great big letters all the way around like that and on the bottom in a little corner said Jesus Christ the same yesterday day and forever way down in the corner &gt;&gt; see they took all the sacredness from Christ and put it on to some man or some church or some organization &gt;&gt; brother I'm saying you can get by with glamour Hollywood crowning like that in the by the church, but in the presence of Jesus Christ, he's the one to be glorified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, that's the truth, my dear brother and sister. &gt;&gt; Don't feel angry at me. You just remember that I'm preaching you. I want to preach as this. This is the last sermon I'd ever preached in my life. &gt;&gt; I want to preach every sermon I preach as if I was a dying man preaching to dying man. &gt;&gt; And I am. Amen. &gt;&gt; My light's burning down every day. Yours is too. And we're dying mortals. And we got to face the living God some of these days. And we better be in deep sincerity about this. &gt;&gt; Just instead of glamour and carry on and join the church and go here and there, act this way and that way, we better be having oldfashioned prayer meetings in our homes and crying out to God day and night. &gt;&gt; The day is at hand. The time of distress, the time of trouble. The Bible said a dark day and we're living in it. &gt;&gt; How that this great man went out there under the excitement he joined himself with the lukewarms with the border lines and thought he was doing something great. thought that God was a blessing and not realizing it right then he was bringing in all this group with him while our little group of of Judah up here will come down and join oursel with a great bands of Israel &gt;&gt; what a mighty people we'll be &gt;&gt; there you are and that's the very line of deceit the devil's using right now to bring in the antichrist that's a certain &gt;&gt; as I'm standing into this will unite our efforts together. We can't do that. &gt;&gt; How can two walk together except they be agreed? &gt;&gt; This United States made the same self same experience and the same mistake went united with Russia back on earth at the time they just about ready to have war and bound ourselves together with Russia. And now you see what we got, don't you? We got our airplanes and all of our secrets and our atomic bombs and everything went over there and blew it back at us. Same thing goes by spiritual. Then we find out after Jehoshaphat had made this alliance and they consulted. Now watch the outside world. He said sure we've got plenty of prophets down here. We got a seminary full of them. They go down and get the fellows that have been trained who know psychology who know all about it. So come up now and we're asking to consult the Lord. All of them, of course, in their fleshly, puffed up mind, come up there and said, "Now look, we you go on up. The Lord is with you, and the Lord's going to give you that piece of land up there that it's going to be yours. You're going to push the Syrians all the way back. You're going to do it." One of them eating there itself, a big pair of iron horns, begin to run around like this, and this is what you're going to push the Syrians away. But Jehoshaphat just a little more spiritual. put up with that Tommy rod of clowning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; God, give us some more Jehoshap. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sick and tired of this year Hollywood clowning. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; Putting on, pretending to be something that they're not. &gt;&gt; Making out, dramatizing, drawing in, and then when they come in, what you got when he got in? &gt;&gt; Like asking a man come swimming in a desert? nothing but bay sand up on your head to cause sorrows afterwards. &gt;&gt; Now notice what can you bring them into? A certain lady said to me the other day a man said I'd go to church but why what would it get if I went to church said all they do is organize some supper and they about this that and the other and the lady said I stood speechless for I didn't know where to send him. There you are. Said, "I wish I could find an old church where they really sing the oldfashioned hymns and live godly." &gt;&gt; Children are hungry. They'll eat from a garbage can. &gt;&gt; It's up to the church of the living God to feed them the true living word of the of God. &gt;&gt; There all that glamour and stuff. Jehoshaphat said, "Isn't there one more?" "One more," said Ahab. "Well, what do you need with any one more? We've got 400 of the best selected, educated, top, fed, dressed man there is in a country standing here, every one of them with one accord and one heart and one boy saying, "Go, God is with you." I wonder if the United States hasn't met the same thing. &gt;&gt; I wonder if the church of God hasn't met the same thing. &gt;&gt; I wonder. Well, say, "Look, they're having success. They're having great big meetings. They're carrying thousands at a time. But I wonder if there isn't just one more." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder if there isn't something different. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we find out we have 30,000 converts in 6 weeks and 6 weeks later we haven't got a one. &gt;&gt; There's something wrong somewhere. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it's all glamour putting on the world through television, through radio, through picture shows and those outlets there has corrupted this nation with the Tommy Rod of Hollywood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Everything wants to be in big glamour. Isn't that the truth? &gt;&gt; You know that's the truth. We don't have any more of the oldfashioned religion that we used to have &gt;&gt; years ago. It's because it's been laid down. We'll get to it just in a moment. You'll see why. What a beautiful picture or a staring picture I should say. And here come this Jehoshaphat said, "Yes, I see them all there." Everyone got their degrees and whatever it was, they're all to be prophets or great ministers. They're out of great colleges and they're all this there out of the big school of the prophet and everything. They're all with one accord. That's true. But isn't there just one more? &gt;&gt; Well, what will you do with one more when 400 is giving consent at one time? But that man weighed down in his heart had God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew that there was something wrong about that. Yes, sir. They know there was something rotten. Why? Let me give you the scripture doesn't quote it. But here's what I get. I know that that Jehoshaphat knew that that hypocrite down there, Ahab, that he wasn't right with God and Elijah had prophesied the word of God to him. And how could God bless what he had cursed? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say the same thing today, friend. And the church of the living God who's standing true to God will say the same thing. You can't mix oil and water together and call it salvation. &gt;&gt; You can't. &gt;&gt; You got to separate yourself, brother. &gt;&gt; Something's got to happen. &gt;&gt; If there's any hope left, we got to do something and do it quickly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the hour of the rapture is at hand. &gt;&gt; Things are heaping up. &gt;&gt; Everything in the church is so far away. They read all kinds of magazines, books, stories and everything. I could go to day to I can go to a church and I can say, "Well, uh, how many know they know every hymn after one of these big revival and what what page is certain certain him on?" They know it. They know who it is. They know who's running for president, who's running for this, and how many movie stars married this and that, the other, but the word of God they know nothing of. &gt;&gt; There you are. So, we're giving her and yet they profess to be Christians. My God. &gt;&gt; And the people's not in blame. It's from behind the platform where it's come from. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Exactly. It's behind the platform. They teach them all kinds of rhythms and all kinds of this and that and organizations how to make youth groups and everything like that. I wonder if it's paid. &gt;&gt; Nothing against it, but I'm wondering if that's God's requirement. When Jesus said, "Except the man be born of water and spirit, he'll in no wise enter into the kingdom." He that will follow after me, let him deny himself in his own worldly pleasures, take up his cross and follow after me. Cross is a symbol of death, &gt;&gt; agony. He that will be a Christian, let him strip himself of his own, let him strip himself of his own works, let him strip himself of everything, denying himself and take up that consecrated cross and follow me daily. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He that will come after me, &gt;&gt; let him do that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus said. But today we say everybody have a big time. Everybody clap their hands. Everybody holler hallelujah. Everybody do this. Oh, we got a bunch of fuss. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, we get these new songs out and sing them so fast that it looks like we're going to run through the wall with them or something like that. But I think if we'd be singing near my God to thee, it would be a whole lot better for the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. The oldfashioned hymns get a lot of dance orchestra people. Some boy in a dance orchestra over here playing last night and tonight over here playing in the church of the living God. It's an abomination in the sight of God. &gt;&gt; Let that man be proved first and let him bring forth pro meet our repentance to show that he's right with God. &gt;&gt; They bring the jazz world right into the platform. &gt;&gt; They bring up Hollywood glamorizing preaching right into the platform. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why didn't I sit in your fair city a few weeks ago in Louisville, Kentucky? My heart break when it's all sitting there willing to see the miracles of God, but as soon as you preach the gospel, they fill up in a second and turn their backs and walk out of the building. &gt;&gt; Certainly, they don't want it. Their hearts are hard and stick out. And many of them Protestants too who go to Protestant churches, but they've been fail filled so full of glamour and everything like that and Tommy rotten churchism until they know nothing about the spirit of the living God. &gt;&gt; Having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof. &gt;&gt; What a day that we're living. Watch where he Jehosapus said, I know Ahab. There's your 400 preachers. They're all fine looking fellas. Every one of them dressed in their hair combed neatly and everything. whatever more they may be. They may have their DDs, they may have their all kinds of degrees, they may know the scriptures from A to Z, but haven't you got one more somewhere? &gt;&gt; Isn't there just one more somewhere? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes, there's one more, but I hate him." There you are. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; I hate him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember Ahab was a religious man &gt;&gt; and these were religious teachers, &gt;&gt; but they hated this man who had the truth. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; But I hate him. &gt;&gt; Said he's always better out something against me. How could he keep from doing it? &gt;&gt; When the word of God had condemned him. How can you hold still if you're a man of God or a woman of God and know and see sin and things heaped and waited and everything like that and see human souls going to hell millions a day &gt;&gt; and stand still you can't do it. &gt;&gt; Someone said to me they said you think you can stop it. I said, "No, I can't stop it." Cuz God said, "But one day at the judgment board, they're going to pull out the big screen flash on the camera and that tape recorder is going to be playing. I'm going to stand to listen at it. I'll hear my voice warning against it. &gt;&gt; God will judge me when my voice comes against it." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. When we see this life, this generation reenacted again at the judgment. Certainly, we're living in a terrible time. There it is. We seen it. He said, "Isn't there one more?" He said, "Yes, but I hate him. For he's always prophesying evil against me." How can he keep from preaching those hard things? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he sees it going on, see Ahab living like he was and doing like he was and bringing the people like you are. How can a man of God or a woman of God keep from hollering out and rebuking sin from every side when they see these lukewarm preachers and glamatizers and educators and so forth like that out? Let the people go to hell by the millions utter deceit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of even in holiness people &gt;&gt; I'm not talking so much about Methodist and Baptist and things like that. They have it too. But it's right down in your own ranks &gt;&gt; by coming to the platform like everything else. Christians &gt;&gt; living like everything else across the countries and things. Then they call it religion. It's a religion but it's a long ways from the salvation of the Lord. That's right. They've just got the people to just a big bunch of worked up. Then as soon as the little work up goes over, then the first thing you know, you can't find a one of them. The church is set and empty. Brother, if a man loves God, he'll fill his seat in the church every time. We can't stay away from it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, notice just a few minutes. I'll try to hurry. Get straight to the point now cuz the time's getting away. Notice that he said, "Isn't there one more?" He said, "Yes, but I hate him." He's always prophesying against me. He's saying evil things against me. All right. He said, "Go get him." He said, "His name is Micah." But this man had enough religion to know that these fellows wasn't right. &gt;&gt; And any man that's ever been touched the least bit by the spirit of God knows that these things what's called Christianity today is not right. &gt;&gt; You can't love the world or the things of the world. &gt;&gt; If you do, the love of God's not in you. The Bible said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now look, he said, "Go get him." And they went over and then he sent a little old messenger along, the deacon of the church perhaps or somebody said, "Now look, Micah, we're going to bring you over here before Ahab and Jehoshaphat." Now they're both sitting out there and they're a great man now. They're teachers and they're scholars and they got their degree and so forth. And every one of our seminary, every one of our churches here is a perfect at agreement that this is the will of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, you say the same thing they say. And I tell you, you'll dress better and ride the Cadillac car. I'll tell you, you'll just be a great fellow if you'll do that. Yes, sir. You'll prosper. Micah said the Lord God lives. I'll only say what God says. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, there's a man in my heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; I may have to eat bread and water, which he did for doing it. &gt;&gt; He may be smothe, but he told the truth and stood by. God confirmed it to be the truth. &gt;&gt; He wasn't so popular, but he know God. &gt;&gt; Little old Mike over there. He said, "All right, Micah, what do you say about it?" He said, "Go on up. Go on up." Said, "Go up in peace. Go ahead and prosper. That's what I want you to do. But I seen the Israelites sheep without a shepherd on a hill scattered. &gt;&gt; I said, he said, "And when he did like that and Ahab turned around to Jehoshaphat said, what I tell you that holy ruler or what, excuse me, or whatever it was, that guy said that, what I tell you that fell would only prophesy e evil against me. What I say only condemn our church and condemn our ministers and condemn our way of religion?" &gt;&gt; What do I tell you? He said, "I know him. I know his daddy before him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know his daddy before him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. A real man of God. Said, I know he'd say that. And so then he said, yes. Said, I saw Israelite sheep uh scattered without a shepherd on the hill. And so then he said, I and then one of those fellows that had the big horns to go to push off, a preacher walked over and pulled little Mike around and smacked him in the mouth as hard as he could. Said, which way did the spirit of God go when it went out of me? if you know said he said wait till you're sitting in prison over here and you'll know which way it went. &gt;&gt; That's right. Wait till Russia's sitting out here taking over the nations and things like that in this country because of its backsliding and you'll see what was right and wrong. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see where your lukewarm religion will pay off or not. &gt;&gt; Let this nation come to tears, &gt;&gt; not come to laughter and drama. &gt;&gt; Let this nation come to its knees and repentance. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's what we need. not a revival to get a whole lot of people in a church. We need to close every bootleg j. Stop old cigarette smoking. Carry on the patriots. Start up a real old fashioned Holy Ghost campaign for men and women day and night laying on their face crying. I'll tell you it'll be the greatest shelter &gt;&gt; that this nation's ever had. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Let the brand tabernacle quit its foolishness. &gt;&gt; Let it get back here at the altar and get right with God. Make up with the neighbors and so forth like that and get right with God. You won't have any fussing and going on. &gt;&gt; It'll be the drawing spot of the world. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, that's the truth. Then he said, "Which way the spirit of God go out of me?" And Micah said, "I saw God and his host, his counsel sitting in glory." You know, God has a counsel up there once in a while. &gt;&gt; He he brings up his his angelic beings and holds a a council once in a while up in heaven. And he said, "I saw him sitting up on the throne and all the people were standing on the right and left hand of him." And it said they were discussing who can we get to go down and deceive Ahab to get him out here to fulfill Elijah's prophecy. &gt;&gt; God's done said so what was going to happen. So we'll just see who can go down. And a lying spirit come up from beneath of course out of hell. come up before God and said, "I'll go down and I'll get in those preachers and cause them all to prophesy a lie." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, did that blow him up? &gt;&gt; Did that make them feel funny? Well, he said, "I'll go down cause those preachers, every one of them, to prophesy a lie." And he got out and got in those preachers and they begin to prophesy a lie. And brother, the same God rules on the same throne today. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that same lying spirit has done the same thing today. &gt;&gt; Prophesying lies. They kept saying peace, peace, peace at the first world war. Let me show you where it come from. In the first world war, when France over there turned away from God in their gay 90s and begin now, I'm going to get a little moral. So you all just sit real quiet for a few minutes. Look all back there in the beginning over in France. There's where honoring this and Phil first began. Amen. &gt;&gt; If there ever was a rat hole in the world, it's Paris, France. &gt;&gt; And I've pretty traveled to most of it, and that's the worst place I ever seen. And London, England's not much of an exception. And the United States is kind of right in line with it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There they are. Every time that you break the morals of womanhood, you break the backbone of the nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here, you go over in our own countries and say you're a missionary. They don't like say, "What are you going to tell us to do? How to sing dirty songs about our wives or about our girls? You go to tell us how to divorce our wives, teach us how to drink whiskey and go the way we do. That's what we are. We call ourselves the religious nation, the Christian nation. Well, then heathens in Africa can teach us morals how to live. &gt;&gt; The rottest placement in the United States or the world is this nation. How it's got I'm an American certainly. But brother before Ahab or Jehoshaphat, I've got to tell what God says is the truth. &gt;&gt; That's what the church needs to stand for today. If it comes between nation and God, it's God always. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yesterday, notice in France, they start all their rockness and going on the way they lived over there. And then God sent Germany into them to beat them up a little bit. Then we went over there to save their hide. And as soon as we done that and won the war, sent the Germans back, had peace with France, did they turn to God? No, sir. women, wine, debauchery, sin, filth to the gills. Then what did he do? What happened? Here's where he started. The devil set up his headquarters there. There's where he started right there to demoralize the world from Paris, France. Then if you notice, he couldn't get in here through the ministry. So a thing he done was come into Hollywood out here. He set up his he set up his headquarters over here in Hollywood. The devil landed back here a few years ago, 15 or 20 years ago, with his great army and went hit in Hollywood, California, and he's invaded the United States with his demon powers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; All of our passions come from Paris. They get into Hollywood onto the screens. These little girls and little boys and things here, they watch them screen plays. Nice little kitties, &gt;&gt; fine little fellows. Nothing against them. God bless your little hearts. My heart bleeds for him. &gt;&gt; And right here in the city, I was talking to my one of my boy the other day. He said, "Daddy, if there's just some boys around there in town that had the Holy Ghost and so forth, you wonder why I was getting away to Denver, Colorado, somewhere I could get my children somewhere where there's a bunch of people who cry out to God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What we need, brother, this country, this nation, this city, this place has become so demoralized till it's pitiful. If I could only express right now what I absolutely know to be the truth right here, &gt;&gt; it wouldn't even be presentable before a mixed audience right here in his own city right here. Not only here but other places everywhere. &gt;&gt; It's begin to come simply because why? The people look friends, it's got so cunning. It's coming so easy till it just smothers you down. &gt;&gt; The devil used to be in fashions. He might have went out of fashions, but he didn't go out of business. I'll tell you that he's still in business. &gt;&gt; Look, today we take like I said a while ago about the little lady, the little girl, the rose. For instance, a rose is pretty. It's there to be looked at. That's true. And that's just like the church is there to be looked at. Like a pretty little woman, she's there to be looked at. That's right. But if she she's fine, that's she's to her husband. She's she's all right. But if she hasn't got the moral sword sticking out there to protect her, she becomes an endement to society and human beings. &gt;&gt; She's so low and scandalous and rotten till the dogs would look at her. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the same thing to the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; They get out here and try to glamorize and fix themselves up and act like they stripped their women here. Right. And people don't realize that these devils is invading your homes. &gt;&gt; Right. In my neighborhood the other day, a young lady, which I think is a nice woman, and she's a married woman, got a child, and a little woman come out there, man come down the road to do some work. And this little lady got out there with them little bitty old clothes on. Was horrible. This is a novel Mother Day speech. But my brother, let me tell you something. Mother, get back to be mother again. &gt;&gt; Even to a little bitty boy was in our neighborhood coming and told us about. Look out there. I said, "That's nothing. The woman's a nice woman. I don't say she's demoralized, but the thing of it is there's an honory, filthy spirit on her making her do that and she don't know it. &gt;&gt; What in the world would a mother want or anybody put on those little old dirty clothes and stretch himself out before me? &gt;&gt; You're pretty sister. You're a pretty mother. I thank God for you. But you're pretty. But had you not got the Holy Spirit there to protect those boys? &gt;&gt; You'd have been better to be so ugly, nobody would have looked at you and went to heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. Watch what you're doing. Those moral now what it is. The devil has come in and he's told the people these things. He's got into the preachers. He's patterned for Hollywood. The girls and the young ladies, they pattern after Hollywood. the best of things that they have in the country today. The most marvelous you can hear us talk about all the radio talk some old woman like Mrs. K star. Nothing against her but to see an old woman 50 years old and all with her clothes all pushed out on her like she's poured in a meal sack. I ain't saying that for a joke cuz I'm talking against those things. But a woman act like that and stand up and be an example to a young American women. It's an &gt;&gt; tarnation. &gt;&gt; It's the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Guys like Arthur Godfrey and them running around here doing the things that they do and the most noted man in the country like that and what it's a disgrace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Because I feel the Holy Spirit is here. &gt;&gt; The invasion's on. It's sweeping from house to house, from place to place, from church to church, from man to man. Children in the name of Jesus Christ rise with the moral stand of everybody and the Lord Jesus Christ say I'll take the way with the Lord's &gt;&gt; disc. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. I'll be a real mother. &gt;&gt; I'll be a real dad and the whole world all around all around my soul gives way. Then he's all my hope and stay for on Christ the solid rock I stand. All other grounds are sinking. &gt;&gt; All other grounds. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. What's caused all this stuff? What's caused ministers to act like this? &gt;&gt; What made preachers prophesy this lie to the people? Why did years ago Methodist people when old John Smith was packed to his pullpit to preach the gospel and he preached a short sermon of four hours and he said, "The trouble of it is that my heart is breaking." He said the Methodist daughters are even wearing rings on their fingers and today they're dressed in shorts and little old dirty clothes and they'll be perfectly nude in another five years of something being done. &gt;&gt; What happened to you Methodist preachers? You cannibalized you Baptist. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's the devil &gt;&gt; has sold down his powers &gt;&gt; and he's got his its out here. And you don't realize that you smoking cigarettes, you women, and doing the way you're doing out there and drinking and carrying on the way you're doing. You don't realize that you're poisoning your system and ruining the whole generations that'll follow you. If there is such a thing, &gt;&gt; 85% more chance to take cancer by smoking cigarettes and using literally right in your van. churches &gt;&gt; endorse it. &gt;&gt; You know, great Baptist churches here reasonably. I'm hitting the Baptist. &gt;&gt; I got right to that. That kind on the side that I come from. But when they had to give intermission between the Sunday school service and the preaching service so that the pastor and all could go out and have a smoke. &gt;&gt; And the street was lined with men and women smoking cigarettes. that has done that. &gt;&gt; That's right, &gt;&gt; man. here in our own city. One of our most outstanding ministers right down here in New Orle this playground that one of our outstanding ministers of the city is directing a square age program &gt;&gt; to bring men and women on the platforms. Don't care what the world says. I don't care how you try to coax around it, brother. There's no redblooded man pointing up to another man's wife and feel the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know that's the truth. &gt;&gt; Tuck our women and strip them out down their offices and drive taxi cabs and up and down the street where they ought to be at home behind the stove. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cooking and fixing the dinners. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's the devil. An invasion zone. &gt;&gt; I ain't saying nothing about this individual or that individual. I'm saying it's unclean spirits that are possessing the people driving them right into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. The invasion of the United States, the overthrow of the church, the church is overthrow of the devil. &gt;&gt; That guy, they take a boy up. Now, when he comes to a seminary, the first thing he has to learn is to get his degree. He has to take psychology. He has to take theology. He has to teach get all kinds of stuff indoctrinated in him. If he hasn't got a real fine education, if he isn't smart and bright as he can be, then they'll turn him out. You can't qualify. What's he to do? To go out here and present a little political talk as it was a church politic. Talk to a group of people, a bunch of dying men and women. Oh god, some of them oldfashioned sat man who doesn't know a &gt;&gt; that goes the power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ who will preach repentance and send men and women to the altar of the Lord Jesus. Thank you. &gt;&gt; It's an endowment. He's invaded the seminaries. He's invaded the churches. He's stripped our women. He's got our men to a place that you can't tell them nothing. &gt;&gt; And men and women, I think you say, "Well, the women, yes, and you men that'll permit your wives to do that. That shows what you're made out of." That's just exactly certainly it's a disgrace. It's a pity. And then down to the preacher. The preacher stands in the platform today of the modern pulpit stands there with his peoples before him and preach about every little old thing in the world besides repentance and sin and the rugged cross of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. When you lay the facts down, the people come to hear you in evangelistic service, you're trying to get to the thing to preach the gospel and get people to repenting and getting right up and walk out. They don't have to hear it. &gt;&gt; No, they don't. But brother, they're going to have to repent our parish. &gt;&gt; Demons. &gt;&gt; You go to the school. It's invaded the schools. Look around over the country today. Look here. You people, you Protestants. Look, here's four great big Catholic schools and things built up today. Why is it you're letting down the bars? &gt;&gt; Nothing against Catholicism. No, I don't believe in it. I'm a strictly a Protestant. That's exactly proved. They don't You can't argue with them. They say, "We don't care what the Bible says. We know what the church says." God's in his word. &gt;&gt; This is where God's at. &gt;&gt; But some of the Catholics sticking to their church to make you ashamed of yourself as a Protestant. &gt;&gt; Have you stick to the Bible as they stick to the church, &gt;&gt; right? But they're wrong. I can say that out of the authority of Almighty God &gt;&gt; that they're wrong. Absolutely. And you Protestants are wrong the way you're doing because you really know better &gt;&gt; and you do it that makes a hypocrite out of you. &gt;&gt; Sure. I see invasion. &gt;&gt; Church is letting down. And now instead of church trying to make the church beautiful, build a bigger church, put big spires on it, great big pipe organs and get everything trying to pattern like the Catholic church. You don't want a pattern like the Catholic church. And she's doomed to go through destructions. For that's thus sayeth the Lord. She's doomed to go through destructions and you're patterned after her. You're going with her. &gt;&gt; But what we need today is not a big church, a big fire. It's an old fashion altars where her sins are burned up under consecrated prayers from men and women who love Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise your holy name. &gt;&gt; You know that &gt;&gt; that's what we need. &gt;&gt; Hear me, friends. Hear me. It's love. My time's gone. I just like to linger on that. horse I pick up a little later on that invasion where it went to it's invaded it's invaded our nations it invaded the United States now remember I never cast a vote in my life I start to brag on that's my American birth rights if I want to do it but I think too much of my friends to put them in there look I've seen them go in as fine man come out as crooks and I don't want that I have one thing I'm here building a platform for one person who's the candidate That's Jesus Christ and him alone. I'll give my time for him. &gt;&gt; That's right. And if I can get the church straightened out, the rest of the world will take care of itself. That's right. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, when Mr. Roosevelt, the man's dead. Let him rest. I trust he is. Come in and run three or four terms and take over just a preliminary dictatorship. I can prove to you that the scripture where that said he take place, &gt;&gt; right? We haven't got no more constitution. She's broke to pieces. &gt;&gt; Everything's all smattering. The Republicans is just as bad. &gt;&gt; It's six of one, a half a dozen the other. For every kingdom is going to be smashed, but the kingdom of Jesus Christ shall stand and reign forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Up on Daniel saw the rock he out of the mountains and hit the political world back there and mashed it into a grinding powder like that like the wheat on a thrashing floor of a summertime. But that rock grew into a great mountain that spread over the he filled the whole heavens and earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. The political world's gone. Our nation is broke. &gt;&gt; You remember that? Brother Brandham said that thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Our nation is demolished. &gt;&gt; It'll never rise. &gt;&gt; She's gone like all the rest of the nations. &gt;&gt; It's the greatest nation in the world standing today. But the very seed of the devil has been planted into the hearts of the people. how I come into Hollywood, how he got out into the people and begin this and you can't tell them nothing. &gt;&gt; Get a president up there with try to close whiskey out and have prohibition and see what would happen. He'd be shot in two hours after you got &gt;&gt; sure you can't stand it. The whole world's against him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You couldn't do it. She's gone. She's invaded. &gt;&gt; And the spirit of communism has took over. &gt;&gt; Go to our schools today. Look at our school children. Our little fellas that go to school. You just ought to know what goes on. &gt;&gt; Little girls down here in the schools and things like that at the age of 14 and 15. Their mommy sent them to school wrecked morally dope fiends, dope addicts, cigarette puffers, everything else like that. And a little bitty age of little children like that. Amen. &gt;&gt; It'd be as hard to find a virgin among some of them as it would be to find a needle in a &gt;&gt; hay stack. &gt;&gt; Well, they have blanket dates for the boys and stretch on these river banks and everywhere else. And I can prove it to you, my friends. I would sit in the pool pit listening about of schools right here in our our counties right here in these counties that those little ladies dressing don't know, telling their mothers that they're going to different places and meeting boys and even prostituting on the streets of Louisville. &gt;&gt; What is it? and sing in choirs because they got a little social gospel stand there where preachers stand talking about little petty things and little bitty stories of the Bible or something like that instead of preaching repentance and bringing man and women to the altar. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Daddy walk in at night, light up the cigar, take a glass of beers, sit down and drink it. Mother's out through the daytime with a bunch of women, some card party, some social like that. How can you expect the child to be anything else? Amen. &gt;&gt; Let whatever environment you live in, that's what you are. &gt;&gt; You take a little bitty girl, little bitty boy, put him out here, let him live with somebody. You take a man, I can take my boy, let him be out for a day with somebody, let him come in. I'm going to tell you who he's been with. &gt;&gt; Certainly watch that environment that spirit catches him. You go into a church where the people all you go into Holy Ghost churches or or Pentecostal churches to call, let everybody be they run, jerk their head back and forth, the pastor does. Watch the whole church begin to do the same thing. &gt;&gt; Let the man the people get up and just carry on terrible or something. Watch the whole thing do that. Get into a place where the pastors real starchy and cold. Watch the whole group do it. &gt;&gt; You come into that environment. &gt;&gt; You take a man that's a good moral man and let him marry a little old woman ain't worth a dime. It isn't long and he ain't worth a dime either. &gt;&gt; That's what happened to Ahab. &gt;&gt; Take a same with eyes of mercy. Instead of that nice little woman, marry an old man that ain't worth a dime. &gt;&gt; The first thing you know, she's doing the same thing he is. &gt;&gt; How do I go this morning and point my hands on little broken up homes and things like that? Poor lovely little mothers coming into a drinking dad and things like that and thought they could do something with him and now the whole mother and all of them are drinking and going on. &gt;&gt; It's environment. What is it? It's the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the devil. &gt;&gt; The invasion. He swept into this nation like a roaring lion. &gt;&gt; He set himself down there in the best place he had in Hollywood. He said, "I get the movie share until the television comes on. Then I'll get them." &gt;&gt; And he stay down there and the church people instead of shutting down the shows and not letting their children go, they give them 10 cents on a Sunday afternoon and send them down there so they could have a little social card party, be out to theirel and ride around. &gt;&gt; Oh, why disgrace? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now just turn the television on it and watch all the dirty rotten Tommy rot there is in the world on it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I ain't got nothing against the movie. I ain't got nothing against the television. It's the rotten stuff that's on it. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. Could have kept it moral. It had stone. &gt;&gt; You couldn't sell old fashioned button shoes in town today at all. Women don't want them. They want the toes out of them. The rest of women's are doing it. That's right. When you go to church, you can't sell old time religion because the other woman, she don't know one do that. No sir. I know. Me and me go now. I just believe that's all there is to it. Oh, old brother. The devil breathes too. &gt;&gt; Have I right? You'll repent or perish. &gt;&gt; Now, sorry. No, I'm not. &gt;&gt; No, I'm not. No, I'll take that back. &gt;&gt; I love people. &gt;&gt; But I I love you too well to see you go into a headlong plunge like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God willing, I'll pick this up a little later on in the week. &gt;&gt; Now, to you mothers, it's mothers. Just a word to you before going. God bless you. You bring your children up, Ryan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We pick up this invasion. We got to go into the homes yet in a lot of places, the schools and out in places where we pick it up. But the invasion of the United States, the devil has tucker over. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid of Russia. Russia ain't got nothing to do. We're doing it ourselves. &gt;&gt; Our own rotten right among us. &gt;&gt; That's right. You know, the United States has more divorce cases than all the rest of the world. more divorces. Think of it. That horrible. The motherhood has been broken. Mothers don't stay home no more with their children like they used to. They got to have a job. Hear the other day a certain grocery in this city was talking to me about it. These women working at these public plants, these young married women with a bunch of little kids that got babysitters taking care of their babies. They work in these public places. Said there's two of them standing in the room. They got laid off at their public works. Don't worry, we'll make it anyhow. &gt;&gt; Oh, such an hour of prostitution at hand. &gt;&gt; Sure. The devil's done told them they're the boss of the house. &gt;&gt; They'll make their own money. They'll do what they wish to. &gt;&gt; You get it out of if you can. There's only one thing they get out of them. That's the offer before Jesus Christ. An oldfashioned tear stream religion that'll break their hearts and tear them to pieces and make them what they ought to be. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, you may think I'm just an old fogy, but the day when you're dying, my brother, sister, you'll realize that I told you the truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. She's on the invasion. The hour is sure. &gt;&gt; Not a Yes. an hour of decision, too. &gt;&gt; An hour of decision. Not to come to church, but an hour of decision whether you go to serve Christ or stay lukewarm in your church. &gt;&gt; That's right. There's plenty of church members. If all the the people of America that profess to be Christians, to be real Christians, born again Christians, brother, we'd be as safe as you'd be in heaven almost. &gt;&gt; Wars and trouble. Yes, sir. Diseases would leave the land. &gt;&gt; Everything else, would you like to come down the street and see or lady come by and how you sister? Good morning, brother. Well, that is not you one worry in the world. Everything's just fine and daddy and a fellow come to the street corner instead of trying to run over you, you stop. All right, brother. All right. Yeah. Oh, you prefer me. See, just prefer. Wouldn't that be wonderful? &gt;&gt; We're going to have it. That's in the millennium, brother. The day. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, now we're not I stood in our neighborhood day. Nothing against our neighborhood, but I can notice our little children. Wife is crying. A certain doctor of this town. There's a little girl was running around my little girl. and they love one another until they found out that her name was Brandon and she was Reverend Brandham's child. &gt;&gt; That settled it. Little girl couldn't go with that little girl anymore. Oh, I thought, well, okay. Some of the little neighbors run over there and said, well, it's all right. So, they went to their pastor. Don't tell me, you know, I have a way of knowing a lot of things, you see. So, they they went to their pastor and said, you know, there's a man lives in our neighborhood is so good to our children. Said it's Reverend Brandham. He takes them all in his little truck, takes them out. said, "Well, uh, we have nothing against Reverend Brandon. He's all right. But you see, he's just a different class of people than what we are. We, uh, I I would that you wouldn't be, you know, I wouldn't kind of You speak to him, friendly, but just let that be the end." &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, my wife's standing there crying. &gt;&gt; I said, "Sweetheart, it's a separating line. As for me in my house, we'll serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; All the world gives away still Jesus Christ. If I have to be called a fanatic, if I have to be shunned by my kins, my fellow man and things like that, I still choose Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hold to God's unchanging hand. When earthly friends forsake you, still more closer to him plain. Hold to him, God. Let me preach like I never before. Let me preach to dying man as a dying man myself. Let me preach to people like I never have another sermon to preach. Let me persuade them to come to the a streaming faces of deer. Go back home and live like Christians and live in their neighborhood. Stop all this. You're frolick and running around and jumping and carrying on and acting this way and blowing up at this and going that way. Oh, don't do that. That's the devil. Them demon spirits. Come on, Christians. Remember those ministers down there? There was them prophets. They were prophets. &gt;&gt; They were religious men offering a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; They were just as religious as the teachers of this day. But brother, they was a long ways from knowing the truth. Don't you see how religious the devil is? &gt;&gt; The devil's not no anti-gra big thing like communism all against Christianity. That's not that's a war. The devil, sure, but it's not the antichrist. &gt;&gt; The antichrist is very religious. &gt;&gt; Very religious. It was a religious spirit that crucified Jesus. It's always been a religious world, a religious people that crucified. It's a religious people that was against the true Christ. It was religious prophets that was against Micah. &gt;&gt; It's the religious people of the day. That's against the message of God. &gt;&gt; Remember, I have warned you. I have told you. &gt;&gt; I ain't speaking so much about Catholicism and Baptist. I'm talking about people's holiness people right down these lines here. Look at it today. I come across and standing in drama. Oh my, I go into it sometime and my heart breaks within me. Stand up there with an old banjo beating that old banjo and sawing an old fiddle like that. Is this Texas cowboy so and so? I ain't got nothing against the man but that bones out there in the world out there, &gt;&gt; right? I'd rather stand, brother, with not even a thing of no nothing to hold but just stand and raise my hand and say, "Jesus, keep me near the cross." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Consecrated cross I'll bear till death shall set me free. They go home a crown to wear for there's a crown for me. Amen. Hammy can say amen to that. You know, I thank God for this this message.
