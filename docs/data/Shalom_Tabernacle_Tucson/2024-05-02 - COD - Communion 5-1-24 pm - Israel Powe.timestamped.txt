[29:52] and we thank him for bringing us
[29:55] together once again amen we'll switch
[29:57] this mic s and let's bow our heads
[30:06] for Heavenly Father we just thank you
[30:08] for bringing us together once again we
[30:11] pray that you'll bless the service Lord
[30:13] and as we've gathered in Your Name Lord
[30:15] we come to give you the praise we thank
[30:19] you for all your many blessings father
[30:22] Lord what would our life be without you
[30:25] and you're the purpose for our existence
[30:28] Lord and everything else must be focused
[30:31] and centered around you Lord You're the
[30:33] very source of our life and without you
[30:37] lord we can't do nothing father I pray
[30:40] that as we approach your word may you
[30:42] minister to every heart in the mighty
[30:45] name of Jesus Christ we pray Let each
[30:47] one receive their portion in Jesus name
[30:50] amen so God bless you we like to go
[30:54] right into the word we had a little cond
[30:58] order and doctrine that we have been
[30:59] taking and sister Norma I she asked
[31:03] about communion a little bit and I was
[31:05] going to bring that anyways in um in
[31:09] that order of things
[31:12] um and so in First Corinthians 11 we
[31:15] like to go for our scripture
[31:17] reading and this is a subject that I
[31:20] have spoken on many times here at the
[31:23] church typically on a communion
[31:26] service and what it does is it just
[31:29] brings the importance of what it is into
[31:33] a greater light so in 1 Corinthians 11
[31:36] we like to turn there
[31:38] quickly I want to thank you all for your
[31:40] prayers as I as you all heard the
[31:43] passing of my brother Jay on Sunday
[31:46] evening the Lord called him home and you
[31:49] know I was just getting ready for
[31:51] service I was in set right down right
[31:54] there to hear the tape and just got
[31:57] through worshiping
[31:58] which just so relaxed and just a good
[32:01] atmosphere listening to the prophet and
[32:03] I got that text in those news and his
[32:06] time of death was death was
[32:09] 457 right before our service started and
[32:12] um I thought
[32:14] well that's what I want to be doing when
[32:17] the Lord calls me home I want to be in
[32:19] church somewhere getting ready to hear
[32:20] somebody preach or maybe I'm about to
[32:23] preach myself and and just call me on
[32:26] home Lord and that's the way you know
[32:28] life happens that way and so that's the
[32:31] way the Lord called him home and I I was
[32:33] I thank the Lord that um he has given us
[32:37] a peace during these times amen so God
[32:39] bless you thank you so much for your
[32:41] prayers I can feel those prayers and for
[32:44] me I I process things if I keep moving
[32:46] forward then I just get things done and
[32:49] that's how I go so you say brother is
[32:52] well take a break if I take a break you
[32:54] might not like me so let me keep doing
[32:57] doing what I do that's what works for me
[33:00] all right so pray for me thank you so
[33:02] much in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 verse
[33:06] says number one says Be You followers of
[33:10] me even as I also am of Christ now I
[33:15] Praise You Brethren that you remember me
[33:18] in all things and keep the ordinances as
[33:22] I delivered them to you may God add a
[33:27] blessing to the reading of his word you
[33:29] may be
[33:30] seated so we took conduct order and
[33:34] Doctrine and under
[33:36] order Sister Jesse L so good to have you
[33:39] back man we would have put you to work
[33:42] for
[33:43] sure but uh brother Zach jumped right in
[33:47] did a wonderful job tonight and we
[33:49] appreciate that brother Zach
[33:51] amen amen so that's the way it goes in
[33:55] Ministry just instant in season and out
[33:57] the season so the order um conduct order
[34:03] and Doctrine order under
[34:05] ordinances we would just take it like
[34:08] that that um we talked about The
[34:12] Gatekeepers and the
[34:14] officers and like even on our
[34:17] board they are called officers of the
[34:20] board and the Army and the military have
[34:23] these titles and headings for leaders
[34:26] and Leadership but under the order and
[34:29] ordinances uh one of the things that has
[34:31] been established into the to the church
[34:34] is this communion service and um not
[34:38] just the communion the foot washing and
[34:41] brother random ties in water
[34:44] baptism now this what we do today is the
[34:49] we're looking back at the shadow which
[34:51] was in Exodus chapter 12 when the Lord
[34:54] was delivering Israel um from the great
[34:58] Exodus there he had them to kill a
[35:02] lamb at midnight and all the remains of
[35:07] the Lamb were not to remain for the next
[35:10] day and that's a a type of what we do as
[35:13] we
[35:14] burn that which remains in the communion
[35:18] service and the importance of it is that
[35:21] every
[35:22] believer um should take this order and
[35:25] this communion service brother the
[35:27] random calls at the sweetest one of the
[35:29] sweetest services in the Christian
[35:32] church and you know it's interesting how
[35:35] many have over the ages or over time and
[35:39] we've seen it in churches that that
[35:42] Wednesday night service and the
[35:44] communion service sometimes many times
[35:47] are the the least attended
[35:51] service and um part of that could be
[35:55] just the fear or just the the
[35:57] condemnation associated with it some
[36:00] people feel like they're not worthy
[36:02] enough to take the
[36:04] communion and um definitely Jesus gives
[36:08] us the or the or the Apostle Paul says
[36:11] that let a man examine
[36:13] himself before doing that because he
[36:16] that eateth and drinketh eateth and
[36:19] drinketh Damnation to himself but we do
[36:22] understand that the early Christian
[36:25] Church partook of the Lord's suff
[36:28] every time they
[36:29] met and so if you're not worthy enough
[36:33] this Sunday you're probably not gonna be
[36:36] worthy enough next Sunday either because
[36:39] you're not looking at it right that's
[36:41] right because we'll never be worthy
[36:43] enough let's just settle that none of us
[36:46] are even worthy to open the book or even
[36:50] look at it but he made a way for us to
[36:54] be worthy that we can take it with
[36:56] confidence not looking at ourselves but
[36:59] we're looking at the sacrifice that was
[37:01] paid for our sins and so in first number
[37:06] 23 in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 verse 23
[37:09] have your Bibles we can read that it
[37:11] says for I've received of the Lord that
[37:14] which also I delivered unto you that the
[37:17] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[37:19] was betrayed he took bread and when he
[37:22] had given thanks he break it and said
[37:25] take eat this is my body which is broken
[37:29] for you this do in remembrance of me
[37:34] after the same manner also he took the
[37:36] cup when he had s saying this cup is the
[37:39] New Testament in my blood this do ye as
[37:43] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[37:46] me can you all help me read this let's
[37:48] all take verse 26 all the way through
[37:51] not too fast but just but loud and but
[37:54] not too fast let's all read together
[37:57] like good fivey olds can do all right or
[38:01] 10 year olds at least alog together
[38:04] verse 26 for
[38:07] I this bread drink
[38:15] cup
[38:26] wherefor of
[38:30] [Music]
[38:41] and
[38:52] himself judge ourselves we should not be
[38:56] judged but when we are judged we are
[38:59] chasen of the Lord that we should not be
[39:02] condemned with the world wherefore my
[39:05] brethren when you come together to eat
[39:09] carry one for another and if any man
[39:12] hunger let him eat at home that you come
[39:16] not together to condemnation and the
[39:19] rest will I set in order when I come and
[39:25] that's what we're talking about order
[39:28] what I'd like to see uh brother George
[39:30] and brother Joe and all the saints of
[39:33] the most high god what I would love to
[39:35] see is a communion
[39:37] service crowd look like a Sunday morning
[39:41] crowd that would be
[39:43] beautiful that your Wednesday night your
[39:46] Sunday night service would look just
[39:48] like a Sunday morning
[39:52] service and this communion service has a
[39:56] type and their strengths that are woven
[40:00] into it and so we'll take a few quotes
[40:03] on this what the prophet of God says
[40:08] about the apostles that when they came
[40:11] together every time paragraph number 53
[40:14] in the
[40:15] message questions and answers he says
[40:18] the apostles who was the preachers they
[40:21] continually steadfast in their doctrine
[40:24] of breaking of bread communion and in
[40:26] Fellowship and in prayer then if that
[40:29] cuts out communion from the Apostle it
[40:32] also cuts out prayer from the apostles
[40:35] see now let's just read on see that was
[40:39] a doctrine of the Apostles of the early
[40:41] church that every time they came
[40:44] together they taken communion every
[40:48] time now I know you Christian people who
[40:50] got the Christian church the calite
[40:52] church as we know it as because there's
[40:55] two of them one is the Church of Christ
[40:57] the other one the calite church you say
[40:59] we take it every Sunday morning we got
[41:02] the scriptures on it you have better
[41:04] scriptures on it than the brandham
[41:06] Tabernacle does the brandham Tabernacle
[41:09] takes it once a month but the scripture
[41:12] is that as of as you come together
[41:15] that's right every
[41:18] time and so that was the early Christian
[41:21] church and he's applauding the camelite
[41:24] church that they take it every service
[41:27] every time they meet they would take it
[41:29] together and I don't want this to be
[41:32] well if a church isn't taking it every
[41:34] 30 days then they're wrong uh the
[41:38] brandom Tabernacle did it once a month
[41:40] that's the pattern that we follow we
[41:43] take it once a month uh as the Lord
[41:45] would provide for
[41:48] us there I know some Churches take it
[41:50] once a year I think it's Jehovah
[41:52] Witnesses have a memorial service once a
[41:55] year that nobody partakes of it because
[41:57] it's only for the 144,000 so they'll
[42:00] take that those elements they'll pass it
[42:02] all the way through their whole crowd it
[42:04] could be 200 could be a thousand or
[42:07] their great memorial service and no one
[42:10] will partake of it because that's only
[42:12] for the
[42:14] 144,000 and if you happen to be visiting
[42:16] with them and you partake of it they'll
[42:19] probably roll their eyes at
[42:21] you because oh no that's just for the
[42:25] 144,000 when I first heard that the the
[42:27] man at the paint store that was my rep
[42:30] he to he's Jehovah Witness and he told
[42:31] me that and I said have you in your
[42:34] lifetime ever seen anybody part take of
[42:37] it and he's been a Jehovah Witness most
[42:39] of his life he said he saw one or two
[42:42] partake of the Lord's supper and I said
[42:45] have you ever heard of somebody
[42:46] partaking and they backslid in the
[42:49] Jehovah wi he says yeah I says well they
[42:52] kind of got that wrong didn't they I
[42:54] thought it was only 144,000 so in years
[42:57] from now there's no original 144,000
[43:01] left on the earth so it's just a
[43:04] memorial service and nobody partakes of
[43:07] it um
[43:10] but but it was every time that the
[43:12] Christ the early Christian Church
[43:14] partook of it and um brother bam
[43:17] continues in the message desperations
[43:19] and he says this in paragraph
[43:22] 193 so he's praying for the elements and
[43:25] he says this sanctify the wine for its
[43:28] intended purpose May whoever drinks this
[43:31] wine tonight and takes of this bread
[43:33] have strength for the journey that lays
[43:36] ahead granted Lord may they be healthy
[43:40] and strong and filled with your spirit
[43:43] till Jesus
[43:44] come I believe that communion is one of
[43:48] the most solemn sacred sweetest worships
[43:52] there is in the church service there was
[43:55] two things left us three things to do
[43:58] that's orders and ordinances so many
[44:01] people try to say we got the original
[44:03] nail we got a piece of the Cross but
[44:04] there was three things left Lord's
[44:07] Supper baptism feet washing was the
[44:10] three orders that was left to the
[44:14] church so now brother banam is
[44:17] highlighting the sweetness of a
[44:19] communion service what does that really
[44:22] mean what is the antitype as we're
[44:25] partaking of the element
[44:27] the the bread and the wine um what is it
[44:32] looking back to well it's looking back
[44:33] to Exodus chap 12 when they're getting
[44:36] ready to leave on a tremendous
[44:40] journey and this journey would require
[44:44] Grace and strength to live and go
[44:47] through the Wilderness and so the Lord
[44:50] prepares them now I I'm certain that the
[44:53] Hebrews partaking of the lamb and the
[44:57] the indication of somebody would die if
[44:59] it's not done properly I'm sure they
[45:02] didn't understand all the types and
[45:03] shadows of it I'm sure they didn't
[45:06] understand that their clothes would
[45:07] never wear down and their strength would
[45:10] never Abate them I'm sure they there's
[45:13] many of them didn't understand it but
[45:15] they were just following the message
[45:18] that God gave Moses and later as the
[45:21] journey continued on we see the blessing
[45:24] of why this stayed with them it started
[45:28] at that memory that memorial service it
[45:31] started at this entrance in uh to this
[45:36] journey so brother Adam uses that in his
[45:38] prayer many times in the communion
[45:41] service journey journey
[45:44] journeying
[45:46] Grace Grace for the
[45:49] journey and many times he includes Lord
[45:54] may they be healthy and strong
[45:57] may they be strong and and and it it
[46:00] requires strength to serve the Lord it
[46:04] requires an unknown strength it's not
[46:06] just mind power it's not just knowing
[46:08] what's right but it takes a strength to
[46:11] serve the Lord the scripture tells us to
[46:14] be strong in the Lord and the power of
[46:15] His might where does strength come from
[46:19] strength comes from the Lord and he lays
[46:22] out simple things for us to do we talked
[46:25] about it Sunday morning about reading
[46:27] your Bible and praying every there's a
[46:30] strength taking place spiritually as you
[46:33] read the word of God It's Supernatural
[46:36] it's above our ideas or our thought
[46:39] process you can't figure it out just do
[46:41] it because he said to do it and God will
[46:44] bless you yes sir and look at the old
[46:46] saints that did it you look at the old
[46:49] saints that are still around and you'll
[46:52] see that they typically have a beautiful
[46:54] Church attendance and more more likely
[46:57] than not they're very faithful at the
[46:59] communion service I've watched that and
[47:02] you look around and you see that you see
[47:05] the kind of the families that are
[47:07] struggling they're here and there
[47:09] they're kind of in and out that kind of
[47:11] goes right along with have you been
[47:14] washing the Saints
[47:15] feet have you been taking the Lord's
[47:18] supper and then yet you they have all
[47:21] these issues and problems with this
[47:23] family and that one and that Doctrine
[47:25] and this issue and that and work issues
[47:27] and they won't even they're not doing
[47:29] the simple things that he commanded us
[47:31] to
[47:32] do and it starts right there paragraph
[47:35] 36 in the message living dying buried
[47:39] Rising coming prophet of God says this
[47:45] here I'm sorry let's let's not take that
[47:48] let's
[47:49] take let's take this one here in the
[47:52] message communion the last uh message
[47:54] here 1965 here in two paragraph number
[47:58] 76 he says this here this stuck out to
[48:01] me when he when I first heard him say
[48:03] this he says when we take this it shows
[48:07] to the church that I believe every word
[48:10] of
[48:11] God I believe that he is the bread of
[48:14] life that come from God out of Heaven I
[48:17] believe every word that he says is the
[48:19] truth and I believe by it to the best of
[48:22] my knowledge God being my judge
[48:25] therefore before my brothers before my
[48:27] sisters I do not swear I do not curse I
[48:30] do not do these things because I love
[48:32] the Lord and the Lord knows it and bears
[48:35] me record therefore before you I take
[48:38] the parcel of his body to know that I'm
[48:41] not condemned with the world so there
[48:44] you are then it's a
[48:48] blessing and remember I can give many
[48:51] testimonies on this where I took and
[48:54] explained it in the sick room and seen
[48:57] them healed remember when Israel taking
[49:00] this type the type of this they Journey
[49:03] 40 years in the wilderness and their
[49:05] clothes never even wore out they come
[49:08] out without one feeble one one among
[49:11] them with two million people as a type
[49:13] of this well what would the anti-type do
[49:16] if the body of the sacrificial animal
[49:19] did that for them what would the body of
[49:22] Jesus Christ Emmanuel do for us let's
[49:26] just be reverent when we come let us be
[49:29] just as reverent as we know how to
[49:32] come so this communion it shows to the
[49:38] church that I believe every word when
[49:40] you partake of the bread it shows that I
[49:43] believe every word and this is the goal
[49:46] of the believer remember I was sharing
[49:48] with you one of the outside emotions
[49:51] outward actions of someone's
[49:54] spirituality is there con an uh uh
[49:58] attendance to the house of God when the
[50:00] doors are open they're there well
[50:03] communion would kind of go into that
[50:05] spirituality of a person as
[50:08] well just knowing a person like if I
[50:11] came into the city for the first time
[50:14] and normally it's not a weekday it's
[50:16] usually weekend special meetings and you
[50:18] see a church you don't really get the
[50:19] temperature of the church but if I was
[50:21] to ask the pastor who in here actually
[50:24] takes communion and that would be enough
[50:28] for me to know how spiritual they are
[50:32] how serious they are because it's easy
[50:35] to set back I won't say it's easy but
[50:37] it's it's I've seen people set back and
[50:41] miss the communion service service
[50:43] seemingly they miss it on
[50:46] purpose because it's been announced we
[50:49] know it's going to be there and I I have
[50:51] to say our church here we seem like
[50:54] there's a great attendance on Sunday
[50:56] night wouldn't you all say that I'm
[50:58] really pleased I think it's beautiful
[50:59] I've been to many churches and that
[51:02] communion service it it thins out the
[51:03] crowd many times or Wednesday night but
[51:07] you know it's an outward it's an outward
[51:10] um
[51:12] indication what what would you say if
[51:14] one of the brothers on the board that's
[51:17] serving you didn't take
[51:19] communion wouldn't that be a question
[51:21] mark it's not that he ain't saved it's
[51:23] not a Salvation issue but it does put a
[51:26] question in his
[51:28] spirituality is he handling the word
[51:31] with the seriousness that it's been
[51:33] given to us so these are outward
[51:36] indications not to go around judging
[51:38] folks but I am looking at you and you're
[51:40] looking at me too that's right and if I
[51:43] ran in here late every
[51:46] service or I'm out there chatting it up
[51:48] with everybody in the parking lot then I
[51:50] run up here and try to scramble and get
[51:52] my notes together and then the service
[51:54] ain't right then y'all looking at me
[51:58] right I wouldn't have confidence in that
[52:02] right and so what about any other office
[52:05] what about any other believer all right
[52:07] so brother random says in the message
[52:10] contest I'm G try to keep this very very
[52:12] short paragraph number seven he says
[52:14] Lord Jesus Oh the battle will be over
[52:17] someday and there will be no more sick
[52:19] to be prayed for and there'll be no more
[52:22] Sinners to repent but father while this
[52:24] day is what it is let us work work while
[52:27] we have light to work in for the hour
[52:30] cometh with no man can work now just for
[52:33] a few moments Lord I feel bad if I
[52:35] didn't close off this year without
[52:37] saying a few more
[52:39] words he continues on help me father I
[52:44] pray that was in the contest I'm sorry I
[52:46] hope I got that right help me father I
[52:49] pray
[52:50] that I might say something that would
[52:53] plant courage in the heart of thy people
[52:56] that we could leave here tonight after
[52:58] taking the communion and realize that in
[53:01] the communion there is
[53:04] strength see the weak Christians and
[53:07] then you become more weak when you don't
[53:09] take
[53:10] it that the communion realize that in
[53:13] the communion there is strength Israel
[53:17] took the communion first down in Egypt
[53:19] walked 40 years without their shoes
[53:22] wearing out their clothes getting
[53:24] threadbear and out of two milon people
[53:27] there wasn't a feeble one among them
[53:29] when they come out of the Wilderness
[53:31] Lord let us remember that tonight as we
[53:34] approach this great hour in Jesus name
[53:37] we pray
[53:40] amen paragraph 59 in the message contest
[53:44] he says this thank you Father
[53:47] now sanctify the wine for its intended
[53:50] use and may every person that partakes
[53:53] of this Sacrament tonight receive
[53:57] spiritual and physical strength for the
[54:01] journey that lays ahead where we ask it
[54:04] in Jesus name Amen Let Us bow our heads
[54:09] now while we bless this wine our
[54:11] heavenly father when I think as I hold
[54:13] this wine here that represents the blood
[54:16] of Jesus how that through that flowing
[54:19] blood my sins are gone they are put in
[54:22] the sea of forgetfulness to be
[54:23] remembered no more with this Blood a
[54:26] dying boy one day laid Yonder in the
[54:29] hospital and you saved me oh God how I
[54:32] thank thee Lord and then give me the
[54:35] charge by the Holy Spirit to lead the
[54:37] people to Calvary and show them the way
[54:39] home thank you Father now sanctify this
[54:44] wine for its attended use May every
[54:47] person that partakes of this sacrite
[54:49] Sacrament tonight receive spiritual and
[54:53] physical strength for the journey that
[54:56] lays ahead that's a powerful prayer how
[55:00] many need spiritual
[55:03] strength but how many can use some
[55:05] physical strength too so many people are
[55:07] just tired just The Daily Grind is
[55:12] tiring and you just need strength Lord
[55:15] give me
[55:16] strength that I can be where you want me
[55:19] to
[55:19] be and that strength is in that
[55:23] communion service I want us to look at
[55:25] it that way like going to the gym and
[55:29] working out is going to help you
[55:32] physically but spiritually taking the
[55:34] communion this is going to help you
[55:36] physically and spiritually all right
[55:39] paragraph 73 in the message
[55:41] ordination brother branam says this do
[55:45] you know that communion has Divine
[55:48] Healing in it yes when the Israelites
[55:51] and the type took the communion and
[55:53] March 40 years and when they come out of
[55:55] the Wilderness there wasn't a feeble one
[55:58] among them two and a half million people
[56:00] there is power of healing in the
[56:05] communion so why wouldn't we want to
[56:07] receive that how many's ever been healed
[56:11] in the communion service see the hands
[56:14] see that and now when it's taught and
[56:17] you read these
[56:18] quotations doesn't that help your faith
[56:21] when you take it now it really shows you
[56:24] what's taking place it's not just you
[56:27] know form every month but there's
[56:29] there's strength in it and you're
[56:31] showing to the entire church that I
[56:33] believe every word it's a testimony to
[56:36] the rest of the Believers that are
[56:38] watching that are gathered around it is
[56:41] part of our
[56:45] service paragraph 135 in G in the
[56:49] message communion
[56:51] 1962 most holy God whose servants we are
[56:54] in the name of Jesus Christ
[56:56] sanctify this bread for its intended use
[56:59] to to make us as we receive it remember
[57:03] that our Lord was crucified and his body
[57:05] precious and holy as it was was mingled
[57:08] with stripes and thorns and nails for us
[57:11] that through his Riven body came forth
[57:14] the spirit that gives us eternal life
[57:17] may we lord as we eat this have
[57:21] journeying Grace as Israel did 40 years
[57:25] in the wilderness not a feeble one among
[57:27] them Father God grant this as we pray
[57:31] you sanctify this bread kosher bread for
[57:34] its intended use in Jesus name amen the
[57:38] cup of the New Testament the blood I
[57:40] think of that song ever since by faith I
[57:43] saw that stream thy flowing wound Supply
[57:46] redeeming love has been my theme and
[57:48] shall be till I die when I see this
[57:51] Blood grapes the blood of grapes I know
[57:54] it represents the blood that came forth
[57:56] from the Lord Jesus body May every May
[58:01] ever who receives this have eternal life
[58:03] may sickness depart out of their bodies
[58:07] May weariness and feebleness oppression
[58:11] May the devil in every form leave them
[58:16] that they might have great strength and
[58:20] health and eternal life to let their
[58:23] life light shine before for this wicked
[58:27] and adulterous generation we live in to
[58:30] the glory of God Amen so when it's
[58:34] presented as optional that's how people
[58:37] will take it as optional but when it's
[58:40] presented that this is an ordinance that
[58:42] God has laid out for a church that any
[58:45] man that's coming to Christ as he grows
[58:48] spiritually he's going to find himself
[58:51] partaking of the Lord's Supper it's part
[58:54] of the experience
[58:56] as I certainly appreciate the burden
[58:59] brother will has for the folks on the
[59:02] reservation and you know you you see the
[59:04] little group coming together around the
[59:06] word and then you know you you'll know
[59:09] there's growth not when the numbers come
[59:11] but what but when the
[59:13] Believers start to ask for another
[59:17] service when the prayer meeting there's
[59:20] people that actually show up for that
[59:22] now everybody's not going to show up for
[59:23] a prayer meeting but when you make it
[59:25] Ava ailable there's somebody that's
[59:28] looking forward to
[59:30] that and and as a young man being raised
[59:34] up in the churches and the different
[59:35] churches I've been through in my life
[59:38] the prayer meeting was a Lifeline for me
[59:41] I needed one during the week to come in
[59:46] I loved it I I appreciated it and I know
[59:51] there's many Believers that do not all
[59:52] people will not all people see the
[59:54] importance of it but but when you make
[59:56] it available two or three that's all you
[59:59] need that's right that's it we can have
[1:00:03] church and God will bless us period he
[1:00:09] said it in his word this is not a guest
[1:00:11] this is not a hope so he said I'll be
[1:00:13] there and he's he's going to bless that
[1:00:15] and if it's in his will others will
[1:00:18] catch on and they will come
[1:00:21] too and then you move forward and then
[1:00:24] you want to see those believers
[1:00:26] get to the place where they can take the
[1:00:28] Lord's Supper in communion and the foot
[1:00:31] washing and you want to see those
[1:00:33] Believers receive the Holy Ghost amen
[1:00:37] and so you know like you you star in a
[1:00:40] church you don't have deacons you don't
[1:00:43] have officers you don't have a lot of
[1:00:44] things so you start somewhere I think
[1:00:46] the greatest thing you start with is the
[1:00:48] word of God you stay with that word you
[1:00:52] preach that word and then let the Lord
[1:00:54] bless that and then prayer meeting you
[1:00:57] can never pray tooo much offer that
[1:00:59] prayer meeting during the week whatever
[1:01:02] however and God will bless it and that's
[1:01:05] what we like to see for every believer
[1:01:07] in every little group
[1:01:10] amen because we know what's going
[1:01:13] on we know that physical and spiritual
[1:01:17] strength is taking place when I do this
[1:01:21] I want to be 90 years old if the Lord
[1:01:24] help me and be able to take the Lord's
[1:01:27] Supper amen that would be
[1:01:30] beautiful don't you think yes we have a
[1:01:34] few in our midst that we we serve it to
[1:01:36] over 90 sister wheeler sister what's the
[1:01:40] other sister's name your grandmother
[1:01:41] great grandmother sister Lucille these
[1:01:44] these folks that are interested in that
[1:01:46] and I thank the Lord for it so paragraph
[1:01:51] 190 I think brother uh brother Al
[1:01:54] Peterson took it with us when he was in
[1:01:57] his 90s he would still come to the house
[1:01:59] of the Lord said that's me right there
[1:02:02] praise the Lord if the Lord helped me I
[1:02:04] want to be a old guy in the house of the
[1:02:06] Lord don't you if the Lord carries
[1:02:11] amen paragraph 190 in this message the
[1:02:15] comforter brother random says this now
[1:02:18] we're coming to the communion table to
[1:02:19] take those Parcels that was left us in
[1:02:23] order this do until he returns well
[1:02:25] thank for these things father and we
[1:02:28] pray that in jesus' name that if there
[1:02:30] be a feeble person among us tonight that
[1:02:33] comes to this communion
[1:02:35] table Lord I can just see that shaking
[1:02:39] old mother of mine walking up the owl
[1:02:42] there the last time she was in here to
[1:02:45] take that communion how her little old
[1:02:48] trembling hand shook over that plate I
[1:02:51] stood here and watched her with tears
[1:02:53] dropping in my heart but there she lays
[1:02:56] tonight facing Calvary oh God how
[1:02:58] thankful I am you said he that eats my
[1:03:01] flesh and drinks my blood has eternal
[1:03:05] life and I'll raise him up again at the
[1:03:08] last day
[1:03:11] amen now
[1:03:13] so we see the importance of the
[1:03:16] communion amen we see that there's
[1:03:18] strength in there so let's just take a
[1:03:22] few quotations I think I have a little
[1:03:24] more time on on this tering and brother
[1:03:30] Ram talks about Terry the scripture
[1:03:32] talks about wherefore you come together
[1:03:35] Terry one for another 1 Corinthians
[1:03:39] 11:33 and the prophet of God says this
[1:03:42] let's see if I got it right now it said
[1:03:46] I don't think I gave you this one sis
[1:03:48] but I'm sure you can find it this is in
[1:03:50] communion 1963 July the 7th
[1:03:56] now it said when you come together Terry
[1:03:58] one for the other and that really would
[1:04:01] be like this Terry one with the
[1:04:05] other Terry means to wait wait on each
[1:04:08] other and let's do that now I'll pray
[1:04:11] for you if you know anything that you've
[1:04:14] done wrong say God forgive me if you
[1:04:17] know anything that you've done wrong say
[1:04:19] God forgive me I didn't mean that and if
[1:04:21] you'll help me from this night on I
[1:04:24] won't do it again I mean it Lord I won't
[1:04:27] do it again if you'll just forgive me
[1:04:30] and upon my confession I believe you
[1:04:32] have forgiv me I go to take the body of
[1:04:35] Christ filling in my heart that you
[1:04:37] forgive me for all my sin I pray then I
[1:04:41] pray then for your secret sin you pray
[1:04:44] for mine that may be something we don't
[1:04:47] know about that we won't come together
[1:04:50] condemned with the world we don't want
[1:04:53] the world in here this little spot up
[1:04:55] people that God has give us to worship
[1:04:57] with here we want to keep ourselves
[1:04:59] clean from
[1:05:01] selfishness keep our thing our sin Our
[1:05:04] Lives clean from all things of the world
[1:05:07] that we be not spotted with that we want
[1:05:10] to be ready for the Rapture so let us
[1:05:12] pray now silently for one another just
[1:05:16] you pray for me as I pray for you then
[1:05:20] there's silence for 31 seconds followed
[1:05:22] by Brother Bram praying so this brings
[1:05:25] this t carrying into it's not just me
[1:05:29] it's
[1:05:30] us you're praying for me and I'm praying
[1:05:33] for you maybe you did something you
[1:05:36] can't see maybe I did something Lord
[1:05:39] forgive her forgive him help them Lord
[1:05:42] help her help us we're all praying
[1:05:45] that's tering with one another it's not
[1:05:50] selfish it's a family affair it's a
[1:05:52] church body Affair that we t one for
[1:05:56] another and I love his prayer in there
[1:05:59] is Lord there's a promise Lord I won't
[1:06:02] do it again forgive me for my wrongs
[1:06:06] from this day forward I won't do it
[1:06:09] again how many's ever have to pray that
[1:06:12] prayer every human being that's a
[1:06:15] Christian has had to ask God to forgive
[1:06:17] them and so this is where we carry one
[1:06:20] for another brother random gives a
[1:06:23] number of examples for that
[1:06:29] now let's take a
[1:06:32] scripture on the foot washing just for a
[1:06:36] moment as we prepare to to
[1:06:39] close but in St
[1:06:47] John chapter 13
[1:07:04] it's quite clear that many of the
[1:07:05] organizations and denominations just
[1:07:07] flat out don't wash feet
[1:07:10] anymore but it was actually one of the
[1:07:14] requirements for a church to take a
[1:07:16] widow in is did she wash the Saints feet
[1:07:20] was she a part of that service is that
[1:07:22] part of her do she have that humility
[1:07:25] and that care and that giving but in
[1:07:29] verse number two it says and supper
[1:07:30] being ended the devil having now put in
[1:07:32] the heart of Judas the scariot Simon his
[1:07:35] son to betray him Jesus knowing that the
[1:07:38] father had given all things into his
[1:07:39] hands that he was come from God and went
[1:07:42] to God he rised from supper he laid
[1:07:45] aside His Garment and took a towel and
[1:07:48] girded
[1:07:50] himself now there's this you know uh let
[1:07:53] me stop here just for a moment so here's
[1:07:55] the order that we do we
[1:07:57] partake of the elements The Bread and
[1:08:00] Wine and then we go into the foot
[1:08:04] washing and I've heard it among some of
[1:08:07] the brothers that it really should be
[1:08:10] the other way around we should wash feet
[1:08:14] first and then partake of the elements
[1:08:17] because of the time slau or the way
[1:08:19] things
[1:08:21] were but you know the prophet didn't
[1:08:23] bring it that way so why we why would we
[1:08:25] want to change that and so it's like
[1:08:28] okay whatever order you decide to do it
[1:08:30] in I like to follow the way the prophet
[1:08:32] did it and the way the scriptures have
[1:08:33] it laid out here but he rised from
[1:08:36] supper he laid aside His Garment and he
[1:08:38] took a towel and girded
[1:08:40] himself after that he poured water into
[1:08:42] a basin he began to wash the disciples
[1:08:45] feet and to Wi them with the towel
[1:08:47] wherewith he was guard GED then cometh
[1:08:50] he the Simon Peter and Peter saith unto
[1:08:53] him Lord does thou wash my feet and
[1:08:57] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[1:08:59] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[1:09:02] know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou
[1:09:05] shalt never wash my feet and Jesus
[1:09:09] answered him and said it's okay Peter
[1:09:13] you don't have to wash my feet you don't
[1:09:16] you took the communion it's not that
[1:09:18] important you know your feet are
[1:09:20] probably clean
[1:09:21] anyways what's the big deal uh that's
[1:09:25] not what Jesus said what he saying it's
[1:09:29] pretty strong what Jesus tells him what
[1:09:32] does Jesus tell
[1:09:35] him Jesus said if I wash thee not thou
[1:09:38] has has no part with
[1:09:41] me it seems humble for Peter to say Lord
[1:09:47] I don't want you to wash my feet it
[1:09:50] seems humble but real humility is
[1:09:54] following the word word yes sir because
[1:09:57] you're humbling yourself to the word
[1:10:01] first now it might look honorable it
[1:10:04] might look humble but if the word gives
[1:10:06] you a commandment that's what you're
[1:10:07] supposed to do see I'm not worthy I'm
[1:10:10] not worthy to take communion you know
[1:10:13] that's only for you know g no nobody is
[1:10:16] worthy well if the word tells you to
[1:10:18] take it then you should humble yourself
[1:10:20] to what the word says it's not about
[1:10:23] your feelings of how you feel whether
[1:10:25] you're worthy or not is what does the
[1:10:27] word say and ultimately we humble
[1:10:30] ourselves to the word amen and that's
[1:10:35] the beauty of it is that Jesus laid this
[1:10:39] example for us and so he continues and
[1:10:42] Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never
[1:10:44] wash my feet if I wash thee not thou
[1:10:46] Hast no part with me Simon Peter saith
[1:10:48] unto him Lord not my feet only but also
[1:10:51] my hands and my head Jesus said to him
[1:10:54] he that
[1:10:56] is wash needeth not safe to wash his
[1:10:58] feet but is clean every wit and ye are
[1:11:01] clean but not all for he knew who should
[1:11:05] betray
[1:11:06] him verse
[1:11:08] 13 know ye what I have done to you you
[1:11:11] call me master and Lord you say well for
[1:11:14] so I am if I then your Lord and Master
[1:11:18] have wash your feet you also ought to
[1:11:23] wash one another's feet
[1:11:25] why for I have given you an
[1:11:29] example that ye should do as I have done
[1:11:34] to
[1:11:35] you verily verily I say unto you the
[1:11:38] servant is not greater than his Lord so
[1:11:41] if the Lord do it it so can't the
[1:11:43] servant do it too I've given you an
[1:11:46] example so the churches that don't do it
[1:11:49] what can they do with this scripture
[1:11:51] they have to say it doesn't mean that
[1:11:53] today well if this doesn't mean that
[1:11:56] then what other scriptures don't mean
[1:11:58] that either like John
[1:12:01] 3:16 if you know these things happy are
[1:12:05] ye if you do then see the happiness now
[1:12:08] yes sir you see the oppression and the
[1:12:11] depression and all the stress you see
[1:12:13] how that relieves in a communion service
[1:12:16] you see where the strength is you see
[1:12:19] where the obedience is Happy are ye if
[1:12:22] you do them now brother an makes this
[1:12:25] statement here in the message ordination
[1:12:28] I think brother Joe had this in one of
[1:12:30] the pamphlets and it just really struck
[1:12:32] me even more a couple of months ago in
[1:12:37] paragraph
[1:12:39] 89 in the message ordination 1962 I
[1:12:43] think I read some other quotes out of
[1:12:44] the same message actually I think that I
[1:12:49] think that is one of the most beautiful
[1:12:52] verses I have given you an examp example
[1:12:56] that you should do as I have done unto
[1:12:58] you we should do to each other in
[1:13:01] commemoration this it's been a practice
[1:13:05] of the Church of this group of people
[1:13:07] Gatherings ever since we began and
[1:13:11] before this Tabernacle was ever built
[1:13:14] when we were yet in a cottage prayer
[1:13:15] meetings we practiced feet washing our
[1:13:19] sisters go to the room in the back our
[1:13:21] Brethren go to the room in the right and
[1:13:24] we observe feet washing strangers if
[1:13:27] you're with us tonight we're only happy
[1:13:30] to have you Fellowship in this
[1:13:32] ordinances of God I might explain as I
[1:13:36] said a few moments ago the thing that
[1:13:38] God left for us to do water baptism one
[1:13:41] article communion and remember that's
[1:13:45] only two God is perfected in three feet
[1:13:49] washing is the third see and remember
[1:13:52] that years later even in the Bible
[1:13:55] some people try to say it's not
[1:13:57] necessary certainly I don't mean to say
[1:14:00] that people's feet need washing that
[1:14:03] isn't it maybe theirs didn't did not
[1:14:07] either but it was an act of
[1:14:10] humility it's an act of doing just as
[1:14:15] essential as water
[1:14:18] baptism because he said here that I have
[1:14:20] given you an example that you should do
[1:14:22] to each other as I have done to you and
[1:14:26] we find out that a widow could not be
[1:14:28] brought in among the people unless she
[1:14:30] had large strangers and had washed the
[1:14:34] feet of the Saints showing
[1:14:37] ourselves
[1:14:39] humble that if anything that we want to
[1:14:41] be is humble because that's the secret
[1:14:44] to power is through
[1:14:47] humility and you're always happy when
[1:14:51] you come out of these things of doing
[1:14:53] them it's a blessed order of Fellowship
[1:14:57] that we observe here at the
[1:15:00] church so you see the power in the
[1:15:04] humility the power and the strength of
[1:15:06] taking the bread and the cup and the
[1:15:09] wine you see the strength the
[1:15:12] happiness the the oppression the the the
[1:15:17] feebleness said let there not be one
[1:15:19] feeble one Among Us these are one of the
[1:15:23] orders that are Bible Church a true
[1:15:26] believing Church a true believing
[1:15:30] Believers as brother Brandon said as
[1:15:33] essential as water baptism he equates
[1:15:36] foot washing to water baptism did we all
[1:15:40] just read that read it one more
[1:15:46] time that isn't it maybe theirs didn't
[1:15:49] either paragraph 91 some people try to
[1:15:51] say it's not necessary certainly I don't
[1:15:53] mean to say that people's feet need
[1:15:56] washing that isn't it maybe theirs did
[1:15:59] not either but it was an act of
[1:16:02] humility it's it's an act of
[1:16:06] doing just as essential as water
[1:16:09] baptism because he said here that I've
[1:16:12] given you an example that you should do
[1:16:14] to each other as I have done to you how
[1:16:19] can you be proud after you got through
[1:16:22] washing somebody's
[1:16:23] feet I mean the big
[1:16:26] wig washing somebody's feet it's an act
[1:16:31] of humility it's not about their feet
[1:16:32] are clean or not it was the act of
[1:16:35] humility and what comes with
[1:16:37] humility
[1:16:38] power
[1:16:40] exactly when you can humble yourself to
[1:16:43] the word and do what the word says to do
[1:16:46] that's where power lies not how loud you
[1:16:49] shout how good you can preach run up the
[1:16:52] floor dress the best this and that
[1:16:55] remember the quotes remember the
[1:16:56] scriptures I'll argue anybody but can't
[1:16:59] take
[1:17:01] communion can't wash the Saint's feet as
[1:17:04] essential as water
[1:17:07] baptism and so with those important
[1:17:10] details being being brought out when we
[1:17:13] come to the table of the Lord our faith
[1:17:16] now is
[1:17:18] increased and I had the Lord touch me as
[1:17:21] I shared with the church that time when
[1:17:23] we went on that that sub Sunset trip
[1:17:26] that hike and I came back and we took
[1:17:29] the communion that night and all the
[1:17:31] pains just left my body and I was
[1:17:34] thinking about that Lord I need strength
[1:17:36] and I was a partaking of it because I
[1:17:38] went through these quotes and I was
[1:17:40] claiming that Lord I'm coming to another
[1:17:43] communion service I need strength
[1:17:45] physical strength I
[1:17:48] need spiritual
[1:17:50] strength a need is heavy on me it's
[1:17:53] weary it's hard you know every time you
[1:17:57] get a phone call you don't know brother
[1:18:00] isra can I talk to you about something

[1:18:44] taking these
[1:18:46] elements as long as the Lord gives me
[1:18:48] strength to do it and there's a journey
[1:18:51] in Grace in there amen so God bless you
