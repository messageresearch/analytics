[1:09] Christ we ask it
[1:13] amen Revelation 6 verse 9 and when he
[1:18] had opened the fifth seal I saw under
[1:21] the altar The Souls of them that were
[1:23] slain for the word of God and for the
[1:25] testimony which they held and they cried
[1:28] with a loud voice saying how long oh
[1:30] Lord holy and true thus thou not judge
[1:33] and avenge our blood on them that dwell
[1:36] on the earth and white robes were given
[1:39] unto every one of them and it was said
[1:41] unto them that they should rest yet for
[1:43] a little season until their fellow
[1:45] servants also and their Brethren that
[1:48] should be killed as they were should be
[1:52] fulfilled sing only

[2:15] [Applause]
[2:17] believe
[2:19] only
[2:20] [Music]
[2:22] be
[2:24] only
[2:27] B all things things are
[2:33] possible
[2:35] only
[2:38] believe you may be seated brother
[2:42] Rena these two prophets are Moses Elijah
[2:45] according to their Works being
[2:46] repatterned again
[2:49] that that has always been their Ministry
[2:53] now notice just as they did that didn't
[2:56] change them remember NE these guys never
[3:00] die watch just that now don't confuse
[3:04] before we get away from this don't
[3:05] confuse
[3:07] Elijah fifth time ministry with his
[3:10] fourth time
[3:13] ministry I've been telling you the
[3:15] Gentile church is looking for
[3:17] Elijah right and here he is over with
[3:19] the Jew remember he can't come four
[3:22] that's that's en his number he has to be
[3:23] five the first time he come is Elijah
[3:27] himself next time he come he was elishah
[3:30] next time he come he was what John the
[3:32] Baptist the next time he comes is for
[3:33] the seventh angel and the fifth time he
[3:36] comes he's with Moses
[3:39] over yes sir don't confuse
[3:42] me five if you know your your numerals
[3:46] of the Bible five is a number of
[3:49] laboring Grace and that's what he's done
[3:52] now watch you look know word this was
[3:54] Jesus a labor of Grace j s u s
[4:01] l a b o r is that right labor for for
[4:05] love for you and if you get to him how
[4:07] you come by what f a i t h amen n l a b
[4:13] o r is that right labor is the number
[4:16] Grace all right to the Believers notice
[4:20] the first Elijah that was him the second
[4:24] Was Elijah the Third was John the Fourth
[4:29] was the seventh angels are the last
[4:32] Messenger to the church according to
[4:34] Malachi 4 and Revelations
[4:38] 10:7
[4:39] now the fifth time he is a messenger to
[4:44] the Jews to the
[4:47] 144,000 to the Jews at the church is
[4:50] [Music]
[4:52] gone I just you a little funny see see
[4:55] look if some thinks I want you to get
[4:58] this now if some still thinks that
[5:02] Malachi
[5:03] 4 to restore the people is the same
[5:07] thing he's going to do down there to the
[5:09] Jews and think it's all the same let me
[5:11] straighten that out for you just a
[5:13] minute see it would be a little bit
[5:14] confusing because remember in Malachi 4
[5:17] says return the faith of the fathers or
[5:20] the children back to the father see back
[5:23] to the father now let me show you the
[5:24] difference of the ministry if he comes
[5:27] to return the faith of the children back
[5:29] to the fathers he would deny Christ he
[5:33] go back to the
[5:37] law that right the fathers kept the
[5:42] law you get
[5:45] it notice when
[5:48] Elijah and when he come to fulfill his
[5:52] ministry in Malachi 4
[5:55] see as Malachi 4 Elijah was by by
[6:01] himself but when he come to minister to
[6:04] the Jews of Revelations 11 he has Moses
[6:06] with him
[6:09] right so no
[6:11] confusion out of
[6:14] it get
[6:16] it when Elijah comes of Malachi 4 he's
[6:20] by himself Elijah will R not Elijah and
[6:24] Moses Elijah will arise but the same
[6:27] inspiration that said Elijah will come
[6:30] for the last part of the church age to
[6:33] restore the faith of the children back
[6:36] to the original faith of the fathers the
[6:38] apostolic faith which your suppor to go
[6:39] back and the Antichrist has got them all
[6:41] pulled out to restore back as all the
[6:44] rest of the scriptures is Blended
[6:45] together see he comes by
[6:49] himself see but when he comes to the
[6:52] church the Bible come to 144,000 the
[6:55] Bible plainly states that both he these
[6:58] two of them
[7:00] two and his first Ministry couldn't take
[7:02] the Jews and put them back to the law
[7:04] becom he because he comes preaching
[7:06] Christ to the
[7:10] 14 that Messiah that was cut
[7:13] off that's
[7:15] it so don't have it confused it's not
[7:18] confused the scripture don't
[7:20] lie
[7:23] Glory I said Thank You Lord I was
[7:25] watching it take place out there see
[7:27] that Elijah walk out there for that
[7:29] first day by himself and is by himself
[7:31] and when I see him come again way on
[7:33] over somewhere else there there two of
[7:34] them
[7:36] there that I see
[7:39] [Applause]
[7:43] now hallu mention a little confusing to
[7:46] somebody but he he told me to mention it
[7:48] so I did
[7:50] noce these men are kept Alive by God
[7:54] from their original Ministry for a
[7:56] future service they serve it so well see
[7:59] just think that Spirit of Elijah
[8:01] ministers five
[8:03] times hallu Moses two why keep alive for
[8:08] for further
[8:10] service they were neither one of them
[8:12] dead now don't you believe that they
[8:15] were both seen alive talking to Jesus on
[8:20] Mount
[8:25] Transfiguration but remember they must
[8:28] die now now Moses actually died but he
[8:31] rose because he's a perfect type of
[8:33] Christ see nobody ever know where he was
[8:37] buried the Angels come
[8:39] Telly he had Angel Paul
[8:43] Bears why no martal man could pack him
[8:46] where he was
[8:49] going he just went through an act that's
[8:54] allu
[8:55] Angel they took him where he was
[8:57] supposed to be no one knows even the
[9:01] Satan didn't even know dispute it with
[9:02] the
[9:03] Archangel he couldn't understand what
[9:05] happened to
[9:08] Moses I see him triming over there
[9:11] looking out over the land and looking
[9:13] back to the children and so forth I see
[9:15] him triming but he stepped up on the
[9:17] Rock and that was the last time I saw
[9:19] him that's a rock that's a rock let me
[9:23] stand on that rock to the end of my road
[9:25] yes
[9:26] sir my colored brother used to go up
[9:29] here and say a little song If I Could I
[9:30] surely would stand on that rock where
[9:32] Moses stood yes sir oh that's a rock I
[9:36] want to stand on
[9:37] too by faith I
[9:40] stand but remember Elijah he just got
[9:44] tired yeah well he had a lot of work
[9:47] ahead of
[9:48] [Music]
[9:50] him so he's pretty well wore out and God
[9:53] just send him a ride on right send a
[9:56] chariot is that right TCH him up never
[9:59] die
[10:00] because he kept him
[10:02] alive he had future work for him let him
[10:05] anoy a man to see come forth in his
[10:08] Spirit but they must taste death now
[10:12] Revelations 11th chap that's what I'm
[10:15] right here any let's hit it Revelations
[10:16] then watch and see if they're not both
[10:18] killed yes sir they both have taste
[10:20] death yes sir after their Ministries
[10:23] finish they taste that Revelations 11
[10:26] and let's start at seven and where there
[10:29] have finished their testimony the Beast
[10:33] that ascended out of the Bottomless Pits
[10:35] makes war against them Oh my he can't
[10:38] stand them holy rollers are back again
[10:40] [Applause]
[10:42] see all right out of the bottomless pit
[10:45] makes war against them and shall
[10:48] overcome them and kill them that's right
[10:51] but Watch What Happens they're perfectly
[10:52] tied now and their dead bodies shall lie
[10:55] in the street in the street of that
[10:58] great City spiritually they called Sodom
[11:00] and Egypt where also our Lord was
[11:03] crucified
[11:05] Jerusalem see now they have to taste
[11:08] death don't they that's right after
[11:10] minister is finished why the seven
[11:14] angels Ministry the seventh Angel's
[11:18] Ministry Elijah's Ministry to the seven
[11:21] Angel
[11:24] not why don't why could not rather I'm
[11:27] trying to say the seventh Angel's
[11:30] Ministry than be by Moses if he's
[11:34] Immortal as same as it could be by
[11:37] Elijah why don't why God just send said
[11:39] Elijah you you don't work so hard
[11:42] everything all these different places I
[11:43] believe just send Moses down why look at
[11:46] Moses Ministry Elijah was a prophet to
[11:49] All
[11:50] Nations but Moses was a lawgiver to the
[11:53] Jews only amen Moses there say reason he
[11:56] come with Elijah them Jews saying wait
[11:58] we still keep keep the law here but here
[12:01] stands Moses
[12:03] himself here's Elijah standing with
[12:06] him think he comes to the Jews only see
[12:11] Moses only got to the Jews the Prophet
[12:13] Elijah was to All Nations but Moses
[12:15] become a prophet to the Jews and a
[12:18] lawgiver see that was his message the
[12:22] law but what was Elijah's message the
[12:25] Bob haired
[12:27] women denomination
[12:31] yes sir he really tore him to pieces
[12:34] painted up
[12:35] faces told go be fed to the
[12:38] dogs he just really tore into them and
[12:41] then when the spirit come up on Johnny
[12:43] ston got down of the Wilderness and done
[12:44] the same thing right so don't you think
[12:48] that we belong to this or that God's
[12:50] able to these stores righted
[12:53] Abraham walked up the road he said and
[12:55] you mean to tell me that you married
[12:58] your own brother-in-law it's not lawful
[13:01] for you to do it
[13:04] brother he told her sure notice these

[13:54] ago the Gentile
[13:56] bride they're there now they're always
[13:59] in white robes to God I'd woke up I've
[14:03] been on a meeting it's been about a year

[14:44] older my daddy live I thought I got to
[14:47] move away pretty soon I thought here I
[14:50] ain't done nothing for God yet I I
[14:53] always wanted to do something for him I
[14:55] thought I got to hurry and do it if I'm
[14:56] going to do it and I don't know how I'm
[14:58] going to do it that's all oh man I hope
[15:01] I live to see him coming I don't want to
[15:03] be a spook a spirit I was always afraid
[15:06] of a spirit and I you know that kind of
[15:08] I always thought like if I meet brother
[15:09] Neville and he'd be a little white cloud
[15:11] moving around you I'd say hello brother
[15:13] Neville and he'd say hello brother
[15:15] Brandon but some other sense he couldn't
[15:16] talk but I just know that brother
[15:19] Neville I want to shake his hand like I
[15:21] always do because that's all I know is
[15:22] human being see I want to shake his hand
[15:25] but he ain't got no hand down there in
[15:26] the grave rotted away oh mind I hope I
[15:30] don't have to go through that I was I'm
[15:32] going to tell you the truth I I was
[15:33] afraid to die not afraid I'd be lost but
[15:35] I didn't want to be a spirit I want to
[15:38] remain a man I want to wait for the
[15:39] Rapture see I just want to stay like
[15:41] that I don't want to be no Spirit Lord I
[15:43] I was think of that and all at once
[15:46] there was something happened now you
[15:48] know and all of you're acquainted of the
[15:50] visions and if this was a vision I never
[15:53] had one like it and I've had them since
[15:55] as a little bitty boy and all at once
[15:58] something happened and I felt myself
[16:02] leaving uhoh and I I thought I've
[16:06] already di see I'm I'm going on see and
[16:10] I got to a place I thought I believe I
[16:12] look back it's just as real friends as
[16:14] I'm standing right
[16:15] here and I turned around to look back
[16:18] and there I was laying on the bed and I
[16:20] stretched down laying by the side of my
[16:22] wife I thought well it's probably a
[16:25] heart attack see I thought well see just
[16:28] Di instantly which should be a fine way
[16:31] of going so I thought that's a heart
[16:33] attack I didn't have to suffer I I
[16:35] thought well now that's strange there I
[16:38] lay right there and here I stand here so
[16:40] I turned it looked like a great big U
[16:43] like a great big uh feel like or
[16:46] something just great spreading field of
[16:48] blue grass and I said well I wonder what
[16:52] this is and all of a sudden as I look
[16:56] here come thousands times
[16:59] thousands of young women all in white
[17:02] robes hair hanging down to their waist
[17:05] barefooted and they were running right
[17:07] toward you I thought now what's this I
[17:11] turned around looked back there and
[17:12] there I was and looked up this way there
[17:13] they come I bit my
[17:15] finger I'm not asleep exactly but I can
[17:19] feel and I said well something here
[17:22] funny and these women all come running
[17:24] and I never seen such pretty women and
[17:27] they all around to me and when they run
[17:29] to me you know how I've been kind of
[17:31] they call me a woman hater but I'm not
[17:33] see but I just think a good woman is a
[17:36] one of the is a jewel but I think one
[17:38] that is no good is the pon says water in
[17:40] your blood so I certainly a got no use
[17:43] for for ill feigned women or smart at Le
[17:46] and so these women all come and started
[17:48] throwing their arm around now that's
[17:50] unusual know I wouldn't stand for that
[17:53] so and they were now I'm going to have
[17:55] to say this in a way that I'm a mixed
[17:56] craft but they were they were win
[17:59] they were women and they they hugg me
[18:02] each one and saw our precious breth and
[18:05] one would hug me and then the other one
[18:06] hug me I stand there looking I thought
[18:09] well what's this see I stand there and I
[18:12] thought what's happened I look back down
[18:13] there it wasn't night down there and
[18:15] here I was standing here I thought now
[18:17] that's all I don't understand that women
[18:19] holler oh our precious brother and
[18:22] hugging me now they was ever bit in
[18:24] feeling women now forgive me sisters as
[18:28] I said say this because but you listen
[18:31] to your doctor and if we ain't got clean
[18:33] Minds then we're not Christians I don't
[18:36] care I've always live clean God knows
[18:38] that a little boy the angel Lord told me
[18:40] to not defile my body smoke or drink and
[18:43] that's been Truth by the grace of God
[18:44] I've kept that when I was a sinner I
[18:46] just run around with women and so but
[18:49] any man that lets a woman hug up into
[18:53] his arms him being made up of cells of
[18:56] male and her of females there's a
[18:57] sensation I don't care who you are and I
[18:59] don't tell me you're not if you're a
[19:01] healthy person but not there because you
[19:04] don't have any more different cells
[19:06] you'll never sin there there was a
[19:09] change is no more than just a brotherly
[19:11] love to them women although in the grace
[19:14] that they look that I think a a woman a
[19:17] nice woman that holds herself right and
[19:19] Walks Like a Lady she's a she's an
[19:21] example of a jewel on earth like
[19:24] anything it's graceful I think a a woman
[19:26] that holds her place and tries to be a
[19:29] lady is a is a statue of Honor I do
[19:32] believe that and I think what it is it's
[19:34] just like the Christ and the Antichrist
[19:37] same thing I I like anything is smashed
[19:39] like a pretty horse and he just stands
[19:42] in his statue of a real pretty horse or
[19:44] anything like that a pretty Mountain
[19:47] pretty women pretty man anything that
[19:50] stands in the making of God I always
[19:52] admire it and these were perfect but no
[19:55] matter how much they would hug me up
[19:57] into their arms
[19:59] and they were women you understand but
[20:02] there could never be no sin the male
[20:05] glands and the female glands both was
[20:08] gone thank the Lord they were my sisters
[20:14] completely I looked and I began I looked
[20:17] at my hands I seen is all so young and I
[20:20] looked I was young
[20:23] too and uh and losing my hair as a Young
[20:27] Man uh putting carbolic acid on a barber
[20:29] didn't talk it all out when I was just a
[20:31] boy and it's been always a kind of a a
[20:34] thing to me that I I I get a cold so
[20:36] quick because my scalp's still soft you
[20:39] know and the roots of the hair is still
[20:40] there but it was burnt with carbonic
[20:42] acid and the hair can never grow see and
[20:45] I went my wife when I long years ago and
[20:47] got me a hair piece to wear a little
[20:48] piece of hair put on cover my head up
[20:50] but I was always shamed to wear it
[20:52] because it looked like it was something
[20:53] false I didn't want nothing false am and
[20:55] so I thought I'll just put me on a
[20:57] stocking cap then
[20:59] I did for a while you know what they did
[21:00] they want to call me Bishop and said I
[21:02] want to do I just said let her go so I

[1:01:15] against
[1:01:17] somebody he's been through more than we
[1:01:20] have he took our place and he died for
[1:01:24] us and and he saids you know nobody's
[1:01:27] done anything that bad to you but he
[1:01:31] looks at us as child you're forgiven and

[1:35:12] thinking of Jesus having to go through
[1:35:16] these steps or stages of adoption and he
[1:35:19] was about his father's business and
[1:35:22] that's what we want to be today about
[1:35:25] our father's business and he takes the
[1:35:29] scripture in Ephesians chapter 1 and he
[1:35:32] places what that means in uh to be
[1:35:37] seated in Heavenly places now in
[1:35:40] adoption part one the prophet of God
[1:35:42] says this it's in paragraph number 100

[1:35:56] paragraph number
[1:35:58] 90
[1:36:03] um 92 so he reads the scripture in

[1:39:47] forgiveness there in Heavenly places in
[1:39:51] Christ Jesus sitting
[1:39:55] there in Heavenly
[1:39:59] places amen
[1:40:01] so we've been talking about the powers
[1:40:04] of God and how we receive more
[1:40:08] power and more
[1:40:10] blessings and how these
[1:40:13] Powers they are actually unlimited to
[1:40:16] the
[1:40:17] believer they're
[1:40:19] unlimited now we've been in places where
[1:40:22] we're constantly looking looking on how
[1:40:24] long we going to be
[1:40:25] here or I'm ready to leave and our
[1:40:28] thoughts are going but a Heavenly place
[1:40:31] you don't want to leave that when the
[1:40:34] anointing comes down somebody tell me
[1:40:37] who wants to leave from
[1:40:39] that this is the goal of our service
[1:40:43] this is the goal of our praise and our
[1:40:45] worship this is a purpose of Our Lives I
[1:40:49] actually live for the Holy Ghost to come
[1:40:54] upon me I live for those moments I need
[1:40:59] them in my life I need him in my
[1:41:02] Ministry I need him as a father I need
[1:41:06] him to be a witness I need the Holy
[1:41:10] Ghost to come upon me and anoint my
[1:41:15] spirit with the right kind of thoughts
[1:41:18] the right kind of an
[1:41:20] attitude the right kind it's the
[1:41:22] blessing of the
[1:41:23] Lord its Heavenly
[1:41:27] places in Christ
[1:41:29] Jesus and so the prophet of God goes a
[1:41:32] little bit further in this
[1:41:34] message in paragraph 100
[1:41:37] 100 he goes further paragraph 96 blessed
[1:41:42] us together in all Heavenly blessings in
[1:41:45] Heavenly places Watch according as he
[1:41:48] has chosen Us in him did we choose him
[1:41:53] or he chose
[1:41:55] us he us
[1:41:59] when the night we accepted
[1:42:03] him chosen according he has chosen Us in
[1:42:06] him before the foundation of the
[1:42:09] world Amen he chose
[1:42:12] us when did he choose you that's got the
[1:42:15] Holy Ghost when did he choose you before
[1:42:18] the foundation of the world the
[1:42:21] foundation of the world so brother ad
[1:42:23] goes in paragraph 100 and it says this
[1:42:26] here in Genesis 2 he made a man he said
[1:42:31] I am y a h u ju u v u h JV hu Jehovah
[1:42:39] what did it mean I am the all existent
[1:42:43] one who has created something off of
[1:42:46] myself to be a son of mine or a
[1:42:50] temporary or amateur a little one of
[1:42:53] mine Glory why he gave men Jehovah means
[1:42:58] that he gave men to be an amateur God
[1:43:02] because he is
[1:43:04] Father um he's father God and he made a
[1:43:07] man an amateur God so he isn't
[1:43:10] self-existent anymore he exists with his
[1:43:14] family l l Elohim now he is Jehovah
[1:43:21] Jehovah means the one who exists with
[1:43:24] his family now God made man to be the
[1:43:27] predominant over the all the Earth he
[1:43:30] had dominion and his domain he was God
[1:43:33] over the Earth he could speak it would
[1:43:35] be so he could speak this it would be so
[1:43:39] there he is god Jehovah the one who
[1:43:41] existed in
[1:43:43] self-existence but now exist with his
[1:43:48] family and his little ones with him
[1:43:52] there you are so we know that he's not
[1:43:55] self-existent anymore he was by himself
[1:43:59] in Elohim but in him we he had thoughts
[1:44:03] he had attributes and these attributes
[1:44:06] were in him and now he had to express
[1:44:09] that out and in the expression he
[1:44:11] becomes Jehovah I had a wedding to do
[1:44:15] here on Friday up in Camp verie my wife
[1:44:18] and I went there Thursday and Friday we
[1:44:21] had a little bit running and traveling
[1:44:22] to do to marry the the young lady sister
[1:44:25] Grace and Phillip Dalton got married and
[1:44:29] I was talking with them before the
[1:44:31] marriage and as I've done many times and
[1:44:35] talking to this young man this young
[1:44:37] lady they're beautiful couple and I I
[1:44:38] told them this that you know as a young
[1:44:42] man your mother and father they know
[1:44:44] your friends brother cousins they all
[1:44:47] know you as Phillip same thing with you
[1:44:50] Grace they know you as an individual
[1:44:52] none none of us know you as husband and
[1:44:56] wife that attribute comes out through
[1:44:59] this
[1:45:00] Ceremony this ceremony pulls another
[1:45:04] attribute out that your parents don't
[1:45:06] even know you like that because it takes
[1:45:09] this marriage in order for you to be a
[1:45:11] husband a lot of men but many of them
[1:45:14] are not married so they can't be a
[1:45:16] husband and this is the same example
[1:45:19] with God and the same thing with when
[1:45:21] you have a child you can read books on
[1:45:23] rearing children or being a mother and
[1:45:25] you can read books on how to treat a
[1:45:28] child and so forth but you don't really
[1:45:30] know what it is to be a mother until you
[1:45:33] have your own even if you adopt one
[1:45:37] that's you know you H that's having your
[1:45:39] own and you take that son as yours or
[1:45:41] that child as yours it's the same
[1:45:43] feeling as as you having one so and
[1:45:47] those attributes are expressed after
[1:45:50] this great happening when he had you in
[1:45:54] his mind and he brings forth children
[1:45:57] now he goes from Elohim the
[1:45:59] self-existent one to Jehovah which is
[1:46:03] now a father this is this is somebody
[1:46:06] that exists with his family he's
[1:46:10] Jehovah so he goes from Elohim to
[1:46:13] Jehovah and that makes him our father
[1:46:17] let's take a scripture in first in St
[1:46:19] John chap 1 and verse number 12
[1:46:32] quickly he verse 11 he came unto his own
[1:46:36] and his own received him not but as many
[1:46:40] as received him to them gave he
[1:46:46] what power to become the sons of God
[1:46:50] even to them that believe on his name so
[1:46:54] he gives you the power to become a son
[1:47:00] or daughter of God and that's the
[1:47:03] fatherhood that's our heavenly father
[1:47:07] expressing and birthing you into the
[1:47:11] kingdom and now you have the power from
[1:47:13] the father remember acts 1 and8 you
[1:47:16] shall receive power after what after
[1:47:20] that the Holy Ghost not after you get
[1:47:23] your degree not after you stay in so
[1:47:25] many months but after the Holy Ghost has
[1:47:28] come upon you you shall receive power
[1:47:31] how many of our churches need that how
[1:47:34] many of our Ministries need that they
[1:47:38] need the power of God and when the Holy
[1:47:41] Ghost comes upon you you shall receive
[1:47:45] this power and he gives you the power to
[1:47:48] be Sons and Daughters of God I love how
[1:47:51] brother brandham deals with this these
[1:47:54] attributes and the dimensions that we
[1:47:57] work and live in he opens it up to us
[1:48:00] doesn't he First Dimension second third
[1:48:04] and
[1:48:04] fourth in 2017 or
[1:48:08] 2016 I was going through the message I
[1:48:11] know brother Ben likes these things he
[1:48:13] was sharing a message tell me something
[1:48:15] on I didn't get to look at that rather
[1:48:17] being on these Dimensions but I started
[1:48:19] to look at my iPad I I went through back
[1:48:22] in 17 and I got up to
[1:48:24] 1957 on these dimensions and this are
[1:48:27] some powerful things that brother banam
[1:48:31] says that I want to read to you
[1:48:34] today about these dimensions and how
[1:48:38] healing works and how our thoughts we
[1:48:41] come in here and many times we think of
[1:48:45] you know the apostles pastors teachers
[1:48:47] and evangelists being placed into the
[1:48:50] body of Christ Ephesians 1 five-fold
[1:48:53] Ministry and we talk about the adoption
[1:48:56] finding our place right our placing to
[1:48:59] be a preacher our placing to be a farmer
[1:49:02] he says our placing as a housewife these
[1:49:06] are places that God places us but then
[1:49:10] let's go a little bit further into that
[1:49:12] let's go a little bit deeper than just
[1:49:14] your natural placing because he can
[1:49:17] place me as a minister or a pastor but
[1:49:19] yet I'm still immature in my ways and I
[1:49:23] don't have the maturity and I'm not
[1:49:25] growing properly I know my position but
[1:49:28] I'm yet not fruitful like I should be
[1:49:32] and this is the part it's not just now
[1:49:34] we found our place as Christians brother
[1:49:37] bonsa we find our place as Believers in
[1:49:40] the word now take that a little bit
[1:49:43] deeper that your inner man down in your
[1:49:46] soul can be placed properly where your
[1:49:50] thoughts are right your mind said is
[1:49:53] correct the way you approach and handle
[1:49:55] the message and handle the Bible is
[1:49:58] directly in order so it's not just
[1:50:00] becoming a Christian that's not saying
[1:50:03] that lightly it's great to become a
[1:50:04] Christian but we're not just sitting on
[1:50:06] a Pew we have work to do and God is
[1:50:10] working with us and in us and so let's
[1:50:13] just touch on a few of these things and
[1:50:14] it'll open up our our understanding a
[1:50:16] little bit brother bam in the message at
[1:50:18] Thy
[1:50:20] word he says this here now honestly my
[1:50:23] dear brother or
[1:50:25] sister if you would just let I I if
[1:50:29] you if you would just enter into that
[1:50:31] other dimension now enter that realm
[1:50:35] just don't think about what how sick you
[1:50:37] are if you'll just move on up in here to
[1:50:41] God where you can touch him something's
[1:50:44] going to happen in a few
[1:50:46] minutes if you just get up there see and
[1:50:50] believe now have faith
[1:50:53] believe with all your hearts God is here
[1:50:56] to bring it to pass there's somebody
[1:50:59] right in in there keeps pulling on
[1:51:02] something right in that way I can't
[1:51:04] place where it's at but my attention
[1:51:07] just keeps pulling up into that that
[1:51:10] spear right up in there it's somebody
[1:51:15] praying there's so much between me I
[1:51:18] cannot I can't locate who you are have
[1:51:21] faith so here brother Bam's obviously in
[1:51:23] a meeting the Evangelistic meeting he's
[1:51:27] operating his gifts that the Lord is
[1:51:29] using him and while operating we've seen
[1:51:31] it done many times that someone else is
[1:51:34] now pulling on the gift they're not
[1:51:36] pulling on it outwardly saying Hey
[1:51:38] Brother BR I'm over here no but they're
[1:51:40] praying and as they're praying they're
[1:51:43] pulling on that gift and it's in another
[1:51:46] dimension he can hear it he can see it
[1:51:50] but church folks are chewing gum some
[1:51:52] are reading their Bible some waiting for
[1:51:54] their prayer card they just can't hear
[1:51:55] what's going on but it's still going on
[1:51:58] all the time let's go a little bit
[1:52:00] further in the message God testifying of
[1:52:02] his gifts paragraph number
[1:52:05] 30 he says my work is in the realm of
[1:52:09] spirits that's where I live a big part
[1:52:12] of my life is in another dimension that
[1:52:16] the world knows nothing about and I
[1:52:19] speak that in the name of the Lord they
[1:52:22] don't understand understand there's no
[1:52:24] need of trying to explain it no way to
[1:52:26] explain it brother manam continues on in
[1:52:30] the message testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:52:33] paragraphs 78 he says this here that's
[1:52:36] in another dimension that many people
[1:52:38] know little love but God lives in that
[1:52:41] place and only thing you have to do is
[1:52:44] not think about your senses how you feel
[1:52:48] just believe what he said for the
[1:52:50] scriptures can't be cannot be broken
[1:52:53] whatever things you desire When you pray
[1:52:56] believe you receive it present tense it
[1:52:59] will be given to you future tense mark
[1:53:04] 11:24 so you believe
[1:53:07] presently it will come to you later on
[1:53:10] it's on the road God's word Can't Fail
[1:53:14] he's got to keep his word you believe
[1:53:17] him right now you accept it right now
[1:53:21] it's on the road coming
[1:53:23] so here brother bam is now opening us up
[1:53:26] to a great understanding of what these
[1:53:28] dimensions are we didn't know these
[1:53:31] things before but he opens us up to it
[1:53:34] in Daniel chapter 3: 24 and5 he says
[1:53:38] this here in your Bible it says then
[1:53:42] Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonished
[1:53:44] and Rose up in haste and spake and said
[1:53:46] unto his counselors did not we cast
[1:53:49] three men Bound in the midst of the fire
[1:53:52] the answer and said to
[1:53:56] the who's in the fire with
[1:54:00] you you see the enemy they they just see
[1:54:04] you they think they don't like you but
[1:54:07] there's more with you that can ever be
[1:54:10] against you God is on your side he said
[1:54:14] I'll never leave you or forsake you he's
[1:54:18] with you even right now you might not
[1:54:21] see him you might not fill him but he's
[1:54:23] still with
[1:54:25] you he just he'll show up every now and
[1:54:29] then and he shows up in the
[1:54:32] fire and he answered and says lo I see
[1:54:35] four men loose walking in the midst of
[1:54:37] the fire they have no hurt and the form
[1:54:41] of the fourth is like the Son of God so
[1:54:43] brother random in the message what think
[1:54:45] you of Christ he says this in paragraph
[1:54:47] number 36 he says it's all settled
[1:54:54] amen let's move on up what think you of
[1:54:58] Christ then he got right up to the edge
[1:55:00] where they was to jump off into the
[1:55:02] fiery furnace and there it was about The
[1:55:05] Darkest Hour they ever seen coming up to
[1:55:08] this fiery furnace and just about time
[1:55:11] they got ready to step in let's turn our
[1:55:14] cameras this morning and look on up
[1:55:16] yonder in
[1:55:18] heaven break out of this
[1:55:21] dimension and look up yonder when things
[1:55:24] look so dreary here there's always

[1:57:00] them there's one good thing is those
[1:57:03] real good oldfashioned
[1:57:06] songs it just takes you out somewhere in

[1:57:32] moves you up into another
[1:57:34] dimension it's the blessing of God it's

[1:57:42] more and more and more
[1:57:46] amen I'll take a couple more on this he
[1:57:48] says I believe Lincoln said one time you
[1:57:52] can you can fool part of the people part
[1:57:55] of the time but not all the people all
[1:57:57] the time and that's right and if you got
[1:58:00] love in your heart for the people
[1:58:02] they'll know it you might act
[1:58:05] indifferent or anything but still
[1:58:07] they'll know it they can feel it it's in
[1:58:11] another
[1:58:12] dimension as we call it that injects to
[1:58:16] these people a love that they know it
[1:58:19] and they'll believe it and that's when
[1:58:21] you can help the person when you believe
[1:58:23] it amen brother bam continues in the
[1:58:26] message at Thy word and he says this
[1:58:29] here so you just be reverent now if the
[1:58:32] anointing would strike me of course it
[1:58:34] puts me in another dimension to the
[1:58:36] scientists it's the other dimension to
[1:58:39] you Christians it's in the spirit and
[1:58:44] therefore you're not yourself how many
[1:58:47] want to get in the spirit what kind of
[1:58:49] spirit the Holy Spirit
[1:58:52] get out of your own spirit and what
[1:58:55] happened yesterday and all the things
[1:58:58] that's going to happen tomorrow and get
[1:59:00] into the spirit of his word the spirit
[1:59:04] of the worship the spirit of the Holy
[1:59:07] Holy Ghost coming upon your soul we have
[1:59:10] to get into that brother random
[1:59:12] continues in the message fellowship and
[1:59:13] he says this here we're sitting here in
[1:59:16] Heavenly places now the holy spirit is
[1:59:19] here Christ is here and the body that we
[1:59:23] receive when we go out of here we go
[1:59:25] into another dimension into a blessed
[1:59:29] place with the Lord Jesus and at the
[1:59:32] return of Christ in his physical body
[1:59:34] come back to the Earth he spiritually
[1:59:37] turned back picked up a brand new body
[1:59:40] that's going to live forever
[1:59:42] amen oh my people could get the idea
[1:59:45] right now of angels walking up and down
[1:59:49] those aisles of Christ the son of God
[1:59:52] moving around in the building oh my what
[1:59:55] a difference you're in his presence and
[1:59:58] when your spirit becomes so hard to the
[2:00:01] outside world just like a magnet or
[2:00:04] crystal in the radio when the when that
[2:00:07] Gadget in there becomes so charged and
[2:00:09] magnetized to the word setting out until
[2:00:12] it strikes it and makes a positive the
[2:00:16] radio coming through the air the words
[2:00:18] we can't hear them with our ears we
[2:00:21] they're we can pick it up but that
[2:00:24] crystal in the radio picks it up the
[2:00:26] television the same it becomes positive
[2:00:30] and when our intellectual faith comes
[2:00:31] down into the heart becomes so charged
[2:00:34] with the Unseen World that every word of
[2:00:38] God becomes a positive truth you see
[2:00:42] what I mean when God says it it echoes
[2:00:46] against it just like it does on that
[2:00:48] crystal in the radio makes it perfect
[2:00:51] God said the Lord that heals thee that
[2:00:53] settles it amen that makes it real I'll
[2:00:58] be with thee even in you to the end of
[2:01:00] the world that makes it real you go on
[2:01:04] that's the way it is where I'm T talking
[2:01:08] Divine
[2:01:09] Healing how many remember brother R
[2:01:12] talking about those Spirits calling out
[2:01:14] to one another any the other dimension
[2:01:17] Spirit of arthritis was calling out to
[2:01:20] another spirit and the people in the
[2:01:22] church can't hear it but a prophet made
[2:01:25] a receiver can contact that is that
[2:01:29] right um now let me ask you this you
[2:01:32] know I can turn the radio on here and it
[2:01:35] would pick up all the radio local radio
[2:01:37] stations and even the ones nationally
[2:01:39] that are connected to this radio program
[2:01:41] or the radio
[2:01:43] receiver and I can turn that on here and
[2:01:46] you all can hear what's going on now
[2:01:49] when I turn it off does it mean it stops
[2:01:52] out there no it's still going on but I
[2:01:56] just turned my radio off and some people
[2:01:58] come to church with their radios off
[2:02:01] they go in prayer with the radio off the
[2:02:04] Holy Spirit don't turn off and on it's
[2:02:07] always on and if you can get your mind
[2:02:11] right and get your attitude right and
[2:02:15] get your spirit right you can tap into
[2:02:17] the Holy Spirit and it will show you
[2:02:20] that you are child of God and you got
[2:02:24] the power in your life to live above the
[2:02:27] things of the
[2:02:31] worlden church can start before church

[2:03:01] were talking about him and we were
[2:03:03] sharing in the message where brother
[2:03:04] Adam talked about how
[2:03:08] that uh we went from the horse and buggy
[2:03:11] over to the
[2:03:12] automobile to the airplane and then we
[2:03:16] left the airplane and moved up into the
[2:03:19] astronaut age how many know that and he
[2:03:23] was talking about how science and the
[2:03:25] spirit world the spiritual the spiritual
[2:03:28] believers they kind of go together how
[2:03:31] scientists have learned to you know
[2:03:34] build and create and make us more aware
[2:03:37] of what electricity is and what power is
[2:03:40] and lasers and all kind of atomic Powers
[2:03:43] but that's going on in the spirit all
[2:03:45] the time already has been and God sent a
[2:03:49] Great and Mighty messenger in this day

[2:05:28] talk about demons in spiritual form in
[2:05:32] the soul they're in the soul the same as
[2:05:35] they're in the body and we're bound to
[2:05:38] admit that we see them in people's body
[2:05:41] such as cancers and different diseases
[2:05:44] that's in the human body just recently
[2:05:47] even cancer has been declared to be a
[2:05:49] fourth dimension disease
[2:05:52] that's it's in another dimension sure
[2:05:55] it's
[2:05:56] demonology every disease is a fourth
[2:05:59] dimension disease the beginning of it

[2:06:17] thinking cancerous thoughts these demons
[2:06:21] they they come they show them themselves
[2:06:23] on the medical table in the body but
[2:06:26] what about in the soul how do they
[2:06:27] manifest themselves brother bandam is
[2:06:29] opening this up to us and and and we got
[2:06:33] to I believe we need to receive that
[2:06:35] amen he says now many times many people
[2:06:38] with good thoughts and good people try
[2:06:40] many times to rest upon some little
[2:06:43] theology they have or something they
[2:06:45] have been taught since a child and still
[2:06:48] find that down in their being down in
[2:06:50] their soul that they still have
[2:06:52] something that's not right you many are
[2:06:56] are here this morning no doubt wherever
[2:06:59] you find Christians gathered together
[2:07:02] you find people who has those Spirits in
[2:07:04] them that they it's undesirable they
[2:07:08] don't want them they say oh if I could
[2:07:12] just if I can only quit lying if I can
[2:07:14] only quit lusting if I can only quit
[2:07:17] this or that now that is devils and now
[2:07:21] they come in the form of religion many
[2:07:25] times being Sunday school is time of
[2:07:27] teaching so let's look into
[2:07:30] this drop down to paragraph number 44
[2:07:33] and he says this here someone come the
[2:07:36] other day and said brother brandom do
[2:07:38] you think it's wrong to do a certain
[2:07:41] thing I said why do you questioning
[2:07:44] about see if there's a question in your
[2:07:48] mind do what to it leave it alone don't
[2:07:53] do it at all just stay with that when
[2:07:56] you start to do anything if it's a
[2:07:59] question whether it's right or wrong
[2:08:02] stay away from it don't go into it at
[2:08:05] all then you know you're right now all
[2:08:08] things ought to be considered
[2:08:10] prayerfully first seek you first the
[2:08:13] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[2:08:15] all these other things will be added I
[2:08:18] am positive sure this morning
[2:08:22] catch this church catch this if men and
[2:08:25] women could only get into the
[2:08:29] position of where their soul their
[2:08:32] thinking their attitude will be perfect
[2:08:36] in the sight of God that would be one of
[2:08:39] the most powerful churches that ever
[2:08:43] existed we've been talking about power
[2:08:45] right remember we talked about power we
[2:08:47] built the foundation on the 11th
[2:08:50] commandment which is is love everything
[2:08:53] has to be based on love and then that'll
[2:08:55] bring you into the Holy Ghost which is
[2:08:58] the token is that right the Holy Ghost
[2:09:01] and the token you're entitled to it when
[2:09:04] you believe every word you're entitled
[2:09:07] to the token and so that builds up this
[2:09:09] Foundation of love and surrender and
[2:09:12] God's Great powers that he gives and
[2:09:14] here now not just placing the apostles
[2:09:17] pastors teachers evangelists and gifts
[2:09:21] he's now saying let's bring you in
[2:09:23] position in your soul in your thinking
[2:09:28] come to church that's great but now get
[2:09:31] your thinking right get your mind right
[2:09:35] get your soul right and if that can be
[2:09:37] put in this place I'll show you a
[2:09:41] powerful Church a church that got it
[2:09:45] right their Love Is Right their Doctrine
[2:09:47] is Right their attitude is right
[2:09:55] yes here what he says
[2:09:58] here positive sure this morning if men
[2:10:01] and women could only get into the
[2:10:03] position where their soul their thinking
[2:10:06] their attitude will be perfect in the
[2:10:08] sight of God that would be one of the
[2:10:09] most powerful churches that ever existed
[2:10:14] let me take another quote in the message
[2:10:16] humble thyself here what the prophet of
[2:10:18] God says here
[2:10:21] paragraph number 75 in the message
[2:10:24] humble
[2:10:25] thyself he says this
[2:10:28] here don't you love the
[2:10:31] Lord and God can only operate as we let
[2:10:36] him operate and there's so many
[2:10:38] wonderful things that I'm saying and you
[2:10:41] know people want power and really they
[2:10:44] don't know what power is they really
[2:10:47] know what what goes with it the way up
[2:10:51] is down always if you want Power see how
[2:10:55] humble you can get just get away from
[2:10:58] all your worldly thinking and humble
[2:11:01] yourself before God and then you got
[2:11:03] more power than the man that runs all
[2:11:06] over the building makes a big loud of
[2:11:09] noise see because you've been able to
[2:11:10] conquer yourself and commit yourself to
[2:11:12] Christ see to humble yourself before him
[2:11:16] that's really
[2:11:18] power you show me a church that's humble
[2:11:22] real humble not arrogancy we got plenty
[2:11:27] of that a church just a sweet Humble
[2:11:31] Church I'll show you a church that has
[2:11:34] the favor and power of God in it that's
[2:11:37] right that's the thing it takes humility
[2:11:40] humbling ourselves before God letting
[2:11:43] God just work through us don't have to
[2:11:46] make a lot of noise amen so most of us
[2:11:50] got that part right
[2:11:55] so let's move on to the next part of
[2:11:57] that two slices to that
[2:12:00] bread don't make a lot of noise what's
[2:12:02] the other slice there's two slices to
[2:12:04] the bread no matter how thin you slice
[2:12:06] it don't make a lot of noise but
[2:12:09] everywhere Jesus went come on somebody
[2:12:12] there was a noise somebody saying praise
[2:12:15] the Lord thank you Lord amen praise the
[2:12:20] Lord
[2:12:21] someone said to me in the
[2:12:26] message so let's let's let's go forward
[2:12:29] in this message I'm going to close right
[2:12:30] in this message here this in this humble
[2:12:34] thyself but this isn't enticing Spirits
[2:12:37] here brother bam continues and he says
[2:12:38] this
[2:12:40] here watch a few minutes on the physical
[2:12:43] I I trust this helps you I want you to
[2:12:45] catch this watch a few moments on the
[2:12:47] physical now we have many times after
[2:12:49] years we got we call a lie detector you
[2:12:53] could put it on your wrist and set it
[2:12:54] across their head and you can get in
[2:12:57] there and try your best to make a lie
[2:12:59] sound like the truth and it'll register
[2:13:02] negative every time because the human
[2:13:05] was not made to lie lying is
[2:13:09] deceitful hard thing evil thing I'd
[2:13:14] rather have a drunker with me any day
[2:13:17] than a liar see a liar in your body
[2:13:21] wasn't made to LY no matter how sinful
[2:13:24] you are you're still a fallen Son of God
[2:13:28] the most sinful person in the city today
[2:13:32] God didn't intend you to be sinful he
[2:13:35] wanted you to be a son or daughter of
[2:13:39] his you're made up in his own makeup but
[2:13:42] sin has caused you to do that and no
[2:13:45] matter how much you try to impersonate
[2:13:47] and try to make a lie seem right they
[2:13:49] got a scientific instrument that proves
[2:13:53] that it's wrong you can tell it with all
[2:13:56] innocence you want to but it's still
[2:14:00] register
[2:14:01] negative paragraph 47 it continues on
[2:14:04] therefore if a man or a woman could ever
[2:14:07] get their thoughts and their testimony
[2:14:11] and their lives so lined up with God
[2:14:14] Amen until the channel of the holy
[2:14:17] spirit will be perfectly one with God
[2:14:21] what would take place if the man and
[2:14:23] woman could ever get lined up where with
[2:14:25] freedom from their heart Faith from
[2:14:28] their
[2:14:31] innermost
[2:14:32] Amen brother banam continues on it's a
[2:14:35] really powerful message go and hear the
[2:14:40] rest of it it's powerful and so brother
[2:14:43] banam takes that and shares with us that
[2:14:48] these Powers the power of God his power
[2:14:51] is
[2:14:52] unlimited the power of Grace is
[2:14:55] unlimited
[2:14:56] forgiveness unlimited Love Unlimited
[2:15:00] Mercy
[2:15:02] unlimited doing good that's for you
[2:15:06] unlimited pure
[2:15:08] thinking it's unlimited you can get do
[2:15:11] as much as you want to that pure
[2:15:13] thinking helping your neighbor that's
[2:15:16] unlimited y'all want something to do
[2:15:19] y'all need a Ministry yes helping your
[2:15:22] neighbor witnessing there's a good one
[2:15:25] unlimited reading the word of God
[2:15:30] unlimited how about
[2:15:32] praying
[2:15:34] unlimited now these Powers the powers of
[2:15:38] God are
[2:15:40] unlimited brother bam deals with this
[2:15:43] and he's talking about
[2:15:46] um Einstein so he takes another
[2:15:49] scientist again
[2:15:52] and the message Christ is revealed in
[2:15:54] his own word and he says this here I'm
[2:15:56] going to bypass all of this here see
[2:15:58] that all that you could have said amen
[2:16:00] too but some of y'all closing up on me
[2:16:04] all right you could have said amen your
[2:16:08] body want to go but your soul really
[2:16:10] want me to keep
[2:16:11] reading your spirit needs to hear it
[2:16:15] your spirit is saying preach brother
[2:16:17] come on give us that word give us them
[2:16:20] quotes
[2:16:21] amen who shall I listen to your carnal
[2:16:24] body or your
[2:16:26] spirit oh my praise the Lord praise the
[2:16:32] Lord amen
[2:16:35] yes brother brandom goes deeper in the
[2:16:39] message Christ is revealed in his own
[2:16:41] word and he's talking about Einstein
[2:16:44] when but before he gets into that look
[2:16:46] how he sets this up in paragraph number
[2:16:48] 66 now notice there is not any error in
[2:16:51] the
[2:16:52] scripture Jesus the word of God
[2:16:55] perceived the thought that's in the
[2:16:57] heart the word of God is stronger
[2:17:00] sharper Hebrews 4:12 the word of God is
[2:17:03] sharper more powerful than a two-edged
[2:17:06] sword even a discerner of the thoughts
[2:17:08] intents of the Mind see goes way down
[2:17:11] into the mind and pulls out and
[2:17:15] discerns what is discern make known
[2:17:19] reveal out and that's what the word of
[2:17:22] God
[2:17:23] does today we see the Catholic church is
[2:17:27] the word of God the Baptist the
[2:17:30] Methodist the we say the Catholic church
[2:17:33] is the word of God the Baptist the
[2:17:34] Methodist the Pentecostal the Tabernacle
[2:17:37] that's wrong the word is the
[2:17:41] revelation God revealed by the word and
[2:17:45] we can get any continuity among Medics
[2:17:48] among scientists different ones if
[2:17:51] Einstein had only had the spiritual
[2:17:55] application as he had the physical
[2:17:58] application as he studied the laws of
[2:18:00] light and so forth he could have told us
[2:18:05] something when I heard his message on
[2:18:07] that great Center somewhere in the skies
[2:18:11] that ever contacted with that Center uh
[2:18:15] you could create Earth do anything and
[2:18:18] the power would be Unlimited did see he
[2:18:22] had seen that so here's a natural
[2:18:26] scientist that tapped into these things
[2:18:30] and he said if you could ever get in
[2:18:32] contact with the center you could create
[2:18:36] Earth and do anything and he said the
[2:18:39] power would be unlimited this is
[2:18:41] Einstein this is
[2:18:44] Einstein without the Seven
[2:18:46] Seals this is Einstein without the
[2:18:49] message of the hour word this is
[2:18:52] Einstein without proof that going beyond
[2:18:55] the curtain of time we have bodies over
[2:18:59] there that do not corrupt think about
[2:19:02] that church and him and his great wisdom
[2:19:06] his great science his mind of course he
[2:19:08] believed in God he didn't have the
[2:19:10] Revelation that we have but he got into
[2:19:13] the depth of it and he realize that that
[2:19:16] power is
[2:19:17] unlimited if you can get to it and
[2:19:21] here and brother bam immediately goes
[2:19:24] into the Rapture you see these little
[2:19:27] pockets going through the air they call
[2:19:29] saucers I think sister uh Carina saw a
[2:19:33] light out here the other night she said
[2:19:35] it was there it disappeared and it came

[2:20:37] Celestial body and there'll be High hair

[2:22:16] Ministries God blessed him AA Allen all
[2:22:19] the beautiful wonderful Ministries but
[2:22:21] we have somebody who went further than
[2:22:22] that that
[2:22:25] orbited that went beyond the curtain of
[2:22:28] time and came back and you heard it in
[2:22:32] Sunday school this morning that he saw
[2:22:35] his people there gathered
[2:22:39] there
[2:22:41] Glory I'm so glad we got a home to go
[2:22:45] to he saw this place we have a spiritual
[2:22:49] ason to come in this day and he told us
[2:22:52] these things that the power of God is
[2:22:54] unlimited let me say
[2:22:57] this as the prophet said in the quote
[2:23:00] there that if you can get your soul your
[2:23:04] thinking and your attitude lined up then
[2:23:08] he goes further and says if you can get
[2:23:10] your
[2:23:11] thoughts your
[2:23:13] testimony and your life lined up now we
[2:23:17] have found our position because of the
[2:23:20] bridegroom call can you say Amen there
[2:23:24] is a shout what was the shout it was the
[2:23:28] message going forth calling out a bride
[2:23:31] we have found our position there aren't
[2:23:33] you glad about it how many so glad
[2:23:35] you're a part of this great message how
[2:23:37] you so glad you heard the voice you

[2:23:44] Ben as your song says that voice guides
[2:23:47] me directs me we recognize our voice but
[2:23:52] now Lord Place my
[2:23:55] soul my
[2:23:57] thinking and my
[2:24:00] attitude right with the perfect plan and
[2:24:05] will of God I want us to think about
[2:24:08] that internalize that just a little bit
[2:24:10] further a little bit
[2:24:12] deeper how do we come to the house of
[2:24:14] the Lord what position do we find
[2:24:18] ourselves and I think if our mind is
[2:24:21] stabilized properly then we won't be so
[2:24:24] easily
[2:24:26] offended uhhuh we can serve better once
[2:24:31] these things our soul our thinking and
[2:24:34] our attitude is right if our attitude is
[2:24:37] right then it it sets us in position for
[2:24:42] whatever God has for you that day it's
[2:24:45] like I'm going You're Gonna Be crucified
[2:24:47] today if your attitude is right you're
[2:24:49] like a lamb
[2:24:51] I'm going to raise you up today you're
[2:24:53] like a lamb it's because but your
[2:24:55] attitude has to be right I'm going to
[2:24:56] close this out in one scripture in 1
[2:25:00] Peter chapter
[2:25:04] 2 and this is how I'm been internalizing
[2:25:08] these thoughts of Lord I need more power
[2:25:11] in my life and I know that the power of
[2:25:14] God is unlimited I have two or three
[2:25:16] powerful quotes here and brother vom
[2:25:19] talks about it as you turn there say
[2:25:22] Lord Jesus I don't know what more to say
[2:25:24] I pray God shall I just have a little
[2:25:26] prayer
[2:25:27] father this is in the message
[2:25:30] perseverance he says that maybe there
[2:25:33] would be strangers here that we might
[2:25:34] see you're still the same yesterday
[2:25:36] today and forever keeping your word
[2:25:40] maybe there will be someone with faith
[2:25:41] enough to break through that barrier
[2:25:44] Yonder the sound barrier that sin
[2:25:47] barrier that unbelieving barrier barrier
[2:25:50] Yonder break through that to where all
[2:25:54] things are possible granted Lord we're
[2:25:58] told that when a plane passes a sound
[2:26:01] barrier it's Unlimited in speed and
[2:26:04] power God if we could just break through
[2:26:08] that power of unbelief Miracles and
[2:26:11] things and Promises of God are unlimited
[2:26:16] for all things are possible to him that
[2:26:20] believe it you know you know even if
[2:26:22] your church is in a spiritual church
[2:26:25] even if your group is in a spiritual
[2:26:28] group that doesn't have to hinder you
[2:26:31] it's unlimited to
[2:26:36] you what did James say on Wednesday you
[2:26:40] have not because you ask not and brother
[2:26:44] Ram says you ask not because what you
[2:26:47] believe not and then James says you ask
[2:26:50] ask and you don't receive because you
[2:26:54] ask a
[2:26:56] miss you ask wrongly so that you can
[2:26:59] receive it upon your own
[2:27:01] lust but Lord if there is no other
[2:27:05] preacher or minister or believer that
[2:27:10] can believe for the signs wonders
[2:27:13] Miracles the dead being raised the death
[2:27:17] ears to open if there is nobody like
[2:27:20] that Lord I'll be willing to be that I

[2:27:28] doesn't agree with it I want to walk
[2:27:31] into those Realms of the
[2:27:34] unlimited power that you pay for at
[2:27:38] Calvary I'm not waiting for somebody
[2:27:40] else to agree with me I'm not waiting
[2:27:43] for a team of Brothers to agree with me

[2:27:50] and I want to agree with that word amen

[2:29:39] God bless you I got to tease you
[2:29:42] Father's Day Happy Father's
[2:29:44] Day 1 Peter chapter 2 and verse number
[2:29:50] 17 says honor all men love the
[2:29:52] Brotherhood fear God honor the king look
[2:29:55] at Verse 18 servants be subject to your
[2:29:58] Masters one version says slaves talking
[2:30:01] about slaves servants be subject to your
[2:30:04] masters with all fear not only to the
[2:30:06] good and the gentle but also to the
[2:30:09] forward for this is thankworthy if a man
[2:30:13] for conscience towards God endure grief
[2:30:18] suffering wrongfully
[2:30:20] for what glory is it if when you be
[2:30:23] buffeted for your faults you shall take
[2:30:26] it patiently but if when you do well and
[2:30:29] suffer for it yet take it
[2:30:32] patiently
[2:30:34] this is acceptable with God for even
[2:30:39] here unto were ye called I was called to
[2:30:43] that because Christ also suffered for us
[2:30:47] leaving us an example that we should
[2:30:49] follow in his steps who did no sin
[2:30:53] neither was G found in his mouth and
[2:30:56] mouth who when he was reviled revow not
[2:30:58] again when he suffered he threatened not
[2:31:01] but committed himself to him that
[2:31:04] judgeth
[2:31:06] righteously who himself bear our sins
[2:31:09] and his own body on the tree that we
[2:31:12] being dead to sin should live unto
[2:31:14] righteousness by whose Stripes you were
[2:31:17] healed for ye were as sheep going astray
[2:31:21] but now are you returning to the
[2:31:24] shepherd and Bishop of your
[2:31:27] souls look at this verse 17 and you
[2:31:30] could just follow along in your in the
[2:31:32] King James traditional and look at verse
[2:31:35] 17 in another translation it says this
[2:31:37] show proper respect to everyone love the
[2:31:40] family of Believers fear God honor the
[2:31:42] emperor slaves in reverent fear of God
[2:31:45] submit yourself to your Masters not only
[2:31:48] to those who are good and considerate
[2:31:51] considerate but also to those who are
[2:31:55] harsh say no I'm going to quit my boss
[2:31:58] needs to respect me says you know you
[2:32:01] got to treat you got to submit to that
[2:32:03] for if it is commendable if someone
[2:32:06] Bears up under the pain of unjust
[2:32:09] suffering because they are conscious of
[2:32:11] God but how is it to your credit if you
[2:32:15] receive a beating for doing wrong and
[2:32:18] endure it but if you suffer for doing
[2:32:21] good and you endure it this is
[2:32:25] commendable before God to this you were
[2:32:30] called because Christ suffered for you
[2:32:34] leaving you an example that you should
[2:32:37] follow in his steps did you know that we
[2:32:42] were
[2:32:43] called to
[2:32:46] people criticizing our good works

[2:32:54] to that that we were called like we're

[2:33:12] over here I'm gonna go do that and you
[2:33:13] go do that and then someone turns and
[2:33:17] criticizes you for it

[2:33:54] your hand and they leave you hanging

[2:34:24] me but when we're criticized for things
[2:34:28] that I was actually just trying to help
[2:34:31] somebody I I did that because I was
[2:34:33] really my motive was trying to help and
[2:34:35] then they criticize you gotta be careful
[2:34:38] because your righteous indignation you

[2:34:42] against him you want to put them on
[2:34:44] blast for them coming at you when you

[2:40:47] Lord oh
[2:40:49] Lord I love they play that softly let's
[2:40:53] bow our heads and just meditate on that
[2:40:56] just a moment you keep playing that
[2:40:58] Softly As you you think on those those
[2:41:01] thing those three things the thoughts
[2:41:03] your testimony your life but brother
[2:41:05] Brandon brings that your soul your
[2:41:08] thinking your attitude can all be one be
[2:41:13] saying the same
[2:41:14] thing then that's where the power of God
[2:41:17] lies because he SE sees your soul he
[2:41:21] sees your thoughts he sees your
[2:41:25] attitude and
[2:41:27] and really that's where you want to
[2:41:31] shine it's not so much on the outside
[2:41:35] physical what everyone can see but what
[2:41:39] does God
[2:41:41] see what does God see well he sees what
[2:41:44] you're thinking he sees what your
[2:41:46] attitude is he can look down and your
[2:41:49] soul and if there's something down in
[2:41:52] there that's
[2:41:55] cancerous that's a evil
[2:41:58] thought that's not
[2:42:02] correct you know he knows all about it
[2:42:05] you just have to be honest with
[2:42:07] him and don't and don't lie to
[2:42:11] yourself he knows all about
[2:42:14] it he knows you don't want those things
[2:42:17] in your life
[2:42:19] he knows you want to be a True Believer
[2:42:24] today he has that life for you it's the
[2:42:28] power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you
[2:42:31] to take those things away to move you
[2:42:35] further you know you you need the Holy
[2:42:37] Ghost you're born again by the Holy
[2:42:39] Ghost but then when the Holy Ghost comes
[2:42:41] into your life he begins to take things
[2:42:45] out of you that's not pleasing to God
[2:42:49] little aggressions little things in your
[2:42:51] past your history even the your makeup
[2:42:54] your little complexes that you have the
[2:42:57] Holy Spirit is there to deal with all of
[2:43:00] that and that's what I that's the church
[2:43:03] I believe God is coming is rapturing
[2:43:08] it's getting in line that's what's
[2:43:10] coming in position your soul your
[2:43:13] thoughts and your attitude Lord make
[2:43:16] that
[2:43:17] right amen
