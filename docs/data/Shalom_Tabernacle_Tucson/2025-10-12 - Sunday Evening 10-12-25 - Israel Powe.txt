And Sister Hope wasn't here this morning, so she didn't know that our service was about us being sheep and him being the good shepherd. And &gt;&gt; and then we don't sing the verses to that song very often. And so just fear not, little flock. How encouraging that is. We know that God is mindful of everything we're going through. And just thinking through, we're picking out the songs this morning for the musicians. And one that we hadn't sung for a long time, come and dine, the master calleth. And the second verse of that, the disciples came to land. He satisfies the hungry every time. And then brother Israel comes out and takes the text just a couple verses after that when he was talking to the disciples there. And he's just so mindful. I just I love the beauty of that where you just see God is orchestrating, you know, we we get in the way of him doing what he wants to do, but I just thankful that he can use his imperfect flesh and you know that he gets all the praise, honor, and glory out of it. So maybe we could sing one. It's we don't have it on the the sheet, but it's gentle shepherd. Do we know that one? Sort of. All right. figure out what key we do that one in. &gt;&gt; Gentle sheer come and lead us. For we need you to help us find our way. Gentle shepher come and feed us [Music] for we need your strength from day to day. And there's no other. Oh, and there's no other we can turn to. Who can help us face another day? [Music] Gentle shepher come and lead us for we need you to help us find our way. We just sing that one more time. Come and lead us, Lord. Oh gentle shepher come and lead us for we need you to help us find our way. Gentle shepherd come and feed us. Oh gentle shepher [Music] come and feed us for we need your strength from day to day. There's no other that we can turn to. Oh, and there's no other that we can turn to. Who can help us to face another day? Oh gentle shepher come and lead us for we need you to help us &gt;&gt; find our way. Thank you. Amen. Let us pray. Gentle shepherd, we ask you to lead us through your word tonight. Lead us by your holy spirit to green pastures. Lord, food for our souls. We pray. Father, we commit ourselves to you our hearing, our understanding, our very spirit and our life. We open it up to you and you alone, Lord. And may you give to each one what they have need of at this junction of the journey. Oh Lord, we thank you for the songs that have gone forward. Thinking of that song, only believe Lord of you, the good shepherd, Lord. You lead your children. Fear not, little flock, Lord. We are part of that flock tonight. May you bless us. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you, saints. So good to be in house of the Lord with you tonight. Amen. It's always good to see each of you. We'd like to go right into the word. Thank you, Sister Hope, for that song. Very nice. And um, Brother Zach, very nice. And the songs this morning, God bless you. A portion of scripture we like to turn to quickly is in Genesis chapter 18. And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Meamra, and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day. He lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood by him. And when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself towards the ground. And he said, "My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away. I pray thee from thy servant. Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts." Amen. &gt;&gt; After that ye shall pass on, for therefore are you come or you come to your servant. And they said, so do as thou hast said. And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal needed, make cakes upon the earth. And Abraham ran unto the herd, fetched a calf tender, good, and gave it unto the young man. And he hasted to dress it. And he took butter and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. &gt;&gt; And they said unto him, Where is Sarah, thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life, and lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age, and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am wax old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? And the Lord said unto Abraham, "Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I have a shorty bear a child which am old? Is there anything too hard for the Lord?" &gt;&gt; At the time appointed, I will return unto thee according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then Sarah denied, saying, I laugh not, for she was afraid. And he said, Nay, but thou did laugh. And the man rose up from then and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. And the Lord said, "Shall I hide from Abraham the things which I do?" Amen. It's a beautiful scene in the scripture and it is absolutely relevant to to our day today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So may God bless his word. Let us pray one more time. Lord Jesus, as we enter into this portion of the service, Lord, may you bless us. May we say what you want us to say. And may the Holy Spirit let us hear what you want us to hear for your divine glory and praise. It's in Jesus name we ask. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. Certainly enjoy the presence of the Lord this morning. We like that Holy Spirit coming down and blessing us in his word in the atmosphere of worship and praise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We long for more of that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad that the Lord um gives us those little moments of refreshing. &gt;&gt; Tonight, we're going to continue in this uh feeding of the sheep and this hidden food. And the prophet of God is dealing with this in the message spiritual food in due season 1965. If you have a chance to go and hear that and read that in that message, brother Bannam is uh really laying out the judgment that is predicted upon the age and that we are in a time of judgment. And he goes and he mentions that he was in up in sunset there &gt;&gt; where the angels came down and he started to relay the story of him talking with brother Mchuse about his eye about his mother being healed and then how that great blast came down and spoke three words judgment is striking the west coast. &gt;&gt; He said it was a blast. Brother Mchuse, if you all remember when he gives his testimony, he said he was there, he only heard two blasts, but brother Bam said there was three blasts. And those three blasts were three words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Judgment striking the West Coast. It's very tremendous. And it's in this message that the judgments of God being over the age over the nation that brother Bannam is now bringing Elijah having a safe place during the judgment. And he said, "I'm going to type Elijah with the church, the last day church that is hidden away during these judgments." &gt;&gt; And this is why you and I are alive today. &gt;&gt; It's because we have hidden food that's been stored up for us. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he um um says that the Lord provided a secret place for Elijah. And paragraph number 37 in spiritual food in due season, the prophet of God says this. He says, "Now Elijah during that time had a secret place that God had ordained for him to go." That's the thing we want to see now just before we have the prayer line. Elijah had a secret place provided provided by God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the church never provided it for him. The king never provided it for him. He didn't provide it himself. But God provided a secret place for Elijah to be fed all the time during the drought. &gt;&gt; Where his food was provided day by day. &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't need to wonder what's going to happen tomorrow or wonder if the supply would run out. God said, "I have pro commanded the ravens. They'll feed you." What a wonderful thing. A type of our secret place in Christ. Do you have a secret place? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you you got a secret place in Christ &gt;&gt; where he has provided for you? When the world council and all that's going on today that says the days of miracles is passed, the great powers of God has been taken out of the churches, they seem like anymore they don't have nothing but a sounding brass and a tingling symbol. We know that to be truth, the form of godliness and denying the power thereof. Now, so brother Madam goes deeper into this message and um says this in paragraph 157. I trust this will be a blessing to you. He says, paragraph 158, it says, "Now the man who preaches the social gospel don't believe that all. He'd walk up to the door, look in, and stand there and say, well, just another bunch of holy rollers walk away." But he don't know that this is the hidden food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He don't know that this is the secret thing that's hid from him. He don't know. It's It's pitiful. A mind that's naked, miserable, blind, and don't know it. See, that's a bad thing. Oh, God, let me die first. But don't never get me like that. I'd rather die. Yes, sir. than to do that. I think every one of us, wouldn't we? But now, God has promised us these things in the last days in Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Amen. said that Jesus Christ would come down and impersonate himself in human flesh like he did at Sodom. &gt;&gt; That's right. And said the world will be in a solemn condition and said as it was then the son of man will be revealed that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See this man that come down in the form of a man which was Elohim by Abraham before his promised son came. Look what it was. Abraham said it was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now remember in our the the water baptism message we brought on Wednesday. And here Abraham sees the Bible says three men came to him. But Abraham addresses only one as Lord. &gt;&gt; The three are one. There's only one Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Never separates them. He calls him Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Continue. says and the Bible said there was three men came to him dust on their clothes travel sat down and eat like men and Jesus said just at that time the world gets in the sodom condition then the son of man would reveal himself again &gt;&gt; not son of god son of man see would reveal himself &gt;&gt; so what is this language for isn't the son of god just as easy to say as the son of man &gt;&gt; no no No, no, no. Son of man. &gt;&gt; He makes that makes that uh uh very very clear that wording that the son of man would reveal himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now Mark that with the last prophet said, "Behold, I send to you Elijah the prophet." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will restore the hearts of the children back to the father. see &gt;&gt; a message to bring them back to the pe back to the Bible. And the son of man will be revealing himself in that day. &gt;&gt; And at that day, the sounding of the last churches, the seventh angel, the mystery of God should be made known in that day. The seven seals will be broken. The mysteries of all these churches and things, how they happen and how taking place. So here &gt;&gt; the prophet of God is making it clear that this man that was revealed in Genesis 18 and tying it with the man that's to be revealed in the last days &gt;&gt; is the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many enjoy the chief shepherd message this morning? &gt;&gt; That Jesus Christ is our chief shepherd. &gt;&gt; How many know that there's a prophet shepherd? &gt;&gt; Amen. And how you know that there is a local shepherd. &gt;&gt; Now all of these shepherds are still sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Yet he was the chief shepherd. The prophet is still a sheep. Yet he was a prophet shepherd. &gt;&gt; And the local shepherds, they're still sheep. &gt;&gt; But their calling is a local shepherd. &gt;&gt; And the congregants are sheep. And I read for you that many places, many times, brother Bannon refers to the local shepherd or the pastors as prophets. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the New Testament sense, as prophets, &gt;&gt; but that's preachers. That's not an Old Testament terminology as a prophet. But nowhere did he ever type the New Testament preacher prophets as son of man. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; That is only one that holds that office to reveal the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's food for us in this last day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's actually hidden food. &gt;&gt; It's food for your soul. And the people that are not eating this food, you see why they handled the message the way they handled it. &gt;&gt; They handled it like it's a secondary reference point. They handled it like brother Banner was just a good brother, a good man, like an evangelist on the field. No, no, no. Let's make that very clear. This was not just a man preaching. This was the office of a prophet revealing the son of man. &gt;&gt; A prophet, &gt;&gt; a son of man revealing &gt;&gt; the son of man. So Genesis 18 can never be read the same way again. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Genesis 18, &gt;&gt; brother Brandon bring comes to the pullpit, turns his back to the audience. He said to prove to you that the same angel that was in Genesis 18 is here tonight. &gt;&gt; He performs the same sign, the same wonder. There's no pastor, there's no five-fold minister, there's no group, there's no elder that can ever &gt;&gt; replicate Genesis 18. Can I get a witness? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. is hidden food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you'll see why many people handle the message the way they do because they lack this opening of the word. &gt;&gt; Now look at this here. Brother Bham says, &gt;&gt; see paragraph 158. But he don't know that this is hidden food. &gt;&gt; He don't know that this is the secret thing that's hid from him. He doesn't know it. It's pitiful. a mind that's miserable and naked. And he brings in Genesis 18. Did you notice Abraham how he's moving very quickly? You notice in Genesis 18, he makes haste. He's telling Sarah to hurry up. &gt;&gt; He's telling the young man to go get a calf. &gt;&gt; No processed food here. &gt;&gt; This is real food. &gt;&gt; She got to go make that. You got to go make that that cake. Make it hastily. go get the the the tender lamb and cut him up and he's running and he's moving and he's offering this food to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet tells us that the same angel that was there is here tonight. He proved that. &gt;&gt; What other minister could do that? Whoever whoever did that like that, you know, let me say this, saints. This message is the truth. And it's not just partial truth. &gt;&gt; There is no equivalent message that anybody is preaching anywhere in this entire age to compare with the hidden manner that was to come down in our generation. &gt;&gt; We're a privileged people. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. So now this hidden mana, this hidden food here, what the prophet of God says in reference to Revelations chapter 2, he says he'll give them hidden mana. Paragraph 275. Hidden mana. Let's give the interpretation the best we can. I'm reading what does hidden mana type. Hidden mana was the manner that was kept in the place or the showbread in the Bible that was only for the priest. How many know knows that around? See now that he had bread for the congregation. They had bread for the congregation. But there was a special bread for the priest. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is a special bread. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A special bread, hidden mana. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it? Who is our mana? Christ. All right. St. John the 6th chapter 48th 50th verse. If you're putting it down, Jesus said, "The bread of life that come from God out of heaven, the mana." Well, what is the hidden mana? The mana that isn't given to all the congregation, the revelation is poured out upon the angel of the church. The revelation of the word, see, revelation of the word is given to the angel of that age. For it's hid from everywhere &gt;&gt; and revealed back the hidden mana. It's addressed to the angel of the church. See, you get it. &gt;&gt; It's a little bigger revelation of what Christ is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe a little higher calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, is brother Bam the seventh angel? &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. You can't you can't mess with that. If he is the seventh angel, then he has a hidden mana. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that hidden mana is a little more &gt;&gt; than just the congregation can get. &gt;&gt; So we can all read the same scripture. We can all read the same history. But if God doesn't reveal it &gt;&gt; and God has revealed this mana to our messenger. &gt;&gt; Now after it's revealed to the messenger, he now brings it to the sheep &gt;&gt; that's following his message. So we are the benefactors &gt;&gt; of the heaven hidden manner. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That should have put a smile on your face. &gt;&gt; Even if you tired, a tired smile should come on your face because the revelation that we have received, &gt;&gt; came from Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the hidden mana and that's what we're feeding on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go along tonight. I'm just going to go until I stop. Okay. &gt;&gt; And this hidden manner, &gt;&gt; is revealed to the angel of the age. And then it's brought down to the people of the age. It's revelation. Now, let's go a little bit further. When we talk about revelation, the prophet of God talks about the greatest of all revelations and he uses this terms in the Patmas vision. He says this here and there's a reason why he brings this in paragraph 132. Um, if we had time, we would read Acts chapter 2 and 38 and show you where Peter in his original message was, repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins. What was he doing? He was showing that Matthew 28:19 is being fulfilled right now with the way I'm going to do this baptism. So Jesus gave the command go teach and baptize in the name of the father, son, and holy ghost. That was the command. &gt;&gt; But the obedience to that command was in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; This is a revelation that Peter had showing that the Lord Jesus Christ is the father, the son, and the holy ghost. That's right. &gt;&gt; You must know who this is when you're going to pray to him. &gt;&gt; If there are three different people, who are you praying to? &gt;&gt; Which one is your friend? Which one is above you? Which one is in you? &gt;&gt; They're all the same. &gt;&gt; But the strict trinitarian view moves you away from this great revelation. But the Bible keeps it very clean for us, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; Jesus said it. Peter and Paul did it. And so this is the great revelation that was poured out. Brother Bannam is taken in Revelations chapter 1 verses 10 and 11. It says this here paragraph 132. A great one's approaching. A trumpet sounds. Somebody's coming. He looked. Hallelujah. Trumpet saying I am alpha and omega &gt;&gt; the first and the last. Not an announcement of a second party or a third party, but the only party. &gt;&gt; I'm both alpha and omega. &gt;&gt; Before I show you anything, I want to let you know who I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The greatest of all revelations is the deity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ. You can't get to first base until you believe that. &gt;&gt; That's what Peter said. Repent and then see the deity. Be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins. And then you're ready to go in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The first thing you have to know is the deity of Christ. I am alpha and omega. &gt;&gt; I am from A to Z. &gt;&gt; There's no more but me. I was at the beginning. I'll be at the end. I'm he that was, which is, and shall come, the Almighty. Think of it. That's what the trumpet said. &gt;&gt; Be careful, John. You're entered into the spirit. Something's going to be revealed to you. &gt;&gt; What is it? A trumpet sound. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The first thing, I'm Alpha and Omega. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The first of all revelations. &gt;&gt; Oh, sinner, bow your head. Repent now before the time is too late. I'm alpha and omega. That's the first thing he let him know who he was. Who's this approaching? Is it King Jesus, King God, King Holy Ghost? He said, I'm all of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm from A to Z. I'm the beginning &gt;&gt; and the ending. I'm the immortal, eternal one. Just a little later, we watch him in a sevenfold personages. Drop down. All right. The first of all revelations is the supreme deity of Jesus Christ. You must know who he is when you hear his voice. &gt;&gt; Do you know who he is when you hear his voice? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. This revelation is essential. &gt;&gt; Saints, &gt;&gt; young people, brothers and sisters, this is essential. This &gt;&gt; is where all of the nonsense that's going on today is people lack this revelation right here. &gt;&gt; Yes, that is true. &gt;&gt; They've taken parts of the message and made it optional material. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Or they've invalidated it &gt;&gt; or they've eulogized it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They've made it they've rendered it with no power, no life, no validity at all. &gt;&gt; But this word is still alive, saints. And it's alive to those that know that it's been given to them as hidden food for the age that we live in. &gt;&gt; It's the secret things that belong that come from the Lord to his children. &gt;&gt; These are the precious moments, the precious secrets that he unfolds to the believer. Yes, &gt;&gt; it is essential that you and I have this relationship with the Lord where he's revealing himself to you personally. &gt;&gt; It is how he speaks to his children &gt;&gt; from the little ones to the old ones. &gt;&gt; And as long as you live here on this earth, you will be receiving these revelations from the almighty God. &gt;&gt; And when he speaks to you, he'll come. I am Alpha. I am Omega. &gt;&gt; I am the first. I am the last. &gt;&gt; I am he that was, but I'm alive forever more. &gt;&gt; I am King God, King Theophony, King Lord, Savior. I am all of that. &gt;&gt; He reveals himself when he speaks to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this great revelation, and it's hidden. Amen. But it's food for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is why you're alive today, saints. &gt;&gt; If you're not alive, it's probably because what you're eating. &gt;&gt; If you're not alive, you need to eat something good so you can get alive. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Remember Elijah ate them cakes one time and he went into strength for 40 days and 40 nights. &gt;&gt; You talk about an energy bar. &gt;&gt; What was in them cakes? It was something supernatural. I can tell you that. &gt;&gt; I can tell you that there's nobody else that ate what he ate and could do what he did. And it was supernatural. And if you eat the bread of life for your day, it'll do and have the same effect upon you &gt;&gt; supernaturally. &gt;&gt; Going on strong with the Lord. Craziness coming on every side. Backsliders, liars, people manifesting himself. But the true believer is still moving on with the Lord, still rising, still shining, still praising, still worshiping. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's alive and well. Did we sing that one? &gt;&gt; Live in me to tell that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; He is alive. &gt;&gt; He's alive and well. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is hidden food is the greatest of all revelations. &gt;&gt; You'll know that this angel that came down in Revelations 18 is what's taking place in our day. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's what this is about. That's what that's about. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's Genesis 18. That's before Calvary. &gt;&gt; That's before the New Testament. &gt;&gt; It's way back in the plains of memory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham meets these three men out on the desert and the men are talking to him about these precious promises &gt;&gt; and Sarah's in the background listening and she hears something that was too much for her faith to catch a hold of. She didn't say it out loud. She said it like some of you, like all of us, we say little, we mumble little things. Mumble, grumble, mumble. And this maybe wasn't a mumble. Maybe it was just a question. Me have pleasure with my Lord. She laughed. She That's funny joke. That's funny. And the angel &gt;&gt; that was She didn't say it in his face. She wasn't looking at him in face to face. She was in the tent behind the angel. &gt;&gt; And the Lord is speaking to Abraham. &gt;&gt; You know that same Lord hears and knows every one of your thoughts, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; He knows every one of your thoughts. And I want my thoughts to line up with what his program is. &gt;&gt; It's very hard for me to think of Sarah having a baby. And I can imagine her thinking, "This is impossible for me to have a baby." And just like any other promise that many of you are waiting for, it might be impossible for it to happen in your life. But whatever the promise is, if God said it, I want my faith to get in the will of whatever his will is &gt;&gt; and not look at how hard it could be, how difficult the circumstance. &gt;&gt; God said it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Don't laugh at it. God said it. &gt;&gt; Is there anything too hard for the Lord? &gt;&gt; Is it too late? He can't fix your problem. &gt;&gt; Is he run out of time? He can't take care of your issues. &gt;&gt; There's nothing too hard for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. So, the prophet moves forward here. Just have a couple pages of quotes. I won't read all, but I'll just lay this in here. This hidden food. This is hidden. Like I said this morning, it's not everything that is said, it's things that are not said. It's things that are implied. Like in the news, you go and listen to the news, it's not just what they're saying, it's what they're not saying. They don't give you the full story. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Five:00 news is only giving you the part that they want to give you. That's not what's going on in the streets. That's not what's going on in every household, in every neighborhood. Are we serious? There's things going on right now that the news never covers. If all you feed on is the news, you're getting partial part of the story. You're not getting the full story. But this right here gives you the entire story. &gt;&gt; You're not missing anything when you're in line with what's going on here. All the prophetic utterances and where we are today. And so this is hidden food. There's many of them. I'm just going to touch on this one just for a moment. The Lord will help me. This is in the message the unveiling of God. 1964 paragraph 22. Now my subject this morning, I trust that God will reveal this. And each time if you who take the tapes and listen, I hope and trust that you have had spiritual understanding of what that God God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out. See, it's a thing. Sometimes we have to say things in such a way that it might thin down. Amen. &gt;&gt; It might bring some to go out, some to leave, and some to ponder over. &gt;&gt; But that's done purposely. &gt;&gt; It must be done that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then it might be that some would say, "You mean God would purposely do a thing like that?" He certainly did. &gt;&gt; He does. Yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, Lord, just say it right out. Just say it. &gt;&gt; Say it right out." He doesn't say things right out. &gt;&gt; He has to leave the element of the revelation has to strike you. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is where your prayer life comes in. Because if everything is said right out, then you can just on the educational side just read and read and read and read and think you have it. It's more to it than just reading. &gt;&gt; What about the saints that can't read? &gt;&gt; So it has to be uh of course read. You have to hear it spoken the words of life. But then there has to be the element of a revelation that it strikes to you. Oh, that's what he's saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's talking about himself or he's talking about me. &gt;&gt; He's there describing this bride and describing this elect lady and you'll listen. You'll listen. You think it's that one is all these people. But it's so nice when you realize that he's actually talking about you &gt;&gt; and he's talking to you. &gt;&gt; Isn't that nice? &gt;&gt; All these tapes were just for you. Can you receive that tonight? Look at your neighbor and tell them, &gt;&gt; look at your neighbor. Tell them, "Neighbor, &gt;&gt; all of the message &gt;&gt; is just for you." &gt;&gt; They got your name on it. &gt;&gt; The Bible. &gt;&gt; Come on, tell them. Look at him. Tell them &gt;&gt; the Bible &gt;&gt; is just for you. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the Thank you. Give the Lord hand of praise. Thank you. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Brother Jonathan, I didn't like them look at your neighbor preachers. I hated those. And I'm one now today. Look at your neighbor. Touch your neighbor three time. This is get on my nerves. But I see why we need to do that. &gt;&gt; All right. So the Bible is for you. messages for you. Here what the prophet of God says here. He said one day when he had thousands around him, he said, "Except you eat my flesh of the son of God or son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you." What kind of a statement do you think that a medical doctor or nurse or any fine intellectual person would think of a statement like that? For a man that had a ministry like he had, why would he say eat the flesh? That's cannibal. to drink human blood. It's a vampire. In other words, he wants us to be cannibals and vampires. And the whole audience walked away from him. And there was a ministerial social with him of 70 that had been chosen. And he turned to them. He says, "What will you think when you see the son of man ascending from where he come from?" Now, he didn't explain that. He never explained how. Paul did that later on. He just said it. See, and then when this he said, "What will you say to these ministers when you see the Son of Man ascending from where he come from?" No doubt them men said, "Now just a moment. Oh, we eat with him. We fish with him. We sleep with him. We know where he was born. We seen the cradle that he was rocked in. How does this man, this is a hard saying, &gt;&gt; and the Bible says they didn't walk with him anymore. They left him. Then he left the 12. He had chosen 12 and one of them was the devil. He says, "So he turned to them and there's no one could explain what he had just said. How are they going to eat his flesh and drink his blood? How did he come down when he was born right here on earth?" See, they couldn't understand it. And then he turned to the apostles and he says, "Do you want to go also?" And then that's when Apostle Peter made that great statement. Lord, to whom would we go? How many's in that position there? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; How many's at that spot in life? &gt;&gt; Some people have a plan B. &gt;&gt; Some people have a second or secondary plan if this don't work. &gt;&gt; I am not one of those people. I If this doesn't work, I'm done. I'm lost. &gt;&gt; This is the only plan I have &gt;&gt; of getting out of here is the word of the Lord and this message. It has been revealed to me &gt;&gt; more great, more deep than my mother being the lovely Geraldine Poe. My mother is Geraldine Poe. I know that was my mama and my daddy Jordan Poe. My lovely parents, my family members. I love them. I know them. I thank God for them. And this has been revealed to me as much as me knowing who my mom and dad is naturally. &gt;&gt; I know who my mother and father is spiritually. I know where I belong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is crazy talk, but it's been revealed to me. &gt;&gt; Like Simeon, &gt;&gt; he got up one morning and the Holy Ghost told him, "Go and find that child. &gt;&gt; I revealed it to you by the spirit. It's not going to be in the news. Your friends are not going to be able to update you on what to do next. It's a revelation &gt;&gt; and the entire church is built upon it. You have to have that. Is that right, saints? &gt;&gt; Hey, they misunderstood him. Eat my flesh and drink my blood. They left him. There's no one can explain what he just said. How are they going to eat his flesh and drink his blood? How did he come down when he was born right here on the earth? And that's when paragraph 30, the Apostle Peter made that great statement, Lord, to whom would we go? See we for we are satisfied. We know surely that you and you alone have the word of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of this hour &gt;&gt; we are satisfied of that. See they could not explain it. You can't explain faith. is something that you believe &gt;&gt; and it's so solid that there is nothing else will take its place. &gt;&gt; Therefore, they know that that word that was written for that age that they were living in the Messiah age that he fit that place exactly. And what could they do? Go back in what could they do to go back in them cold formal churches that they had come out of? Said where would they go to? See, we are fully persuaded that you have the word of life. &gt;&gt; And they couldn't explain it, but they believed it. See, &gt;&gt; and Jesus said that to weed down his crowd. See, &gt;&gt; has the crowd been weeded down? &gt;&gt; Has it been thinning down? &gt;&gt; Oh, it's done on purpose. &gt;&gt; Some more need to leave, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Go on and leave. Let them go. See, till he could get that group together and out of all those people that only 11 of them then understood actually who he was. &gt;&gt; They know that he was God and God alone. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 284 knows now Moses were the word was the word that day because the word was given to him for that day. Moses, Joseph was the word in his day portraying Christ. Exactly. See, each one of them was the word. And when Jesus came, he was the word in its fullness because the whole plan of redemption laid in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believe the word &gt;&gt; come down again in our day? &gt;&gt; And was revealed in the ministry of a son of man. &gt;&gt; And it is a revelation. It's hidden food. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you get that revelation, you don't have no problems with the statements &gt;&gt; or the visions &gt;&gt; or the hard sayings. &gt;&gt; You just make it work. &gt;&gt; Even if it don't work, you just stay right with it. &gt;&gt; You got to close your mouth sometime. &gt;&gt; You can't There's no answer to everything. &gt;&gt; You can't, you know, you just you got to look dumb. &gt;&gt; You just don't know. &gt;&gt; You just walk away and say, "Well, that's what he said." and keep on moving &gt;&gt; because they're going to prove to you one way or the other through their scientific achievement that everything we're doing is wrong. &gt;&gt; They'll continue to prove they prove that Noah was wrong &gt;&gt; until he wasn't. &gt;&gt; They proved that he was wrong. They proved it scientifically. There's no rain up there until one day there was rain up there. &gt;&gt; And this is how God always does it. He lets the critics grow and they grow. First he vindicates a man. Then he lets the critics grow and grow around it. No answer to them. And let them grow. Let them grow. Then there's a showdown. And the God that answers by fire. He is God. &gt;&gt; And we're coming to another showdown, saints. &gt;&gt; I'm on the Lord's side. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I'm on the Lord's side. I'm not an explainer as the Reverend Brother Muse would say. &gt;&gt; We're not explainers. &gt;&gt; We're believers. &gt;&gt; Do you believe the word of the Lord? &gt;&gt; God richly bless you. It's hidden food in due season. May the Lord bless you richly with just that little portion of the word. I I'm going to close here. Okay, let us pray. Musicians come please. Thank you Lord for your word tonight as we just wanted to bring this Genesis 18 out to the people. How the prophet brought it out to us that Sarah was in the tent behind this conversation. A detail we never caught in the organization denomination, but the ministry in the last last day pulled it out of the scripture and showed that she was in the tent behind the angel. And yet he caught her thought and that same angel has come down again in our generation. It is the same pillar of fire that knocked Paul off of his horse one day and revealed who Christ was. &gt;&gt; It is the same angel, the same pillar of fire that wants to reveal himself to every individual here tonight. &gt;&gt; Even the young ones, &gt;&gt; a personal revelation of who Jesus Christ is. Lord, open that up to us is our prayer. For it's upon this rock you build your church. It's the entire revelation of the Bible is built upon revelation. The entire words of truth is through revelation Lord. And I pray oh God that you would grant that to us in this time and its season. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Brother John, would you come and please take the service? Amen. [Music] He's so good to me. Yes, God. So good. Oh, God is so good. Oh, God is so good. He's so good to me. Oh, I love him so.
