Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Let's all stand. Like to welcome you all out to the house of the Lord this evening. Like to ask if uh Uncle John could you come open the service up with a word of prayer. Let's bow our heads. We thank you, Lord, for your goodness, your [music] faithfulness to us, Lord, just another chance to be able to come together with our brothers and sisters and family of God. [music] And Lord, just to lift your holy name this evening. We thank you for this place that we have as a place of refuge that we come to try to tune everything out that may be affecting our thinking, our lives, the [music] cares of this life. And Lord, we know that that's what Satan would love us to continue [music] to dwell on those things. But Lord, we just set this side this time aside tonight, Lord, just to draw closer to you, to Lord, to [music] worship you, to let you know how much we love and appreciate all you're doing for us. Lord, we thank you for this [music] opportunity to be able to just voice our needs to each other. And Lord, you know about whatever we're going through. And but you say we have not because we [music] ask not. And so Lord, we just as we have this prayer meeting tonight, we just ask Lord that you would just [music] have the preeminence. And Lord, we just want to ask that you'd forgive us, Lord, for anything that we may have brought into the building that would just hinder your spirit from moving. And Lord, we just want to draw closer to you. That's our [music] desire tonight. Commit this time into your hands. We ask you in Jesus name. Amen. Before we sing, let's just take a moment to just greet each other and just tell them God bless you. What a fellowship. [singing] What a joy divine [music] beating [singing] on the everlasting arms. And what a blessedness, what [singing and music] a joy divine on the everlasting [music and singing] arms. Lead me, leading [music and singing] safe and secure from all [music and singing] alarms. Leading, [singing] leading, [music] leading on the everlasting [singing] arms. And oh how sweet to walk in [singing and music] this filing [singing] on the everlasting arms. And oh [singing] how bright your path grows [music] from day to day. Leading [singing] on the everlasting arm. I'm leaning. [singing and music] I'm leading safe and [singing and music] secure from all alarms. Leading [music] bleeding [music and singing] on the everlasting arms. And what have I to dread? What [music and singing] have I to bear leing on [singing and music] the everlasting arms? And I [music and singing] have blessed peace with my Lord so nearing on [singing and music] the everlasting arms. I'm leaning. [singing] [music] I'm leaning. [singing] Safe and [music] secure from all the alarms. Leaning, [singing and music] leaning, leaning [music and singing] on the ever. One more time with all your heart. Holy. I'm leaning [music] and secure [music] from every [singing] alarm. Oh, leaning, leaning, [music] leaning on the [singing] everlasting arms. Amen. and you may be seated. Well, I was there when the spirit came. Felt his power and I praise [singing] his name. [music] I was there when the spirit came. [music] [singing] Felt his power [music] flowing from above. [singing] All at once, he gave me joy and love. I was there when spirit [singing] came. [music] Oh, holy father, [singing] just let thy goodness rain. [music] Lead me Lord Jesus [singing] [music] to the spirit once again. If [singing and music] you never let his presence in, you had better go repent again. I was [singing] there when [music] the spirit came. It was [singing] on the day of Pentecost, the day in the spirit [singing] were lost. They were there when the spirit [singing and music] came. The spirit [singing and music] is the same as them. Open up [singing and music] and let him in. I was there when the spirit [singing] came. [music] Oh, holy father, just let thy goodness rain. Lead me, [singing] Lord Jesus, to the spirit once again. [singing] If you never let his presence [singing] in, [music] you had better go repent again. [singing] I was there in the spirit. If you never let his presence in. If you never let his presence in, you had [singing] better go repent [music] again. I was there when the [singing] spirit came. [music] And once like a burden risen I dwell. [singing and music] No freedom from my sorrow [singing] I felt. Then Jesus came [music and singing] and listened to me. And glory to God, he [music and singing] set me free. He set me free. Yes, he set me free. He broke the bonds [singing] of prison [music] for me. And I'm glory down my [singing] Jesus to see. Glory [music] to God. He set me free. [singing] And now I am climbing higher each day. Darkness of [singing and music] night has drifted away. My feet are planted [singing and music] on higher ground. Glory to God. I'm homeward [singing and music] bound. He set me free. Yes, he set me free.

Let's all stand as we begin to change the order of the service. Well, as I travel through this pilgrim land, [singing] there is a friend who walks [music] with me. And he leads me safely through the sinking sand. [music and singing] It is the Christ of Calary. And this would be my prayer, dear [singing and music] Lord, each day to help me do the best I can. For I need [singing and music] thy light to guide me day and night. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand. Oh Jesus, hold my hand. [music] I need thee every [singing and music] hour. And through this pilgrim land, protect me by thy power [singing] and hear [music] my feeble ple. Oh Lord, look [music and singing] down on me. For when I kneel in prayer, I know I'll meet you there. Blessed Jesus, [music and singing] hold my hand and let me travel in the light [singing and music] divine that I may see the blessed way. and keep [singing and music] me that I may be holy thine and sing redemption songs someday and [singing] I will be [music] a soldier brave and true and ever [singing] firmly take a stand [singing] and [music] as I onward go and daily meet the foe blessed Jesus Jesus [music] hold my hand. [singing] Oh [music] Jesus hold my hand. I [singing] need [music] thee every hour. And through this pilgrim land, protect [singing] [music] me by thy power and hear my feeble plea.

And when I [singing and music] kneel in prayer, I know I'll meet you there. Blessed Jesus, [singing and music] hold my hand. &gt;&gt; There are people almost everywhere whose hearts [singing and music] are all a flame. With the fire that fell at Pentecost, which cleans [music] and made them clean, it is [singing] burning now within my heart. All glory to his name. I'm so glad that I can say I'm Are you glad tonight? Oh, I'm one of them. [singing and music] I'm one of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm [music and singing] one of them. I'm one of them. One of them. I'm so glad [music and singing] that I could say I'm one of them. And though these people may not boast of worldly fame, they have [singing] all received their [music] Pentecost. Now, both far and [singing and music] wide, his power is yet the same. I'm so glad that I can say [singing and music] I'm one of them. Oh, I'm one of them. I'm one of [singing and music] them. Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm [singing] one of them. I'm one of them. I'm [music and singing] one of them. I'm so glad that I can say [singing and music] I'm one of them. Well, they were gathered in the upper room, all [music and singing] praying in his name. They were baptized with the Holy Ghost and powerful [music] service came. Now, [singing] what he did for them that he'll do for you the same. I'm so glad [singing and music] that I can say I'm one of them. Oh, one of [singing] them. I'm one of them. [bell] I'm so [singing and music] glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. [music] I'm [singing] so glad that I can say I'm one of them.

[music] I'm so glad [music] you [music] so I'm so glad I can say I'm Amen. I'm glad I can say that tonight. Aren't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. [applause] Hallelujah. [applause] Let us pray. Lord Jesus, as we come to this portion of the service tonight, I just pray that you would bless our [music] hearts, Lord, with the good things of God. Lord, just bring your fresh mana from your throne right down to our souls [music] what we have need of. Lord, we humbly wait for thee. Forgive [music] us of our shortcomings and our failures, Lord. Forgive us where we failed you. Please have [music] mercy on us, Lord. And give us one more chance, Lord. Lord, we want to [music] do what's right. We want to be right. We want to stand firm, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. [singing] &gt;&gt; We want to be an example. Please help us, we pray, in [music] this prayer meeting tonight. Bless us, we ask in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless [music] you, saint. So good to be in the house of the Lord with you again tonight on a Wednesday night. [music] Come to get my battery charged and to see each of you. Amen. And [music] so as we're gathered here tonight, let's take in the Bible, our scriptures in um Matthew chapter 11. Sorry, I my glasses. Get those Oh, I left them. I don't have them. I think they're on the back bench back there bin next to the men's restroom. If someone can grab those for me. Matthew chapter 11, our Lord Jesus speaking and verse number 25. &gt;&gt; You might thank you. And at that time Jesus answered and said,"I thank thee, oh father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prrooed and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight." Amen. One more scripture in St. John 14:12. Very familiar scriptures. Verse number 12. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also. and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father. And whatsoever you ask in my name, that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son. If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it. Amen. Let us pray. Lord Jesus, thank you for your word tonight. Lord, we come here humbly, Lord. And I just pray that the thought and the the inspiration from my heart &gt;&gt; would be conveyed how you want it to be, Lord. In Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. This little thought came on my mind today upon my heart really um as I was thinking about the great power that comes with unity and joining arms together and um not um misunderstanding one another. And I I was thinking of that word misunder to be misunderstood. Jesus was very misunderstood. And it's probably one of the the one of the I mean it's it's probably a great power of negativity can be released when you're misunderstood. I mean it's um how many's ever been ever been misunderstood and you thought clearly clearly I made myself clear and everybody understood but it happens that we do things we say things and we're 100% misunderstood. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is misunderstood. And there's a lot of lives that have been lost over a misunderstanding. &gt;&gt; Friendship severed. Um people will stop talking to one another. Feelings begin to form against others over a misunderstanding. &gt;&gt; Just that a few words could have solved it, cleared it up. But I thought you meant that. And you really meant this and I didn't verify it and I was for sure that's what you meant and that's the way I I understood it and I simply misunderstood you and this happens all the time. You can imagine wars and families and there's um rivalries with gangs and people that form and start and siblings fighting over misunderstanding. church members fighting over. And I started to think, what if all of the let's say there's 15 churches here or so if there were 15 churches and not all the deacons and family members, but all the 15 pastors were to come together in the same place and really find one thing that they could agree upon. And let's say that one thing was that every member in your church needed the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; What if all of the pastors, 15 of them in just the city alone, got together with just that one. We'll make that our our one focus, our one motive. We won't get into anything else, but every member of our church, of our churches, our families, whatever, needs to be filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Would that be a good thing? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I want you to think that through. Would that would that be a positive? &gt;&gt; You know, and you know what's what's what's so true about that? We all know that it would be a positive. It would be a good thing. Most saints that I know, that warms their heart to even think of that happening. But it ain't going to happen. And that's the sad part because something supernatural has to happen &gt;&gt; in order for that to happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if I want to achieve that naturally or by calling meetings together or calling this brother and working this out and trying to make that happen um without the move of God, then it's not going to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many can agree with that? &gt;&gt; How many know that's a even though we know it should happen and we know the benefit and the blessing that it would bring if it did happen. I would I always think about pigeons and how they're just they outnumber all their predators. But all but if all the pigeons got together [laughter] and really [clears throat] and really thought it through, they can wipe out all their predators because it's more of them than the predators. And and they would they would get the job done, but they're not going to do that. Why? because they're pigeons and they have a pigeon brain &gt;&gt; and they'll fight with each other while they're both running from the same enemy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. I used to raise a few pigeons and I've seen them operate and behave and they operate a lot like some people. &gt;&gt; Yes. on on and and you think there this one enemy is chasing an entire herd of pigeons, chasing them through the whole neighborhood. If these birds would just stop and say, "Hey guys, one of us might die, but we we can get we we can defeat our enemy once and for all, &gt;&gt; but it's not going to happen." And so I I in thinking about that, as much as I would desire that, as much as I would love for five pastors, 10 pastors or all the pastors to get together and to do that, um I realized, and this is what came into my heart as I was praying today, is that we need a sovereign move of God. &gt;&gt; When I say we, I'm talking about every single individual. And if I could if I could give something to each member of this church, if I could do it, something physical, financial, or spiritual, one supernatural thing, it it would be it would be just that that God would give you a sovereign move of God, a an outpouring for you, the individual. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is really what this church needs. &gt;&gt; That is what your pastor needs. &gt;&gt; That is what your deacons need. &gt;&gt; That is what every young person needs. &gt;&gt; This is what the individuals in this church needs. So move aside the 15 pastors in the city. Let's What about 15 people in this one church? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen with 15 people even in this church without a sovereign move of God. &gt;&gt; Now, it's possible and the the the supreme power that lays within us, I think we downplay it so many times, but I want to read a few places that will help build that so we'll know where we stand. Now the prophet of God takes this message and trying to do God a service without it being his will and he says this in paragraph 117 and as we try I as I was discussing with a group of my fine brothers Baptist brethren not long ago and they said brother Brandham we can only have a revival when we take the word word by word page by page letter by letter. And I said, I believe too, page by page. He said, I said, they've been trying to do that all along. He said, but we must find the Greek interpretation of the word, what the Greek says. And I said, I haven't read too much, but reading the history of the church and the Nasian council, Free Nas council, Nyian fathers, so forth. They were arguing back there about the Greek. That's 2,000 years ago. One said it means this. One says it means that. The Greek word means this. Just like our language, the word see, use the word sea. You could mean a body of water. I understand. Or many things. Bored could be board a hole, make a walk, or you bored me, or you pay my board, or it could mean many things. And those little vows and so forth just change the whole meaning. So you'll never do it like that. God wrote it like that because in all of the word is inspired. &gt;&gt; All of the word is inspired. And he said that I thank thee father that thou has hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent and will reveal a man to babes such as we'll learn. It's a revelation of him. As I said last evening, we'll reveal it to babes. I said it won't work, sir. I said a revival will never come until God, the sovereign God, sends it. Then he might take up a little nitwit that can't even sign his name and do it with it that knows not even good English, let alone the Greek. That's what he done in the time with Peter preached at Pentecost. You know, he couldn't even sign his name. Ignorant and unlearned. But God does those things in such a strange way to our intellectual thinking that makes it God. &gt;&gt; If he's got a bunch of theologians and dignitaries and so forth, they'd said that smart kais. He says, you see, he had it just right. But God went down, got a fisherman that couldn't even sign their name. That's what he took. That's God. He takes something that's nothing and makes something out of it to his honor. &gt;&gt; He takes chaos and made Eden. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. It's God. Now, if there's anybody got the mechanics for a revival, it's our noble brother Billy Graham. But the mechanics is all right. But the mechanics won't work move it. It takes the dynamics to move it. You can build an automobile, put fine seats in it, make fine pistons, and prove by science what it can do, but unless the dynamics is there, she's just as just a dead piece of goods. Amen. So, the prophet said it. Amen. &gt;&gt; It takes God to do it. It takes a sovereign move of God. Now, I desire to see the power of the Holy Ghost upon every single believer. &gt;&gt; Every one of you. I would desire to see that more than anything, &gt;&gt; more than you. Some of you that need to get married or are looking to finish your career or trying to find out what you are in your ministry. I would love to see that more than any other personal problem you have or trauma of your past and or any other little dynamic you're trying to work out. &gt;&gt; I would love to see and I'm talking about for my own life is to have the power of the most high God &gt;&gt; Amen. flowing in my vessel, filling me, &gt;&gt; filling me to the fullness &gt;&gt; 100% completely in his control. &gt;&gt; I long for that. &gt;&gt; I cry for that. I don't like I I I don't I don't want a a a cold dead religion. &gt;&gt; I don't want a prayer that doesn't move. Right. &gt;&gt; I I don't want to go to before people that are sick and they remain sick. &gt;&gt; Someone has cancer, we want that to move. Someone has depression or oppression or troubles, we want the Lord to heal that and deal with that. How many of you every time you hear the tapes and that that prayer line and that move of God from the ministry of Malachi 4, how many of you long to have that in your life? I believe the true believer is not so much interested in a bigger church or nicer pews or whatever. Uh I want I want Jesus. &gt;&gt; I want the Lord Jesus Christ in his fullness. I'm talking about the Jesus that appeared to us in the fullness of his word in this hour. &gt;&gt; That's what I desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's not going to happen until the sovereign God sends it. &gt;&gt; I want God to really do a tremendous work in the lives of our young people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd love to see the altar filled every service. &gt;&gt; I'd love to for the shakina to grow come down where I can't even speak. &gt;&gt; I'd love to be slain in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you? &gt;&gt; I'd love to have total my total faculties lost in him. &gt;&gt; I would love that. I'm not afraid of that. I sure hope I'm not. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you love that? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But I'm not going to make it happen and I can't make it happen. &gt;&gt; So, it takes a sovereign God to do it. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet of God really lays a high standard for us believers. And he does it in this message, the power uh that day at Calvary. And and I'll read a portion of that. The same the same Jesus tonight, 1955. And the prophet of God says this, and we'll play a portion of this for you just before we go to prayer. I'm I'm just about done. I'm just going to read a couple quotes. That was what was on my heart to to to share with you. A sovereign move of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um that word sovereign means it's a supreme. It means independent. It means um it's subject to its own laws only. He's the sovereign God. He doesn't have to ask for anyone's permission. And when he decides to do it, there's nobody that can say no. That's the God. That's the move I'm talking about. And when God decides to bless you, there's nobody can stop that. &gt;&gt; When God decides to anoint you, there's nobody that can stop that. &gt;&gt; When God decides to send his Holy Spirit amongst a group of people, there is nobody, no man, no devil that can stop it. And that's the move that I want. &gt;&gt; And that's not only the move that I want. That's actually the move that we need. Every one of us need that. &gt;&gt; Without that, it was just intellectual. We're just arguing. We just our points. And without a supernatural &gt;&gt; God coming down, making it real to you, &gt;&gt; it's just dad telling us his dad ways &gt;&gt; and and mom and dad is just, you know, church again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We heard those quotes. Yeah. That's all it is. But when there's a, you know, when it's a real fire, it's different than a painted fire. &gt;&gt; When it's a when that when that picture of the pillar of fire, thank God for it. But when that when that pillar that picture of the pillar of fire actually comes off the picture and comes down and drops in somebody's life, &gt;&gt; can't nobody stop it. &gt;&gt; Can't nobody stop it. &gt;&gt; That's the move [applause] that this church needs. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what you need. That's what I need. And without it, &gt;&gt; just just like any other group, &gt;&gt; any other group. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God says this here, paragraph 128 in that day at Calvary. Little while the world won't see me no more, yet you'll see me. I'll be with you, even in you to the end of the world. I'll not leave you comfortless. I'll pray the father. He'll send you another comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the world cannot receive. Yet you can receive him. Now notice the greater works was to have the power in the church. Not only to heal the sick by prayer, cast out devils by prayer, but to impart eternal life to believers. The Holy Ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impart life. Oh, that's what Calvary meant. It took stooped, degraded men and women, lifted them into a place to be sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To heal the sick, to impart eternal life by the giving of the Holy Ghost to obedient believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Men who were once unbelievers be made believers &gt;&gt; and impart spiritual eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 131. Poor blind wretched people. How do they miss that? Don't see what the great Don't you see what the greater thing is? That's the greatest thing that could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people. What is eternal life? the life that he lived, the life that was in him, impart that to others. Can a man do that? A son of God can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Whosoever sins you remit, to them they are remitted. Whosoever sins you retain, to them they are retained." Oh my. That really sets the bar pretty high to me. what the son of god can do. Now I want to play that part here but let me read this in the same Jesus tonight 1955. Brother Brandham says this in paragraph number three he says now something's got to happen. It's just like cogs moving together. When the right time comes every cog will take its place. There's a woman with a desire in her heart, with faith in who he was, standing by the fountain of life, recognizing no matter what the past was in his presence again. Hallelujah. There she is. Whatever you ask God, God will give it thee. &gt;&gt; That turned his great heart. &gt;&gt; He looked at her. Rise again. She said, "Yeah, Lord, I know he was a good boy. He'll rise again in the general resurrection. Those Jews believed in the resurrection. He'll rise someday in the last days in the resurrection. Listen to the only man that ever lived. Listen, the only man that ever lived that could make this statement. The Bible said he wasn't much to look at. Probably a little frail looking person. I can see him straighten his little frame up and make this statement. I am the resurrection and life. Never a man could say that. nor afterwards will there ever be. I am the resurrection and life. He that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Oh, how that thrills my heart to know what with with certainty that now we have everlasting life. &gt;&gt; Names written in the lamb's book of heaven. &gt;&gt; There's a grave laying yonder, the body in its all molded. The first thing falls in on the body is the nose. Skin worms is going in and out. Brokenhearted sister. But Marthur standing by the fountain of life had um fountain of life had hear that word. Oh, I love it. Let me tell you, she must believe for the impossible. Then that's what you've got to do. You've got to believe the impossible in order to have new life. &gt;&gt; Let me also say this at God as God's servant because I know from what I speak the impossibles are made real when God has took at his word. &gt;&gt; When any person will take the same word, it'll bring the same results every time, &gt;&gt; every time you ask it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God for his word. Tonight I want to play this portion of the tape. I think it's 5 minutes or three or so from paragraph 126 to 140 and that day at Calvary. I know it would be a blessing to you. They prepare to get that for me. And Amen. Jesus thanked the father hid it from the educated and shrewd and wise and prudent and would reveal it to babes such as would come to Calvary. &gt;&gt; Now watch Jesus said, WATCH HOW HE STATED IT. THE WORKS THAT I DO, he's doing them right now. &gt;&gt; The works that I'm DOING NOW, HEALING THE SICK, raising the dead, OPENING THE EYES OF THE BLIND, THESE WORKS SHALL YOU DO ALSO. YES, &gt;&gt; you will do these. If you believe in me, you do these works, AND THAT ARE GREATER THAN THIS SHALL YOU DO. &gt;&gt; FOR I GO TO MY father a little while, and the world won't see me no more. Yet you'll see me. &gt;&gt; I'll be with you, even in you, &gt;&gt; to the end of the world. &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. I'll pray the Father. HE'LL SEND YOU ANOTHER COMFORTER which is the Holy Ghost WHOM THE WORLD CANNOT RECEIVE. YET YOU CAN RECEIVE HIM. &gt;&gt; NOW NOTICE THE GREATER works was TO HAVE THE [screaming] POWER IN THE CHURCH NOT ONLY TO HEAL THE SICK BY PRAYER, CAST OUT DEVILS [screaming] BY PRAYER, BUT TO IMPART ETERNAL LIFE TO BELIEVERS. &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST WAS COMING. and give it into the hands of the church &gt;&gt; to impart life. &gt;&gt; Praise his name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT CALVARY MEANT. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; THAT TOUCHED STOOP, DEGRADED MEN AND WOMEN, AND LIFTED THEM INTO A PLACE TO BE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD, &gt;&gt; TO HEAL THE SICK. &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. AND TO IMPART ETERNAL life &gt;&gt; like giving the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; to obedient believers. Men who were once unbelievers be made believers and IMPART SPIRITUAL ETERNAL LIFE. HOW MUCH greater is it to say this sick woman here I can pray a prayer of faith and she'll be healed. That's a great thing. That's what HE WAS DOING THEN SAID GREATER THAN THIS SHALL YOU DO. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give YOU POWER &gt;&gt; not only to raise HIM UP FOR A WHILE, BUT TO GIVE HIM ETERNAL LIFE, &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'LL BE ETERNAL FOREVER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; POOR, BLIND, wretched people. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; How do you miss that? &gt;&gt; Don't you see what the greater thing is? &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE GREATEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; WAS TO IMPART ETERNAL LIFE TO PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; What is the eternal life? the life that he lived, the life that was in him. &gt;&gt; Impart that to others. &gt;&gt; Can a man do that? A son of God can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Whosoever sins you remit to them, they are remitted." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whosoever sin you retain to them, they are retained. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, here's where the Catholic Church and many others made their big mistake. They go out and say, "I'll forgive your sins." That wasn't it. How did they get sins forgiven in the Bible? Peter answered that question on the day of Pentecost. THEY SAID, "WHAT CAN WE DO TO BE SAVED? &gt;&gt; HOW CAN WE GET THIS THAT YOU ALL GOT?" &gt;&gt; He laid down the prescription. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; HE TOLD HIM WHAT TO DO. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "REPENT EVERY ONE OF YOU TOWARDS GOD AND BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; FOR THE REMISSION OF YOUR SINS. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A GREATER WORKS. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY OF YOU PREACHERS THIS MORNING? &gt;&gt; HOW MANY OF YOU LISTEN TO MY WORD ON MAGNETIC TAPE ARE WILLING TO GO TO CALVARY THIS MORNING? &gt;&gt; LOOK WHAT GOD DID THERE FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND FORSAKE YOUR DENOMINATIONAL CREED AND PREACH THE GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; IT'S IN YOUR LAP NOW. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH IT? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THANK YOU, LORD. FOR REPENTANCE AND REMISSION OF SINS MUST BE PREACHED IN HIS NAME TO ALL THE WORLD, BEGINNING AT JERUSALEM. HALLELUJAH. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; What does CALVARY MEAN TO YOU? WHAT THAT DAY DO TO YOU? &gt;&gt; DO STUFF YOU OUT WITH SOME THEOLOGY? &gt;&gt; Did it MAKE YOU A STUFFED SHIRT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OR DID IT MAKE YOU A CHRISTIAN SOLD OUT? HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Greater works than this shall ye do. &gt;&gt; You see who the ye are, don't you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Greater works than this. &gt;&gt; Remitting sins &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ, but through creeds and denominations and SO FORTH, IT'S BOUND YOU DOWN TO A PLACE YOU'RE STILL SERVING THE WORLD. YES. &gt;&gt; Tell me any man. TELL ME ANY WOMAN CAN COME TO CALVARY AND TRY TO BE A BIG SOMEBODY BECAUSE SOMEBODY said something. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; TELL ME WHERE YOU CAN LOOK IN THE FACE OF CALVARY IN ITS RIGHT LIFE THAT DAY IN CALVARY. HOW CAN YOU HAVE YOUR DAY ON CALVARY COME OUT OF STUFF SHIRT? &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU COME OUT A PUPPET FOR SOME ORGANIZATION AND PREACH SOME MAN-MADE DOCTRINES? &gt;&gt; GOD, &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T IT HUMBLE YOU TO THE WORD OF GOD? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. If you ever go there, you'll come out humble. &gt;&gt; Yes, you will. &gt;&gt; How can you want to be some big SOMETHING IN YOUR ORGANIZATION WITH A FEATHER IN YOUR HAT WHEN JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD, HUMBLED HIMSELF TO A HACKED UP BODY, TO A SPITTED FACE &gt;&gt; UNTIL SHAME AND DISGRACE AND THEY STRIPPED HIS CLOTHES OFF AND CRUCIFIED HIM before the world, &gt;&gt; despising the shame? &gt;&gt; How can you go to Calvary and come away anything different than what he was? A disgrace, a shame. [clears throat] Or you say to kick me out, let them kick. Praise the Lord. We thank God for his word tonight. Amen. So, that was just a few things I had up on my heart and I really was impressed to to bring that before you that if there was any prayer, any desire that you had, um I think it should be that for God to have a sovereign move, a sovereign work in your life. what Calvary did for you that day at Calvary will produce the same works that Jesus did. And he said greater works than these. Greater. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's my desire. I bless you saints. Um we have a few prayer requests that we want to go to. Brother, let's see. Remember brother Kim Dingwall's mother-in-law for a health need. They're there in Manitoba. I believe they're have to travel there.

Sister Troutman, Sister Ellie Troutman had something issues with her back and wanted to pray for her that the Lord will touch her and heal her. Someone else over here. Sister Brother, I thought someone said something over there. No. All right. We announced that Brother Bill Lingard would be here Sunday, but he won't he won't be here. We're going to postpone that.
