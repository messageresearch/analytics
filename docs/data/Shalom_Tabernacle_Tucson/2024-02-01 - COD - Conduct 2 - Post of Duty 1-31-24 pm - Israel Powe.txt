these blessings in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you Saints so good to be in the house of the Lord with you this evening we like to welcome you all to the house of the Lord so good to see brother Dan sister Vicky there tonight and each of you amen amen God bless you richly we' like to go right into the word in um Hebrews chapter 2 is where we'll take our scripture we started last Wednesday on conduct order and Doctrine we'll call it the C but um we're still under the conduct portion and we're going to deal with the uh the post of Duty we'll call that we'll put that under conduct also the way we dress our attitude that's probably under conduct but we won't get into that tonight but just to go um uh little by little step by step for the next few Wednesday Services until we get through the portion that we' like to get to but in Hebrews chapter 2 the word of God says this here verses number one 2 and three therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received the just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him amen so we'll pray God's blessing on the reading of his word you may be seated uh tonight um as we started last week Wednesday and uh as under the beginnings there in Luke chapter 14 our lord Jesus is there uh admonishing his disciples as they began to follow him in discipleship and he says he that is not able or willing to hate his father his mother his wife his children his Brethren and his sisters and even his own life for my sake so the preparation that our Lord is giving his disciples that um not that of course not that we should hate our mother fathers and our families and hate our own life but he's bringing the comparison as to what a life of service to the Lord is and how we come to him and I strongly believe and I failed to do this many times but it's a really good question to ask those Believers that want to come to Christ are you willing to give your life for this because the True Believers um throughout all of the ages had to and that brings the serious the the severity of what you're doing when you take a stand for the Lord Jesus and when you want to come to serve him it's there not that Hollywood version that you might see it's not the great television evangelist version that you might see but this is really a serious commitment that one makes and Jesus said you count up the cost what man B purchases a field without first trying that field who's going to purchase an animal without first trying the animal and so the cost needs to be tallied up and that's not to scare anyone but that just brings the seriousness as we are are making our decision to follow him so that's the beginning of our Christian journey in the Great Commission Mark chapter 16 our lord Jesus tells tells us what the Great Commission is how every believer is commissioned to go and tell go and teach All Nations and go and be a witness of me go and preach the gospel to Every Creature now this commission is not just to preachers who preach this is not just to old people this is not just for young people these are for Christians this great Comm Mission and it'll always be until Jesus comes we see the door closing for the Gentiles and the purpose of this set of study or this set of messages is that I believe that the Lord wants to raise up pillars in the house of the Lord that the local Fellowship where you worship God you know every church has them we have those Believers that you can count on them they're going to be there on Wednesday and Sunday services and then we have those Believers that maybe they come and go and so um and every church has them we have our what we call our Wednesday night crowd our prayer meeting crowd our Sunday morning crowd and every group over the years I've seen them and so you have this uh this Dynamic of coming to the house of the Lord well well the scripture tells us in Hebrews uh chapter 10 I believe we read it for you last time to not forsake the assembling of yourselves together but even more as you see that day approaching what does that word forsake mean that means to abandon or to give up and you can literally get into the habit of missing the Gathering time that the Believers have have called to gather together and one of the things I'd like to ask our ourselves as a local Fellowship because that's what we represent we represent the Lord Jesus Christ in this community and if this church was to leave from this community would it even miss us would there be a vacancy here would the would the neighbors here even know that there was a group of Believers here a place that they could come and find rest for their souls to be prayed for if they needed it spiritual needs we all know where McDonald's is we all know where the fast food and we know where to get gas where can we get God at in this neighborhood and you'll be surprised at the people that claim their little Neighborhood Church as their local Fellowship I was sharing this with with some of the Believers there in Phoenix and I think I shared it here too during the time of covid when you know we we had the challenges that all the churches had and I believe it was on one Sunday morning that we had um canceled our service here and I went to go preach for brother Osorio that Sunday morning I believe that was the only service I can't remember the exact date but it any rate that Sunday morning there there at brother uh Isaac osorio's church I Was preparing to to preach the sermon and getting my notes together and someone just kept calling my phone and calling my phone blowing my phone up really and I was like who is this calling me on the Sunday morning so I finally answered the phone and it was one of Doug's friends the homeless guy Doug we say he's homeless but he's not homeless we just that's how we identify him he's got a home but he looks homeless and he's okay with it so we all know who I'm talking about Doug Doug what's his name Doug Wilson okay and so we call him homeless but he's not homeless well it was one of his friends calling me outside our church door there she said where's everybody at I said you know what we cancel service she said why now for her this was her church for that Sunday morning and she was counting on depending on us to be here and that really gave me another whole another perspective and I said you know I'm sorry will we cancel the service we're at another location says are you coming back yeah we'll be back don't worry and it almost brought tears to my eyes and the impact of what the little Neighborhood Church is and I was sharing this with some of the brothers and brother dingwall he uh I think I said that right brother dingwall I shared that and he said that when they had decided I forget which group he was with when they decided to move from the neighborhood that their church had grew up into to go go purchase a piece of property and leave when they put the announcement out that they were leaving he said the neighborhood people came crying and weeping begging them not to go people that you won't never you you won't normally see maybe and so you know there's people that claim this to be their church and they claim that this is their home church and maybe we don't even know them or see them but that's on us we said we're going to be here and when we come to gather in his name you know that's just not for the preachers that's not just the board members that's like for every believer we agree to gather in his name on Sunday morning Sunday night and Wednesday night deal deal and so as Believers of the church there's no part-time Believers right am I getting that wrong or is that right and so some of us and I know some Believers have the attitude that you know if I'm a little tired I'll be there if not what if the janitor had that attitude what if the pastor had that attitude what if we what if I came here when I just felt so great and felt so good about being here I mean it's the weather my bones are aching man I can catch up on some sleep it's Wednesday night I know some of y'all going to be here so I'm going to be here and I believe the the M the Believers that's their attitude why the Bible tells us not to forsake ourselves and the scripture tells us that Jesus Promised where two or three are gathered in my name he says I will be in the midst who who wants to miss that who wants to miss that opportunity so we're going to go through this just a little bit and this Hebrews chapter 2 veres 1 and 3 and the things that we're talking about tonight they're not deep they're not things that you know talented people have to know or people who are gifted who can sing or who can preach or who have talents beyond measure we're just talking about uh faithful people faithfulness and this is where where this Hebrews 2 1-3 speaks of that that we need to give heed L one of these things slip from us and so we're just going to bring a few of those things here for you tonight now first of all this word omit brother manam deals with it and he calls it the sin of omission and it means to leave out or to exclude it's either either intentionally or forgetfully um it means to leave off it means to fail to do to fail to continue and brother Ram deals with this failure this Omission this sin of om omission and brother he he deals with this in blind bmus 1960 paragraph number 24 he says you know as a servant of God you ought to watch what you're doing because your written Epistles read of all men you Christians always be willing to lend a hand or to do something to help somebody make life a little more pleasant for them as they're well I don't have any gift of healing you don't have to have at least offer something offer a prayer do something make them feel do the best you can by them anyhow never turn a shoulder a cold shoulder to anyone no matter what it is even if they've mistreated you do it anyhow if you can't do it from your heart then you ought to come to the Altar and stay till that Spirit comes in you that from your heart you can love those who doesn't love you that's when God will answer your prayer for as long as there anything in your heart if I conceive iniquity in my heart then God will not hear me that's what David said that's true he won't hear you the prophet of God continues on and door to the heart he said that's a beautiful thought did you know I don't think I gave you the assist but I'll read it anyways did you know all great things has to pass through the critics God's blessed church has to go through the critics critics and stand the criticism before can be took to the hall of God's Immortal Fame the scripture says all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution so if you're not persecuted for righteousness sake not something you brought on yourself but for righteousness sake there's something wrong somewhere brother bam continues on the message the blushing Prophet paragraph 19 98 many of you here who has professed Christianity for a long time and know that you have failed to tow the line with God know that you're doing things right now that you ought not to do and you're going unconfessed them just Loosely floating along with the tide looking at the kind of programs you should not look at look at the kind of magazines and reading the literature that that you should not read it's not BEC coming to Christians listening to jokes of V vow and dirt and smut that you know you shouldn't do both men and women you know of places where you could have spoke and did not do it and your guilty maybe the sin of omission and the message super sign n uh 1959 perig at 50 Prophet says this do you understand that it's the little things that you pass over and old me that means so much to God can the church conceive that this morning and our achievement as an organization and his great buildings and and we're omitting the little things that means so much to God and so much to our Eternal destination we omit those things I think sometimes we I think sometimes we look at the great big things and the big Monumental things that get the credit and the the stage and the lights and all of the Fanfare but the faithfulness of being uh committed to a post of Duty I believe that's important to God I believe it's in the word of God for a reason I believe he told us that we should Gather in his name and he would be in our midst and then that we should not forsake that we should really take that very very very deeply we know the scripture or Jesus says and many of us we we use the scripture as it pertains to work that my Ox was in the ditch well this entire age has placed the ox in the ditch if you let it it's just a busy age I mean there everything is 24 hours more things are open on Sundays than ever before and it used to be Sunday was God's day and even many of our chores and things that we do have spilled over on Sunday in between services and we've gotten caught up into that rat race but that really Belongs to the Lord but then the prophet added and the Christian church at least in this country added the Wednesday night prayer meeting or the weekday service service and I want someone to show me where brother brandham minimized that service he never did now we know Sunday Belongs to the Lord and it's it's the equivalent of the the the Hebrews Sabbath day and that Sabbath day from sun down to Sun up Sundown Friday night to to Sun up the next uh I'm not getting my time here straight but it it's not starting Saturday morning when you see the sunrise and when you prepare to go to church on Sunday morning that actually starts on Saturday it really should because you're preparing for what's going to come tomorrow so you get everything all the work and all the pressure and all the toys you try to lay all of that out on Saturday so Sunday is the day of worship it's a holy day the age has made it not holy but God rose on that day and brother Brandon made it very clear that he believed that it was a sin now I want you to think about that it was a sin to hunt to fish or to work on Sunday if you could have gone to church that's a quote if I I might get to it tonight I'm not sure but but it still it shows the importance of it now who who in the Age is telling you that that not not Walmart surely not and not the shopping industry surely not and not the rat race that we live in surely not but Sunday Belongs to the Lord It's a holy day for us Believers and it's not a flip it's not a halfway it is deliberately a day for the Lord I'm coming to meet with the Lord and the Brethren and I have a little local Fellowship that I'm accountable to I'm accountable to the young people in that church even though they're not my children I'm accountable to the elders in that church even though they're not related to Me In by Blood I'm accountable to the youth I'm accountable to every brother every sister that would need prayer or need my time or need my touch or just need needs to see my face I'm accountable there people depending on you amen and this age has tried to take that away from us but thank God for his word and for the reminders in his word amen in the paragraph number 30 in the message hear ye him sometimes it's the little things that we omit that spoils our our great faith we'll see a little something come up the weather's too hot they got too tired this or some little thing like that that you'll omit coming to the meeting again or maybe somebody got out of order or something went wrong or something and then that right there is where you fell see but you see faith is so positive it never you can't hinder Faith no matter what it is you're going to do it anyhow no matter what anybody else does if you believe it you're going to stay with it because faith has no hindrance you might have a lot but your faith doesn't so it'll stay just stay right with it amen praise the Lorden so let's go a little bit further the message 1948 experiences brother brandham says this in paragraph number four I like this one you know and that one we just read there you see something out of order just a little bit and then sometimes you'll you'll admit because the weather's too hot or you get too tired and you'll omit from coming now we're not talking about you that have a reason that you can't come we're talking about you're forsaking it when you can come but you don't come and and as I said on last week Wednesday when we put the stream service together there is it's not to substitute Hebrews chapter 10 that's not a substitute is it's not to make the the church service more convenient because all the Believers are going to be there I could be there but I you know I kind of just feel like I'm gonna stay home let me pop on the stream I'll get the service anyway that's not what the service is for service for for for those that can't come we have some Elders some people that's in their 90s they can't come some people that are sick or weak in their body they can't come some people that have their Ox in the ditch they're working whatever the case may be they can't come but then you have the group that can come but they choose not to come that stream service is not for it's not for that I believe that there's a commitment and there's an effort made to come when those doors are open is the way the prophet of God told us all right and now and like I said last time this message maybe for the people that need to hear it or not here anyways but tell them to go get the message all right tell them they need to hear it all right encourage them in a nice Gentle Way right okay don't say well you need to hear this just say you know where were you we miss you might want to hear so all right is that okay all right experiences 1948 and you people who have little churches here who's struggling my advice would be for you to stand at your post of Duty just as loyal as you can to the cause of Christ and back up your minister and everything that's that's that's going on for the cause of Christ and do that and God will bless you the only way that you can respect God is to respect one another is that right so you know I like that because you know when you have little things in the church is struggling well that's kind of like you know that's sometimes people feel like well I'll I'll come when you guys get things put together properly when the church stops struggling then I'll come I'll show up well actually we need you here when the church is struggling and is trying to find its way you don't leave when things are are struggling that's when the church needs you you know you you're not just coming to the church to receive from God you're actually coming to give Christianity is living for others we have we we need your voice in The Ensemble we need to hear your voice in the chorus portion of the song service it's not the song leader up here leading a song special solo but we want to hear your voice even Out Of Tune even if you can't sing that word we want to hear you we want to hear your broken vocal cords we want your tired praise we want that worship after work the midweek praise worship after work hard day demons Devils attacking against you bring that on to the house of the Lord that's that's a flavor my that's homecooked flavorings that you just can't get anywhere else tired back ache could have stayed home but decided to press my way out out anyhow and if somebody a sinner comes in here to be prayed for we need your hand on that Sinner's life to pray them through this neighborhood needs that it needs you not just the pastor not just the ministers not just the ones we know are going to be here we're talking about you that are on the fence God is calling for God soldiers and pillars amen and that starts right here amen it looks simple it looks uneventful you're just pressing your way coming to the house of Lord you don't know what can we we've had some strange characters come in here for prayer haven't we we have some people come in here we never seen them before they come up and they need prayer who's supposed to pray for them what the church down the street or the other church over there no this one right here amen amen so when things are struggling my advice would be for you to stand at your post of Duty God's provided way of healing brother brandom says this here father we pray that every Christian will take his post of Duty get on the telephone call others do everything you can go out in the country dragging them from the hedges and high ways and byways the lame halt blind which was the last call that Jesus said would be before the coming the great supper when was the last time some of y'all dragged someone to church like the songwriters say my mother drugg me drugg me to Sunday school drug me to church and he says I'm so glad mama and daddy drugged me he's talking about being Dr drugged but the drugs his parents had him on they drugg him to church and brother Ram is talking about going in the hedges in the highways and getting on the phone and dragging them to church Lord help me put my gloves on and grab somebody by the collar and drag them to church you strong enough you can do it right don't look at me like that Saints make this Valley full of ditches here what the prophet of God says here paragraph number 51 brother brandom I don't do nothing maybe that's what's the matter that's the trouble of it it's more sin not to do than it is to do when you know better that's right he know he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it's sin you got to make ready doing nothing is the worst thing you can do do nothing about it you Southerners remember your history went up here when Grant was setting just across the river he had a boy out there on guard Duty and the rebels was across the river and this boy walking along there kind of Dazed around with the dreams of his sweetheart he left his post of Duty and went down to pick some violets to send to his sweetheart he didn't mean to do wrong he went then at the time there was a spy ready from the southern Army and they slipped in and they looked around and they found out that the southern Army was two or three times the size of General Grant well what happened the boy come back on the post of Duty not knowing what had happened but the Spy had already been there and what happened they stormed across the river and drove them Plum back up into the the state and that boy was shot in an hour later not because they didn't have no objection to him picking the violets they didn't have it wasn't what he done it was the things he didn't do he didn't stand to his post of Duty he didn't guard the post like it was like he was supposed to and he spoiled the whole thing and that responsibility tonight lays at the Life Tabernacle and other Tabernacle and churches in streetport Louisiana God is here taking with the storm it ain't what you're doing than it is what you're failing to do let's do something about it let's dig with all of our hearts that when the day of judgments comes we can say God I did the very best I could and you know I did amen when we know what we can do that's all expected when we know what we can do that's all that's that's alls expected amen this is in the message Church order we listen to this couple of weeks ago paragraph 65 and may the Holy Spirit watch over each one of you and may every officer of the church fill his post of Duty knowing this that God is going to hold you responsible for how you held your office in the church each one will have to give an account and the message adoption number one 1960 brother randam says this may we tonight see this Lord plainly as it is given to us in the word give us understanding and place us Lord at our post of Duty that we might serve Faithfully until you come we ask this in jesus' name for his sake amen yes so it's the little things that we leave undone let's turn to Matthew chapter 25 just for a moment there's a a pertinent uh Parable there Matthew 25:14 for the Kingdom of Heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods and unto one he gave five talents to another two and to another one to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents and likewise he that had received two he also gained other two but he that received one went and digged into the Earth and hid his Lord's money after a long time the Lord of those servants cometh and reckon with them and so he that had received five talents come and brought other five talents saying Lord thou deliver unto me five talents behold I have gained besides them five talents more his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy Lord he also that received two talents came and said Lord excuse me thou Deliver Us unto me two talents behold I have gained two other talents besid besides them his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things read it with me enter thou into the joy of thy Lord look at verse 24 then he which have received the one Talent came and said Lord I knew thee that thou art a hard man reefing where thou has not sown Gathering where thou has not straw and I was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth and lo there thou Hast that is thine his Lord answered and said unto him thou Wicked and what what slothful servant thou knowest that I reap where I sow not and gather where I not straw thou ought to us therefore to have put my money to exchangers and then at my coming I should have received my own with Usery take for the talent from him and give it unto him which hath 10 talents for unto everyone that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer Darkness there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth now this is a parable of our Lord Jesus the loving Lord Jesus and he's given this Parable showing that we all don't receive the same talents gifts and there's other people that have salvation that don't know anything about this picture right here or the seventh seal and maybe would say they have one Talent or two but we the bride of Christ have have been given not because of our own goodness not because we're smarter than anyone else but we have been given the greatest treasure that any Bible believing Christian could ever be given and that's a prophetic insight into the mysteries of God we have the mind of the Lord on these great issues that many many they don't have a clue on and that shouldn't boast us that shouldn't make us feel better that should really just make us feel so much more responsible amen if any of the other preachers from any other age could change or trade places with me I wonder if they would live the the message or live the the life that I'm living today or would they really be on fire for the Lord if the Believers in other ages could trade places with you and look at the opportunities that we have whereas Even In This Very age when the message come we would have to you know we'd have to get take a tape and then find a tape recorder to even play it so that would be in a car or a little Walkman device or at home but now it's we we've moved move that aside now we can listen to the message so frequently and and with a clean you know just a clean hearing audio is just great we can we can do it in the privacy of our home and it basically in American dollars it didn't cost us anything I mean when you look at the price of it it was it was free and and you know God has really been good to us and he is but this is our Lord his attitude was you know at least you could have tried to take my talent a a and and try to develop it in a different way at least you could have and he was not happy with that servant his excuse didn't fly it wasn't it wasn't enough for for him to know that Lord we know that you're heart we know that you you know and I and I was afraid no excuses for that you should have at least and Look What the Lord says bind him and where there will be this great weeping bind him and cast him in the outer dark darkness seemed like that's pretty harsh huh he went from giving us something to work with and now he's upset that I didn't even do anything with what he gave me well that's our Lord he makes us responsible for the things that he give us faithful being faithful is not the most talented or gifted it's not the most decorated or flashy faithfulness is not seeing but observed a quality detected by observation Proverbs 20:6 says most men will Proclaim everyone his own goodness but a faithful man who can find Matthew 2444 says therefore be ye also ready for such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meet and due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing when Desert Storm hit it was in 1991 or 92 or so a lot of my friends made a big turn towards the Lord remember when 911 hit 911 hit the church churches were filled up and all these catastrophes hit and people start trying to come and get right with the Lord but a faithful servant is going to be faithful to their post of Duty no matter what day of the week no matter what time no matter what's going on he's going to be faithful how many message people would come to church tonight if they knew this was indeed their last Wednesday night service well Lord if you would have told me it was my last one I would have came well you made the choice not to come and it's different if you couldn't come then you just couldn't come that's different it's more of an attitude but you could have come and you decided not to come well that's I I wouldn't call that a faithful servant I wouldn't okay I like the way brother Brandon puts this as I pray to W wrap this up here they asked brother bam this question and uh it it's in uh questions in answers 19 63 and it brings the perfect balance should evangelist continue on the field question they asked brother brandom it's like you know they maybe maybe we should stop preaching or should evangelist continue on the field it's a it's a powerful question they really gives the Insight of where the people's thinking are you know if I was in that crowd I'd be like who asked that like what do you mean should have what you what are y'all talking about should what did he say you know but I'm glad the question was asked because we needed to hear this question and we needed the answer for it today yes sir in this hour of course what they mean certainly by all means don't change a thing if Jesus is coming in the morning Preach Today like if it was going to be 10 years from today but live like it's going to be at this hour don't get scrupled up now that's what I'm trying to warn you about see just don't be odd peculiar don't change nothing but if you're doing something wrong or doing evil repent see come back to God continue on your Evangelistic service just as you always did if you're building a house put it on up Jesus comes tomorrow you'll be found faithful at the duty if you're Building a Church go on put it up I'd rather be putting my money in something like that than be found with it in my pocket see so just keep on continue as you are everybody understand now continue right on just go right on as you are just don't stop don't do nothing just go right on just as you are keep on serving the lord now for instance if you was working with Amanda you know it was 15 minutes before quitting time well you say ah just 15 minutes more so I might as well just go over and sit down you'd get docked for that 15 minutes if you're planting wheat plant your wheat you're digging potatoes go on dig them out say well nobody will eat them that don't make any difference dig them out anyhow see yeah just continue on as you are I got a letter from somebody the other day somebody told them and said well the time is at hand sell the farm now you won't need the food you live off of on the farm said cuz the Millennium is going to start and you won't need it so just go ahead and while the tribulation period is going on your children is not safe so just let them let the children have the farm where they where they can where they can eat off of but you sell your farm and something like that and oh they had it I said oh my if I know he was coming tomorrow and I was a farmer I put my crop in today sure if he made me a farmer I'm going to stay right at my duty that's right if he made me a mechanic somebody said the other day a fellow come in and said say brother you know what I'm going to give you the second set of keys he brought a new car so I'm going to give you the second set of keys and told his Pastor I'm going to give you the second set of keys cuz the Rapture might come you know and I won't be in need anymore see the pastor was going to miss it you see oh that's making ready isn't it all right but that's the way it is see we mustn't be that way we must be same solid Christian see that I'm put here to work right up to the last minute I've got a job to do and I'll be right found faithful at the post of Duty if he comes this morning I want to be standing right here in the pull pit you say brother brandom if he was if if he was to come this morning shouldn't we be out there no sir this is my post of Duty I'll be standing right here preaching when he comes saying the same things I am then when he comes I'll just move right on out with him see if I'm hoing potatoes I'll just be hoing away just as hard as I can when he comes I'll just drop the hole and take off remember in the Jubilee year you're hoing with the hoe there's just just keep ho on hoing they know the Jubilee year was maybe 10 minutes more and the trumpet will sound at the Jubilee year they just kept on pitching hay whatever they was doing but when the trumpet sounded then they dropped the Pitchfork and gone see that's it just keep on pitching hay until the trumpet sounds all right so I love that balance that brother uh brandom gives he in one place he talked about the second seal he said if he was going to the it was in the third shelf I knew he was coming tomorrow night tomorrow I would study and ask him to give me the message for the fourth seal and I come down here and preach it just the same see I want to be doing every day just what I would be doing if he comes and I don't know no other better place than to be caught right at the post of Duty see at the post of Duty see so we just keep carrying on till he comes so the Lord reveals us to us our post of Duty we don't want to omit it we don't want it to let it slip we don't want to forsake it because we know that these little things are where is where our faithfulness is measure Jesus said if you're faithful in a few things the little things I'll make you ruler over many and it's these little things that we omit sometimes and we devalue them because maybe our attitude in the age that we live in and my our our message here tonight is just to encourage you to remind you to don't let those things slip praise the Lord I'll read one last quote and I didn't give you this sister but if you can get it for me it's in the message 1963 the way of a true Prophet paragraph number 27 brother brandom says this here so now if you have had to miss work to hear to be with us and pray with us and so forth you have to miss work that's all right just go ahead and miss work but don't you miss church don't you miss church I want I won't make you L enough to miss church but if you do have to miss work once in a while that won't hurt now cuz work that's just your daily bread and you the Lord promised to provide that so but this you must really be sure to come to church you see so brother manam is just encouraging us amen that importance that our Lord will be here to meet us here all right all right so God bless you we don't want to admit any of these things we want to stay faithful all the way to the end praise the Lord these things are important they'll be important to you when they're important to you you you'll internalize them and it be it's because it it is it'll it'll be you doing it not someone making you feel guilty to do it you take these these principles of why we come and what we're doing when we come here and that God is going to meet us here those principles are not going they're not going to change he said he would meet or two or three or gathering in his name there I'll be in the midst even that much more as the day is approaching so God bless you God bless you the musicians come let us pray father we thank you for your word tonight we thank you for the ability to take these things and with the Pure Heart Lord just examine ourselves to see where our hearts are and see what talents you've given to us and am I am I am I forsaking that Lord am I omitting that am I just looking over it is it my attitude kind of um am I approaching it the wrong way Lord or or is this church depending on me is this community depending on me am am I faithful to compelling men to come getting on the phone dragging people to to church as it was and encouraging them Lord to do my part that's what I want to be faithful to do Lord I know that you know we expect the the ministry to be there we expect the deacons and the board members we expect maybe some of the older Saints to be there Lord but father really every believer should internalize and have this burden on their heart oh God I pray that you would Quicken that to us and Lord that you would be blessed and you'll be praised your name be glorified and magnified as our prayer we want to draw closer to you Lord and we know that's that means drawing closer to your word and the actions and our behaviors Lord that are not pleasing to you I pray that you'll help us to to fall in line with your perfect will for our life is our prayer may you grant it father
