[21:07] just 9:30 it's just right now time Billy
[21:11] and I when we got off of the plane in
[21:14] India our last trip there I was looking
[21:16] at a a paper that the brought was
[21:19] written in
[21:21] English and it said the earthquake must
[21:25] be over the birds are coming back then
[21:27] it the
[21:29] details they there something funny
[21:32] happened uh India don't have uh wolen
[21:35] fences like we do they pick up rocks and
[21:38] make their fences and they build all
[21:40] their houses out of rock just place them
[21:42] up there it's warm there around all any
[21:46] where PR in India let's up in the
[21:48] mountains and all down through kolut and
[21:50] things that people just lay on the
[21:51] street starving to death so forth now so
[21:56] uh and they build their house and towers
[21:59] of their house they run the the fence
[22:01] right up here at the side of their house
[22:03] build a tower for their house and a
[22:04] tower maybe where they got their well
[22:06] they dug it for their cattle and things
[22:08] and run their fences around and all at
[22:10] once something begin to happen the
[22:12] little birds you know go into those
[22:14] rocks and they build their nest and
[22:16] raise their young ones and something
[22:18] begin to happen every day when it would
[22:20] get hot all the cattle will come around
[22:23] and stand under the shadow of those
[22:25] walls keep cool and all the little birds
[22:29] live in those places and all of a sudden
[22:32] all them little birds for some unknown
[22:34] reason now you know what we said the
[22:36] other day about little
[22:38] birds some unknown reason they all took
[22:42] off and they went out and didn't come
[22:44] back to their nest they went out in the
[22:47] field and they set in the trees wherever
[22:50] they could get right out on the ground
[22:52] the cattle wouldn't come around the
[22:54] Sheep wouldn't come around they stayed
[22:56] right in the field hugged up against one
[22:58] another it's a good way to do they knew
[23:01] that something was going to happen then
[23:04] all of a sudden an earthquake talk place
[23:06] and shook the walls down the fences down
[23:09] and everything else then the little
[23:11] birds begin to come back didn't come
[23:13] back for 3 or four days then begin to
[23:14] come back they said well the earthquakes
[23:17] must be over now the birds are coming
[23:19] back why don't you believe that the same
[23:24] God that could make them birds and
[23:26] cattle and sheep in the days of Noah go
[23:28] into the ark he's still the same God
[23:31] that can make him fly to
[23:34] safety is that right now let me say
[23:37] something brother there's something
[23:40] fixing to happen and all these big old
[23:43] ecclesiastical walls are going to
[23:44] collapse and go right back over and
[23:47] agree because you're going to do it as
[23:48] certain as I'm standing here there's an
[23:50] image to that Beast it's as certain as
[23:52] I'm standing you're in this nation tuing

[1:02:15] year or so ago or earlier few months ago
[1:02:19] it really changed my attitude towards a
[1:02:21] service you know sometimes a brother
[1:02:24] might be going in the direction I might
[1:02:27] see it that way I might not but I'm
[1:02:29] already there and if the word of God is
[1:02:32] being preached what I do is I say Lord
[1:02:34] there's something in this service for me
[1:02:37] and I believe you're going to give me
[1:02:38] what I have need of it's about my
[1:02:41] attitude it's not about what attitude is
[1:02:43] up here amen so that has helped me to
[1:02:46] serve better and to worship him better
[1:02:48] amen so it's good to see each of you see
[1:02:51] the Hansen's here this this morning got

[1:03:09] the earthquake and that trip and I
[1:03:12] looked over and he was sitting in the
[1:03:13] service and I made mention of it and I
[1:03:17] just assume everybody knows who you are
[1:03:19] brother Glenn but if you could stand to
[1:03:22] your feet just for a moment I hate to do
[1:03:25] that this brother Glenn Muse that's
[1:03:27] brother Doug Muse's brother and he's
[1:03:30] probably going to punch me after the Ser
[1:03:33] doing that give the Lord a hand of
[1:03:35] Praise And I do that because he was an
[1:03:40] eyewitness and I was reading a quote I
[1:03:42] didn't even think about it and then I
[1:03:43] looked I was like brother Glenn were you
[1:03:45] there he was like yeah I was there he's
[1:03:47] in the pictures and so after the service
[1:03:49] someone came up to me and said brother
[1:03:51] Israel there was somebody in our church
[1:03:53] that was in the so being at Sunset I
[1:03:56] said yes so we just take it for granted

[1:04:18] that uh there was many things I was so
[1:04:20] blessed brother George I'm sure that was
[1:04:22] one of the best ones I thought
[1:04:24] me too yeah and brother Josh was there
[1:04:27] and one of the things that one of the
[1:04:29] brothers got up as I'm I'm going to
[1:04:31] introduce brother Bill right now he
[1:04:33] greeted all the preachers and ministers
[1:04:36] and that just really touched my heart
[1:04:38] had he how he recognized that and I
[1:04:41] thought well you know what we really
[1:04:42] should um thank the Lord for the the the
[1:04:47] preachers that they they um they have
[1:04:51] little
[1:04:52] complexes preachers do
[1:04:54] and all of us do actually and so let's
[1:04:57] just say Amen about that all right and
[1:05:00] so I was thinking I how I appreciate our
[1:05:03] brother George who handles the word and
[1:05:06] lives the life and brother Josh and they
[1:05:09] are ministers in our midst brother bonsa
[1:05:11] as well he just was married and he has
[1:05:14] his Affairs to deal with with his wife
[1:05:16] and so we want to always keep them in
[1:05:18] prayer and I was thinking about that I
[1:05:19] should we should pray for them and pray
[1:05:23] for one another and thank the Lord for
[1:05:26] them with double honor actually says the
[1:05:28] scripture so we have a good friend of
[1:05:31] mine brother um Bill lingar he is

[1:13:46] that uh some of the Brethren from uh
[1:13:49] Mesa is is streaming in and if the
[1:13:52] Carpenters happen happened to be
[1:13:53] streaming in this morning I we go way
[1:13:56] back when I first moved to
[1:13:58] Arizona uh I was under the tutorship of
[1:14:01] brother Carpenter and uh I was greener
[1:14:05] than the grass brother but he was
[1:14:08] patient with me and he helped to develop
[1:14:11] me and so I just want to greet all of
[1:14:13] you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:15] we're very happy to be here uh those
[1:14:18] that know my daughter Anna lingar she
[1:14:21] used to live up in Mesa when she was is
[1:14:23] going to the university her now is name
[1:14:25] now is uh Anna Elder she sends her
[1:14:29] greetings all to you so let's open our
[1:14:31] Bibles this morning a very familiar
[1:14:33] scripture Matthew chap 5 and verse 16
[1:14:37] let your light
[1:14:52] shine
[1:15:00] okay let your light so shine before men
[1:15:05] that they may see your good works and
[1:15:07] glorify your father which is in heaven
[1:15:10] to let your light shine the first thing
[1:15:13] you got to do is you got to have the
[1:15:16] light and there's only one light amen
[1:15:19] amen and that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:22] amen and if he's in you and shining
[1:15:25] through you he's going to make his
[1:15:28] written word live that's correct and be
[1:15:31] a
[1:15:32] testimony that he is shining through you
[1:15:35] that's correct amen
[1:15:37] amen and so we want to now turn to 2
[1:15:41] Corinthians
[1:15:43] 5:116 and my question for us this
[1:15:45] morning is when this light shines
[1:15:48] through you what impact does it have on
[1:15:52] others what what's the outcome what's
[1:15:54] the result what's the
[1:15:56] fruit and 2 Corinthians I believe gives
[1:16:00] us the answer 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:16:05] 5 and let's read at verse
[1:16:12] 16 wherefore henceforth know we no man
[1:16:16] after the flesh y though we have known
[1:16:19] Christ after the flesh yet now
[1:16:21] henceforth we know him no more the first
[1:16:24] way you know the Lord Jesus is by his
[1:16:27] blood then after the blood you know him
[1:16:30] by the Holy Ghost you know him by the
[1:16:34] power of the spirit you know him by that
[1:16:36] Spirit making the word
[1:16:40] live exactly in line with the light of
[1:16:43] the hour that's correct amen amen amen
[1:16:46] and so he says here
[1:16:49] uh and all things are of God who has re
[1:16:53] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[1:16:56] and has given to us the ministry of
[1:16:59] reconciliation what did he give
[1:17:01] us the ministry of
[1:17:04] reconciliation correct
[1:17:06] amen now notice verse 19 to wit that God
[1:17:10] was in Christ reconciling the world un
[1:17:13] himself not imputing their trespasses un
[1:17:16] them and has committed unto us the word
[1:17:19] of
[1:17:21] reconciliation now then we are
[1:17:24] ambassadors for Christ amen and though
[1:17:27] God did besee you by us exactly by us
[1:17:32] exactly amen we pray you in Christ Steed
[1:17:37] exactly be ye
[1:17:40] reconciled amen and so God was in the
[1:17:44] Christ reconciling you can you say Amen
[1:17:50] reconciling you to the light yes amen
[1:17:54] now if the light is in you you have the
[1:17:58] ministry of
[1:18:00] reconciliation to reconcile others to
[1:18:03] the light that's correct amen that's
[1:18:06] correct so my subject is the light of
[1:18:10] reconciliation all right do you have a
[1:18:12] need is there somebody that you know
[1:18:14] that needs to be reconciled it may be a
[1:18:17] friend it may be a family whatever the
[1:18:19] barrier is call their name put your
[1:18:23] stand up for them today and we'll just
[1:18:25] pray a simple prayer come on there's got
[1:18:26] to be somebody that you know there's
[1:18:29] barriers there and that's the devil's
[1:18:32] work but you know what your work is
[1:18:35] you're the light of
[1:18:37] reconciliation praise the Lord let us
[1:18:39] pray Heavenly Father we just commit
[1:18:43] these hands and the needs under their
[1:18:45] hands the hearts to you heavenly father
[1:18:48] let us take our position in the army of
[1:18:50] light let us shine this light and pull
[1:18:53] down the strongholds and bring the
[1:18:55] blessings and the honor and the peace
[1:18:58] that you paid for in Jesus name amen you
[1:19:01] may be
[1:19:03] seated GL to his
[1:19:12] name so I I I want to uh I want to speak
[1:19:17] on the light of
[1:19:19] reconciliation and I want to come to
[1:19:21] this main point
[1:19:24] and that is this now I'm going to start
[1:19:26] my timer right
[1:19:28] now
[1:19:30] oops
[1:19:32] okay by his
[1:19:35] cross you become the
[1:19:38] light and by your cross you Shine the
[1:19:43] Light let's say it again by his
[1:19:47] cross I became the light brother
[1:19:50] George by my cross
[1:19:53] I Shine the
[1:19:56] Light
[1:19:57] okay so reconciliation
[1:20:01] means to remove the
[1:20:04] barriers praise God praise God remove
[1:20:07] the barriers the barriers something
[1:20:10] caused a separation between two or more
[1:20:14] persons and so there's a barrier and
[1:20:17] when there's a barrier the relationship
[1:20:20] is not right corre the fellowship is
[1:20:23] broken okay something caused a
[1:20:26] separation correct it may have been an
[1:20:29] attitude it may have been just a word it
[1:20:33] may have been the deed it may have been
[1:20:35] an attitude a word or a
[1:20:37] deed and one of the hardest barriers is
[1:20:41] when I cause a misunderstanding and I
[1:20:44] didn't mean
[1:20:45] to that hurts that hurts and so there's
[1:20:50] you know there's a lot of reasons for
[1:20:51] barriers and we know that Satan is
[1:20:54] behind it all because that's his
[1:20:56] business that's his business and so
[1:20:59] something causes the separation and we
[1:21:02] know that the greatest separation of all
[1:21:05] is the separation between God and man
[1:21:08] and God is the light that's right God
[1:21:11] has symbolized as the Tree of Life the
[1:21:14] bread of life the seed of life the
[1:21:17] Waters of life but what he is he is the
[1:21:21] light of eternal life
[1:21:23] that's what he is in his
[1:21:26] substance okay amen and so we know by
[1:21:31] this
[1:21:32] message that it was blood that caused
[1:21:36] the
[1:21:37] separation it was blood that caused the
[1:21:40] separation of our sinful life and then
[1:21:43] when blood caused the separation it then
[1:21:47] put a barrier and that barrier was the
[1:21:49] life that came through the blood which
[1:21:52] is the life of the devil right Satan
[1:21:55] entered the human race through a sexual
[1:21:59] seed based upon Eve believing the
[1:22:03] LIE is that right and so it's a blood
[1:22:07] it's a blood that caused the separation
[1:22:11] and then by the life of that blood that
[1:22:14] nature we were all born
[1:22:18] with it's a barrier it's a barrier to
[1:22:22] get in
[1:22:23] along some people were more H than
[1:22:25] others I'm just preaching now right some
[1:22:28] people are more hry than others you know
[1:22:31] when I was growing up you know and you
[1:22:34] walking by the hall and me at school if
[1:22:36] you looked at me wrong I'd say what are
[1:22:37] you looking
[1:22:41] at yeah I wasn't born again all right
[1:22:46] okay I wasn't I wasn't born again the
[1:22:49] problem is is that I had a
[1:22:53] complex all all right I had a complex
[1:22:57] and the only way I knew to defend myself
[1:23:00] was to fight that's right that's the way
[1:23:02] I grew up yes sir all right and so but I
[1:23:06] won most of the
[1:23:07] fights because it's not the size of the
[1:23:10] dog it's the it's the fight of the dog
[1:23:12] in the you know and so anyway we find
[1:23:15] out that there's many things that lead
[1:23:17] to a barriers but the Great Barrier was
[1:23:20] the blood that was seed in the human
[1:23:22] race opened the door for Satan right
[1:23:25] amen right amen which means then the
[1:23:28] only way that can reconcile us back that
[1:23:31] can get our relationship back with
[1:23:34] almighty God is by his own blood amen
[1:23:38] his own blood reconciled us his own
[1:23:41] blood removed the barrier of the old
[1:23:43] life get it now remove the barrier over
[1:23:46] the life and then released his life and
[1:23:49] now I got a relationship with my
[1:23:51] heavenly father
[1:23:53] now the Father of Lights is manifesting
[1:23:58] itself in
[1:24:00] me praise the Lord and now I have I have
[1:24:05] a relationship with the father I have
[1:24:08] relationship and a fellowship with the
[1:24:10] father and I also can have a same
[1:24:12] relationship and fellowship with those
[1:24:15] who claim to be a part of this family of
[1:24:19] light are you in the family of light
[1:24:23] then we're kin folks are we not we're
[1:24:25] related am amen
[1:24:37] amen so it was a corrupt seed that Satan
[1:24:42] used to enter the human race but it was
[1:24:45] a royal seed that God used Amen to
[1:24:49] restore our relationship
[1:24:53] with the pillar of fire of the Lord
[1:24:54] Jesus Christ I'm so thankful for it and
[1:24:58] we know that the great symbol of this
[1:25:01] separation was the veil in the old
[1:25:04] Temple it was a it was a it signified
[1:25:07] that man and the light that Pillar of
[1:25:10] Fire that was back behind that
[1:25:13] veil in the old
[1:25:15] Temple it was signifying that man did
[1:25:18] not have a right to enter the presence
[1:25:21] of that light which was eternal life
[1:25:23] that's right that's right he didn't have
[1:25:25] a right right he was a sinner light and
[1:25:28] darkness have no
[1:25:29] fellowship and so that was a very
[1:25:32] classic uh symbol of the
[1:25:36] separation and and uh we know that by
[1:25:39] the atonement right for sin exactly
[1:25:43] right by the atonement for sin and the
[1:25:45] high priest he was symbolizing how that
[1:25:48] someday by Blood amen we're going to be
[1:25:51] able to to go back through the veil and
[1:25:54] stand in the presence of our heavenly
[1:25:56] father Yes amen amen so Paul called this
[1:25:59] the middle wall of partition right and
[1:26:02] that separated man from the presence of
[1:26:06] eternal life right now listen it not
[1:26:09] only separated man from that light but
[1:26:12] it separated man and
[1:26:15] man that Veil separated man and man not
[1:26:19] only God and man but the Jews and the
[1:26:22] Gentiles they had no Fellowship that's
[1:26:25] correct now think about this that's
[1:26:27] correct they had no
[1:26:29] Fellowship see because the Jews thought
[1:26:32] that they were of the right seed they
[1:26:34] were the natural Seed of
[1:26:37] Abraham amen and not only that they had
[1:26:42] circumcision they had the Sabbath day
[1:26:45] they had a special
[1:26:47] diet they had a the feast and they
[1:26:50] worship at the temple and you know what
[1:26:52] what else it was all under the message
[1:26:54] of
[1:26:56] Moses the prophet they had the prophet's
[1:27:03] message and so in their eyes Sir they
[1:27:07] were more righteous all right come on
[1:27:10] now than the Gentiles yes sir there
[1:27:13] there was no basis of of of Fellowship
[1:27:16] they had the their Prophet the messenger
[1:27:18] of the hour and they were looking for
[1:27:21] something by that Prophet yes they were
[1:27:25] looking for the Messiah they were
[1:27:27] looking for the word to be fulfilled and
[1:27:30] when he came right among
[1:27:33] them when the written word became the
[1:27:36] Living Word they were blind to
[1:27:40] it amen amen that's good brother amen
[1:27:46] and so they become
[1:27:49] Sinners hello sure they become
[1:27:53] Sinners a worse sinner than the woman at
[1:27:56] the well a worse sinner than the woman
[1:27:59] taking in adultery they brought to Jesus
[1:28:01] a worse sinner than the woman that was
[1:28:04] washing his feet The Prostitute they
[1:28:06] were religious
[1:28:08] Sinners that's right and we got a lot of
[1:28:10] religious sinners in the message today
[1:28:13] and we're not saying it to rebuke you
[1:28:15] we're saying it to open your
[1:28:19] eyes that's good brother yes sir
[1:28:22] amen it was religious sin now why is
[1:28:26] religious sin so dangerous because it's
[1:28:29] blind to its own
[1:28:31] condition those prostitutes those
[1:28:34] harlots they knew what they were that's
[1:28:37] right they knew what they were but they
[1:28:39] didn't see anything that can reconcile
[1:28:42] them to God until they met this man
[1:28:45] called Jesus amen glory thank you Jesus
[1:28:51] Hallelujah thank you Jesus is there
[1:28:54] anybody else that can say that he saved
[1:28:58] you thank you God

[1:29:11] tells me when to shout tells me when to
[1:29:13] speak tells me when to be quiet it
[1:29:16] controls me right so that's not an
[1:29:19] excuse to be called informal
[1:29:22] cuz brother brandom never taught any
[1:29:24] cold formal religion that's
[1:29:29] Catholicism there's not a one of us amen
[1:29:32] that somebody knocked on your door and
[1:29:35] had a check for a million dollars and
[1:29:37] paid off all your bills that you
[1:29:38] wouldn't be happy and you can buy the
[1:29:41] car you
[1:29:42] want Hallelujah
[1:29:45] yeah yeah you be saying
[1:29:47] hallelujah yeah you be in the door doing
[1:29:50] your own little jig
[1:29:53] that's right so don't sit in the skit of
[1:29:56] the scornful when David is dancing and
[1:29:58] somebody else is rejoicing because God
[1:30:02] has reconciled them amen
[1:30:07] amen praise the Lord I'm way off my
[1:30:10] notes Oh Glory
[1:30:13] Hallelujah
[1:30:16] yeah so then their
[1:30:18] eyes they were following the message
[1:30:22] the prophet Moses and what a mighty
[1:30:25] prophet he was Vindicated by the pillar
[1:30:28] of
[1:30:29] fire but now they're religious Sinners
[1:30:32] and so now Paul comes along he knows
[1:30:35] what that was all about so he says all
[1:30:38] have
[1:30:39] sinned and come short of the glory
[1:30:42] there's none righteous no not a one amen
[1:30:47] we've all come sin and we come short of
[1:30:50] that shakina Glory
[1:30:52] that's behind that
[1:30:54] Veil
[1:30:56] amen so who are
[1:30:58] you what's your
[1:31:00] attitude what's your words what's your
[1:31:10] actions all of sin and come short of the
[1:31:13] glory of the light of his glory
[1:31:17] yeah nevertheless in the old
[1:31:20] Temple God was sh as a shadow of good
[1:31:23] things to
[1:31:25] come and he foreshadowed it by the high
[1:31:28] priest that when he took the blood he
[1:31:32] could go Beyond the
[1:31:34] Veil and he would enter in now but when
[1:31:37] he went beyond the veil he had to do
[1:31:39] something yes he did to be able to stand
[1:31:42] in the presence of the pillar of fire he
[1:31:44] had to sprinkle The Mercy Seat seven
[1:31:47] times with
[1:31:49] blood okay now here's where we're going
[1:31:52] to go just a little deeper okay now
[1:31:55] we're living in the age let me remind
[1:31:58] you the water in this age is not up to
[1:32:00] the ankles neither is it to the knees
[1:32:04] neither is it to the waist it's a River
[1:32:06] of Life and an outpouring of the Holy
[1:32:09] Ghost that the rainbow trout love to
[1:32:12] swim in
[1:32:14] amen amen so we should go deep okay but
[1:32:20] we also understand as p
[1:32:22] and Discerning the flock some sometimes
[1:32:24] the people are here and this brother's
[1:32:26] here the sister's here and we've got to
[1:32:29] adjust yes amen and you have to adjust
[1:32:32] that's part of your maturity excuse me
[1:32:35] is to adjust and to recognize we're not
[1:32:37] all at the same level but if we're all
[1:32:40] born of the light amen it's coming
[1:32:45] up
[1:32:47] amen
[1:32:50] amen
[1:32:58] so in this old Temple he walked in on
[1:33:01] the day of
[1:33:02] atonement and he sprinkled The Mercy
[1:33:04] Seat yes amen now that Mercy Seat was a
[1:33:08] lid over the ark okay because in the ark
[1:33:12] was the law by which God condemned him
[1:33:15] but now listen to this Mercy Seat this
[1:33:18] Mercy Seat was made of
[1:33:20] solid
[1:33:22] gold solid gold this Mercy Seat was
[1:33:26] solid
[1:33:27] gold and it
[1:33:29] forhad that someday gold and blood was
[1:33:34] going to be mingled
[1:33:36] together
[1:33:37] that's yes
[1:33:39] sir
[1:33:41] someday oh GL
[1:33:44] gold and blood was going to be mingled
[1:33:48] together and it was going to make a way
[1:33:51] for me need to stand back in the
[1:33:53] presence of the pillar of
[1:34:01] fire and so he was
[1:34:05] showing right someday gold that's
[1:34:08] correct the deity that's correct of the
[1:34:12] Living Word that's correct
[1:34:14] MDC that Heavenly Dove that could not
[1:34:20] die can you say amen he could not die he
[1:34:24] was eternal but someday that deity that
[1:34:27] gold was going to become flesh as a lamb
[1:34:30] the son of man now whenever I say the
[1:34:34] son of man I am speaking of this man
[1:34:37] right here amen the only man ever born
[1:34:41] of a woman perfect and the only man that
[1:34:44] will ever be born of a woman perfect
[1:34:47] that's correct but he produced a blood
[1:34:50] and a life that can reconcile us back to
[1:34:54] a perfect
[1:34:55] man if you'll walk in the light
[1:35:02] amen so how many want to just stay
[1:35:06] partial how many want to be reconciled
[1:35:08] all the way back yes amen amen amen and
[1:35:13] so why did they bring Jesus
[1:35:16] gold see because why he was deity yes he
[1:35:20] was he was the word made flesh and he
[1:35:24] came in service to make a sacrifice he
[1:35:28] did that could rent The Veil on Calvary
[1:35:32] and then by water blood and spirit
[1:35:35] Hallelujah rent The Veil off your heart
[1:35:38] put the Holy Ghost in make me a
[1:35:41] relationship now I he can call me the
[1:35:43] Father of Lights amen and the father of
[1:35:47] lights and the children of light love to
[1:35:50] fellowship with the Family of
[1:35:52] Light that's right amen now the family
[1:35:57] of light they might wear this brand they
[1:36:00] might wear that brand they might wear
[1:36:02] this brand but let me tell you what they
[1:36:03] have in common they have in common the
[1:36:05] blood tag the token amen the blood tag
[1:36:09] brother mam sent meant that that that
[1:36:12] heer the only way could be on that that
[1:36:15] that that graze out there it had blood
[1:36:18] in it that said it was a heer and the
[1:36:20] Holy Ghost in you tells you the blood
[1:36:24] has been applied amen amen amen amen
[1:36:30] that's the sign the blood has been
[1:36:31] applied and so we find out then that the
[1:36:36] gold of the Living Word yeah the only
[1:36:39] way he could become the bleeding word
[1:36:41] have you ever heard brother RAM use that
[1:36:43] word the only way he could become the
[1:36:45] bleeding word was to be made
[1:36:48] flesh and when he was made flesh and
[1:36:50] hung on Calvary then the blood and the
[1:36:53] gold mingled together and Saul said who
[1:36:56] are you Lord he says I'm Jesus praise
[1:37:00] the Lord what was he now that Pillar of
[1:37:03] Fire that light that white light had now
[1:37:08] become the light of the lamb and out of
[1:37:11] that light was coming a
[1:37:14] rainbow amen a rainbow a covenant amen
[1:37:19] that through seven Church ages amen God
[1:37:23] was gonna make a way for his children to
[1:37:26] walk back into the pillar of
[1:37:30] fire amen amen
[1:37:33] hallelujah glory to God so gold is the
[1:37:38] Living Word to become the bleeding word
[1:37:43] that would make a way to fulfill Jesus's
[1:37:47] promise what was his promise what did he
[1:37:50] say okay
[1:37:51] look this is the hour that these things
[1:37:54] are meant to unfold okay what did he say
[1:37:58] Amen that where I am you'll be you'll be
[1:38:03] also where was he in the pillar of fire

[1:50:32] correct and in the head there's an eye
[1:50:35] and that eye is not my
[1:50:37] position I'll let you figure that out
[1:50:40] okay it's not my that's not my position
[1:50:42] but by that
[1:50:44] eye I begin to see things that the
[1:50:47] church could never see before that's
[1:50:50] right is that right yes amen amen I
[1:50:52] begin to see things in the Bible I begin
[1:50:55] to see things in his own life him
[1:50:59] manifesting what he's
[1:51:02] teaching exactly he's not just teaching
[1:51:05] the stature of a perfect
[1:51:08] man he's manifesting the stature of a
[1:51:11] perfect
[1:51:13] man but you say but brother bam he made
[1:51:16] mistakes he had his wife tell him on the
[1:51:18] phone I'm not here you know and and he
[1:51:21] lost the feeling for the people so what
[1:51:24] amen amen are you going to make
[1:51:27] mistakes do the prophets have like
[1:51:29] passion exactly did they get angry did
[1:51:33] they get upset it's part of the humanity
[1:51:36] but it doesn't stop God's work of
[1:51:39] reconciliation what he starts he
[1:51:42] finishes hallelujah amen amen where was
[1:51:46] that somebody said Hallelujah where was
[1:51:48] that at hallelujah oh oh oh I see you

[1:53:18] Israel
[1:53:27] in John
[1:53:30] 828 Jesus said when you have lifted up
[1:53:33] the son of
[1:53:34] man that was on the cross right then
[1:53:38] you'll know that I am
[1:53:40] he amen Oh Glory that's that's good yeah
[1:53:45] that's the King James version you'll
[1:53:48] know that I am here
[1:53:50] he but the Greek version says when the
[1:53:54] son of man is lifted up you'll know that
[1:53:57] I am Oh Glory there a subtle difference
[1:54:01] isn't it amen you'll know that I am and
[1:54:06] I am was that Pillar of Fire that came
[1:54:09] down in the burning bush and anointed
[1:54:13] Moses I said he anointed Moses to be
[1:54:16] what the light of reconciliation to
[1:54:20] Israel Hallelujah to
[1:54:24] Israel they had a problem they had a
[1:54:27] barrier between them and the promised
[1:54:29] land and it was Pharaoh but he came in
[1:54:32] the power of an amateur God yes he did
[1:54:37] yes he did and he plagued the house of
[1:54:40] Pharaoh Pharaoh saw the plagues amen but
[1:54:44] Israel saw the token the light of
[1:54:47] reconciliation being reflected through
[1:54:51] Moses yes or no amen and they went free
[1:54:55] amen the barrier was removed Let My
[1:54:58] People Go praise the
[1:55:16] Lord Pharaoh experienced the power of
[1:55:19] God
[1:55:20] by the
[1:55:22] plagues Israel experienced it by the
[1:55:25] token he was
[1:55:28] foreshadowing that by the blood of the
[1:55:30] lamb every barrier that Satan put in
[1:55:34] your way will be paid
[1:55:38] for and the life of the holy spirit is
[1:55:41] going to shine through you to make it
[1:55:45] manifest I like that amen I just
[1:55:48] realized that right yeah the blood
[1:55:50] removes the barrier the blood pays for
[1:55:52] it now let the light shine and start
[1:55:55] removing and claiming what he paid for
[1:55:59] if it's sickness faith and
[1:56:04] virtue amen
[1:56:07] amen so that was the first
[1:56:10] Exodus in the second
[1:56:13] Exodus The Great I Am appeared on the
[1:56:15] scene again did he not yes the light
[1:56:19] came down on the Jordan
[1:56:21] River and this time there was a prophet
[1:56:25] like to
[1:56:26] Moses amen it was the Lord Jesus it was
[1:56:30] the son of man and he had the real blood
[1:56:34] of God he had the real blood of the Lamb
[1:56:38] that could rent The Veil amen they Moses
[1:56:41] they put the blood on the door amen his
[1:56:44] blood rent The Veil and opened the door
[1:56:47] back to the light and the life of God
[1:56:50] amen amen and so the token that his
[1:56:53] blood manifested was the earnest of your
[1:56:57] reconciliation exactly amen now take
[1:57:00] that in brother yes amen it was the
[1:57:02] earnest of your
[1:57:04] reconciliation you're born of the light
[1:57:07] to walk in the light how can you walk in
[1:57:09] the light if you're not born in the
[1:57:11] light you can't do it it's just an
[1:57:14] intellectual conception okay then you
[1:57:17] walk in the light what all the way back
[1:57:19] to the pillar of fire yes Amen to be
[1:57:21] placed yes amen all right amen so the
[1:57:26] second Exodus The Great I Am came down
[1:57:29] on the Jordan River to manifest the real
[1:57:33] blood of the Lamb that could rent The
[1:57:36] Veil and remove the barrier of sin in
[1:57:39] our life remove it and not just reflect
[1:57:42] a
[1:57:44] shadow but reflect the token the earnest
[1:57:49] of our
[1:57:50] reconciliation that's what the new birth
[1:57:52] is is the earnest of your reconciliation
[1:57:56] the light has shined in your
[1:57:59] soul okay your fleshly body it's just as
[1:58:03] a cockabur it's just as sinful as it was
[1:58:06] the day you were born it hasn't changed
[1:58:09] it at all but what it does is it has the
[1:58:13] power to bring it subject to the word
[1:58:16] that's correct that's correct amen amen
[1:58:20] that is
[1:58:21] true first
[1:58:23] Exodus was the blood of a natural lamb
[1:58:28] right the second Exodus Jesus came down
[1:58:31] with the light of
[1:58:32] reconciliation by his own blood by his
[1:58:35] own cross and he rent The Veil off of
[1:58:38] our heart the barrier the old man the
[1:58:42] darkness his blood rent that Veil and
[1:58:45] the light Shone in that little seed that
[1:58:48] was laying in in there what was it my
[1:58:51] father had a
[1:58:53] conception amen that light penetrated
[1:58:56] the veil and struck that seed and there
[1:58:59] was a
[1:59:00] conception now there's a relationship
[1:59:03] now there's
[1:59:05] fellowship with my heavenly father amen
[1:59:09] by his word praise the Lord amen now in
[1:59:13] the Third
[1:59:14] Exodus we are privileged to be living in
[1:59:17] the Third Exodus and three is the number
[1:59:20] of perfection so in this Exodus you and
[1:59:24] I have the opportunity to be made
[1:59:28] perfect we weren't born perfect but we
[1:59:32] can be made perfect amen and when we're
[1:59:36] made perfect Jesus Christ is glorified
[1:59:40] in
[1:59:41] us why would he be glorified in us well
[1:59:45] who made you perfect whose light are you
[1:59:48] shining right
[1:59:49] amen how did that body get to be his
[1:59:51] glorious body that's right amen when
[1:59:54] this body is changed you know that
[1:59:56] that's what symbolizes crowning him king
[1:59:59] of kings and Lord of
[2:00:01] lords that's exactly what it is because
[2:00:04] it's his life in you has come to
[2:00:07] maturity and the power of that creative
[2:00:10] spoken
[2:00:11] word amen
[2:00:14] amen that's the age we're living in I
[2:00:17] look for it every day
[2:00:19] I believe it you know Sarah she had hard
[2:00:23] time with it but Abraham was sitting in
[2:00:26] a different place he was sitting in the
[2:00:27] door the tent door and he was looking
[2:00:30] out he was watching he was waiting amen
[2:00:33] so am I I know the Lord's coming in this
[2:00:36] day it's been 60 years 50 years I've
[2:00:39] been waiting but I'm looking for him
[2:00:41] today and I'm looking for him tomorrow
[2:00:42] and all the signs of time is telling me
[2:00:45] he's
[2:00:47] coming and I want to be ready
[2:00:51] all
[2:00:54] right so the Third
[2:00:57] Exodus no matter how many denominational
[2:01:02] barriers Satan has raised amen by the
[2:01:06] Catholic denomination by the Protestant
[2:01:10] denomination by the religious Sinners
[2:01:12] under Moses's message no matter how many
[2:01:17] barriers he has raised
[2:01:19] God made a promise it will be light in
[2:01:23] the evening
[2:01:25] time and there's there's nothing going
[2:01:28] to stop it amen amen amen and and and
[2:01:31] the denominational barri is what did it
[2:01:33] do it separated the people from the Holy
[2:01:36] Ghost did it not it gave them a wafer it
[2:01:39] gave them a handshake right it gave them
[2:01:42] sensation a false
[2:01:45] evidence it gave him a false baptism
[2:01:49] amen all kinds of barriers but in the
[2:01:52] evening time it shall be light
[2:01:56] amen and where does the pillar of fire
[2:01:59] appear in the evening time publicly
[2:02:01] first in the water
[2:02:04] amen why straight is the gate and narrow
[2:02:08] is the way God's restoring the first
[2:02:11] step you got to get it right and that's
[2:02:13] acts
[2:02:14] 238 so it separated all these
[2:02:17] barriers
[2:02:20] us from the light of God and it
[2:02:23] separated the people from the others
[2:02:25] Oneness over here and The Trinity over
[2:02:28] here and look at it now well I worship
[2:02:31] this way I go to this church in the
[2:02:33] message you worship here you go to this
[2:02:35] church of the message okay let me tell
[2:02:37] you something friend all right if you
[2:02:40] want to act that way that's your choice
[2:02:43] yeah it my choice
[2:02:45] is I've gone around the world I've
[2:02:48] Fellowship with every group in the
[2:02:51] message well aren't you afraid of fleas
[2:02:53] no because when he's sealed in Satan
[2:02:57] sealed out that's right can Satan tempt
[2:02:59] me yeah can he battle me
[2:03:02] yeah right but what God started in me
[2:03:05] God's going to finish
[2:03:08] amen so amen if you're going to let your
[2:03:11] light
[2:03:12] shine you're going to have to overcome
[2:03:15] some of those denominational spirits
[2:03:17] that have come out in The
[2:03:20] Exodus because God is going to test you
[2:03:23] and see your
[2:03:28] reaction because we've been taught on
[2:03:31] the tapes the message brother random not
[2:03:33] only lived it not only taught it he
[2:03:35] lived it he stood between the Oneness
[2:03:38] and The Trinity yes he did yes he
[2:03:41] did yes he
[2:03:47] did amen
[2:03:52] so the evening
[2:03:54] light is going to shine and what's it
[2:03:57] going to do it's going to restore the
[2:03:59] word of reconciliation yes amen the Holy
[2:04:02] Ghost moves according to his word the
[2:04:05] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ no
[2:04:07] eternal hell all all of these different
[2:04:10] things all the building material it
[2:04:13] takes to build the body of Christ into
[2:04:15] the statue of a perfect man the evening
[2:04:18] light message is going to reveal it and
[2:04:20] he shined it amen he was an example amen
[2:04:26] amen that no barrier could stand in his
[2:04:30] way because of why the presence of Jesus
[2:04:34] Christ the presence of Jesus
[2:04:37] Christ whose presence is with
[2:04:40] you right is it Jesus Christ what is
[2:04:43] that like is it Jesus Christ
[2:04:46] amen amen
[2:04:50] for 6,000 years God's plan is I want to
[2:04:53] reunite God and man as one and here we
[2:04:56] are in this age when it's coming to pass
[2:04:59] and we see it materializing in William
[2:05:01] Mary and brandom and the people want to
[2:05:02] separate
[2:05:06] it who's the temple of God we are we
[2:05:11] are not flowers not
[2:05:15] animals man is the Temple of Light amen
[2:05:19] it's man that God wants to reflect the
[2:05:22] light of life through
[2:05:24] exactly
[2:05:26] amen
[2:05:29] amen and so in the evening
[2:05:32] time the sun would come out to
[2:05:37] reflect the light of the cross through
[2:05:39] the messenger of Malachi 4 lifted him up
[2:05:43] by the Seven Seals and when he broke the
[2:05:46] Seven Seals what did he do he lifted the
[2:05:49] veil off the
[2:05:51] Bible amen he lifted the veil off to the
[2:05:54] Bible so we could see God's truth of how
[2:05:57] to unite with him he lifted the veil off
[2:06:00] of my heart and put the Holy Ghost in so
[2:06:03] now I can see my position I am not happy
[2:06:08] being a born again Son of God I want to
[2:06:11] be an amateur
[2:06:13] God a fully mature
[2:06:17] Christian
[2:06:19] you say well how can you do that by the
[2:06:22] Light that's in me if I bear my cross
[2:06:25] which were coming to
[2:06:27] now then I can Shine the Light of
[2:06:30] reconciliation and as as you reconcile
[2:06:33] others you're reconciling
[2:06:37] yourself
[2:06:47] amen
[2:06:49] so watch let me let me share this with
[2:06:52] you through the seven Church
[2:06:56] ages they had the earnest of
[2:06:59] reconciliation that light what they have
[2:07:02] they had a rainbow light but it was only
[2:07:05] a half a
[2:07:06] circle right when you look at a rainbow
[2:07:10] from the earth you can only see a half a
[2:07:12] circle how many can say amen amen see
[2:07:15] and that
[2:07:16] represented the earnest of our Recon
[2:07:18] ilation being born that is the Son of
[2:07:21] God light but in the evening time light
[2:07:25] when you get up into the heavens where
[2:07:28] this man was taken up then it's the
[2:07:31] complete circle of light it's the
[2:07:34] complete rainbow light amen that rent
[2:07:38] The Veil off the Bible rent The Veil off
[2:07:40] your heart and rent the veil off of the
[2:07:43] flesh to see behind the veil of William
[2:07:46] brandom the power of an amateur
[2:07:49] God amen amen to whose
[2:07:54] Glory read second Thessalonians to the
[2:07:58] glory of Jesus Christ do you think I
[2:08:00] made myself a perfect man do you think
[2:08:03] you made yourself a perfect man you're
[2:08:05] are his
[2:08:06] workmanship Amen to him be the
[2:08:09] glory amen
[2:08:13] amen all right let's move
[2:08:16] on so
[2:08:19] here's a key to the
[2:08:20] message brother George he he does a
[2:08:23] wonderful job he he talks about God
[2:08:25] doesn't
[2:08:26] change
[2:08:28] right uh he he talks about Amos
[2:08:31] 3:7 there's the other key that God works
[2:08:34] in
[2:08:35] threes is that right absolutely all of
[2:08:39] these keys are critical to understanding
[2:08:43] the plan of God so the key to the
[2:08:46] message in this age here's another key
[2:08:48] all right it's the keys that Peter
[2:08:51] had
[2:08:53] okay the half of circle the half of
[2:08:56] rainbow light is the earnest of your
[2:08:58] salvation that's all they had through
[2:09:00] seven Church ages but in the evening
[2:09:02] light the complete circle of this
[2:09:06] rainbow light the complete Covenant to
[2:09:08] manifest the
[2:09:11] token not as the earnest of salvation
[2:09:14] but to manifest it in the full stature
[2:09:17] of a perfect
[2:09:19] man okay so if you had that picture here
[2:09:22] Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[2:09:25] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[2:09:27] and the Capstone comes down
[2:09:31] amen and the Capstone manifests the full
[2:09:35] stature of the perfect man which is the
[2:09:39] token and it
[2:09:41] comes don't let this scare you please it
[2:09:46] comes not as Son of God but but a son of
[2:09:50] man it's a son of man reflecting the
[2:09:54] perfect life of Jesus Christ the son of
[2:10:00] man how did he perfect You by his blood
[2:10:03] and his life yes amen amen
[2:10:10] amen all
[2:10:13] right how many
[2:10:15] remember so we're going to we're going
[2:10:17] to hit this now clo how many remember
[2:10:20] the story brother Brown tells about the
[2:10:22] dunard cafe when he went to eat there it
[2:10:25] was a Holiness atmosphere and they were
[2:10:27] closed on Sunday okay all right I'm
[2:10:30] going to dramatize that a little bit
[2:10:31] from me memory to help with the point
[2:10:34] and this is my takeaway okay when I
[2:10:37] heard the tapes when I listened to the
[2:10:39] message this is my impact amen am I free
[2:10:43] to tell you the impact it had on me amen
[2:10:47] amen amen
[2:10:49] amen and
[2:10:51] so he on Sunday the dunkard resturant
[2:10:54] was closed the Holiness so he had to go
[2:10:55] to another Cafe to eat and when he did
[2:10:58] it was a worldly
[2:11:01] atmosphere he saw the the
[2:11:03] youth they were in sin he saw the law
[2:11:07] they were in sin he saw the seniors and
[2:11:10] that that older lady there her hair was
[2:11:12] purple and all painted up real shorts
[2:11:15] flabby and Dr and drinking with those
[2:11:18] those two men he saw that and you know
[2:11:21] what happened it upset
[2:11:24] him it upset him it absolutely upset him
[2:11:30] and he said Lord how can you stand a
[2:11:34] look at this why don't you just condemn
[2:11:37] it did he do it yeah he did why God's
[2:11:42] given us an
[2:11:43] example amen look look at Elisha amen
[2:11:47] when he when he came to to to to help
[2:11:50] Jehoshaphat and and what was that King
[2:11:52] ahab's son's name rabom or
[2:11:55] Jobo one of those guys right and he saw
[2:11:58] him and Elisha was
[2:12:01] upset right he was flat out upset and he
[2:12:04] said I wouldn't even look at you if it
[2:12:07] wasn't for this righteous
[2:12:11] man and so brother brandham was upset it
[2:12:15] absolutely upset him because he was in
[2:12:17] this atmosphere now he's in this
[2:12:18] atmosphere Lord how can you look at this
[2:12:20] why don't you just destroy it and start
[2:12:23] over and brother Ram said the angel that
[2:12:26] was with him said come aside I know amen
[2:12:29] and he went over in the corner yeah
[2:12:32] amen and he showed him a
[2:12:35] vision and he saw a
[2:12:37] world and around this world was a
[2:12:42] rainbow around the world was a
[2:12:45] rainbow and that rainbow acted as the
[2:12:48] blood of the Covenant amen and all the
[2:12:52] sins that come up they could not get
[2:12:55] through that rainbow light amen and then
[2:12:59] and and then when he saw the the the
[2:13:01] sins hitting Jesus remember he he would
[2:13:04] shake and he would Pat himself in the
[2:13:06] blood and he would write on the book
[2:13:08] pardon and brother Ram says is that the
[2:13:11] sins of the world he said no that's your
[2:13:14] sins amen amen that's your sins what's
[2:13:19] the takeaway don't condemn her go Shine
[2:13:23] the Light of
[2:13:28] reconciliation amen did you get that
[2:13:31] don't condemn her amen you you want to
[2:13:35] be reconciled by the light now go and
[2:13:38] Shine the Light to the reconciliation to
[2:13:40] her yeah it looks bad amen yeah she was
[2:13:44] bound yeah she was deep in sin but it
[2:13:47] just takes somebody with the light of
[2:13:50] reconciliation and the love of God to
[2:13:52] reach out and touch him that's
[2:13:55] right Reach Out And Touch him
[2:14:00] sir not if uh you don't come to my
[2:14:03] fellowship you
[2:14:05] know it doesn't work
[2:14:08] friends I I my my position is you
[2:14:11] Fellowship wherever you want you do what
[2:14:13] you want but come on let's start acting
[2:14:17] like the example that William Mariam
[2:14:19] brandom gave
[2:14:21] us yes
[2:14:25] sir let's project the light let's try to
[2:14:28] win those that are opposing us that are
[2:14:31] against
[2:14:35] us and so watch young people I want to
[2:14:39] say they emphasize this next part to you
[2:14:41] especially to help you because I should
[2:14:43] have learned this a lot younger in my
[2:14:45] life as a Christian okay by your
[2:14:50] cross you die once to
[2:14:55] sin I'm Sorry by his cross you die once
[2:14:58] to sin how many heard me by you by his
[2:15:03] cross you die once the sin by your
[2:15:06] cross you die
[2:15:09] daily
[2:15:11] okay by his cross you die once to sin by
[2:15:16] your cross you die
[2:15:18] daily so when you die once to sin the
[2:15:22] veil is rent off your heart the old man
[2:15:25] is crucified and the light shines in the
[2:15:29] new man raises up and that's in your
[2:15:32] soul
[2:15:34] amen but in your
[2:15:37] spirit and in your
[2:15:39] mind in that spirit and in their mind is
[2:15:43] where the Battle of light and darkness
[2:15:46] is taking place
[2:15:49] the Battle of light and darkness is in
[2:15:52] your mind and your flesh it's still dark
[2:15:57] okay the sinful impulses so don't go by
[2:15:59] that feeling amen amen that doesn't
[2:16:02] Define you no it doesn't okay and so in
[2:16:05] your
[2:16:06] mind and this is why you have to pray
[2:16:09] this is why you have to hear the word
[2:16:12] this is why you have to meditate on the
[2:16:13] word and read your Bible and come to
[2:16:16] church and stay in the
[2:16:19] atmosphere and and not only just think
[2:16:21] about yourself but put yourself out
[2:16:23] create an atmosphere here and here so
[2:16:25] people can get Faith people can get
[2:16:27] healed the church can get
[2:16:29] blessed amen Shine Your Light amen
[2:16:35] amen
[2:16:36] amen but in your
[2:16:40] spirit you have to Die daily because
[2:16:44] you're in the kingdom of darkness but
[2:16:47] you're not of the the darkness amen
[2:16:49] everywhere we look everything we see
[2:16:51] dark dark dark see and then Satan comes
[2:16:56] and and and uh he has an your old book
[2:16:59] of your old life it it's a counterfeit
[2:17:02] because the other one doesn't exist amen
[2:17:05] amen amen do not let him amen
[2:17:09] anymore accuse you by your old book God
[2:17:13] said it does not
[2:17:15] exist it does not exist
[2:17:18] that's true amen that's true that's true
[2:17:22] and so he continually wants you to look
[2:17:24] back to what you were because he doesn't
[2:17:27] want you to be what Jesus died for you
[2:17:30] to
[2:17:30] be amen all right amen so then in my
[2:17:35] mind I'm dying daily in my mind I'm
[2:17:38] fighting the battle right well the
[2:17:41] battle's change the situations change
[2:17:44] some of it you just knock it off knock
[2:17:45] it off knock it off right right right we
[2:17:47] see and other times there's something

[2:17:57] family you know the barrier maybe in the

[2:18:05] that you care about right it cares it
[2:18:08] matters to you right and it's a burden
[2:18:10] to you amen so what are you going to do
[2:18:13] with that burden what does God want you
[2:18:15] to do he wants you to shine in the light
[2:18:18] of reconciliation amen amen well you say

[2:20:58] his will be done right amen okay amen
[2:21:01] and so then and so then you've been
[2:21:03] patient okay we know the answer we we're
[2:21:06] holding our peace we're patient what are
[2:21:08] we waiting for for God's time and all of
[2:21:11] a sudden one day you're not even
[2:21:13] thinking about it and you're in the room
[2:21:16] and it's the right place and it's the
[2:21:18] right time and the Lord tell quickens
[2:21:20] you to speak and you just say it so
[2:21:23] mellow so softly you know uh did you
[2:21:25] ever think about this and this and this
[2:21:27] and this and boom the light turns
[2:21:31] on is that the way it happens amen
[2:21:34] that's the way it's happened for me
[2:21:36] that's the way it can happen for you
[2:21:38] that's what the light of reconciliation
[2:21:40] is amen it's very hard excuse me it's
[2:21:44] very
[2:21:45] hard when
[2:21:47] you know you've had a positive attitude
[2:21:49] to somebody and you get a negative back
[2:21:52] it's very hard when you've said good
[2:21:54] things about somebody and you know
[2:21:56] they're saying not so good things about
[2:21:58] you amen it's very hard when you're
[2:22:00] doing good for others and they're not
[2:22:03] doing good for you I mean let's be
[2:22:05] honest it's painful it hurts yes it does
[2:22:09] it absolutely hurts but I'm going to
[2:22:12] tell you it's
[2:22:13] normal can we all can we all give a
[2:22:16] smile little facelift right now it's
[2:22:19] normal Satan wants to make you to think
[2:22:22] it's not normal it's normal this is the
[2:22:25] path of a Christian yes it is yes it is
[2:22:30] amen amen so knowledge Temperance
[2:22:35] patience and then all of a sudden God
[2:22:39] inspires you without even thinking about
[2:22:43] it amen to speak that's the kind of word
[2:22:47] word I'd like to see the church speak
[2:22:49] amen that kind of word God has to get
[2:22:52] you in control of the Seven Virtues
[2:22:55] before you're going to get the authority
[2:22:57] of the spoken creative
[2:22:59] word how can he trust you with the
[2:23:02] spoken creative word when your life is
[2:23:05] not in the control of the Seven Virtues
[2:23:07] that's right that's what it's all
[2:23:11] about I I I believe in the spoken
[2:23:14] credible we've seen the five indications
[2:23:16] of it
[2:23:18] amen but when God took brother brandham
[2:23:21] into it he goes he didn't even know the
[2:23:23] scripture the scripture puzzled him
[2:23:25] right and then and then when you you
[2:23:27] watch how he describes him speaking the
[2:23:29] word who's talking to me what who is
[2:23:34] that it's not being presumptuous
[2:23:37] no it's God taking control of his bride
[2:23:41] it's you
[2:23:43] surrendering through the difficulty of
[2:23:45] the hard trials okay
[2:23:51] look now I'm going to close with this
[2:23:54] and I've been one hour and four
[2:23:56] minutes and I just ask for a little
[2:23:58] Grace because my time is
[2:24:00] up but this will bring it all together
[2:24:02] for
[2:24:03] you what what motivates a born again
[2:24:07] Christian to endure hardness as a good
[2:24:10] soldier of the Cross to suffer
[2:24:14] afflictions what motivates you
[2:24:17] the reason is and I'm here's this is a
[2:24:19] new symbol but it's it's just another
[2:24:22] symbol of adoption the reason is you are
[2:24:25] anointed for a kingly
[2:24:29] position you're anointed for a kingly
[2:24:31] position now we'll bring this out that's
[2:24:33] and and that is to sit in his throne
[2:24:37] that's correct as he sat in the father's
[2:24:41] Throne right and that's the promise of
[2:24:44] Revelations
[2:24:45] 3:21 to him that overcometh will sit
[2:24:49] with me in my
[2:24:51] throne in The Great I
[2:24:54] Am as I sat down in The Great I
[2:24:58] Am amen and here's what brother brandom
[2:25:02] said about that verb adom if we suffer
[2:25:06] for Christ and his word we will reign
[2:25:11] with him for he is the word if we suffer
[2:25:15] for him and his word
[2:25:17] we will reign with him in his word in
[2:25:21] other words you're going to come to the
[2:25:23] top of the pyramid all right am all
[2:25:25] right and so it's just another symbol of
[2:25:28] a another symbol of of adoption okay
[2:25:32] that God has anointed us with the spirit
[2:25:35] of adoption when you are born again
[2:25:38] you're Anointed with the spirit of
[2:25:40] adoption right that you're predestinated
[2:25:43] to adoption when you're when you're born
[2:25:45] again you've got the Spirit of glory
[2:25:48] amen you're anointed to suffer to be
[2:25:52] crowned in glory all the different
[2:25:54] symbols see the Bible's open to me see
[2:25:57] no matter what what epistle I read I can
[2:25:59] see it because I see the pattern yes
[2:26:02] amen I see the pattern all right
[2:26:04] look and so all of this God foreshadowed
[2:26:08] by
[2:26:09] David God had Samuel the prophet to call
[2:26:13] David okay how did he call him well he
[2:26:16] offered up the blood he made a blood
[2:26:19] sacrifice how did he call you he offered
[2:26:22] up his own blood the blood begin to
[2:26:25] speak to you amen Jesus begin to call
[2:26:28] you and you know in the prayer line so
[2:26:30] many he makes it so simple he says yeah
[2:26:32] that's him talking to you right remember
[2:26:34] he that brother George brother yeah
[2:26:36] that's him talking to you yeah yeah yeah
[2:26:38] I was waiting for you you you hear that
[2:26:39] on tell yeah that was him talking to you
[2:26:42] yes that was him see so through the
[2:26:44] blood he calls you and and then when you
[2:26:47] answer the call by the blood he anoints
[2:26:50] you and pours the oil on you for your
[2:26:56] position and he poured the oil on David
[2:26:59] to anoint him for a kingly
[2:27:02] position David was just a good shepherd
[2:27:06] He was the Good Shepherd that put his
[2:27:07] life on the line for the Sheep but now
[2:27:10] he's being anointed to be the chief
[2:27:13] Shepherd of
[2:27:15] Israel the Chief Shepherd of Israel the
[2:27:19] king of Israel which means he wears the
[2:27:22] crown he's got the throne so he's got
[2:27:25] the power of the king he's got the
[2:27:28] Dominion of the throne amen and that's
[2:27:31] what it is when we will get placed into
[2:27:33] Christ Jesus we will be joint hirs with
[2:27:37] him amen this is the age it's coming
[2:27:42] it's already
[2:27:43] unfolded because he does nothing except
[2:27:45] he shows you first first by his prophet
[2:27:48] and he took him into the The Cloud of
[2:27:50] Glory right and where did he do it in
[2:27:52] the Coronado Forest which means what the
[2:27:54] crowning Place amen the crowning place
[2:27:59] if you got up and you know did a little
[2:28:01] dance on that one I wouldn't blame you I
[2:28:05] I did one too when I saw that praise the
[2:28:08] Lord
[2:28:08] look and so he foreshadowed into David
[2:28:12] he called him by the blood and he
[2:28:13] anointed him by the
[2:28:15] spirit for a kingly position Amen to be
[2:28:19] the chief Shepherd of Israel praise the
[2:28:24] Lord now let me make sure I get this
[2:28:26] right okay and uh and so the question is
[2:28:31] the question is is then
[2:28:34] why why did
[2:28:37] David why did David have to suffer the
[2:28:40] way he did why do you have to suffer the
[2:28:43] way you do amen after we're anoint
[2:28:46] anointed right through the blood and the
[2:28:49] spirit for our kingly position for our
[2:28:53] adoption right amen then we have to
[2:28:56] suffer amen and what happened to David
[2:28:59] David he started doing exploits of Faith
[2:29:02] so God begin to vindicate his kingly
[2:29:05] ministry before Saul and the church and
[2:29:08] the Philistines in the world they all
[2:29:11] knew it they all saw the the the sign of
[2:29:15] it amen just like when brother bandam
[2:29:18] says Lord what does this mean being me
[2:29:20] being caught up into this cloud of and
[2:29:22] the Lord put the king's sword in his
[2:29:25] hands okay put the king's sword in his
[2:29:29] hands you're being anointed for a kingly
[2:29:33] Ministry praise the Lord amen
[2:29:36] amen amen and
[2:29:39] so and so here's David anointed he's
[2:29:43] doing exploits of Faith right because
[2:29:45] God's vindicating
[2:29:47] him and then instead of David taking the
[2:29:51] throne he became a fugitive
[2:29:54] EXA he was caught in the fires between
[2:29:58] the church split with Saul and the world
[2:30:01] you know they were both against it you
[2:30:03] know it's one thing when the world's
[2:30:05] against you and then you're having to
[2:30:06] fight this church split over here in the
[2:30:09] message amen amen I'm just being
[2:30:13] honest but I'm telling you I'll fellow
[2:30:16] sh with any of you and even if you know
[2:30:19] me speaking about the son of man scares
[2:30:22] you I'll still fellowship with you
[2:30:25] right I'm I'm saying that as gracious as
[2:30:27] I can I'm trying to be
[2:30:30] example okay
[2:30:33] amen look so so now he becomes a
[2:30:38] fugitive now now he's on the run now
[2:30:43] he's on the defense now he's having to
[2:30:45] hide out he's a you know he's anointed
[2:30:48] for this position right and he's hiding
[2:30:50] out he's running for his life he's being
[2:30:53] treated like a dog and all he did was
[2:30:56] good
[2:30:58] exactly
[2:31:00] amen amen and why did God permit it why
[2:31:04] did God permit an evil spirit to come on
[2:31:07] Saul and what what what did that evil
[2:31:10] spirit anoints Saul with
[2:31:13] hatred and when people hate
[2:31:16] they murder they'll kill your
[2:31:19] influence okay amen I'm talking about
[2:31:23] spirits we're talking this is a house of
[2:31:26] correction this is for those that want
[2:31:28] to come to your kingly position this is
[2:31:31] those that are willing to Humble
[2:31:32] themselves to the word of the king in
[2:31:34] this hour and say Lord whatever it takes
[2:31:38] let me sacrifice it to the Cross
[2:31:42] amen I'm not here to condemn anybody
[2:31:45] right I'm here to help you
[2:31:48] right and so Saul uh uh David got
[2:31:53] frustrated absolutely absolutely he got
[2:31:57] flustrated you know he he got
[2:31:59] discouraged he was on the Run he was on
[2:32:02] the def defense and yet he was anointed
[2:32:05] with that rainbow light exactly he was
[2:32:09] anointed with that rainbow light that
[2:32:12] oil but why did God permit it brother
[2:32:15] manam told us because kingly
[2:32:18] power without kingly character can't
[2:32:22] Reign it's
[2:32:25] demonic okay it's de it it's demonic and
[2:32:28] so kingly power without kingly
[2:32:32] character it will destroy life that's
[2:32:36] what it does that's what a demon does
[2:32:38] it's out to destroy it's not out to
[2:32:41] edify it's not out to tear down barriers
[2:32:43] and build Bridges it's out to destroy
[2:32:46] and tear things apart am
[2:32:49] okay and so hmon was the classic
[2:32:52] character of that you remember hmon the
[2:32:55] king's right-hand man the King of Persia
[2:32:57] his right-hand man right he had a demon
[2:33:01] character but he had the king's
[2:33:03] signature ring do you know that he had
[2:33:06] the king's signature ring and the King's
[2:33:09] signature ring means that he had the
[2:33:11] authority of the king's name he had the
[2:33:13] power of the throne he had the power of
[2:33:16] the of the crown was all behind him by
[2:33:20] the king's signature ring amen and so
[2:33:23] when he made the decree he hated the
[2:33:26] Jews why because morai would not bow to
[2:33:29] that Spirit
[2:33:31] know right he won't bow I'm not going to
[2:33:34] bow to no denominational Spirit you know
[2:33:37] I you can just Fellowship me anybody can
[2:33:40] just Fellowship me I've had to suffer
[2:33:42] that but I'm not going to bow to that
[2:33:44] but you know what I'm going to love you
[2:33:47] I'm going to be your friend if you'll
[2:33:49] let me I'm going to help you why it's in
[2:33:53] me brother it's in me that's what's in
[2:33:56] me and now sometimes you know brother
[2:33:59] George we know we get hurt and we got to
[2:34:01] wrestle it out we got to fight it out
[2:34:03] amen but that's part of the experience
[2:34:06] yes it is that's part of the experience
[2:34:08] yes it is and so the reason then and so
[2:34:11] hmon what' he do he he wrote out a
[2:34:14] proclamation going to kill all the the
[2:34:16] Jews and being that it was the king's
[2:34:18] word it could not be altered and do you
[2:34:20] know that that Proclamation is in
[2:34:22] writing to get the spiritual Jews the
[2:34:24] Bride of Jesus
[2:34:26] Christ
[2:34:27] absolutely it's already in in in writing
[2:34:30] it's just waiting for the
[2:34:34] hour so that's what hmon did with his
[2:34:38] kingly power he used it to destroy and
[2:34:42] to
[2:34:43] kill but there was another man called
[2:34:45] Mor
[2:34:47] he lived his life for others he
[2:34:49] developed the character of a queen in
[2:34:53] hadessa right who became Esther not only
[2:34:56] did he do that but he saved the King's
[2:34:59] life how many knows that story he saved
[2:35:02] the King's life and it reminds me of
[2:35:04] brother brandham brother brandham saved
[2:35:06] the life of the king of saints you say
[2:35:08] how did he do that well because of the
[2:35:11] conspiracy of the Oneness and The
[2:35:13] Trinity against acts 238
[2:35:16] amen he stood right in between the two
[2:35:19] and says no sir the baptism is in the
[2:35:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[2:35:25] if you want the atonement and you want
[2:35:27] to meet the king of the Saints amen you
[2:35:30] got to meet it by acts
[2:35:33] 238 so then you know just at the right
[2:35:38] time the Lord brought it to the mind of
[2:35:42] the
[2:35:43] king he he got woke up
[2:35:46] started reading the Chronicles he wrote
[2:35:48] about the story of of morai what
[2:35:51] happened here what has been done for
[2:35:53] morai oh nothing okay many times nothing
[2:35:58] right you'll hear nothing you'll know
[2:36:01] nothing time will go by and a year like
[2:36:03] God
[2:36:04] remembers God remembers God knows and so
[2:36:08] what oh and he says what shall be done
[2:36:11] for the man whom the king Delight to
[2:36:13] honor about that time hmon comes you
[2:36:15] know all all stuck up well who else
[2:36:17] would the king want but me you know hmon
[2:36:20] wasn't satisfied being the right-hand
[2:36:22] man hmon wanted the very Throne himself
[2:36:25] is that right ain't that right
[2:36:27] absolutely and well hmon what shall be
[2:36:29] done with the man well put the Royal
[2:36:33] crown on his head put the king's Royal
[2:36:36] garments on him and put him on the
[2:36:39] king's
[2:36:40] horse and March him through the
[2:36:44] town what your be done with the man whom
[2:36:47] the king Delights to
[2:36:49] honor that's right
[2:36:52] wow and so then Esther exposed his
[2:36:56] scheme right he exposed his scheme again
[2:36:59] just at the right time Saints amen have
[2:37:03] faith in God it's been a long time since
[2:37:06] have faith in God claim your own
[2:37:11] amen amen amen and so exposes the
[2:37:17] plot he takes the king's ring off of
[2:37:21] hmon and puts it on the hand of morai
[2:37:24] why because he had the character he
[2:37:27] lived for others and what did he do he
[2:37:31] couldn't change the proclamation but he
[2:37:33] issued a new Proclamation amen just in
[2:37:36] time God will raise up a standard in
[2:37:40] this age when they move in to kill the
[2:37:43] Royal Seed of Abraham you can mark it
[2:37:46] down amen God's plan will not be filled
[2:37:49] amen and so amen now I'm out of Grace
[2:37:54] it's been one eight one minute 1 hour
[2:37:56] and 18 minutes but I'm almost done okay
[2:37:59] you love the
[2:38:02] Lord so David he became a
[2:38:07] fugitive and
[2:38:09] finally Saul had him cornered y Amen in
[2:38:13] the caves of inti how many's ever into
[2:38:16] Israel and seen that tour and you've
[2:38:18] seen inti in that area rugged area but
[2:38:20] there was that stream of water coming
[2:38:22] down through there and so he had him he
[2:38:25] was in the cave Saul was coming in but
[2:38:29] then God stood up for David Glory why do
[2:38:32] you think Saul got
[2:38:34] sleepy why why did he get sleepy amen
[2:38:38] the Lord put the Spirit of Slumber on
[2:38:40] him and he went so sound asleep and all
[2:38:43] the Army went to sleep and and then and
[2:38:46] then David and his men came up to King
[2:38:48] Saul and here came the final test for
[2:38:50] David here came the final Temptation for
[2:38:54] David David the Lord has delivered him
[2:38:57] into your hands kill him David amen God
[2:39:00] has put your enemy in your hands kill
[2:39:03] them amen here's your time to get even
[2:39:06] sister exactly here's your time to get
[2:39:10] even brother
[2:39:12] exactly
[2:39:14] exactly exactly and
[2:39:17] so light and darkness was going through
[2:39:19] his mind yeah right am he heard all the
[2:39:23] arguments of why he should kill him
[2:39:25] right see but finally the light of
[2:39:28] reconciliation David suffered all of
[2:39:31] this amen but the light of
[2:39:34] reconciliation came
[2:39:37] through and he says I'll touch not the
[2:39:39] Lord's anointed touch not the Lord's
[2:39:42] anointed and do His prophets no harm
[2:39:45] harm no matter how much you disagree
[2:39:48] with him do His prophets no
[2:39:53] harm so instead he cuts a piece of the
[2:39:56] king's garment he takes it and then Saul
[2:39:59] gets up and Saul goes out David calls
[2:40:04] him musicians you can
[2:40:11] come he calls
[2:40:14] him
[2:40:16] is that you my son
[2:40:21] David and he
[2:40:23] looks and he waves before him the king's
[2:40:28] garment he waves before him a token of
[2:40:33] kindness he's showing the king he's
[2:40:37] reflecting the light of
[2:40:39] reconciliation he showing in him I
[2:40:43] preserved your life
[2:40:46] amen I could have killed
[2:40:48] you but I preserved your life I could
[2:40:51] have got even if I had a grudge I would
[2:40:54] have got even but there was no grudges
[2:40:56] God forbid that I touch his anointed
[2:40:59] amen and his anointed acting like that
[2:41:02] yeah
[2:41:03] exactly
[2:41:05] exactly
[2:41:07] exactly and when King Saul saw
[2:41:10] it he said now I know that you'll be
[2:41:14] king for whereas I
[2:41:17] rewarded evil for good you rewarded good
[2:41:22] for
[2:41:24] evil that's what it's going to take
[2:41:27] Church yes it is to be the Bride of
[2:41:29] Jesus Christ in this age amen it's going
[2:41:33] to take more than hearing the word it's
[2:41:35] going to it's it's a LIF it's a life
[2:41:39] it's a light of
[2:41:42] reconciliation and did you
[2:41:44] notice amen Revelations
[2:41:48] 3:21 where why did God place it where he
[2:41:51] placed it in the
[2:41:52] scripture why is Revelations
[2:41:55] 3:21 at the end of the seven Church ages
[2:41:59] at the top of the pyramid because it's
