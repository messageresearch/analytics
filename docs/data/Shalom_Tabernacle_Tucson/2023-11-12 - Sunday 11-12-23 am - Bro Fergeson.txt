get that in your mind now and broke the seals of the mystery to reveal them to bring them to his see all of his redeemed subjects now when we hit this in the seals we're going to go back there and see them Souls under the altar crying Lord how long how long and here he is as a mediator on the altar just a little longer until there's more has to suffer like you but now he comes from here at this last seal he's no more mediator he's King now and what does he do if he's a king he has the have subjects and his subjects is them that he has redeemed and they cannot come before him until he takes the rights of redemption and now he walks forth from a mediator where death put us in the grave he comes forth with the rights and even those who are alive and remain till his coming shall not hinder

saying Holy Father so and so when the Bible said call no man father amen amen amen see they're sleeping with them that's a reason but when they come forth he said yeah we believe a woman just called up another woman said you know I'm Episcopalian said I I spoke in tongues the day I believe and receive the Holy Ghost but sh don't tell nobody I doubt that very much you might have spoke with tongues but you set a Man on Fire how's he going to set [Applause] still do could you imagine Peter and James and John God and I'm up in the upper room said oh we got the Holy Ghost how baby bre s keep brother through Windows Doors out into the street AC like a bunch of Dr that's the real Holy Ghost but you see that sleeping virgin ain't receiving nothing anyhow that's right and remember while they

love him amen and that's that's a personal preference maybe but we always start with brother Ferguson I start with him and then I try to get who I can to come after that and he's been gracious to come every year except for I think the co year I think he let us down that year but so so he's here to make up for us amen and uh we certainly appreciate him and uh we thank the Lord he's really meant something very special in my life and my Ministry personally and I when I moved to Montreal and so um certainly appreciate him and the visiting Brothers we work recognize all the brothers I believed and um tonight we'd have a special treat and would you like to know who's speaking tonight come and see there you go am come and see amen all right I promise I'll tell you tonight how about that all right but it was so beautiful to hear the Prophet this morning in our Sunday school we play that we play our Sunday School every Sunday morning as a Sunday school and we're going through the seven seal and um we went through the adoption series and there's no way to set the course of meetings like hear in the prophet of God every Sunday yes and it's beautiful I take privilege being able to introduce the prophet Amen to the people in special meetings amen so those of you that were here you got a chance to touch into that amen and so but uh tonight we have Fine Brothers that will be ministering tonight for us the Lord willing so right after the service we'll be dismissed we'll go take our lunch and we have service back at 4:00 we move that service time from 5: to 4: and I trust it'll be a blessing to you just enjoy yourself we try to make it as comfortable as we can we don't have a lot of means but the little we have the Lord is has blessed us to be able to provide that church over there just open their doors to us and then the the food and so forth It's a privilege to be able to serve you and I trust we're doing a good job so far God bless you the visitors had a nice little basket in your hotel I hope you got them did you open them up did you start crunching around and snacking it's so nice to get a little basket I mean it's not it seems like not much and you can buy it yourself but it's nice when you have a little gift basket and uh our sister Carina she does that every year and she's in the back there brother Chris and sister Carina they they make sure we get those done and they do just a wonderful job with that so I would ask her to stand but I won't mess with her tonight she just got a a new grandbaby beautiful little grand baby we appreciate you sister Carina and brother Chris we appreciate that so much and God bless you I want to read the quote that we had in this pamphlet here and then I'll have brother Ferguson come it's in the message doors and door 1965 paragraph 51 brother brandom says they always miss it man is forever praising God for what he did do looking forward what he will be and ignoring what he is doing that's just the nature of man and he hasn't changed his nature the man of the world so we find that our message is today the message that we have of come out of Babylon and be free and be filled with the spirit and your lamps trimmed and clear look up our Redemption is Drawing Near these things are foreign to many people who breathe and call call our lovely lord's name but yet in the midst of all of that we don't have nothing against those people those denominational people they're all right they're fine there are Associates in the gospel because Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that the father given me they will come so we're only responsible for sewing seeds some fell by the wayside some different kinds of ground some fell over and brought H 100 fold so we just seed sers God is the one who directs it when it's falling and now we pray that maybe this morning there will be a little seed drop along somewhere that might encourage someone and that's the purpose of these meetings that a seed would drop somewhere and encourage someone amen and I'm looking forward to being encourag encouraged I I think we have some friends from the St Carlos reservation is that right brother will I see some of them please stand these are from the Apache reservation the tribe praise the Lord God bless you amen God bless you good to see you brother will has been going there and and playing the tapes for there and brother George and different ministers have been going there if you hear what brother banham said about the Apaches and his meeting there you you'll value that that same little place where brother bam had his meetings they have church there and so there's a little light still amongst The Real Americans that's what he said amen and they're here today with us representing that God's word will never fail it won't return void God bless you thank you for joining us God bless you and God be with you amen so let's all stand to our feet we'll have brother Ferguson come and take the the pulit just now and let's sing that old song Amazing Grace how sweet it sounds oh am Jing Grace How Sweet the Sound has save a like me I was was lost but now I found was blind but now I [Music] see amen God bless every one of you you can be seated amen again it's such an honor and a privilege to be with you and we really been having a little Jubilee in our souls yes and talk with my wife and brother Markham and brother Fay that came with me and first time brother Fay has come to these meetings and first time brother maram has come and we were just having a a jubilee in all so and certainly thanking God for the time and enjoyed so much our brother whisper and his ministry and he's got just a little different way of presenting it and we really enjoyed it and last night I excited the Mee and I was just amazed to see the direction that he took and the things what the Lord led him to speak to us it was just such an honor and such a privilege for us amen and I I kind of feel little to stand after hearing men like him and brother Paul durkon I think I was sitting in the meeting yesterday I say My Oh My My I said I you know I I feel like brother Brandon you know when that old colored preacher was preaching and brother Brandon someone asked him how you a preacher he say no sir and you asked me this morning brother Fus I he a preacher I would have to tell you after hearing these brothers I have to say no [Laughter] sir what a blessing and we we certainly and I can say with on my heart of the blessings that the Lord has given me and I really certainly appreciate that God has given me the privilege to be associated with you all in this life amen in Israel I mean brother Israel what a a blessing I'm proud to have him as a a son-in-law and even when he was with us back in Quebec he spent two years or so with us we could have see that there was something in his life how God dealt with him how we stood with this message and the things that the Lord has done for him you know we have a a path that God leads us through you know how we go through it's just like when brother vam spoke those squirrels in existence and one of the brothers was talking about it I think it was Brother Where The Whisper spoke about it and brother randam said the squirrel will appear here it will travel here it will stop here so this the path of that squirrel was already designated you couldn't do anything but appear here travel here and stop here and we don't realize it that's our path in life is ordained of God Amen we go here and you know this is the way it is and when you know we see these things unfolding before our eyes and you might have a little tug in your heart to do certain things and many times you don't even recognize it's the Holy Spirit and that's where brother Brandon in the message thinks that I would be you know he's talking about the call of the Holy Spirit when God calls you and it's not a call like a physical call it's not like we standing here and saying brother Paul sister Molly could you all come it's not like that it's not like we standing and saying brother Bill better bill could you come sometimes we think that God does that through us no but bam said he tugs at your heart you see there's a pull in your heart and if he pulls in your heart there's something got to respond and what responds is love because you don't realize it but it was a seed of love in your heart for God way when you were little it was in you the time and there was something when he pul because if he if I call let's say I call here I call this wall I said come come come the wall can't come why there's nothing to respond but when Jesus says come unto me come see if I tell you come if I tell Israel Israel come and he comes what am I asking him to do come to where I am come Jesus saying come oh we could talk about that that's not my message though we just deviate but just to mention a little bit was really you know it really touched my heart to see the Lord took Alberto Billy Paul and but a billy and I we have a lot of history and things that we share together and I never forgot that back in I think it was in 2000 brother Coleman had a a big convention back in Harrisburg Pennsylvania and Brother David Sanger had a a convention with brother vly Paul and I in Lebanon in Pennsylvania Lebanon and Harrisburg is probably about 15 minutes difference and where a Coman meeting finished around finished the Friday and so um brother Billy Paul went to give his testimony on the Thursday and so I was in Baltimore at the time I came up to Baltimore I was in the meetings and kind of HIIT behind it was the last time I met but thean in this life was able to shake his hands we were good friends and shook his hands and stuff when he saw me said brother F what are you doing here I said I'm so happy to see you brother Coleman so we hugged each other and brother Billy PA gave his testimony and then it was the Saturday morning the Friday night I went I was supposed to start open the services and the so V Paul told him he said well I left to be with you all he said but I have to be with brother Ferguson and brother Sanger he said he will have the meetings on the Friday so the Friday brother B Paul came and then the Saturday morning something strange happened and that started a move right across the United States and what happened is uh my wife and daughters and she's here today and Sharon is here and I have to be careful you know how the ladies are sometimes it takes a little bit longer for them to get ready and fix their hair and you know you all understand that amen and I have to be careful you see I so Sharon where Sharon at Sharon were you with were you with us in that meetings in Pennsylvania where's she at she's read about I don't remember I think M was Sharon there with us I I don't remember that was in 2000 oh she was married already all right so Israel REM see anyway the girls were there and you know so I decided I said I'm going to I'm going to go a little ahead of them so I went with P Billy Paul so but Billy Paul picked me up and we were in the car and as we were going to the meetings that Saturday morning but the believe Paul was going to give it his testimony and one of us was talking and all of a sudden brother the P Paul stopped talking and he look at he just he was driving and he just glanced at me like this and he said brother Ferguson he said do you know what is happening here with the bo with us I says I know brother Billy Paul I recognize something is different here he said yes he said the same angel that was with brother brandham is here in this car right now oh brother to be in the presence of that angel then brother Billy Paul I don't know if was anyone here during those meetings in Pennsylvania Lebanon brother Ram was there okay brother lar you were there during the meetings in Pennsylvania back in I think it was 2000 it was the first time I met brother Wesco in my life and brother B Paul went in and he gave his testimony and while he was giving his testimony he said the angel of the Lord he said the same Angel was here and that night the Saturday night we prayed the tape and we start the pray meeting and in the pray meeting that night Paul looked he said but Ferguson that angel was with us and we heard from that time we started what was called the meetings right across in different parts of the United States especially in mon we went to to to to Florida together but Billy and I and we prayed for literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people sometimes in the pray line in mon I remember brother Paul being there we had up to four sometimes 500 people and the strange thing will be and sometimes you know sometimes people will think well you know I've been accused sometimes of things you and you know you've been accused and people don't understand and they well you know I said I told Brother Billy Paul maybe I'd like to get back you know and just hide myself he says no no no no no he said you stand with me and what he will do is this he'd always do this in all the par lines where he had just come to my left is well he have me to stand at his left he would stand here those of you who came to the meetings you remember and he would be here and he'd put one hand in me and one hand and the others as we pray together and I said brother Billy he says no he says I want you when we when we were at brother Coleman's meeting I was way in the back and he didn't know I was there he said if I knew you were there he said I would have had you come right up right near me he says and pray with me because what happened is the we were able to blend our F together in just perfect harmony and then God was able to do wonderful things it's like when we went to the means in in Florida and I don't know how many if is anyone here that was at nans at r Wesco when we went for the first time in Florida back in 2001 brother Ram was there is anyone else was there but we had people came in from Arizona we had from Chicago oh my that church was backed there was just no room my was just my my my and when we had it when we started a pray line our brother Bill Leighton which many of you know brother Bill he dropped dead and his wife is the nurse and they took his body and put it in the back room of that church and the man was past thought he was dead but but Bly Paul he had brother bram's Bible and the Bible that brother Billy Paul had was brother bram's old Bible that you hear and said the pages were taken out well I had the privilege once of looking into that Bible I don't want to take too much time on this all of this and in the Bible brother brandham wrote in his own handwriting and there were Visions brother bill that I read and saw in that Bible these Visions are spoken off on no tape never heard of it and brother Billy Paul turned to me I remember one night we were in cville together I'm just beating around you know I'm talking about like this we were in cville together and there was brother Matty huning in with us there was brother mat Brother Joseph Billy Paul and I and I think David Randon was there too and we were eating at a restaurant at the Texas roadh house never forgot but the Joseph was teasing me he was cracking those peanut shells and throwing it in my hair you know now I don't have much here but I had a little bit more you know put throwing it all in my hair and stuff so was and then we were coming back and we had a big old van that we had red and come back to the to the voice of God compound but Billy Paul took the Bible and he says you look at me he said brother Ferguson I want to share some things with you to you he opened that Bible and the first time in my life I saw brother Bam's Bible and brothers sisters you have scriptures that brother bam wrote to tying with other scriptures I looked at it and of course you know I've always prayed and ask Lord let me forget anything but I don't want to forget your word and as I looked into the Bible brother Paul there were visions and brother Paul said he said brother Fon do you know why I want to share this with you because at that time I around the world telling the people we got to try our responsibili to try and see what that Prophet say and line up with he said brother Ferguson he says you went around the world he said bringing these things and helping he says and I want to share this with you he said to show you that is it's a confirmation that the stand that you have taken for the message is correct because the stand that we take for the message it has to be a correct stand in the message the position we take you all understand Church you all understand I'm talking to you all kind of from my heart and sometimes I come among you and I you know we talk as family together you know and I read some of those visions and brother B Paul look at Brother Joseph he said Bud he said I would like the five page of the school feed like this he said I would like he said to see some of these Visions released to the people of course there are many visions that we aware we are aware of and I have not gone around trying to repeat these things that brother brandham had that was found it's found on notet tape and even when he gave brother the the notes to brother Vale to write the church is book there was a whole bunch of visions that brother bam gave to brother Vale because a lot of people does not realize how much brother Bam's Ministry even his preaching Ministry centered around the visions that God gave him a lot of people does not see that element of it all so to brother of Vil there was given and then brother of vale before he died shared with us some of the visions that brother brandham had given to him that brother brandham wrote that is found on not tape but here's how we fail so brother B Paul looked at it he said buddy brother he said Bud he said I would like if maybe one day he said that these Visions here this would be released to the public but thus far we have never released it it's not been released so I have no intentions I have never shared any even my wife as much as I love her she's try to pick and pull from me sometimes you know how it is you know but fry I'm your wife you know I've kind of locked it in my heart you know you know how it is you understand how that is so but anyway we have a treat and there's some things I want to share with you that might seem a little bit different a little bit if I would call it we're going to hit and a little couple of little thoughts this morning and yesterday talking to the ministers um brother Israel and I think brother uh whisper mentioned it a little bit last night too it might have been nice for the rest of you all to hear a little bit of what was said during the Ministries meeting so this morning I'm going to try to combine a little bit of it I mean as we go forward and trust the Lord but we're going to see some things that seem contradictory and I want you all to stop and think very closely uh don't jump to conclusions just hold back wait to see how it will reconcile see it will go because sometimes I ask you all questions and it's not to put traps for you not a bit of it but it's just to see how you will react to some of it you understand how it is see so this morning we could do that now I'll try my best and hurry okay and sometimes in the meeting some folks tell me that there Ro of ferus you know you share little testimonies with us of course you know as is well mentioned I know I'm I'm aware of the fact that you know I've been a missionary and the work that God has used in you know that God has helped me in a little in a little way to be able to Speare ahead the Revival and central Africa which is the biggest Revival move of God of in this message anywhere in the world and so huge that the fires has been building in different countries and I had to go in into those countries during the time of the war you know I was there just after the tootsies and The Hoots war in Rwanda uh we helped to smuggle some of to help some of the brothers to get out of that uh so we were instrumental in that and you know different things that so I was there in Angola brutal War I was in the Congo during the times of the war and had to go in during that time and the real truth of it is I told you all God prepares this man for his job like for instance you know I grew up in one of the the worst ghettos in the islands and danger and killing and murder and stabbings and stuff you know I I was there I grew up I was there was a little boy I you know we were in gang Warfare we didn't we didn't have guns but we had knives and you know I even was in a telling one of the brothers in Phoenix he was amazed to hear this I was in a machete fight one day and on my hand here is a mark of the machete I got cut right across my hand the machete in my hand saved my life because when that guy came with the machete I had to block it like this and I slid it down and I cut him right across his hands here I nearly took his whole wrist off so I knew what was all of that and then I stood back when the blood was on his hand and the blood was on my hand I said if we don't stop I said I will kill you or you will kill me I said and I said if you chop me I said a little bit more I said I'm going to go into you I said regardless to what I said so we so we decided to stop but we went into all of this so the how you grew up your Youth and everything God has that we can't say you know one is better than the other you know God has this for specific purpose or Reason different things and I was grow up in that so I become Fearless in my heart in myself I remember going into the New York City several years ago and it was very bad and went to Harlem and one night 2:00 in the morning and my brother was amazing you know I put on a little funny hat on my head you know I had on an old black dark shirt spotted tie I think I look like a gangster myself and I walked in to get some food and the people who were in the store were trembling they thought I was one of the bandits you know they were worried about me see and it's like that you know you grow up and you're Fearless you know you you don't have that fear and therefore if I have to go in then I go in see and of course we can go back and share many testimonies you probably heard my testimony how God say me from a shark yeah remember that testimony I've shared it with you sometimes how many of you never heard that testimony how God saved my life from a shark huh you remember s you've been there you you you you Paul you remember that story yeah you know CU God is I mean the Lord we serve he's a god of Miracles you see and so many things that he has done I mean my hand here I I had the marks here and my wife was there and my cut right here from it and where I was I was hit with 25,000 volts of electricity wow now you talk about a cat having Nine Lives what God has done for us see and uh even the doctors even the specialist the specialist in hydroc up the you know they made a study because the three specialist they were talking about this and one specialist say well because I was up on the tree and they can't Hydra couldn't deny it because they knew it was 25,000 volts of electricity so nobody could deny it so I was up there on on the on an aluminum ladder cutting the tree and that electricity the aluminum the uh the aluminum the the tree I was that I was cutting up there it hit the high tension wires the aluminum wire the aluminum um ladder went this way electricity came down I raised my hand up like this it hit me right through here I saw like a a a Darkness went around me like a million miles an hour and then the light followed after the darkness which I went into the message and wouldn't have time to talk about that but then I fell off the tree and I didn't remember what happened and then the the the specialist in Hydro corbec of course when I fell off the street this hand right here with the with the shock of the electricity and all what happened the bone here came out so all that was holding my hand here was just the skin the bone here this bone here was broken and my finger came out of its socket this finger here was broken this stem here was broken so this came out of the socket CU after this I can't I never got back my hands here so tree specialist from Hydro Quebec talked about it and the Tre specialist said one specialist said what saved my life is the electricity went right through my body and grounded another specialist said what Sav your life is when electricity hit him it shrim off the tree because the government wanted to make a research to find out how my body was able to to to with stand 25,000 volts of electricity so they want to pay me to make a study on my brain and on every organ of my body because there's no scientific research there's no R it happened to ran two weeks before me and it just he he just fed on the tree so then the other specialist told it to others he said look man he said what you saying doesn't even make sense he said it takes a fraction he said 25,000 volts of electricity he said it takes a fraction of a second he said to bring your blood to boil and point he says no human being could could could withstand 25,000 volts of electricity but here is one standing before you and it's not because of me it's because of him amen so we are grateful to God now we got to get to the word now and um I told you I'm going to have to to try to hurry all right so is well if you if you see me going too long you should sit somewhere up here and you just you just pull on my um on my coat okay all right so God bless all of you are you ready now for the word of the Lord so we yes there's one thing I wanted to share with you all concerning brother Bly Paul I knew there was something there it was concerning that famous prophecy that people think around the world that it didn't happen and I shared a little bit with the ministers yesterday it's when brother banam called brother Billy and told Brother Billy he said Billy said where you standing he said I'm in Los Angeles he said ex but Billy Paul shared that testimony he said exactly there he said I'm standing in front of M he said you will not be an old man he says in sharks will be swimming around there so of course all of us Associated back that with the fact that when Los Angeles will California will sink you know we all felt that way for years and then I had an artic about the Tim Po had put out on the net that there was an earthquake there he said sometime in the 70s and that there was memos from the owner of the make company and he put out an article like that so I tell myself before I really go forward to say it I got to make an investigation so my daughter Grace she is a research I would specialist she was trained for that so she went back in the AR of Los Angeles and she made a Toral research on the net she knows how to going into it and what to do and then she came up with an article that she write for me and that is back in 1971 there was an eclipse of the moon of the Earth and the moon the earth and the the the Sun and the Moon pulled on opposite sides of the earth and the scientist says that this caused an earthquake in Los Angeles and what it did is it busted the dam in Los Angeles and the waters from the dam came in and it met and the waters from the ocean came in and the waters destroyed the hospital they said there was some articles said it was I think 62 and some say it was 65 people that died there's no you know there's two different uh reports on it but anyway it came right up to the May building and there was a memo from the owners of the May building telling the the workers telling the workers that not to go into the basement because there could be sharks swimming there so that was back in 1971 and brother Billy Paul was 36 years old and he said he was not an old man so you know sometimes we think that the prophecy didn't was not fulfilled but it was and the God we give the honor and the praise for everything all right let us let us stand at this time for a word of prayer Lord God we Feel So Unworthy as we think of how great you are and father as we enter into into your word let the anointing of your spirit come upon this congregation upon your unworthy servant Lord and the father we have spent many times here in this meetings and we pray that you'll bless brother Israel father as he tries to Faithfully stand behind this pulpit and this congregation here father may you bless them oh God Of Heaven let your Holy Spirit pour out in a mighty way Lord upon all of us as we look to you and thank you in Jesus name amen now we are going to go into this little message that I want to entitle it the reconciliation of all things it will time with what we were saying yesterday to the ministers and then from there by the grace of God we will move on now we want to look at this scriptures of um 2 Corinthians chapter 5 from verse 17 and Paul's speaking here verse 17 to 21 therefore If any man be in Christ 2 Corinthians 5:17 to 21 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things have become new and all things are of God who were reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and had given to us the ministry of reconciliation to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and had committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ dead be be reconciled to God for he had made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him and then we will take another scripture here which is Colossians chapter 1 uh from verse 17 to 23 Colossians chapter 1 uh verse 17 and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all dwell this full that all dwell DW all fullness dwell excuse me can someone bring me a little bit of water okay I think I have some water here could you bring me a little bit of water please thank you and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself self by him I say whether it be things in Earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alen and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now ha he reconciled in the body of his flesh through that to present you holy and in unblamable and irrova in his sight if he continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven where of I Paul are made a minister uh there's another scripture I would like to read for you just before you sit um this is a very important scripture for our study goodness yeah I think I um it's on the table thank you is well I forgot it and it's found in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and Paul speaking here first Corinthians we will refer back to this scripture a little later on as we get into our study 1 Corinthians chapter 15 thank you thank you and we will read here from verse 26 but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for since by mind came that by mind came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all died even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order Christ the first fruits afterwards they that are Christ at his coming oh god of Heaven bless your word Lord bless your people Inspire our hearts we pray in Jesus name amen God richly bless you you can be seated God bless you all what an honor and a privilege to be here amen amen and we thank the Lord now this morning we want to talk a little bit about the reconciliation of all things okay how God brings it and yesterday in the Ministries meeting we spoke a little bit about it and we showed where there's a Reconciliation where a pastor could reconcile individuals if there's a problem between you you could be reconciled and then there's a Reconciliation between us and God like the reconciliation of us with each other and then there's a reconciliation with you and I with God and then there's a Reconciliation of the word of God with the word of God when we see that statements maybe God make a statement over here and you know the Bible said something over here it says something over here that seems to contradict itself then how these two things reconcile or as brother bam uses the word to be able to EXP express it he use the word that these things death tail now before we go into the reconciliation of all of that I have something a question for all of us this is not a trap please I want to ask you a question we have heard now this is going to sound very contradictory to what you've been taught okay we've been heard all along since we've been in this message that we cannot be deceived and I believe it but I want to ask you a question were you deceived were you ever deceived silent quiet that's all right huh were you deceived now this something I want to share with you here because I want to I want to tie this deception with debt what you call a dying Church which a lot of people don't know what the church when it's dies what it means and when an individual is dead spiritually they don't know what it means because butam said that the last plague that hits the church is spiritual de a lot of people don't know what it means but let me go back to my question were you deceived no huh no some say no some say yes well let's go to the [Laughter] Bible represent yes let's go to the Bible and see what the Bible says all right Titus Chapter 3 from verse three for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving diverse lust and Pleasures living in Malice and envy hateful and hating other one another now this deception that Paul speaks of here brother Brandon teaches us that we were deceived and how we were deceived so both Paul and brother brandham deals with this and it is necessary for us to see this because in order for us to understand what happened we have to go back to the Book of Genesis because Genesis is the beginning of all things so we could really see what happened there in the deception now both brother brandham and Paul takes us back there and when we and here Paul also o mentions as we go back to it in Ephesians 2 verse 1 and 7 Paul tells us and you had he Quicken who were dead in trespasses and sins now we were dead in trespasses and sins but when a man is dead there is signs that he is dead do you know that there is no scientific definition for that because death according what I remember when I was studying as a biochemist and they said death is the cation of of living activities but even in the de there's still stuff going on there that looks like life do you know that the man is De and there's still stuff going on in that body so really they don't know what that really is but this message tell us that that is separation from life now if we want to go back a little bit to the Book of Genesis to see really what happened in the Book of Genesis so that we could understand this deception because we were deceived and how we were deceived now it's hard to understand to to understand this but this is necessary for us to see it if we are able to see the reconciliation of God how God reconciled us so we want to go back to the Book of Genesis and see what happened with our with with Eve and Adam back in the Book of Genesis now we go to Genesis CH 3 from verse 1 and the Bible says here now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made now this serpent we all understand that Satan incarnates himself three times in the Bible now everything runs in threes the prophet of God says so Satan incarnated himself three times in the Bible First he incarnates him self in the Beast which is here this is an incarnation of Satan in the Beast the second time Satan incarnates himself is in Judas and the third time that he incarnates himself is in the Beast where when he comes to the Beast brother bam says you all know he comes to the pope and in the heart of the pope is a devil and then he tells the devil to leave and the devil leaves and then Satan himself came in the Bible tells us in St John Chapter 13 if I remember right that Satan entered into the heart of Judas now the being Satan is not everywhere this is what a lot of people think in their mind well Satan is everywhere Satan the being cannot be there is only one being that is everywhere and that is God and God can be in more than one place at the same time and God of course gave brother bam that gift that brother Bam could be standing at the ppit and he's back 25 years or he's back 30 years in the life of someone like God could take Moses and put him right back to the dawn of creation and then Moses could write all what he saw and he did the same thing with John when he took John John was right on the a of atmas but he took John and transported him into the coming day of the Lord so if the being Satan is standing right here now he's got demons all over the place and his kingdom is all over the place but brother Brandon clearly tells us that Satan the being Satan cannot be in more than one place at the same time that is not possible when we say Satan is everywhere we are making a huge mistake because Satan is not God and cannot be in one place at the same time if Satan is right here I'm talking about the being Satan Lucifer if he's standing right near me here tempting me he cannot be in the back over there he cannot be in Africa he cannot be in Europe but he's got demons all over the place so the kingdom of Satan is all over the place his demons but his being Lucifer no amen no no no no no so the being Lucifer comes and in the heart of the pope is a devil then he orders the devil to leave and then Lucifer comes in and when he steps in that man changes from the Antichrist to become the Beast and then we have one quotation from the message that brother gram was going to preach on the trail of the serpent I have a quote I could bring from that message and he said in the quot he says the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end is the same Beast okay so Satan incarnates himself three times we will not go into that because in this age we have the Incarnation of God himself in his bride which is wonderful and but man de with that in the series we will not go into that today okay but now if we are to continue here in um in Genesis 3 and verse one now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yeah had God said he shall eat he shall not eat of every tree of the garden and then in verse two and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God had said he shall not eat of it neither shall he touch it l he die amen then what happened the Beast told Satan I mean Satan and the serpent told Eve and the serpent woman he shall not show that now when the Su told that to Eve and Eve accepted it something happened right there Deb stepped in and when she died when a person dies spiritually we will deal with that because both Paul and brother manam deals with it there is a spiritual Deb and there is a physical Deb and the sign of a Dying church is deception and deception is when you cannot discern the difference between what is right and what is wrong amen e did not realize she couldn't discern the difference between reasoning and what the word of God is therefore she was dead now there's another aspect to that de that we will look at let me read for you a little bit if you're thinking in your mind that this is just brother fer brother Bram deals with it and Paul deals with it and here's where we have many Christians they cannot discern and people think well if a man if a church comes and the church is kind of quiet and they're not excited and a lot of movement in the church that church is a dead church and I've heard that all over the time and of course we know that we need a little bit of emotion and we want to shout and we want to praise the Lord but a shouting church does not mean a church is alive don't mistake that amen a church jumping up and long and screaming and screaming that doesn't mean that church Could Be As Dead As Dead can be it is when the Believers of that church has no discernment they cannot see the right from the wrong and this is what happened to Eve and brother Bram deals with it both brother Bram and Paul deals with it and let me go to the scriptures where Paul deals with spiritual de in the church so you can see what we're talking about and then from here we would move slightly into this spiritual death to show you before we move into the deception to show you how and what condition you and I we were all deceived yes that's right amen now some say Amen to that and that's not how you think amen but we prove it I'll prove it we'll bring in the quotes and the scriptures and show it to you thank you Lord okay so now let's go to what Paul says here as a church and an IND as spiritual Deb hit them there are certain symptoms that we see and by the symptoms that we see we know that death is set in and these are not things that we are judging ourselves we go to the word of God to identify this and we have Christians coming to church that literally dead and we get to it in a while what happens is the church dies now not only is the church die but all of us all of us we also died all of us died where did we die we died in Adam because the Bible says as in Adam all died and Paul deals with that now let me let me slow down a little bit on this let me expl a little bit to read for you so that you could see that we all were dead amen all right let's go here and look at Ephesians chap 2 and verse 1-7 and you had he Quicken who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past you walk according to the C of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that work in the children of Disobedience whom are among whom also we all had our conversation in time pass in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and will by nature isur of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherein he loved us even when we were dead in sins had Quicken us together with Christ by Grace he is saved so all of us we were dead and where does that dead go it goes right back to Genesis Genesis amen now a strange thing happened here when Eve opened her heart and she received what the devil did Eve died and not only did she die she took Adam with her and all creation died now the language of the Bible is very strange when it comes to that because the Bible didn't does not tell us that that we all died in Eve because we know that Eve Eve was the mother of all but let me go back and read the scriptures which we just read of course the Bible tells us for as in Adam all died for who as in as in Adam all died but now when God created Adam and Eve God never called Eve Eve God called the both of them Adam and then Adam called Eve Eve so Adam gave her the name of Eve why did Adam call call her Eve because she is the mother of so Eve is a type of all things she types the bride of Christ she types the prostitutes she's the type of all things she's the mother of all Adam is not the father of all because a woman is designed in such a way that she could bring bring forth children from different men a man can only bring a seed from himself yall understand church that's why God is typed as a man a woman could receive seed from different men that's why she could be a prostitute because she could bring forth one child here and another in other words she could bring forth different seeds from different things and that's exactly what happened with Eve she brought forth seeds from different things she brought forth seed from Adam and Seed from the serpent a woman could do it but a man can't she she's designed that way you all understand what I'm saying and brother B said that was the weakness in her oh God help us yes now when the devil came to Eve where did Eve fell the prophet of God says he said she fell because she failed to use the word now if Eve had stood there stand her ground and said listen old old serpent whoever it is talking to me whoever you are talking to me listen what you are saying is not what God Said but the devil brother Bram said studied the human race he spoke about it in the message the conflict between God and Satan he studied the human race so much that he found the weak spot and the weak spot was human reasoning what we call Common Sense and of all the powers that Satan has the prophet of God tell us the most potent power that Satan has is his ability to reason things it looked logical but God did not say it and when he felt he failed to recognize that because when she open her heart to listen to the devil and she begin to receive it from the devil Eve died and Paul gives a warning to the Corinthians and brother bham also give us a warning for this particular age and Paul spoke about it here in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 as he speak about the death of the church church now we would look at debt the debt of the church and the symptoms that we have from the message we have two symptoms from the word of God that identifies a dying church when a church is dying and when an individual is dying you all understand so let's look at it here in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 and Paul speaking here and he says he says he speaking about the Lord's Supper he says here after the same man also he took the cup which when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as he drink it in remembrance of me excuse me for as often as he eat this bread and drink this cup he shall he do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the blood of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth drink damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep brother gram says this many sleep here is really he said in the real translation because in the French it says many are dead and that's exactly what brother brandham says they're dead because they have no ability no capacity to discern the Lord's body now I'm going to go a little deep into that discern the Lord's body all right let's read a little quote what brother bam says concerning this year Discerning the Lord's body and that they are dead are you with are you with me because many Christians has no discernment right any anything H preacher could get up behind the PO and preach anything on the congregation scream amen it's a dead Church let's be honest another thing when they die they fail oh look let me look let me deal with this one first see that's why you have preachers getting up behind the PO and preaching anything and part of the reason is this Body of Christ in the end time is composed of two parts I'm going to read it for you brother says a part of the body is dead and a part is alive the body now if you have life you cannot be deceived and if you have debt you can be deceived if you have debt you deceived am amen because life is light and life comes by the word of God there is no life outside of the word now look no listen listen I know we're making some powerful statements and you might have questions in your mind but let me go to the quotes so you can see for yourself okay in the message Discerning Discerning the spirit of the Lord Brother bam says here we need to discern it by the word the word is right it takes the word God's word is always right we can't discern by what people think what intellectuals tell us what psychiatrists tell us we got to go by What God Says man shall not live by Brother alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God not Discerning the Lord's body many are weak and sick and many are asleep dead spiritually dead the last plague that H Egypt was death brother brother um whisper spoke about that and also so I think brother Paul spoke a little bit about that when they talk about Egypt okay the last he says here the last PL that in Egypt was dead the last PL that hit the church is spiritual death what we need today is a Spiritual Awakening A Spiritual Awakening to discernment what is discernment when you are able to discern this is the word of God and this is the reasoning of man God did not say it it didn't come from God now when this happened with Eve it set the whole human race into debt and then another thing happened that all of us need to look at and I'm going to share a little bit with you and that is the Bible tell us that we all we all went astray because here is something else that happens when spiritual death hits the church right and the sign of a dying man not only does he not able to discern the difference between right and wrong which many people don't realize it you got a dead Church like I told you all before the one preacher told me that he said he was inviting me to come and preach he said mother Fus no worry you can come in and preach anything he said our congregation is strin never to question the ministry now I'm going in there to preach the were dead at that time I did not realize there was a dead church I was preaching too it's not that you want to stand up there and just to show that you're right you know I'm going to go there and question the ministry you know because some people just love to have an argumented Spirit that's not it that's not of the Lord and that's wrong and I've seen it in congregation where people want they love to fight the pastor if they could they love to pre prove that the preacher is wrong if they could that's not the spirit of Christ but when we see something contrary to the word of God we have to be able to have that discernment now how do we have the discernment as the church dies another element comes in when Adam and Eve died in the in the Garden of Eden God came down and what did Adam and Eve do they ran and hid themselves who did they hid themselves from God instead of Adam rushing out to said no let's seek God let's cry out to god let's cry out to God they r hid themselves and brother brandham deals with this as the church dies and in the church ages he mentions that he says that desire to Crow out into the spirit desire to know the word of the Lord to know the word of the Lord all of that Fades so when you have individuals in the church and there's no cry in their hearts to be able to know the word of God there's no cry in their hearts father show me your word show me you will that is a sign of a dead church now um brother Brandon talking about the dead Church here's what he said about it and we're going to go a little deep into it I'm going to have to watch myself now because I'm going to be pretty long on this Israel help me right because I don't want to take too much time because I could go pretty long in this and I don't want to do it but uh here's what brother bam said of it in question and answers here he says now this is a striking thing please don't take it as a Doctrine but do you understand what the scripture says will take place when that did time was over for look there was seven virgins or 10 virgins went out to meet the bridegroom we have Jesus speaking about these 10 vergins in Matthew chapter 25 we will try not to go to Matthew chapter 25 in order to save some time if if we don't have to okay I think all of us are all of the 10 sleeping ver 10 virgins but the B says half of them had Ed their lamp and half of them didn't that's the part of the body that is dead and the part that's alive there's five they went out behold the bridegroom they all trimmed or walk they all trimmed or walk and trimmed their lamps to go into the wedding supper but you see five of them were wise and five were foolish what made These Foolish versions so foolish brother bam spoke about it and spoken with the Original Seed he says the foolish version represented the group that failed to get all in their lamp they didn't go to get the Holy Ghost until it was too late and when a man cannot move to get what God promised him he will not trow for it he will not seek it it's a sign of death and that death hit all of us that's why listen Church it hit all of us that's why when Jesus was here he said search the scriptures search the scriptures so brother bam talking about it he said that cry for reaching out in the spirit that cry for knowing the word of the Lord he talking about the Ephesians it all fading out why the church is dying so you have a church amen when time to come and pray that they will get another filling of the Holy Ghost they will not do it you have a church power of the body is alive and part is dead and then you wonder how come this brother will do it and that brother over here wouldn't do it the one who is not doing it he is spiritually dead it's a sign of death look at Adam and Eve amen you follow me now so people don't know what a dying church is some of them is dead and they're talking about a dead Church imagine the dead sometime the dead calling the church arve dead that's right because they don't even know what that is they're so blind that's why the Bible when when they act spiritual discernment the word of God says they are blind they are so blind that they cannot tell where one one is life and what is death they don't know the difference they see life and call it death you following now when the Bible tells us so we have the body let me go little further with you so you will see brother bam in the church ages he said but notice revelation chapter 21 describe the Lord Jesus as in the midst of the church and holding the messengers in his right hand because his bride has fallen because the church cooperate is now a mix a mixture of true and false he does not leave it it is his and according to Romans 1479 that is exactly right for none of us liveth to himself and no man died to himself for whether do we live we live unto the Lord and whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore die we are the Lords for the for for to this end Christ both died and Rose and revived that he might be both lord of the dead and the living but theam explains that expression he says on the cross he brought the whole world of people they his he is the lord of the living and dead as pertaining to ownership not relationship now he is he is he is the Lord of everything because he owns everything but when you and I come to him and we say to him father is different because a father means we come from him you see a father is something that we are burdened from him we are his genes we are his seed so when we come to him I can say to him father because we come from him you are his child you came from him but now the one over there he can say father father as far as ownership is concerned he own all things he's Lord because he own all things but he has that a relationship that him was Lord because he is is not their lord and he is not their father now I'm not hearing a lot of Amen here but when he is your father you came from him which we will deal with it now what we want to deal with is this brother bam continues he says and he walks in the midst of that body that has within it life and death amen now he calls the foolish vergins although they will be save debt because the foolish version right now does not have life they receive life at the Judgment if they receive life right now they cannot be deceived then they fall in the category of the elect you follow me but brother Bram here in the CH versions he says that the foolish versions is a deceived church now you and I we were deceived and we will deal with that now but once life comes into us we can no longer be deceived for as in Adam all died so in Christ shall all be alive shall all be made what a man that is alive he could see he could tell this is darkness and this is life go to the Grave with the dead man and asking he don't know the difference yes sir he's dead now when we all died in Adam the Bible tells us this which I'll deal with this quickly and then we'll be able to move away from this quickly the Bible plainly tell us that none of us seek God we all went astray it's the nature of man to rebel against God it's his nature you try to tell him brother look repent you know God has all these things for you he stands there and he looks at you he's dead now let me let me read it I'll read for you a couple of scriptures on that of course I don't want to spend too too much time on that but we'll just look at at it in Psalm 53 David in the Psalms he says God looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand that they seek God every one of them is gone back they all become filthy there is none that Doe it good know not one who could say beat their chest and say I am righteous I did good none their very nature is to rebel against God that's right amen and they will rebel against God and they are rebelling against God look Isaiah said the same thing if you want to look at Isaiah chapter 53 and verse 6 and Isaiah says here and as for excuse me and Isaiah says 53:6 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord had laid on him the iniquity the iniquity of us all that was Isaiah the prophet in the Old Testament that's why they all go astray I don't care who they are he might be a preacher in the buet he might be a deacon he might be a song leader yes whoever he is he all they all went astray and then brother bam told us something he I want to share with you are you following yes or am I getting it am I I don't know if I'm getting it a little bit too choppy or whatever huh is it all right all right and that's why what brother whisper preached last night is so essential on the new birth because the prophet made a statement on that and he says you will never agree on the word word of God until you're born again never listen listen Trish I tell you you on his truth we ministers a true Minister we don't trying to get the people to agree with us that's not our purpose right that's right you think I want you even me I don't even want to agree with myself I want to agree with God that's where he made the mistake that's what the Holy Ghost is trying to do is to reconcile us to what am not only to each other but to [Music] God you see we want to die to our own ideas I don't want my idea no if an idea is in Me God help me I don't want it amen I want to pray and say God deliver me from that you want to you do the same we all have that design in our hearts you see it sometime a brother might see something different to me he look what brother Ferguson this is something here and I look at it this might be something here I might not see it the way that he sees it and then I say Lord God Of Heaven Am I Wrong show me father because if he could bring me something I want to be right and we all want to be right we want and if we are wrong we want to be corrected see I don't want to deviate too much but you know to just to show you the nature of human beings how they go contrer you know they all went astray see and we drifted all of us I remember there was there was but Paul there was a little Baptist preacher out there in up in Vermillion Bay up in Northwestern Haron got up there at the church several I went in there and baptized a little sister I call sister maryan and it created a big Stern area one person I baptized imagine that and he got up on the radio this Baptist preach he said these cult leaders he said this George Ferguson coming in from Montreal call me by my name he says um to deceive the people he said he's a deceiver of men S A friend of mine at that time he was he owned a a big company up there called Red Lake Lumber and the government of Ontario had given him the rights to exploit 60 square meter 100 kilometers square kilometers of line so he was logging and Stuff AC course that businessman in the bankruptcy and stuff after anyway I flew in there because I used to fish on lakes and stuff up there and so I flew in there one day and I went up to this Baptist preacher home and I knocked in the door at that time we didn't have cell phones and stuff you know so he opened the door Saturday morning so there were some of the members of his church day he was having a Bible study with them so I told him I said you the pastor yes I says well good day Pastor I says I'm George Ferguson he says you you who I said I'm George Ferguson I says you're the pastor he said yes I says I heard it you appreci that I'm wrong he said yes he said you're false he said you're wrong I said all right I says I come for you to correct me I says I promise you I'll come into the house take your Bible show me anything that you see in the Bible where I'm wrong I says and I promise you I will I'll accept it I says not your explanation not your interpretation but I says anything he says no I will not open the Bible with you I say sir I says you believe I'm wrong yes you're wrong I says then please help me if you think I'm wrong no I will not discuss the Bible the two preachers couldn't you would two preachers they couldn't stand in in with you he said so I will not open the Bible he says one Methodist and one menite he said one Methodist and one menite preacher he said I said well sir I says all I'm asking is you believe I'm wrong yes you're wrong I says but please help me I says I promise you I'll come I'll sit I'll listen no I will not open the Bible with you I says well I cannot force you to correct me I says well I turn as members in the church and said God bless you I says God bless you Pastor and I left well two weeks later brother Paul there was a sister um that brother who was with me there his aunt was going to that church and she told him afterward she said two weeks later the congregation told her pastor you called a man a cult leader he came all the way here for you to correct him you refused to correct him we cannot have a apostle like you find yourself another church and he kicked him out now you know sometimes we don't know the ways of God is is different and God knows exactly what he was doing amen so all of us went astray and if we as we deviated there was nothing in us to seek God we all went after our own thoughts our own minds we all went and then what happened what did God do Jesus came he came to seek and to save that which was lost so you take an individual here all of the children the prophet of God says take a a kid don't teach him right around just leave alone and he will choose wrong why because it's the nature it's the nature in mind to Rebel he can't help himself he's born like that and this all goes right back to the beginning with Adam and Eve so we were we all went astray and that's the entire human race there is none that doeth good no not one and that's why the prophet of God tells us here and of course brother whisper was speaking about it and I thought that that was just um that was just so nice when you mentioned that concerning the um the um what he mentioned concerning the the new birth last night because the prophet tells us here and let me just read it for you quickly are you with me this morning well you're a little bit quiet on me this morning usually you are on me on Sunday mornings that's all right but I'm going to read it for you it's in the Statue of a perfect man and brother whisper really went deep into that and let's see the statue of perfect man let me see here maybe I'm missed I'm missing it somehow uh just excuse me here just one second and he says you will never you will never agree on the word of God until you're born again I wanted to read it for you and goodness I I had it here and huh on the screen on the screen yes here it is yeah just go wrong a little bit brother let's read it here he said brother whisper read it he says first you must be born again and then when you are born again you have faith you believe the word until you born again you'll argue you will do what AR when you hear them arguing against it why do you think they're arguing against it amen you will say well he's got a different IDE it to me no it's simply because he's still dead it's not that he's aging with you he's aging against the word because if you if you bring the word and you says brother here here here's the word of God read it yourself like what I did with the bah remember my my remember my bah story I don't want to go back into that again you're looking at me kind of strange now remember my B story amen huh amen how many how many of you all never heard my B story oh my I don't want to I don't want to go into that many so you but whisper you never heard that b story where I'm in trouble all right I I'll go quick we were at the meetings once brother Paul and coming into our church was a bah so after the service he came up to me and told me he says I am a bah well what he didn't know is that I know what the bah believe so I told him I said well I know that you know the Muslims killed bahah Baha the founder of of the bah Church in Jerusalem I said I don't agree with them murdering him he said yes he was a mar because the bah believe in what is called the evolution of religions so they believe in Hinduism the Hindus and then the Muslim the Christians and then the Muslim and the final Revolution they said is a b anyway so I know what they believe so I told him I says I says you I said Do you believe all the Bible he said yes I believe all the Bible I said sure to be a good B you have to believe all the Bible he say sure he said I believe all the Bible I says do you believe that the fullness of the godhead was in Jesus Christ he says no I don't believe that of course I know that the B doesn't believe that I know that so I says well if if I show you a scripture where the Bible says that the fullness of the garden was in Jesus Christ would you accept it he said the Bible doesn't say that I says but if the Bible say it would you accept accept it he said well if the Bible say it he says I will accept it he said because the Bible doesn't say it I said but if the Bible say it would you accept it he said yes he said if the Bible said he says I will accept it I says give me your word as a b that if the Bible said it you will accept it he said to me I give you my word and I that if the Bible said it I would accept it but I didn't wanted to take the chance I open my bible to Colossians chapter 2 and I handed him my Bible because brother PA I didn't wanted to take the chance I didn't want brother whisper to read it because he could said I'm reading something into the Bible so I wanted him to read it so he opened the Bible he began to read where the Bible says here in Colossians chapter 2 and verse 8 it says beware I said read it iist read it loud he said read it loud beware as any man SPO you true philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of man after the rements of the world and not after Christ and then the second verse he said be for in him God all the fullness of the godhead B and ready right back he closed the Bible he looked at me he says I know the with you I said I said you don't agree with me I said you just read it in the Bible he says no no no no no no I says you just read it in the Bible you read it in the Bible he said if I accept it I would have to give up my mind I says then give it up then you me he says no no no he says no no no and out of the church he ran saying no no no and some of the little children you know they're talking at one another to make promises and one little kid told you the kid he says I don't want your word as a I do not want your word but that's how human beings are this is not just limited to the B you see and we go back to that quote and until the you take a preacher behind the prophet he might have a a wonderful Ministry yes was say gifts and cording of repentance he may have a wonderful Ministry to preach but unless that man is born again he will never agree with the word why doesn't why wouldn't he never agree with the word because Paul says as an Adam all died so in Christ only in Christ in Christ will all be made will all be made amen outside of Christ there is no life outside of Christ we are dead you see a church and then in him we find our life now as we find our life in him we want to come to this point now quickly of the deception you and I let me read it again for you all right it's in Titus you can put it on the board brother Titus amen Titus Chapter 3 for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient let's read it together could we read it together no it's not brother Ferguson now could we read it all together for for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceive see serving diverse lust and Pleasures living in Malice and envy hateful and hating one another how were you deceived now we look at the reconciliation of God to reconcile us so we're going to go into the message to see that when God deals with sin there two statements two words in the Bible that describe and Jesus speak about it how God deals with sin are you following one of those words is pardon or forgiveness Jesus speak about it himself self in Matthew 12 and verse 51-32 if we want to look at the scriptures quickly all right and here is when God calls a man the first thing is that God deals with the man in Repentance in order to forgive him of his sins now God forgives you of your sins and in Matthew chapter 12 are you following Matthew chapter 12 here and verse 31-32 Jesus speaking and he says wherefore I say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speak it against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world need in the world to come so all there is forgiveness for all manner of sins except the blasphemy of the Holy Ghost we're all aware of that but then the Bible also speak Paul spoke about it in Romans 5 and verse1 he says therefore being justified by faith and justification and pardon does not mean the same thing now let us look quickly at this and trust the Lord it will help you that you can see the deception when God forgives you are you following me now right now it might sound a little bit complicated it might sound a little bit difficult but we're going to make it simple in a little bitty bit all right now I'm a little bit choppy this morning with what I'm speaking but I really trust the Lord that it it's it helps you is that all right amen all right now brother brandham talking about it here is what he said I'm sorry I I'm just having a little difficulty to get my quotes because I didn't have my print out copies usually I'm I'm ready with my print out copies but I'm just having a little bit of a difficulty so please just bear with me is that all right all right I got it here it's in the invis Union of the Bride I'm going to read it for you but maybe before I read it there's something else I wanted to share oh God help me here Lord help me here just pray for me this morning all right all right that the Lord will already help me I wish I could have it like brother whisper and brother brother Paul Duron I remember brother Billy Paul used to say to me he said watch him when he begin to get those notes and he can't find him brother B always used to tease me on that one see but um um I I trust it will be a help to you now let's look at this word here forgiveness when God pardons you of your sins okay and the word pardon if you try to say in hurry what does the word pardon means does anyone know when God pardon you what does he do does anyone know huh he forgives you but what is the pardon huh huh no that's justification all right I'm going to read it for you it's an experience when you go to Pardon he says in the message all things he all things we can speak of all things but all things are house through Christ and if he Spar not his own son to bring this to us how much more will it will he bring it if we willing to receive it now I can't speak of all things but I want to speak of one certain thing of all these things and I think that's an important thing that is pardon I love the word pardon actually the word means don't forget this now a release from guilt so what is the pardon I want to ask you a question are there Christians in the meeting here that are still feeling guilty are you still guilty well you're quiet this morning are you guilty or aren't you guilty guilty not guilty how could you be guilty if you're pardon all right let's go little further actually the word means the Reas some guilt now let me share a little experience with you let's take our brother Geor he's a good friend of mine and we love him a lot okay come R George let's see brother George and I have a little fight and brother George punched me now brother George is bigger than me see boy I wouldn't you know that time SP a lot of punch in it see yes sir let see he punches me and oh my and then he says to me but the first would you forgive me for it I said yeah said I forgive you for it I forgive you yes but you know you know R George you did it see you did it you did it wouldn't do it but you brother George you did [Laughter] it so you're just an example see uh so brother bam says but then there's a difference because when God forgives you he's not just saying sister Molly H sister Holly thank you li see that's why you know I tell you something my wife and my daughters corrects me sometime I pronunciation and my little daughter my she loves to correct me when she was a little girl anytime I make a mistake and she would love to just correct Daddy when he's wrong to see so you know they're just sweethearts and Sharon's somewhere in the back too Sharon even joined in the freight too and she'd correct me sometimes but she's a little bit prudent you know when she corrects me on my pronunciation but Mama lets me know and that's good so let's say if God would look at her and you would have said sister Holly because of my great love for you I forgive you now I could say to brother George I forgive you but when God forgives it is not just a word it's not just you and I reading a Bible I'm forgiven it is an experience and brother Bram says here and what an experience that is to every everyone who has had an experience of it to be released from yeah how you released then you can say Lord oh you can lift your hands could you lift your hands this morning and said father I thank you I glorify you because I have been released from guilt all right amen we can go on on that but I'm going to spend more time on it but then when you really when you pardon there something goes with pardon how do you know you're pardoned I release how do you know you're pardoned How Do You Know You released some guilt feel it no it's not just that you feel it it's more than that who knows how you know that how do I know that God forgive me of my sins forgiveness yes but he said it to many people and they will not to never receive it how do you know you receive it accept a oh my wow all right let me give you the answer I W keep you in suspense but please church don't forget these things amen it's very important because when you go before the Lord as you walk as a Christians you want to meditate on these things do not let these things slip from your mind now here there's one more thing I like to speak of here in our pardon and that is after we receive pardon that's in the message all things paragraph 126 you could project it on the board for us if you could there's one more thing I'd like to speak of here in our pardon and that is after we receive our pardon we receive Purity with that pardon that's what that's what John says when he says that he is faithful to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us so brother says now if you just making out now he says here that is after we receive our pardon we receive Purity with that pardon now if you're just making out like you got pardoned you haven't got Purity now you say how can you prove that brother bandam then brother manam goes on to express it so if you receive pardon and a release from guilt how do you know that God has farted you is when you are cleansed of that sin now if that sin is still in your life and you not cleansed from that sin you cannot claim pardon because when God releases you from guilt there is an experience and in that experience of being released from sin is a purity that's what Peter is saying he is faithful enough to to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness so when we claim that God God has forgiven us when we claim that we have been released from guilt which is a wonderful experience then without release of guilt is a Deliverance is a purity that comes in our lives praise God Amen and amen and amen and amen all right now that is wonderful amen and to God we give praise honor and thanks for that that God has given us Purity amen all right but now let's take a step we're going to take a step further than that because when we get into God forgiveness excuse me here I'm getting my things mixed up here please pray for me that the Lord will help me amen when we go into this we go to we take another step and I'm going to try to finish in a little bit I won't keep you too long we take another step and that is we go into what we call justification being justified by faith all right let's see what brother BR says and then we're going to tie it up to show you the deception in a little bit are you ready all right now let's see here all right now we now we have it now you remember that the Bible speak about the book of life now we're not going to go into the book of life it's going to be a too long and too you know too deep for us to go into now so there's there's one book of life the Lamb's Book of Life and it has two parts to it yes one part contains your natural life before you were born again see and it's a record The Book of Life is a record it's called a book of life it's got names in it but it's a record it's record so we go here he says now your old book is gone with your old Unions that's your old book because a part of that book names could be released could be released from it are you following or are you sleeping all right so that part is gone so now you're going to the new book your new life in Christ now he says now your name is in your old has been transferred now you say do you mean to tell me that my old book God put it in the sea of forgetfulness you stand perfectly before God but bom goes on and on and on I'm going to skip some of that he says now you are not only forgiven brother but you're you what let's say it together you are Justified and he says here Glory justification Romans 51 says yeah Romans 51 says therefore being justified by faith Look up the word the word doesn't mean forgiven justification doesn't mean forgiven forgiven is a release of guilt but justification doesn't mean that at all that's right and that is why the denominational Church that preach forgiveness does not have the revelation of justification even when Luther preached justification there was still a mystery around it and that mystery stayed until this day and then brother brandham in The Invisible Union of the bride and in the Rapture message after the open of the seals open up to us what justification is so he says here he said Look up the word justification the word doesn't mean forgiven the word means Justified it does not mean you're forgiven for instance you heard I got drunk and done some evil things and everything then you come around and say to me you found out I didn't do them then you come and say brother brandom I forgive you forgive me I didn't do it at the first place see now if I didn't if I did do it I'm guilty you could but you could forgive me and I wouldn't and I wouldn't be guilty so if you forgive me then I'm not I'm I won't be guilty but yet I'm not justified because I actually did it so if I did something and I'm forgiven I am not justified you all understand please church it's so important if I did something like brother George come and he punched me come back come back brother George all right all right brother George I forgive you but he can never be justified why because he did it he could be forgiven but not justified so if you did wrong you did wrong in the eyes of God you could be forgiven but oh Church please got it please all right you can be forgiven but you cannot Bei all right now listen brother bam continues but the word justification is though you never did it amen it's not even regarded at all how is it done in God's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book and marriage is divorced and dead it's not even in the memories of God Amen you are Justified therefore being justified it was accused you were accused you were accused let's say it together let's put ourselves there better B says put yourself there I was accused but I I never did it so when you never did it then you're Justified that's right now let's go a little further you were accused you never done it in the first place the old Union is in the sea of God's forgetfulness you wasn't married to it to begin with he the bridegroom bore your shame I wish we had time to go into that to show you what happened back there with Eve and Adam but we won't have enough time he took your place for he was predestinated for him to be in his for you were pred he took your place where you were predestinated for him to be in his bride therefore before the foundation of the world the Bible say says you were predestinated seed all right so you didn't do it how come all of this happened then brother random goes right back now to what Paul is saying he says how did you come to do this you were deceived into it you were what you were deceived into sin here the prophet goes on you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent Eve it is no fault of your own could you raise your hand and give God praise for [Music] thaten by your natural birth you come after the thief who committed adultery that's the reason you were born an adulterer you you a sinner to begin with that's right you were deceived into it you had no you it ain't your fault you never did it that's now if we say this when God determined you never did it then God say you are but if God says you're forgiven then that aspect of the word of God is saying you did it and you're guilty therefore you're forgiven so the Bible deals with these two aspects of God dealing with sin you're forgiven you're Justified but God forgives you are you listening God forgives you you forgiven yes sir all right you can say Lord I'm forgiven and then what happened as he forgives you for what you did he justifies you and when he justifies you he declares that you never did then you say how could it be how could it be amen that God could say I never did it it it has nothing do with you and I I would remember you did it yes sir you could remember you I did it but God says no you didn't do it and then when the nature of Jesus Christ comes in us when as we are transformed we are changed we are transformed for what we were into the nature of Jesus Christ then the Bible in the Book of James tell us man could justify we can justify one another by the works we see God justify you because you believe in him I can justify you because I see The Works in you and a lot of Christians are not justifying one another when we supposed to justify based on the works all right oh my look I I think I'm losing you am I am well look the Bible says being justified by faith amen and then James says we're justified by works brother bam says we justify based on the fact man justify you based on the fact of what he sees one is man justifying you the other is God justifying you let me give an example Amen brother George comes let's take him again that's my friend all right let's say I say brother George okay I forgive you but then I keep you know it's in my mind it's in my mind all the time every time I see oh boy he punched me and then one day something happened to me I decide now I got to forget about all of this Lord help me I forget about it I have to see my brothers if he's he's he's forgiven he didn't do it brother George no brother you made a mistake there he didn't mean to do it and it was not your fault now he's Justified I can justify him brother George it was no fault of yours brother true brother you know you did it was not your fault you made a mistake yes amen amen amen and there has to come a time when we got to be able to justify one [Applause] another hallelujah hallelujah yes sir not just forgive sir but yes you said brother Ferguson I never thought of that that's in the Bible That's in the message right Aaliyah huh that's my granddaughter see right Kisha that's my door see God turns around and he he justifies you and then you can justify one another amen you could even justify a pastor by the works now if there's no works in the man you can't justify him right right right you you don't see repentance in him you don't see a desire to change you can't justify him that's good that's good but when you see the man that's what the Bible says the prophet said it you see the man he repent of his sins but B says when he comes to the Altar and repent of his sins he said if you don't forgive him you should go to the altar yourself there has to come a time and the church has to move forward in the message in the revelation of the message am and we have little grudges against one another when we hold these things in our hearts yes sir he did it to me old brother George you he gets up there and say he's a Christian he said he love the Lord and boy one day he got mad at me and boy he smacked me across my face but I forgive him you know we brother Ram we got to go beyond that now amen he came and he made it right and by The Works he did I according to the scriptures should not only forgive him but I should justify him why I have to act like God I have to follow the footsteps of God where God forgive I forgive where God Justified I have to step in too we canot we canot separate ourselves from God in that way in the work of redemption God brings us in to us is given also the ministry of reconcil ilation God brings us into it we have a part to play we have a role to play and our part is important to God that's why Jesus says if you do not forgive your heavenly father will not forgive you but then we go a step further to not only do we forgive we [Applause] justify do you see it amen now the next part of the message I cannot go into we will not have I shared it with the ministers and we will not have time to secret to go into it right Israel we got to let you all go it's almost 1:00 all right huh well they're going to p on me only if you say what that part I told them I want to stop here the part of the message I shared maybe you could share it with them on you know the mistakes of the Prophet we won't have enough time so I need to stop huh right so you better come so the ministers will probably share it with you so I give them that privilege right brother Paul all right do you love him with all your heart now let me ask you this we don't want to be like the the Dead Sea receiving the waters and not given that's it it's called The Dead Sea for nothing it's not called the Dead Sea for nothing it's dead so we don't be hearing the meeting just receiving that's why Jesus says when you pray you know you forgive and if God justify you what would you justifying he said brother fuson I didn't realize I could justify my brother yeah you could say brother George you didn't mean it brother you really didn't mean it it was not your fault you know I heard Christians say that when I say that I told myself it's so nice for them to say that they talk to one another said you know he repented he asked me to forgive him and truly speaking he did it but you know it was not his fault he made a mistake and he really didn't mean to do it but Bram said you could say that all your life Lord God Of Heaven I did not mean to do it prise the Lorden now there are some things you want to forget amen amen there's some things you want to forget you listen to baseball who won and who didn't want for you could forget that but these points that you're hearing today is important for you because they determine your walk with God so when you do anything that's not right you could come before the Lord and say I did not mean to do it why because you did not do it wellfully you did it because you were deceived into it that's the deception that Paul is talking about you see it see and it goes right back to who to Eve that's you see a church and you could say Lord I didn't mean to do it forgive me Father I didn't mean to do it the first thing you did you said Lord forgive me amen I don't say Lord justify me I said Lord forgive me and then he forgives me and he makes the decision I justify you I ask for forgiveness you ask for forgiveness he justify now you come to me and says brother Ferguson justify me no if brother George hit me smack bup in my face but brother Ferguson just no he said I did it brother Ferguson but I didn't mean to do it now brother I accept what you say you forgiven by his works I justify him wonderful isn't he Israel come along all right do you love him with all your heart isn't he precious oh praise the name of the Lord amen you know I've asked the church sometimes I said why do you all stay quiet in me this said brother Ferguson we want to get every word with you're saying it's so precious and that's why we still are quiet and then you know I understand uh God God bless you all I want to say this I love you all with all my heart and what your pastor said this morning means a lot to to me and I've been coming among you all and it's what I did with veratu in Paris you know veratu started off many years ago and he was a little bashful little Christian boy and I saw him back there maybe 35 years ago Chris Cross in Paris and he was just a little bashful person and he would I met him you know and it was very hard in Paris at the time no message Church nothing I said right at you because I saw that Ministry in him I said where at you God will use you he said me brother F he says I don't think so I said where at you God will use you and every time I criss cross Paris I went to visit with him you know exalted the church helped him and his the Lord blessed him and his church grew into the largest church in all of Europe of the message you see how God has blessed him and I look at Israel and see you know when Israel was there I I encourag him here in tcon Israel I want to encourage you you know I could see not because he's my son-in-law it has nothing to do with the flesh I could have seen something that was in in him amen I saw that and what I saw now you see it manifest in itself and how happy I am to come and to see that Amen to see a little germ to see that seed as it come to flation and it come to full manifestation how happy we are as we glorify the lord it's not what we are it's what he has made us amen what he has determined for us to be and we love one another with a love that's eternal love amen that nothing could ever separate that love in our hearts amen how wonderful amen because God has given us friends you know I could look at like I look at brother W but a whisper and I could say but a whisper you're my friend I could say I choose but a whisper to be a friend that's my choice but when God brings us his friends then that's a friendship for all eternity amen nothing going separate us amen that's why when the Bible says there's nothing to separate us from the love of Christ look if I take Israel here is finishing up now he's got the love of God I got the love of God we love one another what could separate us what could separate the love of God nothing let's stand as we pray Lord we thank you for this service this morning thank you for your love Lord thank you for the word Lord as we leave this meeting we could see that you Justified us and help us father that we could also step into that realm of justification to be able to justify by works as we see the works the true scriptural works in the life of a man Lord we could said Lord let let justify him as we see your Holy Spirit working in the new birth to make us agree with you to make us agree with your word Lord we can't do it on our own we cannot line up on our own we need you to help us and we thank you that you're doing it Lord we thank you for the work that you've done in our
