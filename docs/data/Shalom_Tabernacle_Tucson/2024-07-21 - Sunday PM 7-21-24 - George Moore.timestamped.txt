[39:31] sound booth back there we got a husband
[39:33] and wife Doo back there and man they've
[39:35] done a fantastic job
[39:38] today amen and so I'm so grateful for
[39:42] that and you know whatever your hands
[39:43] fine to do let's do it with all that's
[39:46] in us right now Galatians the 6th
[39:48] chapter Brethren if a man be overtaken
[39:51] in a fault ye which are spiritual
[39:53] restore such a one in the spirit of
[39:55] meekness consider in thyself lest thou
[39:59] also be tempted bear ye one another's
[40:03] burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ
[40:07] for if a man thinketh himself think
[40:09] himself to be something when he is
[40:12] nothing he deceiveth himself but every
[40:16] let every man prove his own work and
[40:20] then shall he have rejoicing in himself
[40:23] alone and not in another for every man
[40:26] shall bear his own burden let him that
[40:29] is taught in the word communicate unto
[40:31] him that teacheth in all good things be
[40:34] not deceived God is Not mocked for
[40:38] whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also
[40:42] reap we talked about that this morning
[40:44] this is a law Saints good or bad he that
[40:47] sth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
[40:52] corruption but he that sth to the spirit
[40:54] shall of the spirit reap life
[40:57] Everlasting and let us not be weary in
[41:01] wello for in due season we shall
[41:05] reap if we faint not and as we have
[41:09] therefore opportunity let us do good
[41:12] unto all
[41:15] men especially unto them who are of the
[41:18] household of faith and may the Lord add
[41:22] His blessings to the reading of the word
[41:23] God bless you may be seated and uh we
[41:26] just want to continue up
[41:28] uh or complete that thought this uh that
[41:30] we had this morning of your season is
[41:32] coming and so we'll continue down that
[41:35] Avenue tonight uh just for a little
[41:37] short message and then finish up so good
[41:40] to be here with you I I should be able
[41:42] to uh to preach better this evening than
[41:45] I did this morning because Sister Lisa
[41:49] made me a sister Lisa made me a pean pie
[41:53] and so uh I'm going brother Chuck on the
[41:55] strength of that pecan pie this
[41:57] afternoon and and uh so that was uh that
[42:02] was a blessing but we're looking forward
[42:04] God has appointed us a season is that
[42:08] right and God has actually
[42:12] appointed whatever season you're in
[42:15] right
[42:16] now uh whether it be a good season or a
[42:20] tough season or a wet season or a dry
[42:23] season or whatever time it is God has a
[42:27] pointed that that you might go through
[42:29] it right now so you might not enjoy the
[42:33] season that you're in right now maybe
[42:35] you're in a good season maybe you're not
[42:37] but if you're not uh you might not be
[42:39] enjoying that season but it has been a
[42:43] pointed to you and we know Romans 8:28
[42:47] says all things work together for good
[42:50] to them that love God and to them who
[42:53] are called according to his purpose and
[42:56] you say well brother George you don't
[42:58] understand I'm so nervous right now I'm
[43:00] so anxious right now there's such a
[43:03] pressure in my life there's there's
[43:05] everything all these decisions to make
[43:07] and I've got so much going on you don't
[43:09] understand I know that uh I may not
[43:12] understand exactly where you're at but I
[43:14] know I've been close and I do know that
[43:17] even though it's not fun to go through
[43:19] it's still exactly according to his
[43:22] purpose can you say Amen to that tonight
[43:25] now we tend to to gravitate toward the
[43:28] more enjoyable things and we we like to
[43:32] talk about the blessings of God we like
[43:34] to talk about all the good things that
[43:36] the Lord does for us brother Levi and
[43:39] that Ecclesiastes that we read this
[43:40] morning if you read the good stuff in
[43:43] there it says that a man we like to talk
[43:45] about when something's born or or
[43:47] something's planted or something's
[43:49] healed or something's built up or or it
[43:52] said that there was a time to laugh
[43:54] there was a time to dance there was a
[43:56] time to gather together there was a time
[43:59] to embrace there was a time to get and a
[44:02] time to keep and a time to sew and a
[44:05] time to speak and a time to love and a
[44:09] time of peace and those are God's
[44:11] blessings upon us Saints and I've felt
[44:14] those blessings throughout my life since
[44:16] I gave my heart to the Lord but just as
[44:19] important as those things are the other
[44:23] things may be more important because the
[44:25] Bible said that to try
[44:27] of your faith worketh patience and that
[44:30] and that those things are more precious
[44:32] to you than gold so so greater maybe
[44:35] even than those things are the other
[44:37] side of that Ecclesiastes 3 that said
[44:40] there's a time to die there's a time
[44:43] we're going to have to deal with death
[44:44] Saints death is a part of life and loss
[44:47] is a part of living and and we find
[44:49] there's a time to die and there's a time
[44:52] to pluck up that what's planted There's
[44:54] A Time to Kill a time to break down a
[44:57] time to weep a time to mourn a time to
[45:00] Cast Away a time to refrain from
[45:03] embracing a time to lose Saints A Time
[45:06] To Lose A Time To to uh to Rend and a
[45:10] time to keep silent and a time to hate
[45:13] and a time of War I'll tell you I I was
[45:15] talking to a young brother the other day
[45:17] and he felt like he had a calling of God
[45:19] on his heart and and he felt like that
[45:21] the Lord wanted him to preach the gospel
[45:23] and he was asking me for advice and and
[45:26] I just told told him I said well young
[45:27] man you know you just got to seek the
[45:29] Lord on that and I told him what brother
[45:31] brandom said about about you you know
[45:33] remain neutral and you pray and just
[45:35] what we talked about this morning and he
[45:37] said all right brother George I'll try
[45:38] to do that and he said I I just don't
[45:40] know he said I've been doing some Bible
[45:42] studies and and he said the first couple
[45:44] of three Bible studies I did he said and
[45:47] I got done with those Bible studies I
[45:49] said there ain't no way God's called me
[45:51] to anything he said it just felt like it
[45:53] was a failure it felt like it didn't go
[45:55] anywhere it felt like I felt flat on my
[45:57] face and uh he said but after that he
[45:59] said about a week later he said the Lord
[46:01] would start dealing with me again I said
[46:03] Son probably the best thing that could
[46:05] happen to you would be for you to fall
[46:07] flat on your face because if you come
[46:10] into something and you start if he you
[46:12] know if God call you to something you
[46:13] started preaching the gospel and it just
[46:15] went great all the time and it went
[46:17] great from the very beginning and
[46:19] everything went wonderful for you you'd
[46:21] probably think you were good you'd
[46:22] probably think that that that that the
[46:24] Lord would blessing you and you had such
[46:26] a gift and and you'd probably think that
[46:28] that sort of thing but God lets you fail
[46:31] sometimes and he lets you lose sometimes
[46:34] and he let those things happen so that
[46:36] you realize that you are completely
[46:39] incapable outside of the Lord Jesus
[46:43] Christ come on somebody tonight y'all
[46:46] didn't lay down on me this morning don't
[46:48] lay down tonight now we we just got a
[46:50] little longer to
[46:51] go so we find that it's all into the
[46:54] hands of the Lord
[46:57] amen and we find then saints that
[46:59] sometimes God lets us go through things
[47:02] that that are not uh they're not good
[47:04] it's not they're not fun but it's all
[47:06] according to his purpose and so when I
[47:08] read those two things from Ecclesiastes
[47:10] one which one of them sounds like a
[47:12] better
[47:14] evening but but which one of them is
[47:16] ordered of the Lord they both are amen
[47:20] one sounds like a lot more fun than the
[47:22] other but they're both ordered of God
[47:24] brother Chris they both have a purpose
[47:27] and they both have a reason now if
[47:29] you'll turn withen in your Bibles to
[47:30] First Peter the first chapter we'll find
[47:33] that uh that the Bible says 1 Peter the
[47:36] 1 chapter the third verse
[47:39] says blessed be the God and father of
[47:42] our Lord Jesus Christ which according to
[47:45] His abundant
[47:46] Mercy has begotten unto
[47:49] us begotten us again unto a lively Hope
[47:54] by the resurrection oh God yeah begotten
[47:59] unto us again unto a lively Hope by the
[48:02] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[48:04] dead to an inheritance
[48:07] Incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth
[48:10] not away reserved in heaven for you so
[48:15] so he has he's begotten you to that he's
[48:18] he's he's placed you into that there is
[48:20] an inheritance waiting for you there
[48:23] that isn't corruptible that that that
[48:25] that doesn't fade away way that's
[48:27] Eternal that's all oh God when I think
[48:30] about it Saints and he says who are kept
[48:33] by the power of God through faith under
[48:36] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[48:38] last time Saints we ain't keeping us
[48:40] he's keeping us we're not the ones
[48:42] hanging on he is hanging on
[48:45] Amen and he says the trial that the
[48:48] trial of your faith let me back up
[48:51] number six wherein ye greatly Rejoice
[48:55] though now for a season
[48:57] if need be ye are in heaviness through
[49:00] manifold Temptations now you may not be
[49:03] there tonight maybe you are but every
[49:04] one of us knows what manifold
[49:07] Temptations feels like M multifaceted
[49:10] coming from every angle Temptations and
[49:13] tests and trials coming from all
[49:15] different angles to us and he says
[49:17] rejoice in the season of those manifold
[49:21] temptations that the trial of your faith
[49:24] being much more precious than that of of
[49:26] gold that perisheth though it be tried
[49:29] with fire might be found unto praise and
[49:31] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[49:33] Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye
[49:36] love in whom now uh now though now you
[49:41] see him not yet believing you rejoice
[49:44] with joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[49:47] receiving at the end of your faith even
[49:49] a Salvation of your souls so the Bible
[49:53] tells us to Rejoice going through these
[49:55] Temptations because is working a work in
[49:58] us that will reward us when he
[50:02] appears now to everything there is a
[50:05] season and everything there is a time
[50:07] appointed and some seasons are wonderful
[50:10] and others are really hard and sometimes
[50:13] you're on top of the world and other
[50:14] times you don't know how you're going to
[50:16] make it through the rest of the day come
[50:18] on somebody every sometimes you don't
[50:20] know but sometimes everything's going
[50:22] good but all of them good or bad are
[50:25] temporary
[50:27] so when things are going great praise
[50:30] God but don't get too comfortable
[50:32] because it's only for a
[50:35] season but when everything's going wrong
[50:38] don't get too discouraged because that's
[50:40] only for a season
[50:42] also can is that right tonight Saints so
[50:45] you're going to make it one way or
[50:47] another you're going to make it because
[50:49] there's a place reserved for
[50:52] you amen this too shall pass amen amen
[50:57] your marriage might have ups and downs
[50:59] but it's only for a season if
[51:01] everything's going great that's
[51:03] wonderful it might not go great for long
[51:05] before there's going to be a downtrend
[51:07] and and if everything's going wrong
[51:09] that's only for a season so we got to
[51:11] understand that up or down everything is
[51:14] constant in Jesus
[51:16] Christ your health might be up and down
[51:20] I've been sick and I've been healed I've
[51:22] been well and I've been sick Saints it's
[51:24] all up and down but it's always in the
[51:27] hands of Jesus Christ whether I feel
[51:30] good or whether I feel bad I'm still a
[51:32] child of God
[51:34] today your family might have ups and
[51:37] downs there's times where everybody gets
[51:39] along better than others but it's all in
[51:42] the hands of Jesus Christ today your job
[51:44] might have ups and downs but it's only
[51:47] for a season and it's always in the
[51:49] hands of Jesus Christ now it's hard when
[51:52] you're in the middle of the battle to
[51:54] see the end it's hard when you're in in
[51:56] the middle sometimes the saying is you
[51:58] can't see the forest for the trees
[52:01] sometimes you just got to back away a
[52:02] little bit and look at what God is doing
[52:05] but don't be discouraged because it's
[52:07] only for a season now the Bible said he
[52:10] made all things beautiful in his
[52:16] time is that right Saints and your
[52:19] season is coming it's not just a a
[52:22] promise of Deliverance and overcoming
[52:24] Victory although there is a a victory
[52:26] ictory coming for you there's always
[52:28] another Victory coming there's always
[52:30] something else for you to overcome it is
[52:32] a promise of that but it's also a
[52:34] sobering reminder that if we're we're in
[52:37] a season of Plenty there's probably a
[52:39] drought coming sometime soon also so we
[52:42] don't want to get too high and we don't
[52:44] want to get too low we want to just good
[52:46] or bad leave it in the hands of the Lord
[52:50] now wers of unity paragraph 40 he says
[52:52] this he says I've had the privilege of
[52:55] standing in Rome where the that great
[52:58] Caesar who tried to unite the world
[53:00] under the Roman Empire and today you
[53:02] have to dig 20 feet down to find the
[53:05] ruins of that City and I stood in Egypt
[53:08] where the great pharaohs that tried to
[53:10] unite the world under Egypt and dig down
[53:13] 20 and 30 feet to find the ruins of that
[53:15] City for here we have no continuing City
[53:20] says the Bible but we seek one to come
[53:23] we seek an inheritance in corrupted
[53:28] he says but not long ago when at one uh
[53:31] at one when I one time went out to a
[53:34] place that I was a little boy I seen a
[53:37] great tree where I used to go and sit
[53:39] under that tree and I said when I'm an
[53:42] old man I'll come back and sit under
[53:44] this certain tree and I'll look up into
[53:47] its branches and I'll admire its beauty
[53:50] as uh I am today a boy of 12 and there's
[53:54] nothing left of that tree but a snake
[53:56] snag why there is nothing here that can
[54:02] continue he says it must cease and every
[54:06] Mortal thing speaks of an immortal one
[54:09] coming for everything that we see is a
[54:12] perverted Act of something that's real
[54:15] and he says I marry a couple and I see a
[54:18] lovely young girl in her blushing teen
[54:21] and a young man with his shoulders back
[54:23] standing as they are one and their
[54:25] hearts beating together and I think
[54:27] isn't that too pretty a picture to ever
[54:30] be marred by death but it's just a few
[54:32] years till their hair turns gray and the
[54:35] shoulders stoop and back to the dust
[54:38] they
[54:39] go is that right saints Saints it seemed
[54:43] like I just got
[54:45] married and here I am a
[54:47] grandpa now don't get me wrong being a
[54:50] grandpa is better than being a
[54:53] dad if I have known the grandkids was as
[54:55] good as they are have had them
[54:58] first but it don't seem like no 's
[55:01] passed brother Chuck seemed like I just
[55:03] got married and here we are way on up
[55:05] down the road is that right you know
[55:08] where' the time go what happens Saints
[55:11] and and I'm I'm just I feel like I'm
[55:13] just getting started but I I need more
[55:15] time to serve him Amen brother brother
[55:18] John you might be as good-looking as you
[55:20] ever was but where did the years go
[55:23] where did the time go h h h
[55:27] when you look back and young people that
[55:28] just got married you that's just getting
[55:30] married you're going to look you're
[55:31] going to look back and and and you know
[55:34] before you know what kids are going to
[55:35] be here then the kids are going to be
[55:36] graduating and and then they're going to
[55:38] have kids and and you're going to say
[55:40] where does the time go here we have no
[55:44] continuing
[55:46] City but there is coming a
[55:51] time well there won't be no more gray
[55:54] hairs there's coming a Time where there
[55:56] won't be no more sickness all this
[55:58] sorrow be over with so there's coming a
[56:01] time where we won't have to break our
[56:04] fellowship brother Brown said what is it
[56:06] it's a picture when they're standing
[56:09] there that there's a land beyond the
[56:11] river where every symptom of death is
[56:14] taken away there Immortal shall stand in
[56:18] his likeness the sun and the stars to
[56:20] outshine that great morning star hasn't
[56:23] lost any of its beauty since the Lord
[56:26] blow it from his hands and hung it in
[56:28] its orbit and look what a few years does
[56:31] to
[56:32] us but what did he say in the scripture
[56:35] he said those that have turned many to
[56:37] righteous shall outshine the Stars so we
[56:42] look for a city whose Builder and maker
[56:45] is God is that right today Saints so we
[56:49] understand that there's a time and a
[56:51] purpose appointed to everything we
[56:53] understand as we covered this morning
[56:55] that there's five musts that we must
[56:57] have to do the will of the Lord that it
[56:59] must be the right time it must be the
[57:01] right season it must be according to the
[57:04] word it must come to a Vindicated
[57:07] Prophet amen and we know that we have to
[57:10] wait upon the Lord because there is
[57:12] always a space of time between the
[57:15] sewing and the reaping there's always a
[57:18] space of time between the planting and
[57:21] the Harvest there's always something in
[57:23] the middle there Saints there's always a
[57:25] space of time between the promise and
[57:27] the delivery amen there's always that
[57:30] space of time there and and so we
[57:32] understand that we have to get used to
[57:34] waiting upon the
[57:37] Lord and we also know that our season is
[57:40] coming it's on the road right now but
[57:44] then the question becomes and what I
[57:45] want to get into tonight as our as our
[57:48] message tonight the question is what do
[57:50] we do while we're waiting because we're
[57:53] going to have to learn to wait God will
[57:56] make promises and God will deliver on
[57:59] those promises but there will be a
[58:01] waiting period many times amen sometimes
[58:05] things happen miraculously and some
[58:07] things happen immediately but other
[58:09] times we have a period of waiting if you
[58:12] claim your healing sometimes you'll have
[58:14] a period of waiting if you claim your
[58:17] family sometimes you'll have a period of
[58:21] waiting if you're seeking something from
[58:23] the Lord whether it be Deliverance of
[58:25] something something or whether it be the
[58:27] holy ghost or whatever you're seeking
[58:29] from the Lord sometimes there'll be a
[58:31] period of waiting on the
[58:34] promise and it's in this place between
[58:37] the sewing and the reaping that the
[58:40] devil can really work on
[58:43] us when God makes a promise and we
[58:46] receive that promise and then we're
[58:48] waiting on that promise to manifest in
[58:51] that space of time Satan can attack our
[58:54] minds
[58:57] when we're in the middle there is our
[58:59] most tremendous mental
[59:01] battle we know he promised it and we
[59:04] know he can deliver on
[59:06] it but now
[59:09] what
[59:10] now that's many times where the devil
[59:13] starts acting on our
[59:16] reasoning it's our reasoning that we get
[59:20] while we're waiting on the Lord if
[59:23] you'll remember while Abraham was
[59:26] waiting on the promised son that's when
[59:30] Sarah come up with the Bond woman
[59:33] idea now is that right Saints while he
[59:36] was waiting so the promise had been
[59:38] given and he's waiting on the promise to
[59:40] manifest the seed had been planted and
[59:42] he's waiting to harvest that seed and
[59:45] while he was waiting to harvest that
[59:47] seed while he was waiting on the promise
[59:50] to manifest that's when Sarah came with
[59:53] the Bond woman idea and we see what kind
[59:55] of trouble the Bond woman
[59:59] caused it was while Moses was waiting on
[1:00:03] the promise he was in Egypt he knew he
[1:00:06] was the deliver he knew he was getting
[1:00:08] close to time and it was while he was
[1:00:10] waiting on the
[1:00:12] promise that he that he got to reasoning
[1:00:16] that he got to trying to do something
[1:00:18] himself that he slew the Egyptian and he
[1:00:21] fell it's while we're waiting on the
[1:00:23] Lord that we try to take things into our
[1:00:26] own hands many times we commit things to
[1:00:29] the Lord but while we're waiting we try
[1:00:32] to get involved again if you got a if
[1:00:35] you got somebody in your family and
[1:00:36] you're claiming them and you and you say
[1:00:38] Lord just do with them what you need to
[1:00:40] do Lord whatever you got to do bring
[1:00:42] them bring them back into the into the
[1:00:44] house of the Lord Lord we're committing
[1:00:46] them to you we're we're giving them to
[1:00:47] you we're applying the token to them
[1:00:49] whatever you got to do Lord but then we
[1:00:51] start every time something happens and
[1:00:52] the Lord's trying to work that for us
[1:00:54] then we want to get back involved
[1:00:58] again if you commit it to the Lord leave
[1:01:01] it there stop digging the seed up every
[1:01:04] time something happens if you've give it
[1:01:07] to the Lord and you put it in his hands
[1:01:09] leave it there and let him deal with it
[1:01:12] it's in the middle between the har
[1:01:15] between the planting and the Harvest
[1:01:17] that the that the devil deals with our
[1:01:20] minds amen and I'll tell you Satan will
[1:01:23] use anything or any tactic to torment
[1:01:26] our minds anything he can do believer's
[1:01:29] position in Christ paragraph 11 brother
[1:01:32] Bram said many times people go out and
[1:01:34] see an evangelist like for an instance
[1:01:37] our brother Billy Graham now let me stop
[1:01:40] and say this one of the tactics that the
[1:01:42] devil tries to do when we're waiting is
[1:01:46] to make us start looking around at what
[1:01:49] God is doing for
[1:01:52] others so the the promise has been given
[1:01:54] to you you're waiting on it to manifest
[1:01:57] and while you're waiting the devil will
[1:01:59] try to get you to look over at this one
[1:02:01] look over at that one look over at this
[1:02:03] brother look at that sister look at
[1:02:05] what's going on here look at what's
[1:02:06] going on there and you start comparing
[1:02:09] your life to what everybody else is
[1:02:11] going through and you find he says many
[1:02:14] times people go out and see an
[1:02:16] evangelist like for example for instance
[1:02:17] our brother Billy Graham what good would
[1:02:20] it do for me to try to be like Billy
[1:02:23] Graham I couldn't do it if I had to I've
[1:02:26] got a Ministry that I got to take care
[1:02:28] of and the next man's got his ministry
[1:02:32] and each one has got a Ministry even to
[1:02:35] the housewife has a Ministry of
[1:02:38] ministering the word of
[1:02:40] God and he says now if I tried to
[1:02:44] impersonate Mr Graham I'd find myself in
[1:02:46] trouble right quick because he's smart
[1:02:48] shrew educated a real preacher well I'm
[1:02:51] not well maybe if Mr Graham tried to
[1:02:53] find himself impersonating me he'd be be
[1:02:55] in trouble too and Saints if we start
[1:02:58] looking around at everybody else and we
[1:03:00] start trying to impersonate what
[1:03:02] everybody else is doing I'm seeing a
[1:03:05] concerning trend of it in message
[1:03:07] preachers today where you got a couple
[1:03:09] or three bigname preachers and they got
[1:03:11] some doctrines that they believe and you
[1:03:13] find that a lot of the of the the other
[1:03:16] preachers are trying to emulate are they
[1:03:18] trying to preach the same Doctrine or
[1:03:20] they trying to preach the same way or
[1:03:22] they trying to preach the same style
[1:03:24] ain't everybody supposed to be preaching
[1:03:25] the same way Saints ain't everybody got
[1:03:28] the same style don't everybody got the
[1:03:30] same sermon
[1:03:32] topics God don't want that he want he
[1:03:35] uses everybody differently I mean and
[1:03:38] one Minister should be different than
[1:03:40] another Minister and so we find many
[1:03:43] times people start watching other
[1:03:45] ministers and they start impersonating
[1:03:47] and emulating and I can tell sometimes
[1:03:49] by watching them who they've been
[1:03:50] listening
[1:03:53] to you say I know where that come from I
[1:03:56] know where they got that mannerism I
[1:03:59] know where they got that drink that
[1:04:00] they're drinking
[1:04:03] there but Saints we're all different
[1:04:05] that's carnal
[1:04:07] impersonation but you know they did it
[1:04:09] to brother brandham also brother brand
[1:04:11] that's why the third pull was was was
[1:04:13] kept secret he said I I can't say much
[1:04:15] about it because they it was carnal
[1:04:18] impersonation they they impersonated the
[1:04:20] first two two and he said don't say much
[1:04:22] about it
[1:04:27] the angel told him not to say much about
[1:04:30] it he said it won't be a public show and
[1:04:32] I can't say much about it it's carnal
[1:04:35] impersonation we shouldn't all have the
[1:04:38] same style we shouldn't all have the
[1:04:40] same way of of playing an instrument or
[1:04:43] singing or or whatever God uses all
[1:04:45] kinds of different styles he uses all
[1:04:48] kinds of different people and if we're
[1:04:50] all trying to do it the same what if
[1:04:52] there's somebody that your style reaches
[1:04:55] everybody don't like my preaching
[1:04:58] everybody don't like another brother's
[1:04:59] preaching it's different styles for
[1:05:01] different people and God uses different
[1:05:04] ones to reach different
[1:05:11] people we shouldn't all be preaching the
[1:05:13] same things we don't all even have to
[1:05:16] agree on the same
[1:05:20] Doctrine I don't have to have my
[1:05:22] Doctrine
[1:05:23] approved except by the message
[1:05:27] you know if somebody preaches something
[1:05:29] I don't understand one of three things
[1:05:31] is going to
[1:05:33] happen I'm going to go check it with the
[1:05:35] word if I don't understand it brother
[1:05:37] will I'm gonna check and see what the
[1:05:39] word says now there's three possible
[1:05:41] outcomes the first one which is highly
[1:05:44] unlikely brother Chuck but the first one
[1:05:46] is that I could be
[1:05:51] wrong and if I'm
[1:05:54] wrong then I've been corrected by the
[1:05:56] word and we say Amen because we don't
[1:06:00] want to be wrong we want to be corrected
[1:06:02] so if we see something wrong we want God
[1:06:04] to show us something right so if I hear
[1:06:08] something that I don't agree with and I
[1:06:10] go check it with the word and I find out
[1:06:12] that that's right then praise God I've
[1:06:14] been corrected that's God's
[1:06:18] program the second outcome which is more
[1:06:21] probable is that I found out I was right
[1:06:27] you'd think sister Brandy give me an
[1:06:29] amen over
[1:06:33] that but even if I found out I was
[1:06:37] right then I have just went to study and
[1:06:40] solidified what I already believed to
[1:06:42] begin with amen and we need to do that
[1:06:45] we need to remind oursel why we believe
[1:06:48] what we believe from time to time amen
[1:06:51] or the third option which is probably
[1:06:54] the most common is that we're both
[1:06:57] seeing the same thing but we're looking
[1:06:59] at it from a different
[1:07:01] angle and in that case then my mind is
[1:07:05] open to another possibility of the same
[1:07:07] scripture or
[1:07:09] doctrine but in all cases it's a net
[1:07:13] positive is that right even if somebody
[1:07:16] says something you don't agree with it
[1:07:18] still works to
[1:07:22] good see sometimes we need to be ch
[1:07:25] challenged we need to challenge
[1:07:28] ourself that maybe there's something we
[1:07:30] don't understand maybe there's more out
[1:07:32] there than what we know maybe there's
[1:07:34] another Revelation that we haven't
[1:07:36] received yet and maybe there's a
[1:07:38] different point of view that we can look
[1:07:40] at things through a little different
[1:07:41] lens or a little different
[1:07:44] eye but we can't all be the same even up
[1:07:47] to the housewife brother brand said
[1:07:49] she's got a Ministry and and and can't
[1:07:52] everybody do it the same way you sisters
[1:07:56] can't look at another sister and say
[1:07:58] well her family seems like they got it
[1:07:59] all together I'm going to do it the way
[1:08:01] she does it you're not called to do it
[1:08:03] the way she does it what the way she
[1:08:06] does it might not work in your family
[1:08:09] maybe you got a different Dynamic maybe
[1:08:11] you got a different way of doing things
[1:08:13] maybe your kids wouldn't receive it that
[1:08:16] way because everybody's different you
[1:08:19] got to go the way God leads you to go
[1:08:22] you got to do it the way God shows you
[1:08:25] do
[1:08:30] it everybody can't raise their kids the
[1:08:33] same what work for one might not work
[1:08:35] for the other I'll tell you you can't
[1:08:37] even raise your kids the
[1:08:39] same I got three girls and every one of
[1:08:42] them's different what we had to do to
[1:08:44] get one of them keep one of them between
[1:08:45] the rails didn't work on the
[1:08:48] other is that right Saints you got to
[1:08:51] you got to manage to the individual now
[1:08:54] believer's position in Christ he says so
[1:08:56] there you are we can't do that we got to
[1:09:01] go uh I think it's paragraph
[1:09:04] 12 he says there you are we can't do
[1:09:07] that we got to go we got to do what God
[1:09:11] has revealed to us to do can you say
[1:09:13] Amen to that tonight we got to do what
[1:09:15] God has revealed to us to
[1:09:18] do brother Graham is doing that God has
[1:09:21] revealed to
[1:09:22] him a worldwide Revival
[1:09:26] and he's making a good show of it and I
[1:09:28] appreciate him and I'm trying my best by
[1:09:30] the Revelation that God has given me to
[1:09:34] minister to the sick people to to what
[1:09:37] he told me to do now if we can find our
[1:09:40] position and know that it's God's word
[1:09:42] that was
[1:09:46] promised uh go God's word had promised
[1:09:48] it that's the reason Joshua and Caleb
[1:09:50] had no fear that they could take the
[1:09:52] promised land because all the rest of
[1:09:54] the nine came back or 10 and said we
[1:09:56] can't do it while those cities are
[1:09:58] walled High we look like grasshoppers
[1:10:00] upside the people they're so big and
[1:10:02] they're armed and say we just can't do
[1:10:05] it see there we're looking at the sense
[1:10:08] of reasoning you can't look at the sense
[1:10:10] of reasoning you've got to look at the
[1:10:13] promise of
[1:10:15] God now God had already sent his Angel
[1:10:18] and the angel was in the camp moving on
[1:10:21] and the revelation of God had brought
[1:10:23] the word of God manifest and now now
[1:10:25] they was ready to push in to the
[1:10:27] promised land therefore Joshua and Caleb
[1:10:30] had all all the promises was to them for
[1:10:33] God had promised he was going to give
[1:10:35] them the land and they then they waited
[1:10:37] all this time and then after a while the
[1:10:40] Holy Ghost came down to Moses a pillar
[1:10:42] of fire formed over them and they they
[1:10:45] and followed it and here it was right up
[1:10:48] there at the promised land now ready to
[1:10:50] push over so he could believe it because
[1:10:52] God's promises is unfailing they are the
[1:10:55] truth he
[1:10:56] said so we find that it was this sense
[1:10:59] of reasoning the same sense of reasoning
[1:11:01] that that caused Sarah to look for the
[1:11:03] Bond woman the same sense of reason that
[1:11:05] called Moses to try to slew the Egyptian
[1:11:07] and take it into his own that same sense
[1:11:09] of reasoning again caused the children
[1:11:11] of Israel to doubt whether they were
[1:11:13] able to take the promised land or
[1:11:16] not and we find that we cannot compare
[1:11:20] ourself to others it's a recipe for
[1:11:23] misery if you're compare pring yourself
[1:11:26] and your life and the life of your
[1:11:28] family and everything you're going
[1:11:30] through to what everybody else is doing
[1:11:33] the devil will show you everything great
[1:11:36] that everybody else
[1:11:39] has everybody's got more money than you
[1:11:44] everybody's got a nicer car everybody's
[1:11:47] got a better job come on somebody
[1:11:50] everybody's got more vacation time than
[1:11:52] you got everybody their their family
[1:11:55] gets along better than your family does
[1:11:57] their family photos look better than
[1:11:59] yours do they got better hair they got
[1:12:02] better
[1:12:03] teeth come on somebody tonight their
[1:12:07] kids are doing better they got their
[1:12:09] hair is nicer they got a better they got
[1:12:12] a better looking husband brother
[1:12:19] John they don't ever get
[1:12:22] upset they're more spiritual than we are
[1:12:26] they got more faith than we
[1:12:28] got but he the devil will never show you
[1:12:31] the
[1:12:32] rest he'll just show you the great
[1:12:34] things that everybody else has got but
[1:12:37] he won't show you the pain they're
[1:12:38] dealing with he won't show you the
[1:12:40] troubles that they're dealing with oh
[1:12:42] they might have more money than you and
[1:12:44] they might have more heartaches than you
[1:12:46] too and they might have a better car
[1:12:48] than you got but their health might be
[1:12:50] failing them you they might they might
[1:12:52] seem like they got a better job than you
[1:12:54] got but you don't know the stress that
[1:12:56] they're dealing with for having that job
[1:12:58] you never know what people's going
[1:13:00] through
[1:13:01] Saints you never know and the devil
[1:13:04] won't show you that he'll only show you
[1:13:06] the things that everybody's got that
[1:13:08] looks better than what you
[1:13:10] got now believer's position in Christ
[1:13:13] paragraph six brother BR says the main
[1:13:15] thing is this he says if we can find
[1:13:17] where God's word belongs in our life he
[1:13:20] said God sets time limits and then it
[1:13:23] works all uh all all to that time let me
[1:13:26] skip down just a little bit he says and
[1:13:28] people try to do it within themselves
[1:13:30] they try to make God's word fit their
[1:13:32] program but you that's you got it vice
[1:13:35] versa we've got to fit in God's
[1:13:39] program
[1:13:40] amen so the devil will try to use other
[1:13:45] people's
[1:13:46] blessings against
[1:13:50] you if you're in a season of trial or
[1:13:53] you're in a hard time
[1:13:56] and your brother or sister is in a
[1:13:58] season of
[1:14:00] blessing then you might get a case of
[1:14:02] the why me
[1:14:04] Lords if you look around and you're
[1:14:06] healthy and you're struggling in your
[1:14:08] body and then somebody else is
[1:14:11] healed the devil will say see there they
[1:14:14] must be a better Christian than you they
[1:14:16] must be doing something right and that
[1:14:18] you're doing something wrong because
[1:14:20] they got healed and you're not healed
[1:14:22] yet or if you see somebody and and their
[1:14:25] family is doing better than your family
[1:14:28] then the devil will look at you and say
[1:14:29] see there you're you're not you're not
[1:14:31] the kind of believer you need to be or
[1:14:33] your family be doing like their family's
[1:14:35] doing now is that right or wrong
[1:14:38] Saints but Saints it's not any of those
[1:14:41] things they're just in a different
[1:14:43] season than you're in amen you might
[1:14:46] fast forward a year to be right the
[1:14:53] opposite but the Bible says that when
[1:14:55] one member
[1:14:59] rejoices we all Rejoice with
[1:15:04] it he can even drive us so far that we
[1:15:07] can become jealous of His blessings in
[1:15:10] other people's
[1:15:12] lives now that's right Saints it
[1:15:15] happened to brother
[1:15:17] brandham do do y all remember the story
[1:15:19] and Eagle stir and as there's many
[1:15:20] places in the scripture or in the in the
[1:15:22] message but brother brandom was standing
[1:15:25] and he he was talking about Tommy
[1:15:26] Osborne and he was talking about or
[1:15:28] Roberts and he was talking about touring
[1:15:31] that great facility that or Roberts had
[1:15:34] and he said he had 500 IBM
[1:15:37] machines is that what he said Saints and
[1:15:40] and he said here they are and uh let me
[1:15:43] let me see if I can pick this up here he
[1:15:46] says I I stepped outside he talked about
[1:15:49] walking through that building and
[1:15:50] getting a tour seeing all those great
[1:15:52] IBM machines all those letters coming in
[1:15:55] worldwide Ministries going on there and
[1:15:57] he said I stepped outside paragraph 199
[1:16:00] he said I stepped outside and I said to
[1:16:02] brother fiser that I missionar with him
[1:16:05] in Africa he was taking me through and I
[1:16:07] went to the mirror and seen those great
[1:16:10] beautiful hands reaching down like the
[1:16:12] hands of God and sinners reaching for
[1:16:15] him he said my heart just jumped for Joy
[1:16:17] I thought oh God how I thank you for or
[1:16:20] Roberts how I thank you for one little
[1:16:23] old Pentecostal boy born in a Dugout
[1:16:26] Over Yonder and he says could have come
[1:16:29] up uh to a mount like that and I said
[1:16:32] how I than you God and I stood outside
[1:16:35] and I got to myself and I walked around
[1:16:38] to get in my car and then something said
[1:16:40] to me it was
[1:16:43] Satan he said it was Satan and he said
[1:16:46] but what about
[1:16:47] you he said all Robert's Ministry come
[1:16:51] off of yours so did Tommy Osborne and
[1:16:55] here you are where's your IBM
[1:16:58] machines he says a little old end of a
[1:17:01] trailer that brother Leo lets me have an
[1:17:03] office in a phone sitting in there a
[1:17:05] little second-handed typewriter he says
[1:17:08] he said Satan he said what about that
[1:17:10] and I said oh I I would sure hate for
[1:17:12] them to come and see
[1:17:15] that and he said Satan says you see he
[1:17:18] don't he can't trust you and I said I
[1:17:21] guess that's right see all them Brethren
[1:17:25] with all I guess he can just trust he
[1:17:28] can't he just can't trust me that's all
[1:17:31] and I was standing there looking and I
[1:17:33] got real broke up and I thought oh God
[1:17:37] as hard as I've tried and everything
[1:17:39] else and I said look what you've
[1:17:43] done just then I Heard a
[1:17:48] Voice said but I am your portion
[1:17:56] I said oh God a tener a cottage why

[1:18:42] don't matter if you struggle every day
[1:18:45] of this life as long as you make that
[1:18:47] life he's your
[1:18:49] portion and if somebody else has got
[1:18:51] more than you amen he's still your
[1:18:54] portion and if somebody else appears to
[1:18:56] be blessed more than you amen he's still
[1:18:59] your
[1:19:00] portion thank Lord it don't matter what
[1:19:02] everybody else has got what matters is
[1:19:04] you got him and he's got you and at the
[1:19:08] end of the road it's all going to be the
[1:19:10] same nobody's taking nothing from this
[1:19:12] world with them that's
[1:19:15] right is that right Saints you know I
[1:19:18] was talking to a brother here a couple
[1:19:19] weeks ago a minister brother and you
[1:19:22] know how I preached that where where
[1:19:24] brother Brandon went beyond the curtain
[1:19:25] time and he said are all these bandoms
[1:19:28] y'all know that story and and and he
[1:19:30] said no these are your converts to
[1:19:34] Christ and say that means tonight you
[1:19:36] and I are converts of William brandom
[1:19:39] because he saw us Beyond a curtain of
[1:19:41] time he saw us with an inheritance
[1:19:45] Incorruptible do you believe that Saints
[1:19:48] and I said I don't care who you are and
[1:19:50] I don't care who witnessed you the
[1:19:51] message if you receive this message a
[1:19:55] convert of William brandham
[1:19:57] amen and I believe that with all my
[1:19:59] heart Saints I'm resting on it
[1:20:03] tonight and I had a minister brother
[1:20:05] tell me said well brother George but but
[1:20:07] but what about us what about us what if
[1:20:09] we what about the souls that we win for
[1:20:11] the Lord what about the people that we
[1:20:14] that are saved under our ministry does
[1:20:16] does brother brandham get all the credit
[1:20:18] for that he said what about the stars in
[1:20:20] our crown and I said I'm not I told him
[1:20:22] like I said don't talk to me about
[1:20:25] no robe and Crown just let me look at
[1:20:28] him for a thousand
[1:20:32] years I don't care who gets
[1:20:36] credit I'm not worried about no stars
[1:20:39] I'm not worried about no Crown he's my
[1:20:42] poron that's Crown enough for me today
[1:20:45] Saints he's what I'm looking
[1:20:50] for I do believe you can have a star in
[1:20:53] your crown and they still be a ver to
[1:20:55] William brand amen but I'm not worried
[1:20:58] about who gets credits if a soul is Born
[1:21:01] Into the kingdom of God you think I care
[1:21:03] who put him
[1:21:05] there it's all Jesus
[1:21:12] anyway talk to me by no
[1:21:16] stars now look at what the scripture
[1:21:18] said about
[1:21:22] this I also dealt with
[1:21:26] a situation where and this has been
[1:21:28] quite a while ago but where a sister she
[1:21:32] wasn't
[1:21:33] feeling she wasn't feeling like she was
[1:21:36] as spiritual as everybody else because
[1:21:39] other people would go to the Altar and
[1:21:40] they would cry out and and and there
[1:21:43] tears flowing and she said I I just
[1:21:45] don't I don't cry like that or I I don't
[1:21:48] but I I I don't I don't get in the
[1:21:50] spirit like other people do s you can't
[1:21:53] compare your worship to to other people
[1:21:56] some people worship differently amen but
[1:21:58] as long as we're worshiping the same God
[1:22:00] I said sister do you love him does he
[1:22:03] live in your hearts don't worry about
[1:22:06] what everybody else is doing you worship
[1:22:08] God the way you worship
[1:22:11] God we can't compare oursel to
[1:22:15] others Romans the 12th chapter ninth
[1:22:19] verse says let love be without
[1:22:22] dissimilation that means hypocrisy
[1:22:25] amen let love be pure and let love be
[1:22:29] real abhor that which is evil cleave to
[1:22:32] that which is good be kindly
[1:22:34] affectionate one to another with
[1:22:36] Brotherly Love in honor preferring one
[1:22:44] another not slothful in business fervent
[1:22:47] in spirit serving the lord Rejoice
[1:22:51] rejoicing in Hope patient in Tribulation
[1:22:55] continuing instant in prayer
[1:22:58] Distributing to the necessity of the
[1:23:00] Saints given to
[1:23:05] hospitality is this what the Bible says
[1:23:07] we should be
[1:23:08] Saints says bless them which persecute
[1:23:12] you bless and curse
[1:23:15] not
[1:23:16] rejoice with them that do
[1:23:19] rejoice and weep with them that weep
[1:23:25] be of the same mind one toward another
[1:23:27] mind not high things but condescend to
[1:23:30] Men of low
[1:23:32] estate be not wise in your own conceits
[1:23:35] recompense to no man evil for evil
[1:23:37] provide things honest in the sight of
[1:23:39] all men if it be possible as much as
[1:23:42] lith in you live peaceably with all men
[1:23:45] dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but
[1:23:48] rather give Place unto wrath for it is
[1:23:51] written vengeance is mine and I will
[1:23:54] will repay sayith the Lord therefore if
[1:23:56] thine enemy hunger feed
[1:23:59] him therefore if thine enemy hunger feed
[1:24:02] him if he thirst give him drink for in
[1:24:05] so doing Thou shalt reap coals of fire
[1:24:08] on his head be not overcome of evil but
[1:24:11] overcome evil with good
[1:24:16] see now let me ask you this do we do
[1:24:19] these things only when we're being
[1:24:21] blessed also
[1:24:24] do we do these things when everything's
[1:24:27] going good for us but we don't do these
[1:24:29] things when things are rough or do we do
[1:24:32] these things all the
[1:24:33] time do we do we bless those that are
[1:24:38] suffering even when we're suffering do
[1:24:41] we try to help those that need help even
[1:24:43] when we need help
[1:24:45] ourself yes yes it's not a it doesn't
[1:24:49] say if everything's going good then you
[1:24:51] do these things it doesn't say if
[1:24:53] everything's blessing you then you bless
[1:24:55] others but in all things Saints we got
[1:24:57] to be just as happy when it's no as it
[1:25:00] is when it's
[1:25:01] yes
[1:25:03] now there is going to come a time that
[1:25:07] somebody who is seemingly doing better
[1:25:10] than
[1:25:11] you is going to ask for your
[1:25:13] help and you're going to think you want
[1:25:16] me to help you you need to be helping
[1:25:20] me and you'll think about those things
[1:25:22] there's going to come a time that you're
[1:25:24] working yourself to
[1:25:27] death and somebody that seemingly
[1:25:30] doesn't work as hard as you do is going
[1:25:32] to ask you to help
[1:25:37] them sisters there's going to come a
[1:25:39] time where maybe a sister that's not as
[1:25:43] fervent as you are about keeping the
[1:25:45] house
[1:25:47] clean is going to ask you to help them
[1:25:49] clean their house
[1:25:55] there's going to come a time when
[1:25:57] somebody that's been
[1:25:59] sick half the time you've been sick is
[1:26:02] going to be healed and they're going to
[1:26:04] come to you with the
[1:26:08] testimony and that's when it gets
[1:26:11] hard but the Bible says to
[1:26:17] Rejoice I'm still sick God healed you
[1:26:20] and I'm rejoicing with
[1:26:22] you I'm not jealous that God healed you
[1:26:25] and didn't heal me come on somebody
[1:26:28] tonight and it's also not just your
[1:26:30] brothers and sisters the Bible said that
[1:26:34] if your enemy is hungry now you might
[1:26:37] not have enough food for yourself
[1:26:38] sometime but if your enemy is hungry
[1:26:41] feed
[1:26:44] them now Galatians 6:9 said let us be
[1:26:47] weary not be weary in wello for in due
[1:26:51] season we shall reap if if we faint not
[1:26:56] so we don't worry about doing good to
[1:26:58] people is that right Saints we don't
[1:27:01] worry about helping people just help
[1:27:03] them just do good to them you say Well
[1:27:06] they're trying to take advantage of me
[1:27:07] that's not your business you just help
[1:27:09] them if you can you say well well I
[1:27:12] don't know what to I don't know maybe
[1:27:13] they don't deserve it it doesn't
[1:27:15] matter just do good to them is that what
[1:27:19] the Bible said Saints you're not
[1:27:21] responsible for what others do you're
[1:27:23] responsible for what you you do and
[1:27:25] we're to live for each other we say well
[1:27:28] I've been hurt brother George I I'm
[1:27:29] looking to get even that's why the Bible
[1:27:31] said vengeance is mine sayith the Lord
[1:27:33] let the Lord to handle all the getting
[1:27:35] even you just serve the Lord and love
[1:27:38] him and try to help everybody you can
[1:27:40] and let the Vengeance end look I've been
[1:27:42] hurt too we all been hurt amen but we
[1:27:46] let those things go so that we can have
[1:27:49] love in our hearts and we leave the rest
[1:27:52] of it up to God can we close and the
[1:27:55] musicians
[1:27:56] come just
[1:27:59] remember when you think everybody else
[1:28:01] has got been blessed and you're not
[1:28:03] getting
[1:28:04] blessed we don't know
[1:28:07] everything we don't know what everybody
[1:28:10] else is going
[1:28:11] through brother John come on up here
[1:28:14] just because someone looks like they're
[1:28:16] being blessed doesn't mean they aren't
[1:28:18] struggling in some other area of their
[1:28:21] life just because somebody's got it all
[1:28:24] all together it looks like doesn't mean
[1:28:26] that things aren't aren't going crazy in
[1:28:28] their mind in their heart in their life
[1:28:30] people don't tell you everything you
[1:28:32] never know what people deal with you
