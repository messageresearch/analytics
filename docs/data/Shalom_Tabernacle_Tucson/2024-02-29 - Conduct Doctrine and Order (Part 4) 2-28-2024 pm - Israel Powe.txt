tyrant throne and they were told that he would spare their lives if they would Ren the name of Christ but one by one they chose to Die the Son of God they would not deny like a great Angelic CH sings I can almost hear their voes ring I pledge alance to the Lamb with all my strength with all I am I will see to oneor his command I pledge [Music] alance to the land and now the years have come and the years have gone but the cause of Jesus still goes on and now our time has come to account on the cross to reject this world to embrace the cross so one by one let us live our Liv for the one who died to give us life till the trumpet sounds on that f final day let us proudly stand and boldly say I pledge alance to the Lamb with all my strength with all I am and I will seek to honor him commands I pledge alance to the lamb and I pledge alance to the lamb let's all stand my shr with all I am I will see [Music] to alance to the lamb how we can say praise the Lord amen we thank the Lord Jesus that we can pledge our allegiance to the lamb amen let's bow our heads for a word of prayer Lord Jesus Jesus we ask your blessings upon this portion of the service Lord speak to our hearts we pray we come gathered in Your Name Lord looking and expecting you to speak to us to give us another portion of your word for the journey that lays ahead oh God bless each one that's gathered Lord to made the effort and the sacrifice to be here oh God we just commit the service into your care and the words that we speak Lord let it be pleasing unto you father forgive us of our shortcomings our sins our unbelief help us Lord to draw to that stature of a perfect man Lord is the image that's placed before us Lord let may this service be part of that drawing Lord part of the step in that direction is our prayer we love you we ask these blessings in Jesus name amen God bless you we like to welcome each of you to the house of the Lord on a Wednesday night always good to see each of you here we always expecting the Lord to do something very nice for us amen praise the Lord amen while you're standing we' like to take a scripture or just speak for a few moments we've been talking on conduct order and Doctrine some of those things and the scripture we like to take is found in Luke chap 14 there another Parable similar to it in Matthew chapter 10 but we'll take this one in Luke 14 verse number 25 and there went a great multitude with him and he turned and said unto them if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and Brethren and sisters yeah and his own life also he cannot be my disciple and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple amen we'll take one more scripture in Matthew chapter 10 these are the words of Our Lord Parables that we call them and verse number 24 Matthew 10:24 the disciple is not above his master nor the servant above his Lord it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the servant as his Lord if they have called The Master of the House be elub how much more shall they call them of his household fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known what I tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what you hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetops and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy the both soul and and Body in Hell the scriptures goes on to say in verse 34 think not that I am come to send peace on the earth I came not to send peace but a sword for I am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be they of his own household he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it isn't that nice let us pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on the word in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated as you're being seated there's a scripture found in Colossians chapter 3 veres 1-5 and it says this this is the word of God if ye the been risen with Christ seek those things which are above above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affections on things above not on the things of the Earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory mortify or put to death Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanliness inordinate affection evil concupisent and covetousness which is idolatry so we put those things to death you know these two Parables and there's one more we'll get to in Luke chapter 9 are the very strong Parables where the Lord is directly telling you to hate your father and your mother and we know he's not telling us us to hate our parents because that wouldn't be consistent with the laws of Moses because Moses put it in there honor thy father and thy mother and so that you would live long upon the Earth and so what is he doing here he's showing you that the requirement in order to be a disciple and a disciple simply means a follower there a I forget what the Greek word is but that's what it means it means a follower or a pupil and a pupil is a student that's still in class you're still learning so a disciple that word disciple is someone that's following that's still learning you're you're one of Christ's disciples and Jesus puts the worthiness to be called a disciple and he uses these things that are of the greatest care to us I can't think of anything more valuable than the Human family actually I've learned that you know that's probably the most valuable thing that you have particularly when you can't speak for yourself or you're hurt or you're in trouble or you're in danger who typically shows up your family your family will be there for you and church family too CU it's kind of intertwined there and so but Jesus here is now putting he he he he said I don't want you to think that I came to bring peace upon the earth I come come to set a man at variance with his family members and he's showing us The Importance of Being a disciple the cost the price that it takes to really be a disciple and then as we shared with you on Sunday and we've been sharing on on this little part conduct we're still on the conduct part that our life is not our own that actually our time is not our own and in this parable Jesus said that the master I mean you can't think of yourself being greater the disciple is not above his master neither the servant above his Lord so who is the master who's the one that called us we'll never be above him he's the one who called us and he's the reason why we are actually here on the earth amen now this age will get you twisted in your mind and you think you're here for other purposes and we think things are valuable here and we'll in the world will fight for things that they think are valuable but they're not really valuable God's word shows us what's valuable and these things that we're talking about Christ who is our life we mortify the Deeds of our of our body so that we could we could um be true servants to him now there's another scripture found in Luke Chapter N I like to turn there quickly of course we went through the importance of coming together how we meet together what the Christian church does and these are this is what makes us who we are is is our discipleship when we come to him we make it up in our mind there's a tremendous decision that has to be make made when we were called to serve him it's not the Hollywood version it's not the Casual version that's right I mean this is life or death to be called to be a disciple you may have to give your life that reality escapes many many people we we don't think of it that way but we may have to give our life for what we believe and that's how important it is Kingdom of Light against the kingdom of darkness in in Luke chapter 9 vers verse 57 it says and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto himl I will follow thee whether soever thou goest now this certain man was a scribe Matthew chapter 8 will tell you he was a scribe meaning he was um he knew the law he was a well educated man and he's here telling the Lord I'll follow you wherever you go Look What the Lord says and Jesus said unto him foxes have holes birds of the air have Nest but the son of man hath not where to lay his head and he said to another follow me but he said Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father I need to go put my dad to rest and Jesus said unto him let the dead bury they're dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of God and another also said Lord I will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house I just want to go say Bye Lord I'm going to tell all my friends goodbye in my home and Jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God it seems seems kind of harsh I mean this guy just wants to go back and bury his daddy and Jesus tells him you go you let the dead go bury their dead and then this other one wants to go bid the people farewell B them F real now now these These are these are The Parables that Jesus are is bringing to us this is not someone else this is our the loving Lord Jesus and he's putting this variance between the things that we hold so dear and the relationships we hold so well and we seem like they're so important to us and they are but if it came to it if it really came to it and you had to choose a real disciple must be aware that you might have to make that choice to take Jesus over everyone else wife daughter son friend whatever it is husband whatever it it is if I have to if it gets to that and that reality needs to be made plain to us that's where the value of it is it's not just word it it when you see it played out in people's lives and I have I've seen it played out you have two a man or a woman they'll come to the Lord and their family turns against them come to the Lord and even their health they'll be attacked in their health and there's health wealthy people out here living like the devil and there's good clean solid nice loving people honest will serve the Lord and looks like he their health is always at a battle right why does it happen that way because we're we're called to be disciples and disciples we're not just learning of him we're not just learning but we pick up our cross and we follow him that means we follow his example it isn't just a disciple isn't just knowing what Jesus said it's doing what he did on it's following amen so disciple we're not talking about talking about being a disciple or knowing what Jesus taught or knowing what the Bible says about these issues are you doing them then when you're doing them then we can call ourselves disciples and Jesus puts this right to our face right in our faith that we might have to turn against those that we love so dear now in Luke chap 14 look at the examples that our Lord gives in that Parable he says for what man is building a tower and he doesn't count up the cost before building the tower then he goes and he takes the example of a king what king is going to go to war you're going to go fight another kingdom and you don't study out how many men you need for this battle what kind of Battle Ground are we going to be fighting in what kind and Jesus gives these example examples and then uh brings in this you know that that if you can't um hate father mother hate wife children and Brethren and sisters if you can't hate your own life you can't even serve me properly so it's like your life his life and his mission has to be more valuable than your own life and that's a real disciple that's somebody that's going to follow through follow the orders it's like in the army or in the in the military you know you have orderers to go into an area where it's very violent it's hot and people are dying and you know they're dying but you're called to go and fight in that front a real Soldier he'll go because when because in boot camp they clearly tell you not all of y'all coming back home they tell them that they let them know you're not everybody's not coming back home it' be great we're in a time of War many of you will not come back home and they got to settle that in your mind so when you get on the battlefield you're not trying to think whether I might have to give no that's already answered I'm ready to give my life and then you go forward and you fight the fight and this fight that we're we're fighting is a good fight it's a fight worth fighting for and who who are we fighting for we're fighting for the Lord Jesus Christ now this uh disciple is a learner it's a pupil it's a student that's in school and really when I looked at these um these three parables in Luke chapter 14 Matthew chapter 10 and then Luke Chapter n um the what I'm what I'm getting out of that is that you know the Lord was you know in those Parables the Lord was requir requiring of their time and their time is what you would need in order to I mean to build a tower or to to go into war and um uh you know he said to to follow me the foxes have holes the birds have nest and and and but the son of man doesn't have a place to lay his head I I'm asking you to follow me and and then when when we get ready to follow him okay but Lord let me go back and bury my dad let the dead bury the dead uh go preach the word that's what he told him he says you go Let the dead bury the Go Let the dead bury the dead bury their dead and you go preach the gospel it's more valuable more important that the gospel of the kingdom is preached than you to go take care of your family matters now can we take care of Family Matters yes but what's more important and if it comes down to it which one do we have to choose from the the importance is that the gospel is preached yes that's right because guess what there's going to be another funeral anyways and and by the ways the person who died they already lived their life not being cold or heartless but they've lived their life what's what's really more important I mean go to the funeral but go preach the gospel at the funeral that's more that's more valuable go preach the gospel this is the purpose that the church the doors will open today yes I'm sad I missed a valuable opportunity on Sunday morning we had several visitors here I didn't even give a call to for somebody to be saved I thought about that mine was nervous and I'm thought and Levi gave me an announcement I failed to read that and then you just you fail to to catch you know those little opportunities but it's like my goodness the church is here to you know we're here to see Souls saved we we're here to give the opportunity for somebody to receive the Holy Ghost and be saved and delivered that's why the doors are open um and so uh we don't want we don't want to miss those opportunities do we that's right when they come Lord help us you know newcomer comes into the assembly and they leave and nobody reaches out to them that's that's kind of a tragedy and you know and we're looking at them we're watching at them and and and for a newcomer to come they they'll they'll can feel people looking at them and they might take it that we're being cold but we're we're we're very it's a curious lovable look is what we're looking at the visitors I mean I don't know a Christian people that don't like to see visitors in their church we love it but the visitors don't know we love it if we don't tell them that we just looking at them and then don't say nothing I'm talking as a visitor I remember my visitor thoughts coming into a group where you you know you're the newcomer and everybody's looking I see them looking at me they acting like they a't looking at me but they all looking at me and you leave here and it you know but you know we should really reach out and take the next step they came to your church it be like them coming in your home and you sit around looking at them and you don't invite and make them feel welcome find out who they are invite them to come back again so we want to we don't want to miss those opportunities amen and so I feel like I miss the opportunity but but the word was preached I thank the Lord for that it's always nice to be able to preach the word to newcomers but this this time that that we have to give it is slowly but surely uh being taken away from us these opportunities we have them and then they're leaving us every day all the time and so what we want to do is want to make the best of our time and I'll read a few quotes on that on giving God our best brother random makes the statement here in the message the unwelcome Christ he says this here paragraph 272 he is worthy of the best what do you what do you do for him give him the leftover oh yes you run around all day and give him three minutes at night before you go to bed Jesus deserves your best friend he deserves everything you got but what do you do about it you give him just anything he takes it he takes it anyhow he takes it but she said I want the best it cost her everything she had to get the best and that's what you ought to do give your best to give him your best give him the best of your life give him the best of your songs give him all of your talents give him everything you got give him your feet give him your hands give him your eyes give him your mouth give him your ears give him your soul give him your heart give him your praise give him everything you got Hallelujah he deserving of the best amen think that in the message washing Jesus's feet paragraph 31 brother banam says this and some of you people that don't go to church shame on you go to church about once a year and that's on Easter to show your uh pretty hat that's right but you know what God deserves the first place Jesus ought to have the first place in every life but we give him about the fourth place he deserves the first place well you say I pray once a day that's all right he receives it if you want to give him fourth place that's all right he'll take it you only went to church once this year maybe and wore the new hat and everything but he never condemned you for it that's what makes him God to me if you want to give him fourth place or fifth place he'll take it he'll take anything you give him but he ought to have the first place he ought to have the best we can give he ought to have our first our best our all he's deserving of it amen God manifesting his gifts brother bandam says this now the next thing she did do could you realize what the woman had before her she had three months of desert road to travel on the back of a camel 3 months over Over The Burning Sands of the desert she had a PR price to pay and another thing being a woman and all that travel and also in the desert at the time the sons of ishmail was there and they were robbers the woman had made up her mind that she wasn't going empty-handed and she loaded camels down with wealth she brought for she brought in frankincense gold silver mirror perfumes the Great that there was in her kingdom for she thought this in her heart if it was of God she wanted to give God the best she had and if this Christian church today would only think that in their heart the god of Heaven deserves your best of everything you have the best of your time all of your devotion and everything you are you owe it to God we give God just maybe a few minutes on Sunday set and go to sleep while the Sunday school teacher is teaching go home and think we've done our religion for the week what a disgrace I know I got a name of being hard I'm not hard but what it is I've got to stand in judgment with each one of you Amen brother bandam continues in the message Hebrews chapter 2 um number two this is paragraph 114 and he says this here God must have have first place in your heart first place in your life first place in everything that you do or what you are God must be first he doesn't want the second place he doesn't deserve the second place he deserves the best and the first and all that we got he deserves it Blessed Be His holy name amen God deserves that want you to think of that we think of our time who deserves the best of our time that's right he does he deserves the best of our time the best of what we have to offer and to give he deserves our youth the strength that we have the time we spend studying we should turn that back over to him for his kingdom sake the time that we use for any other thing it should be somehow directed towards his purpose for we're here for his purpose and he deserves the best that we have brother Ram talks about how we come to church and when we dress we should dress with our best that he gives us and you know this age has has totally switched that around and it's more you know this the you know the culture or the the way that people dress in public today is just really a shame and then you see that creeping right over into the church world but he really still deserves our best you know and dressing our best isn't the most convenient it doesn't mean being the most comfortable you want to get comfortable you do that on your couch at home but when you're dressing your best that's um that's showing the attitude that you have for what you're doing it's reflected on the way you carry yourself outside it shows on what your importance of things that's going on inside of you and there's things we can dress appropriately for there's things you're going fishing you dress appropriately for that you going skydiving those that would do that you dress appropriately for that mountain climbing and you come to church there should be an appropriate dress for that and um and the world is not the dictator of that it shouldn't be and what the other uh people are doing out there in the world shouldn't be our example either our example should be the word of God now is the word concerned about the way we dress absolutely there's several scriptures that talks about the women's dress and how they should dress and how they should not dress I'm not going to get in that into that tonight but I'll read one quotation here or so and um because you know the the you know I've been studying on it a little bit and you know just the American public they would dress to go to the movies they're dress to catch a flight in public they would be dressed decently and properly and now people are dressed in the airport taking a flight like I mean it's ridiculous yes and it's it's wild it's Untamed it shows an attitude of a nation that forgot God that's what it looks like and you say well brother Israel it doesn't matter how we dress that's true it doesn't matter in one sense how we dress but you know without without talking to anyone we we judge one another by you know whatever whoever's wearing whatever they're wearing we judge them I judge people the way they're dressed you do too you know guy's dressed up in business casual he's approach you he's going to be different than the guy with his hat on backwards his pants sagging down and uh look like you know and even his gate the way he's walking you're going to judge that and it's and he's representing something the homies in the hood they walk and dress a certain way like all the homies in the hood and that's I'm not trying to be funny it's the truth that's right and people that that's going to church or came from church they ought to look like they came from church not a movie not some social event not a family affair and and and this is not my message tonight but I'm pulling that way but I wanted to read this quote so I can sit down to be honest with you but but I've been studying it and been looking at it and and what something brother brandom said here I want to read this for you all right I'm sure I brought it but you know this age shouldn't be our example that's right um the word of the Lord for this day is our example we can go into the word and show you uh the scriptures are doesn't say very much about a man's dress scripturally but in the Old Testament the priest he had a um very specific garment that they wore when they approached the Lord they had a miter hat they had the outer garment they had the epod and they had the linen the type of material that they wore and these were these were instructed by from God to Moses and and told the men that when they come up to the altar that the clothes that they wore that they wouldn't step up to the altar so that their nakedness would be shown so there's a purpose for the clothing that's to cover you so your nakedness wouldn't be shown and and but the Bible specifically Paul and Peter both go in on the women in the way that they should Adorn themselves and brother B's Ministry we see that was quite heavy as a part of his ministry they talked about him him when he would come he's going to preach against the women's dress because right at the turn of his ministry right around that time the Pentecostal church and the Holiness churches were going through this Challenge on how women should dress is it okay for them now I mean I looked at you go to Lucky Wishbone don't don't go there because it's not good for you to eat that but they have pictures on their wall they're selling chicken here in the city and they all look like Christians they look they're dressed decently but you go look at the customers today they don't look like that what happened and so our churches are supposed to flow with the times out there or should we be consistent with the word that God gave us the word didn't change ain't nothing change but the Styles and the and the powers that are out there and and um and so we just want to be mindful of that God is concerned with the way that we're dressed I want to read this quote for you I'll find it for you cuz it's on my mind and brother Brandon says this here in the message you love the Lord yes amen takes a little more effort to dress up you say I remember my sister one time she had a a birthday party for her son this was years ago and um I came just dress any kind of way I had some sweats or whatever I had on she's like Israel why are you coming to my son's party like that I said I didn't know I had to dress up he says she says you didn't have to dress down I was like okay you got me on that one so so I mean you're you're representing something you're you're in public and and we're representing something what are we rep we're representing Christ that's who we're representing let me read this this is in the message God being misunderstood paragraph 6 62 here some time ago a man met me out here aside and I had a Pianist here that had a little short little skirt and wasn't just exactly I guess just right and the lady had short hair and she was just a babe in this way and she was playing the piano and a man met me out there and just tearing me to Pieces he says and you're a Pentecostal preacher and let that woman sit up there that short hair and just going on like everything well I said I think the woman has a good spirit in her I certainly do not agree with that you know the skirt part up here the two pieces one of them is down here and one kind of up here it's a shirt like they wear and so it's real thin and shows the underneath garment that they have around there I don't think that should be done I don't like that I really don't I can't they they might be just as Spirit-filled as anybody else I don't know God knows that but I wouldn't condemn that woman to say that she was going to Hell by the sight the same person had in this church a lady who had long hair and wore long dresses and had a temper enough to fight a buz saw and just as mean as she could be now long hair long skirts don't take you to heaven no sir it's the spirit that's in you takes you to heaven but if you as a Christian then you should remember that many times times pastors pastors don't mention those things and the people just automatically go on think it's all right but a pastor should really tear into that and and then the sisters of the church those sisters who are in character standing wearing their clothes neatly they should be examples of sweetness and and motherly and sisterly like and I think that any woman that's motherly and godly and sisterly ought to go to such a person and with sweetness of the spirit just sit down and talk to that lady and if she is of God the holy spirit will understand those things and she'll correct herself but when you real quickly condemn her and drive her away you might harm that Young born baby see so I wouldn't condemn the person I like that quote it uh it shows some responsibility on the pastor on the sisters Elder sisters that are in good standings there's a responsibility there and there's a responsibility on on those of us that we all should you know know what the word says about these things and you know and brother mam says it very well there you know a pastor should really tear into that he says pastors they don't mention those things and the people just automatically go on and they think it's all right and so if I don't say anything if the ministry doesn't say anything then someone can say well no one told me that that was wrong well it is wrong those things are wrong and I think that once we uh let the Holy Spirit develop Us in who we are serving then what you're wearing will be just a small task of of what the Lord is trying to do for you in your life as a Believer you know we ultimately are here to serve him and he's the one that called us and we want to be pleasing to him by any means necessary and you know and a lot of times you know I know with us and I say us I'm talking about Americans you know we don't want anybody controlling us telling us what to do especially if you tell me I'm going to do the opposite it's how the nature of some of us are like that that's one of my you know I got that part in me some of y'all got it too but you know at the end of the day you got to go back to see what the word says and what does the word say and so you you want to approach that um you know as as the Lord leading you and guiding you on these these little matters how we dress how how we come to the house of the Lord what image are we portraying for the outcomer outsider what are we what are we um are we following as a disciple closely and then really is is our life really more important than his life and I think that once we once the Lord deals with that deals with us on those matters and then it'll be easier for us to serve him as a lamb gives up his rights and these things his time and the efforts and the things that you that we we have to do and you're required you're asked to go a mile but but you you know you probably should be ready to go too and then there's others that need our service and our help and we should be willing to be a part and be available to that I believe that with all of my heart and God gives us that I'll read this last one here it's a question that we all know but I'll read it again it's in uh questions and answers and he says brother brandom do you teach that the bride must not attend any church unless you are there preaching or else the Tabernacle other words the Tabernacle also do you teach that we need not keep the Sunday or holy days as working fishing or or so forth I say that was Sunday look like Sunday to me all right at the bottom it look like yeah Sundays that what it look like no you're mistaken see let me go over and just answer it as it come by do you teach that the bride must not attend any other Church unless you're preaching preaching or else otherwise the Tabernacle no I don't teach that I don't believe that I do not believe it we got Minister sitting here that's scattered all around through the country country and I believe they are part of that bride I believe that a man or woman can go to church anywhere they want to go that teaches the word and I believe if they don't teach the whole word and you can't go to church any other place where they teach the whole word go where they teach half the word until you can get to where they teach the whole word go to church whatever you do do that also do you teach that we must not keep Sunday or any holy day working or like working or fishing on Sunday I believe it's a sin to fish and hunt and work on Sunday when you can go to church I believe your transgressing the laws of God is there a commandment to such yes sir now in the Old Testament we had a type of the Sabbath day and Jesus did not come to you to keep Sabbath days the old Sabbath day was Saturday which was the end of the week Sunday is the Eighth Day or the first day of the week which Jesus rose on I do not believe it's right now if you're way away in the wilderness somewhere and you're out there on a hunting trip there's no church around anything like that there's nothing you can do and if you was ficient I believe that would be all right but if you're around in the city around where church is going on you should attend church by all means somewhere that's right and I believe as far as working I believe if the ox is in the ditch or something has to be done on Sunday you go ahead and do it if it's something you couldn't help it had to work that way but if you just do it and wait till Sunday to do it or just do it like that you're wrong see we must not do that we must respect that holy day amen so we thank God for his word tonight we want to we'll close right there and we will um I don't think we had any prayer requests tonight but I know there were several my wife is still fighting that
