[21:54] you we welcome you to the house of the
[21:56] Lord each of you our visitors our
[21:58] friends amen and all the saints amen
[22:02] let's go right into the scriptures and
[22:04] I'm just going to take maybe 30 minutes
[22:07] or so if the Lord will help me and just
[22:10] touch a little bit on
[22:14] this portion of this subject of marriage
[22:16] and
[22:17] divorce
[22:19] um I got a few books from the Tucson
[22:23] Tabernacle there's two more that I have
[22:25] there and we can order more I really
[22:27] feel like it's um it' be good for you to
[22:30] get a copy of that your own copy and go
[22:33] through it one more time I'll say this
[22:34] if you haven't read it or heard it in
[22:37] the last six months to a year then I
[22:41] believe every brother every sister every
[22:45] single person every individual needs to
[22:47] go back and hear that one more time
[22:50] because it was one of the great
[22:51] Mysteries that was underneath the seven
[22:54] seal that was revealed to us today and
[22:57] when you hear it you'll see how
[22:59] important it was for God to bring it to
[23:02] us in our city here is where the
[23:05] Vindication of it came down right out
[23:08] here in the mountain here the pillar of
[23:09] fire striking down and bringing to us
[23:12] this great message on marriage and
[23:15] divorce but the prophet takes the
[23:17] scripture in Matthew chapter 19 I
[23:20] believe we'll read that before we have
[23:24] you seated amen
[23:43] and verse number
[23:54] three the Pharisees also came unto him
[23:57] tempting him saying unto him to him is
[23:59] it lawful for a man to put away his wife
[24:02] for every cause and he answered and said
[24:05] unto them have you not read that he
[24:08] which made them at the beginning made
[24:09] them male and
[24:11] female and said for this cause shall a
[24:14] man leave father and mother and shall
[24:16] cleave to his wife and they twain shall
[24:19] be one flesh wherefore they are not no
[24:22] more Twain but one flesh what therefore
[24:27] God hath joined together together let
[24:29] not man put aunder they said unto him
[24:34] why did Moses then command to give a
[24:37] writing of divorcement and to put her
[24:40] away and he said unto them Moses because
[24:44] of the hardness of your hearts suffered
[24:48] you to put away your wives but from the
[24:50] beginning it was not so and I say unto
[24:55] you whosoever shall put away his wife
[24:59] except it be for fornication and shall
[25:02] marry another committeth adultery and
[25:06] who so Marth her which is put away doth
[25:10] commit
[25:11] adultery amen let's take one more
[25:13] scripture and Matthew chapter 5
[25:34] verse 31 it has been said whosoever
[25:37] should put away his wife let him give
[25:40] her a writing of divorcement but I say
[25:43] unto you that whosoever should put away
[25:46] his wife saving for the cause of
[25:48] fornication causeth her to commit
[25:51] adultery and whosoever shall marry her
[25:54] that is divorc committeth adultery
[25:59] take one more in Mark chap 10 verses
[26:03] number four through
[26:16] 5 and they
[26:18] said verse four Moses suffered to write
[26:21] a bill of divorcement and to put her
[26:24] away and Jesus answered and said unto
[26:27] them for the hardness of your heart he
[26:30] wrote you this precept what therefore
[26:34] God hath joined together let no man put
[26:37] aunder and in the house his disciples
[26:40] asked him again of the same matter and
[26:43] he sath unto him whosoever should put
[26:45] away his wife and marry another
[26:47] committed adultery against her and if a
[26:51] woman shall put away her husband and be
[26:53] married to another she committeth
[26:56] adultery
[27:00] and with those scriptures we'll ask God
[27:03] to bless us amen Lord Jesus bless us
[27:06] bless us with your word bless this
[27:08] portion of the service we pray ask in
[27:11] Jesus name
[27:13] amen you may be
[27:15] seated
[27:17] now
[27:19] in one of the questions here in Matthew
[27:23] chapter
[27:24] 19 if you um we might get back to it
[27:27] there again
[27:29] the disciples begin to go forward and
[27:31] ask Jesus in depth about marriage and
[27:36] divorce and brother Brandon brings to us
[27:39] that um because it of the original sin
[27:44] is the reason why uh Jesus was faced
[27:47] with this question in the beginning of
[27:49] his ministry Moses was faced with this
[27:52] question in the beginning of his
[27:54] ministry Paul had to deal with it he
[27:57] said for I say unto you not the Lord but
[28:00] I in giving permission and then here
[28:03] also brother brandham had to deal with
[28:05] it too and you know the the teaching on
[28:10] the marriage and divorce and living
[28:13] under that Covenant of marriage and
[28:15] divorce for us Believers there's
[28:19] probably not another
[28:20] denomination that sees it the way we
[28:24] do and it should be the Forefront of
[28:28] teaching from our little ones all the
[28:30] way
[28:31] up and I believe that um brother random
[28:35] tells us he gives a warning he said this
[28:38] is to my people only this is to my group
[28:41] only he made himself very clear to know
[28:44] that these are to my people only and he
[28:47] gives us
[28:49] um the um Doctrine or the understanding
[28:55] of what marriage and divorce is
[28:58] scripturally it goes back into history
[29:01] and shows how Jesus pointed out but from
[29:04] the beginning it wasn't so I never heard
[29:06] another teacher bring it that way so
[29:09] brother random deals with the beginning
[29:11] and then after the beginning and brings
[29:14] in why polygamy was legal even in the
[29:18] animal kingdom and um amongst the human
[29:23] race and uh brother bam tells us why
[29:27] from the beginning all the way through
[29:29] but as you take this message and as I
[29:32] begin to go into it even further and how
[29:35] brother vanam identifies the role of the
[29:39] woman which he called the byproduct very
[29:42] strong strong
[29:44] statements but I want you to focus your
[29:47] mind
[29:49] in on paragraph I think it's 168 in
[29:54] there those of you that take notes I
[29:56] want you to go and and read read the
[29:58] message for yourself I don't want this
[29:59] to be something that I'm preaching to
[30:01] you I want you to go get it for yourself
[30:04] as the prophet said and then you pray
[30:06] over it because um in paragraph 168 he
[30:11] says he speaking of immoral woman he
[30:15] said I'm not speaking to you sisters
[30:18] maybe I'll just read that for you here
[30:21] quickly and so many
[30:24] times um our sisters
[30:28] or women in
[30:30] general will get um maybe just a little
[30:36] bit you know it gets uncomfortable even
[30:39] some of the brothers you get you feel
[30:41] that little
[30:43] pressure
[30:44] um but he's dealing
[30:50] with the immoral
[30:53] woman
[30:55] okay and he's not talking to to our
[30:59] sisters remember of all of the
[31:02] elijas the five that came I believe
[31:06] brother random was the only one uh that
[31:09] had a family that was married I think
[31:12] maybe Elisha maybe had children think
[31:14] Elisha did but we don't know of Elijah
[31:18] and we don't think John the Baptist had
[31:20] any but here's brother brandham who has
[31:22] a wife who has daughters three daughters
[31:25] one in glory two that he raised
[31:28] daughter-in-law sisters in the church
[31:30] and so he know you know that his uh
[31:34] approach has to be he's bringing it from
[31:37] the word of God standpoint and when when
[31:40] you have been raised in Dysfunctional
[31:43] teaching or understanding for so long
[31:46] then when you finally hear the truth
[31:48] after the end of all the ages it sounds
[31:52] very very harsh it sounds harsh because
[31:56] of the dysfunction over years and years
[31:58] and years and years and so when the
[32:01] truth is brought out plainly and flatly
[32:04] it actually would you I mean it would
[32:07] make a woman off the streets just get up
[32:09] and walk out probably but it is the
[32:14] truth and somebody had to bring that
[32:17] truth and if you are a sister then you
[32:22] shouldn't take this personal that it's
[32:25] against you personally because he
[32:27] specific specifically says he's speaking
[32:30] of an immoral woman and how Satan used
[32:35] the immoral woman to Cas to to to to
[32:40] start the sin and all of the wickedness
[32:43] that we see today is because of an
[32:45] immoral woman that's in the natural but
[32:47] on the spiritual side he does it with
[32:49] the church as well and
[32:52] so
[32:53] um that point has to be highlighted
[32:56] because it seems like every time it's
[32:58] brought up even our our sisters because
[33:02] it just is like men against woman or
[33:05] it's a male dominant theology or is it
[33:08] us against them it's not that at all
[33:10] it's the truth of where everything
[33:13] started and where sin started from and
[33:16] then what that does is in that Vision
[33:19] like I said we played a part of that
[33:21] vision for you on Sunday night of the
[33:24] true church and the false church and if
[33:26] brother brandham saw a vision of what
[33:28] the false Church look like in the future
[33:31] then tell me why I would want to be
[33:34] associated with anything that the false
[33:37] church had was identified what was she
[33:40] she had cut frizzy hair tons of makeup
[33:43] sexily dressed dancing to rock and roll
[33:45] music so if there's a Temptation for a
[33:48] true bride member to have to Ward
[33:50] against or church it would be those four
[33:52] wouldn't you say if the false one looks
[33:55] like that in the future before we got
[33:58] here before any church in Tucson he saw
[34:00] this Vision
[34:01] 1962 of a true bride and then the false
[34:04] bride the false Church what she looked
[34:07] like in the sight of God so immorally
[34:10] dressed that it caused him to blush it
[34:13] was disgusting to him and in the sight
[34:15] of God this is what it looks like so for
[34:19] us moving forward wouldn't that be the
[34:22] warning to watch out for wouldn't that
[34:25] be the statement wouldn't that be the
[34:26] Forefront of what we would be preaching
[34:29] and teaching and warning okay so there's
[34:31] the teaching part of the message uh
[34:34] marriage and divorce just getting the
[34:36] scriptures on it
[34:38] now
[34:40] also apart from the teaching part of
[34:43] marriage and divorce what this message
[34:46] did for us under the seventh seal and
[34:49] the opening of the word and this great
[34:52] Pillar of Fire that came down in our
[34:55] city that was witnessed by others
[34:58] granted the
[35:00] prophet the not the not the freedom to
[35:04] preach marriage and divorce but to
[35:07] give forgiveness for those that were
[35:11] caught in the The Snare of this false
[35:16] teaching and false Doctrine marriage and
[35:18] divorce there's a reason why people
[35:21] would marry Remar divorce two times
[35:24] three times and brother brandham tells
[35:26] us why he said it's because of false
[35:28] teaching not waiting on the Lord and
[35:31] then he says
[35:33] misinterpret
[35:35] theology this is why you married the
[35:38] second time or third time first are not
[35:40] waiting on the Lord but let me bring out
[35:42] one small little point before we read a
[35:45] couple of things before we close let's
[35:46] turn to Matthew 19 here just briefly
[35:49] quickly so many things on our heart here
[36:00] Matthew chapter
[36:03] 19 in verse number
[36:07] six let's start with
[36:10] verse
[36:12] number so we read through nine let's
[36:14] take number 10 his disciples said unto
[36:18] him if the case of the man be so with
[36:22] his wife look what they say it is not
[36:25] good to marry I mean mean Jesus is now
[36:28] telling them about marriage and divorce
[36:31] and he that married her that had been
[36:33] married before he's living in adultery
[36:36] whosoever Marth her which is put away
[36:38] doth commit adultery his disciples said
[36:40] unto him if the case of the man be so
[36:43] with his wife it is not good to marry
[36:46] but he said unto them all men cannot
[36:49] receive this saying save they to whom it
[36:53] is
[36:55] given for there are some Unix which were
[36:58] so born from their mother's womb there
[37:01] are some um um Unix which were made Unix
[37:07] of men and there be Unix which have made
[37:10] themselves Unix for the kingdom of
[37:13] Heaven's Sake he that is able to receive
[37:16] it let him receive it so we understand
[37:22] that the understanding or the opening
[37:25] the real Covenant of marriage and
[37:27] divorce course under this message
[37:30] everybody can't receive
[37:31] it and here Jesus now brings up the
[37:36] issue of a unic the three kinds one
[37:39] that's made himself for the word of God
[37:41] one that's made him unic by men one that
[37:44] is born a unic and let me ask the
[37:47] question to you if you had to live to be
[37:50] a unic for the word of God's sake I
[37:52] believe a True
[37:54] Believer
[37:55] would they could
[37:58] they have to be able to you might not
[38:01] think you can but if you have to you
[38:04] would if you had to stand alone for the
[38:07] word of God's sake you certainly would a
[38:10] True Believer would and here Jesus is
[38:14] opening this up this understanding to
[38:17] the disciples and he simply says
[38:19] everybody can't receive it so in my work
[38:22] space I meet different people my family
[38:25] different ones this is the foremost
[38:28] question marriage and divorce it's the
[38:30] um reason why many of the problems we
[38:33] have today um this is it's tied into why
[38:37] women want to be pretty it ties into why
[38:40] she wants attention she wants to be
[38:43] beautiful and pretty and then Satan gets
[38:45] in there it's all tied in there and so
[38:48] hearing this message two or three times
[38:50] this week this was the first time so I
[38:53] went into the store here the other day I
[38:55] think yesterday day before yesterday and
[38:57] this uh little woman served me some uh
[39:01] where where I was and she's all meded up
[39:05] and had attached and just dressed
[39:07] horribly and I just was listening to
[39:09] this message this is the first time that
[39:11] I really felt sorry for her as I left my
[39:15] heart broke just thinking of the Trap
[39:20] that Satan had the soul caught up in it
[39:25] it's not a judgment it's what it is and
[39:28] it's a soul that needs to be delivered
[39:30] this is the first
[39:31] time and I think if you read the message
[39:35] in the Bible and then it makes you cry
[39:38] then maybe you're reading it
[39:40] right if it gets to you like that then
[39:43] maybe you're hearing it the way God
[39:45] designed I don't think we read it and we
[39:47] come out and want to preach against
[39:49] folks and go tear people apart and go
[39:52] argue I think it really tears you up and
[39:55] humbles you to really get that down on
[39:57] your knees and pray for somebody that's
[40:00] caught in this trap so let the Lord
[40:03] speak to you on this like I said if you
[40:04] haven't heard it in the last six months
[40:06] to a year I would I'd say you go back
[40:09] and hear it there's so much in there so
[40:12] the part after the teaching of it after
[40:15] the scriptures associated with it you
[40:18] know he says in there he can but she
[40:22] can't there's no grounds for her at all
[40:25] he says there's a place in there where
[40:27] he he's talking about the dues and the
[40:29] don'ts how a minister can only marry a
[40:32] virgin a priest can only marry a virgin
[40:36] and how that uh King David though he was
[40:40] not a minister he could marry more than
[40:43] one because he was a king not a priest
[40:46] but a priest or Minister that was one of
[40:48] the things that brother Brandon brings
[40:50] out in there and gives us scriptures for
[40:52] it so all those things are in there and
[40:55] our young people
[40:57] need to know that amen and not just our
[41:00] young people all of us really all of us
[41:03] really need to know that because you
[41:06] know if if you are tempted to look at a
[41:10] woman that's immorally dressed then
[41:14] you'll know exactly who's tempting you
[41:17] if you're a man it will it will put you
[41:19] in notice that Satan is trying to catch
[41:23] you man he's trying to get you to to
[41:26] just take us half of a second to think a
[41:29] thought or to just dwell on it just a
[41:32] moment and when you you realize that it
[41:34] was Satan that chose this for the fall
[41:38] of all of humanity that got a Son of God
[41:42] Adam to Forfeit everything over this one
[41:46] little
[41:47] act then you'll know how to place these
[41:51] things a little bit better so it's not a
[41:53] message it really should open up to all
[41:55] of our hearts okay all right so that's
[41:58] my ADM admonishment to you is that the
[42:02] other thing is brother
[42:04] brandham at the end of this
[42:08] message tells
[42:11] us that it was under these
[42:15] seals that this had opened to him
[42:18] paragraph number 80 I'll just read that
[42:20] quickly
[42:33] and I and I really want to make that
[42:35] point clear because I think brother
[42:36] brandom I believe he made it clear in
[42:39] the message but if you're not catching
[42:42] the feeling of what he's saying you'll
[42:44] take it that you know here they go
[42:47] They're talking against the women again
[42:49] or the brothers preaching against the
[42:50] sisters why are you getting on that he's
[42:53] not talking against the sisters he's
[42:55] talking about an immoral moral woman and
[42:59] if you are being influenced by immoral
[43:02] woman you need to know where that's
[43:04] coming from man or woman this is not
[43:08] about the sisters need to be careful
[43:10] this is about the men more than
[43:14] anything you find out who's behind that
[43:18] pretty dress or pretty whatever it is
[43:20] you find out if you could pull back and
[43:23] see a dark demon there trying to catch
[43:26] your soul
[43:27] you'll stop looking at that you'll step
[43:30] back you say Lord help me
[43:34] amen now the prophet says this in
[43:36] paragraph number
[43:39] 80 we have two thoughts on this marriage
[43:42] and divorce and now that our Lord has
[43:45] opened the seven sealed mystery of his
[43:47] word to us in this last day now many of
[43:51] you this might be Greek to you but my
[43:53] church understands by what and you heard
[43:57] of the visions and what taken place and
[44:00] the question is a Bible question we are
[44:03] invited here to believe there must be a
[44:06] true answer to the whole hidden secret
[44:11] Secrets secret that's been hid since the
[44:14] foundation of the world and the Bible
[44:17] prophesies and says that in this day
[44:20] these secrets would be made known
[44:23] Revelations 10 and at the sounding of
[44:25] the seventh angel the leod deia
[44:29] messenger the mysteries of God would be
[44:31] made known and this is the last age
[44:35] which is Le oysa let's take it one more
[44:38] time in paragraph number
[44:52] 318 so as it is today Lord God at the
[44:55] end of the world as we are here here
[44:57] under the mercy of God knowing that soon
[45:01] we are to answer in his presence and
[45:04] that you have did so much Lord I am sure
[45:07] in the sight of these people they'll
[45:09] hang on to this like it come from you
[45:12] and to Bear record here today of many
[45:14] people sitting here that even saw that
[45:17] sign up in the mountain where the angels
[45:20] of the Lord came in the Whirlwind where
[45:22] it came in the seven angels where the
[45:25] revealing of the seven Mysteries was
[45:27] unfolded and that same angel in the same
[45:31] direction on the same mountain today
[45:35] that this was
[45:38] revealed so that really highlights this
[45:41] message for us Saints this is not I
[45:44] heard it before and leave it on the sh
[45:47] this is very comprehensive this is very
[45:51] like right now for
[45:53] us I'll make one next point before my
[45:57] final statement here is that in that
[46:01] vision of the
[46:03] bride and the one I think we heard
[46:06] brother brandom says that the um the few
[46:10] in the back not the first but in the
[46:12] last day the last part they got out of
[46:16] Step remember that in the vision he said
[46:18] he saw the bride first and then and he
[46:21] brings out how the this bride was from
[46:23] all nations of the world the differ
[46:26] different countries that they were from
[46:29] showing that the bride comes from all
[46:31] over and then he brings out that right
[46:33] at the end there there was a few that
[46:35] got out of step and he has to watch them
[46:38] he said they got out of Step looking at
[46:42] that worldly
[46:43] church this what he says it's in it's in
[46:46] there she was looking at that worldly
[46:48] church and so the Temptation is and I've
[46:51] said it here many times that our example
[46:55] for worship or teaching or theology
[46:57] doesn't come from the worldly Church the
[46:59] other church that doesn't mean they
[47:02] don't have great ideas that doesn't mean
[47:04] they they're not Believers or Christians
[47:07] but when it comes to setting a an
[47:10] example in the word of God it's got to
[47:12] come from this
[47:14] message amen so what happens is with
[47:20] vashy what she did could have influenced
[47:22] the rest of the women in the nation from
[47:24] the little girls up and so so the
[47:28] Temptation one woman influencing another
[47:33] woman One Church being influenced by
[47:36] another church when our influence should
[47:39] be from the word of God Amen and this is
[47:43] where most of the Styles come from women
[47:45] watch other women and this is this you
[47:49] know they have that what they call the
[47:51] catwalk or whatever it is that they're
[47:53] designing these clothes and they now
[47:56] they have men doing it too
[47:58] but not that I've watched them but I've
[48:01] seen a little
[48:02] bit um and they're showcasing the latest
[48:06] and the
[48:06] greatest and these people go and you
[48:09] watch that and you sisters don't tell me
[48:11] that it don't C kind of catch you
[48:14] Brothers you see something sharp see
[48:16] something nice it's going to catch your
[48:17] eye too I mean your shoes whatever
[48:19] you're wearing is great now but you get
[48:22] you got to get the new version or the
[48:24] new style you just got to be careful
[48:26] with that because
[48:27] this is what the false
[48:29] church had for them they had the entire
[48:32] world looking at at them and that is not
[48:36] our example our example is a word and we
[48:39] want to be represented in that word so
[48:43] Joshua
[48:44] says um the Lord tells Joshua to take
[48:47] the laws of Moses and read them how
[48:51] often day and night to meditate on them
[48:56] day and night so that means that you'd
[49:00] have to listen to this message or
[49:02] whatever word
[49:04] day and night it's a multiple hour it's
[49:08] a multiple day of listening it's not a
[49:11] one-time listening it's told them day
[49:13] and night that's encompasses your whole
[49:15] day not just Sunday morning not just
[49:17] Sunday night but it's all of it in
[49:20] between so we meditate on the word and
[49:23] we meditate on the day and night so here
[49:27] is what the prophet said and this is the
[49:29] challenge that he laid to us in
[49:33] paragraph number
[49:36] 3:14 he says now paragraph 3:14 now you
[49:39] believe this to be true and believe it
[49:41] come from God and by the Vindication of
[49:44] his cloud and his message that's brought
[49:47] me this far should not the god upon the
[49:50] mountain permit me to do the same thing
[49:53] to suffer you to go on the way you are
[49:56] and do it no more go with your wives
[50:00] live in peace for the hour is late the
[50:03] coming of the Lord is at hand we haven't
[50:06] got time to break these things up don't
[50:09] you dare try to do it again I'm speaking
[50:14] only to my congregation but if you are
[50:17] married and God bore me witness of that
[50:19] on the mountain that I could say this a
[50:22] supernatural Revelation because of the
[50:24] opening of the seven seals and this is a
[50:29] question in God's word let them go on in
[50:34] as they are and sin no
[50:37] more it wasn't so from the beginning
[50:40] that's right it wasn't so and it will
[50:42] not be at the end but under modern
[50:47] conditions as God's servant I won't I
[50:51] won't call myself his Prophet but I
[50:53] believe maybe if I wouldn't be sent for
[50:55] that I'm laying the ground for him when
[50:57] he does come so under the modern
[51:00] conditions I command you to go to your
[51:03] home with your wife now if you're happy
[51:06] with her live with her raise your
[51:09] children in admonition of God but God be
[51:12] merciful to you if you ever do that
[51:15] again you teach your children to never
[51:18] do a thing like that bring them up in
[51:21] the admonition of God and now that you
[51:24] are as you are let's go on now at the
[51:28] late evening hour that we're living in
[51:31] and press towards the mark of the high
[51:33] calling in Christ where all things will
[51:36] be
[51:38] possible so he gives us the Commandment
[51:40] to teach our children these
[51:44] things um and our children need to know
[51:48] these things you know the callings of
[51:51] God and these strict Covenant of
[51:56] marriage and divorce according to the
[51:58] seven
[52:00] seal like I say I'm talking with my
[52:02] family and different people out there I
[52:04] don't bring them they're under a
[52:06] different Covenant they're not in the
[52:07] message so I don't they that's what I
[52:10] think I tell them brother Ram says you
[52:12] go talk to your pastor you need to pray
[52:15] about it you need to go and you know I
[52:18] try not to get too I don't put a burden
[52:21] on people that they can't bear cuz this
[52:24] right here is nobody else teaching in it
[52:26] like this I mean this is really is is
[52:29] not given to for everybody to receive
[52:32] and the world today they're taught from
[52:34] the cradle all the way up a false
[52:36] theology a false teaching of marriage
[52:39] and divorce and theyve living their
[52:41] lives that way and so um but when it
[52:45] comes to this word and this message we
[52:47] want to constantly put that before our
[52:51] class in our own minds and our own
[52:53] thinking and it really will help you to
[52:57] understand why things are the way they
[52:59] are why it's gone the way it's gone
[53:03] everything has been
[53:06] sexualized why everything is all just
[53:09] about even the men want to look pretty
[53:13] and look they got makeup for men and men
[53:15] spend more time in the mirror now well
[53:17] don't get me
[53:19] started potions and creams and soft skin
[53:24] and the the fluff in the I'm talking
[53:27] about a man now fluff in
[53:31] the you looking too cute
[53:36] man and that's coming from somewhere
[53:39] that's coming from somewhere that's that
[53:42] that's that feminization of
[53:45] everybody the men want to be feminized
[53:47] want to look cute and their fingernails
[53:50] filed and I I like clean fing nails too
[53:53] but it's like like it's so overboard
[53:57] with this prettiness and then why does
[54:00] everybody want to be attractive and
[54:02] pretty it's it goes back to that
[54:04] original sin and who's behind that
[54:06] brother Bram the word of God tells us
[54:08] that God chose that vessel to start all
[54:12] of the sin rolling and this is where
[54:14] we're at today exactly where we are
[54:16] today and when you can recognize that as
[54:18] a brother then it puts everything in
[54:21] check it's not so pretty after all
[54:25] you'll weeping cry for these people that
[54:28] they that that the Lord will get a hold
[54:30] of them hopefully somebody get saved
[54:33] amen so God bless you we trust the Lord
[54:36] will let us go into our prayer meeting
[54:39] and think on those
[54:41] things how many have their own copy of
