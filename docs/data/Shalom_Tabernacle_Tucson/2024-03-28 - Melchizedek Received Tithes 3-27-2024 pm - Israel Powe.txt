of prayer Lord Jesus we thank you for bringing us together once again Lord we thank you for the atmosphere of your presence Lord the Praises of your people you inhabit the Praises and Lord is a sacrifice many times but receive our our the fruits of our lips give him praise Lord receive that tonight Lord we give you the honor the glory and all the praise we ask your blessings upon each one father in Jesus name amen amen God bless each of you we're so happy to be in the house of the Lord with you this evening like to welcome all our visitors and friends and Saints of the most high God give you welcome you to the house of the Lord this evening we wanted to continue just a little bit a little series we started on conduct order and Doctrine and then uh we didn't we went through just to give it a title I guess conduct and then so tonight I wanted to go through the orders and I'll start that tonight and we'll see how far the Lord will bring us through that I felt definitely led to do it when I started it and I didn't know exactly how to approach it but the Lord has just led me um thus far with it I believe it's for our little group of people here that worship here I don't believe we we have our own tape Ministries to go around the world I believe that you're called to a little local Fellowship as as we are here then we're responsible to that amen and I thank God for that amen and so while we're standing we'll take the scriptures and turn into Hebrews chapter 7 in verse number four now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils verily they that are of the sons of Levi who receive the office of the priesthood have commandment to take tithes of the people according to to the law that is of their Brethren though they come out of the loins of Abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises and with all and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witness that he liveth and as I may so say Levi also who received tithes paid tithes in Abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when MDC met him amen we'll take one more Old Testament scripture Malachi chapter 3 verse number seven even from the days of your fathers you have gone away from mine uh ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and I will return unto you sayeth the Lord of hosts but you said wherein shall we return will a man rob God yet ye have robbed me but you say wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings you are cursed with the curse for ye have robbed me even this whole nation bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now herewith sayeth the Lord of hosts if I will not open you the windows if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it and I will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast her fruit before the time in the field saith the Lord of hosts and All Nations shall call you what does it say blessed for ye shall be a delightsome land saith the Lord of host amen we'll ask God's blessings on this portion of his word you may be seated amen so tonight very um solid and uh trivial I'd say Elementary uh portion of the word and that is tithing the pain of tithing and the title of my message tonight will be mezc receive tithe so as we look into this text of scripture there is a group of protestant Christians that don't believe that tithing is for the New Testament Church they believe that was an Old Testament law and that was one of the laws that was done away with in the Old Testament which is not true because Genesis 14 is the first time we hear of tithes being paid and that was Abram before his name was changed now Abram paid ties to MDC before Moses was even on the scene his son Jacob grandson Jacob also in Genesis chapter 28 he paid tithes also before his name was changed and so this was preaw that the uh 10th or or this order of tithing was instituted now for the believer um there's so many quotations for us in the ministry we know what brother vam said about it but it's still a touchy topic that pastors don't want to talk on I think this is my first time to bring a subject on it but don't get mad at me get mad at the quotes well if you're going to get mad get mad at the quotes Okay this should be one of those Revival type sermons and Revival means to kick up all the trash clean up so I I I I'm taking this portion in in the word of God because of the orders part now we took a message last week Wednesday and we read for you or replayed a portion of the tape in in that message I believe it was questions and answers on um um see pardon me law having a shadow questions and answers and brother bandam says this in that message paragraph number seven he says this last evening after the service was over there was a man came to the platform which was a Christian Scientist man been attending the meetings and what a great compliment he passed when he said he never heard that type of teaching he never heard the Bible so well explained and just go to show I walk right out at the church and someone standing out there and said that guy sure is an impostor well of course that someone that backslid from the Tabernacle here and went away with that group not long ago three or four of them pulled away let this church hear this pastor and all regardless if those people who left this church they went out from us because there was wasn't of us said the Bible see that's right and we went to them with brotherly and godly love one after another trying to reconcile them to the church and um they wouldn't listen they taking groups uh and went with them they wouldn't listen then we told it to the church and the Bible says let them be as a heathen Publican that's right they cannot come back in the church without first coming before the church and repenting before the church and then repenting before God and then be brought back and see how they act after that they cannot come back unless the Bible That's Bible teaching we must stay with this Bible and I thought that was a very solid quote brother brandham puts in there he also remember there's a nice hot one on on um birth control all right I mean remember that it's very brother Bon was very clear on that and then uh and so um those are things that are in the word that we look at and you start with that first now there's exceptions to the rules and you have your reason and you have your uh the way you handle your family matters and all that that kind of stuff but you always start with the word first you don't do things because everybody else is doing it and the point of it is you stay with what the word of God has given to us and this message brother random is dealing with the church and he's talking about or the Neville and the pastors and he was talking about the people there how they um how we could have a a more complete Church wouldn't you want that how many remember the tape and and and so he was dealing with the people on that and pointing them into that direction and so he continues in that same message in paragraph number 12 and he says this and before we start the morning Sabbath teaching which I hope not to take too long whatever the Lord will then I want to answer this now remember Church you every one of you know what this church stands for you absolutely understand now we don't have any membership we just have Fellowship see because if we have membership then we bring the people like to an organization which we are strictly inter denominational unorganized only one thing to lead us that's the Holy Spirit and we believe that the Holy Spirit leads through our leaders if God set a holy spirit Holy Spirit set a teacher in the church then if the Holy Spirit wants the church to know something theme he'll speak through the teacher for the Holy Spirit that's what the teacher is ordained to do is that right it's ordained that gift is in the church as a teacher and we should all listen to it until that gift goes proving something that isn't right in the Bible then we have a right to question it as long as it's not you go saying well there's no such a thing as water baptism there's no such a thing as this that or the other or the baptism of the Holy Ghost then question that see but now the Holy Spirit leads now the church believes in the bapt in baptism in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins after repentance it believes in baptism of the holy spirit with the fruits of the spirit following the fruits of the spirit longsuffering gentleness patience goodness meekness we believe in nine spiritual gifts all nine of them wisdom knowledge teachers Apostles prophets Gifts of tongues interpretation of tongues divide healing those things we believe we believe in church government and the government is ordered of the holy spirit in the Bible the pastor is always the head of the church the pastor is always that's God's Elder in organizations you have to come through the bishop there's no higher order in the Bible than the Elder of the church just tell me where it's at there's no higher order in the Bible so brother random says that we believe in church government and that's kind of the direction we'll go on this order now um the Lord sets in the church obviously leaders and taking sides with Jesus brother random calls ministers he calls them captains like in the Old Testament they were captains and they fought in the battle and they fought the War they were out there uh leading the way they had a charge they had um a responsibility there's a qualifications and these things are directly set up when you come into any organized group of people you'll find out real quick uh how they run things what they care about I was just buying Rock just the other day and uh I went into the place to buy some rock and I was really shocked at the the nice atmosphere that they had there this particular location and I bought and rock a number of times for for some stuff I'm doing at home and the other location just rough Grump Grumble um nobody's really happy it's like hurry up tell me what you want you get that that feeling and I noted that you know this really impressed me and so the guy that delivered the rock we was just chatting it up he's been to our house a few times and I ain't seen him in several months and I noted that to him and he and he told me he says uh the reason is that other office over there he knew exactly what I was talking about now nobody didn't do me wrong okay I got my rock I'm just buying Rock okay and nobody did me wrong but there was an atmosphere and an attit ude there and it was very clear that the office that where the people were very pleasant and nice I can guarantee almost guess what their boss would be like cuz that comes from somewhere that's not an accident I mean that's deliberate and it's the same way when you go to a church you go to a church there's Warmness there's people who love you people who care people who will reach out to you you um those are people that's really listening to tapes that's right amen I'm not talking about just playing a tape I'm talking about these are people that actually listen to the tapes that actually read their Bible and internalize what they're listening to and what they're reading all right amen and so you know these you know it it comes from somewhere and the way we our church is is ordered and structured that's because that's the way we are taught from the word of God now this uh message I'll take in the message God's provided way of healing and then I'll get into the little subject here just for a moment paragraph number seven brother ad says in the Old Testament there was three ways that they could get a message that was by a Prophet by a dreamer or by the law now if the prophet prophesied and on the breast of Aaron was the urum of tham if the lights flash on the urum of tham that Prophet was telling the truth but if the lights didn't flash on the urum thund then it was wrong if a dreamer dreamed a dream and told that dream and it didn't flash on the urum thund it was wrong the prophet if he prophesied all the lights didn't flash he was wrong and the urum Thum from the priesthood was taken away but here is the urum of Thum of the priesthood today the word of God if a dreamer or a prophet or a preacher or anything teaches contrary to this Bible it's wrong amen let him be a curse but it must but it must uh be built solidly upon this word thus sayeth the Lord and if this word is correctly set in order and taught by the minister God's solemnly under obligation ation to his son to answer that word and fulfill it I want you to believe that now let me read that again if it's correctly set in order and taught by the minister God's solemnly under obligation to his son to answer that word and fulfill it now that's the way I believe the Bible I believe every word of it now there may be times that I may not be able to set it together I don't believe there any mortal in the world can correctly set every word together but we only can as the Holy Spirit inspires us to do many times it's contrary to our teaching amen all right now the prophet of God said also that in that message questions and answers the law having in the shadow um I didn't pick it up here but if you can go back there sis to that one in paragraph number 17 I want to read something out of there he talked about you know he's getting he's kind of talking to his home Church there yeah go up just a little bit let me see what that was up there all right now in the order to the church we just trust that God will keep you perfect and your heart stayed upon him him and remember friend this glorious church that we've been talking about in this last week why can't we have that here on eth and Pin Street we got the qualifications we got the people who love God don't you believe that we got people in here I see stranger strangers in here that come in since brother Neville has been Pastor here fine people I meet them here at the altar people from Louisville people from Henryville new Aly and around people that I don't even know I've never seen them in my life wonderful people now wouldn't you all like to have a real Bible Church a real Bible Church where all the spiritual gifts were set in order yes everything making manifest just exactly the way it should be wouldn't that be wonderful now you're going to have to sacrifice not money okay you're going to have to sacrifice what some of your own IDE is you're going to have to sacrifice some time in prayer you're going to have to sacrifice maybe a stubborn will to break down in humility see you're going to have the whole Christian move is sacrificial he that will follow me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me daily is that right how often do you have to sacrifice every day Paul said he died daily every day he died so the Christian Life is sacrifice it's giving it is actually an offering you offering yourself and the greatest offering that was ever offered the greatest gift that was ever given was displayed right here at Calvary yes sir that was an offering you'll never be able to beat that gift you can't beat god-given he he gave the best that he could give he gave himself for you and I what an offering what an offering our praise and our worship is just a little touch of what he gave we give the fruits of our lips in Praise it's offering it's worship ship that's what it is that's what the song service is all about it's not about singing in the right key and who's singing who's clapping who's not it's not about that it's about you giving God an offering from your lips giving praise to his name amen that was a great offering right there and so brother Ram tells us that our worship and offering that tithings is a part of our worship um many times we look at it like okay you're a Christian all right you got baptized you come to church you're Christian now you got a job you got to give a dime out of a dollar and I was just like you know that equation my mom would drill it in our head 10% you got to give that and it's an order yes it's a duty yes but really it's a worship that's right it's a worship amen what we give is a worship back to God and so brother bam deals with this sacrifice we start by giving in our life in the message um the adoption 1960 paragraph number 144 just right above 144 he says God has given to her she's a member of the body of Christ yes sir I believe that I seen that done and I know that's true but it is is get the church in order set in order so we can work brother man's talking about setting the church in order God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same the prophet of God says this here paragraph 45 and so now he's dedicating he's rededicating the church and look at what he says here's the morning when I dedicated and laid the Cornerstone there as a young man I prayed for its standing to see the coming of Jesus Christ and when I did owing thousands of dollars you can take up an offering in a congregation this size and get 30 or 40 cents but I wanted to to bring that quote that you know like you know a church starting isn't a halfhazard thing if it's God that started the work and I believe that church that work should last until Jesus comes I want you to think about that for a moment if God's going to start a group or a church or get a a a a work his work preaching the Good News of the gospel and call and elect someone out of the qualifications of the fivefold ministry that's not something that starts today and then we quit and then I feel like starting again and then you know maybe not or maybe so that's too undeliberately God is very deliberate and here in brother bam dedicated the Tabernacle 1933 he prayed that it would last and stand until the coming of the Lord and it's still standing today isn't that nice so look at the longevity of it look at the long range vision of it as he brings it and so brother brandom goes forward and tells us that an altar is a church he says this and glorified Jesus he says Cain was an Infidel Cain Cain wasn't an Infidel Cain was a Believer Cain didn't come saying now I don't believe there is such a thing as God Cain come as a Believer he was trying to find Grace with God and Cain built an altar an altar is a church a place of worship then Cain built an altar and not only that but Cain brought an offering and made a sacrif ice and not only that brother manam continues on he says it again and I will restore 1955 paragraph number 16 he says now Cain and Abel both come to Worship the Lord Cain built a church he built an altar an altar is a place of worship and Cain brought a sacrifice and Cain believed God and Cain worshiped God so we see that an altar is a church and so we come to the church that's where we come to give our sacrifice the great sacrifice is ourself and we give the fruits of our lips giving praise we give our life and this is a very very deliberate we build a church you're building an altar an altar to the only true God Amen and so we see this that in the order of things you have to have have these leaders that God calls to be a part in this church we'll call them Gatekeepers we'll call them you know the authorities we'll call them First Responders or the Watchmen or the five ministering gifts you got to have somebody who has that Watchmen and groups of men that has this calling in their life to hold this word above anything else in the military there's ranks and there's orders to them and they they they have to know how to fight they have to know their weapon they have to know a strategy they have to know how to give orders and to take orders and that's just a military and you know and and God is constructing his church he has placed in the church these checks and balances and people that are Gatekeepers and watching uh uh over the direction of the church direction of people we don't come here with our blinders on not worried about other people that's not a true leader you don't come here thinking about just yourself Christianity is living for others I guarantee you when uh it's your last day here if you have time to take inventory of your life you're not going to be wishing you had more time to to run up and down in the malls or to do your you know to your your little things that you like to have fun about you're going to think about how did you help other people amen how did you contribute did you change somebody's life these are the important things did you leave a legacy for somebody to pick up did you start something that was actually beautiful that's blossoming and fruiting that outlives you that's that's that's what's the important thing so one of the quotes I got here I called a a precious brother he he he's he's got a death wish a death uh uh thing on him with this cancer and um brother Glenn tomson called him just the other day and I was already preparing this and I just greeted him was talking to him and he said brother Israel he said uh you know his life that he lived he served the Lord and he said that there was a quote he came AC cross and this really struck him was how brother brandom says that you can rob god with your time and I started to think about that CU you know we we try to put God on a Time budget and work God into our schedule when actually you wouldn't even be here or have any breath or life if God didn't give it to you amen and so if God gave gave you breath in life whose interest should you be concerned about first who should be first in your life when it comes to time not your career not what's com coming in your bank account not your friends or popularity it's him it's God first and that's what Jesus did he was about his father's business not Costco's business or uh uh what's that uh the the the thing that they sell things Amazon's business and everybody else's he was about the father's business and we can actually Rob god with our time I'll get to the quote here in just a minute if the Lord will help me but these thoughts came to him at this time in his life as he's numbering talking about brother Glenn as he's numbering his days he's calling for God to heal him he's asking God for more time but the real important thing is Lord the time that I have I want that to be the best quality time with you you see all the other carnal things that everybody are fighting about and suing people about and getting upset about and all that kind of stuff they can have it but for a Believer we've been called to something greater something so much greater this is why we're here tonight on a Wednesday night going to church you got the little bit Bitties getting them ready for church you got the little kid you got school tomorrow why y'all going to church what's going on with that don't you need some sleep don't you need to raise a you know a responsible parent to make sure the kids got plenty of sleep but we've been called to something greater than just getting plenty of sleep I want my kids to receive the Holy Ghost that's the most important thing most important Legacy it's the somebody get saved filled with the Holy Ghost yes yes and so this is an altar and we come and we bring to this altar I'll just read some quotes here brother bam talks about on tithes per and he says this here and let's see God 1959 paragraph 28 but you know I feel like this that a member of a church Church their first obligation is with their tithe and offering is to support their church if you are members of These Fine churches that's represented here you support your church that's your first duty to God bring your tith and offering into the storehouse and the storehouse you surely know what that is is where you get your food yeah so there is where you get your spiritual food and your obligation is to your church and not not to an evangelist like me question number 146 in God being misunderstood it's paragraph 111 brother brandham don't you feel that everyone who claims to be a Christian should pay tithes pay their tithes into the storehouse of the Lord please give scripture to this question all right if you will that is right the Bible said in Malachi the 4th chapter will a man Rob God and you say where have you robbed thee in tithe and offerings bring all the tithe and offerings into my Storehouse and prove me sayeth the Lord if I will not open up the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that there will not be room enough to receive that's a challenge to any individual and if I only had time I would not get to this little scripture that I wish to about the next 10 minutes I would give you a personal testimony how that even hungry and my mother and them hungry and my daddy sick but I took my ties out first and give it to God you ought to see what happened I have never seen in my life that any man or woman that if you only make $1 a week will bring that 10 cents of that money and put it into the storehouse of of a church where you come if God don't bless that call call me a hypocrite yes sir that's a challenge to anybody and every Christian that goes to this other question every Christian should pay tithes that's right it should be done all right the redeem have this praise in their heart and their lips they have a praise that the Angels don't have they have the praise that the nothing else in creation has a praise like God that's right can't nobody worship like a redeemer son and daughter of God and when we get over there we will praise and worship and the angels will stop back and listen to us because they don't know what we talking about they don't know what it was to be lost but now you're found sick but now healed lost but now you've been forgiven and when we praise him the Angels brother B says they'll line the curvature of the earth and sit back and listen to us the redeemed of the Lord praise the name of the Lord amen CU he gives us that bless his wonderful name Hallelujah now brother vam he says that he he makes this statement and I thought this is really nice good to see brother Nathaniel back there he says this about the elected this is very sweet it's very nice images of Christ 195 59 paragraph 156 he says this oh lord it's in his prayer oh Lord your God and your God forever more oh my and we're so happy to know that you promised that you would have a Remnant when you come to the Earth regardless of what goes or comes there's going to be a people that's going to be ready we know that there is a Tiding that men gives to God and there is a tithing amongst the people perhaps maybe we would say a tenth of all the world's Harvest Through the Ages will be that elected that's been called so not only do we give a tithe we actually are the tithe we are part of the elected that is on the earth I love how the prophet brings that that of the elected this is the part that belongs to God we're the dime out of a doar to God that's the elected amen these are the elected ones throughout all of the world's history the redeemed out of the ages a large saved group but amongst that saved group there's an elected attent like Levi Levi was a type of the Bride they're selected they're that that elected por in the 10th part I thought that was really nice to think of yourself as a tithe to the Lord that's been elected to him the tithing is the Lord's not ours in the first place now brother random deals with this in the queen God hiding himself in Simplicity I got two quotes I read here paragraph 65 so that is inspired and directly hung in its right place and I'm so thankful to be the one on the right side I trust that he has forgiven me for I as far as literally stealing anything as I know I never did in my life but I've so misused his time till I stole that way and I've done many things that I shouldn't do and I'm grateful to God this morning that he has forgiven my sins have you ever thought about stealing God's time you thought about that amen I want you to internalize what would that look like you still in God's time what would that look like to you what would that mean to you you're guilty of stealing God's time what does that mean I mean you're just here existing you got to go to work got to go to school got to go do this and do this so you still in God's time how would you be still in God's time is it possible of course it's possible brother says I never really stole nothing in my life except you know he stole some of God's time so I think that's you know on as I say as our life goes through an inventory you have those near ending time near death experience or those serious moments of your life you really break down all of the things that most of the world calls important and these things right here is what's important brother bam continues on in the queen of Shiva paragraph 180 said that little Queen wanted it but the first thing she wanted to know was it scriptural or not she studied all the scriptures then she said I'm going to do another thing I'm a queen and if that message is right I'm going to support it yeah and she laid in camels with gold mirror frankincense and all kind of COS of Pearl and such she said if it's right if that God is real God then I'm I'm through with this thing I've been serving I'm going to support it with everything I got that's the attitude listen God is not concerned so much about your money but he wants you to support him with all you are he don't want 10% of your money so much as he wants your time your talent your test testimony and all that you are to be given into his hands so he can control you he wants to be your lord not only your savior but your lord lordship to govern you and so brother man continues on how many thank the Lord for that amen so God is wanting our time so tonight we'll have a we'll have a uh our brother George is going to the mission field there here in Jamaica we mentioned it Sunday that we'll be taking missionary offering to add to that little group there and I know some of you may be prepared or not prepared for to give but we'll give you the opportunity to do that tonight and if you have um something you want to give and you can put it on the note or in the offering deal there as a note and then take that from the fund put that in the offering and you can just bring it on Sunday the Lord willing right and so he says here in in giving like that to missionary work it's a quote I've always love and many of the brothers have quoted it over the years and I really like it he says paragraph 47 in the message end time evangelism he says that's the reason I chose today this subject for my last appreciate your fine love offering which will be given me after the service I will promise you there won't be any cigarettes any whiskey anything wrong it'll go for preaching the gospel in Australia and wherever the Lord will send me and a soldier born in the Kingdom there it'll be your credit that the day that I'm only following the leading of the spirit I must do that and you're sending me money your tithing is sending me brother banon says it'll be your credit we can all go but we can get credit for those who do go when we support them with our prayers with our little you know gifts that God has given to us amen God bless each of you tonight pray the Lord Jesus will bless you in your worship as mzd receives TI he still receives TI he does that today and you'll never be able to out out give God you start by giving your time God will increase your time you start by planting the seed that seed would outlive and it just produces more fruit to where you can't you mean a tree produces so much fruit you can't eat it all you got to share with others that's how the Lord God says give Jesus said give and it shall be given unto you good measure press down shaking and running over so men give into your goods that's what Jesus said how many know that that's the cycle of it when God gives to you you give back to him and when he gives you more you get more humble and He blesses you more he get more humble He blesses you more and then oh my thank the Lord for his goodness to us and what he give to us God bless you so let's go to the Lord in prayer yes sorry Leviticus 263 let's turn there thank you John appreciate that I I want to read that yeah Leviticus 26 if you in verse number three how many love the word amen you walk in my statue and keep my Commandments and do them then I will give you rain in due season and the land shall year her increase and the Trees of the field shall yield their fruit and your threshing shall reach unto the Vintage and the Vintage shall reach until the sewing time that's the gra Harvest reaching over to the the other time you're sewing your grapes will still be lasting over what he talking about and you shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land safely and I'll give you peace in the land you shall lie down and none shall make you afraid FS with all their fears and I will rid the evil beasts out of the land neither shall the sword go through your land and you shall Chase your enemies and they shall fall Before You by The Sword and five of you shall Chase what he increase you five you like fighting against 100 and aund of you shall put 10,000 to a flight and your enemy shall fall Before You by The Sword for I will have respect unto you and make you what fruitful and what multiply you and establish my Covenant with you you shall eat old store and bring forth the old because of the new and I will set my Tabernacle among you and my soul shall not abore you I will walk among you and you'll be I will be your God and you shall be my people I am the Lord your God which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt that you should not be their bond men and I have broken the bands of your yoke and made you upright you so and then it goes on if you do not hearken you know he basically says you'll spend your wheels trying to make them old dry plants grow trying to get some rain or trying to get things to happen and pop for you but you messed up over here you didn't keep the laws so you'll be spending your wheels basically beautiful principle that the Lord establishes amen God bless you thank you very let us pray father thank you for your word
