It's good to see everyone around the house of the Lord. Like to ask you if uh Brother Joe could come and just open the service with a word of prayer. God bless you saints. You ready to worship the Lord together tonight? Yes, a few of you are. That's good. And maybe a few more in a moment. We're missing some things tonight. Not only some people, but some windows. So, we're going to try something a little different. Just bear with us. If we have to use that for overflow during the meetings, would like to know if that'll work. So, if you need to go to the restroom and stuff, just be careful with the noise and the doors and all that. People travel a bit. We want to make them as comfortable as we can for the meetings. So, maybe that's a little bit better feel if we have to use that. So, we'll try it tonight and see how it goes. Maybe try it again. So, just bear with us. We'll still use those doors just for emergencies. If we can, we'll just try to minimize distractions. If you go to these other rooms, you're going to be seen. So, just uh be aware of that. And if you have some suggestions or ideas, these chairs are laid out for specific reasons to try to maximize efficiency. Different things are done. If you don't like it, that's okay. Be sure to tell Brother Israel. If you don't want to talk to anybody, you don't have to. Just put it in the comment box. So comments are there for us to help and and try to be a give suggestions and ideas and you can put um good comments in into right brother John about your favorite deacon named Joe and things like that.

We ask your blessings now in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God bless each of you. So happy to be in the house of the Lord with you tonight. Amen. And we welcome you to the house of the Lord. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Let's go to the scripture in the Old Testament, Genesis chapter 14. portion of scripture we've been through a little bit. Um, and we'll continue in that with Abraham going to deliver Lot. In verse number 11, and they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their vituals, and went their way, and they took Lot, Abraham's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram, the Hebrew, for he dwelt in the plain of Mamm the Amorite, brother of Escall, and the brother of Amnner. These were confederate with Abram. When Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them unto Dan. Verse number one in chapter 15. After these things, the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in the vision. Abram in a vision, saying, "Fear not, Abram. I'm thy shield and thy exceedy great reward." And Abram said, "Lord God, what will thou give me? See, I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eleazar of Damascus." Abraham said, "Behold, to me, thou has given no seed. And lo, one born in my house is mine heir." Amen. would just ask God's blessing on his word. You may be seated. And um brother Madam takes this story of Abram and Lot, him going to deliver him. And in the Hebrews message and a couple other messages, he's showing us that Abraham was a type of Christ. And not only a type of Christ, he was a type of the Christian. And as we went through on Sunday morning, what our mission is and Mark 16, Matthew chapter 16 lays out what that mission is. That is what each member of the church, that's what their goal should be. That's what it is. Go ye in all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. That's men, woman, boy, or girl. That's the church's commission. And I say not only is it the church's commission, it's the individual's commission because the individual is the church. And I'll say this that I know that because we're in uh the message that many times we'll lose sight of that portion of the mission to go preach the gospel to every creature. And um the church has been has fallen slack on that. I think the Mormons do a very good job of promoting what they what they believe. The Jehovah Witnesses do a very good job promoting what they do what they believe. and some of these great big min ministries, Christian churches that have these great big television programs, at least they're being made known to the world &gt;&gt; to get their mission across. And I'd say that um because we might fail in the mission, it doesn't mean we do it deliberately. I think that we might not be conscious really of what the mission is. I think sometimes Christians, we believers in the message, we'll get satisfied or we'll get settled in our way of doing things and we fail to go preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; And so after the message on Sunday, I had a conversation with two fine people um from from our church here. I think some of them are here tonight. And um you know there's a little question on how you would go about witnessing. How I would do it versus how you would maybe do it. Um but I think it all starts with prayer. The desire to go first. The mission is go preach the gospel to every creature. Once you have received the truth, brother Bannon says from that time on you are duty bound. &gt;&gt; And I read a very strong quote where he is repenting himself for being dilitary on the amount of souls that he won. He said I won one million soul souls. I should have won 10 million. &gt;&gt; How many remember that? &gt;&gt; And I think that's the attitude of a successful person. I think that they never quit. They never stop. Okay, I hit 300 free throws in a row. Let me get 301. And I think that's the goal. That's the attitude or should be the attitude of the believer. Now, that great commission is found in Matthew as we read it for you in Matthew chapter 16. And then the Bible talks about these signs shall follow them that believe in Mark chapter 16. also in Acts 1 and8 that the power is given to the church um after the Holy Ghost comes upon you. So you need the power in order to be a witness. So let's read that scripture just for a moment as we want to recommission some of you. All right, Acts chapter 1 verse number eight. This is the beginning. The acts are the acts of the apostles or as brother Vanna says the acts of the Holy Spirit in the apostles. But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be what? witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, Judea, also and unto the uttermost parts of Tucson, Arizona. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Uttermost parts of the earth. So the power of the Holy Ghost comes upon the believer so that they can be a witness of Jesus Christ. That is what it's for. go preach the gospel to every creature. And that's a that's a mission. You're commissioned to do that. And I'm just encouraging myself, you, and one another to um to pick up that mission and that great those orders that were laid out for each believer, brothers, sisters, young people, whoever you are, you're part of this great mission. I think I read this on Sunday. If not, I'll read it again. It was the warning that Brother Brandham laid out to us about becoming a denomination and God's only provided place of worship. 1965, he says this in paragraph 148. Now, have you noticed every 3 years after a great meeting, what takes place? A denomination. This is 20 years in no denomination. Dear dying lamb, may it never do that. Did I read that on Sunday? &gt;&gt; I didn't. I had it here to read and I didn't. May it never do that. If I go in this generation, may the people who believe this message never stand still for a denomination. God will dot dot dot. You'll die right in your track. Remember that. the very hour that that the very hour that you mention denomination among you. I don't care how sincere you are. Take man for your leader instead of the Holy Spirit to confirm this word. That's the hour you die. The genuine seed cannot because there's nothing left after the seed. It's the same thing was back at the beginning. It's the bride that fell in the ground to bring forth the corn of wheat again. So that's strong. That is the truth. That's what um it still lays in and to every believer that is a part of this church. This great last day message that God sent to us and that we are supposed to be a witness of. Now, when when we think of witnessing, you know, there's a there's a little there's a struggle that comes with that. And I and I realize that and I realize that, you know, we kind of want, you know, a manual that someone can hand to us of the dos and don'ts when you're witnessing. But it just simply doesn't work that way. uh sons and daughters of God are led by the spirit of God and it is the spirit that made you a son of God and it is the spirit that comes upon the believer that allows him to be a witness. So you can't be a witness without the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; This is not mechanical. This is not okay, let's send so many charts or send me so many cards or send so many pamphlets through the neighborhood and let's just, you know, do some mechanical thing. No, you have to be led by the Holy Spirit. And if the Holy Spirit is leading you to send pamphlets, then send pamphlets. But not everybody's called to do it that way. If the Holy Spirit calls one to stand on the corner there and preach with a megaphone, then the Holy Spirit, that's what that man needs to do. And um but I I believe with all my heart that how to witness or to be an effective witness, you have to wrestle that out yourself. &gt;&gt; It's it's one of those things where every one of us have our own struggles and then like some struggles, I'll pray with you. I'll help you. You help me. You pray with me. But then there's some struggles where if if I help you get out of the eggshell and you're a little chicken, you need to struggle through that. &gt;&gt; You have to develop, you know, it says that that that chicken when he's pecking his way out, he's alive, of course, and then you're you're outside looking at him. You want to help him pull it off. Well, he he's developing his lungs. is developing his neck muscles. He's developing his bones in his little body through that struggle. It It has to be. And And you can peel the shell off and the bird will still live, but it won't it won't survive because it's not strong enough to survive. &gt;&gt; You say it's still alive. It's alive for a little while, but it's not going to survive because we've we've we've bypassed God's way of doing it. And I think that I believe with all of my heart that this mission, the great commission as brother Vanham calls it should be on the forefront of every believer's mind. Um sometimes we want to grow our church or we want the better church with whatever things that makes the church better, nicer choir, better preacher, better ministers, better dress crowd, better whatever. But our really our mission is to go preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; And remember brother Bham in that message he put the challenge. He put the squeeze. He said if you're not winning souls you're guilty. How many you remember that one? &gt;&gt; He said that and that's a challenge. He challenged himself. And so that challenge is put on us uh here as well and the and the greatest of all the ages. Now the prophet takes this example of Abraham. I want you to notice if you just go back to Genesis just for a moment that these four kings had these other five kings under their rulership and domain. Uh Lot which was the nephew of Abraham was in Sodom. And when Shaomar and Tidal and the different kings come together, they went on a campaign taking all these cities that had rebelled against them. They used to pay uh taxes to them. They pay tribute to them. They were their servants. And then they decided to rebel. Well, when they rebelled, they these kings went to go take care of their property that they believe belonged to them. And so they come through and they're just wiping out all of these kings and taking care of all of the property that belongs to them. Four kings against five. And the Bible says in verse 11, "And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their vituals and went their way. They took Lot, Abraham's Abram's brother's son that dwelt in Sodom and his goods and departed. And there came one that had escaped and told Abram the Hebrew, for he dwelt in the plains there in Mammra. Verse 14. And when Abraham heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them unto Dan. Now look at verse 13, though, right at the bottom there. It says, "He dwelt in the plain of Mamm the Amorite, brother of Eshko and brother of Abner." My Bible is faded out right there. Um, Amorite, Eshkaw, and the brother of Anor. And these were confederate with Abram. So, Abraham had help. He had the men that were trained in his own house. 316 or 318. They were born in his own house. You know, I believe in all the quotes, don't you? &gt;&gt; Starting with the ones in the Bible. &gt;&gt; These details are in there for a reason. These are Abraham's servants. They're trained in his own house. And then now he's going to get brothers to help him with this great task of going to get Lot. He divides himself against them. He and his servants by night, smokeote them and pursue them to Hoba, which is on the left hand of Damascus. I think the last time we shared with you the distance that was over 200 miles in that rugged terrain, one way that Abraham traveled to go and fight for his uh nephew Lot. And remember in verse 17, "And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of these kings. And Melzdc the king of Salem brought forth bread and wine, and he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him and said, "Blessed be Abraham of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth." And he blessed and blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thy enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all. This is Abram giving this king of Melzdc 10% of all of the spoils. Now remember, Abraham and these three other gentlemen that were confederate with him actually defeated these four kings. And Abraham was not a warrior or a soldier. He was a farmer. But he you know this is the question. When when is it time for you to fight? You fight when people take your stuff. When people mess with things that belong to you, that's when it's appropriate for you to go fight. If you got to start it, if you got to pick it, if you got to do whatever you got to do, if it belongs to you, then that's what's worth fighting for. And this young man, Lot, his family, the people, and the Bible says goods, I'm going to give you brother Israel Po's version of what goods are. I call it stuff. You have it in your garage. You have it in your closets. I looked up the definition of home one time and it says a place where you put your stuff. That's home. You think your garage should have been made for a car, but many of our garages don't have cars in them, but we have stuff in them. And this is what the scriptures are very clear. when Abraham goes and delivers Lot, he delivers the king, he delivers the people and all of their stuff. And so here now, first time this king is being mentioned. You know, the Bible mentions five other kings with Sodom and and Gomorra and the other little and then mentions the four other kings that come and took them. And then all of a sudden, he mentions this king that we ain't hear about him no nowhere else. king of of of Salem, Melzdc, where'd he come from? And when Melzdc shows up, Abram takes all of the goods that they recovered from this great victory, this great battle, and pays tithe from what he received. &gt;&gt; And look at the king after him. I hope I can get into something here just for a moment and then I'll close. Verse 20. He blessed him most high God and he gave him tithes of all. Verse 21. And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, "Give me the persons and take the goods to thyself." It's a odd uh I mean he's not in a position to make no deal with nobody. we just delivered you. And here he's he he's watching Abra here. Abraham takes 10% of everything of all the goods and gives it to mec the priest of the most high God. And the the the priest of of of Salem offers him bread and wine. And then now the king of Sodom says, "Abram, you can have all this stuff. The rest of the stuff is yours. But I want these people. I want the persons. If you know what Sodom and Gomorrah was and what they turned out to be, you see what kind of persons these were. You keep reading the scriptures and you slow it down and you'll see what their future ended up becoming. They had an opportunity to come and be a part of what the most high God was offering Abram. Here he's getting a blessing from the most high God. And this man, this king is trying to offer him something carnal here. Look at the scripture here. And Abraham said to the king of Sodom, "I lift up my hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, that I will not take from uh from a thread even to a shoe latch, and that I will not take anything that is thine, lest thou should say, I have made Abram rich." save only that which the young men of Eden and the portion of the men which went with me anorc and Mamra let them take their portion so here it's the time to get paid it's time for you know the reason why we were fighting and here Abraham has the opportunity to become more wealthy he has the opportunity to receive all of these gifts from all of the victories of these kings and uh they offer it to him. But Abraham said, "I swore before God that I wouldn't take nothing from you all." Abra, what are you fighting for? Why do we travel all these miles for? How valuable is Lot to you? I mean, financially, you put yourself on the line. You put your life on the line. You've traveled. You had to scheme at nighttime. You worked yourself through whatever you had to work through. And this wasn't a a practice round. This was a battle. And what is beating in Abraham's heart, he absolutely has the ministry and the mission and the the trained soldiers in his house behind him 100% to go get Lot. Amen. &gt;&gt; If Abraham doesn't get Lot, who's going to get him? Huh? And who is Lot? And who is Abraham? Brother Bham brings the type so many times that that's what God did for us. He left glory to come and seek and save the lost. He left glory to find you and I. And he went further than just 200 miles on foot. came from glory. For many of you, he came right in your neighborhood. He put a believer right on my job. Gave me a job that I had believers surrounded around me. And my highlight for my life isn't that job, but it was the believers that I met on that job. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So here what the prophet of God says here in Hebrews chapter 7 number one he says but still he was a fallen brother and Abraham done all that he could do to bring to bring him back again and the spirit was in Abram is the spirit of Christ that's in the church today. No matter what the brother has done, you'll do all you can to bring him back into the fellowship of Christ again. No matter what he's done, you'll try hard. You say, "Well, if the I ain't seen brother so and so. I ain't seen that brother. We baptized. I ain't seen that sister. We ain't seen them in a long time. You know, if they're they know where we're at. Uh they know where the church is. They know how to call me if they need something." That was that's not what Abraham they they they can't call you when they're bound. &gt;&gt; They can't come see you when the spirit has them bound. &gt;&gt; But you got the power of Christ to go see them. &gt;&gt; Arm your trained soldiers, servants. Do everything you can. If you got to be confederate with these two or three other guys just to go win this battle to go get locked, it's worth it. &gt;&gt; This is the attitude. And and we've been guilty not purposely but out of Leo Deia's busyiness. It's like it's like you know you can keep you know one of the famous brothers that witness all the time just a highlight like a hero to me was brother Tommy Flanigan. How many knew him? This man was a witnessing machine. That's what his life. He kept a message book right here. He kept a pamphlet over here. Had a couple tapes in his pocket right here. How many knew Brother Flanigan? &gt;&gt; Oh my. How many didn't know him? Oh my goodness. This brother was set at the truck stop and I asked him one time. He says, "Brother Flanigan, how do you?" He says, "I kind of sit down." You know, he kind of has an odd way about him, but not like he's going to hurt you, but like and he would just come and sit up at somebody's table at the truck stop while they're resting or eating. And here this no-haired man comes slipping up. Hey, can you can I sit and talk to you about spiritual things? That's what he would say. Can I talk to you about spiritual things? And he have a book loaded dynamite in his pocket. His truck drivers didn't know what's about to hit him. He looks innocent. He looks like a nobody. But I believe who did brother Philan witness to bring in? I think he brought in &gt;&gt; Okay, maybe. But he brought in um I thought it was brother Maranda. Somebody checked me on that. But anyways, he told me he said he could tell real quick if if they're really resistant right away. He knew he stepped back. But you can tell when people receiving and some people were just curious. He's like, "Sure, sit down." And he'll start opening up and he'll keep going and keep going until they said stop. And then he'll back up. And he dropped so many tapes and CDs in these truckers lap and they would get in that truck and then the bomb would go off. He had a plan. He had a strategy. He witnessed to more people than probably most of the pastors that I would know. He was a witnessing machine. He had a style. He had he was he developed it. He made copies. He made copies of the message so he can give it to somebody. That's the spirit of Christ, I believe. And that's the spirit that we want on us. Abraham C. In 1959, Brother Banner says this, paragraph 116. Then we find out that trouble set in down in Sodom. Kings come through and took Lot, run away with him and his wives, and Abraham heard it. Now Abraham played the part of a Christian again. Oh, Christ going after the fallen brother to bring him back. Christ went after the fallen brother to bring him back. 1956 the lamb was alive. Brother Random says this here. What good would the million dollars do or all the feeding of the poor and the things that we done? See, it wouldn't amount to very much if I had a billion this morning. What good would it do us after we're gone? But let me tell you something. We haven't got that money. You're a poor man. All of us are. That's right. We live by the arms of the people being ministers. But brethren, in Africa, one little black boy about this high or prostitute off the street yonder in Lewisville, one soul saved in eternity. When that star is shining yonder, our name will be wrapped into it. &gt;&gt; There's your value. It isn't how much you got, how much you desire. It's how much you can do towards saving souls for Christ Jesus. Our money will fade. He says, we can say, "Praise the Lord." Ah, so brother Bannam is talking about Hudson Taylor and presuming and he makes this statement here, paragraph 124. I tell you again, instead of preaching, taking so many our students over here and getting them crammed so full of theology and things like that, I think it'd be better to take them in an upper room like they used to have a long time ago for an experience. Hudson Taylor said one time, the great missionary to India, a young Indian boy got converted. He was filled with the Holy Spirit. He said his face was shining like a light. He come in, he said, "Mr. Taylor, now I believe I'll go to school and take my four years that I missed in college. He says, "Then I think I'll then I think I'll go into study and get my bachelor of art. Within a few years, I'll be able to go out and preach the gospel." Mr. Taylor, the renowned Christian that he was, he said, "Son, go with what you got." Now, that's it. said, "Start giving light when the candle is lit, not when it's half gone." That's right. Tell you what you know, you you ain't got no experience, you can't tell nothing. Tell what you know. You ain't got no experience, you can't tell nothing. Amen. So, you know, I think that's the attitude. Sometimes we think, am I more am I well equipped to be a witness? Well, you tell your testimony. You tell how the candle got lit for you. You be a witness of you. What the word did for you. You be a witness. Young person, old person, whoever it is, you go tell how the candle got lit sometimes. And we should study the word to make oursel approve. We should be studying all the time anyways. Um, and to be a witness, you simply tell how the candle got lit. You give your experience. what you know, what God did for you, what you know is true. If it goes too deep, it goes a little further, then you can refer them to a minister, invite them to the church, or refer them to someone that has um more of those skills of of explaining and and and and those things like that. But you know, we are all supposed to be witnesses and we're all supposed to be ready, willing, and and on the ready to preach the gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, this is the focus that Brother Bam told us that we need to put souls first. Winning souls that should be first. God keeps his word 1957. I pray tonight as I've laid back these pages of this sacred book called the Bible. I'm only able to physically to open it up, but only the Holy Spirit can interpret it to us. So we pray that he will come tonight and interpret the word and the meanings that would create faith for the salvation of souls first for the healing of bodies next and for the bringing of joy to the saints and establishing them that they might continue on. Grant these blessings, Father, the forgiveness of our sins. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. The message speaks to this mountain. The prophet of God says this. Now, we're trying to place the revival just in the best setting that we can. We do not what we call major on divine healing because divine healing is a minor and you cannot major on a minor. We know that. So, the great thing that we're after for any revival is to bring lost souls to Christ first. Revive the church back into a spiritual condition to where it should be. Close communion with God. Bring fellowship among the churches. Third and fourth, pray for the sick. That's our aim. Our try is sinners first. Fellowship with the churches and close walk with the with with the church of God and then pray for the sick. 1962, brother Brandham says that's our first intention is to win souls. Secondly, the upbuilding of God's people, the church. Thirdly, pray for the sick and to do something that lays in our power to help make life a little better for you and the journey a little the burdens of a a little lighter. In the message influence 1963, the prophet of God says this. First thing let me say first there will be souls saved and believers filled with the Holy Spirit the sick people healed. God receive glory in his church grow for the kingdom of God. So that's what our desire is right &gt;&gt; souls first and we do that by winning them. Look at this message divine love 1956. The prophet of God says this in paragraph 58. We know this is the age that lacks love. It has grown cold even amongst the church, even amongst believers. You know, in some counties, in certain regions of the US, you have that h southern hospitality, that warmness that people there have this warmness way about. You see that in the south been I know in Colombia there's a different atmosphere amongst the people than let's say the people in Mexico both very nice and then in Africa and West Africa Tanzania those people are quite different than the Liberians which is on that's west Africa this is east Africa they're just different and they're believers and every region and the and the places you live you go to different places they have a different atmosphere some people are moving fast and others moving slow kind of easy, you know, and in the city of Tucson where we live. I mean, you all live here. It's it's not I mean, it's very hot um outside and warm most of the time, but a lot of the people are not very warm here. Very standoffish, very curious, very cactuslike. And um when when you come here, you start to develop that. You used to I mean I used to say hi to people. You make eye contact. You at least say hi. And I we do that. We do that in other places. I come here and after a while people don't do it then so I don't do it. &gt;&gt; You develop this little coldness. You're not mean, you're not bad, but that's just the atmosphere of our city. And um but there's an atmosphere of this message though, &gt;&gt; huh? &gt;&gt; And there's an atmosphere of the Bible. And which atmosphere am I supposed to be reflecting? &gt;&gt; I mean, like, if I really care and you come up missing, wouldn't I make a phone call to see how you're doing? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't even enter into my prayer, into my thought. But here it's so standoffish. I'm talking about me. I'm talking about us now. It's so cold. It's so standoffish that the people will be gone and just wherever you and nobody makes a phone call to see how they're doing. Very independent. Very give me my space. Call me before you come. Nobody say amen. very that's the atmosphere. I'm not indicting it. I do want you to call me before you come. Me personally, but but if you don't call, hey, I'm happy to see you. &gt;&gt; Some of you know that you can come without calling, right? Hope so. Anyways, that atmosphere and that, you know, that's that's that's the region where we live. It's kind of that, you know, that the men here is that four-wheel drive atmosphere. I will run you over if I have to. I mean, but oneonone in the boat fishing at the lake and you see them, they chop it up. Be nice. You're just a regular guys. But in traffic, in the street, we got to have this macho. This don't say nothing to me. No, it ain't nothing funny. what you looking at that atmosphere. But what I'm saying is the message has an atmosphere and the Bible has an atmosphere and the Christians have Abraham's atmosphere. What did Abraham do? Abraham heard that Lot was taken by men that were greater than him. And what did he do? He armed his trained servants in his house and then he went the extra mile to get confederates to work with him and he's doing all this and he makes a covenant before God we didn't know about until the end when they try to offer him the money says I've lifted up my hand towards God towards heaven that I wouldn't take none of this stuff &gt;&gt; Abraham was already blessed &gt;&gt; and here he says now in Genesis 15:1 he's worried about this master to his house. Who is this master to his house? Who was he? He's Eleazar. Is that right? Now, Eleazar was a type of our last day messenger. And in Genesis chapter 24 is where we see him again. He is Abraham's eldest servant. Remember Genesis 15. We can presume or we can say and we should believe that uh his servant uh Eleazar was probably a part of the group that went to deliver Lot or he stayed back to take care of things. We do know he was in Abraham's house. We do know that he was under that ministry. And we do know that the type of Abraham was God. But here is these trained servants that are going out to deliver Lot. But now the ministry moves from Abraham sending Eleer to go get a bride. So it's beautiful. I don't have time to get into it, but let's look at it. Here's two arms of people that need to hear the word, and they all come from Abraham's house. Abraham dealing with Lot, his nephew, and then Abraham sending a messenger for his son. So here's the ministry of the bride coming into play and the ministry of the sodomite being saved, the Lites. And Abraham is a part of all of it. Abraham was instrumental of bringing Lot salvation. And just because um they're not going to marry Isaac, just because it's not a part of the message or part of the bride, doesn't mean we don't take people as far as we can take them through salvation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Why have we lost? We have the eleer part down. We we preach the message. That's where we stand. You lead somebody to Christ, you got to take them somewhere in the word. And God took us in the word to this message. So that's what we do. But we bring them to Christ. said, "How far can we take Lot?" Lot never left Sodom. In fact, they backslid. It got worse and worse, and God had to rain fire down upon all of them and destroy them. But he delivered just Lot. And even still, even after all of the, you know, the the lives on the line, the the outreach and the campaign to go get him, he stays down in Sodom. It gets worse and God's going to destroy it. Then Abraham goes to interceding for him. Still, &gt;&gt; sir, that's a Christian. Now, that's a type of a true Christian. That's a church believer that has the mission. Go and preach the gospel to every creature. How far did Elzer travel? 400 plus miles. one way from where he was to get Rebecca. So, I don't have time to get into that, but I do want to read this quote about winning souls. All right. Here, brother Brandham says this here, paragraph 58. What is it? Divine love, sympathy had been projected by the Holy Spirit into this man. And by that, at the end of the road where he couldn't, nothing could be done. Love had taken its place. and love had met love. Then sovereign grace went to work and God through sovereign grace restored the sight to the man. See, first you have to enter into that thought. That's the way you have to do to a sinner. Many people pray for sinners. That's all right. But that's not the way to win a sinner. It's your business to win the sinner. You don't win him by praying for him. You win him. Win him by talking to him and introducing to him Christ. That's your business. That's your duty is to win sinners by talking to them and projecting to them the love of God through the word of God. That wins the sinner. Someone say, "I wouldn't go to church. I sure like that woman. I like that fellow. See, because you are winning them. If you stayed home and just prayed for the sinner and never went to contact him, there is very little can be done. But you've got to pray and then go. That's right. Go and do it. Now, the projecting of this love. So, it's our duty to win the sinner. How do we do it? We pray. Then we go and that's one of the main things we do is we win the center. We've done the praying from the distance long enough. &gt;&gt; But we need to go pray and then go. We have cards for our church. Got a little card that we made for the churches out there. You grab those. Taking a flight on the bus, whatever you're doing, you keep that. The door opens. It's not It's not mechanical. It's praying for them. First, there has to be a love and burden for the lost. Keeping in mind the great commission. I am called to preach the gospel to every creature. I am called to preach the gospel to I am called to go and tell somebody else. That's my calling. And God has little tools, little ways that he can develop that for you. I encourage you to go tell somebody. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. So, we don't just pray for them. We pray and then we go. That's what Abraham did. Hey, we heard Lot was taken. Yeah, let's pray for that man. Oh my. I sure hope they're easy on him, man. No, no, no. He grabbed he grabbed his, you know. Come on, guys. You got to go do this. Hey, what's the goal here? We're going to go get Lot. And what's in it for us? Yeah, that's it. We're going to go get Lot. And when the spoils came out and all the spoils and everybody's getting their peace and before Abraham even separates and give the men who helped him, he gives God first. He takes a tenth from all of this stuff here that we got because I already lifted up my hand and he already blessed me. But all this I'm going to give it to He gives it to Melzdc and the Lord blesses him and serves him bread and wine showing a type that that is us the the the Christian today that in the new home in the millennium he we will eat bread and wine with him again. And right now we are winning lot. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we're doing. It's right here in this city right here. Brothers, I want to go in the mission field. We're living in the missionary field right here, right now. Let me read one more. All right. I just on my mind. I think it's in my phone. But talking about this struggle just a little bit. I just came across this quote. And here, Brother Brandham was struggling with the gift of God in his life. He had the angel of the Lord in his life and um he was really dealing with him. It's in the angel and the commission 1950 and I thought about you know some of the difficulties that that we have to wrestle with. We just had to wrestle through it and get through it ourselves. And I took my Bible, little old school Bible about like that, and I put it under my arms and I took off and I went and read until nighttime. I got a cave I go into and it'll be way back in the hills. But this is a little old log cabin where I used to trap. And I prayed and I prayed. And I was sitting there praying, holding my mind with the power that reaches the spheres on in beyond the moon and stars and the fogs and gets a hold of God way in yonder somewhere sitting there meditating, thinking on God. I was getting along towards 3:00 in the morning. I said, "God, I'll stay right here until I die. Until something, I'm a minister and don't let me be deceiving. If you want something from me to do, if there's something you wish to speak to me, you showed me signs and wonders and people have told me to forget about it and I was eat too much supper or something like that." I said, "But I want you to tell me, Father, if it's wrong, come down now and stop it from me. Shut it off." So, I'll never know no more about it. I said, "Have mercy, God." I cried till my eyes was swollen. I said, "God, I'm sincere. I don't know what to do. I don't want to fail you. I've done all that I know how to do, but what is it you want me to do?" And in there in prayer, all at once, I seen a light flickering and look around. I thought, "Well, here somebody's coming with the flashlight. Couldn't be a car coming back in here." Now, where was that at? So, you can go and here that's when the angel appeared to him. But just leading up to that, you think this great momentous event needed to happen in his life. But look at the sweat. Look at the crying till his eyes were shut. He holding his Bible 3:00 in the morning. Oh, God. What is this? And he's really pressing into it. And anything of value like that, you know, lot what Abraham did was of tremendous value. You have to press into it. The kingdom of God suffering violence and the violent take it by force. And that's the part that sometimes I think that's what we need the Lord to help us with the struggle to to to press into the kingdom. And that's what I'm asking the Lord to help me Amen. To help us. All right. So, God bless you. We have some prayer requests. I'm sorry I left him back there again, Joe. For And I know we want to pray for this man that was shot, this um Charlie. Yeah. And there's others that get shot. I don't like to I'm not into political stuff and I don't follow the waves of people that get in and announcing the stuff current events of the day. I don't do that. I keep the pullpit free from that. And um there's many people get shot and killed and we want to pray for every single one of them. And um because this is what happens. You get these little political waves that come through and they're on the radio and what people consume and if we're not careful, we bring that into our church and our sermons and so forth. And I don't I don't like I don't do that. I try to stay right with the word here. There's a lot of craziness going out there. What it's going to get crazier. So, uh we'll pray for that Charlie Kirk family and Someone put that request in. Brother Bobby WZ, want to pray for him. Um, Ruth Dexter, wife and Matt Matt Dexter Jr. is getting chemo and radiation treatment for breast cancer. They live in Indiana. Um, for the meetings coming and the prayer breakfast is this coming up Saturday. And if you haven't uh RSVP, it'd be good for you to do that. So, we're looking forward to the Lord blessing in that.
