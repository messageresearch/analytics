[9:44] 176 and then just before
[9:47] 183 it'll be about 20
[9:50] minutes and
[9:52] uh so thank the Lord for that amen let's
[9:56] all sing only believe
[10:00] only
[10:03] be only
[10:08] be all things are
[10:13] possible
[10:15] only
[10:18] believe
[10:19] only
[10:23] believe
[10:24] only
[10:27] be all all things are
[10:32] possible
[10:34] only
[10:36] be you may be seated brother
[10:41] Brandon what is
[10:44] the the
[10:47] name of the it'll be on the people of
[10:50] Revelations
[10:51] 3:12 I don't know he said give him a new
[10:55] name I I I don't know what that is see
[10:58] It'll be probably made no when we get
[10:59] there but I I don't know what it is now
[11:02] see see he is going to do that he give
[11:06] them a new name and if they just know
[11:08] themselves see now brother Brandon is
[11:11] there any
[11:13] Scripture uh permitting marriage after
[11:17] divorce this is very important it says
[11:20] important well uh that's the reason it
[11:23] wasn't pertaining to this um as far as I
[11:26] can see my brother or sister whoever it
[11:29] may be there isn't unless your
[11:31] companion's dead because the Bible said
[11:33] we're bound to them as long as they live
[11:36] so as as far as being any Scripture
[11:39] that's what was asked here is there
[11:41] scripture see is there any Scripture not
[11:43] as I can find see not as I can find
[11:46] because Paul said that the the married
[11:48] couple if the companion's dead then they
[11:51] freedom to marry whomsoever they will in
[11:52] the law but until then but watch you
[11:55] take it until death we far right that's
[11:59] it you done talk oath over that you see
[12:02] so I don't think there is now if it's if
[12:04] you found some and it's correctly well
[12:07] all all right but as far as myself I I
[12:09] don't find any what does see thou hurt
[12:15] not the oil and the wine mean in
[12:18] Revelations 66 it's the Holy
[12:21] Spirit we just got through that probably
[12:23] somebody know come in a little late for
[12:25] the message the for the other tap you
[12:28] see well hurt not the or and the wine
[12:31] what does the oral and wine mean the
[12:33] oral as we took it in symbol means the
[12:36] Holy Spirit see wine is um and oil is
[12:41] connected together in the Bible in
[12:43] worship see and the wine is we but
[12:46] that's where I got the idea of the
[12:47] stimulation wine stimulates and wine uh
[12:52] in its uh it's anti-type of its natural
[12:56] from stimulation is revelation I just
[12:59] think what stimulates the
[13:02] church Revelation okay so wine the new
[13:06] wine would be now watch the oil and wine
[13:09] went together in sacrifice went together
[13:12] in in the church worship now notice
[13:15] symbl together connected together you
[13:17] got a Concord you look you see a whole
[13:19] string where wine and oil is met
[13:22] together in worship if you got a A
[13:24] Prudence why it says up there now notice
[13:27] on this but now you see
[13:29] the oil is always the Holy Spirit we
[13:34] find that over in Ezekiel and we find it
[13:36] in the Old Testament we find it all
[13:38] through the New Testament why do we
[13:56] anoint why do we anoint the sick with or
[14:00] we anoint the sick with or because it
[14:02] symbolizes the pouring out of the Holy
[14:05] Spirit upon them see also the wise
[14:08] virgin had or the unwise had no or
[14:12] Spirit see now that is the oral and then
[14:16] the wine if if if the oral represents
[14:21] represents God God is Spirit see God is
[14:27] word in the beginning was word word was
[14:31] with God word was made flesh and that
[14:35] was God now then if the word now in set
[14:40] here in a a natural form now the wine is
[14:46] the water like that the Revelation that
[14:50] reveals that uh interpretation of the
[14:53] word which stimulates the believer you
[14:56] see M they just never seen it before
[14:59] before my glory that's once
[15:03] stimulation of
[15:06] Revelation I didn't know that till the
[15:08] they sitting there either see now that's
[15:10] what the the oil and wine that was see
[15:13] not as the black horse rider and that
[15:16] was during the time of the Dark Age the
[15:19] third age of the of the church notice
[15:23] and in there there's just a little bit
[15:25] of it left just a little bit but don't
[15:28] hurt
[15:29] and I believe if you get that uh the uh
[15:33] third uh seal on tape you You' find it
[15:37] there where we explain it in detail in
[15:39] detail rather brother brandom is the
[15:41] Lamb's Book of Life and the Book of Life
[15:44] the same book sure well that's where all
[15:47] redemptions wrote in this book see their
[15:49] names are in you say well our names put
[15:52] on the Lamb's Book of Life brother
[15:53] brandom I I got it put on the other
[15:55] night no you
[15:56] didn't no you didn't you just found out
[15:59] it was on
[16:01] there because their names were written
[16:04] before the foundation of the world see
[16:07] uh that's it's all the same book see now
[16:10] brother Brandon is it true that that
[16:14] every Jew born since Christ came will be
[16:18] saved and who are the 144,000 are they
[16:24] the uh predestinated ones to be sealed
[16:28] with the Holy Ghost and what is their
[16:32] mission there's about three questions in
[16:34] one there but here first one is um is it
[16:39] true that ever a Jew born since Christ
[16:44] came into the world is to be saved no
[16:47] nothing will be saved only those whose
[16:49] names were put on the Lamb's Book of
[16:51] Life before the foundation of the world
[16:52] you are Gentile that's all the book
[16:55] holds that mystery and the book is only
[16:58] unfolding it now not each one's name but
[17:01] what the mystery of the book is while
[17:03] it's calling those names you you
[17:06] understand that now see the book doesn't
[17:08] say now um leil is to be saved in time
[17:14] of this church age or or arm and nville
[17:17] or or whoever no I don't to say that it
[17:20] just shows the mystery unfolds mystery
[17:22] what the thing is but we ourselves by
[17:26] faith believe it that's what I said to
[17:28] the someone said well there's nobody me
[17:30] trying it brother Bram said there's only
[17:32] be one saved out of
[17:33] Jeffersonville now see it's showing a
[17:35] parable that that that isn't that that
[17:38] isn't it there might be thousands save I
[17:41] don't know I hope every one of them
[17:42] saved see but I don't know but here's
[17:45] the way I want to believe it I'm that
[17:48] one you believe the same for you if you
[17:50] don't then there's something wrong with
[17:52] your faith you're not sure what you're
[17:54] doing how can you how can you walk up
[17:57] there in the face of death when you're
[18:00] not too sure whether you're saved or
[18:02] not how can you go down here and say to
[18:05] this crippled man laying here blinded
[18:06] and twisted up thus sayith the Lord rise
[18:10] up Jesus Christ makes you whole how can
[18:13] you stand that little cold stiff body
[18:15] laying there that's dead and been dead
[18:17] for hours and hours and laying there
[18:19] cold and stiff and say thus sayth the
[18:21] Lord rise up to your feet you better you
[18:25] have to know what you're talking about
[18:28] well say death claims everything it's
[18:29] all gone yeah but when the word of God
[18:32] is revealed and you know it's God that
[18:34] changes
[18:36] things now yes these Jews uh not not all
[18:40] the Jews will be saved no sir they will
[18:43] not be saved only those who when he's
[18:45] speaking of of Jew Jew just as a name
[18:50] that was given to him after they left uh
[18:53] I believe Nebuchadnezzar over began to
[18:55] call him Jew first because the tribe of
[18:57] Judah was taken there and is given the
[18:58] name of
[18:59] Jew now because it come down from Judea
[19:04] and they got the name of Jew but now
[19:06] Israel is different Israel and Jew is
[19:10] all together different every Jew every
[19:12] Jew isn't an
[19:14] Israelite no he's just a Jew but then
[19:17] Israel Paul never said all Jews will be
[19:20] saved he said all Israel will be saved
[19:22] why Israel's name that's that's the name
[19:25] of Redemption all the way
[19:27] back and all Israel will be saved but
[19:30] not all Juda Judaism will be saved see
[19:34] just like Gentiles there'll be a there's
[19:37] thousands times thousands of of people
[19:39] yes literally millions in these
[19:41] organizations and they call Christian
[19:44] Church of Christ and all such names as
[19:46] that that don't mean one thing that's
[19:49] not that don't mean to be
[19:51] saved people say now You' got to belong
[19:53] to this or that an organization certain
[19:55] organization if your name isn't on our
[19:58] book you're lost now that's
[20:00] C that's C see there's only one way you
[20:04] can be saved and that is not him that
[20:07] willth or him that run him that that is
[20:10] God who shows mercy and God by his for
[20:13] knowledge predestinated a church to
[20:15] Glory that's the one to save right your
[20:19] faith is so anchored there you say well
[20:22] my faith is Anchor there look back what
[20:23] kind of life you're living you see
[20:24] you're not even fit for there your
[20:26] anchor is wrong got on Sand instead of
[20:29] Ro the first Little Wave will throw it
[20:31] off let the word be revealed and my
[20:33] church don't teach that that shows right
[20:35] there you wasn't anchored on no rock
[20:38] using sand that's right so now you see
[20:42] now and the
[20:45] 144,000 uh are they the predestinated
[20:48] ones yes sir that's Israel spiritual
[20:51] Israel this think there will be millions
[20:54] of them in
[20:55] there I don't know how many is in there
[20:58] now I guess
[20:59] a whole group but they will not all be
[21:02] saved because they are in
[21:05] Judea you have any idea how many is
[21:07] there
[21:08] now I don't know but they're probably
[21:10] after this next persecution begin rise
[21:12] are accumulating by you know I've got a
[21:14] tape on them taking West with me now to
[21:17] to one of the the uh the Covenant Church
[21:19] which is it's just the old um oh I
[21:23] forget now it started the they have them
[21:26] down there in Africa Dutchy Farm uh a
[21:28] dut Reformed Church the Covenant is now
[21:30] if there's any of sitting here I'll tell
[21:31] you why you're still holding on to that
[21:33] old heidleberg catechism and that's
[21:36] exactly the reason you're still in the
[21:37] still Duty form so you might polish up
[21:40] by American name that's that's the thing
[21:41] behind it because you're teaching in
[21:42] that same catechism the old hle bir you
[21:45] ask your pastor if that isn't right see
[21:47] so um now notice this
[21:51] 144,000 they are predestinated ones to
[21:54] be sealed by the Holy Ghost yes sir
[21:57] that's exactly right right all right
[21:59] though if there's any now if I'm if I
[22:01] didn't answer suit you well uh uh maybe
[22:04] I'm I could be wrong see but this is the
[22:06] best of my knowledge you see this is the
[22:08] best of my knowledge brother
[22:10] benam uh as you have travailed or tra on
[22:16] the serpent seed oh I never noticed this
[22:20] and this is slipped up on me serent seed
[22:23] this week will it be in order to ask
[22:27] this question
[22:29] my friends have asked me to explain
[22:32] Genesis 4:1 and I can't will you help
[22:36] me it's it's all of the subject but
[22:40] anyhow I I I'll try my best by the help
[22:42] of god let's see now let me polish up a
[22:45] little bit I think that's where she said
[22:46] I got a son from The Lord I believe it
[22:49] is I think you said that uh I'm going
[22:51] check be sure CU I said to night seven
[22:54] instead of 700 instead of 7,000 so it
[22:57] makes me so nervous see and you just
[23:00] have to be watching an enemy on every
[23:02] side you're conscious of that you see
[23:05] yes that's it and uh Adam knew Eve his
[23:09] wife and she conceived in be ke and said
[23:12] I have begotten a man from the Lord now
[23:18] I'm just going to answer you a question
[23:21] my brother or sister and I remember not
[23:24] not throwing to you no I'm trying to
[23:26] help you see I love you and I love the
[23:29] person who might have been a critical on
[23:30] it but I don't think this person is
[23:31] critical they said help me see because
[23:33] the people believes it but they're just
[23:35] not sufficient to uh posted by the
[23:39] spirit to know what to say to the person
[23:40] that's asking that now she's saying here
[23:44] what the question is no doubt that
[23:46] they're saying e said she gotten this
[23:49] man from the
[23:51] Lord how do you think life could ever
[23:54] come if it didn't come from the Lord be
[23:55] it right or wrong that's right who sent
[23:59] who sent Judas is cared into the
[24:03] world tell me that the Bible said he was
[24:06] born the son of
[24:08] predition just ask him
[24:10] that be like a worm in a lemon see see
[24:14] now you see they can't can't it is
[24:17] notice then if you want to take them a
[24:20] little more Technic look Eve talks here
[24:23] if you want to take it the language it's
[24:25] here which is written so it's hid from
[24:27] the ey wise of prudent Eve here the way
[24:30] it's taught that God was the one that
[24:33] she begotten this son by and he's a
[24:35] spirit and can't do
[24:38] it see I watch here if you want to know
[24:41] that I have gotten a a man from the
[24:47] Lord you could take make it sound but
[24:49] it's got to have his right
[24:51] interpretation yes sir no sir if that
[24:55] then the spirit and we always follow the
[24:58] nature of our parent you know that look
[25:02] at the baby the nature well then Adam
[25:07] was a Son of God Eve was a daughter of
[25:10] God right the first thing of the
[25:13] creation of God his SE all the way down
[25:16] and that he become who does the world
[25:18] belong to the devil
[25:44] if you want to and bring it right down
[25:45] through the geneologies and you find out
[25:47] that they were smart man
[26:01] now watch not from the first seed of the
[26:03] natural they died I got your minds open
[26:08] the first seed of the natural seed just
[26:11] ordinary
[26:15] good in order to preserve that Lon
[26:18] coming down that one died so another
[26:20] could raise
[26:22] up let be rebirthed
[26:26] again you catch it all just so you get
[26:29] it see there you are the perfect
[26:57] time e
[27:36] don't worry they haven't got one foot to
[27:39] stand on they they don't believe that be
[27:42] King's son but we have got a tape on
[27:44] that if you'd like here explain
[27:48] in the meek shall inherit the
[27:52] earth so that don't worry they haven't
[27:55] got one foot to stand on
[27:58] see they don't believe that be kain's
[28:00] son but we have got a tape on that if
[28:02] you'd like here explained in detail
[28:05] see no sir I seen I got a piece of paper
[28:08] up there where a science says now go to
[28:10] prove that Eve never eat an apple she
[28:13] had an
[28:14] apple I got the paper up at home now see
[28:18] there's a apple cot how how far can
[28:20] people that's a carnal mind then
[28:23] actually Moses never crossed the water
[28:27] he crossed to a sea of
[28:31] reeds brought Israel across at the upper
[28:33] end of the Dead Sea is a bunch of reads
[28:36] their whole sea of reads and just where
[28:37] the waters had been one time went down
[28:39] and Moses took a shortcut went around
[28:41] that
[28:42] way and the Orthodox Churches accepted
[28:47] it you see that the Orthodox Churches
[28:50] accepted it that was sold oh man can't
[28:53] you see that seed of the serpent that
[28:55] Antichrist the whole thing laying right
[28:57] there
[28:59] yes sir brother Brandon please pray for
[29:01] my little well that's a prayer request I
[29:03] say pray for my little grandson very ill
[29:06] with the flu he is in the Riverview
[29:09] hotel Lord
[29:12] Jesus this uh poor person here never
[29:16] wrote that just in vain she's seen you
[29:19] just uh deliberately remove even
[29:24] rheumatic fever from a little boy other
[29:26] night she knows that you're the great
[29:29] God and we offer our prayers for that
[29:31] little boy in the name of Jesus Christ
[29:33] may he be healed
[29:38] amen when somebody writes anything it's
[29:40] not in vain that they they got up no
[29:42] matter how simple it sounds to us and
[29:43] how much out there but but there's
[29:45] something behind it you see that lady
[29:48] that little boy something is the Elijah
[29:51] who comes to preach to the Jews the real
[29:55] man who lived on the Earth
[29:59] or will he be the spirit of Elijah in
[30:03] some other
[30:06] man now that's I'm afraid to say I don't
[30:10] know let me read that again is the
[30:12] Elijah who comes to preach to the Jews
[30:16] or there the real man who live on earth
[30:20] or will he be Spirit of Elijah in some
[30:24] other man now if I could answer that
[30:27] correctly I could tell you about Enoch
[30:29] see but I I can't do it see only thing I
[30:32] know is just the scripture says what it
[30:34] will be and uh now it might be that the
[30:39] um now I I'm kindly inclined now let me
[30:43] say it this way and I hope the tape the
[30:46] brother on the tapes will understand
[30:47] this I'm inclined to believe that it
[30:51] will be anointed man of their spirit
[30:54] because see he says does not on Elisha
[30:57] does not the spirit of Elijah rest on
[31:01] Elijah the spirit of Elijah and he done
[31:04] just like Elijah did see so I but I
[31:07] can't say that's true I I don't know see
[31:10] I'm honest with you I don't know brother
[31:12] Brenham would you please answer this one
[31:16] for me about
[31:18] baptism Matthew

[1:03:24] Bibles to Sint John the 10th chapter and
[1:03:28] amen so good to be back in the house of
[1:03:30] the Lord this morning and and I was
[1:03:32] listening in on brother Israel preaching
[1:03:34] this morning and and uh it looked like
[1:03:37] they were having a good time down there
[1:03:39] and I just pray that he's a help to the
[1:03:42] folks and that's gathered together there
[1:03:44] and look like a nice crowd good turnout
[1:03:46] look like they had a nice service last
[1:03:49] evening and and so I'm just trusting
[1:03:52] that God is with them there and uh and
[1:03:55] and the good thing about the Lord is he
[1:03:57] can be there and he can be here too and
[1:03:59] so we're grateful that he's omnipresent
[1:04:02] he's omn Mission and uh he's here to
[1:04:05] provide all of our needs St John the
[1:04:08] 10th chapter and the
[1:04:10] 27th
[1:04:12] verse uh and then we'll read over in
[1:04:14] Romans the 8th chapter if I could get
[1:04:16] some uh volume on the speaker here
[1:04:18] please St John the 10th chapter my sheep
[1:04:22] hear my voice now now that's you son sa
[1:04:26] my sheep hear my voice I know them and
[1:04:30] they follow me and I give unto them
[1:04:34] eternal life and they shall never perish
[1:04:37] that sounds like a promise to me
[1:04:39] Saints uh and neither shall any man
[1:04:43] pluck them out of my hand my Father
[1:04:46] which gave them me is greater than all
[1:04:51] and no man is able to pluck them out of
[1:04:53] my father's hand and I and my father are
[1:04:57] one and over in Romans the eth chapter
[1:05:00] we'll
[1:05:08] read Romans 8 the 30 uh fifth
[1:05:13] verse we'll read a few verses here it's
[1:05:17] one of my favorite portions of scripture
[1:05:19] Romans 835 who shall separate us from
[1:05:22] the love of Christ shall tribulation or
[1:05:25] distress or persecution or famine or
[1:05:28] nakedness or Peril or sword as it is
[1:05:32] written for thy sake we are killed all
[1:05:34] the day long we are counted as sheep for
[1:05:37] the slaughter
[1:05:38] nay in all these things we are more than
[1:05:44] conquerors through him that loved us for
[1:05:47] I am persuaded and I am to
[1:05:50] saints that neither death nor life nor
[1:05:53] angels nor principalities nor nor powers
[1:05:56] nor things present nor the things to
[1:05:58] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[1:06:02] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:06:05] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:06:09] Jesus our
[1:06:11] lord so when the devil tells you that
[1:06:13] there ain't no real
[1:06:15] Believers you can tell him you're
[1:06:17] looking at
[1:06:18] one the title of the message today is
[1:06:21] who is a real believer you're looking at
[1:06:24] one let's just our heads Heavenly Father
[1:06:27] Lord we're so grateful today to be
[1:06:29] assembled in your house in your presence
[1:06:32] we're grateful to have a place to
[1:06:35] Worship You Lord we're thankful that we
[1:06:38] get to have this opportunity Lord how
[1:06:41] many people around the world today would
[1:06:44] love to have the opportunity that we're
[1:06:46] afforded today Lord to come together
[1:06:49] with Believers of like Precious Faith to
[1:06:52] sit in comfort and hear the word of the
[1:06:54] Lord to to sing and to praise you lord
[1:06:58] lord without fear of our life or
[1:06:59] discrimination Lord Jesus Lord we're so
[1:07:03] grateful that you've given that to us
[1:07:04] Lord we don't want to take it for
[1:07:06] granted and now Lord as we have read the
[1:07:08] word Lord as we've sang your Praises now
[1:07:11] Lord we just pray that you would come
[1:07:13] into our midst and break to us the bread
[1:07:16] of life we'll commit it all into your
[1:07:18] hands in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:20] Christ and the church said amen God
[1:07:24] bless you may be seated and so good to
[1:07:26] be here with you this morning pray for
[1:07:28] us my family is is under attack and and
[1:07:32] I know that a lot of families have been
[1:07:34] I don't know I don't know who started
[1:07:36] this thing passing this junk around
[1:07:38] brother Chuck but whoever did it we're
[1:07:41] going to find
[1:07:43] you it's I tell you who did it it was
[1:07:45] the devil that did it and uh but my my
[1:07:49] how uh how it's been seems like running
[1:07:51] through the church and running through
[1:07:53] not just the church but everywhere but
[1:07:55] uh uh by the grace of God we're g to
[1:07:57] make it Saints and uh and uh and he's
[1:08:01] with us even in us always until the end
[1:08:03] so this little message this morning the
[1:08:06] devil really fought me about and I
[1:08:08] questioned is that something that even
[1:08:10] needs to be talked about is it something
[1:08:12] that we even need to to look at it seems
[1:08:15] rather simple it's probably one of the
[1:08:17] most simple messages that I've ever
[1:08:19] preached and um you know it just seems
[1:08:23] like sometimes uh want to bring
[1:08:26] something maybe maybe new or something
[1:08:28] that people haven't heard before uh but
[1:08:31] Saints I I don't I don't I don't see
[1:08:33] that in the message this is uh we we
[1:08:36] have the message and if there's anything
[1:08:38] that can be done is to remind us of the
[1:08:40] things that's already been said and but
[1:08:44] I have never seen a time where the enemy
[1:08:48] is trying to come against people and
[1:08:50] I've been privileged to travel all over
[1:08:52] the place and and many churches many
[1:08:55] different people talk to different
[1:08:56] Believers and then here also in our own
[1:08:59] church and then uh around just in the
[1:09:01] area here and I've never seen a time
[1:09:04] where the enemy is attacking
[1:09:07] people around the basis of their very
[1:09:11] salvation like he is today and it seems
[1:09:15] like uh so many people I've run across
[1:09:18] people here recently over the last few
[1:09:20] months that have been in the message
[1:09:23] years decades some of them and they're
[1:09:25] not exactly sure if they're even saved
[1:09:29] or not uh and and so you know don't ever
[1:09:33] think you're above that Saints don't
[1:09:35] don't ever think that that you're above
[1:09:37] the the devil getting in and plaguing
[1:09:39] your mind and making you doubt whether
[1:09:42] you even have the Holy Ghost whether
[1:09:44] you're even saved or not that's right
[1:09:47] and uh I I see it where the devil the
[1:09:49] enemy is coming in to try to make people
[1:09:51] think that they're just not good enough
[1:09:55] they're just not spiritual enough or
[1:09:58] they're not righteous enough or they're
[1:10:00] not holy enough and I'll tell you that's
[1:10:02] the truth we're not but he
[1:10:05] is and it seems like anxiety and
[1:10:09] depression and stress is at an alltime
[1:10:13] high that everybody brother Brown talked
[1:10:16] about it being under pressure where it
[1:10:18] seemed like everybody is under such a
[1:10:20] strain and and moving so fast and we get
[1:10:23] done with one thing and we go right
[1:10:25] straight into another thing and another
[1:10:27] thing and to another thing and and where
[1:10:29] are we going anyways what are we doing
[1:10:31] anyways and so you know we we run down
[1:10:34] the road brother Bram said 90 miles an
[1:10:35] hour to uh you know what we get get home
[1:10:38] and look at our phone or
[1:10:40] something and it's a time where we feel
[1:10:44] saints that we should make our calling
[1:10:48] and our election Shore that we should
[1:10:52] settle in our hearts that we know what
[1:10:55] we know that we believe what we believe
[1:10:58] that God has called us to this thing
[1:11:01] that God has called us to a message that
[1:11:03] we believe that message and that this
[1:11:06] message will introduce us to Jesus
[1:11:10] Christ and you know that's all us but
[1:11:13] what about the attack that the enemy is
[1:11:15] putting on our young people make no
[1:11:18] mistake that the enemy is after The
[1:11:22] Souls of our children and you can see a
[1:11:25] greater attack a greater emphasis on the
[1:11:28] young people than has ever been before
[1:11:31] by the enemy and he slips in so
[1:11:33] cunningly and so easily and sometimes as
[1:11:36] parents maybe were just ignorant to all
[1:11:39] the things going on with our young
[1:11:41] people and and I hate to say that but I
[1:11:45] I believe sometimes we have no idea the
[1:11:48] battles that they're fighting the
[1:11:50] challenges that they're up against the
[1:11:52] things that they're battling at school
[1:11:54] or the things that they're battling at
[1:11:56] home or the things that they're battling
[1:11:58] out in the world today it's it's an
[1:12:01] extraordinary pressure on the young
[1:12:03] people and they're more accessible to
[1:12:05] the devil than they've ever been and if
[1:12:09] you take a a look at at any any medium
[1:12:11] of communication that they have or any
[1:12:14] if they've got a phone they got they got
[1:12:16] they got direct access to every devil in
[1:12:19] hell I'll tell you that well what are
[1:12:20] you going to do Sayes you got to monitor
[1:12:22] it some as best you can but you can't be
[1:12:25] there all the time and if you monitor
[1:12:27] them you can't be around they're friends
[1:12:28] all the
[1:12:30] time oh come on somebody this morning so
[1:12:33] at some point in time we got to put them
[1:12:35] in the hands of the
[1:12:37] Lord and I'll tell you there's such an
[1:12:39] attack that people would even doubt
[1:12:41] whether they're saved whether they're
[1:12:43] whe they got the Holy Ghost they doubt
[1:12:44] whether they even belong to this message
[1:12:47] or not but brother brandham said and I I
[1:12:49] was I was I was worried about preaching
[1:12:51] this today but then as soon as we put
[1:12:53] the Sunday School tape on brother brand
[1:12:55] said it he said if there is one that
[1:12:57] makes it you be that one if there's one
[1:13:01] that's going to make it you be that one
[1:13:03] is that what the prophet said and so so
[1:13:05] no matter what the devil tries to tell
[1:13:07] you or what the enemy comes against you
[1:13:09] about you say if there's one that makes
[1:13:12] the Rapture I'm going to make it if you
[1:13:15] want to see somebody that's going in the
[1:13:17] Rapture look right
[1:13:19] here that's got to be your testimony
[1:13:23] Saints that's got to be what you believe
[1:13:26] that if anybody's going to make it it's
[1:13:27] going to be you now we want to take as
[1:13:30] many people as we can but it's just like
[1:13:32] when you're on the airplane they tell
[1:13:34] you when the oxygen mask drops down if
[1:13:36] you got kids with you you don't put the
[1:13:38] ma mask on the kids first you put yours
[1:13:41] on
[1:13:42] first then you pick which kid you like
[1:13:45] the best and put theirs on
[1:13:50] next that's not what they
[1:13:53] say but you you got to help yourself
[1:13:56] first before you can help others amen
[1:13:59] you got to help your family first before
[1:14:01] you can help somebody else's family you
[1:14:03] got to help your church first before you
[1:14:05] can help somebody else's church is that
[1:14:08] right Saints now brother Brown said the
[1:14:10] third seal he said I don't want to scare
[1:14:12] you and I I don't think it's going to
[1:14:15] it's that way but I just want to tell
[1:14:16] you what he said and you know it
[1:14:18] yourself as it was in the days of Noah
[1:14:21] wherein eight Souls were saved by water
[1:14:23] eight Souls out of the world were saved
[1:14:25] by water well you say oh my there's no
[1:14:28] need of me
[1:14:29] trying come on somebody there's no need
[1:14:33] in me trying he there's no need in me
[1:14:35] trying he said that shows you hadn't got
[1:14:37] the kind of Faith you need he says oh my
[1:14:40] there's no need of me TR he says go he
[1:14:42] said uh if there's going to be one
[1:14:46] that'll be me amen CU I
[1:14:50] Believe come on somebody today see
[1:14:54] that's that's the way you got to believe
[1:14:55] it he said be me sure I want to live so
[1:14:59] close to him that I know he's going to
[1:15:01] make he's going to take me when he comes
[1:15:04] I believe it that's right so if if
[1:15:06] everybody else misses it I am going to
[1:15:09] be there by his
[1:15:11] grace cuz he promised me that and I know
[1:15:14] that I'll be there cuz he he can't
[1:15:17] lie he says and I know my soul and life
[1:15:20] Bears record and I try to live daily
[1:15:22] just like he was coming so I'm going to
[1:15:25] be that one that's the way you want to
[1:15:28] feel now see that's not arrogant Saints
[1:15:31] brother said you want to feel that way
[1:15:34] that if anybody makes it it's going to
[1:15:36] be
[1:15:41] you he said that's the way you want to
[1:15:43] feel if there's going to be eight I'll
[1:15:46] be one of that eight if there's going to
[1:15:48] be 500 I'm going to be one out of that
[1:15:50] 500 I don't know about the other fella
[1:15:53] but I want to be one of that 500 see
[1:15:56] that's the way you want to remember see
[1:15:59] and he says if you don't remember it
[1:16:00] like that then there's something wrong
[1:16:02] with your faith see you're you're not
[1:16:05] sure you're saved yet then he says
[1:16:08] you're just guessing at it don't do that
[1:16:12] see it's not a a thing where we want to
[1:16:14] guess whether we're all right or not or
[1:16:16] guess whether we're okay or not or guess
[1:16:19] whether we're going to make a wraps or
[1:16:20] not we want a faith to settle it
[1:16:25] and he gave three points there that I
[1:16:26] want to emphasize first thing
[1:16:29] he by his grace I'm going to be there by
[1:16:34] his grace I'm not counting on my grace
[1:16:38] I'm counting on his grace I'm not
[1:16:40] counting on my righteousness I'm
[1:16:42] counting on his
[1:16:45] righteousness s we got to get back to
[1:16:48] preaching a message of
[1:16:50] Grace brother BR refers to this message
[1:16:54] as the message of Grace this message is
[1:16:57] the message of Grace that was sent to
[1:17:00] you and I
[1:17:02] today it's called the message of
[1:17:10] Grace and we got to preach that not one
[1:17:14] of us is good
[1:17:15] enough but we're going to make it
[1:17:19] because of his
[1:17:22] grace come on somebody today
[1:17:26] I'm making it if you want to see
[1:17:29] somebody who has the grace of God you're
[1:17:32] looking at
[1:17:38] him now the last time I preached here I
[1:17:41] read that quote to you about Papa
[1:17:44] Cox y'all remember that and I I found
[1:17:47] another quote where brother br's talking
[1:17:49] about Papa Cox and he said on uh he's
[1:17:52] talking about how that Christ was was
[1:17:54] the smitten Rock when Moses smoked the
[1:17:57] Rock and brought forth water he talks
[1:17:59] Christ was the smitten Rock and broken
[1:18:03] sists and he said our judgment was upon
[1:18:06] him our judgment was upon Him Saints say
[1:18:10] we want to carry our judgment but our
[1:18:12] judgment was upon him when the devil
[1:18:15] tries to remind you of your judgment but
[1:18:18] your judgment was taken from you and
[1:18:21] placed on
[1:18:23] him amen
[1:18:27] and he said from that he might come the
[1:18:30] spirit of life that would give you and
[1:18:32] me eternal life that's a perfect parable
[1:18:35] of it there in this Wilderness he says
[1:18:39] they never had to pull dig pump anything
[1:18:43] just partake of his provided
[1:18:46] way see Saints it ain't a work that we
[1:18:49] can do we we can't work our way in there
[1:18:52] we ain't got to pull our way in there we
[1:18:53] ain't got to push our way in there we
[1:18:55] just accept the provided
[1:19:02] way yes they didn't have to dig it out
[1:19:06] of a pond they didn't have to pull it
[1:19:07] with a bucket they didn't have no window
[1:19:10] to get with get with get it with they
[1:19:14] just had to partake of it and that's all
[1:19:17] there is now you don't have to join
[1:19:18] nothing you don't have to get down to
[1:19:20] the Altar and work up something pumping
[1:19:22] it you don't have to say a word oh over
[1:19:24] and over until you get a confusion of
[1:19:26] language there's only one thing that you
[1:19:29] do is just partake of him
[1:19:31] freely God's provided way no pumping no
[1:19:35] pushing no nothing just take it freely
[1:19:38] nothing you have to do just partake of
[1:19:40] it that's it just believe it that's all
[1:19:44] I can say to it they never they never
[1:19:46] had to do anything for it they never had
[1:19:48] to dig for it they never had to get down
[1:19:51] and cry all night for it they just
[1:19:53] partook of it it was smitten and ready
[1:19:56] that's right and he says I'm looking at
[1:19:58] a man now he's talking about Papa Cox he
[1:20:01] says I'm looking at a man now sitting
[1:20:03] back there on the room here I remember
[1:20:05] telling him on an old barn stall One Day
[1:20:09] by a manger and he said no but I'm no
[1:20:12] good I said I know you're not oh my God
[1:20:16] he says I'm no good he said I know
[1:20:18] you're not and he said but I'm not
[1:20:21] either he said but I said you're looking
[1:20:23] at what you are quit looking at what you
[1:20:26] are and look at what he is he said he he
[1:20:30] said if I could just get rid of these
[1:20:32] cigarettes there we go and brother Bram
[1:20:35] he said I I would be a Christian I said
[1:20:37] don't get rid of
[1:20:41] them he said you're trying to get good
[1:20:44] enough and then come to him he never
[1:20:47] come to save good men he came to save
[1:20:50] bad man that knowed they were
[1:20:53] bad oh God he didn't come to save good
[1:20:58] men he come to save bad men that knew
[1:21:01] they were
[1:21:03] bad oh there might not be a lot I'm sure
[1:21:05] of but I am sure that I was a bad
[1:21:13] man
[1:21:15] amen he came to
[1:21:18] save he said listen you don't want to go
[1:21:21] to hell do you that's a good question
[1:21:24] didn't it he said no I said well you
[1:21:29] don't have to he died that you might not
[1:21:33] have to
[1:21:34] go and said what do I have to do I said
[1:21:38] nothing it's just that
[1:21:42] simple what do I have to do he said
[1:21:44] nothing it's just that
[1:21:49] simple he said but if I can ever I said
[1:21:53] there you go back to that cigarette
[1:21:55] again quit thinking about that cigarette
[1:21:58] just remember think about him what he
[1:22:01] did what he is not what you
[1:22:05] are you're no good and you never was and
[1:22:09] never will
[1:22:11] be oh that's that puts it in perspective
[1:22:13] doesn't it you're no good you never was
[1:22:17] and never will
[1:22:21] be he said but he was
[1:22:26] L but what he is he's the one and I said
[1:22:30] now the only thing only one thing you
[1:22:33] have to do if he took your place down
[1:22:36] there you just willingly accept what he
[1:22:38] did only thing you have to do is just
[1:22:41] accept it why he said that's simple I'll
[1:22:43] do that yes sir and I said here's a
[1:22:47] creek see and I brought him up here and
[1:22:49] baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:22:52] and some of his people are sitting here
[1:22:54] and I know they felt funny about at me
[1:22:57] for doing that but I know what I was
[1:22:59] doing he said I seen the man something
[1:23:03] that was
[1:23:05] genuine see Saints we we we may not be
[1:23:09] no good but we can be sincere we can be
[1:23:14] genuine and he said I seen something
[1:23:17] that was genuine I could see it there
[1:23:19] and I took him and baptized him in the
[1:23:21] name of the Lord Jesus and when we did
[1:23:24] that it wasn't long after that till I
[1:23:26] went down to his son's house and I seen
[1:23:28] a vision we seen a vision of a tree
[1:23:30] being broke at a certain place and the
[1:23:33] man fell and almost broke his back he's
[1:23:35] talking about Papa Cox almost broke his
[1:23:37] back and he said they took him in the
[1:23:40] hospital and that night the Lord
[1:23:42] revealed to me that that was the end of
[1:23:44] the
[1:23:48] cigarettes so the next day he wanted
[1:23:51] some
[1:23:52] cigarettes and I said now this is what
[1:23:55] the prophet
[1:23:56] said he said and I said I'll buy him a
[1:24:01] carton and take to
[1:24:07] him he said you just watch and see his
[1:24:11] cigarettes days are done and he's never
[1:24:15] smoked one sense and never wanted one
[1:24:21] sense now here is an example of Christ
[1:24:26] taking a bad man that never was no good
[1:24:29] and never will be no good and saving
[1:24:33] that
[1:24:34] man and then cleaning that man's life
[1:24:38] up and that's the way it's got to
[1:24:44] come so the first thing brother Bram
[1:24:46] said is I know I'm GNA make it because
[1:24:49] of his
[1:24:52] grace the second thing he said cause he
[1:24:56] promised me that and I know that I'll be
[1:24:59] there because he can't
[1:25:04] lie so the first reason you can say well
[1:25:08] who's a real believer you're looking at
[1:25:10] it it's because of his
[1:25:12] grace the second reason is because he
[1:25:16] promised you'd make it and he can't
[1:25:19] lie didn't I read that in our word
[1:25:22] opening the scriptures he he's is not
[1:25:24] going to lose a one he he can't lose one
[1:25:28] neither death nor life nor things
[1:25:30] present nor things to come nor death
[1:25:33] height or breadth or depth anything can
[1:25:36] separate you from the love of God that's
[1:25:38] in Christ
[1:25:41] Jesus Hallelujah Philippians 1:6 says
[1:25:44] being confident of this very thing that
[1:25:47] he which has begun a good work in you
[1:25:50] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[1:25:53] Christ
[1:25:56] yes so he don't halfway save you he
[1:25:59] don't halfway get you there he ain't
[1:26:01] going to halfway get you into a Rapture
[1:26:04] but he's going to be with you even in
[1:26:06] you until the
[1:26:08] end the god that started to work in your
[1:26:11] life is the same God that will deliver
[1:26:13] you at the day of the
[1:26:19] Rapture or what kind of God are we
[1:26:21] serving second Timothy the first chapter
[1:26:24] he said I know in whom I have believed
[1:26:27] and am persuaded that he is able to keep
[1:26:31] that which I have committed unto him
[1:26:33] against that
[1:26:39] day we know we'll make it because the
[1:26:42] word said you
[1:26:44] would we know we'll make it because of
[1:26:47] his grace will no one make it because he
[1:26:50] can't lie
[1:26:55] if you want to look at somebody that's
[1:26:57] going to make it you can look right here
[1:27:00] you can look right
[1:27:03] here if one makes it you be that
[1:27:07] one the third thing he said I love this
[1:27:11] he says and I know that my soul bears
[1:27:16] and life Bears
[1:27:18] record he said I know I'll make it
[1:27:20] because of Grace I know I'll make it
[1:27:23] because he said make it and he can't lie
[1:27:25] and I know I'll make it because my soul
[1:27:28] and life Bears record and I try to live
[1:27:31] daily just like he was coming and I'm
[1:27:34] going to be that
[1:27:37] one now see a lot of people try to
[1:27:39] accept it they want him to save them but
[1:27:41] they don't want him to be their lord
[1:27:43] they want salvation but but but they
[1:27:46] never let him rule over their life but
[1:27:48] brother BR said I know I'm going to make
[1:27:49] it because of his grace I know I'm going
[1:27:51] to make it because his word says and I
[1:27:53] know I'm going to make it because my
[1:27:55] life Bears record that he lives in
[1:28:00] me and he says and I try key word is try
[1:28:05] I try to live daily just like he was
[1:28:10] coming so let me ask you something today
[1:28:12] Saints are you doing your best to live a
[1:28:14] Christian
[1:28:15] Life I mean I'm not saying we can't do
[1:28:18] better all of us can do better all of us
[1:28:22] can get better all of us can do more all
[1:28:26] of us can be better Christians but if
[1:28:28] you're trying your best today to live a
[1:28:31] Christian Life what else can you
[1:28:34] do is your soul tendered to the word of
[1:28:37] God is your soul tender when you when
[1:28:40] you hear the word does the word correct
[1:28:42] the error in your life that's a good
[1:28:44] that's a good barometer of your
[1:28:46] spiritual condition see none of us are
[1:28:49] perfect but when we hear the word if
[1:28:52] it's if our soul is tender and the word
[1:28:54] can correct
[1:28:58] usall that's what the word's
[1:29:00] for and you don't get mad about it you
[1:29:03] want to be corrected everyone if you
[1:29:05] want to be right if you truly want to be
[1:29:08] right and you can receive the word and
[1:29:11] allow the word to correct the error in
[1:29:13] your life that's a good barometer It's
[1:29:16] Your Soul Bears
[1:29:20] record amen I'm not what I want to be
[1:29:25] and not what I ought to be but I'm not
[1:29:27] what I used to be and I'm getting better
[1:29:30] every day well when you see me tomorrow
[1:29:32] you're going to see a better man than
[1:29:33] you seen today is that your testimony
[1:29:35] Saints oh I want to be
[1:29:39] better amen see we'll never stop
[1:29:42] learning I don't believe that we're
[1:29:45] going to keep learning we're going to
[1:29:47] keep growing I've been in the message
[1:29:49] you say I've been in the message 70
[1:29:50] years you can still learn I've been in
[1:29:52] the message 50 years you can you can
[1:29:54] still learn I've been in the message 25
[1:29:56] years you can still
[1:29:59] learn when I gave my heart to the Lord
[1:30:02] there were things that I did not know
[1:30:04] come on
[1:30:06] somebody I I wasn't born into this world
[1:30:10] into this world I spent the first 21
[1:30:13] years of my life serving a
[1:30:15] devil and when I was born again I wasn't
[1:30:19] born sprinting running I had to learn to
[1:30:23] walk is that right am I stumbled around
[1:30:26] I didn't know what I wasn't for sure
[1:30:28] about a lot of
[1:30:29] things and I remember things that I
[1:30:32] didn't
[1:30:33] know and nobody beat me up about it
[1:30:36] nobody at the church called me down and
[1:30:39] told me how rotten I was for doing
[1:30:41] things and I would hear something on a
[1:30:43] tape and I would almost get mad at them
[1:30:47] I say are you kidding me y'all been
[1:30:49] letting me do that when brother Brown
[1:30:51] said this on tape
[1:30:57] but I was a
[1:30:59] baby you you can't whoop a baby when
[1:31:01] he's trying to learn to
[1:31:03] walk now if I was still doing it when I
[1:31:06] was a teenager I needed a whooping is
[1:31:08] that right but when somebody's new and
[1:31:11] they're learning and they're growing and
[1:31:13] they're being corrected and they're
[1:31:14] figuring their way around we don't we
[1:31:16] don't bash them or beat them
[1:31:21] up and I'm still
[1:31:26] learning I'm still hearing stuff every
[1:31:28] day I didn't know or I never paid
[1:31:32] attention to
[1:31:35] before I
[1:31:37] remember was listen to questions and
[1:31:39] answers and my my girls would ask me
[1:31:43] about coloring their
[1:31:45] hair this might tense up I don't
[1:31:49] know well I would just say well brother
[1:31:51] brand said color it whatever just don't
[1:31:54] cut it is that what he said just don't
[1:31:57] cut it leave it let it grow and I I was
[1:32:01] talking about questions and answers well
[1:32:03] then one day I was listening to the
[1:32:05] message Blasphemous names brother
[1:32:08] Chuck and in the message Blasphemous
[1:32:11] names they asked him and he talked about
[1:32:13] he talked about coloring your
[1:32:15] hair and he said this is a part that
[1:32:18] struck me and this was just here
[1:32:19] recently probably three four years ago
[1:32:21] when I heard this and he said
[1:32:24] he says color it he said but he said if
[1:32:26] you got if you got if you got like if
[1:32:29] your hair got gray or something and you
[1:32:30] wanted to color it the the color that it
[1:32:32] was he said it'd be fine but he said if
[1:32:35] it was red and you colored it black you
[1:32:38] did
[1:32:42] wrong Welly that tightens up doesn't it
[1:32:46] but that's in Blasphemous names if you
[1:32:48] want to look it up amen but I went for
[1:32:51] 20 years and never knew that quote
[1:32:55] come on
[1:32:56] somebody when I read it you know what I
[1:32:58] did I sent it to my family I said leave
[1:33:01] it
[1:33:02] alone if it's if it's black and you want
[1:33:05] to keep it black keep it black if it's
[1:33:07] red and you want to keep it red keep it
[1:33:09] red but he said if you do if you change
[1:33:11] the color that it was you did
[1:33:15] wrong oh that's what the word
[1:33:18] said okay but I I didn't know Saints I
[1:33:22] was ignorant up until that point
[1:33:25] now I remember I was listening here uh
[1:33:28] back when we was at camp and I heard a
[1:33:29] quote where brother Brown said this now
[1:33:31] I've been I've been in the message 27
[1:33:34] years and I tell me how I'd never heard
[1:33:37] it but brother brandham said that you
[1:33:39] got the offices of the church and he
[1:33:41] said you don't Chuck I shared that with
[1:33:43] y'all we he said we don't we can't you
[1:33:45] can't pray for those you got you born
[1:33:47] that way if you're Apostle Prophet
[1:33:49] preacher teacher evangelist those things
[1:33:51] he said oh he said but then there's n
[1:33:54] spiritual
[1:33:55] gifts and he said those are the gifts
[1:33:58] that you're to pray
[1:34:02] for is that what it said Nathan where's
[1:34:04] Nathan at that's what it said those are
[1:34:07] the gifts that you're to pray
[1:34:09] for in 27 years I had never prayed for
[1:34:14] spiritual
[1:34:16] gifts I didn't
[1:34:20] know y'all don't believe that I'm G to
[1:34:22] read the quote tonight
[1:34:24] I'll read both those quotes tonight how
[1:34:26] about
[1:34:29] that my point is we're always
[1:34:33] growing we're always learning there's
[1:34:36] always more that we can get from the
[1:34:40] word amen so we can't judge ourselves
[1:34:42] because we're not perfect we may just
[1:34:45] not know
[1:34:47] yet
[1:34:49] amen but you say well in my heart I know
[1:34:52] I love the Lord Jesus well what more can
[1:34:54] you do Saints you have to just love the
[1:34:57] lord it's like brother brandham told
[1:34:59] sister Bruce on private interview if you
[1:35:01] hadn't listened to that it's it's it's
[1:35:03] about the best six minutes you can ever
[1:35:07] spend and he talks to Sister Bruce and
[1:35:09] she said I've never had an experience of
[1:35:12] being filled with the Holy
[1:35:14] Ghost now how many of you can relate to
[1:35:17] that I've never had an experience of
[1:35:19] being filled with the Holy Ghost that I
[1:35:22] could put my foot on
[1:35:24] and he said 'all right notice this he
[1:35:27] said ordinarily a human being is born in
[1:35:30] sin shaped iniquity come in a world
[1:35:33] speaking lies that's the nature of a
[1:35:35] human
[1:35:37] being Sister Bruce said yes and he
[1:35:42] says that was your
[1:35:46] nature it changed
[1:35:48] once but what changed it and she said
[1:35:53] Christ
[1:35:54] he said there you are sister that's
[1:36:06] it we want an
[1:36:09] experience or a
[1:36:11] sensation and God might do that for
[1:36:15] us but if you want to know about the
[1:36:17] Holy Ghost watch your
[1:36:21] nature you had one kind of
[1:36:24] nature and then you got another nature
[1:36:27] and brother BR said what did
[1:36:31] that look how complicated we try to make
[1:36:35] everything look look how look how
[1:36:38] difficult we try to make everything I
[1:36:39] think it's so we got something to preach
[1:36:43] on but Jesus said they they they they
[1:36:46] bind heavy burdens Grievious to be born
[1:36:51] they bind heavy burdens Grievious to be
[1:36:54] born and they lay them on men's
[1:36:59] shoulders and that's what that's what
[1:37:01] that nickeloden Spirit that's alive and
[1:37:04] well in the land today tries to do it it
[1:37:07] tries to bind heavy burdens and lay them
[1:37:10] on your
[1:37:12] shoulders something that you got to do
[1:37:15] something that you got to that you got
[1:37:17] to attain to and and they asked Peter
[1:37:21] what must we do to be saved
[1:37:24] that's a good question and Peter said
[1:37:28] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:37:30] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:37:33] of your sins and you shall receive the
[1:37:36] gift of the Holy Ghost now that sounds
[1:37:38] like something I can
[1:37:41] do that sounds
[1:37:43] simple amen we got to get dumb enough
[1:37:47] just to believe what it said
[1:37:56] I'm amazed that as soon as God sets a
[1:37:59] people free they go as quickly as they
[1:38:02] can to try to get back in prison
[1:38:08] again I've been watching this in the
[1:38:10] message for years Saints it's it's not
[1:38:12] good enough to be a believer you you got
[1:38:15] to be a believer of this certain kind of
[1:38:17] believer a a believer of this certain
[1:38:19] kind of church or a believer of this
[1:38:21] certain kind of Doctrine
[1:38:24] or you got to be a believer of this
[1:38:25] certain click over here or or or you got
[1:38:28] to you got to it's teaching for Doctrine
[1:38:30] the Commandments of men you know what
[1:38:33] you got to do to be a believer you got
[1:38:34] to
[1:38:39] believe well if you're a Believer you'll
[1:38:41] go to this church or if you're a
[1:38:43] Believer you'll go to this Doctrine here
[1:38:46] if you're a Believer you'll listen to
[1:38:47] this tape if you're a Believer you'll go
[1:38:49] to this certain Camp over here Saints
[1:38:51] you don't have to do any of that to be a
[1:38:53] believer
[1:38:55] you have to believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:38:58] Christ
[1:39:00] amen or you got to worship this certain
[1:39:02] kind of way you got to do it this way
[1:39:05] you got to do it that way are you are
[1:39:06] you are you too loud are you too quiet
[1:39:08] or you too
[1:39:11] whatever I used to watch all the the dos
[1:39:15] and
[1:39:17] don'ts try to make all the sisters wear
[1:39:20] potato sacks so they're modest
[1:39:25] or their dresses that they trip over so
[1:39:27] they're
[1:39:28] modest but then when I would look at
[1:39:31] pictures of sister
[1:39:32] mea I said now that that's a classy
[1:39:36] looking woman right there but she didn't
[1:39:38] want dressed in no potato
[1:39:41] sack oh my here we
[1:39:48] go any rule that's not in this message
[1:39:52] ain't a rule I'll tell you that
[1:39:55] any rule that somebody comes up with
[1:39:57] that you have to live by that's not in
[1:39:59] this message ain't a
[1:40:06] rule I had a girl at work I was
[1:40:09] witnessing to a little bit and she was
[1:40:10] struggling because she'd been raised in
[1:40:13] church and she'd seen some hypocrisy and
[1:40:15] she had a pastor and the pastor had fell
[1:40:18] out and then she moved and had another
[1:40:21] pastor and another group and that Pastor
[1:40:23] fell out and she was just like I just
[1:40:26] you know I've just I don't know I've
[1:40:28] just give up on that and I said well
[1:40:32] look you you don't quit going to the gym
[1:40:36] because there's fat people
[1:40:41] there is that right or wrong Saints I
[1:40:45] mean e eating eating right and and and
[1:40:48] exercising we know that works we know it
[1:40:52] works but don't everybody at the gym do
[1:40:54] that do
[1:40:55] they this gospel we know it works Jesus
[1:40:59] Christ we know saves Jesus we know heals
[1:41:03] we know he's the same yesterday today
[1:41:06] and forever we know the gospel Works
[1:41:08] don't everybody that go to church
[1:41:10] believe
[1:41:12] that but it don't mean it don't
[1:41:19] work so we can't just look at the
[1:41:21] hypocrite and say whether it's all
[1:41:24] Hypocrites I'll tell you this it's all
[1:41:26] bad news in the world today it's all
[1:41:29] negative in the world today when you
[1:41:31] turn the news on it's just a bunch of
[1:41:33] trash I I can't even listen to it
[1:41:36] anymore Saints it's so bad even Trump
[1:41:39] can't fix
[1:41:43] it sin is
[1:41:45] abounding the cup of the amorites is
[1:41:48] filling
[1:41:50] up and I'll tell you we get caught in it
[1:41:54] and we get caught in traps it amazes me
[1:41:57] at how many Believers get all tied up in
[1:42:00] politics Saints that's not our
[1:42:03] field you you want to know about
[1:42:05] politics the prophet said it was corrupt
[1:42:07] from Pillar To
[1:42:09] Post I I don't know who's going to be in
[1:42:12] office next but I know whoever it is
[1:42:14] it's going to be worse than the one
[1:42:17] before it's going to keep getting worse
[1:42:20] until the Lord calls us on amen there's
[1:42:24] nobody going to straighten it out amen
[1:42:26] it I I don't I don't know who's getting
[1:42:28] in next nor does it matter it's not my
[1:42:31] field of effort or expertise this is my
[1:42:35] field this is what I pay attention to
[1:42:38] amen
[1:42:39] amen and sometimes in this world we get
[1:42:42] caught in traps we come up short we may
[1:42:46] do things or say things or think things
[1:42:48] that's wrong sometimes we
[1:42:51] struggle sometimes we're just better
[1:42:53] Christians than we are at other times
[1:42:56] and sometimes we can even get
[1:43:00] discouraged a Christian can get
[1:43:04] discouraged sometimes we can and the
[1:43:07] devil says well if you really believed
[1:43:09] you wouldn't be
[1:43:10] discouraged Saints anybody can be
[1:43:15] discouraged but I came today to tell you
[1:43:17] to be encouraged look up your Redemption
[1:43:21] draws near be encouraged you're part of
[1:43:24] the Bride today being Pur he calls you
[1:43:27] son he calls you daughter being
[1:43:32] encouraged every day when you get up no
[1:43:34] matter how rotten the day is you might
[1:43:37] get up every day and be sick broke dumb
[1:43:41] stupid but if you're saved you got
[1:43:44] something to shout
[1:43:49] about be encouraged this is just a short
[1:43:53] span but we're talking about eternity
[1:43:55] today
[1:43:57] Saints be
[1:44:02] encouraged now oh I'm so glad I can say
[1:44:05] I'm one of them today Saints I'm so glad
[1:44:08] I don't know where I don't know what my
[1:44:10] future holds I know what I was I know
[1:44:13] where he brought me
[1:44:16] from oh God supernaturally I'm one of
[1:44:20] them
[1:44:26] brother Brown said second-handed Rob he
[1:44:27] said when I heard the pastor say this
[1:44:29] morning that many are becoming
[1:44:32] discouraged it sound like brother
[1:44:33] brandom sat down and listened to brother
[1:44:36] Neville
[1:44:38] preach
[1:44:40] anyway he said many are becoming
[1:44:43] discouraged he says what we need brother
[1:44:47] is to take courage what we need is to be
[1:44:51] encouraged that's right trials may come
[1:44:54] we never was promised to be immune from
[1:44:57] them but he'll give us Grace to go
[1:45:01] through
[1:45:02] them and if the Mountain's too high to
[1:45:04] go over too deep to go under too wide to
[1:45:07] go around he'll give us Grace to go
[1:45:10] through it that's right just don't worry
[1:45:13] but keep your eyes on Christ he's the
[1:45:16] only one that can take us
[1:45:21] through oh Oh Glory Saints you're God's
[1:45:27] people
[1:45:36] today he will not lose a
[1:45:42] one now I know that there's a lot of
[1:45:45] fear-mongering out there and I know that
[1:45:49] the enemy Whispers all of these things
[1:45:53] well what if this group is right or what
[1:45:55] if that group is right what what what if
[1:45:57] they are right and you're going to miss
[1:45:59] something that's fear
[1:46:01] saintes amen and that's what the devil's
[1:46:03] tactic well run over here run over here
[1:46:05] and then and then you'll be all right
[1:46:07] well well wait a minute what what what
[1:46:08] about them over there maybe they're
[1:46:10] right maybe this one's right that one's
[1:46:12] right
[1:46:14] Saints it's the word that's right
[1:46:23] huh I know that the devil's real good at
[1:46:27] telling everybody they'll never make it
[1:46:29] but I'm telling you what the word
[1:46:32] says and I'd rather take the word of God
[1:46:35] over Satan's
[1:46:37] reasoning who's opinion do you want to
[1:46:39] take do you want to take Satan's opinion
[1:46:41] about it or you want to take what God
[1:46:43] said about
[1:46:45] it we should be the happiest people in
[1:46:48] all the world no matter what the day
[1:46:50] holds no matter what the day holds say
[1:46:53] no matter how bad the fight is that when
[1:46:55] you get up you know you got to fight
[1:46:57] today and you know you got to battle
[1:46:58] today but you can still be encourage
[1:47:01] knowing you're going to make
[1:47:03] it knowing that if you can't go around
[1:47:05] it you can't go over you can't go under
[1:47:08] he'll give you Grace to go right through
[1:47:09] the middle of
[1:47:15] it who saved today you're looking at
[1:47:19] it who's a Believer today well you're
[1:47:21] looking at it
[1:47:24] oh God you say oh you just telling the
[1:47:27] people what the what they want to hear
[1:47:28] no I'm telling you what the word
[1:47:31] said I'm preaching the gospel the gospel
[1:47:36] is the good news the good news that
[1:47:40] Jesus
[1:47:42] saved the gospel hallah we give up on
[1:47:47] preaching the
[1:47:51] gospel Man mark
[1:47:53] 16 go into all the world preach the good
[1:48:01] news they that believe will be
[1:48:05] saved do you believe
[1:48:09] Saints these Sons shall follow them that
[1:48:16] believe it's amazing how we can get so
[1:48:19] far removed from this most basic
[1:48:23] Point most basic doctrine of the
[1:48:28] message you say well we all know this if
[1:48:32] everybody knows this then why do you got
[1:48:34] so much doubt surrounding it why is
[1:48:37] there so many people doubting whether
[1:48:39] they even got it or not doubting whether
[1:48:42] they're part of the Bride or not if
[1:48:43] everybody knows this then why is there
[1:48:46] so much
[1:48:47] [Music]
[1:48:50] fear why are so many just giving up
[1:48:53] why are so many just
[1:48:55] discouraged because we're preaching on
[1:48:58] everything in the world you got to do to
[1:49:00] be a
[1:49:05] believer you know what you may not
[1:49:07] understand the
[1:49:10] seals you may not understand the 70
[1:49:14] weeks of
[1:49:15] Daniel anytime I think I know something
[1:49:17] I like to listen to Feast of the
[1:49:19] trumpets
[1:49:24] you may not understand all those
[1:49:26] things we want to understand those
[1:49:29] things we want God to reveal those
[1:49:33] things to
[1:49:34] us but that is not
[1:49:38] salvation you you're
[1:49:40] saved before you understand all those
[1:49:43] things but then God can add those things
[1:49:46] to
[1:49:47] you
[1:49:49] amen but we we don't doubt whether we're
[1:49:51] bride or not because we don't have all
[1:49:53] the Mysteries figured
[1:49:55] out now there's a quote where brother
[1:49:57] Brown s in questions and answers on
[1:49:58] Hebrews he was talking about this big
[1:50:01] Minister that come in town sound like it
[1:50:02] was a woman preacher and she was coming
[1:50:05] into Kentucky and he said there was a
[1:50:07] little old boy down there that couldn't
[1:50:09] hardly read right couldn't spell his own
[1:50:11] name and he said they wouldn't let him
[1:50:14] have the schoolhouse but they let this
[1:50:15] great big preacher come in and said they
[1:50:18] had a bunch of uh doctors of divinity
[1:50:20] and stuff and they and they said that
[1:50:22] great big preacher held two weeks of
[1:50:24] Revival and didn't get one single soul
[1:50:29] saved and then they said the father went
[1:50:31] back and said my boy's got a right I'm a
[1:50:33] taxpayer my boy's got a right to have
[1:50:35] this place let them let them preach and
[1:50:37] this boy that that started preaching
[1:50:40] couldn't read right had to have somebody
[1:50:43] else read the scripture for him he
[1:50:45] couldn't even read the scripture himself
[1:50:47] and he said he preached they only gave
[1:50:49] him two nights cuz he wasn't a big name
[1:50:51] and he preached two nights nights there
[1:50:53] and the very first night the 20 people
[1:50:55] came and gave their heart to the
[1:50:58] Lord including the big name
[1:51:04] preacher don't tell me it's how much you
[1:51:06] know
[1:51:11] Saints I hate the devil and his lies I
[1:51:14] hate all I'm sick of all this fear the
[1:51:17] Bible tells us to make our calling an
[1:51:20] election sure sometimes you got to get
[1:51:23] up in the morning look in that mirror
[1:51:25] and say I'm looking right straight at a
[1:51:27] child of God
[1:51:31] today who's a child of God you're
[1:51:34] looking at
[1:51:36] him if there's one you be that one who
[1:51:39] loves Jesus you can say well you looking

[1:55:22] Christian and then the works Will Follow
[1:55:25] You amen
[1:55:29] amen now brother BR talked about we we
[1:55:32] heard this I think it was
[1:55:36] uh maybe it wasn't Wednesday but Enoch
[1:55:38] he talked about him building the
[1:55:39] pyramids I think maybe brother Israel
[1:55:41] read this on Wednesday he talked about
[1:55:43] Enoch building the pyramids in
[1:55:45] Blasphemous names and he said they they
[1:55:48] they don't know how they ever built it
[1:55:50] they don't understand it he said
[1:55:53] couldn't even a razor edge razor blade
[1:55:56] slice the slices where that mortar
[1:55:59] should be he said there's no mortar in
[1:56:01] it it's just perfected uh put together
[1:56:05] and he said so that's what it is when
[1:56:07] Christ and a church becomes one there's
[1:56:11] no mortar between
[1:56:13] them see there's there's no Doctrine
[1:56:16] between
[1:56:17] them there's no Works between them the
[1:56:21] there there's no there's no isms between
[1:56:23] them there's no special group in there
[1:56:26] when the Christ and the church when the
[1:56:29] Christ when the church and the word
[1:56:31] become one there's nothing in between
[1:56:34] that church and the
[1:56:36] word and he said there's no more to
[1:56:38] between there's nothing between it's
[1:56:40] just God and the
[1:56:42] person God Christ and the person so
[1:56:47] Saints we just look in the mirror of
[1:56:48] God's word and we want to see our
[1:56:51] reflection in it and when we see our
[1:56:54] reflection we want that reflection to
[1:56:57] look like
[1:56:59] Jesus you should look like your
[1:57:04] daddy come on somebody
[1:57:07] today and when when when you walk it
[1:57:10] should look like Jesus walking and when
[1:57:12] you talk it should sound like Jesus
[1:57:16] talking and when you speak it should be
[1:57:19] his words coming out of your mouth
[1:57:22] is that
[1:57:25] right now second-handed robe this is one
[1:57:29] we listen to and he talked about the
[1:57:32] Manel and uh he talked about how that
[1:57:36] Elijah's Manel let's see paragraph
[1:57:39] 39 he
[1:57:41] said and Elijah after he threw his robe
[1:57:44] on him and tried it on him in other
[1:57:47] words Elijah the prophet who had the
[1:57:50] mantle of God on his shoulders he came
[1:57:52] down and laid it across Elijah Elisha
[1:57:55] the farmer to see if it would
[1:57:57] fit but it didn't
[1:58:00] fit Elijah's mantel didn't fit on
[1:58:05] Elisha and he said it taken about 10
[1:58:07] years to get altered to fit that
[1:58:14] mantel he said now God usually puts us
[1:58:18] in the shop and shms us up now he didn't
[1:58:22] alter his robe to fit
[1:58:25] Elisha he ordered Elisha to fit that
[1:58:31] robe and that's what he does today he
[1:58:34] Alters us to fit the robe not the robe
[1:58:39] to fit
[1:58:42] us oh God
[1:58:44] Saints it's not it's not the doctrines
[1:58:46] and things that we can come up with that
[1:58:48] we alter to fit us if we like something
[1:58:52] we you know I heard a new doctrine the
[1:58:53] other day it's really good I I love a
[1:58:55] good false Doctrine
[1:58:58] Chuck the the new doctrine I heard is
[1:59:02] that brother brandham because they don't
[1:59:04] want to believe all the message they
[1:59:07] said brother brandham preached to three
[1:59:09] kinds of Believers he preached to the
[1:59:12] believer make believer and the
[1:59:13] unbeliever and so when you do that then
[1:59:15] what you can do is you can sayi take the
[1:59:17] quotes that I want to believe and I'll
[1:59:20] say well that's the ones to the believer
[1:59:22] and all them quotes over there that I
[1:59:24] don't want to believe I'll say well
[1:59:25] that's to the make
[1:59:28] believer God don't alter his robe to fit
[1:59:31] us he Alters us to fit his robe
[1:59:38] Saints and he said it's God's robe and
[1:59:42] he made it perfect and he said he's got
[1:59:45] to bring us into that realm to make the
[1:59:48] robe to make the robe fit us we can't be
[1:59:51] perfect ourselves we know we can't
[1:59:55] there's no way for us to be and yet he
[1:59:57] said for us to be so but what he did he
[2:00:01] made a propetuating
[2:00:19] [Applause]
[2:00:20] [Music]
[2:00:22] solemnly upon the finished work of the
[2:00:25] Lord Jesus God sent him to the Earth and
[2:00:29] it was in him that we
[2:00:32] rest see the Garment ain't made to fit
[2:00:35] us we're made to fit the wedding garment
[2:00:39] amen and and and and we find these these
[2:00:41] these things that we go through and the
[2:00:43] battles that we fight and the tests that
[2:00:45] we're all going through and the stuff
[2:00:46] we're dealing with in our family and and
[2:00:48] the struggles in the church and the
[2:00:49] struggles in the at our job and the
[2:00:51] struggles everywhere and the fights
[2:00:53] whether we win or lose the battle we
[2:00:55] find it it's all just chipping away
[2:00:58] parts of us to make that garment
[2:01:03] fits because we're coming into a church
[2:01:06] of
[2:01:07] power but Power apart from character is
[2:01:11] satanic and so we have to go through
[2:01:14] these things to build character so that
[2:01:17] God can put Power in the church
[2:01:22] is that right
[2:01:25] Saints amen so when the battle comes we
[2:01:28] got to be
[2:01:30] happy we say praise the Lord that
[2:01:32] robee's fitting better all the time
[2:01:35] praise God you know it's like if you get
[2:01:37] a stomach virus you've been throwing up
[2:01:39] by three days oh it ain't good to go
[2:01:41] through but you know your pants fit
[2:01:45] better shirts fit a little better wasn't
[2:01:49] fun to go through but you lost a little
[2:01:51] weight that's good
[2:01:52] say some of these battles and some of
[2:01:54] these trials I mean it ain't good to go
[2:01:56] through them it's hard on you when you
[2:01:57] go through it but it makes you better so
[2:02:00] you can say praise God I'm getting
[2:02:03] better all the
[2:02:05] time every trial that comes I'm getting
[2:02:07] better and every test he gives me I'm
[2:02:10] getting better and every time I overcome
[2:02:12] I'm getting
[2:02:13] better he's chipping away the parts of
[2:02:17] me that won't fit in that wedding
[2:02:19] garments oh the breastplates fitting
[2:02:21] better oh the time the Buckle fits
[2:02:23] better now the helmet goes over these
[2:02:25] ears now the shield fits
[2:02:28] better it's fitting better all the time
[2:02:32] it's getting better all the time Saints
[2:02:35] it's getting better we're getting better
[2:02:36] all the time Saints can of musicians
[2:02:38] come it's getting
[2:02:42] better the worse things get out there
[2:02:44] the better it's getting the harder
[2:02:47] things get the better it's getting the
[2:02:49] tougher the days are the better it gets
[2:02:53] it's getting closer all the
[2:02:55] time we're getting more like him all the
[2:03:09] time there's a people under their
[2:03:11] messenger that will be the final voice
[2:03:14] to the final
[2:03:16] age that's what the prophet
[2:03:19] said not excluding their messenger
[2:03:22] they'll be under their
[2:03:23] messenger they'll be following their
[2:03:26] messenger there's a people that's
[2:03:28] following this messenger that will be
[2:03:30] the final voice to the final age there's
[2:03:33] a power coming in the church
[2:03:35] Saints but Power apart from C character
[2:03:38] is
[2:03:39] satanic we got to have the character to
[2:03:42] handle the blessing that God pours
[2:03:45] out can we bow our
[2:03:49] heads second-handed Ro brother said we
[2:03:52] don't need the teachings we have
[2:03:56] that but we need the god of
[2:03:59] Elijah we need the power of the god of
[2:04:03] Elijah back in our
[2:04:06] church the power to make it hold there
[2:04:11] and God
[2:04:12] calls and call God's word right
[2:04:16] regardless second-handed Ro paragraph
