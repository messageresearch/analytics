[5:08] meets just exactly like that oh may we
[5:11] all not just take this as a lecture but

[5:27] praying we get to dig up the line of
[5:30] those great men back in there how they
[5:32] sacrificed you'll see how little you've
[5:34] done makes me feel ashamed of myself
[5:38] sometimes how we have to have everything
[5:39] so easy and they had everything so hard
[5:42] wandered about Paul said in Hebrews 11
[5:44] and sheep skins and goat skins tormented
[5:47] and Afflicted
[5:49] destitutes what will our testimony stand
[5:52] upside of theirs how will it be up the S
[5:55] side of that we have to have everything
[5:57] so nice now
[6:00] just in respects before we open the book
[6:03] I'd like for us all who can just stand
[6:05] for a moment for
[6:10] prayer now with the sincerity of your
[6:12] heart breathe a word of prayer for to
[6:17] God Lord God the creator of heavens and
[6:21] earth the author of everlasting life and
[6:24] The Giver of all good and perfect gifts
[6:29] we would ask you Lord first to forgive
[6:32] us of all of our indifferences and our
[6:35] sins and our trespasses against thee and
[6:39] against one another in our fellow
[6:42] man may this little time of coming
[6:46] together not only be for the edifying of
[6:50] our own Souls but may it be to Enlighten
[6:54] Us in such a way and Inspire us to we'll
[6:56] go tell
[6:58] others may it be a time of
[7:02] rededication uniting with the full body
[7:05] of Christ and being ready for the
[7:08] Rapture father God not by my own
[7:12] feelings knowing that thy servant and
[7:15] all other servants are insufficient for
[7:18] this great
[7:20] task realizing how great man gone by has
[7:25] hook up on their hearts to try to reveal
[7:28] this or to comment upon the great
[7:32] Revelation then we realize that we're
[7:35] more than they are
[7:37] insufficient but Thou Art our
[7:40] sufficiency I pray heavenly father that
[7:43] you will do something special during
[7:46] this time that the holy spirit will have
[7:49] pretence in their heart yes circumcise
[7:52] the lips that speak in the ears that
[7:55] hear and when this is all over and we
[7:59] dedicated to you may we walk from under
[8:02] the threshold of this
[8:05] house saying it was good for us to be
[8:08] there the Holy Spirit spoke to us while
[8:12] we were sitting there and now we are

[12:12] right we thank thee holy God in the name
[12:16] of thy son the Lord Jesus
[12:19] amen
[12:23] amen turning now to the book of the
[12:27] revelation
[12:29] first
[12:32] chapter now the first I want to read the
[12:37] first three
[12:40] verses of
[12:43] Revelations the revelation of Jesus
[12:45] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[12:48] unto his servant things which must
[12:51] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[12:54] signified it by his Angel un to his
[12:56] servant John
[12:59] who bear a record of the word of God and
[13:03] of the testimony of Jesus Christ and to
[13:07] all of all things that he saw blessed is
[13:12] he that readeth and they that hear the
[13:14] words of this prophecy and keep those
[13:17] things which are written therein for the
[13:19] time is at
[13:24] hand as I said before now in this we're
[13:27] going to try to give a little breakdown
[13:30] now of the
[13:32] book according to the histories and so
[13:35] forth and each time when you see me
[13:36] referring to pages that I have written
[13:38] here it's stuff that I have taken from
[13:40] commentaries and so forth
[13:43] now the writer of this book is John St
[13:47] John the
[13:49] Divine wrote to the future
[13:52] generation a be directed to the seven
[13:57] angels of the
[13:59] seven distinct periods of the Christian
[14:03] age a age from the days of the Apostles
[14:07] to the coming of the Lord and
[14:11] the
[14:13] Now the ages appear in succession each
[14:18] one from the Ascension of Our Lord to
[14:21] his coming again each Church age is the
[14:26] described of its spiritual condition
[14:31] e each Church age can behold Itself by
[14:35] its scriptural and spiritual speaking
[14:40] unto them as the spirit speaks each age
[14:43] can behold
[14:46] itself each age bore the True Vine of
[14:50] Christ the wise virgin and each
[14:54] age bore the grafted Vine the foolish
[14:58] version
[15:03] historians
[15:05] agree this is John's
[15:08] Life John lived the last of his years in
[15:12] the city of Ephesus and died
[15:15] there he was on the aisle of patmas at
[15:19] the time he wrote the book
[15:22] Revelation it was not the story of his
[15:25] life but the story of Christ in future
[15:29] ages the was a pro
[15:33] prophecy not the life of John not the
[15:36] life of Christ but prophesying of an age
[15:39] to
[15:45] come it was not his prophetic
[15:49] utterances but the
[15:51] Lord exaltation
[15:56] solemnly it was not the revelation of of
[15:59] St John the Divine but the revelation of
[16:03] Christ the
[16:05] Lord it is the last book of the New
[16:10] Testament yet it tells the beginning and
[16:13] the end of the dation of the
[16:18] Gospel go Bible scholars
[16:23] agreed the letters to the seven Church
[16:26] Ages were written prophetically to the
[16:29] Future
[16:31] ages Paul wrote of the life and glory of
[16:35] the seven churches present in his
[16:37] days John wrote of the life and glory of
[16:41] the seven churches in the
[16:44] future that John
[16:47] was addressing the seven pastors or
[16:51] Messengers as direct all Christians
[16:54] under these seven different angels
[17:01] now the Book of Revelations now we're
[17:04] going to take as we break this down for
[17:07] this morning and this evening and we'll
[17:09] try to let out about
[17:11] 11:00 and 11:30 something like that and
[17:14] then begin again tonight at 7 now the
[17:17] contents of this first chapter the first
[17:21] verse it it really speaks for itself
[17:24] because it is the revelation of Jesus
[17:28] Christ
[17:30] second verse St John the Divine is the
[17:35] Scribe and servant third verse the
[17:38] blessings pronounced the fourth to the
[17:41] sixth verse the salute to the church the
[17:44] seventh verse the
[17:47] announcement the eighth verse the
[17:50] Supreme deity of Jesus Christ the 9th to
[17:54] the 20 verse the patmas
[17:57] vision and all also the 14th and 15th
[18:00] verses describes his Sevenfold Glory of
[18:03] his
[18:05] person oh it's beautiful when we see
[18:08] Christ and his Sevenfold personages of
[18:12] his Sevenfold beings of his personages
[18:15] in his glorious
[18:18] Resurrection now the title describes the
[18:23] character the revelation of Jesus Christ
[18:26] not the revelation of St John the Divine
[18:30] but the revelation of Jesus Christ the
[18:32] son of
[18:33] God now the Greek word for Revelation is
[18:38] the apocalyps which means the
[18:42] unfolding and I was taking that word and
[18:45] searching it it means the apocalypsis is
[18:49] to like a sculpture has made a great
[18:53] statue and he's got it covered by a
[18:57] veil and then he he goes and tears back
[19:01] this Veil and
[19:04] reveals what he has behind the veil it's
[19:09] an
[19:11] uncovering and this book is not the
[19:15] uncovering of so much the person of
[19:18] Jesus Christ yet it certainly speaks of
[19:20] his deity and his Sevenfold personage
[19:24] and also of the things that he is like
[19:28] priest king and so forth but it is the
[19:32] revealing of the future of his works in
[19:37] the seven Church ages that's coming on
[19:41] it's when our Lord was on Earth the
[19:43] disciples asked him and said Master will
[19:46] you at this time uh restore the kingdom
[19:50] back to
[19:52] Israel and Jesus said it's not for you
[19:55] to know this hour or time
[19:59] and no one would know said even the son
[20:03] as yet did not know but after his death
[20:07] burial and resurrection and Ascension in
[20:09] the glory he received from God the
[20:14] future of the church then he returned
[20:17] back to bring this message to the
[20:20] church and this message of his coming
[20:25] and the condition of his churches down
[20:28] through the AG
[20:29] he could not do it before his death
[20:31] burial and Resurrection because he had
[20:32] not yet knew it but did you notice how
[20:37] the scripture reads here uh the
[20:40] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[20:42] gave unto him
[20:45] Christ how that God the Father gave the
[20:50] Revelation to his son Jesus Christ and
[20:52] he sent his Angel to John to signify
[20:56] these things which was which was which
[21:00] is and which shall be oh it's set
[21:05] beautifully now in this great uh coming
[21:10] age that John saw now these um this
[21:14] Revelation was given to him strictly to
[21:18] unveil the specific purpose of Christ
[21:23] what he would be and be like in every
[21:25] age that's the reason I said this
[21:28] morning
[21:29] keep your mind on the True
[21:32] Church the true church begin on the day
[21:35] of
[21:36] Pentecost there's no Theologian Bible
[21:39] scholar or historian can ever say that
[21:43] it began in the days of Mart Luther
[21:45] Wesley Catholic age or any other age it
[21:49] begin at
[21:52] Pentecost that was the inauguration of
[21:54] the church that was the beginning so
[21:57] therefore in a discussion with
[21:59] anybody stand at that gate of Pentecost
[22:03] and they cannot go nowhere
[22:05] else just like putting a rabbit in a
[22:08] field you know wherever a hole is so you
[22:10] got to stopped up he'll have to come
[22:11] right back to this same place where you
[22:13] come in at well that's why anyone
[22:15] talking about churches and church ages
[22:17] and works of the Holy Spirit you'll have
[22:19] to come back to the original
[22:24] beginning it's got to come back to there
[22:26] because God is in
[22:29] infite and he's
[22:32] omnipotent therefore him being infinite
[22:35] he cannot do something here and do
[22:37] something contrary to it over here he's
[22:40] got to do each time like he did it the
[22:41] first time like Peter said on the day of
[22:45] when the Gentiles received the Holy
[22:48] Spirit he said can we forbid
[22:52] water seeing that they have received the
[22:55] Holy Ghost like we did at the beginning
[23:00] Jesus when he was on Earth spoke and
[23:03] said it someone come and said is it
[23:06] lawful for us put a we wise for any
[23:08] cause Jesus said uh he that made male
[23:11] made female for this cause a Manel he
[23:14] said but Moses suffered us a writing of
[23:16] divorce and Jesus said it wasn't so from
[23:19] the
[23:20] beginning go back to the beginning
[23:23] therefore if we go talk on the church
[23:25] age we've got to go back to the
[23:27] beginning lay aside every statement that
[23:30] any man has made down to the
[23:33] age this is the most official book of
[23:36] any book in the
[23:38] Bible this is the only book that Christ
[23:40] put his seal
[23:42] upon it starts off with the blessing and
[23:44] ends with a curse blessing is he that
[23:46] readeth and curseth is he that takes
[23:48] anything out of
[23:49] it it's the only book that Christ wrote
[23:53] himself of the whole Bible The Ten
[23:56] Commandments he wrote with his fingers
[23:57] that's right Jews held on to that and
[24:00] today it's the the Revelation and if
[24:04] Satan hates any book in the Bible it's a
[24:08] revelation these two he hates all
[24:10] scripture and it's the whole Cannon of
[24:13] scripture but if anything he despises
[24:15] mostly is Revelations and
[24:18] Genesis because Genesis tells the
[24:20] beginning Revelation reveals what's
[24:23] going to happen to him in the last days
[24:26] going to be bound a thousand years than
[24:27] him and the false prophet the Beast is
[24:30] going to be thrown alive into the Lake
[24:31] of Fire and he'll attack the Book of
[24:36] Genesis upon it it's uh uh being
[24:40] authentic he'll say that it isn't
[24:42] authentic he'll stir the minds of people
[24:45] watch where the devil lays that book of
[24:47] Genesis or the Book of
[24:49] Revelations the first and the last and
[24:52] the Book of
[24:57] Revelations e
[25:36] under

[51:05] damage sister Talia for a vehicle and

[51:19] that right okay and also brother Alfred
[51:22] Moore is sick in his
[51:24] body sister Norma
[51:28] daughter araed was taken to the hospital

[1:14:37] because he knows all things so if it
[1:14:40] happened or is happening he allowed it
[1:14:43] or he did it himself and as a believer
[1:14:47] that helps places you in your mind how
[1:14:50] to approach things that are going on in
[1:14:52] your life amen and so we'd like to maybe
[1:14:56] talk a little bit on this great Weaponry
[1:14:59] that God has given us here in Ephesians
[1:15:02] chapter
[1:15:08] 6 in
[1:15:11] verse number 10 the scripture starts
[1:15:15] there finally my brethren be strong in
[1:15:19] the Lord and in the power of His might
[1:15:23] put on the whole armor of God that ye
[1:15:25] may be able to stand against the Ws of
[1:15:30] the devil so he's preparing you that you
[1:15:33] got to be able to stand against him for
[1:15:36] we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:15:40] blood but against
[1:15:43] principalities against Powers against
[1:15:46] the
[1:15:46] rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:15:51] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:15:54] places we'll take one more scripture I
[1:15:56] think it's in 2 Corinthians chapter 10
[1:16:03] quickly and then we'll come back to
[1:16:12] Ephesians verse number
[1:16:19] three for though we walk in the flesh we
[1:16:23] do not war after the flesh for the
[1:16:26] weapons of our Warfare are not what
[1:16:30] carnal But Mighty through God Amen to
[1:16:34] the pulling down of what strongholds
[1:16:38] strongholds strongholds this is a
[1:16:42] Battleground casting down
[1:16:45] imaginations and every High thing that
[1:16:48] does what that exalted itself against
[1:16:53] the knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:16:57] captivity which
[1:16:59] thoughts every single thought to The
[1:17:02] Obedience of Christ and having in a
[1:17:05] Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience
[1:17:09] when your obedience is fulfilled let's
[1:17:12] turn back to Ephesians 6 one more time
[1:17:16] verse 13 says wherefore take unto you
[1:17:21] the whole armor of God that ye may be
[1:17:25] able to withstand in the evil day and
[1:17:29] having done all to stand stand therefore
[1:17:34] amen may God add a blessing to the
[1:17:36] reading of his word let us pray if you
[1:17:39] have a need in your heart in your life
[1:17:41] right now I why don't you just think
[1:17:43] about it just for a moment what you need
[1:17:46] where you are and whatever that need is
[1:17:49] slip up your hand to him as we go to the
[1:17:52] Lord in prayer Lord Jesus you see those
[1:17:55] hands and the hearts and the needs
[1:17:58] behind the hand and father I just pray
[1:18:01] that you'll take full control of the
[1:18:03] service it is not my people it's your
[1:18:06] people it's not my church it's your
[1:18:08] church you brought them here none of us
[1:18:11] are responsible for bringing anybody
[1:18:14] here it's your responsibility Lord to
[1:18:18] care for your children and we believe
[1:18:20] that you're going to do that this
[1:18:22] morning we believe that you've given to
[1:18:24] us everything that we have need of and
[1:18:27] may you grant this blessing we pray in
[1:18:29] the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless
[1:18:32] you you may be seated let me start off
[1:18:35] by saying this right from the
[1:18:37] get-go the devil is
[1:18:40] real and he's a real enemy that is after
[1:18:44] the elected and the true child of God
[1:18:48] and what happens is he tries to muddy
[1:18:50] the waters in your life and in your
[1:18:53] thinking so you can start thinking well
[1:18:55] you're thinking this thought or this is
[1:18:57] you and you need to fight this battle
[1:19:00] I'm just a little weary today I'm
[1:19:02] feeling like things aren't flowing today
[1:19:05] um I wanted to do good but I'm not doing
[1:19:08] good um my bad I'm just no what that is
[1:19:11] is there's a real devil and anytime you
[1:19:14] go to do what's right or you hear what
[1:19:17] is right the enemy is there to hinder
[1:19:20] you and to stop you and if we would
[1:19:23] realize that Satan is real and if we can
[1:19:27] see his personage and know his origin
[1:19:31] his foundation where he's from the
[1:19:34] wisdom that he contains his ability to
[1:19:37] tempt his ability to persuade not just
[1:19:40] one or two people I'm talking about
[1:19:43] sanctified people even prophets even
[1:19:46] God's people he was able to get into
[1:19:49] their head get into their mind and cause
[1:19:52] them to do things and say things that
[1:19:54] were contrary so here the Bible is
[1:19:57] giving us a clear warning about the evil
[1:20:01] WS of the devil number one and number
[1:20:04] two the evil day that you and I would
[1:20:08] live in this is that day a day of
[1:20:14] lawlessness it's
[1:20:16] unfettered the the amount of wickedness
[1:20:19] that is taking place today the people
[1:20:21] don't care they'll abuse an old person a
[1:20:24] crippled person person a person who
[1:20:26] don't know no better and they just for
[1:20:28] no reason they'll go through and and
[1:20:30] they will they will shoot they will
[1:20:32] they'll punch a man or old man or old
[1:20:35] woman and video it and put it online and
[1:20:38] some of you all will look at it and some
[1:20:40] people will laugh at it and think it's
[1:20:42] funny but what is that Satan has poured
[1:20:45] out his anointing upon people and that
[1:20:49] anointing isn't just on the the the
[1:20:52] homie on the streets or the prostitute
[1:20:54] the drug dealer no it comes upon
[1:20:57] preachers pastors song leaders teachers
[1:20:59] people who's trying to follow the word
[1:21:01] because he has a goal and that is to
[1:21:04] influence and to get you to do what he
[1:21:08] wants to accomplish this is very clear
[1:21:11] instructions the Apostle Paul says
[1:21:14] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:21:18] Lord how can you be strong in the lord
[1:21:22] well he tells you how to do it he says
[1:21:24] to put on the whole armor of God how
[1:21:27] many know what the armor of God is it's
[1:21:30] the helmet of salvation the Blessed
[1:21:33] breastplate of righteousness the belt of
[1:21:36] Truth The Shield of Faith the sword of
[1:21:39] the word the boots to cover you with
[1:21:43] peace the righteousness of the Gospel
[1:21:45] the Peace of the Gospel so the whole man
[1:21:48] is covered with salvation with
[1:21:51] righteousness his head is covered his
[1:21:53] breast is covered he has a shield of
[1:21:55] Faith he has a sword his Weaponry that's
[1:21:58] really the only weapon he has is his
[1:22:00] sword he has a girdle that goes around
[1:22:02] his waist his truth then he's got on his
[1:22:05] boots to cover his feet the Bible tells
[1:22:08] us to put on the whole armor of God six
[1:22:13] armors there I'm going to add a seventh
[1:22:15] armor and it's right there in the word
[1:22:18] it's Verse
[1:22:20] 18 I like to work with the numbers as
[1:22:22] the prophet told us and these SE are six
[1:22:25] armors but let's take a seventh one in
[1:22:28] verse 18 says praying always with all
[1:22:33] prayer and supplication we know the
[1:22:34] prophet told us that prayer is the
[1:22:37] greatest weapon that was ever placed in
[1:22:39] the hand of a man now you want something
[1:22:42] you want an angel to appear to you some
[1:22:45] Supernatural star like Superman in the
[1:22:47] movies or Hollywood and some magic wand
[1:22:50] to come over your head to make you
[1:22:53] change your mind you got to change your
[1:22:55] mind based on what God has given you and
[1:22:59] the Lord deals with each man and each
[1:23:02] Woman by their conscience we've been
[1:23:05] talking about this whole man that your
[1:23:08] see taste feel smell and hear that makes
[1:23:11] up your outer being and then conscience
[1:23:14] memory reasons affections and
[1:23:16] imaginations that's the Inner Man and
[1:23:19] the word of God was sent to heal the
[1:23:22] whole man not just the outside of you
[1:23:26] but the inside of you and Satan has come
[1:23:29] to steal to kill and destroy and this is
[1:23:32] where this is where we are uh um this
[1:23:35] morning I want to bring you a picture I
[1:23:39] know I won't be able to get entirely
[1:23:41] through this message sis in the back I
[1:23:44] apologize I didn't give you any quotes
[1:23:46] but you you've done it before
[1:23:49] so I have several scriptures if I don't
[1:23:52] get to the quot all of the quotations
[1:23:55] there are um we we brought that the
[1:23:59] seven compound names of redemption
[1:24:02] Jehovah Gyra Jehovah shama Jehovah
[1:24:06] Shalom how many remember that the
[1:24:08] prophet of God brings that to us and I
[1:24:11] brought it to the church this you know
[1:24:14] the you know the seven
[1:24:17] compound confessions that you can make
[1:24:20] you make that confession that he's your
[1:24:22] healer he's your peace he's your
[1:24:24] Shepherd he's your righteousness and you
[1:24:26] take those seven Stripes of blood the
[1:24:30] Seven Virtues in second Peter chapter 1
[1:24:34] and you take the Seven Ages the Seven
[1:24:37] Seals All these numbers these sevens
[1:24:41] that God has given to the believer to
[1:24:43] protect him by and here in Ephesians
[1:24:47] speaks to us about this um the Warfare
[1:24:52] that we're in and that the battle ground
[1:24:54] that we're in now if we could see it
[1:24:58] we'll know that every evil thought and
[1:25:01] any bad mood bad agenda comes from
[1:25:06] somewhere and we all get anointed with
[1:25:09] the evil thinking the evilness that
[1:25:13] Satan will come in here you say I'm
[1:25:15] having a bad day well who gave you a bad
[1:25:17] day was it God was it the Holy Spirit
[1:25:21] who is trying to keep you from praying
[1:25:24] who determines whether this service
[1:25:27] breaks through under the anointing or
[1:25:29] not and let to show you in the scripture
[1:25:32] that this being called Satan he's not a
[1:25:35] new guy he's not a new character and
[1:25:37] he's not somebody to play with and we
[1:25:39] joke about it sometimes the devil made
[1:25:41] me do it um the devil ain't no joke and
[1:25:45] he's not a being that we should take
[1:25:48] lightly and play with the Bible says
[1:25:51] that we are not ignorant of his devices
[1:25:53] that's why we forgive our brothers and
[1:25:56] we know how to forgive because L Satan
[1:25:59] would place a trap upon us we're not
[1:26:02] ignorant of his devices he is a
[1:26:07] mastermind and you think the greatest
[1:26:10] Theologian uh uh that would make you
[1:26:14] feel um inferior just on the
[1:26:16] intellectual level that's nothing
[1:26:19] compared to Satan's ability and his
[1:26:23] wisdom and the power to influence
[1:26:26] Nations and large group of people even
[1:26:30] people who were called of God prophets
[1:26:33] even Kings even were influenced by him
[1:26:36] and so he's not nothing to play with
[1:26:38] let's take a scripture here the Old
[1:26:40] Testament deals with him in Ezekiel
[1:26:42] chapter
[1:26:43] 28 and the prophet Ezekiel 28:12 says
[1:26:47] son of man take up Lamentations upon the
[1:26:49] king of Tyrus and say unto him thus
[1:26:52] sayith the Lord God thou Sealth up the
[1:26:56] sum full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty
[1:27:01] he's talking about this devil now thou
[1:27:03] has has been in Eden the Garden of God
[1:27:07] every precious stone was thy covering
[1:27:10] the Sardis the topass the Diamond the
[1:27:12] barrel the ax The Jasper the sapphire
[1:27:16] the emerald the Carbonic and gold the
[1:27:20] workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy
[1:27:24] pipes was prepared in thee in the day
[1:27:27] thou was created Thou Art the anointed
[1:27:31] Cher that coverest and I have set thee
[1:27:35] so thou was upon the holy mountain of
[1:27:38] God thou walked up and down in the midst
[1:27:41] of the stones of fire that was perfect
[1:27:44] you were perfect in in thy ways from the
[1:27:47] day that thou was created till iniquity
[1:27:52] was found in thee by the
[1:27:54] thy multitude of thy merchandise they
[1:27:57] have filled the midst of thee with
[1:27:59] violence and thou H has sinned therefore
[1:28:03] I will cast thee as profane out of the
[1:28:06] Mountain of God and I will destroy thee
[1:28:08] Oh covering cherub from the midst of the
[1:28:12] stones of fire thine heart was lifted up
[1:28:16] thine heart his heart was lifted up
[1:28:19] because of what his Beauty he was
[1:28:23] telling ented he was handsome he was
[1:28:28] attractive he had a talent he had gifts
[1:28:31] and that's what lifted him up in Pride
[1:28:35] you think you start doing a little bit
[1:28:37] better you know you know when you don't
[1:28:38] have nothing you know how to pray when
[1:28:41] you broke you know how to pray when
[1:28:43] you're in trouble you know how to pray
[1:28:45] but as soon as God begins to bless you
[1:28:48] bless your ministry bless your church
[1:28:51] you don't have to help me preach it's
[1:28:52] okay I'm going to lay this word out here
[1:28:54] to do soon as God begins to bless any
[1:28:56] man any woman gifted talented can sing
[1:29:01] Satan is there to lift them up in Pride
[1:29:05] so that they can think it's them now my
[1:29:07] gift my talent my Ministry you're on
[1:29:10] your road out if you don't stay at the
[1:29:13] altar and keep that gift before the God
[1:29:17] who gave you life amen
[1:29:22] amen yes Satan came to church this
[1:29:25] morning he's at every Gathering yes he
[1:29:29] comes to take part in the service he
[1:29:32] don't want you to enter in he wants you
[1:29:34] to get up and go get a drink of water he
[1:29:37] wants you to think about work tomorrow
[1:29:39] he don't want you to catch a revelation
[1:29:42] of what the Holy Ghost is trying to do
[1:29:45] in your life
[1:29:47] amen amen somebody
[1:29:56] iniquity was found in his heart he was
[1:29:58] lifted up Ezekiel 2812 in the
[1:30:02] NIV talks about gives some more
[1:30:06] descriptions in there the ESV and some
[1:30:09] other translations there um talks about
[1:30:13] this beauty and how he was
[1:30:16] expelled he was a guardian cherub he was
[1:30:19] in charge of other angels He had a
[1:30:23] position
[1:30:24] he had the ability that God had except
[1:30:27] he couldn't create the prophet told us
[1:30:29] can I get a
[1:30:31] witness amen and he
[1:30:35] fell because of this position he he lost
[1:30:40] his first estate and any man I don't
[1:30:43] care who you are when something that
[1:30:46] you've never had before now is in your
[1:30:49] hands it's a Temptation now if you you
[1:30:53] know we at 10,000
[1:30:54] and now you get 50,000 there's another
[1:30:57] test comes with that you win the lottery
[1:31:00] another test comes with that you start a
[1:31:02] business and God starts to bless it a
[1:31:04] test comes with that you start preaching
[1:31:06] the word and the Lord begins to bless
[1:31:08] you a test comes with that you start a
[1:31:10] little church you have four or five
[1:31:12] families and more families come a test
[1:31:15] comes with that and there is a place
[1:31:17] that the believer must stay and must
[1:31:20] know that there is a real devil that
[1:31:23] actually will come to you in your
[1:31:26] studying while you're studying the word
[1:31:29] to sway you into a Direction so he can
[1:31:32] influence the entire group of people
[1:31:35] that you're preaching to but I'm so glad
[1:31:38] there's a message of the hour that I can
[1:31:41] hear that's pure that's clean that is my
[1:31:46] example that will keep me on the firing
[1:31:49] line keep my mind focused where it needs
[1:31:53] to be not over fame not over popularity
[1:31:56] but staying with the word god amen
[1:31:59] hallelujah praise the
[1:32:02] Lord
[1:32:04] amen the scriptures go on in Isaiah I'm
[1:32:07] just going to show him paint this
[1:32:09] picture of this being just for a moment
[1:32:11] Isaiah 14:12 says how thou fallen from
[1:32:14] Heaven oh Lucifer son of the
[1:32:17] morning how are th cut down to the
[1:32:19] ground which did weaken and na let me
[1:32:22] stop here just for a moment
[1:32:24] you know every time I go to
[1:32:28] witness Satan always gets
[1:32:31] upset it's like like if I could preach
[1:32:34] to you all for a week and you know I
[1:32:36] have my everyday battles but soon as I
[1:32:39] make the effort to go tell somebody
[1:32:43] who's never heard before Satan's on the
[1:32:46] track all the time I've noticed that
[1:32:49] it's not bad luck it's the devil he
[1:32:54] wants me to confine my little time my
[1:32:57] little Ministry to preaching to Y all
[1:32:59] all day preaching to the choir but to go
[1:33:02] tell the man on the street who never
[1:33:05] heard to leave from 21102 East Broadway
[1:33:09] and go tell somebody
[1:33:11] downtown that Jesus can save them and
[1:33:15] deliver them oh it moves our comfort
[1:33:18] zone CU we don't that's that's another
[1:33:20] level it's like we don't know what's
[1:33:22] going to happen they're going to reject
[1:33:23] us it's not going to like us they
[1:33:25] already don't like
[1:33:27] you so get over it amen Isaiah 14:12
[1:33:32] says how art thou fallen from Heaven oh
[1:33:35] Lucifer son of the morning how art thou
[1:33:38] cut down to the ground which did weaken
[1:33:40] the Nations for thou H has said in thine
[1:33:43] heart I will Ascend into heaven I will
[1:33:47] exalt my throne above the stars of God I
[1:33:51] will sit also upon the mount of the
[1:33:55] congregation in the sides of the north I
[1:33:57] will Ascend above the heights of the
[1:33:59] cloud I will be like the most high yet
[1:34:04] Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to
[1:34:06] the sides of the pit they that see thee
[1:34:08] so narrowly look upon thee and consider
[1:34:11] thee saying is this the man that made
[1:34:13] Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms
[1:34:17] that made the world as a Wilderness and
[1:34:19] destroyed the cities thereof that open
[1:34:21] not the house of the prisoners and all
[1:34:24] the kings of the Nations even all of
[1:34:26] them lie in glory e everyone in his own
[1:34:29] house but thou are cast out of thy grave
[1:34:32] like an abominable branch and as a
[1:34:35] reignment of those that are slain so the
[1:34:37] Bible is just giving some
[1:34:40] descriptions of this being Lucifer or
[1:34:45] Satan you call him the Devil he's known
[1:34:49] as the tempter he has many he's an
[1:34:52] accuser and he has many devices and
[1:34:56] power so this is prophetic These Old
[1:34:59] Testament prophets are catching in the
[1:35:01] spirit one is talking to a King and
[1:35:05] brother bandam says this King was not in
[1:35:07] Eden but he was talking about the spirit
[1:35:10] in this King was the spirit of Satan and
[1:35:13] when and when when the prophet saw him
[1:35:16] he says Thou Sealth up the sum of wisdom
[1:35:19] you were in Eden the Garden of God
[1:35:22] identifying that spirit and we'll see
[1:35:25] how he moves just a little bit in 1
[1:35:28] Chronicles 21 God's Own handpick King
[1:35:32] King David the Bible says in verse
[1:35:36] number one and Satan stood up against
[1:35:38] Israel and provoked David to number the
[1:35:43] people to number Israel who did that who
[1:35:46] tempted him to do that
[1:35:49] uhhuh job 1 and6 says this there was
[1:35:53] today when the sons of God came to
[1:35:55] present themselves before the Lord and
[1:35:57] who was there too huh say all that's
[1:36:01] right I ask you guys not to help me
[1:36:03] preach that's okay there was a day when
[1:36:07] the sons of God came to present
[1:36:08] themselves before the Lord and Satan
[1:36:10] came also among Satan what you comeing
[1:36:14] to church
[1:36:15] for huh why are you coming when the sons
[1:36:19] are
[1:36:20] coming he's got something in his plan
[1:36:24] something on his heart something in his
[1:36:27] scheme Satan's chance for Redemption is
[1:36:31] over Satan is not interested in hearing
[1:36:34] the word of the Lord Satan don't care
[1:36:37] one bit about what quote you just read
[1:36:40] or what's in your Bible that you
[1:36:43] highlighted all he's concerned about is
[1:36:47] trying to get you to stumble to fall to
[1:36:51] hinder
[1:36:52] you and we got to know he's these
[1:36:55] devices is that he has Psalms 1096 says
[1:37:00] set thou a wicked man over him and let
[1:37:02] Satan St Satan stand at his right hand
[1:37:04] Zechariah 3
[1:37:07] 1-2 look at this he showed me Joshua the
[1:37:11] high priest standing before the angel of
[1:37:13] the Lord and Satan
[1:37:16] standing at his right hand to resist him
[1:37:21] and the Lord said unto Satan the Lord
[1:37:24] rebuke theee hallelujah oh Satan even
[1:37:27] the Lord that have chosen Jerusalem
[1:37:31] rebuke thee is no it's not it's not me I
[1:37:34] rebuke you Satan it's the Lord rebuke
[1:37:38] you even over the body of Moses Satan
[1:37:41] didn't bring a railing accusation but he
[1:37:44] just said the Lord rebuke you you think
[1:37:47] you got power to go toe to- Toe with the
[1:37:49] devil joke about him talk to him in his
[1:37:52] face you have no power except God give
[1:37:55] you the power that's why you got to stay
[1:37:58] with the word because the word has the
[1:38:01] authority over every evil power outside
[1:38:04] of the word you have no power you will
[1:38:07] fall you will lust you will commit the
[1:38:10] thing that you said you would never do
[1:38:13] if you walk out from beside that
[1:38:16] word greater Ministries than you
[1:38:19] failed greater men than you failed men
[1:38:23] that it all failed how did they fall
[1:38:27] Satan came to them gave them a
[1:38:29] proposition worked on them worked on
[1:38:32] them worked on them worked on them and
[1:38:34] then they cracked soon as a little crack
[1:38:36] happens work on it work on it he's got
[1:38:38] time he'll wait for you he's following
[1:38:42] you and studying everything that you do
[1:38:45] waiting for an opportunity to slip his
[1:38:48] fangs into
[1:38:49] you
[1:38:51] yes I'm talking to church church people
[1:38:53] this
[1:38:54] morning I'm looking around who who the
[1:38:57] brother preaching I'm preaching about
[1:38:58] everybody here Satan is an enemy to
[1:39:02] every one of us here and if I fail to
[1:39:06] pray and keep this armor on me I will
[1:39:11] fall the church will fail your ministry
[1:39:14] will fail your abilities will
[1:39:18] fail Glory if we don't take on the whole
[1:39:21] armor of God J
[1:39:25] amen
[1:39:28] yes look how he
[1:39:33] came in Matthew
[1:39:35] 16 it's also found in Mark chapter 8:33
[1:39:39] can I take 20 more
[1:39:45] minutes the Bible says from that time
[1:39:47] forth Jesus began Jesus to show unto his
[1:39:52] disciples how that he must go to
[1:39:54] Jerusalem and suffer many things of the
[1:39:57] elders and of Chief priests and scribes
[1:40:00] and be killed and be raised again the
[1:40:02] third day and look at this look at his
[1:40:04] faithful servant Peter handpicked then
[1:40:07] Peter took him and begin to do what to
[1:40:11] him you got the
[1:40:14] nerve to
[1:40:16] rebuke your pastor I mean
[1:40:19] rebuke rebuke the Lord Jesus
[1:40:24] huh he rebuked
[1:40:27] him and look what he says and begin to
[1:40:31] rebuke him saying be it far from thee
[1:40:34] Lord this shall not be unto thee but he
[1:40:38] turned and said unto Peter get thee
[1:40:40] behind me Satan Thou Art an offense unto
[1:40:44] me for thou savest not the things that
[1:40:47] be of God but those that be of men now
[1:40:50] if you follow Peter in his life Peter
[1:40:54] was an anointed brother he's kind of
[1:40:56] quick on the trigger he's cutting folks
[1:40:59] ears off for the
[1:41:01] Lord he could get in a fight he'll scrap
[1:41:03] with you no problem he was the disciple
[1:41:05] he had his temperament and the Lord
[1:41:07] loved Peter and the Lord called Peter
[1:41:11] and when it was time for the church to
[1:41:12] get a revelation he used Peter to get a
[1:41:15] revelation that thou art the Christ the
[1:41:19] son of the Living God says where could
[1:41:21] we go we wouldn't go nowhere and in a
[1:41:24] few moments later he's now rebuking the
[1:41:27] Lord and Jesus turned and looked at him
[1:41:30] and says Satan I rebuke you
[1:41:35] now this kind of shows this
[1:41:40] nature he said Satan get thee behind me
[1:41:44] thou art an offense to me brother bner
[1:41:46] shows us that he loved the Apostle but
[1:41:50] now the spirit that was on the Apostle
[1:41:52] it was Satan using him see how quickly
[1:41:56] he just ease right into there and cause
[1:41:59] him to say things that was contrary take
[1:42:02] another one here Mark chap 3: 23 says
[1:42:06] and he called unto him and said unto
[1:42:08] them in
[1:42:09] Parables how can Satan cast out Satan
[1:42:13] and if the kingdom be divided against
[1:42:14] itself that Kingdom cannot stand and if
[1:42:17] a house be divided against itself that
[1:42:20] house cannot stand and if Satan rise up
[1:42:23] against himself and be divided he cannot
[1:42:27] stand but ha an end showing a little
[1:42:31] more insight into Satan's schemes his
[1:42:35] abilities he's got a he's got a program
[1:42:38] he's got hierarchy he's got Angels he's
[1:42:41] got demons he got people that work for
[1:42:44] him there's people that are literally on
[1:42:47] his side and he uses them and he'll get
[1:42:51] those people to get attached with you
[1:42:53] and you start getting mad at people mad
[1:42:56] at because he you know I know why he
[1:42:57] don't like me you know it's Satan that's
[1:43:00] after you my brother my sister this is
[1:43:02] not flesh and blood this is Satan trying
[1:43:06] to destroy you destroy your
[1:43:09] influence destroy your your your your
[1:43:13] your
[1:43:15] future and so Jesus identified this
[1:43:18] let's take this in Luke chapter 4 this
[1:43:21] is powerful here Satan comes to Jesus
[1:43:25] verse one Jesus being full of the Holy
[1:43:27] Ghost he returned from Jordan and was
[1:43:30] led by the spirit Into the Wilderness
[1:43:33] being 40 days tempted of the devil and
[1:43:36] in those days he did eat nothing and
[1:43:39] when it ended he afterward
[1:43:41] hungered and the devil said unto him if
[1:43:44] thou be the Son of God command this
[1:43:47] stone that it be made bread Jesus
[1:43:50] answered him saying it is written that
[1:43:53] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:43:55] every word of God and the devil taking
[1:43:58] him up into a high M high mountain who
[1:44:00] took him up the devil took him up into a
[1:44:03] high mountain showed unto him all the
[1:44:06] kingdoms of the world in a moment of
[1:44:11] time and the devil said unto him look at
[1:44:15] this all this power will I give thee and
[1:44:19] the glory of them for that is delivered
[1:44:22] un to me and to whomsoever I will
[1:44:30] what I will give this is Satan talking
[1:44:33] to Jesus Jesus never said that ain't
[1:44:36] true he listened right to him Sat said I
[1:44:38] got the power to all the glories of the
[1:44:41] G all the glory of the Earth all of the
[1:44:44] kingdoms of the world all of the Power
[1:44:46] I'll give it to you if you just Bow Down
[1:44:49] and Worship me for it's been given to me
[1:44:53] to give it to anybody that I want to I
[1:44:57] can't think of the great rapper one of
[1:44:58] them
[1:44:59] rappers
[1:45:01] um some of y'all wouldn't know if I
[1:45:03] called it anyways but he said Satan came
[1:45:06] to him three times DMX I think you
[1:45:09] remember that you ever heard that
[1:45:10] interiew he said Satan he was a gifted
[1:45:12] and talented man his be ability to
[1:45:16] recall in rap music now and just on the
[1:45:19] Fly be able to hold paragraphs and S a
[1:45:23] whole song by memory and just the
[1:45:25] ability that he had couldn't God use
[1:45:29] that in the
[1:45:30] Pulpit that gift that talent to to
[1:45:33] retain he said in an own interview he
[1:45:35] said that Satan came to him and offered
[1:45:41] gifts and talents to
[1:45:43] him obviously he was dealing with some
[1:45:46] spiritual battles there he wrapped about
[1:45:48] it he asked God to help him he told God
[1:45:50] to show him a sign and some of his rap
[1:45:53] music showing that Satan comes to people
[1:45:58] and he comes to them with gifts and
[1:46:00] powers and
[1:46:03] opportunities oh I wish the church was
[1:46:06] praying this morning I wish the real
[1:46:09] reality of what we're dealing with it
[1:46:11] would it would re it would change the
[1:46:14] way you repent and you come to the house
[1:46:17] of the Lord it would change your motive
[1:46:21] and your objectives to the hour that you
[1:46:24] live in we're all dead men and I'm
[1:46:27] crying out judgment is coming it's
[1:46:30] already
[1:46:32] here and God has a purpose for us and so
[1:46:36] does Satan want to hinder that purpose
[1:46:39] so here he is in discourse with Jesus he
[1:46:42] has the power now
[1:46:46] to give it to whoever he wants to is
[1:46:49] that right Saints huh
[1:46:54] look at Luke chapter 10 the scripture
[1:46:57] says this verses
[1:47:00] 1-3 after these things the Lord
[1:47:02] appointed other 70 also and sent them
[1:47:05] two and two before his face in every
[1:47:07] city and place whether he himself would
[1:47:10] come therefore said he unto them the
[1:47:13] Harvest truly is great but the laborers
[1:47:15] are few pray ye therefore the lord of
[1:47:18] the Harvest that he would send forth
[1:47:22] what labor
[1:47:25] laborers into his Harvest go your way
[1:47:28] behold I send you forth as Lambs as
[1:47:31] Lambs Among Wolves he that heareth you
[1:47:33] heareth me he that despiseth you
[1:47:35] despiseth me he that despiseth me
[1:47:38] despises him that sent me and the 70
[1:47:41] returned again with Joy saying Lord even
[1:47:44] the devils are subject unto us through
[1:47:48] what not through our church not through
[1:47:52] our abill ities but even the devils are
[1:47:55] subject unto us through thy name St Luke
[1:47:59] chap 10: 1 through3 and verses 16- 20
[1:48:05] that they recognize that the devil was
[1:48:10] subject unto him to them through his
[1:48:16] name there's no name like that
[1:48:19] name demons tremble at the sound of that
[1:48:22] that name and in that name if you can't
[1:48:26] do it then don't do it at all if you
[1:48:29] can't do it in Jesus name but when you
[1:48:32] come in jesus' name pray in jesus' name
[1:48:36] study and preach in jesus' name there is
[1:48:40] no devil that can stand before the
[1:48:43] elected God gave us the power to
[1:48:47] overcome through his name
[1:48:53] behold I give you power to tread on
[1:48:56] serpents scorpions and over all the
[1:49:00] power of the enemy and nothing should by
[1:49:03] any means hurt
[1:49:05] you notwithstanding in this Rejoice not
[1:49:09] that the spirits are subject unto you
[1:49:11] but rather Rejoice because your names
[1:49:13] are written in heaven that's something
[1:49:16] to be happy
[1:49:18] about
[1:49:19] yes oh yes
[1:49:23] also many other scriptures Luke Chapter
[1:49:26] 13 Luke
[1:49:28] 22 uh the disciples are arguing who's
[1:49:31] going to be next who's going to be in
[1:49:33] charge next and Jesus deals with
[1:49:36] that John
[1:49:38] 1327 Satan enters Into the Heart of of
[1:49:42] of of of um Judas thank
[1:49:47] you and he goes and does what he does
[1:49:50] first he's playing a game with the money
[1:49:52] CU he was a trustee he worked with Jesus
[1:49:55] he saw Jesus wasn't a hypocrite he knew
[1:49:58] Jesus ministry was true but why did
[1:50:00] Judas betray our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:50:04] the only thing that was pure and clean
[1:50:07] amongst the leadership was Jesus that
[1:50:09] had the authority Judas saw it all Judas
[1:50:13] was a part of the ministry what entered
[1:50:15] into him to cause him to go this way he
[1:50:19] was woed he was groomed
[1:50:23] and then finally he made that final step
[1:50:26] and Satan entered into his heart how
[1:50:29] does Satan groom you how would he be
[1:50:32] working on
[1:50:33] you your next
[1:50:36] scheme your next whatever you trying to
[1:50:39] do you know Satan is a mastermind Saints
[1:50:43] he's not nothing to play with if you're
[1:50:46] not in this world day and night you know
[1:50:48] what you just need to stop playing
[1:50:50] Church stop playing because Satan is
[1:50:53] watching your halfway lifestyle and the
[1:50:56] prophet preach it on tape it's in your
[1:50:58] Bible maybe you come up in Sunday school
[1:51:00] maybe you was raised in it and still
[1:51:02] going to go
[1:51:04] halfway oh God have mercy upon me God
[1:51:08] have mercy upon
[1:51:10] us the brother brought some statistics
[1:51:13] here and I had read them before myself
[1:51:15] but he was talking about how a person
[1:51:17] reading the Bible once a week it it it
[1:51:21] really it's like you didn't nothing it
[1:51:23] doesn't move anything there's no
[1:51:25] meaningful change in your life then
[1:51:27] after you go two two or three times a
[1:51:30] week it just moves a little bit more
[1:51:33] that the impact of reading the word of
[1:51:35] the Lord and then after that you know
[1:51:38] it's just unlimited the effects that the
[1:51:41] word of God has upon you just by picking
[1:51:45] it up and reading it it influences you
[1:51:49] just like many of you are influenced by
[1:51:51] Fox News
[1:51:53] news that's why you can argue politics
[1:51:56] all the time because that's what you was
[1:51:59] listening to why don't you put it down
[1:52:02] and pick up your Bible and read it read
[1:52:06] it till it makes you cry read it till
[1:52:09] you feel it in your bones read it until
[1:52:12] it changes your mind read the word of
[1:52:16] God
[1:52:18] daily take one page one chapter and read
[1:52:21] it it will begin to help you it will yes
[1:52:26] it will and so we see this Satan has
[1:52:29] this ability to
[1:52:31] influence influence David he come in the
[1:52:33] congregation with job job's going to to
[1:52:36] meet the Lord the sons of God to go to
[1:52:38] meet the Lord and Satan is right there
[1:52:40] with him too 2 Corinthians chapter 2 we
[1:52:42] read this let's read it one more time
[1:52:44] verse number
[1:52:45] nine for the this end also did I write
[1:52:49] that I may know the proof of you whether
[1:52:52] you be obedient in all things to whom
[1:52:55] you forgive anything I forgive also so
[1:52:59] if you forgive him I forgive him also
[1:53:01] for if I forgive anything to whom I
[1:53:04] forgive it for your sakes forgive I it
[1:53:08] in the person of
[1:53:10] Christ lest or so that Satan should get
[1:53:14] an advantage of us for we are not
[1:53:18] ignorant of his devices amen you know
[1:53:22] Satan got some
[1:53:25] devices let me read this other
[1:53:27] translation same verse same scripture
[1:53:29] there maybe it'll help you a little bit
[1:53:31] anyone you forgive I also forgive and
[1:53:34] what I have forgiven if there was
[1:53:36] anything to forgive I have forgiven in
[1:53:38] the sight of Christ for your sake in
[1:53:41] order that Satan might not out witht
[1:53:45] us for we are not aware unaware of his
[1:53:51] schemes amen it's a mind game
[1:53:56] Church your mind in the mind of Christ
[1:54:01] against Satan in his mind you
[1:54:04] know he's trying to out scheme
[1:54:08] you so I'm going to go serve the Lord
[1:54:11] and so I'm goingon to make this
[1:54:12] commitment I'll start praying on
[1:54:13] Wednesday night I used to didn't come
[1:54:16] I'mma start coming now oh Satan's gonna
[1:54:18] out scheme
[1:54:19] you like give him another job
[1:54:25] cause something to go bad in the home
[1:54:26] you got to do this and do that wrap his
[1:54:29] time he's trying to out it's a mind game
[1:54:32] but once you know the word of the Lord
[1:54:34] that you're supposed to be in the house
[1:54:36] of the Lord then you know anything
[1:54:37] that's coming against that is
[1:54:40] what
[1:54:42] yeah that's right you fill in the blank
[1:54:45] all
[1:54:47] right that Satan might not out witht us
[1:54:50] for we are not unaware of his
[1:54:52] devices 2 Corinthians chapter 12 verse
[1:54:56] verse number seven I knew we wasn't
[1:54:58] going to dance this morning that's all
[1:54:59] right I knew it wasn't going to be one
[1:55:01] of those high five run up and down the a
[1:55:03] but I'm I'm preaching what's on my heart
[1:55:05] okay what the Lord put on my heart in
[1:55:07] this great tremendous warning you heard
[1:55:09] it before I know that and that's
[1:55:12] probably part of the
[1:55:13] problem you underestimate his power and
[1:55:17] I'm going to get into those quotes in
[1:55:18] just a minute
[1:55:21] [Music]
[1:55:23] if if Satan can get a hold of a leader
[1:55:26] oh how many people he can damage brother
[1:55:29] George if he can influence the mind of a
[1:55:33] leader a gift or a Talent somebody that
[1:55:37] can speak somebody that's connected oh
[1:55:39] what kind of damage can he
[1:55:43] do and this is why we are not ignorant
[1:55:46] of his devices 2 Corinthians chapter 12
[1:55:49] says this unless I should be exalted
[1:55:52] above measure through the abundance of
[1:55:54] Revelations there was given to me a
[1:55:58] thorn in the flesh the messenger of who
[1:56:03] of Satan to do what to Buffet me Les I
[1:56:08] should be exalted above measure
[1:56:11] interesting scripture isn't it think of
[1:56:14] that the Lord blessed me so
[1:56:17] well that he had to let Satan send a
[1:56:20] messenger to keep me
[1:56:23] humble Paul wasn't an overnight believer
[1:56:25] Paul gave his life for this go the
[1:56:28] greatest one we've ever seen and God
[1:56:30] used him he raised the dead amongst him
[1:56:32] cast out Devils with him used him
[1:56:36] mightily and gave him some Revelations
[1:56:39] to tie in the Old Testament law and
[1:56:42] bring it under grace and truth into
[1:56:44] where we can clearly see even the Lord's
[1:56:46] Supper even all the mysteries of the Old
[1:56:49] Testament and even him he needed some
[1:56:54] kind of pain some kind of situation some
[1:56:57] kind of pressure to keep him humble and
[1:57:01] God allowed Satan to Buffet him is that
[1:57:04] your
[1:57:06] Bible
[1:57:08] yes he sought the Lord three times for
[1:57:11] the Lord to take it away the Lord said
[1:57:13] no my grace is sufficient for you Paul
[1:57:17] sa so we see this we also 1 Corinthians
[1:57:20] chapter 5 verses number five it talks
[1:57:23] about when the um the the a Believer
[1:57:27] goes off the rails and won't be
[1:57:29] corrected that you deliver such a one
[1:57:32] over to Satan that's what the Bible says
[1:57:35] deliver such a one over to Satan for the
[1:57:37] destruction of the flesh that his Spirit
[1:57:40] might be saved in the day of
[1:57:44] Jesus that's what the Bible says all
[1:57:48] right can I take one more 1
[1:57:50] Thessalonians chapter 2
[1:57:55] for those of you that need to get up and

[1:58:25] number 16 18 forbidding us to speak unto
[1:58:28] the Gentiles that they might be saved to
[1:58:30] fill up their sin always for the Wrath

[1:58:36] we Brethren being taken from you for a
[1:58:38] short time in in in presence not in
[1:58:42] heart endeavored the more abundantly to
[1:58:47] see your face with great desire

[1:58:52] you even I Paul once and again but Satan
[1:58:56] hindered
[1:58:57] us you know Satan has that ability to
[1:59:03] hinder the thing that you're trying to
[1:59:06] do that is good and you got to know that
[1:59:11] it's not just
[1:59:13] circumstance if you're trying to do
[1:59:15] something and it's related to the word
[1:59:18] of
[1:59:19] God and it's commissioning his word in
[1:59:21] the furtherment of his word and
[1:59:24] something is hindering that who is going
[1:59:26] to hinder the furtherment of the word
[1:59:29] you got to know that you think it's just
[1:59:33] coincidence you think I'm just in a bad
[1:59:35] mood a bad mood is a bad spirit that
[1:59:39] makes you feel that way and we all get
[1:59:42] it on us get aggravated get anointed and
[1:59:45] it gets on us get on us so we can say
[1:59:48] something that we shouldn't say blow up

[2:00:15] than your wife or your husband know he
[2:00:17] knows you probably better than you know
[2:00:21] yourself in many respects he holds the
[2:00:24] sum of wisdom he knows what a human
[2:00:27] being wants desires capable of
[2:00:30] weaknesses when he's tired he thinks
[2:00:32] like this when he's around the believer
[2:00:34] he thinks like this I know I can catch
[2:00:36] him on a Monday don't mess with him on
[2:00:38] Sunday but on Monday go see him that's
[2:00:42] Satan that's a
[2:00:46] mastermind go heads up with you on the
[2:00:48] while the Altar and the fire of God is
[2:00:50] going on he go get you after the service
[2:00:54] after you done made up your mind to do
[2:00:56] what's right he's after
[2:01:00] you that's the word of the Lord
[2:01:03] Saints we got to know
[2:01:06] that stop getting mad at people I'm
[2:01:09] going to take the next 10 or 15 minutes
[2:01:12] and deal with this just for a minute now
[2:01:15] this Ephesians
[2:01:16] six tells us to be what in the Lord
[2:01:21] strong strong in the Lord and in the
[2:01:25] power of His
[2:01:27] might and he tells us to put on the
[2:01:30] whole armor of God he tells us that
[2:01:34] twice to put the whole armor of God that
[2:01:38] you may be able to withstand in the evil
[2:01:42] day when is the evil day that's this day
[2:01:46] that's this last day second Timothy
[2:01:49] chapter 3 talks about this saying this
[2:01:52] know also that in the last days perilous
[2:01:56] times shall come for men shall be lovers
[2:01:59] of their own selves Covetous boers proud
[2:02:02] blasphemers he say lovers of money proud
[2:02:05] arrogant abusive disobedient to their
[2:02:08] parents ungrateful Unholy heartless one
[2:02:13] definition unpas slanderous without
[2:02:19] self-control brutal not love loving good
[2:02:23] just don't love anything that's
[2:02:26] good treacherous Reckless swollen with
[2:02:30] conceit just filled with conceit
[2:02:33] conceited through the music through the
[2:02:35] culture through the age that they're in
[2:02:37] the drug whatever the situation lovers
[2:02:40] of
[2:02:41] Pleasures rather than lovers of
[2:02:44] God having a form of godliness but
[2:02:47] denying the power thereof from such turn
[2:02:50] away for this is the the sword are they
[2:02:52] that which creep into houses and Lead
[2:02:55] captive silly women Laden with sins laid
[2:02:58] away with diverse lust ever learning
[2:03:01] never able to come to the knowledge of
[2:03:02] the truth never able to come to the
[2:03:04] knowledge of the truth now in Romans
[2:03:07] chapter one I want you to turn there
[2:03:09] quickly talks about this evil
[2:03:15] day and I want to deal with this verse
[2:03:17] 27 28 and 29 just for a minute
[2:03:22] and then share a few quotations with you
[2:03:24] how you should never
[2:03:28] underestimate Satan's
[2:03:30] power to deceive you or to influence you
[2:03:34] or to get you to think in a certain way
[2:03:37] you can you can't over you can't over
[2:03:41] underestimate it Romans 8 vers
[2:03:45] 18 verse verse number
[2:03:49] 208 says this says
[2:03:52] Romans sorry Romans chapter 1 verse
[2:03:55] number
[2:03:58] 28 it says this and even as they did not
[2:04:01] like to retain God in their knowledge
[2:04:04] God gave them over to a reprobate mind
[2:04:07] to do those things which are not
[2:04:11] convenient being filled with all
[2:04:16] unrighteousness now we're commanded to
[2:04:18] be filled with the Holy Ghost and just
[2:04:21] follow me just a little bit I want you
[2:04:23] appreciate how you're doing that sis in
[2:04:24] the back just follow it down I'm going
[2:04:26] to read uh a few definitions out of this
[2:04:29] furthermore they did not
[2:04:30] retain uh the knowledge of God so God
[2:04:33] gave them over to a depraved mind so
[2:04:36] that they do what uh that they do what
[2:04:40] ought not to be done they have been
[2:04:43] become filled with every kind of
[2:04:46] wickedness evil greed depravity
[2:04:52] they're full of Envy murder Strife
[2:04:54] deceit and
[2:04:56] Malice slanderous God haters arrogant
[2:05:01] boastful they invent ways of doing evil
[2:05:05] they disobey their parents they have no
[2:05:08] understanding no Fidelity No Love No
[2:05:11] Mercy although they know God's righteous
[2:05:14] decree that those who do these things
[2:05:18] deserve death not only do they the same
[2:05:21] but have pleasure and them that do them
[2:05:24] so this is talking about that evil day
[2:05:26] that evil day is here this is where this
[2:05:29] is where this is what you run into and
[2:05:31] on streets this is what serving your
[2:05:33] food in the restaurant this is when
[2:05:36] you're going to do any kind of service
[2:05:37] in public this is what's driving around
[2:05:39] in
[2:05:40] traffic God gave them over to a
[2:05:43] reprobate
[2:05:44] mind and this is the evil
[2:05:48] day that the scriptures talk of
[2:05:53] but it tells us to Stand
[2:05:55] Fast put on the whole armor of
[2:06:00] God what is the whole armor of God
[2:06:04] Saints it's the word of God it's all of

[2:06:10] salvation it's the breastplate of
[2:06:13] righteousness Ephesians chapter 6 it's
[2:06:16] the belt of
[2:06:18] truth it's the shield he says above all
[2:06:21] take The Shield of Faith that's your
[2:06:24] Shield to quench all the fiery darts of
[2:06:28] the devil you mean the devil's throwing
[2:06:30] darts at

[2:06:51] anoint in whatever good God try to
[2:06:54] instill in you Satan is there to throw a
[2:06:57] fiery Dart this is why you got to have
[2:06:59] the whole armor of God got to have all
[2:07:01] of
[2:07:03] it it's not something you do on the side
[2:07:07] this is not a part-time
[2:07:09] position this is a
[2:07:12] soldier in the army of the Lord he wake
[2:07:16] up 2 o'clock in the morning and the
[2:07:18] devil is after him already up
[2:07:23] and you trying to do what's right and

[2:07:48] prayerfully you take this weaponry and
[2:07:51] you dress yourself for a true child of
[2:07:55] God ready for the battle because the
[2:07:58] your enemy The Devil is after you sis
[2:08:00] after your
[2:08:07] brother but greater is he that is in
[2:08:10] us huh than he that is in the
[2:08:14] world now what did he give us his armor
[2:08:17] for so we're constantly defending oursel
[2:08:20] you know the you know in football say
[2:08:22] the greatest defense is a tremendous
[2:08:26] offense it's the ability to fight and
[2:08:30] and brother Caleb in one of the
[2:08:31] ministers meeting he he gave this uh
[2:08:34] five-fold Ministry and he talked about
[2:08:36] how brother brandom had it shared with
[2:08:38] brother Perry green what the each finger
[2:08:41] was he said this pointer was the I think
[2:08:43] the
[2:08:44] Apostle or no maybe it's this one here
[2:08:48] I'm GNA mess it up
[2:08:49] now but each of these are something this
[2:08:52] is the Evangelist here um this pointer
[2:08:55] was the prophet this one right here this
[2:08:58] ring this the longest one is the Apostle
[2:09:00] it goes first and this is the teacher
[2:09:02] here the ring finger and then you close
[2:09:05] it up it is wrapped together with the
[2:09:07] thumb which is the pastor that holds it
[2:09:09] all together and he says and then you
[2:09:12] use that to hit the
[2:09:14] devil and if you're really skilled you
[2:09:16] can give him a double
[2:09:17] portion and then one brother said this
[2:09:19] is where the scripture applies this
[2:09:21] better to give than to
[2:09:24] receive yeah it's better to give than to
[2:09:28] [Music]
[2:09:30] receive and so when we're in the army of
[2:09:32] the Lord we're not just running from the
[2:09:35] devil cuz we're in the evil day no he

[2:10:40] nice clean neighborhood where ain't no
[2:10:42] problems in it no the neighborhood that
[2:10:44] got the problems that's the one that

[2:11:29] the victory man he gave you the power
[2:11:32] over sin he gave you the power over the
[2:11:34] demons that had you bound but I'm so

[2:12:05] perfect
[2:12:07] atmosphere now I realize everybody can't
[2:12:09] go but everybody should be praying for
[2:12:11] somebody else to
[2:12:16] go and that is the
[2:12:18] truth cuz we don't wrestle against Prin
[2:12:21] principalities and Powers we wrestle
[2:12:24] against the rulers of
[2:12:28] Darkness the rulers of darkness and so
[2:12:33] you need this equipment to be able to
[2:12:36] stand and that is the word of God we
[2:12:40] don't wrestle against flesh and
[2:12:42] blood but we wrestle against
[2:12:44] principalities and power let me take two
[2:12:48] quotes for you I'm sorry I ran out of my
[2:12:50] time here but in the message
[2:12:55] 1962 paragraph number
[2:12:58] 40 uh uh take on the whole armor of God
[2:13:02] paragraph number
[2:13:05] 40 July 1
[2:13:09] 1962 the prophet of God says this
[2:13:15] here they're definitely going to have to
[2:13:17] help me with this thank you
[2:13:22] let's read now the scripture 6th chapter
[2:13:25] verse 10 verse finally Brethren be
[2:13:27] strong in the Lord and power of His
[2:13:28] might quoted on the whole armor of God
[2:13:30] that ye may be able to stand against the
[2:13:32] Ws of the devil for we wrestle not
[2:13:34] against flesh and blood but against
[2:13:36] principalities against Powers against
[2:13:39] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[2:13:41] against spiritual wickedness in high
[2:13:43] places wherefore take unto you the whole
[2:13:46] armor of God skip down just a little bit
[2:13:51] the army of the United States did
[2:13:53] receive me because I suppose there were
[2:13:56] men more eligible but I'm glad that I
[2:13:58] got enlisted in the army of the Lord and
[2:14:01] he gave me a
[2:14:03] uniform Paul is speaking is talking
[2:14:06] about preparing a soldier for battle the
[2:14:10] gospel has many lessons you can like it
[2:14:13] onto one thing or another and Paul
[2:14:15] speaks of it as a runner Hebrews 12
[2:14:18] seeing that we're compassed about with
[2:14:19] such a great cloud of witnesses let us
[2:14:21] lay aside every weight and the sin thus
[2:14:24] easily beset us he's speaking there of
[2:14:27] Olympics perhaps the Roman circuits and
[2:14:29] so now he's speaking of armored men
[2:14:31] going into battle and how he's got to
[2:14:34] prepare
[2:14:36] himself and I was thinking this
[2:14:38] afternoon being that we're closing out
[2:14:40] here in the Armory today that I would
[2:14:42] take for text to take on the whole armor
[2:14:44] of God be
[2:14:47] equipped be ready because we wrestle so
[2:14:51] not against flesh and blood but against
[2:14:54] Satan God's enemy
[2:14:57] principalities and wickedness and evil
[2:15:01] spirits wickedness in high places and
[2:15:04] we're pressing towards the mark of the
[2:15:07] high calling and we are certainly in a
[2:15:14] battle amen we're certainly in the
[2:15:17] battle let's take one more in in the
[2:15:20] message the
[2:15:21] contest paragraph number
[2:15:24] 15
[2:15:27] 1962 December the 3D 1962 paragraph
[2:15:30] number 15 the prophet of God says this
[2:15:34] here oh
[2:15:49] my I find here
[2:16:03] quickly the contest paragraph number 15
[2:16:07] now the enemy is going to study the our
[2:16:11] strategy with the word and now Satan
[2:16:14] studied that all out so perfectly till
[2:16:18] will he come till when he comes come to
[2:16:21] Eve he had the best
[2:16:24] strategy he could use upon her and that
[2:16:27] was to reason with the
[2:16:30] word now you never want to reason with
[2:16:35] God's word just believe it don't try to
[2:16:39] explain it don't try to figure it out
[2:16:42] now you cannot figure out God so God is
[2:16:45] the word and it's just made to believe
[2:16:49] and that's our strength
[2:16:51] just accept the word and anyone knows
[2:16:54] that a seed in the right kind of ground
[2:16:56] will produce its kind and we just take
[2:17:01] the
[2:17:02] word
[2:17:04] amen I got to take one more 1963 this
[2:17:07] will be my last one paragraph
[2:17:16] 121 1963 January 14th
[2:17:25] this is the message trumpet gives an
[2:17:27] uncertain sound paragraph 121 now the
[2:17:32] enemy spy Satan triy to find out
[2:17:39] what could he do to break into that so
[2:17:42] he knowed he just couldn't come out and
[2:17:44] Bluff her so the only thing that he
[2:17:46] could do was to get her on reasoning and
[2:17:50] that's what God uses today to fortify
[2:17:53] his church is his word and Satan comes
[2:17:57] around with reasoning power Satan knowed
[2:18:01] that was the loophole that was the place
[2:18:03] that people would break the
[2:18:07] easiest was at
[2:18:11] reasoning now you see how that whole man
[2:18:15] he's got to have all of those channels
[2:18:17] filtered and cleaned out through the
[2:18:19] word of God God's word has a power and
[2:18:21] has everything you need to overcome in
[2:18:24] such a wicked and dark hour without his
[2:18:26] word you're going to fall you'll be
[2:18:27] caught up you'll be in some foolishness
[2:18:29] and nonsense for hours and years and
[2:18:32] years of your life wasting your time
[2:18:33] until you come back to the word the word
[2:18:35] of the hour and then you'll have good
[2:18:39] success and you will overcome the powers
[2:18:43] of the devil God bless you let's pray
[2:18:46] Lord Jesus we thank you for your word
[2:18:49] this morning
[2:18:51] we thank you for the saints that

[2:19:19] never lost a battle and you never had to
[2:19:22] back up on anything you said in your
[2:19:24] word so we don't have to back up either
[2:19:27] we take a stand for your word Lord we
