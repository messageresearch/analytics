[37:34] Glory thank you for
[37:36] everything we commit out to your hands
[37:38] tonight in Jesus Christ name we pray
[37:43] amen God bless
[37:45] you you may be seated
[37:48] for few minutes um in fact let us stand
[37:52] and read the scripture we get that out
[37:54] of the way and then uh okay let's read
[37:57] our scriptures tonight um sorry um the
[38:02] first scripture we are going to read is
[38:05] habac habakuk
[38:07] habak 2 we start from verse
[38:15] one
[38:19] habac
[38:21] 2 and we start from verse
[38:26] one I will stand upon my
[38:28] watch and set me upon the tower and will
[38:32] watch to see what he will say unto me
[38:35] and what I shall answer when I am
[38:40] reproved and the Lord answered me and
[38:44] said write the vision and make it PL
[38:47] upon tables that he may run that R now
[38:51] let me stop
[38:53] here um it's kind of a little bit hard
[38:56] to understand what is says here in verse
[38:58] two so I'll read you from the Hebrew
[38:59] Bible the Hebrew Bible says that to
[39:03] write the vision PL that he who comes
[39:06] can stand it h h h um can understand it
[39:11] quickly to make it plain all right but
[39:14] he say here he will run he that read it
[39:17] may run but it says that when you come
[39:20] you can understand
[39:22] it fast amen all right behold
[39:28] no three for the vision is yet for an
[39:32] appointed time but at the end he shall
[39:36] speak and not lie though it t wait for
[39:40] it because it will surely come it will
[39:44] not t now I would like you to pay all
[39:46] your attention on verse four behold his
[39:50] soul which is lifted up is not upright
[39:54] in him but the just shall live by his
[39:59] faith now we are accustomed to saying
[40:02] the J shall live by faith but what type
[40:04] of Faith you can you can hide yourself
[40:06] in the faith of the church you can hide
[40:09] yourself in the faith of your parent but
[40:12] here what is saying the just shall live
[40:16] by his faith and that's what we're going
[40:18] to be talking tonight uh Joshua let's
[40:21] read the book of Joshua

[44:46] went to Israel when I'm reading the
[44:50] Bible I can I place myself I see myself
[44:53] in the story when a story is being told
[44:57] and you can place yourself in the story
[44:59] then what happen is that the story
[45:02] becomes aive to you and you become a
[45:05] life to the story you feel like you are
[45:07] part of it is not a
[45:09] history or some record that is been read
[45:12] to you amen so we've heard so many about
[45:16] the Sabino Canyon about the sword
[45:19] Eagle uh rock and all that but going
[45:23] there now when I'm listening now to the
[45:25] message with that I'll be looking I say
[45:28] that's right I I can picture myself
[45:31] standing there experiencing what the
[45:35] prophet is experiencing
[45:38] amen amen and I'm sure my wife will feel
[45:41] the same and brother isra you know I
[45:44] told him if I call him don't think that
[45:47] I'm making name funny I'm so used to
[45:49] pronouncing the word Israel in Hebrew so
[45:53] that when I said it Israel people he
[45:56] didn't say right that that I told him
[45:59] you know to forgive him Advance I'm so
[46:01] used to I have to think to not say to
[46:03] say that way America I mean the in
[46:05] English way so brother Israel I uh thank
[46:08] you for your confidence for the
[46:09] confidence you have in inviting me to
[46:12] speak in your ppit and I pray that the
[46:15] Lord Jesus Christ help me to not betray
[46:18] that trust uh you know pastors are
[46:20] Shepherds that God appoint to watch over
[46:23] his
[46:24] children and as Shepherd a Shepherd they
[46:28] stay at the door all right and why are
[46:30] they at the door they at the door the
[46:33] entrance to a ship fold and they make
[46:35] sure that only sheep
[46:37] food enters to feed the flock nothing
[46:42] else I don't care who that person is I
[46:45] don't care what reputation you have you
[46:47] only bring in sheep
[46:49] food amen so tonight my main objective
[46:55] is to bring in sheep food with spiritual
[46:59] vitamins uh and say something that will
[47:01] draw you closer to the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:04] and strengthen your faith in him amen I
[47:08] want to share a few things with you to
[47:10] encourage you in your Christian
[47:12] Journey now the Christian journey is a
[47:15] journey of
[47:16] love it's a Journey of
[47:19] Faith a journey of Friendship with God
[47:23] Amen and that's the journey that our
[47:26] father AB abam had that they call him
[47:28] the friend of
[47:29] God and uh uh I I I'll jump a little bit
[47:33] ahead on my Note here and we are all
[47:35] here tonight Abraham Royal
[47:38] seed and you
[47:40] know I'm already getting ahead of myself
[47:42] here I know what's going to happen now
[47:46] Abraham he was called Abraham he left
[47:51] the ear of the
[47:52] childes and the word ear of childes mean
[47:55] the fire of the childes so he left fire
[47:58] God took him out of that and that's why
[48:00] each time when God came to him God told
[48:03] him I am the god who took out of that
[48:05] fire but when you read the ear you may
[48:07] not want know what God was telling him I
[48:08] am the one who took you out of that
[48:12] fire amen and then we didn't know
[48:16] anything about Abraham until all of
[48:18] sudden in verse
[48:19] 14 when Abraham was about to
[48:23] play was kind of was going to give us
[48:26] the the the the the
[48:28] tidee the prefigure of redemption to go
[48:33] redeem his brother lot all of a sudden
[48:37] name appear attached to Abraham name
[48:40] they say all of a sudden somebody who
[48:42] escaped and came we never heard that
[48:45] word before nowhere all say Abraham the
[48:48] Hebrew have you ever asked what that
[48:50] means oh what it means and brother thank
[48:53] God for a prophet who came in a
[48:57] plain when I was studying Hebrew and I
[49:00] saw the prophet explain
[49:01] it for a prophet Seven Grade explained I
[49:06] never heard that from anybody else you
[49:09] can tell me anything to convince me of
[49:11] anything
[49:13] else amen so Hebrew mean
[49:20] crossover so you have crossover left
[49:23] everything and Abraham Abraham he cross

[49:30] I mean cross everything so each one of
[49:33] you tonight you left your associate you
[49:36] left everything all the different you
[49:38] left and cross over so so everyone of
[49:42] you so what is the saying that he was
[49:45] called Abraham the crossover so every
[49:48] single one of you here you can call
[49:51] yourself you can say Israel the Hebrew
[49:57] every single one of you here you can put
[49:59] after your name the Hebrew Hebrew is not
[50:02] a race thing is about crossing over and
[50:06] being Abraham Royal seed you cross over
[50:10] everything and you're here tonight every
[50:12] single one of you you are
[50:15] Hebrew amen and you don't have to look
[50:19] back and if we go back to
[50:23] Abraham we stay here we won't finish
[50:27] amen I just want to throw that out there

[50:31] Hebrew and what say what do you mean are

[50:36] passport if you have a Jewish passport

[51:08] get a littleit into Redemption even if I
[51:10] had to skip everything and get to
[51:11] Redemption I get there because you

[51:18] out brother Bram you have heard him
[51:22] always say
[51:24] that we are here in the West and try to
[51:27] understand the Bible written in
[51:30] eastern but he said when you went there
[51:32] the Bible became new so if the Bible
[51:34] became new to him what did he what what
[51:36] did he preach in he preaching that new
[51:38] language and the reason why we didn't
[51:40] understand
[51:42] him he was speaking a language in with
[51:46] Eastern concept and we were are here
[51:49] with our Western education we are trying
[51:52] and that's why we never understood the
[51:53] prophet it had to be simple and then
[51:55] Eastern that to be simple simple simple
[51:58] simple but the may make it complicated
[52:01] you lost you lost
[52:03] it
[52:04] amen
[52:06] so you got to understand the
[52:09] simplest any
[52:12] complicated that every one of you get

[52:18] don't just say it that has to be
[52:21] something that become a life to you and

[53:46] of of us Christians have
[53:49] problem God call you before the
[53:51] foundation of the world not to fulfill
[53:54] your purpose but to fulfill his purpose

[55:06] read here in Romans Romans 11 uh
[55:10] 34-36 it says here for who have known
[55:13] the mind of the Lord or who have been
[55:17] his counselor or who have first given to
[55:20] him and he shall be recompensed unto him
[55:24] again for of
[55:28] him and through him and to him are all
[55:34] things to him be glory
[55:37] forever we are connected to him so
[55:41] tonight you sitting here you are
[55:42] connected to him amen and and and and
[55:46] and Bram express it I won't have time to
[55:49] read the quote here but in 19 uh uh 64
[55:53] February 5th God is his own interpreter
[55:56] BR Braham explained that we are his
[55:59] attributes amen and all those attribute
[56:02] that have before you ever came here
[56:04] those attributes all right make you who
[56:07] you are here
[56:08] tonight
[56:10] amen so andam said here and now remember
[56:14] you Christians were his thoughts before
[56:17] there was a world and you are the
[56:19] manifestation of his
[56:23] thinking before there even was a word
[56:26] you were in Christ that's right Amen in
[56:30] God in the beginning that makes you then
[56:33] you see his subject and the whole thing
[56:37] is God himself materializing himself
[56:41] tangible so he could be handled sin and
[56:45] so forth and that's what God and that's
[56:47] what God uh is the whole
[56:51] thing that's what God is the whole thing
[56:54] amen so I said tonight
[56:57] you are connected to
[56:59] him please never let Satan or your
[57:03] circumstances talk you out of
[57:06] that amen never let Satan or
[57:09] circumstances talk you out of that amen
[57:13] all you have to do is hold on to his
[57:16] word and and promise to you and and his
[57:19] promises to you and be thankful from
[57:22] your heart at all times in your life it
[57:25] doesn't matter what comes thank you Lord
[57:28] I don't care what happened thank you
[57:30] Lord all right let me quickly jump here
[57:33] quick again I I I'll say some I'll throw
[57:35] something out there that usually I show
[57:37] in PowerPoint when you say when you
[57:40] raise your hand say hallelujah praising
[57:42] God and BR Brown told us you are
[57:45] defeating gravity but you know what
[57:46] you're doing when you raise your hand in
[57:49] a in a word Hebrew all right the word
[57:51] praise Hallelujah is written with it
[57:55] start with something because everything
[57:57] is almost like like pictures he start
[57:59] with a breath and two hands
[58:02] raised they say with one hand you giving
[58:05] your heart to God and if your other hand
[58:07] you are taking his heart so that's why
[58:10] brother say when you raise your hand you
[58:12] are giving your heart now it does not
[58:15] say what hand but it was just me say you
[58:17] know what I think with my left hand I'm
[58:18] raising I'm ging my heart because my
[58:20] heart is here so I give him that heart
[58:22] and I take his hand because he said his
[58:25] when I take his hand I give me the power
[58:26] with the right hand to do anything right
[58:28] so I give him my heart and I take his
[58:31] heart that's what praise mean so I don't
[58:34] care what you're going through when you
[58:37] when you are connected to God you in syn
[58:38] with him then your heart beat at the
[58:41] rhythm of God's heart I don't care what
[58:43] Satan does that's why when Satan went
[58:47] rooming all over and went to God God
[58:49] said you've been rooming where you've
[58:51] been rooming all over have you
[58:52] considered job because job's heart is
[58:55] beaten at the rate of my heart it's of
[58:57] course you if you put all that hedge
[59:00] around him of course it's okay I'll
[59:02] remove the Hedge you see what you can do
[59:04] amen go and try but don't touch his soul
[59:08] and that's what every one of us Abraham
[59:12] we all see it it doesn't matter what is
[59:15] happening our hearts and God's heart
[59:18] should be beating together in harmony
[59:20] our heart should be one with God's heart
[59:22] and how do you do that is to praise and
[59:24] that's the secret and that's how you can
[59:26] see when Happ say raise your hand raise
[59:28] your hand I said did know what it was
[59:31] that that's a secret and that's where
[59:33] the Hallelujah came from halel mean you
[59:36] raise your hand you give one heart to
[59:37] God take his heart and and yah is God
[59:40] you are doing that you are one with God
[59:43] and if you're one with God what can
[59:44] touch you Satan can that's why say well
[59:47] if you put that all that hedge around
[59:48] him you what can I do say they cannot do
[59:52] anything amen all
[59:54] right now may his word all right and

[1:00:12] forgiven amen love your neighbor as

[1:03:24] words but we today in our English
[1:03:26] language have millions of word trying to
[1:03:28] explain five so it's so simple so God
[1:03:32] spoke to them in
[1:03:34] Simplicity all right now as I studying
[1:03:37] doing self introspection the Lord also
[1:03:41] study from Hebrew point the Lord put on
[1:03:44] my heart those little stories of say
[1:03:47] here and there many time we gloss over
[1:03:49] them we Passover until we hear that say
[1:03:53] of the Lord people are not paying
[1:03:54] attention br br can start saying stories
[1:03:57] you can sometime people will sleep first
[1:03:59] when he begin say let's read the
[1:04:00] scripture okay yeah and then but bra has
[1:04:03] said a whole lot and and as I reading I
[1:04:06] go back and take the step for the very
[1:04:08] beginning br will place one little thing
[1:04:10] here and move on put one little thing
[1:04:11] here and move on one little thing here
[1:04:13] and move on one little thing here by the
[1:04:15] time begin to preach probably he's
[1:04:16] preaching to everybody now but he
[1:04:19] already put nuggets for the seed to find
[1:04:23] amen so the Lord put on my heart as I
[1:04:27] was looking on I'm I'm thinking that
[1:04:30] there's nothing new the Lord said that's
[1:04:32] right and then the Lord brought to my
[1:04:35] mind that story Abraham told he said
[1:04:37] that's what's happened to the bride I
[1:04:38] sent them a lot of a lot of money draft
[1:04:41] they have that there they have the M
[1:04:42] draft it's all over in their room every
[1:04:45] they don't know now what you have to do
[1:04:47] there nothing new you going to bring so
[1:04:50] when I go anywhere I put a disclaimer
[1:04:52] there nothing I'm bringing here if you
[1:04:53] think there nothing something new I'm
[1:04:55] going to bring they you'll be very
[1:04:56] disappointed all right but what we're
[1:04:58] going to be doing we're going to look
[1:05:00] for those morning draft they're all over
[1:05:03] amen so I said God now if you help me
[1:05:06] all right if you help me when I go
[1:05:09] somewhere no matter where I go I don't
[1:05:11] want to be seen But if you help me that
[1:05:13] I can go deep go into the message amen
[1:05:17] and take those and begin to shine the
[1:05:19] light on them all right then people can
[1:05:21] begin to see they can go and take the
[1:05:23] flashlight all right let Me Assume let's
[1:05:27] let let let let assume that okay okay
[1:05:29] this is my point I'll be using later but
[1:05:32] assume that it's a
[1:05:33] flashlight and let's let's assume that
[1:05:36] all of a sudden we power goes out here
[1:05:38] is complete
[1:05:39] dark complete dark nobody sees
[1:05:43] anything is a piano there it's still
[1:05:47] there my wife is sitting there she a sh
[1:05:49] city daugh city there Israel everybody
[1:05:52] the right and suppose that a and my
[1:05:56] flashlight and I oh there a piano did I
[1:05:59] did I did I BR did I brought the piano
[1:06:02] there all what I did the flag is already
[1:06:05] there so so when God sent a prophet he
[1:06:09] send us a bunch of money little money
[1:06:13] millions and we pack them there we argue
[1:06:18] we didn't understand what he said yes we
[1:06:20] didn't pray enough and then we are
[1:06:23] suffering and the social service
[1:06:27] comes do you have it yeah my father is
[1:06:30] in heaven who is your father the Lord
[1:06:32] Jesus Christ he down Calvary but you
[1:06:34] know what I don't he di but I don't know
[1:06:37] I I don't feel I don't know really did
[1:06:40] he send yeah yeah what he he he he gave
[1:06:44] me a book and the book has a lot of
[1:06:45] pages let's
[1:06:48] see what I am thy Shield wait a minute
[1:06:52] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:06:54] was bruised for our iniquities the just
[1:06:56] sin fell upon him but he Str wait a
[1:06:59] minute he gave you that
[1:07:02] yes and that's
[1:07:04] what we ministers we have to do is find
[1:07:08] the
[1:07:09] flashlight and pray and ask God God
[1:07:13] where is it that's turn the light on and
[1:07:16] you flash it on it's there the prophet
[1:07:18] has revealed everything if there's
[1:07:22] anything new if there's anything new
[1:07:26] anyone can bring then we are denying
[1:07:30] Revelation 10:7 if there's anything new
[1:07:33] anybody can bring then we are saying
[1:07:35] that revelation 10:7 will never fulfill
[1:07:37] Malachi
[1:07:39] 4
[1:07:41] amen all was fulfilled in Malachi 4 amen
[1:07:45] amen yes sir
[1:07:48] so now you see many people
[1:07:52] today they have problem they'll say well
[1:07:57] I I don't know what my purpose is you
[1:08:00] know what and you find out many sincere
[1:08:04] Christians all right sincere Christians
[1:08:07] devoted I don't know what my I don't
[1:08:10] really know what my uh my purpose
[1:08:14] is and I was uh as I was
[1:08:18] studying the Lord began to show me
[1:08:22] something you see my wife is a puzzle
[1:08:24] lover
[1:08:25] all right how many here love
[1:08:27] puzzle she can sit there I can sit there
[1:08:30] for two hours I can only put maybe two
[1:08:32] or three pieces she can tell you that
[1:08:34] all right that's not but she can be the
[1:08:36] know now but before she can put that
[1:08:39] puzzle I see that she has a picture
[1:08:42] she's looking at right now the reason
[1:08:48] imagine that she doesn't not have any
[1:08:50] picture and you bring all those puzzle
[1:08:53] I'm sure I mean she she's better than
[1:08:55] that I'm I'm sure I don't think she can
[1:08:56] do anything than first of all what are
[1:08:58] you putting together so you see his
[1:09:02] purpose was a big puzzle so instead of
[1:09:05] saying God show me my purpose say God
[1:09:09] show me what is your purpose and how do
[1:09:11] I how do I fit into that purpose so with
[1:09:16] the big picture I can see my wife would
[1:09:18] tell me no no no no you see how this
[1:09:20] this one goes here so when you find your
[1:09:23] purpose when you find his purpose and
[1:09:25] you begin to pray you begin to meditate
[1:09:28] on his word you begin to praise him you
[1:09:30] begin to connect with him then you can
[1:09:33] tell you you fit right in
[1:09:36] there amen and then he will show you how
[1:09:40] you fit in his purpose to fulfill that
[1:09:43] purpose because
[1:09:45] remember you never had a need to be a
[1:09:48] father you never had a need to be a
[1:09:52] savior a redeemer he's had that need to
[1:09:55] be God and be worship amen but now how
[1:09:58] is that going to happen he has to show
[1:10:01] you how you fit in that so you don't
[1:10:04] need to be scratching what's my purpose
[1:10:06] find his purpose first amen and and fill
[1:10:10] with the Holy Ghost then the Holy Ghost
[1:10:12] will lead you to how your purpose fit in
[1:10:16] his plan
[1:10:18] amen
[1:10:22] now now the seventh angel
[1:10:26] Malachi 4 the seven Church age messenger
[1:10:30] all
[1:10:31] right God promised that he will reveal
[1:10:35] all the Mysteries so the question today
[1:10:37] is did he reveal them or
[1:10:40] not if he didn't that mean well we're in
[1:10:43] trouble that mean we don't know what age
[1:10:44] we are
[1:10:46] in amen look look what we are look how
[1:10:50] things are going on who else are you
[1:10:52] waiting for to come I don't know
[1:10:56] amen so there's no new Mysteries all
[1:10:59] right everything has already been
[1:11:01] revealed right okay
[1:11:03] amen
[1:11:05] now now any Revelation that comes any
[1:11:09] light what I call Revelation when God
[1:11:12] Shine the
[1:11:13] light is not going to tell you that that
[1:11:17] thing speak is spooky it just it's
[1:11:19] simple yeah it's it's an instrument
[1:11:22] that's all what it is
[1:11:25] any Revelation that God
[1:11:27] send will show you that God is
[1:11:31] simple God loves
[1:11:33] you and he want you to love him
[1:11:36] back any Revelation that come who make
[1:11:39] God complicated
[1:11:40] obscure no that's never God and that's a
[1:11:44] reason why in
[1:11:46] 1963 everybody was waiting for the Seven
[1:11:49] Seals the whole
[1:11:52] world the stone the white stone that
[1:11:55] alive light had never shine
[1:11:57] on people thought that angel were flying
[1:12:00] all over the
[1:12:01] place but here the prophet walks humbled
[1:12:04] into the
[1:12:05] pulpit March 17
[1:12:08] 1963 God hiding himself and revealing
[1:12:12] him in Simplicity and revealing himself
[1:12:14] in the
[1:12:17] same and then he finished preaching the
[1:12:19] Seven Seals traveled to aluer New
[1:12:22] Mexico he preached in the morning walk
[1:12:25] for aart but what's the next message
[1:12:27] again God hiding in simplicity so he
[1:12:32] packaged that mystery that's right that
[1:12:35] God shine light on that we thought is
[1:12:37] going to be such such a great
[1:12:40] mystery even the revelation of the
[1:12:42] seventh Thunders when I asked him is it
[1:12:44] something new said no it's in the
[1:12:47] Bible so any new revelation any light
[1:12:51] that shine on anything that make God
[1:12:53] complicated uh-uh
[1:12:56] that's not that's not what it is and
[1:12:58] that's the reason why God has to raise a
[1:13:04] prophet with no great
[1:13:06] education to not make anything
[1:13:09] complicated sometime when he reading he
[1:13:11] can't even pronounce the word that the
[1:13:13] Theologian has interpreted and put here
[1:13:15] so complicated for him so he have to
[1:13:17] tell in tops of a dove an
[1:13:21] eagle if you take our English language
[1:13:24] or French French or anything maybe 20
[1:13:28] years from now they say what the Academy
[1:13:29] of of science or Academy of these
[1:13:32] languages have seen that this world has
[1:13:34] to
[1:13:35] change right today with all what is
[1:13:37] going on with sex people don't know who
[1:13:39] they are the words are changing the word
[1:13:41] gender is changing is that right the
[1:13:45] word gender doesn't mean what it used to
[1:13:47] be
[1:13:47] anymore right but if I see an eagle
[1:13:51] 1,000 years from now an eagle is an
[1:13:53] eagle if I see a
[1:13:55] do 1 million years from now a dove is a
[1:13:58] dove a lamb is a lamb so God spoke in
[1:14:01] terms things like that that will stay
[1:14:07] and God sent a prophet so he doesn't use
[1:14:09] big words oh a deer oh I was standing
[1:14:12] there and I saw the eagle I was against
[1:14:15] The
[1:14:16] Rock he spoke in a language that God can
[1:14:20] relate to us that will never never
[1:14:23] change amen
[1:14:26] so in M uh uh he wrapped that whole
[1:14:29] Revelation simplicity so
[1:14:31] remember when you approach God you have
[1:14:34] to approach always simple mind and the
[1:14:37] simple mind will be God I love
[1:14:39] you what must I do to love you more
[1:14:42] that's that's
[1:14:43] it I love you what must I do to love you
[1:14:48] more that's simple and then you let him
[1:14:52] you because when you do that I love you
[1:14:54] how do I to love you more you are
[1:14:55] telling him God what must I do to fit in
[1:14:58] my part of the puzzle they say now you
[1:15:00] wait now don't press God you add to that
[1:15:04] Faith you have to add
[1:15:06] patience and wait and just keep moving
[1:15:10] keep holding on Amen all right let me
[1:15:12] quickly run here so that we can see some
[1:15:16] some stuff
[1:15:21] now brother branam he was a voice of God
[1:15:25] to our age and it presented to us the
[1:15:27] son of man he was a son of man born of a
[1:15:31] and Charles bradam from but he presented
[1:15:34] to her this son of man who came from God
[1:15:38] Amen so
[1:15:40] now if a person has a Holy Ghost and has
[1:15:44] a revelation of the
[1:15:46] word and here was a prophet says there's
[1:15:49] no way he can turn and say he's a false
[1:15:52] prophet it's not possible so now I want
[1:15:56] just to go and
[1:15:58] see few things all right I know my time
[1:16:01] is
[1:16:02] running
[1:16:07] now what is
[1:16:09] hearing you hear Jesus said he who have
[1:16:12] the hear to hear Let Him
[1:16:15] hear now when I came back from Peru uh
[1:16:18] two years ago I begin to do self
[1:16:22] introspection I begin to ask my self
[1:16:24] question
[1:16:25] now Jesus said we don't receive because
[1:16:27] we don't ask imagine that you have a
[1:16:31] child that never ask you a question
[1:16:34] never ask you dad what do you like never
[1:16:36] ask you
[1:16:37] dad what business are you in that who's
[1:16:40] your father who's your mother where he
[1:16:41] never asked you you wonder is something
[1:16:44] emotionally wrong with this
[1:16:47] child so God want us to ask ourself
[1:16:50] question amen so myself
[1:16:55] I began to do introspection God I know I
[1:16:58] love you but have I really done all what
[1:17:02] it takes for me to re understand this
[1:17:03] message that's good so what I'm telling
[1:17:06] God is that God I don't know I want you
[1:17:09] to Lead Me amen all right and as I began
[1:17:13] to do that I as myself a question God
[1:17:17] have I really obey
[1:17:19] you have I obey your word because one
[1:17:22] thing that God
[1:17:23] wants is not that great faith God want
[1:17:27] obedience God want simple obedience and
[1:17:30] trust in him all right now put put the
[1:17:33] put the I know I'm running I'm running
[1:17:34] out of time now put the put the
[1:17:36] PowerPoint so at least I can go through
[1:17:39] some of the PowerPoint all right I've
[1:17:41] been theing since 85 almost 40 years but
[1:17:44] the time you been aing does not
[1:17:47] matter what matter is
[1:17:50] that how simple do you love
[1:17:53] God that's what
[1:17:55] matters do you obey him now I I want to
[1:17:59] jump ahead here and U this message here
[1:18:03] was preach here that's why I'm starting
[1:18:05] from too
[1:18:06] soon as I was asking myself question
[1:18:09] about self introspection and all that
[1:18:12] that's one of a message that the Lord
[1:18:14] led me
[1:18:16] to um in
[1:18:19] 2018 the Lord put on my heart press on
[1:18:21] my heart to study the last
[1:18:25] Convention of the
[1:18:27] Prophet that was in sha
[1:18:30] Louisiana from November 25th to November
[1:18:35] 28th now I won't I we won't we won't I
[1:18:39] won't be able to go through all that but
[1:18:41] there's one that's got stuck with me and
[1:18:44] Steve can tell you is the last one on
[1:18:46] the wings of a snow white dog and that's
[1:18:49] why uh
[1:18:51] Timothy you always be stuck with me in
[1:18:54] my study is he took us there and show
[1:18:58] us where brother the story that was
[1:19:01] talking about when he was
[1:19:04] against um The Rock and saw White Eagle
[1:19:08] but when BR brah said that BR brah
[1:19:10] mentioned something that people don't
[1:19:11] pay attention to he said White Eagle now
[1:19:15] he said White Eagle parentheses do
[1:19:18] leading
[1:19:20] Eagle he has against The Rock Eagle but
[1:19:24] then he slid something in there SP do
[1:19:28] leading ego exactly where God said the
[1:19:31] next message will come and when I get
[1:19:33] there the Lord said now read what is he
[1:19:35] saying here then I took that I went back
[1:19:40] to
[1:19:42] Matthew when Jesus came out of the
[1:19:47] water the Dove came on him and he went
[1:19:50] to the Wilderness and when he came back
[1:19:53] from the wilderness
[1:19:55] in power he went to the synagogue to
[1:19:59] make his mission statement any business
[1:20:03] any Ministry any church that start you
[1:20:05] must have a mission statement with a
[1:20:07] Clear Vision amen and
[1:20:12] then what does it mean Dove leading
[1:20:14] Eagles I know what I know what what
[1:20:16] Eagles are strong birds and I know what
[1:20:20] doves are we have at home couple turtle
[1:20:23] doves you you to that thing the the
[1:20:26] feather Des I mean get disr on your hand
[1:20:29] and everything said you can see in those
[1:20:32] dos so I wonder I ask myself when I
[1:20:35] touch that Dove trying to sometime
[1:20:36] handle them move them their feather just
[1:20:38] come apart but how how is that Dove
[1:20:42] going to
[1:20:44] lead an eagle if an eagle flap his wing
[1:20:48] that do will
[1:20:50] disintegrate so the Lord put on my heart
[1:20:53] to go and study the message that BR
[1:20:56] Brown pre that
[1:20:58] morning amen and in that the message
[1:21:00] that he preached in that
[1:21:02] morning he
[1:21:04] said that the now the people are
[1:21:09] [Music]
[1:21:11] beginning to hear the
[1:21:14] message
[1:21:16] intellectually
[1:21:18] but the must lay under the sun and
[1:21:22] mature and T
[1:21:26] now we we come back to the message on
[1:21:29] the wing of Snow White Dove at the end
[1:21:31] of the message he was calling that was
[1:21:35] his Farewell convention he was telling
[1:21:38] Shalom all the nation was hooked by
[1:21:41] telephone hook up to Shaul
[1:21:44] lisiana and Brother briham begin to say
[1:21:48] all the way from New York being to call
[1:21:51] different ministers those are ministers
[1:21:53] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:21:55] he said call all of them say say I'll be
[1:21:57] wrong Jeffersonville West Coast say say
[1:22:01] I'll be wrong all my life I want the
[1:22:04] dove to come in I can feel the
[1:22:06] fluttering of the dove coming in what
[1:22:08] was he saying he was telling us now I
[1:22:11] have brought
[1:22:13] you now you are going to you are going
[1:22:15] to go through the Wilderness to the
[1:22:17] desert Jesus when Jesus came out of the
[1:22:20] water the dove he says if you if if you
[1:22:24] read in Matthew 3-4 they say the dove
[1:22:28] led him to be tempted so you see when we
[1:22:33] heard those messages we thought we have
[1:22:36] Eagles
[1:22:38] faith we can move
[1:22:41] mountains but the prophet was trying to
[1:22:44] tell us that with that eagle fith that
[1:22:48] we thing we have we still have to
[1:22:51] surrender and let the dove now the dove
[1:22:55] is going to lead us through Wilderness
[1:22:57] it's not going to be easy many people
[1:22:59] think that time 77 oh be a Rapture we're
[1:23:03] gone so many people p 77 didn't know
[1:23:06] where we going
[1:23:07] anymore and yet the dove know where we
[1:23:10] are
[1:23:11] going the do know where we are going
[1:23:14] right with with that fa we're going to
[1:23:16] Rapture but you
[1:23:18] see Jesus we we are interested in the
[1:23:21] Rapture but Jesus is interested in the
[1:23:23] lost one that he died for amen
[1:23:27] amen
[1:23:28] so the
[1:23:30] dove was supposed to lead us we go
[1:23:34] through Wilderness all the thing that
[1:23:36] was going to happen to us God seen it
[1:23:39] and the only way now brother Brown say
[1:23:41] that's where the next message will come
[1:23:42] from I said what message this is it but
[1:23:46] what other message coming but it mean
[1:23:49] the holy spirit is going to lead us
[1:23:51] through this Wilderness the attack the
[1:23:54] fighting and all that if we can let the
[1:23:56] Holy Spirit lead us we will go through
[1:23:59] but we thought we have the faith we can
[1:24:01] do it then we begin to disintegrate
[1:24:03] right okay so here brother Bram just
[1:24:08] before he left us now in in in in in
[1:24:13] Hebrew if you want to find it and in the
[1:24:15] Bible if you want to find a real meaning
[1:24:17] of something you trace it back all the
[1:24:20] way to where it appears for the first
[1:24:22] time so the Lord put on my heart why
[1:24:25] don't you do that for the message too so
[1:24:27] I began to trace the message trace the
[1:24:30] message all the way to April 12 1947 the
[1:24:34] first message faith is the
[1:24:36] substance what what did I sending for to
[1:24:39] return back to original faith and then
[1:24:43] from April 12th
[1:24:47] 1947 to December 12th
[1:24:52] 1965 is exactly 18 years and 8 months
[1:24:57] now in the Hebrew 18 is
[1:25:01] life and eight is back to Eternity so
[1:25:05] with
[1:25:07] over 18 years and 8
[1:25:11] months God send us a
[1:25:14] message life that send us back to
[1:25:18] Eternity amen back to Eternity so when
[1:25:22] we was living
[1:25:24] the
[1:25:25] last that whatever message that he
[1:25:27] preached he was just helping us
[1:25:30] encouraging us he said here all
[1:25:34] right I'm saying this so that you will
[1:25:38] understand what you're doing if you walk
[1:25:41] into anything blindly you don't know
[1:25:45] where what you're doing you can even
[1:25:49] have
[1:25:50] confidence if you don't know what you're
[1:25:53] doing
[1:25:55] amen and I realized
[1:25:57] that we've quoted the message we've done
[1:26:01] a lot with there have be quot walls the
[1:26:04] quot became like weapons and all that
[1:26:06] spiritual weapons against one another we
[1:26:09] never really understood what the prophet
[1:26:11] said all right so I was
[1:26:14] praying and the Lord begin to show some
[1:26:17] some separ that's what I want to share
[1:26:18] with you all right there's nothing new
[1:26:20] I'm bringing nothing new next slide
[1:26:23] please now you hear BR Bram said
[1:26:26] that the Bible is an Eastern book but we
[1:26:30] we are here looking at it from with a
[1:26:32] Western View and it's complete different
[1:26:36] all right it's a complete different
[1:26:38] that's why we never understood the
[1:26:39] prophet and that's why today you see
[1:26:42] there what called a blind faith people
[1:26:44] accepted it but today they don't
[1:26:45] understand it they walk into it blindly
[1:26:48] they never have confidence in the
[1:26:50] message when a hard time came look what
[1:26:52] happened many people say people could
[1:26:54] have been in the message for 40 years
[1:26:56] even some ministers pastors 40 years
[1:26:59] they never had confidence in it in the
[1:27:00] message what happened now he's a false
[1:27:03] prophet amen and he told us that all
[1:27:07] right
[1:27:09] so but the way the Bible was written
[1:27:13] Jesus me a parable so that we can always
[1:27:15] go back to it and that's why he sent a
[1:27:17] prophet to speak like Jesus spoke The
[1:27:20] Parables amen so let me do this brother
[1:27:24] Israel I'm running out of time now okay
[1:27:28] um I I want to do something quick you
[1:27:31] see this is a magnifier right if if if
[1:27:35] you see me walk in the street with this
[1:27:37] magnifier like this just walking like
[1:27:39] that you people say wait a minute that
[1:27:41] brother there's something wrong with him
[1:27:43] if you guys know me say oh brother M
[1:27:46] came and preach do you see him in the
[1:27:47] street he's losing it
[1:27:51] right but now what if you see me doing
[1:27:55] this someone say how is Morel oh I got
[1:27:58] it he's getting age he he he needs
[1:28:01] something to help him right so this
[1:28:04] thing
[1:28:05] here this is
[1:28:09] this so the same way that if I'm going
[1:28:12] around with this alone you think I'm
[1:28:14] crazy so if you just go if you just go
[1:28:17] around alone with this people say you a
[1:28:20] cult come on now that's right if I just
[1:28:23] go and have this is going around they
[1:28:25] say you are cult but if you like I said
[1:28:27] if you see me doing this you say why
[1:28:29] need help so this year magnify the
[1:28:34] word if you put it you see clear and
[1:28:37] that's why God told
[1:28:39] habac God told habac write the tables in
[1:28:43] such way that people who see it can
[1:28:45] extend it you don't have to say oh you
[1:28:47] know what this is that and no no no it's
[1:28:50] so that's why BR is simple so put the s
[1:28:53] that somebody who read it and understand
[1:28:55] the Simplicity of God that's I told heac
[1:28:58] right so brother Bram God sent him even
[1:29:01] though he didn't speak Hebrew he I can
[1:29:03] tell you having St a littleit Hebrew
[1:29:06] everything he was telling us was he was
[1:29:08] speaking from that Ean mindset to
[1:29:11] explain to us the heart of God now you
[1:29:13] don't need to learn Hebrew all what you
[1:29:15] have to do is pray that God Shine the
[1:29:17] Light on the message brother BR has
[1:29:19] already done all the work for us amen so
[1:29:23] then next slide please let me run
[1:29:25] quickly here next slide
[1:29:27] please all right now let let's keep this
[1:29:30] this I see the same quote talking about
[1:29:31] the eastern book all right next slide
[1:29:34] please now you see here I let me tell
[1:29:38] you see the Western
[1:29:40] mine and the hebraic mind so for them
[1:29:44] there's in the western we see a split
[1:29:46] between natural and Supernatural but for
[1:29:49] them everything
[1:29:50] Supernatural for example let me come
[1:29:52] here power power over others achieve
[1:29:56] through business politics and human
[1:29:59] organization but in the Eastern is
[1:30:03] power is dead power over others is
[1:30:08] structur
[1:30:10] by social patterns ordained by
[1:30:14] God you see next slide please when you
[1:30:18] begin to approach God from the Western
[1:30:22] we looking at
[1:30:24] God like from our power ourself what we
[1:30:28] can do but from over there everything is
[1:30:32] is is ordained by God all right n i I'll
[1:30:36] skip one day one one one day if I come
[1:30:38] here again I'll have to take time
[1:30:39] because that by says the message all
[1:30:41] right I just wanted to show that a
[1:30:43] little bit to show that God send us a
[1:30:46] prophet he brought us in the other
[1:30:48] column now if you look here in all the
[1:30:51] scriptures here okay you see that it say
[1:30:55] for it says for instance uh Genesis 20
[1:30:58] 20 20 28 obey my voice everywhere obey
[1:31:03] my voice obey my voice obey my voice so
[1:31:06] the question how do you obey a voice
[1:31:09] amen next slide please how do you obey a
[1:31:11] voice how do you obey a voice next slide
[1:31:14] please so this year no no no come back
[1:31:18] uh so you see this here is a definition
[1:31:21] you can get on the internet what obey
[1:31:22] means okay next slide please hear same
[1:31:27] thing but what does it really means obey
[1:31:31] and hear so the question that I was
[1:31:33] going to ask myself is that did I really
[1:31:36] hear the prophet first
[1:31:39] question I I hear sounds on the tape
[1:31:43] okay yes I hear sounds on the tape but
[1:31:46] did I hear the prophet that's what I'm
[1:31:47] trying to get to okay let's go to next
[1:31:51] so you see in
[1:31:52] Deuteronomy the you have a PR called
[1:31:55] shma the shma come from Deuteronomy 64
[1:31:58] uh 64 to5 here oh Israel the Lord Our
[1:32:02] God the Lord is one so in Hebrew there
[1:32:06] really no word that mean
[1:32:09] obey now you'll be surprised there's
[1:32:12] really no word that means obey the
[1:32:15] Hebrew word that returns at obey is the
[1:32:17] word shma and and what the the shma
[1:32:22] which mean here but what it means it
[1:32:25] means more than just hearing or
[1:32:30] listening amen now it means when say sha
[1:32:36] let's say for instance you have a child
[1:32:38] a mother tell a child sh what is saying
[1:32:41] is that listen to what I said think
[1:32:44] about it and take the appropriate action
[1:32:46] all
[1:32:47] right if the child keep doing what he's
[1:32:50] doing the child didn't the child didn't
[1:32:52] hear amen
[1:32:54] so it means to hear and respond
[1:32:59] appropriately amen so when for instance
[1:33:04] the Bible says Moses uh uh the um when
[1:33:08] it say when the bible say that Moses
[1:33:09] heard the Lord it means that he heard
[1:33:11] him and then he acting upon what he
[1:33:14] heard amen now when a Bible all right
[1:33:18] says that the Lord heard the people it
[1:33:20] means that he heard them and took an
[1:33:23] appropriate action amen so when Jesus
[1:33:27] said he who have an ear to hear Let Him
[1:33:30] hear it looks like what what he's trying
[1:33:32] to say is that if you hear what I've
[1:33:35] said think about it P and take the
[1:33:38] appropriate action so for instance if
[1:33:40] you to the Pentecostal they heard a
[1:33:42] voice but when eser baptized in the name
[1:33:45] of Father Son and Holy Spirit they
[1:33:46] didn't hear the word because the
[1:33:49] appropriate action will be to baptize in
[1:33:51] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ next
[1:33:54] slide
[1:33:55] please so so the the the the the the
[1:33:59] shma all right when David said for
[1:34:03] example the Lord heard me David is not
[1:34:06] accusing the Lord of being hard hearing
[1:34:08] he's saying that the Lord heard me and
[1:34:11] took the appropriate action towards me
[1:34:14] amen so next slide please I have to skip
[1:34:17] a lot here all right so
[1:34:20] now what is the main purpose for for
[1:34:23] obeying is
[1:34:24] love is not a fear of going to
[1:34:27] hell is not a fear of
[1:34:29] saying I'm lost is love because if you
[1:34:33] see here in uh in John 14 21 he said he
[1:34:38] that have my commandment and keepeth
[1:34:41] them is what is he that do what loveth
[1:34:44] me so love is the basis
[1:34:48] for obedience for hearing next slide
[1:34:51] please next slide now now okay let's
[1:34:54] keep this again let's keep this I want
[1:34:56] to quickly go next
[1:34:59] slide next slide again so here this is
[1:35:04] something very important all right this
[1:35:05] where I'm going to get AIT into Hebrew
[1:35:09] now in the Garden of Eden something
[1:35:14] happened when God's creation stopped to
[1:35:16] hear
[1:35:17] Satan now when Satan came first of all
[1:35:22] imagine that you have a child and you
[1:35:25] told your child don't go to the
[1:35:28] woods If the child heard what you say if
[1:35:32] I come to that child say let go to the
[1:35:34] wood the wood the child will say no
[1:35:36] period no arguing no reason I'm not
[1:35:38] going but imagine if I come to your
[1:35:41] child and tell the child did your dad
[1:35:44] say don't go to the wood because of the
[1:35:46] danger that I may hurt you they you
[1:35:49] begin to H danger there is that why my
[1:35:51] dad is say maybe I want to see what is
[1:35:52] there now remember one thing in Genesis
[1:35:58] 2 when God was giving a command or was
[1:36:02] telling Adam about do not
[1:36:05] eat he told Adam they can eat of every
[1:36:10] right it was Adam
[1:36:12] alone Eve was not created yet so Adam
[1:36:17] became the first prophet to take the
[1:36:19] word of God to tell the bride amen amen
[1:36:23] his Bri so the bride can accept or
[1:36:27] reject it start right from there so when
[1:36:30] Satan washed them he watched Adam and
[1:36:32] Eve he watch their habit when Adam was a
[1:36:36] away Adam who received the
[1:36:38] word was a way then he
[1:36:42] came now he brought the question he said
[1:36:46] everything that he didn't say oh Eve do
[1:36:48] you want to eat this fruit he said Can
[1:36:50] said no no reason but he brought it with
[1:36:53] a open-ended question he studed what God
[1:36:57] Said and miss and and and and and and
[1:37:00] distorted it first of all God never said
[1:37:04] touch there nowhere God talk to touch
[1:37:07] but you hear a word like touching coming
[1:37:09] all right Touch come if you if you can
[1:37:11] read that if you if you if you see
[1:37:13] what's going on so what happened is that
[1:37:17] Satan came quoted everything God said
[1:37:20] but try to miss try to put an open
[1:37:23] question ambiguous thing what is that
[1:37:26] doing when Eve stop it brought even to
[1:37:31] reasoning is that so or not he brought
[1:37:35] if to question did Adam tell me
[1:37:38] everything did Adam hear everything from
[1:37:41] God because look this is what Satan
[1:37:44] repeating what God Said but adding few
[1:37:47] different things but this what Adam said
[1:37:49] did Adam say did Adam really hear from
[1:37:51] God if has a question to begin to ask
[1:37:54] herself did Adam hear anything from God
[1:37:57] or maybe he didn't you see that open
[1:38:00] right there yes an Avenue for what
[1:38:03] happens in your mind and what happen in
[1:38:06] your heart your heart accept your mind
[1:38:10] reason
[1:38:11] question and that's why the prophet will
[1:38:13] always say that he has to go from
[1:38:16] here to your heart
[1:38:19] so same thing here when God called the
[1:38:23] prophet
[1:38:24] we were not there there was no bride
[1:38:27] when God gave him the commission we were
[1:38:29] not there so the prophet took the word
[1:38:33] just like Adam to tell the bride that
[1:38:35] God sent him but today we are we are
[1:38:39] back exactly to where Eve
[1:38:41] was did the prophet hear from God or he
[1:38:46] didn't where the cloud real or
[1:38:49] not was the pill of fire real or a
[1:38:52] reflection of some
[1:38:55] light amen we are back to the same thing
[1:38:58] amen
[1:39:00] so when would I have five more minutes
[1:39:04] now when all right this thing here don't
[1:39:07] take me longer than that now when your
[1:39:10] mind is open to reasoning two things are
[1:39:13] going on your heart either accept or
[1:39:16] your man question so the question here
[1:39:19] is that remember if was not there so the
[1:39:22] when when Satan p the whole picture
[1:39:24] bringing what Adam she hear from Adam
[1:39:27] versus
[1:39:28] other who is the truth did Adam omitted
[1:39:32] some now what Satan added were there
[1:39:36] something that maybe God said he
[1:39:39] omitted and if you see the way God talk
[1:39:42] about the tree it Satan even repeat the
[1:39:45] same way now when your mind is
[1:39:48] open when you begin to question this
[1:39:51] message then the devil comes in he's not
[1:39:54] going to change a whole
[1:39:55] lot he change one so when when Satan
[1:40:01] begin to realize that if now yes he open
[1:40:05] up then he change one thing because he
[1:40:08] knows that when you CH one that said so
[1:40:11] if you notice God said shall surely not
[1:40:15] die the serpent said shall not surely
[1:40:18] die one word so now let's I want us to
[1:40:20] look at that one word before I leave I
[1:40:23] have more we won't get there that not in
[1:40:28] Hebrew is the the you have to read it
[1:40:31] from right to left I don't know what
[1:40:32] happened to oh it came back you see this
[1:40:35] one
[1:40:37] here that's that God
[1:40:41] l in Hebrew but now look at the
[1:40:46] not is the them of God change turn the
[1:40:50] other way do you know you see that so
[1:40:54] that's why Jesus told us it will be so
[1:40:57] close look somebody look if I if I
[1:40:59] didn't if I didn't tell you about Hebrew
[1:41:01] you looking at this on the top the one
[1:41:04] in the red all right my my poter is
[1:41:07] dying the one in the red I say on the
[1:41:09] top and the bottom you say the same
[1:41:11] thing if I come here fly this oh this
[1:41:14] the same is the same thing is that right
[1:41:17] so the word that Satan added is if even
[1:41:23] the name of God turn the other way and
[1:41:27] that's
[1:41:28] why amen when God came what happened
[1:41:33] Adam run the other
[1:41:35] way from that time on every time so it's
[1:41:40] you see the you see how the the the red
[1:41:42] right read it from right no right to
[1:41:45] left look what is the bottom it like
[1:41:48] switch so that's the word not in Hebrew
[1:41:52] and that's the word that
[1:41:54] Satan added so every time when God came
[1:42:00] what Adam Adam where what did he do he
[1:42:02] run away so from that point on was
[1:42:05] introduced in the race of Adam anything
[1:42:08] run away from God and that's why brother
[1:42:10] Bram said no man run to God it's God who
[1:42:14] comes after you is the mercy of God
[1:42:16] because of that that introduced the race
[1:42:19] we always running away from God amen so
[1:42:24] but now it will take so when we run away
[1:42:28] from God we are without God next SL let
[1:42:30] me see what's yeah okay that one and I I
[1:42:32] will end
[1:42:33] here then immediately God went to doing
[1:42:38] the work of redemption what did God do
[1:42:41] God find Adam kill a lamb now I would
[1:42:45] like you to look you see the word on the
[1:42:48] left right look at it and look at the
[1:42:51] word okay thank you
[1:42:54] how many word you count there there are
[1:42:55] four letters right now look at the word
[1:42:57] on the
[1:42:58] right how many you count five you hear
[1:43:01] br br say five five five a j s us now
[1:43:05] the one on the left is called Gula gulab
[1:43:10] be Exile you are without God that's what
[1:43:12] happened to Adam when Adam run away he
[1:43:15] went to a world without God and the
[1:43:18] red that's God unified with human with
[1:43:22] Humanity so when Adam run away Adam went
[1:43:25] to what we call Gula A word without God
[1:43:30] so when God came to Adam he brought the
[1:43:33] lamb killed the lamb to to unify said
[1:43:36] that's what's going to happen there
[1:43:38] going to be a
[1:43:39] Redemption so that on the on the right
[1:43:43] there that's the word Gula Redemption
[1:43:47] now you see how close they are only one
[1:43:49] thing that change what is God coming in
[1:43:52] the day God save you tell me did you
[1:43:54] become any
[1:43:55] taller the day God save you did you be
[1:43:58] did you become shorter the day God save
[1:44:00] you did you change anything but what
[1:44:03] happened God came
[1:44:05] in now Peter now let's go back to Peter
[1:44:09] when God breathed on them Peter even in
[1:44:14] the garden my wife were playing this
[1:44:16] today uh uh before we came she she she
[1:44:19] was playing the uh the Bible Peter J
[1:44:23] didn't deny God he denied god with a
[1:44:27] note when a Jew present a note you mean
[1:44:30] that you my life so Peter deny god with
[1:44:34] his life that mean you can kill me and
[1:44:37] know I don't know that
[1:44:40] man amen so when like like let's say
[1:44:43] Paul and then let say they took a note
[1:44:45] to go do so now we are de for our life
[1:44:47] if we don't do that he cannot be killed
[1:44:50] amen and that's why when the when when
[1:44:53] when they went to Jericho when they
[1:44:55] promis okay uhh what what's her name
[1:44:59] they said that we present with our oath
[1:45:01] with our life so Peter Peter
[1:45:07] before Christ came in he was in he was
[1:45:10] in G and that's why Jesus call Peter do
[1:45:12] you love me oh I love you Peter do you
[1:45:15] love yes but God know no you don't have
[1:45:18] that yet and that the third oh God you
[1:45:21] know everything amen so he then Jesus
[1:45:26] told him when you are converted that
[1:45:29] mean when the Elohim the red comes into
[1:45:34] you then convert your
[1:45:36] brothers amen that's about the day of
[1:45:39] Pentecost when God came
[1:45:43] in repent and be baptized he can walk
[1:45:47] and people walk in Shadow he will no
[1:45:49] more afraid I'll leave you here
[1:45:53] what I want to tell you is
[1:45:55] this but how does you get that by the
[1:45:58] baptism of the Holy
[1:46:00] Ghost amen so I'll leave you with this
[1:46:05] there's more I can say but I don't have
[1:46:06] time to get
[1:46:08] there if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:46:10] don't don't sleep until you say God fill
[1:46:13] the Holy Ghost if you are not born again
[1:46:17] say
[1:46:18] God I nothing anymore interest me until
[1:46:21] I'm born again and and fill with don't
[1:46:23] just be bornn again born again that's
[1:46:25] the initial step you have to go all the
[1:46:28] way and be and receive the Holy Ghost
[1:46:31] when you receive the Holy Ghost then you
[1:46:33] are out of
[1:46:34] Exile you see Peter here is Peter he
[1:46:38] received the Revelation who do men say I
[1:46:40] am thou are the Son of God and what did
[1:46:44] God said what did Jesus told him is my
[1:46:47] father right but he was still in Exile
[1:46:49] that's how you can deny Jesus with a
[1:46:51] note
[1:46:53] amen because God hasn't come in he
[1:46:55] hasn't get to Gila which is redemption
[1:46:59] amen so and that's what BR Bram said all
[1:47:02] right when I read that when I saw that
[1:47:04] when I studed BR Bram said if there is
[1:47:07] anything I could tell you more if I have
[1:47:10] the voice of a to tell you the
[1:47:13] importance of about Holy Ghost that's
[1:47:14] the best I can give you and when I came
[1:47:17] to find that I said yet that what was
[1:47:19] talking about and that's why Peter and
[1:47:21] them no matter what re they got so no
[1:47:24] matter what Revelation you get of the
[1:47:26] message no matter your bapti no matter
[1:47:29] how many books you read if the Holy
[1:47:31] Ghost doesn't come in you are in
