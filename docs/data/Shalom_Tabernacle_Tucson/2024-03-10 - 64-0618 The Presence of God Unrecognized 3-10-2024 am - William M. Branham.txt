[Music] [Music] e [Music] good morning brothers and sisters thank the Lord let us all stand we're going to pray and read the scripture for the Sunday School we'll be reading from Revelation 6 the third seal verses five and six so before we do that let's let's all pray Heavenly Father we're thankful for this day Lord Lord and how you've blessed us so much Lord and given us a place of worship Lord and just the spiritual food we're about to receive Lord we pray that we digest it that we live by every word father you'd meet every need Lord for the other Sunday School classes we pray Lord you'd be with them you cause us to draw closer to you father Lord that you change our lives amen Lord from glory to glory yes be with everyone father be with everything that's said and done in the service today I will give you all the honor and the praise in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen Revelation 6 verse 5 and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see and I beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of Bley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine we'll be uh starting at paragraph 134 to 189 to be about 20 minutes let's just sing only believe only be only biley all things are possible oh only believe only believe only be all things are possible only be you may be seated for all right God has promised this church this Pentecostal Church knowing she would do it like it did to Eve God has promised the Pentecostal church do you believe that she sold her birthrights before uh her virtue when she left over there do you believe that she sure she did then what good is a Creed not based on this Bible I want somebody to find What's called the apost Creed or even one word of it in the Bible that's a Catholic Creed not an Apostles Creed read acts 238 that's Apostles Creed now that's what they used all time anyhow so if you see so they sold out their birth rights not only that Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal rest's done the same she formed a denomination Rome what made her do that she formed a nomination and put man at the head of it and the Methodist Baptist Pentecostals and everyone's done the same thing put a group of man at the head of it no matter what God says they you got to do it the way they say do it but what is it it's nothing in the world but spiritual prostitution wrong type of woman that's Creeds ly Creeds man-made then she became when she did that now I'll prove this she became a to God you believe the Bible says that this her daughters has done the same now in Revelation 17 you want to mark it down John was taken in the spirit and saw a great horor setting up on and we read it last night and there was the seven heels and exactly what you done and she had given the world her filthy fornications that right and all the kings of the earth committed fornications with her cheating stealing lying paying for repentance and and novenas and every other thing when I remember she had daughters well if she become a body under an organizational system then the whole system's wrong amen amen amen in of Eve disobeying God thr everything into death that was under and every church that organizes throws everything to death under that's right exactly whole thing's gone that's exactly according to the word here read Revelation 17 and the Bible said that he would burn her with fire and all her children with her amen right amen that means every organization system will burn with the hor that sounds flat and uh I I know you'll hear from it I I want to hear from it amen and I that's right old amen the Bible said so so that makes it right she became a you can read Revelations the 17th chapter she what did she do she committed fornications against her own husband well you say no that's the Bible the word is God Amen and if you take one thing would you want your wife kissing some other man if she didn't do no more than that you wouldn't want her doing it she'd prove her un truess whosoever shall take one word away from it or add one to it Hallelujah Christ his life pure with the word way she must be oh nothing not one hot or one jle or anything or TI will pass from that law for that book Co it's all fulfilled Jesus said both heavens and earth will pass but my word shall never pass don't put any private interpretation to it he wants a pure unadulterated not even a flirt I wouldn't want my wife flirt to some other man and when you go to listen to any kind of reasons beyond that you're listening you're FLIR with [Music] Satan hallelujah amen don't make feel Hallelujah God wants you to stay unadulterated stay right there in that word stay right with it all right God promised to her as he did to Eve in the Garden of Eden to this uh last Eve here which the Pentecostal Church the beginning of the church the church itself is the mother of all of the living people because as long as they go in there but you see when they they take up her sins they die with her amen here comes a little fellow along he say I want to serve God they say well here's what you do go down there and repent all right I'll do it glory to God go down there and repent now come Jo there there you are I got it TR died right with it that's that's what this book is teaching see not what I'm saying because it says you're Soul all right now God has promised her as it did Eve he told Eve there would come a time that there would the word would come back to her again how you remember that what she lost from it would be restored because there's only one thing can restore and that's the word exactly I said shoot a gun if you don't hit the target find where it went off at you got to come back there and start again and if you go back you go to Nia it's where you start again see go back W them organizations W all that church we've been seeing these seals us perfectly always wanted all my life why I was so against the organizational systems not the people no the people are just like me or you or anybody else but that system that denominational system now I see it right here never know it till now that's right God promised the spiritual Eve as same as it did the natural Eve again the word would be restored to her in the last days he would restore to the church to the original word again I'll watch real close I I want you to be sure now God promised the eve the time would come when the word would be restored by her seed amen the word itself would become seed and when they give her a substitute she help that substitute and when the word come to her what she do I don't want it was too humble didn't look right to her wasn't polished enough a stable oh my my a guy like that not a day in school I could accept that that's no Messiah a Godly guys kick him around like that then call it Messiah let him put a rag around his face and hit him on the head he called himself a prophet a real Prophet raised up that they didn't know prophets Jesus said so amen he said if you have known the ET you know me I noticed but when the word came to her the way just exactly the way God said it would come she had figured out some other way amen I'm talking about the bride the Jewish bride the Hebrew bride that was Eve to begin with now when it come out here she didn't want it she want to stay with her substitutes now God promised spiritual Eve at Pentecost told it even before it happened 400 years years before the church ever fell that they would fall away and they would do what they've done but he promised in the last days he had s the word [Music] again Jesus spoke the same thing when he was on Earth he was s it again and what is what will it find it'll find the same thing that it found when it come first am right they've got they want their substitutes they want their denomination they want their Creeds they want to live just the way they want to and they want well I'm so and so I belong to so and so don't make what God's doing how much he manifest himself he could raise the dead he could tell the secrets of the hearts he could do everything that the Bible said he would do that don't make a bit of difference if it ain't connect with my organization is nothing to it same thing that Hebrew right yeah that's right see they listened to their substitute and God promised them the real and when the real come they didn't want it it was too humble amen that's the same thing today when when it rises on the scene now God said in Malachi 4 that he would send the message in the last days that would restore God Joel said I will restore all the ears everything that Rome eat up everything the Methodist eat up everything the Baptist eat up all that original Pentecostal Branch God said I will [Music] restore and he can send this such a person that we'll be the only thing that God ever sent his word to as a prophet not to reformers to prophets amen it wasn't the hour fart now it's getting to be the hour and that's the Reon we watching F to come it'll be so humble and gentle and so oh my you think them aristocratic Methodist Baptist and Presbyterian Pentecostals will ever receive it oh you said Pentecostals the Pentecostals is the Lady or sins rich and have need of nothing it said you don't know that you're poor might be building millions of dollars buildings but you're still poor spiritual poor oh you say I see it all you're or you say bless God I'm covered [Music] naked I sure are boys we got seminaries we and don't know it now that's just vice versa now if the Bible said that the lady of sinan church would be in that condition and there's no person on Earth could deny that this isn't the last age because the lady of sin Church age or the seventh Church age and here we are the second 2,000 years is finishing there's no more Church ages that's you Lin brother couldn't start another organization is go to beor right it's at the end can't be no more Church agents it's all over but then if the Pentecostal message was the last message which justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the last three messages the last three Church ages forms a complete birth it's like when a woman is have to go to have her baby the actual first thing happens is water next thing's blood next thing he's life when they killed Jesus At The Cross the substance come from his body to make up the new to make up the the birth they stuck his side blood and water came out and into thy hands I command my spirit what came from his body was water water blood spirit first john7 tells you about that there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word which is Christ and the Holy Ghost and these three agree in one they're not one but they agree in one and there are three that bear Rec they are one I mean I'm mistaken and the three that bear record in Earth is the water blood and spirit and they agree in that you can be Sanctified without being justified you can be justified without being Sanctified you can be a Sanctified without receiving the Holy Ghost exactly the disciples in John 17:17 was Sanctified and given power cast out Devils still didn't have the Holy Ghost had to go up to Pentecost and wait till the Holy Ghost come that's where Judah showed his color see how that Spirit worked its way through justification and sanctification but when it come to the end he showed his color that's right now notice now here we are at the end time in spiritual Eve just as that's as Hebrew Eve was promised the Hebrew bride was promised the word to return and the spiritual bride from Pentecost when she fell at NAA then she's promised in the last days that the word will come again now you see and you want to know the scripture take over here at Revelations 10 and said in the hour the time of the the last Angel the seventh angel seventh messenger am begins to sound the mystery of God is finished the restoration back to the word the Bible said that this messenger of the last days would be restore them back to the original Faith again back to the faith of the father but do you think they receive it no sir last days he would restore the original word again as said in Malachi 4 but she had forfeited now she forfeited that word at NAA e forfeited in Eden Eve rejected hers a Calvary and Nas's group is rejecting it in the last days that's the same M but when the word came in human flesh she Eve the Hebrew Church mother of all Spiritual Living at then she rejected it she was so dead in her traditions and dogmas that she missed it so is this one exactly all right they miss him the Living Word manifested In the Flesh by the word that is Promised the word promised to do these things the promise was made that it'll be like this in the last days amen as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now watch what happened to Sodom as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man watch what happened then see now I said it be the same thing and we live in that day well it could be I guess I could get 600 Promises of them like that out of the scripture just referring to it see now but they rejected she held to her Diss and substitute and stood of the the sheld to the substitute blood instead of the real blood uh Jesus the word said when it was manifested to her because she help to these Traditions Jesus the manifested word said to the bride Hebrew bride because you hold to your Traditions you make the word of God without any effect to you it can't be effective now now that's what's the reason today that the the Revival that we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we have had a real stir no no no oh sir don't think we got Revival we haven't oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere the the bride hasn't had a Revival yet there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up he'll send it he promised it why now she was she was dead and now if the churches would forget their Creeds and forget their dogmas and just take the Bible plead the promise then it would come effective to him but see Jesus Jesus said you with your Traditions make the word of God not effective to you well that's the same thing today with spiritual Eve see the spiritual bride of today so-called the church she takes the word of God and she won't accept it and she accepts dogmas instead therefore the word's not affective to her because she tries to inject her Creed with the word and it won't work now what we need today uh just keep reading this sh heral of his coming across the headlines we need a prophet to return we need a prophet to return and I guess when he does return they'll know nothing about it that's right it's always been that way we need everything you talk about we need a prophet to return who will bring the word of the Lord Fearless we be the Bible promising uh I know brother brother more eating his house and everything else the editor and he's the finest man walks and Sho Lea I guess one of the finest see he knows that we got to have that and Sister Moore one of the finest women little poor little fell they sacrificed and that's one of the best papers on the field in my opinion is the herald of his coming but you find out they keep blasting that we need a prophet we need a prophet see that's what they talk about and then here we are today and like yesterday and today announcing on the radio that in the Baptist churches and so forth that we're not to take in with the Catholics but we're to kind of fellowship with them and right you're the message going out right here to stay away from that poison how could you walk together L they be agreed light and dark can't Fellowship together when light comes in dark goes out okay most powerful you can't put light out with dark but you can put dark out with light that's right and he is the light and he is the word there you are right straight back you can't make it lie or do anything wrong it comes right straight back to the spot again yes sir it's just like some guy start try to fuss with you if you know where to stand know what he believes it's just like taking a rabbit and turning him loose in a pen and you got every hole stopped up you st the gate he's got to come back he have come right back to the gate again cuz that's the only way he can get out he'll stick his head to here and almost break his neck go over there and over there can stand watching he come right back that's that's the only way you stay with that word you can Bast all around your Creed just break your neck everywhere but you got to come right back to [Music] this now see they they they they don't want it they don't want God's word because she held her tradition she kept the word of God from being of non effect the same now on spiritual Eve she don't want she wants to keep her traditions and get away from the word of God she holds uh again to the denominations and her Creeds and traditions of her Elders instead of taking the word of God and when the promise of the praise His name

much to be thankful for so much to bless his name for and I was listening to something yesterday on the radio just really really touched me it was a super athlete that was being interviewed and this was a super athlete that was a swimmer and and the climbing World they have this Seven Summits that's kind of the the the the peak no pun intended of of of that sport it's Mount Everest and six others that they want to they conquered the Seven Summits and so this was a swimmer that was a distant swimmer that had there's seven oceans it includes the Brit British Channel um one of them's from Los Angeles over to Catalina Island they're all 20 to 30 m swims and so they were talking to him about one of the swims that he did and it was um over near Japan and it was a it was a swim that should have taken about eight hours to do and it just talking about the adversity that immediately started as he was getting ready to launch off on the swim he got caught up in some some waves and kind of threw him up and he beat up his you know knees and his hands like the start of it but he's you know I just feel like I have to do this still today my sponsors are behind me so he set off for the swim and he started swimming an hour 2 hours 3 hours go by and he just times he felt like he was Treading Water he say just you know these foot waves that are going you feel like you're never really catching the water sometimes you're just catching air as you're swimming so he got about halfway through what he thought and he asked the people in the boat he say you know how much further is it he said well we're showing 5 hours okay well we we'll keep going it's taking a little longer than we thought goes another hour what are you showing now we're showing five hours another hour of swimming we're still showing five hours he just realized he just been caught in this little whal pool just this Little Edie that just just sucks you into it you don't realize it but if you keep doing the same thing you're just going to stay there and so somebody in the in the boat said you got to spr Sprint and he's like I've been I've been swimming for 7 hours and I got to Sprint yeah you got to Sprint so he does he goes into the Sprint mode and he was able to get out of that pool that he was in and continue on towards the goal and he says then you know the sun sets you're swimming in total darkness he says there are times you see something large swimming underneath you you know you've got you don't know what it is but it's it's something that could uh they're giants that are in path is what they are but he just he kept his mind focused and 16 hours twice the amount of time it should have taken he he reached the goal and and then they you know that's just how how can you overcome that in your mind and he says well I always travel there's a couple of boats that are with me when I'm when I'm there and he says on one of the boats he says that's kind of my you know the one that I have to have there and he says on it he said you know sometimes I have friends that are on there that are cheering Me on he says but a lot of times he says I'm imagining my loved ones that maybe you know Grandpa that's gone on and some others that are standing there and and are just encouraging me and he says I'm just I'm I'm doing it for them and I just couldn't help but think you know we've got a Heaven's grandstands are full this morning and just saying come on come on keep going you're stuck in this little pool but give it your all this morning give it your all sir and they're just encouraging just come on you got to keep fighting you can do it you can do it and just thinking of that and just you know what we do have we've got whatever we need to imagine but just imagine jesus' face with his

we could turn and do responsive reading it's Matthew 1238 if we could do that together I'll read the first in and the you do the second we'll read the 42 Al together Matthew 12: 38-42 Matthew 1238 then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered saying Master we would see a sign from thee for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth Al together the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold it greater than Solomon is here can you say Amen I've been listening to brother Billy's testimony he said brother brandom's gone he said but the Lord Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and now brother Billy's gone but Jesus is the same yesterday today forever and love to serve him let's sing the theme song as we go to the tape only [Music] be [Music] only all things are possible let's only believe only believe only be [Music] believe all things are possible [Music] only amen you can be seated I our Crowds Are small we're going to try to to hurry up get out so we can working for this one purpose for you to recognize the presence of Jesus Christ see if he is present then while everything's settled he made the word he's here to confirm it he proves that he'll confirm it he's just the same yesterday today and forever we seen him do it last night infallibly we see him night after night and day after day and year after year never one time has he predicted anything regards to when it was when would happen out the thousands of times of what was perfectly on the dot on time and right how can how many knows that knows the ministry knows that's true not one time regardless how even impossible happened just the same he's God if we could just recognize that take a hold of it and now we just have a short time to be here I think three more nights two more nights in a day after tonight I think Sunday afternoon is a closing service we try to close on Sunday afternoon so the pastors and everybody we don't want to keep you from your church we just want to add more to the church and give you more faith in the god that you serve in your church see and we don't want the doors of the church closed by no means we want you to stay there but we're just trying to help you to encourage you a Revival don't even mean to add more to the church a Revival means to re that what you've already got a Revival I watched one time at the seashore where a wind was blowing and it was just shaking well it wasn't the seashore is the is up Lake Michigan I standing out there watching the waves as it come in and and all that sea was the jumping or the waters are jumping and and the boats are rocking and I thought what is that going on I thought wow the Lake's having a Revival that's it it's jumping and shaking wild these a Russian mighty wind coming down on it I thought well you know what there isn't one more drop of water in it right now than what it was when it's perfectly still no more water in it it's just all stirred up what's it stirred up about you know what the stirring up in the water does washes all the trash out of it up on the bank that's what we need a washing of unbelief out on the bank let the word of God have preeminence this that's what we need a Revival wash all the unbelief out and all the bugs and superstitions and things come out and see that God's still God Amen that's what we have revivals for the Lord help us as we choose this text and read it for tonight may the Lord bless the reading of his word found in St Matthew the um the 12th chapter 38 and to the 42nd verse and my text tonight is the presence of God unrecognized last night we were talking of Jesus being the same yesterday today and forever and seeing that he was the same yesterday today and forever now his presence if he is the same is unrecognized let us read then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered saying Master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said un them an evil and adulter his generation seek after a sign and there shall be no sign given unto it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth the man of Nineveh shall rise in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas's here and the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the Earth the year the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here the unrecognized presence what could these people be thinking of God has always it's been that way every time he come when Jesus was sh the first time he said uh you you whiten and you garnish the walls and the tombs of the prophets and you put them in there see something happens and it passes by and God hides it from the eyes of wise and prudent and reveals it to Bab such as will learn Jesus thanked the father for doing such see it goes right by the people and they don't know it for instance you Catholic people here tonight do you remember a few years ago Jonah Ark in France the little lady that was really she led the Revolutionary in France but she was really a a servant of Christ what did your church do to her burnner at the stake as a witch because she seen visions and was spiritual the Catholic church burned her as a witch at the state because she was spiritual in seen Visions a few years afterwards they found out that that woman was a saint so of course you done great Penance you dug up those priests body that condemned her and burned her and throw him into the river of course that you done great pentant for that for digging up this priest's body now in the days of the prophets what happened they did the same thing they didn't recognize him till they had done come Ministry had finished took out of that the elected and then after they were gone they recognized that they had been a prophet among them Jesus he came to the Earth that endowed within him was the father God I am my father a one my father dwelleth in me it's not me that doeth the works but my father and if I do not the works of my father believe me not now if you notice when he came about one one 90th of the world knew that he is even on Earth at that time and yet the savior of the world and then they never recognized who he was even the church or no one else heart until they crucified him buried and rose on the third day before they ever knowed who he was it comes in and goes out and people does not recognize it until it's passed and they because that it never fits their theology it never fits the time of the day you see what it is they're always living in a glare of another age always the reason they didn't accept Jesus because they were living in the glare of the law and when Jesus came was not contrary to the law but come to fulfill the law well they couldn't accept him because his message wasn't exactly the way they had it all created out and it was called then traditions and they he didn't come according to the Traditions he didn't keep their traditions and really he upset it and tore it up and and done things that was contrary to it in so much as it thought he was breaking up the churches and they couldn't receive him because of his message and we all know today that he come exactly in the line of God's prophecy amen but they didn't know it then and it could happen again and we wouldn't know it I imagine if he had actually appeared tonight it would be so contrary to what we got all figured up on our charts and in our schools and things that be very few would recognize what was going on he said it would be how he come now Jesus being there so scripturally identified by the scriptures and the scribes and Pharisees of that day could not recognize him why didn't they why didn't they do it because they had it figured out some other way that's where Jesus told him search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me amen see now he come exactly with the scriptures but they had it figured out maybe that if he would come uh uh the Messiah would probably do what Moses did or what an Noah did build him an arc or something else but we reason he come the way he did they hadn't figured out in the scriptures with their traditions did not teach them so the people were so confused they didn't know what was going on wonder if that could happen today I wonder if it could be different than what our Traditions has taught us and it could come and something had passed through and we never even know until it's already passed and then it's over that's just about the way it'll come do you know when John the Baptist came on the scene that have been predicted all the way from the book of Isaiah hundreds of years about 800 years Isaiah prophesied I think before the coming of Christ did you know John came exactly the way Isaiah said he would come he come exactly the way Malachi said he would come and even the apostles didn't recognize it one day in Matthew 11 John was was in prison and the apostles uh some of his disciples went over to ask Jesus was he the one or or should they look for another I notice Jesus did not uh give him a book of how to behave themselves how to behave himself in jail or how to conduct his character he said stay around and watch what happens and go show John the things that you seen happen that was the evidence that the he was that word and I remember the word always comes to a prophet we all know that God does nothing without showing it to His prophets that's the reason the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ is the full fullness of Christ right here before it's the book now he'll have to same one someone to confirm that book reveal it open the seals and so forth but as far as any further revelation of Christ is already recognized right here he's the fullness of this of the Revelation now notice never does it fail but the word comes to the prophet look at John standing in the water predicting the prophet that the Messiah was right then among them he said there's one standing among you now that you don't know he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire now remember he was standing right among them the Bible said so and they didn't recognize it one day when Jesus came walking down John recognized him he said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world I watch before he was recognized by anybody he came to the prophet he was the word John was a prophet I remember my old Baptist teacher told me said you know what happened said Jesus baptized John I said I don't think so he said sure John was never baptized he come preaching baptizing nobody was worthy to baptize him Jesus baptizing I said I don't know him one day while in studyed the Holy Spirit revealed it like this see watch watch he walked out of the water he said why comest thou unto me I have need to be baptized to thee Jesus said suffer that to be so watch but thus it is becoming to us behooving us that we fulfill all righteousness John being a prophet knowing the word the sacrifice he was must be washed before presented then he was baptized John baptized him because it's becoming to us that we fulfill all righteousness the word came to to the prophet in the water and then when he was baptized still the people and the Holy Spirit came down not everybody saw it John saw it the angel of the Lord can be right here tonight and maybe one person see it no one else that light that star that come over every Observatory where the the wise man followed no Observatory knows anything about it no one else saw it at all but those wise men because it was far them to see see it amen they saw it it was real to them when the light the pillar of fire smoke Paul down on the road to Damascus he recognized that he was in the presence of God now that Hebrew would have never called any other Spirit Lord besides he know it that was the same Pillar of Fire that led his people out of the Wilderness he said Lord who are you Saul Saul why persecutest thou me he said I'm Jesus Jesus said I come from God and I return to God he was that fire that was in the burning bush that led Moses to the Wilderness and he returned back to that and now here he was on the road down to Damascus was stricken down and all the man was with him they never saw that pillar of f it was so so real to Paul till he put his eyes out and he had to be led down to the street called straight in Damascus he was blind ananas a prophet down there saw a vision went laid hands on him and he received the Holy Ghost and the scales fell from his eyes and he could see again it was so real to him to put his eyes out and yet none of the rest of them recognized it being there could see it so so is it tonight there's somebody sitting right there can bring God on the scene when the other don't know nothing about it amen recognizing God Jesus when he was here on Earth and had fully perform the sign that the Bible said that he would do but they didn't recognize it because it wasn't according to their tradition for that age he wasn't to come and do what Moses did he was to come and be born of a virgin and he according to Deuteronomy 18:15 he was to be a prophet and exactly he did those works and signs the Jews always sought signs they were taught to never to depend on intellectual speeches the Jews know better than that the Greeks taught that but not intellectual speeches but upon signs show us a sign these people want said Rabbi or master show us a sign they want to know and he had already showed them the sign and they wanted a different kind of sign but he could only do the sign of that age so does he today this pouring out of the Holy Ghost is the sign of his appearing amen even in this age as he promised they want a sign and he had given the scriptural sign but they wanted a different sign that's where so many people today is going to be confused you know the Rapture might take place and just think of the sadness of it let me go back to where Jesus or John sent his disciples over to see Jesus if he was the Messiah or not that hour he done many things when he returned back to the disciples to tell John what they had seen Jesus said to those sitting there said what went you out to see in the wilderness what went you out to see when John was preaching did you go out and see a man clothed in white Raymond and so forth or or S framan said they are the in King's palaces they bury the dead and kiss the babies and marry the young and so forth that they don't know the handling of a two-handed sword said what did you go out to see then a reed shaking with any wind somebody some group will offer him a little more money and he'll go to this one in instead of going to the calling of the Lord not John somebody could twist him around and say we'll give you more if you'll uh deny this and take this not John he said what did you go out to see than a prophet he said I say unto you more than a prophet and if you can receive it this is who who the prophet said behold I send my messenger before my face which will prepare the way and that was Malachi 3 where he did it on day the disciples asked and said why did the scribes say that Elias must first come Jesus said he's already come and you didn't know it and they understood that it was John the Baptist those elected Apostles still couldn't see who he was that was the Elijah amen now look you know the the coming of the Lord is going to be a secret coming he said there'll be two in the bed and I'll take one and leave one that's where the the night is two in the field I'll take one and leave on you know there's so many people disappear every day off the face of the Earth that nobody can account for one of these days it might be that people might say well you mean the tribulation of things on us now I thought the church is to go before the tribulation they don't realize and understand that the Rapture could take place and they know nothing about it it's a secret going of the church amen and think people go right on preaching saying they believe they're getting saved and adding in the church and building churches and going on just like they did in the days of Noah and so forth and not know it and the Rapture done pass amen it's already happened and you didn't know it there hundreds of people disappear from the earth and people know nothing about where they went through they can't account for it somebody was going somewhere they never hear from them no more and that could be the Rapture I tell you friends just because that we are members of the church or something like that that doesn't mean too much to us you better buckle up that armor amen you better take that whole word of God and hold on to it and quit this Hollywood acting around here it's got right into the church and it's a shame but Hollywood go just makes a bright light and the church today is trying to compare with Hollywood Christ is not in Hollywood amen Christ is in the individual Hollywood glow Hollywood glares while the gospel glows with humility got in in these great fine fancy places and all this stuff that we see he comes in in humility in form of meekness and gentleness pass right through and if you're acquainted with the word you'll see it he that has an eye to hear Let Him hear what the spirit sayth to the churches thing now now today which was identified he identified himself properly to the Believers that they them who were looking for it look at Peter and Andrew look at Nathaniel no question in his mind look at the woman at the well there was no question but these Pharisees a few days before where our text this tonight saw him do that and then called him be elub a devil The Works have been done they had to answer their congregation so the only thing they could do would call it a evil spirit be Els was a devil like a fortune teller or something and anyone knows that fortune telling is of the devil and they was comparing where he was the word that know the secret of the heart and and proving he he was that Prophet that was to be raised up to us in this day the Redeemer prophet and when he did that the church in that day declared him to be be you see what there was he said you're blind leading the blind amen they won't come in neither will they let them it's under them come in what we want to do today is find out the truth we've got to know the truth is he the same is he here to fulfill what he promised to fulfill search the scriptures and find what he's supposed to do today amen that's the reason that John Wesley or Martin Luther couldn't go on with Wesley's message they organized it that's as far as he could go along come Luther out of Catholic church and he they is a crank to them but he had the message of justification because it was a word of God a promise then they after his death they organized the Luther organization then what happened it got all cuddled up again and according to the scripture there's got to be another church age raise and when it did the Philadelphia Church age raise John Wesley what it happened kept coming Westward all the time and when it happened there was the church age and John Wesley raised up but Luther could not receive it because he already organized to justification he could not accept sanctification then when the wesing organized the way they did and the little branches went off which did Along come the Pentecostal message of the restoration of the gifts none of them can move there's already organized now the pitiful part of it is the Pentecostal so organized amen look at the day we're living in what's promised for this day where are we we've moved on up the pillar of fire moves and the children of Israel move with the pillar of fire or they went back to Egypt we've got to move with the word and today we're getting so slothful the church is getting so whirly so indifferent and so their mind so muddled up with television and we love Susi and some of these old things and staying home that shows where the people's hearts are you can tell them these things are wrong and they think you're crazy what is it lovers are pleasure more than lovers of God all the greatest pleasure I know of is to be to pray until I can realize that I'm in the presence of God and recognize it I think that ought to be the Trill of the church is the presence of the Holy Spirit seeing the god that made the promise standing among us feel his presence and see his word and see it Vindicated it ought to give Faith to make cripples walk blind see death hear dumb speak I stood in South Africa where had some 200,000 people at the Durban Racetrack and when they seen one time that happen like that after explained it to them just a little a mile form and they seen one thing take place of that revealed and 25,000 people was instantly healed at once they taken Seven band loads trucks as long as mere six and 18 wheelers like that and piled them full of old crutches and things heathens that didn't know which was right and left hand the next day Mr Sydney Smith the mayor of Durban called me and said go to your window out towards the Indian Ocean you'll see something you never seen there was the police escort coming down with seven of those big band loads with hundreds of people walking behind it the day before was in the stretchers and cots and carriers that they had singing only believe all things are possible a week before that they were in war with one another native war and there they was walking arm in arm hand in hand why they recognize the god of Heaven had appeared before them in the form of his word we intellectual Americans set they'll rais in the day of the judgment and condemn this generation for what we've seen reminds me of a woman in Lille Kentucky not long ago had a little baby walking around in the 10 cent store and she was doing little things trying to get it to notice and the little baby kept staring straight out and finally she picked up a little bell anything that would ought to attract the attention of a little fellow about that size and she shook the Bell and the little fell just stared right straight in front and she begin screaming and fell over and some of the people come to help her she said oh no it can't be it can't be said what's the matter said the doctor said the baby was better said what's the matter with the baby lady said well it took a spell about 6 months ago that just sits and stares no matter what it is ought to attract the attention of that baby it won't attract its attention it just set some stairs the doctor told me he thought it was better and I brought it down here to pick up little gadgets that ought to attract that child and it doesn't he still sits and stares that's the way the church is getting God shook every promise in the Bible before them still we just sit and stare looking what show me a sign and it's going on all the time right around us bringing the presence of God it ought to illuminate us God made a promise he stands by that promise yes sir after Jesus had so proven his Messiah sign that he was that Messiah yet face of all that show us a sign see they didn't recognize they were staring straight ahead of them it wasn't in them to believe is my old southern mother used to say you can't get blood ey a turnup because he's none there still didn't recognize him so blinded by their Creeds and and and so forth that they had that day they never knew the scriptures of the promise because the Creeds had covered it up their Creeds and traditions of that day had covered up the scripture promise if they had been taught according to the scripture that that was supposed to be the sign that followed the Messiah how many believe that he come in his right sign sure he did he come according to the promise but they have been taught a Creed we believe in this and we believe in that all of them believe in God all of them today we Americans especially we think that we're going to be excused because we build big churches and have fine pastors and things remember if that was so God's unjust if he takes us in like that for Cain and Abel the two first worshippers outside of Eden they build an Al to the Lord both of them made sacrifice both of them offered gifts both of them prayed but one was right and the other was wrong notice we must have the truth and the truth is God's word always now now the same today people become so blinded to say I say are you are you a Christian or I belong to certain certain things see that don't have nothing to do with it I ain't got nothing against that but that's not what I'm trying to tell you belong to any church you want to your brand don't make any difference I was telling a pastor this morning up in Colorado used to ride round up and so forth and I used to sit there my leg across the saddle like that and the troubles River uh Herford Association grazes a troubl from River Valley then you got up the top of the valley you got the the East and West for all the cattle from here up in the association grazes the West Fark and and the group that I was with graze the East Fark then they had the drift fence there to keep the cattle off of the private property and up into the mountains through the summer and we'd round the cattle up four or five different brands eight or 10 different brands on the river would round up our cattle in the spring take him up there and I used to sit there my leg across the Horn of the satellite we got all the cattle is all branded and everything starting to back up on the pasture and the ranger stood there he was counting them as he went through and I noticed there's all kinds of Brands Mr Grimes had the the uh the the Diamond Bar and just above us had the turkey TR we had the old tripod and there different brands went through there but the the ranger didn't notice the brand he noticed the blood tag in the ear there was nothing could go on that pasture to keep the breeding Association that their cattle true to the breed nothing could go on there but a third bread Herford it had to be tagged in the ear by the blood Mark that's way it'll be at the Judgment he's not going to ask me if I was a a Methodist Baptist Presbyterian what brand I have won't mean nothing to him it's nothing but a born again bloodborn Christian of the blood of Jesus Christ that'll be what'll go in nothing less then that will go in now we want to remember remember that now when he not recognized his power is all is always not revealed when he's not recognized no matter how much God standing present you've got to believe it that's all like the woman with the blood issue all them people passing by and all of them stand up saying there goes a rabbi that's the guy that claims to be a Prophet this is the fanatic and all such as that but what happened this little woman had an issue of blood and she had heard about him and when she come down there regardless of what anybody said she recognized who he was and she said if I can only touch His Garment see and when that genuine faith in God became a positive thing to her what did it release it released his power to heal her it touched him in such a way he turned around and told her what was wrong with her and said your faith has saved you what did Faith other stand there might been sicker than she but you see she recognized his presence she know that was her opportunity if we could only do that tonight people if we could only realize that he's appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose that's to release our desires that we have in him to us but we've got to recognize his presence and now how you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest amen not the promised word of moses' age or any the other ages the promise of the word for this age now we find out he went right on and Jas a little fell up there with a dead daughter she he believed what he said was the truth now remember he was a priest and he was forbidden because he' been strictly told anybody that associated with him would be put out of the synagogue well whether he was put out or whether he wasn't he was satisfied that God was present in Christ and that was the word amen what did it do it release to him the resurrection power that was in him amen brought forth a girl that was dead and laid out because he recognized that God was in Christ and his presence was in his house but in the city where he was brought up at that same power was in him in the city where he was brought up at but uh they never recognized him his presence to them didn't mean nothing maybe some fanatic where is these things they tell me that you do so and so let me see you do them here haven't you heard that if there you bunch of Pentecostals and you people of you believe in Divine Healing here's so and so over here let me see you heal him that's that same old Evel the same one said if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread the same old devil when he had his eyes covered up he hit him on the head with a stick and said now pass the stick one to the and said tell us who hits you and we'll believe you if you're a prophet you never you don't clown for anybody amen same one when he was on the cross said if thou be the Son of God come off the cross and prove that you're the Son of God he could have done it they paid him the greatest tribute he ever had there but they didn't know it they said he saved others himself he can't save if he would have saved himself he couldn't have saved others he gave himself so he could save others they didn't recognize the presence of God that's all now it releases the power to heal and what it'll release the power to open your eyes to recognize him or blind your eyes so you'll never recognize it what opens the eyes of one Clos the eyes of the unbeliever but the city they didn't have no confidence in him at the Pharisees house he invited him down at Simon a Pharisee and he made a great supper and Pharisee wanted to prove to him he was no Prophet so he was back there toasting with his glasses and his goblets and all the fine perfumes in the house and Jesus had got in past the foot wash flunky and had sat down here and dirty the stink of the the field on him where the animals have been along the path and his garments that's the reason they worh feet in them days and you see the first thing when you're invited to to home there in Palestine when they wore those sandals the first thing they did was to wash your feet and then give you something to walk on their carpets the great Persian rugs and things was beautiful and next thing they done they they give you some oil in your hand it's got out of a little apple it's found way in the mountain a rose Apple after the rose is gone it leavs the apple and fine perfumes and they they rub it over their face and that direct raise of the Palestinian sun is horrible and you see that pru an odor and and then when you do then the host comes to the door and he kisses them on the neck and makes them welcome how did them flunkies ever let Jesus get by without washing his feet or or giving him oil to anointing himself or even kissing welcome but there's a little prostitute out on the street all them religiousness there now the whole company did not recognize him and a little woman of ill Fame she looked in through the perhaps the gate and she seen him sitting like a Wallflower that's the way he is today amongst a bunch of religionist too a Wallflower unwelcome unwanted filth dirty Holy Roller they call him some kind of a a person that is in the right mind a fortune teller telepathy or some kind of an evil name but Jesus I'll get to it in a few minutes said speak a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven you but when the Holy Ghost has come to do the same thing one word will never be forgiven you but there that little woman SE needed service and she rushed in real quickly went and got an albaster box full of oil probably bought it with the money from her prostitution but what was it she might have thought he is a he is a prophet but I remember another woman in my fix another character like mine she had the opportunity she recognized him and she was forgiven up there at the well of SAR last night we talked of it and if I can only get to him I know who he is I'll do him a service if the rest of them I don't care what they do I'll do him a service I recognize he's the son of God she running she got real close to him and she felt so guilty that's her way a real pent of Sinner feels in his presence guilty and the tears begin to fall and she's trying to hide him and dropped on his feet she's go to anointing but the tears dropping on his feet and she began to wipe him and crying and and him with her hands and and his feet was all getting mused up with the dirt that was on it and and if you want to really believe it with a stink of the animals off the trail every one walked the same Trail and there it was the stink on him sitting there and her tears was dropped on his feet and she was trying to wipe them off and she had an old towel what is a woman's Beauty and honor is her hair that's the reason many of you women today cut it all off that's wrong she she tuck her hair and began to wash the his feet and wipe him her the her pretty hair taking the stink off of him upon herself bearing his reproach oh my that's when you recognize who's in your presence our sisters would have to almost stand on their head to get enough hair to do that so we there she washed his feet and wiped him with the hairs of her head and she kissed his feet and there old Simon standing back there said oh I can just see him blow up he didn't recognize who he was said I told you he wasn't a prophet if he was a prophet he' recognize what kind of a woman that is around him Jesus never moved a foot he just watched her and she was scared then after he got through she doing the service to him he looked over said Simon I've got something to say to you you invited me here you brought me here in other words a trump up his sleeve you want to show me off you want to prove that I wasn't what I am and you when you brought me here you should have had my feet washed but you never you should give me oil to anoint my head but you didn't you never kiss me welcome and this woman ever since I've been here has washed my feet with her tears and wiped him with a with her hair and constantly has kissed my feet since have been here I have something against you Simon then he turns to her I just imagine seen her stand there in her big pretty eyes all stained up in her face worse that grease and and dust off of the road on her face and she thinks now have I done wrong have I done wrong he said and I say unto her her sins which are many what was it she recognized she recognized her opportunity see she did it she did him a service the Pharisees didn't do it she he saw it and she recognized his presence and what did it do it washed what did it release to her forgiveness released to her forgiveness of her sins what did it do also it also released the power of God to show to them unbelievers that he was a prophet he know who she was amen it also released joy and power and eternal life it released that but the one who called CA a great huge nail to be droven them precious feet he never recognized the presence of God in him he also wanted to do some cheap trick for him some entertainment that's what the world wants today is a bunch of entertainment don't want the gospel they want to be entertained and S pilate said uh I'd like to desire some miracle from him or something like that bring him up here right in the presence of God and turned it down because what that he appreciated the the opinion of the public more than he appreciated having the opportunity to be in the presence of God what happened the woman was forgiven and given eternal life but he lost his mind and went inan and committed suicide by Drowning himself up in switzland now car so carried away with the poer opinion of that day that he was a BLB he just a make belief it wasn't really nothing to him he what did he do he forfeited it he forfeited his opportunity in the presence of God he could have been forgiven yes he said I have power to crucify you I have power to release you he said you have no powerless it comes from my father he ought to have known if he had know the scripture and him being a Jew should have known that but you see the Traditions had got being taught down that's the way it is today if he had only been taught right if a man had would have believed what the scriptures had said but his tradition got him off of it same as it is today people will take the real gospel where the Holy Ghost is coming in the power and glory of God releasing sinners from sin and making them free and baptizing them in the Holy Ghost and healing the sickness showing signs and wonders and people walkway H you know what my church please that's nonsense see you're forfeiting you're selling your birth rights amen another Esau so many get the same opportunity today to stand in his presence as they did then and still because of popular opinion they turn it down standing in the presence of God I wonder friend tonight if we people who are Christians in his presence and are sick if we don't turn down the opportunity to be healed but just believe believeing him will you claim to believe him don't recognize really his presence what he promised to do today Vindicated by the promise for the day Jesus was rebuking that generation for not believing his Messiah sign we see here he was rebuking him calling him a be elub they wanted him to do the sign of Moses maybe open the Red Sea they did want him to do the sign of David take the throne in the government but the old scripture said that he would do that he was to be a Prophet he's coming the king he was to be Prophet then and he done the sign that God said he would do in them days and they still was wanting him to do some sign that pleased them and I just wonder if we're not looking too farward ahead for something that's right by us wonder if it could be the same way if we could pass by our opportunity remember as the old types the types can never break the last sign According To Jesus he said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the days when the son of man not Son of God now when the son of man is being revealed look here where it's setting today friends I could tell you some things here was not right for me to tell you but it would startle you I want to ask you a little question while we stop before we continue on with this service just a few minutes I wonder if I could ask you this anyone knows that the world positionally everything's set in order for his coming earthquakes in diverse places the moon spitting out red blood or red volcanic all over Covenant as Jesus said watch for that sign in the last days sea a roar man's heart failing for fear and perplexed of time distress between the Nations look at the perversion on the move today look at it a 40% increase in California of homosexuals natural affections already lost amen look at all look at today how the people will stay home and call themselves Christians and listen to such characters as Pat Boon Elvis Presley Ernie Ford and those who sang hymns on Sunday and look at them things that look at them kissing them women and things out there when no man should ever kiss a woman till he's married to her that's male and female glands Crossing will it be wherever it may be it's wrong it's potentially a sex act when male and female glands touch it's a sex act it's a man kiss a man in a mouth and make him vomit or a woman a woman why is the different it's a it's sex act potentially that's right a type of Christ kissing his bride you should never do that but look at today all these movies and things if one big con glamor of kissing and hugging it's absolutely almost public adultery everywhere and the people so blind they don't see it amen that's right everything's in a Sodom condition sodomite everywhere is the Bible said so many things look at this days what he said would take place look at the promises that he made would take place this day and then examine it of what's going on and see where we're at then you see whether he's still in his word or not they wanted to see the sign of Moses It's The Sign of David that was not for their age it was promised for Moses age and them age the promise for this age has to come to pass he had clearly showed them he by the scripture and invited them to search the scripture to see what day they we're living in he's doing the same thing right now search the scripture you who believe the Bible what's supposed to take place right here before he's coming look at the world in the position now that's the world look at the church where it is look where it's at Falling Away lukewarm lady OA putting out the word whole thing going into the big Council of churches the World Council of churches forming the mark of the beast which a Bible proclaims is wrong and all those things and yet the Protestants driving right into it headlong not knowing the scripture their tradition oh they're wanting a a a a Power Man and they'll go to get one they'll see that they get it he had look but Jesus had perfectly declared himself exactly who he was and it proved to them who he was and his age and the same thing today now look at let's take that setting of Luke 17 as it was in the days of Sodom look at the world look at the church a sodomite condition look where lot was at when those men even tried to tried to press in the door to these angels these men notice look here there has look Abraham was up on the mountain he wasn't in Sodom that's a type there's always three classes of people in a religious gather Believers make Believers and unbelievers always them three and there they was there's the unbelieving sodomite the make believer a lot and Abraham the elected church now watch their Messengers in that day two Messengers went down and preached to Sodom they didn't do any Miracles only just smot him blind the preaching of the word does that but watch what kind of a miracle this Angel did that stayed with Abraham amen he had his back turned and told Abraham his name had been changed called him Abraham instead of Abram he could not have the baby till his name was changed neither Sarah he told him what their name was the angel told him that and he said and he was going to visit Sarah according to the time of life and Sarah laughed about it and when Sarah laugh the man with his back turned a man eating flesh of the calf and drinking the milk from the cow and eating bread a man dust on his clothes a traveler was God himself and Abraham recognized it because he knew the thoughts that was in Sarah's heart behind him he said why did Sarah say within herself how can these things be is anything too hard for God and Sarah run out and tonight he said yes but you did now he' have tucked Sarah's life right there but for the dis but see she's a part of Abraham and our unbelief and his great manifestation in this hour We're part of Christ you just see he he has to keep it now notied there has never been a time in history of the church age and I know of one real student I'm talking to a historian there's never been I asked any student of the Bible to tell me one man that was ever sent to the church age in this church since the crucifixion of Christ a worldwide Ministry that his name ever ended up with h m like a b r a h until this day amen sanky finny Moody Knox Calvin but wherever was there gr a m the four Billy Graham the great evangelist out there with the denominations is in Sodom Hallelujah never there's a modern old Roberts out there with the Pentecostals the same thing you know that amen but h a m now g r a h a m is only six letters but a b r a h a m is seven letters six is man's number man's organization man's doing but a b r a h a m is seven letters now notice in the church Church elected is pulled out not those denominations but the elected churches stand out it's to get a messenger too in this last days amen what's going on down there what's going on up here compare it with what Jesus said never be for in history as we ever said and the same signs that would be done amen don't you realize friends and recognize it's God come down in the gospel in his people make making yourself known can't you recognize the hour we're living in have we just got ourselves off to clap our hands a little bit play the piano and recite this and and got away from the word you we're that blind to it surely we're not let's recognize the hour that we're living in Peter Nathan and Nathaniel rather in the woman they recognize it they um they they recognize his sign Messiah sign same now as these things I'm saying then to this age Jesus said now watch He's referring back now telling them of an age God in any age when he sent his message which was his word and identified it to that age the people that believed it it was a great time for him the people who did not believe it went into chaos it's always been like in the days of Jesus same thing watch him standing here now he said as it was in the days of Jonas Jonah for as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and night so much the son of man he said a wicked and an adulter this generation will seek after a sign now you know what I think he was doing he was prophesying a wicked an adulter in his generation I wonder if any man in his right mind could deny that we're not living in a weak and an adulter inous generation when homosexual perversion and the divorce rates in America is higher than any other nation in the world and the whole world's gone into a chaos of it three out of every four nearly is divorced around taking the whole thing around uh in 10 years of marriage see think of it divorce marry again marry again divorce marry again they were eating drinking marrying wives and given in marriage look at the hour we're living in when was it ever in such a chaos oh Wicked and an adulterate generation will seek after sign notice and they will receive a sign amen what this generation for as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and nights the son of man must be in the heart of the earth three days and night what sign will that Wicked and adulterous generation receive the sign of the Resurrection amen and today after 2,000 years we still see Jesus Christ in the power of His Resurrection standing Among Us doing the things that he did then and promised to do a wicked and an adulterous generation will seek after a sign always wantan to show me this and if you can do this do this they'll get it the sign of the Resurrection he's the same yesterday today and forever the word made manifest dwelling Among Us how we should thank God for his great sign notice he referred to something else there he said and as the queen of the South shall rise R up that's the Queen of Sheba listen close now the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold or greater than Solomon is year notice let's refer to that a few minutes he was reading the same Bible we read about Jonah and he's reading about Solomon now when Solomon's Age come on he had a he had a gift of deser and all the people the whole nation believed it everyone was one heart and one Accord everybody believed it if everybody tonight if all America would just turn back to God and believe God it's the best assurance that we have it'll be all the bomb shellers and everything else nobody fool with Solomon they were afraid of him because he was A Gifted Man and the people believed him so he was sent from god Till They made him their King yes all the nations feared him not because of their military power but because God was with them and if this nation who claims to be Christianity if it could only all of them together playing around this great gift that's been given us in this last days of Holy Spirit of God upon the church not the Creed the spirit of God not by power not by might but by my Spirit saith God the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ in form of spirit upon us the same yesterday today and forever making this word live what he said it would do watch closely now all the news went out through the world they didn't have television and radio and things in them days so it went from lip to ear after a while the great Caravans came plumbed down across the Sahara Desert which is a 3 month travel from Palestine down to where where she lived and Faith cometh by what hearing hearing the word of God and she had heard about this great meeting they were having up there and any time a caravan come from that way she' questioned had did you come through Palestine yes oh what about that oh it's it's beyond anything you never seen such discernment and it's just like a god sitting there their God is representing a man called Solomon well Faith cometh by hearing the little queen's heart begin to hunger to go up and find out about it see she was ordained to life notice now the first thing to do now her being a pagan she had to go get permission from her priest to go so I can imagine s go over to a priest and say Holy Father uh I hear they're having a great Revival up there in in Palestine I like permission to go up and see for myself now my child now you don't want to get mixed up and after all we're not cooperating in that Revival so you you you cannot go see that's just a bunch of nonsense there's there's nothing to it then people claim they've come through a red sea and they've done all this there's nothing to it if there was anything like that happening it would be right you're in our church we still got pagans so we find out that she began to hunger she said now look she said they tell me that their God up there is represented in a human being and his wisdom is beyond anything is deser is wonderful oh there's nothing to that she said but I I'm well look you're a queen you can't be Associated a bunch of people like that that's you can't do that that bunch of people knowing all the world is religious Fanatics you can't do that but you see when God goes to dealing with a human heart all right there's nothing going to stop it husband wife children Pastor nothing else can stop it when a person's really hungering for God they're going anyhow so she got ready to make ready well he'd say well I'll just give you I have to excommunicate you from our fellowship well you can just do that I'm going anyhow I'm going to find out for myself about all this and see she brought up Scrolls and she' read what Jehovah should be about His prophets and what he must do how that the word of God would make manifest how it would know these things when it was represented veiled in human flesh what it would do and she' read all these things so um I'd hear him say Well look our book says this he said yes look I my great great grandmother stood in before them same Idols she stood and said prayers day after day there never was one move one mutter or nothing else and I'm tired this old dead Farm I want to go see if there is a living God it's too bad we Ain got more of them queens today so she got ready to go now when she come to this spot where she must go now remember she had a great difficulty it wasn't as easy as it would be to you now notice what she had to do here's another thing I don't want to leave out she said this I'm going up there and I'm going to take some money I'm going to take some gifts and if it is the truth I'm going to support it if it isn't the truth then I can bring my money back that woman could teach Pentecostals yes sir support things out there laugh and make fun of Divine Healing and yet you support the radio programs instead of your own church that's right life and make fun of the very things you believe in but she said I'll take it and if it isn't right I can bring it back I remember with all this wealth on there on these camels and now remember the fleet Riders of ishma was Desert robbers is out there what an easy thing would have been for them to fall in on on this prey and why they would have kill them few Unix was with her took that money and been gone but there's something about it when you are really determined and God's revealing himself you're determined to see Christ there's no danger before you you don't even pay any attention the doctor says you're going to die you don't even notice it when you're pressing you know there's something there something down in our heart burning in faith this God months to travel over Sahara desert not in an airconditioned Cadillac no no she took three months across the Sahara Desert maybe traveling by Night reading the Scrolls and always in the daytime until she arrived now no wonder Jesus said she'll stand in the last days and condemn this generation for some of them won't walk across the street and are greater than Solomon is year the Holy Spirit himself no wonder she'll raise in the last days and condemn the generation watch she finally arrived she didn't come like many people some people come to a strange meeting she come and took her camels and went out into the the courtyard put up her tents and she was going to stay there till she's convinced most people will come except maybe 5 minutes maybe 25 soon as an evangelist or somebody says something that's contrary to what she she thinks that her Creed says or her his Creed out they go not even manners no wonder she'll condemn this generation she come to stay till she was convinced I can imagine the first service that morning when the trumpets all sounded Pastor Solomon came out she may have been sitting way back at the bank she said now I'll see for myself I know that's what Jehovah was supposed to be man can make claims but I'll find out so she sat there that day and she watched and she seen everyone coming to the platform she seen that discernment was perfect finally let's say her prayer card was called which probably wasn't but her time come to come before Solon and the Bible said that when she come to stand before Solon that God let Solon know all her Secrets there was nothing hid then the miracle was done on her then she turned to the audience and she said all these things that I have heard is true and it's even greater than I heard about see oh there was more more life left in her her breath was taken from her CU sheer was a man that didn't know her right a stranger reveal the things that she wanted to know oh and Jesus standing there which was more than Solomon he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was a spant born son of God and clothed up on him and Jehovah himself manifested in the flesh amen and Yu was stand there in the fullness and they said they wouldn't believe him a greater discernment see he was Solomon plus David plus all the rest of them was all in him all the prophets was wound up in him a greater than Solomon and to even at that day he said if you speak them words against me I'll forgive you but when the Holy Ghost comes it'll be greater than it is now more condemnation and here we stand today seeing that very same God do the very same thing amen I believe she'll rise in the day of judgment and condemn this generation because she repented and believed the message that Solomon was preaching and believed on God she's seen something real you know what's the trouble today there's people many people with a people that's belongs and just go to church and have a Creed see they've seen so much just fault so much just statues and so much of big fine buildings and and we let's not let's not never get off in that kind of a tantrum see God don't dwell in big buildings he dwells in your heart amen see God don't dwell in intellectual education he's far from it he dwells in humility in your heart he dwells in his word and his word comes into your heart and speaks itself out and de he interprets his own word through you he's trying to find somebody and get a hold up to show that he's still God and he's he'll do that if he can just get somebody he can speak you if you can get another woman with a blood issue he can still speak the same thing he can still do the same thing making no and declaring we're in the presence of God not recognize it reminds a little story I might have told it to you once I don't know to Bear right now as you all know I I hunt big game and I was up in the Northwoods used to go up there hunting all the time and I had a friend up there named Burt call he was a fine Hunter about a half Indian never had to worry about him he wasn't going to get lost and we really were Chums but that was the wickedest man the heart I ever seen he just had no heart at all he used to shoot little fawns that's little baby deers just a make me feel bad and he'd say all you preachers you're chicken hearted Billy you'd be a good Hunter if you wasn't a preacher I said you're too chicken-hearted I said Bert that's not chicken harded now it's all right to kill a fawn if the law says so Abraham killed a calf and fed it to God it ain't the size of it or the sex of it but it's just to be evil with it and he would just shoot them pawns and just laugh make laugh because I felt bad about it well now he he did that and one year I went up there and he invent himself a little whistle and he could blow like a little fwn hot calls you know for his mama and so he said hey Billy before we start this morning said I want to show you something I got and he showed it to me I said B you wouldn't use something like that he said oh get next to yourself and a fell had eyes is like a lizard like some of these women try to paint their eyes you know like that he all look at me them lizard looking eyes and I it almost scared me and um and I said to Bert don't do that he said oh you chicken-hearted preachers so we was August a little late getting up that time and those Northern white tail your mule de here he'll walk up to you but not one of them guys whenever he's been shot at he's a you talk about Houdini being The Escape Artist he's an amateur to them so it was late and they' been shot at and them deer would hiding down feeding it night in the Moonlight and bedding out in the day we walked all the way up Old Jefferson Notch clb up to Mount Washington was about 6 Ines snow on the ground good tracking weather never even seen one track he said what do you think Billy I said you all scared them all out of the old machine guns you're shooting and so we went on after a while about 11:00 we always carried a a little one of those thermos bottles full of hot chocolate it's if you get hert or something other that's stimulation and a sandwich so it's about 11 11:30 I suppose we come to an opening about the size of this Arena here this building and um no Timber so he just kind of sat down set his rif up against the tree started reaching back here and I thought he was going back to get his to get his thermos spot I thought well we'll eat usually we get up top of the mountain and eat and one go one way and one another and come back and we know the way around good and if we got a deer we just hung it up then we know went help each other get him in so I thought he just going to eat his lunch and we'd park because he was almost up the timber line so I he reached back and I started getting for my thermos bottle get my chocolate and started getting out like that and he pulled that little whistle out of his pocket and he gave it a big blow like that looked at me with them lizard looking eyes again and blowed that whistle and when he did just about far as across this building a great big dough stood up now if some of the our sisters might not know the D is a mother deer and see that whistle was a baby and it cried and this big door stood up right about 11:00 in the day anyone hunts deers knows that's a bad time they're bedded so she stood up and looked around I could see just this plane he looked back at me and he blowed again and instead of of running she walked right out into that open now that's unusual they won't do that any hunter knows that and they and they won't do that but she walked out there why she was a mother that was a baby it was it just borned into her to be a mother and that baby and Bert looked down pull that bolt back let it down on that 306 and he was a dead shot I see him level down like this and I know he'd blow her faithful heart Plumb through both sides 180 grain mushroom bullet and I thought how can you do it Bert how can you be so evil to call that mother deer right out there and then shoot her heart right out of her and her trying to find her baby how can you be so brutal as to do that I was thinking that and I seem level down like that I could I couldn't look at it it's just too much I guess I am chicken harded I just turned my back I thought God how can you do it how can a human being be that mean to do that just to shoot that poor faithful mother's heart right out of her now she was wasn't trying to act on she wasn't putting on a show she was a mother she seen the hunter when he throwed that gun down but did she run no sir her baby was in trouble and she was trying to find her baby I turned my back as I said and started I said Lord God how can you do it I noticed it waited waited the gun didn't fire I turned around and looked the gun was going like this he couldn't hold it no more he turned around that big old lizard eyes had changed tears had run off his cheek you threw the gun on the bank you said Billy I've had enough of it lead me to that Jesus you're talking about amen right on that snowbank I led him to Christ why he saw something real he saw something genuine if they hold the their piece of rocks will cry out that Mother wasn't putting on nothing she was a Janu wine mother no matter if it was death or what it was she standing right in the face of death nor just any minute that bullet would blow through her heart but she was after her baby oh if we could only be as much Christian as that deer was a mother why she was born a mother she was born to be a mother we are born to believe the word of God we are born to believe Jesus Christ can you say Amen this morning amen I trust you're recogn recognizing your day and the message amen lot of nuggets there this morning so appreciated that and we cut it short of course for time but if you have any doubts just listen to the balance of that message and as he does those discernments and things it should help us recognize who is speaking and you recognize it doesn't matter what he says brother Kurt you just believe and move on and he said you better buckle up that armor appreciated that this morning he said search the scriptures and find out he's supposed to what he's supposed to do today amen he said move with the pillar of fire with
