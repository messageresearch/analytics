[56:57] seated what an honor to be back here
[57:00] with you all
[57:01] again and uh it was just here last
[57:06] November and I I thought about it when
[57:10] first I kind of wanted to come on a
[57:11] little fishing trip I thought maybe I'll
[57:14] come do a little fishing and go fish
[57:16] with brother Israel
[57:19] and with
[57:22] uh have a little time with them
[57:25] and
[57:27] uh uh thought about that and and then
[57:30] Aaliyah called up she said well Grandpa
[57:32] if you can come around this time and I
[57:34] say she's got a a week off so I said
[57:36] yeah maybe I can work it out I I try to
[57:39] get Liz to come with me and she didn't
[57:41] want her to come because last month we
[57:43] were in we went to Mon and we had some
[57:46] fellowship there with the
[57:48] Believers and what a wonderful time we
[57:50] had and the Lord really blessed us and
[57:53] some of the churches came came together
[57:55] and my what a time we had just a
[57:57] wonderful time so she says well I she
[58:00] didn't feel like coming she wanted to
[58:02] stay back home couple little things and
[58:04] I said well Levi might be able to
[58:05] convince her because Levi when he talks
[58:08] you know it kind of pulls on her heart a
[58:09] little bit and he tried and she didn't
[58:11] and so I came alone but I'm happy to
[58:14] come and see them and to see Levi and
[58:17] Kisha and Le I'm so happy to see them
[58:20] and God richly bless them amen and I we
[58:24] had a the ministers meeting yesterday
[58:26] and my brother George was there and some
[58:28] of you how many of you were there at the
[58:29] ministers meeting I know brother Randa
[58:30] was there or just couple of you oh the
[58:34] Lord already blessed us and the brothers
[58:36] really enjoyed it and my quite a lot of
[58:39] positive comments after and thank the
[58:41] Lord for
[58:42] it and this morning I went to Brother
[58:45] kaleb's church and my it was a little
[58:47] different but my what a blessing we
[58:49] really I enjoyed it I really thank the
[58:52] Lord and He told me he said you come
[58:55] back to to son he said even if I have to
[58:58] wrestle with Israel he said with brother
[59:00] Israel he says I'm going to wrestle with
[59:02] him to get you to come back
[59:05] here but the Holy Spirit was there and
[59:08] we really certainly had a wonderful time
[59:11] um I I went to Brother Amando and oh my
[59:14] what a friend he's just such a bosom
[59:17] friend you know sometimes you cross
[59:18] paths with people in this life and it's
[59:20] just different amen and you meet friends
[59:22] you meet people but then it's put a b
[59:24] poor used to say he said they were
[59:26] friends and they were special friends
[59:28] and I really think you know I look at
[59:29] you all like brother George sitting here
[59:31] and many of you sitting here but Amando
[59:34] and all of you your special friends of
[59:35] course when I think about brother Israel
[59:37] and Sharon is more than just you know
[59:39] what it is it's part of the family see
[59:42] so we certainly thank the Lord and I not
[59:45] because he's my son-in-law but I really
[59:47] believe it all my heart I've seen how
[59:49] the Lord has worked in his life through
[59:50] the years and I really believe that
[59:53] you've got a true true Minister I
[59:57] believe that with all my heart amen and
[59:59] sometimes you might do things you might
[1:00:00] not agree maybe you might think a little
[1:00:02] bit it should be done a little bit
[1:00:04] different but you know it's the way that
[1:00:07] you know you have to do what you know in
[1:00:08] your heart the Lord leads you and of
[1:00:11] course we certainly thank the Lord and
[1:00:13] uh I heard this say that there's some of
[1:00:16] the Spanish speaking people that would
[1:00:17] probably need some translation is that
[1:00:20] all right everything is being arranged
[1:00:22] it's been arranged okay good because the
[1:00:24] subject we're going to go into I do
[1:00:27] believe with all my heart of all the
[1:00:30] times that I've stood at the poit and
[1:00:32] pre this has got to be one of the most
[1:00:34] important subjects I've ever brought to
[1:00:37] our
[1:00:38] church and brother brandham called it
[1:00:41] the highlights of his entire
[1:00:44] Ministry and if the Lord Jesus will come
[1:00:47] down here tonight to speak to you and I
[1:00:49] sitting in the meeting and would tell us
[1:00:52] that he's bringing us the most important
[1:00:54] message message of this entire age we
[1:00:57] will want to spend particular attention
[1:01:01] to listen to it so tonight what we have
[1:01:04] before us now I want to warn you of
[1:01:06] something and it is the truth I thought
[1:01:08] maybe a part of it I'll be able to share
[1:01:10] with you today and brother Israel told
[1:01:13] me well we'll be back here on Wednesday
[1:01:14] night and then I'll probably get back
[1:01:15] with it on Wednesday night I was going
[1:01:18] to brother Mando's church I was kind of
[1:01:19] tempted but I said Lord what you will is
[1:01:21] and then you know he put something else
[1:01:23] in my heart because I kind of hesitated
[1:01:25] to bring this because of the fact that
[1:01:27] there's so much material in it so much
[1:01:30] to be able to delve into it and the
[1:01:33] parts of that are so important for the
[1:01:35] church I do believe at this time but um
[1:01:39] it's just like at the Ministries Mee and
[1:01:40] I had to purposely put aside from
[1:01:43] certain areas certain quotes and
[1:01:45] scriptures and stuff I had I had to
[1:01:47] purposely pull aside and didn't even
[1:01:49] mention it because just say something to
[1:01:51] the brothers and they begin to pull and
[1:01:53] one brother St on look at shook his head
[1:01:55] like this and said to me you can't leave
[1:01:57] us like this you know and they wanted to
[1:01:59] know and of course you know the pull is
[1:02:01] there and the needs are there and the
[1:02:04] love of God is there and we want to know
[1:02:06] and you know and I certainly I feel it
[1:02:10] Deon quite a privilege and an honor that
[1:02:13] you know in different parts of the world
[1:02:15] and to the congregations I've gone in
[1:02:17] different places that God has being with
[1:02:19] me and used me to be a blessing and like
[1:02:22] I told the brothers I never want to come
[1:02:24] into a congregation and create confusion
[1:02:26] and divisions I have never been guilty
[1:02:28] of dividing nobody's Church in my life
[1:02:32] I've just tried my best to preach unity
[1:02:35] and stuff and wherever I've gone to be
[1:02:37] able to even have a church that I Pastor
[1:02:40] is in regions where the message was
[1:02:41] never even heard of and God used my
[1:02:44] Ministry there and this is not to
[1:02:46] reproach other brothers of any type but
[1:02:49] this is how I you know the Lord has led
[1:02:51] me to sense I fell the court of God in
[1:02:53] my heart and even going into the
[1:02:55] overseas churches in Africa and
[1:02:57] different places where of course you
[1:02:59] know I met brothers and they love me and
[1:03:01] have a lot of confidence and today I
[1:03:03] step into some of these countries and
[1:03:05] the pastors and stuff will come and it's
[1:03:08] just been good to see the love and I
[1:03:10] feel in my heart if God in his love and
[1:03:13] mercy could use me to be a blessing then
[1:03:15] that's the greatest thing I can do and
[1:03:17] I've always told of people even Mark
[1:03:19] home that you know and it's a strange
[1:03:21] thing but it's the truth of and I'm not
[1:03:24] saying this the song humble I'm saying
[1:03:25] it because of the truth I don't want to
[1:03:27] take too much time on this because we're
[1:03:28] going to get to the word and some of
[1:03:30] them shake their heads and you know in
[1:03:32] unbelief when I say it but it's the
[1:03:34] truth and I told him I says you know
[1:03:35] I've seen ministers that could stand the
[1:03:37] Propet and they're real preachers I mean
[1:03:39] they can preach when I sat in meeting
[1:03:42] brother George and I shook my head and
[1:03:43] said Lord I don't have the gift like
[1:03:46] those brothers and the only thing I have
[1:03:48] is when the anointing comes and that's
[1:03:50] what makes the difference and that
[1:03:52] anointing could take me up and I could
[1:03:54] you know and I see whole thing connect
[1:03:56] together and I remember I I went to
[1:04:01] to Rapid City in South Dakota a several
[1:04:04] years back and uh brother dondon before
[1:04:07] he went to meet the Lord you know this
[1:04:09] this a whole story I W have enough time
[1:04:11] to even get into it to share you I had
[1:04:13] to go to Rapid City to see him it was
[1:04:15] important to see him before the Lord
[1:04:17] took him home and in going into Rapid
[1:04:20] City one night I remember driving from
[1:04:22] winipeg
[1:04:24] with two brothers went with me and I
[1:04:27] drove 14 hours from Winnipeg to Rapid
[1:04:29] City got in there about 4:00 in the
[1:04:31] morning and then I fell on my knees and
[1:04:33] on my knees while I was praying and this
[1:04:35] is something that you should think about
[1:04:36] you who are sitting here Satan came to
[1:04:39] me and brother George in A Moment Like
[1:04:41] This he showed me all my faults yeah and
[1:04:44] my past life and all the mistakes and
[1:04:46] all the things what I did it wasn't
[1:04:48] right and I went into it I began to move
[1:04:51] into that I began to think yes Lord it's
[1:04:53] true I I did this and I did that and
[1:04:56] when I did that when I when my mind got
[1:04:58] on myself and what I did and what I I
[1:05:00] you know then the anointing of the Holy
[1:05:02] Spirit left me and it happened a several
[1:05:05] times in my life a couple of times in my
[1:05:07] life and I think God wanted to if I
[1:05:10] would sit like this excuse me in the
[1:05:12] sweet language you would use God wanted
[1:05:14] to really teach me a lesson to show me
[1:05:17] what I was doing was wrong and sometimes
[1:05:19] God let things happen to show you what
[1:05:21] you're doing is wrong and I went to
[1:05:24] Brother when when that anointing left me
[1:05:26] I went to Brother Dixon's
[1:05:28] church I said brother duxon I said
[1:05:31] please I said I don't feel good I says
[1:05:33] is it possible you could take the
[1:05:35] service and me not preach he says what
[1:05:37] he says me take the service he said
[1:05:40] people have made sacrifices to come all
[1:05:42] the way to Rapid City he says we've been
[1:05:45] waiting here for years to have you come
[1:05:47] he says you got to preach I said Lord if
[1:05:50] I had I'm not exaggerated when I say
[1:05:52] this If I Had a Million Dollars in My
[1:05:54] pocket and I could have give it to him
[1:05:56] and tell him don't let me preach I would
[1:05:58] have done it because I got on that P and
[1:06:00] I took some of the notes some of the
[1:06:02] best notes I could find and try to
[1:06:04] preach and that anointing was not with
[1:06:06] me and I saw a couple maybe two or three
[1:06:10] couples get up from the PO from the
[1:06:11] church and walked out and I knew in my
[1:06:14] heart I couldn't blame them for for
[1:06:16] leaving because it was not their fault
[1:06:19] it's just that I was fumbling all over
[1:06:21] the place I couldn't get the things
[1:06:23] together the anointing was not with me
[1:06:25] so I begged the Lord and the next day
[1:06:27] was a Friday night then brother dson
[1:06:29] scheduled three services say Lord a four
[1:06:31] Services r one in the Pentecostal church
[1:06:33] out there and the Saturday night I says
[1:06:36] you know what I'm going to spend a whole
[1:06:37] day in prayer I says maybe the Lord will
[1:06:39] Hear My Cry and he sent back that
[1:06:41] anointing I fell on my knees at brother
[1:06:44] Dixon's place and I was praying and
[1:06:46] while I was praying the phone rang
[1:06:48] because brother duxon said well I'll
[1:06:49] leave I said brother DX I'm not going to
[1:06:51] know where with here I'm going to stay
[1:06:52] here and pray said all right he left the
[1:06:54] house I was praying the phone rang and
[1:06:56] when the phone rang it was a sister
[1:06:58] calling brother duxon and she told
[1:07:00] Brother duxon she said I hear it on the
[1:07:01] in to come she's left it leaving the
[1:07:03] message for brother duxon she said
[1:07:05] brother dixen the reason I'm calling you
[1:07:07] is because last night she says my
[1:07:09] husband is very sick he's been sick I
[1:07:11] don't remember how long she said for how
[1:07:13] much months or whatever and she says
[1:07:15] last night I had a dream that brother
[1:07:16] Ferguson prayed for my husband and the
[1:07:19] Lord healed him so when I heard that
[1:07:21] news then I felt even worse so I said
[1:07:24] Lord please please Hear My Cry I I
[1:07:29] Promise You Lord I ain't going to do it
[1:07:30] again I'm going to keep my eyes on my
[1:07:32] faults I'm going to keep my eyes on your
[1:07:34] goodness and your love and your mercy
[1:07:36] Lord now I want to ask you a little
[1:07:39] question before I get into the message
[1:07:42] tonight brother talked about the face of
[1:07:45] Cain because last night yesterday I
[1:07:47] talked a little about that in the
[1:07:48] meeting for the ministers reading but
[1:07:50] there's something else I want to share
[1:07:51] with you have you ever come to church
[1:07:53] church and feel really sad and
[1:07:58] broken I'm going to ask you a little
[1:08:00] question how many of you in the meeting
[1:08:02] here could raise your hand and say I
[1:08:04] come to the church really sad and
[1:08:06] broken how many have had that experience
[1:08:10] you're really sad yeah all of you you
[1:08:13] know what brother bam said of that that
[1:08:15] sadness that you have in you when you
[1:08:17] come to church hinders the anointing of
[1:08:20] the Holy Spirit coming upon you to give
[1:08:22] you the to open your eyes to the word it
[1:08:24] hinders
[1:08:26] it you got to pray and ask God to take
[1:08:28] that away amen because to enter nothing
[1:08:31] to sadness sometimes you could be broken
[1:08:34] because a Christian could be sad because
[1:08:35] his disappointments and things and at
[1:08:37] the same time rejoicing KN that the
[1:08:39] devil steal that
[1:08:40] Joy don't let that happen to you and
[1:08:43] when that happened to me I was broken
[1:08:47] inside and I couldn't see I couldn't see
[1:08:50] the joys of the
[1:08:52] Lord and when this say said that I went
[1:08:54] back that Saturday night to the meeting
[1:08:56] and the anointing was not there and the
[1:08:58] meeting was terrible and at the end of
[1:09:01] the meeting the sister came up some of
[1:09:03] the people left even and I didn't blame
[1:09:05] them I did not blame them some sometimes
[1:09:07] you see people in the ministers blame it
[1:09:08] is the fault of the people no I had to
[1:09:10] be honest I knew it was my
[1:09:12] fault and the Lord was showing me
[1:09:14] something and then the the the the the
[1:09:18] sister came up for me to pray for her
[1:09:19] husband and her husband came up he was
[1:09:21] sick and the anointing came back and I
[1:09:23] prayed for the man and he was healed
[1:09:25] right there and after he was healed the
[1:09:26] anointing left
[1:09:30] me and then I
[1:09:32] learned not to keep my eyes on myself
[1:09:37] but to keep my eyes on
[1:09:39] him his goodness his love his Mercy what
[1:09:42] he is now tonight I could spend a lot of
[1:09:45] time on that but I'm not going to go in
[1:09:46] that direction we not going to talk too
[1:09:48] much about that I have something else I
[1:09:49] want to share with
[1:09:51] you and this is the greatest message
[1:09:56] that brother Bram ever
[1:09:59] preached now some people might disagree
[1:10:03] hold on I'm going to bring going to
[1:10:04] bring you the quotes hold on I'm you
[1:10:06] think I'm going to stand here and make
[1:10:07] those statements just coming from me cuz
[1:10:09] some people will brother Ferguson every
[1:10:11] message he preached was very important
[1:10:13] that is
[1:10:14] true but there were some things he
[1:10:15] preached that was far more important
[1:10:18] we'll get to that we'll delve into it
[1:10:20] tonight and we'll see the importance of
[1:10:22] it okay now I warn you I will not be
[1:10:25] able to finish this message tonight in
[1:10:28] fact I've had a series back home of
[1:10:30] about three to four services and was
[1:10:31] never able to completely finish it
[1:10:34] because of the different parts in here
[1:10:37] and this what the Holy Spirit has been
[1:10:38] opening up to me and what he has let me
[1:10:41] see so now I
[1:10:43] am I'm going to ask you all to stand at
[1:10:47] this
[1:10:49] time and we will bow our heads for a
[1:10:51] word of prayer together
[1:10:54] let us pray Lord God Of Heaven thank you
[1:10:58] Lord we are conscious that your presence
[1:11:00] is here with
[1:11:01] us we are nothing
[1:11:04] Lord and we don't want our eyes to be
[1:11:06] upon
[1:11:07] ourselves even our faults and our
[1:11:10] mistakes we don't want our eyes to be
[1:11:13] upon the troubles and trials of this
[1:11:15] life we want our eyes to be totally
[1:11:18] completely fixed in you and father we
[1:11:21] can't do it on our own because there's
[1:11:24] so much to attract us Lord as your
[1:11:26] Prophet tell us so many voices crying
[1:11:28] for attention but father help us now
[1:11:31] that we can lay aside all these things
[1:11:33] Lord and consecrate upon you and now I
[1:11:36] call upon you for a special anointing
[1:11:39] for this church and a special anointing
[1:11:41] Lord upon me that I'll be able to bring
[1:11:43] to be a tool in your hands to be able to
[1:11:46] bring this to your people that it will
[1:11:48] be a blessing to all of us we pray and
[1:11:50] we thank you in Jesus name
[1:11:54] amen now we will go to the
[1:11:57] scriptures and I will take now I have to
[1:12:00] do it this way I'll read for you just
[1:12:01] one or two scriptures and then I'll have
[1:12:04] you you'll have to afterwards I'll let
[1:12:06] you sit because many of the scriptures
[1:12:08] I'm going to be bringing here in the
[1:12:10] quotes I have to bring it as we go
[1:12:12] forward in the service a little bit like
[1:12:14] what I did at the ministers meeting
[1:12:16] yesterday so I'll just read one or two
[1:12:19] scriptures for
[1:12:21] you and and then we will
[1:12:25] um we will we will go into the word now
[1:12:29] I want to read from John chapter 12 just
[1:12:32] one single verse here John chapter 12
[1:12:34] and verse
[1:12:39] 25 John chap 12 and verse
[1:12:44] 25 he that loveth his life shall lose it
[1:12:48] and he that hateth his life in this
[1:12:52] world shall keep keep it unto life
[1:12:57] eternal and I want to read another
[1:13:00] scripture found in 1 John chapter 5 so
[1:13:04] we'll just take two of the scriptures
[1:13:05] and then we'll set after 1 John chapter
[1:13:08] 5 from verse
[1:13:09] 8 and there are three that bear witness
[1:13:12] in Earth the spirit the water and the
[1:13:16] blood and these three agree in one if we
[1:13:19] receive the wickness of man of men the
[1:13:22] wickness of of God is greater for this
[1:13:25] is the weakness of God which he had
[1:13:27] testified of his son he that believeth
[1:13:30] on the Son of God had the weakness in
[1:13:33] himself he that believeth not God he
[1:13:37] that believeth not not God had made him
[1:13:40] a liar because he believed not the
[1:13:42] record that God gave of his son and this
[1:13:45] is the record that God has given us
[1:13:48] eternal life and this life is in his son
[1:13:52] he that had the son had life and he that
[1:13:55] had not the Son of God had not life
[1:13:58] these things have I written unto you
[1:14:00] that believe on the name of the son of
[1:14:03] God that he might know that he have
[1:14:05] eternal life and he might believe on the
[1:14:07] name of the son of God lord god of
[1:14:10] Heaven as we come now under your
[1:14:13] anointing of your Holy Spirit which we
[1:14:15] promise which you promis to send upon us
[1:14:19] we pray father God that you will take
[1:14:20] everything now from our minds and then
[1:14:23] the Holy Spirit take the word of God and
[1:14:25] feed it to all of us we pray in Jesus
[1:14:29] name amen amen all right God bless you
[1:14:32] all you can be seated now we're going to
[1:14:36] go straight into it okay because
[1:14:40] sometimes you know we drift here and we
[1:14:42] drift there and we go here no we're
[1:14:44] going to go straight into it
[1:14:47] tonight okay and I'll start by reading
[1:14:50] for you a quote and then we'll go to
[1:14:52] certain scripture
[1:14:54] so I'm start by reading you this is a
[1:14:56] quote from the message
[1:14:58] desperations and brother bam says
[1:15:01] here he said this morning the message
[1:15:04] this morning was to me the highlights
[1:15:07] message of my entire
[1:15:11] Ministry this morning see a highlight
[1:15:14] message of my entire
[1:15:17] Ministry someday I'll tell you how it
[1:15:19] come about now if we think about all the
[1:15:22] message me he
[1:15:25] preached he preached on so many
[1:15:27] different types of
[1:15:28] messages but he's telling us that this
[1:15:30] year is the highlights of his entire
[1:15:33] Ministry listen close now someday I'll
[1:15:37] tell you how it come about and I know
[1:15:39] that
[1:15:41] everything has worked for months and
[1:15:43] months and months up to that one message
[1:15:47] moving up to come to that place so
[1:15:49] everything brother gram says everything
[1:15:52] the different messages different things
[1:15:54] has worked for months we could see it
[1:15:56] here and months and months up to that
[1:15:59] one message moving to come up to that
[1:16:01] place and then he goes on to say that
[1:16:03] was the capping off time of it you see
[1:16:07] so this message cap it off what was that
[1:16:11] message what was that message that he
[1:16:13] preached that was the C
[1:16:16] of what was it come on
[1:16:18] Church no many people don't
[1:16:21] know it was the token message could we
[1:16:24] say that together the token so the token
[1:16:28] was the highlights of his entire
[1:16:31] Ministry and things works for months and
[1:16:34] months and months and months working up
[1:16:37] to
[1:16:41] that now why was it the
[1:16:44] highlights what is the what is it in the
[1:16:46] token that made the token so so
[1:16:51] important like I told you all if Jes
[1:16:53] Jesus Christ would come down here
[1:16:54] tonight and would tell you all I'm
[1:16:57] bringing you the Highlight message of
[1:16:59] this entire age won't we want to pay
[1:17:02] attention to
[1:17:05] it then brother brandom goes on and
[1:17:08] here's what he says he says now I'm sure
[1:17:11] or hope that you got what the token
[1:17:14] meant see the token is the sign that the
[1:17:17] blood has been applied now here's the
[1:17:22] problem many Christians and many people
[1:17:25] around the world that hear the token
[1:17:27] that's all they know they just know that
[1:17:30] the token is a sign that the blood has
[1:17:31] been applied but let's go a little
[1:17:34] further so the token is the sign that
[1:17:37] the blood has been applied that the
[1:17:39] price that's being asked required of God
[1:17:43] Jesus Paid that price by shedding his
[1:17:45] own blood all of that is the token Jesus
[1:17:49] Paid the price by shedding his blood all
[1:17:51] of that is the token let's go further he
[1:17:54] did that then from his
[1:17:58] life came the Holy Spirit and when the
[1:18:02] blood is applied to you the holy spirit
[1:18:05] is a token that your price is
[1:18:08] paid God has received you and that's the
[1:18:15] token so what is the
[1:18:20] token what is the token that the token
[1:18:23] is a price that has
[1:18:25] been paid the token is the Holy Spirit
[1:18:30] the token
[1:18:33] is that he says and when the blood is
[1:18:36] applied to you the holy spirit is a
[1:18:38] token that your price is being
[1:18:40] paid
[1:18:42] God has received you amen amen and that
[1:18:48] is the token now I want to slow down
[1:18:51] just a little bit bitty bit bitty bitty
[1:18:52] bit on this don't want to spend too much
[1:18:54] time here because this could take us a
[1:18:56] lot we can go into all of this a lot we
[1:18:59] could take the whole night and just talk
[1:19:01] a little bit about God receiving you now
[1:19:04] there's two phases to it that's very
[1:19:07] important one is first you receiving
[1:19:11] God but if you say all right I have
[1:19:14] received and I believe that God has
[1:19:17] forgiven me of my
[1:19:19] sins okay I have received the message
[1:19:23] I have received the word of God I have
[1:19:27] received all these things even if you
[1:19:29] open your heart and you receive all
[1:19:32] those things it is not
[1:19:36] enough I'm not hearing a lot of amens
[1:19:38] well that's all
[1:19:41] right is it enough that you accept the
[1:19:44] Lord Jesus Christ that's what the bapti
[1:19:47] preach all you have to do is accept the
[1:19:49] Lord Jesus Christ no sir there's more
[1:19:51] than that amen
[1:19:54] amen yes sir
[1:19:56] amen I'll read it for you
[1:20:00] right he says what more brother
[1:20:03] Ferguson is there anything more than me
[1:20:07] you and I accepting what Jesus Christ
[1:20:09] did for us at Calvary yes there's
[1:20:11] something
[1:20:15] more and many people doesn't even know
[1:20:18] that there's
[1:20:20] more that's the sad part that's why I
[1:20:22] tell you we can a lot of time here but
[1:20:24] I'm going to have to touch this and move
[1:20:25] away quickly because this is not really
[1:20:27] really my message what I really want to
[1:20:29] bring to you but are we just touching it
[1:20:31] amen so you can touch it and just move
[1:20:33] away quickly here's what brother randam
[1:20:35] says here in the message God's provided
[1:20:37] way he says
[1:20:40] here and that blood was shed for us and
[1:20:44] we have got to accept that that's
[1:20:46] wonderful that they can project that
[1:20:47] quote for you we've got to accept that
[1:20:50] and then just by accepting it wouldn't
[1:20:54] only
[1:20:56] do God's got to vindicate back that he
[1:20:59] has accepted you now the token the token
[1:21:05] is not you accepting God it is God
[1:21:09] accepting
[1:21:10] you it's just like if I would if you
[1:21:13] would pray and I would pray and we would
[1:21:15] ask God for certain things the most
[1:21:18] important part of a prayer is not you
[1:21:21] making a prayer to God the most
[1:21:23] important part is when God answers your
[1:21:27] prayer amen when God answer your prayer
[1:21:30] that's where I talk to God and God speak
[1:21:34] back to me God give me the answer but
[1:21:37] what is most important it's not me
[1:21:39] speaking to God it's God speaking to me
[1:21:43] that's why oh just you see you see
[1:21:45] what's happening to me now it's putting
[1:21:47] me in it's putting me in that direction
[1:21:49] I got to pull back that's why in the
[1:21:51] Bible you have two fa of this you've got
[1:21:54] a priest and you've got a prophet okay
[1:21:57] now the priest is the people to
[1:22:01] God you've come to God you've got your
[1:22:04] sacrifice you've got your needs a priest
[1:22:07] is an intercessor you to God me taking
[1:22:11] my intercession to God me giving my
[1:22:14] offerings to God that's a priest
[1:22:17] amen but a prophet is God speaking to
[1:22:20] the people amen
[1:22:25] you see it it's two phases in the in the
[1:22:28] word of God a priest and a prophet a
[1:22:31] priest the people to God we're
[1:22:34] interceding a priest is an inter
[1:22:36] intercessor we're interceding to god
[1:22:39] father father we a priests too we a
[1:22:41] priests so we go before God lord I need
[1:22:44] this but then a prophet you see the
[1:22:46] prophetic the prophet is God speaking to
[1:22:49] the people amen and the Lord says thus
[1:22:52] say the Lord the Lord says the Lord says
[1:22:54] the Lord
[1:22:59] says
[1:23:01] oh what a blessing now to move away from
[1:23:05] this
[1:23:06] quickly so and then just by accepting it
[1:23:09] wouldn't do God's got to vindicate back
[1:23:12] that he's accepted you that's the thing
[1:23:14] you can accept him but then if he
[1:23:16] accepts you stay right there until he
[1:23:19] does accept you amen amen and when he
[1:23:24] accepts you what does he do and then
[1:23:26] when he does he sees you into his
[1:23:28] kingdom by the baptism of the Holy Holy
[1:23:30] Spirit then you have you secure until
[1:23:33] the day of redemption that's right now
[1:23:36] what brother brandom goes on to say is
[1:23:38] this
[1:23:41] here
[1:23:43] okay he goes on to say this now he's
[1:23:47] talking about the token he says now we
[1:23:49] have sometimes allowed it the Baptist
[1:23:51] allowed it to accept it in the word
[1:23:53] accepting Christ as personal savior
[1:23:55] that's exactly what we say that's what
[1:23:57] the Baptist
[1:23:59] said and in this message we still have
[1:24:01] some of that Baptist Doctrine cing
[1:24:04] around people said as long as you accept
[1:24:06] the message you have the Holy Ghost that
[1:24:07] is not
[1:24:09] true amen come on church that's Baptist
[1:24:17] Doctrine the lutherans allowed it to
[1:24:19] accept in the word accepting Christ as
[1:24:21] personal savior the Methodist says when
[1:24:23] you get happy enough to shout that's it
[1:24:25] the Pentecostal said speak in tongues
[1:24:27] then you got it we find out that all of
[1:24:30] it was wrong

[1:24:55] through you and it's for the rich the
[1:24:58] poor or for whosoever will receive it
[1:25:00] Hallelujah brother bam continues then
[1:25:03] the life that was in Christ is the Holy
[1:25:05] Ghost amen amen not the third person but
[1:25:08] the same person in the form of the holy
[1:25:10] of the Holy Spirit coming upon you as a
[1:25:13] token that your life and your fire is
[1:25:15] paid you have been
[1:25:20] accepted thank you Lord MH now when God
[1:25:24] accepts
[1:25:25] you and tonight we may not be able to
[1:25:28] get into that that part of it I'm going
[1:25:30] to hold that back probably for Wednesday
[1:25:32] when God accepts you he gives you a
[1:25:37] confirmation that he has accepted you
[1:25:39] amen but now we we we wouldn't we may
[1:25:42] not have enough time to go into that
[1:25:44] tonight and probably on Wednesday night
[1:25:46] we'll be able to talk about that
[1:25:47] confirmation that God gave that he has
[1:25:49] accepted you but now let's move a little
[1:25:51] bit further further into our
[1:25:55] message uh brother mam continues
[1:25:58] here he
[1:26:00] says until that token comes you're not
[1:26:03] permitted on the highway you're not
[1:26:05] permitted on the bus line you're not
[1:26:06] permitted to go in until you can present
[1:26:08] this token and that token is your fair
[1:26:11] and now it shows that the blood that has
[1:26:14] been shed and being applied to you the
[1:26:17] price is being applied to you and you
[1:26:19] have the token that the blood is applied
[1:26:22] to you and you are
[1:26:26] accepted
[1:26:32] my yes sir before that you're not
[1:26:35] allowed forget the Rapture forgot all of
[1:26:39] it you're not allowed but now you've
[1:26:41] been accepted now what is the
[1:26:45] token the token is a
[1:26:48] price paid yes let's say it together the
[1:26:52] token is a price paid that's being
[1:26:56] paid the token is the Holy
[1:27:03] Ghost the token represents that God has
[1:27:07] accepted
[1:27:08] you the token is the life of
[1:27:11] God now let's think about this to see
[1:27:15] why it's so
[1:27:16] important and I'm going to shift a
[1:27:18] little bit now to go now to a scripture
[1:27:22] and so we will go to the Psalms because
[1:27:24] brother bam used the psalm for
[1:27:27] this and the psalm he used was Psalm
[1:27:30] 63 and brother said this Psalm puzzled
[1:27:33] him he couldn't understand what David
[1:27:36] was speaking about so we go to Psalm 63
[1:27:40] yes okay now I'll I try to to take my
[1:27:44] time tonight and move into it in steps
[1:27:47] so that you can get it yes sir and trust
[1:27:50] the Lord that you wouldn't miss any of
[1:27:52] it it because it's the most important
[1:27:53] subject we could talk about all right
[1:27:56] now in Psalm in the Psalm 63 from verse
[1:28:01] one we go back here in the Psalms in the
[1:28:05] Psalms okay are you with me and
[1:28:08] sometimes I might pronounce things a
[1:28:09] little different to you and stuff you
[1:28:11] know I remember even Sharon corrected me
[1:28:14] when she was a little girl on my
[1:28:15] pronunciation which was fine and marata
[1:28:18] love to perct me but Daddy this is not
[1:28:21] the way she she does it yet sometimes
[1:28:24] and she just loveed to
[1:28:25] correct and sometimes um uh Gracie
[1:28:30] corrects me and
[1:28:33] sometimes even even my little little
[1:28:37] daughter the Naomi corrects me sometimes
[1:28:39] but no Daddy it's not this way that's
[1:28:41] the way it's supposed to people WR all
[1:28:43] right praise the Lord so so even if you
[1:28:46] want to correct me on my pronunciation
[1:28:47] that's fine Brother Billy Paul used to
[1:28:49] do it all the time and I was with him
[1:28:51] and Brother Joseph and brother David and
[1:28:52] all of them they correct me all the time
[1:28:54] see and I don't know maybe it's just me
[1:28:56] amen all right now let's get here into
[1:28:58] Psalms
[1:29:00] 63 now David here in the psalm is saying
[1:29:04] oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek
[1:29:07] thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh
[1:29:11] longth for thee in a dry and thirsty
[1:29:14] land where no water is to see thy power
[1:29:18] and thy Glory so I as I have seen thee
[1:29:21] in the uary because thy love and
[1:29:24] kindness is better than life my lips
[1:29:26] shall praise thee thus will I bless thee
[1:29:29] while I live I will lift up my hands in
[1:29:33] thy name now um I want to stop here to
[1:29:38] get to what brother brandham said about
[1:29:40] this to show you why that token is so
[1:29:44] important because it represents the Life
[1:29:46] of Christ now brother Brandon
[1:29:50] here and
[1:29:57] ah excuse me
[1:30:04] here
[1:30:07] yeah brother brand here talking in the
[1:30:09] message thirsting for Life here's what
[1:30:10] he said about that he reads the psalm
[1:30:13] because thy loving kindness is better
[1:30:15] than life my lips shall praise thee and
[1:30:18] here's what he says he says when I first
[1:30:21] read that
[1:30:22] I thought it was an unusual text to take
[1:30:26] and God is unusual and God does things
[1:30:29] unusual unusual things and when I read
[1:30:32] it I wondered what David must have been
[1:30:35] speaking about when he said thy love and
[1:30:38] kindness is better than me than life I
[1:30:41] waited that out wondering just what
[1:30:43] could be better than life if we should
[1:30:46] take a trip tonight and go up into the
[1:30:48] heaven and I'll meet with Abraham with
[1:30:51] father Abraham and I'll say Abraham what
[1:30:54] is the most glorious thing that you have
[1:30:56] ever known what is the most essential
[1:30:59] thing that you that you have ever known
[1:31:02] Abraham will say to me life
[1:31:05] eternal then I'll take a little trip and
[1:31:08] we'll go again we'll go to the great a
[1:31:11] Archangel Gabriel who is the messenger
[1:31:13] of the Covenant to the Jewish people who
[1:31:16] stands at the right hand of God one of
[1:31:18] the highest order of Angels in the
[1:31:20] heaven and I will say to him Gabriel
[1:31:23] thou are a mighty angel you are loved of
[1:31:26] God and you've been here for aons of
[1:31:28] time and you perhaps know everything in
[1:31:31] the heavens and where everything is
[1:31:32] placed because you are one of God's
[1:31:34] right hand angels and you know the great
[1:31:37] secrets of the heavens you sounded the
[1:31:39] trumpet at the at at the coming of the
[1:31:42] Lord Jesus you announce his first coming
[1:31:44] and you shall announce the second coming
[1:31:46] amen I wish we had time to go into
[1:31:49] that this BS me for years
[1:31:52] is and it was just a couple of weeks ago
[1:31:55] brother George that I found the answers
[1:31:57] in the message hidden hidden in the
[1:32:00] message and I couldn't preach on this
[1:32:02] Gabriel here and what what Ro does
[1:32:04] Gabriel play in the second coming of the
[1:32:07] lord we better not go into that don't
[1:32:10] pull on me on that the church back home
[1:32:12] was pulling and now I I promis myself
[1:32:14] when I go back I'm going to share with
[1:32:16] them for the first time in my life
[1:32:18] because I found some stuff that I I
[1:32:19] didn't even know it existed and I found
[1:32:21] it and I got the quotes I have it and I
[1:32:24] don't have to add anything it's exactly
[1:32:26] what it said and I could go forward
[1:32:29] now amen wonderful isn't he you see here
[1:32:33] is the key when we wait upon the Lord
[1:32:36] and I waited for years and couldn't
[1:32:38] understand I wouldn't preach on it
[1:32:39] because I didn't understand it brother
[1:32:40] man what role does Gabriel play how are
[1:32:43] the announce the second coming of the
[1:32:44] Lord how is
[1:32:46] this this Mighty Angel anyway let's not
[1:32:49] go into that please don't even pull on
[1:32:51] me I'm I didn't even bring my notes with
[1:32:52] me on that and I'm trying to preach on
[1:32:54] it at all because I've never preached on
[1:32:56] it I just shared some of it with the
[1:32:57] meeting I had with some of the sisters
[1:32:59] the whole group of sisters we had a
[1:33:00] meeting and they asked me and I shared a
[1:33:01] little bit with them on the quotes on
[1:33:03] that so now let's get away from that
[1:33:06] quickly why' you even say anything huh
[1:33:09] why' you even say anything about it well
[1:33:11] I have to sometime you know I have to
[1:33:13] say sometime because it's it stirs a
[1:33:15] little bit of thirsting him a little bit
[1:33:17] but it it it'll pull us off of our
[1:33:19] subject I know but I gotta that's what
[1:33:23] the Fe On The Church says brother
[1:33:25] Christian what are you doing to us but
[1:33:28] that stirs you a little bit amen but
[1:33:30] maybe another time if the Lord willing I
[1:33:32] get back here I like to share those
[1:33:33] course with you and share some stuff
[1:33:35] maybe we see what happened because
[1:33:37] Wednesday we won't probably go here
[1:33:38] we'll see what happen you pray and we'll
[1:33:40] see what the Lord does because don't
[1:33:41] forget he answers prayer
[1:33:44] see all right now brother Bram goes
[1:33:48] on okay he says Gabriel thou a mighty
[1:33:51] angel Angel you love the God okay he
[1:33:53] goes on here he says and you know the
[1:33:55] great you announc the first coming and
[1:33:57] you shall announce his second coming so
[1:33:59] you must be a mighty man or a mighty
[1:34:02] Angel my I want to ask you in all I
[1:34:06] smiling when I'm reading this it's
[1:34:08] pulling me I know you're pulling here
[1:34:09] but please let's not go into this part I
[1:34:12] don't have my quotes I have not with my
[1:34:14] quotes with me so I don't want to go in
[1:34:17] into it because it takes us into another
[1:34:18] Direction it will take me all night it
[1:34:20] take me you understand I can't I can't I
[1:34:22] can't put it together so don't let's
[1:34:25] just don't pull don't pull all right I
[1:34:28] can see I can see it on brother George's
[1:34:30] face I can see it on brother Amanda's
[1:34:33] face I can see it on many of few faces
[1:34:36] but that's all right now brother B goes
[1:34:38] on he says You must be a mighty man or a
[1:34:41] mighty angel I want to ask you in all of
[1:34:44] God's
[1:34:45] Treasures what is the greatest thing
[1:34:48] that you have found among his treasures
[1:34:50] I could see get abrel bring himself to
[1:34:52] attention and say the greatest thing
[1:34:55] that I have found in God's Treasures
[1:34:56] since he created me is life God made me
[1:35:00] to live for Eternal for eternity and
[1:35:03] life is the greatest thing there
[1:35:08] is all right brother B goes on now
[1:35:12] there's nothing seemingly any better
[1:35:13] than life okay what could we estimate
[1:35:15] this morning would be better than life
[1:35:17] but David said thy love and kindness is
[1:35:19] better than life now he Wonder then the
[1:35:22] word life must have a compound
[1:35:24] meaning it must mean more than one thing
[1:35:28] life itself means an
[1:35:31] existence so then if thy loveing
[1:35:33] kindness is better than life then what
[1:35:35] could be any better because God alone
[1:35:37] has eternal life God alone has eternal
[1:35:40] life if we could get that straightened
[1:35:42] out it would be easy for us to see the
[1:35:44] great picture of God sets before us that
[1:35:47] someday everything that isn't of God
[1:35:49] will perish and go away
[1:35:52] all right brother brandom goes on I have
[1:35:54] a question for you now it's not a trap
[1:35:58] it's brother George believes it's a trap
[1:36:01] please trust me it is not a trap okay
[1:36:07] sometimes it's TR there trap questions
[1:36:08] Sharon but this is not a sh a trap a
[1:36:12] trap question Ayah listen to
[1:36:16] it when did you receive eternal life did
[1:36:20] you always com
[1:36:26] it if your name is written in the book
[1:36:29] of life eternal yes but did you always
[1:36:32] have
[1:36:33] it
[1:36:35] found yes but did you always have
[1:36:46] it
[1:36:48] huh
[1:36:50] silence and
[1:36:51] a death in
[1:36:53] silent now I don't blame you to be
[1:36:58] silent if I was in your position I would
[1:37:00] be silent
[1:37:04] too now didn't we have a predestinated
[1:37:08] seed in our
[1:37:11] hearts amen well when did we have
[1:37:16] life I'll share with you
[1:37:19] tonight when we got life
[1:37:22] and I'll be honest with
[1:37:25] you I haven't even gotten into the main
[1:37:27] part of the message
[1:37:29] yet we still building the
[1:37:32] platform but let me deal with this with
[1:37:35] this because people don't know when they
[1:37:38] imagine people get life and they don't
[1:37:39] know when they got the
[1:37:41] life so excuse me I don't blame the
[1:37:45] people because even me me me myself
[1:37:47] didn't
[1:37:48] know because God does things you see see
[1:37:51] it's the way that God operates and
[1:37:52] brother Bram speak it in the message
[1:37:54] things that are to be you see God does a
[1:37:57] certain thing and then later on he
[1:37:58] shares with you what he did okay it's
[1:38:01] done with it then he show you after what
[1:38:02] he did just like Jesus went to the Cross
[1:38:04] he died he resurrected from the dead and
[1:38:06] after his resurrection his crucifixion
[1:38:08] then he explained to the disciples what
[1:38:10] happened they didn't what it was
[1:38:12] happening they didn't know he explained
[1:38:13] to them after now if I could know why is
[1:38:16] happening it's a huge
[1:38:19] privilege amen that's right but times he
[1:38:21] doesn't let you know what is happening
[1:38:23] it's afterwards he let you know what
[1:38:25] happened just like Jonah back they
[1:38:28] didn't know she was a spiritual woman
[1:38:31] until afterwards then they found
[1:38:33] out and true men of God are not
[1:38:36] recognized for what they are during
[1:38:38] their lifetime they only recognized
[1:38:41] after they have passed away then people
[1:38:43] realize hey that was a real man of God
[1:38:47] but while he's alive to criticize him
[1:38:49] and condemn him and he's wrong and he's
[1:38:50] this and he's that and then after God
[1:38:52] takes him off the scene then they
[1:38:53] realize who was among
[1:38:57] them yes sir
[1:39:00] amen that's why if we pray and ask God
[1:39:02] and God can open our eyes amen you know
[1:39:05] if you think if Sarah knew what kind of
[1:39:06] husband she had in Abraham you think she
[1:39:08] would fuss and argue with
[1:39:10] him she fuss and and argu with him she
[1:39:12] was so angry when the angel when the
[1:39:14] angel came she missed the whole
[1:39:15] visitation because she was not happy
[1:39:17] with Abraham yes right and she knew
[1:39:19] Abraham was you want to ask first with
[1:39:21] him imagine if Sephora knew what Moses
[1:39:24] was you think she would arguing first
[1:39:25] with Moses a husband like Moses if you
[1:39:28] have a Moses are you going to first and
[1:39:29] argue with him well you could have a
[1:39:31] Moses and you don't recognize it
[1:39:34] [Laughter]
[1:39:40] amen just like a man could have a Mary
[1:39:43] and he don't recognize he has a Mary and
[1:39:45] he fiz you with Mary you want to fiz you
[1:39:47] with Mary if you knew she was Mary come
[1:39:50] on
[1:39:52] now see we don't want to go into that
[1:39:54] see we try to you know these things pull
[1:39:55] me in itself and we want to try to move
[1:39:57] away from all of that to pull back to
[1:39:59] what we got here you all understand
[1:40:03] church I feel good
[1:40:06] now all right now let's go into it when
[1:40:12] did you receive life it's important
[1:40:16] know since there's nothing nothing more
[1:40:19] important in life
[1:40:21] in God's economy there's nothing more
[1:40:24] important than eternal
[1:40:28] life and if you would live live your
[1:40:31] whole life and Miss eternal life you
[1:40:33] have lost everything but if you lose
[1:40:36] everything and you gain eternal life you
[1:40:39] have gained
[1:40:41] everything
[1:40:48] wonderful now we continue hey I didn't
[1:40:51] look at the watch when I
[1:40:54] started I remember some of them used to
[1:40:56] tell me not to watch my watch when I
[1:40:57] went
[1:41:00] there I think it's when I went to jasp
[1:41:02] or something they said don't watch your
[1:41:03] watch and they wanted to take my watch
[1:41:04] away from
[1:41:05] me but all right let's continue
[1:41:12] here
[1:41:14] okay no no no no this is
[1:41:17] nice are you
[1:41:19] ready it's in the
[1:41:22] message why

[1:41:30] powerful we try to pull away from all of
[1:41:32] that butam says here he says here he's
[1:41:35] talking about about Moses he says then
[1:41:38] see that he was born with this great
[1:41:40] gifts and quality within him that it

[1:41:49] you all to listen closely because we're
[1:41:51] building into something here tonight

[1:41:57] church in my
[1:41:59] life all right so that's something it he
[1:42:03] said now then see he was born with this
[1:42:06] great gifts and quality within him then
[1:42:09] it only takes something to flash across
[1:42:11] that to bring that thing to life see the
[1:42:14] seed of God is actually placed in us
[1:42:17] from the foundation of the world amen
[1:42:21] right now could you say Amen to that

[1:43:58] the little woman at the well her in that
[1:44:00] condition though she be an illame person
[1:44:03] though her life was degraded and she was
[1:44:05] in that condition because the Traditions
[1:44:08] had never touched her but though when
[1:44:10] that light first struck her quickly she
[1:44:13] recognized it because there was
[1:44:15] something there to respond to it when
[1:44:17] the Deep C it to the Deep there must be
[1:44:19] a deep somewhere to respond that
[1:44:21] call so brother LTI the seed is in US

[1:45:04] 40
[1:45:06] okay you hear some of them in the
[1:45:08] message say life begins at
[1:45:12] 21 and some people say life begins at
[1:45:16] 60 have you ever heard people saying
[1:45:19] that brother him said that's a lie
[1:45:30] yeah you people say oh I started to live
[1:45:33] when I turned
[1:45:37] 30 have you ever heard people making
[1:45:39] statements like that even in the message
[1:45:41] all right it's a I'm going to read it
[1:45:44] for you you see is not brother F yes sir
[1:45:46] amen
[1:45:47] hallelujah that's a li amen
[1:45:54] life begins at the altar amen
[1:46:01] amen that's where life begins eternal
[1:46:04] life when you come to that Jesus Christ
[1:46:08] every promise is yours it's all yours
[1:46:10] it's to
[1:46:11] you so when you
[1:46:14] come and you give your life to the Lord
[1:46:16] Jesus Christ yeah and he accepts you yes
[1:46:21] Life Begins right there now here is
[1:46:24] eternal
[1:46:25] life eternal life eternal life never did
[1:46:29] begin never did end but there came a
[1:46:33] time when eternal life came in
[1:46:36] US amen amen you see we didn't have that
[1:46:41] eternal life before we had the seeds we
[1:46:44] were predestinated to that life amen the
[1:46:47] seed was in us but the light had to to
[1:46:50] strike it in order for that seed to come
[1:46:52] to life and then we have
[1:46:57] life now here is something I want to
[1:46:59] share with you as we deal with life now
[1:47:02] because this is what we want to get into
[1:47:05] life now B Bram tells us
[1:47:10] this
[1:47:12] okay and now we're going to get into
[1:47:14] something here that will interest all of
[1:47:16] us brother brandom tells us this
[1:47:22] are you
[1:47:25] ready now we're getting into our subject
[1:47:29] now brother brandham said this we're
[1:47:32] going to go back
[1:47:34] now in the greatest gift in the Bible he
[1:47:38] says and I couldn't understand what
[1:47:39] David was talking about when I first
[1:47:41] read that I thought what was the prophet
[1:47:44] meaning that your love and
[1:47:47] kindness is better than life what could
[1:47:50] be better than life nothing so I drew
[1:47:54] this
[1:47:55] conception that there must be there must
[1:47:58] be two different kinds of
[1:48:02] life life has a comp meaning it means
[1:48:06] more than one thing so there's two
[1:48:10] different kinds of life right there is
[1:48:13] your life and God's life
[1:48:16] am two different kinds of life amen
[1:48:20] these lives are two different kinds of
[1:48:23] life
[1:48:25] now you
[1:48:28] say now I'm going to go a little further
[1:48:30] before I get deeper into the life
[1:48:32] there's something else I want to share
[1:48:33] with you quickly now I want to ask you a
[1:48:36] little
[1:48:37] question are you ready to go into this
[1:48:39] now Hallelujah is everybody ready to go
[1:48:43] in now all right now what is in you a
[1:48:48] lot of people don't even know what is in
[1:48:49] what is in them yes what is in
[1:48:53] you let's go a little further if we have
[1:48:56] the time tonight the Lord would help us
[1:48:57] maybe if we can get into this part okay
[1:49:00] at
[1:49:02] least brother Brandon tells us here not
[1:49:06] only do you have
[1:49:08] two kinds of Life which we prove to you
[1:49:10] in a little bit that there's two kinds
[1:49:12] of life in you two different kinds of
[1:49:15] life in you now everybody does not have
[1:49:17] two kinds of Life Hallelujah oh my yes
[1:49:22] right it's why you different to the rest
[1:49:24] of the
[1:49:25] people now I'm going to go a little deep
[1:49:27] into it before we go into this deep into
[1:49:29] it I want to share this with you what
[1:49:32] brother brandham says here now I I have
[1:49:34] more quotes on this to life if you want
[1:49:37] I got more than one but brother bham
[1:49:40] says and if there's a a little question
[1:49:44] in your
[1:49:45] mind um there's another one here besides
[1:49:48] this in the message I love and kindness
[1:49:51] we read one for you and then there's
[1:49:53] another one here in the in in
[1:49:58] in
[1:50:00] yeah all right anyway we read the quote
[1:50:04] and we we won't go back on the other
[1:50:06] ones we probably go forward okay is that
[1:50:08] all right I think it's enough so
[1:50:10] everybody could see there two kinds of
[1:50:11] life but now there's another point I
[1:50:13] want to bring to you this is
[1:50:17] nice
[1:50:19] um not only do you have two kinds of
[1:50:22] Life which we'll prove to you in a
[1:50:23] little bit the two kind of life you
[1:50:25] have he says
[1:50:29] here maybe I'll I'll move I'll move away
[1:50:33] from this one
[1:50:34] here and come back to it just a little
[1:50:38] bit Lord help me where is
[1:50:41] that uh yeah here it
[1:50:44] is are you ready now am amen you ready
[1:50:48] yes all right let the Holy Ghost stick
[1:50:51] us into this now amen so we could see
[1:50:53] really what's
[1:50:54] happening now this is
[1:50:56] wonderful okay two kinds of life now we
[1:50:59] get to that just now because life
[1:51:00] there's nothing more important than
[1:51:01] life now brother brandham says this in
[1:51:04] question and
[1:51:05] answers this is a dying spirit in a
[1:51:08] dying body but now you can't be in two
[1:51:12] bodies at one time okay now when I was
[1:51:15] in Africa and those places they believe
[1:51:17] that the wish doctor could come in you
[1:51:18] that's not scriptural amen you cannot be
[1:51:21] in two bodies at the same
[1:51:24] time it's not possible no amen amen but
[1:51:29] there could be two Natures in you at one
[1:51:35] time now the nature of the spirit of God
[1:51:38] when you're born again you're not born a
[1:51:40] physical like the baby was but what
[1:51:43] happened the spiritual Birth has come to
[1:51:45] you so brother Bram said there can be
[1:51:48] two Natures in you you at the same time
[1:51:51] now everybody doesn't have two
[1:51:55] Natures but we as Christians we do have
[1:51:59] two Natures now let's go a little
[1:52:02] further because this is very important
[1:52:03] for you to see
[1:52:05] it and it's what makes us different from
[1:52:07] the W of the people with two Natures in
[1:52:11] US scientists call it they call it in a
[1:52:14] negative way they call it people that
[1:52:15] are bipolar because they seem to have
[1:52:18] two different Natures in them but a real
[1:52:20] Christian that's what makes us it makes
[1:52:23] us what we call strange to the people of
[1:52:25] the world and they think that we are
[1:52:27] bizarre because we do have two Natures
[1:52:29] in us and these two Natures literally is
[1:52:32] an opposition one to the other which we
[1:52:34] would if we have enough time tonight we
[1:52:36] can go into that because that's why I'm
[1:52:37] saving the rest with God showing us how
[1:52:40] we have life for Wednesday night and
[1:52:41] tonight we could probably look a little
[1:52:43] bit into those two natures and those two
[1:52:45] lives that is within us and how these
[1:52:47] things operate according to the message
[1:52:49] and the word word of God and then on
[1:52:52] Wednesday we would look at how God
[1:52:53] proves to us that we have eternal life
[1:52:56] now let's go little further on these two
[1:52:58] natures and these two
[1:53:00] lives now brother bam continues in the
[1:53:03] message communion and this is one of the
[1:53:05] last this is the last message he
[1:53:06] preached before the Lord took him home
[1:53:09] and here's what he says are you
[1:53:10] following me are you able to see it it's
[1:53:12] so simple you have how many nations do
[1:53:15] you have not everybody have
[1:53:18] it but you
[1:53:22] do not everybody have two lies we'll
[1:53:25] prove it to you in a little bit hold on
[1:53:27] I got more quotes we prove it to
[1:53:30] you
[1:53:33] okay communion brother Adam says like in
[1:53:36] the book here and the spot there we was
[1:53:39] talking about the two books being one
[1:53:41] The Book of Life The First Book of Life
[1:53:44] coming up was when you were born that
[1:53:46] was your natural birth see and then one
[1:53:49] time way down in there there was a
[1:53:51] little grain of life as I explained it
[1:53:53] to some of you young sisters at the
[1:53:54] house this afternoon see there's a
[1:53:56] little grain of Life laying there that
[1:53:58] yonder where did it come from what what
[1:54:01] these strange things I was saying this
[1:54:04] talking for myself like you were going
[1:54:07] to say William brandham well 40 years
[1:54:10] ago the William brandham it isn't the
[1:54:12] same one
[1:54:13] tonight if somebody back there would say
[1:54:16] William Brandon he was a rank rascal you
[1:54:19] see because I was born of Charles and
[1:54:21] Ella brandham in their nature I was a
[1:54:23] sinner I came to the world a liar and
[1:54:26] all the habits of the world laid right
[1:54:28] in me but down in there too was another
[1:54:32] nature present you see predestinated was
[1:54:35] under there by God in this same body see
[1:54:38] two Natures in
[1:54:41] there
[1:54:44] amen
[1:54:48] that's amen yes so many Christians don't
[1:54:52] even know they have two
[1:54:54] Natures let's go to the two lives and
[1:54:56] the two
[1:54:57] natures and we can maybe go a little
[1:54:59] deep into it tonight and share it with
[1:55:02] you and you can see what God
[1:55:05] does okay okay amen are you following
[1:55:09] amen is it simple amen it's not
[1:55:12] complicated
[1:55:14] simple Hallelujah to me it's so
[1:55:17] simple all right
[1:55:20] let's go a little deep into
[1:55:22] it are you ready
[1:55:25] now boy is such a poor
[1:55:28] amen some people boy tonight the church
[1:55:30] is quiet on
[1:55:32] me are you ready for us to go
[1:55:35] deeper how many is ready let me see your
[1:55:37] hand amen now some people didn't lift
[1:55:39] your
[1:55:41] hand what about you are here are you
[1:55:44] ready all
[1:55:47] right this will explain a lot of stuff
[1:55:49] if we had enough time but let's go
[1:55:52] on no this is not a bunch of quotes I
[1:55:55] got to be careful you know I have set
[1:55:57] the quotes this one
[1:55:59] here all
[1:56:04] right this is nice
[1:56:12] ah are you
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:18] ready where is
[1:56:22] that 5 to six yeah I'm
[1:56:34] sorry now I got
[1:56:39] it please church this is so
[1:56:42] nice all right everybody know you have
[1:56:47] life amen but now we want to look at the
[1:56:49] two lives you have amen but they said a
[1:56:52] cat have nine lives we're not talking in
[1:56:54] the sense of that that somebody had
[1:56:57] almost died and came back and they said
[1:56:58] he have more than one no no no no not in
[1:57:00] that sense right now brother says here
[1:57:04] he's talking about the little spring
[1:57:06] here in Kentucky and go tell my
[1:57:07] disciples he said if this if the spring
[1:57:10] could come back spoke back he would say
[1:57:12] no bil it isn't because that you drink
[1:57:14] from it it isn't because anybody drinks
[1:57:16] from me it's something down beneath me
[1:57:19] here here pushing me and making me
[1:57:21] bubble and jump and carrying on like
[1:57:23] thish now are you ready
[1:57:26] now that's the way if they can find this
[1:57:29] quote every man or woman that's born of
[1:57:32] the spirit of God it is not you it is
[1:57:37] not human
[1:57:39] emotion it is because that the
[1:57:41] resurrection hallelujah or the power of
[1:57:44] God is in that human
[1:57:48] life
[1:57:53] yeah and it's pressing up into
[1:57:55] everlasting life moving up into eternal
[1:57:58] life something in there you could not
[1:58:01] hold your peace if you had to there is
[1:58:03] something within
[1:58:05] you
[1:58:07] amen so it is the power of the
[1:58:11] Resurrection something that is in
[1:58:14] what it is in the human life now let me
[1:58:18] slow on to say this brother said that
[1:58:21] there is a blood there is a soul and
[1:58:23] there is a
[1:58:24] life within that
[1:58:28] Soul so you got life you got what is
[1:58:32] called human life and in that human life
[1:58:36] God puts his life in that human life let
[1:58:40] me let me let me let me go further so I
[1:58:42] can read it for
[1:58:48] you
[1:58:52] this is so
[1:58:58] nice are you being blessed are you
[1:59:01] getting
[1:59:04] it now brother bam says now the holy
[1:59:06] spirit is here on Earth looking out
[1:59:09] those individuals that God has ordained
[1:59:12] to life in this age so you are ordained
[1:59:15] or predestinated to life and there has
[1:59:18] to a time when life comes in because you
[1:59:21] were predestinated to
[1:59:24] that and then there come a time when you
[1:59:26] receive eternal life now brother bam
[1:59:28] goes on let me read it for
[1:59:30] you he says here and as soon as it finds
[1:59:33] it it does just it does just like just
[1:59:36] like it did on Jesus Christ the great
[1:59:38] super Son of God who redeem us all it
[1:59:41] comes down and takes its place of aboard
[1:59:45] into the human life amen amen now notice
[1:59:51] brought the quickening
[1:59:54] power so the Holy Ghost comes down and
[1:59:57] it takes it to B in your life because
[2:00:01] you have two kinds of
[2:00:05] life
[2:00:10] amen let me ask you a
[2:00:13] question do you see
[2:00:16] it if you see it could you raise your
[2:00:18] hand yes amen and give God
[2:00:22] praise now let me ask a little question
[2:00:25] is there someone here that didn't see
[2:00:29] it look like everybody saw it Hallelujah
[2:00:33] that's wonderful amen all right now if
[2:00:35] everybody see it we can make another
[2:00:37] step and go a little forward
[2:00:40] amen two Natures
[2:00:43] yes in the
[2:00:45] same
[2:00:47] body two form of
[2:00:51] life in the same
[2:00:54] body now if you have two Natures in you
[2:00:59] let's look at these two Natures just a
[2:01:01] little bit tonight before we finish
[2:01:04] up and then we're going to try to finish
[2:01:06] up on
[2:01:07] that okay am I taking too much
[2:01:11] time all right now let's look at this
[2:01:14] brother brandham dealt with this in the
[2:01:18] message Blasphemous names all
[2:01:21] right and in the message Blasphemous
[2:01:25] names he shows us that there's two kinds
[2:01:29] of
[2:01:33] Fate
[2:01:35] actually a lot of people say which I
[2:01:37] agree with them and sometimes people
[2:01:40] doesn't
[2:01:42] understand they say me I don't want no
[2:01:47] intellectual fate
[2:01:52] here people say oh I don't want no
[2:01:54] intellectual fate part of the reason is
[2:01:57] the it's a misunderstanding of what
[2:01:59] intellectual faith
[2:02:02] is brother Bram says here in the message
[2:02:07] let me read it for you I'm going to read
[2:02:08] it for you so you will
[2:02:10] see and be oh Lord help me I'm feeling a
[2:02:13] little bit bad but pray for me that the
[2:02:14] Lord would just help me all
[2:02:17] right brother Brandon mentions here and
[2:02:21] here's what he says in Blasphemous names
[2:02:24] he says now here now get this
[2:02:27] lesson here what's what's with wrong
[2:02:29] with the I turn I turn on for this here
[2:02:34] is what is wrong with the brandham
[2:02:35] Tabernacle this is a strange statement
[2:02:38] brother bam is making here's what is
[2:02:40] wrong with the BAM Tabernacle you see
[2:02:42] there's two different kinds of Faith
[2:02:45] amen there's two different kinds of
[2:02:48] virtue you as I had it the other day two
[2:02:51] different kinds of knowledge two
[2:02:54] different kinds of
[2:02:55] temperance one think is pro prohibition
[2:02:59] they got that ain't the kind of
[2:03:00] temperance that God is talking about
[2:03:02] yeah but ROM goes on to explain it so in
[2:03:06] the natural let's put it like this in
[2:03:10] the natural your natural
[2:03:13] nature you have what the prophet calls
[2:03:17] and what the word of God calls
[2:03:19] human
[2:03:21] love which is fill your
[2:03:24] love but in the new God doesn't take
[2:03:27] that out of
[2:03:29] you you young sisters here you young
[2:03:33] Brothers here if one you grw up you want
[2:03:35] to get married you need that F human
[2:03:38] love to be able to love your husband or
[2:03:40] love your
[2:03:42] wife
[2:03:46] right amen amen
[2:03:50] who you going to get married if you
[2:03:51] don't have if it's just a gapo there
[2:03:53] nothing like
[2:03:55] that but I could say I love Liz my wife
[2:04:00] more than any other woman that's not a
[2:04:02] gapo love that's FAL
[2:04:06] love that's human
[2:04:10] love I can see let say someone come to
[2:04:13] me and said brother Ferguson I have this
[2:04:15] this this
[2:04:16] need and then what are my daughters
[2:04:19] Sharon or Mar one come well Daddy I have
[2:04:22] this this this need and then I said all
[2:04:24] right I'm going to take care of my
[2:04:26] children
[2:04:27] first inapo love there's no such a
[2:04:31] thing it's the love of God there's no
[2:04:34] preference but in the fal love in the
[2:04:37] fal love I have a FAL love and that FAL
[2:04:40] love for my family means that my
[2:04:42] daughter and my wife before everybody
[2:04:44] else but that's the feel you have and
[2:04:46] that's why brother brandham could stand
[2:04:48] before the con congregation look at the
[2:04:50] people sitting there and says I have a
[2:04:53] human love for
[2:04:55] you you got
[2:05:00] it if you didn't have that human love
[2:05:03] then you couldn't s my wife a special to
[2:05:05] me then every woman will have to be the
[2:05:09] same you see it but when every woman is
[2:05:12] the same that's way up there in the agap
[2:05:14] whole love there's no preference there's
[2:05:16] nothing like that everybody is the same
[2:05:18] I love my wife I love my sister I love
[2:05:21] you all of you the same but in the video
[2:05:23] love it's different so you have to have
[2:05:26] that for your wife for your husband
[2:05:28] otherwise are you going to get
[2:05:30] married how you going to say I love this
[2:05:32] man more than the other here's the
[2:05:33] brother that I love I love him more than
[2:05:35] I love anybody else that's video
[2:05:39] love now we I don't have time to go into
[2:05:41] all the quotes you understand I'm just
[2:05:43] trying to skip and move
[2:05:45] quickly you see like you young sisters
[2:05:47] you all understand what I'm saying you
[2:05:49] can afford to say I love this guy and I
[2:05:51] don't love this guy what are you talking
[2:05:53] in the P you got power of there's no
[2:05:55] such a thing as I love him and I don't
[2:05:57] love
[2:05:58] him but in the pho yes in the f I love
[2:06:01] him and I don't love
[2:06:05] him
[2:06:07] okay you all understand see like Shan
[2:06:11] could tell me her daddy when she met
[2:06:12] Israel she said I love Israel here's
[2:06:15] another brother she said I don't love
[2:06:17] him yes I can't say Sharon you're
[2:06:21] wrong you all understand what I'm saying
[2:06:24] because she's talking about human love
[2:06:27] and that human love is there even when
[2:06:29] AAP love is there that's why brother
[2:06:32] Bram says the two loves are operating
[2:06:38] here
[2:06:41] am two different
[2:06:43] Natures in the same
[2:06:46] body and it makes us
[2:06:49] strange we act strange we speak strange
[2:06:54] you you young folks you go to school and
[2:06:57] your friends at school don't understand
[2:06:59] you they think you're a little bit funny
[2:07:02] you're different she's different she's a
[2:07:03] little bit funny and it's normal for
[2:07:05] them to think like that because you are
[2:07:07] different from them you have two natures
[2:07:09] and they only have one amen they only
[2:07:11] have a natural nature but there's two
[2:07:14] parts and these two Natures are in
[2:07:15] Conflict many times with one another
[2:07:18] brother says that video of I got all of
[2:07:20] in Conflict
[2:07:22] amen but you have to have it I don't
[2:07:25] know know how you going to marry what
[2:07:27] are you going to do with your
[2:07:29] wife do you tell your wife listen honey
[2:07:32] I love everyone every woman like the way
[2:07:33] I love you there's no different and she
[2:07:35] look at you and says
[2:07:38] what she's talking in the fill
[2:07:42] you you all
[2:07:47] understand now I have several quotes on
[2:07:50] it but I'm trying to move away now you
[2:07:54] take for instance the
[2:07:57] Fate I've seen ministers get up at the
[2:08:00] platform and tell the congregation we
[2:08:03] don't want no intellectual F Among Us
[2:08:06] and I sit in the meetings and listen to
[2:08:07] that brother preach and I know he
[2:08:09] doesn't know what he's talking
[2:08:13] about if the people will only go back to
[2:08:15] the word of God right if the before they
[2:08:18] make all these statements they will
[2:08:20] check the Bible and the message it's
[2:08:22] going to be a different thing do you
[2:08:23] know what brother bam calls intellectual
[2:08:26] Faith the Bible does not use the word
[2:08:28] intellectual Faith you don't find that
[2:08:31] nowhere in the Bible but brother
[2:08:33] brandham calls intellectual faith
[2:08:40] hope but hope has its place amen because
[2:08:44] the Bible says a people without hope
[2:08:46] perishes right amen
[2:08:49] yes and that's why the prophet of God
[2:08:52] says intellectual Faith brings you to a
[2:08:55] to a true
[2:08:56] Faith you have to have
[2:09:02] hope
[2:09:04] Amen in enticing Spirit that's what he
[2:09:07] says he says intellectual faith is
[2:09:13] Hope see now we won't have time to go
[2:09:15] into hope and all of that and explain
[2:09:16] and talk about all of that one
[2:09:19] but that's what it
[2:09:21] is see but when you pray you need Faith
[2:09:25] amen and says 900 out of 99 people that
[2:09:28] come have hope instead of Faith yes he
[2:09:31] said we want to change that around we
[2:09:32] want to get more faith amen we need
[2:09:36] Faith but tell you you honest
[2:09:39] truth when God put faith in me and I'm
[2:09:43] converted he doesn't take All My Hope
[2:09:45] out he doesn't take that intellectual
[2:09:47] Faith which is hope completely out of me
[2:09:50] I need it and I if I had time tonight
[2:09:53] I'll share it with you where it's is
[2:09:56] everything has to be placed in its order
[2:09:58] in his
[2:10:00] place now I know the songs contradict
[2:10:03] some
[2:10:04] people I know
[2:10:06] it but go check the message for yourself
[2:10:09] you'll see amen
[2:10:12] amen that's why he said in every church
[2:10:16] we need those three things hope and
[2:10:19] charity you see because the faith is a
[2:10:22] revelation and if I don't have a
[2:10:23] revelation I have hope for the people I
[2:10:25] hope they're saved I can't say in my
[2:10:27] myself I have a revelation that they're
[2:10:29] going to be saved but I'm hoping they
[2:10:34] will so we need that
[2:10:37] Hope Oh Brother when everything fits in
[2:10:41] its place and God puts everything in its
[2:10:42] place amen but how do we do it we have
[2:10:45] to go back to the word of God and check
[2:10:46] it amen you see because the Bible says
[2:10:49] prove all things and we go back and see
[2:10:52] how the word of God how all these things
[2:10:53] fits in in their places in the word of
[2:10:56] God you all understand you see what I'm
[2:10:57] trying to say you see so there is now if
[2:11:00] you look at yourself you could see these
[2:11:03] things in you it's part of the two
[2:11:06] Natures in
[2:11:07] you so you can look at yourself and see
[2:11:10] that in you the same Tabernacle is that
[2:11:13] agapo love and that filo love in you in
[2:11:17] the same Tabernacle
[2:11:18] is that intellectual faith and perfect
[2:11:24] Faith now some people say but for I
[2:11:27] don't have no intellectual faith
[2:11:30] uhhuh I want to ask you a question do
[2:11:32] you have any
[2:11:38] hope I like to see the one who put up
[2:11:40] his hand tonight and say he has no
[2:11:47] hope amen are you tired are you getting
[2:11:50] tired
[2:11:52] Hallelujah see you you see we got to be
[2:11:55] we we we're coming to the point where
[2:11:57] the Holy Ghost is showing us what he's
[2:11:59] doing for us and what is in us and this
[2:12:02] is where we are now everything has its
[2:12:05] place that's why in the message works is
[2:12:07] Faith Express brother Ram says it's like
[2:12:10] this he said just keep
[2:12:13] believing until God reveals it to you
[2:12:17] well you could keep believe in it with
[2:12:18] what until God reveal it to you what are
[2:12:20] you going to believe it with your
[2:12:22] intellectual faith and what is your
[2:12:23] intellectual Faith
[2:12:26] Hope because faith is the evidence of
[2:12:28] things hope forl you hope for it and you
[2:12:31] hope brother says you're hoping for it
[2:12:33] and you hope brings you to your faith I
[2:12:35] have those quotes with me back there I
[2:12:36] didn't bring them to the platform
[2:12:39] tonight your hope brings you to the
[2:12:43] faith so when you hear preachers get up
[2:12:46] at the because they don't look at the
[2:12:47] message excuse me if I say this and they
[2:12:49] don't look to see what brother Bram said
[2:12:51] about these things and therefore the
[2:12:53] people are confused and don't understand
[2:12:55] the place of these
[2:13:00] things you see a
[2:13:04] church if you see it you're privilege
[2:13:08] God open your eyes Hallelujah you can
[2:13:10] see it
[2:13:13] amen all right two different kinds of
[2:13:16] temperance two different kinds of
[2:13:19] virtue two different kinds of
[2:13:22] love in the nature one is human love the
[2:13:26] other one
[2:13:28] is divine love one is human life the
[2:13:33] other one
[2:13:34] is eternal
[2:13:37] life the eternal life in the human life
[2:13:43] so here we are tonight we have human
[2:13:46] life m and we have eternal eternal life
[2:13:51] right we have Divine love and we have
[2:13:57] human love which is called FAL love we
[2:14:01] have Divine Faith which the prophet
[2:14:04] calls Revelation and we have human Faith
[2:14:08] which the prophet calls intellectual
[2:14:10] Faith which the prophet call
[2:14:14] [Music]
[2:14:16] Hope what people we
[2:14:21] are but these two Natures fights each
[2:14:24] other brother P said they're very
[2:14:26] contradictory to one another therefore
[2:14:28] The Human Side will have an End
[2:14:34] Amen you said well brother Ferguson when
[2:14:37] we received the the new birth didn't we
[2:14:39] die
[2:14:41] yes you died to sin and everything that
[2:14:43] is contrary to the word of God Amen but
[2:14:47] in in New Birth God didn't take out from
[2:14:50] you the love you have for your wife no
[2:14:52] come on
[2:14:55] [Music]
[2:14:56] church he didn't take from you that F
[2:14:59] love but said the is the love you have
[2:15:01] for your wife if he will take the F of
[2:15:04] complete go to you she will be like any
[2:15:07] other
[2:15:13] woman and if he will take that hope that
[2:15:16] intellectual part if he takes all of
[2:15:19] that completely out of you you cannot
[2:15:21] have hope for the people you won't be
[2:15:23] able to look at a sinner and all the
[2:15:24] people and have hope for him because you
[2:15:26] need hope you have no Revelation I have
[2:15:28] no Revelation that he will be saved
[2:15:29] therefore I have a hope that God will
[2:15:31] save him we have hope for the people
[2:15:33] that's what brother Bram tell
[2:15:37] [Music]
[2:15:43] us
[2:15:45] two
[2:15:46] different Natures amen and then what
[2:15:50] does God do when he comes
[2:15:53] in okay I'll try to finish
[2:15:56] here okay is that all right because this
[2:15:59] is a lot for you in one
[2:16:03] nightl you got two Natures
[2:16:07] hallelujah thank you Lord and both of
[2:16:09] them is what amen I
[2:16:12] contradict because that human love is a
[2:16:16] problem makes you Des things sometimes
[2:16:18] that God doesn't have for
[2:16:20] you pull you here and pull you there
[2:16:24] things that God therefore it has to come
[2:16:25] that's why brother bam said the agap
[2:16:27] love he uses an expression like this he
[2:16:30] says when the agap love comes in it
[2:16:33] overrides the fil love amen overrides it
[2:16:37] see the fil love is there the cap love
[2:16:40] comes in it overrides it Hallelujah the
[2:16:43] human life is there the life of God
[2:16:44] comes in what does the life of God do it
[2:16:46] takes the pr in you it takes control of
[2:16:50] the human life amen the human life is
[2:16:53] not the eternal life the eternal life is
[2:16:55] not human life but when the eternal life
[2:16:58] comes in it takes preeminence it takes
[2:17:00] control of that human life it brings the
[2:17:03] human life under
[2:17:05] subjection that's what the prophet of
[2:17:07] God taught
[2:17:12] us subjection to
[2:17:16] him that he
[2:17:18] would be able to have the final
[2:17:20] word and that human life pulls you this
[2:17:22] way and pulls you that way pulls you
[2:17:26] this way sometimes because the prophet
[2:17:28] of God said is very contradictory one or
[2:17:30] another very very
[2:17:31] contradictory but we want to bring it
[2:17:33] under subjection therefore we pray and
[2:17:35] said Lord God Of Heaven have your way in
[2:17:37] me why are we saying have your way why
[2:17:41] are we saying have your way Lord why are
[2:17:43] we saying Lord I yield to you what do we
[2:17:46] yield we yield our life we we yield what
[2:17:50] we are to him if that life was not there
[2:17:53] we have nothing to yield no come on
[2:17:59] Church you can't eat something you don't
[2:18:05] haveen Lord I yeld to you well where is
[2:18:09] he he is in me when he is in me I'm
[2:18:12] yielding to him but I'm yielding what
[2:18:15] yes amen I'm yielding my nature yes I'm
[2:18:18] heing my life all my life I gave to you
[2:18:23] well could you give God human life
[2:18:26] yes would God accept human life yes when
[2:18:31] he accept your life when you give your
[2:18:32] whole life to him you hear people say I
[2:18:35] have given my life to Jesus Christ and
[2:18:37] the poor people don't even know what
[2:18:38] they're saying
[2:18:40] yes you give your life to him it doesn't
[2:18:43] mean he take your life away you die to
[2:18:46] everything contrary to the word he take
[2:18:48] your life and he destroys everything
[2:18:51] contrary to the word and brings that
[2:18:53] life contrary to him and you say Lord I
[2:18:56] give my all to you I give my life to you
[2:19:00] and then his life comes down in that
[2:19:03] life two lives two life in the same body
[2:19:06] two kinds of
[2:19:09] [Music]
[2:19:11] life
[2:19:15] amen you see it amen yes amen you see
[2:19:19] why I try to pull away from the other
[2:19:21] stuff to get there yes Hallelujah all
[2:19:25] right now we'll try to
[2:19:30] finish wonderful but Brana mentions this
[2:19:34] is we're going to finish here here
[2:19:37] know he says this
[2:19:41] here are you
[2:19:43] ready
[2:19:46] amen are you seeing it
[2:19:49] now those two
[2:19:53] Natures brother bring them under
[2:19:55] subjection to the will of almighty God
[2:19:58] amen amen amen bring them under
[2:20:00] subjection amen Give It All to Jesus
[2:20:04] amen sir hand those things over to Jesus
[2:20:07] he didn't take them out of you what he
[2:20:08] wants you to do is to bring them under
[2:20:10] subjection to him I gave my life to he
[2:20:12] didn't take your life out but bring it
[2:20:14] under subjection to him bring those
[2:20:16] things under subjection to him
[2:20:17] that he will will have the preeminence
[2:20:20] in your life that he will be able to
[2:20:22] have the total control in your life what
[2:20:24] does he do he controls your F your love
[2:20:27] amen so that F your love will not be
[2:20:30] projected to anything contrary to
[2:20:33] him because when love is
[2:20:37] projected that's why people fall in love
[2:20:39] with things that is not of God because
[2:20:41] the love of God is not in them because
[2:20:44] when that love of God is in you it
[2:20:46] controls to override that F your
[2:20:51] love amen you see it yes so that F
[2:20:56] project to whatever contr to
[2:21:00] God
[2:21:02] okay and then he controls that hope that
[2:21:05] intellectual Faith amen that you will
[2:21:08] not follow this message just by
[2:21:12] hope which we won't have time to go into
[2:21:15] tonight and I purposely didn't bring the
[2:21:17] course with me because I'm thinking of
[2:21:19] going into that haveit back
[2:21:21] there I can see where George smiling
[2:21:24] there but you see we touch slightly on
[2:21:26] it maybe on Wednesday night we'll see
[2:21:28] how much we can go okay before I leave
[2:21:31] if the Lord willing all right let me
[2:21:33] share this with
[2:21:34] you this is taken from the message Souls
[2:21:37] that are in prison
[2:21:39] now and brother Brandon dealing on that
[2:21:42] here's what he
[2:21:44] says he says now the soul of man is not
[2:21:47] the body of man it's the soul see and
[2:21:51] the soul is something that's the nature
[2:21:53] of the spirit now watch here the nature
[2:21:55] of the spirit and then when the nature
[2:21:58] of a man when he said we are dead the
[2:22:00] scripture plainly tells us we are dead
[2:22:02] and our lives are HID in God through
[2:22:04] Christ sealed in there by the Holy
[2:22:06] Spirit now it wasn't your body
[2:22:09] died it wasn't your spirit died it was
[2:22:13] the nature of your spirit that died now
[2:22:15] when brother brandham says this
[2:22:18] Lord help us Lord help us now when
[2:22:21] brother brandham tell us that the nature
[2:22:22] of your spirit is died and when people
[2:22:25] say I am dead and my life is hidden in
[2:22:28] Christ with God we need to see what that
[2:22:32] means amen what it means to die what
[2:22:36] does it represent to us
[2:22:39] amen don't forget it church
[2:22:46] amen H now let's go on I want to finish
[2:22:50] here right because this is a lot a lot
[2:22:53] for you to pray about and think about
[2:22:55] tonight Amen brother goes on here so he
[2:22:58] said it wasn't that your body died it
[2:23:00] wasn't your spirit died it was the
[2:23:02] nature of your spirit di see the nature
[2:23:05] which is the soul the nature of your
[2:23:07] soul is God if you born again if it's
[2:23:10] not it's of the world anything that
[2:23:13] begins has to end and so therefore the
[2:23:16] only way that you can have eternal life
[2:23:17] is to have a life that never did
[2:23:20] begin and then your life did begin when
[2:23:23] you were born when God breathed the
[2:23:25] breath of life into your nostrils and
[2:23:27] you become a living Soul then your life
[2:23:31] begin then brother brandham goes
[2:23:35] on are you ready now yes everybody all
[2:23:39] right but that soul in there see that
[2:23:43] soul is what God is working on now if
[2:23:46] you want to watch and see that nature
[2:23:47] when bam said you're dead and we're
[2:23:48] going to see what it means now okay so
[2:23:50] we could we could we could lean out to
[2:23:52] what he says all right here's what he
[2:23:54] says but that Soul that's in there see
[2:23:56] that soul is what God is working on see
[2:23:59] if he can only get that nature that
[2:24:03] Spirit to agree with
[2:24:06] him then that nature dies amen the
[2:24:10] nature and the love of the world dies
[2:24:12] and the thing of The World Is Dead Sea
[2:24:14] because if you love the world or the
[2:24:15] things of the world the love of God is
[2:24:17] nothing you see so a man must be born
[2:24:19] again so this Nature has to die and the
[2:24:23] nature of God comes in there and God is
[2:24:25] the only thing that that there is that
[2:24:27] never did begin or never did end so what
[2:24:29] brother brandham is saying is this he
[2:24:31] gets that soul that nature to agree with
[2:24:35] him now when the nature within you
[2:24:38] agrees with God God call that
[2:24:45] death yes sir that's
[2:24:50] right you want me to read it again for
[2:24:52] you
[2:24:55] yes but that Soul that's in there see
[2:24:58] that soul is what God is working
[2:25:01] on am might he's working on the
[2:25:07] soul now if the soul is not there how
[2:25:09] can you work on it he's working on the
[2:25:12] soul see but contines see if he can only
[2:25:15] get that nature all right that Spirit to
[2:25:18] agree with him hallah then that nature
[2:25:22] dies the nature dies when it agrees with
[2:25:27] God very
[2:25:31] good therefore here we cannot disagree
[2:25:34] with the message we cannot disagree with
[2:25:36] the word of God Amen because our nature
[2:25:40] agrees with God and when it agrees with
[2:25:44] God the prophet of God says there is we
[2:25:46] nature
[2:25:48] dies God is working on that nature what
[2:25:51] is he doing he's trying to get that
[2:25:53] nature to agree with him you want to do
[2:25:55] this you want to do that and the Holy
[2:25:57] Ghost says no this is what I want this
[2:25:59] is what I want this is what I want this
[2:26:01] is what I want and you are yielding your
[2:26:03] nature healing yourself to
[2:26:10] [Applause]
[2:26:13] him and as you heal the part of the
[2:26:16] nature that's contrary to him takes it
[2:26:19] out this is contrary it goes that's
[2:26:23] contrary it goes this is contrary it
[2:26:27] goes this is contrary it goes and then
[2:26:30] the whole nature within you agrees with
[2:26:33] God and God calls that
[2:26:36] death
[2:26:38] boy then the nature agrees and it
[2:26:44] dies amen sir and you you're walking
[2:26:47] with Jesus now
[2:26:49] yes you don't have to worry about these
[2:26:52] things they're dead anything contrary to
[2:26:54] God is dead you're walking in harmony
[2:26:57] with
[2:26:58] God you agree with God let me let me say
[2:27:01] this to you let me explain this let me
[2:27:02] say this to you what if I would say I am
[2:27:05] dead is that what god require of me just
[2:27:08] to die a lot of people say all God
[2:27:11] requires of you is to die they don't
[2:27:12] know what it mean what it means the man
[2:27:15] in the world he dies
[2:27:17] the drunk and The Prostitute they
[2:27:20] die is that the death the Bible is
[2:27:22] speaking
[2:27:23] about it's when that nature agrees with
[2:27:26] God God pulls you into an agreement with
[2:27:29] him that you and God become
[2:27:38] one if you see it raise your hand and
[2:27:40] give God
[2:27:43] praise that's why he's working on that
[2:27:46] nature

[2:32:33] one thing that you need that you cannot
[2:32:35] do certain things you cannot
[2:32:37] do you cannot be saved by intellectual
[2:32:41] faith and brother bam says You must
[2:32:43] never make God the object of human love
[2:32:46] you cannot love God like you love your
[2:32:48] husband or you love your wife the
[2:32:50] prophet of God says that I have the
[2:32:51] quotes and won't have time to read
[2:32:53] it it's a different kind of
[2:32:57] love you all understand it's a different
[2:33:01] kind of
[2:33:03] love I cannot believe God just with my
[2:33:06] intellectual fate of hope I need F Faith
[2:33:09] from God to believe him I cannot please
[2:33:12] God with an intellectual fate I cannot
[2:33:15] please God
[2:33:17] with a fill your love I cannot please
[2:33:20] God with hope he that come unto God Must

[2:33:30] God comes in he brings these things he
[2:33:33] brings his faith he brings his love he
[2:33:34] brings these things and then we serve
[2:33:37] him with those things and then we please
