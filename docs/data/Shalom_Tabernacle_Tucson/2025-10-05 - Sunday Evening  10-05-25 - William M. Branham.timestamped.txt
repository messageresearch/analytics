[13:27] How many want to do that tonight?
[13:29] Amen. You can be seated if you'd like. I
[13:31] I always
[13:33] think of my brother Jeffrey when we sang
[13:35] that song. So we had a we we had a
[13:38] convention years ago and this was before
[13:40] Jeffrey needed a walker to to get around
[13:44] with and he always loved that song. And
[13:47] so I saw Jeffrey come down from Phoenix.
[13:50] He was living with Jill and Robert at
[13:51] that time. And I said, you know, every
[13:54] time I I sing this song, even then, I
[13:56] think of Jeffrey. And he got up from the
[13:59] congregation, came up on the platform,
[14:00] and he wanted to do the the hand motions
[14:02] and everything. So, you see me smiling
[14:05] when I'm singing that song. It's just
[14:07] thinking of, won't it be wonderful? We
[14:09] get on that other side. We'll all have
[14:11] new body. He won't have to be walking
[14:12] around with his walker anymore. Won't
[14:14] have to be on the insulin for his
[14:17] diabetes. and and but he just cast his
[14:20] burden unto the Lord. And amen, that's
[14:23] one thing about Jeffrey is he uh he
[14:26] gives a 100% of the talents he's been
[14:28] given back to the Lord and worships him,
[14:30] loves him, and has been an example for
[14:33] me my whole life. So,
[14:37] burn, burn, Holy Spirit, burn in me. Oh,

[37:41] Peace of God cover me.
[37:48] Cover me.
[37:52] Cover me. Oh, peace of God.
[37:59] Peace of God
[38:01] cover me
[38:05] through the stor.
[38:14] Bless you. Amen. Let's give the Lord a
[38:17] hand of praise
[38:20] for his goodness and his mercy to us.
[38:22] Amen. Tonight we're going to listen to a
[38:26] portion of questions and answers 1964
[38:30] and uh just to
[38:33] I don't think brother Brandham reads a
[38:35] scripture in starting that message but
[38:38] we'll read one in Hebrews chapter
[38:43] number 12.
[38:46] Welcome each of you to the house of the
[38:47] Lord. Just before we go to the table of
[38:50] the Lord, we wanted to hear this portion
[38:53] of the word of God. Amen.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Hebrews Hebrews chapter 12 verses number
[39:05] one and two.
[39:13] Certainly enjoyed the Lord this morning
[39:15] our service. always thank God for his
[39:18] goodness unto us
[39:21] &gt;&gt; and appreciate the songs singing the
[39:23] samuranos
[39:24] a portion of the samuranos. I thought
[39:26] all of them were going to be up there
[39:28] but that was take what we can get. Huh?
[39:31] So that was very nice. Appreciate that.
[39:33] Amen. Hebrews chapter 12. Wherefore,
[39:37] seeing we also are compassed about with
[39:40] so great cloud of witness, let us lay
[39:42] aside every weight, and the sin which
[39:45] does so easily beset us, and let us run
[39:48] with patience the race that is set
[39:51] before us, looking unto Jesus, the
[39:54] author and finisher of our faith, who
[39:57] for the joy that was set before him
[39:59] endured the cross, despising the shame,
[40:02] and is sat down at the right hand of the
[40:05] throne of God. Amen. And so there was um
[40:09] this just came to my mind to go into the
[40:12] questions and answers and I thought I'd
[40:15] start with the last one and there was
[40:18] the evening service but then I just took
[40:20] the one from the morning um
[40:24] from question number 325. I think that's
[40:26] the first question he starts, brother
[40:28] Random starts with and is directly with
[40:32] part of the millennium that he was
[40:33] talking about from the Sunday school
[40:36] this morning through question 332. 3:32.
[40:41] So let us sing onlyly believe as we hear
[40:44] the word of the Lord. only
[40:48] believe
[40:51] [Music]
[40:57] that all things are possible.
[41:04] Only
[41:06] believe.
[41:10] All
[41:12] [Music]
[41:22] things are possible.
[41:27] Only
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Can you make that confession? Let's lift
[41:31] our hands and say, "Lord,
[41:34] I believe
[41:40] I believe
[41:44] that all these are possible.
[41:50] Lord, I
[41:53] believe.
[41:55] Lord,
[41:57] I believe.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[42:03] I believe
[42:07] that all things are possible.
[42:13] Lord, I believe.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Unless you can be seated, brother Brown.
[42:22] Do all who go in the bride have to live
[42:26] within the 1500 miles of the tabernacle?
[42:29] I believe I had that again last Sunday.
[42:31] I just have to pick them up and use them
[42:33] as I can. 1500 miles of the tabernacle
[42:36] as it sounds like on tape number two of
[42:41] the future home of the bride.
[42:45] I always thought that the bride would
[42:48] come out of all parts of the world at
[42:52] the time of the rapture. Am I wrong? No,
[42:56] my dear friend, you are not wrong.
[42:59] You're right.
[43:00] Now, if I said anything under uh the
[43:05] tape that would lead you to believe.
[43:07] Now, I haven't these are all new to me.
[43:10] Now, I've never looked in these series.
[43:11] See, these are new bunchs that I got the
[43:13] other Sunday. I didn't put him back in
[43:14] this envelope and laid him back in
[43:16] there. Now,
[43:18] in this,
[43:20] no, the bride doesn't have to be in any
[43:23] certain place. Many of them will be in
[43:26] the dust of the earth. They'll be around
[43:28] the earth. They'll be frozen in the the
[43:30] snow in the north and and dust of the uh
[43:34] tropical jungles and and all around the
[43:36] world. But when the trumpet of God shall
[43:38] sound, the dead in Christ shall arise,
[43:40] waken, and come out of the dust of the
[43:42] earth. no matter where they are. And now
[43:45] in this the resurrection will be a
[43:48] universal see every wherever creature on
[43:52] the ball of the earth it's in Christ
[43:54] will come forth with him when he comes.
[43:57] See, no matter where you are, just think
[43:59] of the arena
[44:02] and the days of the early martyrs that
[44:05] when those Christians were thrown into
[44:08] lion's den and those lines kill the
[44:10] Christians and eat up their bodies.
[44:14] See, yet they were scattered. Their
[44:17] bodies was in the wastage of the line
[44:19] across the face of the earth. No matter
[44:22] where it is, you can't see. You're made
[44:25] up of a substance that's unseen made
[44:29] material and God will will give that uh
[44:34] that substance back. See, now like you
[44:36] take a a cell, you break it down from a
[44:39] cell and it comes in there into a a cell
[44:42] in a cell and into an atom and a
[44:45] molecule and on down like that and
[44:46] finally it ends up into the unseen.
[44:50] It goes from a natural sampling. You put
[44:53] your hands onto gases, from gases into
[44:56] acids, acids into gases and gases on
[44:58] back like that to it finally all winds
[45:00] up to one little thing and that is
[45:03] spirit.
[45:04] And this spirit who has occupied these
[45:08] gases, it might not be the same gases,
[45:11] but the features of what you are will be
[45:15] exactly what they are. Again, see the
[45:18] spirit has controlled that. And now, in
[45:21] other words, when you become a young man
[45:23] or young woman and like God takes a
[45:26] picture of you. Now, no matter how old
[45:29] and wrinkled, how disfigured, whatever
[45:31] it will be, that line right on down to
[45:34] that body may be destroyed, disfigured,
[45:36] burnt, eat up the lines, whatever it is,
[45:38] but it was made up of gases, 16 elements
[45:43] of the earth. that was uh calcium and
[45:46] potachsh and petroleum and cosmic light
[45:48] and so forth all goes together to make
[45:50] up the body. Now no matter that's the
[45:52] whole earth is filled with that but now
[45:55] this picture is the main thing. Then in
[45:58] the resurrection those gases and acids
[46:00] and things comes right back into the
[46:02] place and develops this picture again.
[46:04] Now this picture was not taken when you
[46:07] were 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your
[46:09] best. When was it taken? Before there
[46:11] was a foundation of the world.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was put in God's great vow and
[46:16] then only thing it did was featured
[46:18] itself here for you to make your choice.
[46:21] See then you become a servant of God.
[46:23] Him for knowing it makes him a redeemer
[46:25] as we've been through it. Then that
[46:27] picture is absolutely this is the
[46:30] negative.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; The negative part of life is where you
[46:35] are living now. And anything if there is
[46:38] a negative there's got to be a positive
[46:42] &gt;&gt; before there can be a negative.
[46:44] Therefore if this is a negative there's
[46:47] got to be a positive somewhere. And this
[46:49] ain't the real thing. This is only a
[46:51] foreshadow of the real thing that is to
[46:53] come.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Now you got it.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; So I don't care what they would do. They
[46:59] cannot destroy that profile that picture
[47:03] in God's great gallery up there. It
[47:06] cannot destroy this in heaven. You could
[47:08] burn it up, feed it to the lions, uh do
[47:11] it any way you want to. It'll come forth
[47:14] again just as sure as the two twos is
[47:16] for. Just as sure as God spoke it, it'll
[47:18] come forth. So no matter where you are
[47:20] now, if I I think if you'll play the
[47:23] tape, I don't know who wrote it. No name
[47:25] signs, just a little piece of paper with
[47:27] u blue ink wrote out of a little
[47:30] notebook. look like it's been tore off
[47:32] from a a little notebook. But remember
[47:36] on this in in this question now in the
[47:40] tape if you'll notice I said this
[47:42] something on this might not be word by
[47:44] word. Now if you check this tape with
[47:46] the other one I said for instance we are
[47:48] here this morning this city that we long
[47:52] to see will be some 1500 mile square. I
[47:57] said that would reach from Maine to
[48:00] Florida and from the eastern seabboard
[48:03] to 800 miles west of the Mississippi
[48:06] River 1500 miles square. I said think of
[48:09] it right here this morning. There's
[48:12] people sitting right here that has
[48:14] actually come from that much distance
[48:16] from 1500 miles square setting in here.
[48:19] Now, I don't know where the temple will
[48:21] set on the earth, but I have an idea
[48:24] that the temple will set right about
[48:26] where Palestine is now. That will
[48:29] probably be the top of the mountain
[48:32] right there. It'll reach out. Of course,
[48:33] there'll be no more sea then. See, this
[48:35] world's 25,000 miles around it. So, 1500
[48:37] miles, not very much out of that. But
[48:40] this great city will set on this 1500
[48:44] square mile
[48:47] mountain. Now the reason I believe that
[48:50] is because of the prophecies and things
[48:53] concerning Mount Zion in Jerusalem and
[48:57] those cities. And there's where Abraham
[48:59] the prophet was seeking for that city
[49:02] that was whose builder and maker was
[49:04] God. He looked for that city in that
[49:07] land. I believe it'll be where that land
[49:09] is. That land, you can hardly find it on
[49:12] the map. It's a little bitty dot. And
[49:15] look at the land that Russia and United
[49:16] States, South America, and all those
[49:18] places there. Why was God so zealous of
[49:21] that place?
[49:23] See, of that one place. That's the
[49:25] question. I can't prove it, but it just
[49:27] looks that way to me. But wherever it
[49:29] is, we're headed that way.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; So, praise the Lord for that. Now, if
[49:34] you got the impression that I that I
[49:36] said it would be in uh around 1500 miles
[49:39] of the tabernacle, that was the wrong
[49:41] impression. You see, cuz it won't this
[49:43] tabernacle has this is just a little
[49:44] place that's going to be destroyed and
[49:46] and the world will be burn up and this
[49:49] will all be done away with and this
[49:51] Indiana and United States and everything
[49:52] will just melt and just wax out enter
[49:56] lava. See, all sin, all disease, all
[49:59] germs, all everything else will be
[50:01] destroyed. And I saw a new heavens and a
[50:03] new earth
[50:04] &gt;&gt; for the first time. Thank God with 6,000
[50:07] years in building this world, putting it
[50:08] together, formed it. How did he do it?
[50:11] The Bible said he made it out of things
[50:13] which does not appear. That is, he
[50:15] created the earth. Now notice this is
[50:18] beautiful. The very creator that created
[50:22] the earth for a purpose. Satan defiled
[50:25] it. He come down to redeem what was left
[50:28] on here. and he has gone somewhere else
[50:32] and is in his business yet creating
[50:36] now. It taken him 6,000 years to make
[50:39] the the earth and he's going to take two
[50:42] days to create the city that goes on the
[50:45] earth.
[50:48] He's in my father's house are many
[50:50] mansions.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; If it was I saw, I would have told you.
[50:54] I'll go to prepare a place for you.
[50:58] Build a city out of transparent gold,
[51:00] the streets out of gold. What a
[51:03] beautiful place. Where will he get it?
[51:05] Is he any materials on the other earth
[51:06] or the moons and stars and things? He
[51:09] don't have to have it.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; He's a creator.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; He's gone to build the city.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good enough for me. Ain't
[51:17] you? That's good. For if he built this
[51:19] one and I enjoy this one, what's it
[51:21] going to be when he builds this new one?
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my. What a wonderful thing. And so
[51:28] I'm glad that we're bound for that city.
[51:31] All right, Brother Brandham, I love the
[51:34] Lord, but for the past year, I have uh
[51:39] been I have been faced with a problem.
[51:43] Seems sometimes I've almost been out of
[51:46] my mind. What is it? Please pray for me
[51:51] uh and my husband. Well, if there is no
[51:56] if this person was on private interview
[51:58] like you people have been in there this
[52:00] morning, it would pull that out what it
[52:02] is. Whatever it is. See, the Lord would
[52:05] reveal what it is. But now that I don't
[52:08] know who you are and you're not sitting
[52:09] here, it just said a sister in Christ.
[52:12] Now, now if it is, if it's something
[52:15] that you have done that's wrong, it's
[52:17] bothered you, then check it with the
[52:20] Bible and see what you must do. But if
[52:22] you haven't done anything and you're not
[52:24] condemned of anything, it's perhaps your
[52:26] nerves. See, it could be many things
[52:29] that happened. Maybe some trouble back
[52:31] in your life. Maybe it's if a woman here
[52:33] might be in the menopause time. That's
[52:35] when everything is wrong with her. And
[52:37] there's nothing wrong with her yet.
[52:38] Everything's wrong with her. And she's
[52:40] not just putting on. She really feels
[52:42] that. It's just as real. Any person
[52:44] that's nervous is that way. Don't never
[52:46] disagree. You husbands to your wives
[52:50] when they're in that time of life. If
[52:51] you ever if she ever was your
[52:53] sweetheart, you let her be right then
[52:55] cuz she needs you. She really needs your
[52:58] help. She needs somebody to help her and
[53:01] understand her. Talk to her. Take her up
[53:04] in your arms like be like like like she
[53:06] was your sweetheart and she should be
[53:08] and and understand her because she's
[53:11] going through a time that her entire
[53:13] makeup is changing and you must be good
[53:16] to her at that time. I think that's why
[53:18] Mr.
[53:20] uh Rockefeller made a fatal mistake. He
[53:23] was loved by the nation, would probably
[53:25] been our next president. But when his
[53:26] wife took menopause and went in
[53:28] menopause and he left her and married
[53:30] his secretary, you see what happened?
[53:32] That shows you some real good thinking
[53:34] Americans yet. Now, I like Mr.
[53:36] Goldwater, I think, or Mr. Rockefeller.
[53:39] Uh he's a I like Mr. Goldwater, too. I
[53:42] like everybody, but I I didn't want to.
[53:44] Some of you, some of my brother
[53:47] Republicans sitting out there hear me
[53:48] say that. Notice, but uh I'm not a
[53:52] politician. I I want to be a Christian.
[53:53] See, and this is not a place for
[53:54] politics. And the whole thing's gone
[53:56] anyhow that way. But this that we're
[53:58] talking about is eternal. Democrat or
[54:01] Republican.
[54:02] Oh, it's such a mess. It can never be
[54:05] redeemed. It's over. So don't argue
[54:08] about that. The thing to do is live for
[54:10] this kingdom. For here we have no
[54:14] continuing city,
[54:16] &gt;&gt; but we seek one to come. Amen. That's
[54:19] right. Yes, sir. So, politics is one
[54:23] side of the fence. I'm on the other. I
[54:25] said, I I voted once. That's for Christ.
[54:27] I'm sure to win. That's right. See, you
[54:30] got a vote coming. See, God voted for
[54:33] you. The devil voted against you. Now,
[54:35] which way you cast your votes where
[54:37] you're coming out.
[54:39] So now I believe this person is just I'm
[54:41] going to think that it's just nervous.
[54:43] If there's nothing condemning you, go
[54:45] right on and just say get away from me,
[54:47] Satan. Just move right on. Take the
[54:49] initiative and live for God. Now is
[54:53] there ever any condition
[54:57] wherein it's u
[55:00] permissible to remarry after a divorce
[55:04] according to I see if this is a I think
[55:06] there's two or three questions on this.
[55:07] according to the scriptures. Um um if I
[55:11] do not uh if I do not remain married
[55:17] in pre from previous times it is there
[55:20] any group grounds for divorce that
[55:23] permits you even to remarry? I will be
[55:27] uh I will be the uh buying the tape.
[55:32] Yeah. To get this uh answered. Uh thank
[55:36] you very much. I'll look for it Sunday.
[55:38] Well, now I have said this, you see,
[55:40] don't don't uh let me just leave that
[55:42] alone, you see, until we get to a place
[55:44] where now where we'll this will all be
[55:47] straightened out and uh you just
[55:49] remember that's God willing, as soon as
[55:52] I come back again, next time I come, the
[55:54] Lord willing, I'll preach on that
[55:56] subject. See, and now and then we'll
[56:00] tape it anyhow. If it hurts, it hurts.
[56:02] If it clears up, it clears up. But you
[56:04] just be of a good courage.
[56:06] Dear brother Brandon, is it possible for
[56:08] one to have the baptism of the Holy
[56:11] Ghost and not to have the signs
[56:13] following at at least not until some
[56:18] future time and conditions appointed by
[56:21] the spirit? Now, that might sound like a
[56:24] mixed up question, but that's a good
[56:26] one.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Very good. See now here gives me a
[56:30] little chance that I find that's working
[56:32] with my my family here now. See, I mean
[56:36] you, my family, and the family out in
[56:38] the world where we where our tapes go.
[56:42] Now, a great part of my congregation is
[56:45] made up of Pentecostal people. And uh
[56:48] because uh our Pentecost is the latest
[56:51] message that we have uh in the
[56:54] denominational ranks. And to me, I
[56:58] certainly agree with them more than any
[57:01] other denominational church. I hang
[57:03] towards the Pentecostal because it is a
[57:05] the later message. And all my converts
[57:08] that I bring to Christ, I try to direct
[57:11] them to some Pentecostal church, but I
[57:13] have condemned them in every way that I
[57:16] know how that they were wrong in the
[57:17] scripture by being a denomination and
[57:19] not willing to walk in light when
[57:21] light's presented to them. But yet, if I
[57:23] had to take my choice today to take any
[57:26] church in the world, I'd take
[57:28] Pentecostal when it come to
[57:29] denomination. But when it comes to
[57:31] individuals as men and women, there's
[57:34] genuine Christians and all them
[57:36] denominations, Methodists, Baptist,
[57:37] Presbyterian, Lutheran, and so forth.
[57:40] But I'm talking about the systems that
[57:42] these people are in. Not never the
[57:44] individual, but the system that these
[57:46] people has been caught into in their
[57:48] denomination. They clearly understand
[57:50] that now. See that? I think the people
[57:53] if they're Roman Catholic, Jehovah
[57:55] Witness, Orthodox, Jew, whatever they
[57:58] are, that doesn't matter to me. But they
[58:00] are individuals to which Christ died to
[58:03] save and I I in agreeing with their
[58:06] systems that they're in. I believe it's
[58:08] just as many Christians out there in the
[58:10] Baptist as there is in the Methodists or
[58:12] the Presbyterians or whatever more.
[58:13] They're Christians, real believers. And
[58:15] right out in Roman Catholic Church,
[58:16] there's genuine people in there that's
[58:19] real men and women that love the Lord.
[58:21] And they don't join that church to be
[58:23] wrong. They join that to be right. But
[58:26] it's a system in there that directs
[58:28] their mind the wrong way. And if ever
[58:31] comes to a time that I make a
[58:32] denomination, I have deceived you and
[58:35] have brought you into a system. Farbid
[58:38] from me and may God keep me in my right
[58:40] mind to direct you to Jesus Christ, the
[58:42] word.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Stay with that. But now this person here
[58:46] is asking the question
[58:49] about the possibility of having the
[58:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost without signs
[58:54] following them. Now it would um if you
[58:59] are born again, you are if you are born
[59:03] first as a human being and a normal
[59:06] human being. Now, I'm answering this in
[59:09] a in a a real juvenile way of doing it,
[59:12] but if you're born a normal human being,
[59:15] you will actually do the things that a
[59:18] normal human being would do. Is that
[59:20] right? When you're born as a human, the
[59:23] natural traits of a human being will
[59:26] follow you. You won't live in a tree and
[59:29] try to fly with your wings like a bird
[59:31] or or something like that. That isn't
[59:33] that wouldn't be a normal human being.
[59:36] The normal actions of a human being, the
[59:39] normal action of a human being would be
[59:41] to work, have marry, have family, and do
[59:44] these things. That's natural normal
[59:47] human beings because you're born that.
[59:50] Then when you're born a Christian,
[59:54] born of the spirit of God, you naturally
[59:57] take up the attributes of Christ.
[1:00:04] You see, now if we took here this
[1:00:06] morning and this congregation where you
[1:00:08] people sat here and listened day after
[1:00:10] day and so forth to the teaching, you'll
[1:00:13] find out you'd be different one from
[1:00:15] another because you you're different.
[1:00:17] Your your makeup different, your your
[1:00:19] appetites are different. You you eat
[1:00:21] different, but you all eat food.
[1:00:24] But now just from one individual being
[1:00:27] just like the other, you're different
[1:00:28] one from another. Christians do the same
[1:00:30] thing.
[1:00:32] You can't uh say now all do all speak
[1:00:35] with tongues do all prophesy to all. See
[1:00:37] you have to watch these things because a
[1:00:40] Christian takes up the the habits of a
[1:00:44] Christian
[1:00:45] and they live like a Christian. Jesus
[1:00:47] said these signs shall follow them that
[1:00:51] believe. Notice in my name they shall
[1:00:54] cast out devils. They shall take up
[1:00:57] serpents or drink deadly things and
[1:00:59] they'll speak with new tongues and and
[1:01:01] them things just actually follow
[1:01:04] Christians.
[1:01:05] Now the person has a very good thing
[1:01:07] here. Or do we wait until the future
[1:01:10] time? Are the conditions appointed by
[1:01:13] the Holy Spirit? I like that.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; See now you get the idea. When it's
[1:01:19] appointed by the Holy Spirit.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; God appoints things. And there I think
[1:01:26] if the Pentecostal people would try it
[1:01:29] at listens to this tape, you'll
[1:01:31] understand me if you get here why I
[1:01:34] different with you pressing that idea
[1:01:36] that they must all speak with tongues.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Uh I I cannot see that right because to
[1:01:44] be I like cherry pie but there's no need
[1:01:47] and I'm a human being but there's no
[1:01:49] need of me trying to tell if you don't
[1:01:50] eat cherry pie you're not a human being.
[1:01:52] You see, but eating cherry pie is just
[1:01:54] one of the habits of a human being. See,
[1:01:56] you might disagree with me upon that,
[1:01:58] but but it's true. Now, one will eat
[1:02:01] this and one will do something else.
[1:02:04] Now, the Holy Spirit appoints these
[1:02:08] offices. But when you try to force
[1:02:10] yourself into it, if I said you had to
[1:02:13] eat cherry pie, what if cherry pie made
[1:02:14] you vomit?
[1:02:16] And yet you'd vomit and try to eat
[1:02:18] cherry pie. vomiting. See, you're you're
[1:02:21] you're hurting yourself. And that's the
[1:02:23] way you try to do when you try to force
[1:02:25] yourself to do something that's contrary
[1:02:27] to the spirit.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; He's got your life laotted for a certain
[1:02:30] thing.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; See, and you when you're filled with the
[1:02:37] spirit, here's one of the best signs I
[1:02:39] know. You're so in love with Christ and
[1:02:41] believe every word that he says to be
[1:02:43] the truth.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the evidence that you have
[1:02:46] the Holy Spirit and your life's full of
[1:02:48] joy and oh my everything's different
[1:02:52] than what it used to be. That's the Holy
[1:02:54] Spirit. Now these gifts are in the Holy
[1:02:56] Spirit.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Now if this congregation this morning,
[1:03:00] this uh just a nice snug church full
[1:03:02] with the overflow rooms of course is
[1:03:04] filled up. But in just not announcing we
[1:03:07] was going to answer these questions, but
[1:03:09] these people had just come in. Notice if
[1:03:12] every person in here was in perfectly
[1:03:15] harmony with the Holy Spirit, every one
[1:03:18] of you was filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:03:20] and in harmony with the Holy Ghost,
[1:03:23] these signs would just be multiplying
[1:03:25] among you all the time.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; See, it just be constantly going. But
[1:03:29] where there's confusion,
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; where there's difference and where we
[1:03:33] set up, the Holy Spirit can't move
[1:03:34] itself. You see, it can't operate
[1:03:36] through the people. Amen. See, and there
[1:03:39] if I said now you uh each one of you,
[1:03:42] did you speak a tongues? Yeah. Well, you
[1:03:44] got it. Did you speak of them? No, you
[1:03:45] haven't got it. Now I'm making myself a
[1:03:47] judge.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; God is a judge of these things. But what
[1:03:50] if Jesus said, "These signs shall follow
[1:03:52] them." Amen.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; See, the groups that believe the whole
[1:03:56] nature of the Holy Spirit flows through
[1:03:58] them and all are full of love and joy
[1:04:02] and and just a great bundle of of of
[1:04:05] real godly fil people. See, that's the
[1:04:08] Holy Spirit.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; And then in there, they speak with
[1:04:11] tongues. On the occasion that tongues
[1:04:14] arise while necessary for that, they
[1:04:16] speak with tongues. And if there's a
[1:04:18] prophecy, it speaks and oh, it's just
[1:04:20] exactly perfect every time. Amen.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Ask those 15 or 20 people that went in
[1:04:26] their own interview this morning if it
[1:04:28] was one word anyway minced in anyway and
[1:04:30] perfect strangers
[1:04:32] what the Holy Spirit dig right down in
[1:04:34] there and get them things and bring them
[1:04:35] right out and tell it to them. See, see,
[1:04:38] there's not no mistakes in it. Tell them
[1:04:41] this exactly what this what this was and
[1:04:43] what that is and what this is to be done
[1:04:45] and things like that and what they've
[1:04:46] done and what they should do. See,
[1:04:49] that's just set it right in order. Now,
[1:04:51] they've got to act on that.
[1:04:54] The other night I was talking to a
[1:04:56] couple and uh I was at a a home where we
[1:05:01] was having a meeting or just a little
[1:05:02] sitting around a table talking and all
[1:05:05] at once the Holy Spirit dropped among us
[1:05:07] and I said to someone there I seen a
[1:05:10] certain man and he was confused in his
[1:05:13] mind about some things and I said like
[1:05:16] in the confusion and the and the the
[1:05:19] discernment I said now it's right here
[1:05:21] now. I said, "I know what you're
[1:05:22] thinking." And I went right back and
[1:05:25] just talked a roundabout way and
[1:05:26] answered every question that man had in
[1:05:28] his mind to him. And he nobody know what
[1:05:31] I was talking about but him. See, but he
[1:05:33] got it.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; He know what it's all about. You see,
[1:05:36] and that was what to him showing him,
[1:05:39] confirming to him that the Holy Spirit
[1:05:41] was revealing to me what was on his
[1:05:42] mind. You see, and I didn't have to tell
[1:05:44] it to the rest of them. The man's
[1:05:46] listening at me right now.
[1:05:48] That's right. Now, you see how that is?
[1:05:51] That's a confirmation.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Now, if the whole church would work in
[1:05:56] harmony like that, then among us, we'd
[1:05:58] be casting out devils, taking up
[1:06:00] serpents, drinking deadly things, all
[1:06:01] kinds of things going on. But when
[1:06:03] you're trying to force that to
[1:06:04] individuals,
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; then you get yourself that's Pentecostal
[1:06:08] again. Then you get babbling, confusion.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; You can't judge that. See, our hearts
[1:06:13] are full of joy and happiness and oh by
[1:06:16] the birds are singing, uh, everything's
[1:06:19] wonderful. my just full of the spirit of
[1:06:21] God and we're so in love with Jesus. We
[1:06:23] I want to pray all night.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Now, I wouldn't embarrass this crowd or
[1:06:29] even myself to you. But I wonder if I
[1:06:32] could ask this morning, which one in
[1:06:34] this crowd of this people that had the
[1:06:37] Holy Ghost, it'd probably be 95% of you
[1:06:40] raise your hands that you had the Holy
[1:06:42] Ghost. Then I'll turn around and give
[1:06:44] you a Bible evidence. just one
[1:06:48] of Bible evidence and I doubt where
[1:06:50] there be one or two hands go up.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; see, just could just tie it in such a
[1:06:57] place. But when you do that, see, you're
[1:06:59] also hurting your congregation. But you
[1:07:02] got to get them out of that babyhood and
[1:07:05] get them into manhood.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; like someone wrote the question the
[1:07:10] other day up here said about said
[1:07:12] something about brother Junior Jackson.
[1:07:14] Somebody went down there and they said,
[1:07:15] "You're going down to the dead beans or
[1:07:17] something really like that." Brother
[1:07:18] Jackson, because Brother Jackson's
[1:07:20] congregation, they let them speak with
[1:07:23] tongues just in the church wherever they
[1:07:25] feel the spirit, they want to speak in
[1:07:27] tongues, they go ahead and do it. Well,
[1:07:28] that's brother Jackson's church. That's
[1:07:31] perfectly all right. I've got nothing
[1:07:33] against that. Not a thing. Junior
[1:07:35] Jackson's one of my best friends and a
[1:07:37] real godly man filled with the spirit of
[1:07:39] God. And we're brothers. Now, he don't
[1:07:41] have to eat my cherry pie. I can or I
[1:07:44] don't have to eat his apple pie. See,
[1:07:45] but we're both eating pie. We both
[1:07:48] believe this message. Exactly. That's
[1:07:49] the order of the church. I said, I want
[1:07:51] my church to try to come together. I
[1:07:53] said, when we begin to break out, hear
[1:07:55] the Holy Spirit speaking in tongues and
[1:07:57] so forth. I said, somebody asked me and
[1:08:00] said, now, Brother Bram, is all that
[1:08:02] genuine? I said, I'm no judge. I said,
[1:08:05] tell you what, let's bring it to a spot.
[1:08:07] Let it go a while and bring it to the
[1:08:09] spot until the word is presented on it.
[1:08:12] Then watch it. If it's the Holy Spirit,
[1:08:13] it copes right with the word.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; If it doesn't, it won't.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; That's just the only way you can tell
[1:08:19] it. Then it it judges itself. You see?
[1:08:21] Well, it'll fly up. If it isn't the Holy
[1:08:23] Spirit, it'll fly loose. See? But if it
[1:08:25] is the Holy Spirit, it'll just meekly
[1:08:27] follow right in line because that's what
[1:08:28] it is. It's the Holy Spirit going right
[1:08:30] to its own order. Now, in this speaking
[1:08:34] in tongues and so forth, I wish every
[1:08:36] one of you spoke in tonesues. I sure do.
[1:08:40] And many times good Christians you see
[1:08:43] if I tell you that was on the program I
[1:08:45] found someone not program excuse me on
[1:08:47] the interviews this morning person I
[1:08:50] guess they're still here in the building
[1:08:51] that they about speaking with tongues
[1:08:54] the person is a genuine person a real
[1:08:58] person and they've lived right and
[1:09:00] they've heard me say that evidence the
[1:09:01] Holy Ghost wasn't speaking in tongues
[1:09:04] and it isn't but I advise that person to
[1:09:07] ask God to let them either speak in
[1:09:09] tones are prophesying because it's the
[1:09:11] nature. The first thing I went to that
[1:09:14] person and found their birth place
[1:09:18] and what sign that they were born under
[1:09:20] and could tell what their birth was,
[1:09:23] which way it set in their natural nature
[1:09:25] sets them in a certain line. Then when
[1:09:27] they're reborn again, they're over here
[1:09:29] in another nature. And then when you
[1:09:32] find into this nature, that's the inside
[1:09:34] in conscience. Inside conscience, the
[1:09:36] outside conscience moves you in one way.
[1:09:39] That's your natural birth. Then they'll
[1:09:41] make up something that puts them what?
[1:09:42] Under a four and puts them in a split
[1:09:44] condition. They don't know what to do.
[1:09:46] They'll say, "The Lord wants me to do
[1:09:48] this. The inside, oh, I just know it's
[1:09:50] it's it lines up with the scripture."
[1:09:52] And they'll start to do it. And the
[1:09:53] first thing you know, Satan on this
[1:09:55] outside will show them all kinds of
[1:09:57] defects in it. Then they say, "Well, I
[1:09:59] guess see see they listen to Satan."
[1:10:02] Amen.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; See, you got to take that inside
[1:10:05] something
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; that what's on the inside of you is
[1:10:09] scriptural.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; And don't let Satan stand anywhere. It's
[1:10:12] that's his duty to stand there and pound
[1:10:14] at you like that. Don't you listen to
[1:10:16] him. But that person, I told him, I
[1:10:18] said, "Well, if I could just be sure of
[1:10:20] having the Holy Ghost, see, a dandy
[1:10:23] person, real loyal person with the Holy
[1:10:26] Ghost, but it would be good for her to
[1:10:28] say, "Father, uh, just give me this for
[1:10:30] something to stand up." Now, if I taught
[1:10:32] it like that, people would reach out and
[1:10:33] get a hold of that without having what
[1:10:35] that person's got.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; See, the Holy Ghost does speak with
[1:10:39] tongues. But you've got to have the Holy
[1:10:41] Ghost first before it can speak with
[1:10:43] tongues.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Now, you get it.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; So, if you reach out and get a hold of a
[1:10:48] gift of speaking in tongues without, now
[1:10:50] remember that can be a genuine gift
[1:10:53] that could be the Holy Ghost speaking in
[1:10:55] you with unknown tongues and you'd be
[1:10:58] lost and go to hell. The Bible said so.
[1:11:03] You believe that? Would you like to have
[1:11:04] scripture on it?
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; You want scripture? Raise your hand.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Though I speak with tongues as men and
[1:11:10] angels.
[1:11:12] Is that right?
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Both the one that can be interpreted and
[1:11:15] that cannot be interpreted. Genuine Holy
[1:11:17] Ghost tongues.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; I am nothing.
[1:11:22] See, unless that other goes with it.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; You can have this. See, so don't reach
[1:11:26] after that without this. Get this first
[1:11:27] and then that'll actually follow it.
[1:11:30] Now the rain falls on the just and the
[1:11:33] unjust. The sun shines on the wicked and
[1:11:35] the good. The rain falls to right the
[1:11:38] crop. It rightens the weed also. The
[1:11:41] same rain the Holy Spirit can fall on a
[1:11:44] group of people and speak in tongues and
[1:11:45] make it exactly true. Spawn amongst the
[1:11:48] people and make it uh prophesy and be
[1:11:50] exactly true.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Sometimes you can
[1:11:54] go to a witch or a medium and they can
[1:11:56] tell you something that's exactly right.
[1:11:59] Look at the witch of Endor
[1:12:02] to Saul. It can be exactly true. That's
[1:12:05] still, isn't it?
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; They're witches.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Speaking in tongues. I've seen devils
[1:12:10] speak in tongues and right in unknown
[1:12:12] tongues. That don't mean anything.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; But the real thing is that word again,
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; back to that word.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; So, you can do these things without the
[1:12:21] word, but when you get the word and it
[1:12:22] does it, then watch it just exactly come
[1:12:24] to pass. Exactly the right thing. See,
[1:12:26] man, you're exactly in. Yes, the Holy
[1:12:29] Spirit uses these people as it's
[1:12:31] appointed by his own divine wisdom.
[1:12:34] But the first thing now what? Let me
[1:12:36] just give you a little twister here in
[1:12:37] just a minute. I'd say how many has the
[1:12:39] Holy Ghost? All of you raise up your
[1:12:41] hand. I'd say all right, I'll see if you
[1:12:43] have. The Bible said that they that had
[1:12:45] the Holy Ghost sighed and cried day and
[1:12:48] night
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; for the abominations done in the city.
[1:12:51] Now, how many hands will go up?
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; How many of you can't rest at night? So
[1:12:56] full of joy, the power of God,
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; and so sad for the people it's lost that
[1:13:01] day and night you weep and cry for the
[1:13:03] abominations you want.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Who would be that in the city? How many
[1:13:08] is that in the church? That's what the
[1:13:10] Bible said the Holy Spirit evidence was.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; He told the sealing angel, Ezekiel,
[1:13:16] that's right. He said, "Take, go through
[1:13:18] the city and set a mark upon those who
[1:13:20] sign cry for the abominations did in the
[1:13:23] city. The rest of them let the
[1:13:24] destroying angel destroy them.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; No matter how much members they was and
[1:13:28] how many things they done said, put a
[1:13:30] and a man with the inkorn rider dressed
[1:13:32] in white, which will represent the Holy
[1:13:34] Spirit, came forth and put a mark upon
[1:13:36] all them that sigh and cried for the
[1:13:38] abominations done in the city.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Now you see, and watch what he said in
[1:13:44] there also. Slay utterly little
[1:13:46] children, old women, babies, kill them
[1:13:49] all.
[1:13:52] little children. Yes.
[1:13:55] When Joshua entered the land of Canaan,
[1:13:57] he said, "Don't you let one of them
[1:13:59] live."
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; If it's a cute little baby, a little
[1:14:03] Amalachite or Amorite, kill it.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; You remember, he'll grow up to be an
[1:14:09] Amalachite.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; He'll pollute the camp. And when those
[1:14:13] little things come back like disagreeing
[1:14:15] with the word of God, get rid of that
[1:14:16] thing. I don't care what denomination
[1:14:18] belongs to.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; you say, "Well, they're good." I don't
[1:14:21] care how good a people they are. If
[1:14:23] they're contrary to that word, get the
[1:14:25] thing out of you.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; It's a growing little Amalachite. It
[1:14:29] looks cute. Looks innocent. It looks
[1:14:31] like it's all right, but don't you have
[1:14:33] anything to do with it? You stay away
[1:14:34] from it.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Brandon, I I go down here
[1:14:38] because well, I don't you just remember
[1:14:41] any Amalachite, anything that denies the
[1:14:43] word, stay away from it,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; have nothing to do with it at all.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many believe that's the
[1:14:50] truth?
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Sure is. See, stay away from it.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; The sigh cry for the abominations that's
[1:14:57] did in the city. Where do you see that?
[1:15:00] I can show you 10,000 speaking in
[1:15:02] tongues to one that's really burdened
[1:15:05] for sin that can't even pray an hour.
[1:15:11] But did you know the Bible said that
[1:15:13] Mark only those who sigh and cried for
[1:15:15] the abominations in the city? How many
[1:15:17] ever read it?
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Sure. Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; That was the Holy Spirit come forth to
[1:15:21] mark the people and said to the
[1:15:23] destroying angel, "Go forth and destroy
[1:15:26] everything that doesn't have that mark
[1:15:27] upon them." And the mark of God is the
[1:15:30] Holy Ghost.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; There's a seal of God. Now, where is
[1:15:34] them people that's that interested? I
[1:15:35] can carry people that jump up and down
[1:15:37] and cry in the church. I can show you
[1:15:38] people shout and run over the building.
[1:15:40] I can show you people that prophesy and
[1:15:42] it comes to pass. I show you those who
[1:15:44] speak in tongues and run up and down the
[1:15:46] buildings and say things that actually
[1:15:48] interpret comes to pass. But where is
[1:15:49] that person
[1:15:52] that size and cries for the abominations
[1:15:54] did in the city? Where's that burden
[1:15:56] soul?
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; You can turn some new leaves on there.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; See what I mean? Now, I've tried my best
[1:16:05] to to to tell you people and lead you
[1:16:08] like a daddy would lead his children.
[1:16:10] You are my children. I have begotten you
[1:16:13] to Christ through this gospel that I
[1:16:14] preach. See, and I I I want you to raise
[1:16:18] up fully matured kids or or children. I
[1:16:21] want to present you to Christ that day
[1:16:23] as Paul said, a chase virgin.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; You think that word, but what your heart
[1:16:28] will punctuate amen to it.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Sin don't of course you'll do things
[1:16:33] wrong. But when the very first thing
[1:16:35] condemns you, Father, forgive me.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say this. Just looked at a
[1:16:40] person a few minutes ago. He was asked
[1:16:42] me by a fine boy the other day was
[1:16:44] hunting squirrels. That morning I got
[1:16:46] five. I left one for that afternoon. He
[1:16:48] only get six in the state of Kentucky.
[1:16:50] That's a limit. So this certain person
[1:16:52] said I got nine.
[1:16:56] Christian boy. Fine kid. I said you've
[1:16:58] done wrong.
[1:17:01] You did wrong. He said I said I had five
[1:17:05] that morning. Save one for that
[1:17:07] afternoon. And when I got that one
[1:17:08] squirrel, looked in a tree and counted
[1:17:10] five or six sitting right there where I
[1:17:11] could look at them. Walked out and left
[1:17:13] them. I said, I walked up in a tree not
[1:17:15] long. There's about 15 or 20 sitting
[1:17:17] there. I just took the limit and walk
[1:17:19] away and left the rest of them there.
[1:17:21] I said, if I come to this country
[1:17:23] preaching to you boys and you people
[1:17:25] here, the thing that's right, I've got
[1:17:27] to live that example.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Christianity ain't what you say, it's
[1:17:31] what you live. What you do, it's an
[1:17:34] example. You're the salt of the earth. I
[1:17:38] said, "Then the law says, Jesus said,
[1:17:41] you give Caesar then things that belong
[1:17:43] to Caesar." If you break that speed law
[1:17:46] out there, what are you doing? You're
[1:17:48] doing wrong. You sin.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Give Caesar what's Caesars's. And God,
[1:17:53] what's God say? Well, the law's wrong. I
[1:17:54] can't help what wrong it is. It's wrong
[1:17:57] to break Jesus commandment. And if you
[1:18:00] don't give Caesar the things of Caesars,
[1:18:02] then you did what Jesus told you not to
[1:18:03] do in a transgressor of the law of sin.
[1:18:06] Is
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; that right?
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; We're all guilty. We do it. But when you
[1:18:10] see yourself wrong, stop it.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; People are watching you.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; People won't go to church, but they'll
[1:18:17] read you. See what you do.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; So get Christ in your heart.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; That's a real Christ. The Holy Spirit's
[1:18:23] the same thing.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit. Christ means the anointed
[1:18:28] one. And the Holy Spirit is that
[1:18:30] anointed.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; And you are the one that's anointed.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; See, and it's Christ in you anointing
[1:18:36] you.
[1:18:38] See what I mean?
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Man, you got the right thing. Then he
[1:18:41] can use you to anything he wants to use
[1:18:42] you because you're in the body and
[1:18:44] subject to any of those gifts. But see,
[1:18:46] to have one of the gifts outside of the
[1:18:48] body, it would do you no good. Though I
[1:18:49] speak with tongue of men and angels,
[1:18:51] have not charity, it profit me nothing.
[1:18:53] Though I have faith and can understand
[1:18:55] all the mysteries of God, profit me
[1:18:57] nothing. the lie uh give my body to be
[1:18:59] burnt as a sacrifice give all my goods
[1:19:01] to the poor though I have faith to move
[1:19:03] a mountain I am nothing see don't depend
[1:19:07] on those things the Holy Spirit is a
[1:19:10] being it's God
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; God in you the person God that's lit
[1:19:17] your whole entire being you're changed
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; you're a new creature any little thing
[1:19:23] that's wrong he'll tell you that's wrong
[1:19:24] don't do it
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; father I didn't mean to do that you
[1:19:27] forgive
[1:19:28] See, and that's that's the Holy Spirit.
[1:19:30] I don't care how much you spoke in hung,
[1:19:32] how much you run, how much you jumped,
[1:19:33] how much you did this, that, the other.
[1:19:35] Hey, whatever you done,
[1:19:38] it wouldn't mean a thing if the Holy
[1:19:40] Spirit wasn't in there to condemn you on
[1:19:41] the things that's right and wrong.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Now, that's reason this person here is
[1:19:46] right. Let the Holy Spirit do it. But
[1:19:49] now, you see, now what's causing this?
[1:19:53] Let me say it with love. sprinkled with
[1:19:55] love and and anointed with the word.
[1:19:59] If the genuine Holy Spirit was in you,
[1:20:02] you wouldn't question that. You know it
[1:20:05] yourself. It's an individual thing
[1:20:07] between you and God. See, you know that
[1:20:10] something's happening. You know that
[1:20:12] there's a change where there's any
[1:20:14] anything else. You yourself, you're the
[1:20:16] change.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; See, you're the one that's going to
[1:20:19] change it inside of you. And you know
[1:20:21] you have it. Whether you spoke a tong,
[1:20:23] whether you jump shouted or anything
[1:20:25] else, you know that God lives in you,
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; that you don't walk with your own mind.
[1:20:29] It's the mind of Christ that leads you
[1:20:31] with that word just exactly the way it
[1:20:33] goes. Now, but I would if people say,
[1:20:36] "Well, then brother, you don't believe
[1:20:37] you ought to speak with tongues." See,
[1:20:38] then you get exactly backwards what I've
[1:20:40] just said. Sure, I believe you should
[1:20:42] speak with tongues. And some of you
[1:20:44] people see, but you get this and I get
[1:20:47] this like back here this 1500 miles. You
[1:20:49] see, being here at the tabernacle, just
[1:20:51] if you don't understand it, then ask me.
[1:20:54] See, write it back to me. If you don't
[1:20:55] understand, just say what I say here.
[1:20:57] You see, and I you, as Paul said, you
[1:20:59] follow me as I follow Christ. You see,
[1:21:01] then you see I'm wrong and get away from
[1:21:03] me. See, that's all because I I'd be the
[1:21:05] wrong person. See, please explain.
[1:21:08] People are saying, "Brother Brandom is
[1:21:12] more than a man. He can create and Jesus
[1:21:17] can look just like brother Brandon. Now
[1:21:24] let me the person said this whoever it
[1:21:26] might be I don't know but I am your
[1:21:31] brother.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; See Jesus is your savior. I cannot be
[1:21:36] your savior for he has already saved
[1:21:39] you. Now you're so close to being the
[1:21:42] truth there and yet so far from the
[1:21:44] truth. The person that told this person
[1:21:46] this now it's just a looks to me like a
[1:21:48] woman's handwriting. Very beautiful
[1:21:49] handwriting. And I'd say that was a
[1:21:52] woman's handwriting.
[1:21:56] And I don't know who is see now brother
[1:21:59] Brandon uh could Jesus look like you or
[1:22:02] you be Jesus or something like that. One
[1:22:05] sense the word that's exactly the truth.
[1:22:08] Another sense the word is an antichrist.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; That's the difference between right and
[1:22:12] wrong.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; To make me the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:16] Christ would be an antichrist.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; See, for that person of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:21] is sitting at the right hand of the
[1:22:22] majesty on high
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; and will come again in great power and
[1:22:26] glory.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; But for his life that was in him being
[1:22:29] upon me and upon you who have him,
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; it's exactly the truth. and you become
[1:22:37] Christ.
[1:22:39] Remember my message on messiahs.
[1:22:42] See you are the word messiah means the
[1:22:47] anointed one. Now you are if you have
[1:22:51] the holy spirit you become the anointed
[1:22:54] one. See then there's all kinds of
[1:22:57] anointed ones. Now watch if it's a bible
[1:23:00] anointed ones. Many of them are
[1:23:02] anointed. See, the whole thing is in
[1:23:04] such a great conglomeration of every
[1:23:07] kind of a mixup and a and a a Satan with
[1:23:09] all of his cunningness coming and
[1:23:11] impersonated just to the dot almost to
[1:23:13] the dot. There's only one way you can
[1:23:16] absolutely be sure. Check the word by
[1:23:19] word, word by word. That's the only way
[1:23:22] you can.
[1:23:24] But to me as a a person William Brham or
[1:23:29] or any other man or woman to be the Lord
[1:23:34] Jesus Christ our savior that is an era.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; But to be anointed with his spirit which
[1:23:41] brings his own person of his life into
[1:23:45] you. It was so beautifully typed in
[1:23:48] Elijah and Elisha.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. when Elisha was taking up Elijah
[1:23:53] the old prophet going home and he's
[1:23:56] tired and weary and there's a chariot
[1:23:58] hooked across the river there and he uh
[1:24:00] to take him up home with horses of fire
[1:24:03] and um did you notice that when Elijah
[1:24:05] and Elisha crossed the river the school
[1:24:08] of the prophets is up there watching him
[1:24:10] and Elijah took his mantle and or struck
[1:24:13] the river and when it did it uh divided
[1:24:15] and he went across and he said to the
[1:24:18] young prophet uh what what are Follow me
[1:24:20] for what? What? What do you wish? He
[1:24:22] said that a double portion of your
[1:24:24] spirit come up on me.
[1:24:27] A double portion of that mighty prophet
[1:24:30] come upon me. He said, "You've asked a
[1:24:32] hard thing. But if you see me when I go
[1:24:36] away, then it'll come up on you." So you
[1:24:38] can imagine how he watched the prophet.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Now in that day, that prophet was the
[1:24:44] word for he was the manifestation of the
[1:24:47] word
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; to the word. And he know there had to be
[1:24:50] a greater ministry come because it
[1:24:52] required a greater thing.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus is here on earth, he was
[1:24:57] the Elijah. These things that I do shall
[1:25:00] you do also. Greater than these things
[1:25:03] shall you do because I go unto my
[1:25:05] father. Now how you going to do it?
[1:25:07] Watch him. Who is he? The word.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:25:13] watch him. Now when it comes to creation
[1:25:16] of things, it's true. Jesus never right
[1:25:18] straight out created anything. He
[1:25:20] brought it into existence. He took a
[1:25:22] substance first. He took water, made
[1:25:24] wine. He took bread and made more bread.
[1:25:27] He took fish and made more fish.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; But he promised that greater things of
[1:25:31] this would be done.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; See?
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; You see now why it's in a more evil day
[1:25:38] than it was when he was here.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; See, it's still him
[1:25:42] but using your tabernacle. See, and this
[1:25:46] person that's in you, which is your
[1:25:48] birth, you are John Doe. You were born
[1:25:51] in a certain month, and you were born
[1:25:53] under a certain star. You were born
[1:25:54] under a certain thing. And that has
[1:25:56] something to do with you. Certainly
[1:25:58] does. I know. I used to, Papa, you say,
[1:26:01] "I can't plant them potatoes at this
[1:26:02] time because the moon isn't right." You
[1:26:05] can't plant them potatoes, Billy. And I
[1:26:06] said, "I'm not planting them in the
[1:26:08] moon. I'm planting them here in the
[1:26:10] ground."
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "All right, smart. Come on. You
[1:26:15] get a few bumps on your head, you learn
[1:26:17] something.
[1:26:18] I did. I did. I tell you, take a board
[1:26:22] and lay it down out there on the grass
[1:26:24] in the dark of the moon and watch what
[1:26:26] happens. That grass will die right now.
[1:26:29] Lay it on the light of the moon. You let
[1:26:31] lay there a weekend. Won't hurt it a
[1:26:32] bit.
[1:26:34] Watch that sea. When that moon changes
[1:26:36] shter, when the tide when the moon goes
[1:26:37] out, the tide follows it out and it's
[1:26:40] millions of miles from the earth. Not
[1:26:43] only that, go down here in the state of
[1:26:44] Kentucky and sink a rod down the ground
[1:26:45] till you get into the salt water and
[1:26:47] watch that pipe how deep it is when the
[1:26:49] when the tides in and watch how it goes
[1:26:50] out plum across under the earth.
[1:26:54] Certainly
[1:26:55] you plant something that spreads out on
[1:26:57] top of the earth in the dark moon. Watch
[1:26:58] it go right down make a like a reddish a
[1:27:00] turnup wheel and you plant it back the
[1:27:02] other way and watch it spread out on top
[1:27:03] of the earth. Sure, it's got something
[1:27:05] to do. Why did Aaron have on his
[1:27:07] breastplate the birth stone of each one
[1:27:10] of those patriarchs? Look at those
[1:27:11] mothers when they give the utterance.
[1:27:13] When that mothers and them Hebrew women
[1:27:15] and labor giving utterance to those
[1:27:17] children being born, it placed their
[1:27:19] name. It told their birth. It put them
[1:27:21] in the homeland and set them over to
[1:27:23] eternity.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; One of these days when I come in and
[1:27:27] stay a little, I'll take that subject.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Exactly. And then watch Jacob when he
[1:27:32] was dying there, when he laid his hands
[1:27:33] up on the patriarchs and blessed them,
[1:27:35] he tell them exactly where they would
[1:27:36] be. And that's exactly according to
[1:27:38] their name and exactly according to
[1:27:40] their birth.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Sure, it has something to do with you.
[1:27:44] Now, that's your birth path. That's what
[1:27:47] you are, a natural man or natural woman.
[1:27:49] But when you're reborn again, that's not
[1:27:52] the outside conscience. The outside is
[1:27:55] what you see, taste, feel, smell, and
[1:27:57] hear. But the inside of that is what you
[1:28:00] really are.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Now, this out here, Satan's temption
[1:28:04] knocks you around everywhere here. But
[1:28:05] down here, he can't do it unless you let
[1:28:07] him do it. For in here, you've got
[1:28:09] faith. And faith don't come from the
[1:28:11] outer conscience. It's reasons.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; But in faith, there's no reason. You've
[1:28:16] got it from God and you know it's there.
[1:28:18] I don't care how much it looks wrong.
[1:28:19] You still owe it right. Thus sayeth the
[1:28:21] Lord.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; It's nothing going to bother that.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Nothing can bother that. It's moving
[1:28:27] right straight on.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Difficult means nothing to it. Wait
[1:28:31] right on through it. For it's a word and
[1:28:33] the word's a sword and a word cuts the
[1:28:36] sword cuts itself free from everything
[1:28:37] else. See,
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; takes a hand of faith to hold that word.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; That faith got be now. See, when that
[1:28:43] inside conscience, here's the inside.
[1:28:45] Here's the outside. It's revealed in
[1:28:47] here. Truth is out here. It's reason.
[1:28:50] Now, don't it look reasonable if we just
[1:28:51] say we just all go over and join the
[1:28:53] assemblies. Now, I like the assemblies
[1:28:55] of God. I like the oneness. I like all
[1:28:57] those churches. Well, we just all go and
[1:28:59] affiliate with them. Maybe do some good.
[1:29:01] That's the reason the outside. But down
[1:29:03] on the inside,
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; watch it. when you see out here this
[1:29:07] will this will disagree then look at the
[1:29:10] assembly many things that they do that I
[1:29:12] don't believe it's scriptural and can
[1:29:14] prove it to them it's not scriptural but
[1:29:16] there's so many minds packed up in it
[1:29:18] these thousands of those assembly
[1:29:20] brothers and sisters who believe this
[1:29:22] the word and don't believe what the
[1:29:24] assemblies teach to be right
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; but they're in the web the Baptist the
[1:29:29] presenter the oneness and all the rest
[1:29:31] of them they're in that web where a
[1:29:32] group of man gets together and they
[1:29:34] reason and they so What's a prestige
[1:29:37] about a man? Here's a bishop sitting
[1:29:39] here. General overseer. He says
[1:29:42] anything. What's the little fellow going
[1:29:43] to say? He's afraid to say anything. I
[1:29:46] agree with you. Yeah, that's right.
[1:29:47] Uhhuh. Yes. Bishop or president or
[1:29:49] you're That's exactly right. He agrees
[1:29:51] with him. Here, let's take an alcoholic
[1:29:54] out here on the street that an ordinary
[1:29:56] citizen pass down the street and say,
[1:29:57] "Oh, bum." Nothing to him. Take him down
[1:30:01] here and put him on the police force and
[1:30:02] put a badge on him and a gun on him.
[1:30:04] Good morning, John. It's so nice to see
[1:30:07] you again. See,
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; respect to one another. Jesus said, "How
[1:30:11] can you have faith?"
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; When you have respects that type, you
[1:30:17] know, uh slice of respects one, I don't
[1:30:20] remember just how the word goes there,
[1:30:22] but when your desire respects one from
[1:30:25] another. See, you can't do that. And
[1:30:27] when man gets together and organized
[1:30:29] down and the little man's afraid to say
[1:30:31] anything, goes, "The bishop said so."
[1:30:33] The preserver said so. But don't
[1:30:36] disregard the man. Believe him to be a
[1:30:38] good man. But always remember God's word
[1:30:41] is right and all others contrary is
[1:30:44] wrong.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Let my word be true and every man's word
[1:30:47] be a lie.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; See it. That's what we want to do is
[1:30:50] believe that. Now remember, we are not
[1:30:53] the word but we are the word.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Now you got it. Amen.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus was not God, but he was God.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; He was a man, yet he was God.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; He could cry and yet he could raise the
[1:31:08] dead. He could cry for a man being dead
[1:31:10] and raise him back up again.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; He was Jehovah Gyra, Jehovah Rapi,
[1:31:17] Jehovah Manasses. He was Jehovah
[1:31:20] completely. He was Jehovah. And yet he
[1:31:22] was a man.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; He owned the earth and made the earth
[1:31:26] and had not a place to lay his head.
[1:31:30] He said, "The birds that I made got
[1:31:31] nests and I ain't got a place to lay my
[1:31:33] head. The foxes that are created has
[1:31:35] holes in the ground. I haven't got one
[1:31:37] myself even to be buried in." That's
[1:31:39] right. He had to borrow somebody's grave
[1:31:41] to be buried in. He created every womb
[1:31:43] that was in a woman. He had no womb to
[1:31:46] be born in. He had to borrow a womb.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; He created the earth and had not a place
[1:31:51] to be buried at. He had a bar hole in
[1:31:53] the ground to be buried in.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:56] Joseph of Arthia. See they had they had
[1:32:00] had to bar a place yet he was God.
[1:32:03] Proved that he was God. Now you
[1:32:06] understand we are not. We are messiahs
[1:32:09] but not that Jesus. He is our father.
[1:32:14] We're just anointed with his spirit and
[1:32:15] that's the reason his life. And that
[1:32:17] gets people see if you don't sit and
[1:32:19] think it through it gets people to
[1:32:20] believe well this guy would be the
[1:32:21] Messiah. Sure he is. This one over here
[1:32:25] could be. They both are. See? Well, how
[1:32:27] can it be two of them? There's thousands
[1:32:29] of them. See, but you see his life is
[1:32:33] separated on the day of Pentecost when
[1:32:34] that pillar of fire came down. It's
[1:32:36] separated like tongues and set upon each
[1:32:37] of them. God dividing himself among his
[1:32:40] people because the church in Christ is
[1:32:42] one. This is a husband and wife is one.
[1:32:45] Brother Brandham, how am I supposed to
[1:32:50] show my wife that I really care for her?
[1:32:54] And yet uh play
[1:32:57] or stay with the word that say stay with
[1:33:00] the word but still having a question
[1:33:03] like this said why don't you practice
[1:33:07] what you preach or believe. Well, then
[1:33:10] if the wife
[1:33:13] if the wife is saying this to you when
[1:33:15] she's has a right to say it, you better
[1:33:19] get right.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Then if she is if she is saying it just
[1:33:25] to be evil, remember the Bible said it
[1:33:28] was better that a millstone was hanged
[1:33:30] at your neck and drowned in the depths
[1:33:32] of the sea than even to offend the least
[1:33:35] of these my little ones. That's just
[1:33:38] great.
[1:33:40] And maybe that this wife is not that
[1:33:42] type of person.
[1:33:45] Maybe she's a different or maybe she's a
[1:33:46] good person. Maybe she's just testing
[1:33:48] you to see what she'll do.
[1:33:52] Now stay in love with her and let her
[1:33:55] see Jesus in you. You do that. See, you
[1:33:59] just go on some I give a little
[1:34:01] illustration this morning about a
[1:34:02] person. One time this little woman had
[1:34:06] received the Holy Ghost. She was very
[1:34:08] sweet little person.
[1:34:09] She said, "Well, she had a hard life and
[1:34:12] her husband was an alcoholic." And so,
[1:34:14] um, she just kept on. She bore with him.
[1:34:17] He, "You want to go to church, honey?
[1:34:18] Take off." But I went out to Slooh down
[1:34:20] at the old Brown Derby down here. Going
[1:34:22] on. So, they hung out down there all the
[1:34:23] time. Used to be Bonifers. Many of you
[1:34:25] oldtimes you remember Bonifer had their
[1:34:27] own corner. It's called the Brown Derby
[1:34:28] now, I believe it is. So, hanging around
[1:34:30] down there and the first thing you know,
[1:34:32] one night come up question about church,
[1:34:35] about Christians. One of the old drunks
[1:34:37] sitting there said there ain't no such a
[1:34:38] thing as Christians anymore. There is no
[1:34:41] such a thing. All this bunch of
[1:34:43] hypocrites said seem smoking, drinking,
[1:34:45] doing the same thing that we do. And
[1:34:49] said call themselves Christians. There
[1:34:51] is no s. This one drunk raised up said
[1:34:53] just a minute.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; There's one
[1:34:56] that I know about. Said who is it? Said
[1:34:59] it's my wife.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; See she become salty. He's catched it
[1:35:04] all the time. He said, "I bet she's up
[1:35:06] to the squeeze." He said, "No, she's
[1:35:10] still a Christian. I'll prove it to
[1:35:11] you." Said, "I tell you what, let's do
[1:35:13] let's go up home." Not sure whether
[1:35:14] she's Christian or not. Said, "Let's go
[1:35:16] up home now. Let's really be drunk.
[1:35:17] We're going to act like we're really
[1:35:19] drunk." Knocked at the door and come in
[1:35:21] staggering over everything and and why
[1:35:24] the chair sitting around this way and
[1:35:26] everything. And she set them all a chair
[1:35:28] and his guest, you know, and tried to
[1:35:30] make him just as welcome as could be.
[1:35:31] Said, "I want you to fix us some
[1:35:34] supper." And so they she went out fixed
[1:35:36] it and said, "We want ham and eggs." He
[1:35:38] know they had it. So they fixed the ham
[1:35:40] and eggs. When he got that table, he
[1:35:42] looked at him like that, picked up his
[1:35:43] plate and slammed the stuff on the
[1:35:45] floor, said, "You know, I don't like my
[1:35:47] eggs like that. Come on, boys. Let's get
[1:35:50] out of here." Anyhow, like that. Like
[1:35:52] that. They went out and sat down like
[1:35:53] that. You know, she come out. She said,
[1:35:55] "Dear, I'm I'm sorry I didn't get them
[1:35:56] fixed. I'll fix them over for Oh,
[1:35:58] nonsense. You know, I didn't want them
[1:35:59] that way in the first place. Just
[1:36:01] carrying on like that. They went out
[1:36:03] there, sat on, act like he was drunk.
[1:36:04] They heard her in there kind of snubbing
[1:36:06] to herself, singing real low voice. Must
[1:36:08] Jesus bear the cross alone. All the
[1:36:11] world will freeise.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; There's a cross for everyone. And
[1:36:14] there's a cross for me. This consecrated
[1:36:16] cross I'll bear till death shall set me
[1:36:19] free.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; One drunk deal said she's a Christian.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; She's got it. That little woman led her
[1:36:25] husband plus these others to Christ that
[1:36:26] night. Think why?
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Gus be real sweet. Just remember he
[1:36:31] knows all about it. So sister or
[1:36:33] brother, whoever it might be or brother
[1:36:34] it is here because he asked about his
[1:36:36] wife, you just be salty. She'll get
[1:36:39] thirsty. If there's anything in her to
[1:36:42] thirst for if it isn't, remember if you
[1:36:44] got the wrong person, you'll get the
[1:36:46] right one in the millennium.
[1:36:49] You just keep on going. All wrongs will
[1:36:50] be made right there. Brother Brandham,
[1:36:53] do you teach that the bride must not
[1:36:55] attend any church unless you are there
[1:36:59] preaching or else the tabernacle? Other
[1:37:02] words, the tabernacle got else means
[1:37:05] other word. Also, do you teach that we
[1:37:08] need not keep the the Sunday or holidays
[1:37:14] as working, fishing or so forth or
[1:37:20] I'd say Sunday it looked like Sunday to
[1:37:22] me like or Sunday I guess it is holidays
[1:37:25] or Sundays? Yeah, Sunday. Is that what
[1:37:27] it look like? Um
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; holy days.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Holy Sunday and
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Sunday and holies.
[1:37:35] No, you're mistaken. See, let me go and
[1:37:39] just answer this and come by. Do you
[1:37:40] teach that the bride must not attend any
[1:37:43] other church unless you are preaching
[1:37:47] uh preaching or else otherwise the
[1:37:50] tabernacle? No, I don't teach that. I
[1:37:52] don't believe that. I do not believe it.
[1:37:55] We've got ministers sitting here that's
[1:37:57] scattered all around through the country
[1:37:59] and I believe they are part of that
[1:38:02] bride. I believe that a man or woman can
[1:38:04] go to church anywhere they want to go
[1:38:06] that teaches the word. Now I believe if
[1:38:08] they don't teach the whole word and you
[1:38:10] can't go to church uh any other place
[1:38:12] where they teach the whole word, go
[1:38:13] where they teach half the word until you
[1:38:15] can get to where they teach the whole
[1:38:16] word. Go to church whatever you do do
[1:38:19] that also. Do you teach that we must we
[1:38:22] must need not keep Sunday or any holy
[1:38:25] day or or working or like working or
[1:38:28] fishing on Sunday? I believe it's a sin
[1:38:32] to fish and hunt and work on Sunday when
[1:38:35] you can go to church.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; I believe you're transgressing the laws
[1:38:39] of God. Is there a commandment to such?
[1:38:41] Yes, sir. Now, in the Old Testament, we
[1:38:43] had a type of the Sabbath day. It was
[1:38:45] Jesus did not come for you keep Sabbath
[1:38:47] days. The old Sabbath day was Saturday,
[1:38:50] which was the end of the week. Sunday is
[1:38:52] the eighth day or the first day of the
[1:38:54] week which Jesus rose on. I do not
[1:38:56] believe it's right to. Now, if you're
[1:38:58] way away into a wilderness somewhere and
[1:39:00] you're out there on a hunting trip,
[1:39:02] there's no church around or anything
[1:39:03] like that and there's nothing you can
[1:39:05] do. If you're fishing, I believe that
[1:39:07] would be all right. But if you're around
[1:39:08] in the city or around where church is
[1:39:10] going on, you should tend church by all
[1:39:12] means somewhere. And I believe as far as
[1:39:15] working, I believe if the ox is in the
[1:39:17] ditch, something has to be done on
[1:39:19] Sunday, you go ahead and do it. If it's
[1:39:21] something that you couldn't help, it had
[1:39:23] to work that way. But if you just do it
[1:39:24] and wait till Sunday to do it or just do
[1:39:26] it like that, you're wrong. See, we must
[1:39:29] not do that. We must respect that holy
[1:39:31] day. And now remember, go to church
[1:39:33] somewhere someplace. If I I could call a
[1:39:37] certain denomination a church, but I
[1:39:38] wouldn't do it because this church only
[1:39:40] thing I know what they teach that I
[1:39:42] believe is they say they believe that
[1:39:44] Jesus Christ is the son of God. Well, I
[1:39:46] do that. All their other teaching is
[1:39:48] they believe in and remission of sins is
[1:39:50] by water. Not is infinite oneness. They
[1:39:52] do the same thing. But I'm talking about
[1:39:54] them. They believe that at regeneration
[1:39:56] by water and so forth. And I don't
[1:39:58] believe that. And uh they oh they
[1:40:00] believe that anything's got divine
[1:40:01] healing in it is of the devil. And they
[1:40:03] believe in all they're the only they're
[1:40:05] the only thing that there is. And only
[1:40:06] thing you have to do is put your name on
[1:40:07] that book. And if you ain't got it
[1:40:08] there, you're lost. Now I don't believe
[1:40:10] that. But if there was no other church
[1:40:12] to go to, I wouldn't go there critical.
[1:40:14] I go there with the intention of my
[1:40:16] presence and me sitting by somebody that
[1:40:18] the Christ that was in my heart might
[1:40:20] influence somebody there. Go among them.
[1:40:22] But don't be partakers of their
[1:40:23] unbelief. Brother Brandham, I want
[1:40:36] amen to the word of God. Thank God for
[1:40:39] the questions and answers. They've
[1:40:41] always been a blessing to me in my
[1:40:43] spiritual walk. And as we prepare to go
[1:40:46] to the table of the Lord,
[1:40:49] um
[1:40:51] let's stand. Turn in our Bibles to 1
[1:40:53] Corinthians 11. Amen.
[1:41:09] Conduct, order, and doctrine has always
[1:41:10] been a blessing to me. Just appreciate
[1:41:13] that tonight.
[1:41:17] God bless each of you. Amen.
[1:41:23] in the scriptures verse number 23 1
[1:41:26] Corinthians 11
[1:41:30] it says for I have received of the Lord
[1:41:32] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:41:35] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:41:37] which he was betrayed he took bread when
[1:41:40] he had given thanks he broke it and said
[1:41:42] take eat this is my body which is broken
[1:41:45] for you this do in remembrance of me
[1:41:48] after the same manner also So he took
[1:41:50] the cup when he had sucked, saying,
[1:41:53] "This cup is the new testament in my
[1:41:55] blood. This do ye as often as you drink
[1:41:58] it in remembrance of me. For as often as
[1:42:01] you eat this bread and drink this cup,
[1:42:03] you do show the Lord's death till he
[1:42:05] come." Wherefore, whosoever shall eat
[1:42:08] this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:42:10] Lord unworthily, so be guilty of the
[1:42:12] body and blood of the Lord. But let a
[1:42:15] man examine himself, so let him eat of
[1:42:17] that bread and drink of that cup. For he
[1:42:20] that eateth and drinkketh unworthily
[1:42:22] eateth and drinkketh damnation to
[1:42:24] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[1:42:28] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:42:30] among you, and many sleep. For if we
[1:42:33] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[1:42:36] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[1:42:38] chasened of the Lord that we should not
[1:42:41] be condemned with the world. Wilfor my
[1:42:44] brethren, when you come together to eat,
[1:42:47] tear one for another. And if any man
[1:42:50] hunger, let him eat at home. But you
[1:42:52] come not together unto condemnation,
[1:42:56] and the rest will I set in order when I
[1:42:58] come. Amen. Let's just sing a portion of
[1:43:01] that song. When he reached down his hand
[1:43:03] for me.
[1:43:05] [Music]
[1:43:06] When he reached
[1:43:10] down
[1:43:13] for me.
[1:43:15] [Music]
[1:43:18] When he reach
[1:43:22] down
[1:43:24] for me.
[1:43:30] I was lost
[1:43:32] in the land
[1:43:36] without
[1:43:38] for
[1:43:41] [Music]
[1:43:51] one for another. Brother Brandham, many
[1:43:55] times on the tape, we pray silent prayer
[1:43:58] as we pray. Terry one for another. You
[1:44:01] pray for me, I'll pray for you. Pray for
[1:44:03] the one in front of you, behind you, or
[1:44:06] next to you. And as we pray one for
[1:44:08] another in silent prayer just for a
[1:44:11] moment.
[1:44:55] Heavenly Father, in my hands I hold the
[1:44:57] bread that was made for this service.
[1:45:00] Lord, the bread, the unleavened bread as
[1:45:04] a type of your word, top of your body
[1:45:07] that was broken for us. Lord, as we
[1:45:10] partake of these parcels tonight, and we
[1:45:13] bless it, Lord, we know that it
[1:45:16] represents your body. It is a type of
[1:45:20] your body. It is not your body, but you
[1:45:24] told us to do it in remembrance of you.
[1:45:27] Now bless each one that partakes of it
[1:45:30] and bless the bread we pray in Jesus
[1:45:32] name. Amen.
[1:45:40] Heavenly Father in my hands I hold the
[1:45:43] cup of the New Testament of your blood.
[1:45:46] Lord as we hold these vessels that
[1:45:50] represents your blood that was shed for
[1:45:52] us. Lord we know that it represents your
[1:45:56] blood. is not your blood. And we thank
[1:45:59] you that we can partake. We know, Lord,
[1:46:02] that there's healing in the cup. There's
[1:46:05] deliverance as we partake.
[1:46:08] It is divine healing to us. And we
[1:46:11] believe that with all our heart as we've
[1:46:13] been taught. And Lord, now we just pray
[1:46:17] that you would bless it and bless bless
[1:46:19] everyone that partake of it. May they
[1:46:21] receive the benefit and the strength as
[1:46:24] they did in the Old Testament when they
[1:46:26] came out of Egypt. They partook, Lord,
[1:46:30] and you kept them strong and healthy.
[1:46:33] Even their clothes didn't wear out. You
[1:46:36] were Jehovah Gyra for them. And here now
[1:46:39] after Calvary, you shed your blood so
[1:46:41] that we can stand here today. We're not

[1:58:38] burnt with fire before the rising of the
[1:58:40] sun. Amen. Let's all take our Bibles and
[1:58:43] turn to St. John chapter 13,
[1:58:52] the foot washing portion of the service
[1:59:01] starting with verse number two.
[1:59:07] Supper being ended, the devil having
[1:59:11] into the heart of Judas's Scariot,
[1:59:12] Simon's son, to betray him. Jesus,
[1:59:16] knowing that the Father had given all
[1:59:17] things into his hands, and that he was
[1:59:19] come from God and went to God. He rised
[1:59:22] from supper, he laid aside his garments,
[1:59:25] and he took a towel and girded himself.
[1:59:28] After that, he poured
[1:59:31] water into a basin and began to wash the
[1:59:34] disciples feet, and to wipe them with
[1:59:37] the towel wherewith he was girded. Then
[1:59:40] cometh he to Simon Peter. And Peter
[1:59:42] saith unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my
[1:59:45] feet? Jesus answered and said unto him,
[1:59:48] What I do, thou knowest not now, but
[1:59:51] thou shalt know hereafter? Peter saith
[1:59:54] unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet.
[1:59:57] Jesus answered him,
[2:00:00] If I wash thee not, thou hast no part
[2:00:02] with me. Simon Peter saith unto him,
[2:00:06] Lord, not my feet only, but also my
[2:00:08] hands and my head. Jesus said to him, he
[2:00:12] that is washed needeth not saved to wash
[2:00:14] his feet, but is clean every wit, and
[2:00:17] you're clean, but not all. For he knew
[2:00:20] who should betray him. Therefore said
[2:00:23] he, Ye are not all clean. So after he
[2:00:27] had washed their feet and had taken his
[2:00:29] garments
[2:00:31] and was set down again, he said unto
[2:00:33] them, "Know ye what I have done to you?
[2:00:36] You call me Master and Lord, and ye say
[2:00:39] well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord
[2:00:42] and Master, have washed your feet, you
[2:00:45] also ought to wash one another's feet.
[2:00:48] For I've given you an example that ye
[2:00:50] should do as I have done to you. Verily,
[2:00:54] verily, I say unto you, the servant is
[2:00:56] not greater than his Lord, neither he
[2:00:59] that is sent greater than he that sent
[2:01:01] him. If you know these things, happy are
[2:01:04] ye if you do them. Amen. Are you happy
[2:01:08] to do them? Amen. It's a privilege to do
[2:01:11] them with the revelation in our heart of
[2:01:15] what we're doing. Amen.
[2:01:18] We thank the Lord that he has given us
[2:01:24] Such a tremendous word in this last day.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that song.
[2:01:31] Um, it shall be light in the evening
[2:01:34] time.
[2:01:41] Oh, go the race

[2:04:14] [Music]
[2:04:15] Will you stay in that back number
[2:04:20] and go on in the manmade way?

[2:04:34] name of God.
[2:04:38] Let the truth now sanctify
[2:04:42] you. It is the way. The apostles
[2:04:47] try his light. There shall be light
[2:04:52] in the evening time
[2:04:56] to glory.

[2:05:25] Oh, the evening light has come. It's a
[2:05:29] wonderful light. The evening light.
[2:05:34] Lord, I thank you for the light. The
[2:05:37] evening light has come.
[2:05:42] It is a fact that God and Christ are
[2:05:47] one.
[2:05:50] Thank God for that revelation tonight.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you want to stay in that back
[2:05:56] number?
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Do you want to go forward with those
[2:06:00] that sigh and cry for the abominations
[2:06:03] done in the city? Lord, help us is my

[2:06:09] go to the room next door. brothers will

[2:06:15] washing. God bless you.
