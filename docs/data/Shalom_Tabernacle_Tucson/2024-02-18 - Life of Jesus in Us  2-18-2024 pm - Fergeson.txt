bless you you can be seated what an honor to be back here with you all again and uh it was just here last November and I I thought about it when first I kind of wanted to come on a little fishing trip I thought maybe I'll come do a little fishing and go fish with brother Israel and with uh have a little time with them and uh uh thought about that and and then Aaliyah called up she said well Grandpa if you can come around this time and I say she's got a a week off so I said yeah maybe I can work it out I I try to get Liz to come with me and she didn't want her to come because last month we were in we went to Mon and we had some fellowship there with the Believers and what a wonderful time we had and the Lord really blessed us and some of the churches came came together and my what a time we had just a wonderful time so she says well I she didn't feel like coming she wanted to stay back home couple little things and I said well Levi might be able to convince her because Levi when he talks you know it kind of pulls on her heart a little bit and he tried and she didn't and so I came alone but I'm happy to come and see them and to see Levi and Kisha and Le I'm so happy to see them and God richly bless them amen and I we had a the ministers meeting yesterday and my brother George was there and some of you how many of you were there at the ministers meeting I know brother Randa was there or just couple of you oh the Lord already blessed us and the brothers really enjoyed it and my quite a lot of positive comments after and thank the Lord for it and this morning I went to Brother kaleb's church and my it was a little different but my what a blessing we really I enjoyed it I really thank the Lord and He told me he said you come back to to son he said even if I have to wrestle with Israel he said with brother Israel he says I'm going to wrestle with him to get you to come back here but the Holy Spirit was there and we really certainly had a wonderful time um I I went to Brother Amando and oh my what a friend he's just such a bosom friend you know sometimes you cross paths with people in this life and it's just different amen and you meet friends you meet people but then it's put a b poor used to say he said they were friends and they were special friends and I really think you know I look at you all like brother George sitting here and many of you sitting here but Amando and all of you your special friends of course when I think about brother Israel and Sharon is more than just you know what it is it's part of the family see so we certainly thank the Lord and I not because he's my son-in-law but I really believe it all my heart I've seen how the Lord has worked in his life through the years and I really believe that you've got a true true Minister I believe that with all my heart amen and sometimes you might do things you might not agree maybe you might think a little bit it should be done a little bit different but you know it's the way that you know you have to do what you know in your heart the Lord leads you and of course we certainly thank the Lord and uh I heard this say that there's some of the Spanish speaking people that would probably need some translation is that all right everything is being arranged it's been arranged okay good because the subject we're going to go into I do believe with all my heart of all the times that I've stood at the poit and pre this has got to be one of the most important subjects I've ever brought to our church and brother brandham called it the highlights of his entire Ministry and if the Lord Jesus will come down here tonight to speak to you and I sitting in the meeting and would tell us that he's bringing us the most important message message of this entire age we will want to spend particular attention to listen to it so tonight what we have before us now I want to warn you of something and it is the truth I thought maybe a part of it I'll be able to share with you today and brother Israel told me well we'll be back here on Wednesday night and then I'll probably get back with it on Wednesday night I was going to brother Mando's church I was kind of tempted but I said Lord what you will is and then you know he put something else in my heart because I kind of hesitated to bring this because of the fact that there's so much material in it so much to be able to delve into it and the parts of that are so important for the church I do believe at this time but um it's just like at the Ministries Mee and I had to purposely put aside from certain areas certain quotes and scriptures and stuff I had I had to purposely pull aside and didn't even mention it because just say something to the brothers and they begin to pull and one brother St on look at shook his head like this and said to me you can't leave us like this you know and they wanted to know and of course you know the pull is there and the needs are there and the love of God is there and we want to know and you know and I certainly I feel it Deon quite a privilege and an honor that you know in different parts of the world and to the congregations I've gone in different places that God has being with me and used me to be a blessing and like I told the brothers I never want to come into a congregation and create confusion and divisions I have never been guilty of dividing nobody's Church in my life I've just tried my best to preach unity and stuff and wherever I've gone to be able to even have a church that I Pastor is in regions where the message was never even heard of and God used my Ministry there and this is not to reproach other brothers of any type but this is how I you know the Lord has led me to sense I fell the court of God in my heart and even going into the overseas churches in Africa and different places where of course you know I met brothers and they love me and have a lot of confidence and today I step into some of these countries and the pastors and stuff will come and it's just been good to see the love and I feel in my heart if God in his love and mercy could use me to be a blessing then that's the greatest thing I can do and I've always told of people even Mark home that you know and it's a strange thing but it's the truth of and I'm not saying this the song humble I'm saying it because of the truth I don't want to take too much time on this because we're going to get to the word and some of them shake their heads and you know in unbelief when I say it but it's the truth and I told him I says you know I've seen ministers that could stand the Propet and they're real preachers I mean they can preach when I sat in meeting brother George and I shook my head and said Lord I don't have the gift like those brothers and the only thing I have is when the anointing comes and that's what makes the difference and that anointing could take me up and I could you know and I see whole thing connect together and I remember I I went to to Rapid City in South Dakota a several years back and uh brother dondon before he went to meet the Lord you know this this a whole story I W have enough time to even get into it to share you I had to go to Rapid City to see him it was important to see him before the Lord took him home and in going into Rapid City one night I remember driving from winipeg with two brothers went with me and I drove 14 hours from Winnipeg to Rapid City got in there about 4:00 in the morning and then I fell on my knees and on my knees while I was praying and this is something that you should think about you who are sitting here Satan came to me and brother George in A Moment Like This he showed me all my faults yeah and my past life and all the mistakes and all the things what I did it wasn't right and I went into it I began to move into that I began to think yes Lord it's true I I did this and I did that and when I did that when I when my mind got on myself and what I did and what I I you know then the anointing of the Holy Spirit left me and it happened a several times in my life a couple of times in my life and I think God wanted to if I would sit like this excuse me in the sweet language you would use God wanted to really teach me a lesson to show me what I was doing was wrong and sometimes God let things happen to show you what you're doing is wrong and I went to Brother when when that anointing left me I went to Brother Dixon's church I said brother duxon I said please I said I don't feel good I says is it possible you could take the service and me not preach he says what he says me take the service he said people have made sacrifices to come all the way to Rapid City he says we've been waiting here for years to have you come he says you got to preach I said Lord if I had I'm not exaggerated when I say this If I Had a Million Dollars in My pocket and I could have give it to him and tell him don't let me preach I would have done it because I got on that P and I took some of the notes some of the best notes I could find and try to preach and that anointing was not with me and I saw a couple maybe two or three couples get up from the PO from the church and walked out and I knew in my heart I couldn't blame them for for leaving because it was not their fault it's just that I was fumbling all over the place I couldn't get the things together the anointing was not with me so I begged the Lord and the next day was a Friday night then brother dson scheduled three services say Lord a four Services r one in the Pentecostal church out there and the Saturday night I says you know what I'm going to spend a whole day in prayer I says maybe the Lord will Hear My Cry and he sent back that anointing I fell on my knees at brother Dixon's place and I was praying and while I was praying the phone rang because brother duxon said well I'll leave I said brother DX I'm not going to know where with here I'm going to stay here and pray said all right he left the house I was praying the phone rang and when the phone rang it was a sister calling brother duxon and she told Brother duxon she said I hear it on the in to come she's left it leaving the message for brother duxon she said brother dixen the reason I'm calling you is because last night she says my husband is very sick he's been sick I don't remember how long she said for how much months or whatever and she says last night I had a dream that brother Ferguson prayed for my husband and the Lord healed him so when I heard that news then I felt even worse so I said Lord please please Hear My Cry I I Promise You Lord I ain't going to do it again I'm going to keep my eyes on my faults I'm going to keep my eyes on your goodness and your love and your mercy Lord now I want to ask you a little question before I get into the message tonight brother talked about the face of Cain because last night yesterday I talked a little about that in the meeting for the ministers reading but there's something else I want to share with you have you ever come to church church and feel really sad and broken I'm going to ask you a little question how many of you in the meeting here could raise your hand and say I come to the church really sad and broken how many have had that experience you're really sad yeah all of you you know what brother bam said of that that sadness that you have in you when you come to church hinders the anointing of the Holy Spirit coming upon you to give you the to open your eyes to the word it hinders it you got to pray and ask God to take that away amen because to enter nothing to sadness sometimes you could be broken because a Christian could be sad because his disappointments and things and at the same time rejoicing KN that the devil steal that Joy don't let that happen to you and when that happened to me I was broken inside and I couldn't see I couldn't see the joys of the Lord and when this say said that I went back that Saturday night to the meeting and the anointing was not there and the meeting was terrible and at the end of the meeting the sister came up some of the people left even and I didn't blame them I did not blame them some sometimes you see people in the ministers blame it is the fault of the people no I had to be honest I knew it was my fault and the Lord was showing me something and then the the the the the sister came up for me to pray for her husband and her husband came up he was sick and the anointing came back and I prayed for the man and he was healed right there and after he was healed the anointing left me and then I learned not to keep my eyes on myself but to keep my eyes on him his goodness his love his Mercy what he is now tonight I could spend a lot of time on that but I'm not going to go in that direction we not going to talk too much about that I have something else I want to share with you and this is the greatest message that brother Bram ever preached now some people might disagree hold on I'm going to bring going to bring you the quotes hold on I'm you think I'm going to stand here and make those statements just coming from me cuz some people will brother Ferguson every message he preached was very important that is true but there were some things he preached that was far more important we'll get to that we'll delve into it tonight and we'll see the importance of it okay now I warn you I will not be able to finish this message tonight in fact I've had a series back home of about three to four services and was never able to completely finish it because of the different parts in here and this what the Holy Spirit has been opening up to me and what he has let me see so now I am I'm going to ask you all to stand at this time and we will bow our heads for a word of prayer together let us pray Lord God Of Heaven thank you Lord we are conscious that your presence is here with us we are nothing Lord and we don't want our eyes to be upon ourselves even our faults and our mistakes we don't want our eyes to be upon the troubles and trials of this life we want our eyes to be totally completely fixed in you and father we can't do it on our own because there's so much to attract us Lord as your Prophet tell us so many voices crying for attention but father help us now that we can lay aside all these things Lord and consecrate upon you and now I call upon you for a special anointing for this church and a special anointing Lord upon me that I'll be able to bring to be a tool in your hands to be able to bring this to your people that it will be a blessing to all of us we pray and we thank you in Jesus name amen now we will go to the scriptures and I will take now I have to do it this way I'll read for you just one or two scriptures and then I'll have you you'll have to afterwards I'll let you sit because many of the scriptures I'm going to be bringing here in the quotes I have to bring it as we go forward in the service a little bit like what I did at the ministers meeting yesterday so I'll just read one or two scriptures for you and and then we will um we will we will go into the word now I want to read from John chapter 12 just one single verse here John chapter 12 and verse 25 John chap 12 and verse 25 he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep keep it unto life eternal and I want to read another scripture found in 1 John chapter 5 so we'll just take two of the scriptures and then we'll set after 1 John chapter 5 from verse 8 and there are three that bear witness in Earth the spirit the water and the blood and these three agree in one if we receive the wickness of man of men the wickness of of God is greater for this is the weakness of God which he had testified of his son he that believeth on the Son of God had the weakness in himself he that believeth not God he that believeth not not God had made him a liar because he believed not the record that God gave of his son and this is the record that God has given us eternal life and this life is in his son he that had the son had life and he that had not the Son of God had not life these things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the son of God that he might know that he have eternal life and he might believe on the name of the son of God lord god of Heaven as we come now under your anointing of your Holy Spirit which we promise which you promis to send upon us we pray father God that you will take everything now from our minds and then the Holy Spirit take the word of God and feed it to all of us we pray in Jesus name amen amen all right God bless you all you can be seated now we're going to go straight into it okay because sometimes you know we drift here and we drift there and we go here no we're going to go straight into it tonight okay and I'll start by reading for you a quote and then we'll go to certain scripture so I'm start by reading you this is a quote from the message desperations and brother bam says here he said this morning the message this morning was to me the highlights message of my entire Ministry this morning see a highlight message of my entire Ministry someday I'll tell you how it come about now if we think about all the message me he preached he preached on so many different types of messages but he's telling us that this year is the highlights of his entire Ministry listen close now someday I'll tell you how it come about and I know that everything has worked for months and months and months up to that one message moving up to come to that place so everything brother gram says everything the different messages different things has worked for months we could see it here and months and months up to that one message moving to come up to that place and then he goes on to say that was the capping off time of it you see so this message cap it off what was that message what was that message that he preached that was the C of what was it come on Church no many people don't know it was the token message could we say that together the token so the token was the highlights of his entire Ministry and things works for months and months and months and months working up to that now why was it the highlights what is the what is it in the token that made the token so so important like I told you all if Jes Jesus Christ would come down here tonight and would tell you all I'm bringing you the Highlight message of this entire age won't we want to pay attention to it then brother brandom goes on and here's what he says he says now I'm sure or hope that you got what the token meant see the token is the sign that the blood has been applied now here's the problem many Christians and many people around the world that hear the token that's all they know they just know that the token is a sign that the blood has been applied but let's go a little further so the token is the sign that the blood has been applied that the price that's being asked required of God Jesus Paid that price by shedding his own blood all of that is the token Jesus Paid the price by shedding his blood all of that is the token let's go further he did that then from his life came the Holy Spirit and when the blood is applied to you the holy spirit is a token that your price is paid God has received you and that's the token so what is the token what is the token that the token is a price that has been paid the token is the Holy Spirit the token is that he says and when the blood is applied to you the holy spirit is a token that your price is being paid God has received you amen amen and that is the token now I want to slow down just a little bit bitty bit bitty bitty bit on this don't want to spend too much time here because this could take us a lot we can go into all of this a lot we could take the whole night and just talk a little bit about God receiving you now there's two phases to it that's very important one is first you receiving God but if you say all right I have received and I believe that God has forgiven me of my sins okay I have received the message I have received the word of God I have received all these things even if you open your heart and you receive all those things it is not enough I'm not hearing a lot of amens well that's all right is it enough that you accept the Lord Jesus Christ that's what the bapti preach all you have to do is accept the Lord Jesus Christ no sir there's more than that amen amen yes sir amen I'll read it for you right he says what more brother Ferguson is there anything more than me you and I accepting what Jesus Christ did for us at Calvary yes there's something more and many people doesn't even know that there's more that's the sad part that's why I tell you we can a lot of time here but I'm going to have to touch this and move away quickly because this is not really really my message what I really want to bring to you but are we just touching it amen so you can touch it and just move away quickly here's what brother randam says here in the message God's provided way he says here and that blood was shed for us and we have got to accept that that's wonderful that they can project that quote for you we've got to accept that and then just by accepting it wouldn't only do God's got to vindicate back that he has accepted you now the token the token is not you accepting God it is God accepting you it's just like if I would if you would pray and I would pray and we would ask God for certain things the most important part of a prayer is not you making a prayer to God the most important part is when God answers your prayer amen when God answer your prayer that's where I talk to God and God speak back to me God give me the answer but what is most important it's not me speaking to God it's God speaking to me that's why oh just you see you see what's happening to me now it's putting me in it's putting me in that direction I got to pull back that's why in the Bible you have two fa of this you've got a priest and you've got a prophet okay now the priest is the people to God you've come to God you've got your sacrifice you've got your needs a priest is an intercessor you to God me taking my intercession to God me giving my offerings to God that's a priest amen but a prophet is God speaking to the people amen you see it it's two phases in the in the word of God a priest and a prophet a priest the people to God we're interceding a priest is an inter intercessor we're interceding to god father father we a priests too we a priests so we go before God lord I need this but then a prophet you see the prophetic the prophet is God speaking to the people amen and the Lord says thus say the Lord the Lord says the Lord says the Lord says oh what a blessing now to move away from this quickly so and then just by accepting it wouldn't do God's got to vindicate back that he's accepted you that's the thing you can accept him but then if he accepts you stay right there until he does accept you amen amen and when he accepts you what does he do and then when he does he sees you into his kingdom by the baptism of the Holy Holy Spirit then you have you secure until the day of redemption that's right now what brother brandom goes on to say is this here okay he goes on to say this now he's talking about the token he says now we have sometimes allowed it the Baptist allowed it to accept it in the word accepting Christ as personal savior that's exactly what we say that's what the Baptist said and in this message we still have some of that Baptist Doctrine cing around people said as long as you accept the message you have the Holy Ghost that is not true amen come on church that's Baptist Doctrine the lutherans allowed it to accept in the word accepting Christ as personal savior the Methodist says when you get happy enough to shout that's it the Pentecostal said speak in tongues then you got it we find out that all of it was wrong amen don't you stop for that church we go on the token is the token it's you and Christ as person STI out to see it is the holy spirit his his life in you working his own life through you and it's for the rich the poor or for whosoever will receive it Hallelujah brother bam continues then the life that was in Christ is the Holy Ghost amen amen not the third person but the same person in the form of the holy of the Holy Spirit coming upon you as a token that your life and your fire is paid you have been accepted thank you Lord MH now when God accepts you and tonight we may not be able to get into that that part of it I'm going to hold that back probably for Wednesday when God accepts you he gives you a confirmation that he has accepted you amen but now we we we wouldn't we may not have enough time to go into that tonight and probably on Wednesday night we'll be able to talk about that confirmation that God gave that he has accepted you but now let's move a little bit further further into our message uh brother mam continues here he says until that token comes you're not permitted on the highway you're not permitted on the bus line you're not permitted to go in until you can present this token and that token is your fair and now it shows that the blood that has been shed and being applied to you the price is being applied to you and you have the token that the blood is applied to you and you are accepted my yes sir before that you're not allowed forget the Rapture forgot all of it you're not allowed but now you've been accepted now what is the token the token is a price paid yes let's say it together the token is a price paid that's being paid the token is the Holy Ghost the token represents that God has accepted you the token is the life of God now let's think about this to see why it's so important and I'm going to shift a little bit now to go now to a scripture and so we will go to the Psalms because brother bam used the psalm for this and the psalm he used was Psalm 63 and brother said this Psalm puzzled him he couldn't understand what David was speaking about so we go to Psalm 63 yes okay now I'll I try to to take my time tonight and move into it in steps so that you can get it yes sir and trust the Lord that you wouldn't miss any of it it because it's the most important subject we could talk about all right now in Psalm in the Psalm 63 from verse one we go back here in the Psalms in the Psalms okay are you with me and sometimes I might pronounce things a little different to you and stuff you know I remember even Sharon corrected me when she was a little girl on my pronunciation which was fine and marata love to perct me but Daddy this is not the way she she does it yet sometimes and she just loveed to correct and sometimes um uh Gracie corrects me and sometimes even even my little little daughter the Naomi corrects me sometimes but no Daddy it's not this way that's the way it's supposed to people WR all right praise the Lord so so even if you want to correct me on my pronunciation that's fine Brother Billy Paul used to do it all the time and I was with him and Brother Joseph and brother David and all of them they correct me all the time see and I don't know maybe it's just me amen all right now let's get here into Psalms 63 now David here in the psalm is saying oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy Glory so I as I have seen thee in the uary because thy love and kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands in thy name now um I want to stop here to get to what brother brandham said about this to show you why that token is so important because it represents the Life of Christ now brother Brandon here and ah excuse me here yeah brother brand here talking in the message thirsting for Life here's what he said about that he reads the psalm because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee and here's what he says he says when I first read that I thought it was an unusual text to take and God is unusual and God does things unusual unusual things and when I read it I wondered what David must have been speaking about when he said thy love and kindness is better than me than life I waited that out wondering just what could be better than life if we should take a trip tonight and go up into the heaven and I'll meet with Abraham with father Abraham and I'll say Abraham what is the most glorious thing that you have ever known what is the most essential thing that you that you have ever known Abraham will say to me life eternal then I'll take a little trip and we'll go again we'll go to the great a Archangel Gabriel who is the messenger of the Covenant to the Jewish people who stands at the right hand of God one of the highest order of Angels in the heaven and I will say to him Gabriel thou are a mighty angel you are loved of God and you've been here for aons of time and you perhaps know everything in the heavens and where everything is placed because you are one of God's right hand angels and you know the great secrets of the heavens you sounded the trumpet at the at at the coming of the Lord Jesus you announce his first coming and you shall announce the second coming amen I wish we had time to go into that this BS me for years is and it was just a couple of weeks ago brother George that I found the answers in the message hidden hidden in the message and I couldn't preach on this Gabriel here and what what Ro does Gabriel play in the second coming of the lord we better not go into that don't pull on me on that the church back home was pulling and now I I promis myself when I go back I'm going to share with them for the first time in my life because I found some stuff that I I didn't even know it existed and I found it and I got the quotes I have it and I don't have to add anything it's exactly what it said and I could go forward now amen wonderful isn't he you see here is the key when we wait upon the Lord and I waited for years and couldn't understand I wouldn't preach on it because I didn't understand it brother man what role does Gabriel play how are the announce the second coming of the Lord how is this this Mighty Angel anyway let's not go into that please don't even pull on me I'm I didn't even bring my notes with me on that and I'm trying to preach on it at all because I've never preached on it I just shared some of it with the meeting I had with some of the sisters the whole group of sisters we had a meeting and they asked me and I shared a little bit with them on the quotes on that so now let's get away from that quickly why' you even say anything huh why' you even say anything about it well I have to sometime you know I have to say sometime because it's it stirs a little bit of thirsting him a little bit but it it it'll pull us off of our subject I know but I gotta that's what the Fe On The Church says brother Christian what are you doing to us but that stirs you a little bit amen but maybe another time if the Lord willing I get back here I like to share those course with you and share some stuff maybe we see what happened because Wednesday we won't probably go here we'll see what happen you pray and we'll see what the Lord does because don't forget he answers prayer see all right now brother Bram goes on okay he says Gabriel thou a mighty angel Angel you love the God okay he goes on here he says and you know the great you announc the first coming and you shall announce his second coming so you must be a mighty man or a mighty Angel my I want to ask you in all I smiling when I'm reading this it's pulling me I know you're pulling here but please let's not go into this part I don't have my quotes I have not with my quotes with me so I don't want to go in into it because it takes us into another Direction it will take me all night it take me you understand I can't I can't I can't put it together so don't let's just don't pull don't pull all right I can see I can see it on brother George's face I can see it on brother Amanda's face I can see it on many of few faces but that's all right now brother B goes on he says You must be a mighty man or a mighty angel I want to ask you in all of God's Treasures what is the greatest thing that you have found among his treasures I could see get abrel bring himself to attention and say the greatest thing that I have found in God's Treasures since he created me is life God made me to live for Eternal for eternity and life is the greatest thing there is all right brother B goes on now there's nothing seemingly any better than life okay what could we estimate this morning would be better than life but David said thy love and kindness is better than life now he Wonder then the word life must have a compound meaning it must mean more than one thing life itself means an existence so then if thy loveing kindness is better than life then what could be any better because God alone has eternal life God alone has eternal life if we could get that straightened out it would be easy for us to see the great picture of God sets before us that someday everything that isn't of God will perish and go away all right brother brandom goes on I have a question for you now it's not a trap it's brother George believes it's a trap please trust me it is not a trap okay sometimes it's TR there trap questions Sharon but this is not a sh a trap a trap question Ayah listen to it when did you receive eternal life did you always com it if your name is written in the book of life eternal yes but did you always have it found yes but did you always have it huh silence and a death in silent now I don't blame you to be silent if I was in your position I would be silent too now didn't we have a predestinated seed in our hearts amen well when did we have life I'll share with you tonight when we got life and I'll be honest with you I haven't even gotten into the main part of the message yet we still building the platform but let me deal with this with this because people don't know when they imagine people get life and they don't know when they got the life so excuse me I don't blame the people because even me me me myself didn't know because God does things you see see it's the way that God operates and brother Bram speak it in the message things that are to be you see God does a certain thing and then later on he shares with you what he did okay it's done with it then he show you after what he did just like Jesus went to the Cross he died he resurrected from the dead and after his resurrection his crucifixion then he explained to the disciples what happened they didn't what it was happening they didn't know he explained to them after now if I could know why is happening it's a huge privilege amen that's right but times he doesn't let you know what is happening it's afterwards he let you know what happened just like Jonah back they didn't know she was a spiritual woman until afterwards then they found out and true men of God are not recognized for what they are during their lifetime they only recognized after they have passed away then people realize hey that was a real man of God but while he's alive to criticize him and condemn him and he's wrong and he's this and he's that and then after God takes him off the scene then they realize who was among them yes sir amen that's why if we pray and ask God and God can open our eyes amen you know if you think if Sarah knew what kind of husband she had in Abraham you think she would fuss and argue with him she fuss and and argu with him she was so angry when the angel when the angel came she missed the whole visitation because she was not happy with Abraham yes right and she knew Abraham was you want to ask first with him imagine if Sephora knew what Moses was you think she would arguing first with Moses a husband like Moses if you have a Moses are you going to first and argue with him well you could have a Moses and you don't recognize it [Laughter] amen just like a man could have a Mary and he don't recognize he has a Mary and he fiz you with Mary you want to fiz you with Mary if you knew she was Mary come on now see we don't want to go into that see we try to you know these things pull me in itself and we want to try to move away from all of that to pull back to what we got here you all understand church I feel good now all right now let's go into it when did you receive life it's important know since there's nothing nothing more important in life in God's economy there's nothing more important than eternal life and if you would live live your whole life and Miss eternal life you have lost everything but if you lose everything and you gain eternal life you have gained everything wonderful now we continue hey I didn't look at the watch when I started I remember some of them used to tell me not to watch my watch when I went there I think it's when I went to jasp or something they said don't watch your watch and they wanted to take my watch away from me but all right let's continue here okay no no no no this is nice are you ready it's in the message why cry speak just the title is so powerful we try to pull away from all of that butam says here he says here he's talking about about Moses he says then see that he was born with this great gifts and quality within him that it only taken something to flash across that to bring that thing to life I want you all to listen closely because we're building into something here tonight that's kind of important that I've never I don't think I've ever shared it with you here at the church in my life all right so that's something it he said now then see he was born with this great gifts and quality within him then it only takes something to flash across that to bring that thing to life see the seed of God is actually placed in us from the foundation of the world amen right now could you say Amen to that what a poor amen the seed of God is placing you before the foundation of the world you say youj you saying an amen as if you got a frog in your in your tro now come on you can say Amen brother do you recognize that the seed of God is placing you before the foundation of the world no don't stop there don't stop there amen continue excuse me for that expression maybe I should not have said it all right brother man goes on see the seed of God is actually placing us from the foundation of the world and when that light first strikes that seed it brings it to life amenallah so the seed is there but when the light strikes the seed Hallelujah then the seed comes to life but the light first has to come upon the seed what is the light the light is the word of God made manifest when this word of God this Living Word of God made manifest strikes that seed that is in your heart then it brings it to life amen now let's go a little further let's go a little further brother goes on I'm going to read for you the rest of it quick like I've thought many times of the little woman at the well her in that condition though she be an illame person though her life was degraded and she was in that condition because the Traditions had never touched her but though when that light first struck her quickly she recognized it because there was something there to respond to it when the Deep C it to the Deep there must be a deep somewhere to respond that call so brother LTI the seed is in US brother LTI is that right he didn't hear me amen he didn't hear me all right when is the seed now let's go a little fur I got another quote for you that will bring it out clear okay we been blessed aren't we yeah this is nice are you ready now the message to whom to whom would we go they say life begins at 40 okay you hear some of them in the message say life begins at 21 and some people say life begins at 60 have you ever heard people saying that brother him said that's a lie yeah you people say oh I started to live when I turned 30 have you ever heard people making statements like that even in the message all right it's a I'm going to read it for you you see is not brother F yes sir amen hallelujah that's a li amen life begins at the altar amen amen that's where life begins eternal life when you come to that Jesus Christ every promise is yours it's all yours it's to you so when you come and you give your life to the Lord Jesus Christ yeah and he accepts you yes Life Begins right there now here is eternal life eternal life eternal life never did begin never did end but there came a time when eternal life came in US amen amen you see we didn't have that eternal life before we had the seeds we were predestinated to that life amen the seed was in us but the light had to to strike it in order for that seed to come to life and then we have life now here is something I want to share with you as we deal with life now because this is what we want to get into life now B Bram tells us this okay and now we're going to get into something here that will interest all of us brother brandom tells us this are you ready now we're getting into our subject now brother brandham said this we're going to go back now in the greatest gift in the Bible he says and I couldn't understand what David was talking about when I first read that I thought what was the prophet meaning that your love and kindness is better than life what could be better than life nothing so I drew this conception that there must be there must be two different kinds of life life has a comp meaning it means more than one thing so there's two different kinds of life right there is your life and God's life am two different kinds of life amen these lives are two different kinds of life now you say now I'm going to go a little further before I get deeper into the life there's something else I want to share with you quickly now I want to ask you a little question are you ready to go into this now Hallelujah is everybody ready to go in now all right now what is in you a lot of people don't even know what is in what is in them yes what is in you let's go a little further if we have the time tonight the Lord would help us maybe if we can get into this part okay at least brother Brandon tells us here not only do you have two kinds of Life which we prove to you in a little bit that there's two kinds of life in you two different kinds of life in you now everybody does not have two kinds of Life Hallelujah oh my yes right it's why you different to the rest of the people now I'm going to go a little deep into it before we go into this deep into it I want to share this with you what brother brandham says here now I I have more quotes on this to life if you want I got more than one but brother bham says and if there's a a little question in your mind um there's another one here besides this in the message I love and kindness we read one for you and then there's another one here in the in in in yeah all right anyway we read the quote and we we won't go back on the other ones we probably go forward okay is that all right I think it's enough so everybody could see there two kinds of life but now there's another point I want to bring to you this is nice um not only do you have two kinds of Life which we'll prove to you in a little bit the two kind of life you have he says here maybe I'll I'll move I'll move away from this one here and come back to it just a little bit Lord help me where is that uh yeah here it is are you ready now am amen you ready yes all right let the Holy Ghost stick us into this now amen so we could see really what's happening now this is wonderful okay two kinds of life now we get to that just now because life there's nothing more important than life now brother brandham says this in question and answers this is a dying spirit in a dying body but now you can't be in two bodies at one time okay now when I was in Africa and those places they believe that the wish doctor could come in you that's not scriptural amen you cannot be in two bodies at the same time it's not possible no amen amen but there could be two Natures in you at one time now the nature of the spirit of God when you're born again you're not born a physical like the baby was but what happened the spiritual Birth has come to you so brother Bram said there can be two Natures in you you at the same time now everybody doesn't have two Natures but we as Christians we do have two Natures now let's go a little further because this is very important for you to see it and it's what makes us different from the W of the people with two Natures in US scientists call it they call it in a negative way they call it people that are bipolar because they seem to have two different Natures in them but a real Christian that's what makes us it makes us what we call strange to the people of the world and they think that we are bizarre because we do have two Natures in us and these two Natures literally is an opposition one to the other which we would if we have enough time tonight we can go into that because that's why I'm saving the rest with God showing us how we have life for Wednesday night and tonight we could probably look a little bit into those two natures and those two lives that is within us and how these things operate according to the message and the word word of God and then on Wednesday we would look at how God proves to us that we have eternal life now let's go little further on these two natures and these two lives now brother bam continues in the message communion and this is one of the last this is the last message he preached before the Lord took him home and here's what he says are you following me are you able to see it it's so simple you have how many nations do you have not everybody have it but you do not everybody have two lies we'll prove it to you in a little bit hold on I got more quotes we prove it to you okay communion brother Adam says like in the book here and the spot there we was talking about the two books being one The Book of Life The First Book of Life coming up was when you were born that was your natural birth see and then one time way down in there there was a little grain of life as I explained it to some of you young sisters at the house this afternoon see there's a little grain of Life laying there that yonder where did it come from what what these strange things I was saying this talking for myself like you were going to say William brandham well 40 years ago the William brandham it isn't the same one tonight if somebody back there would say William Brandon he was a rank rascal you see because I was born of Charles and Ella brandham in their nature I was a sinner I came to the world a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there too was another nature present you see predestinated was under there by God in this same body see two Natures in there amen that's amen yes so many Christians don't even know they have two Natures let's go to the two lives and the two natures and we can maybe go a little deep into it tonight and share it with you and you can see what God does okay okay amen are you following amen is it simple amen it's not complicated simple Hallelujah to me it's so simple all right let's go a little deep into it are you ready now boy is such a poor amen some people boy tonight the church is quiet on me are you ready for us to go deeper how many is ready let me see your hand amen now some people didn't lift your hand what about you are here are you ready all right this will explain a lot of stuff if we had enough time but let's go on no this is not a bunch of quotes I got to be careful you know I have set the quotes this one here all right this is nice ah are you [Music] ready where is that 5 to six yeah I'm sorry now I got it please church this is so nice all right everybody know you have life amen but now we want to look at the two lives you have amen but they said a cat have nine lives we're not talking in the sense of that that somebody had almost died and came back and they said he have more than one no no no no not in that sense right now brother says here he's talking about the little spring here in Kentucky and go tell my disciples he said if this if the spring could come back spoke back he would say no bil it isn't because that you drink from it it isn't because anybody drinks from me it's something down beneath me here here pushing me and making me bubble and jump and carrying on like thish now are you ready now that's the way if they can find this quote every man or woman that's born of the spirit of God it is not you it is not human emotion it is because that the resurrection hallelujah or the power of God is in that human life yeah and it's pressing up into everlasting life moving up into eternal life something in there you could not hold your peace if you had to there is something within you amen so it is the power of the Resurrection something that is in what it is in the human life now let me slow on to say this brother said that there is a blood there is a soul and there is a life within that Soul so you got life you got what is called human life and in that human life God puts his life in that human life let me let me let me let me go further so I can read it for you this is so nice are you being blessed are you getting it now brother bam says now the holy spirit is here on Earth looking out those individuals that God has ordained to life in this age so you are ordained or predestinated to life and there has to a time when life comes in because you were predestinated to that and then there come a time when you receive eternal life now brother bam goes on let me read it for you he says here and as soon as it finds it it does just it does just like just like it did on Jesus Christ the great super Son of God who redeem us all it comes down and takes its place of aboard into the human life amen amen now notice brought the quickening power so the Holy Ghost comes down and it takes it to B in your life because you have two kinds of life amen let me ask you a question do you see it if you see it could you raise your hand yes amen and give God praise now let me ask a little question is there someone here that didn't see it look like everybody saw it Hallelujah that's wonderful amen all right now if everybody see it we can make another step and go a little forward amen two Natures yes in the same body two form of life in the same body now if you have two Natures in you let's look at these two Natures just a little bit tonight before we finish up and then we're going to try to finish up on that okay am I taking too much time all right now let's look at this brother brandham dealt with this in the message Blasphemous names all right and in the message Blasphemous names he shows us that there's two kinds of Fate actually a lot of people say which I agree with them and sometimes people doesn't understand they say me I don't want no intellectual fate here people say oh I don't want no intellectual fate part of the reason is the it's a misunderstanding of what intellectual faith is brother Bram says here in the message let me read it for you I'm going to read it for you so you will see and be oh Lord help me I'm feeling a little bit bad but pray for me that the Lord would just help me all right brother Brandon mentions here and here's what he says in Blasphemous names he says now here now get this lesson here what's what's with wrong with the I turn I turn on for this here is what is wrong with the brandham Tabernacle this is a strange statement brother bam is making here's what is wrong with the BAM Tabernacle you see there's two different kinds of Faith amen there's two different kinds of virtue you as I had it the other day two different kinds of knowledge two different kinds of temperance one think is pro prohibition they got that ain't the kind of temperance that God is talking about yeah but ROM goes on to explain it so in the natural let's put it like this in the natural your natural nature you have what the prophet calls and what the word of God calls human love which is fill your love but in the new God doesn't take that out of you you young sisters here you young Brothers here if one you grw up you want to get married you need that F human love to be able to love your husband or love your wife right amen amen who you going to get married if you don't have if it's just a gapo there nothing like that but I could say I love Liz my wife more than any other woman that's not a gapo love that's FAL love that's human love I can see let say someone come to me and said brother Ferguson I have this this this need and then what are my daughters Sharon or Mar one come well Daddy I have this this this need and then I said all right I'm going to take care of my children first inapo love there's no such a thing it's the love of God there's no preference but in the fal love in the fal love I have a FAL love and that FAL love for my family means that my daughter and my wife before everybody else but that's the feel you have and that's why brother brandham could stand before the con congregation look at the people sitting there and says I have a human love for you you got it if you didn't have that human love then you couldn't s my wife a special to me then every woman will have to be the same you see it but when every woman is the same that's way up there in the agap whole love there's no preference there's nothing like that everybody is the same I love my wife I love my sister I love you all of you the same but in the video love it's different so you have to have that for your wife for your husband otherwise are you going to get married how you going to say I love this man more than the other here's the brother that I love I love him more than I love anybody else that's video love now we I don't have time to go into all the quotes you understand I'm just trying to skip and move quickly you see like you young sisters you all understand what I'm saying you can afford to say I love this guy and I don't love this guy what are you talking in the P you got power of there's no such a thing as I love him and I don't love him but in the pho yes in the f I love him and I don't love him okay you all understand see like Shan could tell me her daddy when she met Israel she said I love Israel here's another brother she said I don't love him yes I can't say Sharon you're wrong you all understand what I'm saying because she's talking about human love and that human love is there even when AAP love is there that's why brother Bram says the two loves are operating here am two different Natures in the same body and it makes us strange we act strange we speak strange you you young folks you go to school and your friends at school don't understand you they think you're a little bit funny you're different she's different she's a little bit funny and it's normal for them to think like that because you are different from them you have two natures and they only have one amen they only have a natural nature but there's two parts and these two Natures are in Conflict many times with one another brother says that video of I got all of in Conflict amen but you have to have it I don't know know how you going to marry what are you going to do with your wife do you tell your wife listen honey I love everyone every woman like the way I love you there's no different and she look at you and says what she's talking in the fill you you all understand now I have several quotes on it but I'm trying to move away now you take for instance the Fate I've seen ministers get up at the platform and tell the congregation we don't want no intellectual F Among Us and I sit in the meetings and listen to that brother preach and I know he doesn't know what he's talking about if the people will only go back to the word of God right if the before they make all these statements they will check the Bible and the message it's going to be a different thing do you know what brother bam calls intellectual Faith the Bible does not use the word intellectual Faith you don't find that nowhere in the Bible but brother brandham calls intellectual faith hope but hope has its place amen because the Bible says a people without hope perishes right amen yes and that's why the prophet of God says intellectual Faith brings you to a to a true Faith you have to have hope Amen in enticing Spirit that's what he says he says intellectual faith is Hope see now we won't have time to go into hope and all of that and explain and talk about all of that one but that's what it is see but when you pray you need Faith amen and says 900 out of 99 people that come have hope instead of Faith yes he said we want to change that around we want to get more faith amen we need Faith but tell you you honest truth when God put faith in me and I'm converted he doesn't take All My Hope out he doesn't take that intellectual Faith which is hope completely out of me I need it and I if I had time tonight I'll share it with you where it's is everything has to be placed in its order in his place now I know the songs contradict some people I know it but go check the message for yourself you'll see amen amen that's why he said in every church we need those three things hope and charity you see because the faith is a revelation and if I don't have a revelation I have hope for the people I hope they're saved I can't say in my myself I have a revelation that they're going to be saved but I'm hoping they will so we need that Hope Oh Brother when everything fits in its place and God puts everything in its place amen but how do we do it we have to go back to the word of God and check it amen you see because the Bible says prove all things and we go back and see how the word of God how all these things fits in in their places in the word of God you all understand you see what I'm trying to say you see so there is now if you look at yourself you could see these things in you it's part of the two Natures in you so you can look at yourself and see that in you the same Tabernacle is that agapo love and that filo love in you in the same Tabernacle is that intellectual faith and perfect Faith now some people say but for I don't have no intellectual faith uhhuh I want to ask you a question do you have any hope I like to see the one who put up his hand tonight and say he has no hope amen are you tired are you getting tired Hallelujah see you you see we got to be we we we're coming to the point where the Holy Ghost is showing us what he's doing for us and what is in us and this is where we are now everything has its place that's why in the message works is Faith Express brother Ram says it's like this he said just keep believing until God reveals it to you well you could keep believe in it with what until God reveal it to you what are you going to believe it with your intellectual faith and what is your intellectual Faith Hope because faith is the evidence of things hope forl you hope for it and you hope brother says you're hoping for it and you hope brings you to your faith I have those quotes with me back there I didn't bring them to the platform tonight your hope brings you to the faith so when you hear preachers get up at the because they don't look at the message excuse me if I say this and they don't look to see what brother Bram said about these things and therefore the people are confused and don't understand the place of these things you see a church if you see it you're privilege God open your eyes Hallelujah you can see it amen all right two different kinds of temperance two different kinds of virtue two different kinds of love in the nature one is human love the other one is divine love one is human life the other one is eternal life the eternal life in the human life so here we are tonight we have human life m and we have eternal eternal life right we have Divine love and we have human love which is called FAL love we have Divine Faith which the prophet calls Revelation and we have human Faith which the prophet calls intellectual Faith which the prophet call [Music] Hope what people we are but these two Natures fights each other brother P said they're very contradictory to one another therefore The Human Side will have an End Amen you said well brother Ferguson when we received the the new birth didn't we die yes you died to sin and everything that is contrary to the word of God Amen but in in New Birth God didn't take out from you the love you have for your wife no come on [Music] church he didn't take from you that F love but said the is the love you have for your wife if he will take the F of complete go to you she will be like any other woman and if he will take that hope that intellectual part if he takes all of that completely out of you you cannot have hope for the people you won't be able to look at a sinner and all the people and have hope for him because you need hope you have no Revelation I have no Revelation that he will be saved therefore I have a hope that God will save him we have hope for the people that's what brother Bram tell [Music] us two different Natures amen and then what does God do when he comes in okay I'll try to finish here okay is that all right because this is a lot for you in one nightl you got two Natures hallelujah thank you Lord and both of them is what amen I contradict because that human love is a problem makes you Des things sometimes that God doesn't have for you pull you here and pull you there things that God therefore it has to come that's why brother bam said the agap love he uses an expression like this he says when the agap love comes in it overrides the fil love amen overrides it see the fil love is there the cap love comes in it overrides it Hallelujah the human life is there the life of God comes in what does the life of God do it takes the pr in you it takes control of the human life amen the human life is not the eternal life the eternal life is not human life but when the eternal life comes in it takes preeminence it takes control of that human life it brings the human life under subjection that's what the prophet of God taught us subjection to him that he would be able to have the final word and that human life pulls you this way and pulls you that way pulls you this way sometimes because the prophet of God said is very contradictory one or another very very contradictory but we want to bring it under subjection therefore we pray and said Lord God Of Heaven have your way in me why are we saying have your way why are we saying have your way Lord why are we saying Lord I yield to you what do we yield we yield our life we we yield what we are to him if that life was not there we have nothing to yield no come on Church you can't eat something you don't haveen Lord I yeld to you well where is he he is in me when he is in me I'm yielding to him but I'm yielding what yes amen I'm yielding my nature yes I'm heing my life all my life I gave to you well could you give God human life yes would God accept human life yes when he accept your life when you give your whole life to him you hear people say I have given my life to Jesus Christ and the poor people don't even know what they're saying yes you give your life to him it doesn't mean he take your life away you die to everything contrary to the word he take your life and he destroys everything contrary to the word and brings that life contrary to him and you say Lord I give my all to you I give my life to you and then his life comes down in that life two lives two life in the same body two kinds of [Music] life amen you see it amen yes amen you see why I try to pull away from the other stuff to get there yes Hallelujah all right now we'll try to finish wonderful but Brana mentions this is we're going to finish here here know he says this here are you ready amen are you seeing it now those two Natures brother bring them under subjection to the will of almighty God amen amen amen bring them under subjection amen Give It All to Jesus amen sir hand those things over to Jesus he didn't take them out of you what he wants you to do is to bring them under subjection to him I gave my life to he didn't take your life out but bring it under subjection to him bring those things under subjection to him that he will will have the preeminence in your life that he will be able to have the total control in your life what does he do he controls your F your love amen so that F your love will not be projected to anything contrary to him because when love is projected that's why people fall in love with things that is not of God because the love of God is not in them because when that love of God is in you it controls to override that F your love amen you see it yes so that F project to whatever contr to God okay and then he controls that hope that intellectual Faith amen that you will not follow this message just by hope which we won't have time to go into tonight and I purposely didn't bring the course with me because I'm thinking of going into that haveit back there I can see where George smiling there but you see we touch slightly on it maybe on Wednesday night we'll see how much we can go okay before I leave if the Lord willing all right let me share this with you this is taken from the message Souls that are in prison now and brother Brandon dealing on that here's what he says he says now the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul see and the soul is something that's the nature of the spirit now watch here the nature of the spirit and then when the nature of a man when he said we are dead the scripture plainly tells us we are dead and our lives are HID in God through Christ sealed in there by the Holy Spirit now it wasn't your body died it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit that died now when brother brandham says this Lord help us Lord help us now when brother brandham tell us that the nature of your spirit is died and when people say I am dead and my life is hidden in Christ with God we need to see what that means amen what it means to die what does it represent to us amen don't forget it church amen H now let's go on I want to finish here right because this is a lot a lot for you to pray about and think about tonight Amen brother goes on here so he said it wasn't that your body died it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit di see the nature which is the soul the nature of your soul is God if you born again if it's not it's of the world anything that begins has to end and so therefore the only way that you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin and then your life did begin when you were born when God breathed the breath of life into your nostrils and you become a living Soul then your life begin then brother brandham goes on are you ready now yes everybody all right but that soul in there see that soul is what God is working on now if you want to watch and see that nature when bam said you're dead and we're going to see what it means now okay so we could we could we could lean out to what he says all right here's what he says but that Soul that's in there see that soul is what God is working on see if he can only get that nature that Spirit to agree with him then that nature dies amen the nature and the love of the world dies and the thing of The World Is Dead Sea because if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God is nothing you see so a man must be born again so this Nature has to die and the nature of God comes in there and God is the only thing that that there is that never did begin or never did end so what brother brandham is saying is this he gets that soul that nature to agree with him now when the nature within you agrees with God God call that death yes sir that's right you want me to read it again for you yes but that Soul that's in there see that soul is what God is working on am might he's working on the soul now if the soul is not there how can you work on it he's working on the soul see but contines see if he can only get that nature all right that Spirit to agree with him hallah then that nature dies the nature dies when it agrees with God very good therefore here we cannot disagree with the message we cannot disagree with the word of God Amen because our nature agrees with God and when it agrees with God the prophet of God says there is we nature dies God is working on that nature what is he doing he's trying to get that nature to agree with him you want to do this you want to do that and the Holy Ghost says no this is what I want this is what I want this is what I want this is what I want and you are yielding your nature healing yourself to [Applause] him and as you heal the part of the nature that's contrary to him takes it out this is contrary it goes that's contrary it goes this is contrary it goes this is contrary it goes and then the whole nature within you agrees with God and God calls that death boy then the nature agrees and it dies amen sir and you you're walking with Jesus now yes you don't have to worry about these things they're dead anything contrary to God is dead you're walking in harmony with God you agree with God let me let me say this to you let me explain this let me say this to you what if I would say I am dead is that what god require of me just to die a lot of people say all God requires of you is to die they don't know what it mean what it means the man in the world he dies the drunk and The Prostitute they die is that the death the Bible is speaking about it's when that nature agrees with God God pulls you into an agreement with him that you and God become one if you see it raise your hand and give God praise that's why he's working on that nature yes working on you I love this he works on that thing brother he works on that thing sister amen and then all of a sudden you find yourself lining up you says I love to go to church before I didn't love to go to church I love to hear the tapes before you didn't care to hear it I love to read my Bible I love to pray yes amen I love the Lord and then I love my wife more than ever love her before what kind of love is it you feel your love but now the feel your love moving with you got up it's in agreement with God it's not contrary to God hallelujah come on church I love my husband that's my husband I love him with all my heart you feel your love gross that video is not a but you have to have it come on [Applause] church amen it's in human nature it's in human life brother botom said that's what make you a human being is these characteristics in you amen he says you identified in this life by your family and you don't understand that you see everybody understands that I want try to finish now amen you see so in the new bird he doesn't take it out of you he brings it under agreement with his word and he calls that death oh brother can you if you see it tonight give him praise Hallelujah am twoes two NES yes in you have you ever thought of that two just like Jesus brother B said he was dual had the nature of man he had the nature of God as a man he can cry as a man he can hunger that's the nature of man that's a man he could get tired that's the nature that's not God that's God could Tire as a man he had to sleep God does does God sleep we sing the little song God does not sleep but he was in the back of the boat sleeping as a man as a man he could cry as a man he could feel pain as a man he could die Hallelujah you and I we do not deny our Humanity amen amen what we do is we bring our Humanity in subjection Amen to God what is man that thou art mindful of him I am a man you a woman we a part of humanity God made us what we are and allowed us to have the life we have but that human life has to come under subjection amen amen that he become the all in all takes control of you and you and you and you takes control of you yes right all right she knows that that's so sweet takes control of you and you and you and you and what do you say Lord I give my all what do you mean when you say you give your [Music] all yes what do you mean by that amen you given your nature you giv your life amen and in that life there's a nature am I'm trying to finish I'm repeating it so you can see it in that life there's a nature there's a soul and you give it to him and we sing that chorus give it all Give It All to Jesus hope my human love all that I have all that I have I give to you everything I possess everything that is mine amen I give to you yes some people don't think they can give all they have now there's one thing that you need that you cannot do certain things you cannot do you cannot be saved by intellectual faith and brother bam says You must never make God the object of human love you cannot love God like you love your husband or you love your wife the prophet of God says that I have the quotes and won't have time to read it it's a different kind of love you all understand it's a different kind of love I cannot believe God just with my intellectual fate of hope I need F Faith from God to believe him I cannot please God with an intellectual fate I cannot please God with a fill your love I cannot please God with hope he that come unto God Must Believe is my faith so it has to be God coming in when God comes in he brings these things he brings his faith he brings his love he brings these things and then we serve him with those things and then we please him with those Hallelujah does everybody see it now am I've tried my best and all what I'm saying to you I got quotes of course with human love and stuff I got several quotes on it I try my best not to do it you know to go back to all the quotes I just try to override to try to rush I can't trust that you see it because I hate the S to put and say stuff I don't want the quotes for I hate to do I don't want to do that I want to be sure that when I'm saying the prophet of God says it and I got the quotes and the scriptures to back me up you'll understand some of what I'm saying tonight songs contradictory because a lot of people think in their mind that these things you know they think they they don't see what it is amen and there's all of that out there but thank the Lord the hour has come where the Holy Ghost is bringing all of that to us and bringing these things to our memory aren't we happy for it aren't you glad for it amen amen I trust this meeting tonight was a blessing to you we it's true we we covered a lot of ground recovered a lot all right and I try my best to see and I trust it was a blessing to you you so now as you leave the meeting don't forget what you want to do tonight we want to make a consecration we want to be able to bring the human side of us that human life under subjection that the life of God in us will take control now Wednesday we will go a little bit deeper I have a few quotes I want to share with you and we will we'll probably not re go back into this tonight but we will go into the place where God when God AC you he proves to you he gives you the evidence that you have eternal life okay so if it be his will pray for that or maybe something else whatever he wants me to do maybe if we can I better not mention it you know what it is I don't want I don't have the quotes for Gabriel I don't have it right I don't have it so I don't I could find it I could take my time and find it for Wednesday but I don't have it with me I purposely didn't travel with it because I told myself I appreciate at home first I'll bring those quotes to home first but we'll see what happened all right so we trust the Lord are you blessed tonight oh what a blessing to give it all to Jesus to die and that that brings you brings you into agreement with God that you can say I and my follow are one Hallelujah I'm dead to all these things amen amen it is not my f your love that controls me it's not hope that controls me amen what controls my life is the faith of almighty God it's the love of almighty God it's the joy of almighty God it's not my human Joy it's the joy of the Lord Brother [Music] hallelujah amen amen amen amen amen we can go on and on and on and on but Israel you better come up because that anointing is still here with me and I could go on as I'm talking to you I see more things just opening up before my eyes and I got to stop see I I mean I plan to go fishing with Israel Tom moreor but Israel and and um uh Lei Levi I have fun fishing I love fishing I enjoy it see I'm happy for it but that doesn't take the place of the joy of the Lord amen you see a church it's something different see God bless you all H amen heard brother Amanda talking about the face of cane you know you can go fishing you catch a bunch of fish and you leave the lake and you still have a face like Cain but when you come to the Lord and you give your heart to the Lord and you put his joy in you there's no face of Cain I've seen some people go there and they cast fish and they leave the lake and they have a face of can miserable and unhappy because the joy of the Lord is not in them but how happy we are tonight and we Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory because we know what he has done what he has given to right we possess eternal life two Natures making us a strange people that the world calls She's Strange it's true we are strange they're right right I don't understand that she's strange she looks strange she dresses strange she talks strange She's Strange it's true it's true it's

through you amen well that that one sure song strange sometime it's you singing sometime it's the Holy Spirit singing through you that's what the prophet say said the holy ghost singing through you amen look I got to stop Isel come but Israel you better come because if you don't come I'm I'm I'm you know I I could continue here on and on and on and on and on because we're in that atmosphere where we could just stop and just feed and feed and feed on the things of the Lord and what are feeding on the things that he has given us all those wonderful things he's placed in our lives in our
