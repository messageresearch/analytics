name we pray amen and amen and amen praise the Lord thank you all so much for the beautiful specials that'll be all the music you may be seated amen The Lord Is Right on Time amen praise the Lord even even when we forget there's somebody else in the body to remind us amen so thank you sister they're saying the last special it was it was such a blessing to me because it was like right into my notes and so we know that it was there was the holy spirit amen and so before I forget I want to read the precious Saints there in Phoenix brother Israel was just telling me so my good friend and brother brother R you know I feel like um you know maybe the Lord has put us together for a little reason uh uh brother R and I used to work together or we used to work for the same company we didn't really work together different departments but we worked together for for a while and he moved on to another company and I moved on to another company and without even you know realizing it we're now working across the street from each other so so praise the Lord so God orders the footsteps of the righteous amen and so uh certainly uh happy to be here uh this evening uh you know I kind of was thinking that I wouldn't be able to get by and just come and visit that maybe with the youth service or something somebody uh would be uh speaking tonight but uh here I am amen and so I you know I just jotted down a few notes uh during Sunday school this morning and we'll see if the Lord will help us this evening I know everybody's Fanning but we're gonna we're gonna not let any circumstance anything hinder us tonight amen and so we'll just try to get out of the way and let God speak to us even if it's just for one person but uh amen we're I believe it was the brother last night we're not here just for one person we're not leaving anybody behind amen we're taking everybody with us amen praise the Lord as Pharaoh you know he tried to compromise with Moses and Moses said we're not leaving you know not even a hoof behind we're taking everything with us amen so no matter how far gone your children are or whatever it is you're not leaving them behind you're taking them with you Hallelujah glory to God amen amen God can conquer every circumstance amen I've seen it time and time again no matter how far in darkness in the pits of hell they are amen he can conquer Hallelujah why because he already proved it for us on that second day when uh when he died and descended into hell there he was amen the word of God In Hell hallelujah amen with every fornicating spirit with every demon Spirit there with every Spirit of lust every lesbian Spirit every homosexuals every Spirit In Hell Hallelujah and that word nature overcame right in Satan's Dominion glory to God not only did he overcome but he took his keys away from him Hallelujah and so that Mighty conqueror has descended again in this hour and is brought back to you and I the victory Hallelujah to overcome in Satan's Eden amen hallelujah praise God is that your confession tonight amen do you have the victory amen praise the Lord's soul amen it's hard to believe that it's been almost six months since the last time I was here five months or so and uh the last time I was Heroes I was on my way to Africa so brother Israel just asked me to give a few a little short testimony and I want to get into the word so I'll just make a very short make it very very brief or try to but uh you know I think I requested prayer or maybe mentioned it and uh you know your prayers as brother Adam said when you get over there and you're facing Witch Doctors you're facing all kinds of demonic Powers you know your your prayers are very much appreciated and so uh um I try to make a long story short but uh yeah I mean I mean there was just circumstance after circumstance I mean I was telling brother Israel I'll just save time not going to all the detail but it was like just every demon in hell was trying to prevent us from from going there and we had to press we had to fight we had to pray pray through fight for every battle or fight for every inch of ground but by the grace of God we made it the lord gave us several souls and we had a real tremendous tremendous time and uh again we don't go there it's not a picnic amen it's a battle and we're fighting for every inch of a ground and the Lord really really helped us I believe to speak to some of the ministers to show them a more a more perfect way in the word and just that's what we're here for Amen to encourage each other and to help each other grow and as the prophet of God I believe we can say he prophesied and said when the church finds his brother the kindness when the church finds his holy decency you know when the church in other words comes to I'll just say in my own words when the when the church finds that lost coin it'll call to its other brother and come and rejoice with us amen and again the prophet of God also said when the power of this church Rises it'll call his Brethren when the power of this church Rises it'll call his Brethren amen oh and I almost I can almost say this day this scripture is fulfilled hallelujah amen so we're in the hour and we're in the season that God is ordained and so again just trying to make a long story short uh we did have a real tremendous time there it was just a very short trip over Easter and then we made it back by the grace of God and so believe it on the way back we had zero trouble [Laughter] but on the way there it was very very tough extremely the most difficult trip that I've ever taken and um I'll just go ahead and say this real quick uh right before I I didn't know whether we would be able to make it or not we were stuck in in overseas and I called the brother that I was supposed to be meeting the pastor our host Pastor I said brother we're having all this trouble uh you know we're going to be late for sure to the convention we may not even make it just pray just pray and the brother really encouraged me and he as he was praying he said God's Mighty Angel is with you don't worry God's Mighty Angel is with you and so when he said that somebody kind of just struck me and I was consoled after that and there's many more things I can say along those lines but the following day the next day um again I'll just make a long story short there's many many things that could be said but right when we were there going through customs or getting ready to go through customs there was a riot broke out right in the airport a like a protest you know right in the airport and and of all this this huge airport it was right in right in front of us where we were supposed to be and so I told the brother that was with me I said just stay close to me and do exactly what I do so we just busted our way through that through the the crowd and we finally I made it through and I scanned my passport and I made it through the through the gate uh the glass door and as soon as I made it through they shut everything down and my brother was on the other side and I was on this side and so I thought I told the brother later I said nothing no offense not nothing against you but that can make a good sermon amen you were fooling around getting distracted by everything and I was had my eye on the prize I my passport was scan I made it through the gate and you were left behind amen but that's true amen you know and uh and so we get caught up in the things of the world distractions and everything else and that door is going to close amen and so but there I was I could see my brother and I said I'm not leaving without you I'm saying we're staying here and I just we stood there for like 45 minutes close they would they couldn't do anything because of the protests they didn't want any you know any trouble so I remember it it came to my mind just some little prayer or something the prophet said so I pulled off to the side I got a little bit quiet and I began praying and I remembered that brother when he said God's Mighty Angel is with you it reminded me then of course that Pillar of Fire the angel of the Lord I said God if that Mighty Angel is with us may he move through this crowd right now and quiet the people and long enough to where my brother can get through the gate and brother sister no more than just praying that within just a few minutes there was the the whole crowd just quieted and lo and behold one of the security guards which I had been talking to them for 30 45 minutes trying to get them to open the gate and they wouldn't do it and so finally the crowd hushed the one guard came he opened the gate and like four or five people uh came in my in the brother and I we went to the to go to the other part of security and then we heard on the announcement that they closed the thing for the rest of the day so praise the Lord amen God is still an on-time God Amen he can still deliver the angel of the Lord is still with his people amen we are in another book of Acts amen we are not waiting for another book of Acts amen we are here hallelujah amen and we haven't been here amen and so they all things are possible with God Amen and so I had a little um dental work a few days ago so I'm gonna try not to uh be cautious of that my mouth is still a little bit sore so y'all pray for me I'm just going to try to take my time and um but I do remember the last time I was here brother Israel which I I really appreciated it but brother Israel I believe was encouraging the musicians the songwriters the musicians and so forth to get into some inspiration a current inspiration right inspiration from the message right to to to start singing some songs and and bringing forth some songs from the message amen how many has accomplished that that that task one praise the Lord all right so I said Amen to that because that's where I'm at I mean the inspiration of this message I live it breathe it sleep it eat it every day and so to me now no offense but this is just your brother here encouraging you a little bit and backing up the pastor but to me if we say we believe the message and we're in the inspiration of the message but the songs that we listen to the songs that we sing don't don't denote that something is wrong amen something is wrong and so we picked up a religious spirit or some something or another but we should be in uh the message Amen in the word in the inspiration of the word and if I could sing I was I would sing you these songs but um uh just to save time you know everybody's everybody's Fanning and stuff but um let me just go ahead and read this one song and if anybody maybe you've already heard it if not uh you know I can get you the the links or whatever and we'll bring the pastor's Vision to pass amen would that will that work you all know where I'm looking in this direction just like this morning everybody knows who the preachers were that weren't raising their hands all right everybody knows who the musicians are and who The Talented singers are in the church but this is uh from a particular group that has done a lot of inspiration a lot of singing uh concerning the the message excuse me in this particular song Here is called the spirit and the bride and it says we have come from a part to a full realization of Who We Are we are the bride the mystery of Christ now being revealed at this time we are the Overcomers the way the truth and the life we are the spirit in the bride we are the second book of Acts living Epistles red of men ambassadors of Christ we are the end time Apostles Prophet priests and Kings we are the spirit and the bride amen we are Esther the bride and morning star or the bright and shining star we are Ruth The Mystery of the moabite we are the bride adorned with the word heavily Jerusalem coming down we are the spirit and the bride and we say come amen we have made a stand that cannot break we have the helmet sword shield and breastplate Mighty Gentile Warriors of this age and it's the glory of God within our gates we are the spirit and the bride and we say come we are the spirit and the bride and we say come amen is that your testimony amen did you feel the faith a man punctuating that is that right so it's something amen and if you look back through history every Revival produce another hymn book amen and so it shouldn't be any any exception today is that right amen so I can go on and on amen and so the the when you have songs that are inspired amen just like oh you know I'll say this to me Christian music is not just songs about Jesus or songs about God or the Bible I mean it's Holy Ghost inspired music amen that's to me what Christian music is amen praise the Lord so God richly bless you and again we'll give these to you free of charge amen praise the Lord and so pray for the my little family we're trying to work on singing a few of these but um amen I believe that's I believe that would be it amen so let's stand to our feet for a word of Prayer and while we're getting ready to go to the Lord in prayer you can turn to will turn to let's turn to three places quickly wrote real quick scriptures we'll just go ahead and read and then we'll um we'll pray afterwards Olivia Leviticus 14 quickly Leviticus 14 7 one scripture here again I'm just trying to save time some other brother said I got about four or five hours tonight so we'll be good the brother's kidding me about my time I get the last laugh you know so [Laughter] amen Leviticus 14 7. praise the Lord and so this is a very special I don't have again time to go into all of it but Leviticus 14 7 obviously this is the Old Testament law this was the for the atonement for the cleansing of a leper it was the the Old Testament type of the two doves taking the one dove the male uh cutting its head off and draining the blood onto the female the living bird and that was an atonement for cleansing of leprosy and also for the cleansing of the home amen so the token as the prophet of God tells us is not it's for us but it's for our home amen hallelujah and so this is a wonderful type here and we'll just read verse seven and this is referring to the blood from the the male onto the female and from the female on to the person with Leprosy and leprosy is a type of sin amen so the manifestation of the blood speaking made this person completely clean from sin Hallelujah yeah and he shall sprinkle again he's speaking concerning the priest amen so this is the the priest an ordained priest would have the commission and know-how to accomplish this amen Glory Hallelujah so Leviticus 14 7 and he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times Amen to him that is to be cleansed amen not him that doesn't want to be cleansed is that right so he comes before the priest to be cleansed and he shall sprinkle upon him that he should be cleansed from leprosy seven times and shall pronounce him clean and shall let the living bird loose into the open field Hallelujah Amen in Revelations 19 verse 7 and 8. amen this this person with with the leprosy which is a type of sin amen it was a sin unto uh leprosy was a disease unto death and so is sin and but this Old Testament type pronounced healing and made the person clean free from sin by the seven Stripes of blood from the dead maid amen Glory Hallelujah so in other words I brought him into a perfect state of cleansiness cleanliness and perfect state of wholeness amen all right relation 19 7 verse seven and eight very familiar scripture Glory hallelujah amen let us be glad and rejoice glory and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints amen let's bow our heads for what a prayer our heavenly father Lord thank you so much for your mercy Lord we have read your word may take control of the service father may your people Lord be attentive to your word may they punctuate every word of God with an amen father made an atmosphere be created Lord that you can Lord bring Deliverance Lord that you can speak to your people that you could call their name when the decade arise to the occasion father in Jesus name we pray amen and amen you may be seated I'll read this last uh scripture just as you're seating being seated a Virgin Mary scripture and I won't read the whole thing again Matthew 25 this is the parable of the foolish virgin the wise and foolish virgin they both heard the same cry they both came out in other words they both came out of denominationalism they both came out to go and meet the bridegroom is that right and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to me in verse 6 then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and the foolish enter to the wise give us of your oil for our lamps have gone out but the wise answers saying not so unless they're not unless they're being not enough for us and you but go rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready somebody say ready they that were ready went in with him in the marriage and the door was shut amen and so I used to think you know sometimes just in my mind that the difference you know I'm not I'm looking to preach on the wise and foolish virgin but the I used to think just kind of commonly that the difference between the wise and foolish is that the foolish didn't understand or they didn't know the way to the marriage but the wise did but here we can see that eventually the unwise the foolish virgins eventually found their way to the marriage but it was too late and so I think maybe that's why the prophet of God often times referred to the foolish virgin as being dilatory right being slothful being like not diligent is that right just oh it'll be okay or oh you know I'm in the message I believe God's been a prophet or oh you know it's okay you know dilatory I mean not concerned in other words you haven't been awakened you haven't been alerted to the hour and season that we are in and we are in the battle of the coming of the Lord amen how many has been called to that battle amen the prophet God says home life broke up all these kind of things taking place I mean heartache disease sickness everything oh hell is coming against this bride against this true truth because why we are in the battle of the coming of the Lord and in every age when it's still open the messenger caught the age and he pronounced it what did that do to it created spiritual war is that right and so in this hour when the mystery of the coming of the Lord has been and is being revealed it creates War amen praise the Lord I said it has been and is being because we're catching the mystery amen just like as brother uh uh brother uh Israel said this morning amen it was finished what was once prophecy is now history but we're we're still catching up amen praise the Lord and so for a little title this morning or this evening if I can speak a little simple title that the lord gave me on the trail to the marriage the trail to the marriage and then for a subject if we can speak on from the temporal to the original and so we're going to try to hurry through this not hurry but uh you know trying to get through as much as we can and this is just a just a small small glimpse of it I say this very very humbly but I really appreciate what brother Israel was going through this morning and is we're writing the same channel on many many things and uh you know I don't don't really make statements like this or the prophet made a few statements like this I'll go ahead and say it but you know by the grace of God you know uh the Lord has been good to me and he's and I have just tremendous tremendous he's given me about 30 40 50 sermons just in the past few months of inspiration right in the lines of the third pool and all of these things that we've been talking that brother Israel was talking about this morning and so I'm going to do the best I can with the help of the Lord to just Express a few of those right so I can't I can't speak everything but um some of it would take months and months and months of background and so on and so forth um but you know we're on a trail amen we're not called to just uh just to be here right we're not called to just warm up you to be religious to sing songs and which all that is is great right but we're we're called for a purpose amen and so here if we look at Matthew 25 real quick you know again both groups the wise and the foolish both heard the same voice the same cry saying go behold the bridegroom come in just go you out to meet him is that right and the prophet of God identified that with the shout amen the shout of first Thessalonians 4 the shout and the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God is that right so that is the coming of the Lord amen and we found out that the second coming much like the first coming is not an instantaneous event in time amen the first coming was what it took place over a 33-year period and it was scripture upon scripture upon scripture upon scripture being identified and the next thing you know the first coming was fulfilled amen and so is it today Amen in this hour that we are living in so again the prophet of God uh identified that the Midnight Cry behold the bridegroom cometh with the shall of first Thessalonians 4. amen amen y'all still with me amen y'all still thank God and want to worship God in you know thank him for his word amen praise the Lord amen and so with that being said that that that if we can just narrow that down then that would give us to understand that both groups heard the men I cry behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him amen both groups are rose trim their lamps and went out to meet the word of God being unveiled in this hour amen right all right so there was a trail amen there was a trail that the wise had to had to recognize and walk on that trail because it was leading to air the marriage amen and I don't have time to go I mean back into the the Orient the old custom how that would take place behold the bridegroom cometh meaning the riot and his party is coming to join the bridegroom and her party to go into the marriage amen so there was a trail that they had to go on to find the bridegroom and to go into the marriage is that right amen and so as I mentioned I used to just kind of think that though the unwise they didn't know the trail but here we see that they eventually found the trail but it was too late all right now let's just keep going on Amen so the prophet of God says here in the message why Christ speak not only me I pray for I pray for you also that together as a body of Christ called out from the world making ready for the promised land that God will give me courage to speak the way amen so God I mean he's telling us that we have been called out from the world how many has been called out from the world Amen what is the world the lust of the eye the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life amen all these all of these things the glamor of Hollywood all these things that's being projected to us each and every day through school through work through everything out there that is of the world the lust of the eye the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and he that is a part of the world will pass away with the world but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever amen and so we've been called out of the world called out of denominationalism doing what making ready for the promised land and now the prophet of God says here now God give me courage to speak the way so he's telling you we've been called out making ready for the promised land and I've got to speak the way Hallelujah in other words it's being laid out for us amen and that is the under the prophet's third pool amen and the third pool is a thing that he did not explain is that right the angel told him in so many words that this is for the rainbow trout amen because remember he was fishing I don't have time to go into it but the whole intent of him fishing was not just to have uh somebody arguing about a vision or anything like that but the whole intent was for him to catch the rainbow trout that was in the deep end of the pool so the third pool is for the rainbow trout and so that's why the prophet of God said that in so many words he says uh that the third pool will be to him that has wisdom amen he didn't explain it but he prophesied it it's on the books and tapes and it's hidden waiting for the time for it to be revealed to the predestinated Sons and Daughters of God that have need to find the trail Hallelujah they have needs to connect to that word and manifest that which the prophet has spoken Hallelujah amen that God will give me courage to speak the way make the way clear so you won't miss the trail hallelujah oh glory to God thank God for that clear sounding voice that has made the way clear so we don't miss the trail I mean I know sometimes preachers will put weeds in the way they'll they'll make stupid statements like you know if I had the Bible if I had the message you know which one would I choose that's that's just some kind of a psychological attack of the enemy to put Weeds on the trail amen but God has already spoken the trail the way and we must cast off reasoning cast off everything which would exalt itself against this way Hallelujah Glory amen give me courage you're speaking to make the way clear so you won't miss the trail hallelujah amen somebody say God help me not to miss the trail this is between life and death This is between the tribulation period And The Rapture Nothing Else Matters your job your house your nothing else matters but this Trail Glory Hallelujah [Music] I'll tell you by the grace of God I'll follow the bloody Footprints of him who went on before us amen Glory so let me just try to calm down and teach a little bit but the prophet says again speaking of the marriage let's just drill into this a little bit and I trust something will be said that will help you I think I'll keep my jacket on try to keep me uh contained should I keep it on or take it off all right I'm just testing you make sure we're still still ready all right praise the Lord so um again speaking of the marriage uh very familiar crow in the message uh proving his word if you want to pull that up sisters now brother man I'm staying here let me just read yes okay let me just yeah okay let me let me just read from the top there yeah not no more as a church see not know more the brightest called in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head what is that the marriage why would the Southern Man be revealed to join the church that's you and I Amen to join us to the Head not in in some kind of imaginary thing but in a reality form to join us to the Head amen he says join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride amen so I'll just give you a spoiler alert the the the marriage takes place here the mayor the Rapture is going to the wedding supper amen so we're on a trail to the marriage and we're to be United here with our bridegroom with the head Hallelujah and the prophet of God said that the bride will be a super Church a super race as she nears The Headstone that's prophecy I mean where are you at in the picture amen where are you at in the vision are you on the trail are you off in the weed somewhere looking being distracted by something out there in the world amen where are you at in this Trail Gloria he did the bride will be a super racist super church as she nears The Headstone so the prophet of God is saying here the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride then he says the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of manner will be when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word I mean the word not some word or part word you know and that's the devil tries to get you to compromise in your mind saying oh well you could just be a little bit of the word or you can believe this you can believe that but where all the word no sin no darkness no no unbelief all the word 100 the word no darkness no sin no unbelief no church member no religion no Iota 100 the word Glory Hallelujah the silliest spotless Perfect Bride of Jesus Christ amen but we're coming to that we must be cleansed just like the man with Leprosy there cleansed and made perfectly whole in other words come to a perfect state all right let me try to hurry up here the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergy man do you see what I mean he says Jesus Christ will come down in flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church in him as one amen the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper amen all right amen she's already united we go to the marriage supper I'm just going to skip this he says because the marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person that's you the word must Unite with you in other words the word must be revealing itself to you not the word amen your name being cold amen the word the identification of the word of which you are must be being revealed to you amen not the pastor's word not the word for some other day not brother Brandon was where not our Lord Jesus's word but the word spoken of you for this hour must become you you must Unite with him amen glory and and when the the word unites with the person and they too become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing amen amen praise the Lord so let's try to teach this a little bit amen and so when we speak on the marriage usually I'm just going to touch on three things tonight there's a you know a lot of different things that we could say but usually in a marriage you need at least three things I know there's more but you need at least a wedding band right right so the the bridegroom slips the slips the the ring on the on the finger is that right and then you need a marriage certificate but most importantly you need the wedding garment as well you know in this situation so we'll just speak on the these three things real quick turn out to take too long but uh again the wedding band we can say this we can say a lot about this but brother bam says here in the message of the invisible Union of the bride of Christ if you can pull that up and so brother bam says hallelujah now notice you're not only that but you're going to the wedding in the sky and you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmerited Grace a wedding band of Grace unmerited of your own Brothers give me a little bit more on the monitor please he says and you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmerited Grace a wedding band of Grace unmerited of your own amen you didn't do anything to deserve it you don't even know anything about this word you didn't know anything about the message of the hour God did this on his own amen he slipped it on you God did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world Amen so this he slipped let me just read so he slipped the wedding band on you there put your name on a book what are things given hallelujah praise God Amen he put it on you there he knew you before you even were on the earth and he put the wedding band of unmerited Grace amen when you were in the ball bar room when you were on drugs when you were on the street when you were doing crooked business deals God's unmerited grace was with you amen and he put that wedding band upon you he already said your mind whether you like it or not you may not even know it yet but I have chosen you glory to God Amen think about that amen he put it on you that seal and man that basically says you're as good as mine amen when a man that's an honorable man approaches an honorable lady and they and they Exchange rings or vows or some little promise ring amen that is as good as done amen and so God did this to you without you even knowing it before the foundation of the world glory to God Amen put your name on a book amen you didn't deserve it he chose you when you were in the world Amen it's his grace amen is that right he chose me he chose you is that right so he slips the wedding band on you unmerited Grace nothing of your self that you ever did he foreknew you before the foundation of the world and knew what stand you would take in this hour he knew what stand you would take in the university in in at the job in the office out there on the street he knew what stand you would take and he predestinated you and said you are my predestinated to adoption to be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ amen a little more on the monitors brother amen I saw you you are pretty destinated to be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ amen amen so now amen we'll just move quickly thank you Brothers the marriage certificate amen amen so we're moving from the wedding band to the marriage certificate and brother bam says here also in that same message the next call please 224 paragraph 224 invisible Union my brother says here now your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life what the lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural Union in other words the old book that that came into fruition by the natural Union of your mother and father amen that was your old identity that was the old you that has nothing to do with you all of your complexes all of your fears all of your temperamental ways your your lust for away all of that that you inherited from that Old Nature has nothing to do with you Glory hallelujah amen that is your own nature from the old book but he predestinated You by unmerited favor and put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life not your natural life but the Lamb's Book of Life in other words your name was written in the life of the Lamb glory to God now think about that that creative blood cell of Jehovah glory to God that one blood cell that was formed in the womb of the Virgin Mary that one blood cell glory to God that conquered every that conquered every pitch of hell I mean that one blood cell your name glory to God every bride member was in that one creative blood cell holy holy holy without sin without blemish the life of almighty God the Lamb's Book of Life your name was there there's a thousand quotes I can read but I'll go on amen that is your marriage certificate now I don't know about y'all but when I got married I had a marriage certificate amen how many had your marriage certificate amen so in other words it was a possession it wasn't just some imaginary something amen it was an actual possession this me and me and me and my wife right there our names right there we're married amen okay and so this is what the prophet says not the old book of your natural Union but your new bride Hallelujah your new life is an elantric of Life your marriage certificate Hallelujah where your true Eternal germ from the beginning takes hold now you're not only forgiven but you're Justified so the marriage certificate is your true Eternal germ from the beginning glory to God before sin every internet before Satan was ever even created your marriage certificate was in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah amen so these things must become a reality to you an identification to you so that you can have faith to overcome in this hour amen amen these are my notes now he has come down from eternity with your original name from the lamb Book of Life your marriage certificate amen is that right and so let me just say something to my stumble you a little bit but amen we know that the Bible says your name or the the Overcomers that won't worship the Beast all these things their names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Amen amen but if you're a predestinated Believer your name is not written anymore in the Lamb's Book of Life okay now think about that amen it's not just written anymore it is being revealed amen it's being revealed it's being declared is that right amen because if we look at the cloud there if you can turn the uh put the picture up of the cloud hey man so so this is what we must do we must move excuse me your name was no longer in the and your name was no longer just written amen by now it's being revealed and so you must move from that identification of your name being written to your name being revealed is that right amen because your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life the life of the blood of the Lamb is that right and so when that blood speaks what is it speaking it's speaking better things amen and speaking better things for you than your old life is that right excuse me amen I'll say it like this you know we know that that book that Adam had contained all the names of the Sons and Daughters of God that was to be created is that right amen and brother Brandon called that the Book of Life the book of redemption the title deed all of these things is that right and it was sealed by Seven Seals why because man had fallen is that right man had fallen and failed to speak those names is that right he failed to speak those names so we went back to the hand of the original owner waiting for Redemptive claims is that right and the prophet of God calls this Bible The Book of Life the Lamb's Book of Life the book of redemption in other words that book was hidden inside this book is that right it man sealed by Seven Seals waiting for Redemptive claims and then in this hour I'll just speed up but in this hour we can remember in in in Revelations 5 the lamb was in the hand of the original owner sealed with Seven Seals John wept because no man in heaven or an Earth was worthy to take the book is that right but there came one an angel with a strong voice said weep not John for Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed and is worthy to take the book is that right and so John wasn't worthy nobody was worthy and but the book was open is that right and then in Revelations 10 the one who was just unworthy was now commanded by the angel to go and take the book is that right and the prophet of God said whenever John got happy and got next to himself he must have seen his name there amen so if John represents the bride and when the Lamb's Book of Life was open the book of redemption your title deed to your inheritance of this Earth was open John recognized his place in the word John recognized his marriage certificate John recognized his new name being revealed from the Lamb's Book of Life Glory Hallelujah he must have looked beyond the curtain of time he said there's John amen there's John and when this happened they recognized that God had made them Kings and Priests and they sang not an old song but they sang a new song Glory Hallelujah and only those that have recognized their name being revealed can sing that song Hallelujah and so your name was just simply written but now because the mighty one the lion of the tribal Judah has come and has opened the seals and within that Revelation is your identity from the Lamb's Book of Life Glory Hallelujah amen Glory Hallelujah This is Gospel right amen praise the Lord so that is your identity your marriage certificate amen your name there being written amen as brother Pam said it's not you know saying Ormond Neville Lee Veil but it's the mystery revealed while it's what calling those names amen so the mystery of the word being revealed while it's calling those names what is it calling you for to receive that which has been opened Glory Hallelujah all right y'all still with me still on the trail I think we lost about half of you we'll keep going though amen praise the Lord all right let's keep going amen the wedding garment we won't speak I have a lot of notes on this but we'll try to brush it up a little bit but can y'all handle a little bit more yeah amen well last time I was here brother Israel I think made some kind of statement like we believe the message whatever the prophet said we believe it amen we may not understand it or something of that nature but we believe it and we want to receive it amen and so let me uh speak on the wedding garment for a few minutes amen because we know the scripture says the word bride has made herself ready and to her as Grant and that she should be arrayed in white Landing clean and white for the for the white linen is the righteousness of the Saints amen praise the Lord and so these are my notes right here and we'll see if this stumbles you but I wrote down right here the wedding garment is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost itself amen all right so brother Adam says here in the message things that are to be and I'm trying to go somewhere so just bear with me amen all right praise the Lord so brother upstairs here I got the baptism of the holy spirit that still has nothing to do with it that's only a temporary or temporal gift for you amen that's only a temporary gift for you in another place I don't have all the quotes but he said the Holy Spirit can baptize you and anoint you and on the inside of you there's still a devil all right that's how in the Pentecostal age they can commit adultery speaking tongues preach the gospel all these things and function by the Holy Ghost because they were baptized with the Holy Spirit but on their soul they were still a devil they weren't baptized in their soul amen so brother says here I got the baptism of the holy spirit that still has nothing to do with it that's only a temporary temporal gift for you the real gift is your soul down in there see that was born of God and that controls the whole thing to the word and the will of God and there you grow up there you grow up amen that real you that was predestinated from the foundation of the world when you hear the call of the opening of the word revealing your name calling you forth amen there you grow up is that right and there you grew up and there you're a son and daughter of God you're a child of God and these things as you come up like the mother excuse me now you're in the bowels of the earth trying to come forth you're a Son of God coming forth and you see the words and you said I should do this I should be born again in other words you're coming forth you're lining up with the word of God Amen so the real gift is that predestinated seed down on the inside of you that must be quickened and come to life amen and so your own nature then goes away and now you have a new nature from your from the Lamb's Book of Life that is coming forth amen and the difference between every other age in this age is when that seed was quickened they uh they can still operate by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then die and go in the grave but in in this hour we have the opportunity to grow into the full stature of Christ amen so we must grow from the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the Holy Ghost itself amen you guys okay for some teaching amen and so again you must grow from the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the Holy Ghost itself is that right because we know that justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost those are the three works of Grace that constitute the new birth amen amen but when you're born again you're just a baby is that right and so there you grow now into the Holy Ghost itself the fullness of Christ in other words brother remember another spot the justification makes way for sanctification sanctification makes way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and what we don't stop there though baptism of the Holy Ghost makes way for the Holy Ghost itself amen praise the Lord are you guys good amen there's a couple dozen other quotes that we can give amen you know Brethren refers to it in other places the true baptism of the holy spirit in other words you're born again and when you're born again you're what you're at the bottom of the pyramid amen like one brother said one time he felt like he was doing pretty good you know has having faith you know we're feeling pretty strong and he he's like well I feel like I got a lot of faith he looked at the pyramid and faith is at the bottom amen so you know as brother Israel was saying this morning that we must keep ourselves in the dust Amen on the road to Damascus is that right there's nothing good within us amen but you know when we're born again that's just the beginning right and so we must add then to our faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness is that right so then what are we doing we're growing to the full stature of Christ is that right amen and brother map said you take the blood out of a man and put the blood of Jesus Christ in him and that man will have the faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge the tempers the patience the godliness of Jesus Christ not a religious person but the knowledge of Jesus Christ I do that only which pleases the father amen and the volume of the book it is written of me here I come to do thy will O Lord the knowledge of Jesus Christ amen is that right so amen what are you doing then your doubt being built up into the true baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost itself the person amen and that's where the Prophet God said that the token is the literal life of Jesus Christ amen the token is you in Christ as persons together amen and so the baptism of the Holy Ghost was restored in 1906 but then the prophet of God still came and said apply the token when in the evening time when the full word the full Spirit comes into manifestation why because in the first stage amen just like in the type that we read the the worshiper that was to be cleansed from his sin must be sprinkled seven times amen seven times and so when our Lord Jesus Christ died upon the Earth and he died apart on the cross there was blood water spirit came out of him amen but in each age they only received a partial baptism is that right this is the gospel Amen in each age in Paul's age Paul said we've seen apart and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away with in other words Paul amen he he even prophesied and said we only have a part so in Paul's age they had a part Amen in other words they had one stripe of blood is that right they had one virtue that was that was poured out in the second age the third Age Again One stripe of blood one virtue that was poured out third age fourth age fifth age same thing seventh age one stripe of blood one virtue that was poured out but then as the prophet was entering into his new ministry and he was called here to the desert to meet not one Angel not two angels but seven angels with the seven spirits of God that was poured out in each age now the entire Holy Spirit visits the church glory to God Amen so he was caught up into the seven spirits of God Amen he was robed with those seven spirits amen and and we know that those seven spirits says the prophet of God said there's seven steps to God and the seven spirits represent the seven colors of the rainbow amen amen and so again we're talking about being transformed from temporary to original amen and so we'll leave we'll skip a lot of this here amen he spoke the trail and it's the mystery of the third pole opening the word I'll skip all this here on the seven Thunders and different things here amen but uh well let me just let me just read here a few notes I won't get too far into it if that's okay brother Israel but here you can go back and these are just my my notes I just I jot it down quickly but you can go back there's quotes for all of these things and uh again because we're being transformed from the temporary to the original we're being joined to the head is that right amen we're trying to find a trail hopefully we're on the trail if we're not on the trail let's get on the trail we're trying to find the trail to what to the marriage which is to be what joined to the head is that right which is to be what joined to the word that identifies and that and that is for us to be joined to you is that right so let me just go ahead and read these couple quotes here on the messages uh is this the sign of the answer uh sorry let me go to the one on the seventh Seer real quick we got a few minutes again so we're growing from the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the Holy Ghost itself to come to perfection a man from a perfect standing to a perfect state is that right and if I can just say like this in my own words from a perfect standing in other words the blood of Jesus Christ making atonement for us puts us in perfect standing before God Amen amen but we're moving from from from from uh what did I say in other words we're moving from from the pleading of the blood or from the intercession of the blood to the applying of the blood is that right so the blood is being applied to us the voice of the blood speaking is cleansing us from all unrighteousness and bringing us to a perfect state amen from the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the Holy Ghost itself the wedding garment a perfect State the righteousness of the Saints and in another place the prophet of God said then Satan's accusing is over how many heard him say that amen when he has nothing more to accuse his accusing is over is that right all right so in the message of the seventh seal uh paragraph 44 and brother Graham says here and it's the hour that the world has long to see is now approaching for it cries out for Redemption he says we can see the elements ready to bring it back we can see the elements ready to bring the church into the presence of Christ so he's identifying something for us we can see the elements ready to bring the church into the presence of Christ we can see the bride taking on the form putting the wedding garment on making ready we can see the lights flickering we know we are at the end so he said the bride b-r-i-d-e getting ready putting the wedding garment on is that right amen so making ready the bride making ready is that right she has made herself ready and those that were ready went in to meet the bridegroom is that right so the bride he's saying the elements in other words the things that we need to make us ready amen is here they're being identified we see it and they're like well one brother said in order to say what the prophet has said you have to see what he saw amen and so here he's seeing we can see the elements ready to bring it back we can see the elements ready to bring the church into the presence of Christ we can see the bride taking on the form putting the wedding garment on making ready Glory Hallelujah now hold that thought in your mind making ready praise the Lord amen and again being joined to the Head being joined on the marriage amen so we're being joined to the Head the prophet of God said it's the manifestation of the son of man that joins us to the head is that right but here he also says it's the seven Thunders that caps the pyramid amen in other words the seventh unders that bring back The Headstone is that right all right let's see if the Lord will help us put it together amen so you remember the pyramid messages it's the Capstone what did it do the Holy Spirit capped off the individual and seal it when we added to our faith righteousness godliness and faith and so forth and kept adding till we got seven things and the seventh one was love which is God that's how he makes the individual and caps him and seals him with the Holy Spirit then if that be so we've got seven Church ages that he's had seven Mysteries that's been sounded away and they fought for it to bring it back and now the headstone comes to cap off the church he says does the Thunders mean that my brethren sirs where are we at amen and now again in the same message uh paragraph 390 the prophet God says here is this the mystery of the Thunders that will bring back The Headstone you know the pyramid never was capped The Headstone has yet to come it's been rejected but here the prophet of God says the Thunders is to cap the church is that right to bring back The Headstone amen and and uh sorry but there was excuse me but there was one Minister one time that said because uh again there's this is a controversial thing but I trust you all y'all love me enough to to say what the prophet said amen but there was one brother and in the message in this I'm going to show you where the battle of the coming of the Lord is right in our midst remember one Minister one times was trying to preach on the Thunders and he basically took what the prophet of God said in the in the message uh questions and answers on the seal or questions and answers 1964 and he said the Thunders were revealed under the seals amen we're we're in deep water but we're going to get out real quick okay just bear with me amen and so he took that and said what the prophet said here it basically means nothing because the prophet was just presuming in other words he couldn't he couldn't connect this to with the word so he discarded it and said oh it's over here amen and so that's the same spirit amen that would say you know Mark 16 isn't inspired is that right that's the same spirit that would say uh you know I want to believe what Jesus said in Matthew Matthew 28 19. father son the Holy Ghost but I'm not going to take what Peter said is that right amen The Same Spirit in the message today weeds all over the trail the congregation can't find where they're going and they're dead amen and so we're in a battle amen these things have been sent to us for a purpose the prophet God saying they never sounded in vain amen they never sounded in vain they ever sent to us for a purpose and will read to you what those purposes are amen and so the seven Thunders joins their Church through the head and this is me this is my notes Here the prophet of God emphatically states there twice that the seven Thunders joins the church to the head and he also says the revealing of the son of man joins the church through the head is that right so again my notes the prophet was caught up into the white pyramid of seven angels the seven spirits of Elohim the seven colors of the rainbow the Fountain of God's being he was robbed in a seven color robe and made completely white to manifest the son of man his new ministry his adoption Ministry amen as as brother Israel was saying this morning he was entering into his new ministry and if I can say he came into the fullness of that Ministry and entered into that being clothed and made white amen by that which had been introduced in this hour to then now do what join the church to the head to manifest and to Proclaim and to preach these things amen and so he spoke the trail in the mystery of the third pool the opening of the word and the Seven Thunders or the prophet of God or the Jesus said my words are spirit and life is that right my words are spirit and life and if I can just go a step further amen there's also a controversy amen when we talk about the Thunders many people say it's the Mysteries under the seals is that all right then other people will say it's the virtues okay amen my opinion is that it's both because Jesus said my words are spirit and life amen it's the Mysteries but it's the seven spirits of God coming but from the angels of God the seven spirits of God coming in Angelic form with a message that thundered out to bring to us the literal life of Jesus Christ amen so his words are Spirit in life is that right amen so the the again these are just my notes I jot it down seven purposes or seven things mainly if the prophet of God said about the or I think I have eight things here actually and I'm just gonna I'm already in deep water so we're just gonna keep going and we're going to try to try to get some of you up out of the water hey man you're choking hey man you're gonna learn to swim or you're gonna drown praise the Lord but we're going to throw you a life a life jacket here in a minute all right amen I'm hoping y'all are taking notes because again remember this is between life and death This is between the tribulation and uh the rapture amen not my word but what the prophet said here is that right so again the seven Thunder is the prophet God said wakes up the bride is the bride's Revival gathers the bride together for rapturing Faith shows the bride how to prepare for great translation Faith these are all statements of the Prophet okay gathers the bride together for rapturing Faith shows the bride how to prepare for great translation Faith wakes up the bride is the bride's Revival he also said in the church age book and it will be real restore Apostolic Faith I mean it caps the pyramid and these are my words brings an end to Satan's accusation is that right I mean because the prophet God tells us in the force seal wait until those seven Thunders utter their voices to that group who really can take the word of God and hand it there amen talking about Satan he he gets pulled down with the sword the two-edged sword of the word of the Lord amen so amen these things bring an end to Satan's accusations is that right all right praise the Lord are you all still with me and again I'm quoting the prophet he says it will reveal the new name of Jesus which is the name that he received after he overcame death Hell In The Grave is that right amen and again these are my notes I wrote down here this evening once you have the wedding garment on Satan's accusations are over there's nothing to accuse you have moved from a perfect state our perfect standing under the blood to a perfect state by applying the blood amen all right and so we're moving from the temporary to the original all right you all still with me amen and the prophet of God tells us that there is only one original color how many knows what that is the prophet God said it was why so the the bride is clothed with white which is the righteousness of the Saints amen so there's only one original color and that's white amen but what about the seven colors of the rainbow all right we'll get into that and the brother map says here there's only one original color and that's white how many knows that there is only one original color anything else is mixed hey man so there's only one original color anything else outside of that is mixed and the property God said Christ is on a solid white unadulterated word from the beginning amen amen every color would be white if some chemistry had not broke into it amen amen every color would be right we're talking about your wedding garment the materials are here to make you ready the elements have been identified the material is here scattered out throughout the books and tapes the material has been provided but now the word bride has made herself ready amen the Bride made herself ready by doing what applying the blood applying the word word upon word sell upon sale and you are what being clothed in your wedding garment that's why and I was going to read it but in Revelation 16 where where where Israel was this morning if you keep reading down the voice of Christ speaks out right there after or right at the same time that the three frogs are identified the three frogs are identified by the opening of the seals and the voice of Christ speaks glory to God right after the the three frogs were identified the voice of Christ speaks it says blessed is he that watcheth in keepeth His Garment lest they walk naked and they see their shame I hope you all just caught that amen in the morning time the three unclean spirits were identified the next thing after that the spirit of Christ speaks and says blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth His Garment amen that's present tense in this hour the sports of Christ speaking the spirit of the Bride saying blessed is he that watcheth in other words identifying the wedding garment now make ready and blessed are you thou watch and don't play any more Church entity and make sure you are applying the blood and how are you going to apply the blood you can't go to Jerusalem and go at the foot of the cross and try to oblige no it's the voice of the blood speaking today Glory Hallelujah every color would be white if some chemistry had not broke into it amen but chemistry has broke into it and it's all messed up but now the blood of Jesus Christ has been provided that we can be made white again we can go back to the original the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ has been provided and every sin every stain every fear every lust every doubt can be annihilated can be dissolved and go back into the eternities into the infinite and go back to Satan where it belongs and now you stand as a son or daughter of God without sin in a perfect and clean conscience before God and now whatsoever you say glory to God will happen because it's the word of God coming from the mouth of God glory to God and so every color would be white if some chemistry had not broke into it amen glory every Church would be standing on the apostolic doctrine of the word and God confirming it every Church Shalom Tabernacle every Church in the message every Church on planet Earth would be standing on the apostolic Doctrine and the word of God and God confirming it if Creed is something else had not been mixed into it is that right amen so the original color is white and and maybe the the scientists or Engineers may know this but I got to look at that one time I said well what about the seven colors of the rainbow amen because we know that speaks of God is that right amen but come to find out when you blend all seven colors together it does what it makes white is that right brother Joe maybe he's thinking about it it's been too long since since College maybe amen but amen so all seven colors of the rainbow coming together make white so in the first stage there was one color that couldn't be made completely white is that right second-ish third age fourth age fifth age but now in this hour all seven Angel angels have come all seven spirits have come to bring to you the fullness of the atonement all seven Stripes of blood wherein being applied to your life you could be made completely righteous the righteous of the Saints completely white and go back to the original Glory Hallelujah amen these are my notes seven spirits to turn you back to original white seven colors make you white amen so if you have red yellow whatever it is four or five six colors it doesn't turn white it turns pale and goes to death amen all right so my notes again personification of Life the fullness of the spirit the Holy Ghost itself amen that's the hour that we're living in is not only the personification of death hell being created on Earth is that right amen the prophet of God in 1963 I believe it was was here in JCPenney in Tucson and seeing those those those those those basically those demon Spirits those women those poor women not knowing but have been infiltrated by Spirits from Hell amen and so that was hell being created being personified coming up upon the Earth is that right I mean that was you know 50 60 years ago is that right amen so hell has was identified back then as coming upon the Earth and here we are in this hour and the war is Raging the personification of death on its subjects and the personification of Life on Christ subjects and he's Gathering amen Christ is gathering his now from Heaven and Earth amen and Satan is gathering his from the four parts of the earth is that right glory to God so we're in a gathering time and you will be gathered one way or the other and those that are not gathered on one or the other take the tribulation period because they fail to come to the fullness of the atonement though they believe the message though they shout though they jumped or they dance they were dilatory they didn't take it seriously and they failed to come to the fullness of the atonement all right praise the Lord amen but you're being gathered were Satan's horses you know three colors religion politics demonic Powers is that right politics brother Israel is preaching on politics this morning amen be careful because that's Satan trying to gather you same thing with all your worldly habits all this nonsense on social media all these things be careful that Satan trying to gather you all right so we are in the hour of the personification of life as well as the personification of death the fullness of the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit itself the seven spirits of God the entire Holy Spirit visiting the church the fullness of the atonement the voice of the blood speaking present tense the seven Thunders whatever you want to call it the opening of the book this great manifestation of this great angel in this hour that has descended from eternity to lead us the angel of the Covenant that has come now to lead us in this Exodus Amen to lead us from partial atonement to full atonement to lead us to a body change glory to God all right and let me just go to the fourth seal we got two more quotes and more criminal close if the musicians can come amen we're going to try to find a this is happy to me I know it's pretty sobering amen but we amen we must be on the right Trail you know you've got the victory is that right you know because the mighty Angel has come down and has given us everything we have need of to overcoming this hour is that right amen so it's the grace of God Amen that is that that is coming to you to to to prepare you to be an overcomer is that right to equip you I should say you're already overcoming you overcame this you overcame that yesterday whatever it is but there's more ground to take is that right Satan is right on your heels oh amen there's more ground to take amen and so he's giving you more grace more word being revealed as you need it is that right amen so in the message of the fourth seal I'll just quickly read it and remember His Saints are clothed in white robes not mixed with denomination of Creeds now we find out the denomination Creeds here is where you get your mixed color but this is the original color he is writing so amen I'm already in trouble I'm not going to preach on any more Doctrine brother Israel amen but this is the original color he is writing so he is writing the original color glory to God and you have been made white your robes have been washed in the fullness of the blood of Jesus Christ and made white now he is writing the original color amen he is writing on the original color is on his people how many say you're his people amen amen the original color is on his people and they've been dipped in blood hallelujah thank God for this Holy Ghost religion is that right it's dripping with blood is that right it's still dripping with blood you can make your robes white tonight you can continue to apply your life the blood of Jesus Christ to your life and make your robes White the original color is on his people and they've been dipped in blood that cleanse that garment and sent it right back Yonder and that's so clear it clears that garment got rid of all the stains and sent it right back Yonder amen and you can just play something softly sister and if the song leader or brother Israel somebody could come up and help us with a few songs we'll get ready to close Amen to me brother remember says here let's just all stand to our feet [Music] thank you [Music] Glory [Music] amen but I just want to encourage you Saints amen if you're a challenge if you were convicted amen just just amen obey the voice of God don't resent anything amen amen this was the word from our Prophet that I was spoken tonight everything I all my notes everything you can take it back to the word amen don't resent it if it was contrary to maybe a different belief or whatever just ask God to help you to take away your unbelief to take away your your doubts whatever it is and enter in amen and ask God to help you to find the trail to make sure as the prophet of God said strive every day to keep the Life of Christ in you that you might be fruit bearing amen Lori because we are Overcomers is that right he has overcome for us but we're in this hour oh praise the Lord where it will be manifested Hallelujah and one of these days as you're upon this Trail and this Trail is the the road to Damascus Trail amen you're in the dust you're crucified completely the old you is dead and you're on this Trail there's something inside you though you've been in the message for 10 years 20 years 30 years 40 years 50 years you heard this and you heard that and you've you've been let down here you've been let down there but there is something inside of you that's pulsating you that's moving you forward there's more ground to obtain is that right think about the prophet of God after entering into a constellation of seven angels all these things taking place the Lamb of God coming into his mortal being and opening the seals right before us amen all of these things but yet he was still long and he was still he was still crying out to God and they're here in in up there in the Catalina mountains he found the ending of this Trail glory to God he identified everything he preached everything in that white Rock he that brother said he looked back and said once was once prophecy is now history but yet there he found the ending of this Trail glory to God when he seen that Sabbath Dove amen and and the voice cried out to him and said your enemy is dead glory to God his enemy was dead at Calvary but he had to follow this Trail to come to a perfect and full realization amen and so we all must come Amen to that same place to come to the fullness of the atonement on this Trail is that right so keep pressing keep pushing forward amen apply the blood amen and as the prophet of God said at the end of the end of the force sale he says me now they repent come quickly to you and be filled with the oil and the wine Glory got to be filled with it amen how many wants to be filled with the oil in the wine amen let's raise our hands amen let's make this our altar call amen not not any more foolishness feel me Lord with the oil and the wine glory to God Fill Me Lord not just not just a little drip not just a little ship but feel me my entire being I don't want anything of the world all of this nonsense that Satan is trying to put on me trying to bind me to speak his language all this stuff but God get that away from me and fill me with the oil and the wine glory to God and be changed from that denominational robe of Cain's death unto a snow white robe of eternal life given out by the bridegroom and then they'll go to the wedding supper someday in the Vindicated word of the Resurrection Granite Lord search the hearts why the people wait on you through Jesus name amen but let's just let's just pray and cry out to God Amen give me oil in my lap and keep me burning amen we'll sing that maybe in a minute but right now let's let that be our prayer to give us oil in our lamp amen and and to keep us burning is that right amen fill us with oil and wine the stimulation of Revelation the revelation of what the word of God being revealed to you your name from the Lamb's Book of Life being revealed to you the opening of The Seven Seals the revelation of the word of God it never sounded in vain it was sounded for a purpose so God revealed to me what that purpose is amen let's close our eyes and bow our heads amen may now they repent amen and repent this is Lord I'm not where I should be let me help me Lord amen we have to repent every day is that right I mean every head bowed every ice closed if you can raise your hand and say Lord fill me with the oil and with the wine if that's your heart is higher I believe God will honor your heart's request amen and may you lay everything aside and and tear your filled filled filled filled with the oil and the wine glory to God Amen in other words the revelation of the word is being identified in your life Glory let's pray Heavenly Father Lord thank you so much father enough has been said Lord we thank you so much father not really realizing Lord that we it would come to us over time like this father but we trust that you have had your way Lord

between us but may you feel us Lord with that oil and that wine father as the last seconds of the of the day of this age Lord perhaps the door is just about to close Lord we can see as it were maybe just a little light shining through the door before it's finally closed and never to be opened again father so Lord has that little illustration I didn't even realize Lord that that we would be coming to this but they're at the beginning Lord giving that little illustration how that in the natural Lord as I Was preparing to go to another land I had to go through customs I had to go through security I had my passport I had my identification I had my direction I knew where I was going and by the grace of God my passport was clean and I made it through the door but Lord there was those with me that were on the trail that were dilatory that didn't make it father so Lord may you help each and everyone here father as we are a body of Christ together Lord as the prophet of God said in the message of the token may they throw down their peanuts whatever it is and get on board the train father Lord Phillips and everyone with the oil and the wine Lord God until we can see every identification of the prophecy of this Prophet that you sent to us being manifested and identified in our life father Lord me help us father thank you Lord for the victory Lord that you've given us through the word in this
