[56:31] Jesus he was God's New
[56:34] Creation he came by a spoken creative
[56:36] word amen and in him was the blood and
[56:41] the spirit and the power to make me a
[56:45] part of that new
[56:47] creation and now that life is in me and
[56:51] when it comes to
[56:52] maturity I'm going to turn back to a
[56:55] spoken word SE
[56:57] and God in the church will have the
[56:59] testimony that he's the beginning of the
[57:01] creation of God and he is the ending of
[57:04] the creation of God Amen that's us
[57:08] Christ in
[57:10] us the
[57:12] Alpha and the Omega we're so thankful to
[57:17] be here tonight and to see you all out
[57:20] it's such a privilege thank you brother
[57:22] Israel wherever he is for the invitation
[57:26] to be
[57:27] here and to have the
[57:30] opportunity to minister among the
[57:33] brothers the ministers that are of the
[57:35] caliber that they are I
[57:38] indeed appreciate the honor and I thank
[57:41] you I thank you brother po I thank you
[57:43] for the family and the
[57:46] church and I I want to say I like to be
[57:51] challenged by the word of God that I
[57:54] heard brother Paul and brother Ferguson
[57:58] last night challenge us so that we can
[58:01] be checked up so that we know where we
[58:05] are at all times with the word of God
[58:08] and so I appreciate that when they take
[58:11] me into the word of God like that so I
[58:13] can examine myself in the light of the
[58:17] truth amen and so I'm very very
[58:23] thankful and we always have to be ready
[58:25] for
[58:26] correction not that I'm going to bring
[58:29] correction tonight but God gives grace
[58:33] to the
[58:34] humble God gives grace to the humble and
[58:37] the humble have to die every day because
[58:40] we're in a great battle and Satan is
[58:43] constantly attacking us am as we heard
[58:47] this morning where he ended based upon
[58:49] what we
[58:50] were versus to what we
[58:53] are and so we're very thankful
[58:56] and so tonight I I'm going to speak on
[58:58] the subject of what manner of love is
[59:02] this and it's found in 1 John 3:1 but
[59:06] I'm not going to go there to start with
[59:09] okay and so let's just pray and then
[59:12] I'll let you be seated and we can start
[59:15] in on the
[59:17] message Heavenly
[59:20] Father
[59:21] truly we're
[59:23] amazed it's remarkable
[59:26] how can we get over this knowing what we
[59:30] once
[59:31] were and what you have made us by the
[59:35] gospel of the evening lightl we are
[59:38] privileged Lord to
[59:41] see not just the Perfection of the blood
[59:45] but the Perfection of the life of Jesus
[59:47] Christ in the church through the blood
[59:51] and it's all to your honor and to your
[59:54] glory we're so thankful father and we
[59:57] pray now tonight that you'll Bless the
[59:59] people you'll anchor the faith of Jesus
[1:00:02] Christ in them that they may know how to
[1:00:05] walk in the light and prepare for your
[1:00:07] coming in Jesus name amen you may be
[1:00:13] seated me set my timer on here
[1:00:30] okay and so we're going to go to First
[1:00:33] John
[1:00:34] 31 where we'll find my main text but not
[1:00:37] right now and before they go there I
[1:00:40] would like to quote from three different
[1:00:43] prophets Daniel Peter and Elijah how
[1:00:48] many knows who Elijah is amen and the
[1:00:52] reason is is because if I go straight to
[1:00:55] First John 3:1 it's going to pull me
[1:00:58] into an Evangelistic message that's a
[1:01:01] great Evangelistic uh verse of scripture
[1:01:05] and and I pray we'll end up there with
[1:01:07] the help of the Holy
[1:01:08] Spirit um but I W to I want to quote
[1:01:12] from these three prophets so that we
[1:01:14] have a common ground or a common
[1:01:17] understanding I want to remind us of
[1:01:20] what the scripture says about a certain
[1:01:23] subject which is one of the greatest and
[1:01:26] most important messages brother Bram
[1:01:28] told us which is the second coming of
[1:01:31] the Lord Jesus Christ okay and so for we
[1:01:35] know at the second coming we will
[1:01:38] receive the crown of immortal
[1:01:41] life and that's to all those that love
[1:01:45] his
[1:01:47] appearing how many loves his
[1:01:50] appearing that's to those that love is
[1:01:52] appearing now that word appearing and
[1:01:54] coming is separate but but there's
[1:01:56] places where appearing used
[1:01:58] interchangeably and this appearing here
[1:02:00] is his coming and so you have to love
[1:02:04] his second
[1:02:05] coming and my question is how can you
[1:02:08] love his second coming and not love the
[1:02:11] truth that reveals his second
[1:02:14] coming and so when I was in maloi last
[1:02:18] December about a year ago I asked the
[1:02:21] congregation how many love the Lord
[1:02:24] Jesus everybody lifts their hand they
[1:02:26] love the Lord Jesus and I says yes
[1:02:30] everybody loves the Lord Jesus until he
[1:02:33] starts to reveal himself as the
[1:02:37] truth okay so the Lutheran love the
[1:02:41] message of
[1:02:43] justification and the light of
[1:02:45] justification but when Wesley came with
[1:02:48] more light and more
[1:02:49] truth there was Lutheran that didn't
[1:02:52] love the Methodist message so they
[1:02:54] didn't love Jesus did they because if
[1:02:57] they would have loved Jesus they would
[1:02:59] have loved the light of
[1:03:02] sanctification and then when the
[1:03:04] Pentecostal came ausa Street restoration
[1:03:06] of the gifts the complete New
[1:03:09] Birth the methodists that led Jesus for
[1:03:12] sanctification they didn't love him
[1:03:14] anymore they didn't want to move up into
[1:03:16] the
[1:03:17] light of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:20] you follow me and so if we love Jesus as
[1:03:24] he revealed himself the truth we love
[1:03:28] that truth we Embrace that truth and we
[1:03:31] want to walk in the light of the
[1:03:34] truth and so when it came to the evening
[1:03:38] light the Pentecostals love the
[1:03:40] Pentecostal message but when it came to
[1:03:42] the evening light which is the morning
[1:03:46] star and he started to
[1:03:49] introduce
[1:03:51] adoption that were born
[1:03:54] children but we have to be child trained
[1:03:58] we have to be disciplined we have to be
[1:04:00] corrected we have to grow up unto an
[1:04:04] adult to become an adoped son and
[1:04:07] daughter God and so when he begin to
[1:04:10] bring that Pentecost didn't love that
[1:04:14] truth they didn't line up with it they
[1:04:17] rejected
[1:04:18] it and when they rejected that they
[1:04:21] rejected the light that would have
[1:04:23] revealed Christ in them from further
[1:04:26] than ever
[1:04:27] befor and so when it came to the evening
[1:04:31] light or the Morning Star here we are
[1:04:34] now and there's many people that have
[1:04:37] moved into the light of the evening
[1:04:40] light and we love that but what is this
[1:04:43] light introducing this light is
[1:04:46] introducing the coming of the son of
[1:04:49] righteousness this light is introducing
[1:04:52] the light of the perfect day back to
[1:04:56] where the bride becomes the spoken word
[1:04:59] created seed and the beginning of the
[1:05:02] creation becomes the finish of the
[1:05:04] creation in The Bride of Jesus Christ so
[1:05:08] that's that final step and so that step
[1:05:13] of the Morning Star introducing the son
[1:05:15] of
[1:05:16] righteousness that's where we've come
[1:05:18] out of Egypt we've been called out into
[1:05:21] the Third Exodus but that's where now we
[1:05:24] are warned by Paul Paul in the book of
[1:05:27] Hebrews we shall be made partakers of
[1:05:31] Christ if we hold the beginning of our
[1:05:34] confidence or faith steadfast
[1:05:38] unto the
[1:05:40] end and so this message you can't come
[1:05:45] part
[1:05:46] way the the bride she can't come part
[1:05:49] way she has to walk in the complete
[1:05:53] light until she enters the perfect day
[1:05:56] and once she has Christ in her the Holy
[1:06:00] Ghost he will reveal that light step by
[1:06:04] step and step by step our life will
[1:06:07] reflect the life of Jesus Christ we'll
[1:06:10] become more and more Christlike until
[1:06:14] Revelations 1 when he turned to see the
[1:06:16] bride of Christ which that was Christ in
[1:06:18] the bride was it not he said I saw one
[1:06:23] like the son of man he didn't see the
[1:06:26] son of man he saw one like the son of
[1:06:31] man and so may we have that Christlike
[1:06:36] life
[1:06:47] okay and so now let me um let me go to
[1:06:51] the first scripture which is Daniel
[1:06:54] chapter 2 and verse 34 and this is this
[1:06:57] is the common ground that I want to take
[1:07:00] a few
[1:07:01] moments and review it and bring it to
[1:07:04] our remembrance and may God illuminate
[1:07:07] it greater than ever before because
[1:07:10] these scriptures pertain to the second
[1:07:14] coming and there's nothing greater than
[1:07:17] to step into the light of the perfect
[1:07:20] day the son of righteousness which
[1:07:22] brother brandham tells
[1:07:24] us it's it's not just the physical
[1:07:26] healing it's the changing of the
[1:07:28] creature from Mortal to immortality and
[1:07:31] Corruption to incorruption and this is
[1:07:34] the only age that lives to see that
[1:07:38] promise and that's what I live
[1:07:41] for that's what I live for so I'm going
[1:07:44] to read you from uh the first Prophet
[1:07:47] Daniel and
[1:07:49] 234 he says Thou sawest till a stone was
[1:07:53] cut without hands which the image upon
[1:07:57] his feet that were of iron and clay and
[1:08:00] break them into
[1:08:02] pieces So Daniel sees a smiting Stone
[1:08:07] and then in Daniel 2 and verse 44 he
[1:08:10] interprets what he saw so we don't have
[1:08:14] to wonder okay he's going to interpret
[1:08:17] it for us and he says in the days of
[1:08:21] these
[1:08:22] Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a
[1:08:26] kingdom which shall never be
[1:08:30] destroyed and the kingdom shall not be
[1:08:33] left to other people but it shall break
[1:08:36] there's the there's the smiting it shall
[1:08:38] break in pieces and consume all the
[1:08:41] kingdoms and it shall stand
[1:08:45] forever and so right here Daniel is
[1:08:49] telling us that this stone is a
[1:08:53] kingdom this stone is a Kingdom and
[1:08:56] Jesus said if I cast out Devils by the
[1:09:01] Holy Ghost then the kingdom of God is
[1:09:05] come nigh unto
[1:09:07] you and so there was the kingdom of God
[1:09:11] in the fullness of the Holy Ghost In A
[1:09:13] Man Called Jesus revealed as the son of
[1:09:17] man
[1:09:18] amen
[1:09:21] amen and and so and so there was the
[1:09:25] Stone Kingdom in the form of the son of
[1:09:28] man and at
[1:09:30] Calvary Israel rejected that stone they
[1:09:33] smote that
[1:09:36] rock in order to fulfill the
[1:09:39] prophecy that the stone that the
[1:09:42] builders rejected would be made the head
[1:09:46] of the Gentile bride
[1:09:49] hallelujah
[1:09:53] amen and Jesus said
[1:09:55] this is marvelous in our eyes something
[1:10:00] marvelous is a great Wonder of all
[1:10:03] wonders and truly this is a great wonder
[1:10:07] that the stone came in the power of
[1:10:09] redeeming love at his first coming to
[1:10:13] make a way for it to come in perfect
[1:10:15] love at his second coming
[1:10:18] amen that's marvelous in our eyes and so
[1:10:23] Daniel he sees the second coming of The
[1:10:26] Headstone to the Gentile bride it came
[1:10:29] first to Israel as the Capstone of
[1:10:32] redeeming
[1:10:35] love to die for my blood my
[1:10:38] cross for his Gentile bride so he could
[1:10:42] come to her in the second coming as the
[1:10:46] Capstone of perfect love
[1:10:56] and so
[1:10:58] Daniel he sees the Capstone
[1:11:02] kingdom is that what the stone is it's
[1:11:05] the Capstone Kingdom of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:09] in the fullness of its
[1:11:13] power so Daniel he sees it coming as a
[1:11:17] smiting Stone and then as we go to Peter
[1:11:22] we're going to see Peter sees the same
[1:11:24] thing but he sees it as a love
[1:11:29] Stone Daniel saw it as a smiting Stone
[1:11:33] to those who rejected it but D but Peter
[1:11:36] sees it coming as
[1:11:38] a stone of Love A Love Stone to the
[1:11:42] Bride of Jesus Christ and that's in
[1:11:44] second Peter chapter 1 and verse 10
[1:11:58] are you with me we're contrasting what
[1:12:01] what Daniel saw and what Peter
[1:12:04] saw and he says here Peter wherefore the
[1:12:08] rather Brethren give diligence to make
[1:12:11] your calling and election sure for if
[1:12:15] you do these things you shall never
[1:12:19] fall for so an entrance shall be
[1:12:22] ministered unto you abundantly
[1:12:26] into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord
[1:12:30] and Savior Jesus Christ he sees the same
[1:12:35] Stone coming as the Capstone of perfect
[1:12:39] love to the Bride of Jesus
[1:12:42] Christ and he says yes I think it meat
[1:12:47] it's
[1:12:50] right and he says to put you always in
[1:12:54] remembrance of these things though you
[1:12:57] know
[1:12:58] them and that's what we're doing is just
[1:13:01] a few moments to remind you of things
[1:13:04] though you know them because the Bible
[1:13:07] says let us give the earnest heed to the
[1:13:10] things that have been spoken lest we let
[1:13:13] them
[1:13:16] slip so he says wherefore I would not be
[1:13:19] negligent to put you always in
[1:13:21] remembrance of those things though you
[1:13:23] know them and be established in the
[1:13:25] present
[1:13:27] truth and so Peter says
[1:13:30] here if you do these things you will
[1:13:33] never fall and an entrance shall be
[1:13:36] administered to you into the kingdom of
[1:13:41] God and so if these things be in you
[1:13:45] what things the Seven Virtues the seven
[1:13:49] steps in the
[1:13:51] Pyramid of a sinful man me
[1:13:55] made perfect Hallelujah I'm
[1:13:59] amazed how he loved me I'm amazed how he
[1:14:06] cared by the Precious Blood of his
[1:14:10] redeeming
[1:14:12] love me a sinful man have been made
[1:14:17] perfect in his
[1:14:20] sight that's amazing Hallelujah that's
[1:14:23] an amazing thing and so what this
[1:14:26] scripture is telling us is that this
[1:14:29] entrance that's ministered into the
[1:14:31] stone kingdom is at the top of the
[1:14:37] pyramid and brother brandom speaks much
[1:14:41] about that throughout his
[1:14:44] messages and so seven steps that grow
[1:14:49] you up to the
[1:14:51] top and how do you come to the top
[1:14:53] through the harder way
[1:14:56] the way of hard trials it's the
[1:14:58] character test you're being tested
[1:15:01] you're being opposed to leave the
[1:15:04] promise but if God has put it in your
[1:15:07] heart if you've been born of his love
[1:15:10] you're going to grow in his love and
[1:15:12] you're going to be capped off in his
[1:15:15] love and the Seven Virtues is the love
[1:15:18] of God in your life it's your cross
[1:15:21] daily dying daily so you can reflect
[1:15:25] Christ and his love through your his
[1:15:28] virtue his knowledge his Temperance to
[1:15:30] the to those who need
[1:15:32] it
[1:15:35] yes seven steps until you get to the top
[1:15:39] to be capped off in perfect love now
[1:15:42] this is me this is my hope okay this is
[1:15:45] my hope to be capped off in perfect love
[1:15:48] what for the tremendous victory in the
[1:15:52] love
[1:15:53] divine the tremendous victory in the
[1:15:56] love divine what makes it tremendous
[1:15:59] it's the victory of all victories it's
[1:16:02] the total Deliverance it's the Glorious
[1:16:05] Liberty of the manifested sons of God
[1:16:08] Amen there's no more battling old age
[1:16:11] there's no more battling the mind of
[1:16:13] what we was we will be completely
[1:16:16] changed and Satan will be sealed out
[1:16:21] am and that's what I live for
[1:16:25] so now let's look at what Elijah said do
[1:16:29] you have that
[1:16:30] picture okay I have just one
[1:16:33] slide okay and I'm and I I relabeled
[1:16:37] that because I I don't want to confuse
[1:16:40] you but these two pictures brother
[1:16:42] brandom spoke about them they're on
[1:16:45] tape they're absolutely on tape many
[1:16:49] places on tape but if I had to relabel
[1:16:52] that picture I would call it Elijah's
[1:16:56] pyramid
[1:16:58] message anybody ever hear Brother Bown
[1:17:01] use the term pyramid
[1:17:04] message okay so if you
[1:17:06] haven't I'm just here like Phillip I'm
[1:17:11] just here to call these things to your
[1:17:14] attention like brother Ferguson preached
[1:17:17] you have to have the desire I want to be
[1:17:21] the Bride of Jesus Christ there's
[1:17:23] nothing great
[1:17:25] there's no greater thing in my life to
[1:17:28] be transformed into the image of the
[1:17:30] stature of the perfect man than I may be
[1:17:33] the Bride of Jesus
[1:17:40] Christ and so let's see what Elijah
[1:17:43] says about these things
[1:17:58] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:18:00] light he says Luther's Mana was the
[1:18:03] message of
[1:18:04] justification Wesley's message was the
[1:18:06] manifestation of sanctification
[1:18:09] Pentecost was the restoration of the
[1:18:11] gifts but this is
[1:18:14] introducing The
[1:18:19] Headstone the last day the brid tree
[1:18:22] which is contrary to all and and yet
[1:18:25] it's the same light for the
[1:18:27] matured see the light has gotten greater
[1:18:30] and greater and the Bride of Jesus
[1:18:32] Christ is becoming more like him more
[1:18:34] like him until she'll be like
[1:18:37] Revelations 1 one like the son of
[1:18:47] man so mark that in your heart this is
[1:18:51] introducing the headstone
[1:18:54] and so what kind of Mana are we feeding
[1:18:56] on Capstone
[1:18:59] Mana where did the Seven Seals come out
[1:19:01] of the
[1:19:03] Capstone are you with me and so this is
[1:19:07] Capstone Mana this is Rich food but this
[1:19:10] is bride
[1:19:11] food and she loves
[1:19:15] it and now from dedication
[1:19:22] 1962 at UDA brother brand went to
[1:19:25] dedicate a church there at UDA UDA for
[1:19:28] brother Hoover and he says now we
[1:19:31] already have the stones the stones that
[1:19:34] God for ordained see and we've got them
[1:19:37] all the way from Ephesus to leoda may I
[1:19:40] have that
[1:19:45] picture okay so you can see when it
[1:19:49] comes to the collective body of Jesus
[1:19:51] Christ we're at the top of the pyramid
[1:19:53] as far as the ages go
[1:19:55] but the individual in this age you also
[1:19:59] have to walk all seven steps in the
[1:20:02] light by the trial of your faith and
[1:20:05] that's the harder
[1:20:06] way that's where you meet the opposition
[1:20:10] to the promise do you want to turn
[1:20:13] back because it's painful in the body
[1:20:17] it's painful in the mind there's all
[1:20:19] kinds of Mind battles there's all kinds
[1:20:21] of heartaches you lose a loved one
[1:20:25] somebody does you wrong and maybe they
[1:20:27] didn't even mean to all these things is
[1:20:29] the harder way but it's God's way
[1:20:32] because he molds the Seven Virtues in
[1:20:36] your life
[1:20:41] Hallelujah we've got them all the way
[1:20:43] from Ephesus to leoda and so do we God's
[1:20:47] Prophet Elijah with the pyramid message
[1:20:50] has told us what they are virtue Faith
[1:20:53] virtue knowledge
[1:20:55] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:21:00] kindness bringing you up to the seventh
[1:21:04] step so you're ready for the
[1:21:07] stone
[1:21:09] Kingdom so he says we're only wait he
[1:21:13] says we got all the way from Ephesus to
[1:21:15] Lea we're only waiting for that
[1:21:18] headstone that the builders rejected
[1:21:20] waiting for his coming the capping Stone
[1:21:25] now that that's not
[1:21:27] me this can't be added to it can't be
[1:21:31] taken from it doesn't need our
[1:21:33] interpretations but one thing it does
[1:21:35] need is the revelation of the holy
[1:21:38] spirit in our
[1:21:40] lives and so now you know brother George
[1:21:43] he picks on us he says I want some amens
[1:21:47] I want some Hallelujah now he's way in
[1:21:49] the back back there today
[1:21:55] he's
[1:22:00] resting but I appreciate him and I
[1:22:03] appreciate brother
[1:22:05] durksen it's an it's an honor to to be
[1:22:08] here and minister with men of this
[1:22:12] caliber and so we have the stones we
[1:22:15] know what they
[1:22:17] are we're waiting for the coming the
[1:22:20] Capstone now that was
[1:22:22] 62 in 6 5 127 leadership the last
[1:22:29] complete message brother brandham ever
[1:22:31] preached was leadership how many can say
[1:22:35] Amen to
[1:22:36] that that's the last complete message he
[1:22:38] ever preached and he says this we've
[1:22:41] turned a corner we're looking towards
[1:22:45] heaven watching for the coming the cap
[1:22:48] on the pyramid as we would say his
[1:22:52] coming back The Church Must Be be
[1:22:54] resurrected soon and we must get
[1:23:00] ready okay and so you know here's where
[1:23:04] I wrestled Within Myself you know do I
[1:23:06] drop this in here or don't I but I'm
[1:23:08] going to drop it in here okay we can say
[1:23:12] but in
[1:23:13] 1963 at sunset Mountain brother Brandon
[1:23:16] was lifted up to fulfill the prophecy
[1:23:19] behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone
[1:23:26] and
[1:23:29] so that happened in
[1:23:32] 1963 can we say amen that's exactly what
[1:23:35] happened in 1963 he asked he was
[1:23:38] remember he was in that room locked and
[1:23:40] he said what Lord what does this mean
[1:23:43] and there he was in the corner and the
[1:23:45] book was open to Romans to that very
[1:23:51] scripture and so the question is brother
[1:23:55] lingar the stone has already
[1:23:58] appeared I say
[1:24:00] Amen but we have to differentiate the
[1:24:04] appearing of Christ and the coming of
[1:24:08] Christ the appearing of Christ and the
[1:24:12] coming of Christ brother brandham made
[1:24:14] that distinction so let me give you this
[1:24:17] illustration What happens if you don't
[1:24:20] get these separated or rightly divide
[1:24:23] them for the scripture and the message
[1:24:27] so here is the appearing brother randam
[1:24:31] lifted up he was capped
[1:24:33] off okay and what and what did he do
[1:24:36] what did he unveil when he came back he
[1:24:38] broke the Seven Seals and then preached
[1:24:41] the message of the token and he said no
[1:24:44] other time could the token come and I'm
[1:24:46] thinking to myself what we've had the
[1:24:48] Holy Ghost through seven Church ages but
[1:24:51] no other time did the Holy Ghost come in
[1:24:53] the full stature of the Holy Ghost all
[1:24:57] the way from the feet up to the
[1:25:04] head and so it
[1:25:07] appeared appeared so the bride had the
[1:25:12] revelation of what she's to be and how
[1:25:15] to prepare and so here's the coming and
[1:25:19] when the Capstone comes the whole body
[1:25:21] of Christ is going to unite with it all
[1:25:24] right so now watch what happens when you
[1:25:27] mix up the appearing of Christ and the
[1:25:31] coming of
[1:25:38] Christ this is very
[1:25:41] serious this is very serious because
[1:25:44] when you do this you put things in the
[1:25:47] message you mix up their place on where
[1:25:50] they
[1:25:51] go okay this makes me and you vulnerable
[1:25:56] to
[1:25:58] iniquity iniquity yes three things he
[1:26:02] told us we must not do yes sir
[1:26:07] misinterpret sir
[1:26:09] mislocate and
[1:26:12] dislocate and then he also said there's
[1:26:14] five things you must do and he told us
[1:26:19] how things have to come through the
[1:26:22] prophet the messenger of the age in his
[1:26:24] his time and his season and has to be
[1:26:26] foretold in the Bible and so when we
[1:26:29] break any of those things either we fail
[1:26:33] to do what we're supposed to do or we
[1:26:35] don't or we do what we're not supposed
[1:26:37] to do we become workers of
[1:26:41] iniquity because we break the word of
[1:26:44] God and so where are we we're in that
[1:26:47] honed age we're in that Capstone age
[1:26:50] where the razor's Edge between truth and
[1:26:53] eror are so close it's very easy to fail
[1:26:58] to rightly divide the
[1:27:02] word and it's a warning to me I have
[1:27:06] shuddered many times as a minister
[1:27:09] preaching this message one word and
[1:27:12] there's where we have to rely upon the
[1:27:14] grace of God and we have to check our
[1:27:17] desires what's my desire My Desire is
[1:27:21] not to be somebody my desire is to be a
[1:27:24] nobody so that I can be somebody in the
[1:27:27] Lord Jesus
[1:27:35] Christ so now in the message look for
[1:27:39] the difference between the appearing of
[1:27:41] The Headstone and the coming of The
[1:27:52] Headstone now let's go
[1:27:56] to the Evangelistic
[1:27:59] portion so to speak of the
[1:28:02] message and I I want to go to Psalms 119
[1:28:06] and verse 18 and then I'll connect it to
[1:28:08] First John 31
[1:28:28] now we we turnning you say well brother
[1:28:30] lingar I have a different view of it God
[1:28:33] bless you I love you if you got a
[1:28:36] different view of it and you can help me
[1:28:40] then show me the Brotherly Love put
[1:28:42] yourself in my place and seek to
[1:28:45] understand how I see what I
[1:28:49] see so that we're not fighting over
[1:28:52] Doctrine but we have the love and the
[1:28:55] fellowship with one another we're trying
[1:28:57] to help one another see more clearly
[1:29:00] like brother uh Paul we saw more clearly
[1:29:04] idolatry brother Ferguson we saw more
[1:29:06] clearly
[1:29:08] Revelation and that we don't and we can
[1:29:10] accept God's offer of Grace but God has
[1:29:13] to accept us and when he accept
[1:29:18] us that's a predestinated gift that
[1:29:21] genan was already there and when the
[1:29:24] revelation of he wants you to see for
[1:29:26] your age when it struck
[1:29:31] you it changed you
[1:29:34] amen you may not look like
[1:29:38] it the woman in the well probably didn't
[1:29:41] look like
[1:29:42] it but there's a diagram that brother
[1:29:45] brandom draws where the priests were
[1:29:48] over here that looked like the light and
[1:29:49] they had all the darkness but she was in
[1:29:52] the darkness and when that light struck
[1:29:54] her and God gave her the
[1:29:57] Revelation this is the Messiah this is
[1:30:00] the Christ
[1:30:03] Hallelujah that's what God
[1:30:06] recognized that's the faith that brings
[1:30:10] his
[1:30:14] righteousness so Psalms
[1:30:16] 119 and verse
[1:30:19] 18 open thou mine
[1:30:22] eyes that I may
[1:30:25] behold wondrous
[1:30:28] things out of the
[1:30:33] law now these two verses of
[1:30:36] scripture that we're coming to this one
[1:30:39] and 1 John
[1:30:41] 31 the theme of the two
[1:30:44] scriptures is
[1:30:46] wondrous
[1:30:48] things and wondrous things are amazing
[1:30:53] things
[1:30:54] they're remarkable things they're things
[1:30:58] that in the sight of man it causes man
[1:31:01] to wonder how could that be okay and
[1:31:05] when we wonder how it could be we can
[1:31:07] seek to understand but when we seek to
[1:31:11] understand we don't want to lean to our
[1:31:13] own understanding if it's God's Wonder
[1:31:16] we want to pray earnestly and sincerely
[1:31:20] Lord help me to understand
[1:31:22] this
[1:31:24] amen and so here's two wondrous things
[1:31:27] in the
[1:31:28] Bible Sarah heard the mystery of God's
[1:31:33] creative
[1:31:35] will her
[1:31:37] change but she questioned it why she
[1:31:42] leaned to her own understanding but
[1:31:44] thank God Abraham's Faith stood in the
[1:31:47] gap for
[1:31:50] Sarah but Mary
[1:31:54] when a creative will came to Mary Mary
[1:31:57] never questioned it did she she asked
[1:31:59] how these things to be she was asking
[1:32:02] for the revelation of it and he told her
[1:32:05] the pillar of fire will overshadow theej
[1:32:08] amen you say the holy ghost that Pillar
[1:32:12] of Fire was there and I believe as soon
[1:32:14] as she said be it unto me according to
[1:32:17] Thy word that Pro pillar fire came right
[1:32:19] down over her just like in the meetings
[1:32:22] brother bandam said the pillar fire went
[1:32:24] down over them the pillar fire went down
[1:32:26] over them
[1:32:29] Hallelujah and
[1:32:36] so God's wondrous things are amazing
[1:32:40] because there is a creative power and a
[1:32:43] creative will behind it and that's what
[1:32:46] makes it so marvelous he can do things
[1:32:49] that no one else can do amen
[1:32:54] and so this word
[1:32:56] behold it means to to
[1:33:01] see and this word behold is the
[1:33:05] connector that connects the theme of the
[1:33:07] two scriptures so Psalms
[1:33:12] behold and then when we go over to John
[1:33:16] we're going to see the same thing it
[1:33:18] starts with behold what manner of love
[1:33:21] so it's the connector but let me just
[1:33:24] finish on Psalms 11918 he says open thou
[1:33:28] my
[1:33:29] eyes thou is the Lord amen Open the Eyes
[1:33:35] of My Heart
[1:33:37] Lord I want to see
[1:33:40] you Open the Eyes of My Heart that I
[1:33:43] might
[1:33:44] behold the creative will of all of the
[1:33:48] wondrous things that you do from Genesis
[1:33:51] to revelation espe ly in my
[1:33:56] age yes
[1:33:59] behold Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord
[1:34:02] that's why the song means so much to me
[1:34:06] and uh was brother George or brother
[1:34:08] Paul that read that that when we're
[1:34:10] worshiping what is it that motivates me
[1:34:12] in worship the re these songs bring
[1:34:15] Revelation to me I'm that he did that
[1:34:19] for me I believe that that's why with
[1:34:21] all of my heart I sing from my
[1:34:26] heart he inhabits the Praises of his
[1:34:31] people like that little Spanish couple
[1:34:34] this morning no great gifts of singing
[1:34:37] but what was great is it was coming from
[1:34:39] their heart and it was a true
[1:34:42] worship
[1:34:44] amenallah and that's what I
[1:34:48] want
[1:34:50] okay so open my heart now now let me say
[1:34:54] this if God opens your eyes he's given
[1:34:58] you that Revelation or he's given you
[1:35:01] the spiritual sight that he reserves for
[1:35:05] his elected because God is only known by
[1:35:09] Revelation amen and that Revelation
[1:35:13] comes to the prophet in order for the
[1:35:16] church to receive
[1:35:18] it and so I'm not going to go into this
[1:35:23] but it's it's a great
[1:35:24] quote and it's on Look Away to Jesus he
[1:35:28] says how can you look for
[1:35:31] pumpkins if you never seen a
[1:35:35] pumpkin how can you look for a pumpkin
[1:35:39] if you've never seen a pumpkin you don't
[1:35:41] know what you're looking
[1:35:44] for and then it dawned on me he said in
[1:35:47] that same message the third pool has
[1:35:50] been Vindicated and you know what to
[1:35:53] look for
[1:35:54] so how do I know what to look for unless
[1:35:58] I have the revelation of what's been
[1:36:01] Vindicated already before the
[1:36:06] bride now I know there's a lot of
[1:36:08] scarecrows around them the term third
[1:36:10] pool you hardly hear it
[1:36:12] anymore but in Simplicity it was the new
[1:36:16] ministry of a prophet and he was given
[1:36:19] the creative spoken word power
[1:36:23] amen
[1:36:27] amen and so I just Dro that in there I
[1:36:30] won't go any further I believe okay
[1:36:35] I did he say
[1:36:38] it and so what am I trying to do I'm
[1:36:40] trying to help
[1:36:43] you and it was so
[1:36:46] simple how do you know to look for a
[1:36:48] pumpkin when you've never seen a pumpkin
[1:36:51] and how do you know what your looking
[1:36:53] for in the third pool when the squeeze
[1:36:56] comes down if you don't have a
[1:36:58] revelation God hasn't showed it to
[1:37:02] you then what'll
[1:37:04] happen it'll happen like when the king's
[1:37:08] servant in the siege of Samaria they
[1:37:12] were so hungry during The Siege they
[1:37:14] were eating one another's children and
[1:37:17] the king of Samaria blamed it on Elisha
[1:37:20] and he was coming for Elisha's head and
[1:37:22] he sent a servant to him and when the
[1:37:25] servant was coming Elisha saw the vision
[1:37:28] and spoke the word of the Lord and said
[1:37:31] tomorrow at this time there'll be flour
[1:37:33] and there'll be barley in other words
[1:37:35] they'll be
[1:37:37] bread and the King's servant said if God
[1:37:40] opens the
[1:37:42] heavens if God opened up the Heavens he
[1:37:46] said it would not be and Elisha said
[1:37:50] you'll see it but you won't taste it it
[1:37:54] how many of us is going to live to see
[1:37:57] the third pool but won't be partakers of
[1:38:00] its
[1:38:03] blessing it's
[1:38:07] sobering and I wouldn't tell you this if
[1:38:09] I wanted to be a popular
[1:38:11] preacher because this subject is not
[1:38:14] popular and Saints put many scarecrows
[1:38:18] around it but forget the scarecrows you
[1:38:21] got the tapes you got the books and if
[1:38:23] you have the Holy Ghost go digging and
[1:38:26] feeding on the Capstone
[1:38:43] Mana that's just like our Prophet huh to
[1:38:47] illustrate his the great ministry with a
[1:38:50] pumpkin hallelujah how how many knows
[1:38:53] what a pumpkin looks like you could find
[1:38:56] one huh praise the
[1:39:01] Lord and so now we
[1:39:03] go to John 1 John chapter 3 the
[1:39:07] connector is behold and behold means we
[1:39:11] want to see something is that right it
[1:39:14] means to see something and when you see
[1:39:17] it then you can look for it and here
[1:39:19] he's saying see what manner of love the
[1:39:23] father has bestowed upon us that
[1:39:29] what me a sinful man born a sinner could
[1:39:35] be made into the stature of a perfect
[1:39:40] man
[1:39:42] amen is there any greater Wonder than
[1:39:45] that I remember when I was 11 years old
[1:39:48] and I was walking through these
[1:39:49] apartments I'm just a boy I don't know
[1:39:52] God I only saw him on the cross when I
[1:39:55] was 5 years old in a Ste movie on Easter
[1:39:59] uh weekend and something touched my
[1:40:02] heart who is this man what is this and
[1:40:05] one day 10 11 years old I'm walking
[1:40:07] along and something says to me the
[1:40:10] greatest thing that could ever happen to
[1:40:12] anyone is going to happen to
[1:40:16] you I did what was it that still Small
[1:40:21] Voice that seed that was was there
[1:40:24] waiting for the time when God would find
[1:40:27] me when the eagle would fly over to me
[1:40:31] and call me out of the filth of the
[1:40:35] Barnyard I was a rock and roll pot smok
[1:40:38] and hippie that's what I was but the
[1:40:41] love of God reached down he called me he
[1:40:45] found
[1:40:47] me and now I'm in the process of being
[1:40:52] the one of it all
[1:41:00] Hallelujah there's three key words here
[1:41:04] behold manner
[1:41:07] bestowed manner means how something
[1:41:11] unfolds so the how the love of God
[1:41:15] unfolds and he says behold to see this
[1:41:20] this is what you want to see is how the
[1:41:22] love of God un folds to see this where's
[1:41:26] brother George he's my Amen Corner he
[1:41:29] has to bestow it upon you and bestow
[1:41:33] means to give it as a present give it as
[1:41:36] a gift Hallelujah he has to bestow upon
[1:41:40] you and me the spiritual sight to see
[1:41:43] the great mystery of his love unfolding
[1:41:47] down to this day
[1:42:00] and
[1:42:03] so what made us what made us sinful
[1:42:07] people perfect in his sight by his blood
[1:42:11] you believe that that's my focus that's
[1:42:15] where I want to go out of here that's
[1:42:17] where the messages has helped me okay
[1:42:19] what did that it was God's manner of
[1:42:23] love and so that's the question what
[1:42:26] manner of love is this and the answer to
[1:42:29] this question God's manner of love how
[1:42:32] God unfolds his love divine love the
[1:42:35] answer to that question is The Wonder of
[1:42:38] all the wonders of
[1:42:40] God hallelujah it's the mystery of his
[1:42:44] will it's the great secret that when the
[1:42:47] Angels were created he kept something in
[1:42:50] his bosom he kept the secret in his
[1:42:52] bosom how that this great person of
[1:42:55] divine love would unfold himself through
[1:42:58] redeeming love down to the perfect love
[1:43:01] in the Church of Jesus
[1:43:03] [Music]
[1:43:14] Christ what manner of love is
[1:43:16] this we're coming to
[1:43:19] it it's the Wonder of all his wonders
[1:43:22] it's the great secret of all his
[1:43:26] Secrets the Capstone coming of perfect
[1:43:29] love is the seven seal secret it's the
[1:43:32] great secret of the seven
[1:43:35] Secrets it's the great message of the
[1:43:38] seven
[1:43:39] messages and the seventh
[1:43:42] angel is the great messenger of all
[1:43:45] seven hallu I can let him tell you that
[1:43:49] I heard him say
[1:43:51] thatu I'm just
[1:43:53] saying what he said and remind me to
[1:43:57] come back to that okay because the way
[1:44:00] he says it is
[1:44:03] amazing and so what manner of love is
[1:44:06] this when we find the answer of how
[1:44:09] God's love unfolds to us it's The Wonder
[1:44:12] of it
[1:44:13] all because it makes us in the stature
[1:44:16] of a perfect man can you put the other
[1:44:18] picture up
[1:44:28] and so the Wonder of it all let me give
[1:44:29] you an
[1:44:30] example there are seven wonders of the
[1:44:33] ancient
[1:44:35] world seven wonders of the ancient world
[1:44:39] and one of those seven wonders is The
[1:44:42] Wonder of it
[1:44:45] all there was the Hanging Gardens in in
[1:44:48] Babylon there was the uh great
[1:44:51] lighthouse in Alexandri Egypt a
[1:44:54] Monumental work there was the great
[1:44:56] Colossus in roads okay all these great
[1:45:00] works that's a sample of some of the
[1:45:02] great wonders but the greatest Wonder of
[1:45:05] all seven
[1:45:06] wonders is Enoch's Great
[1:45:11] Pyramid it's Enoch's Great
[1:45:14] Pyramid it's a Bible in White
[1:45:18] Stone you say brother lingar I've never
[1:45:20] I've looked at the picture I don't see a
[1:45:22] white stone that's because they stole
[1:45:24] its casings but originally that was a
[1:45:28] pyramid of white stone that glistened in
[1:45:32] the sun amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:45:37] and so you can look it up all right it's
[1:45:40] a Bible in White Stone a pyramid of
[1:45:42] white
[1:45:48] stone that many don't know but in that
[1:45:52] white
[1:45:54] Stone there's a hidden
[1:45:56] message it's a
[1:45:58] Bible there's a hidden message and
[1:46:02] brother Branham told us what that
[1:46:04] message
[1:46:05] was in his pyramid
[1:46:08] message and now it's The Wonder of all
[1:46:11] seven wonders because all the six
[1:46:15] wonders were built by man all the six
[1:46:19] wonders were built by man
[1:46:23] and they've all decayed or have been
[1:46:26] destroyed by earthquakes that's the
[1:46:28] works of man because the works of man
[1:46:31] are to glorify man and to exalt the
[1:46:34] capabilities of
[1:46:36] man but the Great Pyramid wasn't built
[1:46:39] by a man Hallelujah it was built by the
[1:46:42] holy ghost in the prophet who had the
[1:46:45] Divine architect and the divine
[1:46:50] plan and it was built with a mystery not
[1:46:54] to glorify man but to glorify Jesus
[1:46:58] Christ The Headstone in man in the
[1:47:01] church
[1:47:02] amen God glorify and in
[1:47:05] you Paul said they glorified God in
[1:47:10] Me did they worship Paul no they were
[1:47:15] grateful for the revelation of Jesus
[1:47:19] Christ which is God in his church that
[1:47:22] came through through
[1:47:24] Paul that's what they were grateful for
[1:47:27] and so we're living in that age of the
[1:47:28] razor's Edge on the right and on the
[1:47:31] left but in the middle in the middle is
[1:47:34] the Revelation that we're not putting
[1:47:36] brother brandham above Jesus Christ but
[1:47:38] we see the revelation of Christ in man
[1:47:42] in the Perfection of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:45] God's witness of the token which could
[1:47:47] only come in the evening
[1:47:51] time yes sir Hallelujah I'm
[1:47:54] thankful I'm very thankful
[1:48:01] amen so of the Seven Wonders the Great
[1:48:05] Pyramid is The Wonder of
[1:48:08] all and no
[1:48:10] wonder it's
[1:48:13] foreshadowing Elijah's
[1:48:15] message of the pyramid message that
[1:48:18] foreshadowed it it's it's foreshadowing
[1:48:22] it and and Enoch was the seventh from
[1:48:24] Adam Elijah is the seventh from the
[1:48:27] second Adam Hallelujah and Enoch took
[1:48:31] the Rapture and Elijah is trying to give
[1:48:34] us the Revelation that when we come into
[1:48:37] this image that's the individual that's
[1:48:39] going in the
[1:48:43] Rapture so it's a very important
[1:48:51] Revelation and so now we know Enoch
[1:48:53] built it it's a Bible of stone it has a
[1:48:57] symbolizes a hidden message it relates
[1:49:00] to the
[1:49:01] Rapture and so on the
[1:49:04] outside you can see that it has no
[1:49:09] Capstone you can see that just like you
[1:49:11] can read the Bible and see Jesus was
[1:49:13] rejected at his first
[1:49:16] coming but the mystery of his second
[1:49:19] coming The Mystery of the Capstone
[1:49:21] coming is inside the pyramid inside that
[1:49:26] white
[1:49:27] stone for when you go in there you see
[1:49:32] that there are seven steps up to the top
[1:49:35] of the pyramid and in the seven steps up
[1:49:38] to the top of the pyramid you come to
[1:49:42] the prophet's
[1:49:45] chamber and the prophet's chamber is on
[1:49:48] the 50th layer of Masonry
[1:49:52] these are just facts okay the prophet's
[1:49:55] chamber is on the 50th layer so you go
[1:49:58] up seven steps you go up the Seven
[1:50:01] Virtues you come to the top amen of the
[1:50:04] 50th and so we see then here again that
[1:50:08] the pyramid message of Elijah is the
[1:50:11] greatest message of them all every age
[1:50:14] had a jubilee 50 is the number of
[1:50:17] Jubilee every age had a jubilee but when
[1:50:20] we are capped off it's the Jubilee of
[1:50:22] all
[1:50:25] jubilees because it's our final
[1:50:27] Deliverance it's our final release from
[1:50:30] the Mind battles from the corruption of
[1:50:32] the flesh it's the release of it all to
[1:50:36] me it's the tremendous
[1:50:39] victory in the love
[1:50:50] divine and so on the out outside you can
[1:50:54] see the Capstone has none it was
[1:50:57] rejected at its first coming but the
[1:51:00] mystery of how it comes the second time
[1:51:04] is inside the pyramid and the Mystery of
[1:51:08] how he comes a second time is in the
[1:51:10] Bible but it took Elijah the prophet the
[1:51:13] seven seal Messenger to bring out the
[1:51:16] stature of a perfect man
[1:51:32] and so we
[1:51:34] have The Wonder of it
[1:51:38] all Enoch's
[1:51:40] pyramid and The Wonder of it all the
[1:51:44] stature of a perfect
[1:51:48] man can you say amen amen just so I know
[1:51:51] you're with me amen
[1:51:53] it's The Wonder of it
[1:51:54] all and so now the question I want to
[1:51:57] come to and this is where I have taken
[1:52:01] an Evangelistic message is the question
[1:52:04] is what what manner of love is this in
[1:52:08] other words how did this love
[1:52:12] unfold how did this love unfold in order
[1:52:16] to make us The Offspring of a perfect
[1:52:20] life that's his children
[1:52:23] he's perfect they're
[1:52:26] perfect how did this love
[1:52:29] unfold so that he
[1:52:31] could make us perfect in his sight and
[1:52:35] we find that in Ephesians
[1:52:38] 1:3 Paul gives us the answer
[1:52:58] so the question is what manner of love
[1:53:00] is this how is this love unfolding to
[1:53:03] give us
[1:53:05] Perfection okay and he tells us here
[1:53:09] that God's love unfolds in three
[1:53:12] different
[1:53:13] forms and brother brandham repeated over
[1:53:16] and over God unfolds himself in threes
[1:53:20] okay three Bibles the Zodiac the Bible
[1:53:24] of stone and the written word but
[1:53:27] there's only one Bible there's only one
[1:53:30] Revelation and all three Bibles have to
[1:53:33] testify of the first and the second
[1:53:35] coming and they
[1:53:38] do and so there's one person of divine
[1:53:42] love that's almighty God he's eternal
[1:53:46] life and that eternal life has a
[1:53:49] personality if you would sum up the
[1:53:52] personal ity of almighty God it is
[1:53:54] divine
[1:53:57] love and so that's what motivates him
[1:54:00] and so it was his Divine love that
[1:54:03] within his mind he formulated the
[1:54:06] counsel after his will how he would
[1:54:09] Express himself and that's the secret he
[1:54:15] kept and So Divine love unfolded in
[1:54:18] three
[1:54:21] forms and with me this is my terminology
[1:54:25] the first form was agapo love the second
[1:54:29] form was redeeming love the third form
[1:54:32] is perfect love okay so watch what Paul
[1:54:37] says here blessed be the god stop right
[1:54:40] there there's where he created the
[1:54:42] angels and there's where he had the
[1:54:44] great Secret in his
[1:54:46] mind blessed be the God and Father
[1:54:52] of our Lord Jesus Christ so there's the
[1:54:55] father there is the son who has blessed
[1:54:58] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:55:01] Heavenly places in Christ so the father
[1:55:04] and the son blessed us in the Holy Ghost
[1:55:07] in Heavenly places in Christ amen amen
[1:55:10] can you say amen amen that's what he did
[1:55:14] and he said he did this according as he
[1:55:17] has chosen Us in him before the
[1:55:20] foundation of the world that we should
[1:55:22] be holy Without Blame before him in love
[1:55:26] so when he chose us to when he when he
[1:55:30] decided to express himself as Father and
[1:55:34] Son and Holy Ghost he did it so that he
[1:55:39] could bring us before him po blameless
[1:55:43] spotless in perfect
[1:55:46] love plug in perfect love right there
[1:55:49] and then go down to the rest of the
[1:55:51] Scripture it ties in with adoption it
[1:55:53] ties in with the mystery of his
[1:55:56] will and so through Father Son and Holy
[1:55:59] Ghost we find out that the father what
[1:56:02] is he agapo
[1:56:04] love and the
[1:56:06] son Jesus Christ what was he redeeming
[1:56:10] love and in the bride what is he perfect
[1:56:14] love not three persons one person
[1:56:18] condenscending down to make himself
[1:56:21] known in his children and in his
[1:56:25] bride so what's the difference between
[1:56:28] agapo love and redeeming love what's the
[1:56:31] difference between redeeming love and
[1:56:33] perfect
[1:56:34] love agapo love could not
[1:56:39] die MDC could not
[1:56:43] die
[1:56:45] MDC was and is agapo
[1:56:49] love he could not die
[1:56:52] so he had to change his form and take on
[1:56:56] the form of son son of man so that the
[1:57:00] Holy Ghost had blood that he could die
[1:57:05] hallu and that was redeeming love so
[1:57:08] redeeming love was the perfect life of
[1:57:11] God in the perfect blood to become the
[1:57:14] perfect sacrifice Hallelujah so that by
[1:57:17] the grace of the Cross am through his
[1:57:20] blood and his life we could come back to
[1:57:25] the stature of a perfect man in perfect
[1:57:36] love are you with
[1:57:42] me AG go of Love could not die The
[1:57:46] Living Word cannot die but the Living
[1:57:50] Word was made flesh to become for me how
[1:57:54] about you the bleeding
[1:57:57] word The Living Word became the bleeding
[1:58:01] word and that's why when Paul met him on
[1:58:03] the road to Damascus he said who are you
[1:58:07] that Pillar of Fire that Living Word had
[1:58:10] become Jesus the living bleeding word
[1:58:14] amen now that Pillar of Fire was the
[1:58:17] light of the
[1:58:19] lamb praise the Lord
[1:58:22] praise the Lord and when that light of
[1:58:24] the Lamb strikes you what happens it
[1:58:26] applies the blood to you if you walk in
[1:58:29] the light as he's in the light then the
[1:58:31] blood of Jesus Christ will cleanse you
[1:58:33] from all
[1:58:35] sin that's why we love the light that's
[1:58:38] why no matter how bright the light gets
[1:58:40] and the bright of and the light of his
[1:58:42] second coming there's no brighter light
[1:58:44] than
[1:58:45] that but I want it it's my
[1:58:50] perfection and so
[1:58:54] he became
[1:58:56] me that I might become
[1:59:00] him he The Living Word became me the
[1:59:06] bleeding
[1:59:07] word to take my sin upon him to take the
[1:59:11] curse of the law on him by Grace amen
[1:59:16] that I might become the living word amen
[1:59:20] hallelujah become him The Living Word
[1:59:24] the holy ghost in the fullness of the
[1:59:26] stature of the perfect
[1:59:29] [Music]
[1:59:32] man and my Joshua I don't know about
[1:59:35] your
[1:59:37] Joshua I like the way brother George you
[1:59:40] know he he likes to challenge you and
[1:59:41] that I'm borrowing some of his ways so
[1:59:44] you got to forgive me you know my Joshua
[1:59:48] which brother Ram said was the end time
[1:59:49] leader yes
[1:59:52] and you say well brother R also said is
[1:59:53] a holy ghost so everybody have a holy
[1:59:55] ghost are they a messenger to the
[1:59:59] age so I'm just you know just balancing
[2:00:03] it
[2:00:04] up my Joshua left his body and went
[2:00:08] beyond the curtain of time went into the
[2:00:10] glory
[2:00:12] land
[2:00:14] amen and he saw all the saints robed in
[2:00:20] white and then the voice said to him
[2:00:24] this is what you preached this is the
[2:00:28] Holy Ghost this is divine
[2:00:38] love he The Living Word became me the
[2:00:43] bleeding word that I might by his blood
[2:00:46] in his life become him the Living Word
[2:00:49] and brother random saw the bride oh over
[2:00:52] there Snow White in the campstone of
[2:00:56] perfect
[2:01:00] love now tie that to the prophecy a huge
[2:01:04] portion of Heaven awaits
[2:01:08] thee sir okay I'll stop
[2:01:13] there so we
[2:01:16] see we see that God's manner of
[2:01:20] love is aapo love
[2:01:24] MDC could not die can you say Amen but
[2:01:29] he had a plan just think of how great
[2:01:31] his plan is why did he choose to suffer
[2:01:35] why did he choose the agony why did he
[2:01:38] choose the pain why did he choose the
[2:01:41] humiliation so he could express to you
[2:01:44] and me his redeeming love amen and so
[2:01:48] that he could be worshiped Through the
[2:01:50] Ages as God Our Savior by his redeeming
[2:02:00] love so I don't know who wrote that song
[2:02:04] but Redemption by
[2:02:08] Blood it's Love's Greatest
[2:02:11] Story it's not only Love's greatest
[2:02:14] story but it's God's greatest
[2:02:18] mystery it's the love it's the Wonder of
[2:02:22] all wonders what manner of love is this
[2:02:26] that made me a sinful man if I say like
[2:02:30] that
[2:02:32] perfect what manner of love is that it's
[2:02:36] a gotho love condenscending the
[2:02:38] redeeming love in this last days by his
[2:02:41] seventh angel messenger by a third pool
[2:02:44] Ministry of perfect love showing
[2:02:49] me what God ordained me to be
[2:02:52] be unfolded this
[2:02:55] Revelation not just in the letter but in
[2:02:58] the power and demonstration that's why
[2:03:01] he could say to the Hornets go back into
[2:03:04] your nest I'm sorry I bothered
[2:03:07] you and there's a brother Hoover where I
[2:03:10] go to church and his dad was the brother
[2:03:14] Hoover that he brother brandham
[2:03:16] dedicated the house or the the church to
[2:03:19] in that message that I quoted
[2:03:22] but his grandmother was brother
[2:03:24] branham's
[2:03:26] Nanny and she lived with the brandham
[2:03:30] family for a little while and brother
[2:03:33] brandham took her around this is the
[2:03:35] testimony to me a brother Hoover I never
[2:03:37] asked them he took her around and he
[2:03:39] showed her her responsibilities and
[2:03:42] where they did what in the
[2:03:44] house this is where we pray this is
[2:03:47] where we have devotions I want you to
[2:03:49] have devotions with my children and then
[2:03:51] he took her out
[2:03:53] out and took her to the window to the
[2:03:56] backyard and he said you see that steak
[2:03:59] there that white Stak he said I don't
[2:04:03] let my children
[2:04:05] play there around that white Stak and
[2:04:09] the reason
[2:04:11] is I promised those
[2:04:14] Hornets that I would not disturb them if
[2:04:18] they would go back into their nest
[2:04:24] that was the same power that spoke to
[2:04:27] the bull that was the same power when
[2:04:30] that couple was making love in the
[2:04:32] meetings and disturbing the meetings and
[2:04:35] doing all that vulgarity that stood in
[2:04:37] the Gap and said I forgive
[2:04:41] you now what about
[2:04:44] us how are we going to keep the unity of
[2:04:47] the spirit that's what those Seven
[2:04:49] Virtues are friends that's the blood of
[2:04:52] Christ coming through us that's our
[2:04:54] cross that is suffering that is
[2:04:58] painful when somebody does you wrong and
[2:05:01] you don't deserve it especially when
[2:05:04] you've tried to help somebody and
[2:05:06] everybody's been there we've all been
[2:05:08] there but I'm saying that just to relate
[2:05:10] to you it's not the easy way it's the
[2:05:13] harder way that leads to the tremendous
[2:05:16] victory in the love divine amen
[2:05:28] and so I'll close with
[2:05:33] this Redemption by
[2:05:35] blood is Love's greatest
[2:05:38] story and it's not only Love's Greatest
[2:05:41] Story it's God's greatest
[2:05:47] secret and the way I know that is
[2:05:50] because what the man with the pyramid
[2:05:53] message whom God sent to build me into
[2:05:57] the PowerHouse of God what he told me on
[2:06:03] tape and I'm referring to Christ is the
[2:06:06] mystery of God
[2:06:08] revealed and
[2:06:11] uh go read this for yourself go meditate
[2:06:14] on
[2:06:16] this this is God's great mystery of love
[2:06:23] expressed that God and man became one
[2:06:28] Hallelujah
[2:06:30] [Applause]
[2:06:31] uhoh God and man became
[2:06:36] one the whole thing is God and man one
[2:06:42] Hallelujah now listen to him unfold this
[2:06:46] God and man was
[2:06:48] one there
[2:06:52] and God and man is
[2:06:56] one
[2:07:00] hereu what is it being filled with his
[2:07:04] Spirit him having the
[2:07:08] prances Hallelujah that was God's
[2:07:11] achievement that's God's
[2:07:14] purpose to do that that he might be in
[2:07:17] Christ and Christ in us and all of us
[2:07:20] together one hallelujah what is the
[2:07:23] preeminence Colossians said it's the
[2:07:26] headship over the
[2:07:28] body and the headship over the body was
[2:07:32] never revealed until the evening time
[2:07:35] message when God laid in Zion in The
[2:07:38] Bride of Jesus Christ represented by a
[2:07:42] prophet a son of man can we say Amen a
[2:07:45] son of man revealing the
[2:07:48] Perfection of the son of man
[2:07:52] it's his perfect life it's his perfect
[2:07:55] blood to make this great Secret The
[2:07:58] Wonder of all secrets that a filthy
[2:08:02] sinful man like me could come to the
[2:08:05] stature of a perfect
[2:08:11] man he was one
[2:08:14] there and he's one
[2:08:17] here one there the son of man man in the
[2:08:24] East this is who we worship is it not
[2:08:27] this is the one that bled for me this is
[2:08:31] redeeming
[2:08:35] love one
[2:08:38] there he spirit and blood had to become
[2:08:45] one spirit and blood became one in a man
[2:08:49] born perfect amen so he could raise up
[2:08:53] and live a perfect life without sin yet
[2:08:56] tempted by sin so that he could be the
[2:08:58] perfect sacrifice
[2:09:02] Amen to
[2:09:04] project the grace of redeeming love the
[2:09:08] grace of redeeming love his blood sir
[2:09:12] his life and the creative power in his
[2:09:17] life Hallelujah
[2:09:22] so he was one there son of man in the
[2:09:25] East he's one here a son of man lifted
[2:09:30] up in the west to manifest the
[2:09:33] Perfection of the son of
[2:09:36] man and I'm not going to read the quote
[2:09:38] but there's a quote on it and I had to
[2:09:41] pray over it a long time to really by
[2:09:45] God's grace I believe to see what it is
[2:09:49] the Perfection of the son of man in
[2:09:51] Christ
[2:09:52] that pyramid is the Perfection of the
[2:09:55] son of man in Christ because that
[2:09:58] pyramid is Christ that pyramid is the
[2:10:01] Life of Christ that we sing I want to be
[2:10:03] like Jesus I want to be more like Jesus
[2:10:06] what is it to be Christlike
[2:10:10] amen but if you really want to be
[2:10:13] Christlike it's the harder way it's the
[2:10:16] way of self- crucifixion so that what I
[2:10:19] can express virtue so that what I can
[2:10:22] have the knowledge in this situation
[2:10:24] what's right and what's wrong and then
[2:10:26] when I see what's right and wrong and
[2:10:28] God has finally showed me what's right
[2:10:29] and wrong well now I'm going to go I'm
[2:10:32] going to go deal with it but I got to
[2:10:34] have Temperance wait a minute wait a
[2:10:37] minute Temperance you know what it's
[2:10:39] it's you got to be able to say it in the
[2:10:42] right place you got to be able to say it
[2:10:44] at the right time you got to be say it
[2:10:46] in the right spirit so Temperance I got
[2:10:49] the knowledge of it I got the temp of it
[2:10:51] I'll hold my peace I say honey God
[2:10:54] showed me how to deal with this problem
[2:10:57] and she says hold your peace and I say
[2:11:00] how long
[2:11:02] patience patience amen hallelujah to
[2:11:05] your knowledge add Temperance to your
[2:11:08] Temperance add patience how long
[2:11:12] until until God gives you the time and
[2:11:15] God gives you the place and God gives
[2:11:17] you the mental attitude and someday it
[2:11:20] just comes unconscious L you're at a
[2:11:22] certain place at a certain time and God
[2:11:25] moves you like he moves Simeon he moves
[2:11:29] you and the Holy Ghost moved
[2:11:32] you that's right and he went to see the
[2:11:36] Christ but you're going to reflect the
[2:11:48] Christ so God was one there
[2:11:52] there to reflect redeeming love can you
[2:11:55] say amen and God is one here to reflect
[2:12:00] perfect
[2:12:01] love the perfect life of Jesus Christ
[2:12:04] how many wants that how many wants to
[2:12:08] see that well God promised by Amos 3:7
[2:12:11] he would show it to you so when I see
[2:12:14] this picture I'm not trying to separate
[2:12:17] the pillar of fire from a man because
[2:12:20] God died to bring him and himself
[2:12:23] together and make him
[2:12:27] one in fact there's three unclean
[2:12:30] spirits well I won't go there I won't go
[2:12:40] there so what is this perfect
[2:12:43] Oneness let him tell us what this
[2:12:47] perfect Oneness is from Blasphemous
[2:12:50] names how many want to be perfectly one
[2:12:53] with the Lord
[2:12:54] Jesus you
[2:12:56] do and when I meet you you think I'll be
[2:12:59] able to feel that love of
[2:13:02] Jesus you feel think I'll be able to
[2:13:04] feel that rainbow
[2:13:07] love that
[2:13:09] light that cut him when he was cut at
[2:13:11] Calvary to reflect that Seven Virtues of
[2:13:14] his
[2:13:15] love I'm talking to me I'm challenging
[2:13:19] me there's days I get up I don't feel
[2:13:22] like going outside the house and I don't
[2:13:24] want nobody knocking on the door and I
[2:13:27] ain't going to answer any text but I'll
[2:13:29] do it
[2:13:30] anyway I'll do it anyway I just have to
[2:13:32] pray a little bit read my Bible a little
[2:13:35] bit amen get rid of the old self and let
[2:13:39] that life that's in me have the
[2:13:41] preeminence amen oh Lord amen yes so
[2:13:47] here is his definition that's my words
[2:13:50] of per perfect
[2:13:52] Oneness then Blasphemous names then that
[2:13:55] was number one number one coming to your
[2:13:57] mental Faith right here comes the Holy
[2:14:00] Spirit coming down into your mental
[2:14:02] Faith making it a spiritual Faith then
[2:14:06] that spiritual Faith only recognizes the
[2:14:12] word now and number two three then
[2:14:16] you'll have spiritual you'll have the
[2:14:19] Holy Spirit and we'll seal all these
[2:14:21] things into you as the Holy Spirit
[2:14:25] covers this from your faith up to the
[2:14:28] Holy
[2:14:31] Spirit seals you in with
[2:14:33] Christ then you become
[2:14:39] one then you become one I'm potentially
[2:14:44] one with him now when I've been engaged
[2:14:47] to him by the new birth and now I'm
[2:14:50] putting on the the wedding Garment of
[2:14:52] the Seven Virtues and I'm getting ready
[2:14:54] for the bridegroom's coming at the
[2:14:57] Capstone coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:15:00] amen for the
[2:15:01] wedding and when the wedding comes I'll
[2:15:05] not only be one in my soul I'll be one
[2:15:08] in my spirit I'll be one in my flesh the
[2:15:12] beginning of the creation of God that
[2:15:14] started as redeeming love in him will
[2:15:16] become the finished creation of God in
[2:15:18] Me A Spoken Word SE of God's perfect
[2:15:22] love
[2:15:27] Hallelujah so if you follow this when
[2:15:30] you become one like that that's when
[2:15:33] your name on the check becomes as good
[2:15:37] is his name Hallelujah not until until
[2:15:41] it's his name on the check but when you
[2:15:44] come to the top of the
[2:15:46] pyramid and you're capped off with
[2:15:48] perfect love and now you're under the
[2:15:51] preeminence and the full control of the
[2:15:53] Holy Ghost he gives you the spoken word
[2:15:56] and you have the authority to use it
[2:16:00] because you're under his control amen
[2:16:03] and you there's many symbols of that in
[2:16:05] the Old Testament when Joseph came to
[2:16:07] the right hand of pharaoh he was given
[2:16:09] the king signant
[2:16:10] ring morai was given the king signant
[2:16:14] ring why because Joseph had the coat of
[2:16:17] seven colors Mori had the character of
[2:16:19] Jesus Christ power without character
[2:16:23] is
[2:16:24] satanic so thank God for the cloud ring
[2:16:29] it's a mystery to the world it's a great
[2:16:32] cloud ring of mystery but to us it's the
[2:16:35] preeminence hallelujah it's the king's
[2:16:38] Authority the king's sword placed in the
[2:16:41] hand of a prophet for a Ministry amen of
[2:16:46] perfection
[2:16:51] my time's
[2:17:01] up I said I remind myself and I made a
[2:17:07] statement love is the greatest of all
[2:17:09] God's
[2:17:11] wonders the seventh pyramid message is
[2:17:14] the greatest of all the
[2:17:16] messages and the seventh angel is the
[2:17:19] greatest of all The
[2:17:22] Messengers now here's what he said in
[2:17:24] the seventh seal and I've looked at this
[2:17:26] for years and years and years and
[2:17:29] absolutely had no
[2:17:32] Revelation I'm not saying I have it now
[2:17:34] but I'm going to read it to you because
[2:17:36] this is truly an amazing
[2:17:39] quote and he's talking about the
[2:17:41] constellation and did you notice that
[2:17:43] one angel I said in there was a strange
[2:17:46] Angel he looked to me more than any of
[2:17:49] the rest of them you remember that they
[2:17:52] were in a constellation three on a side
[2:17:55] and one on the top and the one right
[2:17:57] next to me here counting from the left
[2:18:00] to the right would have been the seventh
[2:18:08] angel he was
[2:18:11] brighter meant more to me than the rest
[2:18:15] of
[2:18:16] them you remember I said he had his
[2:18:18] chest out like that was flying Eastward
[2:18:20] you remember like that I said it picked
[2:18:22] me up Lifted Me Up you remember that
[2:18:24] here it
[2:18:25] is the one with the seven seal notice
[2:18:29] the wording the thing that I wondered
[2:18:32] all my
[2:18:35] life the mother seals meant a lot to me
[2:18:38] of course but oh you don't know what
[2:18:41] this has meant for one time in my life
[2:18:44] in another quote he said the other six
[2:18:47] Angels were ordinary angels
[2:18:51] but this Angel was in the position of
[2:18:53] the Capstone I mean in the Keystone this
[2:18:57] Angel three on a side and one on the top
[2:18:59] he was in the position of the
[2:19:03] Archangel the revelation of it I can't
[2:19:06] give it to you point it out search it
[2:19:09] friends look into it and here is where
[2:19:13] the revelation of the Rapture of the
[2:19:16] Rapture is
[2:19:18] behold see
[2:19:20] see this revelation of God's love
[2:19:24] unfolding down to perfect love see it
[2:19:28] and how are you going to see
[2:19:30] it God has to bestow it upon you my last
[2:19:35] comment God has to bestow it upon you he
[2:19:38] has to give it to you as a gift of Grace
[2:19:41] he has to give it to you as a present
[2:19:43] and it takes two gifts to see it it
[2:19:46] takes the prophetic gift which is the
[2:19:49] eye in the Capstone in order for him to
[2:19:52] open it up and show you by
[2:19:54] manifestation the great secret of his
[2:19:58] love standing before you God and man won
[2:20:02] the stature of a perfect man how many
[2:20:06] wants to be that I want to be that and
[2:20:10] and so he has to bestow that upon you
[2:20:13] and then that becomes the light of the
[2:20:15] age and then in order for you to get
[2:20:18] that Revelation he had has to give you
[2:20:22] the gift of faith he has to give you the
[2:20:25] predestinated gift of faith and when you
[2:20:27] have that predestinated gift of faith
[2:20:30] then God making himself known through
[2:20:33] his Prophet by the Light of the hour it
[2:20:36] strikes that seed and you catch the
[2:20:39] revelation of a son of man manifesting
[2:20:42] the
[2:20:43] Perfection of the son of man and what is
[2:20:49] it it's God's Grace for your
[2:20:54] Perfection praise the lord it's God's
[2:20:57] grace may I have the

[2:24:07] don't want anybody to come in and I'm
[2:24:09] not awake and I start reading my Bible
[2:24:11] then I start singing songs like
[2:24:14] this it's a prayer in my heart it's a
[2:24:17] revelation of what God has pre
[2:24:20] destinated the bride to in this day

[2:24:25] son of
[2:24:28] [Music]
[2:24:29] man and that word
[2:24:32] Perfection is
[2:24:34] misunderstood and I've had to learn the
[2:24:36] hard
[2:24:38] [Music]
[2:24:42] way we're
[2:24:45] perfect by his blood Hallelujah and his
[2:24:49] spirit

[2:24:52] life so his
[2:24:55] blood purchased your Perfection thank
[2:24:58] you Lord amen and through his blood of
[2:25:01] redeeming love before the foundation of
[2:25:03] the world when he looked through that
[2:25:05] redeeming love he saw you in perfect
[2:25:10] love yes or amen he saw you
[2:25:14] there okay that's what the blood does
[2:25:18] for you but what the life does for you
[2:25:22] what the Holy Ghost does for you the
[2:25:24] Holy Ghost makes you
[2:25:28] perfect what do I
[2:25:30] mean the Holy Ghost grows you into the
[2:25:34] stature of the perfect man the Holy
[2:25:36] Ghost brings you into maturity the Holy
[2:25:39] Ghost brings you into the stature of the
[2:25:41] perfect man the blood purchased it the

[2:25:46] it but the Holy Ghost is what manifests
[2:25:49] it are you with
[2:25:50] me and so what happens here's how God
[2:25:54] sees you because in his mind it's a
[2:25:57] finished work and you're there brother
[2:26:01] brandom went beyond the curtain of time
[2:26:02] you're
[2:26:03] there okay but in your life and in your
[2:26:08] manifestation whatever how much Holy
[2:26:10] Ghost you have in you maybe you have
[2:26:12] enough faith maybe you're avert you
[2:26:14] maybe you're a knowledge you haven't
[2:26:16] come to the stature of a perfect man yet
[2:26:20] but in God's sight you're perfect and so
[2:26:24] here's what
[2:26:26] happens there's a
[2:26:28] gap between how God sees you and what
[2:26:31] your life is
[2:26:34] manifesting do you understand there's a
[2:26:37] gap because in his sight I am perfect in
[2:26:41] his sight I am blameless and I will
[2:26:43] stand before him faultless but it has to
[2:26:47] be manifested by the life of the Holy
[2:26:50] Ghost
[2:26:51] most and so the Gap is this he sees us
[2:26:55] perfect but in manifestation of our life
[2:26:58] I haven't come to the maturity or the
[2:27:02] Perfection of a perfect man are you with
[2:27:05] me now the Gap there is this Satan knows
[2:27:09] this and Satan is your adversary and so
[2:27:13] Satan comes in that
[2:27:16] Gap and he tries to anoint you with fear
[2:27:20] that's right because he's constantly
[2:27:22] putting you back to what you were I'm
[2:27:25] still tormented by things that when I
[2:27:28] was 16 and 17 years old I have to battle
[2:27:33] [Music]
[2:27:36] that and so what am I going to do am I
[2:27:40] going to listen to his
[2:27:42] lie or am I going to look to my
[2:27:48] Advocate who stands in the gap for me
[2:27:51] amen as the great high priest the Lord
[2:27:55] Jesus Christ he stands there with his
[2:27:58] own blood
[2:28:00] amen and W his life is bringing me to
[2:28:06] Perfection he's my
[2:28:09] adversary and so I'm born of the love
[2:28:12] and now I'm growing in love and Satan is
[2:28:15] anointing me with fear I'm not going to
[2:28:18] make it the fear of failure the fear of
[2:28:20] this and the fear of that and he
[2:28:22] paralyzes your faith but perfect love
[2:28:26] casts out all
[2:28:29] fear and what is perfect love in his
[2:28:33] sight by his blood I'm forgiven he no
[2:28:37] longer remembers it he sees me perfect
[2:28:41] amen now in my sight I have the
[2:28:44] Revelation that I'm not in the stature
[2:28:46] of the perfect man but I am coming to
[2:28:48] the stature of a perfect man so
[2:28:51] therefore Satan get away from me take
[2:28:55] the anointing of the word of God that's
[2:28:58] coming down from your theoy and let it
[2:29:01] bless you let It cast out all fear
[2:29:05] Hallelujah prise
[2:29:08] God and
[2:29:10] so about a year ago brother Ferguson
[2:29:14] kind of was toward the end of the
[2:29:15] service he talked about being
[2:29:19] forgiven and being
[2:29:21] justified forgiven you did it Justified
[2:29:24] you never did it so by the
[2:29:28] blood I am
[2:29:30] forgiven and
[2:29:32] forgotten by all that I ever did
[2:29:35] Hallelujah then when his life comes into
[2:29:38] me I'm Justified hallelujah amen I'm
[2:29:42] being judged by his life and his
[2:29:48] life never sin in the first place it may
[2:29:52] not be mature in
[2:29:55] me but it's sinless with me I can't
[2:29:59] disbelieve the word I can't amen I can't
[2:30:03] disbelieve it I may not understand it
[2:30:06] but in due season with my heart is right
[2:30:10] God will bring me to it and so tonight
[2:30:13] if Satan is tormenting you if Satan is
[2:30:16] anointing you with fear or what
[2:30:18] everything that fear is one of the worst
[2:30:21] things that he can put on
[2:30:23] you because it
[2:30:25] paralyzes it paralyzes and it opens the
[2:30:28] door and then he moves in with other
[2:30:31] things and he's trying to bind you and
[2:30:34] take away the joy of your salvation and
[2:30:36] keep you on the defense when God has
[2:30:39] made us to take the offense in the name
[2:30:41] of Jesus Christ amen so we are
[2:30:45] forgiven it's forgotten we're pardoned
[2:30:49] and we are
[2:30:51] Justified let's sing this song one more
[2:30:53] time and whoever comes up can offer the
[2:30:56] prayer for those in
