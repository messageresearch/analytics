[12:18] and he had in his right hand seven
[12:22] stars seven stars now let's take the
[12:24] 20th verse right here and the Mystery of
[12:27] the Seven Stars which thou thought in my
[12:30] right hand and the Seven golden
[12:32] candlesticks the Seven Stars are seven
[12:36] angels or seven Messengers seven
[12:39] ministers all the seven churches and the
[12:43] Seven candlesticks the I sa are the
[12:44] seven churches he interprets it for us
[12:47] so that be sure there be no
[12:50] mistake an angel for each Church age oh
[12:54] that's going to be beautiful this week
[12:56] when we go back down in history pick up
[12:57] them angels and see the very Ministry
[12:59] they
[13:00] had they had the same
[13:02] Ministry exactly the same all down
[13:05] through the age in that little church
[13:07] sometime ago someone said you know the
[13:09] Catholic church is a good thing and it's
[13:11] a real church because it stood all down
[13:13] to the ages I said that's no mystery
[13:15] when it had all the government and
[13:17] everything else behind it how it stood
[13:18] and wave the storms but the mystery to
[13:20] me is how that little bit of minority
[13:23] that ever away the
[13:24] stor that was s of ster and so into
[13:27] lions and put on stretches and eat and
[13:29] burnt and Bel and killed and everything
[13:31] else and how they survived it it shows
[13:33] that the hand of God was with them
[13:35] that's all and still today her light's
[13:37] still burning amen yes sir now the Seven
[13:42] Stars that was in my right hand he had
[13:45] seven stars in his right hand which
[13:47] means the seven Ministers of Seven Ages
[13:50] oh it's beautiful how we go back and get
[13:52] the the minister that brought the
[13:54] message to the Ephesian church and the
[13:57] minister who brought the message and
[13:59] help with it unle death right down to
[14:01] the samna church into the pgus church
[14:04] the thra and all down through the age
[14:07] even into this age now the ministers
[14:10] that kept and brought the light and held
[14:12] it back like the original at the
[14:13] beginning and brought the light through
[14:15] he held them in his right hand think
[14:18] right hand doesn't exactly mean like
[14:20] Christ sitting on God's right hand it
[14:22] doesn't mean that God's got a right hand
[14:24] because God is the spirit but Christ was
[14:27] the right hand of power amen your
[14:29] right-and man the fell fellow stands by
[14:31] you the closest to you and remember the
[14:34] Seven Stars was in his right hand just
[14:38] think they were drawing their current
[14:40] their light from him they were
[14:43] completely under his control in his
[14:46] right
[14:47] hand every true servant of God is the
[14:50] same way help who can harm
[14:53] them who can harm them as one of the
[14:56] Angels Cried back there in the beginning
[14:58] remember an angel means messenger we get
[15:00] into those deeper things later in a week
[15:02] angel means messenger and he said what
[15:04] can separate us from the love of God
[15:06] that's in Christ can sickness amen can
[15:10] Peril can nakedness can sword can death
[15:14] I am persuaded said Paul that there's
[15:16] nothing can separate us from the love of
[15:18] God J right for we are completely
[15:21] yielded to his right hand somebody say
[15:23] holy R holy r that don't bother a bit
[15:26] you're a religious fanatic they don't
[15:28] even hear Hallelujah they're completely
[15:31] yielded and join their life from his
[15:33] right arm of power reflecting his light
[15:36] and meekness and kindness and gentleness
[15:38] and
[15:39] patience signs and wonders and miracles
[15:42] that the world call it witchcraft
[15:43] whatever they want to makes us no
[15:45] difference because we know we are
[15:47] yielding and in his right hand isn't
[15:49] that wonderful M now let's hurry because
[15:52] we don't want to wear you out in his
[15:55] right hand Seven Stars now the seventh
[15:58] and last
[15:59] um a representation of his person and
[16:03] out of his mouth goes a sharp two-
[16:08] sword I mean that's the sixth one out of
[16:11] his mouth goes a sharp 2-ag
[16:14] sword
[16:16] now l so many Waters and out of his
[16:20] mouth in his right hand he had the stars
[16:21] and out of his mouth goes a sharp two a
[16:23] sword now do you know what the sharp 2
[16:25] sword of the Bible is let's just catch
[16:28] it so you'll know take Hebrews 4 and 2
[16:31] just right back this a page or two and
[16:32] you'll get it Hebrews is just in behind
[16:36] Revelations here Jude and and Hebrews
[16:38] now get it close now
[16:42] or
[16:45] Hebrews fourth chapter of Hebrews here
[16:48] we are all right Hebrews the 4th chapter
[16:53] and the 12th verse for the word of God
[16:57] is quicker and and more powerful and
[17:00] sharper than any two- aged sword
[17:03] piercing even to the Divine center of
[17:06] the soul and the spirit and of the
[17:08] joints and the maror and is a discerner
[17:12] of the thoughts and intents of the
[17:15] heart and then they call you a
[17:20] m it's the word of
[17:22] God made manifest in his church
[17:29] sharper than any two-edged sword see I
[17:33] just happened to think of something else
[17:34] I don't know where I wrote a script get
[17:35] Revelations 19 just a minute let's get
[17:39] this again I think that's
[17:41] right um maybe Revelations 19 uh about

[18:29] and his name is called the word of
[18:34] God what went out of his mouth what went
[18:37] the white horse
[18:39] rider and Revelations also seven when I
[18:42] believe eight when the White Horse no
[18:44] six when the white horse rider went
[18:46] forth he was given a a bow to conquer
[18:49] and to conquer and a sword went out of
[18:52] his mouth what was he the white horse
[18:55] rider of
[18:57] Revelations notice the sword out of his
[19:01] mouth goes a sharp 2ag
[19:05] sword the word and finally by his word
[19:10] when it's made manifest to all the sons
[19:13] of God he'll cramp Every Nation down
[19:16] with his
[19:17] word by this sharp sword look at what
[19:20] happens as we get it and his right hand

[1:09:13] be seated for a few moments I'll ask you
[1:09:15] to stand when we read the wor the the
[1:09:17] the scripture this morning I want to
[1:09:19] greet you all on behalf of evening light
[1:09:22] Tabernacle it's a small Church there in
[1:09:24] be we been there for over 40 years it is
[1:09:27] a work that my father started he felt
[1:09:29] led to open the Church of Message Church
[1:09:32] there and I never wanted to preach in my
[1:09:35] life and I never wanted to be a pastor
[1:09:39] and here I am doing both of them and uh
[1:09:42] so so my advice to you if you don't want
[1:09:44] to do something don't say it out loud
[1:09:46] because God's going to hear you and but
[1:09:49] I've come to find out that you know I
[1:09:52] don't have nothing to preach about in
[1:09:54] the first place anyways it's not my word
[1:09:55] it's God's word and I come to find the
[1:09:58] more I preach it the more I enjoy it
[1:10:00] because there is so much gold nuggets in
[1:10:04] God's word and I have been taught as as
[1:10:07] as a younger man that when we come to
[1:10:08] church we we we come with a little
[1:10:10] spiritual s Satchel little Satchel
[1:10:13] spiritual bag and every every word of
[1:10:15] God that you can pick up that is a gold
[1:10:16] nugget take it with you and and and
[1:10:20] enjoy it throughout the week in other
[1:10:22] words dwell on God's word because this
[1:10:25] what keeps us going in this hour uh you
[1:10:28] you mentioned brother Hughes and uh you
[1:10:30] know I I admire the the brother he's
[1:10:32] he's way past past 70 I used to think
[1:10:34] that 70 was old growing up I am 60 and
[1:10:37] 70 is not old it's just more experience
[1:10:41] you know uh as we get older it's like
[1:10:43] you know that's not old that's a good
[1:10:44] age you know and and and I admire the
[1:10:47] brother because he has such a love for
[1:10:48] the Lord and that is a result of a man
[1:10:51] when you live in a spiritual atmosphere
[1:10:54] when you feed your soul with God's word
[1:10:57] you live in a different atmosphere and
[1:10:59] the things of the world don't bother
[1:11:01] you you know we had the greatest example
[1:11:03] brother Brandon when he went to the the
[1:11:05] restaurant there playing that wild music
[1:11:06] in the background brother Bram had it
[1:11:08] all phased out because he was leaving in
[1:11:11] a different
[1:11:12] atmosphere and and Billy Paul says Dad
[1:11:14] that's a beautiful song He's like what
[1:11:16] song you talking about he said dad you
[1:11:17] you are so in love with Jesus you don't
[1:11:19] even hear nothing around you I thought
[1:11:22] wow what an what an example to have in
[1:11:24] this hour that we could live like that
[1:11:26] that nothing in this world bothers us
[1:11:28] because we are living in Heavenly
[1:11:30] places and that should apply when we
[1:11:32] come to the house of God because a lot
[1:11:33] of times when we come to the house of
[1:11:34] God you know we should be the most
[1:11:36] happiest people and I see people coming
[1:11:38] to church with a long
[1:11:40] face and I I've asked the church who who
[1:11:42] died because I never got to
[1:11:44] notice why is everybody sad we should be
[1:11:47] happy you know yes we have problems in
[1:11:49] life but leave your problems out there
[1:11:51] Jesus knows about them come in here with
[1:11:53] an open heart say Lord I Need
[1:11:56] you you know I got problems in life I'm
[1:11:58] struggling right now I don't know how
[1:12:00] many of you are struggling I'm
[1:12:02] struggling if I were to ask the question
[1:12:04] this morning how many of you are tired I
[1:12:06] would think that everyone would lift our
[1:12:07] hand and say I'm
[1:12:09] tired yes I slept 8 hours last night
[1:12:12] nine but I'm still tired because there
[1:12:14] is anointing in the air that has come
[1:12:17] upon this nation and it's draining the
[1:12:20] people Church all right and they're
[1:12:22] coming to church drained when it should
[1:12:24] be the other way around we should come
[1:12:26] ready with a joyous spirit Spirit of
[1:12:28] worship so so what if I'm broke I got
[1:12:32] Jesus so what if my body's falling apart
[1:12:35] I got one waiting for me that's
[1:12:38] Eternal I I I got glasses here Church
[1:12:41] they B focals and driving glasses who
[1:12:43] would ever thought I'd be wearing these
[1:12:45] things this is for old
[1:12:47] people but yet here I am oh there you
[1:12:52] are it's like but you know what that
[1:12:55] doesn't bother me you know I got a bald
[1:12:57] spot in the back it bothers everybody
[1:12:59] except for me I'm like why you bothered
[1:13:00] about it every hair that I lost it's
[1:13:03] waiting for me
[1:13:05] somewhere there was the time when I
[1:13:07] would roll down the window my hair was
[1:13:08] floating in the air you know oh being
[1:13:11] young but now I roll on the window
[1:13:13] nothing moves there's nothing to fly the
[1:13:17] hair is losing who
[1:13:19] cares I got one that's waiting for me
[1:13:22] that's Eternal knows no sick
[1:13:25] it's Eternal it's got more than 2020
[1:13:28] Vision
[1:13:29] church but we we get so caught up in
[1:13:31] life in our in our in our mortal life
[1:13:34] you know our physical life that we let
[1:13:35] that drain us down and we forget we're
[1:13:37] not from here we're just passing through
[1:13:40] church one day there's going to be a
[1:13:45] Rapture we've been preaching about it
[1:13:47] for years one day there's going to be a
[1:13:50] Rapture and some of them I'm not going
[1:13:53] to say none of you some folks ain't
[1:13:56] going to make it in the
[1:13:57] Rapture news flash Church it ain't for
[1:14:00] everybody it's for those that have been
[1:14:03] filled with the Holy Ghost it's for
[1:14:06] those that have Jesus in you all right
[1:14:08] amen and and and I'm so glad that we
[1:14:10] have that opportunity to to get ready
[1:14:12] we're still here because the last one

[1:14:16] church maybe that last one is
[1:14:19] you you know we've been sitting here for
[1:14:21] 40 years in church and we still
[1:14:23] struggling good you know I use the
[1:14:26] analogy of a skinny guy who sees a
[1:14:30] magazine of a strong guy with a lot of
[1:14:31] muscles and he's like wow I want to be
[1:14:33] like that so what does he do he starts
[1:14:36] lifting weights first five pounds you

[1:14:42] after a week he's sore I'm so sore how
[1:14:44] much you lifting five pounds oh you
[1:14:46] weakling But as time passes by those
[1:14:49] five become 10 those 10 become 50 after
[1:14:52] a while we're benching 250 wow and he
[1:14:55] looks in the mirror he's he's been
[1:14:56] transformed he's different after you
[1:14:59] know 5 10 years it's transformation and
[1:15:01] I tell the church we've been in the
[1:15:03] message for 40 years and we're still in
[1:15:05] the same
[1:15:06] spot something is wrong somewhere all
[1:15:08] right and it ain't the word of God it
[1:15:12] ain't the message of the hour it's us
[1:15:15] church we got the problem but thank God
[1:15:18] for his grace he's still waiting on
[1:15:20] us cuz the last one hasn't come in yet
[1:15:24] but when the last one comes in I'm not
[1:15:26] here scolding you that's brother po job
[1:15:29] I'm just here to encourage
[1:15:30] you my my dad used to say I'm not here
[1:15:32] to judge you church I'm I'm not your
[1:15:34] judge even though I know your lives I
[1:15:36] know what you're doing I'm not your
[1:15:37] judge but when I preach the word of God
[1:15:39] you all are being judged by God's
[1:15:44] word amen and we've been here for so
[1:15:47] many years and we're still
[1:15:48] struggling why the last one hasn't come
[1:15:51] in yet but when the last one comes in
[1:15:55] brother brandham says the door to the
[1:15:57] Gentiles is
[1:16:00] closed and people are going to keep on
[1:16:01] leaving life like

[1:16:18] with the word of God I I've had the
[1:16:20] privilege of preaching in Columbia since
[1:16:22] 2015 and I've preached in many churches
[1:16:24] and I've told the same thing too when I
[1:16:26] get there don't don't look at the

[1:16:45] there are times when the minister is
[1:16:46] preaching and and he quotes a scripture
[1:16:48] in my mind I can finish the scripture
[1:16:51] why I've heard that for years but that
[1:16:53] ain't gonna do me no good if Christ
[1:16:55] ain't living in

[1:20:38] including myself where are we at this
[1:20:40] morning with the word of God Amen uh
[1:20:42] Heavenly Father we just want to thank
[1:20:44] you for your your word this morning we
[1:20:46] know that it is blessed already
[1:20:48] father and your Prophet said that we are
[1:20:50] blessed when we read it Lord and but
[1:20:52] father we need more more of you this
[1:20:54] morning morning father as as we as we as
[1:20:56] we steal our soul and our spirit this
[1:20:58] morning Father come and speak to our
[1:21:00] hearts Lord that we can live from here
[1:21:02] happy because we heard your word with
[1:21:05] the the desire and and the strength to
[1:21:06] keep pressing on Lord we ask all these
[1:21:08] things in the precious name of Jesus
[1:21:11] Christ amen God bless you you may be
[1:21:13] seated my my father when he was
[1:21:16] preaching he was a very a very hard
[1:21:18] person to preach a very strong very
[1:21:20] strict and uh he he would always say you
[1:21:23] know if I wanted to I could fill up the
[1:21:26] church here in beard uh all I would have
[1:21:29] to do is just lower the standards and my
[1:21:32] church would get filled he would say and
[1:21:35] that sounds nice because when you're
[1:21:36] preaching to a full crowd there there's
[1:21:38] just a different anointing there because
[1:21:40] you're thinking wow we're all believers
[1:21:42] here but we know the prophet says
[1:21:44] there's three kinds of Believers there's
[1:21:46] the the believer the make believer and
[1:21:47] the unbeliever and we're very quick to
[1:21:49] point to the unbeliever all right
[1:21:52] hello he's an unbeliever
[1:21:55] how do you know well he don't come to
[1:21:57] church he don't sing he don't lift up
[1:21:59] his hands in church and and we're very
[1:22:01] quick to judge other people and the make
[1:22:03] believer you know he he he looks very
[1:22:05] religious on Sunday but what is he like
[1:22:08] on
[1:22:10] Monday because when when we're in church
[1:22:12] it's very easy to be very religious I
[1:22:13] you know I can get very emotionally in
[1:22:15] church I can raise up my hand say glory
[1:22:17] to God that's that's good brother and
[1:22:19] then come Monday drag my feet to work
[1:22:22] and just be a little devil that's a make
[1:22:25] believer but a Believer he he he he's
[1:22:29] he's a real deal because his life tells
[1:22:31] you what he is and to me uh uh my father
[1:22:35] was I'm not trying to to to uplift my
[1:22:38] father but my father was the real deal
[1:22:40] he he he was strict Church very strict
[1:22:43] and he would say I I I could fill it up
[1:22:46] and lower the standards to to to the
[1:22:47] word of God and feel these Church of he
[1:22:50] goes body goes I have been given one
[1:22:52] commission you would say and that's to
[1:22:55] preach a sound Doctrine yeah because one
[1:22:59] day I am going to have to answer for
[1:23:03] what I preached that's it amen and so
[1:23:07] through throughout the life of my
[1:23:08] father's Ministry you know our church
[1:23:10] Never Grow Big because my dad preached
[1:23:12] the word of God and the word of God in
[1:23:14] church it's
[1:23:16] hard but my mom used to say me it's only
[1:23:19] hard if you ain't living it because when
[1:23:22] you're living it it's very easy to say
[1:23:24] hey man brother preach it brother you
[1:23:26] you got to preach it preach it but when
[1:23:29] you ain't living it it's like oh can we
[1:23:32] just talk about love instead you know my
[1:23:35] my dad would say church if you can't say
[1:23:37] Amen at least say ouch say something but
[1:23:41] you know the word of God it's there to
[1:23:43] to form us it's there to correct us my
[1:23:46] mom when I was growing up she would Whit
[1:23:48] me and she had a famous saying M this is
[1:23:51] going to hurt me more than it's going to
[1:23:52] hurt you and I couldn't understand
[1:23:54] understand I I would get the whacking
[1:23:56] sister Po and I was jumping you speaking
[1:23:58] in tongues because it hurt you know and
[1:24:00] my mom was fine she wasn't nothing was
[1:24:02] hurting and I'm thinking what what kind
[1:24:04] of a statement is that this is going to
[1:24:06] hurt me more than you but I found out
[1:24:08] when I became a
[1:24:09] parent oh to have to to correct your
[1:24:13] children brother it hurt
[1:24:15] me but and my daughter would run
[1:24:19] away I thought oh my god that hurt me to
[1:24:23] correct them
[1:24:24] but you know what the reward was when
[1:24:26] she would come back with a little note
[1:24:27] Dad I'm so sorry I love you like
[1:24:32] wow because correction is love amen and
[1:24:37] sometimes God's got to put us in the
[1:24:38] hospital bed to get our
[1:24:41] attention he's got to he's got to put
[1:24:43] through a little squeeze to get our
[1:24:45] attention he's got to remind
[1:24:47] us who we are because sometimes we
[1:24:50] forget who we are we've been in this
[1:24:52] message for so many years it becomes so
[1:24:54] coming to us Prophet The Prophet said
[1:24:57] yeah he said but what are you doing
[1:24:59] about what he said is a question all
[1:25:00] right amen we you know 40 years have
[1:25:02] been passing by you know I asked the
[1:25:04] church one day how many of you got five
[1:25:06] years and a couple of hands you know

[1:25:14] lot of years passing by and why are we
[1:25:17] still
[1:25:18] struggling God help us this morning
[1:25:21] church amen we're not here to judge but
[1:25:24] let let us examine our lives where are
[1:25:27] we and what should we be doing in this
[1:25:29] last hour that we are living in what is
[1:25:31] our Focus this morning you know uh I was
[1:25:33] listening to the the song you sang this
[1:25:35] morning beautiful songs and and and
[1:25:37] right now we're in that Spirit of a
[1:25:39] Christmas throughout the whole world and
[1:25:40] I was listening to a radio station the
[1:25:42] other day a Christmas uh station singing
[1:25:44] a song about It's a Wonderful Time of
[1:25:47] the Year you know and just you know the
[1:25:50] snow bells ringing and whatever Dash
[1:25:52] into the snow I'm like wow and not once
[1:25:55] they mention
[1:25:56] Jesus I said what's going on here
[1:26:00] they've taken Jesus and put him you know
[1:26:01] back in the
[1:26:03] major and they're out there shopping
[1:26:05] like crazy people H you know if you
[1:26:08] don't get a gift for Christmas this here
[1:26:10] don't feel bad you already got the
[1:26:12] greatest gift ever
[1:26:13] Church Jesus
[1:26:15] Christ
[1:26:17] amen and and I and and I wonder you
[1:26:20] know what Have We Become with this last
[1:26:22] hour we we've forgotten Jesus Jesus Lord
[1:26:25] don't ever let me forget your mercies
[1:26:28] don't ever let me forget you know
[1:26:29] sometimes I walk out of my backyard and
[1:26:31] I don't have a brand new home I've got
[1:26:33] an adobe house I'm happy with
[1:26:35] that you know why because when I leave
[1:26:37] it's staying
[1:26:39] behind and sometimes I walk out to my
[1:26:41] yard and say Lord I got more than I can
[1:26:43] handle why would I want more I can't
[1:26:46] even keep up with my yard brother George
[1:26:48] when are you going to cut the grass why
[1:26:50] already cut it last week when he's
[1:26:51] cutting again like good grief
[1:26:54] why do it keep growing for you know we
[1:26:56] we can't handle what we have and I think
[1:26:58] but but yet the most important thing
[1:27:00] that we have sometimes we neglect
[1:27:04] it because life is so busy for
[1:27:07] us and we we forget God's
[1:27:10] goodness and we forget his grace
[1:27:13] amen I heard say one time he says many
[1:27:16] times I've trampled God's mercy right
[1:27:20] what he say have you ever trampled God's
[1:27:22] mercy before you when you know you
[1:27:24] should have done something you did it
[1:27:26] and God's mercy he spares you he but I
[1:27:28] could never do that to God's grace
[1:27:30] because his grace is always
[1:27:32] sufficient
[1:27:34] amen God help us in this last hour I I
[1:27:37] was looking at your program actually I
[1:27:39] opened up my Bible today and I was and
[1:27:41] the first thing I pulled up was a flyer
[1:27:43] from Shalom Tabernacle 2021 when you had
[1:27:46] your annual meetings and and and the the
[1:27:49] the quote that brother Paul put there
[1:27:50] whoever put it there oh we're going to
[1:27:51] give a credit to the pastor it says and
[1:27:54] the Gentiles are called out the bride is
[1:27:56] ready that that was the quote he put on
[1:27:58] the little marker that I have there I
[1:28:00] used to keep him in my Bible to remind
[1:28:02] me you know of what the theme was and it
[1:28:05] says here brother BR says here the bride
[1:28:06] is ready the Rapture is at hand can we
[1:28:08] realize
[1:28:10] that can we actually believe that is it
[1:28:14] a story that's been told is it a myth to
[1:28:18] us is it a something that sounds real is
[1:28:22] it something that we outside can believe
[1:28:27] or is it something that's in
[1:28:31] us that's part of us you know there's a
[1:28:34] difference between feeling the presence
[1:28:36] and being filled with the presence right
[1:28:38] that's good yes sir because we go to
[1:28:40] church you and I see Sinners and and
[1:28:42] backsliders they're out there crying
[1:28:44] like wow they're being blessed but it's
[1:28:46] just a
[1:28:47] blessing but there's a difference
[1:28:48] between being blessed and being fi
[1:28:50] Church all right and what the church
[1:28:52] needs is a feeling and once you get the
[1:28:56] feeling you become a blessing church
[1:28:59] amen that's good is it is something that
[1:29:02] we we have that we that we outside can
[1:29:05] believe it or is it something that is in
[1:29:06] us that's part of us that it's more than
[1:29:10] life to us is is living for the Lord
[1:29:12] more than life to you ask yourself that
[1:29:14] question when you wake up in the morning
[1:29:16] why are we here in the first place why
[1:29:19] was I born in this last hour why did the
[1:29:21] message come to me of all the friends
[1:29:23] that I had in school why am I the only
[1:29:25] one that got to hear the
[1:29:27] message of all the friends that we had

[1:34:17] prophet you didn't understand you know
[1:34:21] even to the point where bbam talks about
[1:34:23] wearing a ring my mom had a problem
[1:34:25] wearing the ring because in the
[1:34:26] apostolic church that was considered
[1:34:29] worldly was called Julie from the world
[1:34:31] it was worldly and my mom my my dad

[1:35:41] man and my grandfather he says he
[1:35:44] just
[1:35:46] is they say nothing
[1:35:49] else but my mom was was that way she

[1:36:33] sickness whether it be disease whatever

[1:37:26] to move whack it again and whack it
[1:37:29] again and whack it again right and whack
[1:37:33] it until you've chipped a hole through
[1:37:35] like a little chicken peeping outside of
[1:37:37] a or an
[1:37:39] eagle what you
[1:37:41] are peep yourself right through that old
[1:37:44] Shell of sickness cut your way out and
[1:37:46] say hallelujah where's the next
[1:37:50] one amen that's the battle that's the
[1:37:52] soldier that's the soldier of the
[1:37:56] cross I think he goes in line with the
[1:37:58] message this morning of a sound
[1:38:00] Doctrine amen because we are living in a
[1:38:03] time where there's so much doctrines
[1:38:06] coming up from the pulpit church right
[1:38:08] now we as M beli to have a job we need
[1:38:10] to know our message and the word of
[1:38:13] God Amen because today a lot of people
[1:38:16] they don't hear the message and whatever
[1:38:18] the minister says amen he must know he
[1:38:20] he Amen to that and we have so many
[1:38:23] different doctrines today that I have to
[1:38:25] ask myself where did they come from when
[1:38:27] did Brother R ever say that there was an
[1:38:30] eighth
[1:38:32] messenger everything runs in sevens in
[1:38:34] the Bible seven spirits seven Church
[1:38:37] agents seven
[1:38:38] Messengers where did the eth one come in
[1:38:40] you know but it just goes to show that
[1:38:43] we are living in an hour where those
[1:38:45] things are to rise up in this last last
[1:38:47] hour BR Braham says that the hour that
[1:38:49] we're living in the condition that has
[1:38:50] risen up it is meant to be for that hour
[1:38:53] that we are living in that's why it it
[1:38:56] behooves us Church in this morning to
[1:38:58] stand on the word of God brother B asked
[1:39:00] this question and he's asks the question
[1:39:02] and he says oh brother what does a good
[1:39:05] pastor have to do
[1:39:08] today just do the best he can to stand
[1:39:12] out and cut the limbs where they want to
[1:39:14] and let the chips fall in where they
[1:39:16] want to and sling it out there that's
[1:39:19] all yes sir that's right don't spare
[1:39:21] anybody just preach the word and stay
[1:39:25] right with
[1:39:26] it just Hammer right away you know
[1:39:29] hammer and Quack they kind of go
[1:39:30] together with each
[1:39:31] other if they throw you in jail preach
[1:39:34] in jail in jail if you're put away
[1:39:38] anywhere else preach everywhere you go
[1:39:41] just keep on preaching that's right now
[1:39:44] that's what's happen
[1:39:46] see they're smoothing it
[1:39:48] out revive me return on to me and let me
[1:39:52] tell you something when the Holy Ghost
[1:39:54] comes back it brings new birth and new
[1:39:58] life it brings a conversion the baptism
[1:40:01] of the spirit brings the church back to
[1:40:03] itself again it puts life back in the
[1:40:06] church you know we don't have to wait
[1:40:08] for a convention to have a Revival we
[1:40:12] can have a Revival with three people in
[1:40:13] the
[1:40:14] church you you you get one person that's
[1:40:17] on fire for the Lord huh that's
[1:40:20] contagious after a while that anointing
[1:40:22] falls on you oh and guess what now we
[1:40:25] got two on fire for the Lord after while
[1:40:28] that fire begins to spread Church you
[1:40:30] know oh what a glorious thing when we
[1:40:32] can come to church and if there's only
[1:40:33] 10 people in church we can have a
[1:40:35] Revival with 10 people
[1:40:38] church but but the thing is nobody comes
[1:40:41] with a fire they're they're like well I
[1:40:42] need for the song leader to inspire
[1:40:45] me I need the message to move me if
[1:40:47] brother Paul don't move me then then I I
[1:40:49] what's what's wrong with him no what's
[1:40:51] wrong with you what's wrong with us
[1:40:54] Church you know there are times that I
[1:40:57] can't sleep at night I wake up at 1:00
[1:40:59] in the morning 2:00 in the morning when
[1:41:01] I was working I slept all night long now
[1:41:04] that I'm the pastor I can't sleep and I
[1:41:06] wake up at 1:00 in the morning and I'm
[1:41:08] there looking at Darkness can't fall
[1:41:10] asleep you
[1:41:12] know and I'll put a h of brother brandom
[1:41:16] on no I'm not trying to act religious
[1:41:18] this is just what I do I put on tape of
[1:41:21] brother Brandon and within 5 minutes I
[1:41:23] fall asleep I
[1:41:27] get you fell asleep listening to a taper
[1:41:29] of the Mark I sure
[1:41:32] did because that
[1:41:34] anointing it soothe me amen plus I get
[1:41:39] to hear the Lord speaking to me at 1:00
[1:41:41] in the morning and sometimes I'll wake
[1:41:43] up again and B is still preaching and
[1:41:45] I'll hear the more message and then fall
[1:41:47] asleep again and there ain't nothing
[1:41:49] wrong with that church the problem is
[1:41:52] falling asleep in church chur when
[1:41:54] you're hearing the tape that's the
[1:41:57] problem and a lot of time when you see
[1:41:58] the church members are
[1:42:03] like they say their final
[1:42:05] amen and they're
[1:42:08] out and sometimes I'll I I'll hear the
[1:42:10] message and from there I I get
[1:42:12] inspiration to preach something on
[1:42:14] Sunday because you know you heard people
[1:42:18] say well I've heard it all I've heard it
[1:42:19] all before I've heard that tape before
[1:42:21] again well hear it again cuz you
[1:42:23] probably miss something that's right
[1:42:25] amen it's like breakfast you have
[1:42:27] breakfast yesterday you're going to skip
[1:42:30] breakfast today and the rest of your
[1:42:31] life no I need breakfast again
[1:42:32] today it's the same with the word of God
[1:42:35] we got to hear it every day bam says
[1:42:37] that a good Christian will pray every
[1:42:38] day and read the word of God every day
[1:42:42] and we have an excuse because our phones
[1:42:43] nowadays have apps that pop up with a
[1:42:46] quote of the day and the scripture of
[1:42:48] the day that's right you don't even have
[1:42:49] to look for it it's right there beep
[1:42:51] quote of the day but how many of us
[1:42:53] actually take time to read it
[1:42:55] church God help
[1:42:58] us the the the gospel brother Brenham
[1:43:02] says commonly believed is the word of
[1:43:05] God and that is true in one
[1:43:08] sense but the word of God is Not gospel
[1:43:13] alone the word of God is the seed that
[1:43:17] produces the gospel okay amen Ephesians
[1:43:21] 6:12 says for we wrestle not against
[1:43:24] flesh and blood but against
[1:43:26] principalities against Powers against
[1:43:29] rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:43:31] against spiritual weaknesses in high
[1:43:32] places wherefore take unto you the whole
[1:43:36] armor of God that ye may be able to
[1:43:39] withand in the evil day having and
[1:43:43] having done all to
[1:43:46] stand remember say when you can't do no
[1:43:48] more you just keep
[1:43:50] standed when's got going to do it I
[1:43:52] don't know but I'm going to keep
[1:43:53] standing on his
[1:43:54] word it gets worse that the world gets
[1:43:57] worse and worse but I'm going to keep
[1:43:59] standing on God's word
[1:44:01] church you know when we were growing up
[1:44:03] my parents did not want to send us to
[1:44:04] elementary school this was back in
[1:44:06] 1968 you know why cuz the schools were
[1:44:09] perverted they

[1:44:14] perverted my parents they were so so so
[1:44:16] in tune with God that you know back in
[1:44:17] 68 going to school was a
[1:44:20] perversion but they committed us in into
[1:44:23] the hands of the Lord and we went to
[1:44:25] school you know and we did pretty good
[1:44:28] yeah I never got whacked in
[1:44:30] school cuz if I got whacked in school
[1:44:32] I'd get whacked at home and you know
[1:44:34] what I I did pretty good because I had
[1:44:35] good parents that instilled in us the
[1:44:37] things of God so I I managed to graduate
[1:44:39] through high school 12 years did pretty
[1:44:41] good never got into a
[1:44:43] fight never I got picked on many times
[1:44:46] but I always had a bodyguard that would
[1:44:47] stand up and say before you whack wiow
[1:44:50] you whack me first they would say so I
[1:44:52] never had to fight fight I'm like yeah
[1:44:53] it's a good thing cuz I have whooped
[1:44:55] him and then when my grandkids or my
[1:44:58] kids were born I thought wow schools are
[1:45:02] perverted now I got to send my kids to
[1:45:04] school how do I do it and we we brought
[1:45:07] them before the church and we prayed
[1:45:08] said Lord we commit our children into
[1:45:10] your hands they're going to school
[1:45:12] father watch over them in this perverse
[1:45:15] generation you know what my kid
[1:45:18] graduated through school did pretty good
[1:45:20] never got into a
[1:45:21] fight and then the grandkids came
[1:45:26] oh where now you can pick what sex you
[1:45:29] want to be H you know what my wife did
[1:45:34] called my oldest son my oldest grandson
[1:45:36] say m Come here grandma wants to talk to
[1:45:37] you and made him standing right there
[1:45:39] and she says Mi listen to me listen to
[1:45:42] me you are a
[1:45:47] boy amen repeat after me what are you
[1:45:50] I'm a boy that's right you you are a
[1:45:55] boy why because the school are so
[1:45:58] perverted
[1:45:59] now amen and they have more rights than
[1:46:02] you do that's right huh and and if you
[1:46:05] talk about about them you can get in
[1:46:09] trouble you see how the world is
[1:46:12] changing it's getting worse and worse
[1:46:15] it's getting darker and darker
[1:46:17] church but you know what hasn't
[1:46:19] changed the word of God he said says I
[1:46:23] am still the same yesterday today and
[1:46:26] forever and if you live to be 100 years
[1:46:29] old and you die guess what on the day
[1:46:32] you die he's still the same
[1:46:34] yesterday today and forever he don't
[1:46:37] change
[1:46:39] church amen we we're living in a evil
[1:46:43] age brother you know growing up going to
[1:46:45] prayer meeting was easy why you could
[1:46:47] get into the spirit very quick Brother
[1:46:50] people were prayed up youd go to the
[1:46:52] altar everybody would come to the altar
[1:46:53] back in back in those days we'd all come
[1:46:55] to the alar we start praying after a
[1:46:56] while the power would come down and
[1:46:58] there's people speaking in tongues
[1:47:00] crying you know oh glorious glorious
[1:47:02] thing prayer is one of the most glorious
[1:47:04] tools we have church prayer is so is
[1:47:07] precious when you can be shutting with
[1:47:09] God by yourself and just cry out to him
[1:47:10] you know you don't have to use fancy
[1:47:12] words in your Simplicity of your of your
[1:47:14] language you speak to
[1:47:18] him but
[1:47:19] today my God to have prayer meeting it's
[1:47:22] a battle
[1:47:23] just to break through that
[1:47:26] barrier why because the devil knows that
[1:47:29] his time's running out the one that
[1:47:31] doesn't know it is
[1:47:33] us but the devil
[1:47:36] knows and we're living in the last
[1:47:39] hour you know Hebrews 11 3940 it speaks
[1:47:45] of the gentile people you and me this
[1:47:47] morning it
[1:47:49] says and these all having obtained a
[1:47:52] good report support through faith Reed
[1:47:54] not the
[1:47:56] promise when when I look back and I see
[1:47:58] men like Samson men like like like
[1:48:01] Daniel you know was taken as a prison to
[1:48:04] a different country with different laws
[1:48:06] the man had enough Revelation to stand
[1:48:08] on God's word and not be contaminated
[1:48:11] with the things around
[1:48:13] him and and the Bible says God having
[1:48:17] provided something better for
[1:48:20] us that they without us should not be
[1:48:23] made perfect and and when you when you
[1:48:26] stop and see their lives what they live
[1:48:29] like what they went through and then you
[1:48:31] compare it to our life today what have
[1:48:33] we done to deserve this
[1:48:37] church no wonder brother bam says he
[1:48:39] goes H having seen the life that they
[1:48:41] lived how will we stand before him on
[1:48:44] that day with our small
[1:48:46] testimony and be compared to those that
[1:48:49] lived back in those days back then there
[1:48:52] were to the blood of
[1:48:54] animals hello Church the blood of an
[1:48:57] animal the life of the animal couldn't
[1:48:59] return back to the worshipper it was
[1:49:01] animal life but today we are covered
[1:49:03] under the blood of Jesus and that life
[1:49:06] in the blood it returns back to the
[1:49:08] worshipper and it changes him and it
[1:49:10] transforms him and it makes him you know
[1:49:13] people say well I can't be perfect yes
[1:49:15] you can you can be perfect in this hour
[1:49:18] when he lives in you it's no longer you
[1:49:19] living but it's Christ Living in you
[1:49:21] Christ speaking in you you Christ
[1:49:23] working through you
[1:49:25] church
[1:49:27] amen yes you know the Saints in
[1:49:30] Ephesians Church age they did not know
[1:49:32] when the Lord would come for his bride
[1:49:35] but they live for him with that
[1:49:36] expectation that one day he was coming
[1:49:38] for them and guess what the Ephesian age
[1:49:42] it finished and the new age began and
[1:49:46] those Believers had the same hope that
[1:49:48] one day they were going to go into
[1:49:50] Rapture but guess what that age passed
[1:49:55] they left behind a good testimony though
[1:49:57] and the Third Church age the fourth
[1:49:59] Church age the fifth Church age six and
[1:50:01] then we got to the seventh where Jesus
[1:50:05] was on the
[1:50:06] outside yes knocking trying to get back
[1:50:09] into the
[1:50:11] church in this hour God sent a
[1:50:16] prophet
[1:50:18] now it's no wonder that many people
[1:50:20] worship the prophet because they seen
[1:50:22] something in him him right you know when
[1:50:25] you got so much of God in you people are
[1:50:27] going to look at you more than a human
[1:50:28] they're going to look at you as a
[1:50:29] God but BR Bram never wanted no one to
[1:50:33] worship him he always pointed us to
[1:50:35] Jesus Christ I I had a Apostolic ask me
[1:50:38] one day I went for a walk in one of the
[1:50:40] parks by her house and I was walking
[1:50:42] getting some exercises and I happened to
[1:50:44] run to her and her son and she asked me
[1:50:46] uh brother Castile can I ask you a
[1:50:47] question like yes sister ask me a
[1:50:49] question she goes do you guys pray in
[1:50:51] brother brenham's name I said what
[1:50:54] where'd you get that from do do you
[1:50:57] baptize I go what where'd you get that
[1:50:59] from I said sister I go you know my dad
[1:51:02] better than
[1:51:03] that my dad fell in love with Jesus long
[1:51:07] time ago I go and this Prophet that God
[1:51:09] sent in this last hour he's always
[1:51:11] pointed us back to Jesus Christ you know
[1:51:14] he's never been about himself he always
[1:51:16] point to Jesus Christ find me a message
[1:51:18] where brother Brandon boasts about
[1:51:19] himself you'll never find a church he
[1:51:22] always pointed back to Jesus Christ I
[1:51:24] said sister he always pointed back to
[1:51:25] Jesus Christ because throughout the ages
[1:51:28] religion got watered down they put Jesus
[1:51:30] outside but God in his grace sent a
[1:51:33] prophet to point us back to Jesus to get
[1:51:36] us back on track I said we don't worship
[1:51:39] no man we you know M man failure but
[1:51:43] it's God that we worship that's in that
[1:51:45] man amen like he should be in every one
[1:51:47] of us this morning Christ in you Christ
[1:51:50] in me the the hope of Glory Church
[1:51:53] the reason for the
[1:51:56] season you look at our world today and
[1:52:00] they came up with a guy called The
[1:52:01] Grinch I never saw the Grinch in the
[1:52:03] manger where where did he come from but
[1:52:06] the world has gone so commercialized
[1:52:07] today that they they they've created
[1:52:09] create creatures to
[1:52:11] replace the one and only creation
[1:52:15] Christ how would you feel if you if you
[1:52:19] came from the last Church age or the
[1:52:22] third Church age or the first church age
[1:52:24] or the sixth or the fourth or the 5ifth
[1:52:26] and the Lord would tell you even though
[1:52:29] you have been
[1:52:30] faithful he would tell you this promise
[1:52:34] is not for you it's for the last Church
[1:52:37] age how would you
[1:52:40] feel and he would say because I have a
[1:52:42] group at the end time that must first
[1:52:45] come and be made
[1:52:47] perfect with this
[1:52:49] message you know never consider yourself
[1:52:52] better than anybody else brother Braham
[1:52:55] says remain remain humble be humble amen
[1:52:59] don't don't boast of what what you can
[1:53:01] do keep keep keep in your Simplicity and
[1:53:03] God honor Simplicity the the the one of
[1:53:05] the biggest examples that we have was
[1:53:07] brother
[1:53:08] brandham you know find me a man today
[1:53:11] that called any Scrolls into
[1:53:14] existence find me a man that that that
[1:53:16] stopped the
[1:53:17] storm huh find me man today where God
[1:53:19] told him would you like to walk with me
[1:53:23] how would you feel one morning you woke
[1:53:24] up and you heard a voice that says would
[1:53:26] you like to walk with me today huj what
[1:53:30] would you say well can we go after
[1:53:34] breakfast I got a schedule no brother if
[1:53:36] the Lord speaks to you drop
[1:53:39] everything and walk with him because
[1:53:42] that's what he's telling us today walk
[1:53:44] with me even though you're living in the
[1:53:46] most terrible time it's a glorious time
[1:53:48] because in this hour I am coming for a
[1:53:51] bride
[1:53:52] I will have a bride in this last hour
[1:53:56] church but yet God in his grace let us
[1:54:00] be part of Malachi 45 who would have
[1:54:02] thought that we'd be part of Malachi 45
[1:54:04] in this last
[1:54:05] hour huh think about that God was going
[1:54:08] to have a bride in this last hour and
[1:54:10] I'm part of that bride what did I do God
[1:54:12] having provided something better thing
[1:54:15] for us that they without us should not
[1:54:18] be made perfect in other words they're
[1:54:20] waiting for us Church H they've been
[1:54:24] waiting a long
[1:54:25] time they've been waiting a long time
[1:54:27] for us to get ready
[1:54:29] church and I don't know what it's going
[1:54:30] to take it's unfortunate that it takes a
[1:54:34] squeeze to draw Us close
[1:54:36] together have you notice that whenever
[1:54:38] there's a death in the family all of a
[1:54:40] sudden everybody's there oh Primo I love
[1:54:43] you I love you too
[1:54:45] bro even though I haven't seen you in 10
[1:54:49] years and And yet when when when the
[1:54:51] squeeze comes that's the time to unite
[1:54:53] the people why it takes it I don't know
[1:54:56] but that's what it's going to take to
[1:54:57] unite the bride church it's going to
[1:54:59] take a
[1:55:01] squeeze that without us they should not
[1:55:03] be made perfect perfected with what with
[1:55:06] a sound Doctrine the word of God amen
[1:55:09] amen everything you need to know is in
[1:55:11] the word of God I I I I I tell you that
[1:55:14] that if you're that if you're feeling
[1:55:15] lonely you're feeling depressed hear a
[1:55:18] message if you feel like you're sick you
[1:55:20] can't make it the burden too great hear
[1:55:22] message if you feel like you're alone
[1:55:24] nobody loves you hear a
[1:55:26] message because to me it's nothing but
[1:55:28] love church for his children this hour
[1:55:31] and we have access to it any hour of the
[1:55:34] day you don't have to wait till tape
[1:55:35] service on Wednesday to hear a tape hear
[1:55:37] one tomorrow hear one
[1:55:40] tonight when you're cleaning the house
[1:55:42] when you're ironing hear a message I
[1:55:45] have a sister in the church who every
[1:55:47] day all day long listens to
[1:55:50] messages like don't you anything better
[1:55:52] to do than listen to messages
[1:55:55] no and then when you come to church when
[1:55:57] she goes to church I see the difference
[1:56:00] a worshiper the the woman's going blind
[1:56:02] from one eye she she's really able to
[1:56:04] walk but she still got Strength In Her
[1:56:06] Arms to do this she can still sing even
[1:56:10] though she can't see the screen she can
[1:56:11] still sing she can still say praise the
[1:56:14] Lord thank you Jesus she can still cry
[1:56:16] out in her condition why because she's
[1:56:19] standing on something that's solid her
[1:56:21] hope is not in her health it's not in
[1:56:23] her vision it's in how she walks
[1:56:25] whatever her hope is in here that one
[1:56:27] day she'll be transformed from a mortal
[1:56:30] to an immortality to live with her
[1:56:33] Savior Jesus
[1:56:35] forever and when I see her as a pastor
[1:56:40] she inspires
[1:56:41] me she in inspires you Pastor you're the
[1:56:44] pastor yes when I see people that are
[1:56:46] struggling in the church that that are
[1:56:47] worshiping they're crying it moves me
[1:56:50] because I see that the humanity is
[1:56:52] crying out for something greater and
[1:56:53] they're in the best place to be the
[1:56:55] house of God
[1:56:59] church amen how did Jesus defeat Satan
[1:57:04] with the
[1:57:06] word if you're Jesus you know go up
[1:57:08] there and jump from The Pinacle and your
[1:57:10] angel will will will save you that no
[1:57:11] one's scrash will come upon you what did
[1:57:13] Jesus say well I could have done that
[1:57:15] easy but he said it is
[1:57:18] written my word is written
[1:57:24] veram says now we find him as soon as
[1:57:26] God Came Upon him he was anointed went
[1:57:28] into the Wilderness and out for 40 days
[1:57:31] and defeated Satan by the word of
[1:57:34] God what did he do he brought any Divine
[1:57:38] promise in reach of the weakest
[1:57:44] Christian well I'm not a weak chrisan
[1:57:46] I've been in this message 40 years
[1:57:47] you're still a weak Christian cuz you
[1:57:49] haven't left yet that's
[1:57:51] right we haven't gone the Rapture
[1:57:54] yet he brought any Divine promise in
[1:57:57] reach of the Wiest Christian if he was
[1:58:00] God why did he let Satan say or Satan
[1:58:03] say if thou be the Son of God perform a
[1:58:08] miracle here and show me you can do it
[1:58:12] turn these stones into bread and eat
[1:58:16] them you think Jesus could have done it
[1:58:19] sure he could have not only just bread
[1:58:22] but cinnamon
[1:58:23] rolls with a cup of coffee here you here
[1:58:27] extra but no he said it is written man
[1:58:31] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:58:33] every word every word that proceeds from
[1:58:38] the mouth of
[1:58:41] God so then as Satan always tries to
[1:58:44] quot the
[1:58:45] word went back and told him when he put
[1:58:48] him on the Pinnacle of the temple he
[1:58:50] said and Jesus responded it is
[1:58:54] written and he defeated Satan on the
[1:58:57] word of God what's going to defeat him
[1:59:00] today Church the word of God but not the
[1:59:03] word of God in the Shelf it's got to be
[1:59:05] the word of God in
[1:59:06] you because it's okay to have the word
[1:59:08] of God there in your house with the open
[1:59:10] up to certain scripture it's nice yeah

[1:59:31] Satan this is Brother Bram speaking and
[1:59:33] who's speaking to brother brandham who's
[1:59:35] speaking through him

[1:59:42] Satan on the word of God no matter the
[1:59:46] word of God will defeat Satan any
[1:59:50] place anywhere under any conditions if

[1:59:58] cancer or if it's laying Yonder bleeding
[2:00:00] to death in an automobile
[2:00:03] accident the word of God will defeat
[2:00:05] Satan anywhere that's right and the
[2:00:08] weakest Christian can use

[2:00:19] today well I'm an American it's my right
[2:00:22] you really don't have a
[2:00:23] right but as a Christian we have a right
[2:00:27] to God's word that even the Wiest
[2:00:29] Christian can use it because it's a
[2:00:31] god-given
[2:00:34] privilege glory to his name you know the

[2:02:34] he got up and he scolded us I used to
[2:02:36] hate getting scolded I still don't like
[2:02:38] it when my wife and my daughter calledo
[2:02:40] me dad you did it wrong oh
[2:02:46] sorry and my dad said my dad got up
[2:02:49] before the church one day and he said I
[2:02:50] have preached from
[2:02:52] Genesis to Revelations I have preached
[2:02:55] from Revelations to Genesis and you
[2:02:58] still can't get it he told
[2:03:00] us he was whacking us from the pullit he
[2:03:04] said what I'm going to do he said for
[2:03:05] one year he goes we're going to listen
[2:03:07] to brother bram's tapes for one whole
[2:03:09] year in this church and back in 2010 we
[2:03:12] heard tapes of brother brandham on
[2:03:14] Sunday and on Wednesday and the next
[2:03:16] Sunday brother bandham again on
[2:03:19] Wednesday brother B again for a whole
[2:03:21] year we heard brother brand and people
[2:03:22] thought we had converted to tapes only
[2:03:25] but they didn't realize the pro that
[2:03:26] that that the pastor did it for a
[2:03:29] reason because he wanted us to be held
[2:03:32] accountable that on that day we would
[2:03:34] have no
[2:03:35] excuse church we have no
[2:03:38] excuse we've heard it all amen we've
[2:03:41] read it all amen we've gone to many
[2:03:44] church services we've heard God preach
[2:03:45] and speak to us we'll have no excuses
[2:03:48] and he told us at the end of the year
[2:03:50] then I'll start preaching again
[2:03:52] and so for a whole year brother BR him
[2:03:55] in our
[2:03:57] church we got criticized but you know
[2:03:59] what the pastor will have to answer for
[2:04:00] that that was his doing and I'm glad he
[2:04:02] did it amen because there's no greater
[2:04:05] voice to hear than the prophet that's
[2:04:08] why when I preach I'm always quoting
[2:04:10] from the prophet where else I'm going to
[2:04:13] get my message from if not from the
[2:04:14] prophet the message of the
[2:04:15] hour and then at the end of 2010 on
[2:04:19] January the 1st when he got to the
[2:04:20] pulpit he started preaching a message
[2:04:22] entitled
[2:04:24] unconcerned and talk about getting
[2:04:26] quacked
[2:04:28] again and he even told in that message
[2:04:31] that he was leaving and no one paid
[2:04:34] attention to that and he preached
[2:04:36] unconcerned three times and then the
[2:04:39] Lord took him
[2:04:42] home why because he had a burden in his
[2:04:45] heart for the people that they had to
[2:04:48] get stable or they have to stand on this
[2:04:51] word of God and he always pointed us to
[2:04:53] the word of God and he was so Adam that
[2:04:55] that that that we come to church why are
[2:04:58] we here we're here to get fed
[2:04:59] spiritually so we can grow spiritually
[2:05:01] because we all want to go home
[2:05:05] church
[2:05:06] amen we should leave in the house of God
[2:05:09] happy not
[2:05:11] condemned or sad we should leave the
[2:05:14] house of God happy knowing that God is
[2:05:16] speaking to us in this last hour even in
[2:05:18] dreams God speaks to us church I was I I
[2:05:21] uh one of the brothers from the church
[2:05:23] sent me a video of a of a 88y old woman
[2:05:27] who was in the late stages of
[2:05:29] dementia and they asked this woman in
[2:05:32] the video they asked her if she knew
[2:05:33] what her address was and she said um no
[2:05:37] I don't know where I live
[2:05:39] at and they asked her well do you know
[2:05:41] what you ate last night and she was like
[2:05:44] uh no I don't know what I ate last night
[2:05:46] an 88y old
[2:05:48] woman and they asked her well do you
[2:05:50] know who Linda is and she's like uh um
[2:05:53] Linda no I don't know who Linda is well
[2:05:55] do you know who Paul is no I don't know
[2:05:58] who Paul
[2:05:59] is and they asked her well do you know
[2:06:02] Jesus and she said oh he's the one that
[2:06:05] died for
[2:06:07] me and he lives in my heart and one day
[2:06:12] he's going to take me
[2:06:13] home I thought wow forget the
[2:06:18] world forget your family not in a bad
[2:06:20] way forget everything in life forget how
[2:06:23] much money you have in the bank and
[2:06:25] don't ever forget Jesus though because
[2:06:28] when you come to the end of your life
[2:06:30] that's all that's going to matter
[2:06:32] brother is this in
[2:06:34] you when you're breathing your last
[2:06:36] breath you're not going to be thinking
[2:06:38] about oh my inheritance my my my my
[2:06:40] properties no you're going to be
[2:06:42] thinking Lord I'm going to see you soon
[2:06:45] I'm going to see you soon Lord Jesus it
[2:06:47] be the most glorious hour for
[2:06:49] you why Christ Living in
[2:06:55] you uh the the the definition of song
[2:06:57] Doctrine in closing is sound Doctrine is
[2:07:01] teaching it's it's it's a teaching that
[2:07:04] rightly explains what God has revealed
[2:07:06] to us in his work B is what sound
[2:07:08] Doctrine is sound Doctrine is essential
[2:07:11] to the church and to a Christian life
[2:07:14] because our founder who is Jesus
[2:07:18] Christ left for us an empty tomb
[2:07:23] because it is a central means of which
[2:07:25] we grow to maturity in Christ and the
[2:07:29] more you have of Christ the more you
[2:07:31] grow to be like Christ after a while
[2:07:33] that's all you think about is Christ and
[2:07:36] about getting home one day and you and
[2:07:38] you prepare yourself to get ready for
[2:07:39] that glorious day when you are going
[2:07:41] home church when whenever I preach at a
[2:07:44] funeral service it's not for the dead
[2:07:45] person it's for the ones that are still
[2:07:47] alive and I tell them this is to remind
[2:07:50] us that one day we too will be here amen
[2:07:54] and that's all right death is all right
[2:07:56] if you're ready to go meet the Lord my
[2:07:58] mother had a meeting with her
[2:08:00] sons about five months ago and she told
[2:08:05] us here is all my will my death papers
[2:08:10] who's going to get what what what what's
[2:08:12] going to go to you when when the death
[2:08:13] comes when the time comes where I want
[2:08:15] to be buried that uh the funeral Serv
[2:08:17] who's going to speak and she says and
[2:08:19] she goes if I I I'm start to die and and
[2:08:22] and and I die do not resuscitate me she
[2:08:27] said do not bring me back to life she
[2:08:30] said leave me alone because all my life
[2:08:35] I have prepared for this
[2:08:38] moment I thought wow what what words of
[2:08:42] a mother that all her life she's
[2:08:43] prepared for what to go meet her savior
[2:08:46] Lord Jesus
[2:08:48] Christ the word will do that church in
[2:08:50] you if the word is in you that's what
[2:08:52] you'll live for not for your next
[2:08:54] promotion not for your next you know
[2:08:56] brand new car you know you know when I
[2:08:57] was growing up and they were preaching
[2:08:59] Jesus is coming I used to think man I'm
[2:09:00] never going to get married Jesus is
[2:09:03] coming it's not
[2:09:06] fair then I became a teenager and you
[2:09:08] know and then I fell in love with my
[2:09:10] wife and we got married and I thought
[2:09:12] and we're still preaching Jesus is
[2:09:13] coming I'm thinking well I'm never going
[2:09:15] to have children Jesus is coming now I
[2:09:18] got three children and then we're still
[2:09:20] preaching Jesus is coming and I thought
[2:09:22] I'll never have grandchildren now I got
[2:09:24] two of them and guess what we're still
[2:09:28] preaching Jesus is
[2:09:30] coming but you know what it's closer now
[2:09:35] than when it was when we began our
[2:09:37] journey the first
[2:09:39] time amen you know sometimes some of my
[2:09:42] most inspired messages come at 1:00 in
[2:09:44] the morning when I'm laying in bed and
[2:09:47] and I'm talking to the Lord in in
[2:09:49] Simplicity because I I don't try to be
[2:09:51] fancy I just started be my Simplicity
[2:09:53] with with him and I begin to speak to
[2:09:54] the Lord in in in in there at 1:00 2:00
[2:09:57] in the morning and and and in and
[2:09:59] speaking in Simplicity to the Lord I I
[2:10:02] begin to feel his presence and I start
[2:10:05] to
[2:10:07] cry because I'm thinking about his word
[2:10:10] at 1 2 o'clock in the morning you know
[2:10:12] and and I I'm trying to be quiet because
[2:10:13] my wife is you know sleeping next to me
[2:10:15] and and and I don't want to wake up and
[2:10:17] I just stay I just cry and like wow what
[2:10:19] a blessing when we can find ourselves in
[2:10:22] Heavenly places when you can realize
[2:10:23] that nothing matters around you but his
[2:10:25] word his hope that he gives to us
[2:10:28] nothing matters in the world but living
[2:10:29] for him
[2:10:34] church one day it's all going to come to
[2:10:37] an nend church one day the last message
[2:10:40] will be preached maybe from this Pulpit
[2:10:43] maybe the last day will come when
[2:10:45] there'll be no more churches open and
[2:10:47] you better have enough of Christ in you
[2:10:50] to endure that squeeze church because by
[2:10:53] yourself will not make it Christ has to
[2:10:57] be in
[2:11:00] us what is endure it is lasting over a
[2:11:03] period of time it's durable to endure to
[2:11:06] to be able to withstand the the trials
[2:11:08] of Life the the hardship of Life endure
[2:11:10] them a sound Doctrine the bride will
[2:11:14] know her
[2:11:15] word she will know her Jesus the world
[2:11:18] cannot deceive the bride neither can
[2:11:20] Satan de deceive the bride this is why
[2:11:23] it's so important to know where you
[2:11:24] stand and if your doctrine that you
[2:11:27] believe is
[2:11:28] sound amen there's nothing wrong with
[2:11:30] the the the word of God God sent his
[2:11:33] word and then he sent a message and this
[2:11:37] message points to the word of God and
[2:11:39] this word of God points to the message
[2:11:41] there is no confusion there there's a
[2:11:43] lot of things I don't understand I can't
[2:11:45] explain but I believe it why did God do
[2:11:48] it a certain way I don't know but his
[2:11:51] plans are
[2:11:53] perfect amen God's plans are perfect and
[2:11:56] all I can do is stand on the word of
[2:11:59] God let me say this in
[2:12:04] closing the end time
[2:12:06] messenger and the message should meet
[2:12:09] the end time conditions don't you think
[2:12:12] so the pram says that the end time
[2:12:14] message and the conditions they have to
[2:12:17] meet the end time
[2:12:19] conditions the message could not have
[2:12:21] been preached 40 years ago no no the end
[2:12:26] time message and the messenger has got
[2:12:28] to meet back there in them days they had
[2:12:31] it probably it wouldn't have worked but
[2:12:33] it's got to cope with end time
[2:12:36] conditions be converted believe the
[2:12:39] gospel signs that's the message of today
[2:12:42] wash your souls in the blood of the lamb
[2:12:47] and believe the gospel that the end time
[2:12:50] signs are here

[2:35:21] bottom the the whole floor is out up to
[2:35:23] the ceiling it's all getting kind of
