[8:17] Works Glory ye in His holy name let the
[8:21] hearts of them that Rejoice that seek
[8:25] the Lord seek the Lord and his strength
[8:29] seek his face Evermore remember His
[8:32] Marvelous works that he has done his
[8:36] wonders and his judgments of his mouth
[8:40] oh ye Seed of Abraham his servant ye
[8:44] children of Jacob his chosen he is the
[8:47] Lord Our God his judgments are in all
[8:51] the
[8:52] Earth he has remembered his Covenant
[8:55] forever the word which he commanded to a
[8:59] thousand
[9:00] generation which Covenant he made with
[9:03] Abraham and his oath unto Isaac and
[9:06] confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law
[9:09] and to Israel for an Everlasting
[9:12] Covenant saying unto thee will I give
[9:16] the land of Canaan the lot of your
[9:21] inheritance when they that
[9:25] when when they were but a few men in
[9:28] number yay very few and strangers in it
[9:33] when they went forth from one nation to
[9:37] another and from one Kingdom to another
[9:40] he suffered no man to do them
[9:44] wrong yay he reprove Kings for their
[9:48] sake saying touch not my anointed and do
[9:52] my prophets no more
[9:54] hallelujah praise our God I want to take
[9:58] a a subject from there of
[10:04] respects reading here David crying out
[10:07] to the
[10:08] Lord
[10:10] respects is what we owe to
[10:13] God and that's one thing that I would
[10:16] like to uh drill this to the heart of
[10:20] every person here tonight that in all
[10:24] things that we see going on we must give
[10:26] respects to it amen we must respect
[10:31] it and David said that when they were
[10:35] very few men of Israel perhaps Abraham
[10:38] Isaac and Jacob who is speaking on very
[10:42] few men that he rebuked Nations and
[10:46] Kings for them God rebuked the Nations
[10:49] and Kings saying touch not my anointed
[10:52] and do my profits no
[10:54] harm over in Ecclesiastes the 12th
[10:57] chapter and the 13th verse it's written
[10:59] like this see let us share the
[11:02] conclusion of the whole matter fear God
[11:05] and keep his Commandments for this is
[11:07] the full duty of man the conclusion of
[11:10] the whole matter is to fear
[11:12] God and when you cannot have respect
[11:16] until you have fear you've got to have
[11:19] fear of God Solomon said also in the
[11:23] Proverbs that the fear of God is the
[11:26] beginning of wisdom amen the fear of God
[11:30] is the beginning of wisdom now that
[11:33] don't mean that you're afraid of him but
[11:35] that means that you're giving him
[11:37] respects and
[11:38] reverence and when you respect God you
[11:42] fear God you fear that you might
[11:44] displease him in some way you fear L you
[11:47] would do something wrong you wouldn't
[11:50] want to I fear my mother I fear my my
[11:54] wife I fear my church I fear all of
[11:58] God's servants unless un I should put a
[11:59] stumbling BLX somewhere in their
[12:01] way I fear the people I fear the people
[12:05] of the city unless I should do something
[12:07] wrong that would cause them to think
[12:10] that I wasn't a Christian see you've got
[12:13] before you can have respect you've got
[12:15] to have fear and God demands it he
[12:20] demands
[12:21] respects God does he demands it and fear
[12:25] brings it and we know that fear brings
[12:29] respects now you take for instance a man
[12:32] he's a farmer or maybe he's a a shop
[12:35] worker and uh nobody pays any attention
[12:37] to him but let him get a job on the
[12:39] police force and come down the street as
[12:43] a a policeman with his badge and uniform
[12:45] on or maybe someone wouldn't speak to
[12:48] him the day before hello there John how
[12:50] are you see why is it it's kind of an
[12:52] awe our fear our
[12:55] respect because of it maybe he gets
[12:57] elected to be the mayor of the
[13:00] or maybe who would President Kennedy
[13:02] tonight be if he wasn't President
[13:04] Kennedy what if he was just a same man
[13:07] he is but yet he was a worker worked at
[13:09] col Gates down here for uh $40 a week
[13:12] see he'd come through the city here and
[13:14] nobody would pay much attention to him
[13:16] on his own Associates but being he's a
[13:17] president of the United States he
[13:19] deserves a respect you see and that and
[13:22] because that God is God am he deserves a
[13:26] respect that's right Hallelujah and he
[13:30] we've got to respect him and give a fear
[13:32] to him and that brings respect God has
[13:34] demanded that for himself and for all
[13:37] his servants amen God demands respect
[13:40] for his servants he uh his servants how
[13:44] we know that they are his servants
[13:46] because he vindicates these servants by
[13:49] his word he takes these servants and
[13:52] makes them Servants of God and proves
[13:54] that they are servants by making his
[13:57] word work through them servants
[13:59] then as you respect that servant you
[14:01] respect God so when I respect you and
[14:04] you respect me and we respect each other
[14:07] then we're respecting God did not Jesus
[14:09] say in so much as you have done un the
[14:11] least of these my little ones you have
[14:13] done it unto me and it would be better
[14:15] for you that a millstone was hanged at
[14:17] your neck and you were drowned in the
[14:19] depths of the sea than to offend one of
[14:20] them where I say you behold their FA
[14:23] Angels always beholds my father's face
[14:26] which is in heaven now we know that they
[14:29] are that we being children of God that
[14:32] we are a part of God and God demands
[14:36] this respects then God shows who his
[14:39] children are he he shows it by wonders
[14:42] and signs and that it's been done now
[14:46] we're going to start now and call into
[14:48] question some of these
[14:50] people now if I was going to say for one
[14:53] to start with I think of of let's take
[14:56] Noah for a moment now Noah had a
[14:59] revelation from God yet it was contrary
[15:02] to anything that science would prove to
[15:04] be true but yet he had spoke to God and
[15:08] God had spoke to him and he went about
[15:11] preparing an ark where the scoffers and
[15:14] mockers as the Bible said that they
[15:16] would be in the last days like it was in
[15:18] them days that those
[15:20] scoffers scoffed at Noah well they
[15:23] thought that he was out of his head
[15:25] because he was building an ark so but
[15:29] God brought judgment upon them
[15:33] scoffers because they would not listen
[15:36] to the messenger of God and come into
[15:40] that Ark under his preaching then God
[15:44] sent his Divine judgments on the earth
[15:46] first he made a preparation for all who
[15:48] would receive it to escape it and then
[15:51] if they did not Escape it there's only
[15:53] one thing left if they won't take God's
[15:56] preparation of Escape then there's only
[15:58] one thing that's Divine judgment amen
[16:01] you can only do two things it lays
[16:03] either Mercy or judgment you have to
[16:06] accept one of the other that's where we
[16:08] stand tonight we either take God's mercy
[16:11] or we stand his judgment there's just no
[16:13] way of getting around it God always
[16:16] makes a way of Escape for those who
[16:18] desire to escape then he's got what's
[16:21] left over has to stand the Judgment not
[16:23] because of God wants them to but because
[16:26] they have chosen that way themselves see
[16:29] they make their own choice that's where
[16:31] we stand tonight friends the same thing
[16:33] we can either take God's way of Escape
[16:36] or we can stand in judgments either one
[16:37] we want to do aren't you happy tonight
[16:41] that you have tucked the way of Escape
[16:43] amen because all that refuse the way of
[16:47] Escape will have to come under judgment
[16:50] then there is another man I'd like to
[16:52] speak
[16:53] of that was a great Mighty Prophet by
[16:56] the name of Moses the people Israel
[16:59] should have understood according to the
[17:01] scripture that God was going to deliver
[17:04] them and was going to bring them out of
[17:07] Egypt but as soon as God got his man
[17:11] ready and sent him down into Egypt they
[17:14] had no respects for
[17:16] him they turned him out and said will
[17:19] you slay us as you did the Egyptian
[17:21] which caused them to stay in bondage uh
[17:25] extra 40 years they stayed in bondage
[17:28] because they refuse to respect the
[17:32] deliverer that come to deliver
[17:35] them that put them back in bondage
[17:37] again not because God wanted to stay the
[17:41] time was exactly right but they stayed
[17:43] 40 years over because they refuse to
[17:47] accept God's provided way of
[17:49] Escape how I believe that that's what's
[17:52] the matter tonight same thing see that
[17:56] they refuse the way out and and God was
[17:59] determined and had told Abraham and them
[18:02] in his Covenant as we read David singing
[18:04] of it tonight he had promis them that he
[18:07] was going to do a certain thing so God's
[18:09] going to keep his
[18:11] promise he was going to bring him out
[18:13] anyhow but perhaps nearly another
[18:15] generation died off the old generation
[18:17] laughed at Moses and so forth and would
[18:20] not accept the message that generation
[18:22] 40 years died off and Moses come into
[18:24] another
[18:26] generation see what I mean if they don't
[18:29] accept it then God will let that
[18:31] generation die out and he'll bring in
[18:33] another generation to do it amen so they
[18:36] had refused it and then we find out this
[18:39] next Generation to come up when Moses
[18:42] went down there to vindicate himself you
[18:45] know Moses was scared to go down again
[18:48] Moses is 80 years old now and he' been
[18:50] gone 40 years and when he talked to God
[18:53] at the burning bush he said who will I
[18:55] tell them it sent me God had no name
[18:59] he said who will I tell them that sent
[19:01] me so I say the god of your fathers
[19:04] appeared to me they'll say who is the
[19:06] god of our fathers well what do I tell
[19:08] him he said you tell them that I am that
[19:11] I
[19:12] am you tell them that I am that I am all
[19:16] that and he said what is that in your
[19:18] hand Moses he said a thick and he threw
[19:19] it down and turned into a serpent he put
[19:22] his hand in his bull turned to leprosy
[19:23] and went back and healed he said go down
[19:26] and take these signs and perform them
[19:28] them before the people and it'll be an
[19:31] Vindication they'll know by these signs
[19:34] that I sent you for deliverance amen oh
[19:38] brother Hallelujah God always does that
[19:42] God always gives Supernatural signs see
[19:46] and now when he came down and called the
[19:49] people and done his signs before them
[19:52] all Israel believ every one of them and
[19:55] they went right straight to the Palace
[19:57] the for deliverance and then the Pharaoh
[20:00] decided he would not give him
[20:02] deliverance and God turned judgment
[20:04] loose on pharaoh and we know what
[20:07] happened in Egypt strange after they had
[20:10] seen all those signs happen and then
[20:12] they come to the Red Sea and found out
[20:15] that the very God that performed all
[20:17] those signs here at the Red Sea doubted
[20:20] God the very first thing that he was
[20:22] able to make a way of
[20:24] Escape now there's where we make our
[20:27] mistakes one of little sickness strikes
[20:29] us one a little disaster a little
[20:31] trouble strikes somewhere in a way then
[20:34] we go to Falling Away a young convert
[20:36] somebody will make fun of him and say
[20:37] well you ain't nothing but a Holy Roller
[20:39] well I hate to be called a Holy Roller
[20:42] you see see there you are you get that
[20:43] doubt that's the time to stand there
[20:46] amen that's the time to respect the
[20:49] messenger that's the time to to give
[20:52] glory to God hallelujah and Moses said
[20:56] I've done these already 10 10 Miracles
[20:59] before you God's give you 10 Miracles
[21:02] and then you're afraid of to see
[21:04] certainly how much more would it take
[21:06] for you to believe hallu he walked back
[21:10] and stuck his rod and held it before the
[21:12] Sea and the storms came down and blo
[21:14] across the other side and they went
[21:16] across and as soon as he got over there
[21:18] immediately be to complain they had no
[21:21] bread just same thing then God rain
[21:24] bread out of heavens for then they
[21:26] complained they had no water and just
[21:29] one complain after another and I noticed
[21:32] you say well maybe they were the
[21:34] unconverted type well maybe they were
[21:37] there was a mixed multitude went with
[21:39] them true but I want to bring another
[21:41] thing into your uh into your remembrance
[21:44] if God sent the messenger and Vindicated
[21:48] by the signs that he was a messenger
[21:50] sent from God then it's up to them to
[21:53] obey this messenger amen exactly they
[21:56] must obey the messenger GL right and
[22:00] have respects to that messenger look at
[22:03] Joshua and Caleb they stayed right by
[22:05] his side amen yes sir whatever Moses in
[22:08] they was in it too whether Moses right
[22:10] or wrong they stayed right with him
[22:12] anyhow see because they know that was
[22:14] God's messenger and there one day we
[22:17] find out that even Mariam a
[22:21] prophet and Aaron the high priest made
[22:25] fun of moses' wife
[22:28] because she was an Ethiopian and thought
[22:31] was there enough women of our own group
[22:34] to marry instead of going down there and
[22:35] marrying that woman that wasn't Moses
[22:38] choice that was God's choice for Moses
[22:41] amen and when they made fun of it that
[22:45] angered God in such a
[22:47] way until he struck maram the prophecies
[22:50] full of leprosy Moses's own sister what
[22:54] about that her a prophet
[22:59] but what was she doing she was making
[23:02] fun in an ear reverence to God's
[23:04] messenger amen the messenger of the
[23:07] Covenant of that day and she was
[23:10] irreverent and also Aaron the high
[23:13] priest the very mouth Tee of Moses yeah
[23:17] right he was with her and Aaron then
[23:21] when he saw his sister struck with
[23:23] Leprosy he went in and told Moses would
[23:26] you let your own sister die and Moses
[23:29] went into the Tabernacle and fell before
[23:31] the Lord and be to weep call out for God
[23:35] Mercy for his sister and the spirit of
[23:38] the Lord came down and said call Aaron
[23:41] and maram to stand here before me
[23:44] oh Hallelujah God demands
[23:49] respect God sends his message you listen
[23:52] to it you reverence it don't care if
[23:55] they call it a bunch of holy rulers or
[23:57] whatever they call it let the world do
[23:59] what they want to but you give
[24:00] respects
[24:02] amen so there stood Mariam God said call
[24:05] Mariam and call mooses call Aaron here
[24:08] your brother and sister to stand before
[24:10] me and when they come in before God God
[24:13] said don't you fear
[24:16] God said that to the high priest and to
[24:19] maram the
[24:21] prophet said if there be any A man among
[24:24] you spiritual or prophets I the Lord
[24:26] will make myself known to him I speak to
[24:29] him in Visions reveal myself and dreams
[24:31] to him and so forth if he's spiritual or
[24:33] propit but said my servant Moses I speak
[24:36] lip to ear with
[24:38] him amen said don't you fear God in
[24:42] other words you talk about Moses you're
[24:43] talking about me if you can't respect
[24:46] Moses you don't respect me said haven't
[24:49] I proved among you that he's my servant
[24:52] Hallelujah and you have no reverence for
[24:54] him at all what that would be a lesson
[24:56] for the people of this day oh
[24:59] amen no

[36:16] months Elijah s up on the mountain said
[36:19] not even do a fall till I call
[36:22] from oh how they hated him and when he
[36:26] they had found him he said you're the
[36:27] one that's troubling Israel are you old

[36:32] not me but you're the one that's
[36:33] troubling Israel that's right even Ahab
[36:37] didn't have respect for him you know
[36:39] what Elijah told Ahab said because you
[36:42] shed the innocent blood of neot so the
[36:44] dogs will lick your blood too in the
[36:46] street and they did amen because they
[36:51] disrespected God's
[36:53] messenger exactly right they
[36:55] disrespected it now
[36:58] Mariam disrespected it Aaron
[37:01] disrespected it no matter who you are
[37:04] Christian are not Christian you've got
[37:06] to still bring respects to God and

[37:11] consequence it's either receive it or
[37:14] going into judgment either one you want
[37:16] to how I can stand with testimony for
[37:19] hour after hour of what I've seen in my
[37:21] lifetime what I've seen in any other
[37:23] countries and other parts of the Nations
[37:25] and so forth the things that's taking
[37:27] place place but to Omit that just so
[37:29] that you'll get the the idea of what I'm
[37:31] trying to say to you you must respect it
[37:35] I've seen young people sit in a meeting
[37:37] and snigger and life in a meeting and
[37:39] less than 24 hours be crushed into the
[37:43] streets I've seen young people sat in a
[37:46] meeting in one year when I was in a
[37:48] place and next maybe within six months
[37:50] go back to the same place and
[37:52] practically every one of them was gone
[37:53] or land stricken somewhere with diseases
[37:55] and things
[37:57] yeah that's right you have to respect it
[38:00] remember a certain young girl one night
[38:02] Tennessee and I was going out the door
[38:05] preaching in a big Baptist Church was
[38:07] going out the door I felt led that night
[38:09] to call her to come to Christ well she
[38:12] laughed in my face when I called her to
[38:13] come to Christ she had be one of the
[38:15] Deacon's daughters and stand at the door
[38:17] that night she waited for me and I come
[38:18] out she said I want you to know
[38:21] something right now don't you never
[38:23] embarrass me like that again I said God
[38:25] was calling you she said nonsense sense
[38:28] I'm young so I got plenty of time for
[38:30] that said my Daddy's got enough religion
[38:33] for all of us at home I said not enough
[38:36] for you sister everyone has to have
[38:38] their own religion she said if I want
[38:40] anybody to talk to me about that I'll
[38:41] get somebody's got some sense not
[38:43] somebody like you I said go say what you
[38:45] wish you you don't bother me but someday
[38:48] you'll regret it not long after that
[38:50] passed through the same city here she
[38:52] come down the street with her
[38:53] underskirts hanging down slopping with a
[38:55] cigarette in her hand and offer me a
[38:57] drink a
[38:58] whiskey same thing here's her testimony
[39:01] she said you remember the night you call
[39:03] that said that was the truth she said
[39:06] the spirit of God was testifying to me
[39:08] that night trying to get me to come and
[39:09] said since then I could see my mother
[39:11] Soul frying hell like a pancake and
[39:13] laugh at it that's what happened see
[39:16] you've got to respect God all you got to
[39:19] do it brother that's all Jezebel
[39:21] disrespected it and remember another
[39:24] time there's some ear River children
[39:26] theyve been raised up in a home Elijah
[39:28] after his days of course the people
[39:30] hated him because he call that famine in
[39:32] the
[39:33] Land There were some people had taught
[39:36] their children that Elijah a man like
[39:38] that been translated taken into heaven
[39:40] he got killed somewhere and they just
[39:41] bearded him and hid him they they didn't
[39:44] believe it so Elisha took his place now
[39:48] he was a messenger of the day now after
[39:50] Elijah had been taken up so he passed
[39:53] down through a certain city and the
[39:55] children Little Children of that City
[39:57] run out making fun of him and said say
[39:59] you old Baldhead why didn't you goow up
[40:01] like Elijah did see they didn't believe
[40:03] Elijah went
[40:06] up there it is it wasn't a disrespecting
[40:10] the man it was disrespecting his message
[40:12] he was a successor to Elijah to Elijah
[40:16] he had the anointing the spirit of
[40:17] Elijah was up on him he went up there
[40:20] and done the very same things that
[40:21] Elijah did all right hallelujah amen
[40:25] Jesus said he that GTH on me the works I
[40:27] do shall he do also Hallelujah these
[40:31] signs shall follow
[40:33] them they disrespected it and they
[40:36] disrespected Elijah because he believed
[40:39] in elishah because the spirit was upon
[40:41] him and he turned around and smoked the
[40:43] jarden with his manlin opened up the
[40:45] jarden went up and done the same kind of
[40:48] Miracles that Elijah did and even all
[40:50] the preaches up at the school the
[40:52] prophet said the spirit of Elijah rest
[40:54] is up on
[40:55] Elijah Hallelujah know abroad in the
[40:58] country and the people I bet the L say
[41:01] look at that bunch of holy rulers ftic
[41:04] saying that man went to heaven without
[41:06] dying horses come down we didn't see any
[41:09] certainly they didn't certainly not they
[41:11] didn't we didn't see any hores we didn't
[41:13] hear any chariots anywhere nonsense the
[41:16] old fellow died and they buried him and
[41:17] then they trying to make a lot of uh
[41:19] cadu over just like they say today the
[41:21] same thing like they said about Jesus
[41:24] they said while they come and stole his
[41:25] body at night time they even pay
[41:27] soldiers to testify that but he raised
[41:30] him the dead and Elijah was tuck up in a
[41:33] CH to fire with horses of fire with this
[41:36] young Prophet walking along there going
[41:38] down through the city he lost his hair
[41:40] as a young man he was going down so
[41:42] these little children run behind him
[41:43] said hey why didn't you go up with
[41:45] Elijah said you old Baldhead you see and
[41:49] they were given
[41:51] disrespect and what did Elijah do he
[41:53] turned in the power of the spirit and
[41:55] cursed those children what happened two
[41:58] sheep bears come from the woods and kill
[42:00] 42 of
[42:01] them right disrespects irreverence you
[42:06] can't do that you've got to respect God
[42:09] if they have them kids that said now if
[42:11] their father and mother said now look
[42:12] children they say that Elijah was taken
[42:14] up now we don't know about that but
[42:16] anyhow I I I don't know whether it's so
[42:19] or not but I tell you the best thing to
[42:21] do is just don't say nothing about it
[42:22] just go ahead when he passes we hear
[42:24] he's coming down through the city today
[42:25] go to have a street meeting up there if
[42:27] he does if you children on the road to
[42:28] school today mean you say how do you do
[42:31] Reverend how do you do sir or something
[42:33] like that speak to him but instead of
[42:35] that no doubt they've been told at home
[42:37] all I heard Papa and Mama sit at the
[42:38] table and laughing one other saying what
[42:40] do you know they said that old holy roll
[42:42] was taking up could you ever believe
[42:44] anything like that and they said this a
[42:46] little baldheaded fell just as
[42:47] baldheaded as a pumpkin up there you
[42:49] over we're about 35 years old and here
[42:51] he's coming down through there day you
[42:52] go to whole street you expect us to
[42:54] believe such nonsense as that why isn't
[42:56] nothing but a little just a a mockery
[42:59] that's all it is because he won't come
[43:01] to our churches he's just like Elijah
[43:03] was he won't come to our churches we
[43:05] he'll probably some kind of Witchcraft
[43:07] hoodo hes that he's got like Elijah they
[43:10] didn't believe him so the little
[43:11] children was taught that at
[43:13] home if they've been taught reverence
[43:16] and
[43:17] respect that have walked out there
[43:19] before that prophet of God and I ask for
[43:22] prayer for themselves J but they had
[43:25] been taught to snigger and laugh and to
[43:27] make fun about like the children of
[43:30] today more too many of them today would
[43:32] make fun at a street meeting they make
[43:35] fun at the preaching of the
[43:36] Gospel so Elijah cursed them in the name
[43:39] of the Lord not because of the children
[43:42] but because of the irreverent parents
[43:44] that have brought the children up that
[43:45] way to disrespect God to she bears come
[43:49] out and kill 42 of them now that's
[43:52] irreverence God demands
[43:54] respect when they disrespected his
[43:57] Prophet they disrespected him no matter
[44:00] how much they didn't believe they
[44:01] already kept their mouth shut stay away
[44:03] from it but all they had to put in their
[44:04] nickel were they had to say something
[44:06] that they ought not have said and what
[44:08] happened to them let's take some people
[44:10] who did respect it let's take the
[44:12] shunamite woman to the same Prophet
[44:14] Elijah she was actually not an Israelite
[44:18] she was from
[44:19] shuna but she believed in God and she
[44:22] seen this man pass through the town
[44:24] heard him speak she's seen the signs
[44:26] that he done it's totally history I
[44:27] don't know where it's true or not that
[44:29] one day a bunch of wild dogs was trying
[44:31] to catch a little girl now this isn't
[44:33] scripture it's just a story that are
[44:35] read and said this shite woman was
[44:37] standing on the corner and she saw that
[44:39] these dogs was going to kill this little
[44:41] girl and this holy man was passing to
[44:43] town and he raised up his staff to God
[44:45] and cried out for Mercy for them little
[44:47] children like that and the dogs turned
[44:48] and went away from
[44:50] them whether it was sore or not sounds
[44:52] like it could be I don't know but anyhow
[44:54] this woman said when the Bible when she
[44:57] she perceived that this was a holy
[45:00] man she perceived something had happened
[45:04] she seen what he was and perceived that
[45:06] he was a holy man from God and instead
[45:09] of disrespecting him like Jezebel did
[45:13] she respected him she said to her
[45:16] husband we are well able to do this I
[45:18] pray thee let's build him a little house
[45:21] out here somewhere let's give him a
[45:22] little place far he's weary I watch him
[45:25] he's getting old and notice his gray
[45:27] hair as it hung down in his beard his a
[45:30] old staff his little skinny arms as he
[45:32] walked along the little flabby arms like
[45:35] that and here he come walking along
[45:37] packing a little Cru of oil on his side
[45:39] with a piece of sheep skin wrapped
[45:40] around him in the hot sun his body looks
[45:43] scared and red and uh I pray thee let's
[45:47] make him a little station to stop here
[45:49] let's get the contractor and come out
[45:51] here and build him a little place and
[45:53] Putt him up because I perceive that his
[45:56] Spirit by his he's a holy man he's a man
[45:59] of
[46:01] God what the difference now her husband
[46:04] agreed she he said darling I've noticed
[46:07] that man too I've listened at him I've
[46:09] watched him I've seen his works I know
[46:11] he's the holy man of God so we'll just
[46:13] do that so they called the contractor
[46:15] build him a nice little place and put
[46:16] him a little bed there to rest so he can
[46:18] lay down and rest fixed him a place to
[46:20] wash his feet got some water and things
[46:22] and fixed it in there and when the
[46:24] prophet came by of course i' blessed his
[46:26] soul to see that something had been done
[46:27] for him he said to Gesa go call her and
[46:30] asked her what could I do for her could
[46:32] I speak to the king to the chief chap he
[46:35] she said I dwell among my people and
[46:37] there's nothing I have eat of but Gesa
[46:39] said she has no children and her husband
[46:42] is well stricken in age he's old they
[46:44] have no children and I imagine Elijah
[46:46] laying on this little bed that she had
[46:48] blessed him by making had his feet all
[46:50] washed and his beards all washed out and
[46:52] thing laying there no doubt for what
[46:54] he's seen the vision of the Lord because
[46:56] they always did that so they said go
[46:59] call her and tell her to stand here
[47:00] before me oh Hallelujah go call her
[47:04] because she has she's respected God go
[47:08] tell her to come here when she stood in
[47:09] the door he said thus sayith the Lord
[47:12] about this time next year you'll bear a
[47:14] baby
[47:15] GL and about that time next year she had
[47:18] the baby then Satan when he got to be
[47:20] about 12 years old his father had him
[47:22] out in the field one day and Satan said
[47:24] I'll get rid of that child so he just
[47:26] give him a son stroke and he died in his
[47:28] mother's arms did that discourage her no
[47:30] sir she said saddle a mule and go
[47:33] farward don't stop go up to Mount
[47:35] Caramel to the mountain because he just
[47:36] passed through here other
[47:39] day there you are that's respect that's
[47:43] respect and her husband said you're
[47:45] going to the man of God said it's
[47:47] neither new moon or Sabbath he won't be
[47:48] up there and she said all will be well
[47:50] just sadle a mu and let me go on and so
[47:53] away they went and they got up into the
[47:55] mountain and and when old Elijah looked
[47:57] out of the cave and he come out there
[47:59] and looked at he said this looks like
[48:00] that shunamite woman coming said she
[48:02] must be grieved he said go meet her and
[48:05] when it said she's grieving in her heart
[48:07] and God's never told me nothing about it
[48:09] see God don't have to tell you
[48:10] everything see so he don't even tell his
[48:12] profits everything he just he just does
[48:15] what he wants to do he's
[48:17] God now Elijah said God what if elij
[48:20] just said this why didn't you tell me
[48:22] why she's coming why didn't you tell me
[48:24] all about it you had never seen a thing
[48:26] but it was all right with Elijah
[48:28] whatever it was and what if she had come
[48:29] up and said she'd say you said you was a
[48:32] servant of God you hypocrite I do
[48:34] believe you ain't nothing but a Holy
[48:35] Roller it'll never happen see God tries
[48:39] us sometimes see what we'll do so
[48:41] instead of that she run right up to his
[48:43] feet and worship like she was to God and
[48:46] she said and she revealed to him what
[48:48] was the matter and Elijah said take my
[48:50] staff and go lay it on the child and
[48:53] when he did the woman said as the Lord
[48:55] God liveth in your soul will never
[48:57] die Hallelujah thou servant of God I'll
[49:02] not leave you I'm going to stay here to
[49:04] God sense division amen oh Elijah stayed
[49:07] there a little while longer gted up his
[49:09] loins and tucked his staff and here he
[49:10] went he went into the room where that
[49:12] baby was laying a dead baby walked up
[49:15] and down the floor like that a few times
[49:17] because of a reverent woman a woman that
[49:19] respected him a man that respected him
[49:21] and believe him to be a man of God he
[49:23] walked back and forth up and down the
[49:24] floor until God answered
[49:27] amen then he laid himself up on the baby
[49:29] in his SE seven times and picked it up
[49:31] and give it to the mother walked on out
[49:33] back up the cave he went because she
[49:35] respected the man of God Amen
[49:40] God what about Martha she was
[49:52] always amen thank the Lord for the
[49:55] message tonight
[49:58] that was really good wouldn't you say
[50:00] just a real blessing to hear that Lord
[50:02] help me to have that respect for for God
[50:06] amen amen so we have a few prayer
[50:10] requests um first a a a a blessing a
[50:14] testimony we put in a um an offer for
[50:18] the a church building and they accepted
[50:20] our offer and so we have we're under
[50:23] contract for a building so we thank the
[50:25] Lord for that amen
[50:32] amen amen and so
[50:35] um I know that there
[50:39] are uh these news articles that are
[50:42] going out quite there's a bunch of them
[50:45] at Phoenix I've gotten text I haven't
[50:47] read any of them as of yet and um I just
[50:52] haven't had the time I guess or didn't
[50:54] take I saw the headlines
[50:57] um but it's always something you know
[51:00] 2020 it was covid and that's what
[51:02] everybody was talking about in this city
[51:04] but that was worldwide and this is kind
[51:07] of hitting home to us but some of the
[51:11] stuff I've been hearing are true um
[51:15] grievances that people have but what
[51:18] what group doesn't have that what family
[51:20] what family doesn't have those problems
[51:22] that that has nothing to do with
[51:25] me God sent a mighty message to us and
[51:29] brother bam said that's the time to
[51:31] respect it you go when you get the
