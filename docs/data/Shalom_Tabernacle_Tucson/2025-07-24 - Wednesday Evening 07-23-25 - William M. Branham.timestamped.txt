[18:45] B flat. And I pulled up to an
[18:48] intersection and I I was just stopped
[18:50] there waiting for the light to turn
[18:52] green. And I'm looking in my rearview
[18:55] mirror

[18:59] barreling this like very fast, probably
[19:01] going 55 towards me. And it's just
[19:04] growing bigger and bigger and I'm just
[19:06] like waiting for it to slow down. And
[19:09] I'm just watching it and I kind of just

[25:47] recognize that

[25:52] day, for our generation. Now, in the
[25:54] scriptures, we like to take a a portion
[25:57] of scripture just to read before we go
[25:59] to the tape. It's in Ephesians chapter
[26:01] 1. Brother Brandham is bringing that on.
[26:05] He's trying to get through a good
[26:07] portion of the book and um
[26:11] he doesn't quite get finished like he
[26:13] wanted to, but he does get to this part.
[26:15] But in Ephesians chapter 1 vers number
[26:18] nine,
[26:21] happy to have brother Ly back from
[26:23] California
[26:24] and each of you. Amen.
[26:31] Verse Vers 9, Having made known unto us
[26:34] the mystery of his will, according to
[26:36] his good pleasure, which he hath
[26:38] purposed in himself, that in the
[26:41] dispensation of the fullness of times,
[26:43] he might gather together in one all
[26:47] things in Christ, both which are in
[26:50] heaven, which are on earth, even in him,
[26:54] in whom also we have obtained an
[26:56] inheritance,
[26:58] being predestinated according to the
[27:00] purpose of him who workketh all things
[27:03] after the counsel of his own will, that
[27:07] we should be to the praise of his glory,
[27:11] who first trusted in Christ, in whom ye
[27:15] also trusted after that you heard the
[27:17] word of truth, the gospel of your
[27:19] salvation, and whom also after that ye
[27:23] believed, you were sealed with that Holy
[27:26] Spirit of promise, which is the earnest
[27:29] of our inheritance. ance until the
[27:32] redemption of the purchased possession
[27:35] unto the praise of his glory. Amen.
[27:40] Thank God for his word. So let's sing uh
[27:42] that
[27:44] happy to have Levi back as well. And
[27:47] each of you only believe. Amen. Singing

[29:16] Lord, I really,
[29:19] [Music]
[29:21] we're happy to have Sean back as well.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; I don't want to forget anyone. God bless
[29:25] you, brother Brandham.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; He's a logist of God. That is true. that
[29:33] was the son of God. Then he made man
[29:36] that little God. And he said, "If they
[29:38] call those who the word of God came to,
[29:41] the prophets,
[29:42] if they call them gods who the word of
[29:46] God came to," and God said so himself
[29:48] that they were gods.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; He told Moses, "I made you a god
[29:56] &gt;&gt; and made Aaron your prophet."
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:04] Amen.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; I may act like a religious crank, but
[30:09] I'm not.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, and your eyes can come open and see
[30:14] those things.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; All right. He made man a god.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; A god in his domain. And his domain goes
[30:26] from sea to sea, from shore to shore.
[30:29] Praise the Lord.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; He has the control of it.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus came being the one God
[30:37] without sin, he proved it.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; When the winds blow, he said, "Peace be
[30:42] still."
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; And when the trees said, "No man eat
[30:48] from thee." Verily I say unto you, you
[30:52] that's little gods, if you'll say to
[30:54] this mountain, be moved and don't doubt
[30:56] in your heart, but believe that what
[30:57] you've said will come to pass, you can
[30:59] have what you've said.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; Go right back to Genesis to the
[31:04] original. What is it now? The world and
[31:07] nature is groaning, crying,
[31:11] everything's a moving what? For the
[31:13] manifestation of the sons of God. Amen.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; When true sons,
[31:19] &gt;&gt; born sons,
[31:21] &gt;&gt; fil sons,
[31:24] &gt;&gt; speak into the word is that
[31:27] &gt;&gt; I believe we're on the border of it
[31:28] right now.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; Say to this mountain, let it be so.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Brother, I I desire so and so a certain
[31:37] thing done. I'm a believer in Jesus
[31:39] Christ. I give it to you in the name of
[31:42] the Lord.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; There's a manifestation.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, my crops are burning up
[31:49] about the earth. I haven't had any rain.
[31:51] I'll send your rain in the name of the
[31:53] Lord.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, your
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, waiting, groaning, all nature.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Waiting for the manifestations of the
[32:04] sons of God. God orained it at the
[32:07] beginning. He gave man the domain. He
[32:10] gave Jesus Christ and Jesus gave it to
[32:12] his name with this assurance. Ask the
[32:15] father anything in my name and I'll do
[32:17] it.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[32:21] &gt;&gt; oh, brother Palmer.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Waiting for the manifestations
[32:27] of the sons of God. The position the
[32:30] church as I said the book of Ephesians
[32:33] is the book of Joshua and Joshua placing
[32:36] the people where they belong. Now, if
[32:39] they wouldn't stand still and they put
[32:41] Ephraim here and Abra on Manasses land
[32:44] and this come back and fuss and steward,
[32:47] how are they ever going to get along?
[32:49] When one said, "I'm a Baptist. I'm a
[32:51] Methodist. I'm a Pentecostal. I'm one
[32:52] this. I'm a Tunisian. I'm that I'm so
[32:54] How you going to do it?
[32:56] Stand still."
[32:59] &gt;&gt; God's will to place his church.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Sons and daughters of God.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; God, let me live to see it as my prayer.
[33:10] So close I can just feel it with my
[33:12] hands almost look like just right there.
[33:15] That's what I've longed to see.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Waiting for the time when walk down the
[33:19] street. There lays a laying
[33:21] there from his mother's womb. Silver and
[33:23] gold have I known
[33:28] &gt;&gt; waiting for the manifestations of the
[33:30] sons of God.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When God will make himself
[33:34] known. when they'll stop sickness,
[33:38] they'll stop cancer, they'll stop
[33:40] diseases. You think cancer is something?
[33:42] The Bible said there's coming a time
[33:44] when man will rot right in their flesh
[33:45] in the buzzards. They'll eat off their
[33:47] carcasses before they even die.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Cancer is a toothache to what's coming.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; But remember that horrible thing was
[33:56] forbidden in that day to touch those who
[33:58] had the seal of God.
[34:00] That's what we're striving for now. To
[34:03] get in and be positionally placed into
[34:05] the kingdom of God before this horrible
[34:07] plagues strike.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, how good
[34:12] &gt;&gt; the dispensation of time, fullness of
[34:15] time, the inheritance
[34:18] in whom we also obtain inheritance being
[34:22] predestinated.
[34:24] How is our inheritance given to us?
[34:26] Through what?
[34:28] predestination.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Predestination is for knowledge.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; How did God know he could trust you to
[34:37] be a preacher?
[34:40] &gt;&gt; He's for knowledge.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; Not he that willth or he that runth or
[34:46] it's God that showeth mercy.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; Predestination. He knew what was in you.
[34:52] He knew what was in you before you even
[34:54] come on the earth.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. He know what was in here before
[34:56] this earth for you to come on.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; That's that's him. That's the infinite
[35:02] God. Infinite. We're finite. We can only
[35:06] think finite. It's been so much to me
[35:08] since that. What happened to me? I don't
[35:10] know. When I think there when I stood
[35:13] there for those few joyful moments and
[35:16] thought there's no tomorrow, there was
[35:19] no yesterday. There's no sickness.
[35:21] There's no sorrow. There's no little bit
[35:24] of happiness. It's not a whole lot of
[35:25] happiness. It's all happiness.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[35:30] Oh. When I stood there and I said, "What
[35:33] is this?" That voice said, "This is
[35:35] perfect love." And everything that you
[35:38] ever loved and everything that ever
[35:40] loved you is shared with you now.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; And you will present us to the Lord
[35:45] Jesus when he comes as trophies of your
[35:48] ministry.
[35:49] I've seen those beautiful women standing
[35:51] there all grabbing me and screaming, "My
[35:54] precious darling brother." Seen those
[35:56] men with that shaggy hair around their
[35:58] neck here running grabbing me and
[36:00] saying, "Our darling brother." And I
[36:02] thought, "What does this mean?" He said,
[36:05] "They're your people." I said, "My
[36:07] people, there couldn't be that many
[36:09] brands. There's millions." He said,
[36:10] "They're your converts."
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; They are your converts. They're the ones
[36:18] that said, "You see that woman standing
[36:21] there? The most beautiful woman I ever
[36:22] seen said she was a past 90 years old
[36:25] when you led her to God."
[36:27] &gt;&gt; No wonder she's crying. My darling
[36:29] brother
[36:30] &gt;&gt; said she'll never be old no more.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; She's passed from that. She's in the
[36:35] splendor of youth. She's standing here.
[36:37] She can't drink a cold drink of water.
[36:38] She don't need it. She can't lay down
[36:40] and sleep cuz she don't get tired.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; There's no tomorrow, no yesterday,
[36:44] dinner, nothing. We're in eternity now.
[36:46] But some glorious day the son of God
[36:49] shall come and you will be judged
[36:51] according to the word that you preach to
[36:53] them.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; I said, "Will Paul have to bring his
[36:58] group?" Yes, sir. I said, "I preached it
[37:00] just exactly like Paul said it.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; I never did it. I never tuck into any
[37:06] church creeds or anything else. I stay
[37:08] the same and all of them scream with one
[37:09] accord. We know that we're listening
[37:12] with assurance
[37:14] said you will present us to him and then
[37:17] we'll all go back to earth again to live
[37:19] forever.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Just then I started coming to
[37:24] you. I look laying on the bed and I see
[37:26] my old carcasser
[37:28] getting old and wrinkled and drawn up
[37:30] and and diseased up and afflicted and I
[37:33] see my hands behind my head and I
[37:35] thought, "Oh, will I have to go back in
[37:37] that thing again?"
[37:39] And I kept hearing that voice, "Keep
[37:41] pressing on. Keep pressing on." I said,
[37:44] "Lord, I've always believed if I keep
[37:46] believing it, but I'll press for them so
[37:49] help me. I'll have so many there. I let
[37:52] me live, Lord, and I'll put another
[37:53] million in there if you
[37:56] &gt;&gt; I don't care what color, what creed,
[37:58] what nationality, what they are. They're
[38:00] all one when they get there." And those
[38:02] boundary lines just passed away.
[38:05] Oh, I could see those women
[38:08] so pretty. Never seen went long, long
[38:11] hair way down their back, long skirts
[38:13] way down his barefooted. See that man
[38:16] with shaggy hair around their neck, red
[38:18] heads, blackheads, and all different
[38:20] colors. And they were throwing their
[38:21] arms around me. I could feel them. I
[38:24] felt their hands just God is my judge in
[38:26] this sacred book open. I could feel them
[38:28] just the same. I feel my hands on my
[38:30] face. They were throwing their arms
[38:32] around me. No sensation of women like we
[38:34] be now. I don't care how holy you are,
[38:37] who you are, what kind of a preacher you
[38:39] are, priest or whatever you might be.
[38:41] There's no man can let a woman throw his
[38:43] arms around without having human
[38:44] sensations.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; It's exactly the truth. My brother, when
[38:49] you pass between here and it ain't that
[38:51] way there. Oh my. It's so all there's.
[38:55] It's impossible.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; It's all love.
[39:02] Everything is real, brother. And
[39:03] everything's real, sister. There's no
[39:06] death, no sorrow, no jealousy, no
[39:08] nothing. Nothing can enter there. It's
[39:10] just perfection. That's what I'm
[39:12] striving for. That's what I'm placing
[39:14] for. I said, oh Lord, that's what I'm
[39:16] here at the church for. Trying to set
[39:17] the church in order, telling you,
[39:19] brother, sister, there's only one thing
[39:22] that can enter that. That's perfect
[39:23] love.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Not because you're loyal to the Brandham
[39:26] Tabernacle or the Methodist Church or
[39:28] Baptist Church. Damn's all right. You
[39:30] should be. But oh friends, you've got
[39:33] not because you spoke with tongues,
[39:34] danced in the spirit, because you cast
[39:36] out devils or move mountains with faith.
[39:39] That all's all right for that's all
[39:41] right. But still, unless that real
[39:43] perfect love is in there.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; That was where perfect love was. And
[39:49] that's the only thing that'll let you in
[39:50] there. That's the only thing that can
[39:52] stay there. It's the only thing there
[39:54] was there.
[39:56] Oh my. It's an adoption. God before the
[40:00] foundation of the world. Now, let's
[40:02] hurry up. Let's get this one chapter
[40:03] through. Anyhow,
[40:05] if possible in the next 10 minutes,
[40:08] through whom we also have obtained an
[40:10] inheritance. We inherit what? Eternal
[40:12] life. Being predestinated. How? Does
[40:16] everybody understand that?
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Did you call on God? No. God called on
[40:22] you.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Some people say, "Oh, I just sought God
[40:27] and sought God." You did not.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; No man never sought God. It's God
[40:31] seeking man.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "No man can come to me
[40:34] except my father draws him first."
[40:37] &gt;&gt; See, it's a nature of man to run from
[40:39] God.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; And you say now that that's what bothers
[40:43] me all to preach to you people. Don't
[40:47] remain on in the same condition you've
[40:49] been going in. Change. Now
[40:52] hear me as I said, thus sayeth the Lord.
[40:57] I've never called myself this. I'm not.
[40:59] But you call me your prophet or a
[41:01] prophet. The world believes that. The
[41:03] world around
[41:05] millions and millions and millions of
[41:06] people. I've spoke direct and indirect
[41:08] to 10 or 10 or 12 million people or
[41:10] more. Directly speaking, I've seen tens
[41:14] of thousands of visions and signs and
[41:16] wonders. Not one of them have ever
[41:17] failed.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; And that's right. He's foretold me
[41:20] things. It's never failed to happen.
[41:22] Just exactly. I bring any man to trial
[41:25] for that. That's right. I don't claim to
[41:28] be a prophet, but you listen to me. Thus
[41:31] sayaeth the Lord, it'll take perfect
[41:34] love to put you in that place.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; For that's all there was there. No
[41:38] matter how many how much religious
[41:40] demonstrations, how many good deeds
[41:42] you've done or whatever you done, that
[41:44] won't count nothing on that day.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; It'll take perfect love. So whatever you
[41:49] do, you lay aside everything else until
[41:52] you are just so filled with the love of
[41:55] God
[41:57] till you can love those who hate you.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; I'm just as I said this morning, I was
[42:04] made my whole makeup is grace.
[42:07] A lot of people say, "No, you scratch my
[42:09] back and I'll scratch yours."
[42:12] Well, you do something for me and I'll
[42:13] do something for you. That's not grace.
[42:16] Amen.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Grace says, "If your back is itching,
[42:18] I'll scratch it anyhow."
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Whether you scratch mine or not, you
[42:21] slap me on the face and say, "My back
[42:23] needs itching. Need scratching, I'll
[42:24] scratch it."
[42:25] &gt;&gt; See, that's it. Do something. I don't
[42:27] believe in works.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; I believe it works as love. Works is
[42:32] works is a manifestation that grace has
[42:34] taken place.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; I don't live true to my wife because
[42:38] believe she'd divorce me if I didn't. I
[42:41] live true to her because I love her. I
[42:44] don't preach the gospel because I think
[42:45] go to hell if I didn't. I preach the
[42:47] gospel because I love him.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Certainly. You think I cross those
[42:52] stormy seas and them planes diving back
[42:54] and forth and lightning flashing around
[42:56] and and everything else and most any
[42:58] minute and everybody's screaming and
[43:00] hail mies are going on through the plane
[43:02] and everything and people swinging and
[43:04] them safety belts and the pilots saying
[43:06] they left gas life 15 minutes longer.
[43:08] Don't know where we're at. You think I'd
[43:10] do that just just for the fun of doing
[43:12] it? Huh? You think I'd get back out
[43:14] there in the jungle where German
[43:16] soldiers had to put their arms around me
[43:18] like this each night and take me in and
[43:20] out of the meeting until the Holy Spirit
[43:22] begin to perform miracles? Communist set
[43:24] with night scopes to shoot me a mile
[43:26] away. You think I do that just for the
[43:28] fun of it? Because something in me loves
[43:33] their humans that Christ died for. Paul
[43:36] said, "I'm not only willing to go up to
[43:38] Jerusalem, but I'm going up there to be
[43:40] crucified. I'm going up to die. I'm
[43:42] going up there to die for the cause of
[43:44] the Lord." It's something love that
[43:46] constrains you, that makeshift.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. If I have preached
[43:51] the gospel for money, if it would have
[43:53] been, I wouldn't have been $20,000
[43:56] tonight in debt.
[43:59] I wouldn't been that in debt. No, sir.
[44:02] Because I'd have kept some of some of
[44:04] the millions that have been given to me.
[44:05] One man, one man sent FBI agents with a
[44:09] million500,000
[44:11] money draft.
[44:13] Now I said take it back. Not for money.
[44:17] It isn't money. I don't preach the
[44:18] gospel for money.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Not for that. It's because of the love.
[44:25] The thing I want to do is when I cross
[44:27] that last breath, which may be in five
[44:29] minutes from now. It may be in two hours
[44:32] from now. It may be 50 years from now. I
[44:35] don't know when it'll be, but when it
[44:37] must I do ride there, I want to see in
[44:39] the splendor of youth running coloring
[44:41] my darling brother.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; My brother.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; That's what's in my heart. That's why I
[44:49] don't try to disagree with you to be be
[44:51] different, but I'm trying to put you on
[44:53] the road that's right.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; That's the way in. Not your church, not
[44:58] your denomination, but your birth in
[45:00] Christ.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[45:06] in whom we have obtained
[45:08] inheritance being predestinated
[45:10] according to the purpose of him who
[45:13] workketh all things at the counsel of
[45:15] his own will. Listen, we're going to
[45:17] close a few minutes. Listen close now
[45:19] before we close. That we should be to
[45:24] the praises of his glory who first
[45:26] trusted Christ in whom you also trusted.
[45:30] Watch this now closely.
[45:34] Get on your jackets, gospel jackets.
[45:38] Hold your ears open.
[45:40] Listen close. I'm on the 13th verse. In
[45:45] whom you also trusted after
[45:49] that ye heard
[45:52] faith cometh by
[45:55] &gt;&gt; hearing the
[45:57] &gt;&gt; word of.
[45:59] After that, you heard the word of truth.
[46:04] What is truth? The word of God. Is that
[46:07] right?
[46:08] &gt;&gt; John 17:17, you just taken down
[46:11] scriptures. Jesus said, "Sanctify them.
[46:14] Follow through the truth. Thy word is
[46:17] truth."
[46:20] &gt;&gt; After you heard the truth, the gospel
[46:25] of your salvation. What was the
[46:29] salvation he's trying to tell them?
[46:30] Predestinated before the foundation of
[46:32] the earth. Is that right?
[46:34] &gt;&gt; To adoption of sons. Predestinated
[46:37] eternal life. Now if you come into
[46:39] eternal life, you've been saved,
[46:41] sanctified, filled with the Holy Spirit,
[46:44] your sons. Now God won't replace you
[46:46] positionally. Oh, so that you can work
[46:48] for his kingdom and his glory. That's
[46:51] the gospel. Be first. Hear the word.
[46:55] Repent. be baptized in the name of Jesus
[46:57] Christ for the remission of sins, taking
[47:00] away all your sins, calling on the name
[47:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[47:03] promised land.
[47:06] The promise isn't to every souljourner
[47:08] that's on your road. If you left your
[47:10] home tonight, a sinner saying, "I'll
[47:12] walk over to the Brandom Tabernacle."
[47:14] God gives you the opportunity tonight.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; There's one thing lays between you and
[47:20] the promised land. What is the promised
[47:22] land? The Holy Ghost. What lay between
[47:24] Joshua and the promised land was a
[47:27] Jordan.
[47:28] Exactly right. Moses being a type of
[47:31] Christ led the children up to the
[47:33] promised land. Then Moses did not take
[47:36] the children in the promised land.
[47:38] Joshua took the people in and divided up
[47:41] the land. Jesus paid the price, led them
[47:45] up to the Holy Spirit. God sent the Holy
[47:47] Spirit down and he positionally put the
[47:49] church in order. Amen.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Each man filling him with his presence
[47:54] of his being. You see what I mean?
[47:57] &gt;&gt; All in Christ Jesus. How God
[48:01] predestinated this to the calling of
[48:03] this gospel. Paul Galatians 18 said, "If
[48:06] an angel come preach anything else, let
[48:08] him be accursed."
[48:10] &gt;&gt; The truth, the gospel. Now listen close
[48:13] as we read on finishing the verse.
[48:16] The gospel of your salvation. in whom
[48:21] also listen
[48:24] closely.
[48:25] After that ye believed,
[48:32] ye were sealed
[48:36] with the Holy Spirit of promise.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; In the last days, the Bible said, now
[48:44] watch, in the last days, there's going
[48:46] to be two classes of people. One of them
[48:48] is going to have the seal of God, the
[48:51] other the mark of the beast. Is that
[48:53] right? How many knows that?
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Well, if the seal of God is the seal of
[48:59] if the seal of God is the Holy Ghost,
[49:01] then without the Holy Ghost is the mark
[49:04] of the beast. And the Bible said that
[49:06] the two spirits would be so close
[49:08] together, it would deceive the very
[49:10] elected if it was possible.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; It'll never do it because they were
[49:15] elected to eternal life.
[49:18] See
[49:20] &gt;&gt; churchgoing
[49:22] justice and honorary 10 virgins went out
[49:25] to meet the Lord. All sanctified, all
[49:27] holy,
[49:29] every one of them sanctified. Five were
[49:32] dilitarian. Let the lights go out. Five
[49:35] had aura in their lamps. And behold, the
[49:38] bridegroom cometh. And the five that had
[49:40] aura in their lamps went into the
[49:42] wedding supper. And the others was left
[49:44] outside where there were weeping and
[49:47] wailing and nashing of teeth.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Be ready for you don't know what minute
[49:53] the Lord comes. Have you what is or
[49:55] represented the Bible? Holy Spirit.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Now do you hear seventh day Adventist
[50:01] brethren who said the seventh day is
[50:03] God's seal produce one scripture to
[50:05] prove it.
[50:07] The Bible said that the seal of God is
[50:09] the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Watch this. Which, what's the 13th verse
[50:15] now? After that, you believe you were
[50:18] sealed with the with the Holy Spirit of
[50:21] promise. Turn to Ephesians 4:30. I
[50:24] believe that's it. See if we don't get
[50:26] 4:30 and see if this isn't the same.
[50:27] Ephesians the 4th chapter and the 30th
[50:30] verse. Yeah, here it is. 4:30. and
[50:34] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
[50:37] whereby ye are sealed until the day of
[50:43] redemption.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; How long when you really really receive
[50:47] the Holy Ghost? How long is it to last
[50:49] you? until the next revival,
[50:51] &gt;&gt; until grandma crosses your path, until
[50:54] the boss balls you out, until the day of
[50:58] your rep.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; After you have died, after you have
[51:05] passed into that land that you're
[51:08] standing at with your loved ones, you
[51:10] are still filled with the Holy Ghost.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. scripture. You're just as you are
[51:18] now. Only you've got you moved into
[51:21] another body. You've just changed
[51:23] houses. This one got old. You couldn't
[51:25] tack the shingles on it no more. The
[51:27] rafters got rotten. That's right. So,
[51:30] you just turn the old thing away and let
[51:32] it rot on down and moved into a new one.
[51:34] Is that right?
[51:35] &gt;&gt; For if this earthly tabernacle be
[51:37] dissolved, we have one waiting.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember the other day going
[51:43] through that when a little baby's being
[51:45] formed in the womb of the mother and
[51:46] this little muscles are kicking and
[51:48] jumping and going on. But just as soon
[51:50] as the mother drops the baby and the
[51:52] baby's to earth, the first thing there
[51:54] is a spiritual body to catch that little
[51:57] natural body.
[51:59] Maybe the doctor will give it a like
[52:01] that or something or shake it, you know,
[52:04] when and immediately right to that
[52:06] mother's breast, it'll go moving its
[52:09] little head up and down on her mother's
[52:10] breast to make those milk veins bring
[52:13] milk
[52:15] on a little calf. As soon as it's
[52:16] dropped from the mother, it'll get up on
[52:18] its little knees. After a few minutes,
[52:19] what will it do? Move rice crepe back
[52:21] around, get a hold of that mother, and
[52:23] shake it little head up and down like
[52:24] that and get it.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. When this natural body comes
[52:31] into earth, there's a spiritual body
[52:33] waiting for it. And when this natural
[52:35] body is dropped on the ground,
[52:37] Hallelujah.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; There is one waiting on earth.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; We just move from one end to another. We
[52:45] change our dwelling places.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; This mortal must put on immortality.
[52:50] This spiritual, this corruption put on
[52:52] incorruption. this old wrinkled up troll
[52:56] suit over body, but it won't change its
[52:59] appearance at all. I mean, when it gets
[53:01] out of you'll still have the same
[53:03] spirit.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Let me give you a little something
[53:05] sounds twisting to you, but it's the
[53:07] Bible. Then I'll give you one little
[53:09] untwisted for you. Watch this one. One
[53:12] old Saul, the king that the old big old
[53:16] denominational preacher down there at
[53:18] that time, you know, it got head and
[53:19] shoulders above them all and was afraid.
[53:22] He didn't know nothing about the
[53:23] supernatural. David had to come and
[53:25] deliver the lamb out of the lion's
[53:27] mouth, kill Goliath, watch him.
[53:31] He got so far back from God, he got the
[53:33] hat in this holy royal preacher.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; And instead of being for him to try to
[53:37] help him, he turned against him. If that
[53:40] just isn't a picture exactly
[53:43] &gt;&gt; exactly picture
[53:46] &gt;&gt; turned right from him. How many is in
[53:48] here when I left on my first trip and
[53:50] preached David at slain Goliath? Well, I
[53:53] left many some of the few of the
[53:54] old-timers. I'm fixing to leave again on
[53:57] this. Remember, we'll see what just come
[53:59] around last Sunday.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Is moving right into another phase.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; David's second campaign, second phase of
[54:05] his ministry.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. Which then he become
[54:08] king over Israel.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Notice the ministry now is moving out
[54:11] into a greater phase, coming out
[54:14] greater. So did David. I notice this as
[54:16] he comes. David,
[54:20] oh, when God had David come out there
[54:23] and slay the lion, notice, and slay the
[54:27] bear, then slay the Philistine.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Now, there come a time when God gave a
[54:33] evil spirit over to this old boy and I
[54:37] to what? To hate David. And I believe
[54:41] now these tapes. Now, listen, brethren,
[54:43] you own these tapes. If you disagree
[54:45] with me, forgive me. See, I love you.
[54:48] I'm gonna meet you over there anyhow.
[54:50] See, because if you're a man of God, I'm
[54:52] going to meet you anyhow. But I want to
[54:54] say this. Here's the reason. Just
[54:57] because that Saul saw that David had
[55:01] something that he didn't have.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Then what happened? A little old ruddy
[55:07] draw over. The Bible said he was ruddy.
[55:10] That wasn't a very fair child. Rudy is
[55:13] just a little old drawed up sort of a
[55:15] fell and he went out there and Saul well
[55:17] he put Saul's armor on him and I imagine
[55:19] the shield come plumbing down over his
[55:21] feet
[55:22] &gt;&gt; and he said take this stuff off of me
[55:25] &gt;&gt; I maybe give him a doctor's degree a PhD
[55:28] or LLD or something you know
[55:30] &gt;&gt; he said I don't know nothing about that
[55:32] stuff because I haven't proved it let me
[55:34] have this what I know what I'm doing
[55:36] with
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. He took the slingshot and it
[55:40] made David mad because the daughters,
[55:43] the churches, the churches was singing.
[55:46] Saul might have killed his thousands,
[55:48] but David killed his tens of thousands.
[55:50] Then he got jealous.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; That old Jesus name stuff. There's
[55:54] nothing to it.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. And what did God do to
[55:58] him? God sent an evil spirit upon him.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Exactly. What's happening? to hate
[56:07] David. And he hated David without a
[56:10] cause.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; David could have rung his neck a few
[56:13] times.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; He could, but he just let it go. He just
[56:17] never said nothing. He sure could have
[56:19] done. He went over, cut the tail of his
[56:20] coat off one night, come back, said,
[56:22] "Look at here. You see?"
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He could have done it, but he
[56:26] just let him alone. He could have broke
[56:28] his congregation up and scattered him
[56:29] and started an organization of himself
[56:31] if he wanted to, but he didn't do it. He
[56:33] just let Saul and let God do the
[56:34] fighting.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So as he went on out and the
[56:38] campaign finished on it and got on that
[56:41] evil spirit God so that Saul couldn't
[56:43] get no answer from God. After a while he
[56:46] the spirit of the Lord had departed from
[56:47] him and oh Samuel the one that they
[56:50] turned down. The one that really was the
[56:53] voice of God to him.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; The one that said to him before they
[56:57] even wanted to act like the world. Why
[57:00] does a church want to act like the
[57:01] world?
[57:03] Why does Pentecostal baptized Holy Ghost
[57:06] experienced Methodist and Baptist and
[57:08] Presbyterian want to act like the world?
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Why do they do it? I don't know.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; I I just can't understand it. You say,
[57:17] "Well, it's all fun to play poker. Just
[57:19] a little bit for fun." Just little piney
[57:22] or what you call it. It's a sin.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; You shouldn't have them things in your
[57:27] house.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Well, it's no harm take this little
[57:30] bitty glass of beer. We just got a few
[57:32] men. My wife has a few in the afternoon
[57:34] and the first thing you know your
[57:35] children's got a few.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Sure did.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; And you winning.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Devil's just made a That's what he did
[57:45] in the beginning. And he certainly has
[57:47] made a target. I ye sisters. He just
[57:50] does that just because he knows what he
[57:52] can do. He can deceive a woman a
[57:55] thousand times quicker than a man. I
[57:56] know that hurts your feelings, but
[57:57] that's the truth.
[57:59] Exactly. That's what he done in the
[58:00] Garden of Eden. He can make She was
[58:03] honest. She was sincere, but she was
[58:05] deceived.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Adam was not deceived. The Bible says he
[58:09] wasn't deceived, but she was deceived.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; So, he can deceive her. And yet, pastors
[58:16] will go right out in arname women
[58:17] preachers, put them out over
[58:19] congregations like that. And this Bible
[58:21] condemns it from Genesis to Revelation.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; They say, "Well, it's all right. It's
[58:26] all right. They got they preach the same
[58:27] as I know that's right. Like somebody
[58:30] starts speaking in tongues one time. I
[58:32] just kept on preaching.
[58:34] And when I got outside, a woman said to
[58:36] my son said, "I've got a message to give
[58:38] tomorrow night." Said, "Why your daddy
[58:40] comes on a platform?" Said, "Well,
[58:42] message me? What do you mean?" And that
[58:44] night when it got ready, when I was
[58:44] fixing to make the alter call, she fixed
[58:46] her hair all up and pulled up her
[58:47] stockings and everything, got ready,
[58:49] jumped up middle for jump up and down,
[58:50] spoke in tongues and prophesied. But I
[58:52] just kept on preaching. McMah recall.
[58:55] Well, I never respected it, but it
[58:57] wasn't right. So then, well, the Bible
[59:00] said not to said the the spirit of the
[59:02] prophets are subject to the prophet.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; God's on the God speaking at the
[59:06] platform, let him speak.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Paul said if something be revealed to
[59:10] one, let him hold his peace till the
[59:12] next finishes.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Now then, when I got outside, these
[59:16] people said, a big bunch of people said,
[59:18] "You grieve the Holy Ghost tonight." I
[59:20] said, "What doing? What did I do? Said,
[59:22] "Well, when that sister gave that
[59:23] message, Hallelujah." said that Well, I
[59:25] said I was preaching. She was out of
[59:26] order. Oh, I said that was fresh right
[59:28] off the throne. That's fresher than what
[59:30] she was preaching.
[59:34] Now, that just shows that shows either
[59:37] this, and I say to your respects, either
[59:40] insanity
[59:41] or either disrespect or illiterate
[59:44] teaching that don't know more about God
[59:47] than a rabbit knows about snowshoes.
[59:49] Now, that I don't say that to be a a
[59:51] silly remark because there's no place to
[59:53] joke, but that's that's exactly the
[59:55] truth. A person that would know that
[59:57] God's not an author of confusion.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; He's a peace.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; The Bible, they don't know. All they
[1:00:05] know how to do, jump up and down, speak
[1:00:07] in tong, say, "I got the Holy Ghost."
[1:00:08] Hallelujah. I've stood and seen in
[1:00:10] Africa witch doctors and things speak by
[1:00:12] the 5 thousands of them at a time
[1:00:14] jumping up and down blood all over their
[1:00:16] faces speaking in tongues and drink
[1:00:18] blood out of a human skull call on the
[1:00:20] devil and speak in tongues
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; and yet speaking in tonesues is a gift
[1:00:25] of God
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; but that's not the infallible proof of
[1:00:28] the Holy Ghost that
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; I do believe that all inspired saints
[1:00:33] speak with tongues I believe a man
[1:00:35] sometime when you get so inspired with
[1:00:37] God because you speak with tongues. I
[1:00:39] believe that. But I don't believe that's
[1:00:41] any sign you got the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I believe there's times when
[1:00:44] you have faith. A person can walk out
[1:00:46] and lay hands on a little kid that's got
[1:00:48] a cancer and 50 preachers that pray for
[1:00:50] it and to be healed because that mother
[1:00:52] has faith for that child. God's given it
[1:00:54] to her. She's a member of the body of
[1:00:55] Christ.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I believe that. I've seen that
[1:00:58] done and I know that's true. But what it
[1:01:02] is is get the church in order, setting
[1:01:05] order so we can work. Now, let's finish
[1:01:08] the rest of this verse here before we
[1:01:10] go. After that, you receive, you were
[1:01:12] sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise.
[1:01:15] Sealed. What is a seal?
[1:01:20] What is a seal? A seal is first thing it
[1:01:25] shows is a work that has been completed.
[1:01:32] A completed work. The next thing it
[1:01:34] shows is ownership.
[1:01:36] And the next thing it shows is security,
[1:01:40] keeping it. Say, for instance, I used to
[1:01:43] work for the Pennsylvania Railroad. I
[1:01:45] used to work with my father on the
[1:01:46] railroad. We would load cars and we'd
[1:01:49] put in down here at this package
[1:01:51] company. We'd put in 10 cans and we'd
[1:01:54] set some up here and some down here and
[1:01:55] some up this way. But before that car
[1:01:58] was ever sealed, the inspector come
[1:02:00] through there
[1:02:02] and he pushed on it, shoved on this one,
[1:02:07] shook that one. Ah, condemn it. They'll
[1:02:12] break all the pieces before they get
[1:02:13] there. Condemn it. Take them out. Do it
[1:02:16] over. Inspector, condemn the car. The
[1:02:19] Holy Ghost is the inspector.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; He shake you a little bit in your
[1:02:23] rattle.
[1:02:27] You believe all the word of God. I don't
[1:02:28] believe that old Jesus name stuff.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Condemn it.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; You'll rattle.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; I don't believe in divine healing and
[1:02:36] those such a thing.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Still rattled out. You believe Jesus
[1:02:41] Christ is saying yes to well in some
[1:02:44] way. You rattle. Kick it out. Get ready.
[1:02:47] Yes,
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; brother. When it's ready to say amen.
[1:02:51] Have you received the Holy Ghost? Amen.
[1:02:53] Has everything been completed? Amen.
[1:02:56] Then what does the inspector do?
[1:02:58] Everything's packed in good and tight.
[1:03:00] Full of the gospel. Oh, every word of
[1:03:03] God is good. Everything is perfect. I
[1:03:06] believe every word. Amen. Amen. Amen. Do
[1:03:09] you believe that God still heals? Amen.
[1:03:12] You believe Jesus yesterday and forever?
[1:03:14] Amen. You believe the Holy Ghost is just
[1:03:16] as real as it ever was. Amen. You
[1:03:18] believe the same spirit fell on Paul on
[1:03:20] us? Amen. You believe it does the same
[1:03:22] things on us that did on them? Amen. Uh
[1:03:25] oh, she's getting tight now.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Getting tight now. We're ready to close
[1:03:29] the door.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; All right. Then the inspector closes the
[1:03:33] door. What does he do? He puts a seal on
[1:03:35] it. Then he gets down here. He gets a
[1:03:37] hold of these little pliers of the
[1:03:38] thing. Reaches over there on this little
[1:03:40] thing and seals that. You'd better not
[1:03:43] break it.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; If that car is destination is Boston, it
[1:03:49] cannot be broken. It would be a
[1:03:52] penitentiary offense. They'll break that
[1:03:54] seal until it gets to Boston. And a man
[1:03:57] that has the authority can open that
[1:03:59] seal in him only.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; It's owned by this certain certain
[1:04:05] railroad company. It's their seal. It's
[1:04:08] their assurance that this car has been
[1:04:11] packed. This car is ready. It belongs to
[1:04:14] them. They couldn't put the BNO on the
[1:04:17] Pennsylvania. You've got to be sealed.
[1:04:20] And when it's sealed, and when the
[1:04:22] Christian is packed with the gospel,
[1:04:24] filled with the goodness of God, all the
[1:04:26] good things of God laying in him with an
[1:04:28] open heart, ready to work, willing to be
[1:04:31] positionally pleased, do anything that
[1:04:34] the Holy Spirit tells him to do, pass
[1:04:36] from death unto life, sanctified from
[1:04:38] all things of the world, walking in the
[1:04:40] light as the light comes to him, moving
[1:04:42] on. He's ready. Then God shuts the door
[1:04:45] of the world behind me, kicks it
[1:04:47] together like that and seals him with
[1:04:49] the Holy Ghost of power.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; How long until the destination?
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Don't get him out here on the railroad
[1:05:00] track and break it open and see if
[1:05:01] everything's all right again. It's all
[1:05:03] right. Just leave it alone.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; The inspector has done inspected it.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; How long are you sealed? Until the day
[1:05:12] of your redemption. Amen.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; That's how long you're sealed.
[1:05:16] Well, when you die then, brother
[1:05:18] Brandham, what about if you die? You
[1:05:19] said you still have it. You have it
[1:05:21] forever.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Where does life begin? At the altar
[1:05:26] right there, you see a little bit of
[1:05:28] shadow. That's the shadow, the seal, the
[1:05:30] Holy Spirit. Then it's a shadow of the
[1:05:33] shadows of the shadows, as I said the
[1:05:35] other day. But when you die, you keep on
[1:05:38] going through those shadows until you
[1:05:40] come to moisture. From moisture to a
[1:05:42] little trickling spring, from a spring
[1:05:44] to a creek, from a creek to a river,
[1:05:46] from a river to an ocean. See, of the
[1:05:48] love of God,
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; you're just the same person.
[1:05:53] Look at here. Old Saul, the old
[1:05:55] backslider, he could not get through to
[1:05:58] God. Yet, he wasn't lost.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; He certainly wasn't. He was a prophet,
[1:06:03] but he just got outside of God. That's
[1:06:06] the reason, brother, and I said you're
[1:06:07] not lost. So then remember he just got
[1:06:10] out of the will of God. So then the
[1:06:12] first thing you know you wouldn't agree.
[1:06:14] Now maybe I shouldn't have said that.
[1:06:18] All right I'm just going on for a happy
[1:06:20] congregation tonight.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; So then
[1:06:26] you know and the first thing you know oh
[1:06:29] my then he went to the Yurundum. You
[1:06:33] know what the year of my mathundum was
[1:06:35] is a breastplate the f of at at the
[1:06:37] Aaron war and it was always God always
[1:06:40] has been a supernatural God answering in
[1:06:42] supernatural ways. And when a prophet
[1:06:45] prophesied and them mystic lights didn't
[1:06:47] come across that ur thunder, he was
[1:06:49] wrong. When a dreamer told a dream and
[1:06:52] it didn't flash on that urum thundum, I
[1:06:54] don't care how good it sound, it was
[1:06:56] wrong.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; And it's right. And I don't care just
[1:06:59] exactly how many doctor's degrees you
[1:07:01] got and how big your organization is.
[1:07:04] When you prophesy, preach it in
[1:07:06] according to this word, you're wrong,
[1:07:08] brethren.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; You're This is God's thunder.
[1:07:12] When you say you wasn't predestinated
[1:07:14] before the foundation of the world, she
[1:07:16] won't flash because the Bible said you
[1:07:18] was.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; When you say that you are be baptized
[1:07:21] name of father, son, holy ghost, it
[1:07:23] doesn't flash because nobody in the
[1:07:25] Bible's ever baptized that way.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Only the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; It won't flash.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; So there's something wrong somewhere. So
[1:07:33] the Europe thunder wouldn't answer old
[1:07:35] Saul. And he couldn't even have a dream.
[1:07:38] He was so far gone that he couldn't even
[1:07:40] have a dream. So, you know what he done?
[1:07:42] He went down to the witch
[1:07:44] and this old witch, the old devil doctor
[1:07:47] down there, witch doctor. And he said,
[1:07:50] "Can you divine?" She said, "Yes, but
[1:07:52] Saul said he'd kill everybody divine."
[1:07:54] He said, "I'll protect you dressed like
[1:07:56] a footman." He said, "Divine for me and
[1:07:59] bring me up from the world of the dead
[1:08:02] that's passed on beyond here." Now,
[1:08:04] listen to this. Bring me up the spirit
[1:08:07] of Samuel the prophet. And she went into
[1:08:10] to the vine. And when she did, she fell
[1:08:12] on her face. She said, "I see gods
[1:08:15] coming up." See, she's a heathen gods.
[1:08:19] Two or three of them, like father, son,
[1:08:20] holy ghost or something like that, you
[1:08:21] know. She said, she said, "I see gods
[1:08:24] coming up."
[1:08:26] Said, "Describe him. How does he look?"
[1:08:29] What does he look like? Said, "He's thin
[1:08:33] and he's got a mantle over his
[1:08:35] shoulders."
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. yet. Amen.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's Samuel. Bring him in this
[1:08:44] room. Bring him here before me." And
[1:08:47] watch when Samuel come before Saul, he
[1:08:49] said, "Why did you call me seeing you
[1:08:52] become an enemy to God?" And watch, not
[1:08:55] only was he still Samuel, he still
[1:08:59] maintained the spirit of prophecy.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Say it's wrong. Amen.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Let anyone say it's wrong.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. He was still a prophet
[1:09:13] for he said he prophesied and said the
[1:09:15] battle's going against you tomorrow and
[1:09:17] you and your sons will fall in battle
[1:09:19] tomorrow and but this time tomorrow
[1:09:21] night you'll be with me.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; He was still a prophet.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Now you say, "Oh, but that was a witch
[1:09:29] did that." All right. I'll tell you when
[1:09:31] it wasn't a witch.
[1:09:34] Jesus took Peter or James and John and
[1:09:36] went up the mount transfiguration one
[1:09:37] time and was standing up on top of the
[1:09:40] mountain and Jesus God was placing his
[1:09:43] son like I'm trying to had the other
[1:09:45] night placing son and when they did they
[1:09:48] looked around and found out that there
[1:09:50] stood Moses and Elijah
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; they were talking
[1:09:57] communing not little white flags
[1:09:59] floating around or little white clouds
[1:10:01] rather floating around but they were
[1:10:03] Amen.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Talking Moses had been buried in an
[1:10:08] unmarked grave for 800 years.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; And Elijah had went home in a chariot
[1:10:15] 500 years.
[1:10:18] And here they both was still just as
[1:10:20] much alive as they ever was alive,
[1:10:23] standing there talking to him before he
[1:10:25] went to Calvary.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. sealed
[1:10:32] until the day of our redemption.
[1:10:51] How many can say praise the Lord?
[1:10:55] Moses 800 years. Elijah 500 years.
[1:11:00] Brother, I'm only 60 years.
[1:11:03] Still a prophet, still alive. That's in
[1:11:06] the Bible. And when they come back, not
[1:11:10] if they come back, when they come back,
[1:11:12] they'll still be a prophet. And they
[1:11:14] maintain the spirit of prophecy. Amen.
[1:11:17] Is that what we heard tonight?
[1:11:20] Praise the Lord. Thank God. We have a
[1:11:23] few prayer requests here tonight. Please
