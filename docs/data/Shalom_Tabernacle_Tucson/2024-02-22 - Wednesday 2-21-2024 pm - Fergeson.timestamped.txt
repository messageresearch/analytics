[35:02] and now I I'll believe in on Friday to

[35:09] for me a lot of stuff to do and uh so I
[35:13] want you all to keep me in your prayer
[35:15] that the Lord will be with me I had a
[35:17] call from my dear friend and Buddy
[35:19] brother attim
[35:20] mosaka and him and brother man which man
[35:23] is you don't know these brothers he's a
[35:25] missionary to the
[35:27] pygmies and what's outstanding about the
[35:30] pygmies is when the Catholics sent the
[35:33] missionaries into Africa the pygmies
[35:35] never responded just just a few of them
[35:39] and then the Baptist and the
[35:40] missionaries in and the pygmies never
[35:42] responded this state with their
[35:43] traditional way of
[35:45] worship and then the Pentecostal send
[35:47] their missionaries into Africa and the
[35:48] pygmies never responded until this
[35:51] message came yeah and when this message
[35:54] came we estimate it's close to maybe 100
[35:57] 75,000 Pig mes that believe this
[36:00] message and it is in the Democratic
[36:03] Republic of the Congo where we probably
[36:05] have about 1.6 million Believers of this
[36:07] message there it's the biggest in the
[36:09] world of any country and so um as the
[36:13] pygmies begin because they live in the
[36:15] Deep dense forest and I remember meeting
[36:19] some of them for the first time when I
[36:20] was in
[36:21] lumo it was one of the first meetings I
[36:24] had in lumo and I saw this lady she was
[36:27] probably no bigger than about that and I
[36:30] thought it was a little girl and then
[36:31] she was carrying a baby on her back and
[36:33] two of them and then I saw another one
[36:34] like this and when I pray I realized
[36:36] that it was not a a little girl it was
[36:39] an adult she was an adult she was a
[36:41] woman and the little bitt people and
[36:44] anyway uh uh what they did is barachi he
[36:48] built a a hospital in the in the pygmies
[36:52] among the pygmies so he was calling me
[36:53] giving me a little report and of course
[36:55] the United Nations held on organization
[36:57] got involved in it and stuff so um
[37:00] they've invited me to come and I don't
[37:02] know I've been praying the Lord I don't
[37:04] think I can make it in they'd like for
[37:06] me to come for a convention among the
[37:07] pig me people back in April I can't see
[37:10] how I could make it I just don't think
[37:13] so but um I want you all to remember
[37:15] them in prayer and there was an in
[37:17] incident took place just recently you
[37:20] probably heard about it is that some of
[37:22] the radical
[37:24] Muslims there's a church in the eastern
[37:28] part of the Congo in the what we call
[37:30] close to the iori region which is right
[37:33] close up to the border with
[37:35] Uganda and uh it's a little bitty
[37:38] Village and of course message churches
[37:40] are scattered through all the little
[37:42] Villages and stuff there and the Islamic
[37:44] extremists attacked this Village they
[37:46] killed 30 people they attacked the
[37:49] Church of the message was a it's a small
[37:51] Church they killed a pastor and they
[37:54] killed eight members of the church they
[37:56] captured some of the people and among
[37:59] those that they captured was the
[38:00] pastor's wife they killed him and they
[38:03] kept they kidnapped rather his wife and
[38:05] she escaped from them and fled into the
[38:08] forest and that happened about three
[38:10] weeks ago and as of now we've had no
[38:13] reports of her we do not know if the
[38:16] Muslim extremist recaptured her we do
[38:18] not know if she's still alive or what I
[38:21] want you all to remember them in prayer
[38:22] they left behind eight children and so
[38:26] we've been trying to see what we can do
[38:27] if we can send some relief some help to
[38:30] those children um so we're trying to
[38:33] it's very very hard to get
[38:35] Communications and I've looked at the
[38:37] international news and to my surprise
[38:39] it's nowh on the international news of
[38:41] course there's a lot of things that even
[38:43] I witnessed myself in traveling to these
[38:45] countries as a missionary that was never
[38:48] reported on the news until one day the
[38:52] uh the um the Canadian embassy called
[38:56] called me in and they told me they says
[38:58] we know that you've been traveling to
[39:00] some of these countries into some of
[39:01] these regions they said it's very
[39:03] dangerous some of the places you've been
[39:05] traveling and so we would like for you
[39:07] to give us a report on where you go and
[39:10] what activities you're doing and of
[39:12] course that to me was a no no because if
[39:14] I give a report then you know I'm going
[39:17] for the gospel I'm not involved in all
[39:18] the political and and the all the
[39:21] turbulance and all what's going on there
[39:22] I'm just going for the gospel of the
[39:24] Lord Jesus Christ and so you know I just
[39:26] said the Lord you know you will be done
[39:27] I never gave the Canadian embassy a
[39:29] report on it and then they sent the
[39:32] biggest uh
[39:34] broadcasting in in Canada the CBC sent
[39:37] their reporters in to the church to have
[39:40] a personal interview with me because
[39:41] there's very few Canadians that were eye
[39:43] weaknesses of some of the stuff that
[39:45] took place in many of these countries
[39:46] and I was there I could said I was there
[39:49] I saw this this happened that happened
[39:51] and therefore I told myself look I'm not
[39:53] a reporter so when they came into the
[39:56] church I ran into the basement and hid
[39:57] from them I don't know Sharon remember
[39:59] that she was probably a little girl at
[40:01] the time young at the time when when
[40:03] this happened and then the Global Mail
[40:06] which is Canada's largest newspaper they
[40:08] wanted to publish you know story and my
[40:10] report and what I've done and stuff and
[40:12] I kind of Shun from these things you
[40:14] know the public city out there kind of
[40:16] shun it because you know we doing it all
[40:18] for the honor and for the glory of God
[40:20] Amen but what I I'm praying about which
[40:24] I would love to do because many if you
[40:26] sitting here have never already met some
[40:29] of what brother brandham called the
[40:31] rugged missionaries and these are the
[40:33] people that take the gospel take the
[40:35] message into the deepest parts of the
[40:37] forest and I've happened to meet some of
[40:40] them some of them are close friends of
[40:43] mine I was thinking I spoke at brother
[40:45] Israel here your pastor and I told him
[40:47] maybe we can have maybe one day a
[40:49] meeting and instead of having it the way
[40:51] he does it maybe a missionary conference
[40:54] and bring maybe one or two of these
[40:55] missionaries in that can tell you a
[40:57] little bit about the work what they have
[40:59] done because God has done a tremendous
[41:01] work and of course we've heard about it
[41:03] we heard about the tens of thousands
[41:05] because what's happening in North
[41:07] America people talking about are falling
[41:09] away and from the message and stuff
[41:12] that's unheard of in the Central African
[41:14] Rep countries of course there's always
[41:16] confusion you know and one think this
[41:18] and the other believe this and you know
[41:20] you're always have that everywhere but
[41:21] the numbers in the message just seems to
[41:23] be exploding and just growing and
[41:25] growing and growing
[41:26] in many of these countries including you
[41:29] know countries like Angola and Gabon and
[41:32] some of the countries that you probably
[41:34] have just heard of but um it's just been
[41:37] continually growing God has done a
[41:40] mighty work among the the people in
[41:43] these countries and well certainly I
[41:45] really I thank the Lord that in his love
[41:48] and mercy he used me in a little way to
[41:50] be able to spearhead some of the work
[41:53] that has been done in these countries we
[41:54] have tens of thousands of Believers has
[41:57] come of course in my little Ministry
[41:59] what the Lord has given me the most I've
[42:01] ever seen come under my Ministry is I
[42:05] remember about or it must have been
[42:07] about 15 years maybe 15 or 20 years ago
[42:11] I went into the uh Congo what we call
[42:15] Congo brazille with brother Isaac
[42:18] brandham and I had three services there
[42:21] and in the three services there were 100
[42:24] there were over one th000 the brothers
[42:27] estimated around 1,500 converts that
[42:30] gave their hearts to the Lord Jesus
[42:32] Christ and of course I couldn't stay to
[42:34] baptize all these people so the local
[42:37] pastors baptize about 1,500 Believers
[42:41] imagine a church growing by 1,500 after
[42:44] three services three services see so
[42:48] it's just been amazing the things what
[42:51] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ has
[42:53] done and to him we give the honor and
[42:56] and the glory and don't forget you pray
[42:58] for them because don't limit your vision
[43:00] to your family or to the community that
[43:02] you live remember that that brother
[43:05] random saw the bride coming from all
[43:06] over the world see so it's a worldwide
[43:09] bride and of course I could tell you a
[43:11] lot that things what I've seen what the
[43:13] Lord has given me the privilege but
[43:14] tonight we're going to cut a little bit
[43:16] on that and get to what we want to look
[43:18] at with the word of the Lord but I just
[43:20] want you all to remember especially that
[43:22] family with the Muslim there was um one
[43:25] of the Muslim families excuse me one of
[43:29] our brothers he's a missionary and he
[43:30] left Chad and Chad is a Muslim country
[43:33] but there are some Muslim countries that
[43:34] are not we call radical Muslim countries
[43:38] so when I visited Chad I was really
[43:40] welcomed by the authorities even if they
[43:41] were Muslims I was treated very good by
[43:45] the by the people I was even amazed that
[43:47] I was accepted as a Christian in such a
[43:50] respectable way when I went to Chad the
[43:52] chadian authorities did all they could
[43:54] to welcome me when I went but of course
[43:57] some countries are not like that in a
[44:00] country like Al Algeria even Muslims are
[44:03] killing Muslims so just imagine they go
[44:05] into Villages where they don't agree at
[44:07] machetes and stuff and they kill one
[44:08] another so just imagine what they will
[44:10] do to ask Christians so they kidnapped
[44:13] some of the missionaries some brothers
[44:15] killed them some Christians so we had
[44:18] one missionary and his wife he went to
[44:21] Algeria and while he was there he was
[44:23] kidnapped by some of the M some of the
[44:25] the most radicals usually when they
[44:27] kidnap you that's the end of you if you
[44:30] don't sometime they ask Ransom sometime
[44:32] if the ransom isn't paid it's the end of
[44:34] you so we kept praying and praying and
[44:36] praying and he was kidnapped for a
[44:38] little over six months and then finally
[44:41] the Muslim radicals released him and so
[44:44] thank the Lord he was released and we
[44:45] are so grateful to God we got news that
[44:48] he was released by them so I want you
[44:51] all you know to pray for those
[44:52] missionaries it's been rough and some of
[44:54] them taking this gospel into the jungles
[44:57] and different places and the work that
[44:59] God has done and to him we give the
[45:01] honor and the praise amen now
[45:05] tonight we want to look at a different
[45:08] subject and I I pray that this will be a
[45:10] blessing to us and of course some of the
[45:13] the best Services I've had was with
[45:15] little groups of people that we've came
[45:17] in and the anointing came down and the
[45:18] Holy Spirit blessed us and such a
[45:20] blessing amen amen and you you heard me
[45:23] say that I've I mean I've preached
[45:24] probably some of the biggest of the
[45:26] largest congregations or gatherings in
[45:28] this message and the biggest group I've
[45:29] ever preached to in my life was a
[45:31] Congregation of about
[45:33] 25,000 and in a convention in Africa and
[45:36] that's the biggest and of course groups
[45:39] of 10 15,000 people and the smallest
[45:42] I've ever preached to was a Congregation
[45:45] of two in maray France towards the south
[45:49] of France and there was four of us there
[45:51] was brother F that went with me f FR p
[45:56] the pastor of the church and I so we
[45:58] were four pastors and two members two
[46:02] members of the congregation and the sad
[46:05] part of it is after I finished preaching
[46:07] and I left a couple of months later
[46:10] someone came into my say and split that
[46:12] chur took one of
[46:18] [Laughter]
[46:23] M certainly grateful to God Amen that
[46:28] you might think well we got a small
[46:30] [Laughter]
[46:34] Church what I did I I pushed my heart
[46:37] out and I never forgot the message I
[46:38] preached on the light of the day the
[46:40] light what is light and I preached my
[46:42] heart out to that little two people
[46:45] sitting in the
[46:47] congregation oh my well God bless you
[46:50] all
[46:51] amen tonight we want to speak on the
[46:55] assurance that God has given us the
[46:58] assurance that God gives us that we have
[47:01] eternal life okay and um I really trust
[47:07] that it would
[47:09] be a blessing to you
[47:13] amen um now I'll take two
[47:18] scriptures to be able as we go forward
[47:21] on this I'll take two
[47:23] scriptures we will all stand for a
[47:26] little word of prayer just to pray
[47:28] Father in heaven we honor you yes Lord
[47:32] with our prayer with our than as David
[47:35] said it I was glad when they said unto
[47:37] me let us go into the house of the Lord
[47:40] and father there's no better place that
[47:42] we could come to enjoy your presence and
[47:44] your blessings than to come into a
[47:46] little place like this that's been
[47:48] dedicated and set aside for you and know
[47:51] God as Israel tries you our brother our
[47:54] pastor here tries to point these people
[47:57] to you and to your message oh God may
[47:59] you anoint him give him the wisdom
[48:01] father oh god of Heaven bless this
[48:03] little congregation father oh God we so
[48:06] thank you for him for his efforts his
[48:09] Zeal his love for you we see Lord your
[48:12] spirit working his life and how happy we
[48:15] are for it Lord and this little
[48:17] congregation father to stand with him
[48:20] and to pray that he will multiply the
[48:23] work here in tucon Lord that it will be
[48:24] a little lighthouse for your name and
[48:26] for your honor and Glory we ask it in
[48:29] Jesus lovely name
[48:32] amen now we want to look at Matthew chap
[48:35] 4 verse
[48:36] 1-7 Matthew chap 4 verse 1-7 this is
[48:41] after Jesus was at the banks of the
[48:43] River Jordan and the Holy Spirit came
[48:45] down upon him then was Jesus led up of
[48:48] the spirit Into the Wilderness to be
[48:50] tempted of the devil and when he had
[48:53] fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was was
[48:55] afterwards hungered and when the tempter
[48:58] came to him he said if thou be the Son
[49:01] of God command that these Stones be made
[49:04] bread but he answered and said it is
[49:07] written man shall not live by bread
[49:09] alone but by every word that proceeded
[49:12] out of the mouth of God then the devil
[49:14] take him up up into the holy city and
[49:17] set him up on the Pinnacle of the temple
[49:20] and said unto him if thou be the Son of
[49:23] God cast thyself down for it is written
[49:26] he shall give his angels charge
[49:28] concerning thee and in their hands they
[49:30] shall bear thee up lest at any time thou
[49:33] Dash thy foot against the stone and
[49:35] Jesus said unto him it is written again
[49:38] Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God
[49:42] this is very good because you know I
[49:44] used to think years ago that we have to
[49:47] have temptations and then I realize no
[49:49] we can ask God to Deliver Us from
[49:51] Temptations we could tell the devil
[49:53] Satan stop tempting me me have you ever
[49:56] told the devil
[49:58] that there's something else I'll tell
[50:00] you about that in a little bit okay
[50:02] it'll probably be a blessing to you now
[50:06] um I want
[50:08] to I want to take another
[50:12] scripture found in John chapter
[50:16] 14 let me see if I have it
[50:19] here no I don't have it
[50:22] here Al I'll get it from my
[50:27] here excuse me John
[50:31] chapter
[50:34] 14
[50:38] and we'll read from verse
[50:40] 16 and I will pray the father and he
[50:44] shall give you another comforter that he
[50:46] may abide with you forever even the
[50:48] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[50:51] receive because it seeth him not neither
[50:54] knoweth him but he know know him for he
[50:56] dwelleth with you and shall be in you I
[50:59] will not leave you comfortless I will
[51:01] come unto you yet a little while and the
[51:04] world see it me no more but he see me
[51:07] because I live he shall live also at
[51:10] that day he shall know that I'm in my
[51:12] father and he in me and I in you a
[51:17] father may it please you to bless us and
[51:19] bless your word we pray as we look to
[51:22] you in Jesus name amen God bless you all
[51:27] you can be seated now we will not go
[51:30] back on
[51:33] um we will not go back on the message on
[51:37] Sunday it's impossible for us to go back
[51:39] and recap it but just to mention that in
[51:43] God's economy the greatest thing that
[51:46] God can give to you is eternal life and
[51:49] there is nothing greater than eternal
[51:51] life and if we live all our lives here
[51:55] and we miss eternal life we have missed
[51:57] everything and if we've lived our life
[52:00] here and we gained eternal life we have
[52:02] gained everything and we went deep into
[52:05] the message on Sunday to show that there
[52:08] Comes A Time in your life where God
[52:10] gives you eternal life so the eternal
[52:14] life is there it is in God it is the
[52:16] part of God and then God gives you
[52:19] eternal life and when you receive
[52:20] eternal life you become as Eternal as
[52:23] God is we went to show that that eternal
[52:26] life comes down in your own life so I
[52:29] receive eternal life in my life and my
[52:33] life I give to him and your life you
[52:36] give to him and Sunday we went deep into
[52:38] that now tonight we're going to change
[52:41] direction we're not going to go much
[52:43] into that and then we're going to say to
[52:46] to to go into this God proven God giving
[52:49] you the proof that you have eternal life
[52:52] or the assurance that you have eternal
[52:54] life now Jesus here says as we read the
[52:58] scriptures here of John chapter 14 where
[53:02] he says at that day that's this day you
[53:05] shall know that I'm in my father he in
[53:07] me and I in you so there have to come a
[53:10] time in your life in your walk with the
[53:12] Lord that you will know that God is in
[53:15] you you see you've heard it with the
[53:18] hearing of the ear but there come a time
[53:20] when you will know for
[53:22] sure you would have that deep inner
[53:25] peace and that Assurance you will know
[53:27] all the doubts are gone you will know
[53:30] that God is within you now I want to
[53:33] stop to say this the age in which we
[53:36] live in brother brandom says one of the
[53:39] characteristics of this age in which we
[53:42] living is that the people is not
[53:45] sure deep in their hearts there's a lack
[53:48] of assurance and that is
[53:52] normal because if I try to assure myself
[53:55] self with an intellectual capacity is
[53:58] not going to work because intellectual
[54:00] faith is based on reasoning and
[54:03] intellectual and human love is based on
[54:05] reasoning you see that power to reason
[54:07] and while it's reasoning the prophet of
[54:09] God says that reason is like the shiting
[54:11] Sands of the sea so there will always be
[54:13] a question mark coming but the funny
[54:16] thing about is even Believers with the
[54:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the life
[54:20] of God within them could still have a
[54:22] question mark which we will show you why
[54:24] in a little bit and what is the
[54:26] difference okay amen are you listening
[54:29] yes sir all right now brother Brandon
[54:32] told us this and so we will start with
[54:35] this
[54:38] here um just before I yes that's correct
[54:41] I could start with it right
[54:44] away
[54:46] amen he quotes the
[54:51] scripture I'm sorry here just excuse me
[54:54] here I want to want to be sure I don't
[54:56] get my notes mixed up like what brother
[54:58] Billy Paul says he watching when he
[54:59] begins to get his note mixed up brother
[55:01] Billy used to tease me on that so yeah
[55:04] all right so here it is want to share
[55:06] this with you think it will be a
[55:08] blessing to
[55:10] you now in the message proven his
[55:17] word where is
[55:21] that yeah should be here I'm sorry yeah
[55:25] that's correct in the message proven his
[55:28] word brother brandham says
[55:32] here he said you know there's a
[55:34] scripture in the Bible in 1
[55:36] Thessalonians
[55:37] 5:21 where it is written prove all
[55:41] things yes and hold fast to that which
[55:44] is
[55:46] good when anything is proven it will
[55:49] either be proven right or
[55:52] wrong and when there's anything in
[55:56] question it should be proven until you
[55:58] find out what is right so even if
[56:00] there's a question concerning eternal
[56:04] life or the baptism of the Holy Ghost or
[56:07] the Seal of God it should be
[56:10] proven he said brother Ferguson could I
[56:13] prove yes God wants you to prove all
[56:17] things don't be afraid to prove
[56:20] it not he didn't say doubt it he says
[56:24] prove it it there's a difference between
[56:27] doubting it and proving it so the Bible
[56:31] says prove all things but bandam
[56:34] continues he says and when there's
[56:36] anything in question it should be proven
[56:39] until you find out what is right and
[56:42] then as you find what is right it says
[56:44] hold fast in other words grip it and
[56:48] don't turn it loose hold it fast in
[56:51] other words hold it tight so that it
[56:54] will not SL clip hold fast to that which
[56:56] is good after it's been proven right so
[57:01] you don't grip it until it's being
[57:03] proven right the first thing is prove it
[57:07] and we are not afraid to prove it and we
[57:10] are to prove all
[57:12] things all right now we will go a little
[57:15] deep into this so God is telling you to
[57:17] prove it now brother brandham goes on
[57:20] and he says anything that's proven not
[57:22] right then turn it loose as quick as you
[57:24] can and get away from it don't never
[57:27] hold on to the wrong things now it is
[57:30] possible that stun Christians find
[57:32] people hold sometimes hold to the wrong
[57:35] thing thinking it is right but then
[57:38] these things should be proven whether
[57:39] they're right or wrong and it is the
[57:42] duty of all of us as we expecting to go
[57:46] to heaven when Jesus
[57:48] comes and it is The Minister's Duty that
[57:51] when any question is brought up that he
[57:53] soles us out and then proves it before
[57:56] the people that they might understand
[58:00] now we spoke about that the importance
[58:01] of understanding we will not go into
[58:03] that tonight that they might understand
[58:05] because no one wants to be found wrong
[58:07] holding to the wrong thing so we have a
[58:10] scripture and Jesus says all scriptures
[58:13] must be fulfilled that we should prove
[58:15] all things and then hold fast or hold
[58:19] tight get a dead grip and don't turn it
[58:21] loose hold fast to that which is good so
[58:23] brother bham says here it is The
[58:25] Minister's Duty when anything is brought
[58:27] up that he solves this out and then
[58:29] proves it before the people that they
[58:31] might understand because no one wants to
[58:33] be found wrong holding to to to the
[58:35] wrong
[58:37] thing and then he goes on to say it is
[58:40] the duty of all of us so it's not just
[58:43] The Minister's Duty it is the duty of
[58:46] all of us to prove it and here is a
[58:49] thing that's happening in this age that
[58:51] we are living in many many many many
[58:54] Believers of this message and I'll talk
[58:56] to you kind of Heart to Heart tonight as
[58:59] a little family together many many
[59:02] Believers and even Ministers of this
[59:04] message will not prove the thing that's
[59:06] true we I'll go a little deep into it
[59:09] when I because you see the reason is
[59:11] when you prove it and you find out that
[59:13] this thing is wrong and you say all it
[59:15] is wrong people think you're against
[59:16] them because you
[59:18] disagree but if I'm wrong on something
[59:21] and someone tells me brother fuson you
[59:22] made a mistake you're wrong I'm happy to
[59:24] be corrected I want to be
[59:28] corrected I've grown by
[59:31] correction and people have come to me
[59:33] with quotes and but I don't want I don't
[59:35] want people's ideas you got your own
[59:37] idea you know I throw it to the trash
[59:39] I'll be honest I tell the people playing
[59:41] you come to me with your own idea
[59:43] please I mean I've traveled to many
[59:45] different countries and I've listened to
[59:47] a lot of ideas of people their opinions
[59:49] their doctrines their interpretation and
[59:51] stuff until sometimes my bhead can
[59:53] hardly contain it
[59:56] so I don't need more of that amen I need
[1:00:00] quotes I need scriptures I need what the
[1:00:04] prophet says I need what the Bible say
[1:00:06] and then my soul is satisfied see so if
[1:00:10] I'm wrong and someone could say brother
[1:00:12] Ferguson here is something or even if
[1:00:13] someone tell me brother Ferguson you
[1:00:15] said this where is the quote it don't
[1:00:16] hurt my feelings I love that I see and I
[1:00:20] believe we all do I believe Israel loves
[1:00:22] that too we've been together many times
[1:00:24] and I and I'll tell him certain things
[1:00:26] and he'd ask me sometime he would ask me
[1:00:27] for the quotes and my what a blessing it
[1:00:29] is to share the message with one another
[1:00:32] so it's very important to do it see to
[1:00:34] hold fast now if God ask you to do a
[1:00:38] certain thing he's not going to ask you
[1:00:40] to do a certain thing that he not doing
[1:00:43] himself so God will prove
[1:00:49] you and God will prove whether you have
[1:00:52] life or
[1:00:53] not
[1:00:55] don't you think that God is just going
[1:00:56] to give you life and it's all and just
[1:00:58] let you die like that he's going to
[1:01:00] prove it and what I like is
[1:01:03] this if God is proven it I want to be
[1:01:07] sure that he's proven it to me but I
[1:01:09] want to know how he does that oh man
[1:01:13] because brother Brandon makes this
[1:01:14] statement and I want to give you all a
[1:01:16] little hint tonight like I told you
[1:01:18] we'll talk to each other like heart to
[1:01:21] heart that sometimes the Holy Ghost
[1:01:23] could come and speak to you yes and you
[1:01:27] don't recognize it's God speaking to you
[1:01:30] absolutely yes sir do you want an
[1:01:33] example in the
[1:01:35] Bible H
[1:01:38] Samuel the Lord came that's right and
[1:01:41] called Samuel
[1:01:44] Samuel and Samuel thought it was
[1:01:47] Eli and he came to Eli and he said thou
[1:01:49] just call me and Eli said I didn't call
[1:01:52] you he said go back and light on
[1:01:55] Samuel went back and Li down and God
[1:01:57] came again Samuel
[1:02:01] Samuel and Samuel got up and he went to
[1:02:03] Eli Eli you did call me and Eli said I
[1:02:06] didn't do it it happened three times and
[1:02:10] then El I begin to realize well hey I
[1:02:12] didn't call him it's God he says go back
[1:02:14] and when he calls you says Speak Lord
[1:02:16] thy servant hear
[1:02:18] it and it's so important for us to be
[1:02:21] able to
[1:02:22] recognize where when God speaks to us
[1:02:26] and when God moves and how God
[1:02:30] acts because it goes over the head of
[1:02:32] many people amen God could come in the
[1:02:34] meeting here tonight in his Simplicity
[1:02:36] and speak to you and many times where
[1:02:38] does he speak to you let me show you
[1:02:41] another little quote I got the quote
[1:02:43] right here I just try to say from time
[1:02:45] if you want to you you should read it
[1:02:47] first but a first I will I got it right
[1:02:49] here but here is
[1:02:51] Elijah and we've heard about Elijah
[1:02:53] being in the the cave and we've read the
[1:02:56] story and maybe preachers has preached
[1:02:58] on it and here is Elijah he's in the
[1:03:02] cave and there was an earthquake that
[1:03:04] went from the earthquake went from the
[1:03:07] Lord and the Bible says but the Lord was
[1:03:09] not in the
[1:03:11] earthquake and there was a fire that
[1:03:13] came from the
[1:03:16] Lord the fire came from the Lord but the
[1:03:19] Lord was not in the fire that's right
[1:03:22] and then what next there was a whirlwind
[1:03:25] that passed my that was that would cause
[1:03:27] people to shout and scream and go wild
[1:03:31] and everything and the Whirlwind passed
[1:03:34] and the Bible says the Whirlwind came
[1:03:35] from the Lord these things came from the
[1:03:37] Lord but the Lord was not in it there
[1:03:40] are many things coming from the Lord but
[1:03:42] the Lord is not in it and then there was
[1:03:44] a still Small Voice I want to ask you a
[1:03:47] little
[1:03:48] question where did that still Small
[1:03:51] Voice
[1:03:52] come you know what brother br said he
[1:03:55] said that still Small Voice was the
[1:03:58] voice that spoke in the heart of Elijah
[1:04:01] Elijah heard that still small voice
[1:04:06] speaking in his
[1:04:10] heart I got the quot
[1:04:15] here and then Elijah pulled himself
[1:04:18] together and listen and the voice here
[1:04:22] said what do thou hear
[1:04:26] Elijah where was he
[1:04:31] speaking many times where does God speak
[1:04:33] to
[1:04:37] you in your
[1:04:40] heart that's still small
[1:04:42] voice but did you recognize
[1:04:45] it some people are so busy with the
[1:04:47] activities of the day they got this to
[1:04:50] do they got that to do yes they got this
[1:04:53] to do they that to do they're on the
[1:04:56] phone with this person and they on the
[1:04:58] phone with that person and they have to
[1:04:59] text this one and text that one they
[1:05:01] have no time to listen to that still
[1:05:05] small voice speaking here in their
[1:05:07] hearts one of these days we'll come back
[1:05:09] again I'll bring you more quotes on that
[1:05:10] there's some things I found what brother
[1:05:12] bam said that we will not going into
[1:05:13] tonight on that voice speaking within
[1:05:15] you but we will not go into that because
[1:05:18] it will take us far away let's come back
[1:05:20] here to what we want to say okay so God
[1:05:23] has awaited proves it yes and he will
[1:05:26] prove that life in you he will prove
[1:05:28] here's what brother brandham said of it
[1:05:32] so I can
[1:05:34] um excuse me I can read
[1:05:37] it for
[1:05:41] you in the message possessing the
[1:05:44] enemy's Gates butam said
[1:05:48] this he says here he made a difference
[1:05:55] he made a showing of what did believe
[1:05:59] and what did not
[1:06:02] believe there's always there three
[1:06:04] crowds of people that is the unbeliever
[1:06:07] the make believer and the believer but
[1:06:09] God has a way of proving who is a
[1:06:14] Believer am
[1:06:17] amen so what you know to me it's a
[1:06:20] blessing if God will prove to me amen
[1:06:24] that I am a a Believer what a blessing
[1:06:28] amen and if God could prove to you that
[1:06:32] you are a Believer what a
[1:06:35] blessing and brother bam is saying here
[1:06:38] but God because if God tell you prove
[1:06:41] all things he's going to tell you to
[1:06:42] prove to do something that he himself is
[1:06:44] not going to do so when he tell you
[1:06:47] prove all things he himself
[1:06:51] provs but many many Believers of this
[1:06:54] message just take for granted that they
[1:06:56] have it and don't go forward to do what
[1:06:59] the Bible says prove all
[1:07:02] things it's as simple as
[1:07:06] that amen amen and if preachers will
[1:07:09] take the time to prove it before they
[1:07:12] preach it we have a different thing in
[1:07:14] the world today I'm not saying all
[1:07:16] preachers doesn't do it there are
[1:07:18] preachers that Pro it before they preach
[1:07:20] it but that's what we should do we
[1:07:21] should bring it to the word and prove
[1:07:24] the thing not with a skeptical attitude
[1:07:28] not with a doubtful attitude not with an
[1:07:30] attitude to reason on the word but to
[1:07:33] see and examine what does the word say
[1:07:36] about it and it's still a duty better
[1:07:39] around him said to do
[1:07:41] it because no one want to be found
[1:07:44] holding into the wrong things I've seen
[1:07:46] people come to me with all kinds of
[1:07:47] stuff I said where is it in the Bible
[1:07:49] yeah where did Brother bam say they have
[1:07:51] no quotes they have no scriptures but
[1:07:54] yet you hold to it how can you hold to
[1:07:56] something what what is the
[1:08:00] foundation you have nothing to stand on
[1:08:03] you are saying it because you believe it
[1:08:04] you think so but the hour has come where
[1:08:07] that has to go and how could it go when
[1:08:10] you prove it yes that's right correct
[1:08:14] now we will see a little bit how you
[1:08:15] prove it and I don't know if my my
[1:08:19] problem tonight is I want to I promise
[1:08:21] myself I'm not going to keep you long
[1:08:22] like I did Sunday night and even if I
[1:08:24] can't finish I'm going to cut it and and
[1:08:26] leave all right is it all right well
[1:08:30] nobody said amen to me there let's
[1:08:33] continue
[1:08:34] here but God has a way of proving who is
[1:08:37] a believer that believer stands firm on
[1:08:41] what God says to be the truth
[1:08:45] yes then brother brandham goes
[1:08:49] on how does he prove that you're a
[1:08:52] believer
[1:08:55] what is God's method of doing it now
[1:08:57] there's a way you do it and there's a
[1:09:00] way God does
[1:09:03] it and the way you do it is different to
[1:09:06] the way God does
[1:09:10] it I'm not here no amen that's all right
[1:09:13] don't say Amen if you're not
[1:09:15] sure see that's all right I'll share it
[1:09:17] with you now because God
[1:09:21] proves and the way that God Prov proves
[1:09:24] it is by testing it we'll go and see
[1:09:27] that
[1:09:28] now so brother bam says here in the
[1:09:30] message this D shall possess NE of his
[1:09:33] enemy
[1:09:34] okay he says here you go through a
[1:09:38] test God test you like he did
[1:09:42] Abraham I'm sorry this is not the right
[1:09:47] one yeah yeah let me read this one for
[1:09:49] you he test Abraham's seed after him
[1:09:54] yeah and now the reason we don't possess
[1:09:56] the Gate of the enemy the reason that
[1:09:58] there's so much Among Us is because we
[1:10:00] are not able to stand the test let me
[1:10:03] tell you something the test of the word
[1:10:05] is right that's what brother man when he
[1:10:07] preached the message how can I overcome
[1:10:09] he told us he said overcoming means to
[1:10:12] be able to stand the test and if God
[1:10:16] give me life that life of God will stand
[1:10:18] a test and if God give you anything and
[1:10:22] then he testes what he give you whatever
[1:10:25] he give you will stand the test amen so
[1:10:28] you don't have to worry about whether
[1:10:30] you pass the test or not I'm not
[1:10:32] worrying whether I will pass the test or
[1:10:34] not if God has given me what I need I'll
[1:10:37] pass the test now here is something that
[1:10:39] all of us must understand as a Christian
[1:10:41] as
[1:10:43] Christians Paul says we are more than
[1:10:45] Overcomers right and it's true but what
[1:10:49] God does is this let's take our little
[1:10:51] brother here what's your name my brother
[1:10:53] brother brother Sean come brother sea
[1:10:55] let me give you a little example now God
[1:10:58] knows that brother Shawn has to go
[1:10:59] through certain tests certain
[1:11:03] trials okay brother Sean himself might
[1:11:06] not know what is coming ahead for him
[1:11:08] all he know is that the test is
[1:11:11] coming and what God does is this God
[1:11:15] gives ban the victory before the test
[1:11:20] comes that's what this message teaches
[1:11:23] amen he gives you the victory he gives
[1:11:26] you what is what is required to overcome
[1:11:29] before the test come so you can says I
[1:11:32] am an overcomer even before the test
[1:11:35] comes but when the test comes then you
[1:11:38] prove that you got it you prove you have
[1:11:40] the victory then the victory you have is
[1:11:42] proven thank you brother all right let's
[1:11:45] go back here to the
[1:11:49] quotes now here's what he says and now
[1:11:52] the reason we it
[1:11:54] we can't stand a test but thank God
[1:11:57] there are many of us we could stand a
[1:11:59] test because what we receive is
[1:12:02] genuine okay now I'll go a little
[1:12:05] further for
[1:12:06] you and I want to share something with
[1:12:08] you here tonight as we got a little bit
[1:12:10] deep into it brother P says here the
[1:12:13] message and I see shall possess the G of
[1:12:15] his enemy and when the test comes the
[1:12:19] testing time then the seed begins it
[1:12:23] shows which is seed and which is
[1:12:28] not regardless of what took place
[1:12:31] Abraham stood with the word the promise
[1:12:33] so the test will show what is seed and
[1:12:36] what is not now when God is going to
[1:12:40] test
[1:12:41] you there is two very very important
[1:12:45] phases of the
[1:12:48] testing there is the testing before you
[1:12:51] receive life
[1:12:55] are you following which we're going to
[1:12:57] look at and there is a testing after you
[1:13:02] receive
[1:13:06] life okay now let's go into it so we
[1:13:10] could look a little bit at
[1:13:12] it don't be afraid of the
[1:13:16] test don't let the devil hear you well I
[1:13:20] don't know what's going to happen to me
[1:13:22] I have all these step and I can hardly
[1:13:24] go through them don't let the devil
[1:13:26] cause you to confess stuff that's
[1:13:27] contrary to the word of
[1:13:30] God God knows what you're going to go to
[1:13:32] and he's already equipped you yes that's
[1:13:35] right that's why brother R says a True
[1:13:37] Believer cannot fail in fact your faith
[1:13:40] knows no failure you might know failures
[1:13:42] but not your faith that's what the
[1:13:44] prophet says so if you make a separation
[1:13:47] between you and your faith the faith
[1:13:49] that God has given me knows no defeat
[1:13:52] because faith is is the victory I could
[1:13:55] fail but not my faith you could fail
[1:13:57] brother SS but not your faith when God
[1:13:59] gives you Faith you've got Victory how
[1:14:02] could that Faith fail
[1:14:04] impossible that's what the prophet tell
[1:14:06] us now let's go on here to see the
[1:14:11] testing before you receive life and the
[1:14:14] testing
[1:14:16] after okay are you following me now
[1:14:21] um let me see then just the Lord help me
[1:14:24] tonight all right let's go quickly so we
[1:14:27] could examine
[1:14:30] it
[1:14:32] okay so God tested you
[1:14:42] before
[1:14:43] okay
[1:14:46] ah brother Brandon mentions here in the
[1:14:49] message when their eyes were open they
[1:14:51] knew him he's talking about the
[1:14:54] disciples on the road to
[1:14:56] EMAs and they were sad and broken and
[1:15:00] disappointed you know
[1:15:02] whatnot see and he said here and said
[1:15:05] are you just they said to him are you
[1:15:07] just a stranger around here and you
[1:15:08] don't know what's these things that's
[1:15:09] when Jesus was with them and he said
[1:15:12] what things just like he didn't know
[1:15:13] nothing about it see he said that just
[1:15:16] to throw them off and he did that
[1:15:18] purposely just to try and don't you know
[1:15:21] he doesn't change his nature
[1:15:23] he does the same thing just to try you
[1:15:26] to see what you will do he'll work
[1:15:28] around somewhere it'll be thrown before
[1:15:31] you and just to see what you say about
[1:15:35] it so the Holy Ghost is there trying
[1:15:38] listening to see what you say about it
[1:15:41] when you go through the trial which we
[1:15:42] will look at the trials before the you
[1:15:44] receive life and the trial after you
[1:15:46] receive life we look at it a little we
[1:15:49] look at it in a little bit see now let's
[1:15:52] say God TR to trial at you and then he
[1:15:56] watches to see what you will say about
[1:15:59] it a lot of people doesn't realize that
[1:16:01] what you say is important to God what
[1:16:04] you say is important and what you don't
[1:16:06] say is important some people say well I
[1:16:09] would say nothing that's wrong because
[1:16:11] if you don't confess me before man you
[1:16:13] see it's important for you if you have
[1:16:15] faith there's a confession so what you
[1:16:17] say and I'm telling you the honest truth
[1:16:19] the only way you wouldn't say nothing is
[1:16:20] if you're
[1:16:21] dumb right
[1:16:23] if you stricken with dumbness is the
[1:16:25] only way you're going to you're not
[1:16:26] going to say nothing I've seen people
[1:16:28] that try to hold their peace and after a
[1:16:30] while they come a time and point where
[1:16:31] they're going to have to
[1:16:33] speak and then they say whatever the
[1:16:36] Bible said from the abundance of the
[1:16:38] heart of the
[1:16:39] heart the
[1:16:41] mouth let's repeat let's repeat it from
[1:16:44] the abundance of the heart the
[1:16:49] mouth now you could see the person that
[1:16:51] is the most quiet person in the world
[1:16:53] hang around him a little bit and you
[1:16:56] would see that scripture fulfilled from
[1:16:58] the abundance of the heart the
[1:17:00] mouth don't forget don't look at
[1:17:03] conditions look at the word because
[1:17:04] whatever God said in his word he is
[1:17:06] always
[1:17:08] [Music]
[1:17:10] right so he he he puts you to it and the
[1:17:14] Holy Spirit is
[1:17:17] listening God is a good listening you
[1:17:20] know to
[1:17:22] see what you will
[1:17:24] say what are you going to
[1:17:27] say and Satan do Satan is anxious for
[1:17:29] you to say the wrong things yeah to
[1:17:32] displease the Lord he wants you to say
[1:17:33] the thing that you shouldn't
[1:17:35] say which tonight we could we could take
[1:17:38] a whole sermon and going into that just
[1:17:40] talking about saying the right thing
[1:17:41] saying the wrong thing remember was the
[1:17:43] third pister had said the right thing
[1:17:45] and brother Bram in the unveiling of God
[1:17:47] he said you must say the right things to
[1:17:48] God so I've always prayed and that's why
[1:17:50] David said in the Psalms he said let the
[1:17:52] meditation of my heart be acceptable
[1:17:54] unto the oh Lord so we want to be able
[1:17:56] to what is in our hearts and what we say
[1:17:58] we want to be able to be acceptable to
[1:18:00] the Lord and I realize this in my ways
[1:18:02] is you know as the Holy Spirit comes and
[1:18:03] he anoints me then he anoints me with
[1:18:05] the thoughts of God to say the things I
[1:18:07] should say and quits you know shuts my
[1:18:10] mouth and helps me not to say the wrong
[1:18:11] things because we attempted to say
[1:18:13] things to displease the Lord and we have
[1:18:15] to be very careful and many Christians
[1:18:17] even around this message don't realize
[1:18:19] that many things some things what
[1:18:20] they're saying is really dis dis
[1:18:22] disrespect respectful and displeasing
[1:18:24] the Lord because it's not his word amen
[1:18:26] when you speak things contr to the word
[1:18:27] of God you see what it is you see we can
[1:18:29] go deep into that but let's just pull
[1:18:31] away from it okay so he he testes you to
[1:18:35] see what you say about it your
[1:18:37] attitude yeah the way you take what you
[1:18:40] think about it he does that purposely he
[1:18:43] does it yet because that is his
[1:18:45] unchanging nature he did it at the old
[1:18:48] times now in testing you to see what you
[1:18:51] say about it What attitude you
[1:18:55] take what you
[1:18:57] do we'll go on here to see
[1:19:00] it and here's what he says
[1:19:05] here he says
[1:19:09] here uh in possessing the Gate of the
[1:19:11] enemy again after trial the purpose of
[1:19:14] Abraham the promise of Abraham was that
[1:19:16] his seed now his Royal seed also as I
[1:19:18] told you a while ago and this seed that
[1:19:21] he gave Abraham was a seal of promise
[1:19:24] and the Royal seed according to
[1:19:25] Ephesians 4:30 is sealed by the Holy
[1:19:28] Ghost after they have stood the
[1:19:33] test try to think of
[1:19:39] it but goes on he says many think to got
[1:19:43] the Holy Ghost many claim to have the
[1:19:44] Holy Ghost many can show many evidences
[1:19:46] and signs of it but still if it can't
[1:19:48] stay with this word it's not the Holy
[1:19:50] Ghost see you believe every word
[1:19:53] now here's what people Miss they say I
[1:19:57] got the Holy Ghost because I believe
[1:19:58] every word the real truth of it is you
[1:20:00] could believe every you have to believe
[1:20:01] every word before you get the Holy Ghost
[1:20:04] brother bam says you believe every word
[1:20:06] then you was sealed after the test then
[1:20:09] you sealed after the test now what is
[1:20:11] that
[1:20:12] test that you
[1:20:16] get before you get the Holy
[1:20:19] Ghost what is that test that we all go
[1:20:24] true it's different after the Holy Ghost
[1:20:28] I'll share it with you just in a little
[1:20:29] bit bit so you believe every word and
[1:20:32] you sealed after the test when we
[1:20:34] believe every promise in the word then
[1:20:36] we are sealed by the Holy Ghost to
[1:20:38] confirm the promise that's what it is
[1:20:40] see that's what Abraham the way he did
[1:20:42] it then and only then have we the right
[1:20:45] to possess the Gate of our enemy you
[1:20:46] cannot do it until first you become that
[1:20:49] seed there's another one I wanted to
[1:20:51] read for you quickly
[1:20:53] um just
[1:20:56] before
[1:21:00] uh
[1:21:02] yeah brother Bram goes on in the same
[1:21:05] message that I see your Poss to together
[1:21:07] of his enemy he says if you Abraham's
[1:21:09] seed you look at the promise of
[1:21:12] God what God Said to do about it that's
[1:21:14] said Abraham's seed we look at the
[1:21:16] promise I don't care how many Falls this
[1:21:18] way and how many Falls that way the
[1:21:21] promise remains true because see as
[1:21:22] human beings we have a tendency to wash
[1:21:24] the the track record of others he did
[1:21:27] this and she did that and she failed
[1:21:29] here and she did if he could just keep
[1:21:31] our eyes off that kind of stuff see
[1:21:34] because that's why when brother BR had
[1:21:36] div vision of the with the bride you
[1:21:39] know remember that Vision he had and he
[1:21:41] said some of them get out the line you
[1:21:42] know why they got out the line the
[1:21:43] prophet of God says they were looking at
[1:21:45] the church the Box Living Church that
[1:21:47] went before them that church that get
[1:21:49] out of line they were looking at that
[1:21:50] quit looking at people who make our
[1:21:52] kinds of failures get your eyes off of
[1:21:54] them yes sir yes sir yes keep your eyes
[1:21:56] on Jesus that's right amen because
[1:21:58] you're going to get in trouble when you
[1:21:59] do that yes you're going to lose you're
[1:22:01] going to you're going to you're going to
[1:22:02] you're going to deviate you'll get in
[1:22:03] trouble keep your eyes on him forget
[1:22:06] these people they want to deviate not
[1:22:07] forget them pray for them but keep your
[1:22:09] eyes on Jesus love them pray for them
[1:22:12] don't wish them anything but keep your
[1:22:14] eyes on the word keep keep your eyes off
[1:22:17] of the failures of man
[1:22:19] amen and if you see a failure Let It Be
[1:22:22] a stepping stone to you that you could
[1:22:24] say well he made a failure and I'm not
[1:22:25] going to do that amen that's the
[1:22:27] attitude we always want to take the
[1:22:29] attitude of scriptural now let me hurry
[1:22:31] here because we can spend a lot of time
[1:22:32] and stuff like that now brother brandom
[1:22:35] goes off here you've got to come
[1:22:38] through you've got to come through those
[1:22:41] testing CS Abraham first tested and then
[1:22:44] seal then given the promise that his SI
[1:22:46] of forest the Gate of the enemy I like
[1:22:48] that um then we want to see the SE say
[1:22:52] that test testing of course is for
[1:22:53] certain purposes that you get the test
[1:22:56] and one of the testing is to see whether
[1:22:58] you will continue to go on or
[1:23:01] not because I tell you honest truth
[1:23:03] sometimes when you go through a test it
[1:23:05] looks very very discouraging yes and
[1:23:08] that's where the devil tempts you to
[1:23:09] turn back to give
[1:23:11] up Satan says you can't make it you
[1:23:15] can't you can't you can't and that's
[1:23:17] where you're attempted so the testing is
[1:23:18] to see whether he will go on but then
[1:23:22] let's go a little deep into that testing
[1:23:24] tonight and the the quote I have for you
[1:23:26] here where bam explains a testing before
[1:23:29] the baptism of the holy spirit before
[1:23:31] you receive life is in the message here
[1:23:33] called everpresent water from the Rock
[1:23:35] and brother bam says it here now here is
[1:23:38] something that's very important for us
[1:23:39] to understand and I'll read it for you
[1:23:42] when a fellow receives Christ as his
[1:23:45] savior everything is under housed up see
[1:23:48] they come into church and they get
[1:23:50] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:52] Christ Christ and everybody is a bunch
[1:23:53] of angels yeah and the pastor is the
[1:23:56] best person he ever met ever met he is
[1:23:58] such a lovely brother and oh and they're
[1:24:01] in love with all of us yes yes and boy
[1:24:05] everything seems nice yes it does and
[1:24:08] then all of a
[1:24:11] sudden says
[1:24:14] here everything is under the house step
[1:24:17] but before this man can come into the
[1:24:19] baptism of the holy spirit this person
[1:24:21] he must first have a
[1:24:23] sanctifying
[1:24:26] process he must he must have a testing
[1:24:30] time in his
[1:24:34] life brother then you thought those
[1:24:36] lovely leaves of Fellowship because
[1:24:38] leaves represent
[1:24:41] Fellowship love Le
[1:24:46] Fellowship I'm in fellowship with
[1:24:48] brother
[1:24:51] George woo what a sweet Fellowship we've
[1:24:54] been having and then all of a sudden it
[1:24:58] looked like those lovely leaves the
[1:25:00] fellowship turned into a little cactus
[1:25:04] needle with a little SP on he said this
[1:25:07] about me I never thought brother George
[1:25:09] would act like that I never thought the
[1:25:12] I never thought that church that's the
[1:25:15] testing
[1:25:17] time
[1:25:20] see now this called is a a condition
[1:25:23] that we will look into if we have enough
[1:25:26] time when these things happen the
[1:25:28] Temptation is for bitterness to come
[1:25:33] in but here is something
[1:25:38] strange I'm going to say something to
[1:25:40] you tonight that seems very
[1:25:41] contradictory to the word of God and I
[1:25:44] hope I have enough quotes to back it up
[1:25:47] now now I know I'm not going to ask you
[1:25:50] to raise your hand if you got better if
[1:25:52] you better all right I'm going to ask
[1:25:55] you to do that I know better than that
[1:25:58] because I'm not going I'm not going to
[1:26:00] be the only one watching that hand
[1:26:01] raised others others in the church will
[1:26:04] be watching your hand raised to if you
[1:26:06] admit you have bitterness but here is
[1:26:08] something strange I want to tell
[1:26:10] you and this seems very very
[1:26:13] contradictory and if you don't say amen
[1:26:16] I don't blame you because if anybody
[1:26:19] tell me this they better back it up with
[1:26:21] quotes you can have bitterness in you
[1:26:25] and it does not stop the Holy Spirit
[1:26:26] from coming in your
[1:26:29] life now don't don't no don't don't
[1:26:32] please don't don't don't say
[1:26:37] Amen don't put your hand up to agree
[1:26:40] because I'm going to back that up with
[1:26:42] the
[1:26:45] word
[1:26:49] okay
[1:26:51] huh now now you've heard preachers tell
[1:26:54] you you got to get rid of all bitterness
[1:26:57] before you get the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:59] Ghost that is good and that I could say
[1:27:02] Amen to
[1:27:10] also look before I get in before I share
[1:27:14] those quiz with you let me finish this
[1:27:15] one first it's all right so I'm going to
[1:27:18] hold you in suspense over here for a
[1:27:19] little bit of
[1:27:21] bit
[1:27:23] okay now I'm going look tonight I'm
[1:27:26] going I'm going to back up this with
[1:27:30] quotes I'm going to show you what the
[1:27:32] prophet of God said about
[1:27:34] it okay sir now let's continue this W
[1:27:38] here with the pro with the testing
[1:27:40] before you get the Holy
[1:27:43] Ghost okay because the Bible said prove
[1:27:46] all things so even when I tell you that
[1:27:48] prove it say brother Ferguson prove it
[1:27:51] we want the proof
[1:27:53] we don't want to just accept it because
[1:27:54] you say it we want the proof and you
[1:27:57] have right because the word of God tells
[1:27:58] you to prove all things
[1:28:03] am yes
[1:28:06] amen is that
[1:28:08] correct some people want you to believe
[1:28:10] it because I say it
[1:28:13] no unless the one saying it there unless
[1:28:16] is God if God speaking to you amen and
[1:28:19] if God even if God speak to you I have
[1:28:22] to prove
[1:28:23] it I have a right to prove God I prove
[1:28:29] God and you have a right to do
[1:28:32] it because the Bible didn't say prove
[1:28:34] some
[1:28:35] things prove all
[1:28:37] things
[1:28:40] yes I
[1:28:43] okay I'm try to hurry okay I got told
[1:28:46] you before I have to cut this meeting
[1:28:47] because if I don't I'm going be in
[1:28:49] trouble then you're going to say every
[1:28:50] time brother person come here keeps us
[1:28:52] long so I'm going to have to cut it have
[1:28:55] to just cut it all right let's go on
[1:28:58] even if I have to leave you on hanging
[1:28:59] over here on a branch some
[1:29:03] somewhere all right are you ready
[1:29:06] now all right now brother bom continues
[1:29:10] when a fellow receives Christ as the
[1:29:11] Savior everything is in the house stuff
[1:29:14] oh
[1:29:15] brother oh I couldn't be more blessed I
[1:29:17] came it to that little church and oh boy
[1:29:19] I was blessed I was blessed I was was
[1:29:22] blessed oh brother I was
[1:29:29] blessed but before this man can come
[1:29:32] into the baptism of the holy spirit this
[1:29:34] person he must have a sanctifying
[1:29:35] process he must have a testing time in
[1:29:38] his
[1:29:39] life all of you had
[1:29:42] it
[1:29:44] amen that's right so you get the test in
[1:29:47] time you think well nobody knows what
[1:29:50] I'm going through M no one knows the
[1:29:54] Deacon doesn't know the pastor doesn't
[1:29:56] know no one knows you know what the
[1:29:58] devil tell you little darling keep it to
[1:30:00] yourself nobody knows what you're going
[1:30:02] through that's a
[1:30:05] lie that's right don't let the devil lie
[1:30:09] to you brother Bram says here all of you
[1:30:13] had it had this destined time every son
[1:30:17] that cometh to God is first courage
[1:30:19] chasten chasti and if we cannot stand
[1:30:22] chastisement then it shows we are not
[1:30:24] children of God we are bastards and not
[1:30:26] children of God the Bible says it but if
[1:30:29] we could stand a chastisement knowing
[1:30:31] that all things work together for good
[1:30:33] to them that love God then we are Sons
[1:30:35] and Daughters of God then he seals us
[1:30:37] with the Holy Spirit until the day of
[1:30:41] redemption and see that's the
[1:30:43] chastisement The Strain the thing we go
[1:30:46] through so it's a testing before the
[1:30:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:52] amen are you going to believe all the
[1:30:56] word are you going to be true to
[1:30:59] him are you going to continue on what's
[1:31:02] your
[1:31:03] attitude when the testing come what do
[1:31:06] you
[1:31:08] say what do you do what is your
[1:31:13] attitude and then you look to the word
[1:31:15] to see Lord what is your word you're
[1:31:17] struggling to do it you're struggling
[1:31:20] but yet you're looking to the word the
[1:31:21] word of God says this the word of God
[1:31:23] says that Lord I want to do it I want to
[1:31:25] please you I want to do what you want me
[1:31:27] to do then he seals you now when he
[1:31:31] seals you with the Holy Ghost let's deal
[1:31:34] with that point I spoke about there with
[1:31:36] the bitterness because this looks like
[1:31:37] it kind of caught your attention a
[1:31:39] little bit which is good
[1:31:41] [Laughter]
[1:31:43] amen all right I'm going to share it
[1:31:46] with
[1:31:46] you are you
[1:31:49] ready they going to proect it on the
[1:31:51] board too you're going to read the quote
[1:31:52] for yourself that's
[1:32:01] good okay I'm going to read for you a
[1:32:03] couple of
[1:32:04] quotes because there are things in your
[1:32:06] lives that only the Holy Ghost can deal
[1:32:09] with right it's not done in the
[1:32:11] sanctifying process it's done when the
[1:32:14] Holy Ghost comes
[1:32:16] in the sanctifying process is a testing
[1:32:19] and we give up from the things of the
[1:32:21] world but there were things we will
[1:32:22] always have a struggle in our lives
[1:32:24] until the Holy Spirit comes in because
[1:32:26] only his entrance could help us with
[1:32:28] those things are you following me are
[1:32:32] you beginning to understand a little bit
[1:32:34] more now you see that's why some people
[1:32:37] try to get good before they get the
[1:32:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost don't do that
[1:32:41] yes it's the sanctifying process where
[1:32:44] you sanctify from the things of the
[1:32:45] world and give it all to Jesus and then
[1:32:48] the Holy Ghost comes in when the Holy
[1:32:49] Ghost comes in then he there's a lot of
[1:32:51] stuff that he takes out of you okay so
[1:32:55] don't try to get out of it before the
[1:32:57] Holy Ghost comes you put in the cart
[1:32:58] before the horse now B
[1:33:01] continues Jesus Christ the same
[1:33:03] yesterday today and forever he says now
[1:33:05] same thing what I'm telling you you have
[1:33:06] to heal yourself and I have to heal
[1:33:08] myself and together the Messiah Works
[1:33:10] among us because we are his people
[1:33:12] chosen Sanctified by his blood the Holy
[1:33:14] Spirit dwells in us just like that
[1:33:17] little button being the Holy Spirit when
[1:33:19] it comes in baptismal form
[1:33:22] then it just begins to spread out when
[1:33:25] we get all the roots of bitterness and
[1:33:27] evil away from us God just takes over
[1:33:29] and begins to
[1:33:31] [Music]
[1:33:34] move
[1:33:36] okay he goes
[1:33:38] on the message why he says a man was
[1:33:42] made to be a God to be a god do you know
[1:33:44] that he's in the image of God he's a Son
[1:33:46] of God he's like him he was given a
[1:33:48] domain Genesis 1: 126 domain over the
[1:33:50] whole earth that's right right he Ruled
[1:33:52] the Earth he ruled the animal kingdom
[1:33:54] and all the other kingdoms all but the
[1:33:56] kingdom of God above he was God he was
[1:33:59] an amateur God he was made in the image
[1:34:00] of God made like God had hands and feet

[1:35:37] off and he's got a you and I you can
[1:35:40] look at you Bo I got hand like God
[1:35:42] praise
[1:35:44] God Amen oh we feel good about that
[1:35:47] don't we oh my this message tells us
[1:35:50] stuff that we don't even we never even
[1:35:51] knew
[1:35:52] before all right let's go on a little
[1:35:55] bit I'm you thr out a lot of stuff
[1:35:57] tonight I'm going try to keep on
[1:35:59] this
[1:36:04] uh where was that yeah yeah yeah here
[1:36:08] what happened because he goes on here he
[1:36:10] was in the image of God what happened
[1:36:12] because he disbelieved God's word it
[1:36:14] sent him right back to shift for himself
[1:36:17] now God's trying to bring him back and
[1:36:19] when you have faith and accept him my
[1:36:21] brother just let that little light begin
[1:36:24] to grow out see the little light begin
[1:36:27] to grow out taking all the roots of of
[1:36:30] of doubt and bitterness healing itself
[1:36:32] to the Holy Spirit then you begin to
[1:36:34] become a Son of God a daughter of God
[1:36:37] begin to grow in the grace of God the
[1:36:38] Holy Spirit begins to build his kingdom
[1:36:42] within you so he comes in brother
[1:36:44] brandom says you've got that fi that
[1:36:47] little light comes in and it begins to
[1:36:49] gr out it takes all the roots of
[1:36:51] bitterness and doubts and everything as
[1:36:53] you yeld yourself to the spirit there's
[1:36:56] another couple ones I have and I share
[1:36:59] have probably brought them with me and I
[1:37:01] didn't bring all on that Holy Spirit as
[1:37:03] a little button coming within you and
[1:37:05] taking all the roots of bitterness and
[1:37:07] everything out of you because what
[1:37:08] happened is in the transformation of
[1:37:10] your life there were things that the
[1:37:12] sanctification process in the testing
[1:37:14] time will not do it takes the Holy
[1:37:17] Spirit stepping within you and when he
[1:37:19] comes within you then there's a
[1:37:21] transformation that particular part
[1:37:23] things that he takes out in the Holy
[1:37:25] Ghost um of course brother bam talked a
[1:37:27] lot about it in the future home if you
[1:37:29] want to read the future home he talk
[1:37:31] about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:37:32] Fire and he said when that fire comes in
[1:37:35] it burns all the unbelief and everything
[1:37:36] can sh to God out of you but you see it
[1:37:39] is part of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:40] because the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:42] has a lot in it when you talk about it
[1:37:44] it's not just one particular thing does
[1:37:46] everybody get it now am okay I'm sorry I
[1:37:48] should have had more quotes on this and
[1:37:50] I'm sorry sorry most some of the other
[1:37:52] quotes I don't have with me tonight I
[1:37:54] thought I had most of it and I said
[1:37:56] surely I have it when I checked but
[1:37:58] maybe I could get back on another time
[1:38:00] and bring out more of that to you maybe
[1:38:02] another time if the Lord ever Le me back
[1:38:04] here to be with you all okay now there's
[1:38:07] another one I have yeah thank the
[1:38:10] Lord oh
[1:38:13] my I knew there was another one and I
[1:38:15] couldn't find it here it is the
[1:38:17] uncertain song and yet the man somewhere
[1:38:20] down in him said somewhere in him if he
[1:38:22] could only let that as I Illustrated
[1:38:24] like a button when a man is saved that
[1:38:27] much of him is God that's the little
[1:38:30] light that comes in to make him quit to
[1:38:33] make him quit doing what is wrong now if
[1:38:36] you could take all the malice and envy
[1:38:37] and strife and unbelief out that little
[1:38:39] button like of the light and power of
[1:38:41] God will keep growing growing growing
[1:38:43] growing crowding out unbelief and you
[1:38:45] don't do it by exaltations of bodily
[1:38:47] exercise you do it by a Sanctified
[1:38:49] consecrated life that the Holy Ghost
[1:38:50] Moves In and through you so the Holy
[1:38:52] Ghost comes in and all these things he
[1:38:54] moves it out of you am it's like a
[1:38:56] that's why you know when I when I was a
[1:38:58] little boy one of the things I love to
[1:39:00] do was stand when a bulldozer was
[1:39:02] working and see how that bulldozer move
[1:39:03] all the rocks and stuff out and I always
[1:39:06] wondered why I was attracted to look at
[1:39:08] a bulldozer when it was working and then
[1:39:10] one day I was looking at the message and
[1:39:12] brother brandham said the Holy Ghost is
[1:39:14] a bulldozer when he comes in he just
[1:39:16] push all that stuff out all the little
[1:39:19] rocks and stubbles and stuff just
[1:39:21] bulldozes it and throws it to the side
[1:39:23] and boy what a blessing and I said now I
[1:39:25] understand why I like to look at the
[1:39:27] bulldozer I used to step and look at
[1:39:29] that when I was a little B kid I love to
[1:39:31] see the bulldozers and truly speaking I
[1:39:34] love to see the Holy Ghost moveing into
[1:39:36] a church as a bulldozer and bulldo
[1:39:39] everything can share it to God out of
[1:39:44] it all
[1:39:47] right let us continue just had this one
[1:39:51] but I'll try to continue on now is that
[1:39:52] all right now um I should have had more
[1:39:56] quotes on that on the little button as
[1:39:57] the Holy Ghost comes in but I think you
[1:39:59] all catch it the things that in the
[1:40:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost that he does
[1:40:02] for us which of course we are
[1:40:05] so grateful
[1:40:09] for is my enemy tonight all right now
[1:40:13] let's see now so we went under the
[1:40:15] testings before we Reed the Holy Spirit
[1:40:17] the sanctifying testing time and brother
[1:40:19] said it is in that time where a lot of
[1:40:21] people fall
[1:40:23] away when they hit that testing time the
[1:40:27] testing time is something that they have
[1:40:28] to understand that God brings upon them
[1:40:31] God lets them go through it and that's
[1:40:34] you have brother said it's where a lot
[1:40:35] of people fall off a lot of people quit
[1:40:38] and they go
[1:40:39] back during that sanctifying testing
[1:40:42] time see now um we could talk a lot
[1:40:46] about it but we try our best not
[1:40:48] to now now he's going to give you you a
[1:40:51] test now this is a test that God gives
[1:40:54] you there's a test that God gives you
[1:40:56] and there's a test that you apply
[1:40:58] yourself so you prove all things you
[1:41:02] prove all things and God proves all
[1:41:05] things you all understand God proves All
[1:41:08] Things by giving you the test but you do
[1:41:11] not prove All Things by giving a test
[1:41:14] the prophet of God want us he said do
[1:41:16] not test your fate don't do
[1:41:19] it God will do it for you the devil will
[1:41:23] do it for you you don't need to test
[1:41:24] your faith and how do you test your
[1:41:28] Fai how do you test your faith that
[1:41:31] Faith you got more he goes through all
[1:41:33] kind of trial God tests it he will try
[1:41:36] your faith Satan testes it Satan will
[1:41:39] try your faith and then you test your
[1:41:41] own faith why don't do
[1:41:46] it but you quiet on me
[1:41:48] tonight you know you test your Fai
[1:41:51] brother mam says when you ask yourself a
[1:41:52] question do I have enough Faith he said
[1:41:55] you're tested your faith don't do it
[1:41:58] always believe you have enough Faith
[1:42:01] yes amen take the positive amen God has
[1:42:05] given me Faith I have enough Faith but
[1:42:07] do I have enough
[1:42:08] faith I'm praying and asking God but I'm
[1:42:11] not sure I have enough Faith you're
[1:42:12] testing your
[1:42:14] faith the prophet said don't do it amen
[1:42:18] don't do it t in your faith
[1:42:22] now let's go on because we we deviating
[1:42:25] so much on all these little points that
[1:42:26] we could spend all night
[1:42:28] on but let's get back here to where we
[1:42:31] should be all
[1:42:33] right now let's look at the
[1:42:36] testing after you receive the Holy
[1:42:40] Ghost okay now we will take a scripture
[1:42:44] on
[1:42:45] it and the scripture we take is our lord
[1:42:48] Jesus and brother brandham talked a
[1:42:50] little bit about about it let me share
[1:42:52] that with
[1:42:54] you okay are you ready now if you think
[1:42:57] you were tested before you get the Holy
[1:42:59] Ghost brother when you get it you're
[1:43:00] going to go through the
[1:43:02] [Laughter]
[1:43:17] testing so Abraham first tested and then
[1:43:19] sealed then give the promise all right
[1:43:22] now let's see what he says
[1:43:30] here all right brother bam is dealing
[1:43:33] with both of them here and he says
[1:43:37] here
[1:43:39] uh the word of God always attracts that
[1:43:42] spiritual mind because it is the mind of
[1:43:44] Christ in you that knows that that word
[1:43:46] is true so your the mind in you
[1:43:49] attracted to the word and you go through
[1:43:51] a test in time the church goes through a
[1:43:53] test in time each individual goes
[1:43:55] through a test in time before it can
[1:43:56] ever possess the Gate of the
[1:43:59] enemy okay and then you go to what
[1:44:02] brother bam calls your final testing
[1:44:04] shouldn't go into that shouldn't even
[1:44:06] mention it tonight all right each
[1:44:08] individual goes through a testing time
[1:44:10] before he can ever possess the Gate of
[1:44:11] the enemy Abraham went through it Christ
[1:44:13] went through it after Christ was filled
[1:44:17] with the Holy Spirit there at the river
[1:44:20] of Jordan he went through a test in
[1:44:23] time after Abraham was called out put
[1:44:27] into his land where he was to be a to be
[1:44:30] a pilgrim then give
[1:44:32] circumcision and God met him time after
[1:44:35] time yet he had to go through the time
[1:44:37] of
[1:44:38] testing every Seed of Abraham does the
[1:44:41] same thing Abraham and his seed so
[1:44:44] Christ went through the testing after he
[1:44:48] received the Holy Ghost now let me go a
[1:44:49] little further for you with you on that
[1:44:51] one okay are you ready amen what a poy
[1:44:54] amen are you ready amen so you go
[1:44:57] through the testing before and then you
[1:45:00] go through the testing after because
[1:45:02] when the Holy Ghost comes he's begin to
[1:45:04] do a work in you you think the Holy
[1:45:05] Ghost is going to come into you because
[1:45:06] you're perfect forget it the Holy Ghost
[1:45:08] comes within you to make you perfect
[1:45:10] Amen to fulfill the work of God in you
[1:45:12] when the Holy Ghost comes there's a lot
[1:45:14] of stuff he does in you amen but
[1:45:19] now
[1:45:21] brother bandom goes on here let me see
[1:45:23] no this is not it here where is it oh
[1:45:26] Lord help me
[1:45:31] yes here we got
[1:45:33] it I'm going to take my time and read
[1:45:36] this for you yes is it all right amen
[1:45:38] amen all right let see your possess the
[1:45:41] of his enemy and when we receive Christ
[1:45:42] as our savior then if we are sincere in
[1:45:45] that then God gives us a sign that he
[1:45:46] has received our faith in Christ by
[1:45:49] giving us the Seal of circum cision
[1:45:51] which is the Holy Ghost that's the seed
[1:45:53] of circumcision grieve not the spirit of
[1:45:55] God whereby you are sealed to the day of
[1:45:57] your Redemption not to the next meeting
[1:45:59] but the day of your Redemption that's
[1:46:01] right Ephesians 4:30 now that's how we
[1:46:03] receive the Holy Ghost now if you say oh
[1:46:05] I'm a Believer and God has never give
[1:46:07] you the Holy Ghost
[1:46:10] yet he's never recognized it it's just
[1:46:14] confessing that you believe but when all
[1:46:16] the doubt I'm not saying you're not a
[1:46:18] Believer now in a certain portion you
[1:46:20] are a Believer but when God has found
[1:46:23] when God has found favor or you have
[1:46:25] found favor with God rather and he
[1:46:27] recognizes you to be his child and he
[1:46:30] knows your heart and sees your sincerity
[1:46:33] he knows all things that cut away from
[1:46:35] you then he sees you into the kingdom of
[1:46:37] God by the Holy Ghost proven to the
[1:46:39] world that he has accepted what faith
[1:46:41] you profess to have in him you get it
[1:46:44] now did you get it if you get it let me
[1:46:46] see your hands amen amen well I didn't
[1:46:49] see much hands
[1:46:51] let me see your hand oh that looks good
[1:46:54] everybody put up their hand all right
[1:46:56] I'll go back and read a little bit for
[1:46:58] you then he seals you into the kingdom
[1:47:00] of God by the Holy Ghost proven to the
[1:47:02] world that he has accepted what faith
[1:47:03] you possess to have in him get it now
[1:47:06] now
[1:47:07] immediately after that comes the
[1:47:10] Temptation every son you see he uses the
[1:47:12] same scripture every son that cometh to
[1:47:13] God must first be tried tested so he
[1:47:15] used that same that same scripture for
[1:47:17] the testing before the Holy Ghost and
[1:47:19] the testing after he goes on Jesus as
[1:47:22] soon as he received the fullness of the
[1:47:23] spirit on the river when John baptized
[1:47:25] him immediately the devil took him into
[1:47:27] the Wilderness to go through a time of
[1:47:29] of temptation but when he took the word
[1:47:31] of God and overcome the devil it is WR
[1:47:33] it is written it is written he came back
[1:47:37] out and then ready for the
[1:47:41] ministry all right but continues now
[1:47:44] there's a lot of times where where many
[1:47:46] of us Pentecostals has made a mistake
[1:47:48] and we think well the Holy Ghost is SP
[1:47:50] on on me glory to God that's all I have
[1:47:52] to do no so you just then getting
[1:47:54] getting started you it's not then it's
[1:47:57] your test and your
[1:47:59] trial now brother Bram goes
[1:48:03] on
[1:48:04] ah so after that comes the Temptation
[1:48:08] after God puts you through the
[1:48:12] test now he will try you to see what do
[1:48:15] you really what life you have in you he
[1:48:18] puts you through a test amen amen okay
[1:48:21] now could you give me a few
[1:48:24] minutes just a few minutes here
[1:48:27] tonight if I could deviate a little bit
[1:48:30] from God testing you which he testes you
[1:48:32] to see if you really believe it's a word
[1:48:34] a word
[1:48:35] test sometimes people don't realize it
[1:48:39] the devil send one of his
[1:48:40] Messengers comes up to you he says you
[1:48:46] know you know I was reading I was
[1:48:49] listening to it tape the other night and
[1:48:51] I have a hard time believing everything
[1:48:54] I heard
[1:48:55] there he says do you really think that
[1:48:59] some of this stuff that brother bam is
[1:49:02] talking about that you really think it's
[1:49:04] the
[1:49:06] truth and you
[1:49:08] stop and you just confess you have the
[1:49:11] Holy Ghost what is the evidence of the
[1:49:13] Holy Ghost we get to that in a little
[1:49:15] bit you say well you could be right you
[1:49:19] know what happened to
[1:49:21] you something is
[1:49:24] wrong and then you leave that person and
[1:49:27] that Old Devil you know I tell you this
[1:49:29] people don't realize it but Devils leave
[1:49:30] people and come on Devils I remember I
[1:49:32] went up to the big or to in Joseph once
[1:49:35] where they got that massive pipe organ
[1:49:36] one of the biggest in the world to take
[1:49:39] some people up there to see this thing
[1:49:41] and when I was leaving a devil was
[1:49:43] following me singing that song a Maria
[1:49:47] in whom you know Mary to the sound to
[1:49:49] Mary in whom salvation is sure this
[1:49:51] thing singing in my head brother Israel
[1:49:54] I could hear the thing singing in my
[1:49:55] head as I leave this place people don't
[1:49:57] realize
[1:49:58] Devils let me give you a little example
[1:50:01] again people don't realize it I remember
[1:50:04] I was working when before I went
[1:50:07] full-time in the ministry I used to
[1:50:09] pastor and work and I was working on
[1:50:12] making pants and suits in a a factory in
[1:50:16] in
[1:50:18] Montreal Shan was just a little bitty
[1:50:20] girl at the time she was little bit
[1:50:22] little baby at the time she was pretty
[1:50:24] young and so I went I went there and H
[1:50:28] there was a washroom there and the
[1:50:29] washroom was for men and women but you
[1:50:31] have like one washroom the washrooms
[1:50:33] were like this so you would go in you
[1:50:34] know and come out several washrooms here
[1:50:36] so I went in one of these washrooms and
[1:50:38] when I went in my mind in my mind I'm
[1:50:40] thinking about comic books and M Batman
[1:50:43] and Superman and Spider-Man and all of
[1:50:45] this a strong thought of that in my mind
[1:50:48] so I came out of the washroom and I said
[1:50:50] what is this my mind just almost as if
[1:50:53] my mind being tormented with Superman
[1:50:55] and Batman and and all these thing I
[1:50:57] mean I don't want to think about
[1:50:59] Superman and Batman I want to think
[1:51:01] about the Lord Jesus so there was a
[1:51:03] little guy there I came up to him I says
[1:51:06] you went into that washroom before me he
[1:51:08] said yes I says you you into comic books
[1:51:13] he said yes I said Spider-Man and Batman
[1:51:17] and Superman and and these things he
[1:51:19] said yes he said I'm a
[1:51:20] he says why are you asking me that and I
[1:51:22] couldn't tell him because that spirit
[1:51:25] that was on him for those things met me
[1:51:28] while I was in the washroom and was
[1:51:29] trying to anoint my
[1:51:31] mind well that's good and you and I have
[1:51:35] to be aware of the influences of spirits
[1:51:38] upon us that's why with the Holy Ghost
[1:51:41] in US it it sees us from that kind of an
[1:51:44] influence that we don't fall victim to

[1:54:05] says and proba you heard this quote
[1:54:07] already I don't know maybe some of you
[1:54:08] might be aware of it but this is nice
[1:54:09] for us to read again was only a few
[1:54:12] years later when the Trials
[1:54:14] come and the church got All Shook Up as
[1:54:18] it's so easy for a Congregation of
[1:54:20] people to do when something just don't
[1:54:23] seem to happen the way that it is
[1:54:24] supposed to
[1:54:26] be and then you hear what the people say
[1:54:29] the devil the devil the devil the devil
[1:54:31] is in the church the devil the devil the
[1:54:35] devil sometimes Satan gets blamed for
[1:54:36] stuff that God
[1:54:39] [Laughter]
[1:54:41] does and sometime God gets blame for
[1:54:44] stuff that Satan does people mix this
[1:54:46] all up all the time let's go on here
[1:54:50] it's so easy for congregational people
[1:54:52] to do when something just don't happen
[1:54:53] the way that is supposed to be God makes
[1:54:56] it that way God brings tensions into the
[1:55:01] church oh we want a little
[1:55:05] church where the pastor is just in love
[1:55:08] with everybody and everything is going
[1:55:12] smooth there's no
[1:55:14] heartaches and if tension come in the
[1:55:16] church is because the pastor and the
[1:55:18] deacons and somebody's doing
[1:55:20] wrong we want a church where everything
[1:55:22] is just so smooth the people don't
[1:55:24] realize that the most important thing
[1:55:26] that you want is a church that will
[1:55:28] guide you to eternal life and keep your
[1:55:30] eyes on this word
[1:55:36] amen not save you from trials and
[1:55:38] troubles okay anything trying to save
[1:55:41] you from trials and troubles is working

[1:55:51] pastor look to the brother pray for me

[1:55:56] in it he's working out something in your
[1:55:58] life he's working out something in my
[1:56:00] life I said Lord please take it away
[1:56:02] from me even Jesus as a human being
[1:56:04] Cried Out father if it be thy will he
[1:56:07] had to go through it amen job had to go
[1:56:10] through it what would you and
[1:56:12] I now goes
[1:56:15] on every son that cometh to God must be
[1:56:17] tried and proven and tested he let
[1:56:19] sickness strikes you he lets disease
[1:56:22] come upon you to test you and to prove
[1:56:23] you to show to the world that you're
[1:56:25] truly the Seed of Abraham he permits it
[1:56:27] by his own will he permits disasters he
[1:56:30] permits the friends to turn against you
[1:56:33] you said the devil caused me to lose my
[1:56:35] friend God let it happen for a
[1:56:38] purpose the devil can't do anything
[1:56:39] unless God let him do it amen all right
[1:56:42] he permits the friends to turn against
[1:56:44] you he permits all these things and turn
[1:56:46] the devil loose to tempt you and he'll
[1:56:48] do all but take care life he could throw
[1:56:50] you on a bed of Affliction he could turn
[1:56:52] your neighbors against you he could turn
[1:56:54] the church against
[1:56:56] you and what are you going to
[1:57:00] do what are you going to
[1:57:05] do you want me to give you my little
[1:57:08] testimony I'll give you my little
[1:57:10] testimony and if I have to cut after a
[1:57:12] little bit I'll have
[1:57:15] to I was not in the message at the
[1:57:18] time that was the word 18 years
[1:57:22] old but a call of God In My
[1:57:25] Life Church of the nazarine so the
[1:57:29] pastor was leaving one day and I was
[1:57:32] doing a lot of evangelism out on the
[1:57:34] streets and bringing people into the
[1:57:35] church and testifying to others and so
[1:57:37] the Elders of the church come to the
[1:57:39] pastor and say Pastor we've got a little
[1:57:40] brother they used to call me little
[1:57:42] brother Fergie they said we got a little
[1:57:44] brother Fergie here Among Us brother
[1:57:45] George would you would you let him take
[1:57:47] the service on Sunday morning so I said
[1:57:49] all right so the Pastor said all right
[1:57:50] you let me preach right up behind the
[1:57:54] Propet you know I told the church I said
[1:57:57] the Church of the nazarine has a
[1:57:58] powerful
[1:57:59] Outreach but what we need is an
[1:58:02] Outreach it says we need to reach out
[1:58:05] more for God and I I don't remember all
[1:58:08] what I preached but at the end of the
[1:58:10] meeting almost three quarter of the
[1:58:12] church came to the platform the people
[1:58:13] were weeping the people were praying the
[1:58:15] people were rejoicing so the pastor was
[1:58:18] supposed to take the service that night
[1:58:19] he came back and someone met him and
[1:58:21] gave him the report I came to church you
[1:58:23] know and I'm feeling good you know I
[1:58:26] just preached a wonderful message you
[1:58:27] know how you feel when you preach the
[1:58:29] wonderful message I'm so happy have my
[1:58:32] Bible in my
[1:58:34] hand and I came into the meeting I sat
[1:58:36] down you know looked around at all the
[1:58:38] people and boy I inan the clouds you
[1:58:40] know the pastor got up the the Propet
[1:58:43] looked at the congregation he said
[1:58:45] Elijah was in the
[1:58:47] cave he said the Whirlwind came he said
[1:58:50] the Lord was not in it the fire came the
[1:58:52] Lord was not in it the Earth came the
[1:58:55] Lord was not in he say in a small still
[1:58:56] small voice of course he didn't know the
[1:58:58] message to the still Small Voice was in
[1:59:00] Elijah he said a still Small Voice he
[1:59:02] said we don't need an emotional preacher
[1:59:04] to come here and tell us we need more of
[1:59:05] God he said why don't you walk out when
[1:59:07] he was preaching and when the Pastor
[1:59:10] said that the congregation the members
[1:59:12] of the congregation turn and look at me
[1:59:15] and I went from the cow and my two feet
[1:59:17] hit the Earth
[1:59:20] and when that happened to me the pastor
[1:59:25] blasted me blasted me blasted me really
[1:59:28] good and when he was finished he went he
[1:59:31] continued he said we don't need that
[1:59:33] kind of prer here at our church and as
[1:59:37] soon as he was finished preaching and
[1:59:39] the first song was sung I was the first
[1:59:41] one to hit the door and out of the door
[1:59:44] I was walking and that church was on a
[1:59:47] hill and there was steps coming down and
[1:59:49] I was going to come down the steps to go
[1:59:51] in the street and to me that was the
[1:59:52] last time I was going to put my foot in
[1:59:55] that
[1:59:56] church and as I was walking
[1:59:59] down the steps as quick as I could to
[2:00:03] get out of that
[2:00:04] church something tapped me on the
[2:00:06] shoulder like
[2:00:08] this and said to me is that a right
[2:00:13] attitude a boy spoke to me and I
[2:00:18] stopped and the steps halfway
[2:00:21] down and something tell me go back and
[2:00:25] apologize to the pastor for your
[2:00:29] attitude I walked back up the
[2:00:33] steps I went back into the
[2:00:36] church I came to the pastor I said
[2:00:40] pastor I was leaving the church tonight
[2:00:42] with a wrong
[2:00:44] attitude I says would you forgive me for
[2:00:47] it I didn't tell the pastor
[2:00:50] he was wrong when you know in your heart
[2:00:52] you're wrong don't point the finger at
[2:00:54] the other one I need to make it right
[2:00:57] the pastor look at me with he says you
[2:00:59] know I make mistakes
[2:01:02] too church that Saturday after I went to
[2:01:08] a little town and we had a house meeting
[2:01:12] and in that house meeting this they
[2:01:14] brought this woman in and she had what
[2:01:16] was called elephant foot it's the first
[2:01:18] time I saw in my life her left foot was
[2:01:21] swollen big all the way down and I
[2:01:24] prayed for that woman and the next day
[2:01:27] her feet came back normal like the other
[2:01:30] God honored my prayer now hadn't I done
[2:01:34] if I given into my own emotions and my
[2:01:37] own feelings God will not honor my
[2:01:39] prayer and when we give into our own
[2:01:42] feelings and our own emotions God will
[2:01:45] not honor our prayer we want to pleas
[2:01:49] him and even though I was not in the
[2:01:51] message back in the denominations God
[2:01:53] wanted to use me to accomplish his will
[2:01:56] and in order to use me he let me go
[2:01:58] through a hard trial yes it was hard it
[2:02:02] was humiliating but it worked out to the
[2:02:05] glory of God
[2:02:07] amen
[2:02:09] amen
[2:02:12] look so he does it to
[2:02:16] you and don't worry you go through the
[2:02:20] trial you lose
[2:02:22] friends this one say this that happened
[2:02:25] this happened you go through it this
[2:02:28] Doctrine comes up this person believe
[2:02:30] this that other one say this it's not in
[2:02:32] the word it's not in the message it's
[2:02:34] the idea some man you go through it
[2:02:37] because deep in your heart there's only
[2:02:39] one desire father I want your word I
[2:02:42] want your will I want to please you Lord
[2:02:45] and you go through it you pass those
[2:02:46] trials why because you were pred
[2:02:49] destinated to
[2:02:51] life
[2:02:52] now give me just a couple of
[2:02:56] minutes okay I'll move away from that
[2:02:58] God testing you we can go a lot into
[2:03:00] that more and the process by which he he
[2:03:03] he sanctifies you and that process when
[2:03:06] the Holy Ghost comes in to take all the
[2:03:07] bitterness as he comes in as a little
[2:03:09] bit of button and then all the
[2:03:10] bitterness moves out and brother B said
[2:03:12] he just keep spreading and spread and
[2:03:13] spreading within you as all those things
[2:03:15] come out of your
[2:03:17] life you you follow me now what is
[2:03:21] important for the Holy Ghost is a fully
[2:03:23] surrendered life not a perfect life you
[2:03:26] see there may be things in my life
[2:03:28] that's not right but I've surrendered it
[2:03:29] all to him and then he comes in and when
[2:03:31] he comes in he takes care of the rest
[2:03:33] okay I think everybody understands that
[2:03:35] tonight all right let me deal with this
[2:03:39] now now here's what God does to you
[2:03:43] brother Brandon makes a statement like
[2:03:44] this and I'm going into something hereon
[2:03:46] have enough time but God God help us
[2:03:54] okay um just one minute here I'm sorry
[2:03:58] I'm really sorry for this H but let's
[2:04:01] trust the
[2:04:03] Lord but B makes this statement when he
[2:04:05] preaches the message what is the Holy
[2:04:06] Ghost you probably already heard this
[2:04:08] quote but I'm going to read it for you
[2:04:09] again because tonight we're just going
[2:04:11] to read it as a quote we're going to see
[2:04:13] it in
[2:04:14] action now in the message what is the
[2:04:17] Holy Ghost brother bam says here
[2:04:20] upon this place we wish to approach this
[2:04:22] subject which I think is the outstanding
[2:04:24] subject of today of the what is the Holy
[2:04:26] Spirit what is it and now the reason I
[2:04:28] have taken these subjects in line like
[2:04:30] this you cannot come and receive he said
[2:04:33] it's the outstanding subject of course
[2:04:35] he said the same thing in desperation we
[2:04:37] know that there's nothing more important
[2:04:38] in the life of almighty God in us um he
[2:04:41] says you cannot come and receive the
[2:04:43] Holy Spirit unless you know what it is
[2:04:45] and you cannot receive it if you know
[2:04:46] what it is unless you believe it's given
[2:04:48] to you and it's for you and then you
[2:04:50] cannot know whether you've got
[2:04:53] it or not unless you know what results
[2:04:57] it brings so if you know what it is and
[2:04:59] who it is to and what action it brings
[2:05:02] when it comes then you know what you've
[2:05:04] got when you get it see that's just what
[2:05:05] settle it now so he he's telling us here
[2:05:10] you cannot come and receive it unless
[2:05:11] you know what it is of course we know
[2:05:13] what it is we know that what the holy
[2:05:14] spirit is and you know what results it
[2:05:17] brings
[2:05:19] and he says then you cannot know whether
[2:05:21] you got it or not unless you know what
[2:05:23] results it brings now here is something
[2:05:26] that I used to think and God changed me
[2:05:29] from thinking like that are you
[2:05:31] following amen I used to think that the
[2:05:35] evidence of the holy spirit is something
[2:05:37] you receive after you receive the Holy
[2:05:40] Ghost now I might sound I might be
[2:05:43] talking in a little bit of a funny way
[2:05:45] when I say this to you I used to think
[2:05:47] that way and then I final it's not so
[2:05:51] God gives you God lets you know the
[2:05:53] evidence of the Holy Ghost what results
[2:05:55] the Holy Ghost will bring before he
[2:05:57] gives you the Holy Ghost so that after
[2:06:00] you get the Holy Ghost you could come
[2:06:02] back and compare what you receive with
[2:06:04] what he has shown you what it will bring
[2:06:06] in you oh all right now I'll I got some
[2:06:10] quotes on it that I picked up in the
[2:06:13] message and
[2:06:16] um I will read it for for you because
[2:06:20] it's not what we think it
[2:06:21] is it's different yeah I'm going to read
[2:06:27] this for you it's taken from the message
[2:06:28] proven his
[2:06:31] word and brother brandham mentions this
[2:06:35] here that light of the Holy Ghost comes
[2:06:38] in spread and taking all the bit in the
[2:06:40] out you and stuff now proving his word
[2:06:42] here now brother BR I'm talking here
[2:06:44] about Josh Rees and the and the general
[2:06:45] went over and picked him out a man out
[2:06:47] of each tribe and they took off he took
[2:06:49] Caleb his side body because he know
[2:06:52] Caleb believed they went over into the
[2:06:54] promised land and come back with a bunch
[2:06:55] of grapes that taken two men to pack say
[2:06:58] he said now so that Israel listen to
[2:07:00] this take they went over into the
[2:07:02] promised land and come back with a bunch
[2:07:04] of grapes they taken two men to P say he
[2:07:07] said now so that Israel will have the
[2:07:09] evidence before they even get into the
[2:07:13] promise see they'll have the evidence
[2:07:17] that God said it's a good
[2:07:19] and it's filled with milk and honey it's
[2:07:21] a grand land it's a good land now all
[2:07:23] this old garlic leash leash and whatever
[2:07:26] you got here in Egypt now we are taking
[2:07:28] you to a land with milk and honey you
[2:07:31] probably never tasted either one milk or
[2:07:33] honey down there in Egypt all these
[2:07:35] years they just give you rationing butam
[2:07:38] goes on here he talks up there and then
[2:07:40] he continues he said so they got up
[2:07:43] there and now always when you come back
[2:07:45] to bring an Evidence there the enemy
[2:07:47] lays in the road
[2:07:50] so when
[2:07:51] you begin to come back with the evidence
[2:07:54] that God has given you eternal life that
[2:07:57] God has sealed you the enemy is in the
[2:07:59] road he met Jesus what did he tell
[2:08:02] Jesus if th be the Son of God turn these
[2:08:06] bread into wine if you have the Holy
[2:08:09] Ghost if you have eternal life
[2:08:14] if the enemy lies in the road that's
[2:08:17] what brother bam is telling us here now
[2:08:19] let me continue to
[2:08:20] read he said it says and now always when
[2:08:25] you come back to bring an evidence that
[2:08:27] the enemy lays in the road when some of
[2:08:29] them Fells looked over and seen those
[2:08:31] great Giants of OFA Canaan oh they said
[2:08:34] we can't do it but they they they but
[2:08:37] they brought back the evidence that the
[2:08:39] land was there they had not been falsely
[2:08:41] LED God was proving to them his word
[2:08:45] even before they entered the land so God
[2:08:49] prove his word give them the evidence
[2:08:52] even before they entered Jesus did the
[2:08:55] same he says when the Holy Ghost has
[2:08:56] come upon you this will happen and that
[2:08:59] will happen you shall receive power
[2:09:01] after the Holy Ghost come he showed the
[2:09:04] church what the Holy Ghost will bring
[2:09:08] what the evidence what will happen when
[2:09:10] it comes amen
[2:09:14] now in order that you could see it so
[2:09:16] when you get it you will know you have
[2:09:18] the evidence ahead you have the evidence
[2:09:20] the problem with this message to many
[2:09:22] Believers is the people are not taking
[2:09:25] time to go into the word to find out for
[2:09:28] themselves to see what the word says
[2:09:32] about these things which is so important
[2:09:35] to be honest with you I can't blame you
[2:09:37] because even me myself I didn't know all
[2:09:39] of this before I didn't even know that
[2:09:42] God gives you the evidence before he
[2:09:44] gives the Holy Ghost because sometimes
[2:09:45] God does a thing and then he show you
[2:09:47] what he did after but many times he show
[2:09:49] you even before what he's going to do
[2:09:52] and that makes God prophetic because he
[2:09:55] shows you before you said when he showed
[2:09:57] brother Bram yes thank God for brother
[2:09:59] Bram but I need for him to show me and
[2:10:01] you need for him to show you
[2:10:04] [Music]
[2:10:07] too
[2:10:09] now
[2:10:11] now you get it that's man says you can't
[2:10:14] unless you know the result who you going
[2:10:15] to know what you get listen listen let
[2:10:17] me just break it for you simply I'm just
[2:10:19] trying to hurry oh Lord help me I'm in
[2:10:21] trouble now I thought I was finished for
[2:10:23] the latest 9:00 list see you go to the
[2:10:25] store and you want to you want to buy
[2:10:27] some apples and you have no idea what
[2:10:29] apples is they could sell you bananas
[2:10:31] onions anything for
[2:10:33] apples because you don't know what
[2:10:35] apples is you go to to the store you
[2:10:37] have an idea what you're going to get
[2:10:38] before you buy it right you better have
[2:10:41] an
[2:10:45] idea see have you ever seen a a a a
[2:10:48] woman go to the store to shop and she

[2:11:02] to the Holy Ghost and you see what we're
[2:11:03] trying to
[2:11:05] say people is confused they don't know
[2:11:08] what it
[2:11:13] is you see like my wife she take a
[2:11:15] little note you know she she take notes
[2:11:17] of what she want to buy she's to buy
[2:11:18] this she's going to buy that you know so
[2:11:20] much of this so much of that she has a
[2:11:21] little note with her many women does
[2:11:23] that we coming for the Holy
[2:11:26] Ghost we got to know what we're coming

[2:11:41] receive it but let me know what I want
[2:11:42] to
[2:11:45] receive amen and then you hear people
[2:11:48] talking all kinds of foolish
[2:11:50] things and the foolish things what they
[2:11:52] say means nothing to you because you
[2:11:54] know somebody could come to you and show
[2:11:56] you a banana and say this is an onion
[2:11:57] you look at the person and says look
[2:11:59] that's not so because you know what an
[2:12:00] onion is when some says this is the Holy
[2:12:03] Ghost you know it's wrong because you
[2:12:04] know what the Holy Ghost is and what the
[2:12:06] results it will bring
[2:12:09] amen amen so when you come for an
[2:12:12] Evidence he said that's where the enemy
[2:12:14] L but bom goes on here he says when some
[2:12:18] of them fellows looked over and seen
[2:12:20] these great Giants of Canaan oh they
[2:12:22] says we can't do it but they brought
[2:12:24] back the evidence that the land was
[2:12:25] there they had not been falsely LED God
[2:12:28] was proven to them his word even before
[2:12:31] they entered the
[2:12:37] land I have more quotes than that but I
[2:12:39] wasn't go into
[2:12:41] that but
[2:12:43] now we know what the Holy Ghost does
[2:12:46] when he comes
[2:12:53] okay now if I'll share it with you like
[2:12:56] this when you know what the Holy Ghost
[2:12:58] does when he comes you could take what
[2:13:01] you see the Holy Ghost done in your life
[2:13:03] and compare it with the word brother
[2:13:04] Bram said the folks of Pentecost did
[2:13:07] that he said when they went to Pentecost
[2:13:09] he says on the Holy Ghost came he said
[2:13:11] they compared what they receive with the
[2:13:14] promised
[2:13:15] word and then when they saw it come
[2:13:17] together so Peter could have stood on
[2:13:19] the day of Pentecost and said what you
[2:13:20] see happening is not drunken men but
[2:13:22] this is what Joel said come to pass so
[2:13:24] brother bam says when they receive it
[2:13:26] they compared it back with the
[2:13:29] word to see what they
[2:13:32] had all right you and I we do the same
[2:13:36] Paul did that Paul met him under the
[2:13:38] road to
[2:13:38] Damascus and Paul went to Arabia and
[2:13:42] spent about three years in Arabia
[2:13:43] comparing his experience with the word
[2:13:45] of God to be sure of what he had his
[2:13:48] experience is because the baptism of the
[2:13:49] Holy Ghost is an experience but that
[2:13:51] experience must be compared with the
[2:13:53] word and you and I it is our duty before
[2:13:56] God to prove all things and it is our
[2:13:58] duty not the duty of somebody else I
[2:14:00] don't want somebody else to prove it to
[2:14:01] me I want to be able to have the proof
[2:14:03] myself and then as somebody you know you
[2:14:05] take the word of God that's why you hear
[2:14:07] the tapes you listen to the message you
[2:14:09] come to church you hear you know the
[2:14:11] truth of the word of God and then you
[2:14:13] take what you hear and compare it with
[2:14:15] your experience to make sure that both
[2:14:16] of them death tail
[2:14:18] and then you know where you stand Now
[2:14:20] quickly as I'm going to finish now
[2:14:22] because I have to stop if I have all a
[2:14:26] lot of quotes here and how you go about
[2:14:27] doing that and I won't have time I won't
[2:14:29] have time so I'm going to have to stop
[2:14:32] if you cannot let's see if God knows
[2:14:34] let's say there might be folks in the
[2:14:35] church
[2:14:37] here and um you've got the baptism of
[2:14:40] the Holy Ghost the life of Jesus Christ
[2:14:42] has come within you youve tried to
[2:14:44] compare it with the word of God and you
[2:14:45] just having a hard time to be able to
[2:14:47] come compare it and to really be
[2:14:49] satisfied in your heart even when you
[2:14:51] compare it then God does something else
[2:14:53] when you're in a condition like that and
[2:14:54] we have a several cases in the message
[2:14:57] of that and also in the
[2:15:00] scriptures are you following me what I'm
[2:15:03] saying huh are you following me all
[2:15:07] right let's take one of the examples
[2:15:10] that brother Brandon mentions here in
[2:15:13] the scriptures and the example we have
[2:15:14] in the Bible was Joseph in the Bible and
[2:15:17] Mary came to him and told him Joe Joseph
[2:15:20] the angel Gabriel visited me and what is
[2:15:23] conceiving me he said I'm pregnant and
[2:15:25] what is conceiving me is of the Holy
[2:15:26] Ghost brother bandam said Joseph made a
[2:15:28] mistake he never took it back to the
[2:15:33] word okay had he taken it back to the
[2:15:36] word he would found out that Mary was
[2:15:38] right but he was a sincere believer a
[2:15:40] True Believer and couldn't take it back
[2:15:42] to the word therefore God did something
[2:15:45] else for him and not only did God do it
[2:15:47] for Joseph Joseph of that time but he
[2:15:48] did it in this age which I'll share it
[2:15:50] with you so what God did he visited
[2:15:53] Joseph in a dream that needed no
[2:15:56] interpretation now we have another case
[2:15:58] of sister Shepherd brother bam said she
[2:16:00] was worried I have all the quotes here
[2:16:02] in Blasphemous names he mentioned it
[2:16:04] many many times about five or six times
[2:16:06] he said sister Shepherd was worried and
[2:16:08] for sister Shepherd she went to meet the
[2:16:09] Lord she was at the church at Hearts
[2:16:11] Springs she and the CER they were very
[2:16:13] close friends and but Israel here your
[2:16:15] pastor knows her very well and I knew
[2:16:17] and every time I'd come to Hot Springs
[2:16:18] she'd always come to hear me preach she
[2:16:20] love my Min she loved me and Lov my
[2:16:21] Ministry
[2:16:23] anyway she was having that H time she
[2:16:26] said brother BR I heard you say that it
[2:16:27] was not speaking in tongues and
[2:16:29] prophesying and all of this and she was
[2:16:31] worried and she said to the Lord if you
[2:16:33] want to Lord I don't want to to do this
[2:16:36] but let me just read it for you just a
[2:16:38] little bit then um she said to the Lord
[2:16:42] prove it to me prove to me that I have
[2:16:45] the Holy Ghost Lord that was her words
[2:16:48] to
[2:16:49] God now that's a hard thing for somebody
[2:16:53] saying
[2:16:55] and all right I'm just just read it for
[2:16:57] you just a little bsy bit
[2:16:59] here have the quote here brother said
[2:17:01] first you go to trial to see if you're
[2:17:03] going ready going to go on that was the
[2:17:04] one I was telling you and then God gives
[2:17:06] you the Holy Ghost okay that quote was
[2:17:08] here but I'm going to I'm not going to
[2:17:09] go back on that one in Blas name but
[2:17:12] random sister I was Sister in dreaming
[2:17:13] she dreamed well first she was Disturbed
[2:17:16] what's the use of going on and trying to
[2:17:17] struggle your life if God requires us to
[2:17:20] receive the Holy Ghost and we don't have
[2:17:21] it she's worried then brother Bram
[2:17:23] continues here paragraph 98 he says now
[2:17:26] a sister's dream now she was worried
[2:17:28] whether she had the holy ghost or not
[2:17:30] and she laid down across the dwall where
[2:17:32] her husband and was reading a paper and
[2:17:35] he goes on right here and then he goes
[2:17:37] on to say she was walking the floor
[2:17:39] first I'm trying to hurry before she
[2:17:41] dreamed and ringing her hands and
[2:17:43] thinking Lord have I got the Holy Ghost
[2:17:46] can you prove to me me some says that
[2:17:49] because I shouted or some say because I
[2:17:51] spoke with tongues and we believe all of
[2:17:53] that but have I really got it now here
[2:17:55] is a woman with the Holy Ghost still
[2:17:58] asking God prove it to
[2:18:03] me now such a prayer people will think
[2:18:06] would be a prayer would be an
[2:18:08] unscriptural prayer for you to go before
[2:18:11] God and said father could you prove it
[2:18:12] to me but if you really go God ansers
[2:18:15] Prince still Shepherd did it and God did
[2:18:17] the same what he did to Joseph he
[2:18:19] visited sister Shepherd where a dream
[2:18:22] that's
[2:18:25] right we have lot of
[2:18:29] examples but I need to
[2:18:32] stop I found four examples in the
[2:18:35] message of
[2:18:40] that but I need this
[2:18:43] something it's
[2:18:45] after huh
[2:18:49] okay you want me to read another one for
[2:18:54] you you hear people
[2:18:56] say and it's
[2:19:01] true if you have the Holy Ghost God gave
[2:19:05] you the Holy
[2:19:07] Ghost and you're a True
[2:19:09] Believer you could never have a doubt in
[2:19:12] your mind I agree you will never have a
[2:19:15] doubt in your mind that something
[2:19:16] happened in your
[2:19:18] life you know that God did something for
[2:19:21] you but but I'm not saying
[2:19:25] everybody in some people's case they
[2:19:27] take it back to the word and it settles
[2:19:29] in some people case they try to take it
[2:19:31] back to the word and there's still a
[2:19:33] question mark in their mind they're not
[2:19:35] doubting their experience they're
[2:19:37] wondering they're worried about it let
[2:19:40] me give you an example another one again
[2:19:43] and what God did okay oh you you holding
[2:19:47] me here
[2:19:48] I want to try to to to to finish so he
[2:19:53] takes us to Shepherd we're going to take
[2:19:54] another one her name is Sister
[2:19:59] Bruce and here's what sister Bruce told
[2:20:02] Brother
[2:20:05] brandom I got more than just sister
[2:20:10] Bruce this year is the private interview
[2:20:12] with sister Bruce but I'm talking about
[2:20:15] here and uh
[2:20:18] he's talking to Sister Bruce he says I
[2:20:19] visit you in the hospital that time and
[2:20:21] I prayed constantly God wouldn't let you
[2:20:23] die because you value to the church
[2:20:26] that's so nice yes it
[2:20:28] is I've prayed for people that God
[2:20:30] wouldn't take them because they're such
[2:20:31] a value to the church and I didn't even
[2:20:33] realize it I read this some sometimes
[2:20:35] you do things and then you come back you
[2:20:36] know you hit in those cours it's a
[2:20:38] blessing all right cuz you your value to
[2:20:41] the church now I know you I know you are
[2:20:43] going to be all right sister Bruce I
[2:20:45] believe that with all my heart see
[2:20:48] sister Bruce answering sister Bruce
[2:20:51] sister Georgia Bruce says brother Bram
[2:20:53] most of all I want the experience that I
[2:20:56] have been sealed in the Holy Ghost and
[2:20:59] if God will reveal it to your
[2:21:02] heart right yes brother bam says I
[2:21:05] believe with all my heart that you're
[2:21:06] real born again sister sister Bruce how
[2:21:09] could that Spirit just leave you but you
[2:21:11] get sick you get rary and you're a
[2:21:13] nervous type person but bam goes on to
[2:21:15] talk to Sister
[2:21:16] Bruce
[2:21:21] he says he goes on to say Satan Maybe
[2:21:26] Might present something that out of this
[2:21:27] way see then God you your nature and God
[2:21:30] works and Satan works and then when
[2:21:32] Satan tries to make you believe that you
[2:21:34] are not see you keep building this and
[2:21:37] maybe this and this see don't look at
[2:21:40] yourself sister Bruce remember brother
[2:21:41] Bram goes on then sister Bruce says this
[2:21:44] to brother
[2:21:46] brandham
[2:21:48] sister Bruce
[2:21:51] says he says I'm G I'm skipping some of
[2:21:55] it all right because we can to read a
[2:21:56] lot this is nice her discussion with
[2:21:57] brother brandom sister Bru says I have
[2:22:00] never had an experience that I have been
[2:22:02] filled with the Holy Ghost that I could
[2:22:04] put my foot
[2:22:10] on you very quiet tonight right you
[2:22:15] might say well brother puson I'm worried
[2:22:18] because I never had something I could
[2:22:20] put my finger on to say this particular
[2:22:22] day this this this this this this right
[2:22:25] here no don't raise your hand if you're
[2:22:27] in that condition
[2:22:28] tonight some people say I had the
[2:22:31] experience I know God Did It For Me
[2:22:40] M sister Bruce is telling that to
[2:22:42] brother brandham then brother bham turns
[2:22:44] along and tell her
[2:22:46] this when he's
[2:22:49] finished let me see if I can read it for
[2:22:51] you oh Lord help me here taking too much
[2:22:57] time he's praying for her at the end of
[2:23:00] the pray he says now to the great
[2:23:01] Shepherd over all of us the Lord Jesus
[2:23:04] Christ and in his name I lay my hands
[2:23:06] upon my sister may The God Who made her
[2:23:09] and brought her to this earth may his
[2:23:12] may his spirit that sealed her away from
[2:23:14] the things of the world to be your
[2:23:16] servant made heal her sick body but AB
[2:23:19] Bram never prayed and asked God to seal
[2:23:21] her or to give her the baptism of the
[2:23:23] Holy Ghost because he knew she had it
[2:23:24] and in his price it made his spirit that
[2:23:26] sealed her away and yet she's
[2:23:31] questioning she's not doubting her
[2:23:33] experience she's wondering do I already
[2:23:36] have it could I already put my my foot
[2:23:37] on it there's another case that it again
[2:23:40] I have two more cases but I think to be
[2:23:43] fair to you all I better move away a
[2:23:46] little bit from it there was something
[2:23:47] else I wanted to share with you just
[2:23:49] before I finish up and don't be afraid
[2:23:54] to go before the Lord not in doubts of
[2:23:56] course when you begin to ask the Lord
[2:23:58] for an Evidence don't forget you want to
[2:24:00] meet Satan
[2:24:02] amen don't forget once you once you hit
[2:24:05] that word proof and evidence the devil
[2:24:07] is in that too he did it to the
[2:24:09] lutherans he did it to the Baptist the
[2:24:11] believe if we believe we got it forget
[2:24:13] it if we shout we got it if we speak in
[2:24:16] tongues we got it that devil is in the
[2:24:17] evidence you got to be careful but the
[2:24:20] truth of it is you've got the right to
[2:24:22] come before
[2:24:24] God and ask him because why why live
[2:24:28] through your life in this in this life
[2:24:30] with all kinds of doubts hindering you
[2:24:32] and boring you there has to come a time
[2:24:34] and point in your life where the doubts
[2:24:37] are settled and the only how the doubts
[2:24:38] are settled is he's got to do it and
[2:24:42] therefore you come before him and you
[2:24:43] just pray and if the doubts are settled
[2:24:45] in your heart you says praise the Lord
[2:24:47] I've come to the place because you have
[2:24:48] to come a day in your life where you
[2:24:51] know that he is in you and you're in him
[2:24:54] and he will bring you he brings you
[2:24:56] there and you could pray and ask
[2:24:58] him you see it now there is many
[2:25:01] scriptures I have other of quotes but I
[2:25:03] think other things I purposely pulled
[2:25:06] away
[2:25:08] from I got
[2:25:10] more on how you go ahead proven it but
[2:25:14] per personally I think we got to stop
[2:25:17] okay because I've taken you all along
[2:25:20] okay and I trust that this meeting
[2:25:22] tonight was a help if it was a help to
[2:25:26] you could you raise your hand give God
[2:25:29] praise it was a help to
[2:25:32] you to settle some questions in your
[2:25:35] heart and
[2:25:37] God
[2:25:39] richly richly bless you I can honestly
[2:25:42] tell you all that in the last couple of
[2:25:43] weeks months of my life I have never
[2:25:48] gone into the Realms of Revelation and
[2:25:50] things that God has shown me like in the
[2:25:52] last couple of months in my life so many
[2:25:55] things brother George used to open my
[2:25:56] eyes to see I'm so grateful to him and
[2:25:59] some of what I shared with the ministers
[2:26:01] and if I had the time back with the
[2:26:03] ministers I could have probably shared
[2:26:04] more with them on things what he has
[2:26:06] caused me to see and to believe and it's
[2:26:08] all the realities of this message and
[2:26:11] the realities of the things of the Lord
[2:26:12] and what he has done so you can you you
[2:26:15] I mean if this why live your life with
[2:26:17] all kinds of funny question mark and the
[2:26:18] devil tempting you and bothering you and
[2:26:20] you're not sure and you stumbling to the
[2:26:22] church and hoping and hoping and hoping
[2:26:23] one day that will be settled no quit
[2:26:25] that that's not the program of God for
[2:26:27] you go straight before him prove the
[2:26:30] thing amen go before him and um you know
[2:26:33] brother bam talked about what God did
[2:26:34] for him to make him know that he had the
[2:26:37] Holy
[2:26:39] Ghost how many knows what was what
[2:26:42] brother Ram said God did for
[2:26:44] him whoa nobody
[2:26:50] I'm in trouble tonight big
[2:26:53] trouble I should not have even mentioned
[2:26:55] it I thought everybody you know I you
[2:26:59] see I put away my notes I was going now
[2:27:02] try to get your pastor to come up here
[2:27:05] and meet get away from here I remember I
[2:27:08] I did this in one Church you know and I
[2:27:10] sat down and the pastor got up there and
[2:27:11] pull me right back up grab my hand and
[2:27:13] pull me right back up to the
[2:27:15] platform Contin and the congregation was
[2:27:19] there wanted you know they don't want me
[2:27:21] to leave but the Lord knows
[2:27:27] okay better
[2:27:29] bandom I
[2:27:31] promise I
[2:27:32] promise we'll try to finish here
[2:27:38] okay it's quick it's
[2:27:41] quick okay it's in question and answers
[2:27:45] and brother brandham says here
[2:27:48] uh when somebody says evil about you say
[2:27:50] something good if you can't say
[2:27:51] something good about them then don't say
[2:27:53] nothing just let it go see and then when
[2:27:55] you get to yourself pray for them okay
[2:27:58] then he says this here if there's one
[2:28:00] thing in my my life that helped me to
[2:28:02] understand that the Holy Ghost came into
[2:28:04] me down there that day has been that I
[2:28:06] was hot-headed fiery Irish on both sides
[2:28:10] and I can always never eat hardly at all
[2:28:13] my mouth was always mashed where
[2:28:14] somebody mashed it jumping up your I
[2:28:16] shouldn't jump up and you remember him
[2:28:19] when he was so mad he said he would get
[2:28:21] so mad and he try to shoot those
[2:28:23] guys now he said if there one thing that
[2:28:26] help him to know he had the Holy Ghost
[2:28:29] why is he saying this because it was the
[2:28:31] change that God did in his
[2:28:33] life because part of the evidence of the
[2:28:35] Holy Ghost is when he makes that change
[2:28:37] in
[2:28:39] you now a tell
[2:28:41] this that helped me too and I'm not
[2:28:45] comparing butam but you know I was when
[2:28:48] I was a little boy I was training into
[2:28:50] box and when I was training into box My
[2:28:53] Philosophy was this because I grew up in
[2:28:55] a tough place and I was
[2:28:59] fearless and I was in the
[2:29:01] gangs and My Philosophy was I rather go
[2:29:04] to jail than go to the hospital I says
[2:29:07] the other guy will go to the hospital
[2:29:08] but I'll go to jail and you know what
[2:29:10] that meant see so anyway that's how I
[2:29:14] was and in boxing we would box and I
[2:29:18] would said hit me in the training
[2:29:20] process and stuff hit me any part of my
[2:29:22] body but don't touch my face because
[2:29:25] when you touch my face whatever devil
[2:29:28] whatever the devil was that was in me
[2:29:30] will rear
[2:29:31] up and I remember I was went to a box
[2:29:36] with this guy I can't remember his name
[2:29:37] right now and we agreed we will not
[2:29:40] punch one another in the face all right
[2:29:42] so the bell rang bang and we went into
[2:29:45] the ring the box and and he punched me
[2:29:47] in my face I said what happened he said
[2:29:48] my hand
[2:29:50] slipped and then he punched me again in
[2:29:52] my face the second time and I said what
[2:29:55] happened you my hand slipped I said all
[2:29:56] right and then I I let loose there was
[2:29:58] no more rules no more I punched that guy
[2:30:01] until he fell in his knees he lifted his
[2:30:03] hand up to surrender and I was still
[2:30:04] punching and the referee had to drag me
[2:30:07] off of him that's how it was and it was
[2:30:11] bad my rat was so bad I can't tell you
[2:30:15] all but one of the worst things was
[2:30:17] happened is when with my daddy we were
[2:30:19] up in the tropical forest together and I
[2:30:21] teased him and tell him some stuff I
[2:30:23] shouldn't and I the problem with it is
[2:30:24] I'd given my heart to the Lord and I was
[2:30:26] a young convert already I was already a
[2:30:28] convert a Christian and you know how the
[2:30:30] devil is after that happened to me the
[2:30:32] devil said you nothing else but a
[2:30:33] hypocrite with a big H you know how the
[2:30:35] devil loves to pour it on you and that
[2:30:38] night Daddy went out and he took some
[2:30:39] drinks and he came back and he grabbed
[2:30:42] me from off of I was sleeping on the
[2:30:44] ground we didn't have any bed you had to
[2:30:45] sleep on the floor he grabbed me like
[2:30:47] this and Raised Me Up and he was about
[2:30:49] 260b and he out of my sleep trying to
[2:30:51] get to sleep out of my eye and he
[2:30:53] punched me when he punched me of course
[2:30:55] I you know but if I wasn't a boxer and
[2:30:58] was training at that time to take
[2:31:00] punches and you know i' had K Patrick
[2:31:02] and guys that were 130 and 14050 I
[2:31:06] weighed about 125 pounds and they'll
[2:31:08] punch me they'll punch me so I could
[2:31:10] take a punch when I get into the ring
[2:31:12] anyway when he punched me like this you
[2:31:13] know and then being the fact I was in
[2:31:16] the gangs and fight I tripped him and he
[2:31:18] fell on the ground and when he fell on
[2:31:19] the ground I grabbed his head and banged
[2:31:21] it against the wall and I mean I was I
[2:31:24] just lost it and when I lost it some
[2:31:26] tell me it's your dad you promised not
[2:31:29] to do that when I jumped off of him I
[2:31:33] had him Bend to the ground and I ran out
[2:31:35] of the house and that night my face was
[2:31:37] swollen when I slept in the
[2:31:39] forest and when I heard the Bible says
[2:31:43] when they hit you on One Cheek present
[2:31:45] the other cheek I said Lord I could
[2:31:46] never be a Christian present the other
[2:31:48] cheek on
[2:31:51] my present the other cheek is my I'm
[2:31:55] finishing now and one day I was at the
[2:31:59] funeral and this guy for some reason I
[2:32:01] don't know something happened and before
[2:32:04] I realized it he he slapped me across my
[2:32:06] face brother before I become a
[2:32:10] Christian you hit me in my
[2:32:12] face if it take months and years you
[2:32:16] pray for it and you know what before I
[2:32:18] realized it I turned to him and says I
[2:32:21] forgive you it was when I came into the
[2:32:24] message then I knew that something had
[2:32:26] happened in here and when it happens in
[2:32:29] you and God changes you he puts you
[2:32:32] through a trial to show you that he has
[2:32:35] changed you that you're not the
[2:32:39] same and that is one of the
[2:32:43] evidence of the Holy Spirit in your life
[2:32:48] God bless you all thank you for your
[2:32:50] patience with me
[2:32:52] tonight and God bless every one of you I
[2:32:56] love you all I expect to spend eternity
[2:32:59] with you I trust that this meeting was a
[2:33:02] blessing to you don't be afraid to go
[2:33:05] forward and prove it as you yield
[2:33:07] yourself to him you could say father in
[2:33:10] Heaven I want a proof I want the
[2:33:14] Assurance I want to know in my heart
[2:33:18] what is the use of my life as sister
[2:33:20] Shepherd was saying if I don't have it
[2:33:23] she said Lord could you prove it to me
[2:33:25] sister Bruce and then I got two more
[2:33:27] examples in the Bible in the in the
[2:33:28] message that I will not read tonight I'm
[2:33:30] not going about going to it maybe
[2:33:32] another time okay and purposely I held
[2:33:35] back some other stuff not to go into it
[2:33:37] to be able to save time but I want to
[2:33:39] say I love all of you am and God bless
[2:33:43] every one of you and when the trials
[2:33:46] come remember just sing that song

[2:33:59] Trials Come God equips his man he equips
[2:34:02] his woman he equips his child even
