[30:00] I appreciate your prayers as we approach
[30:03] the word of the Lord
[30:05] tonight if you have your Bibles I'll
[30:07] invite you to turn with me to the book
[30:09] of First
[30:10] Corinthians very familiar passage of
[30:13] scripture chapter
[30:16] 13 and uh we'll go then from there as we
[30:20] move
[30:21] forward and I'm certainly
[30:24] honored uh to be here tonight my dad
[30:28] always told me he said now son if you
[30:29] don't want a dog hanging around just
[30:31] don't feed him and uh you all have fed
[30:34] me real good when I come over this way
[30:37] and so I guess that's part of the reason
[30:39] I keep coming back oh I keep coming back
[30:44] to The Well of Grace great is the power
[30:48] sweet as the taste every Temptation
[30:51] every trial that I face I keep coming
[30:55] back to the well sing it with me
[30:58] oh I keep coming back to the will of
[31:03] Grace great is the power sweet is the
[31:07] taste every Temptation every trial that
[31:11] I face I keep coming back to the
[31:16] world I keep coming back to the
[31:21] world oh my are you thankful for
[31:24] spiritual food and good in due season
[31:27] amen
[31:29] amen you know brother Bram said I just
[31:31] kind of out especially the other
[31:33] churches I just scatter a little sheep
[31:35] food along and they'll Trail it back to
[31:38] the main
[31:39] source amen and so we we know who the
[31:43] main source is is that right sir the
[31:45] lovely Lord
[31:47] Jesus and so we're here tonight by the
[31:49] grace of the Lord to put emphasis on the
[31:53] Lord
[31:54] Jesus and um I really really do deem
[31:58] this a special privilege tonight because
[32:02] um even though by the grace of the Lord
[32:04] I've spoken to thousands I never get
[32:07] used to coming before God's children you
[32:11] just tremble in the presence of the
[32:12] God's children and when you realize that
[32:16] you have something more precious in your
[32:18] hands than the lovely the the literal
[32:21] blood of the Lord
[32:24] Jesus
[32:25] you are more precious in the sight sight
[32:29] of
[32:30] God than his own blood or he would have
[32:32] never made the transaction he would have
[32:35] never given his blood for you so let us
[32:39] remember that we are his main
[32:45] purpose I perhaps I've said that before
[32:49] even here but I can't seem to get away
[32:51] from it as the prophet of God says here
[32:54] in the church age book He said
[32:58] uh
[32:59] god let's say
[33:01] Elohim see the self-existing one in
[33:05] order to give himself a reason and a
[33:07] purpose for
[33:10] being had to predestinate a people that
[33:13] would need Redemption that's right
[33:15] that's us that's you we all need
[33:18] Redemption is that right amen so whole
[33:22] purpose of God before the foundation of
[33:24] the world was you not the moon and the
[33:28] stars the cosmos the cosmos the the
[33:31] galaxies Etc no the Earth and all of its
[33:34] fullness no that's not God's main
[33:37] purpose that's just a backdrop but his
[33:39] main purpose is you
[33:42] yes amen and so may we remember that as
[33:46] we approach the service tonight and uh
[33:50] uh I'd like to as a subtopic
[33:53] tonight refer to the Great Divine
[33:56] Romance
[33:58] that God had amen and still has and he's
[34:02] able to produce himself a
[34:05] bride amen amen may the Lord help us now
[34:10] if you have your Bibles again and shame
[34:12] on you if you don't have a
[34:15] Bible you need to sell something and get
[34:19] one you'll never understand the message
[34:22] until you have some conception of the
[34:24] Bible because even when the angel of the
[34:27] Lord come to brother Brenham he said if
[34:29] I hadn't seen it in the Bible I wouldn't
[34:31] have accepted it he said you might
[34:35] disagree with me now on my Doctrine and
[34:37] so forth but he said if you'll search
[34:40] your scripture search the Bible you'll
[34:43] find it hits the mark because the angel
[34:46] of the Lord came and taught it to me and
[34:48] he showed me in the Bible where to find
[34:51] it amen so we need to read our
[34:56] Bibles I think it was brother a brother
[34:59] from over in this part of the country I
[35:01] don't have my cell phone with me but he
[35:04] was up in the pull pit and he took his
[35:05] cell phone up and held it up like this
[35:07] and he said now what am I doing what am
[35:09] I reading nobody knows then he got his
[35:13] Bible he said now what am I
[35:16] reading thank God for the cell phones
[35:18] I'm not trying to you know and But be
[35:21] sure you have your Bible on your cell
[35:23] phone too is that right amen and uh so 1
[35:27] Corinthians chapter 13 and we'll begin
[35:30] reading with the first verse though I
[35:33] speak with tongues of men and angels and
[35:36] I have not charity I am become as a
[35:40] sounding brass and a tinkling symbol and
[35:43] though I have the gift of Prophecy and
[35:46] understand all the Mysteries and all
[35:49] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[35:52] that I could remove mountains and have
[35:54] not charity I am nothing and though I
[35:57] bestow all my goods to feed the poor
[36:01] though I give my body to be burned yeah
[36:04] become a martyr have not charity it
[36:07] profiteth me
[36:10] nothing charity suffereth long and is
[36:13] kind charity envieth not charity
[36:16] vaunteth not itself is not puffed up do
[36:19] not behave itself unseemingly seeketh
[36:22] not her own is not easily provoked
[36:24] thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in
[36:27] iniquity but rejoiceth in truth beareth
[36:30] all things believeth all things hopeth
[36:34] all things endureth all things charity
[36:37] never
[36:38] faileth but where there be
[36:40] prophecies they shall fail where there
[36:43] be tongues they shall cease whether
[36:46] there be knowledge it shall vanish away
[36:49] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[36:51] part but when that which is perfect is
[36:54] come then that which is in heart shall
[36:59] be done
[37:00] away when I was a child I spake as a
[37:02] child understood as a child I thought as
[37:05] a child but when I became a man I put
[37:08] away childish
[37:11] things for now Paul speaking 2,000 years
[37:17] ago this was writing to the Corinthian
[37:20] Church about 2,000 years ago
[37:24] now we see through a glass Darkly but
[37:29] then I want to say that that then is
[37:32] now that then was not 2,000 years ago
[37:36] that then is now okay for now Paul said
[37:40] we see through a glass Darkly but then
[37:43] face to
[37:45] face now I know in part but then shall I
[37:49] know even as also I am
[37:53] known and now abideth faith hope and
[37:55] charity these three but the greatest of
[37:58] these is
[38:01] Charity let's pray Heavenly Father we're
[38:04] asking now that you will anoint both our
[38:07] ears and our tongue Lord our hearing and
[38:11] our speaking May our thoughts be your
[38:14] thoughts and may our Expressions be
[38:16] pleasing in thy sight we're claiming
[38:19] this service Together For Your Glory and
[38:22] Lord we're here to speak of thee we
[38:24] we're here as the Shepherds of old would

[38:30] honey on the Rock oh and when the sick
[38:32] sheep got to lick in the Limestone Rock

[38:37] stone Lord we need your minerals tonight

[40:24] thinking he said you'll find it all
[40:26] drawn out in my
[40:28] book my book The Seven Church Ages which

[41:08] voice the word preached actually
[41:10] demonstrated
[41:12] itself like a flaming cutting sword it
[41:15] went to the consciences of men and like
[41:17] a surgeon's knife it cut out the
[41:20] diseases and set the captives
[41:22] free everywhere those early Believers
[41:25] went they went preaching the gospel the
[41:28] word and God confirmed that word with

[42:30] when Jesus walked the shores of Galilee
[42:33] oh yes the prophet of God said that why
[42:35] because the work of redemption hadn't
[42:37] been wrought at that time but now amen
[42:41] let the redeemed of the Lord say so the
[42:43] Holy Ghost had not yet been given at
[42:45] that time oh but this is a greater day
[42:48] than that we had not seen the seven
[42:50] manifestations of the seven spirits of
[42:52] God down through the seven Church ages
[42:54] but now we can look back with all of
[42:56] that

[45:00] pray good then pray for
[45:03] me I'm scheduled to go my first time to
[45:06] Pakistan next month and then the
[45:09] following month in December back

[45:13] um oh East Africa Tanzania or tanzan and
[45:18] so I appreciate your
[45:20] prayers and this year has been a very
[45:22] busy year for me I've been in several
[45:25] different countries doing missionary
[45:26] work by the Grace of the
[45:28] Lord but do we really know how to pray
[45:31] I'm asking myself that
[45:33] question and uh did you ever notice how
[45:37] that man has a tendency to build their
[45:40] own kingdom build their own house build
[45:43] their own church build their own this
[45:45] build their own
[45:48] reputation you know especially our
[45:51] politicians all due respects but
[45:55] nonetheless when
[45:57] Jesus was ask Master teach us how to
[46:02] pray what is the first thing he taught
[46:04] us to ask for when we
[46:06] pray anybody remember right off
[46:09] hand don't ever let me ask you this
[46:11] question again without you raising your
[46:13] hand
[46:15] okay Our Father who art in heaven
[46:18] Hallowed be thy name we come worshiping
[46:20] him first is that right exalting him
[46:23] first amen any good wife knows you got
[46:25] to can't exalt your husband a little bit
[46:27] if you want to get something from him
[46:28] right got to give you you know the way
[46:30] to a man's heart is through his stomach
[46:32] cook him a good meal you know and talk
[46:34] to him a little bit worship him a little
[46:36] bit yes sir now not I'm not teaching
[46:39] worship your husband exactly but you do
[46:41] if you don't obey your husband you don't
[46:43] honor your husband you're not even a
[46:45] Christian brother Ram said now don't
[46:48] tell me that you are a Christian and you
[46:49] don't obey your
[46:53] husband somebody some some of you
[46:55] Brothers ought to say Amen to
[46:58] that it's okay for the Sisters to it's
[47:01] okay for the Sisters to say Amen too
[47:03] we'll get to the brothers in a minute
[47:04] okay we'll get we'll get to the the
[47:07] sisters part and it's okay for the
[47:09] Sisters to say Amen because brother Bram
[47:12] said ain't that right sister Nelly you
[47:13] ought sister Nelly you ought to be able
[47:15] to say or uh sister Cox you ought to be
[47:18] able to say Amen to
[47:20] that okay but let's consider now thy
[47:26] kingdom
[47:27] come what but we are always approaching
[47:31] God and dealing with him as a little
[47:33] Aaron boy wanting this that and the
[47:36] other selfish but the true spirit of God
[47:40] is unselfish and it's to promote God
[47:43] that's thy kingdom yes sir come that's
[47:48] thy not my not my will thy will be
[47:52] done where did the Fall start not in the
[47:56] Garden of Eden
[47:57] not with the
[47:59] woman
[48:01] e oh yes on Earth but there was another
[48:06] fall that caused that fall and that fall
[48:09] started in
[48:10] heaven Church order started getting out
[48:14] of order in
[48:16] heaven whenever you study the seals
[48:20] you'll notice in that series the first
[48:23] thing brother Brandon preached was God
[48:25] hidden and revealed in simplicity and he
[48:27] dealt with church order setting the
[48:29] church in order is that right so Church
[48:32] order is part of the revelation of the
[48:34] seals and church order is
[48:37] essential it's essential the first thing
[48:40] that H happened in heaven was the
[48:42] breaking of church
[48:44] order Lucifer wanted to exalt himself
[48:47] above God the song leader the worship
[48:51] leader wanted to become the pastor when
[48:54] God's the only
[48:55] Pastor I said there's only one Chief
[48:58] Shepherd hey and if you cannot honor the
[49:04] uh
[49:05] Pastor he said at least honor and
[49:08] respect the office is that right amen
[49:12] yes sir and so we we see that Lucifer
[49:15] got out of Heaven out of order in heaven
[49:18] and he got kicked out of heaven is that
[49:20] right and it didn't Shake God a
[49:24] bit no God didn't get upset no he took
[49:27] two-thirds of his congregation when he
[49:29] left the congregations of Heaven 2third
[49:33] of the angels went with Lucifer when he
[49:37] fell did God get
[49:39] excited he knew it was going to happen
[49:42] he seen the thoughts of Satan before he
[49:45] actually expressed those
[49:48] thoughts he was perfect in the day he
[49:50] was created but he was given self-will
[49:53] he was given free moral agency yes a
[49:56] choice you you're given a choice each
[50:00] one of us is given a choice choice is a
[50:02] wonderful thing but your choice amen
[50:04] will determine your Eternal
[50:06] destination oh yes your
[50:09] choice
[50:14] amen yet on the other hand Jesus said
[50:18] you've not chosen me I've chosen you he
[50:21] knows what your choice is going to be is
[50:24] that right and but now whenever see
[50:27] there's no Redemption for Angels Fallen
[50:29] Angels There's No Redemption for Angels
[50:32] period spoken of in the
[50:36] scriptures if you find it bring it to me
[50:39] I want to know
[50:44] it no Redemption for angels angels are
[50:47] not Heirs of
[50:51] Salvation angels can never sing the song
[50:54] Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that
[50:56] Sav to like me no
[50:59] no angels are ministering Spirits sent
[51:02] forth to minister unto us who are Heirs
[51:05] of

[51:10] sons and
[51:12] daughters who would God hear and answer
[51:15] prayer for first an angel in his
[51:17] presence or a son of God in his presence
[51:20] a Son of God Amen it's a higher order

[57:11] that was ining how much more do you and
[57:15] I have to spend in prayer much time in
[57:19] prayer if you only knew what time and
[57:24] prayer meant what sometimes when you're
[57:27] in prayer God changes the the complete
[57:31] destination of different things that's
[57:33] going to happen do you believe
[57:37] that might be something fixing that
[57:39] happened and your prayer could change
[57:41] the whole situation well you say if God
[57:44] knows it's going to happen what will my
[57:46] prayer do you remember when he stood
[57:48] there looking out upon the harest he
[57:50] said he was the lord of the Harvest he
[57:53] said the Harvest is right and labors are
[57:56] the few pray ye the lord of the Harvest
[57:59] that he'll send labors into his harvest
[58:01] in other words pray to me that I will
[58:04] send labors into my Harvest which I'm
[58:06] just telling you it's such a needy thing
[58:09] but part of it lays in human beings do
[58:11] you believe that the kingdom of God lays
[58:15] within the human
[58:18] beings
[58:20] now Jesus said in one place I am the
[58:24] vine ye are are the
[58:27] branches the vine can't bear fruit the
[58:31] branches in the vine bears
[58:34] fruit God cannot bear fruit on himself
[58:38] it's got to take the
[58:40] church is that right he's got to take
[58:43] you branches to bear fruit and when you
[58:47] branches are yielded to the
[58:49] vine then fruit comes forth see what I
[58:53] mean God wants your your hands you want
[58:57] your eyes you want your tongue want your
[59:00] lips want your ears want your hands and
[59:03] feet so he can bring forth fruit through
[59:08] you now Jesus put much time in prayer
[59:12] one day there he told his disciples he
[59:15] said now cross over to the other side he
[59:19] sent him away while he went up in the
[59:21] mountain to
[59:22] pray while he was up there alone really
[59:27] a storm coming up I believe I don't know
[59:31] but I believe if I've been the disciples
[59:33] I've said I know he told us to go over
[59:35] but I I believe I'll just wait till he
[59:37] comes and goes along I like for him to
[59:40] be along in these cases don't you so we
[59:43] see him now going up into the mountain
[59:45] to pray the disciples thrusted out into
[59:48] the sea and picked up their hores and
[59:50] their little ship sail went up and away
[59:53] they started oring across to the other
[59:55] side side where Jesus was to meet him on
[59:59] the other
[1:00:01] side then going in the absence of the
[1:00:05] Holy Spirit or of Christ that invisible
[1:00:08] form on the road over trouble set in and
[1:00:12] usually if you start anywhere without
[1:00:15] Christ troubles on its Road just as soon
[1:00:18] as the devil sees you out of fellowship
[1:00:20] with Christ right then he'll set out on
[1:00:23] as hard as he can just as soon as he you
[1:00:26] away from prayer away from
[1:00:28] consecration Satan will catch you right
[1:00:30] then if he possibly can
[1:00:34] amen all right I want you to notice
[1:00:37] something here in this and it really
[1:00:41] stood out to me it actually came to
[1:00:44] me early early very early this morning
[1:00:48] when I was
[1:00:51] praying about 4:00 in the
[1:00:54] morning praying about what the Lord
[1:00:56] would have me to speak on here thank you
[1:00:59] brother George you're a man after my own
[1:01:02] heart thank you brother appreciate
[1:01:12] it and you
[1:01:15] know with the great vast message that
[1:01:19] we've received a minister that has
[1:01:22] studied the message doesn't have any
[1:01:25] problem finding something inspirational
[1:01:27] to preach
[1:01:28] about but what's the most important
[1:01:31] thing is to find what's
[1:01:34] timely what's in season what's in time
[1:01:37] and what's in season what does the Lord
[1:01:38] want at that particular time see
[1:01:41] otherwise we're just spinning our Wheels
[1:01:43] doing God a service without it being his
[1:01:45] will but this came to me as I was
[1:01:48] praying and I I want to be the first one
[1:01:50] to confess that I don't pray as much as
[1:01:52] I should I really don't and I I desire
[1:01:57] of course uh to to pray more but then
[1:02:02] how do we pray
[1:02:04] and in this I want you to notice we're
[1:02:08] sons of God we're not the only begotten
[1:02:11] Son of God Jesus is the only only
[1:02:15] begotten born through the Virgin birth
[1:02:18] we're born by the word of God being born
[1:02:21] again not of corruptible seed but of The
[1:02:23] Incorruptible the word of God which
[1:02:25] liveth and abideth forever we're born by
[1:02:27] the Holy Spirit by the process of
[1:02:30] justification sanctification and the
[1:02:32] baptism of the Holy Spirit brings that
[1:02:35] full uh procedure to each
[1:02:38] individual but here the Jesus being the
[1:02:42] Son of God now think about it and not
[1:02:45] just a Son of God but the fullness of
[1:02:48] the godhead bodily dwelleth in him he
[1:02:51] was
[1:02:52] Jehovah of the Old Testament is none
[1:02:55] other than Jesus Christ of the New
[1:02:57] Testament is that true amen so what was
[1:03:00] it
[1:03:01] Emmanuel God Amen Among Us God in flesh
[1:03:06] amen
[1:03:07] condescending and becoming one of us to
[1:03:10] redeem us amen and to come into
[1:03:12] fellowship with us but notice here the
[1:03:14] prophet of God said and um uh if I raise
[1:03:19] my hand up like this I'd like for you to
[1:03:21] pause the tape next time if it's playing
[1:03:24] I I would like to emphasize something
[1:03:26] but here in this I want to emphasize
[1:03:28] this how that the prophet of God said
[1:03:31] notice how that Jesus had to pray much
[1:03:35] though he was the son of God he had to
[1:03:38] pray much
[1:03:41] Amen to stay in fellowship with the
[1:03:45] spirit that was within
[1:03:47] him what to stay in fellowship with the
[1:03:51] spirit that was within him you see Jesus
[1:03:55] was
[1:03:56] all
[1:03:58] man but he was also all God that's
[1:04:03] right he was tempted in every manner
[1:04:06] just like you
[1:04:08] are he was all
[1:04:12] man yet he was all God he was fully man
[1:04:16] he was man in every respect as a man
[1:04:21] Hallelujah he's a man who can be touched
[1:04:23] by the feeling of our infirmities
[1:04:26] he's the only mediator
[1:04:28] between God and men and that's the man
[1:04:32] Christ Jesus not the
[1:04:34] pope there's only one mediator amen not
[1:04:38] your
[1:04:39] pastor not your Bishop one mediator
[1:04:43] between God and all men and that's the
[1:04:46] man Christ Jesus he's the high priest of
[1:04:49] our profession is that right oh my he's
[1:04:52] the Holy Spirit that's within you and if
[1:04:55] you want to pray pray amen not to a god
[1:04:58] that's a far off brother Bram said but
[1:05:00] to pray to the god that is within you if
[1:05:03] you're born again believer if you have
[1:05:05] the Holy Ghost then stay in fellowship
[1:05:08] with that spirit that is within you
[1:05:10] that's right because Jesus said as the
[1:05:13] father sent me so send I you amen how
[1:05:16] did the Jesus send the father he got in
[1:05:18] him or how did the father send Jesus it
[1:05:21] was the father in Jesus is that right
[1:05:24] amen and it must be the same with us and
[1:05:27] we must
[1:05:29] pray oh God help us to catch a
[1:05:31] revelation of the
[1:05:33] necessity uh the need for True prayer
[1:05:37] amen praying and and letting amen God
[1:05:41] speak to you he'll bring his thoughts to
[1:05:44] you he'll bring his thoughts to you oh
[1:05:49] yes this great ministry gift that God
[1:05:52] brought to us
[1:05:55] was not just to discern our thoughts and
[1:05:58] the intents of our heart or
[1:06:01] to discern our diseases but more
[1:06:04] importantly it was to discern the very
[1:06:06] thoughts of God to pick up the thoughts
[1:06:08] of God and to reveal the thoughts of God
[1:06:11] and that's what the message is it's the
[1:06:15] interpretation of the thoughts of God
[1:06:18] God is his own
[1:06:20] interpreter let's go to this first quote
[1:06:22] now and it comes from uh questions and
[1:06:26] answers 1964 question ansers number
[1:06:34] two just that part that I have in yellow
[1:06:37] there dear brother just let it
[1:06:38] go uh record 57 First Corinthians 13
[1:06:43] says this when that which is perfect is
[1:06:47] come that which is in part shall be done
[1:06:49] away
[1:06:50] with so all these little things are
[1:06:52] jumping up down like a kid trying to
[1:06:54] talk in tones and all these other things
[1:06:56] when that which is perfect and we do
[1:06:58] have today by God's help the perfect
[1:07:00] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:07:05] Vindication what did you say then that
[1:07:07] which is in part is done away with when
[1:07:10] I was a
[1:07:11] child
[1:07:15] amen let me read it to you now again
[1:07:19] First Corinthians 13 says this when that
[1:07:22] which is perfect is come that which is
[1:07:24] in part shall be be done away with we
[1:07:26] just read it in the scripture is that
[1:07:28] right now your Church of
[1:07:31] Christ uh preachers and teachers and
[1:07:33] many of the denominations say well and I
[1:07:36] actually well I have to be careful okay
[1:07:41] uh but notice here uh they say well you
[1:07:45] know prophecy was done away with so you
[1:07:48] know we don't believe in Prophecy today
[1:07:50] and we don't believe in prophets today
[1:07:52] because it was done away with you know
[1:07:55] when Jesus come that which is perfect
[1:07:57] has come and it's all you know okay but
[1:08:00] here notice what he said when that which
[1:08:03] is perfect is come that which is in part
[1:08:06] shall be done away with so all these
[1:08:09] little things of jumping up and down
[1:08:11] like a kid trying to talk in tongues and
[1:08:13] all these other things when that which
[1:08:15] is perfect
[1:08:17] and we do have today by God's help the
[1:08:22] perfect interpretation of the word with
[1:08:25] Divine
[1:08:27] Vindication then that which is imperfect
[1:08:29] uh that then that which is in part is
[1:08:32] done away with
[1:08:36] see okay
[1:08:38] so this
[1:08:41] message is the perfect interpretation of
[1:08:44] the word of
[1:08:45] God we had the old and the
[1:08:49] new we've had it for
[1:08:53] years ever since the it was finished
[1:08:56] being compiled and become canon in the
[1:08:58] days of John that's why he was banished
[1:09:00] to the AIS of patmas he and maray and
[1:09:03] Andrew were working together to put the
[1:09:05] Epistles of Paul and John and the
[1:09:08] gospels all together to compile it into
[1:09:10] the form of the New Testament Satan
[1:09:12] hates to be exposed amen but we see that
[1:09:16] we've had the word of God but even on
[1:09:19] the aisle of patmas if you'll remember
[1:09:21] John was told seal it up write it not
[1:09:24] but in the of the voice of the seventh
[1:09:26] angel when he shall begin to sound all
[1:09:29] the mysteries of God shall be made known
[1:09:32] today by the grace of God we do have the
[1:09:35] full complete interpretation of the
[1:09:38] Bible I said by the grace of God today
[1:09:41] with the message only through the
[1:09:43] message through the Vindicated messenger
[1:09:46] of Malachi 4 we have the thorough full
[1:09:50] interpretation of this Bible that which
[1:09:53] is perfect the perfect interpretation of
[1:09:55] the Bible it is come hallelujah amen and
[1:10:00] so tonight we're going to be talking
[1:10:02] about the evidence of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:05] let's go forward to uh number two quote
[1:10:09] here and this
[1:10:14] um comes from broken sisters
[1:10:25] today I was talking with my good friend
[1:10:27] Dr Lee Vale who's present now and he's a
[1:10:32] quite a theologian and so we usually
[1:10:35] have some have some pretty good
[1:10:36] discussions on the scripture very smart
[1:10:40] and he asked me one time what I thought
[1:10:42] about the initial evidence of the Holy
[1:10:44] Ghost was it speaking in tongues it's
[1:10:47] been many years ago I said no can't you
[1:10:50] see that he said neither do I said
[1:10:53] though I've been taught that he said
[1:10:55] what would you think could be an
[1:10:56] Evidence I said the most perfect
[1:10:59] evidence I can think of is love and so
[1:11:03] we got talking on that then I thought
[1:11:06] that sounded pretty good so just help
[1:11:08] that if a man's got love but one day the
[1:11:11] Lord the Lord
[1:11:17] Vision continue straighten me out and he
[1:11:21] said that the evidence of the spirit was
[1:11:25] the those who could receive the
[1:11:27] word neither love nor speaking in
[1:11:30] tongues but receiving the word
[1:11:32] hallelujah and then neither love nor
[1:11:36] speaking in tongues but receiving the
[1:11:39] word is that what he
[1:11:41] said all right just that's part of it
[1:11:45] now so keep
[1:11:48] forward Dr Bale was saying to me that
[1:11:51] that is scriptural he said because in
[1:11:54] John 14 Jesus said when he the Holy
[1:11:57] Ghost has come upon you he will reveal
[1:11:59] these things to you that I've taught you
[1:12:01] and will show you things to come so
[1:12:04] there is a genuine evidence of the Holy
[1:12:07] Ghost
[1:12:08] hallu he's never told me anything wrong
[1:12:11] yet that it is that evidence of the Holy
[1:12:15] Ghost is he who can believe the word you
[1:12:18] can receive it because Jesus never said
[1:12:20] when the Holy Ghost has come you'll
[1:12:22] speak with tongues he never said the
[1:12:23] Holy Ghost come you do anything else
[1:12:25] things but he said he will take these
[1:12:28] things of mine and show them to
[1:12:30] you and will show you things that is to
[1:12:33] come Hallelujah so there is a genuine
[1:12:36] evidence of the Holy Ghost According To
[1:12:38] Jesus
[1:12:39] himself so all these Sensations and
[1:12:42] things that people have and still live
[1:12:44] on you can see why they do it see it
[1:12:47] becomes a denomination or stagnated pool
[1:12:51] and there'll never be a denomination
[1:12:53] made upon the perfect word of God it
[1:12:57] can't do it because you can't nominate
[1:13:00] or denominate
[1:13:01] God no sir no
[1:13:07] amen
[1:13:08] so
[1:13:10] now you know Satan hates to be
[1:13:16] exposed and his tactics he don't like
[1:13:20] his tactics to be exposed that's
[1:13:23] right he knows know far better than 90%
[1:13:28] of the
[1:13:29] theologians and I think maybe sometimes
[1:13:32] a great percentage of the so-called
[1:13:34] ministers in this
[1:13:35] message Satan knows that God is
[1:13:38] immutable in his
[1:13:40] ways and he doesn't change and he also
[1:13:43] knows that the true church that was
[1:13:45] established at Pentecost is the true
[1:13:48] church and everything else is is
[1:13:52] wrong and so
[1:13:56] his
[1:13:57] business is to build his own
[1:14:00] kingdom my kingdom come my will be done
[1:14:04] and he's had 7,000 year or 6,000 years
[1:14:07] and that's why brother Brandon preached
[1:14:08] the message Satan's Eden God built his
[1:14:12] Eden in six days and rested on the
[1:14:15] seventh Satan has had now 6,000 years
[1:14:18] and it's come to a Satan's Eden feeding
[1:14:20] on the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:14:22] Evil and it only brings death and Chaos
[1:14:26] amen Satan is the author of confusion
[1:14:29] he's the author of chaos but only God
[1:14:31] can bring peace and uniformity and order
[1:14:34] out of chaos and that's what the message
[1:14:37] is here for is to bring order in your
[1:14:40] home Amen to bring order in your church
[1:14:43] to bring order in your heart to bring
[1:14:45] order in your
[1:14:48] life why do you hunger Church why do you
[1:14:51] thirst it's the father trying to get
[1:14:53] this great Revelation 2 to you that the
[1:14:56] end is here we've
[1:14:58] arrived amen and we have everything we
[1:15:01] have need of now amen if we'll just feed
[1:15:04] on
[1:15:05] it hear ye
[1:15:10] him the evidence of the Holy Ghost has
[1:15:13] not changed it's been the same in every
[1:15:14] Church age read your Bible in each of
[1:15:19] the seven Church ages from Paul Amen to
[1:15:22] brother brandham and this last l and age
[1:15:25] that we're now in in the conclusion of
[1:15:29] every age it's written he that hath an
[1:15:33] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:15:37] unto the churches so the evidence of the
[1:15:40] Holy Ghost has not changed at all the
[1:15:43] evidence of the Holy Spirit has always
[1:15:45] been he that has an ear amen a
[1:15:48] predestinated ear a hunger a heart Amen
[1:15:52] to hear and a a predestinated
[1:15:55] representation to
[1:15:56] receive amen may I remind you of this
[1:15:59] also from the message who is this MDC
[1:16:02] brother bam said only the predestinated
[1:16:05] are considered in
[1:16:10] Redemption I
[1:16:11] said only the predestinated are even
[1:16:16] considered in Redemption redeem means to
[1:16:19] bring back and if you wasn't part of God
[1:16:21] if you wasn't in the Eternal thoughts of
[1:16:23] God if you wasn't in the hemoglobin of
[1:16:26] God the spiritual seed Gene Bank of God
[1:16:31] hallelujah then you'll never be there
[1:16:33] you'll never be a son or daughter of God

[1:17:09] affair you see God is a
[1:17:14] man what yes in the evolution of God it
[1:17:19] shows that he was a man brother bad used
[1:17:21] the word Evolution there and he also
[1:17:23] talks about the evolution of God uh uh

[1:17:28] justification sanctification and baptism
[1:17:30] of the Holy
[1:17:31] Spirit he sure not talking about
[1:17:33] Darwin's theory of evolution but it's
[1:17:37] it's the evolving it's the bringing
[1:17:39] forth and I'm here to tell you that God

[1:19:10] amen this is a very interesting
[1:19:14] quotation I was actually over in the
[1:19:16] Congo in a u one of our Distributors
[1:19:19] over there uh shared this quote with me
[1:19:22] as we was flying from deep into the
[1:19:24] Congo back into canasa many years ago
[1:19:28] but uh I'd never noticed it before
[1:19:30] listen to this it's very important and
[1:19:33] you can use any quote you want to to
[1:19:35] project the wrong thing but if we have
[1:19:38] the right revelation we know it will
[1:19:40] always bring glory to Jesus Christ is
[1:19:42] that right all right blessed
[1:19:48] Lord we could stay like those who stood
[1:19:51] on the mount that day and said it's good
[1:19:54] for us to be
[1:19:56] here and we would to build three
[1:20:00] Tabernacles put Pastors in
[1:20:03] each but the voice quickly turned and
[1:20:05] said hear ye him he's my
[1:20:11] son now let us turn from
[1:20:14] pastors from the Moses and the
[1:20:17] Elijah and from the great man of the
[1:20:19] earth although we're thankful for all of
[1:20:21] them but you said first the year
[1:20:25] him amen his word said this not the
[1:20:29] pastor's word neither the
[1:20:31] Evangelist whatsoever things you desire
[1:20:34] When you pray believe you receive
[1:20:37] them you shall have them if you should
[1:20:40] say to this mountain be
[1:20:42] moved be cast into the sea and don't
[1:20:45] doubt in your
[1:20:47] heart but believe that what you say
[1:20:50] shall come to pass you shall have what
[1:20:53] you say not necessarily would it be
[1:20:56] momentarily neither was it momentarily
[1:20:58] with
[1:20:59] Abraham
[1:21:01] Sarah but you said if you believe that
[1:21:05] what you say shall come to
[1:21:08] pass you shall have what you say
[1:21:12] Amen you believe that now I want you to
[1:21:16] notice something in
[1:21:18] here and how many believes that brother
[1:21:21] Brenham was the Elijah that God promised
[1:21:23] to send to this day fulfilling Malachi 4
[1:21:26] you really believe
[1:21:28] that and um Revelation 10:7 Etc we
[1:21:32] believe that sure but notice here oh
[1:21:37] my notice notice
[1:21:40] here such
[1:21:43] humility and and and he's putting the
[1:21:47] Holy Spirit through the prophet is
[1:21:49] putting the emphasis where the emphasis
[1:21:51] needs to be and we're going to come to
[1:21:53] that in the next
[1:21:55] quotation but notice right so there's
[1:21:58] something here that I'd like to
[1:22:00] emphasize tonight the Divine evidence of
[1:22:04] the Divine holy spirit is the ability to
[1:22:08] hear
[1:22:09] him okay hear ye him hear ye him now
[1:22:15] notice here brother bradam has been
[1:22:18] preaching about this subject on this
[1:22:20] particular tape that we're just now
[1:22:22] listening to or just listen to he he's
[1:22:24] been speaking on uh the mount
[1:22:27] Transfiguration
[1:22:30] experience and he also in another place
[1:22:32] said that every Christian ought to have
[1:22:34] a mount Transfiguration
[1:22:37] experience
[1:22:39] amen hallelujah and so when you have a
[1:22:43] true Mount Transfiguration experience
[1:22:46] you'll be coming down from that mountain
[1:22:47] saying hear ye
[1:22:51] him Hallelujah
[1:22:54] and you'll be pointing to
[1:22:57] him notice here Peter the man with the
[1:23:00] Keys of the Kingdom but before he got
[1:23:02] the baptism the Holy Ghost on the day of
[1:23:04] Pentecost
[1:23:06] see when he came
[1:23:08] down after being overshadowed by the
[1:23:11] cloud you know they're in the presence
[1:23:13] of Jesus but if you study uh Matthew
[1:23:17] Mark and also Luke has a different a
[1:23:20] little bit different uh rendition of
[1:23:22] this event study him all together
[1:23:25] sometime very interesting and uh Moses
[1:23:29] and Elijah was actually ministering to
[1:23:31] Jesus Christ there on that
[1:23:33] mountain pertaining to what he would
[1:23:36] accomplish in his death amen and so uh
[1:23:41] but nonetheless we see that while Peter
[1:23:44] was asleep the Bible says not knowing
[1:23:47] what he was saying he was kind of coming
[1:23:49] out of his sleep and and they were heavy
[1:23:51] with
[1:23:52] sleep the most important events Jesus
[1:23:55] suffered more in Gethsemane than he did
[1:23:57] on Calvary and when he was trying to get
[1:24:00] the people to stay awake and pray with
[1:24:02] him can't you wait one hour can't you
[1:24:04] pray one hour with
[1:24:05] me carry with me one
[1:24:08] hour and he come back and find him
[1:24:14] asleep oh it's time to shake ourselves
[1:24:16] folks I'm preaching to myself when I got
[1:24:18] my finger pointed out you I got three
[1:24:20] more pointing back at me it's time to
[1:24:21] wake up wake up
[1:24:25] asleep all of the
[1:24:28] church even the inner circle of Peter
[1:24:31] James and John which had went a little
[1:24:33] bit further in the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:24:34] went to sleep on
[1:24:37] Jesus at the most important time where
[1:24:40] he suffered more in Gethsemane than he
[1:24:41] did on Calvary and then here the most
[1:24:44] important event of the Transfiguration
[1:24:46] they were still
[1:24:47] asleep search the scriptures and you'll
[1:24:50] find that they were
[1:24:51] asleep and Peter then come out of the
[1:24:54] sleep kind of a little bit you know and
[1:24:55] they see this the cloud overshadowing
[1:24:58] and the voice speaking Etc but Peter got
[1:25:03] out of
[1:25:05] order Peter broke Church order on Mount
[1:25:11] Transfiguration he sure
[1:25:13] did and while Peter yet spake God spake
[1:25:16] now who was out of order Peter or God
[1:25:19] God don't
[1:25:20] interrupt God don't get out of order
[1:25:23] while Peter yet was speaking the Bible
[1:25:25] says God
[1:25:29] spoke God didn't get out of order Peter
[1:25:32] didn't know what he was saying the Bible
[1:25:34] says not knowing what he was
[1:25:37] saying let us build what was he saying
[1:25:40] let us build
[1:25:42] churches Jesus never commissioned
[1:25:44] anybody to build a
[1:25:48] church I know that might go down
[1:25:51] Crossways but it's still good for you
[1:25:52] swaller it
[1:25:55] I said Jesus said and the prophet of God
[1:25:58] reminded us of the fact that Jesus never
[1:26:00] did commission anybody to build a
[1:26:02] church you say brother
[1:26:05] Hughes
[1:26:07] well yeah we've got a nice church and I
[1:26:09] help build it and I've helped build
[1:26:11] several churches amen but that's not the
[1:26:13] main
[1:26:14] commission thank God for the church amen
[1:26:18] thank God for the churches brother
[1:26:19] Brandon built one amen and they and they
[1:26:23] built another and they they they renewed
[1:26:25] it and expanded it sure and he helped
[1:26:28] dedicate many churches but that was not
[1:26:31] the main
[1:26:35] commission G to say something stay with
[1:26:40] me see the main commission is preach the
[1:26:44] gospel power and demonstration as well
[1:26:46] as voice Amen Let God do that part
[1:26:50] whenever you do your part God will take
[1:26:51] care of the rest Jesus never did stress
[1:26:55] the works as much as he did the word
[1:26:57] because he knew if the church would get
[1:26:59] the word The Works would automatically
[1:27:01] follow the word demonstrates
[1:27:04] itself the signs automatically follow
[1:27:07] don't push the signs ahead right these
[1:27:10] signs shall follow don't try to push the
[1:27:13] signs ahead as the
[1:27:15] evidence no no no see
[1:27:24] gifts is
[1:27:25] wonderful but where there's gifts
[1:27:28] prophecy Etc they'll fail but perfect
[1:27:31] love will never fail and this perfect
[1:27:33] word will never fail is that right amen
[1:27:38] oh my that's one of the quotes here but
[1:27:41] here uh I want you to see how
[1:27:46] that he's saying let us turn now here he
[1:27:50] is knowing that his own office as an
[1:27:52] Elijah but let us turn from the elijas
[1:27:56] let us turn from the pastors and the
[1:27:58] Great Men of the earth oh how we'd like
[1:28:01] to build a tabernacle and put Pastors in
[1:28:03] each one of them he
[1:28:07] said
[1:28:09] amen oh yes and we've done that we've
[1:28:13] done that down through the years down
[1:28:15] through the decades we've did that build
[1:28:18] churches and put Pastors in them and
[1:28:20] thank God for the pastor now don't get
[1:28:22] in your mind or don't let the devil put
[1:28:24] a seed in your mind to think I'm against
[1:28:26] the true Pastor no no I'm for the true
[1:28:29] Pastor I'm for the True Church of the
[1:28:31] Living God but the main emphasis is what
[1:28:34] I want you to
[1:28:36] see let us turn from the Great Men of
[1:28:39] the earth as much as we appreciate them
[1:28:42] because you said hear ye
[1:28:45] him
[1:28:46] Hallelujah the main emphasis must be on
[1:28:49] the word of God because that is your
[1:28:52] evidence the main emphasis must be on
[1:28:56] the voice of God for your day the word
[1:28:59] the message for your day it takes the
[1:29:02] seed the message of the day to Quicken
[1:29:04] the predestinated seed of the
[1:29:06] day it takes the light the revelation of
[1:29:10] the message of your day to Quicken your
[1:29:14] seed to bring that seed to full maturity
[1:29:17] and to fruition and that's where that's
[1:29:20] what we're looking for is fruition and
[1:29:23] and trans
[1:29:25] ation oh God help
[1:29:27] us amen so here are some gifts you may
[1:29:32] have even got him a
[1:29:33] gift and uh he might have got you a
[1:29:36] Cadillac or a gold diamond ring who
[1:29:40] knows what he might have gotten you just
[1:29:42] to get your
[1:29:44] attention
[1:29:46] gifts gifts are
[1:29:49] wonderful but whenever it comes right
[1:29:52] down to the marriage on the day of the
[1:29:56] wedding that husband that bridegroom
[1:29:58] does not want you looking at the
[1:30:00] Cadillac and the and and all the other
[1:30:02] things and the gifts the main emphasis
[1:30:05] on the day of the wedding should be on
[1:30:07] The Giver of the
[1:30:12] gifts I said the main emphasis is not on
[1:30:15] the
[1:30:17] gifts the main emphasis is on him here
[1:30:20] ye him The Giver of all gifts right
[1:30:24] Satan was gifted he was so gifted he was
[1:30:28] co-equal with God in every respect
[1:30:30] except to be able to create
[1:30:33] Lucifer in
[1:30:36] heaven yes go listen to marriage and
[1:30:39] divorce if you don't believe it co-equal
[1:30:41] with God in every respect except to be
[1:30:43] able to create and he had all his power
[1:30:46] and wisdom and knowledge and uh he knew
[1:30:48] what pleased God he had perfect Church
[1:30:50] order and and he was leader of worship
[1:30:53] in the church Church
[1:30:56] Etc and he didn't lose any of that when
[1:30:58] he was cast out he kept all of his
[1:31:01] wisdom kept all his his gifts the gifts
[1:31:04] and callings of God are without
[1:31:05] repentance God will never take the gift
[1:31:07] away from you you don't repent for giv
[1:31:10] it to you he knew what you was going to
[1:31:11] do with it before he gave it to you you
[1:31:14] didn't have to repent to get
[1:31:18] it so don't depend on your gifts to
[1:31:21] justify
[1:31:22] yourself and don't depend in this church
[1:31:26] may you never look to manifestations of
[1:31:28] the spirit of God as your
[1:31:30] evidence Judas can produce Judas did
[1:31:34] produce all the different
[1:31:36] manifestations and the scripture says
[1:31:39] have we not cast out devils in thy name
[1:31:41] have we not done many great wonderful
[1:31:42] Works in thy name Jesus didn't deny that
[1:31:45] they hadn't done
[1:31:47] that amen let me tell you
[1:31:50] something the 70 were gifted
[1:31:54] they were Anointed with the message of
[1:31:56] the hour by the messenger of the
[1:31:59] hour e ordained ministers and 71 of them
[1:32:06] left the word only 11 stayed with the
[1:32:10] truth and the message of the
[1:32:12] hour it's a
[1:32:15] repeat I said it's a
[1:32:19] repeat that's not an easy thing it's
[1:32:21] certainly not a popular thing for a
[1:32:23] preacher to
[1:32:29] say but let me tell you something it has
[1:32:32] to be a repeat because the prophet of
[1:32:35] God taught it and he said the anointed
[1:32:38] ones of the end time would be so close
[1:32:41] that it would deceive the very elected
[1:32:42] if
[1:32:44] possible see is so very very close come
[1:32:47] preaching the M Judas had a knowledge of
[1:32:49] the Mysteries the prophet taught
[1:32:51] us oh yeah and in the message anointed
[1:32:54] ones the end time brother B said these
[1:32:55] anointed ones could not come forth until
[1:32:57] after the seals was opened so they have
[1:33:00] they're right in the message of the
[1:33:01] houry and handling the word of God
[1:33:04] deceitfully for their own benefit for
[1:33:07] their own gain building their own
[1:33:09] kingdom instead of building the kingdom
[1:33:10] of God Allelujah pointing to their own
[1:33:13] selves pointing to their own church
[1:33:15] instead of pointing to him here ye
[1:33:19] him oh my now we may have to build a
[1:33:23] church
[1:33:24] amen because we only got about six
[1:33:27] months over here left in this particular
[1:33:29] area we may have to and hey let's roll
[1:33:32] up our sleeves and go to It Whatever It
[1:33:35] Takes amen or or what however the Lord
[1:33:39] will provide don't be don't let nothing
[1:33:41] shake your faith Amen in god let's just
[1:33:44] go forward so we're not against churches
[1:33:47] and we're Ser God is how would God
[1:33:50] listen in in the same book here Paul
[1:33:53] Paul confirmed that these gifts were
[1:33:56] placed in the church and he confirmed
[1:33:58] that they were to they they the the in
[1:34:01] aable right to the church the gifts are
[1:34:04] God will never take a gift back that he
[1:34:07] gives amen it's the church's inalienable
[1:34:10] right the gifts not only the nine
[1:34:14] spiritual gifts but the five Ministry
[1:34:16] gifts are ordained of God and Paul
[1:34:19] confirmed that they were to remain in
[1:34:21] the church until the coming of the Lord
[1:34:24] so the gifts are part of God's program
[1:34:27] Apostles prophets evangelists pastors
[1:34:30] and teachers are part of God's program
[1:34:32] they're God's dress Weare God hides
[1:34:34] himself and uses himself dresses himself
[1:34:37] in his ministry and they were given for
[1:34:40] the perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:34:42] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:34:44] the body of Christ
[1:34:47] till we all come to the unity of the
[1:34:50] faith amen and to the knowledge of the
[1:34:53] Son of God the statue of a perfect man
[1:34:55] and so forth and they're to remain in
[1:34:58] the church then amen till the coming of
[1:35:01] the Lord absolutely all right so don't
[1:35:04] get your thought that to think that
[1:35:06] brother Hugh is against the true
[1:35:07] five-fold Ministry but what I'm trying
[1:35:09] to emphasize here is the fact that if
[1:35:12] you put more emphasis on the gifts than
[1:35:14] you do the giver you're out of order
[1:35:17] especially in this hour when the wedding
[1:35:19] is come the marriage has come
[1:35:25] the Divine
[1:35:26] Romance is coming to its
[1:35:29] culmination this is the bride hath made
[1:35:32] herself ready this is the U the
[1:35:35] invisible Union of Christ and his bride
[1:35:39] it's here now it come right through this
[1:35:41] ministry the invisible Union amen is is
[1:35:45] here now the marriage is not uh in the
[1:35:48] future the marriage is here now and we
[1:35:52] only go to the wedding supper the
[1:35:54] prophet said in the message proving his
[1:35:56] word take notes write it down go listen
[1:35:59] to it he said we go to the wedding
[1:36:01] supper not the
[1:36:04] marriage we're United
[1:36:08] here
[1:36:11] hallelujah oh my that's pretty strong
[1:36:14] but it's the truth amen let's go
[1:36:17] forward uh and remember I I don't want
[1:36:20] to lose track of of of the time I have
[1:36:24] uh how many will give me 10 more
[1:36:27] minutes 10 20 30 40 50 60 oh my I can
[1:36:32] preach an hour put all those tens
[1:36:34] together okay but we want to
[1:36:37] consider
[1:36:40] uh we want to
[1:36:43] consider our time so you pray for me
[1:36:47] let's go forward
[1:36:56] here we go Church age
[1:37:01] book and uh I'll try to wrap it up after
[1:37:04] this okay we only go so far uh if I
[1:37:08] preach everything I knew tonight well
[1:37:10] you you wish you wouldn't be no need of
[1:37:12] me coming back would there you sure you
[1:37:14] wouldn't want me to come
[1:37:17] back all right watch this watch this
[1:37:19] outstanding quotation real closely now
[1:37:21] Church AGS book
[1:37:24] and uh I'll just read this because uh as
[1:37:27] we go
[1:37:28] forward now now we can see
[1:37:31] Jesus Christ is revealing himself
[1:37:34] Through the Ages by his Spirit In The
[1:37:38] Messengers okay they are as Moses was to
[1:37:43] the children of
[1:37:44] Israel as he had the Revelation for his
[1:37:47] day so each messenger had God's
[1:37:50] revelation and Ministry for that day
[1:37:53] thus when we see that the messengers are
[1:37:56] in his hand we see the Lord identifying
[1:38:00] himself with these men granting them his
[1:38:04] power it is not
[1:38:08] enough it is not
[1:38:11] enough okay everybody awake say Amen am
[1:38:15] it is not enough that he has Associated
[1:38:19] himself with the whole church which we
[1:38:21] saw when he was seen standing amongst
[1:38:24] the seven golden lampstands nor is it
[1:38:27] even
[1:38:30] enough are you awake nor is it even
[1:38:34] enough that we see the five-fold
[1:38:36] ministry of Ephesians 4 Apostles
[1:38:40] prophets teachers evangelists and
[1:38:43] pastors that's not enough that's not
[1:38:45] even
[1:38:47] enough okay what is enough brother
[1:38:49] Hughes what is enough brother
[1:38:52] brandom we got to have enough we got to
[1:38:55] have enough to get out of here we got to
[1:38:57] have enough for a
[1:38:59] translation stay with me
[1:39:04] now okay for in each age the church goes
[1:39:10] astray in each age where it's the bride
[1:39:14] age the wheed age the in in every age
[1:39:20] the Ephesian age the lean age in AG the
[1:39:24] church goes
[1:39:27] astray and it's not just the
[1:39:30] [Music]
[1:39:32] leoty but the clergy group what you mean
[1:39:37] preachers can be
[1:39:39] wrong shepherds are wrong as well as
[1:39:44] sheep somebody ought to say Amen
[1:39:53] then what happens what is enough brother
[1:39:56] brandom then Capital God God brings
[1:40:01] himself on the
[1:40:03] scene as the chief Shepherd in the
[1:40:06] ministries of these seven men to lead
[1:40:10] his people back to the truth and to the
[1:40:12] Abundant power of that truth God is in
[1:40:15] his people all of his people for If any
[1:40:19] man has not the spirit of Christ he is
[1:40:21] none of his and he is the word that
[1:40:25] would be the word recognized in the
[1:40:27] people but he has placed a special

[1:48:42] never try to tell the pastor what to do
[1:48:44] and the pastors never tried to tell the
