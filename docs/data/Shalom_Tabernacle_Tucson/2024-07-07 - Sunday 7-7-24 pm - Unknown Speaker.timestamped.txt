[37:48] Lord is placed upon our hearts may you
[37:51] bless
[37:53] uh what we hear Lord and father
[37:58] we truly want to draw closer to you as
[38:01] our prayer as
[38:03] we hear of another Soldier that's gone
[38:06] on good friend of mine after the Sunday
[38:10] morning service today he was called home
[38:13] just like that young man and father

[38:21] by one and father we just want our lives
[38:23] and our Deeds to be pleasing in your

[38:30] you are pleased with what we're doing
[38:33] help us father to focus on that and let
[38:36] that be our motivation we pray in Jesus
[38:39] name amen God bless you well I had on my
[38:44] heart it came to me to um play this
[38:47] little movie of John hust I think many
[38:50] of us have saw it before and heard it
[38:52] before but I was
[38:55] yesterday uh preparing after the prayer
[38:57] meeting I went and got this book John
[39:01] hus it it was actually brother Carl
[39:04] Wheeler's book it was a load of books I
[39:08] like brother Mam's work and there's some
[39:10] other books and it's been in this safe
[39:12] for some quite some time and I was just
[39:14] straighten some things up so I picked it
[39:15] up and I started looking through it
[39:19] yesterday and um to the day he was
[39:23] burned at the Stak on July the 6 and
[39:27] that really struck me that I you know
[39:29] all that time that I looked through
[39:31] there and so I wanted to read a
[39:33] scripture July the 6 19
[39:37] 14 uh or 1415 he was burned to the stake
[39:41] there um 600 years ago 609
[39:46] years and I wanted us to take a
[39:49] scripture and read just before we go
[39:51] there I ask you to stand the turn in
[39:53] Hebrews chapter 11 and Revelations
[39:55] chapter 2
[40:01] and just the the life of this great uh
[40:05] Saint and as I was reading through the
[40:07] book really really interesting it's an
[40:08] old one very old book it's published in
[40:11] 1915 so 500 years after his uh martyr he
[40:17] was burned at the stake as a heretic
[40:19] there in constant the constant Council
[40:23] burned him at the stake there in Bohemia
[40:25] in the Czech Republic
[40:28] um it is um quite striking
[40:34] how in Hebrews 11 it speaks of these
[40:38] great
[40:40] soldiers Heroes of the faith I believe
[40:42] brother random calls them and I like to
[40:45] read there in verse number 32 and what
[40:50] shall I more say for the time would fail
[40:53] me to tell of Gideon and Barack and
[40:57] Samson and jeffa David also and Samuel
[41:00] and other prophets who through faith
[41:03] subdued kingdoms rot righteousness
[41:07] obtained promises stopped the mouths of
[41:10] lions quenched the violence of fire
[41:13] escaped the edge of the sword out of
[41:15] weakness were made strong wax Valiant in
[41:19] fight turned to flight the armies of the
[41:21] aliens women received their dead raised
[41:24] to life again others were tortur not
[41:28] accepting Deliverance that they might
[41:30] obtain a better resurrection and of
[41:33] others had trial of cruel mockings and
[41:36] scourgings yay moreover of bonds and
[41:41] imprisonment there were ston they were
[41:43] saw asunder they were tempted slain with
[41:47] the sword they wandered about in sheep
[41:49] skins and goat skins being T destitute
[41:52] Afflicted and tormented of whom the
[41:55] world was not worthy
[41:57] they wandered in deserts and in
[41:59] mountains and in dens and in caves of
[42:01] the earth and these all having obtain a
[42:05] good report through faith receive not
[42:08] the promise God having provided some
[42:11] better thing for us that they without us
[42:13] should not be made perfect
[42:16] amen think of that Revelations chapter 2
[42:20] to the saman church
[42:25] age and verse number eight and unto the
[42:29] angel of the church and Smyrna
[42:31] right these things saith the first and
[42:34] the last which was dead and is alive I
[42:37] Know Thy Works in Tribulation and
[42:40] poverty but Thou Art rich and I know the
[42:43] blasphemy of them which say they are
[42:45] Jews and are not but are the synagogue
[42:49] of Satan fear none of those things which
[42:52] Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall
[42:55] cast some of you into prison that ye may
[42:59] be tried and ye shall have tribulation
[43:02] 10 days be thou faithful unto death and
[43:06] I will give thee a crown of
[43:09] life amen may God add a blessing to the
[43:11] reading of his word you may be seated
[43:13] just for a
[43:15] moment you know this
[43:17] great um
[43:19] soldiers that were Martyrs and I I
[43:23] thought it was something how the Lord
[43:25] just led me to you know to pick up this
[43:28] book and see the life of this great
[43:30] Saint and soldier that was burned at the
[43:34] stake there and then thinking and going
[43:37] deeper into the research there were many
[43:40] that were of his same belief they just
[43:44] didn't have the strength to take that
[43:47] stand many turned When Death was placed
[43:52] to them you know they tried to get him
[43:55] he was in prison for many days this
[43:57] Soldier this saint of the Lord um John
[44:00] hus he was a priest and as the Lord was
[44:02] opening his eyes to truth he began to
[44:05] preach that and he preached it to the
[44:08] people and it started to reach the
[44:10] Common People the prostitutes even the
[44:14] queen there and many of the his his
[44:18] sermons reached outside of the church
[44:21] walls it started to grow and he started
[44:24] to minister into the people's language
[44:27] and as God began to deal with him and
[44:29] work with him you know the enemy put
[44:32] pressure they arrested him false charges
[44:36] were raised against him and he sat in
[44:38] this prison for many days his friends
[44:42] came to him and asked him to recant many
[44:45] times because what good are you dead
[44:50] when you can be alive to preach the
[44:52] gospel and the good
[44:53] news and the enemy many times he thinks
[44:56] that setting John on fire that that
[44:59] would put it out but what it happens is
[45:01] not only did he set John on fire he set
[45:05] the movement on fire it
[45:08] spreads and they try to wipe this man's
[45:11] memory out of the mind of the people
[45:12] they burned his ashes took his ashes
[45:15] every scrap of it and threw it in the
[45:17] river so the people couldn't have a
[45:19] relic to follow him but that just
[45:21] impressed in their Memories the more and
[45:25] so your life speaks even if you leave
[45:29] from here and that's the power of what
[45:32] we stand for and what we believe and I
[45:34] was thinking about the character of the
[45:35] men what kind of man am I in that
[45:38] climate all your friends all the others
[45:41] are going this way and here's the
[45:42] pressure on the new found truth am I
[45:46] able to stand I sure hope I'm able to I
[45:50] sure believe I'm able to and I certainly
[45:53] want God to give me that Grace and Faith
[45:55] to stand I want to read in the message
[45:58] it's in the smin church age book I'm
[46:02] going to take my time so don't rush me
[46:04] okay I'm going to take this Merin Church
[46:07] age book and read this and this as
[46:11] brother random takes this scripture in
[46:13] Revelations chapter 2 and and he uh
[46:18] begins to uh show the relationship
[46:22] between those that strive daily and
[46:25] those that actually are Martyrs that
[46:27] will give their life some of us actually
[46:31] may have to give our lives blood we
[46:33] don't think of it that way but it's
[46:35] still the truth and um it's just a
[46:38] matter just like that it can happen come
[46:41] in here arrest us for something we said
[46:44] and then a lie then a false witness and
[46:47] before you know
[46:49] it um things can change quite quickly
[46:53] I'll take this um in the spurn and
[46:56] Church age paragraph number uh it's not
[46:59] a paragraph that you would have but I'll
[47:02] start reading it says Thou shalt have
[47:04] tribulation 10 days in the church age
[47:07] book here is a prophecy and with it is a
[47:11] means of determining the lifespan of the
[47:13] saman age
[47:16] Dian the cruelest of all Emperors
[47:19] launched a terror campaign against the
[47:22] Saints of God that except for the mercy
[47:25] of God would have wiped out all
[47:27] Believers it was the bloodiest in
[47:29] history and lasted 10 years the 10 days
[47:34] Revelations chapter 2 verse 10 from 302
[47:38] to 312 be thou faithful unto death he
[47:42] does not say be faithful until death but
[47:47] unto death you may have to seal your
[47:50] testimony with your blood thousands yeah
[47:54] Millions have died during all the ages
[47:58] they died in the faith like Antipas the
[48:02] faithful marterer that held not their
[48:04] lives dear unto death often we think
[48:08] that it would be almost impossible to be
[48:10] a martyr but dare to recall that the
[48:13] faith we daily use to Triumph in Christ
[48:16] Jesus is the same faith that upholds the
[48:20] polyc carps and all the martyrs the
[48:24] Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace
[48:27] for the Supreme hour blessed be God
[48:30] forever and I will give thee a crown of
[48:33] life since not even a cup of cold water
[48:36] given in the name of the Lord fails to
[48:39] receive a reward how great shall be the
[48:42] reward to him who gives his life as a
[48:46] martyr for the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:50] perhaps we can get a small idea if we
[48:53] compare this crown with the crown one in
[48:55] a race know ye not that they which run
[48:58] in a race run all but one receiveth the
[49:01] prize so run that you may obtain 1
[49:05] Corinthians
[49:06] 9:24 a crown given to the winner of the
[49:09] Olympic race was a Garland of olive
[49:12] branches but the crown spoken of here in
[49:16] the Revelation given to a martyr is the
[49:19] crown of
[49:20] royalty Jesus calls it the Crown of Life
[49:24] The One Crown is for those who have
[49:27] striven the other is for those who have
[49:30] given both crowns are Incorruptible they
[49:34] will not perish the winners of the
[49:37] worldly race of life will soon lose the
[49:39] joy of the plotts of the world their
[49:42] Glory will fail but those who give their
[49:45] lives for God either by daily striving
[49:49] or shedding their blood as the crowning
[49:52] sacrifice of their lives will be given
[49:55] the Crown of Life
[49:57] all too little time is spent on laboring
[50:01] for the Eternal rewards of God the
[50:04] recompense of God is too lightly
[50:06] esteemed if we believe in the reality of
[50:09] the resurrection of the body and an
[50:12] eternal Kingdom of substance then we
[50:14] ought to lay up in heaven those good
[50:17] Treasures that are available to the
[50:20] thankful Saints amen amen thank God for
[50:23] his word and uh we'll go to that turn
[50:27] the lights and I trust this will be a
[50:30] blessing a blessing to all of you
[50:34] amen amen our life is a life that we
[50:37] live daily for him amen God bless
[50:41] [Music]
[50:46] you the 15th century marked the turning
