glad to be in the house of the Lord with you tonight we trust that the Lord will bless you we welcome each of you to the house of the Lord and we always counter the privilege to gather in his name amen are you happy to be here all right good so we like to go right into the word just for a moment we have a tape we're going to play for you but before we do from the last few uh Wednesdays we started back in um February the last Saturday in February or last Wednesday in feu January the 24th and then January 31st February 7th we did we started conduct order and Doctrine and we've been on the conduct portion and we just want to read a few places from the message just before we go into um the tape tonight amen there's a scripture in Hebrews chapter 10 we' like to turn there and Hebrews chapter 2 good nice to see you brother Nathaniel and your daughter there Aliana and each of you amen when you get those scriptures you can say amen amen Hebrews chapter 10 verse number 24 and 25 it says let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as we see the day approaching amen Hebrews chapter 2: 1 three therefore we ought to give the most Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience receive the just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him amen may God add a blessing to the reading of his word let us just pray Lord Jesus we ask that you would come now and speak to every heart that's gathered father you know exactly what we have need of and we believe your word is true when you said that you would be in our midst if we would Gather in your name we come gathered in your name now we ask your blessings now in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated thank you musicians thank you bless you um we have a few announcements and we'll get into those when we do our prayer requests so the purpose of these uh few little lessons they're they're very simple they're we call the ABCs but they have been very beneficial to us here I've had several comments on um just these 45 minutes left lessons or or segments that we've done on conduct order and Doctrine and we're just on the conduct we're just dealing with the conduct we'll get into the order how things are placed in order and then we'll get into that all these things are surrounded by a Doctrine out of the word and the first time we got together we showed you in the scriptures Luke chapter 14 us and the army of the Living God we're soldiers and this word this preaching this teaching is for the purpose of equipping the soldier it's to make pillars not just church members every church has those pillars those Believers that are steadfast they're unmovable they're going to be there through the thick and the thin you can count on their presence and um Jesus said that there's a promise that if we would Gather in his name he would be there so that's a promise and Hebrews chapter 10 that we read for you is a um it's a an admonition it's a Commandment that we don't forsake the assembling of ourselves together and what Leo deia has done for us and done to us we make the excuse that our Ox was in the ditch and I'd like you to examine that Ox just a little bit and what that responsibility is and what Jesus talked about there's a difference between you not being able to come and then you not deciding to come when the Believers gather together so let's make that very clear if you can't come of course we know it's not God's intention for you to be at every single service and somehow um your attendance will be a record on the other side maybe there will be I don't know but but I I can't see that that is you know a Salvation issue but but for us that come and gather in his name the single greatest outward appearance of God dealing with a young man or a young woman or old man or young old woman a newcomer is their attendance when they come to church and you see them at the prayer meeting and you see them coming Sunday morning consistently then we can say God is dealing with them that's just an outward I want you to get that very clear we're not saying that God is not dealing with people because they're not coming to church but for those of us who are are part of a body of Christ and we have to make things move and we have to open the doors and some people have to get a key some people have to be a part of an office have to be able to handle the word and teach you're not going to give those responsible responsibilities to people who are not here very clear and so to me that's one of the greatest singular outward expressions of spirituality or go or an importance to an individual's life and their heart is their attendance and we find this promised right in this word brother random deals with this terminology the post our post of Duty he says it many times he says um that your church is your post of Duty you know you have your other places that you want to go to and he deals with that and we read the quotations on that for you he deals with the sin of omission and I think and I would categorize forsaking the assembling of yourself with the omitting the Omission the not the things that you did it's the things that you didn't do so you omit to come together as the body of Believers have been called to come together remember we're not serving a location we're not serving a church or Pastor we're serving the lord and our attitude towards his word is our attitude towards him and so it's not about you know brother Israel those quotes make me feel guilty so I'll try to straighten up for a few weeks the quotes are not put together to make you feel guilty for a few weeks but it deals with the condition of your heart the word of God is there for the conditions of your heart and and it it will expose it will expose that you know we come together we're not perfect we come together we bump against each other there's things that happen and we got to say sorry we got to say oops we say it's my fault can I give you can you give me a second chance that's on purpose God designs that you know like Lord just make me perfect like boom and and if that was God's intention for you just to be perfect no scratches no bruises then when you gave your heart to the Lord as a Christian he should have just Zapped you out of here because you're ready for heaven right no you got work to do you got work to I got work to do I got to live this out so I want to take any more time on that and uh but I wanted to read this one quote and brother rold kind of opens this up in as he was talking about uh the post of Duty and he I read this for you and this really stood out to me because I've I've driven I've been around and all the churches I've been to typically the least attended services are the Wednesday night there's a Wednesday night crowd uh the Sunday night you'll see a break and the communion crowd and we know that that that's true we've we've seen that over the years how many you know what I'm saying this true all right so easier to stay home on a Wednesday sure Sunday it's almost like our duty and we feel so guilty just staying home just straight up staying home but Wednesday is like man surely I can take a Wednesday off right did I tell you to touch your neighbor yet okay we won't mess with you tonight all right so in this message here the Seal of Christ 1955 paragraph 38 I'm just going to read this quote and then we'll go right to the tape paragraph 38 1955 the Seal of Christ brother randam says this here just that my organ ganization I become the chief presor next year and maybe I'll be a district man or something that's all the preacher about cares about anymore come on preacher we're going to take it with them that's right oh my pulling feathers in the Hat and so forth when we ought to be on our knees crying for the sins and the Abomination and the disgrace that's done into the city we see seem to be so unconcerned about the Lost amen amen that's right you know that's the truth unconcerned about the Lost just so our church makes it so we have the greatest congregation Sunday all stay home Sunday night and look at the television today I was in one of the biggest churches in the city one of the member said we have 3,000 people here on Sunday morning Sunday night Sunday night we don't have half of it look what brother bam says they all come to church to do their religion and go back home look at the television take a little ride out in the country why it's a disgrace it shows there's something lacking in the heart amen so you know it sounds not I mean what's wrong about taking a ride in the country what's wrong with you know having a little family time on a Sunday afternoon well if the church doors are open and you forsake that I would classify that under the Omission the sin of omission and really this is about the matters of the heart brother branon makes a statement that if you are God is in your heart you you can't wait for those doors to open well I know as a kid I couldn't wait for the church service to close it seemed like because I had other things I want to run with my boys you know little kid raising Church you want to run and get on the drum set and after service run up and down and chitchat with this one and that one and play and go get something to eat but you know that's what a little kid thinks what about we us men us Brothers US soldiers God is trying to make pillars out of us and this last day group this last day laziness this Leo deia spirit that gets on all of us to just set back and just take it easy the scripture specifically tells us to awake to watch and pray and if there ever was an increase of service times of people Gathering Together prayer meetings that that's that's what should be taking place today our prayer meeting should be increasing more to the Saints coming to the house of the Lord for these things but we've seen just the opposite and it would make it easier maybe if we just had one service on Sunday one long service right how many wants that you know that's a trap huh we would just take a break one service Sunday then we get off Sunday afternoon what do you think you're going to do that Sunday afternoon you're not going to sit home and twidle your thumbs you'll find something to do shopping carousing you'll do whatever Le oia is doing eating carousing and all those things and so we're so glad we have a pattern that was laid for us some people can't have two services on Sunday that's not what we're talking about some people have their you know their Church order their church services the way they're conducted we're not talking about that we're we're talking about your church that is your postive duty then you don't want to forsake that amen amen God bless you so let's go to this message it's the message why Christ speak brother random preached it twice the first time he spoke it was here in Indiana and so let's stand and sing that old Hymn of the church only believe and we'll get the main part of that message there's a prayer line to it we won't get to the prayer line but we'll we'll get to this portion of the word he's going to be taking this scripture reading out of Exodus amen so let's sing that only believe singing on really only really all things are possible [Music] only be only be only believe all things are possible oh can we lift our hands and say Lord I believe sing it to him Lord I believe Lord I believe that all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible all Lord I let's just remain standing and we'll take um move down to paragraph number 11 sis and if you want to read along it's in Exodus chapter 23 and after the scripture is read then we can be seated God bless you now God is not going to hold a man responsible for because he's a sinner because he was born a sinner but what God's go to hold a man responsible for is because that he remains a sinner he don't have to remain a sinner for there is a provision made for his justification through Jesus Christ amen so we are trusting tonight if there be some Insider out who has not yet accepted Christ that this will be the night that something will be said or done that will wake you up to the the place that you know you need Christ and then if you just accepted him as your personal Savior and have not yet received the Holy Ghost I trust that tonight you will receive it I see some of the Tabernacle folks here I'm going to say this about the big sister one thing that the Tabernacle needs up there at our church at the Tabernacle Jeff is a rededication and a refilling of the Holy Ghost amen right uh everyone to get down to the Altar and pray until they get a renewing of the Holy Ghost the whole church be filled with the power of God that's what we need not only the Tabernacle there but the body of Christ Universal it needs a refilling I like David said one day restore to me the joy of my salvation now he had not lost his salvation but the Joy of it and when it comes to a place that I can't enjoy my religion my salvation there's something wrong somewhere because it is joy unspeakable and full of Glory one of them said taste and see the Lord is good it tastes like Honey in the Rock oh I'm so glad that I have tasted that amen the Lord is good and I love honey but I never tasted any like that that's the best that I know now we're going to hurry right into the service and see if we can let the church out early so the people can go to their places and of worship or work tomorrow in their homes and now we are anticipating a great meeting out on the west coast right away and we are asking and soliciting the prayers of this church and all these people to pray for me this morning there was something happened I've never went Harley to a little church unless God specially done something for me I just love that and this morning after I'd gotten through preaching perfectly in order the Holy Spirit fell among us and gave a message to brother Jackson that has just stuck with me all afternoon frankly I'm getting the tape so I can play it over and over I can get it for recently I've been feeling my wife here knows I've been telling her that the Lord was going to visit me with some way right away and it might have been that message this morning because it's give me a different view he gave me a text that I wish to speak on for a few moments I wish to read now out of the book of Exodus the 14th chapter and the 15th verse and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak to the children of Israel that they go forward may I read the 16th also but lift up thy rod stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall pass on dry ground through the midst of the sea may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word and now let us bow our heads just a moment for prayer and if there's any people here that would like to be remembered in this prayer may you let it be known to God by an uplifted hand the Lord grant to you your desire Lord we now solemly and honorably and childlike walk on the sacred grounds of prayer we lay aside every weight every sin every thought that does so easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that's set before for us and as we move into these blessed sacred Sands of prayer knowing this that Jesus said ask the father anything in my name I'll do it and again it is written if ye abide in me and my word in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you then we come Lord not in the name of this little church or in the name of its Pastor though we love them are not in our own name because we have nothing to offer through it but we come in that alls sufficient name of the Lord Jesus who gave us the promise that if we asked in his name we could receive whatever we asked and we would not want to ask anything that was a myth we would want to ask only that which would be pleasing to you you know our conditions you know what we have need of you know what this little church has need of and what each individual has need of we'd pray thee Lord God to give to us Sly as we have needs may the great Holy Spirit move down upon this building and around these people and sanctify this group that the Holy Spirit might have the ride away through every heart here tonight from the least of the children to the oldest granted Lord these hands that were lifted up you most surely seen them Lord if a sparrow can notot fall in the street without you knowing it how much more do you know when a child of yours lifts its hand towards heaven for a bread we are promised that it will not receive a stone instead we know that you shall give them the bread that they asked for and we would ask to remember all that's sick and Afflicted so glad to hear from Brother Rogers that he said he felt well enough to go to work we are so glad for that Lord praying that you will heal him that that cancer will not have the the right away but will be stopped by the blood of the Lord Jesus by faith we place the blood of the Lord Jesus between the death cancer and our bre now we ask for all that's needy everywhere get glory to thyself honor thy word Lord as we have read it and give us a great healing service for the glory of God we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus amen for our text tonight I would like to use the three words why cry speak and for a subject I would like to use the attitude of people towards God's anointed just for a short time perhaps 20 minutes or 30 then we'll start the prayer line God had called Moses a special calling and when God calls a man and anoints him for a a certain Duty he expects that man to carry that out to the letter amen God doesn't want to give a man and a commission and him hum haul around about it he wants him to go straight forward and do just exactly what he's commissioned to do don't look right or left just move forward and the children of Israel had been in bondage for some 400 years but God had promised that he would visit them and God keeps every every promise that he makes he cannot lie he's God am and the time had come for this visitation and I believe tonight paralleling that God made a promise that he would return again I believe that we are near that time amen this morning when I was speaking on that subject I could almost feel the the current as to saying that The Nearness of the Lord Jesus now Moses being called for this purpose but he was a man God trained him 80 years before he ever was able to use him 40 years in the palace and 40 years in the wilderness God can train a man take him a hundred years for 30 minutes work God knows how to train what the schools had put in Moses 40 years had taken 40 years to get it out but one time in the presence of the anointing one time in the presence of the burning bush he know more about God than he' learned in books in the 80 years of his life God trains his man then anoints him gives him experience takes him through the riged training down to the Sands of burning punishment trying testing not only does he do that to His prophets but he does it to his children every son that cometh to God must be chastened and tried amen tested by his word see when the pinch comes the strong time when it faces death are you able to stand there on the word of God say God said so that settles it and God had called such a man and that man was Moses but Moses a great de like us every time it come a place to something had to be done Moses called out oh Lord what must I do in this place now isn't that just like we do God had blessed him and anointed him above his Brethren give him a message and a Ministry that had not been on the earth since that day until that day and yet every time something taken place Moses run off to God with it Lord what must I do amen what must I do in this case God got kind of tired of it I believe he said why are you crying to me speak to the people and go forward if any time it ever looked like the ought to retreat was in but God has no retreat there's no place to retreating God go forward amen the doctor says it's cancer go forward if he says it's TV go forward if the devil says you can't give this up go forward if your home says that you're going to be a fanatic go forward the church turns you out go forward there's no retreating back go forward speak and go forward speak what his word and go forward bust say at the Lord and move on cry out to the people but the people then rebelled and said it have been better that we died down in Egypt it had been better that we had our Graves marked and from the hyenas and the vultures to pick our bones in this Wilderness why did you bring us out here after they had seen that God had a approve Moses to be his servant God when God comes into a person or to persons into a congregation into a man or a woman he vindicates his presence amen God proves that he's there while when God comes Supernatural signs begin to appear this person becomes a changed person they're not no more like they used to be sin has vanished from their life fear and doubt has vanished fluster there are solid stable live or die it's Christ they don't care what comes or what goes nothing shakes them they move forward and Moses Fred with the people and other the people Fred to Moses and he said what must we do and go forward what's the the answer now they said we are out in this Wilderness and the armies of pharaoh is approaching us they're Camp just behind behind us but Moses knew to obey God and if God sends a representative and he anoints this representative and sends it into the world the people must obey that representative amen it's always been that way all down through the Bible Moses is called for the job God has said in the word he would do it he promised that he would send such a a thing in that day to deliver him and God did his part sent Moses and the children of Israel just because little stumbles and things come along to try they fail to march with Moses Now isn't that just like today amen we see the message come forth we see the church rise to a place on the wings of the Holy Spirit until the power of God TRS every person in there the glory of God Falls around and signs and wonders take place less than a week Satan is permitted to come in that congregation why does he do it God permits it and then the church begins to murmur fall back maybe it wasn't so there's where we fail that's the failing of the church am regardless of what takes place it's God move forward well say there's brother so and so I shouted the victory with him but he's back no matter what he done that has nothing to do with you well so and so professor said that that wasn't right that wasn't of the the Lord no matter what professor said so you are the guy that stood on the sacred grounds you're the guy was at the burning bush what professors of Egypt what a pharaoh would have said to Moses oh you just imagine you seen a bush you thought you had a that's a roaring in your ears Moses knew where he stood Moses knew what talked to him and every man that's born of the spirit of God knows what talks to him when the Holy Ghost comes it speaks of peace that passes understanding Moses was called he and God then after Moses receiving his call he went down to Egypt then he's got to get the people to believe him now he was the anointed prophet of the Lord but the people didn't believe him though he God proved it by signs and wonders that he did and because they didn't believe Moses the servant of the Lord then they fell in the wilderness and every one of them died that left Egypt not a one of them was saved everyone died perish beside Joshua and Caleb that started out because they murmured and complained against the Vindicated message that God had spoke in the Bible oh when I think of that when God promises anything God keeps his word amen and when God confirms that word to you then believe it God promised in the last days he' pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh I your young man would see Visions the old man would dream dreams upon my hands maids and Maid servants will I pour out of my spirit they show signs in the heavens and in the earth and great signs and wonders would take place in the last days and here we are in the last days and God's keeping his word the holy spirit's here and it vindicates the coming of the Lord Jesus and the people turn it down and murmur against it just like it was that's our deliverance Moses was a the the signpost of the Deliverance of Israel according to God's word the time Drew n God sent Moses he was God's light for that day and today the time's drawing now atomic bombs are ready the world's going to be blown to Pieces pretty soon ashes all over the Earth nothing but volcanic ashes the time is at hand and God promised he'd pour out his spirit and take his church out and the Holy Ghost is here representing that with signs and wonders proving that he is the same Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Ghost doing the same work that he did when he was here on Earth blinds the people the gospel always blinds the people if they don't open their eyes you either walk or it blinds the people yes every case in the Bible when God sent a messenger and that messenger was received there was a Revival in that time but if it was not receive there was no Revival but just chaos followed the unbelief and so is it today nothing less I think today I like to make mention of one woman that I think of in the Bible and she was bad to begin with rotten to the core a young beautiful woman by the name of Rahab she was a heathen to start with and she was a prostitute on the street but she heard that there was a God not an idol that set dumb or a declaration of Creeds amen but a God who lives among his people and anointed them and signs and wonders was fallowing them she heard about it one day two Representatives come to Jericho and quickly her on the street as a prostitute she called him took them into her house said they're after you and she hid them and I like her attitude she never said I'll believe when I see the Great anointed Joshua do some sign if I could have seen Moses do some of the signs I would have believe but she said I have heard Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word I have heard that the god of Heaven who is the real God is with you all and he's done great signs and wonders he dried up the Red Sea he brought Flags upon Egypt we see how you turned the enemy over to your hands and our whole country is trembling because of it I'm asking Mercy amen she didn't say I'll have to see this God first let me take my judgment and take what my scripture says about that and see she never found it but Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God and and she believed and when these words were brought back to Joshua the word Joshua means savior like Jesus died oh it brought back to Joshua God's anointed her house was permitted to stand and when the people marched 13 times around the walls of Jericho and sounded the trumpet every place on that wall fell but her house because she believed before she seen anything am she accepted it she said they're Servants of the most high God and I will receive it up on the basis of hearing it I believe it Faith cometh by hearing she heard it she believed it she accepted it I noticed they said bind this Scarlet string that you let us down with binded in the window that red spoke of the blood of Jesus there moment and every place in that wall fell but rahab's house it set on top of the wall God honored her and he she saw as great a miracle performed there as it was drying up the Red Sea for the hand of Jehovah was over that little place to protect it she had accepted it God's anointed God's servants went over there anointed and she believed it before she seen Miracles she believed it anyhow and accepted it Elijah the prophet of the Lord anointed oh yes God anointed him to be prophet he was Pastor Elijah I don't imagine Jezebel would have wanted to call him that but he was her pastor just the same God made him her pastor so she hated him and God told him said you go up on the mountain and you sit down there I've commanded the crows to feiji I'll Water you from the brook sedr and he sat down there and the King said go get that fanatic and bring him down here and the soldiers all armed with the command of the king they start up the hill and Elisha probably raised up and said something like this gentlemen this is a holy spot I've been called of God to be his Prophet amen he's commissioned me to stand on these grounds and Proclaim his message amen and the message that I have for you don't you approach this ground amen stay off of here the uncircumcised have you not read when Moses the servant of the Lord crossed over the river and the uncirc cised tried to impersonate him they all drowned him stay off of this ground oh they said that old quack what school is he from we'll go in anyhow Elijah said if I be a man of God let fire fall from Heaven and vindicate my Ministry and about that time fire fell and burn up 50 the king might have said lightning struck him so he sent another 50 and the same thing happened unbelief man who Mock and scoff and make fun of the anointed Church of the Living God Shall Perish someday in a Hell won't only be burning for a few minutes it might be a long time so it's holy grounds God's anointed stands on there no uncircumcised or unclean thing can enter that spot that is true if the impersonators try to act like that they're doing it you'll find out they'll soon come to not but what does the impersonators vindicate that there is a real there's a real God there are some people who want say they don't believe it but they want to act like they believe it but a person that knows God is a man that's born again of the Holy Ghost and fill with the power of God with a thus sayith the Lord and goes forward they know something has struck their heart they know that they're right so Elisha was a man of God anointed that they did not believe look at David when he sat with Nathan the prophet David a man after God's Own Heart and he was the Anointed God anointed him King David was not only a king but he was a prophet so Nathan was the great prophet of the nation David is more like l a poet and a prophet songwriter musician and prophecy really in its original is more like a a song when they prophesy then one day while the prophet and the King was sitting together David said it's not right for me to live in a house of Cedar in the ark of my God under a tent and I want you to listen the notable words of Nathan he said David oh don't fail to get this down get between the lines David do all that's in your heart for God is with you oh my why I think of that David do all that's in your heart for God's with you why cry to me God's with you speak and go forward amen God's anointed you move on on don't him hul around say this that or the other should I believe God should I trust him for this trust him for every breath that you draw it was the great General Stonewall Jackson who's been my favorite General since Joshua away Stonewall Jackson was asked one time how can you stand with just a handful of man when the opposition is so great that's how he got his name of stone wall he would not budge he know no retreat what could we accredit a man like that too a man when the Yankees come down by the thousands and he stood there in the minority but they never mov him he stood like a stone wall all the rest of the Rebel Army had retreated back lions come along said what's the matter with Jackson why isn't he going he said he stands like a stone wall that's where he got his title the other generals asked he said Mr Jackson little bitty fell blackheaded and blue eyed only is about 5 foot two inches tall very modest mild speaking little fell said Mr Jackson how can you stand in such opposition bash like he kicked his boot on the ground he said I never take a drink of water unless I thank God for it first that's where it is there's no retreat in God speak and go forward right that's God's commission to his church we have no time to slap they say the Revival is over it isn't over for it's time that Pentecost is played out it isn't it's time for Pentecost to rise in the name of Jesus Christ and go forward there's no retreat there's no stand on the same ground let's move with the spirit or the spirit will move on to somebody else and leave you standing you follow it do all that's in your heart for God is with you when Jesus came the Bible said Peter said on the day of Pentecost Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you how by signs Miracles and wonders which he did in the midst of you all for you all yourself is a witness to this what was he he was a signwork one anointed I know placees said Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you God's approval is upon him how did he approve him by signs wonders Jesus said if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me but if I do the works of my father then believe the works if you can't believe me as a man in other words he said if you can't believe I'm I'm he you will perish in your sins but if you don't believe me at least believe the works that I do oh he was approved of God by signs Nicodemus well expressed it when he came Ben night and he said good Master we know that there a teacher come from God amen amen amen they couldn't hide it we know that you're a teacher come from God for no man can do the things that you do the works that you do L God was with him they realized that he was approved of God anointed of God he was God's servant the church had to recognize it though they hated him they called him a devil they tried to find all kinds of excuses but when it come to face of facts they believe that he was the anointed one but they thought more of their tradition and they did the anointing of God Amen many and women today will join some social standings in the church join some intellectual group because they love to get into intellectual sections when they know that the spirit of God has life and movesen Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and the way he was then that's the way he is now and will be forever and the messenger of God is here the Holy Ghost to reject his death to receive it his life approve how does people accept it how the Holy Spirit has one message speak the word go forward that's right don't cry to me there's the word speak it and move forward thus sayith the Lord that's the message of the Holy Ghost now the people begin to murmur they fail we don't want to murmur what is The Works that Jesus did he said my Works declare me my Works proves who I am my Works vindicates me when God sent Moses The Works Vindicated him when God sent Elijah The Works Vindicated him when God anoints a man his Works vindicate him when God sent the Holy Ghost in This last days The Works Vindicated jining a church jining an organization accept the the creeder of Doctrine if that's the Holy Ghost then there has always been a holy ghost in all kinds of religions but this Holy Ghost has to be the same holy ghost that it was back on the day of Pentecost Arts not that same Holy Ghost has to never change it's the same Spirit it has to live forever Jesus said the works that I do he that believeth on me St John 14:7 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall shall he do also amen he that believeth on me amen no man can believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God until he's received the Holy Ghost you're only taking it by faith and accepting it you can't say that it is you can say I believe it is but no man can call Jesus the Christ until the Holy Ghost is in him the Bible said so the Holy Spirit has come in first then it gives a witness you know yourself that Jesus is the Christ Because He Lives in You amen then that same Holy Spirit introduces himself to the people and these signs shall follow them that believe and the church laughs at it and makes funs of it we're just living in that day the the atmosphere getting charged up for an atomic bomb for judgment the church is getting ready for a Rapture we're waiting anticipations waiting the church is waiting the coming of the Lord the world is a shaking Wonder which one's going to get the bomb first to the other one we don't care which one gets there we're going here so it doesn't matter which one gets there it doesn't have a thing to do with us we're just rejoicing happy believing it one day we'll hear a sound from heaven and here he'll come and his church will be caught up in the air to meet him and be with him he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also Peter said Jesus of Nazareth a prophet anointed anointed and approved of God among you all which you all yourself know the Bible said also that God anointed Jesus Christ with the Holy Ghost that he went about doing good Healing The Sick that was a sign that he was what he claimed to be that's the way God sends it that's the way it's supposed to come in the last days and the Holy Spirit that comes in the last days isn't to draw us to a Creed is to draw us to a church is to draw us to God and Supernatural signs is to follow that holy spirit amen what is the signs of the Holy Spirit if Jesus of Nazareth was a man approved of God Anointed with the Holy Ghost let's see what kind of a message he had what did he do how did he act see his action then we can follow his actions we find it when he first come on through his Ministry at the age of 30 when he was anointed with the Holy Ghost the first thing he did he met a man by the name of of Peter and he told him said your name is Simon and you're the son of Jonas and he believed in me why Moses had spoke before his time and he said the Lord your God shall rise a prophet just like me that'll be the sign you'll know he'll be a god Prophet that Messiah will be both God and prophet and he'll do the sign of a prophet when he does like the Jews today Lou Petra sent over a million Bibles to those Jews New Testaments that come from down in the other parts of the world and never heard of Jesus been down there for 2500 years they begin to read that New Testament and they said if this be the Messiah we know the Messiah will be a god Prophet if this is the Messiah and he's not dead but he's alive again let us see him do the sign of the Prophet we'll believe him for our our Messiah is a god Prophet Jesus said when he met Peter he said your name is Simon and your father's name is Jonas and Peter fell at his feet Lord he knew that that was who was spoke of strictly away went they went after Philip went for Nathaniel and told him what he had found and when Nathaniel come up before he he said there's an Israelite in whom there's no God said Rabbi when did you ever know me he said before Philip called you when he R the tree I saw you he said you are the Son of God you're the king of Israel they knew who that was that Samaritan when she said when he said bring me a drink that woman the nation of Samaria so said bring me a drink said it's not customary for you some uh you Jews to ask Samaritans such things as that I'm a woman of Samaria he said but if you knew who you were talking to You' ask me for a drink I'd give you water as you don't come here to draw the conversation went on for a while till he saw where her troubles was he said go get your husband and come here she said I have no husband he said that's right you've had five and the one you're living with now is not your husband you said it well she said sir am quickly the spirit of God on that woman sir I perceive that you are a prophet we know that the Messiah is coming and when he does he'll tell us these things but who are you he said I'm he dropped that water pot in away she went she got a drink out of a well that was bubbling up in her soul she run into the City and said come see a man who's told me the things that I've done isn't that the very Messiah that was him yesterday that's him today that's forever the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen why do we linger why do we wonder do we wonder whether God will heal or not we have seen him heal the thousands blind sick lame Hal those that are dead and pronounced dead raised up again under the power of the prayer of faith the Holy Spirit reveals and hundreds are healed blinded eyes deaf ears the world tried to ignore it they try to shake it off but they can't it comes right back again it's before him you can't shake him off your hands when Pentecost first sprung up 40 years ago they said it won't last it's a bunch of Holy Rollers last it's the fastest growing Church in the world last year it produced a milion 500,000 converts which is beond all the rest of churches put together 1,500,000 last year there you are it's not a burning up it's it's not burning down it's burning up yes they say they're crazy they try to shake the people away from them they try to take the people get away from that group don't you fool with them there's nothing to it get away from it just the same if I'll be lift it up I'll draw all man to me one one great sign Goes Forth of the baptism of Holy Spirit they spoke with tongues and they believed that many hundreds and hundreds poured into it then it come to a place they tried to shake that away God pushed right in and give interpretations on top of it then as soon as he got through that God sent prophecy in that he said if there be one among you that's unlearned and one speaks in tongues but if there be one who prophesies and tells the secrets of the heart they all fall down and say God is truly with you what is it there's that Messiah sign again coming in yes sir if one reveals the secret of the heart the whole congregation will say truly God is with you amen Messiah sign that's what would mean we see that more they try to sh Shake more God's going to do in one day he's going to get tired of shaking them he's going to get tired of pushing that church around and what he does he's going to get enough and he's going to turn one string of judgment and he's going to reach down with an everlasting hand and pick up his church she'll Fly Away Oh Glory Fly Away in the morning oh my long to be there I will be Amen on that morning she takes the wings of the morning and flies away into the arms of her lover amen oh what a day that'll be today we're living why do we worry why do you wonder why do you wait speak and go forward amen don't cry out say oh Lord is it your will to heal today chur your will thus sayith the lord it's his will can I receive the Holy Ghost day is the days of Miracles pass certainly the days of Miracles is here forever the holy spirit is here does man speak with tongues today the Bible said so these signs shall follow them that believe does man interpretate message the Bible said they do that settles it th sayith the Lord speak don't cry speak and go forward God don't want a bunch of crying babies he wants man that's got backbone not wishbones wish I had wish I could do this backbones that'll stand in the breach amen claim the victory claim the call out in the midst of darkness no matter what anyone says we speak and go forward believe the message God share he'll vindicate his message God share he's the same God that he was back in our own Galilee he's the same God that he was in the days of Moses he can't fail do you believe it the Holy Spirit has come the signs of the Holy Spirit Jesus said if I don't do the works of my father then Believe Me Not but if I do the works of my father then you believe me when he told the woman at the well something that she had wrong with her she said that's the Messiah he said the one that believes on me the works that I do shall he also and More Than This shall he do for I'll go to the father now the King James has got greater if you take the original don't say greater how could anything greater be done amen right he stopped nature he heal the sick he raised the dead he cleanse the lepers oh oh he done everything but he said more of it you'll do for I'll not only be with you but I'll be in you to the end of the world Amen do you believe it amen we're so glad to have the Lord Jesus in US amen so we can believe that word from few announcements and then a prayer request when brother George Smith was here he um talked about the books that he had was working on the church age book and then this seal book and so there was a few brothers that have requested it specifically I'll make sure they get a copy of that that's there it's in the back there there's a few copies of that exposition of church age the uh resume of the seven Church ages and um Christian baptism this is really good I really like that so those are in the back there he had did something for the Sunday for the kids it's a little walk with me coloring book I know some of the brothers in South Africa really enjoyed that I don't know how many of the Saints have it or know it he only sent one copy but if that's something you want more of then he would definitely send that to us so those are there's a cop a list of those in the back or a number of those in the back um a reminder sub uh Sabino February the 24th there's a trip to Sabino that's being planned or formed and I think you need to get back with sister Aaron on that send her a text just so they can get the number together there's a reminder I think you need to get back with her by tomorrow or something like the date is on that text but as soon as possible if you're interested in going and then also this Sunday morning brother bill lingard will be here speaking for us and Sunday night brother Ferguson will be with us and next week Wednesday the 21st brother Ferguson will be here with us as well so Sunday night Wednesday night brother Ferguson Sunday morning will be brother Bill lingar amen all right and so just to give you a little update on when we uh about the church the group in Phoenix There Brother Art so we move that service there from Wednesday to Thursday night and the Saints here are welcome to go and be a part of that they streamed the service here on Sunday morning um brother sister Carpenter and the Carpenters have been coming to the hotel and then they opened it up for open their Church up for us to to meet there on Sunday mornings and uh Sunday nights and Thursday nights and so um normally I'll go down or brother George he's not here tonight we'll go down on the Thursday night to have service with the group that's in Phoenix and so when we say pray that's what we're talking about pray for that group there and they would obviously love to see you Saints there as well U for that service but pray that the Lord will just um lead and guide on how to proceed and continue to serve that group another little group in the San Carlos reservation brother Wills um olifant goes there and he calls this his home Church that was placed on his heart to go there and so um Sister Jesse Lynn and Caleb they'll go there and do the music for them on Sunday morning they have one service and we do what we can to help them um I haven't been there myself but brother George has been there a number of times brother Josh has been there this last time one of the visiting brothers that come through the city for the Trevor we sent him there and and so um it's a missionary work it's a ministry that's always been there and we' like to see the Lord bless them and help them and we just don't know how um brother Will's not here tonight but um he's been praying about how to go about helping the little group there and I you know we made oursel available to them and so the church has been a part of that and but pray for the full Direction on how what the Lord wants to do for those folks there also there is a um our Sunday school our adult Sunday school is um for us to hear the word and we're in the second seal and so we take 20 minutes for the adult Sunday school and so during the week you can listen to that anytime and just get familiar with that seal and then we come here uh we can't listen to it all but we just listen to a portion of it and God always speaks to us during that time so that's what the adult Sunday school is and you can just background it with listening to that message and um in your own private time or tape time so when you come together you can really get more out of that adult Sunday school service and so those little Ministries like our men's prayer meeting that we have here on Saturday it's not a a must but it kind of just developed into where we meet here on Saturday mornings um just the men only and someone said what about the sisters well they can do it in their home so they can meet at you know they can get up at whatever time they would get up 5 or 4 and we pray from 5: a.m. to 6 that's on a Saturday that just came it just developed and it's a Ministry of this church and we just try to serve as we as we can you you just you know sometimes we always asking the Lord Lord what should I do Lord what should I do but like on the just him and H around you just do what you're supposed to do do what you know to do and God opens the doors and he'll bless it so that's a little Ministry you know that's you know that's Saturday and then we're here Sunday then we're here Wednesday then Thursday there's a you know work going on in Fe Phoenix Thursday and if our door opened up in Castle grand for Tuesday night I would go there too and so it's whatever the door the the amen would you pray for me or would you so at least pray all right so maybe you don't understand it all together and I don't either but the Lord works it out we walk follow the motive of objections of your heart and the Lord sees that when we went to Phoenix and started there um I contacted the pastors that I'm in fellowship with and they know exactly what's going on whether adonius has sent ministers there to preach for us when we couldn't go and so um you continue to pray for that work but that's a Thursday night service for the saints that that find yourself in Phoenix um that's available to you all right for our prayer requests um brother

paperwork has to be signed and then once that paperwork is signed then we have 6 months that we need to find another place another location and so um they have not sent us that final I know it's been signed but they haven't officially given us a date or time when we're on the six month clock but um pray and we'll ask the Lord to direct us and help us as he has done in the past we believe he'll do
