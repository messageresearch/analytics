into my I I don't even I forgot what I was going to preach on tonight I don't even know where we're going amen Well's good to be here tonight I am you can be seated for a moment if you'd like I was going to mention it Sunday morning when I uh Sunday evening when I came and opened in prayer that I do in fact still go to church here ain't been there in a couple weeks just trying to been follow the Lord's leading you know spread the word spread the good news that's what we're trying to do who knows that the word of God it's a seed that's what the prophet told us he said it's a seed that goes out and the seed it has to it has to go in the right conditions it has to go in the right atmosphere it's got to be planted in good ground he says in the message of queen of shebe says the word of God right here is a seed that a sewer SWS and every seed will produce its kind he said if it's put in the right atmospheres and the right condition he said you can't hide it you can't hide genuine life and it this feels like the right atmosphere this feels like the right condition it feels like the word of God can come forth tonight and that it can go into some good ground that's what it feels like and we're as a Believer we're we're responsible for providing a right condition we are responsible when you've heard this word for creating an atmosphere that the spirit of God can feel comfortable moving in how how is he going to walk these aisles if we cannot create the right atmosphere then to if we're not coming in in the right atmosphere he's not going to move that that Heavenly Dove it's not going to come down on a lamb that's sitting here and if we could just stand we'll turn to that scripture right there Matthew 3 veres 13-1 17 uh three Matthew 3: 13-1 17 verse 13 says then cometh Jesus from galile to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him he said but John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and cometh thou to me he said and Jesus answered said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness he said then he suffered him and Jesus when he was baptized went up straight way out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and liting upon him and that's that that happened for Jesus and that's just the same for a Believer the heavens when you have been baptized when you give your life to Christ when you are you have a heart of repentance the heavens are open to a believer any any Redemptive blessing that he died for whatever it may be they open to the believer and that Dove that spirit of God it looks to come upon a Believer any chance it can but we got to be in the right condition for that to happen we have to walk with the right atmosphere around us for those things to happen says in low a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased amen may the Lord add the blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated and the title tonight is getting in Lamb condition and the the scripture it's it's from the message the church and its condition and the prophet when he's when he's going over this scripture here he's talking he's talking about the scripture and how that Dove came down and it came down on the Lamb of God then as he moves forward in that message he starts typing the believer to a lamb he starts typing the believer to a sheep and he starts talking about the right condition that that lamb has to be in and he starts talking about about what a lamb is like the attributes of a lamb and he says the proverb refers them he calls them a a sacrificial bird and a sacrificial beast and he says that's what drew the Lord to those two animals is that they were animals that were sacrificial you know the dove it's a it's a monogamous bird it's a bird of Purity it has a mate for life that's right and we know in the scripture that Jesus told us when the comforter will be sent back to you he will abide with you forever what a type of the spirit of God and we know that we know that a lamb it's the ultimate sacrificial animal it's willing to do whatever the shepherd's voice tells it to do it's willing to go wherever the shepherd tells it to go it it's in the field it's listening to hear what the shepherd has to say to it it has ears open at all times and now that's what we have to get into today we have to get into a lamb's condition and that's something the prophet brought out in this tape and now he could have he could have chosen a lion he could have chosen a bear he could have chosen strong animals and strength to represent the believer but he chose an animal that was willing to give up its own self-will he chose an animal that was willing to have everything sheared off of it at any point of its life it was willing to give up anything to do what the shepherd said to do yes sir and that's why he represented himself like that and the these powerful animals a lion a bear like we said they they are animals that depend on their own strength they don't depend on anything else the lamb it depends on the shepherd they don't depend on anything they they do their own thing they do what they want to do they they're they're not a they're not sacrificial at all and the prophet says in the message the church in its condition he's speaking of people coming coming to a meeting that he's going to be at in Canada and he's talking about how they're sacrificing things to get there how there there's some people that's that's selling their businesses just to get to his meeting there's people that are that are selling everything they have just to come get a glimpse of what Jesus Christ is doing in in their hour they're selling everything there now there's a lot of there's a lot of sellouts today but they not a lot of sellouts for the right thing at any point we have to be willing to put anything down to sell out anything that the shepherd would tell us to sell out on we have to have a willing and an obedient heart that's what Jesus Christ had that's the example that he brought us he he showed us what a willing and obedient heart looked like he got down in the garden and he said father I don't want to do this I don't want to have to go I don't I don't want to have to sacrifice myself like this may this cup pass from me but if it be thy will Lord if you want me to do this Lord I will do it do it that's the lamb condition right there that's where we need to be at at a spot where we can give any of it up he said he said it's a sacrifice that they make is what causes them to get so much out of the service it's a sacrifice that they make he said when there's no sacrifice there's not very much to the service when there's no sacrifice there's not much to a service Wednesday nights sometimes they feel like a sacrifice they feel like a big sacrifice you had a a rough day and it's it it feels like a sacrifice getting over here at 7:00 p.m. and walking in the church and hearing hearing a not very good preacher preach to you it's a sacrifice you got to just sit on through it hopefully you will but why is that he said when there's no sacrifice there's there's not very much to the surface why is that it's because Christianity in itself at its core is built on sacrifice Jesus Christ's life was built on sacrifice it was doing whatever ever it took to win a soul it was doing whatever it took to to just pull somebody in closer to the gospel it's built on sacrifice he said you he said you have to really get down and do something that hurts real bad he said you have to lay aside some things and stop the work and do this or that to get to go to church and show God that you love him he said you make a sacrifice to God it's then when you get something out of it when you make a sacrifice to God and God want a believer in that sacrificial state in that sacrificial condition at all times willing and ready to go in the message of church and its condition again he says now another thing the lamb is the Lamb is willing to submit its rights he said now God wants us to be Lambs but there's so many times that we don't want to submit our rights or forfeit our rights you know we say brother I have a right to be angry at them they did me wrong I have a right to hold them accountable yeah all right I have a right to tell them what I think about them and when we get outside those Church doors I'm going to tell them what I think about them they they did me wrong and I got a right to do it but God's not going to he's not going to move in a heart of unforgiveness or a heart of bitterness that's not the right condition that's not a place that Dove it's going to go fly off as the prophet told us and sit on a branch somewhere it's going to fly away and it's going to sit on that Branch until we can realize what's happened we can take an in we can think that's the problem nowadays people say I feel so distant from the Lord I feel like my prayer it's not making it past the ceiling I I feel like it's not going anywhere well at that point we need to take a personal inventory and think father do I need to go make something right is there a reason my prayer does it feel like it's not getting to you is the dove far from me and he'll reveal it to you if you have a True Heart of repentance that's what repentance it repentance isn't just right when we first come to the Lord right when the initial birth happens but it's every single day of our life it's over and over and over again I I I make mistakes every single day and we have to continually repent for them and repenting is you you've been going this way and you make a 18 180 and you decide you're going to go this way it's turning for the lord it's making a U-turn in life going down a different street you know unforgiveness I've heard I've heard some people say that you know unforgiveness or when you have a odd against somebody when you have a disagreement it's only hurting you I've heard people preach that they say it's only hurting you and I understand what they're saying it it does hurt you because then you're sitting there and you're thinking about it and it's messing your day up when they don't even know anything's going on they don't even they they have no idea anything's going on but it's messing your day up but i' would also like to I'd like to think about it on the other hand too when you're holding something against somebody like that in your life and you're not in that right condition you're hurting them too what if the Lord wants to use you to contact them are you in the right condition would would he use you in that manner to contact them if you have a odd against them we have to think of it both ways it's not just hurting you it could possibly be hurting somebody that needs their soul saved that needs to hear the that needs to hear a tape for the first time that needs to read their Bible for the first time if you got something against them like that he goes on he says so many of you say well I've got rights brother Brenham he said that's true but are you willing to forfeit your rights are you willing to give your rights that God could lead you that's what the matter with our churches today in the majority that the gentleness of the Lamb of God we are supposed to be lambs and we have become everything else but Lambs he said we become everything else but Lambs he says and that's the reason as soon as we get that attitude the dove of the Holy Spirit takes her flight and leaves she does he says if the Lamb of God would have made the first snarl like a wolf or would have done anything contrary to what the gentle Dove would have permitted the dove would have took her flight yes she would have left in a minute and we have to invite that Dove back we have to get in a condition that that Dove is willing to come back into our lives we have to get in a spot it it starts with recognition and you know what he said about repentance he said before and this was for time and time again in in our spiritual walk he said before you can get to that heart of repentance he said you got to go back and realize what Calvary meant to you you have to go back and have a revelation and a realization in your life of what he did for you because initially when you got when you had that first revelation when it really struck your heart what Christ did for you that somebody that shouldn't have cared about you cared for you when you were down in the myy clay that he reached down and picked you up when you come back to that revelation then you can have a heart of repentance and now a heart of repentance it's not being a lifetime apology Giver either it it's it's talking about you give the apology and we're we're turning a different way it's not I'm going to apologize and I'm going to do it do the same thing to you again tomorrow I'm going to apologize and do it again tomorrow that's not a true heart of repentance a True Heart of repentance is realizing you've wronged the one that's done everything for you when you didn't deserve it when we didn't deserve it when I didn't deserve it he goes on in that same thought and he says and the dove would not have settled on a wolf his Nature's not right it couldn't have settled on a dog his Nature's not right it had to be on a lamb he said the two Natures had to be the same and that's the way we have to be our Natures has to change from the Roaring sinner to the meekness of a lamb and as we're saying that that's a daily battle that's a daily fight we're going to fight for every inch of ground that we claim that we want to stand on we're going to continue to fight it's not it's not good enough that that I was just I had the I was in the lamb condition on Tuesday and then then I go back to being a wretch on Wednesday that's not good enough that's not what he's looking for he's looking for that constant lamb condition somebody that he can use at all times not just somebody he can use on their good days when everything's going right for him but somebody that he can use on their bad days when nothing's going right for him cuz speaking for preaching itself when when you have a service coming up and you're about to preach I I know brother George and brother Israel could probably attest for it everything goes wrong your day turns bad the devil starts attacking he your truck won't start you you can't you can't get to work on time all kinds of stuff happens to you but you got to keep that lamb condition you got to stay in a place where God can use you if you get out of that lamb condition he can't use you you'll just sit there and you'll stay in it Lord help us he says is anything too hard for the Lord he says now Satan do you do you think the devil knows when God's about to do something for you do you think the devil can see that he says now Satan was trying to block Abraham and Sarah because he knew there was an Angelic visitation coming the devil was trying to get them out of a condition now he was trying to get them in a wrong condition and he succeeded with one of them he succeeded with Sarah the prophet says he didn't seed with Abraham now a few paragraphs down in the same message he's speaking to Sarah he says see she had herself all out of condition to receive it when God brought it you know we ask God for so much in our lives and we and and he wants to give it to us but we just can't seem to sometimes get to a place where we can allow him to give it to us where we can allow ourselves to receive it he says oh my don't never get that in your heart he said be open be ready he said she missed it she failed to see it he said maybe if we don't watch Friends the church is going to fail to see it he said let's not look for church hair does and new dresses he said let's look for the Holy Spirit to come in the Supernatural and raise some things when we walk into a church service let's not be looking around at everybody's new pair of shoes or their new clothes they got on let's look like in that song service that we just had let's look for the Holy Spirit to move in this place let's have expectations let's build an atmosphere you know he refers to the believer in this age as a spiritual astronaut and now something about an astronaut when he goes to space or when they go to the moon or wherever they end up going he's a pilgrim in a Strange Land so for him to make it in that Strange Land he's got to bring his own atmosphere with him and that's what we got to do in a church we got to bring our own atmosphere with us and watch it start affecting somebody that's sitting here that's the reason why Fellowship is so important come into the house of God because you may be on the mountain top but your brother or sister over here is in the valley and they need your help to pick them up out of it that's why we got to get in the right condition no matter where we're at we're depending on one another we need one another he said the church don't need a facelift it needs a birth he said the Holy Ghost to come into the church bring back people is that what we still believe today that we need the holy ghost in the church or are we just a bunch of Saved people are we just just a bunch of Saved people sitting here it don't it don't matter if the Holy Ghost moves or not he has to move for anything good to happen for you he has to move we're not going to work it up oursel it's not how good I am it wasn't he said it's not how good Abraham is he said it's because Abraham was elected and then Abraham was called and then Abraham separated himself from everything that's what he called Abraham to do and that's what he calls us to do it's a lection then it's a calling out and then it's a separation from everything and that's what the lamb will do it'll Shear off everything it won't sit there and kick he mentions that in another spot it won't sit there and kick whoever's sharing it but it'll take it it'll just take that sharing it'll take any correction it needs any of the the the Lambs today the lamb sitting in here they'll take the word when it comes forth when that seed word comes forth They will receive it if they are in a lamb condition he says bring back people and that believes the Supernatural and holds on in waiting for the coming of the Lord as if it might be any hour living in them conditions he said no facelift we don't we don't need a covering up we don't need excuses we just need a birth if anybody is if you know the story of zakus as a prophet tells it and he kind of dramatized it a little bit he said zakus gets up in a tree cuz he's trying to see Jesus and zakus is sitting in there and the tree it has a spot that comes to a y and that's God's way and that's zaki's way and he said that's a great place to be because that's where change comes and so zakus he's sitting there and he's wanting to see Jesus he's looking for Jesus I feel like if we should be coming here looking for Jesus I don't care if we've been believing for 50 years or just 10 minutes we should come here looking for Jesus but zakus he's got all that garbage all over him he's got all that stink on him he's got splinters all up and down him and zakus right when he sees Jesus around the corner what does he do he takes two branches and he covers himself up he just covers himself and that's that's a what what did Adam and Eve do they covered their self and that's what we do sometime we try and cover it up but God's going to he's going to search it out he sees what's in our heart he sees what's keeping us from getting in that right condition he's going to search it out he's going to find it and after it's all said and done we're glad that he found it because we were able to move out of that condition and get in a right condition to receive something from him and he talks of he he says in Blasphemous names he says it's a birth and and he says I've been birthed into this and this and this and this he says it seven times so just after the initial birth it's not done there there's still some growing to do we never we we don't just come in receive it and then it's all said and done but we're birthed into this into this we grow and we grow our condition gets better and better we get closer to that Lamb of God condition that example that came and walked this Earth for us that's the example that's the condition we need to get into he said then what does he do when he gives me the Holy Ghost he said he sits you out in a separate place to yourself he said he marks you see so it's an election it's a calling then it's that separation and that's that's been that was a precent that God sent from the very beginning God separated the light from the darkness and if if this is anything today it's a separating time it's a separating time it's a preparation time to get ready for the coming of the Lord to to be in a Rapture condition whenever he calls it could be as a prophet said over and over in the tapes it could be tonight it could be in the morning and and he preached that to people hard the Rapture condition we we have to get to a place where you wouldn't be scared about it if it was in the morning where we wouldn't feel like we had anything to worry about a a beautiful testimony brother Mark Castillo his me and brother George went over there and his mother had just passed away we showed up there on Friday or Saturday and his mother had passed away Thursday and you you would think that you would you would walk in and you would see a guy that was a mess and I'm sure he was a little bit but he wasn't showing it and the reason he wasn't showing it is because his mother had been so faithful for years and years and her her last breath was that this is what I've been waiting for this is the moment I've been wait this is what I've been preparing for she was in a lamb condition she knew that the shepherd was coming to get her what a testimony laying there on your deathbed so many people would be scared to death of that but she said this is what I've been waiting for I'm going home I don't have to deal with this anymore I'm about I'm about about to shed these 16 elements and I'm going to go somewhere different that's where I'm going to go put me in the ground already and if that's if that's how we can't think about death today that's we would we should take an inventory if if you can't think about if I were on my death bed right now would would my testimony be come get me Lord I'm I'm ready I know I'm prepared for this I don't not being arrogant not not being arrogant about it but knowing that you've done everything that the Lord's wanted you to do knowing that you you've been in a land condition that you've allowed him to lead you that there's nothing else you need to make right that you made those things right is that our testimony would it be our testimony and if it's not we need to think on those things we need to we need to find out where the problems at if there are any as I mean not for me I don't have any I mean if you guys got some if you do I don't I don't I'm thinking right now and I really can't spot any but he goes on he says you're a different person then he said you're not of the world no more he said see you're clothed different you're dressed different he said not this outside dress he said no no you don't have to be odd and peculiar and and caller turned around and a long ceremony he said like no no you you don't do that he said you dress physically like this it's a spiritual dress that counts the wedding garment has been put on you he said what are you he said like Jesus watch he was overshadowed and he was transf triggered before them and his reignment Shine Like the Sun there he was Jesus God placing his own sun sea and that's what he's saying here if that if that spiritual reignment on the inside if that starts shining that'll make this outside reignment start shining that'll make that's what makes this outside reignment start coming under subjection when that spiritual reignment when it starts shining we'll we'll start seeing men walk like men again talk like men again act like men again not act like women and we'll start see and women get back to the place where they're supposed to be if that spiritual reignment is right and it's shining and Something's Happened on the inside that's what God cares about he cares about what's happening on the inside the inside condition the outside condition Abraham when he finally got to the end to the promise being fulfilled he was old and decrepit he he didn't look like much of anything but that inside condition something was happening on the inside he had he had waited he had preped prepared and something was fixing to happen in Abraham's life and that's what it takes to become reflectors of the word in this day the prophet he says uh the prophets of God are reflectors reflectors of God's word and then in that same tape when he's talking about that he said you are reflectors of God's word now let me say something that might not be popular amongst the message today if we're not if we're not hearing that messenger reflector and if we're not reflecting the same thing that he's reflecting then you can't be a true reflector today you got to be hearing that voice you got to hear the voice I like what brother Israel said he said you you can read the tapes you can read them that's fine I do that with a lot of the older tapes but hear the voice of God for your day it does something to you it drives out demons I remember when I when I was brand new and I would I would flip on a tape and I was so tormented anxiety depression whatever it was you name it and I would flip on a tape and those demons scattered like cockroaches when you flip flip on a light they don't want nothing to do with that there's power on those tapes there's power behind that voice it was in the days of what the voice there's power there we need to be hearing that voice he goes on in another place he says now the lamb is a very gentle little fell he said he doesn't he can't help himself he isn't self-reliance because he can't help himself the lamb he realizes he's nothing he realizes he's not a thing he said here some time ago I was going through a pasture when I used to patrol and I found a little lamb and all of them that had got away from him somehow said and he was all wound up in a little bunch of Bob wire now that lamb I imagine got himself wound up in that Bob wire it was his fault he had gotten away from the rest and he got himself in an awful condition and God will let us get in that shape sometimes he'll let he'll let us open our own doors he'll let us follow our own ways he'll let us figure it out for oursel because if he doesn't if he helps us too soon and we'll say oh Lord I had a couple doors left now I probably could have still done it my way but he'll let us try every single way he said and the poor little fellow was laying there bleeding and bleeding and I come by and I seen way up about a half mile up was a whole herd of sheep he said now he'd have laid right there and the crows would have been picking in his eyes pretty soon if he hadn't have got him out he said but I W the little guy little fell picked him up in my arms he never refused he laid real quiet he said I picked him up in my arms first time perhaps a human being had ever had their hands on him but he was gentle he was willing to be led he was willing to be helped he said I hope you see it he was willing not to try to resist or to kick back or to bite he said Lambs don't Kickback they don't bite they just humble themselves and this little fi packed him up and sit him down on the rest of the sheep in a few minutes his mam found him and he was happy as he was now how typical that is of a lamb of God and he he's bringing these things out to tell us this is what this is where we need to be he's saying this is how we need to be with the Lord we need to allow him to lead us we need to be ready at any moment to move whatever Direction he says no matter if it's hard if it's easy no matter which direction it is he says in another place but the lamb it doesn't have any great minds of its own he said a lamb is one thing when it's lost it's hopelessly lost we were hopelessly lost we we had no way of bridging that Gap we had no way of getting ourself to Jesus Christ he came looking for us he ran us down we didn't run him down we didn't go seeking him I don't ever remember it it crossing my mind I need to go seek Jesus but one day he ran me down from behind and grabbed a hold of me and changed my life it wasn't in us to seek after him there there was nothing that we could do to get oursel to him nothing at all he said a sheep can't find its way back he said that's the reason the goat leads it to its death he said it can't find its way a sheep's lost he said that's the reason God likened us to sheep when we're lost we're lost he said there's no way we can find oursel he said there's only one way to do it that's submit yourselves to The Shepherd of the FL block and he does deleting and he mentions this this lamb it it realizes it doesn't have a great mind of its own but sometimes today we get to thinking we might be somebody because we got this message we might begin to think I'm somebody I'm something special I'm the bride of Christ I'm special and there's so much preaching today about you're the bride of Christ you're special you're this you're that we are nothing let's not get away from the Good gospel message we're nothing without Jesus Christ we're nothing without the blood of Jesus Christ we are zip without it we were nowhere without it the prophet tells a story of a man that he was he he was walking up a hill it was a a man that was real smart he said he could he could talk about the Bible with anybody he knew all the Hebrew he knew all the Greek and he was walking up the hill to his church one day and he kind of got a feeling that somebody was walking behind him and so he stops for a second because he was going to talk to him about the word a little bit and as he turns and looks he sees a A man carrying like a big bundle on his back and the bundle he said was bigger than the man himself he said it was bigger than the man and he looked over at him and he he asked him if he needed some help and he said no I got to pack this bundle myself he said I got to pack this bundle and he said then I realized I was in a vision he said I looked down at his hands and there was holes in his hands he said I realized who it was I was talking to and he fell down and he said Lord I'm so sorry he said is that he said is that the sins of the world on your back he said no that's just your sins on my back he said I got to get you up this hill I got you got to get you in a right condition so when we get to thinking we're somebody remember who's carrying our sins on his back up the hill when we get to thinking we know a lot when we get to thinking we're something special or or something about this Flesh and Blood warranted our Salvation remember who's packing that bundle up the hill we were not able to pack that bundle that bundle that bundle that that wasn't our bundle to pack that was his bundle to pack we didn't do anything we and then sometimes we we'll be ashamed of it we'll be ashamed to testify of it we'll be we'll be ashamed to to say what Jesus Christ has done for me last night my my truck broke down at work that's why I mentioned that it was 9:00 p.m. I had just got finished studying at my work and I went out to crank my truck broke down it it wouldn't start and so I called this Uber and uh it was a Jamaican guy showed up in the Uber and he was a Christian and I just thought isn't it funny how God works things out and so we started talking about he had Christian music on the radio and actually invited him to church tonight and we I just started testifying to him I started testifying about Jesus I didn't I didn't mention anything else but just Jesus Christ and he had the same testimony and I thought how good is God how how good how how Faithful Is He that he would put two people together like this you know what started out looking like I can't believe my truck is broke down why in the world is this broke down and and it led to that conversation we can't be ashamed to to share the gospel he tells another story about that the girl returning home from college on the train oh yeah and she's riding the train back and she's got her her worldly college friend with her that she had picked up brother Bram said she had she had gotten away and gotten away from God out there at college and a worldly friend was sitting beside her and they're pulling up and they they see this old scarred up marred up woman walking over there and the friend says my goodness look at her wouldn't you be a ashamed to be seen with her wouldn't you be ashamed to be seen eaten with her and it was her mother and she's sitting there and she doesn't say anything then she gets off the train and and the mother comes up to her just how Jesus does with us or how he did with us how he does every day with us and the mother ran up and and tried to hug her and put her arms around said my darling my darling you've returned back and then the girl turns away just turns her back to her mother and then the conductor of the trainy says knew the story so he said the conductor of the train walked over and grabbed a hold of the girl and said you mean to tell me that's how you're going to act to your mother he said let me remind you of the story every time I tell a story it's hard to hard to make it through this one he said when you're a baby he said you know the story when you were a baby the house was on fire and he said you were upstairs and your mother was out back hanging the clothes and there was and there was a fire in the house and GRE upstairs and the mother and the the the fir trucks came and everybody came and brother Brandon made a statement when he was telling the story he said nobody would dare Pierce those Flames for you he said nobody would dare do it nobody wanted to enter that fire for you and as he goes on he said that mother she grabbed some clothes and she wrapped herself in them and she ran through the house and then she got to you and she had to take all that wrapping off and and cover you up and as she ran out all the Flames were licking her all the Flames were hitting her and they were scarring her up and they were making her ugly and he said she was even more beautiful than you was but because of her love for you because she she she couldn't stand to see you die just like Christ with us he couldn't stand to see you die that's right a life of sin he went in the Flames for you he went on the cross for you and we may know all of this maybe this is simple but like I said you can't get away from preaching the gospel message the blood of Jesus Christ what does any of it mean to us if not for that what's this message mean if not for that yes sir would it mean anything at the end of that story The Prophet said that's the way Jesus did for us he said when we were Sinners ugly before God Cast Away turned away he came the lovely Son of God from the ivory palaces come down upon the Earth and took the shame upon himself he said and and the sin upon himself and died out there at Calvary crying he said should I be ashamed of his gospel that's right that's right should we be ashamed to be a lamb that's led by the dove should we be ashamed of that today no matter what the world tells us is the right way no matter what the Glamorous way is should we be ashamed of that today we can't be ashamed of that today he said Christians on the streets were ashamed to stand up for the gospel he said when he was marred and made ugly that you could be free he was marred with sin that you could be free from sin he said don't never deny him always love him he said stand for that which is true stand for his gospel as a musicians come tonight we'll just read we'll read one more quote here in the church in its condition he says come back to a lamb he says come back to be gentle come back to know nothing come back to just submit yourself to Christ he said don't don't try don't try to know nothing he said just walk meekly quietly humbly gently and the dove will lead you he said but whenever you see go to listening to that gossip whenever you go to getting that temper up whenever you go to thinking that you got a right to do this or you got a right to do that the dove just takes her flight and goes on away he said then you don't have it anymore he said now she's not very far from you this morning church or tonight he said she's sitting right out there on the limb of Peace waiting for your nature to be changed he said what you need today is to submit all your rights is to let God lay you down and shave all your rights off of you he he said amen could you imagine how a little old lamb all fleece hanging over him that's his rights he said yeah yeah pant pant pant burning up and then just lay on the shearing table they know what's best for him take all of his rights away from him and Shear it all off how cool and light he runs and that opportunity is here tonight how cool and light you can run if you'll just allow him to Shear it off of you and that's got to be a decision of yours repentance has to be a decision of yours he he can't make that decision for you he can't take that step for you that's right he can't make something right for you these are things that we have to realize we have to take that inventory and go make it right go apologize forgive that brother forgive that sister no matter what they did to you whatever it is whatever is blocking that lamb condition we got to get rid of it in our lives we got to seek it out and get rid of it he said yes sir I I'll if you'll forfeit your rights that's what you get but you got to forfeit your rights and let the word of God shave all the world off of you take all the habits of the world away and you become a new creature in Christ and if we could just bow our heads here this is a this is a prayer that the prophet prayed at the end of this message he said but what am I going to do he said what can I do he said oh Christ I'll stand for you now he said I'll take my choice today he said I'll forfeit all my talking about other people he said I'll forfeit all my temper I'll forfeit all my differences I'll forfeit everything he said Shear me off Lord he said take all I got he said you just take me Lord he said I want to stand in your place I want to be sheared I want all selfishness all Pride all indifference just all taken off of me he said then I want to stand for you as a sheared lamb let that sink to your heart he said willing to give up all the pleasures of what they call pleasures of life all the dances all the parties all the old V vulgar clothes makeup lipstick fingernail polish all this indifference that looks like the world he said you said don't even act like the world don't even associate with the world come out from among them he said oh God help me Lord he said Shear me today he said take me like a lamb and let me be dumb he said don't open my mouth say nothing about it just stand and be sheared Heavenly Father we just ask that you would let us be sheared tonight Lord if there's anything if there's anything hanging off of us Lord that's that's keeping us from that lamb condition Lord let it be sheared off Lord take it from us cleanse our hearts cleanse our minds Lord help us to repent of any wrongs that we've done Lord to to to to make a U-turn in the road to turn back to you Lord if some have strayed Lord help them to turn back lord just just speak to them if the if the dove is out

something to say here God bless you I um I wanted to share something that happened the other night with me and Abby I haven't really talked about it with her it's kind of just been on my heart but I've been uh we've been doing um door Dash and delivering food just for some extra money on the side to help out with bills and stuff and um it's really nice having her with me and it's nice having the company and we I picked up an order real cheap order like $4 or something and I W I walked into uh it was a Little Caesar's and there was this this man he was really upset because his card was declining and he was getting frustrated and he was cussing and getting mad at the the lady on the other side of the counter and my order was 10 minutes behind so I thought I'd just commit and just wait for so I was waiting and he was getting more and more frustrated and something in me said to help him out or to pay for it and you know offer at least and I didn't listen to that I didn't I didn't give any attention to that I thought here I am trying to make money I'm like why you know and it was just greedy mindset of mine and and so he he he went back and he's looking at his phone trying to figure it out and this man got his order and he this other person he walked out but after I kind of decided in my my heart that I'm not going to do anything about this this red man he he walked back in he goes up to him and he put his armed on his shoulder and he said hey he said I I think he started with a compliment he's like I really like your hat he's like where did you get that hat at and he's like he's all frustrated he's like I I got at the certain store whatever he's like it's a really nice hat he's like and then he like kind of got a little closer like more maybe to like whisper he's like can I can I buy your food for you you know can I help you out I'll pay for it and the guy he said no no no it's it's fine I and he's like are you sure and the guy's like no I'm I'm fine I got it he's like well have a good night and he walked out and he eventually um ended up leaving and I got my order carried on with my night but it just kept eating at me I'm like if this random man could come in and help him while the Lord's speaking to me to help this person I don't even know who this guy is I don't even know his life or his story who came to offer and help but with what I know and to know the Lord like I do what's my excuse what's what's an extra what's 10 bucks Less in my account to help someone out who's hungry and I just really tore up about it and just like I said I haven't even talked to Abby about this but I'm just disappointed to myself and just take it as a lesson to maybe you know be more willing to let the Lord use me even if it means $10 less in my account like what what does that matter the Lord has all my money under control doesn't matter and he tried to use me and I was unusable and I just just wanted to share that maybe that pothole I stepped in someone could I could just map that out for somebody so they could see it on their path and just say oh there's that P and step around it so hope that's encouraging to you and I just wanted to share that so thank you brother Trevor God bless you amen how many want to be used by the Lord amen let's stand to our feet we'll sing that old Hymn of the church Jesus Use Me Lord please don't refuse me was there any other announcements no oh Jes just use me and Lord don't refuse me for surely there's a work that I can do and even though it's humble Lord help my will to crumble and though
