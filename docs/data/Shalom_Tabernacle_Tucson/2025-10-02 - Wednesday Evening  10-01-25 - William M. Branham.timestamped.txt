[7:29] Brighter than the morning

[7:44] precious, more precious than gold.

[9:05] my heart and soul

[9:11] Oh sweet Jesus,

[9:20] You're precious, more precious

[9:27] Amen. You may be seated. Amen. Let's
[9:32] sing that song. The lily of the valley.
[9:36] Oh, I have found a friend in Jesus. He's
[9:40] everything to me. He's the fairest of
[9:44] 10,000 my soul.
[9:48] the lily of the valley. In him alone I
[9:54] see all I need to cleanse and make me
[9:58] fully whole.
[10:01] Oh in sorrow he's my comfort. In trouble
[10:07] he's my stay. He tells me every care on
[10:12] him to hold. Hallelujah.
[10:15] He's the lily of the valley, the bright
[10:20] and morning star. He's the fairest of
[10:24] 10,000 to my soul.
[10:28] Oh, he all my grief has taken and all my
[10:34] sorrows bore. In temptation, he's my
[10:39] strong and mighty tower.
[10:43] I have all for him forsaken
[10:47] and all my idols torn. Come my heart and
[10:51] now he keeps me by his power.
[10:56] Though though all the world forsake me
[11:00] and Satan temp soar through Jesus I
[11:05] shall safely reach the goal. Hallelujah.
[11:10] He's the lily of the valley, the bright
[11:15] and morning star. He's the perish of
[11:21] to my soul.
[11:23] Listen to this. He will never never
[11:27] leave me, nor yet forsake me here. While
[11:32] I live, I faith to his blessed will.
[11:37] [Music]
[11:38] A wall of fire about me. I'm nothing but
[11:44] fear. With his manly
[11:48] soul shall fill.
[11:51] Oh
[11:54] God, we will see his blessed face.
[11:59] There's
[12:01] a high shall ever hold. Hallelujah.
[12:06] He's the king of valleys, the bright
[12:11] morning star. He's the very
[12:16] to my soul.
[12:19] Oh, he's the lily of the valley, the
[12:24] bright morning star. He's the parish of
[12:29] mountain to my soul.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Isn't he wonderful to you?
[12:38] Amen.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; Let's sing about that song, Till the
[12:42] Storm Passes By. Why should I worry? Why
[12:45] should I fear?
[12:47] Let's start with the chorus there. Oh,
[12:50] why should I worry?
[12:54] Why should I fear?
[12:57] When the very same Jesus,
[13:02] he stays always near.
[13:06] He lives in my heart
[13:09] and he hears when I cry.
[13:13] I'll call on his name till the storm
[13:18] passes by. Why should I worry? And why
[13:22] should I worry?
[13:26] Why should I fear
[13:29] when the Mary St. Jesus
[13:34] stays always near?
[13:37] He lives in my heart
[13:41] and he hears when I cry.
[13:45] I'll call on his name till the storm
[13:50] passes by.
[13:52] Let's go to the first verse.
[13:57] Out on the water,
[14:01] storm raging high.
[14:05] The waters around them were troubled at
[14:10] night.
[14:13] Fear filled their hearts
[14:16] and they felt they would die.
[14:21] They failed to remember.
[14:25] The master was not.
[14:29] And he spoke the words
[14:32] and the winds all stood still.
[14:37] Even the waters
[14:40] they oyed his will.
[14:45] He calmed their storm
[14:48] just like he will mine.
[14:52] If I just remember
[14:56] that he lives deep inside.
[15:00] So why should I wory?
[15:05] Why should I fear?
[15:08] When the Mary save Jesus,
[15:12] he stays always here.
[15:16] He lives in my heart
[15:20] and he hears when I cry.
[15:24] I'll call on his name
[15:27] till the storm passes by.
[15:33] You reading the Bible? Oh, we read in
[15:37] the Bible
[15:40] how he walked with them.
[15:43] Brought light to the darkness
[15:47] when the ways grew so dim.
[15:51] How great it would be
[15:55] to have his steps leading mine
[15:59] and to walk with the master
[16:04] all of the time.
[16:07] And when trials come
[16:11] and death seems so right,
[16:15] I'll call the master.
[16:19] I know he'll be there on time.
[16:23] And when sickness comes
[16:27] and my body in pain,
[16:31] all I have to do
[16:34] is call on his name.
[16:38] So why should I worry?
[16:43] Why should I fear
[16:46] when we're berishing Jesus?
[16:50] He's always so dear.
[16:55] He lives in my heart
[16:58] and he hears when I cry.
[17:02] I'll call his name
[17:06] till the storm pass in his heart. Oh,
[17:10] why should I worry?
[17:15] Why should I fear
[17:18] when the very same Jesus
[17:22] is always so near?
[17:26] He lives in my heart
[17:30] and he hears when I cry.
[17:34] I'll call on his name
[17:38] till the storm passes on.
[17:43] [Music]
[17:45] Oh Jesus,
[17:49] you're the sweetest name of all.
[17:54] Jesus,
[17:57] you always hear me when I call.
[18:03] Jesus,
[18:06] here pick me up each time I fall. You're
[18:11] the sweetest,
[18:13] the sweetest name of all. Let's sing
[18:17] that one more time. Oh Jesus,
[18:23] you're the sweetest name of all.
[18:29] Jesus,
[18:31] you always hear me when I call.
[18:37] Jesus,
[18:40] you pick me up each time I fall. You're
[18:45] the sweetest,
[18:47] the sweetest name of all.
[18:52] Oh
[18:54] Jesus,
[18:57] how I love to praise your name.
[19:02] Jesus,
[19:05] you're still the first, the last, the
[19:09] same. Oh Jesus,
[19:12] [Music]
[19:13] you died and took away my shame.
[19:18] You're the sweetest,
[19:21] the sweetest name of all.
[19:25] Oh
[19:27] Jesus,
[19:30] you're the soon coming.
[19:36] Jesus,
[19:38] we need love and he can bring.
[19:44] Jesus,
[19:46] we lift our voices up and sing. You're
[19:52] the sweetest,
[19:54] the sweetest name of all. Jesus, you're
[19:58] the soon and coming king. Oh Jesus,
[20:02] [Music]
[20:04] you're the soon and king.
[20:09] Jesus,
[20:12] we need the love that you can bring.
[20:17] Oh Jesus.
[20:20] We lift our voices up and sing. You're
[20:25] the sweetest,
[20:28] the sweetest name of all.
[20:33] Amen. As we get ready to change the word
[20:35] of the service, let's all stand.
[20:37] I just want to be where you are.
[20:44] Dwelling daily in your presence.
[20:50] I don't want to worship from afaring
[20:58] where you are. Let's take that off the
[21:01] key.
[21:03] I want to be where you are.
[21:07] Oh, dwelling in your presence.
[21:11] Feasting at your table
[21:15] and surrounded by your glory
[21:20] in your presence.
[21:24] That's where I always want to be.
[21:30] Oh, I just want to be
[21:34] I just want to be with you. Let's take
[21:39] out the key.
[21:41] [Music]
[21:44] I just want to be where you are,
[21:50] dwelling
[21:52] in your presence.
[21:57] I don't want to worship from afar.
[22:03] Draw me in to where you are.
[22:09] Oh, I want to be where you are.
[22:14] Dwelling in your presence.
[22:18] Feasting at your table
[22:22] and surrounded by your glory.
[22:27] your presence.
[22:30] That's where I always want to be.
[22:35] [Music]

[22:41] I just want to be with you. Oh my God.
[22:47] Oh my God.
[22:51] You are my strength and my song.
[22:57] And when I'm in your presence,
[23:01] though I'm weak, you're always strong.
[23:06] Oh, I just want to be where you are.
[23:13] Dwelling daily in your presence.
[23:19] I don't want to worship from afar.
[23:25] Oh, draw me dear to where you are.

[23:39] [Music]
[23:41] Tasting at your table,
[23:43] [Music]
[23:45] surrounded by your glory.
[23:49] In your presence,
[23:53] that's where I always want to be.
[23:57] [Music]
[24:00] I just want to be.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; I just want to be with you.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord bless each of you tonight.
[24:12] God bless you richly. Amen. and welcome
[24:15] you to the house of the Lord. We're
[24:17] going to go and listen to this message,
[24:20] the invasion of the United States. And
[24:22] brother Brandon preaches that he'll
[24:24] start the scripture reading in
[24:26] Chronicles chapter 18. If you want to
[24:29] prepare to turn your there in your
[24:31] Bibles and we thank the Lord for the
[24:35] opportunity to hear this message tonight
[24:38] or a portion of it preached in 1954
[24:41] May the 9th the invasion of the United
[24:45] States.
[24:47] Amen. This is the stored up food that by
[24:49] vision brother Vanom was commanded to
[24:52] store it up. The angel of the Lord told
[24:55] him to do that so that the bride would
[24:58] have something to eat during the time of
[25:02] the famine.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; And we are in a famine. There's a famine
[25:06] in the land today. But the bride has
[25:09] food, good food, clean food, powerful
[25:13] food, anointed food. It is on those
[25:17] tapes. And so we thank God for it
[25:19] tonight. So as we prepare to go there,
[25:21] let's sing this. Only believe.
[25:25] Sing it. Only
[25:28] believe.
[25:29] [Music]
[25:32] Only
[25:34] believe
[25:35] [Music]
[25:37] that all things are possible.
[25:44] Only
[25:46] believe.
[25:50] Only
[25:51] believe.
[25:53] [Music]
[25:55] Only
[25:57] believe.
[26:01] All things are possible
[26:07] only. Let's lift our hands and say,
[26:10] "Lord, I believe."
[26:12] And Lord,
[26:14] I believe.
[26:18] Lord,
[26:20] I believe
[26:23] that all things are possible.
[26:29] Lord, I believe.
[26:35] Lord,
[26:37] I believe.
[26:40] Lord,
[26:42] I believe
[26:46] all things are possible.
[26:52] Lord, I believe.
[26:56] God bless you. You may be seated,
[26:57] Brother Brandham. This was a Mother's
[26:59] Day message that Brother Brandham
[27:01] preached. God bless you. Amen.
[27:26] Now,
[27:28] this this morning in the Old Testament,
[27:32] turning over to Chronicles, I've been
[27:35] just a little bit upset while you're
[27:37] turning now to Chronicles, the 18th
[27:39] chapter. just a little tired. But if the
[27:42] Lord willing, I'm not sure we'll know
[27:45] more Wednesday night. If the Lord
[27:47] willing and the church feels led that
[27:49] way, I like to have Wednesday, Thursday,
[27:52] Friday, Saturday, and Sunday as a
[27:54] revival here. Just a teaching, revival
[27:56] on the word. Wednesday, Thursday,
[27:58] Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Just teaching
[27:59] on the word. Amen. Not healing services,
[28:02] but teaching. Maybe the Lord will lead
[28:04] us that way. and then we I just love to
[28:08] be with you and have a fellowship around
[28:10] the word with you. Thank you very much
[28:12] for that fine wonderful amen. Now in the
[28:16] 18th chapter of Chronicles and beginning
[28:19] with the 12th verse, we wish to base our
[28:22] thoughts just for a little while on this
[28:25] uh vital subject of the day.
[28:29] 1 Chronic or 2 Chronicles, I beg your
[28:31] pardon. 2 Chronicles 18:12
[28:35] and we'll read a portion of it here
[28:39] and um
[28:42] see what our Lord will have us to know.
[28:45] And the messenger that went to call
[28:48] Micah spake to him, saying, Behold the
[28:52] words of the prophets,
[28:55] declare good unto the king with one
[28:58] ascent. Let thy word, therefore, I pray
[29:02] thee, be like one of theirs, and speak
[29:06] thou good. And Micah said, as the Lord
[29:10] liveth, even what my God saith, that
[29:14] will I speak. And when he was come to
[29:18] the king, the king said unto him, Micah,
[29:21] shall we go up to Ramagil to battle, or
[29:25] shall we forebear? and he said, "Go ye
[29:29] up and prosper and they shall be
[29:32] delivered unto your hand." Now to base
[29:36] our thought for a few moments, just one
[29:39] word to him again on this. Our heavenly
[29:42] father, with grateful hearts, we
[29:44] approach thee just now in behalf of lost
[29:47] souls,
[29:49] &gt;&gt; behalf of those who are needy, in behalf
[29:52] of the church. Uh may the Holy Spirit
[29:56] get into the word quickly now we pray.
[29:59] Take it right straight to every heart
[30:00] here that has need. And when he delivers
[30:04] his message of the power of the word
[30:07] into the heart, may we all prosper by it
[30:09] this morning going leaving the
[30:11] tabernacle rejoicing and praising God
[30:14] saying our hearts burns within us
[30:17] because of his presence. For we ask that
[30:20] in his name. Amen. Our
[30:26] scene bases this morning on a tragic and
[30:30] the Old Testament to me is always a
[30:32] shadow or are a forecasting of the New
[30:37] Testament. Many times someone has said,
[30:41] "Brother Bram, why is it you always take
[30:43] the Old Testament?" Nearly always taking
[30:46] a text, you'll go back to the Old
[30:48] Testament. I do it because I like
[30:51] typology. I like my education is very
[30:56] limited as all know and the only way
[30:59] that I know to be somewhere near right
[31:03] is to see what the pattern was to look
[31:05] off the blueprint and see what it was
[31:08] and then I know what that was will be
[31:11] something similar to what this is here
[31:13] because it's just the shadow of it. And
[31:17] I always look back to the Old Testament
[31:18] to see what the children of Israel did,
[31:21] see what the punishment of sin was, see
[31:23] what the justice of the prophets was,
[31:26] see what all those things were, and then
[31:29] I'll have an idea what this issue, which
[31:32] is foreshadowing, what will be in the
[31:34] general wind up at the end. During this
[31:38] time, there had been a great thing
[31:40] happened to Israel. It was in the
[31:42] darkness of its midnight.
[31:45] in the Old Testament. If the Lord
[31:47] willing, maybe in the coming services
[31:50] like to show how that the seven church
[31:53] ages typed out in the Old Testament, how
[31:56] that they began just as Zach at the uh
[31:59] the beginning of the church ages of the
[32:01] Gentile church and went right down
[32:03] through a similar dark age and come out
[32:06] into the glorious time of Pentecost at
[32:10] the falling of the Holy Spirit and the
[32:13] early church of the and the Jewish
[32:16] dispensation then going through another
[32:18] period of the gentile church through a
[32:21] dark age and then coming out again into
[32:23] the millennium at the end. Now
[32:27] how that back in the middle centuries
[32:30] there this great king Ahab came up in
[32:34] power and he was kind of riding on the
[32:37] reputation of the other Israelite kings
[32:39] which was a Ahab himself was kind of a a
[32:43] borderline believer. I've often referred
[32:46] to him that way because he was part of
[32:48] the time on this side of the fence, part
[32:51] of the time on that side of the fence.
[32:53] You can never know where to stand. A man
[32:56] that's unstable like that. Or a person
[32:58] that professes to be a Christian and
[33:00] that unstable, you don't know what to do
[33:03] about the person.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Today they're Christian, tomorrow you
[33:06] don't know where they're at. They're in
[33:08] church. Today they're rejoicing and
[33:09] singing and praising God. and tomorrow
[33:12] out drinking, crowousing, running
[33:14] around. Then that type of a person is
[33:16] hard to do anything with.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; I remember as a boy once we had a an old
[33:22] horse that he used to jump the fences
[33:25] all the time. And I guess many of you
[33:27] men at my age would know back in the
[33:30] horse days, buggy days. I've come a many
[33:33] time right down this street here driving
[33:35] a horse and buggy myself. I'm 45. So
[33:39] they remember this old horse would put a
[33:41] yolk on his neck like you would a cow
[33:43] and keep him from jumping the fence and
[33:45] he'd jump anyhow and he would hang that
[33:48] yolk and turn him around and so forth.
[33:50] He'd get over the fence and one day what
[33:53] he I wondered what was attracting that
[33:55] old fella and there's a big sinkhole
[33:57] down there. Now he was standing in
[33:59] alalfie oh high but he wanted some
[34:02] blades of orchard grass in a sinkhole
[34:05] and he jumped that fence and got in that
[34:08] sinkhole where all these wire and glass
[34:10] where we are are dumped and get in there
[34:13] to get a few mouthfuls of that archer
[34:15] grass and we had to get some more horses
[34:17] and pull him out of that sinkhole. When
[34:20] he got in there, he got hung up. And
[34:21] when he stood out there, he was
[34:22] quivering and bleeding and and how he
[34:25] was just to get a mouthful or two of
[34:28] that orchard grass when he was standing
[34:30] in Alpha Alpha almost to his knees. I've
[34:33] often thought of that picture. A way of
[34:35] a transgressor is hard.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; He just wouldn't stay still where he was
[34:40] eating and having a wonderful time. But
[34:43] the he had to jump the fence and go get
[34:46] all bruised and cut up like that just to
[34:48] get a mouth full of of grass of some
[34:51] other different kind. That's just about
[34:53] the way people does that jumps the fence
[34:55] of God's pastor. Don't you believe that?
[34:58] Gets out,
[34:59] &gt;&gt; go out today, come in in church having a
[35:01] wonderful time, then tomorrow sell out
[35:03] for something like that. It makes it
[35:06] very hard. Ahab was more or less that
[35:09] type of a person. every way the wind
[35:12] blowed. Ahab had his sail set was on
[35:15] this side or that side. His marriage got
[35:18] him all messed up with the a little
[35:21] woman which was a little princess, a
[35:23] king's daughter, a Jezebel, very pretty
[35:26] to look at, very beautiful woman, but in
[35:29] her heart she was wicked and she was an
[35:32] idoltor and she calls all Israel.
[35:36] Now, how would like to border there just
[35:39] for a few minutes? wasn't getting into
[35:40] the core of this on motherhood. See
[35:44] there. And when a man starts to get
[35:46] married, the type of a girl woman that
[35:49] he it's more than just look at beauty.
[35:52] You've got to get somebody both soul and
[35:54] body
[35:56] &gt;&gt; join together. Somebody that's really
[35:58] going to be your friend and pal that'll
[36:01] stick with you through thick and thin.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Now, but Ahab, he just fell apart
[36:06] because she was pretty, I suppose. and
[36:08] Mary. It could be nothing else about her
[36:11] because of wicked as she was and she
[36:14] come over there and then of course being
[36:16] wrapped up with her like that and loved
[36:19] her. Why he caused all Israel to sin and
[36:22] to go against God and to tear down the
[36:24] altars of God build up the altars of
[36:27] Baal and they had Baal worship all
[36:30] through Israel at the time. Now
[36:35] it his wife had called righteous
[36:37] Neabboth. Many of you has read of him
[36:40] how he tuck his garden by the seat swore
[36:43] line had false witnesses against him
[36:45] because she wanted to do something for
[36:47] her husband and killed a righteous man
[36:50] in order to get a garden ad close to the
[36:52] palace land.
[36:55] All this God was looking down. And so
[36:57] the prophet Elijah, which was a great
[37:00] mighty
[37:02] uh servant of the Lord, prophesied and
[37:05] told Jezebel what would happen to her.
[37:07] And he told Ahab that the dogs would
[37:10] lick his own blood.
[37:12] Now when God has said anything, of
[37:16] course them days the direct word of the
[37:19] Lord came through the prophets. God in
[37:22] sun dry times and diverse matters spoke
[37:24] to the fathers through the prophets in
[37:26] this last day through his son Christ
[37:28] Jesus.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; So this is the word.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; And if anything's contrary to that leave
[37:34] it alone.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; See now secondarily he speaks today
[37:38] through the prophet the seer and so
[37:40] forth. But first is this the word.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. down. And Ahab had done this
[37:47] wickedness and he went on God blessing
[37:51] the people for many years. And finally
[37:54] Jehoshaphat was king over Judah while uh
[37:59] Ahab was king over Israel. And then
[38:04] Jehoshaphat was a righteous man. He was
[38:06] the son of Asa. Asa was a a righteous
[38:10] man. and he tore down all the altars of
[38:13] of idols, built up the altars of
[38:15] Jehovah, and they having a a revival as
[38:20] it was up in Judah. And then
[38:24] after a while,
[38:27] Jehoshaphat or Ahab rather sent up and
[38:30] he found out another piece of land in
[38:32] Syria that he thought belonged to him
[38:34] that he thought he'd go get. So he asked
[38:38] this uh Jehoshaphat if he would come and
[38:41] make an alliance with him. And of course
[38:43] there is a great danger. Now see
[38:48] &gt;&gt; when they seen this great king Ahab down
[38:51] there and he's seen this great one up
[38:54] here Jehoshaphat one of them a lukewarm
[38:57] the other a spiritfilled man.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Watch how you make your alliance.
[39:04] Watch what you're doing. how you yoke
[39:07] yourself up with unbelievers.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Keep yourself clean, especially in the
[39:13] day that we're living.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; I believe church without a shadow of
[39:18] doubt.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; This is burned on my heart. That's the
[39:21] reason I'm looking for these five nights
[39:22] soon.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; To want once more before it happens,
[39:27] give this church a third combing through
[39:30] the Bible.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; We're living in the shadows of the time.
[39:34] Amen.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; It could happen any time
[39:37] &gt;&gt; when we see the times come for things to
[39:40] take place. The very wickedness of the
[39:43] enemy, the very powers, we look at these
[39:47] snowstorms and everything happening, all
[39:50] these pestilence,
[39:52] all different things. That's all caused
[39:54] by these interruptions of firing these
[39:57] bombs and things. They're getting things
[40:00] all mixed up here and they're messing
[40:03] around in God's big laboratory to
[40:06] fulfill his word.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; It's going to happen. So, the man of sin
[40:11] rising up power so deceitful.
[40:15] My I heard a minister this morning, a
[40:18] spiritfilled man taking the mark of the
[40:21] beast and saying that the antichrist was
[40:23] Russia. What an era.
[40:27] Russia has nothing to do with it.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; That's scripturally. Now, but notice in
[40:34] this great time that we're living a
[40:37] warning. Now,
[40:39] this Jehoshaphat
[40:41] feeling kind of good because the great
[40:44] king of Israel said, "Come visit me."
[40:47] And he went down there and they took ox
[40:49] and sheep and so forth, done sacrifice
[40:52] all the time in Ahab's heart down there.
[40:56] He was a deceiver because he was not
[40:59] worshiping that or offering those sheep
[41:02] and things with a true heart because
[41:04] after all he leaned more to his wife's
[41:06] religion.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And notice just as Ahab married
[41:12] Jezebel during a time of that great dark
[41:16] age of Israel, he brought idolatry into
[41:20] Israel.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; A very type of today.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just in the dark age when we come
[41:26] out through the early apostles second
[41:28] round third round over into the dark age
[41:30] of 1500 years just as Ahab married
[41:34] Jezebel and brought idolatry into Israel
[41:37] so did the Holy Ghost church marry into
[41:41] isms and brought idolatry back and today
[41:44] it's a form of Christianity
[41:47] &gt;&gt; see just very dark and now it's moved on
[41:51] down each day each church age moves down
[41:54] come to that same thing to the great
[41:55] climax to the lukewarm condition comes
[41:59] lukewarm
[42:01] &gt;&gt; lady of see a church age
[42:03] &gt;&gt; oh what a horrible hour that we're
[42:06] living in
[42:08] &gt;&gt; listen I want to confess right here
[42:11] before I go any further I'm an
[42:14] oldfashioned preacher that's longing to
[42:17] see the old days again
[42:20] &gt;&gt; I've seen so much of this impersonation
[42:23] Hollywood glam hammeredizing the gospel,
[42:26] but I'm so sick and tired of it.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I want to see the old
[42:32] fashioned. I'm afraid we're making
[42:34] Christianity too pretty for people.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Danger line.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Now, Jehoshaphat comes down, thinks,
[42:41] "Oh, well, this great king of Israel,
[42:43] I'll just oh, we it'll be all right."
[42:46] And right in the midst of all this big
[42:48] glamour, what did he do? He made an
[42:51] alliance to go up and to fight the enemy
[42:55] on common grounds because they said, "We
[42:57] are both the same people." But they
[43:00] wasn't.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; One was a spiritfilled group. The other
[43:04] was a lukewarm group.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; We're not the same people.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; No, sir. You can't have darkness. Can't
[43:11] have fellowship of light.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; This the night cannot exist in the
[43:16] presence of the sunlight.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the most treacherous time
[43:20] there is is between the times just when
[43:22] the sun's going down or rising up is the
[43:25] most treacherous time there is. There's
[43:27] not enough vision to see clearly. Your
[43:28] lights won't your automobile won't show
[43:31] uh good and clear. It's better either be
[43:32] dark or light. Jesus said be hot or
[43:36] cold. No lukewarm.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Just that's a danger line. And then
[43:41] Jehoshaphat when he come down and then
[43:43] this great alliance was made which did
[43:46] not please God. And notice just in the
[43:50] time of his all of his excitement now I
[43:53] have got favor with this king and oh I I
[43:56] I have fellowship with this neighbor. I
[43:58] have See be careful that church.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; See help us.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; That's what causes all the trouble
[44:06] around this tabernacle here and around
[44:08] others.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; See be careful that what you're mixing
[44:11] up with. See
[44:13] &gt;&gt; come right out and either be part Christ
[44:15] or be against him. Amen.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Now
[44:19] &gt;&gt; this fellow made the alliance and he
[44:21] thought he had done something great yet
[44:23] when he said isn't there now before we
[44:25] can go up we should consult the Lord
[44:28] about this. Now Jehoshaphat had enough
[44:30] religion left in him and his mistake
[44:32] that he had went down there to this king
[44:35] but he had enough religion left in him
[44:36] to think well we ought to at least
[44:38] consult the Lord. Now, Ahab is going
[44:41] right on out without saying a word. Just
[44:44] his own mechanical, physical, human uh
[44:48] way of doing things. I just wonder right
[44:52] here, church, if that hasn't been a lot
[44:55] of times we've made mistakes,
[44:58] &gt;&gt; figure it out and say, "Well, it ought
[45:00] to be this way and we've set it like
[45:02] that." I think that's where a whole lot
[45:04] of the American evangelism is today.
[45:07] That we have said it in a form of of I'd
[45:12] say Hollywood evangelism. Whole lot
[45:15] about uh glamour. We notice the
[45:18] evangelist comes to the platform today
[45:21] and my is all puffed out and tells a
[45:23] whole lot of uh jokes before he starts
[45:26] the preaching and things like that and
[45:28] carries on and acts like a clown in the
[45:30] pull pit. When it comes time to make an
[45:32] altar call, the people don't even see
[45:33] any sincerity to make an altar call by.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; And that's right. That's the reason the
[45:38] world's got a lukewarm condition the day
[45:41] that it's in.
[45:42] I wonder today it's just today uh uh the
[45:46] church we tried to send our boys to
[45:49] school to learn psychology and so forth
[45:52] like that to know how to put over a
[45:54] program to get in the pull pit to
[45:56] arrange our the message is so enticing
[46:00] that it'll catch the people and catch
[46:02] their attention and many of great
[46:04] psychologists go out as teachers like
[46:06] that and dramatize and put on a whole
[46:09] lot of something and I just wonder when
[46:12] If that we are always telling them the
[46:14] beauty and the attraction of the church,
[46:17] but we fail to tell them, he that will
[46:20] follow me, let him deny himself, pick up
[46:22] his cross and follow me.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we haven't made the beauty
[46:26] of the church too pretty for the fellow
[46:28] that comes in. For instance, the Baptist
[46:30] church today got a slogan, a million
[46:33] more and 44 taking in members by the
[46:37] thousands and the tens of thousands
[46:39] unconverted. Amen.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Just people who walk in and join the
[46:44] church.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; And it's an endamment to the church of
[46:47] Jesus Christ to take such members in.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; They still drink. They still smoke. They
[46:53] still gamble. They still lie. They come
[46:56] to the church expecting to be
[46:57] entertained by a bunch of Hollywood
[46:59] evangelists that gets up put on a lot of
[47:01] glamour, a lot of big instruments
[47:03] setting up down on the platform when
[47:04] they ought to have an old fashioned god
[47:07] for hang out altar call down where men
[47:10] and women don't come to glamorize or to
[47:13] run up and act a clown, but to get out
[47:15] the altar and realize that the death of
[47:17] Jesus Christ there died for them that
[47:19] they're getting back sincere with God
[47:21] again. Amen.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we're not living in that
[47:25] kind of a time.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Why we take great evangelists like many
[47:29] it's crossing the lands today of great
[47:33] known evangelists who study psychology
[47:35] and attract the people to the church but
[47:37] if he wants to get them into the church
[47:39] then what's he going to do to them?
[47:42] &gt;&gt; What what are they going to happen after
[47:43] they get into the church? Just join the
[47:45] church. They go back with the same sin
[47:47] and the same desire that they come into
[47:49] the church with. They go back the same
[47:51] way. And that's the reason today the
[47:53] world looks on said, well, if that man
[47:55] got religion, if this person got
[47:57] religion, I'm afraid we've made it too
[48:00] easy.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; It's I love I think joy certainly I
[48:05] believe that all joys lays in Jesus
[48:08] Christ.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. I believe it's joyful and
[48:11] happy. But remember, brother, it's a way
[48:14] of agony and suffering in the cross. You
[48:17] must realize that, too.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord. That's right. I
[48:20] wonder if we had painted a little too a
[48:22] little too smooth. Like I was looking at
[48:24] my wife put started out and she put a
[48:27] rose on my coat this morning. She said,
[48:29] "You ought to wear it. Your mother's a
[48:31] living." And I said, "Oh, honey, I don't
[48:33] know. Mother's Day is wonderful, but
[48:36] that's like the world. They've
[48:37] commercialized the thing just merely to
[48:40] sell flowers and things like that. Why?
[48:42] It's a discredit to mother.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Why my mother's my mother every day and
[48:47] a year." Yes, sir. Not just one day I'll
[48:50] say you love your mother. I sent her a
[48:51] bouquet of flowers last Mother's Day.
[48:53] Well, brother, she ought to be mother
[48:55] every day. But it's commercial. That
[48:58] flower is pretty. I love a pretty
[49:01] flower. I think of that just like I do.
[49:03] How pretty the flower is. It blooms and
[49:06] it's got fragrance and the passer by
[49:08] smells it. The animal comes by, smells
[49:11] it. But now look, it's pretty like the
[49:14] church of the Lord Jesus Christ. It's
[49:16] the most glorious thing. divine healings
[49:18] and powers and wonders and signs and
[49:21] miracles and freedom from sin. It's a
[49:24] beautiful place. But look, if that rose
[49:29] will have to come to church like all
[49:31] nature, that rose being pretty ever
[49:35] counted country would lick on it if she
[49:37] could. But nature provided a little
[49:40] bandits, a little spear sticking out
[49:42] there called thorns, and they leave them
[49:44] away. That protects it. That's exactly.
[49:48] And I think today if we haven't got the
[49:50] word of God sharper than a two-edged
[49:52] sword around the beauty of the power of
[49:54] the holiness of God, we're going to let
[49:56] every cow come on it and call it. It'll
[49:59] gone. It'll be an endement to the
[50:01] church. That's right. I think today what
[50:05] we need is more oldfashioned God call
[50:10] ministers wrong. Maybe not with much
[50:13] education,
[50:14] &gt;&gt; but it'll bring the people down to an
[50:15] altar in their agoniz, not with a joy
[50:18] and laughing and popping and chewing gum
[50:20] and put their name on a paper.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; But rather an old cry out and dying out
[50:25] until men and women thoroughly repent
[50:28] from their sins and come close to God.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; I tell you, we've got raise up your
[50:35] hands. Who wants to accept Christ? All
[50:36] like that. That's all right, brother.
[50:38] But that don't that don't expel sin.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; You've got to repent first.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Get right.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Get down there and really cry out. I can
[50:50] remember the times in the old fashioned
[50:52] people would walk down through the
[50:53] aisles and up and down the roads of
[50:55] crying and talking to their neighbors.
[50:57] That was Christians of that day. Tell
[51:00] them about the things of the Lord. And
[51:02] today we put our name on the church book
[51:04] and go out and stay home and never say a
[51:06] word about it unconcerned. Just as long
[51:08] as we belong to the church, it's all
[51:10] right.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; I'm sure we're wrong there, people.
[51:14] Check up.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; For that won't stand in the judgment.
[51:18] No, sir. It won't nothing less. He that
[51:20] will follow me, let him deny himself.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Take up his cross and die daily.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Stay dead in the cross.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Agony. The way I'll take the way you
[51:35] sing with the Lord's despised few. Amen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; I think today what a time that we're
[51:40] living in that evangelism they put it
[51:44] out great big bright lights and they try
[51:46] when you see the evangelist coming to
[51:48] town you wonder I my meetings has been
[51:51] guilty the same. That's right. I wonder
[51:55] who's coming to town sometime the
[51:57] evangelist or Jesus Christ.
[51:59] While they got I went into a place long
[52:02] ago where a certain evangelist is
[52:03] supposed to come and Jesus name while
[52:06] they had a the picture of the evangelist
[52:07] the man of the hour. The man's with this
[52:10] and the man with that. I sometimes I
[52:13] think of my ministry and see people
[52:15] coming. I get in a hotel room say God
[52:18] who who's the people coming to see me or
[52:20] you see
[52:22] &gt;&gt; if they're coming to see me they're lost
[52:24] yet but oh God tear me down and take me
[52:28] away. I want to represent you.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; One who will stand before someday with
[52:34] trembling hands and trembling feeble
[52:36] body. Look at that. See, knowing my soul
[52:39] hangs be your decision. Let us exalt
[52:42] Christ.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Today they say, "Well, I belong to the
[52:45] Baptist. I'm a Methodist. I'm a belong
[52:48] to the tabernacle. I do this." Oh, that
[52:50] has nothing to do with it.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Not a thing.
[52:54] I wonder sometime here not long ago I
[52:56] seen a an advertisement up for a certain
[52:59] campaign was coming to the city and the
[53:01] word of the man the man's name run great
[53:03] big letters all the way around like that
[53:05] and on the bottom in a little corner
[53:07] said Jesus Christ the same yesterday day
[53:09] and forever way down in the corner
[53:13] &gt;&gt; see they took all the sacredness from
[53:16] Christ and put it on to some man or some
[53:19] church or some organization
[53:21] &gt;&gt; brother I'm saying you can get by with
[53:23] glamour Hollywood crowning like that in
[53:25] the by the church, but in the presence
[53:27] of Jesus Christ, he's the one to be
[53:29] glorified.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Now, that's the truth, my dear brother
[53:34] and sister.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Don't feel angry at me. You just
[53:38] remember that I'm preaching you. I want
[53:40] to preach as this. This is the last
[53:42] sermon I'd ever preached in my life.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; I want to preach every sermon I preach
[53:46] as if I was a dying man preaching to
[53:49] dying man.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; And I am. Amen.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; My light's burning down every day. Yours
[53:55] is too. And we're dying mortals. And we
[53:58] got to face the living God some of these
[53:59] days. And we better be in deep sincerity
[54:02] about this.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Just instead of glamour and carry on and
[54:06] join the church and go here and there,
[54:08] act this way and that way, we better be
[54:10] having oldfashioned prayer meetings in
[54:11] our homes and crying out to God day and
[54:14] night.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; The day is at hand. The time of
[54:18] distress, the time of trouble. The Bible
[54:21] said a dark day and we're living in it.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; How that this great man went out there
[54:27] under the excitement he joined himself
[54:30] with the lukewarms
[54:32] with the border lines and thought he was
[54:34] doing something great. thought that God
[54:36] was a blessing and not realizing it
[54:39] right then he was bringing in all this
[54:42] group with him while our little group of
[54:45] of Judah up here will come down and join
[54:47] oursel with a great
[54:50] bands of Israel
[54:52] &gt;&gt; what a mighty people we'll be
[54:55] &gt;&gt; there you are and that's the very line
[54:58] of deceit the devil's using right now to
[55:00] bring in the antichrist that's a certain
[55:02] &gt;&gt; as I'm standing into this will unite our
[55:06] efforts together.
[55:08] We can't do that.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; How can two walk together except they be
[55:12] agreed?
[55:13] &gt;&gt; This United States made the same self
[55:16] same experience and the same mistake
[55:19] went united with Russia back on earth at
[55:20] the time they just about ready to have
[55:22] war and bound ourselves together with
[55:25] Russia. And now you see what we got,
[55:27] don't you? We got our airplanes and all
[55:28] of our secrets and our atomic bombs and
[55:30] everything went over there and blew it
[55:31] back at us.
[55:33] Same thing goes by spiritual. Then we
[55:36] find out after Jehoshaphat had made this
[55:39] alliance and they consulted. Now watch
[55:42] the outside world. He said sure we've
[55:46] got plenty of prophets down here. We got
[55:49] a seminary full of them. They go down
[55:51] and get the fellows that have been
[55:53] trained who know psychology who know all
[55:56] about it. So come up now and we're
[55:59] asking to consult the Lord. All of them,
[56:01] of course, in their fleshly, puffed up
[56:03] mind, come up there and said, "Now look,
[56:06] we you go on up. The Lord is with you,
[56:09] and the Lord's going to give you that
[56:10] piece of land up there that it's going
[56:13] to be yours. You're going to push the
[56:14] Syrians all the way back. You're going
[56:16] to do it." One of them eating there
[56:18] itself, a big pair of iron horns, begin
[56:20] to run around like this, and this is
[56:22] what you're going to push the Syrians
[56:23] away. But Jehoshaphat
[56:26] just a little more spiritual.
[56:29] put up with that Tommy rod of clowning.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; God, give us some more Jehoshap.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Sick and tired of this year Hollywood
[56:40] clowning.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Putting on, pretending to be something
[56:46] that they're not.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Making out, dramatizing, drawing in, and
[56:52] then when they come in, what you got
[56:53] when he got in?
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Like asking a man come swimming in a
[56:57] desert? nothing but bay sand up on your
[57:00] head to cause sorrows afterwards.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Now notice what can you bring them into?
[57:07] A certain lady said to me the other day
[57:10] a man said I'd go to church but why what
[57:13] would it get if I went to church said
[57:15] all they do is organize some supper and
[57:17] they about this that and the other and
[57:19] the lady said I stood speechless for I
[57:22] didn't know where to send him. There you
[57:24] are. Said, "I wish I could find an old
[57:26] church where they really sing the
[57:28] oldfashioned hymns and live godly."
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Children are hungry. They'll eat from a
[57:35] garbage can.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; It's up to the church of the living God
[57:40] to feed them the true living word of the
[57:42] of God.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; There all that glamour and stuff.
[57:49] Jehoshaphat said, "Isn't there one
[57:52] more?" "One more," said Ahab. "Well,
[57:56] what do you need with any one more?
[57:58] We've got 400 of the best selected,
[58:03] educated, top, fed, dressed man there is
[58:07] in a country standing here, every one of
[58:09] them with one accord and one heart and
[58:12] one boy saying, "Go, God is with you."
[58:15] I wonder if the United States hasn't met
[58:18] the same thing.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; I wonder if the church of God hasn't met
[58:22] the same thing.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; I wonder.
[58:27] Well, say, "Look, they're having
[58:28] success. They're having great big
[58:30] meetings. They're carrying thousands at
[58:32] a time. But I wonder if there isn't just
[58:36] one more."
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; I wonder if there isn't something
[58:40] different. Yeah,
[58:41] &gt;&gt; we find out we have 30,000 converts in 6
[58:44] weeks and 6 weeks later we haven't got a
[58:46] one.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; There's something wrong somewhere.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; And it's all glamour putting on the
[58:57] world through television, through radio,
[58:59] through picture shows and those outlets
[59:01] there has corrupted this nation with the
[59:04] Tommy Rod of Hollywood.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Right. Everything wants to be in big
[59:09] glamour.
[59:10] Isn't that the truth?
[59:11] &gt;&gt; You know that's the truth. We don't have
[59:14] any more of the oldfashioned religion
[59:16] that we used to have
[59:17] &gt;&gt; years ago. It's because it's been laid
[59:20] down. We'll get to it just in a moment.
[59:23] You'll see why. What a beautiful picture
[59:27] or a staring picture I should say. And
[59:30] here come this Jehoshaphat said, "Yes, I
[59:33] see them all there." Everyone got their
[59:36] degrees and whatever it was, they're all
[59:38] to be prophets or great ministers.
[59:41] They're out of great colleges and
[59:42] they're all this there out of the big
[59:44] school of the prophet and everything.
[59:46] They're all with one accord. That's
[59:48] true. But isn't there just one more?
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Well, what will you do with one more
[59:53] when 400 is giving consent at one time?
[59:56] But that man weighed down in his heart
[59:59] had God.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; He knew that there was something wrong
[1:00:03] about that. Yes, sir. They know there
[1:00:06] was something rotten. Why? Let me give
[1:00:08] you the scripture doesn't quote it. But
[1:00:10] here's what I get. I know that that
[1:00:13] Jehoshaphat knew that that hypocrite
[1:00:16] down there, Ahab, that he wasn't right
[1:00:19] with God and Elijah had prophesied the
[1:00:22] word of God to him. And how could God
[1:00:25] bless what he had cursed? Amen.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; I say the same thing today, friend. And
[1:00:30] the church of the living God who's
[1:00:31] standing true to God will say the same
[1:00:33] thing. You can't mix oil and water
[1:00:35] together and call it salvation.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; You can't.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; You got to separate yourself, brother.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Something's got to happen.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; If there's any hope left, we got to do
[1:00:47] something and do it quickly.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; For the hour of the rapture is at hand.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Things are heaping up.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Everything in the church is so far away.
[1:00:57] They read all kinds of magazines, books,
[1:00:59] stories and everything. I could go to
[1:01:01] day to I can go to a church and I can
[1:01:03] say, "Well, uh, how many know they know
[1:01:06] every hymn after one of these big
[1:01:07] revival and what what page is certain
[1:01:09] certain him on?" They know it. They know
[1:01:11] who it is. They know who's running for
[1:01:13] president, who's running for this, and
[1:01:15] how many movie stars married this and
[1:01:17] that, the other, but the word of God
[1:01:19] they know nothing of.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; There you are. So, we're giving her and
[1:01:23] yet they profess to be Christians. My
[1:01:26] God.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; And the people's not in blame. It's from
[1:01:28] behind the platform where it's come
[1:01:30] from.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Exactly. It's behind the platform. They
[1:01:36] teach them all kinds of rhythms and all
[1:01:37] kinds of this and that and organizations
[1:01:40] how to make youth groups and everything
[1:01:42] like that. I wonder if it's paid.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Nothing against it, but I'm wondering if
[1:01:47] that's God's requirement. When Jesus
[1:01:49] said, "Except the man be born of water
[1:01:51] and spirit, he'll in no wise enter into
[1:01:53] the kingdom." He that will
[1:01:57] follow after me, let him deny himself in
[1:01:59] his own worldly pleasures, take up his
[1:02:01] cross and follow after me. Cross is a
[1:02:04] symbol of death,
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; agony.
[1:02:09] He that will be a Christian, let him
[1:02:11] strip himself of his own, let him strip
[1:02:14] himself of his own works, let him strip
[1:02:17] himself of everything, denying himself
[1:02:20] and take up that consecrated cross and
[1:02:22] follow me daily. Hallelujah.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; He that will come after me,
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; let him do that.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus said. But today we say
[1:02:31] everybody have a big time. Everybody
[1:02:33] clap their hands. Everybody holler
[1:02:34] hallelujah. Everybody do this. Oh, we
[1:02:36] got a bunch of fuss.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; God, we get these new songs out and sing
[1:02:43] them so fast that it looks like we're
[1:02:45] going to run through the wall with them
[1:02:46] or something like that. But I think if
[1:02:48] we'd be singing near my God to thee, it
[1:02:51] would be a whole lot better for the
[1:02:52] church.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:54] The oldfashioned hymns get a lot of
[1:02:56] dance orchestra people. Some boy in a
[1:02:58] dance orchestra over here playing last
[1:03:00] night and tonight over here playing in
[1:03:02] the church of the living God. It's an
[1:03:04] abomination in the sight of God.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Let that man be proved first and let him
[1:03:09] bring forth pro meet our repentance to
[1:03:12] show that he's right with God.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; They bring the jazz world right into the
[1:03:17] platform.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; They bring up Hollywood glamorizing
[1:03:20] preaching right into the platform. Amen.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Why didn't I sit in your fair city a few
[1:03:24] weeks ago in Louisville, Kentucky? My
[1:03:26] heart break when it's all sitting there
[1:03:29] willing to see the miracles of God, but
[1:03:30] as soon as you preach the gospel, they
[1:03:32] fill up in a second and turn their backs
[1:03:34] and walk out of the building.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Certainly, they don't want it. Their
[1:03:39] hearts are hard and stick out. And many
[1:03:41] of them Protestants too who go to
[1:03:43] Protestant churches, but they've been
[1:03:45] fail filled so full of glamour and
[1:03:48] everything like that and Tommy rotten
[1:03:49] churchism until they know nothing about
[1:03:51] the spirit of the living God.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Having a form of godliness and denying
[1:03:56] the power thereof.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; What a day that we're living. Watch
[1:04:00] where he Jehosapus said, I know Ahab.
[1:04:04] There's your 400 preachers. They're all
[1:04:06] fine looking fellas. Every one of them
[1:04:08] dressed in their hair combed neatly and
[1:04:09] everything. whatever more they may be.
[1:04:11] They may have their DDs, they may have
[1:04:13] their all kinds of degrees, they may
[1:04:15] know the scriptures from A to Z, but
[1:04:17] haven't you got one more somewhere?
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Isn't there just one more somewhere?
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes, there's one more, but I
[1:04:27] hate him." There you are.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; I hate him. Amen.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Remember Ahab was a religious man
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; and these were religious teachers,
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; but they hated this man who had the
[1:04:41] truth.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; But I hate him.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Said he's always better out something
[1:04:48] against me. How could he keep from doing
[1:04:51] it?
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; When the word of God had condemned him.
[1:04:55] How can you hold still if you're a man
[1:04:57] of God or a woman of God and know and
[1:04:59] see sin and things heaped and waited and
[1:05:01] everything like that and see human souls
[1:05:04] going to hell millions a day
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; and stand still you can't do it.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Someone said to me they said you think
[1:05:11] you can stop it. I said, "No, I can't
[1:05:14] stop it." Cuz God said, "But one day at
[1:05:16] the judgment board, they're going to
[1:05:17] pull out the big screen flash on the
[1:05:19] camera and that tape recorder is going
[1:05:22] to be playing. I'm going to stand to
[1:05:23] listen at it. I'll hear my voice warning
[1:05:26] against it.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; God will judge me when my voice comes
[1:05:29] against it."
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. When we see this life, this
[1:05:33] generation reenacted again at the
[1:05:35] judgment. Certainly, we're living in a
[1:05:38] terrible time. There it is. We seen it.
[1:05:41] He said, "Isn't there one more?" He
[1:05:42] said, "Yes, but I hate him. For he's
[1:05:44] always prophesying evil against me." How
[1:05:47] can he keep from preaching those hard
[1:05:48] things?
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; When he sees it going on, see Ahab
[1:05:52] living like he was and doing like he was
[1:05:53] and bringing the people like you are.
[1:05:55] How can a man of God or a woman of God
[1:05:58] keep from hollering out and rebuking sin
[1:06:00] from every side when they see these
[1:06:02] lukewarm preachers and glamatizers and
[1:06:05] educators and so forth like that out?
[1:06:07] Let the people go to hell by the
[1:06:08] millions utter deceit.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; A lot of even in holiness people
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking so much about Methodist
[1:06:17] and Baptist and things like that. They
[1:06:18] have it too. But it's right down in your
[1:06:20] own ranks
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; by coming to the platform like
[1:06:26] everything else. Christians
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; living like everything else across the
[1:06:30] countries and things. Then they call it
[1:06:32] religion. It's a religion but it's a
[1:06:34] long ways from the salvation of the
[1:06:35] Lord. That's right. They've just got the
[1:06:38] people to just a big bunch of worked up.
[1:06:40] Then as soon as the little work up goes
[1:06:42] over, then the first thing you know, you
[1:06:43] can't find a one of them. The church is
[1:06:45] set and empty. Brother, if a man loves
[1:06:47] God, he'll fill his seat in the church
[1:06:49] every time. We can't stay away from it.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, notice just a few
[1:06:56] minutes. I'll try to hurry. Get straight
[1:06:58] to the point now cuz the time's getting
[1:07:00] away. Notice that he said, "Isn't there
[1:07:03] one more?" He said, "Yes, but I hate
[1:07:04] him." He's always prophesying against
[1:07:07] me. He's saying evil things against me.
[1:07:09] All right. He said, "Go get him." He
[1:07:11] said, "His name is Micah." But this man
[1:07:13] had enough religion to know that these
[1:07:15] fellows wasn't right.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; And any man that's ever been touched the
[1:07:19] least bit by the spirit of God knows
[1:07:21] that these things what's called
[1:07:22] Christianity today is not right.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; You can't love the world or the things
[1:07:28] of the world.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; If you do, the love of God's not in you.
[1:07:31] The Bible said so.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:34] the name of the Lord.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:07:36] look, he said, "Go get him." And they
[1:07:39] went over and then he sent a little old
[1:07:41] messenger along, the deacon of the
[1:07:43] church perhaps or somebody
[1:07:46] said, "Now look, Micah, we're going to
[1:07:48] bring you over here before Ahab and
[1:07:50] Jehoshaphat." Now they're both sitting
[1:07:52] out there and they're a great man now.
[1:07:54] They're teachers and they're scholars
[1:07:56] and they got their degree and so forth.
[1:07:58] And every one of our seminary, every one
[1:08:01] of our churches here is a perfect at
[1:08:03] agreement that this is the will of the
[1:08:06] Lord.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Now, you say the same thing they say.
[1:08:09] And I tell you, you'll dress better and
[1:08:11] ride the Cadillac car. I'll tell you,
[1:08:13] you'll just be a great fellow if you'll
[1:08:15] do that. Yes, sir. You'll prosper. Micah
[1:08:18] said the Lord God lives. I'll only say
[1:08:21] what God says.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, there's a man in my heart.
[1:08:26] Amen.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; I may have to eat bread and water, which
[1:08:28] he did for doing it.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; He may be smothe,
[1:08:32] but he told the truth and stood by. God
[1:08:35] confirmed it to be the truth.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; He wasn't so popular, but he know God.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Little old Mike over there. He said,
[1:08:44] "All right, Micah, what do you say about
[1:08:46] it?" He said, "Go on up. Go on up."
[1:08:49] Said, "Go up in peace. Go ahead and
[1:08:51] prosper. That's what I want you to do.
[1:08:53] But I seen the Israelites sheep without
[1:08:55] a shepherd on a hill scattered.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; I said, he said, "And when he did like
[1:09:00] that and Ahab turned around to
[1:09:02] Jehoshaphat said, what I tell you that
[1:09:04] holy ruler or what, excuse me, or
[1:09:06] whatever it was, that guy said that,
[1:09:07] what I tell you that fell would only
[1:09:09] prophesy e evil against me. What I say
[1:09:12] only condemn our church and condemn our
[1:09:14] ministers and condemn our way of
[1:09:16] religion?"
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; What do I tell you? He said, "I know
[1:09:19] him. I know his daddy before him.
[1:09:24] Hallelujah.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; I know his daddy before him.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. A real man of God. Said, I
[1:09:30] know he'd say that. And so then he said,
[1:09:33] yes. Said, I saw Israelite sheep uh
[1:09:36] scattered without a shepherd on the
[1:09:38] hill. And so then he said, I and then
[1:09:41] one of those fellows that had the big
[1:09:43] horns to go to push off, a preacher
[1:09:46] walked over and pulled little Mike
[1:09:47] around and smacked him in the mouth as
[1:09:48] hard as he could. Said, which way did
[1:09:50] the spirit of God go when it went out of
[1:09:52] me? if you know said he said wait till
[1:09:54] you're sitting in prison over here and
[1:09:56] you'll know which way it went.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. Wait till Russia's sitting
[1:09:59] out here taking over the nations and
[1:10:00] things like that in this country because
[1:10:02] of its backsliding and you'll see what
[1:10:03] was right and wrong.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; You see where your lukewarm religion
[1:10:08] will pay off or not.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Let this nation come to tears,
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; not come to laughter and drama.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Let this nation come to its knees and
[1:10:16] repentance.
[1:10:17] [Applause]
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; That's what we need. not a revival to
[1:10:21] get a whole lot of people in a church.
[1:10:22] We need to close every bootleg j. Stop
[1:10:25] old cigarette smoking. Carry on the
[1:10:27] patriots. Start up a real old fashioned
[1:10:30] Holy Ghost campaign for men and women
[1:10:32] day and night laying on their face
[1:10:33] crying. I'll tell you it'll be the
[1:10:35] greatest shelter
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; that this nation's ever had.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Let the brand tabernacle quit its
[1:10:43] foolishness.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Let it get back here at the altar and
[1:10:46] get right with God. Make up with the
[1:10:47] neighbors and so forth like that and get
[1:10:49] right with God. You won't have any
[1:10:50] fussing and going on.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; It'll be the drawing spot of the world.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Now, that's the truth. Then he said,
[1:11:00] "Which way the spirit of God go out of
[1:11:01] me?" And Micah said, "I saw God and his
[1:11:05] host, his counsel sitting in glory." You
[1:11:09] know, God has a counsel up there once in
[1:11:11] a while.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; He he brings up his his angelic beings
[1:11:14] and holds a a council once in a while up
[1:11:16] in heaven. And he said, "I saw him
[1:11:18] sitting up on the throne and all the
[1:11:20] people were standing on the right and
[1:11:21] left hand of him." And it said they were
[1:11:23] discussing who can we get to go down and
[1:11:27] deceive Ahab to get him out here to
[1:11:28] fulfill Elijah's prophecy.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; God's done said so what was going to
[1:11:33] happen. So we'll just see who can go
[1:11:35] down. And a lying spirit come up from
[1:11:39] beneath of course out of hell. come up
[1:11:41] before God and said, "I'll go down and
[1:11:44] I'll get in those preachers and cause
[1:11:46] them all to prophesy a lie."
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, did that blow him up?
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Did that make them feel funny? Well, he
[1:11:54] said, "I'll go down cause those
[1:11:55] preachers, every one of them, to
[1:11:57] prophesy a lie." And he got out and got
[1:11:59] in those preachers and they begin to
[1:12:01] prophesy a lie. And brother, the same
[1:12:04] God rules on the same throne today.
[1:12:07] Amen.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; And that same lying spirit has done the
[1:12:11] same thing today.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Prophesying lies. They kept saying
[1:12:16] peace, peace, peace at the first world
[1:12:18] war. Let me show you where it come from.
[1:12:20] In the first world war, when France over
[1:12:23] there turned away from God in their gay
[1:12:25] 90s and begin now, I'm going to get a
[1:12:27] little moral. So you all just sit real
[1:12:28] quiet for a few minutes. Look all back
[1:12:31] there in the beginning over in France.
[1:12:33] There's where honoring this and Phil
[1:12:35] first began. Amen.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; If there ever was a rat hole in the
[1:12:38] world, it's Paris, France.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; And I've pretty traveled to most of it,
[1:12:41] and that's the worst place I ever seen.
[1:12:43] And London, England's not much of an
[1:12:45] exception. And the United States is kind
[1:12:47] of right in line with it.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; There they are. Every time that you
[1:12:53] break the morals of womanhood, you break
[1:12:55] the backbone of the nation.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Here, you go over in our own countries
[1:13:00] and say you're a missionary. They don't
[1:13:01] like say, "What are you going to tell us
[1:13:02] to do? How to sing dirty songs about our
[1:13:04] wives or about our girls? You go to tell
[1:13:06] us how to divorce our wives, teach us
[1:13:09] how to drink whiskey and go the way we
[1:13:11] do. That's what we are. We call
[1:13:12] ourselves the religious nation, the
[1:13:14] Christian nation. Well, then heathens in
[1:13:16] Africa can teach us morals how to live.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; The rottest placement in the United
[1:13:20] States or the world is this nation. How
[1:13:23] it's got I'm an American certainly. But
[1:13:25] brother before Ahab or Jehoshaphat, I've
[1:13:28] got to tell what God says is the truth.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; That's what the church needs to stand
[1:13:32] for today. If it comes between nation
[1:13:34] and God, it's God always.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Yesterday, notice in France, they start
[1:13:40] all their rockness and going on the way
[1:13:42] they lived over there. And then God sent
[1:13:45] Germany into them to beat them up a
[1:13:46] little bit. Then we went over there to
[1:13:48] save their hide. And as soon as we done
[1:13:50] that and won the war, sent the Germans
[1:13:53] back, had peace with France, did they
[1:13:55] turn to God? No, sir. women, wine,
[1:13:58] debauchery, sin, filth to the gills.
[1:14:02] Then what did he do? What happened?
[1:14:04] Here's where he started. The devil set
[1:14:07] up his headquarters there. There's where
[1:14:09] he started right there to demoralize the
[1:14:12] world from Paris, France. Then if you
[1:14:14] notice, he couldn't get in here through
[1:14:16] the ministry. So a thing he done was
[1:14:18] come into Hollywood out here. He set up
[1:14:21] his he set up his headquarters over here
[1:14:23] in Hollywood. The devil landed back here
[1:14:26] a few years ago, 15 or 20 years ago,
[1:14:29] with his great army and went hit in
[1:14:31] Hollywood, California, and he's invaded
[1:14:34] the United States with his demon powers.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; All of our passions come from Paris.
[1:14:42] They get into Hollywood onto the
[1:14:44] screens. These little girls and little
[1:14:45] boys and things here, they watch them
[1:14:47] screen plays. Nice little kitties,
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; fine little fellows. Nothing against
[1:14:52] them. God bless your little hearts. My
[1:14:54] heart bleeds for him.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; And right here in the city, I was
[1:14:58] talking to my one of my boy the other
[1:15:00] day. He said, "Daddy, if there's just
[1:15:02] some boys around there in town that had
[1:15:03] the Holy Ghost and so forth, you wonder
[1:15:05] why I was getting away to Denver,
[1:15:06] Colorado, somewhere I could get my
[1:15:08] children somewhere where there's a bunch
[1:15:10] of people who cry out to God."
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; What we need, brother, this country,
[1:15:15] this nation, this city, this place has
[1:15:17] become so demoralized till it's pitiful.
[1:15:20] If I could only express right now what I
[1:15:22] absolutely know to be the truth right
[1:15:24] here,
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; it wouldn't even be presentable before a
[1:15:27] mixed audience right here in his own
[1:15:29] city right here. Not only here but other
[1:15:31] places everywhere.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; It's begin to come simply because why?
[1:15:36] The people look friends, it's got so
[1:15:38] cunning. It's coming so easy till it
[1:15:41] just smothers you down.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; The devil used to be in fashions. He
[1:15:46] might have went out of fashions, but he
[1:15:48] didn't go out of business. I'll tell you
[1:15:49] that he's still in business.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Look, today we take like I said a while
[1:15:54] ago about the little lady, the little
[1:15:56] girl, the rose. For instance, a rose is
[1:15:59] pretty. It's there to be looked at.
[1:16:01] That's true. And that's just like the
[1:16:03] church is there to be looked at. Like a
[1:16:05] pretty little woman, she's there to be
[1:16:07] looked at. That's right. But if she
[1:16:09] she's fine, that's she's to her husband.
[1:16:12] She's she's all right. But if she hasn't
[1:16:14] got the moral sword sticking out there
[1:16:16] to protect her, she becomes an endement
[1:16:18] to society and human beings.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; She's so low and scandalous and rotten
[1:16:24] till the dogs would look at her.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; And the same thing to the church of the
[1:16:29] living God.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; They get out here and try to glamorize
[1:16:32] and fix themselves up and act like they
[1:16:34] stripped their women here. Right. And
[1:16:36] people don't realize that these devils
[1:16:37] is invading your homes.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Right. In my neighborhood the other day,
[1:16:41] a young lady, which I think is a nice
[1:16:43] woman, and she's a married woman, got a
[1:16:45] child, and a little woman come out
[1:16:47] there, man come down the road to do some
[1:16:49] work. And this little lady got out there
[1:16:51] with them little bitty old clothes on.
[1:16:52] Was horrible. This is a novel Mother Day
[1:16:55] speech. But my brother, let me tell you
[1:16:57] something. Mother, get back to be mother
[1:16:59] again.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Even to a little bitty boy was in our
[1:17:04] neighborhood coming and told us about.
[1:17:05] Look out there. I said, "That's nothing.
[1:17:07] The woman's a nice woman. I don't say
[1:17:09] she's demoralized, but the thing of it
[1:17:11] is there's an honory, filthy spirit on
[1:17:14] her making her do that and she don't
[1:17:16] know it.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; What in the world would a mother want or
[1:17:22] anybody put on those little old dirty
[1:17:24] clothes and stretch himself out before
[1:17:26] me?
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; You're pretty sister. You're a pretty
[1:17:29] mother. I thank God for you. But you're
[1:17:33] pretty. But had you not got the Holy
[1:17:34] Spirit there to protect those boys?
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; You'd have been better to be so ugly,
[1:17:39] nobody would have looked at you and went
[1:17:40] to heaven.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; That's true. Watch what you're doing.
[1:17:47] Those moral now what it is. The devil
[1:17:50] has come in and he's told the people
[1:17:52] these things. He's got into the
[1:17:54] preachers. He's patterned for Hollywood.
[1:17:56] The girls and the young ladies, they
[1:17:59] pattern after Hollywood. the best of
[1:18:01] things that they have in the country
[1:18:02] today. The most marvelous you can hear
[1:18:04] us talk about all the radio talk some
[1:18:06] old woman like Mrs. K star. Nothing
[1:18:09] against her but to see an old woman 50
[1:18:11] years old and all with her clothes all
[1:18:13] pushed out on her like she's poured in a
[1:18:14] meal sack. I ain't saying that for a
[1:18:16] joke cuz I'm talking against those
[1:18:17] things. But a woman act like that and
[1:18:19] stand up and be an example to a young
[1:18:21] American women. It's an
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; tarnation.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; It's the devil. Amen.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Guys like Arthur Godfrey and them
[1:18:28] running around here doing the things
[1:18:29] that they do and the most noted man in
[1:18:31] the country like that and what it's a
[1:18:33] disgrace.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:37] [Applause]
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Because I feel the Holy Spirit is here.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; The invasion's on. It's sweeping from
[1:18:44] house to house, from place to place,
[1:18:46] from church to church, from man to man.
[1:18:49] Children in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:18:51] rise with the moral stand of everybody
[1:18:54] and the Lord Jesus Christ say I'll take
[1:18:56] the way with the Lord's
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; disc.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. I'll be a real mother.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; I'll be a real dad and the whole world
[1:19:07] all around all around my soul gives way.
[1:19:10] Then he's all my hope and stay for on
[1:19:12] Christ the solid rock I stand. All other
[1:19:14] grounds are sinking.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; All other grounds.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:19:19] What's caused all this stuff? What's
[1:19:21] caused ministers to act like this?
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; What made preachers prophesy this lie to
[1:19:26] the people? Why did years ago Methodist
[1:19:29] people when old John Smith was packed to
[1:19:31] his pullpit to preach the gospel and he
[1:19:34] preached a short sermon of four hours
[1:19:36] and he said, "The trouble of it is that
[1:19:37] my heart is breaking." He said the
[1:19:40] Methodist daughters are even wearing
[1:19:42] rings on their fingers and today they're
[1:19:45] dressed in shorts and little old dirty
[1:19:47] clothes and they'll be perfectly nude in
[1:19:49] another five years of something being
[1:19:50] done.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; What happened to you Methodist
[1:19:54] preachers? You cannibalized you Baptist.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's the devil
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; has sold down his powers
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; and he's got his its out here. And you
[1:20:06] don't realize that you smoking
[1:20:07] cigarettes, you women, and doing the way
[1:20:09] you're doing out there and drinking and
[1:20:11] carrying on the way you're doing. You
[1:20:12] don't realize that you're poisoning your
[1:20:14] system and ruining the whole generations
[1:20:17] that'll follow you. If there is such a
[1:20:18] thing,
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; 85% more chance to take cancer by
[1:20:23] smoking cigarettes and using literally
[1:20:25] right in your van. churches
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; endorse it.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; You know, great Baptist churches here
[1:20:33] reasonably. I'm hitting the Baptist.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; I got right to that. That kind on the
[1:20:38] side that I come from. But when they had
[1:20:40] to give intermission
[1:20:42] between the Sunday school service and
[1:20:45] the preaching service so that the pastor
[1:20:48] and all could go out and have a smoke.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; And the street was lined with men and
[1:20:53] women smoking cigarettes.
[1:20:56] that has done that.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; man.
[1:21:07] here in our own city. One of our most
[1:21:09] outstanding ministers right down here in
[1:21:12] New Orle this playground that one of our
[1:21:15] outstanding ministers of the city is
[1:21:18] directing
[1:21:20] a square age program
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; to bring men and women on the platforms.
[1:21:26] Don't care what the world says. I don't
[1:21:27] care how you try to coax around it,
[1:21:29] brother. There's no redblooded man
[1:21:31] pointing up to another man's wife and
[1:21:33] feel the same.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know that's the truth.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Tuck our women and strip them out down
[1:21:39] their offices and drive taxi cabs and up
[1:21:42] and down the street where they ought to
[1:21:43] be at home behind the stove.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Cooking and fixing the dinners.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's the devil. An invasion
[1:21:53] zone.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; I ain't saying nothing about this
[1:21:55] individual or that individual. I'm
[1:21:57] saying it's unclean spirits that are
[1:21:59] possessing the people driving them right
[1:22:00] into it.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:03] The invasion of the United States, the
[1:22:06] overthrow of the church, the church is
[1:22:08] overthrow of the devil.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; That guy, they take a boy up. Now, when
[1:22:13] he comes to a seminary, the first thing
[1:22:14] he has to learn is to get his degree. He
[1:22:17] has to take psychology. He has to take
[1:22:20] theology. He has to teach get all kinds
[1:22:22] of stuff indoctrinated in him. If he
[1:22:24] hasn't got a real fine education, if he
[1:22:27] isn't smart and bright as he can be,
[1:22:29] then they'll turn him out. You can't
[1:22:31] qualify. What's he to do? To go out here
[1:22:34] and present a little political talk as
[1:22:36] it was a church politic. Talk to a group
[1:22:39] of people, a bunch of dying men and
[1:22:41] women. Oh god, some of them oldfashioned
[1:22:45] sat man who doesn't know a
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; that goes the power of the resurrection
[1:22:50] of the Lord Jesus Christ who will preach
[1:22:52] repentance and send men and women to the
[1:22:54] altar of the Lord Jesus. Thank you.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; It's an endowment. He's invaded the
[1:22:59] seminaries. He's invaded the churches.
[1:23:02] He's stripped our women. He's got our
[1:23:05] men to a place that you can't tell them
[1:23:06] nothing.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; And men and women, I think you say,
[1:23:10] "Well, the women, yes, and you men
[1:23:12] that'll permit your wives to do that.
[1:23:13] That shows what you're made out of."
[1:23:15] That's just exactly certainly it's a
[1:23:18] disgrace. It's a pity. And then down to
[1:23:21] the preacher. The preacher stands in the
[1:23:23] platform today of the modern pulpit
[1:23:27] stands there with his peoples before him
[1:23:29] and preach about every little old thing
[1:23:31] in the world besides repentance and sin
[1:23:33] and the rugged cross of Christ.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. When you lay the facts down, the
[1:23:40] people come to hear you in evangelistic
[1:23:41] service, you're trying to get to the
[1:23:43] thing to preach the gospel and get
[1:23:44] people to repenting and getting right up
[1:23:47] and walk out. They don't have to hear
[1:23:49] it.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; No, they don't. But brother, they're
[1:23:51] going to have to repent our parish.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Demons.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; You go to the school. It's invaded the
[1:24:00] schools. Look around over the country
[1:24:02] today. Look here. You people, you
[1:24:04] Protestants. Look, here's four great big
[1:24:06] Catholic schools and things built up
[1:24:08] today. Why is it you're letting down the
[1:24:11] bars?
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Nothing against Catholicism. No, I don't
[1:24:15] believe in it. I'm a strictly a
[1:24:16] Protestant. That's exactly proved. They
[1:24:19] don't You can't argue with them. They
[1:24:20] say, "We don't care what the Bible says.
[1:24:21] We know what the church says." God's in
[1:24:24] his word.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; This is where God's at.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; But some of the Catholics sticking to
[1:24:29] their church to make you ashamed of
[1:24:30] yourself as a Protestant.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Have you stick to the Bible as they
[1:24:33] stick to the church,
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; right? But they're wrong. I can say that
[1:24:39] out of the authority of Almighty God
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; that they're wrong. Absolutely. And you
[1:24:44] Protestants are wrong the way you're
[1:24:45] doing because you really know better
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; and you do it that makes a hypocrite out
[1:24:49] of you.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Sure. I see invasion.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Church is letting down. And now instead
[1:24:54] of church trying to make the church
[1:24:56] beautiful, build a bigger church, put
[1:24:58] big spires on it, great big pipe organs
[1:25:00] and get everything trying to pattern
[1:25:02] like the Catholic church. You don't want
[1:25:05] a pattern like the Catholic church. And
[1:25:07] she's doomed to go through destructions.
[1:25:09] For that's thus sayeth the Lord. She's
[1:25:11] doomed to go through destructions and
[1:25:13] you're patterned after her. You're going
[1:25:15] with her.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; But what we need today is not a big
[1:25:18] church, a big fire. It's an old fashion
[1:25:21] altars where her sins are burned up
[1:25:23] under consecrated prayers from men and
[1:25:26] women who love Christ.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Praise your holy name.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; You know that
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; that's what we need.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Hear me, friends. Hear me. It's love. My
[1:25:36] time's gone. I just like to linger on
[1:25:37] that. horse I pick up a little later on
[1:25:40] that invasion where it went to it's
[1:25:42] invaded it's invaded our nations it
[1:25:46] invaded the United States now remember I
[1:25:48] never cast a vote in my life I start to
[1:25:52] brag on that's my American birth rights
[1:25:54] if I want to do it but I think too much
[1:25:56] of my friends to put them in there look
[1:25:59] I've seen them go in as fine man come
[1:26:00] out as crooks and I don't want that I
[1:26:04] have one thing I'm here building a
[1:26:06] platform for one person who's the
[1:26:07] candidate That's Jesus Christ and him
[1:26:09] alone. I'll give my time for him.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. And if I can get the
[1:26:13] church straightened out, the rest of the
[1:26:14] world will take care of itself. That's
[1:26:16] right.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, when Mr. Roosevelt,
[1:26:20] the man's dead. Let him rest. I trust he
[1:26:22] is. Come in and run three or four terms
[1:26:24] and take over just a preliminary
[1:26:26] dictatorship. I can prove to you that
[1:26:28] the scripture where that said he take
[1:26:30] place,
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; right? We haven't got no more
[1:26:32] constitution. She's broke to pieces.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Everything's all smattering. The
[1:26:37] Republicans is just as bad.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; It's six of one, a half a dozen the
[1:26:41] other. For every kingdom is going to be
[1:26:44] smashed, but the kingdom of Jesus Christ
[1:26:46] shall stand and reign forever.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. Up on Daniel saw the rock
[1:26:52] he out of the mountains and hit the
[1:26:53] political world back there and mashed it
[1:26:56] into a grinding powder like that like
[1:26:59] the wheat on a thrashing floor of a
[1:27:00] summertime. But that rock grew into a
[1:27:03] great mountain that spread over the he
[1:27:04] filled the whole heavens and earth.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. The political world's
[1:27:09] gone. Our nation is broke.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; You remember that? Brother Brandham said
[1:27:14] that thus saith the Lord.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Our nation is demolished.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; It'll never rise.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; She's gone like all the rest of the
[1:27:26] nations.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; It's the greatest nation in the world
[1:27:28] standing today. But the very seed of the
[1:27:31] devil has been planted into the hearts
[1:27:33] of the people. how I come into
[1:27:35] Hollywood, how he got out into the
[1:27:36] people and begin this and you can't tell
[1:27:38] them nothing.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Get a president up there with try to
[1:27:42] close whiskey out and have prohibition
[1:27:43] and see what would happen. He'd be shot
[1:27:45] in two hours after you got
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; sure you can't stand it. The whole
[1:27:49] world's against him.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You couldn't do it. She's
[1:27:54] gone. She's invaded.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of communism has took
[1:27:59] over.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Go to our schools today. Look at our
[1:28:03] school children. Our little fellas that
[1:28:06] go to school. You just ought to know
[1:28:08] what goes on.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Little girls down here in the schools
[1:28:12] and things like that at the age of 14
[1:28:15] and 15. Their mommy sent them to school
[1:28:17] wrecked morally
[1:28:21] dope fiends, dope addicts, cigarette
[1:28:23] puffers, everything else like that. And
[1:28:25] a little bitty age of little children
[1:28:26] like that. Amen.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; It'd be as hard to find a virgin among
[1:28:30] some of them as it would be to find a
[1:28:32] needle in a
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; hay stack.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Well, they have blanket dates for the
[1:28:35] boys and stretch on these river banks
[1:28:37] and everywhere else. And I can prove it
[1:28:38] to you, my friends. I would sit in the
[1:28:40] pool pit listening about of schools
[1:28:42] right here in our our counties right
[1:28:44] here in these counties that those little
[1:28:46] ladies dressing don't know, telling
[1:28:48] their mothers that they're going to
[1:28:49] different places and meeting boys and
[1:28:50] even prostituting on the streets of
[1:28:52] Louisville.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; What is it? and sing in choirs because
[1:28:57] they got a little social gospel stand
[1:28:59] there where preachers stand talking
[1:29:00] about little petty things and little
[1:29:02] bitty stories of the Bible or something
[1:29:03] like that instead of preaching
[1:29:04] repentance and bringing man and women to
[1:29:06] the altar.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Daddy walk in at night, light up the
[1:29:12] cigar, take a glass of beers, sit down
[1:29:13] and drink it. Mother's out through the
[1:29:15] daytime with a bunch of women, some card
[1:29:17] party, some social like that. How can
[1:29:19] you expect the child to be anything
[1:29:21] else? Amen.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Let whatever environment you live in,
[1:29:24] that's what you are.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; You take a little bitty girl, little
[1:29:28] bitty boy, put him out here, let him
[1:29:29] live with somebody. You take a man, I
[1:29:31] can take my boy, let him be out for a
[1:29:33] day with somebody, let him come in. I'm
[1:29:35] going to tell you who he's been with.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Certainly watch that environment that
[1:29:39] spirit catches him. You go into a church
[1:29:41] where the people all you go into Holy
[1:29:43] Ghost churches or or Pentecostal
[1:29:45] churches to call, let everybody be they
[1:29:47] run, jerk their head back and forth, the
[1:29:49] pastor does. Watch the whole church
[1:29:51] begin to do the same thing.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Let the man the people get up and just
[1:29:55] carry on terrible or something. Watch
[1:29:57] the whole thing do that. Get into a
[1:29:59] place where the pastors real starchy and
[1:30:01] cold. Watch the whole group do it.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; You come into that environment.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; You take a man that's a good moral man
[1:30:08] and let him marry a little old woman
[1:30:10] ain't worth a dime. It isn't long and he
[1:30:11] ain't worth a dime either.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; That's what happened to Ahab.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Take a same with eyes of mercy. Instead
[1:30:18] of that nice little woman, marry an old
[1:30:20] man that ain't worth a dime.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; The first thing you know, she's doing
[1:30:22] the same thing he is.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; How do I go this morning and point my
[1:30:26] hands on little broken up homes and
[1:30:28] things like that? Poor lovely little
[1:30:29] mothers coming into a drinking dad and
[1:30:31] things like that and thought they could
[1:30:33] do something with him and now the whole
[1:30:34] mother and all of them are drinking and
[1:30:35] going on.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; It's environment. What is it? It's the
[1:30:39] devil.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; It's the devil.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; The invasion. He swept into this nation
[1:30:46] like a roaring lion.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; He set himself down there in the best
[1:30:51] place he had in Hollywood. He said, "I
[1:30:53] get the movie share until the television
[1:30:54] comes on. Then I'll get them."
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; And he stay down there and the church
[1:30:59] people instead of shutting down the
[1:31:00] shows and not letting their children go,
[1:31:02] they give them 10 cents on a Sunday
[1:31:04] afternoon and send them down there so
[1:31:05] they could have a little social card
[1:31:06] party, be out to theirel and ride
[1:31:08] around.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, why disgrace? Amen.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Now just turn the television on it and
[1:31:13] watch all the dirty rotten Tommy rot
[1:31:15] there is in the world on it.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; I ain't got nothing against the movie. I
[1:31:18] ain't got nothing against the
[1:31:19] television. It's the rotten stuff that's
[1:31:20] on it.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. Could have kept it
[1:31:23] moral. It had stone.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; You couldn't sell old fashioned button
[1:31:26] shoes in town today at all. Women don't
[1:31:28] want them. They want the toes out of
[1:31:29] them. The rest of women's are doing it.
[1:31:31] That's right. When you go to church, you
[1:31:33] can't sell old time religion because the
[1:31:34] other woman, she don't know one do that.
[1:31:36] No sir. I know. Me and me go now. I just
[1:31:38] believe that's all there is to it. Oh,
[1:31:40] old brother. The devil breathes too.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Have I right? You'll repent or perish.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:31:49] sorry. No, I'm not.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; No, I'm not. No, I'll take that back.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; I love people.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; But I I love you too well to see you go
[1:31:58] into a headlong plunge like that.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; God willing, I'll pick this up a little
[1:32:02] later on in the week.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Now, to you mothers, it's mothers. Just
[1:32:07] a word to you before going. God bless
[1:32:10] you. You bring your children up, Ryan.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; We pick up this invasion. We got to go
[1:32:14] into the homes yet in a lot of places,
[1:32:16] the schools and out in places where we
[1:32:18] pick it up. But the invasion of the
[1:32:19] United States, the devil has tucker
[1:32:22] over.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid of Russia. Russia ain't
[1:32:25] got nothing to do. We're doing it
[1:32:27] ourselves.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Our own rotten right among us.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. You know, the United
[1:32:32] States has more divorce cases than all
[1:32:34] the rest of the world.
[1:32:39] more divorces. Think of it. That
[1:32:42] horrible. The motherhood has been
[1:32:45] broken. Mothers don't stay home no more
[1:32:46] with their children like they used to.
[1:32:48] They got to have a job. Hear the other
[1:32:51] day a certain grocery in this city was
[1:32:53] talking to me about it. These women
[1:32:55] working at these public plants, these
[1:32:56] young married women with a bunch of
[1:32:58] little kids that got babysitters taking
[1:33:00] care of their babies. They work in these
[1:33:02] public places. Said there's two of them
[1:33:03] standing in the room. They got laid off
[1:33:05] at their public works. Don't worry,
[1:33:08] we'll make it anyhow.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, such an hour of prostitution at
[1:33:13] hand.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Sure. The devil's done told them they're
[1:33:17] the boss of the house.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; They'll make their own money. They'll do
[1:33:20] what they wish to.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; You get it out of if you can. There's
[1:33:24] only one thing they get out of them.
[1:33:25] That's the offer before Jesus Christ. An
[1:33:28] oldfashioned tear stream religion
[1:33:30] that'll break their hearts and tear them
[1:33:31] to pieces and make them what they ought
[1:33:33] to be.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, you may think I'm
[1:33:36] just an old fogy, but the day when
[1:33:39] you're dying, my brother, sister, you'll
[1:33:41] realize that I told you the truth.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. She's on the invasion. The
[1:33:46] hour is sure.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Not a Yes. an hour of decision, too.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; An hour of decision. Not to come to
[1:33:52] church, but an hour of decision whether
[1:33:54] you go to serve Christ or stay lukewarm
[1:33:58] in your church.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. There's plenty of church
[1:34:01] members. If all the the people of
[1:34:04] America that profess to be Christians,
[1:34:05] to be real Christians, born again
[1:34:07] Christians, brother, we'd be as safe as
[1:34:09] you'd be in heaven almost.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Wars and trouble. Yes, sir. Diseases
[1:34:14] would leave the land.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Everything else, would you like to come
[1:34:17] down the street and see or lady come by
[1:34:19] and how you sister? Good morning,
[1:34:20] brother. Well, that is not you one worry
[1:34:23] in the world. Everything's just fine and
[1:34:25] daddy and a fellow come to the street
[1:34:26] corner instead of trying to run over
[1:34:28] you, you stop. All right, brother. All
[1:34:30] right. Yeah. Oh, you prefer me. See,
[1:34:32] just prefer. Wouldn't that be wonderful?
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; We're going to have it. That's in the
[1:34:37] millennium, brother. The day. That's
[1:34:39] right.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; So, now we're not I stood in our
[1:34:42] neighborhood day. Nothing against our
[1:34:44] neighborhood, but I can notice our
[1:34:46] little children. Wife is crying. A
[1:34:50] certain doctor of this town. There's a
[1:34:52] little girl was running around my little
[1:34:53] girl. and they love one another until
[1:34:56] they found out that her name was Brandon
[1:34:58] and she was Reverend Brandham's child.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; That settled it. Little girl couldn't go
[1:35:02] with that little girl anymore. Oh, I
[1:35:04] thought, well, okay. Some of the little
[1:35:06] neighbors run over there and said, well,
[1:35:08] it's all right. So, they went to their
[1:35:09] pastor. Don't tell me, you know, I have
[1:35:11] a way of knowing a lot of things, you
[1:35:13] see. So, they they went to their pastor
[1:35:15] and said, you know, there's a man lives
[1:35:17] in our neighborhood is so good to our
[1:35:19] children. Said it's Reverend Brandham.
[1:35:20] He takes them all in his little truck,
[1:35:22] takes them out. said, "Well, uh, we have
[1:35:25] nothing against Reverend Brandon. He's
[1:35:27] all right. But you see, he's just a
[1:35:28] different class of people than what we
[1:35:29] are. We, uh, I I would that you wouldn't
[1:35:34] be, you know, I wouldn't kind of You
[1:35:38] speak to him, friendly, but just let
[1:35:39] that be the end."
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, my wife's standing there
[1:35:44] crying.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; I said, "Sweetheart, it's a separating
[1:35:48] line.
[1:35:49] As for me in my house, we'll serve the
[1:35:52] Lord.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; All the world gives away still Jesus
[1:35:57] Christ. If I have to be called a
[1:35:58] fanatic, if I have to be shunned by my
[1:36:00] kins, my fellow man and things like
[1:36:01] that, I still choose Jesus Christ.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:36:08] When earthly friends forsake you, still
[1:36:11] more closer to him plain. Hold to him,
[1:36:14] God. Let me preach like I never before.
[1:36:18] Let me preach to dying man as a dying
[1:36:20] man myself. Let me preach to people like
[1:36:23] I never have another sermon to preach.
[1:36:25] Let me persuade them to come to the a
[1:36:28] streaming faces of deer. Go back home
[1:36:30] and live like Christians and live in
[1:36:32] their neighborhood. Stop all this.
[1:36:34] You're frolick and running around and
[1:36:35] jumping and carrying on and acting this
[1:36:37] way and blowing up at this and going
[1:36:39] that way. Oh, don't do that. That's the
[1:36:42] devil. Them demon spirits. Come on,
[1:36:44] Christians.
[1:36:46] Remember those ministers down there?
[1:36:47] There was them prophets. They were
[1:36:50] prophets.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; They were religious men offering a
[1:36:54] sacrifice.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; They were just as religious as the
[1:36:57] teachers of this day. But brother, they
[1:36:59] was a long ways from knowing the truth.
[1:37:01] Don't you see how religious the devil
[1:37:02] is?
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; The devil's not no anti-gra big thing
[1:37:06] like communism all against Christianity.
[1:37:08] That's not that's a war. The devil,
[1:37:10] sure, but it's not the antichrist.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; The antichrist is very religious.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Very religious. It was a religious
[1:37:17] spirit that crucified Jesus. It's always
[1:37:20] been a religious world, a religious
[1:37:22] people that crucified. It's a religious
[1:37:25] people that was against the true Christ.
[1:37:27] It was religious prophets that was
[1:37:28] against Micah.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; It's the religious people of the day.
[1:37:32] That's against the message of God.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Remember, I have warned you. I have told
[1:37:37] you.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; I ain't speaking so much about
[1:37:40] Catholicism and Baptist. I'm talking
