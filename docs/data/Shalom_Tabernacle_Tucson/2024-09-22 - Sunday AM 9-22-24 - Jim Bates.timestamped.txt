[2:21] believe all things are
[2:26] possible
[2:28] only believe
[2:32] [Music]
[2:36] only
[2:38] only
[2:41] believe all things are
[2:46] possible
[2:51] only we'll be starting at question
[2:54] number
[2:55] 292 and we're going to finish just
[2:57] before 210 for those that are following
[3:01] this is questions and answers on the
[3:03] seals you may be seated brother
[3:07] Brandon now the Catholic church back
[3:10] there
[3:13] from now the Catholic chur church back
[3:15] there from charging from Mass and so
[3:17] forth holds the wealth of the world you
[3:19] remember the Bible said she was rich and
[3:21] how she was and remember not only just
[3:24] on one nation she's rich on every nation
[3:27] there is under Heaven she reaches out
[3:29] right she has the money now what they
[3:33] don't have Wall Street has which is
[3:35] controlled for the
[3:36] Jews now and you remember he got the
[3:39] money when Jacob returned last night we
[3:41] find out and become Israel he really had
[3:43] the money but his money wouldn't buy
[3:46] nothing see to Esau Esau had it too see
[3:50] both anti and and the one see just
[3:53] perfectly now watch here I said they
[3:56] might want to consolidate together on
[3:58] the money and uh and the Roman power
[4:01] take the Jewish power and uh money
[4:03] breaking the Covenant that might not be
[4:04] so see I know they'll break it but I I
[4:06] don't know what reason because it's not
[4:08] revealed to me about what they'll do but
[4:10] um look now if the
[4:14] day now what if today the only thing
[4:16] that we can do would be to do if we're
[4:20] drawing taxes if that statement is right
[4:22] off of the currency off of the tax money
[4:25] of 40 years from now you see our goal is
[4:29] we've done spanning amen we're
[4:32] broke we don't have any money and we're
[4:36] only living off of a past reputation
[4:39] that's what the church is doing today
[4:41] the church not the bride the church is
[4:43] living off of a past reputation it got
[4:45] back under under the ministry of the
[4:47] lion
[4:48] times we are the church we are the
[4:50] mother church we started uh that's right
[4:53] see is living off of reputation
[4:55] methodists is living off of their
[4:56] reputation Baptists is living off of
[4:58] their reputation and Pentecost are
[4:59] living off of their glory to God long
[5:02] time ago when the saints used to dance
[5:03] in the spirit and how they the Lord done
[5:05] this and that that at something past we
[5:07] all got big now brother oh my see all
[5:11] past reputation this nation is RI living
[5:14] off of a past reputation of what the
[5:17] forefathers was see and that's the
[5:19] reason we think we'll be saved God never
[5:21] respected Israel on what they was what
[5:23] they had been what they was then notice
[5:26] but now here's what I think
[5:29] what I I think will take
[5:32] place now it may not be so I believe the
[5:35] time will come when we're forced to make
[5:38] the issue and when it will be that
[5:42] instead of us uh changing the currency
[5:47] what would that do to the Philip Morris
[5:50] what would that do to the the whiskey
[5:53] companies what would that do to the
[5:55] steel industry what would that do to all
[5:57] the Commerce what would that it would br
[5:59] break
[6:00] them they' be
[6:02] broke but if we can Bor that
[6:07] money see how smart he
[6:10] is then the nation sells out to the
[6:14] church and that church and state is
[6:17] United again there she come to God
[6:20] hallelujah that's it notice all right
[6:23] now in this if one is in a Association
[6:29] AR
[6:30] organization by our government and can
[6:33] speak the um dictates of his own heart
[6:39] or in the last days truth will
[6:44] he
[6:46] be termed as one of the
[6:51] harlots see if one in the association
[6:54] organization is well see the association
[6:57] organization the the organization
[7:00] that's given rights by the government to
[7:02] speak see that don't have anything to do
[7:04] with his heart see now if he is a real
[7:10] believer and born to the spirit of
[7:13] God sometime or other he's going to be
[7:18] checked it can't be so plain and then
[7:20] him not see it now I want you see you
[7:23] want to remember this friend that God
[7:27] God never does it has it any time as I
[7:30] can remember see but what look Jesus was
[7:34] the was the keynote of all of it because
[7:36] he was God Emanuel made flesh now look
[7:39] at this this fellow Jesus when did you
[7:43] know when he come on Earth there wasn't
[7:45] I guess one tenth of the world know he
[7:48] was
[7:50] here you know when that Forerunner come
[7:53] when all the mountains and things that
[7:54] take place there wasn't 100th of the
[7:58] population of Israel I guess ever
[8:02] noticed isn't that
[8:04] strange while there were Jews and things
[8:07] and people all over the world I remember
[8:09] Jesus came to be a witness as a savior
[8:11] of the world is that
[8:13] right while there were just people after
[8:16] people after people after races after
[8:19] people that never even know nothing
[8:21] about it went right on just like the
[8:22] world know nothing about it but all the
[8:24] time that was going on in the
[8:26] world see why didn't he let no he came
[8:31] and the ones that were predestinated the
[8:33] eternal life was the ones that received
[8:36] him there had been no good to say
[8:38] anything to the rest of them because he
[8:40] could not redeemed them because it
[8:42] wasn't even
[8:44] redeemable why was it when those priests
[8:46] stood there when he had to come to that
[8:48] spot because a predestinated was plotted
[8:51] out in there all around so he had to
[8:53] preached to him as a group and the great
[8:55] Scholars that should have know him said
[8:57] this man is be elub we not have this man
[9:00] rule over us and so forth see we not do
[9:02] it but a little old
[9:05] prostitute with a life in her
[9:07] predestinated to eternal life and her
[9:09] name is IM Marly in the word of God here
[9:12] walked up there and the first time that
[9:14] light struck that little sea quickly she
[9:16] know
[9:17] it look at old fisherman come by there
[9:20] here he stood there doing signs and
[9:21] wonders and telling different people the
[9:23] secrets of their hearts and revealing
[9:25] himself and Ma there was Pharisees stand
[9:28] there and said this man is Beba they had
[9:31] to answer to their congregation all I'm
[9:32] stand Dr Jones will you go down and
[9:34] listen to this man he seems like he
[9:36] knows what he's talking about he don't
[9:37] talk like or man I will hear him walk
[9:40] down there see go God can never get to
[9:43] him and there he stood down there and
[9:45] said they said look at there look there
[9:47] there comes a man there there's one of
[9:48] his disciples there comes a man up
[9:50] that's guy's name uh that's Andrew you
[9:52] remember oh you remember the old uh the
[9:55] old fisherman down here that's Sam yeah
[9:57] that that's Simon his brother you see
[9:59] and that's that's old Jonas's kids there
[10:01] they look he he's bringing somebody up
[10:03] to him who is it yeah see what he'll do
[10:06] now he's he's the next up there he walks
[10:08] up and
[10:09] said your name is
[10:12] Simon and you are the son of
[10:17] Jonas this man is
[10:19] be see he's got some kind of spirit on
[10:21] him he's an odd fell see swear don't
[10:24] don't you all listen to nothing like
[10:25] that see keep away from I wouldn't hand
[10:26] any more of these meetings at all see as
[10:28] soon as this thing over we'll get out of
[10:30] here we'll never get away around here
[10:32] again see wow now that's what he thought
[10:34] and yet was supposed to be the one look
[10:36] the very ones that he come to was the
[10:38] ones who crucified
[10:40] him but there's a little prostitute that
[10:42] everybody kicked out I'm not aors in
[10:46] prostitution no indeed but I'm just
[10:48] showing you the predestinated seed look
[10:50] at this guy here this old fisherman put
[10:52] not the Bible said he was unlearned is
[10:56] that right not only that but he was
[10:58] ignorant
[10:59] amen
[11:02] right now is that right or
[11:05] wrong oh we just get ignorant a lot of
[11:08] these things that we think we know all
[11:11] right see he was both ignorant and
[11:14] unlearned and then he walked up there in
[11:16] the presence of the Lord Jesus and he
[11:19] told him he was right then that settled
[11:22] it now what's this other Fell's argument
[11:25] against that well look he believed it
[11:27] look who it is know who that is that man
[11:31] never why why is's a fisherman or he
[11:35] don't know his ABC I bought fish from
[11:38] you couldn't even sign me a
[11:40] receipt that see that's the kind of
[11:42] stuff that's the kind of people that
[11:43] listens to something like that thank the
[11:47] lord well well he don't look at his
[11:49] daddy is ignorant he didn't even send
[11:51] him to school but that's the one he sent
[11:54] to school Tau the way he wanted I'm not
[11:57] supporting not going to school now I
[11:59] hope you understand but there's just the
[12:01] type see what you get in that that's the
[12:04] kind of reason it goes over the top of
[12:06] them and you know what not one I'd say
[12:08] not onethird of all the Jews in the land
[12:12] ever know anything about him coming and
[12:15] and then one one 15 of the one3 listen
[12:20] to him and then one hund of the 1
[12:26] received it
[12:30] you know how many he had he had 12
[12:33] standing at the cross out the whole
[12:34] bunch where's the rest
[12:36] of the 70 went away now while he was
[12:39] Healing The Sick and just going down not
[12:40] saying nothing about his Doctrine he
[12:42] just went ahead Healing The Sick and
[12:43] everything oh my that's God's spirit on
[12:45] him you believe that when he was Healing
[12:47] The Sick wonderful that's a great Rabbi
[12:49] say hey Brethren you're in heav your
[12:51] church boy you talk about power that guy
[12:54] can really heal the sick you you got a
[12:56] gift of healing well of course they're
[12:57] going to have some impersonations that
[12:59] here they come along because each
[13:00] group's got to have his own man here he
[13:02] comes and that the first thing you know
[13:03] one day he sat down oh sure Rabbi we'll
[13:06] go with you all right St down let's go
[13:08] all right sent out the 70 and so forth
[13:10] and one day after A great miracle was
[13:12] done he sat down and begin to tell him
[13:14] the
[13:17] word at the beginning of the sounding of
[13:20] the all right he began to tell them the
[13:22] word the truth is ah now wait a
[13:26] minute I don't know about this is
[13:29] contrary to their Doctrine say well I
[13:32] know we left the synagogue and
[13:33] everything like that but maybe we was
[13:34] wrong brother we better go back cuz that
[13:36] man talks in riddles he's kind of an odd
[13:39] fell I can't understand that see why was
[13:42] it the seed wasn't
[13:43] predestinated started then the first
[13:45] thing you know he had a little
[13:46] ministerial group and talked to the
[13:48] ministers they said
[13:49] [Music]
[13:50] a we better go back to and go back and
[13:53] get in the organization take up our
[13:54] papers again see going this guy well who
[13:56] can understand a man like that he says

[14:01] mothers didn't understand it like

[14:06] them but not to the others so they

[14:54] billions get humble see stay humble
[14:58] watch now all that Pharisees and that
[15:00] little prostitute come up there she said
[15:02] save you must be a prophet now we know
[15:05] that messiah's coming when he comes
[15:06] he'll do that he said I'm he she said
[15:09] that's it the waste you want you try to
[15:11] stop her once you couldn't do it brother
[15:13] Brams greetings in the name of the Lord
[15:16] Jesus please explain who the man in
[15:19] Matthew
[15:22] 22:11 the man that didn't have on a
[15:24] wedding garment wedding garment on I
[15:27] know this man
[15:29] could couldn't get into heaven without
[15:33] the wedding garment on this was a guest
[15:37] I
[15:37] know not the
[15:40] bride yes that's
[15:42] right he the yeah he just slipped in see
[15:46] now
[15:46] look now did take a whole sermon on that
[15:50] now I got 10 minutes to pray for the
[15:52] sick and finish this up and I've got one
[15:54] half of done but I'm going to hurry
[15:57] right sure enough back to this one
[15:59] here's what happened if you know the
[16:01] Oriental Customs see when a
[16:05] bridegroom gives out invitations for his
[16:08] wedding he just gives out so many
[16:12] invitations and for every invitation he
[16:15] sent he had a porter standing at the
[16:18] door to put a robe on him whether he was
[16:19] poor or whatever he was he had if he was
[16:22] rich or poor whatever it was he all had
[16:24] to wear this wedding
[16:25] garment when they stood at the door they
[16:27] put this on him they covered up what
[16:29] he's outside of the been he's invited
[16:31] where's the millionaire where's the
[16:32] parper where's a farmer ditch digger
[16:34] whatever he is or or plutocrat he's he's
[16:37] here with the robe on now because the
[16:39] Rob's put on him at the door when he
[16:41] enters in at the door I take St John 10
[16:44] I believe it is he said I am the
[16:47] door I am the door that enter you enter
[16:50] in by now there he stands at the door
[16:52] and hears the man to put the robe on him
[16:53] the Holy Spirit to give him the robe of
[16:55] righteousness when he comes in now this
[16:57] man had come by some
[17:01] organization back at the window over
[17:03] here some sliping hole and he got in the
[17:06] table and sat down and then when the
[17:08] bridegroom comes out and looks around he
[17:10] he these have been OD ducts before now
[17:13] he's the odd
[17:14] duct what you doing here like that
[17:17] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[17:18] and all these
[17:19] things how did you ever get in here well
[17:23] uh he come in somewhere besides the door
[17:25] and he come without the proper
[17:28] invitation
[17:30] see he come by some educational
[17:34] system see or something like that he got
[17:37] in and he said to him bind him hand and
[17:41] feet cast him out of here into outer
[17:44] Darkness where there will be weeping and
[17:46] wailing and nashing of teeth he went
[17:48] into the tribulation period see he did
[17:51] not come in by the door so all right
[17:55] question will the Elijah of Mala four be
[17:59] the same as Elijah mentioned in
[18:01] Revelations 11:3 and is the other
[18:04] Witnesses um as other two witness
[18:08] separate individuals separate yes the
[18:10] Elijah of Malachi 4 will not be the
[18:13] Elijah of Malachi 3 we went through that
[18:15] last night and is the other witness
[18:18] separate two of them yes sir Moses and
[18:20] Elijah to our
[18:22] Revelation
[18:23] now I don't to hold you here too long
[18:27] First Kings 19 brother Brandon I believe
[18:31] that the number who did not bow the knee
[18:33] was yeah that's right 700 thank you
[18:36] that's correctly 700 instead of
[18:39] 7,000 brother 7,000 instead of 700 I see
[18:49] that you know really when a person comes
[18:53] like
[18:54] this to to preach I want to ask you
[18:57] something I SAR shall
[19:00] understand when the
[19:03] Elijah came from the Wilderness he had
[19:05] one message he stomped out of that
[19:08] Wilderness and come right down and told
[19:10] that King that do will not even fall
[19:12] from Heaven till I call for you that's
[19:14] the words he had and St right back out
[19:16] and shut up the
[19:18] nobody when he had another message he
[19:20] come right down and said this message
[19:22] and turn right back around went back out
[19:23] into the Wilderness see now if you watch
[19:27] when I laid the Cornerstone in that
[19:28] Tabernacle he said do the work of an
[19:32] evangelist and now the hour is coming
[19:34] when that work is separated there
[19:37] something else taking place amen amen
[19:39] then I'm so conf see I get here and try
[19:41] to do evangelist and something else and
[19:43] see where you're at see you're all I I'm
[19:47] expecting the church to be spiritual
[19:48] enough to
[19:50] understand
[19:53] Amen brother brother
[19:56] Brandon I understand that El lias must
[19:59] be three times you tell us that he has
[20:02] been twice already and will come again
[20:05] now will the person that the spirit of
[20:08] Elias will be upon also be of the two
[20:12] witnesses of Moses and Eli no no he will
[20:16] be a gentile see to the Gentile church
[20:18] God sends always to his own people see
[20:21] he came to his own his own SE always
[20:23] sends is the message of the hour when
[20:25] God was dealing with the Jews it wasn't
[20:26] any Gentile prophets come
[20:29] when God's dealing with the Gentiles
[20:30] there's no Jewish prophets when God
[20:32] turns back to the Jews there'll be no
[20:34] Gentile
[20:35] prophets see what I mean all right after
[20:39] the Rapture has taken place uh there
[20:42] will be a carryover time of course one
[20:44] message carrying to the other is it has
[20:46] to come right in like this you see as I
[20:47] explain that see like Paul to the
[20:49] Gentiles and so forth all right after
[20:51] the Rapture has been taken place will
[20:54] any of the church be saved in the end
[20:57] who was not uh taken in the
[21:01] Rapture no uhuh because the blood's done
[21:04] left you see there be no intercession
[21:06] the Gentile age is finished there be no
[21:08] one saved at the Rapture of another
[21:10] church uhuh the church let him it's
[21:12] filthy be filthy still him it's holy be
[21:14] holy still that won't take
[21:17] place not after the church is gone
[21:19] brother Brandon I noticed you your
[21:22] referring to Daniel 70 weeks on the
[21:25] first seal message I understand on
[21:29] Daniel on the tape of Daniel when the
[21:32] gospel returns to the Jews the 70 weeks

[1:06:56] greetings I see a lot of my friends here
[1:06:59] barve it's been a long time 1991 I first
[1:07:01] met that man we had some Adventures
[1:07:03] didn't we and some good friends ever
[1:07:05] your guitar playing it sounds like it's
[1:07:07] gotten
[1:07:08] better it was good then but it's I just
[1:07:11] that's amazing what a talent my friend
[1:07:14] for John Martin John Allen I've been on
[1:07:16] the mission fi with that man he's pretty
[1:07:18] good maybe I'll tell you a story about
[1:07:19] that later staying in your lane it's
[1:07:23] good to see everybody amen you know um
[1:07:27] Jesse Lynn was our piano player she got
[1:07:31] prited I went to go talk to Caleb about
[1:07:33] it but when I looked up I was like you
[1:07:35] can have her all right pretty big
[1:07:39] man yeah and I I think you know I
[1:07:41] appreciate being about here brother as a
[1:07:44] friend and I think that's what it is
[1:07:46] with friends though you can be honest
[1:07:47] with each other you can just be
[1:07:49] authentic you don't have to put on no
[1:07:51] pretenses it was the best outside of
[1:07:53] probably brother BR I ever been involved
[1:07:55] in that meeting he uh about 35 40
[1:07:59] minutes in he brought the presence so
[1:08:00] strong that everybody was on their feet
[1:08:03] the Holy Spirit was moving could hardly
[1:08:05] even hear him for a while and then he
[1:08:07] finished his notes and so I just told
[1:08:08] him I said that's the best I ever heard
[1:08:10] but you should have probably let go when
[1:08:12] he came that's all we want you know I'm
[1:08:15] just a sinner saved by grace I you know
[1:08:18] when you have a message Vindicated by
[1:08:22] God to stand here behind this and speak
[1:08:24] to God's is the most sacred thing you
[1:08:28] know you don't even unless you've been
[1:08:30] behind here you don't know one word
[1:08:33] misrepresented
[1:08:35] misconstrued we don't want that so we're
[1:08:37] going to go before the Lord we're going
[1:08:39] to read a scripture and go before the
[1:08:40] Lord in prayer and ask him to guard us
[1:08:43] that we just would say exactly what his
[1:08:45] Vindicated Prophet
[1:08:47] said so let's read in Ephesians too very
[1:08:50] familiar scripture I had all these notes
[1:08:53] brother Dave I had these notes all
[1:08:55] planned out for I was going to preach on
[1:08:57] little mysteries about the coming of the
[1:08:59] Lord but this morning early God changed
[1:09:01] my whole entire thought there might just
[1:09:03] be for somebody here you never know and
[1:09:06] God just that's what I love about God
[1:09:08] don't you he would move everything for
[1:09:10] one person that's crying out for him so
[1:09:13] let's go to Ephesians chapter 2 and
[1:09:15] we'll read a scripture that most of us
[1:09:17] should probably be able to
[1:09:19] quote but this is um I love this whole
[1:09:23] entire chapter 2 God pre you know
[1:09:26] brother BR preached God rich in Mercy
[1:09:28] text out of here but let's go to verse
[1:09:32] eight and we'll read uh through
[1:09:35] 10 for by grace are ye saved through
[1:09:40] faith and that not of yourselves it is a
[1:09:43] gift of God not of Works lest any man
[1:09:46] should boast for we are his workmanship
[1:09:50] created in Christ Jesus un good works
[1:09:52] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:09:54] should walk in them let's just go to him
[1:09:56] in prayer gracious Heavenly Father
[1:09:59] standing
[1:10:00] here Lord in your presence and before
[1:10:02] your people I Feel So
[1:10:05] Unworthy we just would ask that you
[1:10:07] would come father and through the
[1:10:10] foolishness of preaching that you would
[1:10:12] just make yourself known to us that was
[1:10:13] the way you chose to do it we are here
[1:10:16] gathered together to honor your
[1:10:17] Resurrection we're here as Believers of
[1:10:20] this end time message Lord by your grace
[1:10:24] we ask you just open the scripture to us
[1:10:26] make it live we'll be sure to give you
[1:10:28] all the glory we just want you to be
[1:10:29] lifted up father that all men might be
[1:10:31] drawn to you we love you we commit it to
[1:10:34] you in Jesus name amen please be
[1:10:39] seated this scripture to me um I I don't
[1:10:42] know when God was kind of speaking to me
[1:10:45] this morning when I was praying for
[1:10:46] service this idea of Law and Grace you
[1:10:49] know it took the Jews a bit Paul spent a
[1:10:52] lot of time in the New Testament
[1:10:54] separating law From Grace because in the
[1:10:57] Old Testament they had to live a
[1:11:01] law they you know it was Thou shalt Thou
[1:11:04] shalt not and they tried to to to work
[1:11:07] their way there you know brother Bram
[1:11:08] talked about the church took law for
[1:11:12] Grace um you know they had God gave them
[1:11:15] Grace but they they chose law and he
[1:11:18] said it was a school master that showed
[1:11:20] us that we couldn't do it we needed
[1:11:23] Grace and I want know so how many in
[1:11:26] here are
[1:11:28] Christians all right so when you say
[1:11:29] you're a
[1:11:30] Christian that means you're Christlike
[1:11:33] that's what the word
[1:11:34] means that means you've had a new
[1:11:38] birth brother brandham in the church age
[1:11:40] book he um made a little bit even
[1:11:42] stronger than that I'll read it to you
[1:11:43] out of the
[1:11:45] resume I don't have this one in my notes
[1:11:47] so I think some of the quotes they'll be
[1:11:49] able to pull up but in the resume
[1:11:51] brother Ram's talking about the elect
[1:11:53] and he says Christ the bride but but it
[1:11:55] speaks to the entire body of people who
[1:11:57] are called Christians whether they be
[1:11:58] true or merely
[1:12:00] nominal so there's two types of
[1:12:02] Christians those that are true and those
[1:12:05] that just say they're
[1:12:07] Christians all Israel is not Israel so
[1:12:10] all Christians are not Christians thus
[1:12:12] we learn that the church is made up of
[1:12:13] two Vines the true and the false the two
[1:12:15] Vines are motivated by two kinds of
[1:12:18] spirits one has the Holy Spirit while
[1:12:21] the other is ued with the spirit of
[1:12:22] antichrist both claim to known be known
[1:12:24] of God God both purport to speak for God
[1:12:28] both believe certain very basic truths
[1:12:30] and differ on others but since both bear
[1:12:33] the name of the Lord being called
[1:12:35] Christians and by such name bearing
[1:12:37] obviously claiming a relationship to him
[1:12:39] God calls it marriage God now holds them
[1:12:42] both responsible to him and therefore
[1:12:44] speaks to
[1:12:45] each so in this church age book how many
[1:12:48] like this book I I had a friend of mine
[1:12:51] get mine leatherbound it's an old blue
[1:12:53] was beat up and duct tape him he said
[1:12:56] can I borrow a church I said absolutely
[1:12:57] not you can't borrow my church age book
[1:13:00] it was Gabe Dutton we were at some
[1:13:02] meetings and uh he finally said I want
[1:13:04] to do something nice for you I said okay
[1:13:06] you can have my church H Book for a
[1:13:07] couple weeks but it came back like this
[1:13:09] what a blessing but I like this book you
[1:13:11] know and here he's talking to the church
[1:13:13] he shows how Satan came into the church
[1:13:16] made it lukewarm formal and Powerless
[1:13:19] but he also shows how God was in the
[1:13:20] church through the entire seven Church
[1:13:22] ages and he's speaking to these two and
[1:13:25] by Christ when we say you're a Christian
[1:13:27] God calls it
[1:13:29] marriage so now you have this
[1:13:32] responsibility when you say you're a
[1:13:33] Christian because you're saying you're
[1:13:35] God's
[1:13:37] wife right and so that's a pretty heavy
[1:13:41] responsibility that we have and I I like
[1:13:44] this in Ephesians because you know we
[1:13:47] didn't we didn't get this what we have
[1:13:50] this Christianity by works that we did
[1:13:51] or anything we could do to earn
[1:13:53] it it was simply by Grace now if you are
[1:13:57] a Christian though it it says in
[1:13:59] Ephesians that you will do good
[1:14:01] works but the works didn't save you see
[1:14:05] by being this by Grace you're saved God
[1:14:08] by Grace by a gift he saved you
[1:14:13] completely without Merit unmar
[1:14:17] favor and and that salvation he says now
[1:14:20] we are his workmanship created unto good
[1:14:23] works
[1:14:25] so if you are a
[1:14:26] Christian you will do good
[1:14:29] works they don't save you but that's
[1:14:32] that's what you're going to be let's
[1:14:33] read a scripture in Galatians 3 I just
[1:14:36] want to kind of lay this out now this
[1:14:38] like I said the Lord changed my thought
[1:14:40] this morning and I normally I have my
[1:14:41] notes done and I'm back there just
[1:14:43] waiting on the Lord but I was scurrying
[1:14:44] to write the notes brother Israel will
[1:14:46] tell you right till the last minute but
[1:14:48] I I I just just pray for me pray that
[1:14:50] the Lord will because I believe this is
[1:14:51] for
[1:14:53] somebody so Galatians the 3r chapter
[1:14:56] let's look
[1:14:57] there Galatians chapter 3 we'll just
[1:15:00] start reading at the first verse he's
[1:15:02] talking to the Galatians there here's
[1:15:03] the New Testament now they're supposed
[1:15:05] to be in The Testament of Grace the
[1:15:06] Covenant of Grace oh foolish Galatians
[1:15:09] who have Bewitched you that you should
[1:15:11] not obey the truth before whose eyes
[1:15:14] Jesus Christ had been evidently set
[1:15:15] forth crucified among you this only what
[1:15:18] I learn of you receive you the Spirit by
[1:15:20] The Works of the law or by the hearing
[1:15:22] of Faith how does you get this
[1:15:24] Christianity how did you get this life
[1:15:26] that God gave you was it by the hearing
[1:15:28] of Faith one day you heard a voice and
[1:15:32] something you said hallu you that's
[1:15:33] nothing but the
[1:15:34] truth something in you
[1:15:37] quickened or was it by something you
[1:15:40] did well you know we bless God we're
[1:15:43] message Believers and you know we we go
[1:15:45] to this church and we do this and we do
[1:15:46] these things and we dress like this and
[1:15:48] we do that therefore no no no no no
[1:15:50] no no that's not what did it we a little
[1:15:54] further there
[1:15:55] are you so foolish having begun in the
[1:15:57] spirit are you now made perfect by the
[1:16:01] flesh let's let's go back to our our
[1:16:04] salvation for a minute to that
[1:16:07] Grace because I think sometimes what
[1:16:09] happens is we kind of start to think
[1:16:10] well I'm you know I got cleaned up
[1:16:12] pretty good I you but that see that's a
[1:16:15] result of
[1:16:19] Grace have you suffered so many things
[1:16:21] in vain if yet if be yet in vain he he
[1:16:25] therefore that minth to you the spirit
[1:16:28] and worketh miracles among you does he
[1:16:29] do it by The Works of the law or by the
[1:16:31] hearing of faith brother Israel
[1:16:32] ministering to you does he do that by
[1:16:34] the law or is that by the
[1:16:38] spirit those of you who have a Ministry
[1:16:40] and all of you should oh yeah you
[1:16:42] sisters too you moms brother Brown said
[1:16:45] Matthew Mark Luke John and mother five
[1:16:46] gospels how many have heard that quote
[1:16:48] he said every mother has a
[1:16:51] congregation it's
[1:16:53] true you have a Ministry
[1:16:56] it's not by the law I was saying that
[1:16:58] yesterday at the prayer breakfast I
[1:16:59] think sometimes we do a disservice in
[1:17:01] the message and I think it's is part of
[1:17:03] the journey you think the story of Ruth
[1:17:06] Ruth had four stages Ruth deciding Ruth
[1:17:09] laboring Ruth resting and Ruth rewarded
[1:17:11] and brother Ram said laboring was Ruth
[1:17:14] working through legalism to get the rest
[1:17:16] he said every Christian has to do that
[1:17:18] so us parents we get saved in this
[1:17:20] message and we see this beautiful
[1:17:21] perfect word and then we try to make our
[1:17:23] kids live a life that we couldn't live
[1:17:24] without the Holy
[1:17:26] Ghost can't do
[1:17:28] it now in my home there was rules and I
[1:17:31] just told my kids I said I can't give
[1:17:33] you what I got I don't want you to be a
[1:17:34] second generation Jim Bates I want you
[1:17:37] to go get an experience like I did and
[1:17:38] have a relationship with him I want to
[1:17:41] get you into a presence where you can
[1:17:42] find Grace but while you're in my home
[1:17:44] there's going to be
[1:17:46] rules you go to school there's rules you
[1:17:48] drive a car there's rules you get a job
[1:17:49] there's rules you're going to have to
[1:17:51] understand there's rules someone
[1:17:53] determines right and wrong and I believe
[1:17:54] that's God
[1:17:56] everybody else has their own sense of
[1:17:57] morality but there couldn't be that
[1:17:59] conversation unless there was the you
[1:18:01] know just like gravity it's a law of
[1:18:03] God we can call it whatever we want we
[1:18:05] discovered it but it was already there
[1:18:07] same with
[1:18:08] morality it's not now this world doesn't
[1:18:10] have a clue which ones they don't even
[1:18:12] know what side of the house they belong
[1:18:15] on see and so it's not anything that we
[1:18:19] do that earns anything for
[1:18:21] us and I think that we have to keep our
[1:18:24] focus on this grace that brought it to
[1:18:25] us and when we raise our children you
[1:18:28] need to make sure that they understand
[1:18:30] right and wrong and there's rules but
[1:18:31] don't try to legislate this message on
[1:18:33] them and make you know we Club them so
[1:18:36] hard sometimes legally that they just
[1:18:38] push away we don't we don't want that
[1:18:40] they want Grace like we needed
[1:18:42] Grace I'm not trying to preach at your
[1:18:44] parents I'm just I raised seven they're
[1:18:46] all married I got 18 grandkids
[1:18:48] so if it wasn't for the Holy Ghost and
[1:18:50] my wife probably wouldn't have been that
[1:18:52] good I tried to be a good mom I wasn't a
[1:18:54] very good mom
[1:18:55] God knows what he's doing he knows how
[1:18:57] to put it
[1:19:00] together he goes on here and he says
[1:19:03] even as Abraham believed God and it was
[1:19:05] accounted to him for
[1:19:07] righteousness how many in here believed
[1:19:09] you heard it and something you said
[1:19:11] that's the TR and I believe
[1:19:13] that right then he counted it to you for
[1:19:16] righteousness oh yeah now he's going to
[1:19:18] take you through the Journey he's going
[1:19:19] to mold you you're going to you're going
[1:19:21] to start to do these things we're going
[1:19:23] to talk a little bit about that takes
[1:19:25] action he didn't just save you now you
[1:19:27] sit there like okay no I'm perfect no
[1:19:30] there's there's some things we have to
[1:19:31] do there's some action that goes with
[1:19:34] it so he he justified Abraham because he
[1:19:37] believed him now we're gonna this is
[1:19:39] where I'm going to get my title of the
[1:19:41] message out of out of the church age
[1:19:43] book a quote
[1:19:45] here on the end of the Samarian Church
[1:19:47] age
[1:19:49] 157 I think it's probably the third
[1:19:52] quote in that stack where it says if you
[1:19:55] are a
[1:19:56] Christian he says he the ha in the year
[1:19:58] let him hear what the spirit saith to
[1:20:00] the churches of each age in every age it
[1:20:02] was the same cry hear what the spirit
[1:20:04] says if you are a Christian you will get
[1:20:07] back to what the spirit is
[1:20:09] teaching so that's what I want to title
[1:20:12] this today is if you are you will not if
[1:20:16] you do you you are but if you are you
[1:20:20] will brother Israel are you a piano
[1:20:23] player so you you don't do the works of
[1:20:25] a piano player but your wife is a piano
[1:20:28] player sister Sharon if you are a piano
[1:20:31] player you'll play the
[1:20:34] piano
[1:20:36] right if you are a guitar player you
[1:20:39] will manifest that you are a guitar
[1:20:41] player so the the statement here is if
[1:20:44] you are you
[1:20:47] will if you were an
[1:20:49] eagle you'll Fly Like an Eagle and
[1:20:52] you'll live up there high and you'll see
[1:20:54] a far off and if you are Eagle you'll do
[1:20:56] what Eagles do if you are a
[1:21:00] Christian you will act like a
[1:21:03] Christian because you know that's what
[1:21:06] that's what Ephesians is telling us here
[1:21:07] what Paul was speaking to the Ephesians
[1:21:09] he said by Grace you're saved not of
[1:21:12] works but if you're saved you will do
[1:21:15] good
[1:21:16] works see if you are you
[1:21:21] will now let's pull up that uh that
[1:21:24] first quote there if you have it I'm
[1:21:26] going to read that one a little bit
[1:21:27] later but the first one there out of
[1:21:28] questions the answer number three when
[1:21:30] you're born as a
[1:21:33] human when you're born as a human the
[1:21:36] natural traits of a human being will
[1:21:37] follow you you won't live in a tree try
[1:21:40] to fly with your wings like a bird or
[1:21:41] something like that that isn't that that
[1:21:43] wouldn't be a normal human the normal
[1:21:44] actions of a human being the normal
[1:21:46] action of a human being would be to work
[1:21:48] have many have family do these things
[1:21:50] that's natural normal human beings
[1:21:52] because you're born that see you're born
[1:21:55] that then when you're born a Christian
[1:21:58] born of the spirit of God you naturally
[1:22:00] take up the attributes of Christ see
[1:22:02] when you're born a Christian it takes a
[1:22:06] birth then you will act like a Christian
[1:22:09] if Christ dwell in you then you will do
[1:22:12] the works of Christ brother BR said if
[1:22:14] Beethoven was in me I would write
[1:22:17] music if John Dillinger was in me I'd be
[1:22:20] a bad
[1:22:21] guy see and so when you receive
[1:22:25] Grace he gives you
[1:22:27] himself The Works that I do I don't do
[1:22:29] anymore it's not me anymore that does it
[1:22:32] I don't do by the I Do by the spirit of
[1:22:35] God yet I live but Christ lives in me
[1:22:37] it's not I that's
[1:22:39] living so now I'm going to die to that
[1:22:41] old person that tried to do all those
[1:22:43] things to get acceptance and I'm just
[1:22:44] going to accept by faith God's
[1:22:47] grace and then he comes and dwells the
[1:22:49] Holy Spirit and he starts to take over
[1:22:51] this
[1:22:52] vessel all right let's go to that one in
[1:22:54] the thot tyan CH Church age their Works
[1:22:58] testified to a new spirit
[1:23:00] within see your works are a testimony
[1:23:03] that there's something
[1:23:04] happened not the other way
[1:23:06] around men saw their good works and
[1:23:09] glorified God yes sir if you are a
[1:23:11] Christian you're going to do what is
[1:23:14] right you will do the right thing if
[1:23:16] you're a Christian does that mean you
[1:23:17] won't make mistak no you'll make
[1:23:19] mistakes but what does a Christian do
[1:23:21] when he makes a mistake or she
[1:23:24] Lord I'm sorry the Zeal of this age is
[1:23:27] what
[1:23:29] repent so if that was a Zeal of latest
[1:23:32] and age then that means we got some
[1:23:33] repenting to probably
[1:23:35] do oh here it comes I love it when it
[1:23:37] starts to come so in Proverbs there's a
[1:23:39] scripture that says a righteous man fall
[1:23:41] us seven times and gets back
[1:23:43] up but a sinner Falls to
[1:23:46] predition can't get back up you fall get
[1:23:49] back up don't stay down there I if you
[1:23:52] are a Christian you'll get back up
[1:23:56] don't let the devil keep you down there
[1:23:57] that's his job trying to make you doubt
[1:23:59] he's trying to make you doubt that Grace
[1:24:01] that you had he's trying to make you
[1:24:03] question you know I I struggle like all
[1:24:06] of you with complexes brother I got my
[1:24:08] own how many in here have had complexes
[1:24:11] or have one
[1:24:13] now brother Bram said we do brother Bram
[1:24:15] had
[1:24:17] complexes we go to school and we feel
[1:24:19] like everyone's picking on us and we're
[1:24:20] somehow awkward and odd I used to think
[1:24:22] man everyone knows some big secret about
[1:24:24] me and I'm the only one and they didn't
[1:24:25] tell me what it was and why is everyone
[1:24:27] you know I always thought I was the
[1:24:28] Oddball somehow and I am an oddball God
[1:24:32] just had to show me later what that
[1:24:34] meant right but it's true if if you are
[1:24:38] you will you will do these things
[1:24:41] because it's in you to do them but you
[1:24:43] know those complexes come on us and I
[1:24:45] think sometimes God just keeps us in a
[1:24:47] spot where we have to realize back to
[1:24:48] Grace
[1:24:49] again perfect strength and perfect
[1:24:52] weakness brother Brown said that if uh
[1:24:55] you know if uh if you have this complex
[1:24:58] and you feel like you can't do it he
[1:24:59] says then that's finally where God can
[1:25:00] use you but he said if you have a
[1:25:01] mindset like that he can't it's like a
[1:25:03] paradox he has to get you down there so
[1:25:06] you can stay humble so he can use you
[1:25:08] but he says you have to start to get
[1:25:09] confidence not in yourself but this word
[1:25:12] where you can stand there and say it's
[1:25:14] not
[1:25:15] me you know I was just sharing with
[1:25:17] brother Poe you know I used to be really
[1:25:21] awkward about saying that brother Billy
[1:25:22] Paul was my friend because I just felt
[1:25:25] like he's friends with everybody I'm not
[1:25:26] special but he called me a special
[1:25:28] friend and he did and I had a dream I'll
[1:25:30] just share that with you real quick I
[1:25:32] had a dream when I was in this house
[1:25:34] with a bunch of brothers and there was
[1:25:36] one of those old phones on the wall the
[1:25:37] old and it started ringing and someone
[1:25:39] answered and said it's for your brother
[1:25:40] baits and I picked it up and his brother
[1:25:41] BR he goes what are you doing I said
[1:25:43] well I'm just hanging out here with the
[1:25:44] brothers he goes you get ready I'm gonna
[1:25:45] pick you up I'm like oh man you know I'm
[1:25:48] in trouble or he's going to give me some
[1:25:49] big Revelation this car pulls up and the
[1:25:51] back door opens and brother bram's
[1:25:52] sitting in there and I get in there with
[1:25:53] him and someone's driving we went
[1:25:55] driving around went to the mall we went
[1:25:57] over here had some food end of the day
[1:25:59] he drops me back off I wake up and I'm
[1:26:02] like what was that no big Revelation no
[1:26:05] scolding which I probably had
[1:26:08] coming and then I just thought this is
[1:26:10] me I'm awake now after the dream I'm
[1:26:11] like what would it be just to be the
[1:26:13] friend of a prophet where he just wants
[1:26:15] to hang out with you for a
[1:26:16] day and so I told David brand him that
[1:26:18] you know David and I are buddies and I
[1:26:20] told David that story and he goes
[1:26:21] brother Bates you can't even accept my
[1:26:23] dad as your friend how in the world are
[1:26:24] you going to accept brother Bram as your
[1:26:27] friend you know cuz I just felt like I'm
[1:26:29] not worthy to be brother Billy's friend
[1:26:30] and he says that and I've done some
[1:26:32] things and I was used to be embarrassed
[1:26:33] because I think if people thought I was
[1:26:35] talking about brother Billy and my
[1:26:36] friendship that I was trying to endorse
[1:26:37] myself or something but he told me I was
[1:26:39] his friend and he red me to his house
[1:26:41] for dinner and did all these things with
[1:26:42] me and I just thought that everyone got
[1:26:44] that
[1:26:45] privilege a lot of people did I'm not
[1:26:46] the only one but I started thinking
[1:26:49] about what Brother David told me and
[1:26:50] about two weeks later I was laying in
[1:26:51] bed and the Lord woke me up and just
[1:26:52] said if you can't accept
[1:26:58] the son of my prophet's friendship or my
[1:27:01] prophets what about
[1:27:04] mine you don't deserve my pardon but I
[1:27:06] gave it to you freely it's a gift I gave
[1:27:09] you you don't deserve it stop Walling
[1:27:11] around and accept
[1:27:13] it we sit there and we say well I'm not
[1:27:15] worthy so the complex that I had was
[1:27:18] this message is right and you couldn't
[1:27:19] tell me it was wrong Dil was too late
[1:27:22] for that but he come to me and said I
[1:27:24] wasn't worthy to be part of it I'm not
[1:27:26] good enough to be I wasn't good enough
[1:27:27] to be part of it it's Grace it's a
[1:27:30] gift God wants you to know it has
[1:27:32] nothing to do with anything you do or
[1:27:35] try to do he by Grace he saves you unmar
[1:27:39] favor and he wants you to have
[1:27:41] confidence in that not your works or
[1:27:43] what you do or well you know they didn't
[1:27:46] understand God's love it says in the
[1:27:47] church age book get about page 116 117
[1:27:50] you read about
[1:27:51] that he said they they thought God's
[1:27:53] love meant Oh that sunny skies was God
[1:27:56] was happy with me and stormy skies is
[1:27:57] he's not happy he says no had nothing to
[1:27:59] do with that God just chose you by
[1:28:01] election God's love is
[1:28:03] elective and because he chose to love
[1:28:05] you it's
[1:28:07] enough if you got to go and get your
[1:28:09] head lobed off like John the Baptist if
[1:28:11] you got to get hung upside down like
[1:28:12] Peter it doesn't matter because he loves
[1:28:15] you you're part of you're part of his
[1:28:18] body he bought you with a price you're
[1:28:20] not your
[1:28:22] own and if by Grace he chose you then
[1:28:25] whatever lot you have in life whatever
[1:28:27] trial you have to go through Just Praise
[1:28:28] the
[1:28:30] Lord he didn't say he was going to take
[1:28:32] away the
[1:28:34] scary he's like a parent sister Robin
[1:28:37] did you ever tell your kids that were
[1:28:39] scared of the dark hey I'm going to turn
[1:28:40] off the light it's going to get dark in
[1:28:41] here but don't be afraid because I'm
[1:28:42] just right
[1:28:44] here that's what brother BR said in the
[1:28:45] church H book he says like a mother with
[1:28:47] parental care saying fear not he said
[1:28:50] every time something scary was fixing to
[1:28:51] happen God said fear not don't be Afra
[1:28:54] afid cuz I'm with you even in you to the
[1:28:57] end I'm not going to take away the scary
[1:28:59] I'm not going to take away the dark it's
[1:29:01] going to get so dark you can't see your
[1:29:02] hand in front of your face but don't
[1:29:03] fear little sister there's a man here
[1:29:05] that can turn on the
[1:29:06] light he said we're not going to go
[1:29:08] through the tribulation but we'll go
[1:29:10] right up to it it's going to get dark
[1:29:12] the squeez is going to get tighter but
[1:29:14] don't worry because by Grace God said so
[1:29:18] we have something we can rest
[1:29:21] in all right so
[1:29:24] see he says your Works will show that
[1:29:26] your heart is
[1:29:28] right and it won't be something you put
[1:29:30] on for you will do his will when no one
[1:29:32] but God sees you that's Integrity the
[1:29:34] definition of integrity is you act that
[1:29:36] way when no one's
[1:29:40] watching right John Allen I mean that's
[1:29:43] Integrity you this is how you are when
[1:29:45] no one's watching but God because that's
[1:29:48] who you are not what you try to pretend
[1:29:50] to be we were talking last night about
[1:29:52] putting in peacock feathers
[1:29:54] sometimes we try to pattern oursel after
[1:29:56] somebody I I used to say Lord why' you
[1:29:58] call me to
[1:29:59] speak I'm not worthy I don't feel
[1:30:02] qualified I don't feel any of that
[1:30:04] stuff so then I see some preacher like
[1:30:07] John's
[1:30:08] dad and I was like I can't preach like
[1:30:11] that he goes I didn't call you to preach
[1:30:13] like that you just go up there and share
[1:30:15] my love to the people and let me do the
[1:30:16] rest get out the way get out my way and
[1:30:18] let me do the work has nothing to do
[1:30:19] with you I chose you by Grace I have
[1:30:22] something for you to do just get out of
[1:30:24] my way and let me do
[1:30:25] it that's
[1:30:27] it so it's something you do when no one
[1:30:30] when when no one that God sees you
[1:30:32] you'll do his will even if it cost you
[1:30:33] your
[1:30:34] life how many feel that
[1:30:37] way this is not a pretend we're not
[1:30:39] playing church I've received Grace I'll
[1:30:42] I'll give my life for
[1:30:44] this true
[1:30:46] story you know can I just say things in
[1:30:49] this church could I just be at
[1:30:51] home there's so much controversy going
[1:30:54] on right now trying to separate the
[1:30:56] bride tapes this don't tapes that that's
[1:31:00] the devil you can't separate God in this
[1:31:05] message but they try to do it everybody
[1:31:08] should be a tape Church tapes are my
[1:31:10] life they are my
[1:31:12] life what the tape say we're going to
[1:31:15] read a few
[1:31:17] quotes and so if you are you
[1:31:20] will if you are a Christian you will do
[1:31:22] it Christ said to do not because you're
[1:31:26] trying to work your way I don't come to
[1:31:28] church because I'm trying to earn
[1:31:29] something but he said if the love of God
[1:31:31] was in your heart you couldn't wait for
[1:31:32] those doors to open fellowship with your
[1:31:34] brothers and
[1:31:36] sisters we should do
[1:31:39] that you know but then I have people
[1:31:41] come to me and they start trying to
[1:31:42] blast Brother Joseph and I said you know
[1:31:43] what you stop right there I'm not taking
[1:31:45] anything against my brother I spend time
[1:31:48] with him I know his heart i' take a
[1:31:49] bullet for that man I don't understand
[1:31:51] everything he's doing but I don't have
[1:31:52] to God didn't call me to do that you
[1:31:55] just let God take care of it you think
[1:31:57] anything's out of God's control he knows
[1:31:59] everything that's going on everything's
[1:32:01] for a purpose it's all working for his
[1:32:02] good just relax and rest in this message
[1:32:05] don't wrestle and fight we got Grace
[1:32:10] here all right so this church age Book
[1:32:13] quote
[1:32:14] 157 he says every Messenger to every age
[1:32:17] will preach that word every fresh and
[1:32:18] true Revival will be because men have
[1:32:19] gotten back to that word for their age
[1:32:22] The Cry of every age is to rebuke you
[1:32:24] have left the word of God repent come
[1:32:26] back to the word right from the first
[1:32:29] book in the Bible Genesis to the last
[1:32:31] book Revelations there's only one reason
[1:32:34] for God's displeasure okay if we could
[1:32:36] just take that one thing
[1:32:39] today well God's displeased with me for
[1:32:41] this and that and there's 100 no there's
[1:32:42] only one reason from the entire book of
[1:32:44] Genesis to Revelations that God's
[1:32:46] displeased with you believe in the
[1:32:51] word when we when we we're fortified
[1:32:54] behind the word of God a parent puts us
[1:32:55] there he walls us all in the only way
[1:32:58] for the devil to get to you is if you go
[1:33:00] out he can't get in there where you're
[1:33:02] at so we all do that we get enticed to
[1:33:05] go out from behind the
[1:33:07] word and that's the only reason for
[1:33:09] God's dis pleasure there's only one
[1:33:10] reason leaving the word and there's only
[1:33:13] one remedy to regain his
[1:33:15] favor back to the
[1:33:18] word so our life as a Christian is by
[1:33:21] Grace I'm saved there's nothing I can do
[1:33:22] to Merit it but when I get myself in
[1:33:25] trouble is when I've left the word I've
[1:33:26] left
[1:33:27] Grace there's only one way to gain his
[1:33:29] favor back and that's go back to the
[1:33:31] word how many want his
[1:33:33] favor Enoch found favor with
[1:33:36] God he found his
[1:33:39] favor because he stay in that
[1:33:42] word you see where we have to live if
[1:33:44] you are a Christian you will he goes on
[1:33:47] down here about the Ephesian age but
[1:33:50] look at that last second to last
[1:33:51] paragraph if you are true seed if you
[1:33:55] are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:33:57] you will esteem his word above your
[1:34:00] necessary meat and you're to live by
[1:34:02] every word brother Caleb we just had
[1:34:05] that conversation that proceeds out of
[1:34:06] the mouth of God so you will yearn for
[1:34:10] that if you are a Christian your life
[1:34:11] will be this
[1:34:13] word it's like you know I'm staying
[1:34:16] right
[1:34:17] here some shiny preacher will come along
[1:34:21] that's why you don't even I don't want
[1:34:22] you to get to Jim bat's revelation I
[1:34:24] don't want to point you to me if I do
[1:34:25] that
[1:34:26] run there's only one thing that's been
[1:34:29] Vindicated and that's this Vindicated
[1:34:30] word and I all I want to see is a
[1:34:31] relationship with you and that that's
[1:34:34] it so if I get in the way somehow and
[1:34:36] you see me pointing someone way don't
[1:34:39] trust this guy right
[1:34:40] here I'm telling you it's honest to God
[1:34:43] truth God knows my heart strike me dead
[1:34:45] right here my whole heart being up here
[1:34:48] is to get enough out of the way where
[1:34:49] all I can do is encourage you to stay
[1:34:51] with this
[1:34:52] word not I think about it not what I
[1:34:54] tell you about it but what it
[1:34:57] says I'm telling you it's honest God
[1:35:00] truth you know there's two Spirits
[1:35:02] within this framework we read that quote
[1:35:03] and brother BR said in the beginning of
[1:35:04] it if we can learn to this withstand
[1:35:06] that Antichrist Spirit we'll be a
[1:35:07] Invincible Army how many sees that right
[1:35:10] so there's two Spirits you watch this is
[1:35:12] just now your brother talking to
[1:35:14] you my observation is that Antichrist
[1:35:16] spirit always points you to something
[1:35:18] else besides Jesus Christ it points you
[1:35:20] to us our movement our group what we're
[1:35:22] doing myself my Ministry forget all that
[1:35:25] nonsense it's not about any of that
[1:35:28] brother brother Israel asked me to he
[1:35:30] says well what what do you want to I
[1:35:32] said brother Israel I'm here subjecting
[1:35:33] myself to the the local authority of
[1:35:35] this
[1:35:36] church I subject my gift to the pastor
[1:35:39] of this church I said if you just have
[1:35:40] me sit there I'll sit there it's not
[1:35:42] about gym baits I don't want I don't
[1:35:44] have an
[1:35:45] agenda the agenda is is his word it's
[1:35:49] it's his spirit it's his life that's the
[1:35:52] agenda
[1:35:54] then he says well now you've done that
[1:35:55] you're going to preach both I'm like
[1:35:57] there you go backfires right but I'm
[1:35:58] serious when you want when you're
[1:36:00] sincerely say Lord I don't care what
[1:36:02] happens I just want your
[1:36:04] will then be willed to accept it good or
[1:36:06] bad if that means you got to preach them
[1:36:08] both
[1:36:09] right see and that's the thing about it
[1:36:12] is if you are you will esteem this word
[1:36:15] more than your necessary meat every word
[1:36:17] that proceeds out of the mouth of God
[1:36:18] Caleb and I just had some fellowship
[1:36:19] yesterday around that love that brother
[1:36:22] he was saying some good stuff to me he
[1:36:24] was encouraging
[1:36:25] me I don't I'm I'm a fast talker he kind
[1:36:29] of Heats more slow he likes to process
[1:36:30] things and I was kind of like just fire
[1:36:32] hosing out there he's like whoa whoa
[1:36:33] slow down brother bass let me just catch
[1:36:35] up here a little bit you're just like
[1:36:37] you all these quotes start coming in
[1:36:38] scriptures and all that and he's just
[1:36:40] sitting there like okay we're just slow
[1:36:42] this thing down and I have to do that my
[1:36:44] personality I have to start thinking in
[1:36:45] my head really super intentionally let
[1:36:47] silence do the heavy lifting Jim Bates
[1:36:50] let silence do the heavy lifting it's
[1:36:53] hard because sometimes silence is a

[1:39:18] means you
[1:39:20] were the only way you could be a
[1:39:22] Christian is if you were in God's mind
[1:39:23] before there was world we know the eagle
[1:39:24] story let's read some quotes to
[1:39:25] encourage you about that modern events
[1:39:27] made clear by prophecy if you are a son
[1:39:29] of God or a daughter of God you were in
[1:39:31] God all the time
[1:39:33] Hallelujah now you can just punch the
[1:39:35] devil with that
[1:39:37] one guess what devil I am because I
[1:39:40] was I am a Christian because I was in
[1:39:43] God's mind I am an eagle because I was
[1:39:45] an eagle to begin
[1:39:47] with
[1:39:49] Hallelujah but he knew what bed and time
[1:39:51] that you be planted so now made a
[1:39:53] creature a Son of God manifest a son or
[1:39:55] daughter of God to meet the challenge of
[1:39:57] this hour to vindicate the true and
[1:39:59] living God of this hour the message is
[1:40:01] coming forth for this time that's right
[1:40:03] you were done but there before the
[1:40:04] foundation of the world he knew exactly
[1:40:06] that you would be
[1:40:08] here we look back at all those Bible
[1:40:10] stories and I used to love all those
[1:40:11] bibl I still do but they're looking at
[1:40:14] us you lived in Helo
[1:40:19] deia oh yeah we were burned up and lions
[1:40:21] and all that but you guys had to go
[1:40:22] through all this pressure this craziness
[1:40:25] this every day now just like a
[1:40:29] barrage how in the world could you stay
[1:40:31] sane the only way you can do is have an
[1:40:33] anchor there is no way in your mental
[1:40:35] faculties you can stay sane in this kind
[1:40:36] of a world it's nuts and brother Brown
[1:40:39] propes it' be this
[1:40:41] way I love this he chose you for this
[1:40:44] hour you are a Christian today for this
[1:40:47] hour you will be the message of this
[1:40:50] hour you'll reflect it
[1:40:54] that's right you were down there before
[1:40:55] the foundation of the world it wasn't if
[1:40:56] you want to choose that no matter how
[1:40:58] much you try to impersonate it you'll
[1:40:59] never make it how could you get blood
[1:41:01] from a turnup and there's no blood there
[1:41:03] thank God there was something here what
[1:41:06] brown said in church a book proba 154
[1:41:09] somewhere in there and nonseed there's
[1:41:10] nothing to
[1:41:12] Quicken he said you you could be reborn
[1:41:14] because you were
[1:41:16] seed if you are you
[1:41:18] were he planted a seed you received it
[1:41:21] there was for ordained ground to receed
[1:41:23] the seed word for this hour be thankful
[1:41:26] that something quickened in
[1:41:27] you well I don't know brother Bates I
[1:41:29] don't know well did you did you hear the
[1:41:31] word now if you're raised in the message
[1:41:33] you've heard the message all your life
[1:41:35] but one day God will speak to you and
[1:41:37] that voice will it'll be different to
[1:41:40] you you young people are raising this
[1:41:42] message you've heard it all your life
[1:41:45] but you still need to be
[1:41:46] saved you need to hear it different one
[1:41:49] day my sheep hear my voice and another
[1:41:51] they won't follow let's go into the
[1:41:54] Rapture now in the beginning way back
[1:41:57] way years before there was a time began
[1:41:59] you if you are a born again Christian T
[1:42:00] night you were God then your father you
[1:42:03] were in God you were in the word then
[1:42:05] you were in
[1:42:07] God that's why when you come in this
[1:42:09] life here profess Christianity well
[1:42:11] everything going wrong you've wondered
[1:42:12] why this and all this and you wondered
[1:42:14] at that but one day something struck you
[1:42:16] what was it that life that was down in
[1:42:18] there from the
[1:42:21] beginning oh yeah we still have this
[1:42:23] Reasoner the greatest battle ever
[1:42:24] thought's going to be right here but
[1:42:27] there's an
[1:42:29] anchor I know how many can say I
[1:42:32] know my redeemer liveth I know something
[1:42:35] happened on the
[1:42:36] inside hey before we end this today I'm
[1:42:39] goingon to give you a recipe to make
[1:42:41] sure I'm going to give you a recipe
[1:42:43] written by a prophet a recipe that if
[1:42:46] you follow it you'll get these
[1:42:49] results now I can't make you be seed or
[1:42:52] not seed but if you could take God out
[1:42:54] his word and follow recipe then he's
[1:42:57] obligated stop wondering if you're in or
[1:42:59] out start acting like you
[1:43:02] are we're going to get that just to give
[1:43:04] me a second Philadelphia and church AG
[1:43:07] now I believe in Good Conduct if you are
[1:43:09] saved you will do righteously we've been
[1:43:11] through that but let me tell you now
[1:43:13] salvation is not Jesus plus
[1:43:15] anything it's Jesus
[1:43:18] alone I think the message has lost this
[1:43:20] concept in a in a bigger broader sense
[1:43:25] I was telling yesterday about David
[1:43:26] braham's testimony the prophet's
[1:43:28] grandson had a medical record that thick
[1:43:32] couldn't figure out what's wrong with
[1:43:33] him so they sent him over to or Roberts
[1:43:36] Medical you know that brother brother
[1:43:38] Roberts told any family of brother Brams
[1:43:40] welcome over here no bill just send him
[1:43:42] over this doctor sitting there looking
[1:43:44] through all his stacks of paper and
[1:43:46] David sitting there young man he goes
[1:43:48] you know what your problem is son he
[1:43:49] says you need to get saved he led the
[1:43:52] prophet's Grand un to the Lord right
[1:43:53] there in his
[1:43:56] office and now if you talk to that man
[1:43:58] this message is everything to him but he
[1:44:00] had to get
[1:44:02] saved oh yeah we're not going to go dice
[1:44:05] words over we know that Jesus Christ is
[1:44:07] this message but he's a person he's
[1:44:09] alive he's a being he's he's somebody
[1:44:11] wants to meet you and have a
[1:44:12] relationship with you it can't just be
[1:44:14] an intellectual approach it's got to be
[1:44:17] something you just know it could start
[1:44:19] out with a
[1:44:20] child now I hear now I lay me down the
[1:44:23] sleep that man in the military that was
[1:44:24] dying that chaplain said go back where
[1:44:26] you left him he's there waiting for you
[1:44:27] and he went all the way back to now I
[1:44:29] lay me down to sleep you know God's
[1:44:30] right there waiting for you to meet you
[1:44:32] at your
[1:44:33] level you don't have to know all the
[1:44:35] Mysteries he is the mystery and he'll
[1:44:37] reveal it to you but you got to come to
[1:44:38] him it's Jesus alone it's not Jesus plus
[1:44:41] anything it's not Jesus plus your good
[1:44:42] works it's salvation of the Lord from
[1:44:45] start to finish let his life be in me
[1:44:47] let it be his blood that cleanses me let
[1:44:49] it be his spirit that fills me let it be
[1:44:51] his word in my heart and mouth let it be
[1:44:53] his stripes that heal me Let It Be Jesus
[1:44:54] and Jesus alone not by works of
[1:44:56] righteous which I have done no sir
[1:44:57] Christ is my life it's not because of
[1:44:59] how much I know the
[1:45:00] message 1 Corinthians 13 I can have all
[1:45:03] the Mysteries all Faith to move
[1:45:05] mountains have all the gifts speaking
[1:45:07] tongues do all those things but if I
[1:45:08] don't have love I am nothing Lord will
[1:45:11] maybe tonight I'll share a little my
[1:45:12] testimony about love and what it did to
[1:45:18] me land's Book of
[1:45:21] Life Now believer you've got your joy
[1:45:23] shoes on you ready you got that quote
[1:45:26] L's Book of Life listen to this one have
[1:45:28] you got your joy shoes
[1:45:30] on listen to this if you are a Christian
[1:45:33] if you truly are a God child the Bible
[1:45:35] said Oh that's oh preacher that Bible
[1:45:37] says your name was written on the last's
[1:45:39] book of life before the foundation of
[1:45:40] the world the same time that Christ that
[1:45:43] God said Christ would be slain he wrote
[1:45:44] your name there Hallelujah so when he
[1:45:47] died on the cross you were there you
[1:45:49] were in him then
[1:45:53] my name is there this this get written
[1:45:56] there one day at a chch church service
[1:45:57] it was already there that's why I could
[1:45:58] have the church service accept him I
[1:46:01] actually got it in the truck cab of my
[1:46:03] little truck I wasn't at church I think
[1:46:05] God knew how I had to get it I played in
[1:46:08] a rock band had big hair I'll tell you
[1:46:09] my testimony a little bit tonight we'll
[1:46:11] see you guys yeah I don't have any hair
[1:46:13] now but I had big hair played in the
[1:46:15] rock band played a base but not as good
[1:46:18] as our brother I don't think rock band
[1:46:20] all you got to do is four chords and
[1:46:21] play him fast and hard
[1:46:24] well it was the leag guitar player of
[1:46:26] that band that handed me my first
[1:46:27] tape there is a man here can turn on the
[1:46:29] light and I played that tape with my
[1:46:31] truck for three days I'm not going to
[1:46:32] share my testimony now but it changed
[1:46:35] me all those things went away I didn't
[1:46:38] have to quit nothing I found what I was
[1:46:41] looking
[1:46:43] for questions and answers number one if
[1:46:45] you're filled with the Holy Ghost this
[1:46:46] morning and God's power is moving in
[1:46:48] every fiber of your body what God would
[1:46:50] it do for you to stand in the Judgment
[1:46:51] you're already judged stop worrying
[1:46:53] about judgment you got a perfect
[1:46:56] sacrifice it's already been judged it's
[1:46:59] been received and filled and already
[1:47:00] translated in Heavenly places with
[1:47:01] Christ Jesus so now if you are you are
[1:47:04] you're are you were there that's where
[1:47:06] you are now you're seated in Heavenly
[1:47:09] places in Christ Jesus if we can get
[1:47:11] this I'm going to give you this recipe
[1:47:12] then we're going to be done but I want
[1:47:13] to give you a couple of these quotes
[1:47:14] just to hammer this
[1:47:18] down see not you will be you are now
[1:47:21] translated
[1:47:24] well someday I'll be translated not no
[1:47:26] you are
[1:47:27] now the token remember he said you could
[1:47:29] be just as satisfied with that as you
[1:47:31] could the price that it paid for we
[1:47:34] should have our joy shoes on shouting
[1:47:35] that God gave us a token my price is
[1:47:38] paid I'm already
[1:47:39] there I makes me think of that story
[1:47:42] about swick you know when the bear and
[1:47:44] the caribou and that whole thing and and
[1:47:46] he has that and and Bud's still kind of
[1:47:48] like well brother Bram you know that
[1:47:50] doesn't look like 42 inch rack to me
[1:47:51] that looks like 102 and he's a a guide
[1:47:53] and he has a rifle I mean there must
[1:47:54] have been something that Happ that's
[1:47:55] just me but I believe something happened
[1:47:57] to that rat supernaturally because the
[1:47:59] vision said it was
[1:48:01] 42 and Bud's going brother Bram he said
[1:48:03] they were trading off packing the head
[1:48:04] and it was dragging the ground the
[1:48:05] antlers were dragging the ground so this
[1:48:08] looking with his eyes but the word said
[1:48:11] 42 I don't care what my eyes say I don't
[1:48:14] care what the circumstances say the word
[1:48:17] said and he said after he got the
[1:48:19] Caribou now he's doubting about the rack
[1:48:22] and then he's about the bear and then
[1:48:23] they get the bear this is what he said
[1:48:25] he said brother Braham
[1:48:27] if how many of us put an if in there if
[1:48:30] when we get back to Camp those antlers
[1:48:32] are 42 I'm going to have a run and fit
[1:48:33] brother man says you might as well have
[1:48:34] it
[1:48:37] now if there's going to be if there's G
[1:48:39] if if if these quotes are
[1:48:42] true people wrestle with these quotes
[1:48:44] they fuss with these quotes they make
[1:48:45] this out of the quotes but they're my
[1:48:46] quotes those are my grapes in the
[1:48:49] promise I don't care how many Camp wall
[1:48:50] cities and Giants there are if he said
[1:48:52] oh ride this Trail again he meant what
[1:48:54] he said and I don't have to understand
[1:48:55] it or believe it or figure it out I just
[1:48:56] believe it I mean I have to believe it
[1:48:57] that's it I receive it I'm a receiver
[1:49:01] not a Reasoner but a
[1:49:03] receiver
[1:49:05] right if God said it that's your anchor
[1:49:08] that's your rest you you said you were a
[1:49:10] Christian Christians believe the
[1:49:12] word he might make it sound like I can't
[1:49:16] see how that's going to
[1:49:17] be don't worry just say what the word
[1:49:19] said God will take care of the rest of
[1:49:21] it he said you might as well have a run
[1:49:23] and fit now because they're going to be
[1:49:24] 42 and they are to this day 42 it's a
[1:49:27] miracle because they usually shrink
[1:49:29] you've seen that rack R day we were
[1:49:31] there
[1:49:33] together saw that tape stretched out
[1:49:35] there still to this day 42 exactly
[1:49:37] because God said so it will rain how do
[1:49:39] you know Moses because God said so Noah
[1:49:42] how do you know no Daddy you sure it's
[1:49:44] yeah God said
[1:49:45] so don't worry about this what
[1:49:47] everyone's saying about the word of God
[1:49:49] don't let them explain it away from you
[1:49:50] and don't let them explain it to you he
[1:49:52] doesn't need an interpreter he's his own
[1:49:54] interpreter we just rest in it we don't
[1:49:56] have to worry about it we just rest in
[1:49:57] this word CU if you are a Christian you
[1:50:00] will believe
[1:50:01] itall you won't falter you won't let
[1:50:03] them do this that or the other thing
[1:50:05] it's not my job to figure all that out
[1:50:06] it's my job to believe
[1:50:08] it if he comes to me later and says okay
[1:50:11] this is this is the interpretation of
[1:50:12] that I'll accept it but he didn't ask me
[1:50:14] to do anything but believe it can you
[1:50:16] imagine Mary how many young ladies in
[1:50:18] here haven't been married before any
[1:50:21] young ladies in here never been married
[1:50:24] can you imagine can you imagine Mary an
[1:50:26] angel comes a messenger a messenger
[1:50:28] comes through with a message impossible
[1:50:30] to believe you're gonna have a baby and
[1:50:34] she asked the how can that be question
[1:50:36] like we all would and he told her and
[1:50:38] she says okay let it be according to
[1:50:40] your
[1:50:42] word she didn't have to go do anything
[1:50:45] if you are a
[1:50:46] Believer will it started showing that
[1:50:48] she believed it she had evidence that
[1:50:50] she believed it and she couldn't hide it
[1:50:52] Hallelujah huah I love that Mary's
[1:50:55] belief she believed that she received
[1:50:58] the word and it started proving out that
[1:51:00] she P because look you can't hide that
[1:51:02] she can't hide that the word's in you
[1:51:05] it'll start to
[1:51:07] show take an impossible message and just
[1:51:10] accept it believe it watch what God will
[1:51:12] do man Allelujah I felt like I could
[1:51:14] preach almost about now and I a even a
[1:51:17] preacher that's the
[1:51:20] truth those he called he's Justified

[1:51:28] everlasting life and can't perish it's
[1:51:30] already in heaven Hallelujah can we
[1:51:32] accept that today can we believe
[1:51:36] that I've already passed it okay I don't
[1:51:38] care about tomorrow I'm going to make a
[1:51:39] mistake or that he he's
[1:51:41] already put me there because I've
[1:51:44] accepted his
[1:51:46] sacrifice it's perfect there's no fault
[1:51:48] in
[1:51:48] it man I'm telling you it's the truth

[1:52:05] going to
[1:52:06] close but look at Lord show us the
[1:52:08] father and it suffices
[1:52:10] us this is what the Christian Life
[1:52:12] should be what do you have to do with
[1:52:14] the tree you take the tree you plant the
[1:52:15] tree in the
[1:52:17] ground and then you have to water it and
[1:52:19] as you water it it doesn't do nothing
[1:52:21] but drink drink drink
[1:52:23] it has to drink more than its portion
[1:52:26] and it more it drinks the bigger it
[1:52:28] swells up it just pushes out limbs it
[1:52:31] pushes out leaves it pushes out blossoms
[1:52:33] pushes out apples is that right that's
[1:52:35] the way a Christian is if you are a
[1:52:37] Christian you'll drink drink
[1:52:39] drink get into the tapes get that
[1:52:42] unbelief baked out of you that's what he
[1:52:43] said lay in the presence of the sun we
[1:52:45] have a perfect
[1:52:47] message preacher telling us we got to go
[1:52:49] beyond brother Bram nonsense he said on
[1:52:52] tape Christ revealed his own word

[1:55:33] here's the recipe we're going to end
[1:55:35] here how am I doing on time brother am I
[1:55:38] good all
[1:55:40] right I've got like four quotes here to
[1:55:43] show you that the recipe is not just one
[1:55:44] but I'll I'll lead you I'll start with
[1:55:46] the first one principles of Divine
[1:55:48] Healing starting a prayer line he says
[1:55:50] now the only thing a minister could do
[1:55:51] to we preach to salvation in in the
[1:55:54] cross he couldn't save you there's no
[1:55:55] preacher tell you he could save you he
[1:55:57] asked you to accept what Jesus has
[1:55:58] already done I'm up here telling you to
[1:55:59] accept what Jesus's already done I can't
[1:56:00] do anything for you it's already done
[1:56:03] this is what he says here how many of
[1:56:05] you are pastors do that raise at your
[1:56:07] hand sure you accept Christ now he can't
[1:56:10] he can he can preach but he can't save
[1:56:12] but he points you to Calvary you accept
[1:56:14] it then when you come up and say now I
[1:56:16] take Jesus as my personal savior you
[1:56:17] believe in your heart that you are saved
[1:56:19] now the Critics on the outside say oh
[1:56:20] John there's no difference in you you
[1:56:22] look the same as you always but you
[1:56:24] might look the same you might not feel
[1:56:25] any different but in your heart you
[1:56:26] believe you're
[1:56:27] different now listen to this here's the
[1:56:29] recipe you ready for this I want you to
[1:56:31] get this recipe and follow this see then
[1:56:34] you confess that you're different he
[1:56:36] that will confess me before men I'll
[1:56:37] confess him before my father and the
[1:56:38] Holy Angels now if you believe you're
[1:56:40] better you say you're better you act
[1:56:42] like you're better you say yes sir I'm
[1:56:44] saved you associate with those that are
[1:56:45] saved you believe you're saved you act
[1:56:47] like you're saved and it works
[1:56:48] righteousness
[1:56:52] that's the recipe I believe in my heart
[1:56:54] I'm saved I'm gonna start confessing I'm
[1:56:57] saved I'm gonna start acting like I'm
[1:56:58] saved I'm gonna start hanging around
[1:56:59] people that are
[1:57:01] saved it works
[1:57:05] righteousness oh yeah you want to see
[1:57:07] let's go to the next one Ministry
[1:57:08] explained I want to show you that he
[1:57:10] said this more than
[1:57:11] once he says when you accept it you
[1:57:13] believe it somebody says let's see if
[1:57:14] you look any different you still got
[1:57:16] brown eyes you're still just the same as
[1:57:17] you were can't show nothing that you're
[1:57:19] saved only you're testifying of the
[1:57:21] Unseen your face has your saved what do
[1:57:23] you do you believe you're saved then you
[1:57:25] say you're saved then you act like
[1:57:26] you're saved you associate with those
[1:57:27] that are saved and it works
[1:57:28] righteousness is that right after a
[1:57:30] while everybody knows you're
[1:57:33] saved you're in the battle Satan's
[1:57:36] battling trying to tell you you're not
[1:57:37] saved he's trying to tell you you only
[1:57:39] thought you got saved but you believe
[1:57:41] that in your heart you're saved now just
[1:57:43] follow the rest of the recipe do what he
[1:57:46] said how many could do
[1:57:49] that say you're saved
[1:57:52] say it out loud I'm
[1:57:54] saved now start acting like it and
[1:57:56] associate with those that are saved and
[1:57:58] it will work righteousness to you the
[1:58:00] prophet said
[1:58:01] so let's look at one
[1:58:04] more whatever he says you to do you do
[1:58:06] it that's in 1953 he says now before you
[1:58:09] could be saved I hear many times say oh
[1:58:11] it hit me in the face like a Russian
[1:58:12] Mighty Wind well that might be right but
[1:58:14] that wasn't why you were saved I was in
[1:58:16] a meting man I felt the presence of God
[1:58:18] that's not why you're
[1:58:19] saved you were saved because you
[1:58:21] believed
[1:58:23] see how simple this message is only
[1:58:28] believe no matter what other experience
[1:58:31] went with it first thing you had to
[1:58:32] believe and if you didn't feel anything
[1:58:33] Jesus never asked you if you if you felt
[1:58:35] it this is my feeling well I don't know
[1:58:38] if I feel like I'm I don't know if I
[1:58:40] feel like I got healed I don't know if I
[1:58:41] feel like I got saved stop acting like
[1:58:44] that that's negative you start
[1:58:46] confessing what the word said it's
[1:58:48] 42 I don't care what my eyes tell I
[1:58:50] don't care how I feel he didn't ask if
[1:58:51] you felt it he said ' Do you believe it
[1:58:54] he says' you doubt that but but goes no
[1:58:55] brother Bram I just don't understand he
[1:58:56] goes neither do I understand but I don't
[1:58:57] have to the vision
[1:58:59] said just say what he
[1:59:02] said you see how simple this recipe is
[1:59:05] why did God change my thought this
[1:59:06] morning I don't know but somebody in
[1:59:08] here is
[1:59:09] struggling with their
[1:59:11] salvation and he wants you to know it's
[1:59:14] not that
[1:59:15] hard by Grace you're saved through faith
[1:59:18] that you believe the word of God let him
[1:59:20] take care of putting the works in you
[1:59:22] drink drink drink and you'll start
[1:59:23] pushing out you'll act like a Christian
[1:59:25] you'll say you're saved you'll act like
[1:59:26] you're saved you'll associate with those
[1:59:28] that are saved it will work
[1:59:29] righteousness to
[1:59:30] you but that wasn't why you're saved
[1:59:32] you're saved because you believe no
[1:59:33] matter what other experience went with
[1:59:35] it first thing you had to believe if you
[1:59:36] didn't feel anything Jus never ask
[1:59:38] people they filled it it's it's isn't by
[1:59:40] filling it's by faith so you believe it
[1:59:41] and you just get up from there and
[1:59:43] something in your heart tells you you're
[1:59:44] saved you go out and you tell people I'm
[1:59:46] saved you confess you're saved you
[1:59:48] believe you're saved you act like you're
[1:59:49] saved it works salvation and after while
[1:59:52] the whole world
[1:59:53] knows knows that you're saved because
[1:59:55] you believe you're saved but the moment
[1:59:57] you think you're not saved and quit
[1:59:58] testifying of being saved you go right
[2:00:00] back down the same rout why he can't
[2:00:02] work to do nothing for you because he's
[2:00:04] the high priest of your
[2:00:05] confession don't let the devil trick you
[2:00:08] into confessing that well I don't know
[2:00:09] if I'm saved anymore I did this and I
[2:00:11] did that nonsense he didn't save you to
[2:00:14] lose you what kind of a god do you think
[2:00:15] you're
[2:00:17] servant he wouldn't have saved you in
[2:00:19] the first place if he thought he was
[2:00:20] going to lose you his works are perfect
[2:00:22] from beginning to
[2:00:24] end if he's got that lump of clay and
[2:00:27] maybe you're looking at brother Israel
[2:00:28] and he's got that lump of clay all
[2:00:29] squished down you're looking at brother
[2:00:30] Israel like man I don't know if that
[2:00:31] looks but that's God's work leave it
[2:00:32] alone it's perfect from beginning to
[2:00:35] end I'm just teasing my brother Israel
[2:00:37] but he's looking pretty good to me but
[2:00:41] God knows he sees down there on the
[2:00:42] inside of the
[2:00:43] inside but stop struggling with it if
[2:00:46] you know you look at somebody they're
[2:00:47] God's work remember that story of that I
[2:00:51] think it was it was uh brother Joe
[2:00:53] Dalton's wife that was a little piano
[2:00:55] player that brother Bram had to play the
[2:00:57] piano and she had some makeup and stuff
[2:00:58] on and they were looking on the outside
[2:01:01] who was it Jim j Jim's da Jim Ed's wife
[2:01:05] yeah Mary yeah see the people were
[2:01:08] looking on the outside that she was
[2:01:09] God's
[2:01:11] work you're God's
[2:01:14] work he said if you are you will because
[2:01:17] you were he put that in there now just
[2:01:20] drink drink drink and start acting like
[2:01:23] you were saved confessing you're saved
[2:01:25] testifying you're saved get around
[2:01:26] people that are saved and watch what God
[2:01:28] will do young people careful who you say
[2:01:31] are your friends if they're not saved
[2:01:33] they're going to start to get you to
[2:01:34] kind of go down that path and you'll
[2:01:36] lose your confession don't lose your
[2:01:39] confession I thought I knew who my
[2:01:41] friends
[2:01:42] were and then when I didn't have the
[2:01:44] stuff that they wanted they all left
[2:01:46] when I got the real drug Christ Jesus
[2:01:50] they want nothing to do with me
[2:01:54] that's what I have for you this morning
[2:01:56] hopefully it encourag somebody if you're
[2:01:58] struggling I believe God speaking to us
[2:02:00] that we need to make sure there's a
[2:02:02] scripture over in second Peter we know
[2:02:03] it it's the sature of a perfect man add
[2:02:06] add add add to your faith virtue
[2:02:07] knowledge but then he says if these
[2:02:09] things be in you you'll never fall he
[2:02:13] says make your calling an election sure
[2:02:15] you were called you were elected but you
[2:02:17] have to make it sure maybe God's just
[2:02:19] telling you check up this morning you go
[2:02:21] will make it sure am I am I standing in
