[41:36] we have one of our own coming back home
[41:38] today that's the sister Minnie and
[41:41] brother Jordan Craven they have two
[41:45] little ones that they want to dedicate
[41:46] to the Lord
[41:48] and as they prepare to come
[41:51] Jordan is a
[41:53] he's a craven but he's a he's a stall
[41:55] too and the Stalls are very good friends
[41:57] of mine brother Albert Stoll
[42:00] and this is his nephew and he's the Lord
[42:03] has blessed them with these two children
[42:06] Rowan and Avery amen so let's sing that
[42:11] that that uh dedication song bring them
[42:15] in oh bring them in
[42:20] bring them in
[42:23] bring them in from the fields
[42:29] bring them in bring them in
[42:36] bring the little ones to dream amen
[42:42] let's all stand in Saint Mark chapter 10
[42:44] verse 13 and they brought young children
[42:47] to him that he should touch them
[42:50] and his disciples rebuke those that
[42:52] brought them but when Jesus saw it he
[42:55] was much displeased and said unto them
[42:58] suffer their little children who come
[43:00] unto me and forbid them not for of such
[43:04] is the kingdom of God
[43:06] verily I say unto you whosoever shall
[43:08] not receive the kingdom of God as a
[43:10] little child he shall not enter therein
[43:13] and he took them up in his arms put his
[43:17] hands upon them
[43:18] and bless them brother Branham says this
[43:21] in the message
[43:23] the way of a true prophet he says in the
[43:27] Old Testament
[43:28] they brought the children for fleshly
[43:30] circumcision the little males and the
[43:33] mother offered her offering for Pure
[43:35] purification two turtle doves or a lamb
[43:38] but in the New Testament the only place
[43:40] that I can find to commemoration of this
[43:43] great service it was a dedication
[43:47] they brought infants to Jesus and he
[43:49] picked them up in his arms and blessed
[43:52] them that was the parents that's what
[43:54] the parents did of his day and his life
[43:58] was an example of what we should do see
[44:01] these things he did for an example now
[44:04] we just take the little ones that bring
[44:07] them to us we just hold them up to God
[44:10] and ask God's blessings upon them and
[44:13] pray a prayer of dedication from the
[44:16] mother and father to God as they present
[44:19] their child and or dedicate them in the
[44:23] name of Jesus Christ until they're old
[44:26] enough to be baptized in the name of
[44:28] Jesus Christ and now he said whatever we
[44:31] do in word or deed do all in the name of
[44:35] the Lord Jesus Christ so that's what we
[44:38] wish to do amen so I met these little
[44:41] children at the wedding venue and this
[44:44] little one is this what's it that's
[44:46] Rowan
[44:47] yeah he's quite something else and
[44:50] he was crying and crying but no tears he
[44:54] was just complaining basically
[44:56] and then Sharon he finally I held him I
[44:59] got him in my arms and then he looked at
[45:01] me and then he really started crying
[45:03] then I gave him I gave him the share and
[45:06] he kept crying and she kept going kept
[45:08] going and all he wanted I guess he
[45:10] wanted the right rhythm
[45:12] and then he finally fell asleep and when
[45:14] he fell asleep sister Minnie and Jordan
[45:16] came up missing they were like where's
[45:18] their parents
[45:20] so they had a nice safe place for him to
[45:22] rest and so that was really nice and so
[45:24] we'll take this uh well maybe
[45:27] we'll do Avery first and this is little
[45:30] Avery and uh and we'll dedicate him to
[45:34] the Lord
[45:36] you can just hold her I'll just Lord
[45:38] Jesus
[45:39] I bring this young child Avery into your
[45:44] presence yes as you give this child to
[45:47] brother Jordan and sister Minnie and
[45:50] Lord we ask that you would receive her
[45:52] as they give her back to you
[45:55] in the dedication Lord we do it in the
[45:58] name of Jesus Christ that at the age of
[46:01] accountability she would serve you
[46:04] repent of her sins and be filled with
[46:07] the Holy Ghost if the time but Terry we
[46:10] do that Lord we believe that it is
[46:13] the prescription of the day for
[46:15] salvation Lord and we simply do it by
[46:18] faith you gave it to us we give it back

[47:57] that you know in those areas it's not a
[48:00] lot of work it's kind of out in the bush

[48:05] the young people they get a certain age
[48:06] and they go into the bigger cities for

[53:14] I want to tell you how many
[53:19] um
[53:20] I came over to be with brother Roger
[53:23] Collins
[53:24] when he dedicated his newly
[53:28] found a tabernacle
[53:31] I had met him 25 years ago in South
[53:34] Africa when he was doing his Outreach
[53:37] work
[53:39] he was with a brother by the name of
[53:41] Theo Erasmus Pastor erasma said gone to
[53:46] be with the Lord yes now
[53:49] he actually
[53:53] lost his life
[53:56] when they were together with brother
[53:58] Collins
[53:59] and another brother
[54:01] going to attend meeting in Durban and
[54:06] they were involved in the car crash and
[54:09] that's our brother left the sin
[54:11] so I met him then and I was just
[54:14] interpreting for him
[54:17] I had been an interpreter translator
[54:20] for voice of God Recordings into my
[54:23] language
[54:24] is a xhosa want to hear me when I speak
[54:27] xhosa
[54:29] ikama
[54:31] ikama that is a deer the dear the animal
[54:34] Akama
[54:39] I just want to hear all those of you to
[54:41] hear all those clicks meaning
[54:45] the lamp
[54:47] foreign
[55:01] then they they made me interpret for
[55:05] brother Roger then that's how I met him
[55:07] and if you come my brother has
[55:10] rightfully said that I come from the
[55:13] rural area of South Africa and those are
[55:18] remote areas quite remote as remote as
[55:22] you never seen a remote area we the
[55:25] people just still build mad houses no
[55:29] running water and and all those things
[55:31] and we didn't have electricity for years
[55:33] which has caught electricity a few years
[55:36] back and start is
[55:38] um yeah no street lights no anything if
[55:41] you go out there you'll see all the
[55:44] the heavenly bodies you'll see the moon
[55:47] you see the stars clearly in the night
[55:51] so Brothers uh
[55:55] when uh
[55:57] I became a voice of God
[56:00] translator and I got to meet brother
[56:03] Billy Paul Brenham and when he met me he
[56:07] said brother what language are you doing
[56:09] I told him I'm doing xhosa and he says
[56:12] Casa he says brother that's one of the
[56:15] languages that my daddy liked so much
[56:17] when he came to South Africa because of
[56:19] all the clicks the clicks and
[56:24] and then
[56:26] when I met Brother Joseph Brenham he
[56:29] said to me
[56:31] brother remember when you translate this
[56:33] message
[56:34] my father said
[56:36] you must not live in Iota
[56:38] you must translate that as well and
[56:40] thought what is an Iota he says to me do
[56:43] you know what it is I said I don't know
[56:44] he says and I order I'll give you an
[56:47] example it's like
[56:49] the word pneumonia he says that's a
[56:53] Greek word pneumonia when you pronounce
[56:56] it it's like you're saying it's like you
[56:59] start with an N
[57:00] only to find out that it starts with a P
[57:03] but you don't pronounce the P you can
[57:05] say pneumonia
[57:06] you know
[57:07] um yeah well I tried my best to be
[57:11] the best in translating and I enjoy
[57:15] translating for brother prenup you know
[57:17] when we get into the little studio and
[57:19] you preach there you you visualize your
[57:22] audience and you know you just put
[57:25] yourself next to brother pranam where he
[57:28] shouts you shouts where he cries you cry
[57:30] where he does everything I did and the
[57:34] Lord really blessed me and and I
[57:36] remember in one message where prophetam
[57:38] says
[57:39] the battle is Raging so I just got it
[57:43] from God and I said
[57:48] The Petal is Raging you could have said
[57:51] it in in many other ways but that just
[57:53] came and the people when they pray and
[57:57] our people that they pray even those
[58:00] that can listen to English and knows how
[58:04] to speak English they quote that is
[58:11] the lord gave it to me so
[58:14] I love the Lord well I'm giving the
[58:17] pastor has allowed me to give a few
[58:19] testimonies and
[58:21] while I was doing the translations
[58:24] brothers and sisters
[58:25] those days we would take a an English
[58:28] manuscript
[58:30] blowed up to be A4 size or so A5 rather
[58:35] and then
[58:37] we would take
[58:39] a tape you listen to brother Branham why
[58:43] are you looking at that and you would
[58:46] take what is written in English you
[58:47] write it in closer and I'd say while I'm
[58:51] busy writing that's something within
[58:53] tells me you wrote a wrong thing wrong
[58:56] wrong wrong and you know that voice that
[58:59] small soft voice
[59:01] would become not small anymore it would
[59:05] be just like if something would push me
[59:08] the other way wrong wrong wrong and then
[59:10] I scratch it I would be riding like this
[59:12] and I scratch it like that if you could
[59:15] see my nose you would see many of those
[59:17] and right correct thing the Lord was
[59:20] just leading me and if any of uh
[59:26] the pastors like pasta po who goes over
[59:31] there to us I'm such a neck and I take
[59:36] them I say you don't go to the cities
[59:38] only not to Cape Town Johannesburg Port
[59:40] Elizabeth and all those you must come
[59:43] out there because especially people from
[59:46] America we believe that that's where the
[59:48] message came and then now when we look
[59:52] up to you and the these people are
[59:55] coming from the source from where the
[59:57] Prophet was so we want you to go out
[59:59] there and let the people that didn't
[1:00:01] hear some of the testimonies here from
[1:00:05] directly from the host's mouth as you
[1:00:08] put you you you are that horse
[1:00:11] all of you
[1:00:13] so we want to hear it from the horse's
[1:00:15] mouth so that's what I was doing and I
[1:00:17] would
[1:00:18] if I meet any of those and I would go
[1:00:21] out of my way if I hear there's one in
[1:00:23] town and I would go to Durban walk one
[1:00:27] day I walked on foot and it was so hot
[1:00:30] in Durban to get some Believers that
[1:00:32] were in a hotel or on on the
[1:00:37] uh oh what do you call this thing on the
[1:00:41] beach front so I went there and I got
[1:00:45] them and I made sure that I will take
[1:00:47] them all the way out to where I come
[1:00:49] from and let the people here so I would
[1:00:52] go there and I would hold in my hand
[1:00:55] some of the books like uh a prophet
[1:00:59] visit South Africa and William Brennan
[1:01:02] moments and from God and all those all
[1:01:06] books and I'm watching their Ministries
[1:01:08] to see if I'll see the blessings that
[1:01:11] that accompanied brother Branham and
[1:01:15] some of the venues would be places where
[1:01:16] program had been like in Port Elizabeth
[1:01:20] the further Market Hall and the brothers
[1:01:23] would go there and I would look for
[1:01:27] even trips
[1:01:29] of blessings you know like healings and
[1:01:32] that type of a thing and I saw many in
[1:01:35] the ministry of brother Roger oh I just
[1:01:39] love the Lord and that brought us
[1:01:42] together
[1:01:44] um
[1:01:46] I like people so much I really love
[1:01:50] people
[1:01:51] and people love me
[1:01:53] in the message I had to I one time
[1:01:55] brother pranam praying you might be
[1:01:57] acquainted with that he says Lord
[1:02:01] let the people love me so that I can
[1:02:04] draw them to you
[1:02:07] how many knows that I won't give you the
[1:02:10] spoken word you're supposed to know
[1:02:15] and when I pray
[1:02:17] I don't repeat what problem is saying
[1:02:19] that because I Feel So Unworthy and I
[1:02:22] say Lord because the people love me so
[1:02:25] much
[1:02:26] I love them and may that Lord draw me
[1:02:30] near to you so I put it the other way
[1:02:34] around so it's been happening all the
[1:02:36] time now uh
[1:02:38] I don't
[1:02:41] my wife's grandmother
[1:02:46] is one of those old
[1:02:48] Assembly of God
[1:02:52] believers
[1:02:53] she grew up in the Assembly of God when
[1:02:56] she was a young lady and then she had
[1:02:59] seen Prada Branham in 1951
[1:03:02] that's my wife's father's mother
[1:03:06] so she had seen brother pranam but
[1:03:10] they didn't know anything about the
[1:03:12] message
[1:03:14] and then when I came in the message
[1:03:16] my wife went to visit Grandma and she
[1:03:19] had a spoken word book
[1:03:21] with brother premium's photo on the
[1:03:24] outside and when she saw that said
[1:03:26] that's exactly real and pranam because
[1:03:29] in that photo as young as he was back
[1:03:32] then and then he says exactly will and
[1:03:34] pranam the same man that spoke one day
[1:03:38] and
[1:03:40] a lady by the name of Eunice who had a
[1:03:43] big hump on her back
[1:03:45] the hump just vanished like that
[1:03:47] create my witnessed that and she says
[1:03:52] she had a what you know what in in her
[1:03:57] finger that was a long word each time
[1:04:00] she was busy cutting bread or something
[1:04:02] she was so careful that she wouldn't cut
[1:04:05] that what
[1:04:06] the day that she saw that Miracle of a
[1:04:10] hump on a person's back Vanishing like
[1:04:13] that
[1:04:14] the next morning
[1:04:15] she looked at the finger nothing no what
[1:04:19] whatsoever
[1:04:21] but you you know the Lord is so good
[1:04:24] she never seen the message the way we
[1:04:27] wanted her to see although my wife took
[1:04:30] some tapes for her to listen to and she
[1:04:32] was saying all is well all is well but
[1:04:34] she never called peptides until the Lord
[1:04:36] called her home
[1:04:37] and what I am so thankful with is that I
[1:04:41] first saw the light of the message then
[1:04:43] my wife came then her two brothers in
[1:04:48] fact it was her younger sister that saw
[1:04:49] it after her and then had to Brothers
[1:04:53] also came in while grandma just saw the
[1:04:56] prophet and she didn't come in but I
[1:05:00] believe
[1:05:01] she's part of the Bride of her own time
[1:05:06] so brothers and sisters
[1:05:08] um I I I I'm really glad
[1:05:12] um I I don't wanna
[1:05:14] take time on that seeing its awareness
[1:05:17] day night and people has to go to work
[1:05:20] uh just um
[1:05:23] whatever comes to my memory I will say I
[1:05:27] mean
[1:05:28] touching testimony things
[1:05:31] um
[1:05:33] yeah
[1:05:36] maybe I will
[1:05:38] go into those things as I speak I told
[1:05:41] the pastor that I'm not
[1:05:43] a preacher
[1:05:45] I'm
[1:05:48] I'm not a teacher
[1:05:50] and I'm not much of a Preacher I don't
[1:05:54] know what I am
[1:05:55] but out there
[1:05:57] the Lord uses me so much
[1:06:00] and get people in in fact I received
[1:06:03] testimonies while here that they
[1:06:06] baptized in one of our little
[1:06:10] branches seven people
[1:06:13] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:06:15] in another one they baptized one to me
[1:06:18] that means so much
[1:06:21] amen although I was telling Pastor that
[1:06:25] there's a death in our little church
[1:06:28] and brother it's not an elderly brother
[1:06:31] that much because he's in his late 60s
[1:06:36] he felt sick and they reported it to me
[1:06:39] on Friday that he went to be with the
[1:06:42] Lord I trust to go back and do his
[1:06:45] funeral he was a humble brother a
[1:06:47] brother that loves the Lord so much
[1:06:50] and please bear with me if you
[1:06:53] don't hear well what I'm saying I also
[1:06:57] don't hear you
[1:06:58] [Laughter]

[1:07:05] the Bible you'll catch here and there

[1:07:18] people out there you know I like it so
[1:07:20] much and really the Lord is Blessing us
[1:07:25] um

[1:08:15] Lord Jesus our Prophet taught us Lord
[1:08:18] that
[1:08:19] each and every man with two hands can
[1:08:22] push back the pages of the Bible but
[1:08:25] Lord he says
[1:08:27] it takes your Holy Spirit to reveal what
[1:08:31] is contained in this Pages Lord God we
[1:08:34] pray that now Lord as we read it may the
[1:08:37] Bible speak to us itself Lord that when
[1:08:40] we go out we say he did speak to us
[1:08:44] touch Our Lives Lord we pray in the name
[1:08:47] of the Lord Jesus Christ I don't have
[1:08:49] much to say

[1:08:54] to say to your children through my mouth
[1:08:56] please Lord I Avail myself to speak Lord
[1:09:00] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:02] amen
[1:09:04] I will read a few verses from verse 1.
[1:09:09] Revelations 21 verse 1 and I saw a new
[1:09:13] Heaven and a new Earth for defense
[1:09:16] Heaven and the first Earth were passed
[1:09:18] away and there was no mercy and I John
[1:09:22] saw the holy city New Jerusalem
[1:09:24] coming down from God out of Heaven
[1:09:27] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[1:09:31] husband I want to read on and I had a
[1:09:35] great voice out of Heaven saying behold
[1:09:37] the Tabernacle of God is with man
[1:09:40] and he will dwell with them and they
[1:09:43] shall be his people and God himself
[1:09:46] shall be with them
[1:09:48] and be their God and God shall wipe away
[1:09:53] all tears from their eyes and there
[1:09:56] shall be no more death neither sorrow
[1:09:59] nor crying neither shall there be any
[1:10:02] more pain for the former things are
[1:10:05] passed away
[1:10:06] and he that sat upon the throne said
[1:10:08] behold I make all things new and he said
[1:10:12] unto me right for these words are true
[1:10:15] and faithful and he said unto me it is
[1:10:18] done I am the alpha I'm Alpha and Omega
[1:10:21] the beginning and the end I will give
[1:10:24] unto him that is a thirst of the
[1:10:27] founding of the Water of Life freely
[1:10:31] he that overcometh
[1:10:33] shall inherit all things and I will be
[1:10:35] his God and he shall be my son
[1:10:38] but
[1:10:40] he fearful
[1:10:42] and unbelieving and abominable and
[1:10:45] murderers and Among Us and Sorcerers and
[1:10:48] idolators and all liars shall have their
[1:10:52] part in the lake with which planet with
[1:10:56] fire and brimstone which is the second
[1:11:00] death verse 9
[1:11:02] and they came unto me one of the Seven
[1:11:04] Angels which had the seven vials full of
[1:11:08] the seven last breaks and talked with me
[1:11:11] saying
[1:11:12] come hither
[1:11:14] I will show you thee the bride the
[1:11:18] Lamb's wife you may be seated I want to
[1:11:21] talk about the bride the Lamb's wife
[1:11:23] maybe while talking about the Lambs the
[1:11:26] Lambs the bride the Lamb's wife
[1:11:29] I won't talk deep as you would expect to
[1:11:34] talk deep about the bride but all I know
[1:11:36] is that I'm standing here talking to the
[1:11:39] bride
[1:11:40] and it's not an easy thing amen somebody
[1:11:44] said if you stand behind this
[1:11:47] holy desk and you speak to the people
[1:11:50] you must know that you're not speaking
[1:11:52] to the people you're speaking to Jesus
[1:11:54] Christ himself
[1:11:55] you're speaking to God so it has to be
[1:11:58] God in you that will speak to God in you
[1:12:01] Hallelujah so I want to talk about this
[1:12:05] this Sprite
[1:12:07] The Pride
[1:12:08] is made as you know of many members from
[1:12:12] across the globe from all over different
[1:12:15] nationalities
[1:12:17] different walks of life and the Lord has
[1:12:20] chosen his own and he has called them
[1:12:23] he's he chose and he as we know that we
[1:12:27] were chosen before the foundation of the
[1:12:29] world
[1:12:30] Hallelujah we were in him amen we were
[1:12:33] praising him amen as I spoke this
[1:12:37] morning in another church and I said
[1:12:39] when Michael fought with the dragon I
[1:12:42] was there and I know which side I was
[1:12:46] I was on the side of my girl and we
[1:12:49] fought them devils and we kicked them
[1:12:51] out of Heaven Hallelujah and in this
[1:12:54] life again the lord gave me that
[1:12:57] opportunity the other can be here and
[1:13:00] chase them the same way I did that
[1:13:03] before the foundation of the world we
[1:13:06] were together brothers and sisters
[1:13:08] fighting that enemy and now
[1:13:12] before
[1:13:14] we get anywhere I will make it simple
[1:13:17] I'm a simple person and I want to us to
[1:13:21] go
[1:13:22] to
[1:13:23] the book of
[1:13:29] Let It Be The Book of Peter
[1:13:33] um
[1:13:38] it's gonna be
[1:13:48] it's gonna be second Peter
[1:13:50] I'm going to a scripture that you know
[1:13:53] so much
[1:13:55] the first chapter
[1:13:57] of the book of Saint Peter
[1:14:01] verse 1 says Simon Peter a servant and
[1:14:04] an apostle of Jesus Christ
[1:14:06] is writing to them
[1:14:09] that have obtained like Precious faith
[1:14:14] with us
[1:14:16] through the righteousness of God and our
[1:14:18] Savior Jesus Christ so if he's writing
[1:14:21] to people with that type of faith
[1:14:24] he is writing to you
[1:14:26] he is writing to the Lamb's wife he is
[1:14:29] writing to the bride
[1:14:30] and brother sister you know all these
[1:14:33] things
[1:14:34] as our Prophet puts it I'll give you
[1:14:37] just two quotes maybe from the prophet
[1:14:40] but I'll be just talking but I won't
[1:14:42] talk wrong things you know brother
[1:14:46] our Prophet says the Bible
[1:14:49] is a love letter
[1:14:52] a love letter to the bride
[1:14:54] from him to the bride many people are
[1:14:57] carrying the Bible they pack the Bible
[1:14:58] to churches some of them they do Bible
[1:15:01] studies but they don't really get what
[1:15:04] is contained in the Bible because it's
[1:15:06] not written to them
[1:15:08] it's written to the bride it's a love
[1:15:11] letter between you and
[1:15:15] your groom
[1:15:16] amen now
[1:15:19] let's read and I want to get to a place
[1:15:22] that we you will think perhaps it's
[1:15:24] taking us back backwards
[1:15:27] but
[1:15:30] um verse 4 whereby are given unto us
[1:15:34] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:15:37] that by this you might be partakers of
[1:15:40] the divine nature
[1:15:42] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:15:46] the world talking to us we came out of
[1:15:48] this corruption in the world we came to
[1:15:50] the word forgive me because I'll mention
[1:15:53] a few things of the corruption that is
[1:15:55] taking place out there
[1:15:56] people are so corrupt in the world that
[1:15:59] they are so after money
[1:16:03] everything is just money money money
[1:16:04] money to an extent that these people
[1:16:08] will go to even
[1:16:12] reading body parts from people
[1:16:15] yes they know a kitten costs so much
[1:16:18] thirty thousand dollars what is that
[1:16:23] they go up and down we meet at the
[1:16:25] airports they get caught some are
[1:16:28] selling drugs you know the the abuse of
[1:16:31] drugs I'm not talking about in South
[1:16:33] Africa we we call a drugstore a chemist
[1:16:38] we don't say drugs though when you talk
[1:16:40] about drugs the already we're thinking
[1:16:43] about the abuse of drugs but people will
[1:16:46] do all those kind of things they are so
[1:16:48] corrupt they will sell everything in
[1:16:51] order to get money and get rich and
[1:16:53] richer and they do the the the world is
[1:16:57] so corrupt but the Lord brings us in the
[1:17:00] world is so corrupt
[1:17:01] they then
[1:17:03] little
[1:17:05] male children they make them female
[1:17:09] and the female they make them men
[1:17:12] and now they are tired of that they make
[1:17:15] a gender that you you wouldn't even tell
[1:17:18] you can't say he or she
[1:17:20] he's just a thing I'm sorry I said it is
[1:17:24] a thing you don't know what to say
[1:17:25] that's what they are doing it's so
[1:17:27] corrupt but the Lord through his grace
[1:17:29] he brought us in he took us out of that
[1:17:33] corruption he brought us not into the
[1:17:35] church but he brought us all the way to
[1:17:38] the Living Word father pranam says if I
[1:17:42] take you out of your church where will I
[1:17:44] take you to will I take you to the
[1:17:46] pranam Tabernacle he says no where am I
[1:17:49] taking you to
[1:17:50] am I bringing attacking you to listen to
[1:17:53] me he says no
[1:17:54] I'm taking you and I'm pointing you to
[1:17:56] Christ
[1:17:57] that's why we belong brothers and
[1:17:59] sisters but bit by bit I'm gonna talk
[1:18:02] about this Pride
[1:18:04] now this bride that's been called
[1:18:07] to take all the word of God
[1:18:10] this bride my dear brother
[1:18:15] the scripture says
[1:18:19] Hallelujah
[1:18:22] first of all we are given unto us and
[1:18:24] kale carry on divide this Diva nature
[1:18:27] and verse 5 and beside this giving or
[1:18:31] beside this giving all diligence
[1:18:35] add to your faith now I'm gonna talk
[1:18:37] about this diligence I I see this is a
[1:18:41] witness Wednesday night and I see
[1:18:44] there's many that are here I don't know
[1:18:46] how many you are I want to give you a
[1:18:49] hand for that you know people don't come
[1:18:51] to church anymore
[1:18:53] they lack the divisions
[1:18:55] and since covet some people had never
[1:18:58] put their foot in church
[1:19:00] and I want to touch another thing
[1:19:03] and because of the screen what do you
[1:19:06] call it
[1:19:07] streaming
[1:19:10] people say that um for no good reason
[1:19:14] because they're gonna stream
[1:19:17] but the Bible never said stream
[1:19:20] Hallelujah
[1:19:22] the Bible encouraged us to get together
[1:19:25] forsake not you're gathering together
[1:19:28] you must be diligent
[1:19:31] you must be diligent to pray
[1:19:34] to read the word of God
[1:19:37] Hallelujah to listen to that voice
[1:19:43] and my brother
[1:19:46] I'm not taking you back
[1:19:48] but Paul was saying oh Peter rather here
[1:19:51] was saying to his groom that you are so
[1:19:53] diligent
[1:19:55] you come to church
[1:19:58] you know you pray
[1:20:01] you help each other
[1:20:03] you pray for another
[1:20:05] but he was saying you you are so
[1:20:07] diligent but today my brother my sister
[1:20:10] people are so lazy we are so lazy
[1:20:15] God help me
[1:20:19] we don't have that diligence but now
[1:20:21] when when he said that I am taking you
[1:20:24] back to the ABCs he said
[1:20:28] having all diligence
[1:20:36] I don't wanna rush but I won't be long
[1:20:41] he says having all diligence
[1:20:48] you give all that diligence and he says
[1:20:51] add to your faith
[1:20:54] now that's why I'm saying I'm taking you
[1:20:57] back to the apcs where brother Branham
[1:21:01] talks about the stage of a perfect man
[1:21:05] he says Where It Starts it starts there
[1:21:08] in faith
[1:21:10] brother sisters
[1:21:12] for the scripture says it's not possible
[1:21:15] to please God without faith right
[1:21:20] how many is Faith tonight
[1:21:22] well how much Faith do you have
[1:21:25] things like
[1:21:27] can you tell me
[1:21:30] but the Lord said
[1:21:32] if you would have have faith as big as
[1:21:36] the mustard seed
[1:21:38] that's all that God requires
[1:21:41] as little as that we are told that the
[1:21:44] mustard seed is the smallest of all the
[1:21:46] seeds
[1:21:47] but when you plant it it makes a th
[1:21:50] gigantic tree as big as this building
[1:21:54] that little mustard seed
[1:21:57] the Lord never demanded that we have too
[1:22:00] much faith
[1:22:01] what are you gonna do with too much
[1:22:02] faith if you don't have that little one
[1:22:05] that is the foundation you must have
[1:22:07] that faith
[1:22:09] I know
[1:22:11] Brothers we doubt ourselves many times
[1:22:15] whether we do have enough Faith or not
[1:22:18] but the scripture says that's the
[1:22:20] foundation that's the first thing that
[1:22:23] you must have you must have that Faith
[1:22:24] now brother sister brother Branham when
[1:22:27] he talks about the stage of a perfect
[1:22:29] man he talks about the stage of a
[1:22:32] perfect man in the whole church and he
[1:22:35] takes it down to be an individual thing
[1:22:39] amen you remember that one
[1:22:42] I'm sorry I'm not going to read a quote
[1:22:43] for it
[1:22:45] we sometimes
[1:22:47] becomes all spoiled
[1:22:50] that there will be a code for everything
[1:22:55] I
[1:22:57] don't know maybe
[1:22:59] like
[1:23:00] attacking the people but now
[1:23:07] that faith
[1:23:11] brother William says
[1:23:13] the devil Satan
[1:23:17] when he sees
[1:23:19] the weakest
[1:23:21] of a believer
[1:23:23] on his or her and he's praying
[1:23:25] you know what he says
[1:23:27] the devil trembles
[1:23:30] how many say I'm weak tonight
[1:23:32] I was wrong
[1:23:34] people think they are you using some
[1:23:36] many times you think you are so weak you
[1:23:39] can't defeat this the smallest of of an
[1:23:42] enemy attack
[1:23:43] but brother sister my Prophet says if
[1:23:47] the enemy the ark enemy the devil
[1:23:50] Lucifer himself
[1:23:52] sees you on your knees praying
[1:23:55] he doesn't say when you shout he doesn't
[1:23:58] say when you jump he just says when you
[1:24:01] are on your knees praying the devil
[1:24:04] trembles because the child of God has
[1:24:06] got that little faith
[1:24:08] that little faith in you brother sister
[1:24:12] I have seen people that won't even pray
[1:24:15] for a sick person
[1:24:17] because they doubt
[1:24:20] um
[1:24:21] one time in joburg a brother
[1:24:25] was so bold
[1:24:27] he went and prayed for a sick baby
[1:24:30] says I believe my God's Gonna heal this
[1:24:32] baby
[1:24:33] I'm gonna pray for this baby and he
[1:24:35] prayed and the baby died
[1:24:38] and
[1:24:40] Believers were saying yeah
[1:24:43] what did he think he is he was trying to
[1:24:46] make himself a prophet the brother says
[1:24:49] Brothers I didn't say Thursday of the
[1:24:52] Lord
[1:24:53] he says the prophet says if I pray
[1:24:58] for more than I don't know what number
[1:25:01] he said but many people and he says if I
[1:25:04] pray for those villains they all die I
[1:25:07] will still continue praying for them
[1:25:10] because we lack that faith
[1:25:15] you know
[1:25:16] we many times we let down down our
[1:25:19] savior so much we won't stand for the
[1:25:22] little thing we we know brother pranam
[1:25:24] says in in the
[1:25:26] stage of a perfect man says that
[1:25:28] Foundation you must save that Foundation
[1:25:29] must have faith without faith you cannot
[1:25:32] please God those that come to him has to
[1:25:36] believe that he is and he's a rewarder
[1:25:39] of those that seek him you know what we
[1:25:42] we do have do you have a little flesh I
[1:25:44] do have
[1:25:46] I do have the little faith but then
[1:25:49] brother Peter says don't stop there
[1:25:54] add to that faith
[1:25:58] you you you you you you you
[1:26:00] bear with me
[1:26:02] I'm not gonna be deep but I'm just gonna
[1:26:05] say this
[1:26:07] he says to the faith
[1:26:09] you add you know you can almost recite
[1:26:12] it
[1:26:14] is it there thank you very much
[1:26:17] to the faith you add now virtue
[1:26:23] and the prophet says what is virtue
[1:26:25] some people will think if you don't
[1:26:27] speak to anybody in the street you hold
[1:26:29] your dignity you know the ways that they
[1:26:32] think they have got virtue
[1:26:34] because they are not you can't you can't
[1:26:38] talk to them anyhow they're not light
[1:26:40] you must have a way of approach when you
[1:26:42] talk they think they have virtue thank
[1:26:45] you you're there for so much respect you
[1:26:48] know that you must give to them I don't
[1:26:50] know them giving to you
[1:26:52] but brother William says that's not
[1:26:55] virtue
[1:26:56] we all know
[1:26:58] but I want to go into it
[1:27:00] he was he says virtue you know what
[1:27:03] virtue is
[1:27:04] he says virtue is power
[1:27:08] virtue is strength
[1:27:10] and he says the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:13] when the little believing sister touched
[1:27:16] His Garment
[1:27:18] vesuant out of him
[1:27:21] [Music]
[1:27:23] the Revival was so big or so on there
[1:27:27] were so many people they were bumping
[1:27:29] into each other and he stopped the
[1:27:31] Revival and said
[1:27:34] wait a minute who touched me
[1:27:39] I would like to touch him that way you
[1:27:41] know
[1:27:42] he stopped everything he said who
[1:27:44] touched me
[1:27:45] and the disciples said Lord how can you
[1:27:48] say that
[1:27:49] many people are here
[1:27:52] and we're rubbing Soldiers with
[1:27:55] Pharisees and everyone many many people
[1:27:57] are here now
[1:27:59] Great and Small are yeah and now you say
[1:28:02] who touched he says I know
[1:28:05] the strength
[1:28:07] the power that went out of me you know
[1:28:09] when you only have faith and you don't
[1:28:12] have that strength you know what they do
[1:28:17] sometimes we young people
[1:28:19] when we go to church you hide your Bible
[1:28:22] so that they cannot tell that you are a
[1:28:25] Christian
[1:28:26] why do you do that
[1:28:27] I mean because you have not added virtue
[1:28:31] you don't want to see you because you
[1:28:33] know nowadays it's easy you know you can
[1:28:36] just carry your iPhone it's not an
[1:28:38] iPhone see it's mine is not an iPhone
[1:28:40] you carry your iPhone your Bible is
[1:28:42] there nobody knows that you are a
[1:28:44] Christian you hide it because you are
[1:28:46] lacking that virtue
[1:28:48] you you don't have that strength to
[1:28:50] stand for the word you cannot stand for
[1:28:52] Jesus you cannot stand for the message
[1:28:54] and the message today is attacked so
[1:28:57] much from right left and Center there
[1:29:01] needs to be people that will stand for
[1:29:02] this word hallelujah the brother that
[1:29:06] the Lord used to bring the message to me
[1:29:08] said brother we shouldn't be shy we
[1:29:11] shouldn't be ashamed of telling the
[1:29:13] people he said you think the people at
[1:29:15] the time of Moses we are ashamed to tell
[1:29:18] the people that Moses is their prophet
[1:29:20] they wouldn't say Moses it's my Prophet
[1:29:23] Moses is our prophet
[1:29:25] and when you add
[1:29:28] that virtue
[1:29:30] you tell everyone
[1:29:32] that God has sent us a prophet in this
[1:29:34] age
[1:29:36] you tell everyone
[1:29:37] Hallelujah that I followed a voice that
[1:29:41] called me out a voice that is a voice
[1:29:44] to this age
[1:29:46] you you you you now you you you can tell
[1:29:48] I I remember in the revivals back home
[1:29:51] some people would come to an evening
[1:29:53] service like this and then
[1:29:56] the newcomers
[1:29:58] the neighbors some people might not come
[1:30:01] to the prayer meeting but they are not
[1:30:03] asleep I tell you
[1:30:07] some complain that they are so tired
[1:30:09] from work and then when you get home
[1:30:12] you'll find them still awake
[1:30:15] they're not sleeping
[1:30:17] you my elder brother used to say you
[1:30:20] would come back from the fields you'd be
[1:30:21] working the whole day and he says by the
[1:30:24] time you is about to go to church he
[1:30:26] says my heart in my heart something says
[1:30:29] you are too tired
[1:30:31] he says it's my heart talking to you too
[1:30:33] tired to go to the service he says
[1:30:36] stand up and say you are telling lies
[1:30:40] heart
[1:30:40] I'm not gonna use you when I walk to
[1:30:42] church I'll use the feet and my feet are
[1:30:45] not complaining so it stands up when he
[1:30:48] goes to church
[1:30:49] one old sister
[1:30:52] that went to be with the Lord now
[1:30:55] says in one service she was almost 80.
[1:30:59] but she was so strong she would go to
[1:31:02] church and she says this one day
[1:31:04] when she got to churches it was like she
[1:31:08] had the pain on the head and neck such a
[1:31:12] terrible pain is as if the neck was
[1:31:14] going to be cutting through
[1:31:16] and she says oh no
[1:31:18] will I not serve the Lord because of
[1:31:20] that pain here he said if anything
[1:31:23] happened if it's a
[1:31:27] it's a end of my my life
[1:31:30] I said I said to this pain I said if you
[1:31:33] kill me kill me now
[1:31:35] but I'm going to serve the Lord anyway
[1:31:36] I'm going to the service now brother
[1:31:39] sister now this this
[1:31:44] this strength or this uh Power this that
[1:31:50] we must add you know if people would
[1:31:54] come to church in the Revival and to the
[1:31:56] neighbors would say I had not you were
[1:31:58] there last night
[1:31:59] you went to that group
[1:32:02] so how can you go to such a thing and
[1:32:04] they call it names they they can only go
[1:32:07] you know you know what a person should
[1:32:09] do
[1:32:11] if they say those things to you I don't
[1:32:14] know when you used to tell them out
[1:32:15] there maybe not you if they say no no
[1:32:18] you say to them oh well maybe I won't go
[1:32:20] again
[1:32:23] you can't preach to them because you
[1:32:25] don't have you have not added yet you
[1:32:27] still have that little faith and you are
[1:32:29] adding virtue you say and maybe I won't
[1:32:31] go you go again
[1:32:33] the next day they come ah we hear you've
[1:32:36] been there again how can you go and
[1:32:39] there's that devil let me call it a
[1:32:41] devil that uh
[1:32:44] covet
[1:32:46] that thing
[1:32:49] that took so many people
[1:32:53] from their loved ones
[1:32:55] that thing that kept people away from
[1:32:58] church
[1:32:59] until they do not go to church even now
[1:33:03] that thing that took love for one
[1:33:07] another amongst us
[1:33:09] that even if you go to the doctor the
[1:33:11] doctor don't want to come close to you
[1:33:14] that thing that cause that not to hug
[1:33:17] our brothers
[1:33:18] sisters not to hug the other sisters
[1:33:20] that think that devil
[1:33:23] brother sister
[1:33:25] we have to overcome that thing
[1:33:28] we have to come strong against it
[1:33:31] we have to show the enemy my brother my
[1:33:35] sister if you add now he says add virtue
[1:33:44] I remember
[1:33:46] an old brother in my church
[1:33:49] he was a Pentecostal pastor
[1:33:52] and he came into
[1:33:54] the message I baptize him
[1:33:57] and then now he kept telling me that
[1:33:59] when I die
[1:34:01] you're gonna preach my funeral
[1:34:04] my funeral service and I didn't believe
[1:34:06] him because he had so many friends
[1:34:08] pentecostalia Pentecost all day you
[1:34:11] guess what he died at the beginning of
[1:34:14] covet
[1:34:16] he didn't have no covet
[1:34:18] but he happened to die at that time
[1:34:20] he had cancer
[1:34:23] so now I must go and do the funeral
[1:34:25] and our funerals there out in the rural
[1:34:28] areas a big thing especially if they
[1:34:30] know the person everybody comes and we
[1:34:33] get a Pulpit to preach to them you
[1:34:36] preach along and a long message then it
[1:34:40] happened then I had to go and bear with
[1:34:42] his brother ahead and go and do that as
[1:34:43] police there's everyone there's people
[1:34:47] you know think that I'm gonna contract a
[1:34:50] what this thing covet if I speak if this
[1:34:53] one coughs next to me I'll conduct if
[1:34:55] people are in such fear fear fear
[1:34:57] everywhere fear and while I was busy
[1:35:00] preaching there here comes the police
[1:35:02] and they come there to me and tell me
[1:35:04] you must not make it long
[1:35:06] they say otherwise we lock you up must
[1:35:09] not make it look brother so many people
[1:35:12] that gather there and while I was
[1:35:16] preaching I just said well getting it
[1:35:18] from wherever I just said there's not a
[1:35:21] single person
[1:35:22] after this funeral
[1:35:24] that's gonna be with coffee
[1:35:29] where they were from all the different
[1:35:31] places and there were so many of them I
[1:35:34] tell you brother there was not a single
[1:35:36] complaint
[1:35:37] about covet
[1:35:39] I had to stand up for it you know where
[1:35:42] when you add that that uh virtue you
[1:35:47] stand up for the right thing
[1:35:49] Hallelujah
[1:35:50] I know I know your message Believers but
[1:35:53] there's
[1:35:54] splits in our little churches
[1:35:57] I'm sorry but Brethren will rise against
[1:36:01] the pastor they rise against a good
[1:36:05] thing that's being done in the church
[1:36:07] and I saw the choir singing so
[1:36:09] beautifully here praising God
[1:36:12] and I'm just and when I see you you
[1:36:15] stand and praise God I'm really touched
[1:36:19] you know you you find people I'm sorry
[1:36:21] I'm gonna say it you find people that
[1:36:23] won't praise God they will just keep
[1:36:25] their dignity and say I'm white
[1:36:30] I'm what
[1:36:32] I'm white
[1:36:33] I cannot be just like them people
[1:36:42] maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe
[1:36:44] I think brother random was white wasn't
[1:36:47] he
[1:36:49] unless you doubt him like the other
[1:36:51] people do
[1:36:52] you know when he's at that day when you
[1:36:55] first went to the Pentecostal meeting he
[1:36:58] said they called that old man to go and
[1:37:00] preach there he said I felt sorry for
[1:37:03] this old man
[1:37:04] how is he going to do why don't they
[1:37:06] call the young Brothers there to go and
[1:37:08] preach brother you know how he says it
[1:37:11] he says brother when
[1:37:13] he talked about job
[1:37:15] and he took it like that right where
[1:37:18] were you
[1:37:21] and he says that man preached
[1:37:23] he says he jumped and he carried on he
[1:37:26] said I don't man I'm young and I can't
[1:37:30] jump like that
[1:37:31] but if you think that's in that old man
[1:37:34] can get all of me I don't know what uh
[1:37:36] why why what I will do and he was
[1:37:39] jumping
[1:37:40] and he was praising God and he was
[1:37:42] carrying on I don't mean to praise no
[1:37:45] one
[1:37:47] so much
[1:37:48] you know when he you anyway as always he
[1:37:52] is if he talks she shakes his hand he
[1:37:55] carries on he he goes on he says when I
[1:37:58] sing that song Standing on the Promises
[1:38:00] I don't want to be sitting in the
[1:38:02] premises
[1:38:03] and you get this one and when I look at
[1:38:06] him I say this boy
[1:38:09] resembles he's dead so much
[1:38:14] now you add
[1:38:17] you you you you add now virtue
[1:38:20] you stand for the message
[1:38:23] you stand for the word of God
[1:38:25] you stand for the cause of Christ
[1:38:28] you stand for the right thing
[1:38:30] you tell it to everyone
[1:38:33] because now while you are hiding your
[1:38:35] Bible you are not strong yet you had not
[1:38:38] at it but now you don't hide your Bible
[1:38:40] you you want everybody to see I know I
[1:38:43] know no no you want to agree but some of
[1:38:45] us in their little Corners at work at

[1:39:20] around you get healed
[1:39:23] without you praying for them without you
[1:39:26] laying hands you are such a blessing
[1:39:28] that virtue just give gives itself out
[1:39:31] to the people yes sir problem says if
[1:39:34] you are a flower you are a rose you
[1:39:37] would let that bee come to you and that
[1:39:39] be is not looking for anything he's
[1:39:41] looking for that virtue and you will
[1:39:43] take the fish and go and make some honey
[1:39:48] oh brother sister
[1:39:50] we should have so much of that when we
[1:39:52] should add

[1:40:03] virtues that I'm gonna take that
[1:40:05] brother sister
[1:40:07] we think we do have them
[1:40:09] but sometimes we don't even know what
[1:40:11] we're talking about
[1:40:19] let's mingle with quotes
[1:40:21] let me get a coach
[1:40:25] three kinds of believers
[1:40:30] I don't know if the brother might help

[1:40:52] no I'm just pulling your leg I know you
[1:40:56] like you like you laugh all the words
[1:40:58] but the thing is when sometimes you
[1:41:01] you bring it even to
[1:41:04] to our
[1:41:06] believers
[1:41:09] that there could be three kinds of three
[1:41:13] kinds of Believers but brother have you
[1:41:15] got it up for me
[1:41:18] no
[1:41:20] three kinds of Believers 63 11 24 e
[1:41:25] and uh I was gonna I was gonna read up
[1:41:27] there if it was
[1:41:30] paragraph number is uh number fourteen

[1:41:50] or have I written it wrong
[1:41:56] yes yes okay oh yeah although now
[1:42:01] where brother Graham says
[1:42:04] now he says
[1:42:08] you cannot totally annihilate and
[1:42:11] anything
[1:42:12] he starts by saying that I'm trying to
[1:42:15] get it here while they they're trying to
[1:42:17] put it up
[1:42:19] um
[1:42:22] why I I want to come to that one
[1:42:33] okay
[1:42:37] um but I will I will get to what I'm
[1:42:40] saying I don't know waste time in that
[1:42:43] um
[1:42:53] sorry sorry Brothers assistance
[1:43:00] now
[1:43:03] oh
[1:43:06] you can't find it brother
[1:43:09] um
[1:43:13] you get it
[1:43:15] yes thank you brother I wrote it wrongly
[1:43:18] now President says
[1:43:20] I was speaking to a couple this
[1:43:22] afternoon
[1:43:23] about you cannot totally and yield how
[1:43:27] do you pronounce it annihilate anything
[1:43:31] human beings cannot annihilate
[1:43:34] they can tear down but not annihilate
[1:43:38] and somebody said well what about
[1:43:42] taking it and burning a piece of paper
[1:43:45] does that alleviate it
[1:43:48] he says no sir I'm coming to where now I
[1:43:51] like it so much it's it only breaks the
[1:43:54] chemicals apart the heat of the fire it
[1:43:58] goes right back to gases what it was in
[1:44:01] the beginning you cannot annihilate
[1:44:04] and now
[1:44:06] I read I don't know how many saw it I
[1:44:08] don't know how true it is in the news
[1:44:10] that Israel
[1:44:12] take a note now just print
[1:44:16] foodstuffs
[1:44:17] how many saw it
[1:44:19] you did Brother
[1:44:22] just get some
[1:44:27] I'm not so much of a scientist I'm not
[1:44:30] into science but they get these little
[1:44:34] samples from animals
[1:44:36] and then take and print fish for you
[1:44:41] and somebody said I cannot eat that type
[1:44:44] of fish
[1:44:45] how do you know if you you have not been
[1:44:48] eating it all along
[1:44:56] is saying here
[1:44:58] he says you cannot destroy completely
[1:45:01] anything
[1:45:02] you cannot make it come to not it will
[1:45:06] always go back to where it come from
[1:45:09] so the scientists have got it
[1:45:12] and we still lack faith
[1:45:15] but they have so much faith that they
[1:45:17] will pray the fish for you they will
[1:45:20] print meat for you they will print
[1:45:23] you don't know how they do it they do it
[1:45:26] because they can know you cannot destroy
[1:45:27] completely anything
[1:45:29] it goes back to the gases where it comes
[1:45:32] from and it will come back but that's
[1:45:34] not what I'm preaching
[1:45:36] what I'm preaching here as you you can
[1:45:40] go up a little bit my brother
[1:45:42] says
[1:45:48] thank you God then if there is a
[1:45:51] resurrection to every thing back again
[1:45:55] and no annihilation
[1:45:57] there is a resurrection of the just
[1:46:01] you know my brother my sister
[1:46:03] that Resurrection does not start when
[1:46:07] you die
[1:46:08] the resurrection is in a Believer now
[1:46:11] [Music]
[1:46:15] does not come when he appears the
[1:46:19] Rapture is in you now
[1:46:22] there's nobody that is going to come to
[1:46:24] you my daughter was speaking to me while
[1:46:27] yeah when I was telling him in in Tucson
[1:46:29] Arizona you are behind with nine hours
[1:46:33] with us
[1:46:34] and she says Oh Daddy does it mean that
[1:46:37] we're gonna get the Rapture first
[1:46:40] we're gonna be the one in South Africa
[1:46:42] because
[1:46:43] it will be morning with us before it's
[1:46:46] morning with you but she was just
[1:46:49] throwing that we don't really believe
[1:46:50] that
[1:46:59] the morning
[1:47:00] but then that Resurrection
[1:47:03] uh
[1:47:06] where am I now
[1:47:10] thank you brother of the just yeah he
[1:47:12] says and we are we've got to come back
[1:47:15] that's all that there is there is no way
[1:47:18] of at all of doing no matter if you bend
[1:47:22] up if you're drowned wherever whatever
[1:47:26] takes place they cannot annihilate just
[1:47:29] remember that every part of you maybe
[1:47:32] I'll stop there every part of you was
[1:47:34] here
[1:47:35] when God spoke the word into existence
[1:47:38] he put your body here
[1:47:41] he put it right there and there's
[1:47:43] nothing can take it away except God
[1:47:47] you know brother sister I believe that
[1:47:49] so much
[1:47:51] I was walking down a Dusty Street of
[1:47:54] Soweto in Johannesburg
[1:47:56] so despondent so had broken many things
[1:48:00] were going wrong in my life that's when
[1:48:03] I saw the message and while walking
[1:48:05] there you know I tell you tonight the
[1:48:09] Lord spoke to me from within
[1:48:12] he says to me why do you worry
[1:48:14] about all these things that are
[1:48:16] happening in your life
[1:48:18] he says don't you know that your life
[1:48:22] no no not my life he says don't you know
[1:48:25] that the core of your life is in my hand
[1:48:29] I didn't even know what the word call
[1:48:30] means call c-o-r-e
[1:48:33] because when he spoke to me in English
[1:48:36] he was speaking from within and I could
[1:48:40] see the spelling of the word
[1:48:42] well don't know how that is done but it
[1:48:45] happens
[1:48:47] so I didn't know what it means he says
[1:48:49] the core of your life is in my hand he
[1:48:51] went on to say in fact that core of your
[1:48:54] life is me
[1:48:57] that's what he told me I don't know
[1:48:58] whether it's all right to tell you but
[1:49:01] when I got home
[1:49:02] I went in a consulted the dictionary
[1:49:04] that was long before Google
[1:49:07] so I went and consulted the dictionary
[1:49:09] and the dictionary was telling me that
[1:49:10] the word core means the center of
[1:49:14] something the inner part and it went on
[1:49:17] to say while the dictionary is telling
[1:49:19] me that and the Lord reveals to me now
[1:49:21] he shows me a grain of corn
[1:49:25] in that grain of corn maze
[1:49:28] there is that little thing that is in
[1:49:31] the middle of the seed and that's where
[1:49:34] if that little thing we call it in xhosa
[1:49:37] is Bindi
[1:49:40] will mean something like the liver but
[1:49:44] we don't mean liver in that way we mean
[1:49:47] that it's the center of that thing is
[1:49:48] this being the salando
[1:49:50] so he revealed to me that when that
[1:49:53] little things go out of that that grain
[1:49:56] you can plant it you can water it you
[1:49:59] can do what you like it will never grow
[1:50:02] because that core
[1:50:04] is not there
[1:50:06] he said it to me aren't you glad my
[1:50:08] brother my sister
[1:50:11] of your life is him
[1:50:15] the core of your life is in his hand
[1:50:18] you are part of him
[1:50:22] and brother many times he says
[1:50:25] you cannot die
[1:50:27] because God cannot die
[1:50:32] so
[1:50:33] I I'm I'm with those virtues thank you
[1:50:37] brother
[1:50:38] thank you
[1:50:40] now
[1:50:41] once you have added now I said I had
[1:50:45] only two that is left I'm gonna leave it
[1:50:48] there he said now to
[1:50:52] virtue
[1:50:53] at
[1:50:55] temperance
[1:50:56] is that so
[1:50:58] sorry no less sorry knowledge I'm left
[1:51:01] with knowledge and Temperance and
[1:51:03] knowledge you know that knowledge it's
[1:51:05] not the knowledge of all the quotes by
[1:51:08] head
[1:51:09] it's not the knowledge of what time the
[1:51:13] church starts and what time it goes
[1:51:15] because if the pastor preaches long
[1:51:17] you'll be looking at your ass because
[1:51:19] you know it so much you know all the
[1:51:22] church order and that type of thing and
[1:51:24] prophetam says we like to say church or
[1:51:27] the church order and he says what about
[1:51:29] Jesus is just order
[1:51:31] spit on the ground answer me as it only
[1:51:34] man you know we would say you'll catch
[1:51:36] coffee don't do that
[1:51:39] that's the order that we know
[1:51:43] but problem says Jesus had his his own
[1:51:46] church order you add knowledge that's
[1:51:50] when now I heard that there was a man's
[1:51:53] breakfast here and I missed all those
[1:51:55] blessings brother Collins was telling me
[1:51:58] how so much blessings and then when
[1:52:02] those Brothers ditched the word when
[1:52:05] they talk you you you you you you add
[1:52:08] knowledge you add knowledge you add
[1:52:09] knowledge Hallelujah and that knowledge
[1:52:12] will help you Hallelujah you know you
[1:52:15] add knowledge my dear sister brother
[1:52:17] pranam says we we have in fact the
[1:52:20] pastor I loved when you gave me this
[1:52:22] because I had a cold that I wanted to
[1:52:25] read where brother Branham says we we
[1:52:27] are all given gifts there's nine
[1:52:30] spiritual gifts that goes to all the
[1:52:32] church men and women
[1:52:34] boys and girls
[1:52:36] everyone has something that you can
[1:52:38] worship god with you have something that
[1:52:42] you can do how many of the sisters will
[1:52:44] bear witness with me that brother pranam
[1:52:46] says you can't preach but he says you
[1:52:49] can witness to the woman next door when
[1:52:51] you hang your washing
[1:52:53] he says you can even witness to the man
[1:52:56] that brings to you milk comes to deliver
[1:52:59] milk at your place
[1:53:03] you can do that
[1:53:04] and prophetam says all those nine
[1:53:06] spiritual gifts are for everyone amen
[1:53:10] everyone did you know that now
[1:53:14] some people
[1:53:16] would love to be like you
[1:53:18] they might say they don't like this
[1:53:20] message and they don't like your church
[1:53:22] they don't like your long dresses
[1:53:24] sisters they don't like you wearing long
[1:53:26] hair they might talk of all that but in
[1:53:30] a corner they there's many things that
[1:53:32] they see in you they say I wish away I
[1:53:35] wish I had what he had I wish I wish I
[1:53:38] wish I wish and do you know what problem
[1:53:40] says there is one to believe so much but
[1:53:44] they can't believe they've got nothing
[1:53:46] to believe with
[1:53:49] did you come across that one
[1:53:54] so to believe in myself something
[1:53:57] they've got nothing but praise God that
[1:53:59] you have that little thing that little
[1:54:02] faith that little something that you
[1:54:04] believe with and then you add now when
[1:54:07] you add knowledge they come can come
[1:54:10] tell you this and this I know let me put
[1:54:14] this in that there's so much attack
[1:54:19] of the message today
[1:54:23] you just switch on you you go into the
[1:54:25] internet you type the name William
[1:54:27] Branham first thing you you get is all
[1:54:30] the people that are texting me false
[1:54:32] prophet false this and this and
[1:54:36] again there are those that were with us
[1:54:41] they they are taking the message so much
[1:54:44] but your knowledge of the word will
[1:54:47] protect you
[1:54:49] your knowledge of the word you want just
[1:54:51] go with them
[1:54:53] you know brother sister many of them
[1:54:57] were raised in the message
[1:54:59] many of them were preaching the message
[1:55:02] many of them and they turn right so
[1:55:06] against the message and they attack the
[1:55:08] message they attack the message but if
[1:55:10] you feed from the word of God you will
[1:55:13] be able you have that knowledge
[1:55:16] Hallelujah
[1:55:17] they'll pick up one little thing and say
[1:55:20] brother name was wrong here he didn't
[1:55:22] say but what do they say about the whole
[1:55:24] lot that is the truth
[1:55:27] if we might agree with him and say okay
[1:55:29] you say he was wrong here okay let's say
[1:55:31] he was wrong but what about all the
[1:55:33] other things
[1:55:36] they don't know what to say but the
[1:55:38] knowledge
[1:55:39] of the scriptures
[1:55:41] the knowledge
[1:55:42] you know with knowledge you know where
[1:55:44] you come from
[1:55:47] you know how the Lord brought you
[1:55:50] you know you know saw your armed so much
[1:55:54] I don't know
[1:55:57] spend time with knowledge
[1:56:01] you know you you add that knowledge of
[1:56:03] knowing the Lord you know it preachers
[1:56:06] know that now brother pranam says
[1:56:10] nobody
[1:56:13] can be a preacher
[1:56:15] unless
[1:56:18] he has met him face to face in the
[1:56:21] bedding push
[1:56:22] you remember what he says
[1:56:25] myself depending push experience doesn't
[1:56:27] he say
[1:56:29] and while we see it as the congregation
[1:56:32] we say so and so might not might not
[1:56:35] have the the the the pointing push
[1:56:38] experience how can he preach to us how
[1:56:40] can he even sink how can he do that we
[1:56:42] doubt him if he ever had the penny push
[1:56:44] experience problem turns around and says
[1:56:47] in fact nobody can call himself a
[1:56:51] Christian
[1:56:54] unless he said he has that experience
[1:56:57] you must add that knowledge
[1:57:00] add the knowledge and the Lord is I'm
[1:57:02] coming to Temperance and I'm finished
[1:57:05] that's where I was coming with
[1:57:07] Temperance you know what with Temperance
[1:57:09] they think now you know like I said
[1:57:12] turn out to have temperances to you know
[1:57:15] kind of all your dignity don't talk to
[1:57:17] everyone don't talk loud and you know
[1:57:20] must be a lady gentleman like you have
[1:57:23] Temperance and problem it says
[1:57:30] says now with Temperance people think
[1:57:34] that is stopping drinking
[1:57:37] if you don't go to Dubai anymore
[1:57:40] you're done having a few drinks
[1:57:44] you don't smoke
[1:57:46] you think you have temperance
[1:57:48] problems Temperance is not that right
[1:57:52] temperance
[1:57:54] is to be able
[1:57:56] to hold your tongue
[1:58:03] we don't do it
[1:58:06] we don't hold our own tongues that's why
[1:58:08] these boys I'm sorry to call them boys
[1:58:10] but they are
[1:58:12] that's why they just open their mouths
[1:58:16] something comes out
[1:58:18] in the internet against the man of God
[1:58:21] against the prophet of God against
[1:58:24] everything they just talk because they
[1:58:26] don't have that temperance
[1:58:28] but brother sister have you been around
[1:58:31] people that will say we we went on
[1:58:33] Gossip we don't gossip brother but I
[1:58:36] want to tell you
[1:58:41] no no no no no it's not a gossip but
[1:58:44] really he is like this oh brother
[1:58:47] I was in a church and the brother was
[1:58:50] doing so well preaching and he brought a
[1:58:52] lot of codes uh about brother pranam
[1:58:56] says even if your brother is wrong
[1:58:58] instead of talking about it
[1:59:02] pray for him
[1:59:04] and the brother read some Causeway
[1:59:05] problem says if possible cover it up
[1:59:09] don't talk about it to somebody else
[1:59:12] you can go and correct him as I when the
[1:59:15] two of you are there you pray for him
[1:59:17] and today we gossip so much
[1:59:22] not here
[1:59:24] but I've seen many
[1:59:27] message belief of us that are gossipus
[1:59:31] now brother we don't gossip
[1:59:33] we don't go and they talk they talk
[1:59:36] little he throws a little he says no
[1:59:38] it's not a question but yeah it's the
[1:59:40] truth man she is like this and he is
[1:59:43] like you know when that evil thing has
[1:59:46] come amongst the people they will even
[1:59:48] go into
[1:59:50] gossiping
[1:59:53] about the elders in the church
[1:59:57] gossiping
[1:59:58] about somebody said there were times
[2:00:02] when they used
[2:00:10] to invite the pastor
[2:00:13] for lunch
[2:00:15] party says these days
[2:00:18] they have the pasta for lunch
[2:00:25] they used to invite him for lunch but
[2:00:28] now they they have the pastor for you
[2:00:32] know
[2:00:33] it's so terrible but it happened since
[2:00:36] I'm not here maybe
[2:00:37] in many places but then brother sister
[2:00:41] now
[2:00:42] talking about that you know in the Old
[2:00:46] Testament
[2:00:47] when the children of Israel were
[2:00:49] forbidden not to eat certain Birds
[2:00:52] certain animals
[2:00:53] you know what another birthday we're
[2:00:55] forbidden not to eat
[2:00:57] to you maybe no they were forbidden not
[2:01:00] to eat an eagle
[2:01:04] Sovereign were not supposed to eat each
[2:01:06] other
[2:01:07] we are eagles Hallelujah
[2:01:10] we supposed to protect each other we're
[2:01:13] supposed to help but the thing is we do
[2:01:16] not add
[2:01:18] that temperance
[2:01:20] if you add that Temperance you use your
[2:01:22] mouth so much in praying so much is
[2:01:24] blessed blessing the next one and
[2:01:27] brother pranam gave us a simple thing he
[2:01:29] says if you have if you don't have
[2:01:30] anything to say just say God bless you
[2:01:33] God bless you God bless you he made it
[2:01:37] so simple because how much we we we we
[2:01:39] we we should now revving up
[2:01:43] let me read this this one one one one
[2:01:46] quote again my brother if you may the
[2:01:49] same same message that you were on
[2:01:51] and now this one is uh
[2:02:04] was that paragraph 38
[2:02:08] I might have Twisted no I have not
[2:02:11] um but I wrote a wrong one still
[2:02:14] oh I will see this one here I will see
[2:02:17] this one here sorry brother I'm just
[2:02:19] about to to sit down now
[2:02:24] in this one this is now uh
[2:02:27] I don't know if my paragraphs are
[2:02:29] correct it looks like it's paragraph 16
[2:02:32] here but it's something else
[2:02:35] Joseph was another believer
[2:02:39] he couldn't help being what he was
[2:02:42] he says
[2:02:45] he was different from his brothers but
[2:02:47] he was different
[2:02:49] God made him what he is
[2:02:52] nobody else could take his place
[2:02:56] he says
[2:03:02] nobody can take your place
[2:03:05] no matter how little
[2:03:07] you say I'm just a housewife
[2:03:10] brother Brahm says nobody can take your
[2:03:12] place
[2:03:14] God in his great economy
[2:03:18] he says
[2:03:21] did you see it brother
[2:03:23] okay
[2:03:25] he says nobody can take your place no
[2:03:28] matter how little you say I'm just a
[2:03:30] housewife nobody can take your place God
[2:03:33] in his great economy has so said so the
[2:03:37] body of Christ
[2:03:38] in order till there is no one can take
[2:03:42] your place
[2:03:44] now
[2:03:46] why why what I would like us
[2:03:48] to to realize we know it
[2:03:51] that each and every one of us has got a
[2:03:56] role to play
[2:03:58] God calls into you into this church he's
[2:04:01] got a role for you to play in our own
[2:04:04] lives you know I'll drop this in I'm
[2:04:06] going on with that code and I'm closing
[2:04:08] you know
[2:04:09] Nelson Mandela a politician
[2:04:14] they ask him in his
[2:04:16] time when he was aging they said what if
[2:04:21] you were given a second chance
[2:04:23] to live again and relive your life
[2:04:26] what would you do
[2:04:29] I wonder if that question would be posed
[2:04:31] to all of us here what would be our
[2:04:34] answer
[2:04:35] given a chance that you must relive your
[2:04:38] life
[2:04:39] many Corrections
[2:04:42] you do many Corrections
[2:04:44] because we say if if the Lord had given
[2:04:48] me this message when I was young if I
[2:04:50] could have done this and this I have
[2:04:52] done so many mistakes
[2:04:53] you know what Nelson Mandela said when
[2:04:55] they asked him
[2:04:57] you can Google that one
[2:04:59] he says give in a second chance
[2:05:02] I would do exactly what I did
[2:05:07] and I thought what
[2:05:09] go to jail again for 27 years
[2:05:13] do all he says you know to me
[2:05:17] that showed me a man that had found his
[2:05:20] position
[2:05:22] when you find your position in Christ
[2:05:24] you know no one will take your place
[2:05:28] you you cannot you in that you rather
[2:05:31] put it up my brother please because
[2:05:33] because
[2:05:37] nobody can take your place
[2:05:40] yes thank you brother
[2:05:43] down a little bit okay thank you oh okay
[2:05:47] okay okay
[2:05:49] jumping on us now
[2:05:53] but nobody can take your place
[2:05:56] he says if you knew if you are a
[2:05:59] housewife and I want I want to read on
[2:06:02] and thank you brother thank you he says
[2:06:05] how I would like to take Billy Graham's
[2:06:07] place
[2:06:08] any of us ministers talking to the
[2:06:11] minister they would like to be Billy
[2:06:13] Graham he says but we cannot do it
[2:06:15] but just remember Billy cannot take our
[2:06:19] place as well see we are all we all have
[2:06:22] a place some of us are evangelists
[2:06:26] some of us are prophets
[2:06:28] some of us are teachers
[2:06:31] some of us are pastors
[2:06:34] is that all the fivefold ministry
[2:06:36] evangelists
[2:06:38] prophets teachers pastors
[2:06:41] what did I not mention
[2:06:48] past us pastors okay
[2:06:51] Apostles oh thank you brother thank you
[2:06:53] oh that's what I like so much
[2:06:57] well I don't know why I like it well in
[2:07:00] this God problem talks about it Apostles
[2:07:03] pastors the fivefold
[2:07:06] but rather how many of us Brothers now
[2:07:09] promised propranam says it's only to men
[2:07:11] 35 for Ministries given how many of us
[2:07:14] know what we are
[2:07:19] you an apostle brother
[2:07:24] are you an evangelist my brother
[2:07:26] are you
[2:07:28] but if we could brother know our
[2:07:31] position in Christ no one is going to
[2:07:34] take our place
[2:07:36] I like it when he goes down he says he
[2:07:39] says even yes ah
[2:07:43] prophets we we whatever we are some
[2:07:47] Housewives
[2:07:48] some mechanics
[2:07:50] you know you just MBM again says
[2:07:56] it's your position
[2:07:58] the Lord put you there as a mechanic he
[2:08:01] says some farmers
[2:08:03] some of this in fact where when I close
[2:08:06] I didn't mean to to keep you so long
[2:08:08] when I close
[2:08:11] that very Nelson Mandela I was quoting
[2:08:14] here saying I would do exactly what I
[2:08:18] did
[2:08:19] here is in 1970s 78.
[2:08:24] I'm standing in front of a store
[2:08:26] they're selling newspaper and all those
[2:08:28] things Mandela is in jail he's been
[2:08:31] there for long and while reading this
[2:08:34] newspaper
[2:08:35] on the other side of of the window
[2:08:38] I read an article talking about Nelson
[2:08:40] Mandela and says
[2:08:42] Nelson Mandela who is serving life
[2:08:45] sentence on Robin Island
[2:08:47] that day brother I'm not telling lies
[2:08:50] I'm standing there the Lord says to me
[2:08:52] if I spoke from within says no no he
[2:08:55] won't die in jail
[2:08:57] he's gonna come out
[2:09:00] you know when God gives you anything
[2:09:02] when he talks to you about I don't know
[2:09:04] why he told me that but he did
[2:09:09] so I came out of that place and I'm
[2:09:13] working I know Lynn Salman hella will
[2:09:15] come out from jail
[2:09:17] later he's suffering with cancer he's
[2:09:20] sick he's being poisoned or whatever
[2:09:23] they called and a lot of other things
[2:09:25] but something inside me says well the
[2:09:28] Lord told me he's coming out of jail he
[2:09:30] will come out of I don't know why the
[2:09:31] Lord did it but that man
[2:09:34] in his capacity as a politician is that
[2:09:37] he stopped a lot of bloodshed
[2:09:42] I know
[2:09:44] people are not pleased with that some
[2:09:46] they say he compromised too much and I
[2:09:49] want to believe that but he stopped a
[2:09:52] lot of Bloodshed in the country now we
[2:09:56] as brothers and sisters you know what
[2:09:58] problem says about these virtues
[2:10:01] you can add and add an ad until you get
[2:10:03] to
[2:10:04] loving the the brothers you add you
[2:10:08] brotherly kindness kindness you add your
[2:10:10] head until you go to charity
[2:10:12] you can add until maybe you go past
[2:10:15] charity but problem says you know what
[2:10:18] these virtues are not all your virtues
[2:10:21] to begin with
[2:10:24] that's why sometimes you think I've
[2:10:26] grown up to here and all of a sudden you
[2:10:29] see the building has fallen
[2:10:31] I'm back where I thought I wasn't
[2:10:35] says it's not your virtue to begin with
[2:10:39] it's God's faith
[2:10:41] hallelujah it's not your faith
[2:10:44] When You Adventure it's not your virtue
[2:10:48] if it's you you're such a coward you
[2:10:50] know yourself
[2:10:52] but when you have that virtue you are so
[2:10:55] bold you speak about it anywhere anytime
[2:10:59] because it's not your factory sees
[2:11:01] virtue
[2:11:02] when you add
[2:11:04] that what's his next brother
[2:11:06] after Adventure knowledge when you have
[2:11:09] that knowledge you don't go around
[2:11:11] boasting that I know so much I know this
[2:11:14] message I can sit you down I can tell
[2:11:16] you don't do that sometimes you forget
[2:11:19] those things and the Lord brings them up
[2:11:21] when they ask one time I'm preaching in
[2:11:23] Johannesburg and open a meeting and
[2:11:25] while preaching that the Lord told me to
[2:11:27] and I'm preaching there and he has done
[2:11:29] the guy there while I was so busy I'm on
[2:11:32] fire I'm preaching he says to me hello
[2:11:35] sir may I ask a question now I thought
[2:11:39] he's disturbing me and normally you
[2:11:41] don't give him a chance so but they
[2:11:43] always go outside to me give him so I
[2:11:46] gave him the chance to ask a question he
[2:11:47] says where is the kingdom of God coming
[2:11:50] now
[2:11:51] I said to him well it's in the future
[2:11:53] but the word that I'm preaching to you
[2:11:55] now is making you a candidate for that
[2:11:58] Kingdom when it comes
[2:11:59] and he says to me now you don't know
[2:12:01] what I'm talking about I'm talking about
[2:12:04] the government when Jesus is going to be
[2:12:06] king and sit on the floor when is it
[2:12:07] coming I repeated myself and I tried to
[2:12:10] explain he says
[2:12:12] no man let the BFS where is the verse
[2:12:16] that says that where do I get that verse
[2:12:18] I'm busy with some other verses I'm
[2:12:20] preaching the people are listening the
[2:12:22] crowd is
[2:12:23] where do I get it you know what an angel
[2:12:26] stood up
[2:12:28] somebody from the crowd that I didn't
[2:12:30] even know where he came from I don't
[2:12:33] know where he went after that here's to
[2:12:35] there shot his whitish man stood
[2:12:37] somewhere there in the crowd he says
[2:12:39] here is the verse and he read it from
[2:12:42] The Book of Luke that the kingdom of God
[2:12:44] does not come with observation for the
[2:12:48] kingdom of God is within you I just said
[2:12:50] there you are
[2:12:55] you depend on him he's as Moses where
[2:12:59] when he made that that first miracle he
[2:13:03] threw down the this his stick and tend
[2:13:05] to it to a serpent and then the Pharaoh
[2:13:08] says ship magician trick
[2:13:11] Janice jambres come here throw your
[2:13:13] sticks as well so they did and Moses
[2:13:17] said to just depend on God
[2:13:19] on God's grace
[2:13:22] all the other serpents were swallowed by
[2:13:24] Moses's stick I just said there you are
[2:13:27] there's the vest and this guy says you
[2:13:30] can't tell me anything I'm a Bible
[2:13:32] scholar oh I went on him brother sister
[2:13:34] and I said you know what Jesus said to
[2:13:37] the Bible scholars of his day he said
[2:13:39] you Generation of Vipers
[2:13:41] and the man was so angry he comes to me
[2:13:43] he says you call me a Generation of
[2:13:44] Vipers I said no sir and I felt the Holy
[2:13:47] Ghost covering me like that
[2:13:50] I thought even if he hits me with his
[2:13:52] fist I won't feel it and he says
[2:13:56] he said you called me a Generation of
[2:13:58] Vipers I said no no you didn't get me I
[2:14:01] said Jesus said to those of his days you
[2:14:04] Generation of Vipers
[2:14:06] and he turns around he says that Bible
[2:14:09] is a liar
[2:14:11] he had attracted so many students that
[2:14:14] were coming from school they were there
[2:14:16] to see this preacher being defeated by
[2:14:18] an infidel
[2:14:20] and now he says that Bible is a liar and
[2:14:23] they were on him now they say you just
[2:14:24] said you're a Bible scholar and he says
[2:14:27] the Bible is a liar and they get it on
[2:14:29] and on and on brother I don't know what
[2:14:32] happened that day I'm just thinking
[2:14:34] about this thing that when I left
[2:14:38] I went to pray
[2:14:41] and
[2:14:42] from that day onward I couldn't walk on
[2:14:45] that spot
[2:14:47] I would be you know we used to as young
[2:14:49] men run down and up and down
[2:14:51] Johannesburg and he would be running
[2:14:53] rushing for a train and when I got to
[2:14:55] that spot something would so much fear
[2:14:58] that I would turn around and not walk
[2:15:01] there I don't know
[2:15:04] I don't know what happened there I don't
[2:15:06] know I would love to see that angel one
[2:15:09] day
[2:15:10] that should have been read that verse
[2:15:11] for me
[2:15:14] oh I'm convinced
[2:15:17] didn't no way
[2:15:18] he came from I Didn't I don't know where
[2:15:21] he came from I don't know where he went
[2:15:23] he just read the scripture
[2:15:25] and how soon
[2:15:27] he could have seen the scripture
[2:15:30] because he was not part of the preaching
[2:15:32] not part of that thing but he stood up
[2:15:33] he says here is a scripture brother
[2:15:35] sister
[2:15:37] the bride
[2:15:39] has made herself ready
[2:15:43] how many say we are ready
[2:15:45] problem says if you one day when we know
[2:15:51] who we are in Christ The Rapture will
[2:15:54] take place
[2:15:55] once you know so the bride is making
[2:15:58] herself ready we see all this noise
[2:16:00] outside all what they're doing there but
[2:16:03] the bride you know when that voice came
[2:16:05] it was just about the time that the
[2:16:07] files the plagues were gonna be poured
[2:16:10] and problem says before the plagues I
[2:16:12] have a part on Earth the Lord takes away
[2:16:15] his pride
[2:16:16] and the bride has made herself ready we
[2:16:20] are not to be church members
[2:16:23] I'm sorry brother
[2:16:24] if you teach people to be church members
[2:16:27] it's okay
[2:16:28] but we're not supposed to be only church
[2:16:30] members
[2:16:31] we're supposed to be part and parcel of
[2:16:35] that bright that indivisible bride that
[2:16:39] bride that is all over who is supposed
[2:16:41] to be and we make ourselves ready for he
[2:16:46] is coming
