[13:14] our service tonight with a word of
[13:15] prayer?
[13:18] Amen.
[13:25] [Music]
[13:31] Let us pray.
[13:33] Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord,
[13:36] that you allowed us to come here
[13:37] tonight, Lord. We pray that you would be
[13:40] here, Lord, that you would bless us,
[13:42] Lord, and speak to us, whatever you have
[13:45] for us, Lord, as we heard this morning,
[13:48] Lord, that the times and the seasons,
[13:51] Lord, and believing that your cycle for
[13:55] the bride is right around us, Lord. it.
[13:58] We know it's getting close, Lord. We see
[14:00] the signs of the time. We see the nation
[14:05] in an uprise, Lord. And we see nature
[14:08] just going berserk, Lord. We say we know
[14:12] that's the the prophet told us that's
[14:15] the uh sixth seal is the interruption of
[14:18] nature. So everything's there, Lord.
[14:20] Help us Lord to wake up Lord to come
[14:23] into full realization Lord
[14:27] to become one with you is our desire
[14:29] here Lord bless us Lord but pray for the

[14:49] appreciate you Lord have your way, Lord.
[14:51] We pray thee in Jesus Christ's name.
[14:54] Amen.
[14:56] [Music]
[15:04] &gt;&gt; The people in the back, we did not have
[15:05] the songs for them before service, so
[15:08] they're going to be uh maybe playing
[15:10] catchup a little bit. But maybe if we
[15:12] have the song, Who I Am. Oh, Glorious
[15:16] Victory. That day he set me free.
[15:21] Oh, glorious victory.
[15:24] That day he set me free
[15:28] and made my heart
[15:32] his very throne.
[15:36] My life is no longer mine.
[15:40] I'm a prisoner of the divine
[15:44] and now I dare
[15:48] to praise his name.
[15:52] Oh I am Lord
[15:57] who I am.
[16:00] Oh, I can see now
[16:05] just who I am.
[16:09] A part of my Savior,
[16:13] a part of his word.
[16:17] It's a revelation
[16:21] of who I am.
[16:26] on Calary he died
[16:30] to redeem his loss for I. The King of
[16:35] Kings
[16:38] became my Savior.
[16:42] This is God's great mystery
[16:47] of love expressed to me
[16:50] that Christ and I
[16:55] might be made one.
[16:58] [Music]
[16:59] Oh I am Lord.
[17:03] Oh who I am.
[17:08] I can see now
[17:12] is who I am.
[17:16] A part of my savior,
[17:20] a part of his word.
[17:24] It's a revelation.
[17:28] It's predestination
[17:32] of who I am.
[17:37] Amen. You can be seated.
[17:40] Hallelujah. It's so good to be together
[17:41] again. And I always look forward to the
[17:44] evening services, the Sunday evening in
[17:46] the cool of the evening when God came
[17:48] into the garden to speak with his
[17:49] people. And you know, sometimes we look
[17:52] around, it's not quite as full on a
[17:53] Sunday night as a Sunday morning, but
[17:55] he's promised that we're two or three
[17:57] gathered together. He's here. And as
[17:59] long as he is here, I don't care who
[18:01] else is here.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if it's just he and I tonight,
[18:05] that's what if we can just shut
[18:07] everything else out and just get to that
[18:09] point where Lord, it's just just you and
[18:11] I tonight. I don't care who's looking at
[18:13] me. I don't care about anything other
[18:16] than just being in your presence, making
[18:18] you welcome and and hearing from you.
[18:21] And so that's what my expectation is
[18:23] this evening. How many can say that's
[18:25] that's why you're here as well tonight?
[18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:30] These are the days of Elijah declaring
[18:32] the words of the Lord.
[18:38] These are the days of Elijah
[18:43] declaring the word of the Lord.
[18:48] And these are the days of your serant
[18:52] Moses righteousness being restored.
[18:56] [Music]
[18:58] And though these are days of great
[19:00] trials,
[19:03] with famine and darkness and sorrow,
[19:08] still we are a voice in the desert.
[19:12] Christ prepare ye the way of the Lord.
[19:16] Behold, he comes riding on the cloud,
[19:22] shining like the sun. At the trumpets
[19:25] fall, lift your voice. It's the year of
[19:30] Jubilee
[19:31] and out of Zion till salvation
[19:35] comes.
[19:40] And these are the days of Ezekiel,
[19:45] the dry bones becoming as flesh.
[19:50] And these are the days of your servant
[19:54] David rebuilding the temple of praise.
[20:00] And these are the days of the harvest.
[20:05] The fields are as wide in the world.
[20:10] And we are the laborers in your
[20:14] vineyard. Declaring the word of the
[20:17] Lord.
[20:19] Holy comes riding on the cloud, shining
[20:25] like the sun at the trumpet call. Lift
[20:30] your voice. The year of jubilee
[20:34] out of Zion till salvation
[20:38] comes.
[20:43] There's no God like Jehovah. There's no
[20:46] God like Jehovah. There's no God like
[20:50] Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah.

[21:14] There's no God like Jehovah. There's no
[21:18] God like Jehovah. There's no God like
[21:21] Jehovah.
[21:23] Behold, he comes riding on the cloud,
[21:28] shining like the sun at the trumpet
[21:32] call. Lift your voice. It's the year
[21:36] after
[21:39] Zion till salvation
[21:42] comes. Behold, he comes riding on the
[21:47] cloud, shining like the sun. At the
[21:52] trumpet call, lift your voice. It's the
[21:56] year of Jubilee
[21:58] and out of Zion till salvation
[22:03] comes.
[22:06] [Music]
[22:08] Behold,
[22:09] he comes
[22:13] riding on the cloud,
[22:17] shining like a sun
[22:21] at the trumpet call.
[22:26] Lift your voice. It's the year of jubile
[22:34] out of Zion here.
[22:37] Salvation
[22:40] comes.
[22:41] [Music]
[22:44] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen to that? There's
[22:46] no God like Jehovah. Amen. Key of Eflat.
[22:50] Where could I go but to the Lord
[22:54] living below
[22:58] in this whole sinful world?
[23:02] Hardly a comfort can afford.
[23:11] Striving alone
[23:14] to face temptation. So
[23:18] oh where could I go but to the Lord?
[23:26] I'm asking you where could I go? Tell me
[23:31] where could I go?
[23:36] Seeking a refuge for my soul
[23:43] and needing a friend
[23:48] to help me in the end.
[23:52] Oh, where could I go but to the Lord?
[23:57] The last verse. Life here is grand.
[24:02] Life here is grand.
[24:05] With friends I love so dear.
[24:10] And comfort I get from God's own word.
[24:17] [Music]
[24:19] Yet when I face
[24:22] the chilling hand of death,
[24:26] tell me where could I go but to the
[24:31] Lord.
[24:34] I'm asking you where
[24:37] could I go?
[24:40] Where could I go?
[24:44] seeking
[24:46] a refuge for my soul
[24:53] and needed a friend
[24:57] to help me in the end.
[25:01] Oh, where could I go but to the Lord?
[25:07] Sing it one more time as we stand. I'm
[25:09] asking you, where could I go?
[25:14] Oh, where could I go?
[25:19] Seeking
[25:21] a refuge for my soul
[25:27] and needing
[25:29] a prayer
[25:32] to help me in the end.
[25:36] Oh, where could I come unto the Lord?
[25:42] [Music]
[25:45] Amen. Brothers, if you'd come for the
[25:46] offering and brother Galante, if you
[25:48] would take the request,
[25:52] brother Chris Smith, haven't seen him
[25:54] the services today. He had been asking
[25:56] us to remember his brother-in-law
[25:58] Troy Petty in our prayers. Brother Troy
[26:01] went went on to the other side on
[26:04] Friday. So, just pray for the the Smith
[26:06] family, the Petty family, and those that
[26:08] are that are going through that. Jesus
[26:11] promises, "Blessed are they that mourn
[26:13] for they'll be comforted." And he uses
[26:16] he uses us. We're his hands. We're his
[26:18] we're his mouth. We're the people that
[26:20] he can use to comfort in times like
[26:22] this. And so just pray for Chris and and
[26:24] sister Carlina. It's Carlina's sister's
[26:28] husband is is is who that was. So
[26:30] remember, brother Joe, if you could
[26:32] bring the rest of the needs for us.
[26:39] Thank you.
[26:42] Amen.
[26:44] Just a few prayer requests. We uh our
[26:47] brother Jonathan Mmbi, he sits over
[26:50] there. Uh he had to leave work. He's
[26:54] sick. Brother Art and his family, Art
[26:57] Salceto.
[26:58] Unspoken request, of course. Bobby
[27:01] Wart's family. Brother Chuck and Sister
[27:05] Barbara. Uh condolences there.
[27:09] Brother Jim Alexander in Mesa, he's a
[27:13] deacon there and he's got a serious
[27:15] situation in the hospital.
[27:18] Abby and Trevor Boyd not feeling well.
[27:20] Of course, the November meetings also.
[27:24] Let's go to him in prayer.
[27:27] Father God, we know there's no place for
[27:30] us to go but to the Lord. Lord, you've
[27:34] always provided for us. You're our
[27:36] shepherd, Lord. we shall not want. You
[27:40] lead us, Father, by the still waters.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, we know that goodness and mercy
[27:46] shall follow us all the days of our
[27:47] life.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; So, Father, as a church, Father, we just
[27:51] unite right now for all of these needs.
[27:54] Lord, we come against any plan of the
[27:56] enemy that would put anything on your
[27:59] children, Father.
[28:01] Lord, we just rebuke them in Jesus'
[28:03] name. And we hold up that blood stained
[28:06] banner, Lord, the stripes that you took,
[28:09] Father. And we ask you to have mercy,
[28:11] Lord, on everyone for other this brother
[28:14] Troy and his that has passed, Lord, and
[28:17] his family. We pray, Lord, that you'd
[28:19] comfort and console them also.
[28:22] Lord Jesus, without you, we could do
[28:24] nothing. Lord, we pray for brother
[28:26] Israel and the remainder of the service
[28:29] that you'd have your way. Lord, that the
[28:31] junction of the Holy Ghost, the
[28:34] anointing, Father, would be there, Lord,
[28:37] on our lives and on our ears, Father,
[28:40] that we would take heed how we hear,
[28:44] Lord Jesus. We're grateful for the
[28:45] revelation of yourself. It's personal to
[28:48] us, Father.
[28:49] Lord, we give you all the glory and the
[28:52] praise. In thy mighty name we ask it.
[28:56] Amen.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; He is here.
[29:00] Listen
[29:03] closely.
[29:05] Hear him calling
[29:08] out
[29:10] your name.
[29:12] [Music]
[29:13] He is here.
[29:17] You
[29:18] can't touch him. You will never
[29:25] be
[29:26] the same. Let's put the first verse upon
[29:29] that if we could.
[29:32] I sense
[29:34] an awesome
[29:37] moving
[29:40] of the Holy
[29:43] Spirit.
[29:47] And I see
[29:50] his countenance
[29:55] resting
[29:56] on your face.
[30:01] [Music]
[30:03] And I know
[30:06] that there
[30:08] are angels
[30:11] hovering all
[30:14] around us.
[30:17] For the presence
[30:20] of the Lord
[30:24] is in this place.
[30:28] [Music]
[30:31] Yes, he is
[30:34] here.
[30:37] Hallelujah.
[30:41] He is here.
[30:44] Amen.
[30:48] He is hereless.
[30:54] Mostly
[30:56] I will bless
[30:59] his name again. Oh, he is here.
[31:08] Listen
[31:10] closely.
[31:12] Hear him calling
[31:16] out your name.
[31:20] He is here.
[31:24] You can touch him, you will never
[31:32] [Music]
[31:36] amen, praise the Lord.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Thank God for his presence. Amen. We
[31:41] want to we're going to play the tape
[31:43] tonight. But before we do, I wanted to
[31:46] read a scripture in Romans 1 and then
[31:49] we'll play two portions of the
[31:52] conversion of these two infidels I
[31:54] didn't get to this morning and I think
[31:56] it'll be a blessing to each of us. Amen.
[31:59] And if you take Romans chapter 1
[32:03] quickly, good to see you again, Sister
[32:06] Schul. Amen. God bless her richly and
[32:10] happy to see each of you. Amen. Romans
[32:13] chapter 1. I've been trying to encourage
[32:17] uh myself and the Lord to uh to be a
[32:21] witness
[32:22] of just the light on water baptism. I
[32:26] think we miss many people because we uh
[32:29] want to share with them the great light,
[32:32] but many of them are just in a false
[32:34] baptism. And if we can bring them there
[32:37] and they accept that, then the Lord will
[32:39] give them more light. And so, um, it's
[32:42] so beautiful. We have the truth on that.
[32:45] Water baptism is in the name of the Lord
[32:47] Jesus Christ, but a lot of people don't
[32:50] even know that. So, it's a beautiful
[32:52] little opportunity that I feel like we
[32:54] missed. We may have missed. Yesterday,
[32:56] we had a funeral service at for brother
[32:59] Art's first cousin there in Phoenix. And
[33:02] it was a low crowded group there nice
[33:06] group of people but you know not all
[33:09] Christians and some of them were good
[33:12] poor most of them were not believers and
[33:16] we had the opportunity to share with
[33:17] them and I really wanted to open up the
[33:20] opportunity for um feel like I missed it
[33:24] to give them the opportunity to get an
[33:27] understanding of more of the word more
[33:30] of truth And um but it turns out a
[33:33] number of them were asking to have a
[33:36] Bible study. And so pray for that. This
[33:40] is Art's desire. He's always been
[33:43] witnessing to his family and here they
[33:45] are are at this event. Sad, but they
[33:49] were all there and we got a chance to to
[33:52] minister the word of life. Just a small
[33:55] portion. I took a little truth. Three
[33:57] kinds of believers. believer make
[34:00] believer and unbeliever. Which one are
[34:02] you? And so nice little truth from the
[34:05] message, just a little appetizer. You're
[34:08] like, "Okay, let's hear some more of
[34:09] that."
[34:11] And so we'll we'll ask the Lord to help
[34:13] us on that. In Romans chapter 1,
[34:18] this Oh, I forgot that Bible in the
[34:21] living Bible. I just wanted to read that
[34:24] um
[34:26] part there in Romans chapter 1, but
[34:29] verse number
[34:33] 19.
[34:38] Maybe someone can get that Bible off my
[34:40] desk. It's the hard bound. John, you got
[34:43] it. Thank you. And just we'll read this
[34:46] and we'll have you seated. because that
[34:48] which may be known of God is manifest in
[34:51] them. For God hath showed it unto them.
[34:56] For the invisible things of him from the
[34:58] creation of the world are clearly seen,
[35:03] being understood by the things that are
[35:06] made, even his eternal power and
[35:10] godhead, so that they are without
[35:14] excuse.
[35:17] Amen. He's gonna actually turn it in for
[35:20] me. Thank you, John. That's service
[35:23] right there.
[35:26] I want to read this from the uh let me
[35:28] see what translation this is. I'll tell
[35:30] you New Living Translation. Okay. Um I'm
[35:34] a King James guy. Okay. I'll read from
[35:37] another translation just to get the
[35:39] definition of a word. Is that okay?
[35:42] &gt;&gt; You use Google for many understandings.
[35:46] So this is just to get this word here.
[35:49] And I want to read this in verse
[35:52] number
[35:54] 17.
[35:58] This good news tells us how God makes us
[36:01] right in his sight. This is this is
[36:04] accomplished from the start to finish by
[36:06] faith. As the scriptures say, it is
[36:10] through faith that a righteous person
[36:12] has life. But God shows his anger from
[36:16] heaven against all sinful wicked people
[36:20] who
[36:22] and our Bible says hold the truth but it
[36:24] says who suppress the truth by their
[36:26] wickedness. They know the truth about
[36:29] God because he has made it obvious to
[36:32] them. For ever since the world has was
[36:36] created, people have seen the earth and
[36:39] sky through everything God made. They
[36:43] can clearly see his invisible qualities,
[36:47] his eternal power and divine nature. So
[36:51] they have no excuse for not knowing God.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; It's so nice because this onslaught of
[37:00] atheism
[37:02] &gt;&gt; and agnosticism
[37:04] and unbelief has darkened the age. And
[37:08] we have and and even our young people
[37:11] and some of us that influence tries to
[37:13] get on us and they tell us they don't
[37:16] believe in God anymore. Don't you
[37:18] believe it. The Bible says they clearly
[37:22] see cuz God has revealed himself to
[37:25] them. They do believe in a God. They're
[37:27] just suppressing the truth. And I think
[37:30] once you know that, you won't give up on
[37:32] the infidel or the unbeliever.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; So may God add a blessing to the reading
[37:36] of his word. You may be seated. God
[37:38] bless you.
[37:40] They suppress the truth or they hold the
[37:43] truth. Now, there's two God bless you.
[37:45] Thank you, sis. Um there's two places
[37:50] that we will play for you and there are
[37:54] two testimonies and then we'll play the
[37:57] message thy house that brother Brandham
[38:00] is going to um take that and that's
[38:03] about 45 minutes or so of that tape that
[38:07] will bless all of our hearts and in the
[38:10] message
[38:11] this testimony Lord show us the father
[38:14] and it sufficeth
[38:16] us is paragraphs 79 to 82
[38:22] and if they have that yes thank you
[38:26] be sincere be humble devoid that's right
[38:29] and Dr. Davis standing there and old
[38:32] Methodist bishop was sitting there but
[38:34] this young preacher the young Roy Davis
[38:36] he was standing there but this bishop
[38:38] that infidel said any of you guys and
[38:41] some of the minister saying Mark 16 from
[38:43] the 9th verse on is not inspired
[38:46] it isn't inspired so you can't depend on
[38:49] it he said well then I'll say there come
[38:52] unto me all you labor and heavy lad
[38:53] Matthew 11:27 said I say that's not
[38:56] inspired
[38:58] so he had him on a spot
[39:00] Roy said the Holy Ghost began to move on
[39:02] him. They stand up there.
[39:05] So he said the old bishop, he said, "If
[39:07] that infidel makes that challenge one
[39:09] more time, if I die in my shoes, I'll go
[39:13] to heaven believing God's word."
[39:16] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Now listen, son, sit down.
[39:17] Let him just He's just popping his own
[39:19] brain. Let him alone." So it's the Holy
[39:21] Spirit moving. So when he made that
[39:23] challenge, let a big haha ina hell his
[39:25] watch said, "If there's a God, I'll die
[39:26] in a minute." Wait for a minute. said,
[39:28] "Didn't I tell you what was no such a
[39:29] thing?" Haha, like that. Laughed out
[39:32] like that. So Roy when he made that
[39:34] challenge said, "What about some of you
[39:35] guys out there believing God for real?"
[39:38] So try this siric acid test. Now I'm not
[39:42] telling people to do that. Don't you do
[39:43] it. That's the Holy Ghost is with you.
[39:45] See, now I don't believe in taking up
[39:47] serpents. I believe if I was baptizing
[39:49] out in the water and a serpent grabbed
[39:50] me, I'd throw him out on the bank and go
[39:52] ahead and baptize like Paul did or
[39:54] something like that. If somebody slipped
[39:56] poison to me, I'd trust God for my
[39:57] healing. That's right. But I don't
[39:59] believe in bringing things said, "Come
[40:00] here and I'll show you I can do it." I
[40:02] think that's wrong. That's right. But
[40:04] brother Davis walked up to the platform.
[40:06] We got a notary public statement on
[40:08] this. He walked up there. He said,
[40:10] "Christian people," about two or three
[40:12] thousand sitting there. He said, "I'm 25
[40:15] years old." He said, "I'm a minister of
[40:18] the gospel." And he said, "I I know that
[40:21] my God is able to deliver me from that."
[40:24] But said, "Nevertheless, if he does or
[40:26] does not, I'll never let that infidel
[40:29] stand there with that in his hand and
[40:30] challenged God's word." He said, "I'll
[40:32] meet you in glory." Grabbed it out of
[40:34] his hand, even in drank every drop of it
[40:36] right down. Stood there and preached the
[40:38] gospel. And about 1500 people received
[40:40] the baptism of the Holy Ghost sitting in
[40:42] the meeting. Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[40:46] Not that same infidel at coming back. He
[40:49] wanted to take a rest and he went out
[40:50] here in the western Colorado and he had
[40:52] a camp out there and he's walking down
[40:54] along the path there one day and he
[40:56] began walking along. He kind of felt
[40:58] kind of bad. His health is breaking on
[41:00] him and he had look up there and the
[41:01] wind is blowing them great big rocks
[41:03] hanging in the mountains. He said,
[41:04] "Wonder if I've been wrong."
[41:07] He got out. He said, "Oh, wherever you
[41:09] are, who you are." Said, "Look at those
[41:12] rocks hanging there. Have I been wrong?
[41:15] Has the water washed them away like
[41:17] that? Where did God place them there
[41:18] like that? What was it? God speaking in
[41:21] his universe. If they hold their peace,
[41:24] the preachers, the rocks will
[41:25] immediately cry out there. That infidel
[41:27] fell on his knees and gave his heart to
[41:30] God because the rocks was a crying out
[41:32] of God speaking out of mother nature to
[41:34] him. Hallelujah.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; God is in his universe. Do you believe
[41:38] it?
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I could stay on that another
[41:41] hour. Let's just stop a minute. God in
[41:44] his universe. I'll hurry at these others
[41:45] right quick. God.
[42:08] He said, "Would you don't mean you've
[42:10] got to low down till you have to tow a
[42:12] preacher with you wherever you go." So
[42:15] he's a rough old character. So I thought
[42:17] I'd bring you out of the car, you know.
[42:19] So I got out and walked around and um he
[42:22] said, "Well, and you're a preacher,
[42:24] huh?" I said, "Yes, sir." He looked me
[42:26] up and down. Squirrel blooded dirt and
[42:29] he said, I said, "Don't look much like
[42:31] you." He said, "Well, I kind of like
[42:33] that." He said, "You know, I want to
[42:36] tell you something." He said, "Uh, I'm
[42:38] supposed to be an infidel." I said,
[42:40] "Yes, sir. I understood that." I said,
[42:42] 'I don't think it's much to brag about,
[42:43] ow, do you? He said, 'Well, he said, 'I
[42:46] don't know.' He said, 'I going to tell
[42:48] you what I think of you guys.' I said,
[42:50] 'All right. He said, 'You're barking up
[42:52] the wrong tree. And uh how many knows
[42:54] what that means? See, it means it's a
[42:56] lying dog. You see, the coup's not up
[42:58] there at all. You see? He said, "You're
[43:00] barking up the wrong tree." I said,
[43:02] "That's to opinion." And uh he said, um,
[43:05] well, he said, "Look, you see that old
[43:07] chimney stand up there?" Yes, I was born
[43:09] up there 75 years ago. And said, I've
[43:12] lived right here in these hills all
[43:13] around here all these years. And said,
[43:16] I've looked towards the skies. I've
[43:17] looked here and there, and surely in all
[43:20] these 75 years, I would have seen
[43:22] something that looked like God. Didn't
[43:23] you think so? I said, well, it depends
[43:25] on what you're looking at here. What
[43:27] you're looking for? And he said, "Well,"
[43:29] he said, "I I certainly don't believe
[43:31] there is such a creature, and I believe
[43:33] you fellas just simply get out and
[43:35] swindle the people out of their money
[43:36] and everything, and that's the way it
[43:38] goes." I said, "Well, uh, you're
[43:40] American citizen. You have a right to
[43:42] your own own thinking." He said,
[43:45] "There's one guy one time that I heard
[43:48] of. He said that I would sure um, if he
[43:52] ever get to talk with that fellow said,
[43:54] I'd like to to ask him a few questions."
[43:56] I said, "Yes, sir." He said, "It was a
[43:59] preacher. You might know him." Said he
[44:00] had a meeting up here in Camelsville not
[44:03] long ago in a church yard up there, a
[44:06] campground. And he said, "I forget his
[44:08] name." Said he's from Indiana. And I
[44:11] said, "Oh, yes, sir." And Brother
[44:13] Woodstar said, "Well, I don't say
[44:15] nothing." And so he said, "Um I said,
[44:17] 'What about him?" He said, 'Well, he
[44:20] said, 'Old, lady, somebody up there on
[44:22] the hill. Said, you know, she was dying
[44:25] with cancer. And said, wife and I would
[44:28] go up there of a morning to to uh change
[44:31] her bed. Said they couldn't even raise
[44:32] her up high enough to put her on the bed
[44:34] pan. Said they just had to pull a draw
[44:36] sheet and said she was dying. She had
[44:38] been to Louisville and said the doctors
[44:40] had give her up and said she was going
[44:43] to die. and her sister went up that
[44:45] meeting and said that preacher would
[44:47] stand up on a platform, looked back over
[44:49] the audience and called this woman by
[44:51] name and told her when she left, she
[44:53] took a handkerchief and put it in her
[44:55] her purse and called this woman's name
[44:57] down here 20 miles below here. Said how
[45:00] she was suffering with cancer, what her
[45:02] name was and all she had been through.
[45:04] Said, "Take that handkerchief and go lay
[45:05] it on the woman and said it the woman
[45:08] will be healed of her cancer." and said
[45:11] they come down here that night and said
[45:12] honest I heard the office screaming up
[45:14] there I thought they had the Salvation
[45:16] Army turned loose on top of the hill up
[45:18] there said well I said I guess old
[45:20] sister's dead said we'll tomorrow we'll
[45:23] go and get the wagon how we take her out
[45:25] to get to the main road and said so they
[45:27] can take her to the undertaker and said
[45:29] that we waited no need to go up that
[45:32] time of night said it's about a mile up
[45:33] on the hill here said we went up there
[45:35] the next morning and you know what
[45:37] happened I said no sir he said she was
[45:40] sitting there eating fried apple pies
[45:42] and drinking coffee with her husband.
[45:45] I said, "You mean that?" He said, "Yes,
[45:48] sir." Oh, I said, "Now, mister, you
[45:51] really don't mean that." He said, "What
[45:54] bothers me is what um how did that man
[45:58] never in this country and knew that?"
[46:01] And I said, "Oh, you don't believe
[46:03] that?" He said, "It's the truth." I
[46:04] said, "You believe that?" See, he's he
[46:06] said, "Well, go right up there on the
[46:07] hill. I can prove it to you." He's
[46:09] preaching back to me now. So I said I
[46:13] picked up a apple and and I said, "Can I
[46:16] have one of these apples?" I rubbed it
[46:17] on my clothes. He said, "Well, the
[46:19] yellow jackets are eating them up. I
[46:21] guess you can have one." And I said,
[46:24] "Uh, well um I bit bit into it." I said,
[46:27] "That's a nice apple." He said, "Oh,
[46:28] yes." Said, "You know what? I planted
[46:30] that tree there oh 40 years ago or
[46:33] something like that." I said, "Oh, is
[46:34] that right?" "Yes, sir." And I said,
[46:37] 'Well, um, and every year, I said, 'I
[46:39] noticed we haven't had no frost yet.
[46:41] It's early August. And I said, them
[46:43] leaves are falling off the trees. Yes,
[46:45] sir. That's right. It's coming on fall,
[46:46] but we're going to have a early one this
[46:48] time. I said, yes, sir. Change of
[46:49] subject. See? And he said, I said, well,
[46:51] do you know um uh it's strange. I said,
[46:55] um how that sap goes out of that tree. I
[46:59] said, leaves falls off and yet there's
[47:01] no um there haven't had no frost to kill
[47:04] the leaf. And he said, "Uh, well," he
[47:07] said, "Uh, what's that got to do with
[47:08] what we're talking about?" And I said,
[47:10] "Well, I I just wondered, you know, mama
[47:13] always said, give a cow enough rope and
[47:15] it'll hang itself, you know, so I just
[47:16] give him plenty of rope." So, he went on
[47:18] He said, "Well, yes. What's that got to
[47:20] do with it?" I said, "You know, uh, God
[47:23] brings them apples up and you enjoy
[47:25] those apples and leaves." He said, "In
[47:27] the shade and so forth, it goes down the
[47:30] fall of the year."
[47:31] I said, "Uh, comes back up again with
[47:33] the apples and with the leaves again."
[47:35] And, um, he said, "Oh, that's just
[47:37] nature." See, that's just nature. I
[47:41] said, "Well, of course that's nature." I
[47:43] said, "That's nature, but somebody has
[47:45] to control nature." See, I he said, "You
[47:49] tell me now what does that?" He said,
[47:52] "Well, it's just just naturally nature."
[47:54] I said, "Who is it that says to that
[47:57] little leaf now?" And uh I said, "Now
[48:00] the reason that leaf falls off is
[48:02] because the sap goes down into the root.
[48:04] And what if that sap stayed up in the
[48:06] tree through the winter time? What would
[48:07] happen?" Said, "It would kill the tree."
[48:09] Well, I said, "Now, what intelligence
[48:13] that runs that sap down into the roots?"
[48:15] Says, "Get out of here now. It's coming
[48:16] to fall the year. Get down in the roots
[48:18] and hide and stay down into the roots
[48:20] like a grave." And then next spring
[48:22] comes back up again, brings up more
[48:24] apples and brings up more leaves and
[48:26] things. He said, "That's just nature.
[48:28] It'll do it." Said, "The weather, the
[48:30] changing and all coming on fall." I
[48:32] said, "Set a bucket of water on the post
[48:33] out there and see if nature runs it down
[48:35] the bottom of the post and brings it
[48:36] back up again."
[48:40] Well, he said, "You might have
[48:41] something." I said, "Think of it while
[48:43] we go hunting." And he said, "Uh, well,"
[48:46] he said, "Hunt where you want to." And I
[48:48] said, "When I come back, if you'll tell
[48:50] me what intelligence
[48:52] runs that sap out of that tree down into
[48:56] the roots to stay all winter and come
[48:58] back the next winter, I'll tell you
[49:00] that's the same intelligence that told
[49:01] me about that woman up there." Said,
[49:03] "Told you." I said, "Yes, sir."
[49:07] He said, "You're not that preacher." I
[49:09] said, "Would you know his name?" He
[49:10] said, "Yes." I said, "Brandom?" He said,
[49:12] "That's him." I said, "That's right."
[49:15] And you know what? uh led the old man to
[49:18] Christ right there on his own testimony.
[49:20] And a year later, I was down there and
[49:23] pulled a car, Indiana license zone, in
[49:25] the yard. They had moved away. He had
[49:26] died. And so when I come back, there
[49:29] stood his wife to really rake me over. I
[49:32] thought I had permission to hunt. And
[49:34] she come out there. She said, "Can't you
[49:35] read?" I said, "Yes, ma'am." She said,
[49:38] "Did you see those signs saying no
[49:39] hunting?" I said, "Yes, ma'am." But I
[49:41] said, "I I have permission." You do not
[49:44] have permission. he said and said, "We
[49:46] got this p place posted for many years."
[49:48] I said, "Well, sister, I I was wrong and
[49:51] I'm sorry." He said, "Sorry, nothing.
[49:53] Them Indiana licensed on there set up
[49:55] here. You're the boldest people." I
[49:57] said, "Could I just explain it?" I said,
[49:59] "Uh," she said, "Who gave you
[50:00] permission?" I said, "I don't know.
[50:02] Just" I said, "It was an elderly man
[50:05] sitting out on a porch when I was down
[50:07] here last year. We was talking about
[50:09] God." See, and she looked, she said,
[50:12] "Are you brother Brandon?" And I said,
[50:14] "Yes, ma'am." She said, "Forgive me. I
[50:17] didn't know who you were." She said, "I
[50:19] want to tell you his testimony. In his
[50:21] last dying hours, he raised up his hands
[50:23] and praised God." Said, "He died in
[50:26] Christian faith and was carried away to
[50:28] God."
[50:28] &gt;&gt; See, if they hold their peace, the rocks
[50:31] will immediately cry out. There's
[50:33] something in nature.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; That's Romans chapter one.
[50:42] They know it. The heavens declare it's
[50:45] right there. And the Lord caught this
[50:48] old man. One year later, he was gone.
[50:52] But the Lord had his hand over his life.
[50:55] Isn't that nice?
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll do it. And there's power. I
[50:59] just love the faith of Dr. Roy Davis to
[51:02] drink that poison like that. So, God
[51:05] bless you. Let's stand and let's sing
[51:07] Only Believe as we go to this tape, Thy
[51:11] House, a portion of that tape. And I
[51:13] know it'll be a blessing to you. Amen.
[51:20] Only
[51:21] believe,
[51:25] only
[51:27] believe
[51:30] that all things are possible.
[51:36] Holy
[51:38] beings.
[51:42] Only
[51:49] believe.
[51:53] All things are possible
[51:58] only.
[52:03] God bless you. You may be seated.
[52:04] Brother Brandham is preaching in the
[52:06] home there in Georgia. God bless you.
[52:18] Beg your pardon. That's not just where I
[52:20] wanted
[52:23] this where I wanted to start reading it.
[52:29] this I was reading a spot in here just
[52:37] get it just in a moment
[52:41] here we are it's 29th verse 28th verse
[52:45] again but Paul cried with a loud voice
[52:48] and said do thyself no harm for we are
[52:53] all here and they called for a light
[52:57] spring in and came trembling and fell
[53:02] down before Paul and Silas
[53:05] and besaw and brought them out and said,
[53:09] "Sers, what must I do to be saved?"
[53:13] They said unto him, "Believe on the Lord
[53:15] Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and
[53:18] thy house."
[53:22] It's just one of these little twisting
[53:24] questions that I thought that I would
[53:27] like to speak of just a minute um about
[53:31] thy house being I see you each one so
[53:35] nicely have your house set in order your
[53:38] your children saved and and uh uh that's
[53:43] that's nice to have your family all
[53:46] Christians because uh we we own our
[53:50] families. We each want to think of our
[53:51] children and I certainly can command you
[53:55] a fine people down here of your lovely
[53:59] uh children. How you have them all in
[54:01] order and everything like that. Uh how
[54:04] do you do sister? Now I believe this is
[54:06] wasn't that mother just come in back
[54:08] there. The Lord bless you. I'm glad to
[54:10] see you again tonight. And I believe
[54:12] this is brother Willy's wife. Isn't that
[54:13] right? That's the boss of the family
[54:15] right there as I understand. Or that's
[54:17] way it goes at our house.
[54:19] and to have your house. Now Paul said
[54:23] here to um to this uh Roman centurion
[54:28] uh when he was we find out that Paul had
[54:32] been beaten the evening before command
[54:35] commanded by the magistrates and had
[54:36] been beaten because that uh he had done
[54:39] nothing evil. He'd been up there
[54:41] preaching the gospel and the clergy
[54:44] there had it against Paul of course he
[54:46] preached the gospel and they said this
[54:47] turning the world upside down and um he
[54:50] went down the street there's a little
[54:52] fortune teller a woman with a a spirit
[54:56] of fortune telling and uh she was hard
[54:59] to tell these fortunes and when they
[55:01] were going down the street she cry after
[55:03] Paul and say they're a man of God who
[55:05] tell us the way of of life and Paul
[55:09] didn't need the devil to assist him in
[55:11] anything. So he just turned around and
[55:12] rebuked that spirit and the woman and
[55:14] when it did, oh that caused an uproar.
[55:17] And when they found out the the spirit
[55:20] had left her and she could not tell no
[55:22] more fortunes. So the the one that had
[55:24] her hired out there and was probably
[55:26] taking care of her. Why? It caused a
[55:28] great uproar and they were beaten and
[55:30] put into jail. And I can imagine Paul
[55:32] and Silas laying back in that old buggy
[55:35] jail on the inner courts way back. The
[55:38] outside where the best prisoners was
[55:40] kept was bad enough, but they was on the
[55:42] inside and when they went way back this
[55:44] putting stocks. I don't know. Would
[55:46] y'all ever see stocks? I've had the
[55:48] privilege of seeing them. They they put
[55:50] them in your across your feet. Then they
[55:52] put them across your hands, then put
[55:54] them across your neck. And there you are
[55:56] sitting there. And the Chinese capsule
[55:59] punishment the way they used to is very
[56:01] cruel. They put them in those stocks and
[56:03] put a drip of water, just one drip at a
[56:05] time, falling on top their head like
[56:07] that until it just drove them insane.
[56:09] They'd sat there and give them nothing
[56:11] to eat or drink like that. Their her
[56:13] eyes would turn and everything and just
[56:15] horrible thing. They say the first few
[56:18] drops, of course, for maybe the first
[56:19] day it isn't so bad. But they say after
[56:22] a few days that those drops like 50 tons
[56:25] falling over time hit right in that same
[56:27] spot because you can't move your head.
[56:29] You're in those stocks. And just think
[56:31] that Paul and Silas for preaching the
[56:33] gospel was laying back in that old dirty
[56:36] place and probably rats and mice, bugs
[56:39] on them and everything. What a place for
[56:42] a man preaching the gospel. And we think
[56:44] today that we complain because we had
[56:46] things a little hard. Look what they
[56:48] did. and knowing what was waiting and
[56:50] perhaps execution the next morning. But
[56:54] they were faithful. They they were they
[56:57] stayed faithful and long about midnight
[56:59] in there. And I can just think of how
[57:03] they must have felt their backs sticking
[57:05] to the old dirt were prisoners and there
[57:08] leprosy and everything else in them days
[57:11] and laying against the old hard floor.
[57:13] Might have been a dirt floor, rats
[57:15] running over them. But in the midst of
[57:17] all of that, perhaps no supper and
[57:20] beaten till there was bleeding and
[57:21] bruised and sore and no doctor to wash
[57:25] out the wounds or anything for infection
[57:27] that we'd use today or something like
[57:29] that. Just throw them back there and put
[57:30] them in the stocks and put them in that
[57:33] condition. But they wasn't complaining.
[57:35] Not one word of complaint came from
[57:37] them. and knowing maybe the next morning
[57:39] they the magistrates would probably uh
[57:42] call them before the emperor and when
[57:44] they did or the Sanhedrin and they'd be
[57:47] executed for preaching this heresy that
[57:49] was called in them days the gospel that
[57:51] we truly earnestly contend for that same
[57:54] faith today and um then when we go to
[57:58] thinking about that then the miles gets
[57:59] a little shorter between one another you
[58:01] see each time we go to think about it
[58:03] and um then we uh find out that along
[58:06] about midnight Right. Uh Paul and Silas
[58:10] uh must have talked about the Lord until
[58:12] about midnight. And then they begin to
[58:14] sing hymns, some good old Christian
[58:17] song. Oh, if we'd sing today, we'd sing
[58:20] there's power in the blood or Oh, how I
[58:22] love Jesus or something like that. And
[58:24] when they begin to sing, all of a sudden
[58:27] an earthquake struck the place. And
[58:30] notice how done instead of piling those
[58:32] walls of that big old building right in
[58:34] on top of them and them and mashing them
[58:36] to death, it shook the walls away from
[58:39] them. And not only that, but it it it
[58:41] broke the stocks and bars loose from
[58:43] them and they were set free. I think
[58:46] over their feet, over their hands, and
[58:48] over their neck. They were set free.
[58:50] Every one of them. And instead of that
[58:52] big old heavy Roman prison breaking in
[58:54] on them, it fell away from them like
[58:56] this. And not only that, but the
[58:57] shackles and things fell off of them.
[58:59] See, that's our God when we hold out
[59:01] faithful. See, we must stay faithful as
[59:04] long as we're faithful. And you know, we
[59:06] not we may not be in that kind of a
[59:08] shape. We none of us may get I hope we
[59:09] don't get like that, but we can be
[59:11] faithful in what we got to what we have
[59:13] to go through with. Maybe it's a
[59:15] persecution. Maybe it's somebody laughs
[59:17] at you. Maybe somebody says you're old
[59:19] time, you're holy roller or whatever
[59:21] they might want to call you or make fun
[59:23] of you or something. Let's be faithful
[59:25] just the same because God respects our
[59:27] faithfulness to that just the same as he
[59:29] was respect their faithfulness to what
[59:32] they were they had to go through with.
[59:34] And then all of a sudden when the Roman
[59:36] prisoner, the centurion must uh must uh
[59:40] the guard at the door, he must have
[59:44] thought that that night when Paul and
[59:46] Silas are talking on scripture, he must
[59:48] have learned something because he didn't
[59:50] know the man. But he must have knowed
[59:52] some way or heard their singing or
[59:54] something that caused him to know right
[59:56] quick that they were holy man. Because
[1:00:00] you see that he was a Roman and they
[1:00:02] were Jews and he was a pagan and they
[1:00:06] were Christians. But did you notice as
[1:00:09] soon as he found out that there was that
[1:00:12] the prison had been shut down and he
[1:00:14] noted he'd have to answer for that
[1:00:16] century. You remember the time of Elijah
[1:00:19] when he had himself disguised and met
[1:00:22] King Ahab out there and said I was a
[1:00:24] sentry and my life of course was staked
[1:00:27] with the man and he got away and and he
[1:00:30] said well you pay for it then with your
[1:00:31] life that's the duty of a sentry. So he
[1:00:34] unwrapped himself and said he was Elijah
[1:00:37] the prophet and said you let it the king
[1:00:40] go a and said you you'll pay with it
[1:00:43] with your own life and he did do it. So
[1:00:46] then uh we find out that this Roman
[1:00:48] centurion knowing that he had answered
[1:00:49] with his own life for these he pulled
[1:00:52] out his sword as soon as he found out he
[1:00:53] gone and started to kill himself take
[1:00:56] his own life instead of have to go
[1:00:57] through punishment some of the maybe
[1:00:59] setting them same kind of stocks and so
[1:01:01] forth until he died. So he thought he
[1:01:03] just end it all up and jerk out his
[1:01:05] sword and kill himself. But quickly Paul
[1:01:07] screamed out when he saw it and said do
[1:01:10] yourself no harm for we're all here.
[1:01:13] See, and the man realized then that
[1:01:16] there must have been something taken
[1:01:19] place before that that made this man to
[1:01:22] know that they were Christian men or
[1:01:24] holy men because quickly he fell down at
[1:01:27] their feet. I'd imagine he heard them
[1:01:29] singing songs. He heard them testifying.
[1:01:32] He heard their conversation. Now, let's
[1:01:34] just think a minute, folks. If that
[1:01:36] Roman centurion was convinced and
[1:01:39] convicted because that he heard them two
[1:01:41] men beaten prisoners. Now we still free
[1:01:46] and we're not beat or prisoners. But
[1:01:48] here in their testimony had such an
[1:01:50] influence till it caused him to say,
[1:01:52] "What must I do to be saved?" Then what
[1:01:54] are we to do with our influence? See, we
[1:01:57] should be testifying.
[1:01:59] You young people, whatever it is, you
[1:02:01] may not preach. Maybe God never called
[1:02:03] you to preach, but you if you're a
[1:02:05] housewife or whatever you are, teenager,
[1:02:08] let's do something, you know, that and
[1:02:10] live a life that makes the people say,
[1:02:12] "Well, that that's a Christian going
[1:02:13] there. That that's a Christian." And um
[1:02:16] so we find that this fellow must have
[1:02:18] been impressed some way for them songs
[1:02:21] or whatever they were doing in there to
[1:02:22] realize they were Christians. So, um, he
[1:02:25] got a light and when he come in and seen
[1:02:27] that there stood Paul, even the
[1:02:29] prisoners back in there, none of them
[1:02:31] was trying to get away. Everybody was
[1:02:33] there. So, he he put up his sword and
[1:02:36] fell down by the feet of Paul and Silas
[1:02:38] and said, "Sers, what must I do to be
[1:02:41] saved?" Now,
[1:02:45] did you notice you and I today and most
[1:02:47] all ministers or so forth, we're always
[1:02:50] trying to tell a fellow what not to do?
[1:02:52] We'd say, "Now, quit your smoking. Quit
[1:02:54] your lying. Quit your stealing. Quit
[1:02:57] your this or that." Now, that that
[1:02:59] wasn't what the man asked. He he didn't
[1:03:01] say, "What I have to quit doing to be
[1:03:03] saved." He said, "What must I do to be
[1:03:05] saved?" See, we try to tell them what
[1:03:07] they must stop doing. See, and say,
[1:03:09] "Well, I must uh do this, that, or the
[1:03:11] other." No. See, that is the question.
[1:03:14] What must I do, not what must I stop
[1:03:16] doing? But you just do what you're
[1:03:18] supposed to do, and all the rest of it
[1:03:20] will take care of itself. you're lying,
[1:03:22] stealing or or drinking, gambling, and
[1:03:26] doing the things that's evil. It'll stop
[1:03:27] when you do what Paul answered his
[1:03:30] question. What must I do to be saved? He
[1:03:32] said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:03:36] And thy and thy house shall be saved."
[1:03:39] The reason I thought about saying this
[1:03:41] because you people here, most of you,
[1:03:45] your your children are saved. See,
[1:03:47] they're Christians. I've admired brother
[1:03:50] Evans family, these young men here.
[1:03:53] Usually, who would you get a teenager
[1:03:54] sit around listening to someone preacher
[1:03:56] talk? Well, they'd be out and gone
[1:03:58] somewhere. Little girls like that. I
[1:04:00] said to Brother Fred, his kids, why they
[1:04:03] they can just hear me say one thing,
[1:04:05] it's wrong. They're ready to stop it
[1:04:07] right now. You see, and set with the
[1:04:08] highest respect instead of being out hot
[1:04:11] rodding, rambling around, they'll when
[1:04:13] they hear you speak about the gospel,
[1:04:14] they're ready to sit right there and
[1:04:16] listen. See, now I know we all want
[1:04:18] think our kids as renegades and things
[1:04:20] like that, but we we must stop that. I I
[1:04:23] believe it. We must remember that these
[1:04:25] kids are the best kids in the world
[1:04:27] because they're our children and we
[1:04:29] claim them for God. Now, your salvation
[1:04:32] will not save that child. But now Paul
[1:04:35] said said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:04:38] Christ and thy and thy house shall be
[1:04:41] saved." Now he Now what did he mean by
[1:04:44] that? He didn't mean that because they
[1:04:46] were saved that their house would be
[1:04:48] saved with it. He meant this that
[1:04:50] because they were if he had enough faith
[1:04:53] to be saved himself, his same amount of
[1:04:55] faith that he had for himself would work
[1:04:57] for his children. See what I mean? Now
[1:05:00] I've got my children. There's my little
[1:05:02] son, Joseph, Billy, Sarah, Rebecca.
[1:05:07] Well, now I want to see each one of them
[1:05:09] a worker in the gospel doing something.
[1:05:11] I want to see them saved and filled with
[1:05:13] the Holy Ghost. Now, I've committed them
[1:05:15] to God and say, "I'm holding on to God
[1:05:17] for them." See, and I believe they're
[1:05:20] going to be saved, every one of them.
[1:05:21] See, I believe they're going to be saved
[1:05:23] and I'll have them on the other side.
[1:05:26] And uh I don't believe my salvation will
[1:05:28] save them. No, but my faith in God will
[1:05:32] do it. You see, my faith believing God
[1:05:34] will do it and cause them to come to
[1:05:37] Christ. And I believe that's where you
[1:05:39] people praying for your children. And
[1:05:41] that's reason your children has the the
[1:05:43] manners and the and the real lady and
[1:05:46] gentleman in this uh wild age that we're
[1:05:49] living in. Yet they have that that part
[1:05:52] about them. It's the best I know of any
[1:05:54] kids. See? Well, I think the reason of
[1:05:57] that is because that your prayers for
[1:05:59] them and you've committed them to God
[1:06:01] and holding on. See now the Romans said,
[1:06:03] uh, "What must I do?" He just asked for
[1:06:05] himself. He said, "What must I And he
[1:06:07] said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:09] and thou and thy house shall be saved."
[1:06:12] See, now,
[1:06:14] now we got one thing to do. Let's drop
[1:06:16] back just a minute to get something to
[1:06:19] drive in on my text. Now, it's this.
[1:06:22] Let's take an old man that I know of in
[1:06:24] the Bible by the name of Job. Job was a
[1:06:27] great man. There was nobody like him in
[1:06:29] his days. Job was a prophet. And uh
[1:06:32] people come from far and near to hear
[1:06:34] Job. And God blessed him and he is he
[1:06:36] prospered. He was a rich man. Oh, he had
[1:06:39] thousands ahead of cattle and sheep and
[1:06:41] and the things that he had. And uh while
[1:06:44] he said when he would go out into the
[1:06:46] streets, the young princes from the
[1:06:48] east, that's the magis, the wise
[1:06:50] astronomers, you know, everything said
[1:06:52] they would bow before him just to ask
[1:06:54] the word of his wisdom. See, he was a
[1:06:57] smart man. He's a prophet. And um so uh
[1:07:01] the devil looked down and he saw that
[1:07:03] that Job was a smart man. So uh I show
[1:07:06] you how a smart man does. Now coming
[1:07:09] back to the text in our house. Job said
[1:07:12] when he seen everything was just in good
[1:07:14] order like your homes are now. He said
[1:07:16] you know my children's married and gone
[1:07:18] off but said maybe one of what
[1:07:22] prevention one of my sinned. Now there's
[1:07:24] one requirement God had that was a burnt
[1:07:27] offering. He said, "Now, I don't," he
[1:07:29] didn't believe his children sin, but
[1:07:31] said, "Preventure, they might sin
[1:07:33] because they're visiting one another and
[1:07:35] going to the parties at one another's
[1:07:36] homes and so forth and mixing up, I
[1:07:38] guess, and so forth." He said, "If one
[1:07:40] of them has sinned, so Lord, I bring a
[1:07:43] burnt offering and offer this burnt
[1:07:45] offering for my child." See, and that's
[1:07:48] all he know to do. That's all God
[1:07:50] required, a burnt offering. That's what
[1:07:52] all he required. Well, then when the
[1:07:54] great midnight hour come and struck and
[1:07:56] poor old Job was in the condition he
[1:07:59] was, he, you know, he lost all his
[1:08:00] cattle, all his sheep, and the storms
[1:08:02] come and kill his children, fire burn up
[1:08:04] his servants and and he broke his own
[1:08:07] health failed and he sat in the backyard
[1:08:09] on an ash heap and and his own body
[1:08:12] broke out with borrows till he took a
[1:08:14] piece of croc and scraped his borrows
[1:08:16] and even his wife got discouraged with
[1:08:19] him and come and said, "Job, let let's
[1:08:21] just kind of think the way she head. Now
[1:08:24] look, there sets Job sat out there all
[1:08:26] night. There sets the uh his consolers
[1:08:30] with their back turned to him and
[1:08:31] they've told him he's sin. That's the
[1:08:33] church members. That's the the deacon
[1:08:35] board or whatever it is of the church.
[1:08:37] Come down to see him. And uh they set
[1:08:39] seven days there and still tell him Job,
[1:08:41] you might as well make a confession
[1:08:43] because you have sinned. Because God
[1:08:46] wouldn't let a righteous man be
[1:08:47] tormented like that. But God does let a
[1:08:50] righteous man be tormented like that.
[1:08:52] See, God sometimes it things happen to
[1:08:55] us because we sin, but sometimes it it's
[1:08:59] testing a saint instead of chastising a
[1:09:01] sinner. So, we find out that Job was a
[1:09:04] righteous man. And when God was testing
[1:09:05] him because Satan said, "Oh, sure." When
[1:09:09] he come up before God with the sons of
[1:09:10] God, he said, God said to him, "Where
[1:09:13] you been?" He said, "Oh, just walking to
[1:09:14] and fro and up and down the earth."
[1:09:16] Said, "You consider my servant Job? He's
[1:09:18] a perfect man. There's nobody in the
[1:09:19] earth like him." God was pleased with
[1:09:22] that. Oh, he just loves to have a
[1:09:24] servant that he can trust in. He said
[1:09:26] there's not another man on earth like
[1:09:28] him. See, said he's a perfect man. And
[1:09:30] that was before the blood of Jesus
[1:09:32] Christ was shed. See? And he said, uh,
[1:09:35] he's a perfect man. He's just, he's
[1:09:37] upright. There's none like him. Satan
[1:09:39] said, "Oh, sure. Look what you've done
[1:09:41] for him. You give him everything. He's
[1:09:43] got homes. He's got children. He's got
[1:09:45] cattle. He's got everything he wants.
[1:09:47] Sure, anybody could serve you like
[1:09:48] that." Said, "Let me have him one time.
[1:09:50] I'll make him curse you to your face. He
[1:09:53] said, "Satan, he's in your hand, but
[1:09:54] don't you take his life." Now, that was
[1:09:56] God's trust that his prophet would not
[1:09:58] fail him.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; See, and he's trusting you and I that we
[1:10:02] won't fail him.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; And then he and he said, "Don't you take
[1:10:05] his life." And Satan done everything but
[1:10:07] take his life. His children got killed
[1:10:10] and his cattle killed and everything is
[1:10:13] all his riches was lost and he lost his
[1:10:15] health and everything but his life. sat
[1:10:17] out there and scraped his barrels and
[1:10:19] his wife come the door and and Satan got
[1:10:23] in her and said uh thou looked out there
[1:10:26] and said why don't you curse God and die
[1:10:29] said you look so miserable he said thou
[1:10:32] speakest like the foolish woman see now
[1:10:35] he's never said she is foolish said she
[1:10:37] talk like one see said you speak like a
[1:10:39] foolish woman said the Lord gave and the
[1:10:42] Lord taken away blessed be the name of
[1:10:44] the Lord see in other words naked came I
[1:10:47] in the He said, "Naked I'll return, but
[1:10:49] blessed be the name of the Lord."
[1:10:51] Anyhow, I never had nothing when I come
[1:10:52] here and I'll go away with nothing, but
[1:10:54] still blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:10:56] Oh my, you know, God will just let Satan
[1:10:59] tempt us so long and then he gets tired
[1:11:01] of it, you see. So, he seen he Satan had
[1:11:04] to leave him, man. But, uh, Benadrad and
[1:11:07] all of them still stayed there and said,
[1:11:08] "Well, you're a sacred sinner." But, Job
[1:11:11] stayed pat on this. I am not a sinner.
[1:11:15] See, Job, you you done you don't want to
[1:11:18] confess it. See, because you're a secret
[1:11:20] sinner. You're doing it secretly and
[1:11:22] God's punishing you for it. So, that's
[1:11:24] the reason that the things you're going
[1:11:25] for the way they are. But he said, "No,
[1:11:27] sir. I'm not a sinner." Because he was
[1:11:29] standing pat upon that righteousness of
[1:11:33] God, that burnt sacrifice. He had
[1:11:35] offered it. That's all he had to offer.
[1:11:37] That's all God required. And did you
[1:11:39] notice as the spirit of God come on the
[1:11:42] prophet and everything got all right?
[1:11:45] You see God restored back to Jobot, he
[1:11:48] restored back to him his where he had
[1:11:50] 10,000 cattle, he gave him 20,000
[1:11:52] cattle. Where he had 40,000 sheep, he
[1:11:55] gave him 80,000 sheep. See, and he
[1:11:57] restored everything back to him that he
[1:12:00] ever had. And you notice it said, "And
[1:12:02] he restored his seven children."
[1:12:06] See, he gave Job his seven children.
[1:12:10] Not didn't give him seven other
[1:12:12] children,
[1:12:14] but he gave Job his seven children.
[1:12:17] Now, what was it? His house.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Thy and thy house. Because he was
[1:12:23] righteous because he was standing on
[1:12:25] everything that God gave us to be
[1:12:28] righteous or gave him was to offer that
[1:12:30] burnt offering. And he knowed that that
[1:12:32] was God's word and he could not fail. So
[1:12:35] did you ever think where them children
[1:12:36] was? There's in heaven waiting for him.
[1:12:39] See, he's with him today. And God saved
[1:12:42] Job's children. They were in heaven
[1:12:45] waiting for him. See, now if Job took a
[1:12:49] act upon the very thing that God told
[1:12:52] him to do, the only thing it was to be
[1:12:53] righteous was to offer a burnt offering
[1:12:57] that was righteous. And he saved Job and
[1:13:00] his house. And what is righteous before
[1:13:02] God? Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:05] and thy and thy house shall be saved. So
[1:13:07] if I'm believing for my house and you're
[1:13:09] believing for your house by believing
[1:13:12] that that we trust God, God imputes our
[1:13:15] own faith like he did Abraham or Job or
[1:13:17] any of them for righteousness. You see,
[1:13:19] so it's allotted to us for righteousness
[1:13:21] and that's how that thou and thy
[1:13:24] household shall be saved. Oh, I think
[1:13:27] it's a wonderful thing. So then, not
[1:13:29] only that, but I'm holding for every
[1:13:30] brother, all my brothers, my sister. I'm
[1:13:34] not only holding for that, but I'm
[1:13:35] holding for every person that's in my
[1:13:37] church. I'm holding for you all. I want
[1:13:40] you to hold for me because of the
[1:13:42] righteousness of faith. We don't have to
[1:13:44] make a burnt offering. Christ is our
[1:13:45] offering. But we have to have faith in
[1:13:48] that offering that Christ made that he
[1:13:52] made us this kind of a a promise that
[1:13:55] whatever you ask the father in my name
[1:13:58] that I'll do when thou prayest believe
[1:14:01] that you receive what you've asked for
[1:14:03] and you shall have it.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Now if I'm praying that God will save
[1:14:07] these teenage children and I believe
[1:14:09] with all my heart he'll do it. See
[1:14:11] that's the same way Job stood say oh
[1:14:14] look at this kid how he's doing. I don't
[1:14:16] care what he's doing or what she's
[1:14:17] doing, I still have put that child in
[1:14:21] the hand of Almighty God and my me and
[1:14:24] my house shall be saved. See, because I
[1:14:27] even though I may pass on before they
[1:14:28] do, but somehow before they leave here,
[1:14:31] God will twist them right down on the
[1:14:32] trail. I I believe that somehow another
[1:14:34] he'll make it so miserable for them till
[1:14:36] they have to do it. See, and um that's
[1:14:39] why I believe it's thou and thy house
[1:14:42] shall be saved. I've seen a many that I
[1:14:44] watched that come into my meetings many
[1:14:46] time old boy come up there it's been
[1:14:48] rough all his life he fall down on his
[1:14:50] knees and go to cry and get up say I had
[1:14:51] a dear old mother oh if she's in heaven
[1:14:54] tonight I know she looking down and she
[1:14:56] is glad to see me at this altar see what
[1:14:59] is that old mother prayed and believe
[1:15:01] see she's gone all long but here's
[1:15:03] prayers because the righteousness see
[1:15:05] thy and thy house shall be saved God
[1:15:08] knows how to work he knows how to do he
[1:15:10] knows how to do everything just
[1:15:12] As I said the other day, when we are
[1:15:14] born of the spirit of God, God isn't
[1:15:17] weak in one place and strong in another.
[1:15:19] If you've got little shadow of God in
[1:15:21] you, just a little speck of God, then
[1:15:24] you've got all power. You got enough
[1:15:26] power in you to make a world and go out
[1:15:28] and live in it. But of course, that
[1:15:29] power is controlled by faith. If it
[1:15:32] wasn't, we'd all have us a world out
[1:15:33] there living in it. But if you're a son
[1:15:36] of God or a daughter of God, you got the
[1:15:38] power of God in you. See? So then you um
[1:15:43] that law holds that faith to a certain
[1:15:46] thing. Now let's take for instance all
[1:15:48] of us. We say we once lied. We'd steal.
[1:15:50] We' would uh curse and swear and do
[1:15:54] everything that's wrong. Well, one day
[1:15:55] when we accepted Christ, what did he do?
[1:15:58] He opened up. As soon as we accepted
[1:16:00] him, that's a faith just like Paul told
[1:16:02] the Roman to have. Believe. Just exactly
[1:16:04] what Job did. Believe. See? And as soon
[1:16:07] as we accepted Christ as our savior,
[1:16:10] immediately we received enough faith
[1:16:12] that we walked away. No more lying, no
[1:16:15] more stealing,
[1:16:17] no more cheating. See? No. Why? We rode
[1:16:22] right up above that sin that we used to
[1:16:24] ride in there. We we slotted that much
[1:16:26] faith. Why? Because that we believe that
[1:16:28] we are saved. Is that right? We believe
[1:16:30] here that we are saved. So then we ride
[1:16:33] up above that because we believe we are
[1:16:35] saved. Now listen to this. Just before I
[1:16:37] get to the questions, see brother,
[1:16:40] sister, I'm going to give you a little
[1:16:42] secret on myself.
[1:16:44] I guess you've often wondered how I see
[1:16:45] those visions and things. What makes it?
[1:16:48] It's because when he met me that night
[1:16:50] and told me that see this what happened.
[1:16:54] I believe it. I solemnly believe it. And
[1:16:58] I go in to pray for the sick. If I can
[1:17:00] ever get a feeling that something's
[1:17:02] fixing to happen, they're fixing to get
[1:17:04] well. It's always just about right. And
[1:17:07] that's the way we must do with our
[1:17:08] family, with anything that we ask for,
[1:17:10] we must pray. And God respects faith.
[1:17:12] You see, to believe it, we must believe
[1:17:14] that it is right. Now, with that little
[1:17:17] bit of God, when you said, "Yes, Lord
[1:17:20] Jesus, I'm a sinner. I'm not worthy of
[1:17:22] your love, but you did love me, so I
[1:17:24] accept you as my savior." Immediately,
[1:17:27] you walk right out of there. And what is
[1:17:28] it? You stop your lying. You stop
[1:17:32] cheating. You stop stealing. You stop
[1:17:35] doing things that you ought to do. Why?
[1:17:37] Because you believe that you are a
[1:17:39] Christian. And because you believe
[1:17:41] you're a Christian, you rise up from
[1:17:42] that. You to another level. Now, see,
[1:17:44] now if you're sick, here's healing. You
[1:17:47] just believe it. Now, you can't make
[1:17:48] yourself believe it. It's got to be
[1:17:50] something happened to you. Just like
[1:17:51] your conversion, it's got to happen. I
[1:17:53] tell my wife the other day how much I
[1:17:55] loved her.
[1:17:57] So, u I don't guess she wants me to talk
[1:17:59] about this, but uh I do it in private,
[1:18:02] so I guess I can do it in public right
[1:18:04] now. I tell her how much I loved her and
[1:18:07] how I always have loved her since the
[1:18:10] first beginning. I said, "It no make any
[1:18:12] difference." She said, "Oh, Bill," she
[1:18:14] said, "How talk about how fat she's
[1:18:16] getting her hair turned gray?" I said,
[1:18:17] "Honey, you could be that wide and no
[1:18:20] hair. I'd still love you just the same."
[1:18:22] See, because it has to be something
[1:18:24] there that you have to has you have to
[1:18:27] meet that you love somebody and unless
[1:18:30] that person loves that other person.
[1:18:33] This is for you young girls that's not
[1:18:35] married. See, and you boys when you meet
[1:18:37] that girl that you love and it's just
[1:18:39] something you know you love her and
[1:18:41] that's just all there is to it. Or you
[1:18:42] love him and that you don't care whether
[1:18:44] he's handsome or whether he's not
[1:18:46] handsome or whether she's pretty or not
[1:18:48] pretty. That doesn't matter. But you
[1:18:49] love him just the same. And you better
[1:18:51] watch kind of hold around close there
[1:18:53] because that's you're getting close to
[1:18:54] home there. And I I a a marriage based
[1:18:58] outside of that is sure to fall or it'll
[1:19:01] never be successful and never be happy.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Now I said that to get around to one
[1:19:06] thing I want to say. Friends, a
[1:19:08] conversion outside of the same thing
[1:19:10] won't last either.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; It won't. When you go to church and and
[1:19:15] you say, "Well, u I'm going to join
[1:19:17] church and I'm going to be baptized." If
[1:19:20] that isn't coming from a heart of love
[1:19:22] to God the honor, it'll never go
[1:19:24] nowhere. You all you'll do is join
[1:19:26] church and be baptized. But when you're
[1:19:28] converted to Christ, a love to Christ,
[1:19:31] then you accumulate a faith in Christ
[1:19:32] like you would to your wife or to your
[1:19:34] husband. You accumulate a faith that you
[1:19:37] walk in that faith. I don't know. You
[1:19:39] just something about you. You just got
[1:19:40] to something anchors you there. You see?
[1:19:43] Well, that's the same way it is about
[1:19:44] Christ. And what Christ says, you
[1:19:46] believe it and you just stay right with
[1:19:48] it. And that's where it just raises you
[1:19:50] right up above it and God brings it to
[1:19:51] pass and fulfills his promise. If thou
[1:19:54] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, thy
[1:19:56] and thy house shall be saved. So now I
[1:19:59] just thought I'd say that now I don't
[1:20:01] took up too much of the time of it. 30
[1:20:04] minutes to say that, but you know what I
[1:20:06] mean. Now that's what it is. If you can
[1:20:08] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, not
[1:20:10] only for salvation, for yourself, for
[1:20:12] your loved one, for the healing of a the
[1:20:14] child or for a mother or for anything
[1:20:17] that you desire that's right, and you
[1:20:19] know if you desired something that
[1:20:21] wasn't right, you you wouldn't have
[1:20:22] faith enough to ask God in the first
[1:20:24] place because you know it ain't right.
[1:20:25] See, if you're sincere and know that
[1:20:27] it's right, then you can ask God with a
[1:20:29] clean heart, knowing it's no selfish
[1:20:31] motive and your objective and a motive
[1:20:33] is exactly right and ask God and like a
[1:20:35] child believe you get it and you get it.
[1:20:38] I know that I've come to Christ when I
[1:20:40] was about the age of one of these boys
[1:20:43] here. I guess I was about 20 years old
[1:20:46] and I uh I've served him all this time
[1:20:48] and I'm 52 be 53 my birthday and I can
[1:20:52] sincerely say that I have never asked
[1:20:55] Christ sincerely for anything that is
[1:20:58] it's now that really sincerely asked him
[1:21:01] anything was for right but what he gave
[1:21:03] it to me or told me why he couldn't do
[1:21:05] it and then later on I found out it's
[1:21:07] good thing I didn't get it see but just
[1:21:10] remember when you believe on him have
[1:21:12] faith in him and trust him. Don't Don't
[1:21:14] try to shove yourself to do it. Just
[1:21:16] stay with him and reason it out. Like if
[1:21:19] you if I was coming to brother Welchure
[1:21:20] to borrow $1,000,
[1:21:23] I guess I couldn't get it because he may
[1:21:24] not have it, but if he had it and I I
[1:21:27] could get it now. I'd come and try to
[1:21:29] lay the case down. I'd come say, "Welch,
[1:21:30] give me a thousand." That's no way to do
[1:21:32] it. That's a way to ask God. I'd come
[1:21:35] up. I'd take to Brother Welch. I'd say,
[1:21:36] "Could I speak to you a few minutes,
[1:21:38] Brother Welch?" "Sure, Brother Bam." go
[1:21:40] over one side, said I said, "Brother
[1:21:41] Welch, the first thing I want to ask
[1:21:43] you, do you have $1,000 that you could
[1:21:45] get a hold of for me?" Well, he he we
[1:21:49] were friends or he'd be asking me or him
[1:21:52] or one of you, brethren. It'd be the
[1:21:55] same. We'd say, "Yes." Now, here's why
[1:21:57] what I want. I'd lay down and show him.
[1:22:00] I say, "Brother Welch, I'm over here in
[1:22:02] a meeting. I'm absolutely up against it.
[1:22:05] I I got to leave the town and I'm $1,000
[1:22:07] in debt. I I just got to have the money
[1:22:10] from somewhere. The Lord put it upon my
[1:22:12] heart to come to you and I'd explain to
[1:22:14] you now now from another meeting that I
[1:22:17] had at a certain place. I've got $1,000
[1:22:19] coming in which will be about 3 months
[1:22:21] from now. I can pay you. I'll pay you
[1:22:23] interest on it if you want it. Just lay
[1:22:25] it all down and explain it to him why I
[1:22:27] don't want to leave that town like that.
[1:22:29] It's a bad thing on my name if I do
[1:22:30] that. And then they're going to say he's
[1:22:32] nothing but a cheat and steal and um and
[1:22:35] leaving the town owing money. See what I
[1:22:37] mean? I'd explain it to you, sit down
[1:22:40] like a brother and talk it over with
[1:22:41] you. Well, I believe if I do that and
[1:22:44] and you like me as you do, you you do
[1:22:48] anything, you you'd pawn an automobile
[1:22:49] or sell something out of the house to
[1:22:51] get the money. That's see you do it. Any
[1:22:53] of you would and I would for you. But it
[1:22:55] would be the the right thing to just
[1:22:56] come sit down and talk it over one
[1:22:58] another. Let let you know, you see,
[1:23:00] express our feelings to each other.
[1:23:01] You're my friend. That's the reason I
[1:23:02] come to you. Now, that's the same way it
[1:23:04] is about Christ. say, "You're my Lord. I
[1:23:07] I'm I'm sick. I The doctor says he can't
[1:23:10] do nothing for me." But but I know you
[1:23:13] can because you're my Lord. And um uh
[1:23:16] and just speak it over with him. Until
[1:23:18] you feel then that you receive it and
[1:23:21] that's your faith. Faith is the
[1:23:22] substance of things hoped for, the
[1:23:24] evidence of things not seen. And I when
[1:23:25] I feel that way, it's as good as I got
[1:23:27] it. Sure, I go ahead because I got it.
[1:23:29] See, I done he's done promised me that I
[1:23:32] got it. So that that settles it. Now I
[1:23:34] just keep on holding on waiting.
[1:23:35] Finally, first thing you know, oh, here
[1:23:36] it comes pouring down out of the
[1:23:38] quarters of heaven and you you got it.
[1:23:40] But that's it. You see, thy and thy
[1:23:42] house shall be saved. And if you don't
[1:23:44] see them all saved before you leave the
[1:23:46] earth, you'll they'll be there when you
[1:23:47] get time when the great coming, it'll be
[1:23:50] there. How you understand what I mean?
[1:23:52] See, it's by faith we do everything.
[1:23:54] Believe on the Lord. Believe on the Lord
[1:23:57] for a job. Believe on the Lord to hunt
[1:24:00] the give you the wife that you should
[1:24:02] have. Believe on the Lord to give you
[1:24:03] the husband you should marry. Believe on
[1:24:05] the Lord to send you some new furniture
[1:24:08] or if the if the barrel goes empty and
[1:24:11] the cruise gets dry and there's no food
[1:24:13] and the children are hungry. Believe on
[1:24:15] the Lord. Believe on the Lord for
[1:24:17] anything. See, as long as it's right,
[1:24:19] just believe on the Lord and I shall see
[1:24:22] it shall come. I've never seen it fail
[1:24:25] in all my life. God bless you. How about
[1:24:28] you read some of them questions for me?
[1:24:30] Could you read them for me?
[1:24:33] I I hope I get these right. I don't want
[1:24:34] to keep you too long now about maybe
[1:24:36] about 10 minutes and
[1:24:38] and um give him Jimmy a little time to
[1:24:41] study him over there and see if I and uh
[1:24:43] they're going to be ask me right blank
[1:24:45] right out. So if I can't say them well
[1:24:47] you'll understand. But you understand
[1:24:49] what it mean to believe. Believe on the
[1:24:51] Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy house
[1:24:54] shall be saved. Believe for yourself and
[1:24:57] believe for your house and you shall
[1:24:59] have it. say, "Uh, well, the doctor said
[1:25:02] I can't get well." Well, if thou can
[1:25:04] believe on the Lord, you can get well.
[1:25:08] Well, I'm out of work, but if you
[1:25:09] believe on the Lord, see, and uh you
[1:25:13] shall have work. And I don't know what
[1:25:15] to do about this situation. Believe on
[1:25:17] the Lord. Look where it sits with me
[1:25:19] right now. And why there I've always
[1:25:21] thought the Lord wanted me to leave
[1:25:22] Jeffersonville. Now, it's got to a spot.
[1:25:24] I just had to commit myself to him. So,
[1:25:26] here I am. He knows where I'm at right
[1:25:28] here tonight. So now where he wants me
[1:25:30] to go, I'll go. He wants me to do, I'll
[1:25:32] do it. And I'll be right along till he
[1:25:33] tells me. You see,
[1:25:41] Amen. Musicians, come. Let me thank God
[1:25:44] for the word tonight. Believe on the
[1:25:46] Lord even for furniture, for whatever it
[1:25:48] is, for work. Amen. Thank the Lord. You
[1:25:52] know that last little part when he says,
[1:25:54] "I'm just waiting right here." He sounds
[1:25:56] just like Brother Billy Paul.
[1:25:59] He say that whole expression sounds just
[1:26:02] like him. Amen. So we'll stand to our
[1:26:04] feet and uh we thank God for the word of
[1:26:08] the Lord that we received in this day.
[1:26:11] Thy and thy house. So I took Psalms 27
[1:26:15] and I asked the computer to personalize
[1:26:18] it for a family. And uh and it says,
[1:26:21] "The Lord is our light and our
[1:26:23] salvation. Whom shall we fear?" And it
[1:26:26] does the whole psalm that way. It was
[1:26:27] very very nice. And if you try that, I
[1:26:30] think it'll be a nice blessing for you.
[1:26:33] Brother Bannon said, "Put your name in
[1:26:35] it." And uh and you can put your family
[1:26:38] in it, too. Amen.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; So, God bless you, brother John. Why
[1:26:42] don't you come and um sing for us a
[1:26:46] little bit before we go? Amen.
[1:26:50] Lord bless you richly.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Remember our special meetings power. I'm
[1:26:55] so glad I'm a part
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; to be the sons of God. Be in prayer and
[1:27:00] continue to pray for those. Amen. Bless
[1:27:02] you. Thank you.

[1:35:52] Precious heavenly father, Lord, we're
[1:35:54] just so thankful, Lord, that we can say
[1:35:56] that we're a part of your family, Lord.
[1:35:58] We're so unworthy to be here, Lord, but
[1:36:01] oh God, your grace to us. We're so
[1:36:04] thankful, Lord, that we can be united,
[1:36:06] Lord, in in you, Lord. You you're our
[1:36:09] identification, Lord. We're baptized
[1:36:12] into your name, Lord, by by water. It
[1:36:15] was called over us. But, oh God, we were
[1:36:18] baptized into your spirit, oh God. We're
[1:36:20] identified right there, and we even bear
[1:36:22] that name,
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Lord. And when all those that are called
[1:36:26] by my name shall shall humble themselves
[1:36:30] and pray, oh God, we're so grateful that
[1:36:34] our prayers can be answered tonight in
[1:36:36] your name, Lord. That we can call out
[1:36:38] our family, Lord, in your name, Lord.
[1:36:40] and you'd said that it would never ever
[1:36:42] stop. Even if we were called off this
[1:36:44] earth, we're so grateful, Lord, that
[1:36:47] your word is true. Heavens and earth
[1:36:49] will pass away, but my word shall not
[1:36:51] fail, Lord. And that's our stand today.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; It's not because we feel it, Lord. Not
[1:36:56] because we feel like it, Father, but
[1:36:58] because your word is true, Lord. You are
[1:37:01] the word. And we're so grateful for this
[1:37:03] sevensealed message, Lord, this complete
[1:37:06] word of God in our day. We're so
[1:37:09] thankful, God, that you came down into
[1:37:11] this generation. Lord, we're so
[1:37:14] grateful, Father, with the full word of
[1:37:16] God has been displayed to us in this
[1:37:18] hour. And not just that we could look at
[1:37:20] that and worship it, Lord, but that it
[1:37:22] could become a part of us, Father, and
[1:37:25] we're identified in it, Father,
[1:37:26] ourselves, Lord. We are the message of
[1:37:29] the hour, Lord. And we just ask that you
[1:37:30] would help us, Father, to as he said,
[1:37:33] Lord, we live above it, Lord, with
[1:37:35] salvation. And we believe we're a
[1:37:37] Christian. And and then it goes on and
[1:37:39] on as we heard this morning, Lord,
[1:37:42] greater revelation comes as time goes on
[1:37:44] in the season, oh God. And this is the
[1:37:47] season and the hour for the
[1:37:49] identification of the bride of Jesus
[1:37:51] Christ, Lord. And we where we've come to
[1:37:54] a wedding, Lord. We've come to a
[1:37:56] marriage here on earth, Father. Oh, God.
[1:37:59] It's here that we're married, Lord.
[1:38:01] Married to you, Lord Jesus. The great
[1:38:03] bridegroom that's been displayed among
[1:38:05] us. Father, help us to find our place
[1:38:07] and our position. Lord, help. Help,
[1:38:10] Lord. We just ask, Father, that you
[1:38:12] would express yourself in whatever way
[1:38:14] you would have, Lord. Whatever it is,
[1:38:17] Father, in this church, Lord, these
[1:38:18] special meetings, Father, Lord, may
[1:38:21] every housewife be placed. May every lay
[1:38:24] member be placed. May every part of your
[1:38:26] body come into that position, Father.
[1:38:29] And Lord, we don't have to all carry the
[1:38:31] ball, Lord. We don't want to carry the
[1:38:33] ball, Father. Really, we just want you
[1:38:35] to be glorified. What we're asking for,
[1:38:38] Lord, is your fellowship, Lord Jesus.
[1:38:41] Just a relationship with you. To be a
[1:38:44] complete prisoner to what you would have
[1:38:46] us to do and what you would have us not
[1:38:48] to do, Father. Oh, put the brakes on us,
[1:38:51] Lord, where we need the brakes. Put the
[1:38:53] gas pedal on, Lord. We just commit our
[1:38:56] lives, Lord, into your hands, Lord. And
[1:38:58] it it might just be in our job tomorrow,
[1:39:01] Lord. At many times, you lead us,
[1:39:03] Father, and it's not the way we would
[1:39:05] think and it seems unusual. The Oh, God.
[1:39:09] Oh, Lord, the unchangeable God.
[1:39:13] Lord, in an unexpected way, so many
[1:39:16] times it comes. Father, let us to be
[1:39:18] ready, Lord, to speak to our neighbor.
[1:39:20] Let us be ready to speak to that family
[1:39:22] member. Lord, let us be eating and
[1:39:25] feeding on this word, Lord, on this food
[1:39:28] that we might have something to say,
[1:39:30] Lord. Even though we love our brothers
[1:39:32] and sisters with human love, but oh God,
[1:39:34] Lord, we would we would try to help
[1:39:36] anybody, Lord. We would try to do that.
[1:39:38] But Lord, we can't do nothing. One dying
[1:39:41] mortal to another, Father, but you can
[1:39:43] do it. So Lord, we want to give our all
[1:39:45] to you tonight. Lord, we just commit
[1:39:47] ourselves into your hands. Lord, that
[1:39:50] you might speak a word to our family
[1:39:52] member. Lord, that we might go with the
[1:39:54] token of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:39:56] Christ upon us, Lord, and speak the
[1:39:59] right word to that family member that
[1:40:01] would change them, Lord, that would do
[1:40:03] it. Father, we just commit ourselves
[1:40:05] into your hands. Forgive us, Lord, where
[1:40:07] we've got ahead of you. Forgive us,
[1:40:09] Lord, where we've lagged way behind.
[1:40:11] Father, as the brother said in his
[1:40:13] prayer, help us to wake up, Lord, and
[1:40:15] see the time and the hour we're living
[1:40:17] in, the season, Lord, of time that this
[1:40:20] is, and rise to meet that portion of the
[1:40:22] word, Lord, that we're supposed to be.
[1:40:25] Help us, Father. Lord, we we just commit
[1:40:27] our lives into your hands. Lord, we need
[1:40:29] you, Lord. We need you so much, Lord.
[1:40:33] Ask that you would be in every heart, in
[1:40:35] every life here, Father. May you go with
[1:40:38] us, Lord. Go with us, Lord. we ask in
[1:40:41] Jesus name. Amen.

[1:42:43] Let me be pleasing
[1:42:47] to you

[1:42:59] Lord to you.
[1:43:02] [Music]
[1:43:04] Pray him.
[1:43:09] Let everything
[1:43:12] I pursue
[1:43:16] be pleasing,
[1:43:20] oh Lord,
[1:43:22] unto you.
[1:43:26] How about that song? The more that I
[1:43:28] surrender, the lighter my load.
[1:43:31] The more that I release my cares, the
[1:43:33] more he takes control. The more that I
[1:43:37] surrender,
[1:43:40] the lighter
[1:43:42] my low,
[1:43:44] the more that I release my cares, the
[1:43:50] more you take control.
[1:43:54] The more that I can humble myself, the
[1:43:59] more you lift me up.
[1:44:02] Every day I hear, "Lord, I love you,
[1:44:08] Lord."
[1:44:10] Just the chorus. Yes. The more that I
[1:44:15] surrender,
[1:44:17] the lighter
[1:44:19] my Lord.
[1:44:22] The more that I release my car, the more
[1:44:27] you take control,
[1:44:31] the more that I can hold myself, the
[1:44:36] more you lift me up.
[1:44:40] Every day I live, Lord, I love you,
[1:44:45] Lord.
[1:44:50] And we'll just sing one more. and you're
[1:44:52] dismissed. But was thinking of this this
[1:44:54] morning when brother Israel was talking
[1:44:56] about the approach that we have to God
[1:44:58] and we want to end up in the holiest of
[1:45:01] holies. We we can't just start there. We
[1:45:02] have to work our way through. And so
[1:45:05] let's just sing this. That's where we
[1:45:07] all want to end up, but we've gone as
[1:45:10] far as we're going to go till we're
[1:45:11] willing to pay that greater price. And
[1:45:13] so the more that we surrender, we just
[1:45:15] sang, the more that he released my cares
[1:45:18] and but eventually Lord into the
[1:45:20] chamber. Shakina unending is what I long
[1:45:23] for.
[1:45:25] Into
[1:45:27] the chber
[1:45:30] be free. Holy
[1:45:33] Spirit,
[1:45:36] speak to me gently
[1:45:41] as I close the door.
[1:45:48] Heaven
[1:45:50] over earth
[1:45:52] let thy presence
[1:45:56] cover
[1:46:01] unending
[1:46:04] is what I long for.
[1:46:10] Father,
[1:46:13] I worship
[1:46:16] you out of my spirit,
[1:46:22] blessing
[1:46:24] and thanking
[1:46:27] you in my own way.
[1:46:33] Now your heart
[1:46:36] all covenant
[1:46:39] Lord your will
[1:46:42] and purpose
[1:46:45] so in
[1:46:47] submission
[1:46:50] I surrender
[1:46:53] this day
[1:46:56] and in
[1:46:59] the chamber
[1:47:02] be
[1:47:03] Holy
[1:47:05] Spirit,
[1:47:08] won't you speak to
[1:47:11] me gently
[1:47:14] as I close the door?
[1:47:20] Heavenly
[1:47:23] lover,
[1:47:25] let thy presence
[1:47:29] cover.
[1:47:31] Shina
[1:47:34] unending
[1:47:37] is what I long for.
[1:47:43] And now on
[1:47:46] my pathway
[1:47:49] the wine press falls heavy.
[1:47:55] But bring in
[1:47:58] forth
[1:48:00] the best of the wine.
[1:48:06] So I pressed toward
[1:48:09] the mark
[1:48:12] of the prize of high calling to be a
[1:48:18] part of that beautiful
[1:48:24] lady
[1:48:26] and bride.
[1:48:29] Go into
[1:48:32] the chamber.
[1:48:35] Be free. Holy
[1:48:38] Spirit,
[1:48:39] [Music]
[1:48:41] just speak to
[1:48:44] me gently
[1:48:47] as I close
[1:48:50] the door.
[1:48:53] Heavenly
[1:48:56] lover,
[1:48:58] let thy presence
[1:49:02] cover.
[1:49:04] Shakina

[1:49:13] long for.

[1:49:21] will praise
[1:49:23] the Lord.
[1:49:28] I
[1:49:30] will praise
[1:49:32] the Lord.
[1:49:37] No matter what tomorrow brings,
[1:49:42] what it has in store, I know I
[1:49:48] will praise
[1:49:50] the Lord.
[1:49:55] Yes, I
