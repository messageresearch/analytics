prophet of God is going to be taking the scriptures out of Numbers Chapter 19 and Ephesians chapter 5 so as we prepare our hearts to feed on the word of God Amen let's sing that old Hymn of the church

Lord I believe hallelujah hallelujah possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord Lord I believe let's remain standing for the we reading of God's word God bless you brother brandom now in numbers 199 we want to read this U uh text or this scripture rather and a man that is clean Shall Gather up the ashes of the heer and shall lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation watch now for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of Separation it is a purification for sin notice not to everybody to the congregation of the children of Israel Israel the Waters of Separation now in Ephesians the 5th chapter and beginning with the 22nd verse wi submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is in sub subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it now here's what I want to say now that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word now this little text tonight if I should call it a text and I trust that people here and also out in the telephone hookups will not disregard this and think that it's meant in a way of sacrilegious though to take a text like this it would sound sacriligious the subject that I'm using for tonight is a thinking man's filter that sound very radical for a subject for a minister that's so opposed to smoking would take a text like that a thinking man's filter it come to pass that the other morning when I went squirrel hunting if you people out on the out on the radio the air or on the telephone W could have seen the expression on this congregation's face when I announced my text You' have had a laugh out of it a thinking man's filter well it all happened up where the angels of the Lord appeared to me one morning and them squirrels was spoke into existence all of you rem when had taken place and also just at the top of the hill where I was standing before just before preaching the seven Church ages going hunting one morning before daylight there stood I thought the sun was coming up about 4:00 in the morning unusual I seen that light and I turned around and there stood the seven golden candlesticks standing up there on top of the hill with like a rain bows coming up through the pipes and feeding out immediately after that the Lord Jesus appeared to us and right then I Heard a Voice that said the Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new and there he was after a while revealed after those seven golden candlesticks then notice that how many remembers that text I wrote it on the back of a of a box of of uh cateres I had in my pocket Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new God in heaven knows that was true when I crossed that place where it appeared to me a little later on about the squirrel then when I called my good friend Jack Moore few months later to ask when I started preach the seven Church ages Revelations 1 and he was standing white all over his hair was like wool how could he being just 33 years old and be white all over and Brother Moore a very fine cultured Christian gentleman and a scholar one of the best that I know of and he said brother BR that was Jesus after his glorified condition that's the way he looks now but that didn't ring a bell with me and I kept praying until one day before I started seven Church ages I couldn't get that first chapter straightened out right how could a man 33 years old resurrected in the same body that the apostles recognized him know him to be and how could he be way up maybe an 80 or 90 years old great white wool over his face and his beard white as snow I read over in the book of the of Daniel where he came to the Ancient of Days whose hair was as white as wool and I seen that Ancient of Days he was that Ancient of Days the same yesterday today forever see it was a symbol and why the white wool and then uh the Holy Spirit seemed to speak to me about a picture I saw one time of an ancient judge then I went to the history I went back into the Bible History and all find out in the old judges like the high priest in Israel you had to have that white gray woolly like hair and beard because the white over him signified that he was supreme authority of the judges in Israel and even in today and down to a few hundred years ago maybe a couple hundred years ago or maybe not like that later than that all the English judges no matter how young they was or how old he was when they went in for judgment they wore a white wig and to show that there's no other authority in that Kingdom above their word their word is the ultimate of the Kingdom what they say that's all of it and now then I seen that there he was standing there yet young man but the white wig on he was the full supreme authority he was the word and he's having wearing the white wig then later on when we got through and the sermon and went out west and when the angels of the Lord appeared out there for the Seven Seals and it went up into the air which we had the picture of it here and around over the country there he was standing there still wigged with that supreme authority he is the head of the church he's head of the body there's nothing like him anywhere he made all things by himself he made all things for himself and without he there wasn't nothing made he has all authority in heavens and earth and everything belongs to him and in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily and the Word was God and made flesh Among Us and he was the one who revealed the entire secret of the whole Plan of Salvation all the prophets and wise men had spoke of he alone was that wigged one and supreme authority now I stopped up on the hill the other morning looked like there' been some squirrels been cutting up there and I started to sit down and i' just been there a moment when the bushes struck by me in a some great big fellow with a double barrel musket of a thing come walking out through the bushes there like scar the Daylights out of me um went on over scooted down I was afraid to move afraid to'd shoot me and the bushes moved so I just sat real still a squirrel started up over the hill and he powdered both barrels with him and so he missed him and so the squirrel went down over the hill I thought now I'll get away with all that noise that's echoing he's got his gun unloaded and I started down the hill and a guy shot right in front of me they turned me back this way and I start over here go down another way and a 22 rifle started the bullets buzzing above me I said see I'm in an awful place so I turned around and went down by the river and I thought I go down here and hide till they get done so I can get out and on the road down I have to draw my attention was drawn to look over to my right side and as I did there laid an empty cigarette package where one of them throw down and all the running of the when the squirrels were going through the bushes and I picked up this certain cigarette pack and was looked I never picked it up by bigger part and I looked down at it I didn't pick it up cu I don't like the smell of the things to begin with and I look down there and it's a a certain tobacco company that I guess I shouldn't call their name but you know what said on there a thinking man's filter and a smoking man's taste I looked at that thing and I thought a thinking man's filter I thought a man could think it all he wouldn't smoke at all how could it be a thinking man's filter a thinking man wouldn't smoke at all all right now I thought how deceiving that is now that tobacco companies are supposed to be American and all if we live to our policy we would be working to help one another if we have a feeling one for the other and how hypocritical uh uh the reason I never call the company's name I've got to say some bad things about them and how hypocritical can anybody be to make money a thinking man won't smoke at all but how are the American public fall for it they think that that's wonderful now look you cannot you cannot ask anybody s this as you you cannot have smoke without having tar if there one little speck of smoke comes to that's tar and if you don't get any smoke well you don't get any tar you don't get any anything you're just drawing against a solid stick but as long as you get any smoke at all you're drawing in cancer nicotine if you've been with me last year year before last believe wasn't the world's fair when you Brin and all of them up their own demonstration and you see him take that cigarette put it in something and pull it across a piece of marble that doctor taking a swab rolled across there and got the nicotine off of it and put it on the back of a white ratp and put him in a cage and every seven days they tucking out and the rat was so full of cancer he couldn't walk from the nicotine out of one cigarette then he said you know they say that you can get it through a filter he said you you cannot have a filter any filter that would take nicotine out takes the Smoke Out said because you have to have smoke have tar to make the smoke and it's the tar that gives the cancer and then he went pulled it through water and said sometimes you think you can filter it through that every time that you don't matter where you pull it that they say I don't inhale it they put it in your mouth and spit it out then he took that and rolled it up and put it under something here and showed it was still cancer what do you do swallow it right down your throat see and no matter what you do it's still death see and then to think that a company would deceive a man enough or try to deceive their own people it's like a vulture living off of their its own kind money making selling death to the the country and the young man and go out there on the Battlefront and die for them then turn around and sell such a thing is that under a false pretense a thinking man's filter but a smoking man's taste you'd have to have the smoke to get the taste Smoking Man taste how the people fall far they get it now it's only to deceive you more see it's of the devil they don't care for your life they ain't got no feeling for you they sell you that stuff just to watch you die as long as they get money like politics and War I don't believe in War I don't believe that we all ever should have ever had a war I believe in the great Kingdom that God bringing the great civilization that'll be brought in under his own great Dominion there will never be another War Nation won't lift up Spears against Nation there'll all be peace Eternal Peace So this kind of a civilization brings war and more civilized we get out this the more war we have one trying to be more civilized and more civilized makes more war see and look what under this civilization that a person would put out such a thing as that and the only thing it does it only deceives you to make you buy more cigarettes for if a man smokes cigarettes and I believe it is of the devil and there a nicotine Devil in a man and a woman and if one cigarette would satisfy that nicotine devil till they leave you alone and quit haunting you with one cigarette then you take a filter just that's one3 of that smoke through there then or one3 of that nicotine through there then you'll take three cigarettes that take the place of that one and you'll smoke three to one see it's only a a scheme a deceit a scheme to try to sell cigarettes they can sell more that way than they can but just let the man smoke the straight tobacco uh in his pipe or in his cigarette now see it's of the devil as I stood there looking at it and thinking of how deceitful it was a question came to me and I sto back looked at the pack again and I just seemed like something said to me but the slogan is all right a thinking man's filter a smoking man's taste it came to me that that deceitfulness also in the natural Rim there into debaca is something on the order of the churches of today see a deceitfulness has come to the whole world has become a great deception of what is really true and what's right see even in politics and in Social Affair in school in everything it becomes a deceitfulness a young fellow was telling me the other day that he was down to an army camp and a young Soldier got run over by a tank his lungs stomach or whatever was punctured and they went up to the hospital they had three or four doctors stand there in line and everybody stand in line and two or three soldiers holding their buddy up him just bar could breathe every time he breathe that rib would stick right into his lungs and make him bre bleeding inward ly and they let that young man stand there in that line way back in the back of the line and let them some of them guys with nothing but an earache or something go ahead and about the time he got up there some Colonel come in with a little child that had rash his little boy or girl had rash on his hand and he stopped that line to put the cel's child in and that boy punctured dying there you are oh if that Colonel would have been a genuine feeling for his brother out there in the line he said this kid can wait get that man up here quickly do something for him but every man wants to show his authority now they're not all like that no they're not all like that but there's too many like that there's too many of them it's like that but the man only thing he was thinking of is his own little boy that had a rash on his hand and not thinking about that poor boy standing there mashed under a tank the very tank and maybe the very boy that would save his life someday on the Battlefront they they don't stop to think only for themselves a thinking man filter I looked at it and I thought something like the the denominations of the day the churches that we had each one of them has their own filter they have their own type of filter they let just what come in they want to and what not come in what they filter in and filter out with their own kind of a filter they just let so much of the world get in to satisfy the unbelievers that's in there they'll take them in no matter what they are if they got money they'll take them in no matter what they are if they're proper but there's one thing about it you can't get in the Church of God like that not the denomination I mean the real genuine Church of God like the tobacco companies out today the people that comes into these said churches or denominations they have a taste and that taste is the classics of the world amen and each denomination has their own filter and they filter out all the true Christians that would say Amen when he was preaching and bring in all the bobbed haired painted face uh Jazzy Bells that's in the country as long as they are popular so and so comes a movie star a great person that's the kind of a filter that they use our denomination so and so the president or the the colonel or some belongs to our denomination see what kind of a filter they [Music] use that filter of course is of the world the people of the world the people they know what they want so if they have to get what they want then they'll have to have a certain kind of filter and enough of the world speak to to satisfy their worldly taste a painting man 's filter a smoking man's taste a religious world's filter and a worldly man's taste they want to be religious they think they must be religious because they have a soul when we first come to this country you found the Indian worshiping sons and so forth because why he is a human being we go back to the far jungles of Africa we find the native worshiping something why they're human beings and they what must worship so the human being no matter how Fallen he is he still knows there's something somewhere but he's got such a taste for the world that he cannot take the correct filter he has to have his onade filter each one making their own kind of filter each cigarette company Rags on theirs what they can do a real filter this is the best filter all up front and all like that I said The Taste comes or something from upfront oh for goodness sake up front what's on the back end of it oh sure ain't a thinking man or a thinking woman but that's what they say just simply deceiving the people now we find out of our day that the people has got a taste and why do do a man smoke a cigarette is to satisfy a taste what does a woman smoke a cigarette for satisfy a taste and then if the church has figuring out a religious group they to get people in there they've got to have a certain kind of a filter to give the people the taste that they want so if they don't get any taste that they want they don't want the cigarette and if they can't get the taste that they want in religion they don't take the religion now just as plain as it can be women with shorts bobbed hair painted face is sexy dressed they want that they love that as I spoke this morning and uh last Sunday morning on that wheel in the middle of the wheel or that that little inside Soul on the inside of the spirit how that the spirit on the outside between the soul and the body can be absolutely Anointed with the Holy Ghost did you all understand that now that follow that in with the continuity of the message the God of this world the anointed ones in the last days that outside that middle circle first circle is the the human senses the second circle is the spirit senses will self- will desire and so forth but the inside is the soul that Soul was predestinated so they can't anoint this Spirit to make the outside body come in subject to the spirit but the soul that's sinth that Soul shall die the soul that rejects and unbelief the word of God which it is a part of that Soul shall eternally has always I believe in an eternal death same as I believe in an eternal heaven but not an eternal hell no such a thing is eternal hell amen there is an eternal death for the people that are many of them religious in the world today has always been dead the woman that liveth in pleasure with her bobbed hair and painted face is dead while she is alive the Bible said so see she may be religious but she never was saved she's got an outward motion she might sing in the choir or she might dance in the spirit she might speak in tongues and have all the manifestations of the spirit but unless that Soul on the inside is God's daughter see she's gone matter what she does Israel is all outwardly spiritually all filled with God's goodness and how they rever God and so forth but that didn't work the inside of them couldn't recognize the word itself but when you're born of the spirit of God then you've got to you are a son of God and you always was a Son of God and you always will be a Son of God no way to separate because it's you have eternal life and eternal never did begin neither will it ever end oh for the grace of of God that he'd give us understanding of such great Mysteries as Paul spoke here further on down in Ephesians speaking of the husband and wife and said this is a mystery how the women should be in respects to their husband even the second place I believe it is in the entire Bible that reverences ever spoke to said the women seeing she reverence her husband reverence her husband that a husband ought to live such a life before his wife his wife could reverence him as a Son of God and if he doesn't live that kind of life well then course she wouldn't reverence him because she knows what he's made of but when it is a man that is reverent man reverent clean with his wife and before his family a real servant of God and the women children all should respect that servant of God with a reverence no now women they want to have bobbed hair they want to wear shorts paint makeup these little bikinis and things that that they wear now they they want to do it and yet they want to go to church you see that anointing upon the spirit not upon the soul see say wants to be a Christian and also do these things and the pastor says it's okay then if he says it's okay you can be a member your name can be on my church book here it's okay then he's given her his denominational filter to suit a worldly woman's taste she loves the world she likes the taste of it so he's got a filter for her but she's a long ways to being a thinking woman but there you are that's where I found this text no she isn't a a thinking woman if she was thinking she'd know the church isn't going to judge her at the last days the church is judging her now by her membership her loyalty to the circles that she belongs to in the societies they're judging her now by that but God's going to judge her at the day so she isn't thinking just like the man that's smoking he loves the cigarettes so well until he's thinking faculties has become numbed with nicotine and the woman's desires has so numbed her thinking faculties until she'll do these things that's evil in the sight of the Lord because she wants to do it satisfies a worldly woman's taste so she takes a worldly Church's filter she goes right through it fine nothing to bother shows now we see that if that is trth the pastor says that's all right we don't condemn the women of doing that it's all right there's no sin in it that's through his filter shows that they went through a theological filter and they got a theological taste and they had a theological taste but it certainly didn't go through God's filter no sir now if there is a theological filter for the theological thinker and there is a church filter for the church thinker a cigarette filter for the cigarette thinker there's got to be a real filter somewhere for the real thinker and God has a filter and that's his word it's a separator parts the waters the separation for sin now that's the thinking man or the holy man's taste and if a man goes through this kind of a filter of the world he he's got a worldly taste and like the tobac of company he gets more members in his church by pushing through this filter every you say there's more women goes to church and there is man that's may be so that may be also true when she can go and do anything she wants to that's right she'll she'll join up with anything but she went through that church filter if she went through God's filter she'd come out different from that see she couldn't go through God's filter and come out with bob hair she just can't do it now this is going to be a a little bitter maybe to somebody but when she started through God's filter and it says in there for them not to cut their hair then what she lodges on the other side if he said it's a sin for a woman to do such and she's dishonorable to do such if she wants she say well she's got to have her haircut so then shave it off in and said we know that that's a shame for a woman to have a head short said then let her have her head covered and her hair is her covering not a hat lady her hair is recovering the Bible says show she's a Nazarite unto the law long hair to a woman means a Naz right to the Lord now we find that that's true but we find if the thinking man socalled in the world can smoke and still get his taste he already have sense enough to know he's getting car from the tobacco but only what it's done is to selling more Mak him buy more cigarettes and the church filter gets the membership and things like that when they let him get through with anything and still belong to the church they get more members what if we went to the churches T night and filtered everybody out besides those who were genuine word born Christians there be many a blank sermon up against the wall tonight it's true because it went through the filter and if I've got one desire in my heart I hope that everybody listening to me has the same thing God take me through your filter as David said try improve me and Si or be evil in me then take it out Lord I want God's filter don't care what the world does what the church has I want to be a thinking man to think who I'm going to be standing by one of these days for judgment notice the tobacco company does it to sell more cigarettes the church does it to get more members a woman with short hair wearing shorts be caught in God filter she could not go through it with short hair because the Bible said she shouldn't do it she dishonors her head when she does it we should go but she goes right through the church all right all the rest of them I stand sometimes not disregarding anybody I never speak personally about any person but it's sin in the church you bear me record of that I didn't say Miss so and so is so and so Mr so and so Reverend so and so is so and so no sir I say Sin is Sin if it's in my family it's in me it's in whoever it is it's still sin not as an individual I don't speak against individuals I speak against sin I don't care if it's me or whoever it is starts through God's filter any sin will stop you right there notice but the woman who wants to have short hair and wear shorts or wear paint anything she can go right through a Pentecostal filter just as easy as th nothing about it right into death because he she said well there's no harm in that if you love the world are the things of the world it's because the love of God's not even in you down through the spirit thing she can pull down into her soul things that isn't of God and against God's word if that's a taste in the soul it can come through the tasty taste it can come through the think through the reasoning has no harm in it I I have taste I have feelings I have feeling that this is all right she'd come right on down through that and right into her soul if her soul is of that type shows that she isn't drawing through God filter but if she's got bobbed hair wearing makeup shorts pants looks like man's all these slacks andever what they call them saying those kind of things and doing those things and living for the world she'll stop she can't get to there no Sarah it'll stop her at the beginning notice a man looking at her pretty red lips and painted face and shorts and and bikinis and it what she's got a real thinking man won't look at her now a man that's a church member will look at her admire but I don't care how she looks to the eye a thinking man will turn his head why he's been through God F her and he knows to look upon her is adultery in his heart he don't think she's pretty say is it she a pretty thing not to him it isn't she's a filthy looking miserable Jezebel witch to a thinking man a Son of God looks up on her with shame that he even belongs to the family she belongs to that's right how could that be my sister and act like that see she pulled through one filer he comes to another he won't think she's pretty not at all that's not Beauty to a real man of God remember one time before the blood of Jesus Christ become the filters we'll get to in a few minutes the sons of God looked upon the daughters the man that they were fair and taken to them wives God never did forgive it again it happened in the march of Israel and God never did forgive and every one of them perished a thinking man's filter I come out of the meeting here there's a little Ricky standing back here behind the church one night said to me about three or four years ago said the reason you say that's you're an old man said I think they look nice I said I can imagine that for Mr looks of him you tell what he look like I said let me tell you something how old are you about 30 years old I said when I was 15 years younger than you I thought the same thing right is still filth a thinking man's filter now notice if he has been his mind filtered to the word of God God's filter he won't look up on her he won't think she's pretty he'll think she's a jezebel he'll think behind those red lips is poison things that was stain and the Bible said her Gates is the gates of hell and man walks into him like an ox going to his Slaughter there's a thinking man filter what do you desire when the woman comes down the street dressed like that and you man turn your head gaze around like that you're not using a thinking man's filter because when you do that you're committing adultery for the filter said whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her have committed adultery with her already turn your head thinking man get away from her she's not pretty she's a serpent it's right twists like one acts like one stings like one keep her away from her oh yes the word of God is the thinking man's filter anyone knows that that's what your soul is filtered through the word of God and it makes when you come to God when a thinking man comes to God's filter it gives him a holy man's taste right when you come through God's filter then your taste is a holy man's taste it makes a righteous man's taste the slogan certainly is okay now we find out how this is done in a type in is Isel for the congregation of Israel only that's reason speaking this now if ministers disagree on anything is said this is for my congregation that the Lord's given me to to preach to notice in Exodus 19 I want you to read it when you go home when you have more time notice when Israel had committed sin first they took a red heer which had never had a yoke on her neck that means she never was yolked up with anything and she had to be red the color red is a atonement color you know science knows that if you take red and look through red to Red is white look through red at Red is white he looks through the red blood of the Lord Jesus and our red sins become as white as snow red through red and the heer was killed in the evening time by the whole Congregation of Israel and there was put seven Stripes of her blood upon the door where the whole congregation had to enter a type of the seven Church ages by the blood and then her body was taken and burnt it was burnt with the hoof with a skin with the intestines with the dung everything was burnt together and it had to be picked up by a clean man and had to be put in a clean place outside the congregation therefore if Israel could only see the type this word of God must not be handled by dirty hands of unbelief it's got to be a clean man and if he's clean he had to come through God's filter amen a clean man Clean Hands and had to be kept in a clean place not a place where jezzy bells and Ricky and everything partake and take the communion and things when they're running around with wives and husbands and all kinds of Filth going to dances and parties and wearing bobbed hair and shorts and everything else and call themselves Christians it's to be kept in a clean place and handled with Clean Hands and then when Israel sinned and recognized that they had done wrong then they were sprinkled with these ashes of this heer upon them and that was a water of separation of purification for sin notice here it is and went Israel before they could come into Fellowship in the worship they had the first pass through the waters of Separation justification by Fai cometh by hearing hearing the word then they entered into the congregation under those seven Stripes of blood to show that something died and went before them for their sin they were separated by hearing the word the Waters of Separation then entered into Fellowship the only place that God met a man was behind that AR he wouldn't meet him anywhere else he had to come behind that AR God only met Israel in one place and God only meets you today in one place that's in Jesus Christ and he is the word the Waters of separation and his blood was shed for all seven Church ages and then by the Holy Spirit we enter into that Fellowship which is only given to the church oh how great he is also now we want to look at Ephesians 5:26 said it is the washing of the water by the word of waters of Separation what does it do then the filter of God is the word Waters of Separation washing of the Waters of Separation by the word God's filter then you can come into Christ through a church filter you cannot come by a denominational filter or a Creed filter there's only one filter that you can enter into that Holy place that's to the washing of the Water by the word the word of God is a thinking man's filter the church WIll judge you here whether you're a good member or not they'll give you a good funeral and half massive flag at your death sing great reath of flowers and and do everything for you but when it comes down to your soul facing God it's got to have eternal life and if it's an eternal life it's part of the word and as my own word cannot deny my my own hand cannot deny my hand my own eyes cannot deny my hand or my foot or my toe or any part of me it cannot deny and neither can a man that's part of the word of God or a woman deny one part of the word of God and women when you think you can to have Bob Harry come in the presence of God you're wrong you see it you're wrong you can't come through God's fil or you're Washed by the Water of the word amen then you enter into the fellowship you think you are but you can't be until you come through the word and every little spot every little word of God man shall not live by bread orone but by every word am it's got to come through that filteration coming through and that gives a righteous man's taste because that's what he's looking for looking for something to cleanse him the word the word of God is a thinking man's filter and it makes a righteous man's taste we know that true filters all the sin of unbelief out there's a little more disbelief when you come through the filter because it is a true believer's taste the True Believer wants to be right regardless you just don't want to say well I belong to social ranks I belong to church the biggest church in now I don't care if it's a mission on the corner if it's a brush Harbor somewhere a thinking man knows that he's got to meet God in regards to what the church says or anybody else says he's got to come on God's terms and God's terms is God's word well he say God's word sure all of them believe it's God's word but can you filter through it how you going let a bobhair woman come through there that's right how you going to do that how you going to let a man come through there that won't hold up for this Doctrine see it ain't a thinking man's taste no a thinking man think a thinking man will think twice before he jumps into something like that notice that word cannot deny itself then it is satisfied or it's a desire it's a desire of what what made you desire in the first place because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life always laying in there always was in there all that the father has given me will come to me there isn't any of them going to be lost thank God for word tonight that you enjoyed that portion of the word you know brother bam said that uh this word of God must not be handled by dirty hands of unbelief and it's the word that cleanses our hands so we thank God that his filter is his word and that's what we want to come through not our church filter not approval of men or women or some group we want God's word to approve us amen God bless each of you let's all stand to our feet we'll sing a portion of that song when he
