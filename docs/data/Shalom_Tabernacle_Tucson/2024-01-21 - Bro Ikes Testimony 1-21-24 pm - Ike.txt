come now and just bring the things to my remembrance that you want me to say tonight and we give you all the praise and all the glory for forward amen you can be seated I guess you can tell from my Southern accent I I live in South Central Alaska I do but that accent didn't come from Alaska I was born in Louisiana raised up in Mississippi anybody here from Louisiana Mississippi Tennessee ah neighbor yes sir amen we GNA be neighbors in heaven yes sir amen but I just love the Lord and I just want to testify for his glory amen man like I say I was born down in Louisiana my mom was from Louisiana my dad was from Mississippi and I can remember you know things let me give you a little background of my Early Childhood you know grew up you know in farm country in Mississippi but I had a mom that was a Christian my dad he was a he called on God when he got in trouble you know but he was kind of and he was a he was my dad I loved him he loved me in his own way but he never very emotional or you know T just for his expressing his love he was pretty tough and I don't regret that he made a man out of me he taught me how to work and how to do things but my mom taught me about God and how to you know and that's what I I appreciate about her she was always home with us and took care of us know taught us how to work and how to and I don't know why I'm going through all this but that's not my anyway she taught me she had five boys and no girls but she made sure her boys knew everything about house cleaning washing cooking and taking care of them themselves amen cuz she made sure we knew that cuz she was when we got out on our own she wanted to make sure we can survive maybe she just didn't want us to come back home no she loved us but the main thing I can remember as young is her taking us to church and uh you know we was Southern Baptist and she would take us to church and make us get up and go to Sunday school and when she was sick or something couldn't go she made sure we went to Sunday school and uh you know and we love to go to Sunday school and we had went to a little Baptist Church for Sunday school and the pastor he would to give us a little peppermint stick of candy and that wasn't the only reason we was going but you know that was an encouragement sure and I can remember that we called him the candy man but he the pastor of the little church and he would always give us a a peppermint stick of candy for coming to church coming to Sunday school and as we got older I remember starting to public school and uh it used to be different even in the public schools you can pray and you can mention God and I we used to have a little Baptist preacher would come down once a week and he would uh he would uh have Bible Thor and he would give us bible verses to remember you know and that was one of the highlights of school for me is those Bible vers and remember you know I always try to remember my Bible verse so we get a little rewards on the next week at the Bible stury but I remember this one day he asked us said anybody want to be saved now you can't ask that in the school today but he said that anybody want to be saved I tell you what you do you just pray this little prayer when you get home and that's Jesus to come into your heart and uh here's a little model prayer Lord I want I don't I'm a sinner I don't want to be you know basically coming into my heart and save me and I couldn't wait to get home to pray this prayer and that night I got down on my knees by my bed and I pray Lord I'm a sinner I've done wrong and I don't want to be you know just the way he told me and something happened in my heart you know because I was sincere yes and I really wanted God to come into my heart and I was about 8 years old then and something happen Lord and I never forget that experience but being a child and not knowing nothing about God and not knowing what really happened you know I went into the world as a teen teenager but I always remember that and from that time I knew right from wrong I knew when I do what was doing wrong and it bothered me but like Paul say the thing that I would I do not but the things that I would not that do I and it would bother me but you know after you beat that down so much you know it don't bother you as bad anymore and I went through the teenage years of drinking and smoking and doing those things but God started dealing with me again about 28 years old and I and I'm so thankful yes you know I got so miserable that I needed God and my heart was crying out to him but I didn't know where to find him you know you ever been in that position you need God but you know don't know how to you know where he at he is and you know who he is but you don't know how to get to him but God knows where you are de and he knows how to get to you and he got me so messed God didn't do it but Satan got me so messed up in my mind that I thought I was going insane thought I was going insan say things you know but God touched me amen and turned me around and I'm so grateful I had got So Vain and so you know full of myself I should say that I thought I didn't need God and I and I had a spirit on me I know CU it spoke and it scared me one day I was just walking and thinking about you know I have a good job I have all these thing and I was thinking I don't and it came out of my mouth and said I don't need nobody and that scared me so bad I repented right there said God forgive me cuz that wasn't me that was the spirit that's on me it manifest and I'm so glad I saw it amen by the grace of God and I said God forgive me I don't want to be this way and that's when he really started deal to be again and long story I I didn't mean to go this way but it's not my choice yes sir but uh long story short God started dealing with me and I went back to the Baptist Church to the place that I thought God was cuz that's where I last that's where I left it where you left amen so I thought well it wasn't quite that easy my wife was always go to church and you take our son to church you hear me and one day I would stay at home going to watch football on Sunday morning but one day Jeremy got where he didn't want to go he wanted to stay home with Dad and my wife asked me to make him go to church and I couldn't do that I got up and I got dressed and I took him to church I wasn't going to be a hypocrite and make my son go to church when I wasn't going and that's how I started going back to church and well that's good yes in my heart I couldn't do it and I'm glad I didn't do it cuz God thoughted deals with me in the Baptist Church and uh I remember this one Sunday they invited the original Pastor for that church but he had moved on to Pentecost he was no longer a Baptist and he and man was that a service but he w r those Baptist over the coold boy they everybody in the church was mad but at him but me I was I was shouting because he called out all the sin in my life you know and I you know I went to the bench in the morning bench sir that's what they call it the moaning I went to the I was moaning too you know because God had dealt with my heart and uh but all the deacons was oh man they were sitting like this I said what's wrong with these people God has just spoke and told you the truth and you mad at it you fold your owns on God and that's what a lot of people do today they fold up and set up on God and he can't do nothing for them and it's by his grace he's trying to deliver us amen amen amen but that's the nature of man but anyway and after a while they asked me to be a deacon in the church and uh and I accepted it but and I because there was an Old Gentleman a Baptist uh uh Deacon and I noticed something there was some older people in the church they were genuine sincere they were spiritual people but the majority of the younger people were just put on I mean there was in I'm in that group I was in that group I put it that way just just to put on and uh but there was some that were genuine and this old Baptist ministry he kind of took me on his wing you know and he just you know teaching me how to be a deacon and I appreciate him the name was Deacon Mixon and uh and his wife and that group was uh genuine but like I say there was a a younger generation in the church that all they care about was dressing and looking good amen it's sad but anyway moving on God dealt with me a while in that church because while I was in there let me back up a little bit while I was doing while I was being a deacon there my brother heard the message on the radio in sou out of North Pole Alaska uh brother Jim bit Grandmother Had a radio station up there and she was Broadcasting brother Bram taped on online and my brother heard it and uh and got and got in contact with her and she gave him a minister name and uh I don't think the man was a minister brother Dennis Ballard and had Brother Don babet from Canada come to Anchorage and he came down and met with these brothers and they introduce him to the message and he got some tapes and he brought him back and he gave him to me and I was in the Baptist Church but I didn't listen to him I took the tapes and put them down in my basement and they were down there for two years and during that time I was continued to go to the Baptist Church my brother came into uh Anchorage where I live and he invited me to some services and I went and I heard things that I've never heard before how Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I heard that the correct way to baptize with in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know I had never heard these things before in the Baptist Church right so but and I believe that they were right but what really got me was the love between the people okay when they say God bless you they look in the eye and they me it amen not like we Baptist know we Pat each other on the bag of sta one another in the bag you but it started to bother me after a while when we baptize somebody in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost and now I got a revelation that it's wrong and it was just but I wasn't actually doing it I was assisting the pastor as a deacon but it's like every time we do that like stabbing me in the heart with a knife cuz I knew better but I didn't do anything about it until my son Jeremy wanted to be baptized right now I have to take a stand God know how to force you to take a stand you know you can squirt around all you want but when the time come you going to have to stand for right or wrong amen I'm so glad he gave me the courage to stand so I didn't know what to do at the first how to do it I was praying God what am I going to do now know how am I going to do this I need I'm not going to let my son be baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost so I went and something said go get those tapes down in your basement I went down in my basement grabbed a box of tapes opened it up pulled out a tape didn't even look at the tile stuck it in the tape player and what the godhead explain I knew God was talking to me right there yes sir and I listened to that tape and I got a revelation of the godhead you know I always believed even in Baptist Church I always believed there was one God but I didn't know how to explain it and they tried to convince me there was more than one God but I stand on stood on it there's one God how do you know there's one God I don't know but there's one God that's right and God revealed to me that he is one amen so after I finished those tapes that tape I got the tape and I went to talk to my pastor and I asked him to listen to it with me and he said okay and we put the tape on the tape layer and turn it on and we listen to about 30 seconds of it click and he looked at me and said the reason you believe he start talking about false prophets and the reason you believe this you haven't been taught the B what the Baptist believe and I love the man and I didn't you know he's a man finister of God so I honored him not disrespect him or get mad at him but I just said I believe this is the truth amen and I'm going to and and if God if I'm sincerely seeking the truth from God he will not let me be deceived I'm going to these people and I'm getting baptized the right way and I'm going to go church out there and I went and I got baptized and I was happy but my wife wasn't she forbid me to take our children to that church and I heard I had said I listened to the rest of those tapes in that box and brother Bram said don't fight with her just love her and I did I did that not my wisdom it was the wisdom of the Lord you know the word of the Lord and I applied it and with no more than two weeks he had changed completely and she was going to the church amen so the word of God works if you applied amen there's a lot I can say but one another testimony I want to give for sure God saved me in an airplane crash you able to put that picture up right now want you to see that's the airplane you know I fly on I flew on airplane for 42 years commercial not uh cargo airplanes been all over the world landing on lakes mining strips side of mountains box canyons everywhere and here I get in a little private plane little four seater and the devil tried to take my life but God is awesome he's awesome with this plane belonged to a brother in the church he had partnered with a brother Tom Borland I don't know if it should have called name he might not want his name called but it wasn't his fault it was I was just God I believe God it was for the it's for the glory of God everything the footsteps of the righteous order of the Lord that's right and he working all things together for our good but it during the time uh we had a we was have no it was a Sunday we were we had had a Sunday service and we was going out fishing my wife was out of town she was on vacation and the kids were down visiting her mom and I was had a few days of Freedom no I I was off work and I had a few days off and so I was going to go fishing which I love to do I was going fishing I was going to drive up the highway and you to B fish from the stream do some Crow salmon fishing but there was a brother Frank Dutton brother-in-law was in town and they had taken a flying trip out to this Peters Creek salmon fishing and uh brother Tom had bought this airplane with some parners and he wanted to try it out and he had he's a pilot he had a few hours under his belt and uh so and brother Ray M was going with them and they asked me to go say they got room for another person so I said well I I'll go and uh JN dad brother Jose Davis said is you thinking wise for three deacons to get in the same plane and I we didn't think nothing about it you know but you know the president and the vice president don't ride on the same same airplane but uh we know we kind of thought about it you know we'll be okay and we got on the airp we went out to the lake there's a float plane taking off off off the water and Tom brother Tom had filled up the the uh Wings tanks and it was fully loaded with fuel and I weighed about 250 lb in Brother Ray Muse is about 65 and he probably weighed 300 lb and and we had gear you know and we had food and we had too much weight to get out the water so we kept we run go down to the end of the lake and we pour the power to and we go down the lake and we get almost to the other bank he Cho the power because we couldn't get off the water we did it about three times we figured we'd do it another time somebody going to call FAA and they're going to be out here but we went out the next time and we got enough momentum to get it off the water and we flew out there and we had a wonderful time we caught fish we had two a piece coming back that's more way coming back so Tom figure because of the weight he's going to cut back way back on the fuel just enough to get a out there and back you know so we can get wouldn't have any problem getting off the lake out there and that's what he did he came out to pick us up and we was flying back and just sightseeing looking at moose and The Meadows down there and we're going in to land in memory Lake in waso Alaska just a gradual descent and when we got almost to the lake he pulled back on the power just to level out you know set his flaps and get ready to land and when he did the engine spurted and it quit now let me back up just a little bit and show you how God prepares you for these things before time you know that was in 19 about 1993 and so his brother about 1990 a brother had called me and told me exactly everything that happened in that airplane crash he told me he had had a dream and seen it beforehand he told me where I would be sitting in the airplane he didn't see the other two people he didn't know who they were but he knew he knew he saw me sitting in the back of this airplane and it shook him up and he called me and told me about it and it kind of bothered me a little bit because I fly every day on airplanes I didn't know what kind of airplane and I said in the back at my commercial airplane you know I got a pilot co-pilot flight engineer I sit right over here at the the Das now ation where I do my paperwork at so I it kind of bothered me a little bit but I said I'm not going to quit my job I mean so I just committed unto the Lord you know cuz I've heard of in other testimony that prepared me for that that hour you know another testimony uh a brother told me about uh his sister had a dream that she was hit by semi and ran over by semi in her car and she went and told her dad and I believe her dad knew brother Brandon and he told the dream to brother Brandon and brother brandom now this is their personal testimony you won't find it on tape but I believed it because they're Christian and and God can do these things and uh when told her the brother brand and brother Brown told him well he didn't didn't get no interpretation of the dream but it says you know wishes and mediums can predict these kind of things but they can't have no power to change it amen they can they have no power to change it but as Christian we could change the outcome through prayer amen yes that's right and and and and I know that's the truth so I just pray and said God I don't know what this is all about I don't even know even though it's you basically but you know I I fly every day and I'm not not going to live in fear and I put it in your hands and I forgot about it just forgot about it and went know did my job and when I was going down in that airplane all this came back to me how did I skip something I was flying along the airplane engine quit and when we would get ready to go down those things started coming back to my memory man I remembered those things and my wife I remember but the main thing I remember I began to think I thought about my wife and my kids cuz I thought I was going to die I thought about the brothers I was with in their families and just thinking I said Lord this is I wasn't talking I mean my mind was going to racing and like everything else was in slow motion but your mind is just you know A Thousand Miles a minute you're thinking about everything and I'm thinking about The Three Families this is going to be devastating to our church you know and the thought come to me God if you don't help us we're going to die and the scripture came to me the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous can run into it and be saved and I believe that and I grabbed a hold to that scripture you know God always give you his word yes as a way out yes sir you know I'm standing here and the devil was filling my mind with fear and all kind of things but the word of the Lord spoke to my heart and said the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous can run into it and be saved and what is a righteous man brother Braham say he's not a sinless man but he one that trusted in a sinless one a righteous sacrifice and that's where my faith lies in Jesus Christ amen and I can remember as Tom pull back on the Yol now we don't have any power we're just gliding along and you know when the airplane quit engine quit you better pick a spot and go for it you find the best place you can think you can land and you go for it and then you go straight to it other words you turn anything you're going to stall lose power and and that's what happened I it's just the grace of God because we wouldn't have made it to the lake and there was nothing but trees underneath us so he turned just a little bit to the left and I heard the stall horn going off that's a scary sound when you have no power it started going off and I knew we were going down and usually an airplane when it stalls it breaks the we left bring wake break or the right whichever way it turn and it goes into a spin and into the ground and we was nowhere near enough altitude to recover from the Star so and it broke but it didn't go into a spin it went down like this uh the vertical stabilized on the back of the plane I know you know you can't see it ver could stabilized the tail section back here but the vertical stabilize it what steer the airplane D and it it hit a power line and it cut the stabilizer off that slowed us down a little bit and the left wing the left wing see it broke off and came over the top of the airplane on top of the other wing it hit a birch tree Leading Edge here and just rip the whole Leading Edge of that Wing out it kind of SP us around a little bit more and the floats is underneath you can't see them there it look like big canoes on the bottom of a airplane how many know what a flow plane is okay you know anyway those they say usually when you land on the ground those upright the bracket that holds those Flo on they hit the ground and they come up through the airplane like knives and they kill the passengers inside but it didn't happen that way we went in was right here you can't see it but there's a road we was close enough to the lake there's a road that runs around the lake like a uh right on the slope you know what a me like the down in the ditch on that those floats hit right on the edge of that road and took most of the impact went up underneath that Wing popped that Wing off and it came over the top of me in the back seat there was a fear of leaking but we you know but we had no well by the grace of God we didn't catch on fire but uh that Wing popped off come over top of me me uh the front engine cing hit on you see that little evergreen tree underneath there I don't know if you can see it but right underneath there has a green like a Bruce tree it hit that tree up here and rode it down just like a shock absorber I mean it was no more than a hard bump the winded windshield blew out of the airplane but we stepped out without a scratch amen but before we went into that star I remember saying Jesus and I remember brother Tom say Jesus at the same time and if the two any two can agree on anything on Earth as touching yes sir as touching it shall be done in heaven that's power in the name of Jesus Christ don't be afraid to call on that name he wants you to call on his name he wants you to show you his glory oh God is awesome you know God is awesome now I didn't remember all these things until I after I got in my truck and was driving away from the scene of the crime the accident then God brought all these things back to my memory that he showed me almost three years before it happened what was going to happen amen and he gave me enough Faith to call on his name and be delivered amen you know he could have came on the scene and just reached down and caught the airplane set it down God can do anything but he want us to trust his word amen that's what he wants me to do to take him at his word you know I would tell you another little testimony this has happened about oh it's been about six weeks ago I was feeling kind of you know how pastors get sometime like nobody loves you yeah yeah you know cuz nobody ever bites you over or you know every time you tell somebody you need to talk to them they get like the kids going to the principal's office you know but you know we're just human just like everybody else we like Fellowship you know I want to say that brother Joe and sister the faith is awesome they always have people over over to their house just nothing but hosital ity good good Deacon and his wife but see I'm I'm not quite that way myself so I can't say too much I'm I'm giv to hospitality but you know my age group you know when I get all the kids over and all this stuff I I'm not ready for them to go home after an hour or so but anyway I I was uh just kind of feeling sorry for myself I guess just God I need you I need a touch know it's been a long time since I really had a fellowship with you and you and you get so busy worried about this and worried about that all right no worri about the people but this this ain't my church this is God's Church you know he I need to spend my quality time with him just like you do like I praying for you and trying to get not you but I'm talking about my church I'm praying for them and trying to get something from God for my people and that's I I keep saying my people God's people but you know and uh you forget to have been your quality time with God you know Jesus told his disciples to come aside into the desert and rest a while but you know you got to rest every now and then brother brother po go fishing you know enjoy it cuz brother BR time and not counted to a man when he's fishing but I I love to fish too and it's really really relaxing when you leave your phone at home yeah I hate it when I got a fish you on the phone ring true amen but I was saying Lord I need a touch from you and I just it's it was awesome I felt just like a little kid and I said father I need a hug in all mine you talking about an anoy and that came right in here and I can spread throughout my whole body I've never felt the presence of the Lord like that before but if you want a hug God will give you a hug if you need need it I mean how many need a hug from God yes sir all you got to do is ask I know that's true but I've been trying to do that again but he don't answer me like that because I get to he don't want me to depend on feelings he want me to take him at his word he promised he'll never leave me or forsake me but he'll be with me always but if I don't if I get so I can't feel him I get scared God don't want me to be that way just trust him believe him with all my heart amen amen that's right that's what he want us to do to take him at his word and be faithful we don't have to understand everything we don't have to we would never will understand everything with these human brain but I believe all things by faith we understand amen that's what the Bible say by faith we understand that the world were framed by the word of God Amen okay explain that to me can't we just have to take God at his word and that's the way for anything about God you got to take him at his word believe it and then have you amen one more I'm a missionary and I believe everyone you are you have the same commission that we have as ministers go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature amen Every Creature brother BR preached to apome Divine Healing amen Every Creature it works on everything Jesus cursed the Fig Tree so the gospel works on everything and I love to go and preach the gospel you know and brother Bram say is not I'm sorry Paul Paul said and brother Braham said it also CU he was a messenger like Paul but he said the gospel come not in word only yes but in power and demonstration of the Holy ghosten and brother and uh brother B said God vindicates his word and I believe that so my first missionary trip I was expecting to see signs and wonders and miracles and everything that's promised in the Bible I was expecting to see that and I went with brother Frank dudon to the Philippines and we went up above bagio way up in the mountains and out in the Buddhist little places you know preaching the gospel I remember I can't remember the name of the place but it was way up in the mountain and uh we would preaching in a like a a probably a a baseball stadium or something like that no it was concrete it wasn't dating but it's kind of A Gathering Place for Community together and they had one light buff and it was totally dark there was no street light there was no light in the house and you had the one light bulb hanging and uh you stand under the light bulb and you couldn't see nobody you're preaching but you couldn't see nobody and and it was kind of close to the rebel territory so they had one guy out there with AK-47 guard and everything you know that was scary but anyway we preached there and we preached uh a couple days there we was with a Philipino brother that were taking us around to these different places and I remember one night it rained so we couldn't have it out there so they moved it into a gymnasium school gymnasium I believe but but it wasn't many people there that night and there was one little lady came up and she was started confessing her sins to brother Frank and he told no sister you don't have to confess to me you need to talk to Jesus cist you know so we prayed with her and uh she gave her heart to the Lord that was after we had preached and it gave her heart to the Lord and uh did you wanted to be baptized well they didn't have no water to baptize they in no pool or anything so all the saints there were some Believers there they got all their drinking water which was rationed at the time they took all their drinking water and put it in a little trough and they got enough to to baptize her that was awesome and uh I came back home you know I was kind of kind of disappointed because I didn't see a whole lot of Miracles that I expected to see and I was kind of grumbling about it and the Lord spoke to my heart and said you saw the greatest Miracle ever was and I thought what that you saw a Sav you saw a soul get saved amen amen so and that changed my attitude you know I could have was s drinking water to do it and that changed my whole attitude you know what am I I was looking for signs and wonders but God was looking for Souls amen you can heal somebody he can heal somebody and they only get sick again that's right he raised us from the dead and he died again that's right amen so what's most important when a soul is saved it's for eternity amen and brother BM said if you have something to do with that you support a missionary or you know he said if you can't go what send somebody and when you send a missionary Every Soul that he get to the Lord is accounted to you too your name will be associated with that Soul For Eternity so what's what is value what is important yes nothing but winning Soul am nothing but you know getting somebody to Jesus Christ amen oh my and that when you do that that's the greatest joy that's the greatest feeling in the world when you see somebody except the Lord amen I can go on on but I'm not going to stay here all night but I hope you enjoy what has been said thus far and I know you get everybody in here is a missionary and it don't mean just go overseas it mean wherever you are let your light shine yes sir they may see your good works glorify your father which is in heaven that's my desire I'm getting older not old man yet but I'm getting older just turned 69 years old if I ever going to do something for the Lord I better get busy amen better get busy because the time is at hand it's short brother brother Paul preached this morning we're living in a dark time and it's only going to get darker but as brother BR told us we know that there's a man here that can turn on the light and he has and he's Shin it right on his word so we know what the antidote is we know what to do know how to combat the enemy stand on that word it's the only thing brother Brown said that would defeat the Devil any place any time under any circumstances so he can't defeat the word amen I'm going end it there brother Paul God bless you again I'm thankful for to be here just to share some of my testimony I know all of you have a testimony I like to be here all night to hear everybody's testimony but that take a long time when but one of these days in heaven we'll hear each other testimony I can't hear I can't wait to hear Brother Paul's testimony all those disciples that
