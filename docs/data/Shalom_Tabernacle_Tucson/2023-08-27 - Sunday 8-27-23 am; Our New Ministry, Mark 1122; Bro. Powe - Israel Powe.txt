TRANSCRIPT
========================================
turn deer Isaiah 53 God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same this brother random opened this message up before the Seven Seals series that he brought to us and we will be um going through this message here starting that paragraph 143 I believe it is and are starting at 104 ending that paragraph 143 two places in the scripture brother random reads here as Isaiah 53 and in Matthew chapter 11 we'll just take Isaiah 53. before we read let us pray Lord Jesus to come to you this morning asking you to bless us with your presence bless us with your anointing Upon Our Lives reveal more of your word to us each of us Lord and bless those that are on their way Lord that are coming gathered in your name we give you all the praise the glory and the honor we ask you Lord to take full control of the service speak to our hearts we pray from the youngest one to the oldest one bless the other classes this morning as well we pray in Jesus name amen Isaiah 53 verse 1. who hath believed our report into whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and that's a root out of a dry ground he hath no form or calmliness and when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him he's despised and rejected them men a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not yeah I think we will read Matthew chapter 11 if we can turn there quickly verses number 25 and 26 and you have that you can say Amen at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight amen the thing only believe amen [Music] only believe [Music] that all things are possible only believe only believe only believe all things are possible only be I bless you may be seated brother Branham and um now in Isaiah the 53rd chapter of Isaiah the first verse 13. I want to ask this question now this is not pertaining to the Seven Seals at all this is just a message for I know I had to have dedication I couldn't go into that because I wouldn't have time but I thought just for a little dedicational service little memorial service for this church or a little dedicational service brother then they uh they wouldn't be time man to go into what I want to say see on this opening of this book so I will tonight and uh now this is just a little service that it'll blend right in with it also now listen to every word catch it and and if you're taking it on tapes or anything then you stay right with that teaching you don't say nothing but what that tape says just say just exactly what the tape says I think now because some of those things will go to understand a whole lot about this now why it's misunderstood see and you be sure to say just what the tape says don't say nothing else see I don't say that on my own it's him that says it and um so many times confusion people raise up say well so and so said it meant so-and-so yes just leave it it's the way it is that's the way we want the Bible just the way the Bible says it that's the way we want it just just like that don't put on our interpretation to it it's already interpreted now uh who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed and you read it again now closely who has believed our report question and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed in other words if you have believed our report then the arm of the Lord has been revealed who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed now I want to read also in the book of Saint Matthew's gospel the 11th chapter of Saint Matthew and now you bring your papers and things because constantly we're if you don't have a recorder uh you uh you bring the uh your paper so we can get it the 11th chapter of Saint Matthew the 25th and 26th verses 11 26 and 27. all right Jesus speaking in prayer I want to begin a little bit behind that let's make it the 25th and 26th verse I believe that's where announced though for I had it March in my Bible at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee Oh father a Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seems good in thy sight catch those two scriptures who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed even stand Jesus thank God that he had hid the mysteries from the wise and prudian and would reveal it to babes such as would learn for it seemed good to God to do that now from this text uh from the scripture reading I draw this text God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same now for the tapes I keep repeating so for the papers because they're they're taping it think God hiding himself in simplicity than revealing himself in the scene it is strange to think how that God does such a thing as that God will hide himself and something so simple that'll cause a wise to miss in a million miles and then turn right back around in that some simple thing in the Simplicity of his way of working and reveal himself right out again I thought it made a a text that we might study this before we go into the the great teachings of the Seven Seals many miss him by the way he reveals himself now man has her own ideas of what God art to be and what God is going to do and as I have made the old statement many times that man Still Remains man man is always giving God praise for what he did do and always looking forward to what he will do and ignoring what he's doing that's the way they miss it they look back and see what a great thing he done but they fail to see what a simple thing he used to do it with you and then they look forward and see a great thing coming that's going to happen and nine times out of ten it's already happening right around him it's so simple that they don't know one day uh a man up here at Utica and if some of his people sure I don't say this for any Affinity radical exposure of the man he was a a veteran of the Civil War and um I believe he was I don't know which side he was on but I believe he was a rebel but he uh he was an infidel and he claimed that there was no such a thing as God he lived in Utica his name of Jim Dorsey many of you people might have known him he's giving him any watermelon when I was the little fella he used to raise watermelons down on the river and the bottoms there and he was quite a friend to my daddy but he said one day one of the great outstanding things that was ever said to him in contrast I was just a little boy in those days but uh in contrast to his belief that caused him to walk away and drop his head and cry and I understood that by this the man was gloriously converted to Christ at the age of about 85 years old he asked the little girl one day who was coming from Sunday school why did she waste your time on doing such a thing as that she said because she believed that there was a god and Mr Darcy said that he said child you are so wrong to believe in such a thing as that and said that the little girl stooped down and picked up a little flower out of the off of the ground pulled it from its petals and said Mr Darcy could you tell me how this lives there it was when he began to search back he could have said to the child what's growing in the Earth and then the questions could revolve back where deers come from how'd that seed get there what happened on on and running on back until he seen see not the great glamorous things that we think about but it's the simple things that God is so real the simplicity so it pleases God to reveal himself and then hide himself then hide himself and reveal himself in simple little things it's it's put over the top of the head of man because if you say why would it just God do that is because that man was made up in the beginning not to try to shift for himself a man was made to rely completely upon God that's the reason we're liking into land there's sheep a sheep cannot lead himself he has to have a leader and the holy spirit's supposed to lead us amen so man is made that way and God made all of his works so simple that the simple could understand it and God makes himself simple with the simple in order to be understood by the sample and otherwise he said in Isaiah 35 I believe he said the fool should not error therein it's so simple and we know that God is so great do we expect it to be some great something and we miss the simple thing we stumble over simplicity that's how we miss God Is by stumbling over simplicity God is so simple until the scholars of these days and all days missing a million miles because in their intellects they know that there's nothing lacking so great but in his Revelation he makes it so simple they go Plumb over the top of it and miss it now study that stud it all and you people who are visiting here when you go to your motel rooms take those things and ponder over them we don't have time to break it down as it should be broke down but I want you to do it when you get to the motel or hotel or wherever you're staying or the home gather together and study over it miss him by the way that he reveals himself or he is so great yet hides himself in Simplicity to make himself known to the least see don't try to get the great because he goes over the top of it but listen to the Simplicity of God and then you find God now you're in the simple ways High polished worthy wisdom educated always misses him now I'm not here and there I know there are School teachers two or three that I know of setting in here and I'm not here to contradict school and education and try to support illiteriness I'm not here for that but what it is the people as Soul play so much upon that until they're even in the seminaries and so forth they're missing the very thing that God has left before them that's why uh not against brother who are in denominations but I'm against system of denominations because it tries to magnify uh itself and and and educate its ministers and such such a place until if they don't have the proper schooling and education they're ousted and and they have to stand the psychiatrist test and so forth I've never think that it was God's will to test the minister by Psychiatry but to testing by the word [Music] would be God's way of testing his man that he sent out to have the word preach the word now today we preach philosophy we preach Creed and denominationalism and so many things in leaving off the word because they say it can't be understood it can be understood he promised to do it now we're asking him to do it now we're going to take a few characters here for a few minutes let's notice in the days of Noah nors they God seen worldly wisdom so greatly punctuated and respected he sent a simple message by a simple person to show them his greatness now we know that in the day of of Noah they claim that a civilization was so mighty than until we have never reached that spot yet in our modern civilization and I believe that it will finally be reached because our lord said as it was in the days of Noah so will it be at the coming of the son of man and he gave some illustration and they built the Pyramid in the speaks are in Egypt and they built gigantic things that we have no power today to build such with it they had a an embalming if they could embalm a body to make it look so natural until it still stays today we cannot we cannot make a mummy today we're having the stuff to make it with they had colors that that hold so fast for four or five thousand years ago it still remains just the same color it was see we don't have no such as that today and many great things of that Civilization uh speaks of its superiority over our modern civilization and so you can imagine how education and science of such great tokens that we have left that there was such a civilization what the what a great civilization that must be well these memorials how that science and and modern civilization and education was was uh a must with the people they must be it had to be there was hardly any I guess India literacy among them at all and so God's searching through that great economy at that day in their systems could not perhaps find the right type of a man until he found on illiterate maybe farmer by the name of Noah a sheep herder and he gave him his message to preach to the people that was so simple to the their scholarships of that day until the people stumbled over the Simplicity of the message and yet the message was in the face of science radical how could there be rain in the skies when there was no rain up there and the simple message of of building an ark constructing is something to get into that there's no water to float it why become a fanatic I need to become a a uh what we would call if you'd excuse the expression of today a oddball and nearly all God's people are oddballs they are I'm glad to be one of them amen so you know they they're different from the the Modern Trend of civilization so they become odd strange he said his people wants to Peculiar people oh it strange but a spiritual priesthood a royal Nation offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruits of their lips giving praise to his name what a what a people got him and notice now what a great thing that must have been in that day for some fanatic to come forth to the church of fanatics and preaching a gospel that was seemingly uh all out of line to their way of believing and scientists well it was simply crazy how they could scientifically prove there was no rain there but this simple sheep herder believed if God said it would rain it would rain and so they just compare that with the day about some money gets healed they say it's only emotion uh I can scientifically prove to you that the cancer of the substance are are the thing is still there but to the simple believer is gone see because he's not looking at the substance he's looking at the promise just the same as Noah did so don't you see as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man scientifically no one the doctor could say look at your your lump is still there your cancer remains your arm is as crippled As It Ever Was you're crazy and remember that that same Spirit from the days of Noah that said there's no rain up there we can shoot the moon with instruments and there's no rain there but if God said there would be rain there for faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence the things have not seen and Faith takes its final resting place on the word of God that's where it Finds Its resting place if you understand it's resting places on God's word that's where Noah arrested it God said so that's settled now if you notice again then now Noah is believing such was a fanatic [Music]

Saint Mark chapter 11. for our scripture reading and this is our lord Jesus speaking here verse number 12. and on the morrow when they were come from Bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if happy he might find anything there on and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and Jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of the Hereafter forever and his disciples heard it verse 22 Jesus answering and saith unto them have faith in God verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which ye saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith this scripture at stumped the prophet as he called it for many years and so much that he would not preach on it it held him back because he couldn't see how a man can say whatever he wanted to say according to Jesus and if he believed in his heart that God would give it to him he couldn't understand that verse 24 therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when ye stand praying forgive and if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you of your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses amen amen we thank God for the reading of his word there was one more place to think I wanted to take here but we'll pray right there let's pray Heavenly Father we ask your blessings upon us this morning we read your most holy word two portions in this scripture of you speaking to a fig tree and you spoke to it in such a way that somehow it heard you and it obeyed you and you spoke to the winds and the waves and it somehow it heard you and it obeyed you Lord I pray that we will hear you and we would obey you this morning that's my prayer we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated let me ask you something does that did that fig tree have ears does the wind and the waves have ears to hear Jesus spoke to him in whatever language Jesus used Aramaic or Hebrew whatever language he used he spoke and that tree heard it amen the disciples heard it too and the next day they went to see the tree and it had been cursed from The Roots and this really uh got the attention of the disciples now I want to read something from the message just for a moment what the prophet says here about this scripture it's in the message I stand at the door and knock 1957. I'm going to read two places there stand at the door and knock and he says this same statement again speak to this mountain 1957. I know I didn't give you this somebody says so you all got to work real hard back there to follow me this morning for the part that I didn't give you brother Branham says this and I want you to listen to this closely and we'll trust it this will bless your heart and we'll we'll let the Lord have his way in our life is that what you want this morning are you are you ready to leave already did you come here to get a glass of water did you come here to use the bathroom [Music] it's like so some people come here so I can go use the bathroom we come here to hear the word of the Lord I trust that something will be said to bless you to help you to encourage you along the way I mean I know we started a bit late and we'll make up the time here all right and this message is paragraph 58 you must open that door of faith and let him in then he will give you the desire of your heart he that wadeth upon the Lord shall renew his strength they shall Mount up like eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will it'll be given to you oh verily I say unto you if you if thou shall say to this mountain be removed and in the original Greek Lexicon says be raised up and thrown into the sea and believe that it's being done oh my I believe that it's being done you shall have what you say certainly oh I don't have to ha it don't have to be spontaneous spontaneously it don't have to be that way certainly not just as long as you believe it there is where Christians fail today he says that again and speak to this mountain paragraph number nine he says and to think that Jehovah God who could shed forth his great Glory as we look towards heaven and the stars and the solar system is more than dust in his hand and he'd be so concerned that even when Jesus of Nazareth passed by that simple fig tree and looked upon it as if it to find something to eat he said no man eat from thee in the original Greek it says for a season which the word forever only means for a season forever is the space of time because it's forever and conjunction forever but an eternity has no beginning or ending so he said no man eat it for from thee for a season now you notice immediately something happened to that tree though it didn't show that it happened and on the next day they passed by Peter looked at the tree and he said behold the fig tree without curse yesterday is drying up something had taken place he looked at them and said verily I say unto you if you should say to this mountain and be removed and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart now on the original it says this the Greek Lexicon it says if you should say to this mountain be lifted up and thrown into the sea don't doubt it in your heart but believe that it is being done you shall have what you say we are looking for things so spontaneous but what did he mean you look at the mountain and say be thou lifted up and thrown into the sea then in your heart believe that what you have said is taking place now you don't see it taking place but it is taking place because the word can't lie everything else can lie everything else can let you down everything else can have a a question mark but not the word of God there is no question marks on his word when we read it we just say Amen even if we can't explain it even if I can't preach on it yet it's still God's word and it will do exactly what it said it will do amen I trust the Lord will bless you this morning amen believe that it's being done that's the tall mountain in my life that's a tall order to ask a mountain to be lifted up and thrown into the sea but if you say it and believe it in your heart what did Jesus say maybe it'll work no he did not say maybe it'll work he said it is being done it's already done it's happening you can have whatever you say whatever you say amen now praise the Lord I feel good this morning and this great message on the third pool we've been talking as we took Saint John chapter 6. and was bringing that the last couple of services on how Jesus's Ministry consisted of those three pools and brother Branham brings that out to us and how his ministry consisted of those three pools and how there is a promise of the third pool to the believer it's something that you're attracted to you know there's there's deep things in the word of God that you can't explain but you're attracted to it you want the understanding to it you might not know what it is but there's something that pulls you towards it and it's it's something clean it's something Noble it's a key it's something that will change your direction something that'll give you faith and power to overcome you know he's got it you know it's in the word but you can't articulate it quite right you can't explain it just right but you know that God's got the answer for you so what do you do you stay faithful you stay with the word you stay in his presence and he might drop a crumb to you Hallelujah and he might open up something to you that's more precious than gold more precious than a promotion on a job more precious than anything in this world we desire that don't we they're called Mysteries it's a mystery until it's revealed and then once it's been revealed the mystery is now history as brother banham tells us in Christ The Mystery of God revealed I don't have to quote here with me but that mystery is a mystery to those until it's been revealed once it's revealed it's a history remember he preached the uh Services since the end of the time three years later he's referring back to it and he's telling the people remember the sirs is this the time message division the rock the blast the unknown writing he says that it was a mystery three years ago but it's been revealed now the mystery is history and history is his story not your story or my story his story if it ain't his story it ain't history and ain't worth reading about but when God says anything you might not know what it means today but if he opens it up to you then Revelation becomes story praise the Lord it's the beauty of this great message so we brought a few things on that third pool as brother Branham had brought it to us and shared some of those things in the ministry of Jesus then we brought how we know that there's a great persecution coming the prophet warned us of it told us thus saith the Lord the great enemy to the church has always been Rome and those forces will join together again to bring a persecution upon the church how many no that's true let me know we're not looking for America to turn back to God and get back better again uh uh how many know we're not looking for a great Revival to take place amongst the church world out there but that the Revival the taking place of the word opening happens to individuals and those individuals should be you and I and the ministry of the third pool has an attraction to the believer it's very mysterious we don't understand it fully but it's opening up more and more to us and the prophet of God deals with this a little bit in the message I'm going to take this message the anointed ones at the end time I want you to notice what he says here in paragraph 238 on my end it's different than maybe in some of the tablets or phones but I think the sisters can pick this up notice Revelation 16 13 to 14. between the sixth and seventh vow I want you to hear this three unclean spirits like frogs did you notice that went out of the mouth of someone now notice quickly are you ready say Amen a trinity of spirits and now denominational brother set still just a minute don't get up and walk out of the room back out there on this radio telephone hookup don't turn your tape recorder off is that still just a minute to listen you're born of God you will a trinity of frogs a frog is an animal that always looks backwards he never looks where he's going he looks where he comes from see don't you see where was trinitarianism born at remember three unclean spirits individual Spirits are you getting it notice they look back to the nicer Council where the Trinity Doctrine was born at not in the Bible there's no such a thing they look back in the nine city council at night Rome where the Trinity was born at notice where they come from notice and The Trinity of frogs came out of an old Trinity give birth to a new Trinity their mother what did it come out of a trinity the dragon scene the Beast and the false prophet a trinity knew when when were these frogs come out when did when did it notice they was there all the time but it wasn't manifested until between the sixth and the seventh vile just before the seals open to reveal it for in the message of the seven Angel the mysteries of God will be known all these trinitarian things and false baptisms and everything was to be made manifest God help us to see what's truth and not think it's somebody trying to say something I feel that Spirit resenting that you see I'm not speaking of myself brother I'm speaking of the Angel of the Lord that's in the camp that's exactly right notice a trinity the dragon how many knows what the dragon was it was Rome and the dragon stood before the woman to devour her child as soon as it was born that's right what does the beast mean in the bible a power all right false prophet false prophet a false anointed one see started where this false prophet singular false prophet the first pope and from there come out the and the mother of harlots the whole thing false Trinity was Rising not in the early days wouldn't be made manifest in the early days it went right on through with it but when the Seven Seals become and open those Mysteries and revealed them that's when the frogs the unclean spirits like frogs come out to manifest themselves a trinity Doctrine against the truth y'all reading that up there that's not me right that's a prophet you could say Amen so it was after the seals had opened up he says they were always there it was always hidden there but the word of the Lord being revealed manifested other spirits all right see where it come from where it's going back to ecumenical council they're all Brothers anyhow Same Spirit same thing and watch so deceiving performing Miracles and these are devils that go forth to all the gods of the earth working miracles to deceive them in the last days and we'll succeed in doing it what did God say about that evil spirit he said I'll go down and get into the mouth of those prophets because cause them to prophesy a lie to cause Ahab to come out there to be destroyed that's second Kings chapter 22. God said go you will succeed you will get them to believe it they're not on the that word to begin with see go for you will persuade him you'll be the one will do it when you get in those false prophets because he's relying right on them and he don't know nothing about the word neither will he try to learn about it he can't do it because he's a thistle to begin with seeing you'll succeed look here at these false frogs looking back while you know what they said back there at niacia so here the prophet is now opening up in Revelations chapter 16. this false Trinity that would be revealed in the last days they come to light after the word had been revealed the word had to be spoken the word had to be revealed and once the word is revealed it uncovers everything not just the things of light but it uncovers what darkness is it uncovers what sin is the Pharisees were okay until Jesus came and when Jesus came and spoke the truth his truth revealed the lie that they were living under and that's what any truth will do it reveals the lies the darkness the hidden things so that you can know how to overcome to recognize the enemy and his tactics and then you can overcome pretty powerful and this is why the third pool means so much to us this opening of the word even though we don't have all the details of it maybe or how to operate it because it's a very deep and vast subject even in the prophet's life remember he always questions is this that third pool Lord or is this the furthermen of my Ministry now when he preached the message my new ministry he is now explaining to the people for one of the first times what this great uh uh uh this super anointing did to him as it pertains to speaking into creation he had the God had given him this scripture in Matthew in Mark chapter 11 to open it up to him what it meant so God was training him what Mark chapter 11 meant he could not understand how that would apply uh outside of the atonement how that could could apply even though Jesus hadn't given his life yet and he he gave explanations for it he stayed away from it until the Lord began to open up to him what the new ministry was if you you study it a little bit more you'll see that it's connected to the third pool has the elements of it but it's interesting he doesn't really identify it as a third pull he just identifies it as his new ministry and how he had to keep climbing up remember when the Lord came to him and told him he would have a gift taken to the people of the world it would start with signs wonders and miracles is that right and then what did the angel tell him if you'll be sincere and humble then it'll get greater and greater you know what happens is if you get more Revelation and you don't get the humility with the Revelation then you got a bad attitude on you where you can be right but your spirit ain't right and it's very very it's more treacherous of amongst those of us who have the real word for us to fall in that trap because we do have the real word but if the humility doesn't come with it then there's a trap setting there for you to raise up and think you're better and no more than God and then even begin to correct the prophets mm-hmm so not just not just the revelation we need a thorn yeah amen we need a thorn the Apostle Paul had a thorn in his flesh through the abundance of Revelations and I sought the Lord to get this thing off of me Lord I'm sure I can serve you better if I all my bills are paid I know I can serve you better if they give me a a raise on the job if I make more money Lord of all my family and my my my all my friends and family and brothers and sisters are all saved I'll serve you better that's all you think but every one of us has a thorn job had one Paul had one the apostles had one Jesus had one yes and this keeps you on the road to Damascus this keeps you in the dust looking for God to purge out everything that's not like you know as he opens up more of his word we need him to open up more of humility not to see how big I can be how great I can be let's see how little I can be how less popular I can be we do things to be popular are we doing things to be unpopular yeah yes post those videos of ourselves preaching so somebody can get saved or so they can hear us preach y'all ain't gonna say Amen but it's true yet the same we're not in this to get popular we're in this to get in the Rapture to leave out of here with the changing of the body amen when I needed to have a bunch of friends we're not in there to be wealthy we're not here to be in no problems we're here to make the rapture the tribulation is not our getting out of here the Rapture is how we get out of here and if I was supposed to go through the tribulation I could have stayed in the denomination but he called me out under this great voice so that I can make the rapture right amen so let's take this new ministry just for a few moments amen amen amen so we know that there's a great persecution coming we talked about it we read about it a little bit let me just hit on that just a little bit on what brother Branham talks about the great enemy Rome he says this here get it for you here oh my Daniel had a vision and Daniel chapter 5. remember that vision of the end time Daniel chapter 7 and Daniel chapter 5 and Daniel chapter 2 of the image the head of gold and of silver and then the waste of brass and the legs of iron and the feet of iron and clay and that iron and Clay spoke of these are governments these are nations that ruled under the Gentile Kingdom can I get a witness and you know today you hear people just squealing and crying about communism and what the Liberals is doing to us oh yeah I know where exactly where I'm at this morning is this a red state or a blue state uh-huh and we get caught up in that don't we come on tell the truth shame the devil we get caught up in it and the preachers got caught up in it too and brother Banner says they would holler and cry about communism and he said it just made him sick that these preachers are talking about communism when God rose up communism for a purpose huh and he uses that in his hands oh my if I can get it for you here quickly all right it was a two or three of them I wanted to read for you but he says that God rose that up to to persecute the because of the filthiness of the Catholic Church here it is right here he says this in the message the seven Church ages 1954. he says now just as Israel come in it's Beauty back in the beginning under Abraham come down through the Patriots and then the day of Ahab it went into the Dark Ages darkest age of the church scene see went out there and in that time how that Ahab Mary Jezebel brought idolatry into the Orthodox Church the same thing that protestantism married romanism in the 1500 years of the Dark Ages in perimist church and come out with idolatry under the form of Christianity going on out into a lukewarm age that's coming on before us but the battle continues in the message uh the mark of the beast 1954 he says this paragraph 134 he says that's the red dragon the devil where's his seat at not in Russia in Rome said the devil give him his seat and his authority red dragon not Russia I hear great Minister saying that the Russian is the Antichrist why the Russian has nothing to do with the Antichrist that's communism the faultry of the protestantism and Catholicism has produced communism the reasons the Russians drove them out there because they had all the money had all the prayers said to them saints and so they built the biggest buildings had all the wealth of the people bundled it up like that and they seen me live no different it was not different from any of the rest of the world and they spewed it out and formed communism now if you get one more night if God does I'll prove to you that communism is working straight in the hands of almighty God to destroy the Roman and remember I say this is God's prophet the Russian Empire will drop an atomic bomb of some sort on the Vatican City and destroy it in one hour thus saith the Lord and the Bible said that God took them cruel-hearted men and put them in his hands and they were instruments in his hands to fulfill his will and to bring back to bring back to her exactly what she had coming to her continues on a little bit more and he says this here all right glory to God amen in the ten versions 1960 the prophet of God says this year in part of me I just to save time I'll take the greatest battle ever followed the prophet says speaking of Russia paragraph 55 in Russia I want to say this for the benefit of the veterans and so forth here and you Bible students what you fussing and hollering about Russia you don't hear me telling you to build a bomb shelter do you what you fussing about Russia Russia ain't nothing she ain't going to win no Wars she ain't going to conquer no world where are we at communism isn't going to conquer no world what's the matter with people can God's word fail listen it's on tape now to the world I speak and wherever these tapes may go and to you people here no matter whatever happens to me you believe this Russia communism isn't conquering nothing God's word Can't Fail romanism is going to conquer the world Amen it's in the greatest battle ever fought amen did you all get that yeah who's looking for it to come up there I was too did you get it Sis if you see her struggling help her out other says your student sisters help each other out back there Y'all Gonna Make me read this again and we stay late y'all see them in the back all right no hold on sorry sis God bless you they're a great help to me this in the greatest battle ever fought says I want to say this for the benefit of the veterans and so forth and you Bible students what are you fussing and hollering about Russia you don't hear me telling you to build a bomb shelter do you what you fussing about Russia Russia ain't nothing she ain't gonna win no Wars she ain't going to conquer no world communism isn't going to conquer no world what's the matter with people can God's word fail listen it's on the tape now to the world I speak wherever these tapes may go and to you people here no matter whatever happens to me you believe this Russia communism isn't conquering nothing God's word Can't Fail romanism is going to conquer the world so what's romanism romanism is a spirit of denominationalism it's Catholicism birthing daughters you can't get a witness and those daughters are churches right we're not talking about homie on the street out here doing all the problems we're talking about the churches on the corner causing all the problems and the romanism spirit will come together with this great Dragon to persecute the true bride to come after her and we know that we realize that and so brother banham gives us these things because he tells us you know what to look for you know where to stand and the message Look Away to Jesus he tells us you won't see it in manifestation greatly now hope you're with me this morning you won't see it in Great manifestation now but wait until the squeeze comes and he says now watch what I'm going to tell you now he says watch the third pool then so he's given us a time to look for and what to look for when you see this great Council begin to squeeze and put pressure that you can't pray for the sick you can't Gather in his name you can't you got compromise on your Evangelical what's Evangelical teaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost these signs shall follow them that believe the gifts of the church God still fills with the Holy the Evangelical teachings they want us to compromise on that but that's God's word that's the way his son is Born Into the family he's got to come this way but that's the pressure it starts you know with people giving you pressure and then it physically comes down to where they want to stop you from preaching so brother random tells us all these things all right can I preach on faith just for a minute faith Jesus said if you have faith the size of a mustard seed you can say to this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and then you can have what you've asked for huh this faith is this is this the faith that you know when Jesus came to this fig tree it wasn't the time of figs but he he cursed it for a season and he as as the prophet brings it out to us in the message my new ministry the Lord was teaching him how to operate this great gift or this promise under the atonement or outside of the the atonement of you say to this mountain and you can have what you say that's a strong promise for the Lord to give someone you know and what brother Branham he brings it in not to just the ministry let me take a a quote here in my new ministry here with the prophet of God says here in paragraph number 91 he says he says something like this paragraph 92 something said to me who do you think how do you see those Visions on the platform how do you see those Visions out here what is it do you think it's your own wisdom that you could predict something that would happen every time to the letter do you think it's you speaking would you think sometime when the Holy Spirit gets into the message and you don't know what to say what is it speaking then what is it when a man will speak with tongue that he don't know nothing about what is it that will interpret the same tongue neither one of them knowing anything about it is it the individual or is it the spirit of the Living God I said that that is true I see it it's God that's speaking and all the church needs is a step closer to him a more of a consecrated life to live with him go up to paragraph number 91 just quickly you see and I I got out after I was speaking there for a while inside myself just thinking until I become so unconscious of something near I was talking to someone and something said to me that's in the atonement for if a man or a woman is so consecrated and surrendered to God that God just moves in and uses their voice and it isn't the man speaking it's God that's him speaking so here brother Branham is teaching us he's teaching us this great law of the third pool and how it kind of works we have the properties of it huh we see it on display you know God's a god of order and the solar system there's laws and there's things that hold things together and those laws are already there they've always been there but great intellectual Minds will tap into that and come up with a formula and bring it to others so you can teach people math or trigonometry or how speed and how light works those are all laws now those same educated Minds today have turned and trying to make God prove himself when they're using his laws to prove what they talking about he quote something to you I heard from this Oxford Professor he John Lennox is his name he's a believing Christian but a professor he's a scientist that's what he says he he was speaking to a group of Oxford men on the truth in the existence of God it was really good and just a one paragraph he says at the rise of Science in the 16th and 17th century Alfred Morris Whitehead and many others commented that men became scientific because they expected the laws in nature and they expected law in nature because they believed in a law Giver ladies and gentlemen I'm not ashamed of being both a scientist and a Christian because arguably Christianity gave me my subject I'm amazed that it is serious thinkers today continue to ask us to choose between the god of science God or science that's like asking people to choose between Henry Ford and Engineering as an explanation of the Motorcar and I thought that was beautiful you trying to ask people to choose between Henry Ford or this great this great explanation of Science and there is no explanation that you have him before because of these great truths and science is there because of God any true any man that really studies the solar system he's got to say like Albert Einstein there is a God any man that really is honest you got to say somebody created this this is too orderly this is too purposefully this is too designed too well put together had to be a god and when you look in the mirror you gotta say the same thing there's got to be a god somewhere and he's the one who brought us here and he has laws and he has instructions that we need to know and how many how many of you preachers here how many preachers here today let me see you raise up your hand one only one preacher here thank you brother one preacher willing to raise up their hand let me give you one more chance how many preachers here let me see you slip up your hand two one two and the one I had didn't raise his hand I mean one two three four preachers y'all so scared out here today I'm not going to bother you let me see your hand thank you any preacher knows if you're a preacher today if the preachers can't help you brother Joe where you at I mean any preacher knows today you ask them well how do you know God called you to preach oh that's a powerful question where did you know he called you that's a life-changing question that's a that's a mystery that has to be revealed to that man and young people they'll come and say brother Israel how do you know you're called it's like there's something I had to work it out God had to reveal that something you have to open up that isn't you know you wake up and you get instructions on how to preach instructions to go and operate in the call of God it doesn't work that way it's a life it's a Ministry and then God reveals himself one step at a time can I get a witness preachers it's not an easy task and and when God is calling here the prophet he's calling the prophet into this great ministry of the the his new ministry questioning it didn't know exactly how it operate or how it worked he it took me since it was 15 years that the Lord had gave him this promise but he couldn't see this scripture in manifestation yet until my new ministry in 1959 he's out there trying to hunting for squirrels he's on a squirrel hunt not in church not all spiritual not in the suit and tie he's out squirrel hunting brother Banner makes a statement he says God came to him to confirm to him in his own way how he could speak to him and so God used squirrels and hunt him to speak to the prophet because that was his nature and let me say this to you Saints here any of you here God will find you when he's ready for you to do anything he'll find you and he'll roll upon you when you ain't expecting it and you think it's gonna happen like this it'll happen like that he'll find you if he's got something for you to do um and the devil will find you too so brother Branham is out hunting he said he gets up into there he's not getting any squirrels nothing was by nothing was out there he didn't make any shots so he finds a warm spot in the tree and he just as he gets comfortable and the nice the warm is in Colorado nice warm sun setting up on them wherever he was hunting I think it was Kentucky but he was a nice warm sun and it's setting up on him he's just thought he said I'll take about a nap I got about an hour before I picked the brothers up so I'll take a nap here so he sits down to take a nap and finds a comfortable spot and then this scripture comes to him Mark chapter 11. so God finds him in the woods where he's at to confirm a promise to him I want you to have that confidence this morning that whatever God's got for you he will find you you don't have to take nobody's spot you don't have to hate on nobodies for others to recognize you you don't have to put your name on any list nowhere God will find you all you gotta do is be what God called you to be and be grateful and be thankful and here's another one be faithful be faithful to what he's given you got a little Ministry there it's online I only got two followers be faithful to those two followers those of you that do that or have that well if I get a hundred followers then I'll be faithful no be faithful to the two be faithful to your family huh that's a that's a that's a congregation right there they're not supporting you you're supporting them but that's a congregation that can hear you every night amen so I need brother Israel's I need brother so and so I need reference so-and-so so they can get me to preach you got a home preach right at home five o'clock we have in church around the beans and cornbread right at this dinner table is that a Ministry or no huh don't despise the day of small things and there he is in the woods and the The Voice brings a scripture to him and this is Matthew this is Mark chapter 11. and as it begins to bring the scripture to him he was challenged about the this being under the New Covenant and then then that scripture that quote I just read for you he brings in that any man or woman that will consecrate themselves I'ma close right here they would consecrate themselves to God then the god of heaven will move in on that individual he said man or woman now that's the quote we read it right we're not talking about preachers we're talking about believer who was Jesus speaking to Mark 11. he's talking to believers [Music] whosoever says to the mountain be thou removed who's he talking to to believers amen amen and they would consecrate themselves then God will speak through them uh beautiful I like what he says in paragraph number 120 he says this here and well I stood there for about a few minutes I could hear no shooting around the rest of the boys around anywhere I happen to look to my back way up in the woods about 90 yards I thought something was on the stump and I watched it and after a while I jumped off and it was a gray squirrel so far all the way across the hollow up on the top of the ridge when they come along about the side of the tree I shot it it was about 90 yards and I killed it I said there's one I might as well turn and look this other way for the others because they're coming so he had spoken that they would be there he says he got one he looked for the others because they're coming see God has a way of bringing things to you that's the point I want to make to you this morning making you sure of what you're come on somebody is that is that deep enough that's too shallow God has a way of confirming his word to you the individual it don't work until you believe it it's not important until you can see it everybody else can shout but if you can't see it it's just everybody else shouting right right but God has a way of bringing things huh to you and he makes it personal to you there's a quick testimony real quick just a little of my own testimony here you know when when I come into into the ministry coming to the you know into the Arizona area there here and there's a great men of God that I loved I heard about him and I wanted to meet them and I remember I was I was at love divine fellowship at the time brother Baker is our pastor in just a few years here and I was out eating somewhere and I saw this great Minister from another city in town and he's a he's a legend and he didn't know me of course I knew him I knew of him great ministry I'm just a young pup as I say young pup looking up at the big dogs and I see this brother in the in the restaurants where I run over to him hey brother God bless you my name is so and so Ma I would love for you to come I'll talk to our the pastor I'd love for you to come and fellowship at our church and he looked at me and he said just like this he says well brother so and so is my friend and I'm here for that very cold shoulder very it was uh it's like if you didn't know now you know we don't operate that way you know that's all fun and games everybody getting along and you come in and you're inviting me but this brother over here is my friend and that brother where you at I don't really know him so I'm not going over there and you know it just shook my little mind I'm just a young pup I don't know who's Fred is whose friend I heard you preach I like your preaching can you come and bless us but no this is my friend and now it ain't my friend well you know what he didn't even know he didn't even know brother Baker at the time I don't I don't believe he even knew him man so I went back to my table at Cracker Barrel and the little pup was deflated a little discouraged I was like even to this day when I see that brother I got a little like kind of a little you know I love them I like them I really do a good great Minister big name big Ministry I he's an example I still look to him but I will never forget how he treated me that way but he doesn't even know that he did that but what he did was what it does is it makes you find an example that won't let you down and that's in this message right here huh it makes you find a position that's stable find a position in the word and stick in that position and God will come to you you don't have to go run under and follow a Ministry over there you don't have to go run and make friends with this one over here God will bring your friends to you God will bring the anointing to you God will let you find your place and then years later I I always look to other brothers I would bounce things off of them brother George knows what I'm talking about he call her you see something in the word you'll call this brother hey what do you think about that I heard what do you think about had a handful of Brothers like that that I bounce things off of or wouldn't say it but what I was doing brother Joe is I was asking permission to say Amen to what I saw that's how the Lord revealed it to me Israel you're asking these other brothers permission before you say Amen to what you read there it's that's a powerful quote that I just showed you a powerful quote you heard that tape how many times look at that quote right there and you go you kidding me say Amen yet you gotta go call Reverend so and so to get okay if he sees it that way then we can both say Amen together yeah you can't handle the word that way how about somebody you got to pick up your Bible it's got to be your Bible and when you open that thing you know there's a potential of an explosion to happen when you open that thing he might show you something that will blow things up in your life in everybody else's life but Lord show me your word that's all I want show me your word for my life does he have the freedom to show you more of his word mm-hmm and these precepts are being taught to us if we can catch the teaching from the way the prophet handles this new ministry of his it was his new ministry to teach us how to handle whatever God has for us that's new huh can you receive that huh the humility that he took the patience that it took for him to to keep listening to what God was trying to show him and to reveal to him and and like science has gotten to these laws and these algorithms and they can tell you how fast light travels and how fast you know how long it'll take you to stop when you're breaking and rain and how fast 55 miles an hour it'll go in the velocity all of those were laws that they got into that they took from God they understood it and brought it in and we have those laws this is God's word for us and the prophet has opened up this word so that we can make Mark 11 work in our life can you say Amen to that what is James chapter 5 tells us James chapter 5 verse 10 says this I'm closing right here foreign James chapter 5 verse 10 says to take the prophets as an example um take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for and what example of suffering of Affliction and of patience look at the patience the prophet had as God unfolded these things to him let's take this last one in paragraph 258 in my new ministry he says this here now every one of you not only ministers but all of you ought to pray for these people you don't know what God might do while you're in prayer for somebody else what if you'd say the right thing here's a woman standing here that's so sick they have to hold her up what if your prayer would be the right thing just like Banks said the right thing like Hattie said the right thing what if you would say the right thing your prayer to cause God to come down and do something see this is just not one person this is the Church of the Living God who everybody now everybody be in prayer so so let's take the title of that message What's the title of the message my new ministry can we say it like this everybody's new ministry huh because his new ministry will affect your new ministry and he brings all of this examples he's a prophet examples of spoken word in creation how God can get a man use a man with the scripture that Jesus brought and at the end he brings it to all of us I love that that's when it's interesting right the picture ain't proper until I can see myself in the picture where everybody at where am I at you got the family album out you're taking those pictures it don't get important to you start seeing yourself let's be honest you take out the family picture you'll be looking for yourself don't you or is that just me this is the family album right here you should be looking for yourself in there you listen to the message here the proper preaching on the third pool you got to see yourself in there some kind of way there's an effect for you as the seals open up and revealed these unclean spirits that were already there the seals open up it reveals the True Believer that is already there it's already in you you just gotta consecrate your life get into the word be patient be faithful be unmovable and let God bless you and keep you don't you love him thank you Lord Jesus for your word this morning God bless you let us pray Heavenly Father we ask your blessings upon each one gathered here today I know Lord there's a lot of statements made that some of the visitors maybe wouldn't understand Are Young young believer young Christian coming up but Lord there's a portion that everyone can receive a something from you and it's thinking of brother bank's prayer he made a statement that it moved you he said let's go tell that sister that used to give us bread let's go tell her we got saved and he just said that unconsciously he said it just like that he wasn't saying it to be you know to make something he was just being a believer and you came on the scene and you brought a great and tremendous it's greater than the law of gravity greater than that greater than any of these laws or these great great scientists of our of our of our day they've invented things to help us live better but your word is greater than any of that that they that they can invent but it's actually they're just discovering what you already had here but your word opening up into the soul of a man or woman and reading the scripture in mark 11. Lord set it off one more time strike it one more time Lord that we can believe these things are for us and as we walk daily humbly close to your side reveal more of yourself to us as our prayer oh God

Shine On Me just a little report from the service the youth service last night was a tremendous success in my opinion it's very great very nice brothers gave their testimonies it was a completely full house there at the Tucson Tabernacle the real burden came from Isaac Jr he was talking to his dad and and they were talking to me about doing something for the Youth and getting other churches involved and they wanted to get the Tucson Tabernacle involved months and months ago and so I was talking with them and I kind of I move a little slow on certain things it's not a credit sometimes it's helpful sometimes it's hurtful but I gotta move when I feel it and I just you know as we thought about it the motive was right the objective I believe was right and we talked and had a meeting with brother Dan Evans and brother Dan and the Tucson Tabernacle really took and put the whole their whole heart into planting it together they did a very good job I thought how many of you were there last night let me see those things it was a nice crowd nice service nice out when you say I thought it was nice Brothers brother uh Isaac Jr he's our good friend brother his dad their Ministry they're just one of my best friends there I see them every week I talk to them when Isaac got cancer it was like one of our family members got it remember that but he gave his testimony and he didn't know exactly why he but and I heard his testimony many times but he he gave a portion of his testimony as to why he said earlier this year he realized he needed the Holy Ghost and that it's time to stop playing Church he said it had a multi-purpose was it for his family was it for him was it for his church he kept asking why would he be diagnosed with a cancer Mass on his heart 18 or 19 years old served the Lord was helpful in his church never miss church out of all the people to get hit with something why would he get hit with it I asked the same question and he gave his testimony he did a wonderful job and I really really enjoyed him because I know them and and he's like one of us as he was giving out testimony just it brought tears to my eyes to think how God brought him through that and we could have buried him but yesterday we got to hear him preach and the anointing came down it was a nice service I mean yeah it was beautiful very nice nice atmosphere another young man gave his testimony of of going in the world and the Lord calling him and just did a really really good job and so I say thumbs up on that youth meeting I think it was a success and young people that were involved in that and so we thank the Lord Brother Isaac didn't get to get up and really say anything I really liked for to hear him Isaac Osorio he's a little shy about his uh his English he's not shy about laughing out loud though but um he's shy about speaking English like that but I really wanted him to get some credit last night because him and they really that was he kept pushing kept pushing kept pushing and I was like I kept thinking to myself Isaac that's what you guys want to do go do it but he wanted me involved into it so I'm like okay we'll do it and also glad to be a part of it the Lord the brothers from Las Cruces New Mexico friends in Phoenix those churches came and they sang it was beautiful so we thank the Lord for that we want more of that don't we amen God bless you let's
