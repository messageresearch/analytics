[3:18] we're going to read in Isaiah chapter 53
[3:23] for scripture reading
[3:34] verses one and two
[3:45] and the scripture says who hath believed
[3:49] our report and to whom is the armor of
[3:52] the Lord revealed for he shall grow up
[3:55] before him as a tender plant
[3:57] and as a root out of a dry ground he had
[4:00] no form nor calmliness and when we shall
[4:04] see him there is no beauty that we
[4:06] should desire him he's despised and
[4:09] rejected of men a man of sorrow
[4:12] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[4:15] were our faces from him he was despised
[4:18] and we esteemed him not amen we're going
[4:22] to be
[4:23] taking 20 minutes of this tape paragraph
[4:25] 252
[4:27] to 308 in the message
[4:30] God's hiding himself in
[4:33] Simplicity and revealing himself in the
[4:36] same amen as we prepare to go there let

[5:18] these blessings in Jesus name amen

[5:35] that all things are possible only
[5:41] [Music]
[5:46] oh
[5:52] [Music]
[5:54] only believe
[5:58] that all things are possible
[6:05] only me
[6:08] I bless you may be seated amen
[6:13] now
[6:14] oh I got to skip some of this
[6:22] from Eden
[6:24] from Eden it as uh
[6:28] uh Khan been prophesied that there was
[6:32] coming a messiah
[6:33] all the way from ease now I'm going to
[6:37] skip over a few of my scriptures I got
[6:39] wrote down here in notes just to get the
[6:41] message off in time if I can God hiding
[6:44] in humility now talk fast but yet I want
[6:48] you to catch this
[6:50] okay since Eden it had been prophesying
[6:53] that there would come a messiah
[6:57] it was foretold what kind of a person he
[7:01] would be we could linger a long time you
[7:03] know the Bible what he would be what
[7:06] kind of a person he'd be Moses said the
[7:09] Lord your God shall raise up a prophet
[7:11] like me
[7:12] they know that that Messiah was to be a
[7:15] prophet the kind of a Ministry he would
[7:17] have with him all the prophet spoke of
[7:20] what he would do they spoke of it as
[7:22] symbols and it went Plum over the top of
[7:24] the head and Plumb under their estwency
[7:26] one under one over the other one see
[7:30] by the time that he arrived on the scene
[7:33] of time
[7:35] the people to whom he was sent had their
[7:38] own interpretation of what that he was
[7:42] to be in their own imaginary
[7:44] interpretation
[7:45] the Bible never changed the Bible is
[7:49] always the same that's the reason I say
[7:52] the scripture says and I stay with that
[7:54] the Bible is of no private
[7:57] interpretation so Methodist Baptist
[7:59] Pentecostals don't try to put your
[8:01] interpretation you could have said it
[8:03] don't mean that it means this it means
[8:05] just what it says just exactly someone
[8:09] said how can I don't know how that's not
[8:11] me to say that it's God to take care of
[8:13] that he's the one who said it not me and
[8:16] he'll take care of his own
[8:18] but now look this Messiah being
[8:21] prophesied the prophets told just
[8:23] exactly how he would come what he would
[8:25] do when he comes but the own private
[8:28] interpretation of it amongst the people
[8:30] and what he calm he was in such a simple
[8:34] way in Simplicity until the whole church
[8:37] group stumbled over
[8:40] is that right amen they're those man who
[8:45] had been taught a man could not be a
[8:47] teacher a priest until he was born in a
[8:50] certain lineage
[8:52] that's Levi and this thing he is great
[8:55] great great great great great great
[8:57] grandfather was a priest laying right in
[9:00] that word in the temple day and night
[9:02] like the Catholic priests or the
[9:04] minister that's a handed down Minister
[9:08] from generation to the certain churches
[9:10] and so forth my great-great-grandfather
[9:13] was a Methodist Bishop my grandfather
[9:15] was a bishop and so forth see all that
[9:18] lived right in the word but they had
[9:20] formed their own way of it and their
[9:25] children had accepted it in such a way
[9:27] that the fathers had taught it until the
[9:30] fathers had taught her off of the real
[9:32] way and they've made such an
[9:34] organization out of it when the spirit
[9:36] controversent truth they couldn't
[9:38] receive it and that's the same thing
[9:40] today I don't mean to be rude but that's
[9:42] right it's the same thing today they
[9:45] make it so so complicated and some other
[9:48] way they teach her it's like it's been
[9:50] said God don't have any Grand children
[9:53] you know that God has sons and he has
[9:56] daughters but no grandsons and
[9:57] granddaughters every man must pay the
[9:59] same price and come the same way just as
[10:02] your father did so much you now so he
[10:06] was so simple when this Messiah for four
[10:09] thousand years every Prophet spoke of
[10:11] him David sung of him and all down
[10:14] through and when he come the people had
[10:16] their own idea built up what he must do
[10:18] I was going to do how was all explained
[10:20] brought out on church and everything
[10:22] until when he come in that real simple
[10:25] way it just it just ruined their
[10:28] theology see they didn't know it
[10:31] become according to the word
[10:34] now do you believe that God spoke to the
[10:37] prophets that that Messiah would come in
[10:39] a certain way it's too bad we haven't
[10:41] got about another hour we could go up
[10:43] here and explain how it was we all know
[10:46] how it was or most of us how God said he
[10:48] would come and how thou Bethlehem of
[10:51] Judy are that the least amongst them all
[10:52] down through there and I would do and
[10:54] what he would do see and yet he was so
[10:57] simple to those great Scholars had got
[10:59] it so mixed up till they missed it but
[11:02] you know Jesus didn't come contrary to
[11:05] the word he come according to the word
[11:08] but contrary to their interpretation see
[11:13] um he taught things that was against
[11:15] their ecclesiastical training about him
[11:19] now they said now for instance when
[11:21] Messiah comes certainly he'll come up to
[11:24] the templates that campuses or ever
[11:25] who's high priest I have arrived he'll
[11:27] come with a 10 million Angel salute that
[11:30] God will say all right fellows down
[11:32] there you're already a ramadi church or
[11:34] my people I'm going to turn the pranker
[11:36] and let the Carters of Heaven down I'm
[11:38] sending him aside to you this morning
[11:40] I'll let it land right out there in the
[11:42] yard and all the people get around say
[11:44] doctor so and so you and doctor so and
[11:46] so you all can stand at the head to
[11:48] greet him first you see that's perhaps
[11:50] something might be thinking today it
[11:52] sounds a little rational but I don't I'm
[11:54] trying to make a point and and there is
[11:57] that's the way it's going to be and if
[11:58] it don't come that way it's not right
[12:00] it's an antichrist
[12:03] if it don't come this that way it's an
[12:05] antichrist you see so it won't be and so
[12:08] then there'll be a then the next thing
[12:10] comes down will be about a 10 million
[12:12] Angel salute with their bands and
[12:14] they'll land out there in the yard where
[12:15] Solomon built the temple and all all up
[12:18] and down through here with this holy
[12:19] place where Saints and sages had died
[12:22] and so forth yes Jesus said you
[12:24] Hypocrites you sons of the devil he said
[12:27] you garnish the tombs of the prophets
[12:29] and your fathers put them in there
[12:31] that's right right
[12:32] how many righteous men and Prophets are
[12:35] sent to you and still you swayed every
[12:37] one of them see but what would he call
[12:40] Righteous then what they call Fanatics
[12:42] and cranks
[12:44] yes there they thought it would come
[12:46] that way but when he come in a stable
[12:52] bored of a a virgin
[12:56] we're just a common Carpenter for a
[12:59] foster father and a little unknown girl
[13:04] see not the high priest daughter or what
[13:07] more he he come as uh from a little lady
[13:11] that lived down in the in a little old
[13:14] mean country called Nazareth
[13:17] and just a common witterer his wife is
[13:20] dead he had some children Joseph and um
[13:24] and she was engaged and then he come
[13:26] with a black name to begin with they
[13:28] said he was illegitimately born oh my
[13:31] that hit their polish too hard
[13:34] amen
[13:36] their educational ethics cannot swallow
[13:39] that
[13:40] their interpretation of the scriptures
[13:42] know nothing about that but yet it was
[13:45] though thus saith the Lord
[13:47] [Music]
[13:50] Shivers me to think it and to see the
[13:53] same thing reoccurring again
[13:56] God cannot change
[14:01] that's already 12. yes if Charlotte
[14:04] stopper just oh thank you assistant
[14:07] still just a little bit still now this
[14:09] is I'm basing something here for a
[14:11] message coming see and I'll try to let
[14:13] you out just quickly maybe next 10 to 15
[14:15] minutes if we can God bless you notice
[14:17] now
[14:19] you're so simple that it it it just
[14:22] missed the mark for them but it hit
[14:24] God's mark
[14:26] see it hit the word he come just exactly
[14:28] the way he said but they their
[14:30] interpretation of it was wrong
[14:32] the interpretation of the liver and
[14:34] Moses time was wrong the interpretation
[14:35] of time of Noah was wrong see but God
[14:39] comes according to his word and then
[14:42] Jesus came in and he taught things that
[14:45] was contrary if thou be the Messiah do
[14:48] such and such as if thou be come off the
[14:51] cross and show it to us now see but God
[14:54] don't clown for people God just does the
[14:57] things that's pleasing and right
[14:59] they thought such a one or certainly
[15:02] have to come with a great salute of
[15:04] angels but he come by stable and to
[15:06] their own polished ethics it was
[15:09] ridiculous for an ordinary human being
[15:12] to think that almighty God the Great
[15:15] Mighty Jehovah who owned the Earth and
[15:17] Creed the whole thing couldn't fix a
[15:19] place for his own child to be born
[15:21] better than some cow barn over a manure
[15:25] pile
[15:26] how could there see what was it God
[15:31] in some Simplicity that's what made him
[15:34] so great
[15:37] uh see the ethics of Education cannot
[15:40] belittle itself like that
[15:42] see it cannot stand it but God is so
[15:46] great that he brought himself down to
[15:49] that not even of clothes to put on his
[15:51] own child
[15:54] think of it
[15:56] and the world there was no room in the
[15:58] end and he went into cow stable a little
[16:01] a little ledge a little cave-like back
[16:05] in the side of a hill and there upon a
[16:08] straw bed
[16:09] Supreme
[16:11] the son of God
[16:13] oh that was a lot different from meeting
[16:16] up there and his mother was uh to be
[16:19] mother she was found to be mother all
[16:23] months before they was even engaged to
[16:26] be married or even married
[16:30] she was to be mother and the people saw
[16:33] it and they know that it was this the
[16:35] way and Mary in her own heart she knowed
[16:39] what was going on
[16:40] and Joseph didn't understand but the
[16:43] angel of the Lord came to him tonight
[16:45] saying Joseph you're a son of David
[16:50] don't fear and take unto you marry your
[16:52] wife or that's not nothing bad but that
[16:55] is of the Holy Ghost
[16:58] let's settled it the man Joseph with
[17:01] such connection with God that God could
[17:04] speak to him but the day we get our
[17:06] ecclesiastical jacket so drawn around us
[17:09] so nothing can speak to us outside of
[17:11] the ecclesiastical group that we belong
[17:13] to
[17:14] I don't want to get harsh or a rat going
[17:16] to go out leave that alone right there
[17:18] notice but you understand what I mean
[17:20] notice
[17:21] the stable was ridiculous for them the
[17:25] Polish we don't even have a uh no record
[17:28] where he ever candid one day of school
[17:31] and yet at the age of 12 years old or a
[17:34] simple boy confounded the priest
[17:38] amen oh my why is it God hiding himself
[17:44] I feel pretty religious
[17:48] God hiding himself
[17:51] in a barn
[17:54] God priding himself in a little child
[17:58] see let's just go to display after a
[18:00] while though
[18:02] he had where he went on the streets the
[18:04] parents no doubt would talk and say
[18:06] don't play with that kid don't have
[18:09] nothing to do with him his mother is
[18:11] nothing but a common prostitute see the
[18:14] father and mother the baby was born
[18:16] before they were actually married she
[18:18] was to be mother have nothing to do with
[18:20] it what Mary thought but all together no
[18:23] matter what the outside thought she
[18:25] pondered all these things they hid it in
[18:27] their heart they know they couldn't say
[18:30] nothing about against it God speaks to
[18:31] his man sometimes say hold your peace
[18:34] don't say nothing about it I've had
[18:36] people in my meeting say well if you'd
[18:38] be a servant of Christ you know this is
[18:39] going on there sure I knew it was going
[18:41] on
[18:42] but what are you going to do when he
[18:44] says hold your peace
[18:46] don't say nothing about it talks Amanda
[18:49] and show them on a book something spoke
[18:51] years ago I said said well I couldn't
[18:53] understand I said you see there here it
[18:55] was back here got it dated and
[18:57] everything what happened back there but
[18:59] many people seen it on the book there I
[19:00] said it'll come to pass it this will do
[19:02] it this way and that way I said well why
[19:03] didn't you say something about that it
[19:05] had to be that way
[19:08] and Joseph no different he knows who
[19:11] that baby belonged to Mary known who it
[19:13] belonged to
[19:14] Jesus knowed who his father was what did
[19:17] he say I must be about my father's
[19:20] business
[19:21] not sawing wood and uh and making a door
[19:24] but about his fathers
[19:28] said that to his mother since you
[19:30] understand that I it's time for me to be
[19:32] about my father's business
[19:34] now I thought this little cracked up
[19:36] child any illegitimate child is kind of
[19:39] an odd cure saying anyhow and there you
[19:41] are see but God hiding himself listen
[19:44] God hiding himself and what was thought
[19:47] of the world as filth
[19:51] corruption
[19:54] illegitimate
[19:56] look God hides himself in the corruption
[19:58] of a dead seed
[20:00] to bring forth life amen
[20:03] do you get it
[20:05] God hides himself in a simple little
[20:07] warsh woman
[20:09] an ordinary man with his dinner under
[20:11] his arm kissed his wife and children
[20:13] goodbye and go out there and maybe hide
[20:15] himself in that man to do something to
[20:17] Archbishop but know nothing about
[20:20] no you're in blow no horns and send it
[20:23] out here God just gets Glory that's all
[20:25] the simple hear it in her glad
[20:28] now God was hiding himself in the
[20:32] Simplicity of a baby hiding himself in
[20:35] the Simplicity of a a common family God
[20:39] and the ecclesiastics and the great man
[20:41] the mind the genius and all of them the
[20:44] herods and so forth of that day and the
[20:47] neroes and they all overlooked it God
[20:50] how to use the place not quickly John
[20:52] the Baptist
[20:54] and Isaiah 40 we could get it if you
[20:57] want to Malachi 3 oh well yeah you mark
[21:01] it down it's going to Isaiah 40 all you
[21:03] know
[21:04] um uh speaking peace to the as it is
[21:07] maybe it might be good I I would read it
[21:09] right here if you got if you got that
[21:11] much time yeah just for a minute we'll
[21:13] turn over here in the book of Isaiah the
[21:16] 40th chapter and and read Jerry it's
[21:18] just see what he says about this now
[21:20] look here
[21:21] Comfort G Comfort G my people now
[21:24] remember this is 712 years look at the
[21:26] heading on there see 712 years before
[21:29] he's born here's a prophet speaking of
[21:30] him Comfort he Comfort ye my people
[21:33] saith the Lord speaky comfortable words
[21:36] to Jerusalem and cry under her better
[21:39] Warfare is accomplished that her
[21:41] iniquity is pardon for she has received
[21:44] the Lord's hands devil for all of her
[21:46] sins the voice of him crying in the
[21:49] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[21:51] Lord make straight his path
[21:54] in the desert a highway for a heart God
[21:56] in every Valley shall be exalted in
[21:58] every mountain and Hills shall be made
[22:01] low and the Crooked shall be made
[22:03] straight and the rest shall be made
[22:05] plain amen what a man that was to be
[22:09] see now turn over to Malachi with me
[22:13] the last book of the last of the
[22:15] prophets in the Old Testament ah in
[22:18] America listen here Malachi picks it up
[22:19] just to the end time story be sure not
[22:22] to forget it Malachi the third chapter
[22:24] behold I'll send my messenger and he
[22:28] shall prepare the way before me and the
[22:31] Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come
[22:34] to his Temple even the messenger of the
[22:36] Covenant of Who You Delight in behold he
[22:39] shall come and saith the Lord of hosts
[22:41] still speaking of John
[22:44] it's been my messenger before me to
[22:45] prepare the way Jesus spoke up in
[22:47] Matthew 11 10. so if you can receive it
[22:50] that's who was spoken of behold I say My
[22:52] Messenger before my face see that's
[22:55] right how how let's suppose when it's
[22:58] been for 700 years there was to be a
[23:01] forerunner come before the Messiah but
[23:04] when he came on the scene in such
[23:07] simplicity
[23:10] they missed him
[23:12] they missed him remember he was a
[23:15] priest's son well look how ridiculous
[23:17] that was for him not to follow the
[23:18] office of his father go back to the
[23:20] Seminary but his job was too important
[23:23] and nine years old he went into the
[23:25] wilderness
[23:26] and he came out preaching they missed it
[23:28] he was so simple too simple for their uh
[23:34] High polished education to believe such
[23:37] a one they thought when this man come
[23:39] how about all the high places will be
[23:41] made low
[23:42] all the Low Places be made High all the
[23:45] rough places be made plain uh David saw
[23:48] instead of the mountains skipped like
[23:50] little Rams and the leaves cut their
[23:52] hands amen what did it happen
[23:55] oh no whiskered God like that with no
[23:59] education at all with a piece of
[24:01] sheepskin wrapped around him came
[24:03] stumbling out of the Wilderness of
[24:05] Judaism repent for the Kingdom of Heaven
[24:07] is at hand and you bunch of snakes don't
[24:10] you think to say I belong to a certain
[24:12] organization God's name of these stones
[24:15] to rise to our neighbors
[24:18] well that's not him man we know that's
[24:20] not him but it was him
[24:24] is making the path clean
[24:27] amen see there's one of the rough places
[24:29] is made plain there's where the high
[24:32] places is brought down don't you think

[57:30] she said was heard as she poured her
[57:35] love for the master from her books of
[57:39] alabaster

[58:55] to the sin that had me bound
[59:02] and I spent my days
[59:05] poured my life without measure into a
[59:10] little treasure box I thought I'd found
[59:17] until the day when Jesus came to me and
[59:23] healed my soul with the Wonder of his
[59:28] touch so now I'm giving back to him all
[59:35] the praise he's worthy of I've been
[59:39] forgiven that's why
[59:42] I love him so much
[59:48] [Music]
[1:00:06] don't be angry if I wash his feet with

[1:12:15] our lord Jesus speaking
[1:12:19] to the disciples remember Peter had got
[1:12:21] the Revelation that thou art the Christ
[1:12:24] and then they go to uh
[1:12:27] a little further in and the Lord has to
[1:12:31] rebuke him or the spirit that was in him
[1:12:33] saying that he would not need to
[1:12:36] be taken away he didn't have to die on
[1:12:39] the cross and the Lord
[1:12:40] rebuked Satan off of him
[1:12:44] and in verse number 28 our Lord is
[1:12:47] continuing he says verily I say unto you
[1:12:50] there'd be some standing here which
[1:12:52] shall not taste of death
[1:12:55] till they see the son of man coming in
[1:12:59] his kingdom
[1:13:00] and after six days Jesus Take It Peter
[1:13:03] James and John his brother
[1:13:06] bringing them up into a high mountain
[1:13:08] apart and was transfigured before them
[1:13:11] and his face did shine as the sun and
[1:13:14] his raim it was white as the light and
[1:13:17] behold there appeared unto them Moses
[1:13:20] and Elias talking with him then answered
[1:13:24] Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is
[1:13:28] good for us to be here if thou will let
[1:13:31] us make three Tabernacles one for thee
[1:13:33] one for Moses and one for Elias quality
[1:13:36] yet spake Behold a bright Cloud
[1:13:39] overshadowed them and behold a voice out
[1:13:42] of the cloud which said this is my
[1:13:45] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[1:13:48] hear ye him amen that's what we want to
[1:13:52] do today Revelations 19

[1:14:12] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:14:15] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:14:18] Lamb is come and his wife have made
[1:14:22] herself ready let us be glad and rejoice

[1:14:29] of the Lamb has come and his wife have
[1:14:32] made herself ready this morning we're
[1:14:35] going to take a little message this
[1:14:37] morning on the Mount Zion Showdown the
[1:14:41] Rapture Mount Zion Showdown
[1:14:45] the Rapture let's pray Lord Jesus we ask
[1:14:49] your blessings upon your word this
[1:14:52] morning bless every heart
[1:14:54] Lord the stranger that may be in our
[1:14:58] gates Lord may you speak to them and
[1:15:00] help them
[1:15:01] and let each one receive a portion of
[1:15:03] the word for for their life we pray and
[1:15:06] ask in Jesus name amen I bless you you
[1:15:10] may be seated amen we've been talking on
[1:15:13] the Rapture the last two services and
[1:15:17] bringing it in
[1:15:19] with the um
[1:15:22] uh
[1:15:24] with this great third pool and we were
[1:15:27] showing to the church how sister Hattie
[1:15:29] Wright took that uh
[1:15:33] uh the Lord used the Widow
[1:15:37] and cause great blessings to come to her
[1:15:40] home
[1:15:41] by simply saying the right thing she was
[1:15:45] it was in humility how God used her and
[1:15:49] blessed her amen
[1:15:51] all right and he still uses that
[1:15:55] humility today
[1:15:57] God actually hides himself in humility
[1:16:02] he likes to find humble things little
[1:16:05] things that insignificant things and
[1:16:08] then he hides in there and then he comes
[1:16:10] forth and he reveals himself
[1:16:14] um through the very thing he was hiding
[1:16:16] in
[1:16:16] and this this great happening with
[1:16:20] sister Hattie Wright was
[1:16:23] um it brought about some questions to
[1:16:27] the Believers because this this was um
[1:16:29] the early 50s
[1:16:31] that brother Branham had give this story
[1:16:33] of the squirrels coming into creation
[1:16:35] and he's there now sharing this with the
[1:16:38] people in just a little humble setting
[1:16:40] after a hunting trip or after being
[1:16:44] around the Saints to pick up the
[1:16:45] communion wine for these little mountain
[1:16:48] people just humble people
[1:16:50] and then God is going to use this this
[1:16:53] little widow woman
[1:16:55] to to bring out something great for all
[1:16:58] of us she's famous today sister Hattie
[1:17:01] Wright amongst those that believe
[1:17:04] she I'm gonna shake her hand I really do
[1:17:09] she was something else and now out in
[1:17:12] the world now they wouldn't publish it
[1:17:13] the great Christian magazines and the
[1:17:15] great organizations out there they don't
[1:17:18] know who she is but we know who she is
[1:17:20] and was she trying to make herself
[1:17:22] famous or did God make her famous
[1:17:25] God made her who she was and she was
[1:17:28] just being who she was not trying to
[1:17:31] push into something not trying to make
[1:17:33] herself known not trying to get more
[1:17:36] than she deserves she was just being
[1:17:38] what God called her to be
[1:17:40] and that's what we want to be today
[1:17:43] now in in questions and answers there's
[1:17:47] a tremendous question that was asked
[1:17:50] brother Branham and
[1:17:54] it's in
[1:17:55] questions and answers 1964. I want you
[1:17:59] to get a load it's a loaded question now
[1:18:01] it's pretty strong for those of you that
[1:18:05] know the word this is paragraph 158
[1:18:08] question 248 and questions and answers
[1:18:10] so remember that he's had a few years
[1:18:13] now of bringing this testimony of sister
[1:18:15] Hattie and her two boys that received
[1:18:18] salvation and then
[1:18:22] um these boys were there evident taking
[1:18:24] of being baptized in water they were
[1:18:28] actively in the church washing the
[1:18:30] Saints feet I think there's one quote
[1:18:32] where brother random says one of the
[1:18:34] boys had his hands laid on brother
[1:18:36] Neville's head praying for him
[1:18:39] so you went from a teenager that didn't
[1:18:41] know the Lord and now you're worshiping
[1:18:43] with the Saints
[1:18:45] this was his mother that brought him
[1:18:47] into this to the presence of the The
[1:18:50] Fellowship Of God but look at this
[1:18:52] question here
[1:18:54] it's in questions and answers 1964.
[1:18:58] I gave you the first message to go tell
[1:19:00] but I want to take this one first says
[1:19:02] if we can get that up thank you
[1:19:04] now listen to this question this third
[1:19:06] pool and is speaking the word it seems
[1:19:11] entirely possible for you to speak the
[1:19:15] word and one would be completely and
[1:19:19] fully restored placed entirely ready for
[1:19:24] the Rapture in the Resurrection The Son
[1:19:27] of Man
[1:19:28] this is so or is it not
[1:19:33] and you would do this if properly
[1:19:35] pressed upon would you not Escape all
[1:19:38] these things
[1:19:40] and stand before the son of man so the
[1:19:44] scripture there is in Luke Chapter 21.
[1:19:46] so let's take our Bibles and read that
[1:19:48] script that scripture just for a moment
[1:19:49] Luke 21
[1:19:54] pretty heavy question though
[1:19:56] questions come from somewhere
[1:20:00] they come from somewhere
[1:20:06] and we thank God when you have a
[1:20:08] scripture or Godly question God has an
[1:20:10] answer for you if you need it if you
[1:20:13] don't need it he won't give it to you
[1:20:16] you think you need answers to everything
[1:20:18] but he doesn't give you answers to
[1:20:19] everything he tells you what you need to
[1:20:21] know I mean you know that's true amen
[1:20:24] amen can we be patient enough to say
[1:20:27] Lord just reveal to me what I need to
[1:20:29] know
[1:20:30] amen
[1:20:33] take each of yourselves verse 34 unless
[1:20:36] at any time your hearts be overcharged
[1:20:38] with Serpentine that's overeating and
[1:20:41] drunkenness and the cares of this life
[1:20:44] and so that that day come upon you
[1:20:47] unaware for as a snare
[1:20:51] or a trap okay shall it come on all them
[1:20:54] that dwell on the face of the whole
[1:20:57] earth watch ye therefore and pray what
[1:21:01] they say always that you may be
[1:21:04] accounted worthy to escape all these
[1:21:07] things that shall come to pass and stand
[1:21:11] before the son of man
[1:21:13] so this person takes this scripture Luke
[1:21:17] 21
[1:21:18] and ask this question to brother Branham
[1:21:21] that the third pulse speaking the word
[1:21:24] so what happened with sister Hattie's
[1:21:26] two boys sister Hattie Wright was a
[1:21:29] Believer her two boys were the teenagers
[1:21:32] that weren't Believers at the time and
[1:21:36] they were having a conversation around
[1:21:37] this great miracle that took place in
[1:21:39] brother random's life she simply said
[1:21:42] that's nothing but the truth brother
[1:21:43] Branham
[1:21:45] and and God came down and overshadowed
[1:21:49] the room
[1:21:51] touch brother Branham The Voice told him
[1:21:54] to give her what she wants whatever it
[1:21:57] is I give it to you to give to her
[1:22:01] and and it will happen right now it was
[1:22:03] a super anointing brother banham says so
[1:22:06] this widow woman she didn't even know
[1:22:08] what to ask for
[1:22:10] and she brother Banner what should I ask
[1:22:12] for what's your greatest desire what is
[1:22:15] your greatest desire well her greatest
[1:22:17] desire was to see the salvation of her
[1:22:20] two boys
[1:22:22] something Eternal something great
[1:22:25] and when she gave that request brother
[1:22:29] random says this now this is very strong
[1:22:32] he says I give you your two boys in the
[1:22:35] name of Jesus Christ I give them to you
[1:22:38] and they fell over right there received
[1:22:41] the Lord Jesus and the Holy Ghost
[1:22:45] changed their lives
[1:22:48] amen
[1:22:49] now
[1:22:50] this happening at spread throughout the
[1:22:54] message Community or those that believe
[1:22:56] brother random says that it happened
[1:22:58] with brother Ed Dalton was the second
[1:23:00] time it happened to a man it was brother
[1:23:04] Ed Dalton that the lord gave him his
[1:23:07] entire house
[1:23:09] and so now here is someone told me who
[1:23:12] this was that asked this question a
[1:23:14] great Minister but I can't repeat it
[1:23:16] because I don't know if it's true or not
[1:23:18] but it sounds true sounds like a
[1:23:19] minister would ask a question like this
[1:23:21] that this third pool speaking the word
[1:23:24] it seems entirely possible
[1:23:28] that you could speak the word and one
[1:23:32] would be completely restored
[1:23:35] fully restored and ready for the Rapture
[1:23:37] isn't that what we all desire
[1:23:40] isn't that the goal to make the Rapture
[1:23:43] how many here want to go into the
[1:23:46] tribulation
[1:23:47] how many here want to go on the rapture
[1:23:50] so our goal here if I was going to go
[1:23:52] into tribulation I could stay it in the
[1:23:54] denomination
[1:23:55] I could have stayed in a Baptist Church
[1:23:57] somewhere but I'm in the message so I
[1:23:59] can make the Rapture because this this
[1:24:02] message is a Rapture message we're not
[1:24:05] talking about salvation there's
[1:24:07] salvation on all kind of covenants out
[1:24:10] there there's all kind of people under
[1:24:12] this Covenant under that denomination
[1:24:14] that organization and they've accepted
[1:24:16] the Lord Jesus and they have salvation
[1:24:18] we appreciate that we don't look down on
[1:24:21] that when we make it to the other side
[1:24:24] and you have eternal life and someone
[1:24:26] else is in the bride nobody's going to
[1:24:28] be over there upset
[1:24:30] like I wasn't in the bride and you got
[1:24:32] an attitude because you didn't go in the
[1:24:33] Rapture I was only saved what you mean
[1:24:36] only say
[1:24:38] it's called eternal life
[1:24:41] won't you just be glad to be there
[1:24:44] absolutely it's eternal life and so we
[1:24:47] don't want to we don't want to minimize
[1:24:50] eternal life you meet a man on the job
[1:24:52] or a man out there on the streets and
[1:24:54] they tell you that Jesus saved him you
[1:24:57] should Rejoice with them you should be
[1:24:59] glad with them you should shake their
[1:25:01] hand and say God bless you thank God
[1:25:04] you're reading the Bible thank God
[1:25:06] you're on your way to heaven I mean
[1:25:09] there's something to frown upon that's
[1:25:11] something to Rejoice about because you
[1:25:15] can't be something that God didn't make
[1:25:18] you
[1:25:19] amen
[1:25:21] and so this third pool now
[1:25:24] um it seems entirely possible brother
[1:25:27] random that one could stand before you
[1:25:29] this great gift of the son of man could
[1:25:32] stand before you and you can speak the
[1:25:35] word to them and they would be ready for
[1:25:38] the Rapture now look at how brother
[1:25:41] Branham answers this question
[1:25:43] or should I close
[1:25:45] all right
[1:25:47] look at how the prophet answers his
[1:25:50] question
[1:25:51] see y'all can told me to keep going so
[1:25:54] program 148 he says this 158 says now
[1:25:57] dear friend see I think here that you
[1:26:00] you gotta you got a good statement yes
[1:26:04] sir yes sir now that would be so
[1:26:09] you said brother banham in other words
[1:26:11] here's what I don't think I believe it
[1:26:13] not polishing up what you said but I
[1:26:15] believe I can make it a little clearer
[1:26:17] to the people you are believing because
[1:26:20] of the spoken words and things like that
[1:26:23] that he said about and all of you here
[1:26:26] witnessed the squirrels and all these
[1:26:28] other things that's been done but did
[1:26:30] you notice that was sovereignly given I
[1:26:35] never asked him Lord let me do this
[1:26:38] speak these things in like that do these
[1:26:41] things that I never asked him that he by
[1:26:44] his own Divine will came to me and said
[1:26:48] you go do this see I wasn't asking one
[1:26:51] thing about it Moses never asked to go
[1:26:54] down into Egypt but was God that sent
[1:26:56] him down to Egypt now I believe that the
[1:27:00] Holy Spirit would come to me and say in
[1:27:03] a vision go tell certain certain person
[1:27:05] that they are trying to overcome a
[1:27:08] certain thing and they cannot do it and
[1:27:11] they're smoking they're drinking they're
[1:27:15] lying stealing or committing adultery
[1:27:18] whatever it might be or they got a
[1:27:20] lustful spirit and you just go where
[1:27:23] they are and say thou Spirit come out of
[1:27:26] there I set this captives free would it
[1:27:30] take place absolutely yes indeed that
[1:27:35] absolutely would it would take place but
[1:27:37] now upon my own presuming now presume
[1:27:41] means to Adventure without Authority see
[1:27:43] I go down to help this person I'm just
[1:27:45] presuming that it'll be all right then I
[1:27:49] don't know I can call the name of the
[1:27:50] Lord over them I can pray for them do
[1:27:52] whatever I wish to but I have my own way
[1:27:55] this morning
[1:27:56] brother better continues on
[1:27:59] paragraph 161 what would I do if it was
[1:28:03] in my power it is in I have the
[1:28:06] authority to do it but I have to wait
[1:28:09] for orders to do it see I have the
[1:28:13] authority from God to do it but now when
[1:28:16] he gives the orders she'd go back home
[1:28:20] well see I know that it's truth I just
[1:28:23] be willing to die this morning on that
[1:28:25] as I'd be in anything see that's the
[1:28:29] truth but first you see no one else
[1:28:32] Jesus himself said the son can do
[1:28:34] nothing in himself but what he sees the
[1:28:36] father do that doeth the son likewise we
[1:28:41] know that that's I really like that
[1:28:44] having the power to do it or having the
[1:28:48] authority to do it but waiting for the
[1:28:50] orders
[1:28:51] and there's things that God gives us the
[1:28:54] authority over over all unclean spirits
[1:28:58] and authority over circumstances in our
[1:29:02] home and even in our job and he gives us
[1:29:05] the authority we are Miniature creators
[1:29:08] and God made us in the image of himself
[1:29:11] we are Sons and Daughters of God and
[1:29:14] he's given us the power he's given us
[1:29:16] the authority but sometimes we have to
[1:29:18] wait in order for that to take place
[1:29:22] now our attitude
[1:29:25] is uh very very instrumental towards any
[1:29:30] of these promises it really comes back
[1:29:33] to our attitude
[1:29:34] you know in the Statue of the perfect
[1:29:36] man brother banham brings those Faith
[1:29:39] virtue knowledge Temperance brotherly
[1:29:41] kindness all the way up to love
[1:29:44] one of the virtues there is brotherly
[1:29:46] kindness brotherly kindness is put
[1:29:49] yourself in your brother's shoes on the
[1:29:52] matter it's empathy so like you know you
[1:29:55] put yourself in my shoes or I put myself
[1:29:59] in your shoes
[1:30:00] or the little sister or the brother that
[1:30:03] gets up here to sing for the first time
[1:30:05] and we we're looking at them with a real
[1:30:08] well put yourself in their shoes and
[1:30:10] then you would treat them better so we
[1:30:12] put ourselves in one another's shoes
[1:30:14] then we'll handle each other with better
[1:30:16] respect right put yourself if you're up
[1:30:20] talking and you're speaking and then you
[1:30:23] know or you're up singing and then you
[1:30:25] look out and people look like they upset
[1:30:27] at you yeah and then put yourself in
[1:30:30] those shoes
[1:30:31] and you wouldn't want that with you
[1:30:34] so why do we do it or why do some people
[1:30:36] do it
[1:30:38] huh
[1:30:39] you put yourself in your in your
[1:30:41] brother's shoes in the matter
[1:30:43] and this is what this is what brotherly
[1:30:46] Khan is these are what the virtues do
[1:30:48] and so this this Authority and being
[1:30:51] able to do something and then waiting
[1:30:53] for the opportunity to do it to be for
[1:30:56] God to call on you to do it you know
[1:31:00] there's an attitude there
[1:31:02] something to do with your attitude I
[1:31:04] want to read a quote for you here and
[1:31:05] brother random goes a little bit deeper
[1:31:07] about sister Hattie here just for a
[1:31:09] moment and then we'll get into this the
[1:31:12] Rapture because this person is very
[1:31:16] fully aware that uh you have to be ready
[1:31:19] for the Rapture you have to be dressed
[1:31:22] in the garments for the Rapture and we
[1:31:25] know that the Rapture is at hand we read
[1:31:28] the scripture that the bride has made
[1:31:29] herself ready is that right
[1:31:32] but here is a question that they're
[1:31:34] asking brother banham you could speak
[1:31:36] the word and someone would be entirely
[1:31:39] restored ready for the Rapture all right
[1:31:43] now in the message go tell
[1:31:46] he says talking about sister Hattie and
[1:31:48] those two boys they're the two little
[1:31:50] boys are probably sitting here in a
[1:31:52] meeting somewhere this morning are they
[1:31:54] Hattie are they here with you sister
[1:31:56] Hattie says they're in the back there
[1:31:58] and back in the back where are you boys
[1:32:00] raise up your hands where's the two boys
[1:32:02] there they are standing back in the back
[1:32:05] God bless you now what happened the same
[1:32:07] thing no matter what she'd have happened
[1:32:10] what she should have asked she could
[1:32:12] have had it she could have she could
[1:32:14] have it now I'm wanting to see that
[1:32:16] happen
[1:32:18] it's going to be the attitude of the
[1:32:21] people towards the message
[1:32:24] see how she said it she said just the
[1:32:27] right thing is what you say that does it
[1:32:30] what you say look at the sheer Felician
[1:32:33] woman when she come to Jesus Lord my
[1:32:36] daughter is grievously vexed with the
[1:32:38] devil thou son of David come heal her he
[1:32:41] said it's not meat for me to take the
[1:32:43] children's bread and give it to you dogs
[1:32:48] what if we would have what if he would
[1:32:50] have said that to some of us
[1:32:53] we say call me a dog
[1:32:55] wasn't nothing to him anyhow the big
[1:32:58] church is right he ain't nothing but a
[1:33:00] Holy Roller another Mother
[1:33:02] we'd have we'd have that attitude but
[1:33:05] not her she said it's true Lord you're
[1:33:08] exactly right but the dogs are willing
[1:33:10] to eat the scraps under the children's
[1:33:12] table that got him he said for this
[1:33:15] saying the devil has left your daughter
[1:33:17] for this saying it's your attitude
[1:33:22] friends
[1:33:23] did not he say you've got to believe it
[1:33:26] friends you don't believe me I'm a man
[1:33:29] but you believe what I'm telling you
[1:33:30] believe the message if you don't believe
[1:33:33] the messenger believe the message if a
[1:33:36] man walked in the room there with a
[1:33:38] telegram no matter who what the man
[1:33:40] looked like or what he was big or little
[1:33:42] you believe what's on the telegram not
[1:33:45] the man God sent me to tell you I have a
[1:33:51] message now how many of you could take
[1:33:54] someone calling you a dog
[1:33:58] well scripturally we can take it because
[1:34:00] it happened to that woman we know that
[1:34:02] she had great faith but could you take
[1:34:05] someone in this church calling you a dog
[1:34:09] and not carpet attitude with it
[1:34:12] huh
[1:34:14] it's your attitude and you know this
[1:34:18] these are these are the deeper things
[1:34:21] that you know we can know the seals and
[1:34:23] we can know the first second in
[1:34:25] Messengers and the last day that we're
[1:34:28] in but you know and still our attitude
[1:34:31] not be the right attitude
[1:34:33] he uses this widow woman on purpose he
[1:34:36] uses her situation in life on purpose
[1:34:39] because she had an attitude that she uh
[1:34:43] as a Believer she was connected with the
[1:34:46] ministry of Elijah and she believed him
[1:34:49] and that's that's our attitude today
[1:34:51] that should be our attitude this morning
[1:34:54] to believe the word that come to us this
[1:34:59] this day amen
[1:35:02] now this
[1:35:04] this getting yourself ready
[1:35:07] Revelations 19 7 we read there that the
[1:35:11] bride has made herself ready the
[1:35:14] question was with the spoken word could
[1:35:16] the spoken word speak to us and we be
[1:35:19] made ready I've seen two pitfalls or a
[1:35:22] couple pitfalls surrounding that
[1:35:25] quotation that I read for you that
[1:35:27] questionnaire
[1:35:28] you know there's some highlights in
[1:35:29] there in that question where brother
[1:35:30] Brandon answers and says yes that is so
[1:35:34] it's entirely possible brother random
[1:35:37] didn't openly dispute the Luke 21
[1:35:40] reference either standing before the son
[1:35:43] of man
[1:35:45] and ministers today will openly refute
[1:35:47] that or stand against that
[1:35:49] and then the ability for one man a
[1:35:54] prophet to have a word of the Lord to
[1:35:58] actually change a sinner to a saint by
[1:36:02] speaking the word over them
[1:36:05] and it's pretty strong it's pretty
[1:36:07] powerful
[1:36:08] but I've seen that Pitfall I've seen it
[1:36:11] go to where you have some folks that
[1:36:13] will follow this this message this word
[1:36:16] you know see the quotes they'll see the
[1:36:18] scriptures and they won't do anything
[1:36:20] because they're waiting for
[1:36:23] a one-time spoken word event to change
[1:36:26] this
[1:36:28] now is it possible yes it's possible
[1:36:31] absolutely possible but can you step
[1:36:34] over God's word and him not be offended
[1:36:37] by it
[1:36:38] he puts it in your power to make it
[1:36:42] happen in your life and you cannot you
[1:36:45] cannot discount his word you can't say
[1:36:48] it doesn't work
[1:36:50] you can't say he didn't mean it
[1:36:53] and because we're looking for a one-time
[1:36:56] event a get quick rich
[1:36:59] a one-time event to change us
[1:37:04] when it's actually he's birthing things
[1:37:07] in us as we walk
[1:37:10] daily
[1:37:12] we're adding more like a child growing
[1:37:15] like eating right like exercising you
[1:37:20] can't run a marathon after one day of
[1:37:22] exercise but if you keep exercising then
[1:37:25] we can talk to you about running a
[1:37:27] marathon
[1:37:28] if somebody wanted to take a diet pill
[1:37:31] they want to read a one-time video and
[1:37:33] it's the way it just falls off
[1:37:36] drink this drink it melt the fat away
[1:37:40] this just sheds the fat away
[1:37:43] and we run after those little quick get
[1:37:46] rich quick their schemes their scams
[1:37:51] but if you got hit with cancer or real
[1:37:54] terminal disease you're probably losing
[1:37:56] weight real quick too
[1:37:59] but is that what you want
[1:38:01] thank you
[1:38:02] okay
[1:38:04] look at what the prophet of God says
[1:38:05] here in the message God keeps his word
[1:38:09] paragraph number 78. but God was
[1:38:12] determined God was determined that his
[1:38:14] word would not return to him he was
[1:38:17] going to keep his word he has to keep
[1:38:19] his word he must do it in order to be
[1:38:21] God
[1:38:22] if he has to make a change of everything
[1:38:24] and by Grace he'll do it that's the
[1:38:27] reason I say if the church does not get
[1:38:29] herself ready that's your duty to get
[1:38:32] ready
[1:38:33] the bride has made herself ready the
[1:38:37] garments is paid for they're ready but
[1:38:40] you must be ready to wear those garments
[1:38:43] the church hath made herself ready now
[1:38:47] Brethren listen if the church doesn't
[1:38:51] get ready listen God is able of these
[1:38:55] stones to rise children unto Abraham if
[1:38:58] the Holiness people don't straighten
[1:39:00] themselves up and get back into the
[1:39:02] harness again get back to the gospel God
[1:39:05] will raise up he can bring Catholics
[1:39:08] Presbyterians whatever he wishes to he
[1:39:11] will do it
[1:39:13] few weeks ago Lima Ohio many of you some
[1:39:17] here sitting here know that was present
[1:39:19] among the Presbyterian Baptist and
[1:39:21] methodists they streamed to the altar
[1:39:25] they received and responded to the
[1:39:27] gospel much better much better than many
[1:39:31] times the Holiness people does
[1:39:33] we just got it in our mind that we are
[1:39:37] called by His holy name and Let It Go
[1:39:39] like that it means more than to be
[1:39:42] called by his name it means to live for
[1:39:45] him who died for you it's a life a
[1:39:48] consecrated life to God oh how we need
[1:39:51] back to the Bible
[1:39:53] amen
[1:39:55] and the message the marriage of the Lamb
[1:39:57] paragraph 53
[1:39:59] we know that there's going to be a bride
[1:40:01] there's going to be a wedding supper
[1:40:03] served in the skies that's just as sure
[1:40:07] to be as God is because it's his word we
[1:40:11] know that those that are going to make
[1:40:13] up that bride is going to be his church
[1:40:16] and they're going to appear before him
[1:40:18] without spot or wrinkles
[1:40:20] they have the material and they have the
[1:40:24] material on earth now to make themselves
[1:40:27] ready
[1:40:28] if you notice it said she hath made
[1:40:30] herself ready
[1:40:33] so many says if the Lord will take this
[1:40:35] evil spirit from me from drinking from
[1:40:37] gambling from lying or stealing I'll
[1:40:40] serve him but that's up to you see you
[1:40:45] got to do something they that overcome
[1:40:47] shall inherit all things they that
[1:40:50] overcome you have power to do it but you
[1:40:54] must be willing to lay it down see she
[1:40:58] made herself ready I like that word you
[1:41:02] see God could not push us through a
[1:41:04] little pipe pull us out on the other end
[1:41:06] and then say blessed is he that
[1:41:08] overcoming
[1:41:10] you had nothing to overcome you just
[1:41:12] pushed you through he just pushed you
[1:41:14] through but you've got to make decisions
[1:41:16] for yourself
[1:41:18] I have to make decisions for myself in
[1:41:22] doing that we show our faith and
[1:41:25] respects to God Abraham was promised a
[1:41:28] child but he must maintain his promise
[1:41:31] for 25 years the ups and the Downs that
[1:41:35] he had and the Temptation in those 25
[1:41:38] years but he held to the Word of Promise
[1:41:42] Israel was promised a Promised Land but
[1:41:45] they had to fight for every inch of it
[1:41:47] wherever The Souls of your feet Treads
[1:41:50] upon that have I given you God said to
[1:41:52] Joshua it was all there the land was
[1:41:55] there and God gave it to them but they
[1:41:58] must fight for it the same way it is
[1:42:01] about Divine Healing God has got the
[1:42:03] power to heal you if you've got the
[1:42:06] courage to accept it but you'll fight
[1:42:09] every inch of the way how many know it's
[1:42:12] a fight
[1:42:13] how many know it's a fight
[1:42:15] you know some people come into church
[1:42:17] and they look at Christians and they
[1:42:18] think well it's easy for you because you
[1:42:21] come from a two-parent home
[1:42:23] or it's easy for you because you was
[1:42:25] raised in church or just easy for you
[1:42:27] because you were never on welfare or
[1:42:30] it's easy for you because you live in
[1:42:31] this neighborhood or that or it's easy
[1:42:33] for no no no no no no everybody in here
[1:42:35] any believer any Christian I ever met
[1:42:38] that really has an experience they got a
[1:42:41] fight on their hand
[1:42:44] we look good but we fighting many times
[1:42:46] battles scars demons and Devils just to
[1:42:52] make it to church sometime just to make
[1:42:55] it to church it's a battle sometimes and
[1:42:59] we get in here we start to praise the
[1:43:01] Lord it looks easy but it's not easy
[1:43:04] it's a battle
[1:43:07] amen
[1:43:10] Brethren listen he says uh
[1:43:18] paragraph 60 God has got Amazing Grace
[1:43:20] to save you he'll do it but you'll fight
[1:43:24] every inch of the Wayne
[1:43:26] I've been behind the pulpit going on 31
[1:43:29] years every inch of that has been a
[1:43:32] fight constantly it certainly has but we
[1:43:36] must fight if we must Reign so we find
[1:43:39] out that the bride has to make herself
[1:43:43] ready be willing to lay aside every
[1:43:47] weight that does so easily beset us that
[1:43:50] we might run with patience the race that
[1:43:52] is set before us we must lay them aside
[1:43:56] ourselves we can't say God you come lay
[1:43:59] them aside for us we got to do that
[1:44:03] ourselves
[1:44:06] no do you have anything that you need to
[1:44:09] lay aside today
[1:44:11] huh
[1:44:13] you got to do that Lord take this from
[1:44:15] me the Lord said won't you give it to me
[1:44:18] Lord take this over force me Lord break
[1:44:21] me down and make me do it
[1:44:24] yeah he'll make you willing to accept
[1:44:26] him
[1:44:28] and you know you you got to be willing
[1:44:31] to lay it down it's true you can't do it
[1:44:33] in your own power
[1:44:35] but he told you to come unto you unto me
[1:44:38] all you that labor and heavy lady and
[1:44:40] I'll give you rest
[1:44:41] take my yoke and learn of me but my yoke
[1:44:45] is easy and my burdens are light
[1:44:48] give it to me and I'll take care of it
[1:44:51] but he's not going to take it from you
[1:44:53] and you don't want him to take it from
[1:44:55] you
[1:44:56] you have to desire him to take it from
[1:44:59] you and God has made it possible for you
[1:45:05] to get ready for the Rapture how many
[1:45:07] believe that the materials for the
[1:45:09] Rapture are here on the Earth
[1:45:12] what are those materials to get ready
[1:45:16] well I just read the quote for you that
[1:45:17] the materials are on the earth for her
[1:45:20] to get ready what are those materials
[1:45:23] it's God's word
[1:45:25] it's a simple service a simple prayer
[1:45:28] meeting
[1:45:29] it's one or two scriptures every day
[1:45:33] it's praying to him
[1:45:36] it's asking him to change you uh every
[1:45:40] day of your life step by step
[1:45:44] this is what these what these materials
[1:45:46] are it's the word of the Lord
[1:45:50] is what we dress ourselves with to make
[1:45:53] ourselves ready we don't dress ourselves
[1:45:55] with our own righteousness
[1:45:58] we don't dress ourselves with our own
[1:46:00] goodness
[1:46:01] we don't dress ourselves with our own
[1:46:03] ideas we take the word and then we dress
[1:46:07] ourselves with the word meaning where
[1:46:10] the word tells us to do things or not to
[1:46:13] do things we simply obey obey those
[1:46:16] things and that's how you dress yourself
[1:46:19] with the word
[1:46:22] now this
[1:46:24] these tools have been given to us
[1:46:28] now
[1:46:31] this this
[1:46:33] great truth of getting yourself ready
[1:46:37] making yourself ready for the rapture
[1:46:42] brother Banner preaches the message
[1:46:44] spoken word is the Original Seed
[1:46:48] and in that message
[1:46:51] I didn't give this to you sis but if you
[1:46:53] can find it for me he's talking about
[1:46:56] where the spirit told him to pick up his
[1:46:59] pen and write
[1:47:02] and
[1:47:04] he
[1:47:08] starts to bring in
[1:47:10] uh it's him riding by the spirit as he's
[1:47:14] writing this I forget it's like 20
[1:47:16] minutes or so if you were listening to
[1:47:18] it red
[1:47:20] it's also repeated again in the uh
[1:47:24] pergamist Church age pergamian Church
[1:47:27] age and the church age book a couple
[1:47:30] words are a little bit different or a
[1:47:31] little bit uh edited just a little bit
[1:47:34] but it's still where the spirit told him
[1:47:37] to pick up the pen and write
[1:47:40] and one of the things that he he brings
[1:47:43] out there
[1:47:45] is this here
[1:47:52] I'll get this for you here all right
[1:48:02] he brings in this
[1:48:04] these three
[1:48:06] great showdowns mount
[1:48:09] uh
[1:48:12] um Transfiguration was one of them
[1:48:16] Mount Carmel was the other one and then
[1:48:19] Mount Zion and he says this in paragraph
[1:48:22] 432 and spoken words of the Original
[1:48:25] Seed it might be a different number but
[1:48:28] if I just give you the first part of it
[1:48:30] it says so it's at this time in this
[1:48:34] country
[1:48:36] so it's at this time in this country so
[1:48:39] what is these what he's doing now he's
[1:48:41] he he's taking a scriptural reference in
[1:48:45] First Kings
[1:48:48] um
[1:48:49] chapter 17.
[1:48:51] and he's dealing with the
[1:48:55] Elijah
[1:48:58] on Mount Carmel
[1:49:00] so
[1:49:02] these three mountains we'll talk about
[1:49:04] just briefly for a moment and it will
[1:49:07] just finish up on this Mount
[1:49:08] Transfiguration and then Mount Zion
[1:49:12] so these three mountains in in the
[1:49:15] spirit he was studying the word for the
[1:49:17] sermon this sermon spoken word is the
[1:49:19] Original Seed is the five-hour sermon
[1:49:22] he got so caught up in the spirit he
[1:49:24] says that the word that the spirit told
[1:49:26] him to pick up his pen and he began to
[1:49:29] write he began to write as he's writing
[1:49:31] one of the references he gives was to go
[1:49:34] hear Jezebel religion and so you have a
[1:49:38] chance to get that it'd be nice for you
[1:49:40] to hear this portion of pick up your pen
[1:49:43] he goes through the beginning and and
[1:49:45] how the the seeds had to be planted it
[1:49:49] goes into the Garden of Eden then he's
[1:49:51] bringing it up to a type for our day now
[1:49:54] this is what the spirit had had told him
[1:49:57] to write and he says so it's at this
[1:50:00] time in this country
[1:50:01] that that person will appear for it's in
[1:50:05] the scripture and it's thus saith the
[1:50:08] Lord then in the latter rain there will
[1:50:12] come forth a Mount Carmel
[1:50:14] a showdown
[1:50:16] Bible fulfilled to the letter John the
[1:50:19] Baptist his messenger before his face in
[1:50:23] Malachi 3.
[1:50:25] planted a former rain and was rejected
[1:50:27] by the churches the denominations the
[1:50:31] Pharisees and Sadducees in this day
[1:50:34] Jesus came and had the mount
[1:50:37] Transfiguration Showdown
[1:50:40] so we'll wait for the sis to get it
[1:50:41] Mount Transfiguration Showdown it should
[1:50:44] come up in the spoken words of the
[1:50:46] Original Seed I want you to hear this or
[1:50:49] get this
[1:50:50] Mount Transfiguration Showdown
[1:50:58] this Forerunner of the last days will
[1:51:01] sow for the former reign
[1:51:03] Jesus will be the showdown between
[1:51:05] denomination and Creeds which is his
[1:51:09] word when he comes
[1:51:12] a showdown the Rapture of his bride
[1:51:16] the first was Mount Carmel the second
[1:51:19] was Mount Transfiguration the third will
[1:51:22] be Mount Zion Glory
[1:51:25] so brother banham is now bringing in
[1:51:27] these three mountains of in the
[1:51:30] scriptures the Mount Carmel Showdown the
[1:51:33] mount Transfiguration Showdown and the
[1:51:38] Mount Zion Showdown
[1:51:41] now this Mount Zion Showdown is
[1:51:45] preparing us for the Rapture it's the
[1:51:48] it's the final showdown so I want you to
[1:51:51] look at the Rapture as a showdown it's a
[1:51:54] it's a it's an event to come it's a
[1:51:57] happening it's event that we're looking
[1:51:59] forward to
[1:52:01] now in this pick up your PIN
[1:52:04] brother random says this here he says
[1:52:06] here's what I'm trying to say to you the
[1:52:09] law of reproduction is that each species
[1:52:12] brings forth after its kind according to
[1:52:16] Genesis 1 11 and God said let the Earth
[1:52:19] bring forth grass in the herb yielding
[1:52:21] seed and the fruit tree uni fruit after
[1:52:25] its kind in itself
[1:52:27] upon the Earth and it was so whatever
[1:52:30] life was in the seed came forth into a
[1:52:34] plant and thence into Fruit the very
[1:52:38] same law applies to the church today so
[1:52:42] the very same laws of Genesis 1 11 that
[1:52:46] every seed must bring forth of his kind
[1:52:50] applies to the church today now we're in
[1:52:53] a time we're in an age that we're
[1:52:57] looking for a rapture
[1:53:00] the Rapture of the church
[1:53:02] and the prophet of God is caught up in
[1:53:05] the spirit and he's told to pick up his
[1:53:08] pen he brings the law of reproduction he
[1:53:12] talks about Adam is the first man that
[1:53:15] his bride fell Jesus was the second Adam
[1:53:18] his bride fell but then the third bride
[1:53:22] in the last days he calls her beloved
[1:53:24] bride she won't fail she'll be ready for
[1:53:28] the Rapture I want you to take a
[1:53:30] scripture in Saint John chapter 5 just
[1:53:33] for a moment
[1:53:42] in verse 19.
[1:53:49] then after Jesus and said unto them
[1:53:51] verily verily I said to you the son can
[1:53:54] do nothing of himself but what he seeth
[1:53:57] the father do for what things soever he
[1:53:59] doeth these also doeth the son likewise
[1:54:04] for the Father loveth the Son assured
[1:54:07] him all things that himself doeth and
[1:54:10] he's he will show him Greater Works than
[1:54:12] these that ye may Marvel so brother
[1:54:15] random takes this scripture in
[1:54:18] um
[1:54:19] uh uh uh Saint John chapter 5 verse 19
[1:54:23] and he's bringing out the harmony
[1:54:26] between the Father and Jesus
[1:54:30] and brother Branham brings that Harmony
[1:54:33] through and says that this harmony
[1:54:37] must be with the father and the son but
[1:54:41] also the bridegroom and the bride
[1:54:44] what was the harmony the harmony was
[1:54:46] that the father gave the son the
[1:54:50] instructions of what to do Jesus said I
[1:54:52] do nothing except I see my father do it
[1:54:57] so this is the harmony that you and I
[1:54:59] are looking for this is the harmony that
[1:55:02] God is looking for with us notice the
[1:55:05] harmony I'm reading out of the church
[1:55:06] age book The programian Church age under
[1:55:09] the pick up your pen portions is notice
[1:55:12] the harmony of the father and the son
[1:55:16] Jesus never did anything until it was
[1:55:19] first showed him by the father
[1:55:22] John 5 19 this harmony is now to exist
[1:55:27] between the groom and his bride can you
[1:55:30] say Amen
[1:55:32] so this harmony is to exist between the
[1:55:35] groom and his bride amen
[1:55:39] he shows her his Word of Life
[1:55:43] she receives it
[1:55:45] she never doubts it
[1:55:48] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:55:51] death you help her out Scott in the back
[1:55:53] please I need that up please
[1:55:55] for it is the seed if the seed be
[1:55:58] planted the water will raise it up again
[1:56:02] here's the secret of this the word is in
[1:56:05] the bride so this harmony between the
[1:56:09] father and the son is the harmony that
[1:56:13] the bride needs with her bridegroom
[1:56:16] we are the bride and we're trying to get
[1:56:19] in harmony with the great headstone for
[1:56:23] the rapture
[1:56:25] this harmony is our garments that we're
[1:56:28] wearing our attitude towards the word
[1:56:30] our attitude towards you know these hard
[1:56:34] sayings our attitude you know that woman
[1:56:37] that was called a dog
[1:56:39] and look at her attitude yes Lord but
[1:56:42] even the dogs eat from the crumbs of the
[1:56:45] master's table
[1:56:47] you know it's our attitude that the Lord
[1:56:49] is trying to work on this morning
[1:56:51] sometimes we come to church with the
[1:56:53] wrong attitude
[1:56:54] we have the Bible with a bad attitude
[1:56:57] maybe even try to listen to a tape with
[1:57:00] a bad attitude
[1:57:01] but if you're listening to it and it's
[1:57:04] settling down in your heart your
[1:57:07] attitude will change right
[1:57:10] God will begin to give you the right
[1:57:13] attitude his thoughts his his his
[1:57:16] desires his motives his objectives will
[1:57:20] begin to influence you
[1:57:22] and brother Banner says notice the
[1:57:24] harmony of the father and the son
[1:57:28] it's noticing the harmony between the
[1:57:31] father and the son and that same Harmony
[1:57:34] must exist between the church and the
[1:57:39] bridegroom the bride and the bridegroom
[1:57:42] so
[1:57:44] are you in harmony with the word this
[1:57:46] morning
[1:57:48] are you in harmony with
[1:57:51] the message of the hour
[1:57:54] this
[1:57:56] great Rapture to come
[1:57:58] foreign
[1:58:05] looking for this great Rapture to take
[1:58:08] place
[1:58:09] the great Harmony is between you and the
[1:58:13] word that the Lord give you has given us
[1:58:17] brother Branham continues
[1:58:19] okay habit there there
[1:58:22] right
[1:58:25] notice the harmony of the father and the
[1:58:27] son
[1:58:28] Jesus never did anything until it was
[1:58:31] first showed him by the father
[1:58:33] this harmony is now to exist between the
[1:58:36] groom and his bride he shows her his
[1:58:40] Word of Life she receives it she never
[1:58:43] doubts it therefore nothing can harm her
[1:58:47] not even death now if you can think
[1:58:52] about
[1:58:54] the fear of death
[1:58:57] and that not being a fear to you if you
[1:59:01] ever run across a person
[1:59:03] that's not afraid to die
[1:59:06] then
[1:59:07] then uh you better leave them alone
[1:59:12] uh because because
[1:59:15] they probably lost it all anyways
[1:59:18] there's nothing to gain
[1:59:20] uh there's they've already lost and so
[1:59:23] it's like it's like the the team that's
[1:59:27] going in uh and they're a tremendous
[1:59:30] underdog
[1:59:31] I mean they already know they're going
[1:59:33] to lose all of the professionals know
[1:59:35] they're going to lose if it's a fight if
[1:59:37] it's a basketball game baseball game
[1:59:39] football game
[1:59:40] and you know you got this great
[1:59:42] professional team that's going to beat
[1:59:44] on this other team and the other team
[1:59:46] they know they're underdogs so they
[1:59:48] typically
[1:59:49] they'll come in there knowing they're
[1:59:51] going to lose anyways
[1:59:53] and so they have a freedom or looseness
[1:59:56] about them they don't you know they're
[1:59:58] not they're not trying to save their
[2:00:00] name or their they've already lost
[2:00:02] there's a scripture that's always stood
[2:00:05] out to me I think it's in um
[2:00:07] uh uh Deuteronomy 26 here if I can find
[2:00:11] it here quickly
[2:00:15] Deuteronomy 26 yeah I wrote it down
[2:00:17] actually verse number five
[2:00:20] and this is speaking about
[2:00:22] Abraham doesn't mention his name but we
[2:00:24] know speaking of him
[2:00:26] in verse 5 it says
[2:00:28] of course this is Israel coming out of
[2:00:30] the land and God is speaking to them
[2:00:32] when you come into the land these things
[2:00:33] will take place
[2:00:35] it says and thou shall speak and say
[2:00:38] before the Lord thy God a Syrian ready
[2:00:41] to perish was my father
[2:00:43] and he went down into Egypt in surgery
[2:00:46] on there with a few and became there a
[2:00:49] nation Great Mighty and populist
[2:00:54] so he he was ready to perish
[2:00:57] Assyrian he was ready to perish and now
[2:01:01] he's a great nation he he's great he's
[2:01:06] Mighty and the Lord has increased his
[2:01:09] numbers
[2:01:10] you know in when
[2:01:13] when
[2:01:14] you're ready to die that's when you're
[2:01:18] really ready to live
[2:01:20] when you're really sold out everything
[2:01:23] for the cause then you're valuable now
[2:01:27] like if you're you're trying to serve
[2:01:29] the Lord but yet keep your prestige or
[2:01:32] keep your name or keep your credit on
[2:01:35] what you had before you came to the Lord
[2:01:37] and all of that well the Lord can't use
[2:01:38] that but when all of that is dead
[2:01:41] and and when when a man really sells out
[2:01:44] and when he knows let's say he's got
[2:01:47] three years to live like Jesus did you
[2:01:51] know after he come through there he knew
[2:01:53] Calvary was in his way he reached the
[2:01:55] age of 30. he got three more years to
[2:01:59] live do you think Jesus is going to get
[2:02:01] upset about a business deal that didn't
[2:02:04] go right
[2:02:06] or get all caught up in the politics of
[2:02:08] the day no his days are numbered he's
[2:02:11] got he's got three years if you if you
[2:02:14] knew you only had a week or two weeks to
[2:02:16] live how would you live your life
[2:02:18] if you knew that your future you knew
[2:02:21] that it was limited then you're probably
[2:02:24] Shed off all of the other little things
[2:02:26] that are not that important and really
[2:02:29] focus in on what really is important
[2:02:33] and when he when the Lord now is calling
[2:02:38] Israel out and bringing Joshua into the
[2:02:41] land they had this fearlessness about
[2:02:44] them
[2:02:45] and I'm thinking about when this when
[2:02:47] this word to the church came it says
[2:02:50] that
[2:02:51] nothing can harm her not even death
[2:02:55] when you don't fear death and you don't
[2:02:57] fear your own Prestige and you don't
[2:03:00] feel your name of being embarrassed you
[2:03:02] don't have a problem witnessing the
[2:03:04] people
[2:03:06] the reason why we don't witness the
[2:03:07] people because we're a little
[2:03:08] embarrassed about it
[2:03:10] or they might say no well they told
[2:03:12] Jesus no
[2:03:14] the reason why we don't go is because
[2:03:16] there's a fear that we might we might
[2:03:18] look you know we might look like a
[2:03:20] fanatic and of course we don't want to
[2:03:22] look like that
[2:03:24] you know we want to keep ourselves
[2:03:26] reserved we want to look decent we're
[2:03:28] going to look like we got our head on
[2:03:29] our shoulders we're gonna look we want
[2:03:32] to keep our our sanity we don't want to
[2:03:35] look crazy
[2:03:37] but if the reality of the day ever
[2:03:40] really struck us then we would probably
[2:03:42] hit the streets running telling people
[2:03:46] about the hour that we live in like with
[2:03:50] Noah the days of Noah and the time
[2:03:52] approaching us for the rapture
[2:03:56] and so brother Madam goes into Joshua a
[2:03:59] little bit in this
[2:04:02] in this word of picking up your pit he
[2:04:05] says let us stand like Joshua
[2:04:08] let us stand like Caleb how did Joshua
[2:04:12] stand
[2:04:13] what did Joshua do look at the message
[2:04:16] here
[2:04:18] um as I was with Moses
[2:04:21] he says this here
[2:04:23] September 1960 paragraph number 49 he
[2:04:26] says now Joshua and all of this knowing
[2:04:30] that the command was great but having
[2:04:32] the Assurance he could be Fearless
[2:04:36] he could be as we call it Reckless
[2:04:40] as long as he was pointed in the right
[2:04:43] way
[2:04:44] he might break up against the hill that
[2:04:46] would knock him backwards but he was
[2:04:48] carried the right way
[2:04:50] so can the Church of the Living God be
[2:04:54] Reckless and fearless in faith if we're
[2:04:59] pointed the right way
[2:05:01] for he said as I was with Moses I'll be
[2:05:03] with you
[2:05:04] I'll not fail you nor forsake you he
[2:05:08] never forsaken Moses he never felt Moses
[2:05:12] he will not fail Joshua he will not fail
[2:05:16] us he will be with us and we find Joshua
[2:05:21] to take this commission knowing that the
[2:05:23] responsibility was leading them through
[2:05:25] the lands now they had uh he'd have to
[2:05:28] go over into the other land he'd have to
[2:05:30] set up their Kingdom he'd have to divide
[2:05:33] the inheritance among them he know the
[2:05:35] commission was tremendous far more than
[2:05:38] what Moses had done Joshua had more to
[2:05:41] do than Moses had to do another thing he
[2:05:44] was to lead them along the border
[2:05:46] amongst their brethren
[2:05:49] and they already tasted blood he had to
[2:05:52] conquer them he had to keep them quiet
[2:05:55] as they marched on so it is today with
[2:05:58] this new Pentecostal group that's Rising
[2:06:01] now they've tasted denominationalism
[2:06:03] it's so hard to keep them down
[2:06:06] my brother random is bringing this
[2:06:08] Joshua and then at the church can be
[2:06:12] Reckless and fearless in faith
[2:06:18] amen we can be Fearless in faith because
[2:06:21] as he stood with Moses he's going to
[2:06:23] stand with us as he was with Christ
[2:06:26] he'll stand with the church and notice
[2:06:29] the harmony between God and his son the
[2:06:32] Lord Jesus that Harmony should be
[2:06:35] between the bridegroom and the bride
[2:06:39] this is where we're walking to Saints
[2:06:41] we're walking in harmony with the word
[2:06:45] for the rapture
[2:06:47] you know in that law of reproduction
[2:06:50] brother random says the same law applies
[2:06:54] to the church
[2:06:55] he says that there that through this
[2:06:58] word coming to the church will produce a
[2:07:01] super Church a super race as we journey
[2:07:05] to the headstone we will be it is very
[2:07:08] image I want you to think of that coming
[2:07:11] into his very image
[2:07:13] you see the super church and the super
[2:07:17] race how many has heard of this
[2:07:19] artificial intelligence today
[2:07:22] AI they call it
[2:07:24] and even the great creators of it are
[2:07:27] telling them they're going too fast
[2:07:28] they're going too far
[2:07:31] it's scary it's it's crazy what they're
[2:07:34] capable of doing what the technology is
[2:07:37] doing and I was thinking that you know
[2:07:39] no one can hide
[2:07:41] no one can run they know who you are
[2:07:44] they know where you are
[2:07:46] and but there's no intelligence higher
[2:07:50] than the intelligence of God
[2:07:53] and the AI I don't care if it's a
[2:07:56] computer or whatever it is can never
[2:07:58] compete against the gifts of the Spirit
[2:08:01] or a gift of God
[2:08:04] you see the Lord is placed in the church
[2:08:07] these protections to keep us clean
[2:08:12] to keep the word presented before us
[2:08:15] because the word is with the image that
[2:08:16] we're coming into
[2:08:18] and we he's going to Rapture a church
[2:08:20] that has no spot no blemish or no
[2:08:25] wrinkle it's the word that makes us
[2:08:30] fully restored and redeemed and ready
[2:08:32] for the rapture
[2:08:34] it's the word that we're dressing
[2:08:36] ourselves with now
[2:08:38] in the exposition of the seven Church
[2:08:40] ages brother banham says this here right
[2:08:42] down to the time he's cast to the Lake
[2:08:44] of Fire he fights that he cannot stand
[2:08:48] it he's talking about Revelation to the
[2:08:50] believer he knows that if the people get
[2:08:52] a true revelation of the true church and
[2:08:56] what she is what she stands for and that
[2:08:59] she can do the Greater Works she will be
[2:09:02] an invincible Army
[2:09:06] if they get a true revelation of the two
[2:09:08] Spirits within the framework of the
[2:09:10] Christian church and by God's spirit
[2:09:12] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[2:09:15] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[2:09:19] her
[2:09:20] how many thank God for that
[2:09:22] that that there is there is an
[2:09:26] invincible Army rising up
[2:09:30] that's in The Believer that's the
[2:09:33] fearlessness that's the recklessness
[2:09:36] when you're pointed in the right
[2:09:38] direction that's the no man will be able
[2:09:41] to stand before you Joshua all the days
[2:09:44] of your life could you imagine going
[2:09:47] into battle knowing that no man can
[2:09:50] stand before you all the days of your
[2:09:51] life
[2:09:52] that put courage there
[2:09:55] that pushing them forward into this
[2:09:58] great ministry and where are we headed
[2:10:00] to now we're headed to this great
[2:10:03] rapture
[2:10:04] the Rapture is the great Showdown can I
[2:10:08] get a witness
[2:10:09] hey man can I help you help me finish
[2:10:11] this sermon here this morning oh my
[2:10:15] God I need a little help
[2:10:17] okay
[2:10:19] but Jesus is my helper
[2:10:22] if you ever get any help it comes from
[2:10:24] the Lord remember that
[2:10:26] now what happened at this Mount
[2:10:28] Transfiguration so we're going to close
[2:10:30] here just in a moment
[2:10:33] Mount Transfiguration
[2:10:37] going into
[2:10:39] my 17. Jesus tells these all of his
[2:10:43] disciples now some of you are standing
[2:10:45] here that will not taste death
[2:10:48] now it doesn't interpret to them what
[2:10:50] he's going to do he doesn't show them
[2:10:52] there's just three of you it doesn't
[2:10:55] tell them it's tomorrow or next week but
[2:10:58] six days later he pulls these three
[2:11:01] aside Peter James and John
[2:11:05] and then pulling them the side he takes
[2:11:09] them up on a high mountain and this
[2:11:11] mountain is called Mount Transfiguration
[2:11:16] now Mount Transfiguration is a literal
[2:11:20] place yes also it is an experience
[2:11:24] that's about to happen
[2:11:26] and it's going to show and type you know
[2:11:29] where does it type out today for us just
[2:11:32] like Elijah in the Old Testament with
[2:11:34] the Widow just like like what Joshua
[2:11:37] with Caleb in the Old Testament it had a
[2:11:40] spiritual background brother Adam said
[2:11:41] he told us to stand like them here we
[2:11:44] are today but he's referencing us to go
[2:11:47] back like Joshua and Caleb and stand
[2:11:49] like Joshua and Caleb as you see the
[2:11:53] promised land approaching that's what he
[2:11:55] tells him this is in the word to the
[2:11:57] church he tells the people stand like
[2:11:59] Joshua and Caleb as you see the promised
[2:12:02] land approaching that's the word to you
[2:12:04] and I
[2:12:05] now he brings up Dayton and Korah and
[2:12:08] Nathan and Cora will try to get the
[2:12:10] people sidetracked to something else to
[2:12:13] believe something else and that same
[2:12:15] thing is repeating today you're supposed
[2:12:17] to repeat today but in Matthew chapter
[2:12:19] 17
[2:12:21] Jesus transfigures himself before them
[2:12:25] here stands Moses from the Old Testament
[2:12:29] here's Elijah from the Old Testament and
[2:12:33] Peter James and John three Witnesses
[2:12:35] brother Vamp tells us this is our lord
[2:12:37] Jesus now being adopted and placed
[2:12:43] he now his name on the check is as good
[2:12:46] as the father
[2:12:48] just
[2:12:49] Moses the law and the righteousness of
[2:12:53] the prophets but here he him
[2:12:56] now Jesus is receiving his full
[2:12:59] Authority
[2:13:01] in the spoken word is the Original Seed
[2:13:03] and in the message that we were reading
[2:13:06] out of for you in the pergame church age
[2:13:09] he brings this Transfiguration Mountain
[2:13:12] into view
[2:13:16] and here's what he says in the message
[2:13:19] the Easter cereal seal uh 1965 paragraph
[2:13:24] 246.
[2:13:26] look now at Transfiguration just before
[2:13:30] we close transfigure
[2:13:32] Transfiguration we are all represented
[2:13:35] there in Transfiguration
[2:13:38] look what we are seeing today notice
[2:13:41] just what we're seeing today the
[2:13:43] quickening power of God
[2:13:45] we was all there there was the dead
[2:13:49] Saints represented in Moses there was
[2:13:52] the resurrection in Jesus Christ
[2:13:54] glorified Elijah Moses Elijah and Jesus
[2:13:58] all standing on the mountain the dead
[2:14:02] Saints the raptured Saints in Jesus
[2:14:05] glorified oh mine well you say I heard a
[2:14:08] guy say they'll say you people well if
[2:14:12] you had this kind of a power you ought
[2:14:14] to go and tell people what you can do
[2:14:16] far be it from a real Christian saying a
[2:14:19] thing like that see surely we don't
[2:14:22] claim no power but we do one thing when
[2:14:27] they look around with all the power upon
[2:14:30] them they saw Jesus only
[2:14:33] and the real True Believer don't care
[2:14:35] whether he's backing up a denomination
[2:14:37] or nothing about it he only wants one
[2:14:40] thing for you to see that glorify Christ
[2:14:44] makes a difference a real true Mount
[2:14:48] Transfiguration experience only
[2:14:51] glorifies
[2:14:53] Jesus Christ
[2:14:55] it didn't glorify Moses it didn't
[2:14:58] glorify Elijah didn't glorify themselves
[2:15:01] didn't glorify nothing else but they
[2:15:05] sing the glorified Christ and any True
[2:15:08] Believer that's what's in his heart to
[2:15:11] glorify Jesus Christ that's what he's
[2:15:14] trying to get to the people to see
[2:15:19] now we all need this Transfiguration
[2:15:21] experience the mount Transfiguration
[2:15:24] experience is when you can't see this
[2:15:28] that or yourself you see Jesus only now
[2:15:32] what took place in this Mount
[2:15:34] Transfiguration experience
[2:15:37] this was Moses typed the
[2:15:40] saints that would taste death
[2:15:44] Elijah typed the saints that would not
[2:15:47] taste death can I get a witness
[2:15:50] now there's some of us here
[2:15:52] that are going to taste death
[2:15:55] no doubt if time continues
[2:15:57] is that right
[2:15:59] all of our loved ones have tasted death
[2:16:01] those of us that have Believers that
[2:16:03] have gone on
[2:16:04] just look back the age of the Believers
[2:16:07] you know the brother Neville's uh
[2:16:09] brother brother brother Branham himself
[2:16:12] and all of the fine saints that we've
[2:16:15] known in this age that have tasted death
[2:16:17] they were represented under Moses
[2:16:21] this is Moses now these are the True
[2:16:24] Believers that would taste death now
[2:16:27] I don't know if I'm going to taste death
[2:16:31] do you know if you're going to taste
[2:16:32] death
[2:16:34] we don't know
[2:16:36] but there is another group there that's
[2:16:38] the the Elijah group they're represented
[2:16:41] and those that do not taste death that
[2:16:45] will be changed in the moment in the
[2:16:48] twinkling of an eye for to be made ready
[2:16:50] for the Rapture you know Adam in the
[2:16:54] Garden of Eden he didn't he wasn't born
[2:16:57] in a body like this brother random says
[2:16:59] that when he was put into flesh
[2:17:02] Genesis 1 22 or Genesis 2 that's when
[2:17:06] this his senses came into him in the
[2:17:08] flesh man see taste feels smell in here
[2:17:11] but he wasn't born in sin
[2:17:15] right
[2:17:16] he he didn't come to the world speaking
[2:17:19] lies he was a spoken word creation
[2:17:24] and he was a real man a son of God
[2:17:30] and he had the power of Creation in his
[2:17:33] hands and God used him to name the
[2:17:36] animal kingdom
[2:17:38] from his side comes his bride Eve that
[2:17:42] God give her as a byproduct but he left
[2:17:46] All That Glory his glorified condition
[2:17:49] never lied never sinned never did
[2:17:52] anything wrong he left all of that when
[2:17:55] he saw his wife contaminated with sin
[2:17:59] did he do he he put aside his glory and
[2:18:03] he took her in and partook of the fruit
[2:18:06] and now God made a way of redemption for
[2:18:09] his bride Eve to come in
[2:18:12] tremendous love story wouldn't you say
[2:18:15] he could have started a new he could
[2:18:18] have took another rib if he needed to
[2:18:20] and make him another Eve part two or Eve
[2:18:24] 2.0
[2:18:26] but no that's not what he did he took he
[2:18:28] fell and he goes in and he redeems Eve
[2:18:32] because it was bone of his bone and
[2:18:35] flesh of his flesh
[2:18:37] amen what about Moses what about Moses
[2:18:40] remember when the people they tempted
[2:18:42] the Lord ten times they brought him
[2:18:45] through the Red Sea complained the water
[2:18:46] ain't sweet enough complain ain't got no
[2:18:48] meat complaining ain't got no guard
[2:18:50] complain complain complain complain
[2:18:52] complain until God says you know what
[2:18:54] I'm gonna cancel all these people and
[2:18:57] Moses with you I'll start a new people
[2:19:02] and I'll make them popular I'll make
[2:19:04] them great I'll make them famous and
[2:19:06] what did Moses do he threw himself in
[2:19:08] the breach
[2:19:09] he threw himself in the Gap he says no
[2:19:11] Lord
[2:19:13] but the people will say
[2:19:15] he wasn't able to bring them out you
[2:19:17] brought them out but you wasn't able to
[2:19:19] take them all the way in the Lord
[2:19:20] listened to Moses
[2:19:22] and brought
[2:19:23] Redemption to all of Israel aren't you
[2:19:26] thankful for that
[2:19:27] and what about us today think of it
[2:19:30] think of the grace that God has shown
[2:19:34] Upon Us in this last days
[2:19:38] to think we were so holy or so right or
[2:19:42] we deserve the revelation of the Rapture
[2:19:45] oh my that's just the wrong attitude
[2:19:47] it's not the right attitude at all we
[2:19:50] didn't deserve no rap the revelation of
[2:19:52] the rapture
[2:19:53] we didn't deserve to live today
[2:19:57] but his grace overshadowed us
[2:20:01] our names are written in him before the
[2:20:03] foundation of the world and he called
[2:20:05] our names forward and even in our
[2:20:08] mistakes Even in our faults Even in our
[2:20:11] failures he still
[2:20:13] claimed his blood over us and here we
[2:20:16] are today a part of his bride
[2:20:19] oh we thank God for it don't we
[2:20:22] and this Transfiguration experience
[2:20:27] expresses to the people it's it we're
[2:20:30] all represented there Moses the sleeping
[2:20:32] Saints Elijah the slang the saints that
[2:20:35] don't taste death some of us may be here
[2:20:40] today
[2:20:41] will never taste that there's a group
[2:20:43] it's possible Right
[2:20:45] it's possible that some of us or all of
[2:20:47] us could taste death within the next
[2:20:49] hour or so we don't know but the point
[2:20:51] of it is am I ready to go
[2:20:55] if I do taste the death so we're all
[2:20:58] represented in there
[2:21:00] and what's that representation is not
[2:21:03] this one not that one not the past not
[2:21:04] the future not this holy man not that
[2:21:06] one it's all about Jesus
[2:21:09] amen
[2:21:11] God's provided place of worship this is
[2:21:13] my last quote he says we claim no glory
[2:21:16] of our own paragraph 214. We claim no
[2:21:19] glory of our own like on Mount
[2:21:21] Transfiguration where every one of us is
[2:21:24] represented there
[2:21:25] there was Moses the one that died and
[2:21:27] raised again there was Elijah the
[2:21:30] quickening Saints that'll be caught up
[2:21:31] at the last day oh they sing then when
[2:21:35] they look back they sing Jesus Only We
[2:21:38] Know Lord we don't want people to see us
[2:21:41] we're not here for that purpose far be
[2:21:44] it but Lord it does delight our hearts
[2:21:47] when we see Jesus glorified Among Us
[2:21:50] when we see him glorify when we see his
[2:21:53] word which he is the word when we see we
[2:21:57] can read it here in the Bible where he
[2:21:59] promised he would do it to see him work
[2:22:02] it right in us oh God how it makes us
[2:22:05] feel humble that we know that his living
[2:22:10] presence brother banham continues on
[2:22:14] oh my thank God for
[2:22:17] this Mount Transfiguration
[2:22:21] experience how many knows it's all about
[2:22:23] Jesus
[2:22:25] it's not about our church
[2:22:27] our group our pastor
[2:22:31] you know what we believe we know more
[2:22:33] than them
[2:22:35] we're more holy than them
[2:22:38] but it is it is comforting to know that
[2:22:40] death can't even touch us
[2:22:43] death has no power over us
[2:22:45] and it's in these things that we make
[2:22:48] ourselves ready I apologize I couldn't
[2:22:50] move into that pick up your pen even
[2:22:53] more but it's a really rich good things
[2:22:55] in there how the prophet brings that up
[2:22:58] to us that our attitude today we have to
[2:23:01] see that attitude through the scripture
[2:23:02] Joshua Moses Elijah and the widow woman
[2:23:06] and that
[2:23:09] we would watch and pray
[2:23:12] and that we'd be worthy to escape these
[2:23:15] things and stand before the son of man
[2:23:17] take heed over the overeating and the
[2:23:20] drunkenness and the cares of this life
[2:23:23] the busyness of this age that will come
[2:23:26] upon you unawares as a trap a snare you
[2:23:32] know what a trap is
[2:23:34] a trap gets you in but it doesn't let
[2:23:37] you get out
[2:23:38] a trap doesn't have an exit point
[2:23:42] catches you and then you're caught into
[2:23:44] it and this age is the greatest trap
[2:23:47] that I can think of is the worldliness
[2:23:50] and the pump and the thing of the day
[2:23:53] and what everybody else is doing and
[2:23:56] then not be aware that the Rapture is at
[2:23:58] hand God bless you Lord help us
[2:24:02] Lord help us
[2:24:04] let us
[2:24:06] let us watch and pray God bless you let
[2:24:09] us pray
[2:24:10] Heavenly Father we thank you
[2:24:14] for your word this morning we thank you
[2:24:16] for the people that have gathered here
[2:24:19] oh God we
[2:24:21] know that there's coming a great
[2:24:23] Showdown

[2:24:33] rapture

[2:24:38] our ways into your hands Lord we know

[2:24:53] the Bible

[2:25:00] another
[2:25:01] being kind
[2:25:04] being respectful to others
[2:25:07] thinking of others as our own self Lord
