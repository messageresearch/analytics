[39:28] sun
[39:31] bright shine
[39:34] as
[39:36] the sun
[39:45] bless days
[39:48] to sing
[39:51] God's praise
[39:54] And will
[39:57] we first
[40:00] beun?
[40:01] Amen. First verse. Amazing grace.
[40:06] A
[40:12] how sweet
[40:14] the sound.
[40:21] a rich
[40:24] like me.
[40:29] I once
[40:31] I once was lost,
[40:35] but now
[40:38] I'm found.
[40:41] was blind
[40:44] but now
[40:47] I see.
[40:50] Amen. God bless you, saints. So good to
[40:52] be in the house of the Lord with you uh
[40:54] this morning. How many are happy you be
[40:56] here? God bless you richly. Amen. God's
[41:00] been so good to us. There's a lot of
[41:02] places we could be, but it's so good to
[41:04] be in the house of the Lord uh praising
[41:07] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[41:10] And there's none like him. Amen. Let us
[41:13] pray as we approach.
[41:17] Our Lord Jesus, we come to you today
[41:19] thanking you for your grace and your
[41:21] mercy. Oh Lord, we ask you to speak to
[41:25] our hearts and what we have need of this
[41:28] morning. Lord, forgive us of our
[41:31] frailties and our shortcomings.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Forgive us for our willful disobedience,
[41:37] our unbelief, Lord. Oh God, have mercy
[41:40] upon us. We pray. Bless every heart
[41:43] that's gathered here this morning. Those
[41:47] that desire to be here, they can't. I
[41:50] pray you'll bless them as well. It's our
[41:53] heart's desire, Lord, is to be pleasing
[41:56] to you. Everything that we would say or
[41:59] do, Lord, and we commit our ways to you
[42:01] now. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[42:05] So, God bless each of you.
[42:08] Amen. While while you're standing, we'll
[42:11] go right into the word of the Lord.
[42:16] I don't really recognize
[42:18] the city of Mesa during the daytime. I
[42:22] was on my way here to church and I
[42:23] passed it by and I was like, "This
[42:24] doesn't look right." So, I had to make a
[42:27] U-turn and come back because it's
[42:29] normally coming I'm coming here in the
[42:31] night. But, we're so happy to be here
[42:33] with you, the saints of the most high
[42:37] God. Amen.
[42:39] Amen. In the scriptures, we'll take uh
[42:42] two places
[42:44] and um I'd like to read a Psalms 135 if
[42:50] we could as a class. I'll read the first
[42:53] verse
[42:55] and then you read the second verse.
[43:02] Alternate the verses. And then when we
[43:05] get to the last verse,
[43:08] Psalms 135, we get to the last verse,
[43:11] verse 21. We'll read that all together.
[43:14] Amen.
[43:15] When you have that, you can say, "Amen."
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Still hear some pages turning.
[43:25] Wait just a little bit. Yeah. Psalms
[43:29] 135. Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the
[43:32] name of the Lord. Praise him, oh ye
[43:35] servants of the Lord.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good.
[43:45] Sing praises unto his name, for it is
[43:49] pleasant.
[43:57] For I know that the Lord is great and
[44:00] that our Lord is above all gods.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; He caus the vapors to ascend from the
[44:15] ends of the earth. He maketh lightning
[44:18] for the rain. He bringeth the wind out
[44:21] of his treasuries.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Who sent tokens and wonders in the midst
[44:30] of thee, oh Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and
[44:34] upon all his servants,
[44:40] &gt;&gt; king of the Amorites, Og, king of
[44:43] Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan,
[44:53] Thy name, O Lord, endureth forever, and
[44:56] thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all
[44:59] generations.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; The idols of the heathen are silver and
[45:10] gold, the work of men's hands.
[45:19] They have ears, but they hear not.
[45:22] Neither is there any breath in their
[45:24] mouths.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord of O house of Israel.
[45:36] Bless the Lord, oh house of Aon.
[45:46] altogether. Blessed be the Lord of our
[45:49] Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem.
[45:53] Praise ye the Lord.
[45:56] Amen. Thank God for his word. Verse six
[45:58] says, "Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that
[46:01] did he in heaven and in earth and in the
[46:05] seas and deep places." He did what he
[46:08] pleased to do.
[46:10] in the scripture. We'll take one more in
[46:14] Romans
[46:16] chapter number eight,
[46:30] verse number 28.
[46:33] And we know that all things work
[46:36] together for good to them that love God,
[46:39] to them who are called according to his
[46:41] purpose. For whom he did forno, he also
[46:44] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[46:46] image of his son, that he might be the
[46:48] firstborn among many brethren. Moreover,
[46:52] whom he did predestinate, them he also
[46:54] called. Whom he called, them he also
[46:57] justified. Whom he justified, them he
[47:00] also glorified. Verse 31, Romans 8:31.
[47:04] What shall we then say to these things?
[47:07] If God be before us, who can be against
[47:10] us?
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. One more scripture just to seal it
[47:15] up in Isaiah chapter number 45
[47:21] verses 5 and 6.
[47:25] Isaiah 45
[47:30] vers number five. Sorry.
[47:41] When you have that, you can say, "Amen."
[47:48] Isaiah 45. Let me get it. Old Testament
[47:56] verses number five and six. I am the
[47:59] Lord. There is none else. There is no
[48:03] God besides me. I girded thee, though
[48:09] thou hast not known me. That they may
[48:13] know from the rising of the sun from the
[48:15] west that there is none besides me. I am
[48:19] the Lord and there is none else. Amen.
[48:23] I'm going to take for a title this
[48:26] morning
[48:27] the
[48:29] sovereignty of God.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; The sovereignty of God. How many you
[48:34] know that God is sovereign?
[48:37] &gt;&gt; You know that word sovereign means
[48:38] supreme authority with no high higher
[48:42] power, no equal, no accountability to
[48:46] another. God is sovereign. May God bless
[48:51] his word. You may be seated. And talking
[48:53] about this sovereignty of God in Psalms
[48:57] 135 that we read there, it says that
[49:00] they make their own gods. These people
[49:03] and those idols, they are of silver and
[49:06] gold. They have mouths but they can't
[49:09] speak, eyes, but they can't see. They
[49:13] have ears but they hear not. They have
[49:16] no breath in them. And the people that
[49:19] make them are just like them. That's
[49:21] what he says. The people that make these
[49:24] idols are just like their idol. Ears
[49:28] can't hear, eyes can't see, no breath.
[49:32] There is no God but our God. And
[49:36] thinking of this uh sovereignty of God
[49:39] on Wednesday uh passed this earlier this
[49:42] week, Tuesday or Wednesday, something
[49:43] like that. I was in prayer just praying
[49:47] and this little subject came up on my
[49:50] mind or the thought was the
[49:55] um how each of us need a move of God in
[50:00] our life and we need a sovereign move of
[50:03] God and I begin to think I bless you
[50:06] sister Carpenter it's good to see you
[50:08] always and each of you I begin to think
[50:11] to myself if All of the churches in the
[50:15] city of Tucson, there's roughly 15 or so
[50:18] churches as far as I know, were to get
[50:22] together, Brother Steve, and
[50:26] um find one main goal that they would
[50:29] stand behind.
[50:31] Um what kind of a power would that
[50:33] release? Would that be a good thing or a
[50:35] bad thing? If all of the churches, all
[50:39] of the 15 churches, the pastors, just
[50:41] the pastors alone were to get together
[50:44] and on the table, brother Ezekiel, was
[50:47] one truth that we could all stand for
[50:50] and stand behind. And let's say that
[50:52] truth was that every member of our
[50:56] assemblies needs the baptism of the Holy
[50:59] Ghost.
[51:01] Would that be a bad thing or a good
[51:02] thing?
[51:04] Some of y'all afraid to answer. Or maybe
[51:07] it's just Mesa. It's a Mesa morning. You
[51:10] guys are quiet on the Mesa mornings.
[51:12] Would that be a good thing or a bad
[51:14] thing?
[51:15] &gt;&gt; I think it'd be a good thing. It almost
[51:18] kind of warms your heart to think of it,
[51:20] too. But is it going to happen?
[51:25] No, it's not going to happen until God
[51:29] makes it happen.
[51:32] And God in his sovereignty has to make
[51:36] something like that take place. As much
[51:39] as I would will for it, as much as I
[51:42] would desire it, and even members in
[51:44] every one of those assemblies would even
[51:46] agree with me that it would be a good
[51:49] thing, it would be beneficial, will
[51:51] actually do better than um than we're
[51:55] doing right now. It's still not going to
[51:57] happen unless a sovereign move takes
[52:01] place. And I was thinking, I gave this
[52:03] example on Wednesday. I was thinking
[52:05] about, you know, these pigeons in the
[52:08] city. You know, a pigeon is kind of a
[52:10] nuisance bird and there's hundreds and
[52:14] thousands of them in the city and you'll
[52:16] see one hawk chasing an entire flock of
[52:20] pigeons and he'll swoop through there
[52:22] and they all scatter. And I thought,
[52:25] man, if those pigeons would just get
[52:28] together,
[52:30] they can form an alliance and defeat
[52:34] their common enemy. They could. They
[52:36] would defeat that that hawk. But will
[52:39] they do it? No. Why? Because they have a
[52:44] pigeon brain.
[52:46] They're pigeons.
[52:49] That's how they think. Pigeons will
[52:52] fight with one another while they're all
[52:54] running from the enemy.
[52:57] They'll argue and fight as they're being
[52:59] chased together.
[53:01] But they're way outnumbered than their
[53:04] enemy.
[53:05] And me uh more intellectual than a
[53:08] pigeon, higher form than a pigeon. I can
[53:11] sit and look at the numbers and say if
[53:14] all of these pigeons would just form a
[53:17] general simple alliance against their
[53:20] enemy, they would defeat it. But they
[53:23] won't do it. They can't do it because
[53:26] they're pigeons. It would have to be
[53:29] something supernatural happened to those
[53:31] birds for them to align like that.
[53:36] And as I was thinking about this, this
[53:40] is the the one of the quotes that really
[53:42] dealt with me on this was in the message
[53:48] trying to do God a service without it
[53:49] being his will. He says this here. Now,
[53:53] first of all, I want to thank you all
[53:55] for being here. I know it's you guys put
[53:58] a little extra effort to come. Uh you
[54:01] Saints, you know, you streamed the
[54:02] service in Tucson and we certainly
[54:04] appreciate that. We don't, you know, the
[54:07] people that come are the ones that want
[54:08] to come and you that come, God bless
[54:10] you. And Stevie, I don't give him enough
[54:13] uh in art. I don't appreciate you all
[54:16] enough, but God bless you. And every
[54:19] time you sing a song, it helps and it
[54:22] blesses the service. Appreciate Brother
[54:24] Craig and all of you. Amen.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Can we give the Lord a hand a praise?
[54:34] Was that for the Lord or for what was
[54:36] that for?
[54:38] Can we give Can we give the Lord a hand
[54:41] of praise the Lord?
[54:48] And I give the Lord a hand of praise the
[54:50] Lord in your life. So God bless you. We
[54:53] certainly appreciate you. I would love
[54:54] to be here more with you, but I'm here
[54:56] this morning. So, God bless you. Now,
[54:59] Brother Random takes this message in um
[55:03] trying to do God a service without it
[55:05] being his will. And he makes this
[55:06] statement paragraph 117. He says, "I was
[55:10] discussing with a group of my fine
[55:12] brothers, Baptist brethren, not long
[55:15] ago, and they said, Brother Brandham, we
[55:18] can only have a revival when we take the
[55:21] word word by word, page by page, letter
[55:26] by letter." And I said, "I believe too,
[55:30] page by page." He said, I said, "They've
[55:33] been trying to do that all along."
[55:36] He said, 'But we must find the Greek
[55:38] interpretation of the word, what the
[55:40] Greek says. I said, I haven't read too
[55:44] much, but reading the history of the
[55:46] church and the Nia council and the piasa
[55:49] council, the Nasa fathers and so forth,
[55:53] they were arguing back there about the
[55:57] Greek. That's 2,000 years ago.
[56:02] One said it means this, one said it
[56:04] means that. The Greek word means this.
[56:08] Just like our language, we use the word
[56:10] sea. You would see you could mean a body
[56:13] of water. You can mean understand many
[56:16] things. Bored. Bore a hole. Make a walk.
[56:19] Or you you bored me. You pay my board.
[56:23] It can mean many things. And those
[56:24] little vowels and so forth just change
[56:27] the whole meaning. So you'll never do it
[56:30] like that. God wrote it like that and
[56:34] all of the word is inspired
[56:38] and he said I thank thee father thou has
[56:40] hid these things from the wise and
[56:43] prudent and will reveal amen to babes
[56:47] such as we'll learn. It's a revelation
[56:50] of him as I said last evening will
[56:54] reveal it to babes. I said it won't work
[56:57] sir. I said a revival will never come
[57:02] until God, the sovereign God sends it.
[57:06] Then he might take up a little nitwit
[57:08] that can can't even sign his name and do
[57:11] it with it that that that knows not even
[57:15] good English, let alone Greek. That's
[57:18] what he done done in the time with Peter
[57:20] preached at Pentecost. You know, he
[57:22] couldn't even sign his name. Ignorant,
[57:25] unlearned. But God does things in such a
[57:28] strange way to our intellectual thinking
[57:32] that makes it God. If he's got a bunch
[57:35] of theologians and dignitaries and so
[57:37] forth, they said that smart kphosis. You
[57:41] see, they would say that he had it just
[57:44] right. But God went down and got a
[57:46] fisherman that couldn't even sign their
[57:48] name. That's what he took. That's God.
[57:52] He takes something that's nothing and
[57:55] makes something out of it to honor to to
[57:59] his own honor. He takes chaos and makes
[58:03] an Eden. Now, if there's anybody got the
[58:06] mechanics for a revival, it's our noble
[58:08] brother Billy Graham. But the mechanics
[58:11] is all right, but the mechanics won't
[58:14] move it. It takes the dynamics to move
[58:17] it. You can build an automobile, put
[58:20] fine seats in it, make fine pistons,
[58:23] prove by science what it can do, but
[58:25] unless the dynamics is there, she's just
[58:29] a dead piece of goods. How many know
[58:32] that's the truth? You know, if God don't
[58:36] move, there will be no move.
[58:40] Now, men can do things. They can say
[58:42] things. They can try to orchestrate
[58:44] things. They can put themsel in position
[58:47] for God to do things. But you are not
[58:50] going to make God do anything before he
[58:53] wants to do anything.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; That is just the truth. Why? Because
[58:58] he's sovereign.
[59:00] He's the sovereign God. He doesn't
[59:03] answer to no one. He doesn't concur or
[59:08] agree with or try to get some people on
[59:12] his side. He doesn't need a group of
[59:15] anybody
[59:16] to to achieve his purpose. HE MOVES ALL
[59:22] BY HIMSELF. HE DOESN'T NEED FRIENDSHIP.
[59:26] HE DOESN'T NEED OTHERS BACKING AND
[59:29] SUPPORTING HIM. HE DOESN'T NEED ANYBODY
[59:32] TO DO ANYTHING ON HIS BEHALF. I AM GOD
[59:38] AND I'M ALL BY MYSELF.
[59:41] HE'S SOVEREIGN.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:46] He's God.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Beautiful, isn't he?
[59:51] If he wants to do it, he simply does it.
[59:56] He's sovereign. He's supreme.
[1:00:00] There is no equal to him. He has supreme
[1:00:03] authority. He is the final say. There is
[1:00:07] no court of appeals against him. There's
[1:00:11] nobody YOU CAN TELL ON HIM. You You
[1:00:15] can't get him in trouble. You can't You
[1:00:18] can't remove him. You can't vote him
[1:00:21] out.
[1:00:23] AMEN.
[1:00:24] HE'S SOVEREIGN. I AM GOD AND I'M ALL BY
[1:00:29] MYSELF.
[1:00:31] AMEN.
[1:00:33] this sovereign God,
[1:00:35] he's not accountable to nobody. You know
[1:00:38] what's interesting? We're living in an
[1:00:41] age where a group of people aren't
[1:00:43] accountable to nobody.
[1:00:46] They don't want anybody to hold them
[1:00:48] accountable to anything. There's church
[1:00:50] members, there's families, there's young
[1:00:53] people, there's husbands,
[1:00:55] there's wives,
[1:00:57] there's individuals. They don't want to
[1:00:59] be accountable to nobody.
[1:01:01] This age lacks the accountability
[1:01:05] to what is right or what is wrong. They
[1:01:08] do whatever they want to do but they are
[1:01:10] not God.
[1:01:12] I am not God. YOU ARE NOT GOD. THE MAN
[1:01:17] ON THE STREET IS NOT THE MAJORITY OF THE
[1:01:20] PEOPLE ARE NOT GOD. CAN'T DO WHATEVER
[1:01:23] THEY WANT to do.
[1:01:25] Sadly, this age is crippled with this
[1:01:30] lack of accountability.
[1:01:32] You can't stop them and tell them
[1:01:35] nothing.
[1:01:36] Even if your grandpa or grandma, those
[1:01:40] little grandchildren don't respect
[1:01:42] nobody.
[1:01:44] Many of them don't respect the elders
[1:01:46] anymore. They don't respect common
[1:01:49] decency anymore. The women act like men.
[1:01:53] They're butched. They're heavy. They're
[1:01:56] masculine. They'll argue with you.
[1:02:00] And many of the men act like women.
[1:02:05] Oh, yes.
[1:02:07] Keep their fingernails fouled,
[1:02:10] soft skin, soft
[1:02:13] uh uh uh I'm talking about in THEIR
[1:02:15] PERSONALITY. JUST SOFT. CAN'T even um uh
[1:02:19] take no for the for an answer. can't do
[1:02:23] without. And that's the age that you and
[1:02:25] I live in. But there's only one supreme
[1:02:28] sovereign one. And let's get it
[1:02:30] straight. Let's get it straight right
[1:02:32] now. THAT IS GOD HIMSELF.
[1:02:36] NOBODY ELSE stands equal to him. There's
[1:02:40] no authority standing beside him. He
[1:02:44] stands all by himself.
[1:02:48] in the heavens. He created the things
[1:02:51] the way he wanted them to be. Is that
[1:02:54] right? He fashioned it the way he wanted
[1:02:58] it to be. And those that had a problem
[1:03:00] with it, what'd he do? He kicked them
[1:03:03] out.
[1:03:05] Yes, Lucifer had a problem with this
[1:03:08] order, this orchestra. Isaiah 43:10 says
[1:03:11] this, "Ye are my witnesses, sayeth the
[1:03:13] Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen,
[1:03:16] that ye may know and believe me, and
[1:03:18] understand that I am he. Before me there
[1:03:21] was no God formed, neither shall there
[1:03:24] be after me. I even I am the Lord, and
[1:03:29] besides me there is no Savior."
[1:03:33] Isaiah 44:6. Is that what we read this
[1:03:36] morning?
[1:03:38] Huh? What did we read?
[1:03:42] We read Isaiah 45. Thank you. So Isaiah
[1:03:44] 44 goes forward and says this here
[1:03:47] sayeth the Lord the King of Israel and
[1:03:50] his redeemer the Lord of ho hosts.
[1:03:53] Isaiah 44 verse number six. I am the
[1:03:56] first, I am the last, and besides me
[1:04:00] there is no God. and who as I shall call
[1:04:04] and shall declare it and set it in order
[1:04:07] for me since I appointed the ancient
[1:04:10] people. And the things that are coming
[1:04:13] and shall come, let them show unto them.
[1:04:17] Fear ye not, neither be afraid. Have not
[1:04:19] I told thee from that time and have
[1:04:23] declared it? Ye are even my witnesses.
[1:04:27] Is there a God besides me? This is God
[1:04:30] asking A QUESTION. IS THERE A GOD
[1:04:32] BESIDES ME?
[1:04:35] YES, there is no God. I know not any.
[1:04:41] Hos Hosea 13:4 says this, "Yet I am the
[1:04:46] Lord thy God from the land of Egypt, and
[1:04:49] thou shalt know
[1:04:52] and thou shalt know no God but me, for
[1:04:55] there is no savior besides me." Psalms
[1:05:00] 103:19, the word says, "The Lord hath
[1:05:04] prepared his throne in the heavens, and
[1:05:08] his kingdom ruleth over all."
[1:05:12] So this is God. This is his attributes.
[1:05:16] That's just a few scriptures, very few.
[1:05:19] Isaiah 43,42
[1:05:22] 44 45 46 all the way through there uh
[1:05:26] really strongly coincides with
[1:05:28] Revelations when Jesus appears to John.
[1:05:31] It says I'm the first and the last
[1:05:34] establishing who he is. He's the
[1:05:36] sovereign God. And this sovereign God
[1:05:40] has his sovereign word. And he and his
[1:05:45] word are the same. Amen. And he takes
[1:05:49] his the Lord God and his word are one.
[1:05:53] You think that that is known by
[1:05:56] everyone. It is not known by everyone.
[1:05:58] Many people believe in God, but they
[1:06:01] don't believe in the Bible.
[1:06:04] But God is his word. He is the Bible.
[1:06:08] And God is sovereign. His word is
[1:06:11] sovereign. His works are sovereign. His
[1:06:14] grace is sovereign. His gifts are
[1:06:17] sovereignly given. His church is
[1:06:20] sovereign. And he deals with the
[1:06:23] individual in a sovereign way. Why is
[1:06:26] this so important? It's important
[1:06:28] because then we know by whom we're
[1:06:32] serving and the God that we serve.
[1:06:36] Listen, there is uh two wills that you
[1:06:40] can operate in as children of God. You
[1:06:43] can operate in his perfect will or you
[1:06:45] can operate in his permissive will. And
[1:06:49] the way his perfect will runs is exactly
[1:06:53] according to his original thought is
[1:06:56] according to his word. Now outside of
[1:06:59] his perfect will, he has a will as the
[1:07:02] prophet teaches us. It's called his
[1:07:05] permissive will. And these are things
[1:07:08] that God will permit. But that
[1:07:11] permissive will eventually will work
[1:07:14] itself back to his perfect will.
[1:07:19] And also the permissive will can many
[1:07:23] times work itself all the way down to
[1:07:27] being out of his will. Does that make
[1:07:30] sense to anybody? So if you're operating
[1:07:33] in his permissive will, he may make that
[1:07:36] permissive will work. It'll always work
[1:07:39] to his glory. But for you, that
[1:07:42] permissive will, BECAUSE YOU CAN do it,
[1:07:45] doesn't mean you're supposed to do it.
[1:07:47] BECAUSE YOU'RE PERMITTED TO do it, and
[1:07:49] you CONTINUE THAT WAY, THAT permissive
[1:07:52] will can move you to being OUT OF HIS
[1:07:56] WILL. SO, YOU HAVE OUT OF HIS WILL, HIS
[1:07:59] PERMISSIVE WILL, AND THEN HIS PERFECT
[1:08:01] WILL. Can I get A WITNESS? HIS PERFECT
[1:08:04] WILL IS SOVEREIGN AND ALL THE OTHER
[1:08:07] WILLS WILL COME BACK UNDERNEATH his
[1:08:09] perfect will. It's the prophet taught
[1:08:12] us. Amen. And so his word is given to
[1:08:16] us. It's his perfect will. His grace.
[1:08:20] Gifts for example are without
[1:08:23] repentance. Is that right? People have
[1:08:26] gifts whether they're in church or out
[1:08:28] of church, but while they're born, in
[1:08:30] their birth, in the cradle, in the baby
[1:08:33] room, those gifts are already in the
[1:08:35] baby. They didn't repent. They haven't
[1:08:38] even been to church. Has nothing to do
[1:08:40] with it. They're sovereignly given.
[1:08:44] Don't we all wish we can sing?
[1:08:48] Huh? But how many know we all can't
[1:08:52] sing?
[1:08:54] Not like where YOU GOT THE MIC IN. WE
[1:08:55] ALL CAN SING, BUT some of y'all don't
[1:08:57] need the mic in your hand. You need to
[1:09:00] sing sing. Come on, saints. Now, let me
[1:09:02] put me going on here. SOME OF Y'ALL,
[1:09:06] EVERYBODY NEEDS TO SING. RIGHT.
[1:09:08] Everybody can sing praises to the Lord,
[1:09:11] BUT NOT EVERYBODY IS a a recording
[1:09:14] artist.
[1:09:16] Not everybody is a gifted musician or
[1:09:20] have A GIFTED VOICE. GOD GIVES THOSE
[1:09:22] OUT. THEY'RE SOVEREIGNLY GIVEN. IT HAS
[1:09:25] NOTHING TO DO WITH he willth OR HE
[1:09:27] DESERVED OR SHE HAD IT AND he didn't.
[1:09:30] IT'S IT'S GOD GIVES THOSE sovereignly
[1:09:34] gifts and callings of God come without
[1:09:38] repentance.
[1:09:40] Now
[1:09:41] his church and the individual becomes
[1:09:46] sovereignly linked to the sovereign God.
[1:09:50] What does that mean? And that means that
[1:09:52] if God is with you or for you, then who
[1:09:57] can be against you?
[1:09:59] It's a beautiful understanding.
[1:10:02] When you are linked with the sovereign
[1:10:04] God, YOU HAVE ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS
[1:10:08] and the blessings of being under his
[1:10:11] sovereign protection. WHAT DOES THAT
[1:10:14] MEAN? THAT MEANS THAT YOU NOW don't need
[1:10:16] a team. You don't need A SUPPORT SYSTEM.
[1:10:20] YOU DON'T NEED FRIENDS TO CONCUR WITH.
[1:10:23] WHEN YOU HAVE COME IN CONTACT WITH THE
[1:10:25] SUPREME GOD AND HE'S ESTABLISHED YOU AS
[1:10:30] HIS CHILD, THAT IS ALL YOU NEED is God
[1:10:35] himself. That's all a true ministry
[1:10:37] needs. That's all a young person needs.
[1:10:40] That's all a brother needs, a sister
[1:10:41] needs, is to be in contact with the
[1:10:43] sovereign God. And he becomes their
[1:10:47] sufficiency. Amen. All their needs are
[1:10:50] met through him. Now let's take Romans 8
[1:10:57] 33 again
[1:11:00] and move over to the next chapter of
[1:11:02] Romans chapter 9. Quickly Romans chapter
[1:11:05] 8 33. Who shall lay anything
[1:11:10] to the charge of who?
[1:11:14] God's elect. If God elects them, WHO? IT
[1:11:19] IS GOD THAT WHAT?
[1:11:21] He is the justifier.
[1:11:25] Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ
[1:11:28] that died. Yes, rather that is risen
[1:11:31] again. Who is even at the right hand of
[1:11:33] God who also make intercession for us?
[1:11:38] The scripture goes on, who shall
[1:11:39] separate us from the love of God? In all
[1:11:42] these things, we are more than
[1:11:44] conquerors.
[1:11:46] Amen. There's nothing that can separate
[1:11:48] us from this love.
[1:11:51] Now, this sovereign God, how he works,
[1:11:55] the sovereignty of God is he does what
[1:11:58] he wants to do when he wants to do it
[1:12:01] and how he wants to do it. But brother
[1:12:04] Angel, he still has his own laws that he
[1:12:08] must obey.
[1:12:10] He is confined to his own rules,
[1:12:14] his own regulations.
[1:12:16] And so when he establishes a truth, he
[1:12:19] himself walks in that truth. He preaches
[1:12:25] or declares a truth, then he has to
[1:12:27] believe what he has declared. Just like
[1:12:30] you and I, we have to believe what was
[1:12:33] declared to us by his word. That's the
[1:12:37] order.
[1:12:38] So he's not loosely doing nothing. He's
[1:12:41] doing something. And what he's doing is
[1:12:44] he is staying with his original word.
[1:12:48] Amen. This sovereignty
[1:12:51] it it it brings us into this thought
[1:12:54] here as a prophet told us here. I read
[1:12:57] for the church some time ago. I think
[1:13:00] it's in service is just this time. He
[1:13:02] says, "Many of you come to me with
[1:13:03] visions and dreams and I by God's grace
[1:13:06] interpret those to you." And he says,
[1:13:09] "Many of you have come with dreams and
[1:13:12] visions or dreams and I was not able to
[1:13:16] interpret those for you." So he said
[1:13:19] this, he said, "I've never produced a
[1:13:21] gimmick." So the idea is that okay well
[1:13:25] as long as I'm in the Brandom
[1:13:26] Tabernacle, as long as I'm in Brother
[1:13:29] Brandham's ministry or his church, if I
[1:13:31] was there when he was there, it's a
[1:13:34] guarantee that God's going to speak to
[1:13:36] me. No, no, no. If God didn't want to
[1:13:39] show the prophet what your dream was, he
[1:13:42] wasn't going to show it. It's just that
[1:13:44] simple. And one of the glaring or
[1:13:47] blaring instances of the sovereign God
[1:13:52] is this little sister that was in the
[1:13:55] ministry of brother Brandham and that's
[1:13:56] sister Edith Wright. How many remember
[1:13:59] sister Edith Wright? She was the sister
[1:14:02] to sister Hatty Wright. And sister Hatty
[1:14:05] Wright we all know who she is. The
[1:14:08] sister who had the Lord use her to say
[1:14:10] the right thing at the right time.
[1:14:13] That's nothing but the truth. And when
[1:14:15] that super anointing came down on sister
[1:14:17] Hattie, Brother Brandham says any moment
[1:14:20] now, Sister Edith will leap up out of
[1:14:24] that infotile paralysis. She was drawn
[1:14:26] up her entire life. And she was under
[1:14:30] the greatest ministry, one of the
[1:14:32] greatest ministries that that that we
[1:14:34] had seen or known. her family, the
[1:14:37] Wright family, was a member of the Brham
[1:14:41] Ministry or the Brandom Tabernacle as
[1:14:43] one of the originals. They're mentioned
[1:14:46] on the first tape that the prophet
[1:14:48] PREACHED IN OAKLAND TALKING ABOUT their
[1:14:50] family, the rights, and she was born
[1:14:54] this way. I if you get sister um um
[1:14:58] sister Hattie Wright's testimony, I had
[1:15:00] it somewhere. I don't I have to find
[1:15:02] that up and share with you. She was
[1:15:04] talking about how I believe the Edith
[1:15:07] when she was born um it was either
[1:15:10] nervous or something that was on a a
[1:15:12] tractor or in a in a wagon and it hit a
[1:15:16] bump a certain way or whatever it was
[1:15:18] and it caused a lot of this problems
[1:15:21] from her birth but then it made it even
[1:15:23] worse and when she came into the
[1:15:26] ministry of brother Brandham she would
[1:15:28] always be tormented and in pain and so
[1:15:30] forth. He said, "Brother Radam says, we
[1:15:32] finally prayed for her. It took the pain
[1:15:35] away, but it didn't deliver her. She
[1:15:38] stayed in that wheels chair for HER
[1:15:41] ENTIRE LIFE." BROTHER BRAD SAYS people
[1:15:45] who were worse than her WERE HEALED
[1:15:48] RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER IN THE SAME
[1:15:51] MEETING. GOD WOULD COME DOWN. HE SAID,
[1:15:53] "I PRAYED FOR DAYS, FOR DAYS TO SHOW ME
[1:15:59] WHY HE WON'T HEAL SISTER EDITH." And you
[1:16:03] think, "IS SHE IN THE RIGHT PLACE?" YES,
[1:16:05] SHE'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE. IS SHE
[1:16:07] BELIEVING THE WORD? OBVIOUSLY, SHE
[1:16:09] BELIEVE IN THE WORD. BUT WHY DIDN'T GOD
[1:16:13] HEAL HER?
[1:16:16] BECAUSE GOD IS sovereign
[1:16:18] and he doesn't HAVE THE ANSWER TO NO
[1:16:22] ONE.
[1:16:23] HIS WAYS ARE PERFECT.
[1:16:27] AND WHO CAN SAY GOD MISSED IT OR GOD YOU
[1:16:31] ARE NOT FAIR OR GOD I NEED I DESERVE AN
[1:16:34] EXPLANATION? NO, YOU DO NOT DESERVE AN
[1:16:38] EXPLANATION.
[1:16:39] HE GIVES THE EXPLANATION AS HE WILLS.
[1:16:46] WHY? Because he's sovereign.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Hopefully, this message will settle your
[1:16:53] faith down. Cuz a sovereign God
[1:16:57] heard your prayer the first time YOU
[1:17:00] HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:01] HE HEARD YOUR PRAYER THE FIRST TIME YOU
[1:17:05] PRAYED. HE HEARD IT. HE SAW IT. HE SEES
[1:17:09] WHAT YOU HAVE NEED OF. YES, he does. THE
[1:17:14] OTHER GODS HAVE HAVE EYES BUT THEY CAN'T
[1:17:16] SEE. THE OTHER ONE HAVE EARS BUT THEY
[1:17:18] CAN'T HEAR. BUT OUR GOD IS GOD.
[1:17:23] HE'S GOT all power in his hand.
[1:17:26] He knows the end from the beginning. Is
[1:17:29] that right?
[1:17:32] Amen.
[1:17:35] Glory.
[1:17:36] Now
[1:17:41] my my Did I drop my glasses? Yeah, I
[1:17:43] did. Here they are. He's sovereign. So,
[1:17:47] Sister Edith,
[1:17:49] let me just take a couple of these for
[1:17:50] you. All right.
[1:17:56] There they made it a point to mention
[1:17:58] her birthday
[1:18:00] and and a few places. In 1960,
[1:18:05] she was 39 years old.
[1:18:09] in 19 sorry
[1:18:14] in 196 she was 39 years old she finally
[1:18:17] passed away a few years later
[1:18:20] and uh brother Bham couldn't make it to
[1:18:23] the service
[1:18:25] she I think she was 39 years old later
[1:18:30] they move forward
[1:18:32] he says this here
[1:18:36] I've been preaching about 31 years I
[1:18:38] think
[1:18:43] so. She's 39 years old and he's
[1:18:45] preaching. He said, "I've been
[1:18:46] preaching."
[1:18:51] Excuse me. Sorry.
[1:18:55] I've been preaching 31 years, I think.
[1:18:58] So, I guess I knowed you right
[1:19:01] immediately after I started preaching.
[1:19:03] The Wright family. So thankful that I
[1:19:06] know those people. They have certainly
[1:19:09] been inspiration in my life.
[1:19:15] And if the right family should pass on
[1:19:17] into eternity, I was still living. I
[1:19:20] couldn't pass that place without taking
[1:19:22] off my hat to think of the great things
[1:19:24] that God has done on that hillside
[1:19:27] there. That's where everything just
[1:19:29] taken place down there. I've seen there
[1:19:32] taking place of the angel of the Lord
[1:19:35] making the visit for Georgie Carter
[1:19:38] taking the place where he led me on the
[1:19:41] hillside that night with the poison ivy
[1:19:44] and stuff. Then he met me over there
[1:19:46] also in the vision and shine down from
[1:19:48] the dogwood bushes. See so many things
[1:19:52] has taken place. Brother Wright laying
[1:19:55] at the point of death when all the
[1:19:58] doctors had passed by and his church
[1:20:00] members down there telling him go get
[1:20:02] your divine healer. Now me sitting up on
[1:20:04] the hill crying for four days praying
[1:20:08] for him. The Lord spoke a vision and
[1:20:10] says go tell him thus sayeth the Lord
[1:20:14] he'll bury the guy that's making fun of
[1:20:16] him. And he did. That's right. And all
[1:20:19] things that. And then there was the Holy
[1:20:23] Spirit. the first time in the history of
[1:20:24] the church that ever seen it come to
[1:20:27] pass when he had spoke those squirrels
[1:20:29] into existence. Gave sister Hattie
[1:20:32] anything that she wanted to ask for
[1:20:35] regardless of what it was, money or
[1:20:37] anything else. Said it will be placed in
[1:20:39] your lap right now. She asked for the
[1:20:42] souls of her two boys and God gave them
[1:20:44] to her. Just so many things has happened
[1:20:47] down there on the hill. God bless them
[1:20:51] is my prayer. So he's highlighting this
[1:20:53] right household brother right the
[1:20:57] doctors had given him I think it stage
[1:20:59] whatever it was in cancer there was no
[1:21:02] way he can return brother Bab said I
[1:21:05] pray for him for four days then God
[1:21:07] sends a vision and heals him that was
[1:21:11] brother rightight sister had right the
[1:21:13] angel of the lord there come down in the
[1:21:17] room and she said the right thing it was
[1:21:19] given to her all these wonderful things.
[1:21:22] The male the the the the the other
[1:21:25] Georgie Carter, he was at their home in
[1:21:28] that same area when all these great and
[1:21:31] wonderful things took place. But in the
[1:21:33] right home was Sister Edith.
[1:21:36] Sister Heith right
[1:21:39] sitting there crippled for all these
[1:21:43] years and died as a as well.
[1:21:49] Never was healed. What was it? God, the
[1:21:53] sovereign God. You say, "Well, no, she
[1:21:56] maybe she didn't have faith." Well, I
[1:21:59] don't know. Maybe it wasn't the will of
[1:22:01] God. Well, I don't know. But it doesn't
[1:22:04] take away from the word of God because
[1:22:05] the word of God is sovereign. Let me
[1:22:07] give you an example of his word being
[1:22:09] sovereign. Let's see what the prophet of
[1:22:11] God says here. All right.
[1:22:14] Gather myself here.
[1:22:20] Excuse me, saints.
[1:22:23] This pull pit
[1:22:25] has a lot of things underneath this desk
[1:22:27] here.
[1:22:31] If I come back another Sunday in a row,
[1:22:32] I'm cleaning it out. Brother Zeke,
[1:22:36] God bless you. I got to say something to
[1:22:37] flex on you.
[1:22:40] Hear what the prophet of God says here
[1:22:42] about
[1:22:46] his word.
[1:22:48] Now in Hebrews chapter 4, I like this.
[1:22:50] This is very good. He says paragraph
[1:22:53] number 24. I hope this helps your faith
[1:22:55] and settles your faith into these great
[1:22:59] promises of God. He says this here.
[1:23:01] Listen to this. If God doesn't act the
[1:23:03] same when the same circumstances arise,
[1:23:06] then God is guilty of being partial to
[1:23:09] his people.
[1:23:11] God's so sovereignity
[1:23:14] demands of him to work in every case
[1:23:17] like he did the first case or he was
[1:23:20] wrong when he worked in the first case.
[1:23:23] If God does not act in the same way he
[1:23:26] did on the first case if he will act
[1:23:29] different to the second case than he
[1:23:32] acted wrong when he acted on the first
[1:23:35] case. If God healed the sick in the Old
[1:23:38] Testament, he's got to do it in the New
[1:23:40] Testament and today.
[1:23:43] Or he did wrong when he healed them back
[1:23:45] there. HE'S GOT TO act the same every
[1:23:47] time. And he will do it when the same
[1:23:51] faith meets the condition.
[1:23:54] The fault is in us,
[1:23:59] NOT IN GOD.
[1:24:02] FOR WE SEE him on some and many others
[1:24:07] and many work great outstanding
[1:24:09] miracles. We know that the critic cannot
[1:24:11] say it's not so for we see it proved and
[1:24:15] there it is.
[1:24:17] Prophet God continues and says this
[1:24:20] here.
[1:24:23] Oh my.
[1:24:30] Now, Hebrews chapter 7 number two. This
[1:24:33] is the one I want. Paragraph 251.
[1:24:36] What is it? It's a divine gift and it
[1:24:39] works in its sovereignity.
[1:24:43] But what makes it so hard here in the
[1:24:45] city? Honest. I get tangled up all the
[1:24:48] time in praying for the sick here. I'll
[1:24:52] go tell the people this. I'll go I'll go
[1:24:55] say, "Now, the Lord has made you well.
[1:24:58] Jesus healed you. He died for you. 1900
[1:25:01] years ago right there you were healed.
[1:25:04] Now as far as God is concerned, as far
[1:25:08] as Christ is concerned, you was healed
[1:25:12] 1900 years ago. Your disease was gone.
[1:25:18] It takes your faith to do it. And then
[1:25:22] that person can go around and not get
[1:25:24] well. Then the person come around and
[1:25:26] say, "Brother Bam told me I was well."
[1:25:28] See, I'm telling you what God said.
[1:25:33] Now, when it spoke directly to a person
[1:25:35] directly, it's thus said the Lord on a
[1:25:38] certain thing that's going to take
[1:25:40] place. That'll prove TO YOU RIGHT THERE
[1:25:44] THAT YOUR HEALING is already secured.
[1:25:47] Your faith has secured it. See, the
[1:25:50] promise is yours. It ain't my word. IT'S
[1:25:54] GOD'S WORD that you're already healed.
[1:26:00] See, but just SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER, I JUST
[1:26:03] CAN'T get it to soak in to folks here IN
[1:26:08] JEFFERSONVILLE.
[1:26:10] I JUST CAN'T GET IT TO HAPPEN. I KNOW.
[1:26:13] I'LL TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT JUST AS WELL AS
[1:26:16] I CAN and it just it just won't happen.
[1:26:19] That's all. So, brother Brandham is now
[1:26:22] bringing in question or bringing the
[1:26:25] finality of God's word that by his
[1:26:29] stripes you're already healed. And he'll
[1:26:31] make that declaration, you're healed.
[1:26:33] Christ healed you. And then people go on
[1:26:36] and say, "Well, I never got any better.
[1:26:38] Brother Hammond said I was going to GET
[1:26:39] HEALED." NO. GOD SAID YOU WAS GOING TO
[1:26:41] BE HEALED. IT'S IN HIS WORD.
[1:26:45] HIS WORD IS SOVEREIGN. SO YOU STAY WITH
[1:26:49] THAT ORIGINAL WORD AND HE'S TRYING TO
[1:26:52] GET THAT TO SINK INTO THE hearts of the
[1:26:54] people. What do you think? I lay out all
[1:26:58] the quotations
[1:27:00] to every believer or non-believer or
[1:27:02] make believer out there and once I lay
[1:27:05] out all those quotations that's going to
[1:27:07] make them a believer. What do you think
[1:27:10] arguing with someone is going to make
[1:27:12] them believe? When Cain himself
[1:27:16] looked God in the FACE AND GOD TOLD HIM
[1:27:20] WHAT TO DO, LITERALLY TOLD HIM, "IF YOU
[1:27:23] DO THIS LIKE YOUR BROTHER, I WILL ACCEPT
[1:27:27] YOU." AND HE WOULDN'T DO IT. HE COULDN'T
[1:27:29] do it. If they ain't GOING TO BELIEVE
[1:27:31] GOD, WHAT THEY GOING TO DO WITH ME? What
[1:27:33] are they GOING TO DO WITH YOU?
[1:27:36] THEY EITHER GOING TO BELIEVE OR THEY'RE
[1:27:38] NOT GOING TO BELIEVE. AND GOD'S GOING TO
[1:27:40] KEEP HIS WORD NO MATTER WHAT. SO WHAT DO
[1:27:44] WE DO? WE STAY WITH THE WORD. WE DON'T
[1:27:48] FOLLOW GROUPS OF PEOPLE. WE DON'T FOLLOW
[1:27:50] WHAT'S POPULAR. WE FIND THE PERFECT WILL
[1:27:54] OF GOD. And stay with that word.
[1:27:58] God in his sovereignty
[1:28:02] will bring it to pass. Amen.
[1:28:07] Brother Brandham talking about
[1:28:08] sovereignty. You remember the the little
[1:28:10] sister, the black sister from Memphis?
[1:28:14] He said it was the sovereignty of God
[1:28:17] that heard her prayer that brought that
[1:28:19] plane down. He uses that term. It
[1:28:22] brought the plane down. Was her prayer.
[1:28:25] It wasn't her church group. It wasn't
[1:28:28] her knowledge of the seals. Wasn't even
[1:28:30] her knowledge of who the Reverend
[1:28:32] William Brandom was. She didn't know who
[1:28:35] he was. He asked her. She didn't know.
[1:28:37] But she knew something. She knew God.
[1:28:40] She got in CONTACT WITH SOMEBODY THAT
[1:28:43] DIDN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND.
[1:28:45] SOMEBODY THAT DID NOT RESPECT PEOPLE'S
[1:28:48] PERSONS LIKE HOW WE DO. BUT GOD IS NO
[1:28:50] RESPECTOR OF PERSONS. HE DOESN'T CARE
[1:28:53] HOW MUCH MONEY YOU GOT OR HOW IMPORTANT
[1:28:56] YOU ARE. HE OPERATES BY FAITH. IF YOU
[1:29:00] BELIEVE HIM,
[1:29:02] HE'LL COME down and meet your need, too.
[1:29:05] Praise the Lord, somebody.
[1:29:08] Why? Because he's sovereign.
[1:29:11] He say, "Brother Israel, can we have a
[1:29:13] re revival? If God says we can, and I
[1:29:16] believe I can, that's all that matters."
[1:29:20] You said, "Well, brother, so and so,
[1:29:22] they disagree with me." So what? THEY
[1:29:24] DISAGREE WITH JESUS. THAT has nothing to
[1:29:27] do with it. Who agrees with you or
[1:29:29] disagrees WITH YOU. WE LOVE FOR
[1:29:31] EVERYBODY TO AGREE WITH US. ALL RIGHT?
[1:29:33] WE'LL HAVE EVERYBODY FOR TO LOVE US. IS
[1:29:35] THAT RIGHT? BUT WHAT IF THEY DON'T? WHAT
[1:29:38] IF THEY WON'T? WHAT IF THEY RESIST and
[1:29:41] disrespect YOU AND DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT
[1:29:44] YOU are a real child of God? Does it
[1:29:47] matter? DOES GOD RECOGNIZE YOU? DOES GOD
[1:29:51] KNOW WHO YOU ARE? WHEN YOU GO DOWN ON
[1:29:54] YOUR KNEES, WHO DO YOU WANT TO HEAR YOU?
[1:29:58] THE CHURCH OR THE SOVEREIGN GOD? I WANT
[1:30:02] THE SOVEREIGN GOD TO HEAR MY PRAYER.
[1:30:07] AMEN.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:11] And when you have the okay from him,
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; then you do have the okay.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; When he says yes, that means yes. When
[1:30:19] he gives YOU THE GREEN LIGHT, MAN, just
[1:30:21] run every red light you can because he
[1:30:24] gave you the green light. Everybody else
[1:30:27] can stop. It's yellow is red. No, I I
[1:30:30] GOT THE GREEN LIGHT. BOOM. I'M GONE.
[1:30:32] Spiritually speaking now. Don't go break
[1:30:34] no laws. Yes. When God SAYS YES, THAT'S
[1:30:38] WHAT THAT MEANS. SO, I was down on my
[1:30:41] knees. The Lord said yes. GET UP AND GO
[1:30:43] GET IT. Sister was down. I was down on
[1:30:46] my knees. The Lord says no. Well, that's
[1:30:47] what he told you. You better go get
[1:30:50] that. I'm going this right here.
[1:30:54] In that message, Brother Billy Paul said
[1:30:56] in that message, the guy at work, they
[1:30:58] gave him a a message book. Guy took the
[1:31:01] book and read it. He gave it back the
[1:31:03] NEXT DAY. GIVE IT BACK TO HIM. HE SAID,
[1:31:05] 'I DIDN'T LIKE IT. WHAT? WHAT? WHAT
[1:31:07] HAPPENED TO the book? WHAT WAS WRONG
[1:31:08] WITH THE MESSAGE? SAYS, "IN THAT BOOK,
[1:31:10] THAT MAN called me a buzzard."
[1:31:13] And the brother took it back. He says,
[1:31:15] "Man, cuz in that book, that brother
[1:31:17] called me an eagle.
[1:31:23] You hear what you want to hear, I'm
[1:31:24] going to hear what God is saying to me."
[1:31:27] God called me an eagle.
[1:31:31] Amen. And God told me yes
[1:31:34] and that I don't need a second opinion
[1:31:36] on that. Is that right? Now,
[1:31:40] even in his permissive will, God still
[1:31:45] moves
[1:31:47] and makes blessings happen even when a
[1:31:51] man is walking in their permissive will.
[1:31:55] Genesis chapter 20, Abraham actually
[1:31:58] lied to this king. And when he lied to
[1:32:02] the king,
[1:32:04] uh um the Lord didn't hold it against
[1:32:07] him. He could have. He probably some
[1:32:09] would say he should have, but when
[1:32:12] Aimilec went to take Sarah, the Lord
[1:32:14] came to him in a dream by night. Genesis
[1:32:16] chapter 20:es 1 and read on down. You'll
[1:32:19] see we're all familiar with the story.
[1:32:23] And Aimilec comes back to Abraham says,
[1:32:26] "You trying to deceive me? I asked you
[1:32:29] if that was your sister or your wife and
[1:32:32] you told me it was your sister." And but
[1:32:34] the sovereign God came down and
[1:32:37] corrected Aimilec.
[1:32:39] Even though Abraham, he shouldn't have
[1:32:41] left from the promised land. Number one.
[1:32:44] Number two, HE WAS LYING, BUT HE STILL
[1:32:47] WAS God's prophet. And the blessing of
[1:32:50] the Lord was still upon him even in his
[1:32:55] permissive will condition.
[1:32:58] Elijah in 2 Kings chapter 2, you all are
[1:33:01] familiar with it. Those young children,
[1:33:04] as Elijah went forth, the young children
[1:33:07] begin to call him baldheaded. And the
[1:33:11] scripture says that Elijah turned and
[1:33:14] cursed them in the name of the Lord.
[1:33:19] Now, OKAY, THAT'S NOT FAIR. THESE ARE
[1:33:22] JUST little children. I don't even know
[1:33:24] how old they are. If they're even the
[1:33:26] age of accountability, I don't know. But
[1:33:28] see, that gift was sovereignly given to
[1:33:32] Elijah. And he got to be careful with
[1:33:34] that gift now because he can use it to
[1:33:37] hurt or to harm or to help. In this
[1:33:40] case, they got him on a BAD DAY. THEY
[1:33:43] GOT HIM IN HIS temper and they called
[1:33:45] him baldheaded. And Elijah turned in the
[1:33:50] name of the Let's read the scripture.
[1:33:52] Y'all looking at me? Second Kings
[1:33:55] chapter 2 quickly, briefly.
[1:33:58] Do I have it here?
[1:34:04] Second Kings chapter 2.
[1:34:07] came to pass in verse number
[1:34:11] C.
[1:34:16] Is that what I wanted?
[1:34:20] Oh my.
[1:34:22] Maybe it's first king shepherd. Tell say
[1:34:24] it again.
[1:34:26] Tell me.
[1:34:29] Thank you. And he went up from thence
[1:34:32] unto Bethl, and he was going up by the
[1:34:35] way, and there came forth little
[1:34:36] children out of the city, and mocked
[1:34:39] him, and said unto him, "Go up, thou
[1:34:41] bald head. Go up, thou bald head." I
[1:34:46] mean, think about it, saints. They just
[1:34:48] said a few words. I mean, it was a few
[1:34:51] words. Was it worthy of death? Look at
[1:34:54] your neighbor and ask them, "Is that
[1:34:56] worthy of death?" You called a man
[1:34:58] baldheaded.
[1:35:00] You called the wrong man baldheaded.
[1:35:03] That's what you did. You called God's
[1:35:06] prophet baldheaded. Now, if you calling
[1:35:09] your friends baldheaded, call him
[1:35:11] baldheaded. You call a fake God
[1:35:13] baldheaded, call it baldheaded. DON'T
[1:35:16] MESS WITH THIS MAN RIGHT HERE. AND THEY
[1:35:18] CALLED HIM BALDHEADED. AND LOOK WHAT THE
[1:35:21] SCRIPTURE SAYS. Verse number 24. For he
[1:35:24] turned back and looked on them and
[1:35:27] cursed them in the name of the Lord.
[1:35:32] And there came forth two she bears out
[1:35:34] of the wood
[1:35:37] and tear 40 and two children of them.
[1:35:42] They didn't touch Elijah. Notice that
[1:35:45] they was in the woods somewhere AND OUT
[1:35:48] OF NOWHERE they come. The prophet of God
[1:35:52] under grace and truth after Calvary
[1:35:55] under the baptism of THE HOLY GHOST
[1:35:57] SHOWS US what took place here. He says
[1:36:01] that was not the Holy Spirit
[1:36:04] moving Elijah. IT WAS AN ANGRY PROPHET
[1:36:08] THAT BY THE SOVEREIGNITY OF GOD, HE HAD
[1:36:11] THIS POWER AND HE USED IT
[1:36:15] and God didn't take it away from him. So
[1:36:18] even the permissive will of God, God
[1:36:20] will still bless, there's still an
[1:36:23] anointing there. Can I go a little
[1:36:24] further? Let's take Moses in Numbers
[1:36:28] chapter 20 and verse number 11. Here's
[1:36:31] Moses. He goes forward and he strikes
[1:36:35] the rock. I have to read this one. Let's
[1:36:37] take Numbers chapter 20 quickly.
[1:36:45] And you know people running around today
[1:36:47] talking about what's fair and what's not
[1:36:48] fair. Nobody has a right to say what's
[1:36:51] fair if it ain't from God's word. God is
[1:36:54] the one who says what's fair and what's
[1:36:57] not fair. He created the rules and the
[1:37:01] laws. It's amazing how people want God's
[1:37:04] love, but they don't want his judgment.
[1:37:08] They want his love and the the warm
[1:37:12] fuzzy feeling that God loves every He
[1:37:15] does love everybody. But what's the
[1:37:17] other side of love?
[1:37:20] You wouldn't even know what love is if
[1:37:23] you didn't know what judgment was. Is
[1:37:26] that right? Numbers chapter 20 verse
[1:37:29] number 11. Moses lifted up his hand.
[1:37:32] Let's see.
[1:37:36] No, let's go up a little bit further
[1:37:38] where the Lord is telling him what to
[1:37:40] do. And he does say, "And the Lord spake
[1:37:42] unto Moses." Verse seven, "Take thy rod
[1:37:45] and gather thou the assembly together.
[1:37:48] Thou and Aaron thy brother. Speak unto
[1:37:52] the rock before their eyes." What' he
[1:37:54] tell them to do?
[1:37:56] Speak unto I think you two or three
[1:37:58] saints is helping me preach today.
[1:38:01] Come on, somebody.
[1:38:04] Y'all going to help me preach?
[1:38:06] I know y'all want me to leave. I will
[1:38:08] leave as soon as I'm done. I will leave.
[1:38:13] I have to create value. All right. So, I
[1:38:16] know you all love me. But here what the
[1:38:18] prophet said. Here what the the
[1:38:19] scripture says. Take thy rod and speak
[1:38:21] ye unto the rock before their eyes, and
[1:38:24] it shall give forth his water, and thou
[1:38:28] shalt bring forth to them water out of
[1:38:32] the rock. So thou shalt give the
[1:38:35] congregation and their beasts drinks. So
[1:38:38] the Lord clearly tells them to speak. Do
[1:38:40] it before their eyes so the people can
[1:38:42] see that the spoken word has the power.
[1:38:47] Moses took the rod from before the Lord
[1:38:49] as he commanded him. Verse 9. And Moses
[1:38:52] said to Aaron, "Gather the congregation
[1:38:54] congregation together before the rock,
[1:38:56] and he said unto them, here now ye
[1:38:58] rebels must we fetch water out of this
[1:39:02] rock. AND MOSES LIFTED up his hand, AND
[1:39:06] WITH HIS ROD HE SMOKED THE ROCK TWICE,
[1:39:10] and the water came out abundantly.
[1:39:15] And the congregation drank, AND THEIR
[1:39:19] BEAST ALSO. And the Lord spake unto
[1:39:21] Moses and Aaron, because you believe me
[1:39:24] not to sanctify me in the eyes of the
[1:39:25] children of Israel, therefore ye shall
[1:39:28] not bring this congregation into the
[1:39:30] land which I have given them. What's the
[1:39:33] big deal here? The big deal is I told
[1:39:36] you to speak
[1:39:38] and you smoked the rock twice.
[1:39:42] NOW you're not going into the promised
[1:39:44] land. Well, it's not that big of a deal.
[1:39:46] Lord, just pardon it. They was thirsty.
[1:39:48] They all got water anyways. What's the
[1:39:51] big deal? Speak it or hid it. They got
[1:39:53] me upset. I was under pressure. That's
[1:39:55] not a crime enough, Lord, to keep me out
[1:39:57] of the promised land. Lord, all I've
[1:39:59] been through. Look at my ministry. I
[1:40:01] CAME OUT OF EGYPT. I WENT THROUGH ALL
[1:40:03] THAT STUFF. I FORSAKE PHARAOH AND ALL OF
[1:40:05] THAT. AND YOU GOING TO KEEP ME OUT OF
[1:40:06] THE PROMISED LAND OVER THIS ONE? I TOLD
[1:40:09] you to speak.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; And he smoked the rock twice.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Some might SAY THAT'S NOT FAIR. WE DON'T
[1:40:18] HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY WHAT'S FAIR AND
[1:40:20] WHAT'S NOT FAIR. THE SOVEREIGN GOD LAID
[1:40:23] IT OUT THERE.
[1:40:25] NOTICE, he was outside of the perfect
[1:40:27] will of God. He did WHAT GOD TOLD HIM
[1:40:30] NOT TO DO, BUT HE HAD THE POWER AND GOD
[1:40:33] STILL HONORED IT. WHY?
[1:40:38] Because the sovereignity of his gifts.
[1:40:42] There's a lot of gifted people are going
[1:40:44] to go to hell.
[1:40:46] The gift came from their creator.
[1:40:50] The opportunity to serve the Lord came
[1:40:52] from him. And they will find themselves
[1:40:55] in hell, gifted as they were, talented
[1:40:59] as they was, because they rejected. You
[1:41:01] say, "WELL, MY GIFT, MY GIFT, your gift
[1:41:05] was sovereignly given. YOU HAD NO CHOICE
[1:41:08] ON WHAT COLOR your eyes would be. YOU
[1:41:11] HAD NO CHOICE WHETHER YOU BE BLACKHEAD
[1:41:13] OR REDHEAD OR BLONDE HEAD. YOU HAD NO
[1:41:16] CHOICE OF THE RACE THAT YOU WERE BORN
[1:41:19] IN. SO YOU CAN'T FLEX AGAINST YOUR RACE.
[1:41:21] GOD MADE YOU WHO YOU ARE OR YOUR
[1:41:23] IDENTITY, HOW TALL YOU ARE OR HOW
[1:41:25] TALENTED YOU ARE. THAT WAS SOVEREIGNLY
[1:41:28] GIVEN.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; The most important thing is his
[1:41:34] sovereign word. Can I get a witness
[1:41:37] today?
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; His word, it means everything.
[1:41:41] WE HOLD STEADY TO HIS WORD, NOT TO A
[1:41:44] GIFT, NOT TO AN EMOTION. WE HOLD STEADY
[1:41:48] WITH HIS WORD.
[1:41:50] AMEN.
[1:41:52] Because he's a sovereign God. Remember,
[1:41:55] ever whom he blesses,
[1:41:58] they are blessed. Ever who is cursed,
[1:42:02] they are cursed.
[1:42:04] Can we take one more example?
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; In the Garden of Eden, Genesis chapter
[1:42:08] 4, look at our sister Eve.
[1:42:11] The Jehovah Witnesses believe that Adam
[1:42:13] is lost,
[1:42:15] eternally separated.
[1:42:21] But we know that Adam was operating in
[1:42:25] the grand scheme as a savior. He was
[1:42:29] operating as Christ. Is that right?
[1:42:32] Genesis chapter 4. Look at what happens
[1:42:34] here.
[1:42:37] Can I take my time?
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Adam knew his wife Eve. Verse one. And
[1:42:41] she conceived and bear said what?
[1:42:46] I've gotten a man from who?
[1:42:50] From the Lord.
[1:42:53] This throws so many of those
[1:42:57] Pentecostals that are in the
[1:42:59] denomination. The denominationals,
[1:43:02] they say prove that Cain
[1:43:05] was the son of Adam. But there's no
[1:43:07] scripture that says that Cain was Adam's
[1:43:10] son. Cain was of that wicked one. The
[1:43:15] scripture tells us. But who allowed it?
[1:43:19] WHO ALLOWED IT? GOD ALLOW. YOU SAY,
[1:43:23] "WELL, LORD, IF IT WAS YOUR PERFECT
[1:43:25] WILL, YOU WOULD HAVE CRUSHED CAIN AND
[1:43:27] NOT LET HIM LIVE." Doesn't work that
[1:43:29] way. HE ALLOWS THINGS TO H ALLOWED
[1:43:33] PHARAOH TO COME FORTH. HE ALLOWED YOU TO
[1:43:36] GO THROUGH WHATEVER YOU'RE GOING
[1:43:38] THROUGH. BUT HE'S THE SOVEREIGN GOD.
[1:43:42] HE'S GOT IT all under control.
[1:43:45] Amen. And when this revelation strikes,
[1:43:49] you move in the FAITH KNOWING THAT GOD
[1:43:54] HAS MY LIFE IN HIS HANDS. IT WILL BE AS
[1:43:59] GOD SAID IT WILL BE. THE BLESSING WILL
[1:44:02] COME AS GOD SENDS THE BLESSING.
[1:44:10] Can I take a quotation in the message
[1:44:13] paradox? I don't have it here before me,
[1:44:16] but I think the saints are listening to
[1:44:17] this in Phoenix in Tucson this morning.
[1:44:22] Let me find it quickly.
[1:44:26] Paradox
[1:44:28] here. Look what the prophet of God says
[1:44:29] here.
[1:44:32] Can I read it for you?
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:39] Paragraph number 44 in the message
[1:44:42] paradox.
[1:44:53] Let's see here.
[1:45:01] Okay.
[1:45:12] Paragraph number 49. Yes.
[1:45:25] Burger 48. I had a vision a few weeks
[1:45:28] ago, about three weeks now, this coming
[1:45:32] Tuesday, that drove me to my knees out
[1:45:36] in the wilderness to fast and pray. I
[1:45:39] put on be it cold, heavy insulated
[1:45:42] underclo so to use on the hunting trips
[1:45:46] so I wouldn't freeze up. Around there in
[1:45:49] my cave and in the woods, I went up.
[1:45:52] Someone said, 'Well, brother Random, did
[1:45:54] you go up to seek? You ought to have
[1:45:56] went up to seek a vision from the Lord.
[1:45:58] I says, 'N no, you don't go. You don't
[1:46:02] do it that way. You can't pull nothing
[1:46:05] out of God.
[1:46:08] See, that's the reason people keep
[1:46:09] saying on interviews saying, "Ask the
[1:46:11] Lord. Just stay with it. Just stay with
[1:46:14] it." I had a word of the Lord to take to
[1:46:17] brother Neville about prophesying over
[1:46:20] everyone comes by this altar here. God
[1:46:24] told him really called him down about
[1:46:26] it. See, don't do that. You'll shove him
[1:46:30] out into the flesh and then you'll have
[1:46:32] a false prophet. See? See? Let him do
[1:46:36] just as the spirit leads him to do it.
[1:46:40] See? DON'T TRY TO PULL NOTHING OUT OF
[1:46:44] GOD BECAUSE YOU CAN'T do it. He'll only
[1:46:47] speak. Like Balam, THE HIRELING PROPHET
[1:46:49] SAID, "I CAN ONLY SPEAK what God puts in
[1:46:52] my mouth. Otherwise, I can't say it."
[1:46:55] And that's the same thing like I I like
[1:46:58] this system that they got now so that I
[1:47:00] that I can find out what just what the
[1:47:02] Lord would have do. That's very good.
[1:47:06] Jesus went into the wilderness to fast
[1:47:09] after the Holy Ghost had come upon him.
[1:47:13] John bare record seeing the spirit of
[1:47:15] God come upon him and he was filled with
[1:47:17] the power of God, God in him. And then
[1:47:20] he went into the wilderness to fast
[1:47:22] afterwards,
[1:47:24] not before for the Holy Ghost to come on
[1:47:28] him, but he went in and fasted after the
[1:47:31] Holy Ghost came on him. See now in the
[1:47:35] vision I might say and brother Benam
[1:47:38] continues on. So we know there's
[1:47:41] scriptures that tells us to seek the
[1:47:42] Lord and that's absolutely appropriate.
[1:47:45] It's the Holy Spirit in you that would
[1:47:47] cause you to even seek the Lord. Seek
[1:47:49] the Lord. Search the Lord while he may
[1:47:51] be found. And there's places where you
[1:47:53] can lay aside your food and dinners and
[1:47:57] those things so you can get in the right
[1:47:59] f frame for spiritual things. When you
[1:48:02] deny the natural, it opens the door for
[1:48:05] the spiritual. We understand all those
[1:48:07] principles. We understand that. But we
[1:48:11] also understand that we don't go to try
[1:48:13] to pull anything out of God.
[1:48:17] God is going to do it sovereignly.
[1:48:20] So here's in the Brandham tabernacle,
[1:48:22] brother Neville with the gift of
[1:48:25] prophecy over the people using God
[1:48:27] working that gift using that gift and
[1:48:29] then people coming to him and then
[1:48:31] people pulling on him. He said would
[1:48:33] have made a false prophet. You know I
[1:48:35] thank God for this message. I really
[1:48:38] thank God you you know the Pentecostal
[1:48:40] church couldn't teach you this. They
[1:48:43] can't teach you these operations and
[1:48:44] these little, you know, the little
[1:48:46] details and the technicalities and
[1:48:49] working with gifts and working with
[1:48:51] talented people. People that are gifted
[1:48:54] and talented has to come under the
[1:48:58] discipline of the sovereign word of the
[1:49:01] Lord. There is no gift that gets above
[1:49:05] the word like the gift is more fresh
[1:49:08] than the word itself. It don't get no
[1:49:11] fresher than the word itself. That is
[1:49:14] God himself
[1:49:16] speaking
[1:49:17] in his sovereign ways that he likes to
[1:49:20] operate. Amen. I certainly hope that
[1:49:24] these things are helping you today.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; So he forgives,
[1:49:30] he blesses,
[1:49:32] he judges whom he willth.
[1:49:39] He decides who to forgive. He decides
[1:49:43] who's to bless. He decides who's to
[1:49:46] judge when he chose Abraham in Genesis
[1:49:50] chapter 15. He just out of nowhere
[1:49:54] seemingly just like Abraham was lucky
[1:49:57] maybe or maybe he was just like whatever
[1:50:00] it was, God chose Abram and he said,
[1:50:03] "I'm going to bless you and your seed
[1:50:06] after you." Who's going to change that?
[1:50:09] WHO'S GOING TO MODIFY THAT?
[1:50:12] Who's got a problem with the Hebrews or
[1:50:14] the Jewish nation?
[1:50:17] If they got a problem with the Jews,
[1:50:18] they got a problem with God.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:24] The word of the Lord is true. He chose
[1:50:27] them. They're his people. He I don't
[1:50:30] like I don't like this. Well, stop.
[1:50:33] Stop. Stop. Stop. Let's take the Jews
[1:50:34] off of it. What about him choosing you?
[1:50:38] Aren't you grateful that he chose you?
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Isn't that a nice feeling
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; to be chosen by God?
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; To have the clean bill of rights that I
[1:50:52] love you and I want you to be a part of
[1:50:55] my bride. Isn't that a beautiful
[1:50:58] thought? What did you do to deserve
[1:51:01] that? HOW MUCH MONEY WAS IN YOUR ACCOUNT
[1:51:05] FOR GOD TO COME YOUR WAY? HOW BLESSED
[1:51:09] ARE WE TO KNOW THAT GOD IN HIS GRACE AND
[1:51:13] HIS MERCY, the God of the universe, came
[1:51:15] down and called me.
[1:51:18] He called you. Now he, the sovereign
[1:51:22] one, has called me. Now I walk in that
[1:51:27] sovereignty,
[1:51:29] that sovereignty as a believer.
[1:51:34] not asking others to join me to believe
[1:51:36] with me. What time is it? Oh my. Sorry.
[1:51:41] Oh my. It's 12 o'clock.
[1:51:44] I was going to go all the way to 12:30
[1:51:46] because I'm used to staying on the half
[1:51:48] hour here,
[1:51:50] but y'all can't take that.
[1:51:53] Yes, you could. I know. Sister D said,
[1:51:55] "Yes, we can." All right. So, God bless
[1:51:58] you. I didn't know I've been going that
[1:51:59] long. But God is sovereign. And when he
[1:52:03] chooses you, he chooses whom he's going
[1:52:06] to bless, who he's going to punish, who
[1:52:09] he's going to judge. You know, this is
[1:52:11] why
[1:52:13] friends that are around you can get away
[1:52:15] with things that you can't get away
[1:52:17] with.
[1:52:20] That's right. There's others that will
[1:52:23] do things that you can't do, and they
[1:52:26] look like they're actually doing better.
[1:52:27] They actually prosper. They just bought
[1:52:29] another house.
[1:52:32] They got another property and they told
[1:52:33] you about it. It's like, man, I can't.
[1:52:35] They go and they go to the casino and
[1:52:38] they win at the casino.
[1:52:43] And here I am struggling. I DON'T EVEN
[1:52:44] HAVE ANY GAS IN MY TRUCK.
[1:52:48] I'm barely making ends meet.
[1:52:51] My health care, MY WELFARE, MY WELFARE,
[1:52:54] WHATEVER, IT'S ALL RUNNING OUT.
[1:52:58] And your neighbor who NEVER GOES TO
[1:53:00] CHURCH NOWHERE IS ALWAYS BUYING THE
[1:53:03] NEWEST MODEL
[1:53:06] truck or boat or whatever. THEY'RE JUST
[1:53:09] BLESSED AND JUST STRIVING AND JUST MONEY
[1:53:12] COMING OUT FROM EVERYWHERE.
[1:53:17] AND IF YOU TRY TO DO THAT,
[1:53:20] MAN, you'll get sick and be laid up in
[1:53:22] the hospital somewhere.
[1:53:24] And that's God's sovereign grace to you.
[1:53:28] Think about that. He loves you.
[1:53:32] He's blessed you. He desired you. That
[1:53:36] wasn't an accident. That was on purpose.
[1:53:40] He's a sovereign God. Can't we have
[1:53:42] faith to say that he's in charge of our
[1:53:44] lives?
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; He's going to take it. He's going to
[1:53:47] bring us all the way through. He's got
[1:53:49] it covered. God bless you, saints, so
[1:53:51] much. I had a few more little areas
[1:53:53] here, but God bless you richly. In South
[1:53:58] Africa, brother Bannon was on that
[1:53:59] Africa trip report. The angel of the
[1:54:02] Lord spoke to him and told him, "Go to
[1:54:04] Johannesburg." And those brothers says,
[1:54:06] "No, you're going over here. You're
[1:54:07] going to Cape Town over here." He says,
[1:54:09] "No." The Lord told me, "No." And they
[1:54:11] argued. He says, "No." And then finally
[1:54:13] the Lord told him, "Go with them, but
[1:54:16] you're going to pay for it." They went
[1:54:19] in the permissive will of God. God still
[1:54:22] came down and blessed the meetings,
[1:54:24] healed people, delivered them, and they
[1:54:26] were in his permissive will. His perfect
[1:54:28] will was to stay in Johannesburg.
[1:54:31] So, saints of God, what do we want? Do
[1:54:35] we want to just get by? Do we want to be
[1:54:36] blessed? Or do we want God's perfect
[1:54:39] will in our lives?
[1:54:45] His perfect will is his sovereign will
[1:54:48] to us. And thank the Lord Jesus for it.
[1:54:50] God bless you, Richie. Let us let us
[1:54:53] pray. Brother Craig, why don't you come
[1:54:54] and sing a few songs of Zion?
[1:55:00] Lord Jesus, we thank you for your grace
[1:55:02] and mercy to us. We thank you for your
[1:55:04] word today. Oh Lord, I pray that
[1:55:09] the truth of it will settle in our
[1:55:12] hearts and minds. Um Lord, as we take
[1:55:15] the word of God and know that
[1:55:18] what we see in the word is because you
[1:55:20] showed it to us and that no matter no no
[1:55:25] amount of argument or manipulating
[1:55:30] is going to change your word. Your word
[1:55:33] is true. So Lord, we want to align
[1:55:35] oursel with that. We want to align
[1:55:38] oursel with your perfect will in our
[1:55:41] lives,
[1:55:42] Lord. And that
[1:55:45] as a cry upon my heart came this week
[1:55:48] that we all need a sovereign move of God
[1:55:51] in our life. I need it. This church
[1:55:54] needs it. Every individual needs you to
[1:55:57] come down sovereignly
[1:55:59] and fill them with the power of the Holy
[1:56:04] Ghost. And when you do that, Lord, it'll
[1:56:07] be done.
[1:56:09] Reveal your word to me. reveal it to
[1:56:12] your people. Pour out these good gifts,
[1:56:15] these good things to every heart, to
[1:56:17] everyone.
[1:56:18] You can do it, Lord. You're the only one
[1:56:20] that can do it. We humbly wait upon
[1:56:22] thee. We're not looking for another,
[1:56:24] Lord. We're looking and staying with
[1:56:26] thee, oh God. I pray you'll bless this.
[1:56:30] May this settle. May this help in Jesus
[1:56:33] name we pray. Amen.
[1:56:37] God bless you so much. Amen. Brother, I
[1:56:41] bless you. Thank you. I bless you.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Sister, what song is that?
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; I don't think I know it.
[1:57:16] I don't know it.
[1:57:19] What key are we in?
[1:57:21] Let's try E flat.
[1:57:25] Teach me Lord
[1:57:27] to wait
[1:57:31] down on my knees
[1:57:36] till your own good time.
[1:57:42] You answer
[1:57:45] my please.
[1:57:48] Teach me not
[1:57:50] to rely
[1:57:53] on what others
[1:57:57] do,
[1:57:58] but to wait
[1:58:01] in prayer
[1:58:04] for an answer
[1:58:07] from you. Number 10 in the course book.
[1:58:10] They that wait
[1:58:12] upon the Lord
[1:58:15] shall renew
[1:58:18] their strength.
[1:58:21] They shall mount up with wings as
[1:58:28] an eagle.
[1:58:33] They should run
[1:58:35] and not be weery.
[1:58:39] They shall walk and not faint.
[1:58:44] Teach me Lord,
[1:58:47] teach me Lord
[1:58:50] to wait. Amen. Teach me Lord to wait.
[1:58:56] Teach me Lord why hearts are a flame to
[1:58:59] wait.
[1:59:02] My hearts are
[1:59:05] a flame,
[1:59:10] my pride
[1:59:13] and call on
[1:59:16] your name.
[1:59:19] Keep my faith
[1:59:22] renewed.
[1:59:24] Keep my eyes
[1:59:27] on thee.
[1:59:30] Help me be
[1:59:33] on this earth
[1:59:36] what you want me
[1:59:39] to because your sovereign Lord made that
[1:59:42] way
[1:59:44] upon the Lord
[1:59:47] shall renew
[1:59:50] their strength.
[1:59:53] They shall mount up with wings as
[1:59:59] an eagle.
[2:00:05] They should run
[2:00:07] and not be weary.
[2:00:10] They shall walk and not faint.
[2:00:16] Teach me Lord.
[2:00:19] Teach me Lord
[2:00:21] to wait.
[2:00:27] Sweep over
[2:00:30] my soul.
[2:00:33] Sweep over
[2:00:36] my soul.
[2:00:39] Sweet spirit
[2:00:42] sweep over
[2:00:44] my
[2:00:46] soul.
[2:00:50] My rest
[2:00:53] is complete
[2:00:56] while I sit
[2:00:59] at your feet.
[2:01:02] Sweet spirit,
[2:01:05] sweep over
[2:01:08] my soul. Amen. Sweep over my soul.
[2:01:13] Sweep over
[2:01:16] my soul.
[2:01:19] Sweep over
[2:01:22] my soul.
[2:01:25] Sweet spirit,
[2:01:28] sweep over
[2:01:30] my soul.
[2:01:36] My rest
[2:01:39] is complete.
[2:01:42] While I sit
[2:01:45] at your feet,
[2:01:48] sweet spirit,
[2:01:51] sweep over
[2:01:54] my soul. Amen. Let's all stand as we
[2:01:57] sing. What a day it will be. What a day
[2:02:03] that will be
[2:02:05] when my Jesus
[2:02:08] I shall see.
[2:02:11] When I look
[2:02:14] upon his face,
[2:02:17] the one who saved
[2:02:19] me by his grace.
[2:02:23] It takes
[2:02:25] me by the hand and leads me to
[2:02:31] the promised land.
[2:02:34] What a day.
[2:02:37] Glorious day
[2:02:40] that will be. Amen. What a day that will
[2:02:43] be. Looking forward to it. What a day
[2:02:49] that will be
[2:02:51] when my Jesus
[2:02:54] I shall see.
[2:02:57] When I look
[2:03:00] upon his face,
[2:03:03] the one who saves
[2:03:06] me by his grace.
[2:03:09] And he takes
[2:03:11] me by his hand
[2:03:14] and lead me to
[2:03:17] the promised land.
[2:03:20] What a day,
[2:03:23] glorious day
[2:03:26] that will be.
[2:03:31] Amen. Heavenly Father, we thank you, oh
[2:03:34] God, that you have
[2:03:36] provided your word for us this morning.
[2:03:40] Lord, there's nothing else to say but
[2:03:43] that you are sovereign, Lord. And we
[2:03:46] thank you, oh Lord, for thy perfect will
[2:03:48] in our lives.
[2:03:50] Help us, oh Lord, to truly follow the
[2:03:54] leading of thy Holy Spirit
[2:03:57] that we would never fall out of favor
[2:04:00] with thee.
[2:04:02] Lord, not even thy permissive will
[2:04:06] or out of thy will entirely, but bless
[2:04:09] us, oh God, to stay right there in thy
[2:04:13] perfect will,
[2:04:15] Lord, knowing, oh God, that you
[2:04:19] have everything for us that we need.
[2:04:23] We pray, oh Lord, that you would bless
[2:04:25] us as we go our way this morning, Lord,
[2:04:30] until we meet again, Lord, in
[2:04:32] fellowship,
[2:04:34] forsaking not to fellowship with one
[2:04:36] another and gather together.
[2:04:40] Bless us, oh Lord, as we are dismissed
[2:04:44] in Jesus Christ's holy name.
[2:04:47] Amen. and you are dismissed quietly for
[2:04:50] those who might want to remain and pray.
[2:04:54] Amen.
