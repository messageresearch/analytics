[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] Amen. Good morning everyone. Can we all
[0:08] stand? We'll open up in a word of
[0:10] prayer.
[0:13] Heavenly Father, we're thankful to be
[0:15] here this morning. Lord, we just want to
[0:18] bless and honor your name this day for
[0:21] all you have done for us, Father. Lord,
[0:24] for all you will do for us. God, you've
[0:27] given us an understanding,
[0:30] Lord, by your Holy Spirit, Lord, for the
[0:34] promises in the in the Bible, Lord, for
[0:37] this day. You've opened our eyes,
[0:39] Father. We're thankful for that. We're
[0:41] thankful that it it's light in the
[0:43] evening time. Father, as we listen to a
[0:47] small portion of this tape, we pray,
[0:49] Lord, that you just anointed to our
[0:51] ears. Help us to hear and to see what
[0:54] you'd have us this morning in the adult
[0:56] Sunday school class. Bless the children
[0:59] also, Lord, in their class and
[1:01] everything that would be said and done
[1:03] this day in this place. In the name of
[1:06] Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen.
[1:10] We'll be um listening to the future
[1:13] home, continuing with that of the
[1:15] heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:16] bride. This will be about 20 minutes.
[1:19] We'll start at paragraph 484 and end at
[1:23] 4 521 rather. Can we sing only believe?
[1:29] Only
[1:31] believe.
[1:35] Only
[1:37] believe.
[1:41] All things are possible.
[1:46] Only
[1:49] believe.
[1:52] Only
[1:54] believe.
[1:58] Only
[2:00] believe.
[2:04] All things are possible.
[2:09] Only
[2:11] believe.
[2:14] You may be seated. Brother Brennan.
[2:17] [Music]
[2:23] &gt;&gt; See, and when Moses returns back in
[2:26] Elijah for Revelations 11, there will
[2:28] still be prophets.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; And over
[2:34] &gt;&gt; in the last city where the lamb is the
[2:36] light, I'll know you, brother McKenna.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; I'll know you, my people.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; My jewels in the crown.
[2:45] When they come from the east and the
[2:47] west to the city when 1,500 miles square
[2:51] she will be sitting there
[2:53] &gt;&gt; in the city built for square.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; When he's sitting there in the holy
[2:57] mount where God sets upon the mount and
[2:59] Jesus on the throne and the golden
[3:02] trumpet sounds when Joseph leaves to
[3:03] walk down through the paradise and the
[3:05] children of God fall upon their knees
[3:07] and worship him knowing they were
[3:08] redeemed.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[3:15] Some
[3:17] times I grow homesick for heaven and the
[3:21] glory there shall behold.
[3:24] What a joy that will be when my savior I
[3:28] see in that beautiful city of gold.
[3:34] I'm
[3:35] bound for that beautiful city
[3:39] the Lord has prepared. Isaiah said in
[3:42] Isaiah 9:6, "And of his peace and of his
[3:47] increase there shall be no."
[3:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:51] &gt;&gt; The government shall be upon his
[3:53] shoulders. His name will be called
[3:55] counselor, prince of peace, the mighty
[3:58] God, the everlasting father. And the
[4:01] government shall be upon his shoulders,
[4:02] and of his increase, of his peace there
[4:04] is no
[4:06] &gt;&gt; even the animals is there. Oh my. The
[4:11] bear
[4:13] will be gentle and the wolf will be tame
[4:18] and the lion shall lay down by the lamb
[4:24] and the beast from the wild will be led
[4:29] by a child.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to be changed.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; I'll be changed for this creature that I
[4:36] am
[4:37] &gt;&gt; when that day come. from going to that
[4:39] city. I'm bound to that beautiful city.
[4:43] I feel the redeeming power in my whole
[4:46] heart. Now, if this isn't sold out,
[4:49] throw my life away. I've taught others
[4:51] deceitful things. But when I look down
[4:54] and see that the promise he made of this
[4:56] day and see it vindicated and look at
[4:59] this, 1500 mile square congregation
[5:01] said, "You're an elect. It's been called
[5:03] from denominations and races and creeds
[5:06] and things. gathered together. As I see
[5:09] the word vindicating itself, I know
[5:11] beyond one shadow of doubt,
[5:14] &gt;&gt; the jewels of my crown will outshine
[5:17] everything in the world at that day.
[5:19] There will come a time, people, we're
[5:21] not gathering here for in vain. We're
[5:23] only waiting for that time. Amen.
[5:25] &gt;&gt; It is very very late but Jesus is still
[5:31] very very near
[5:34] &gt;&gt; and his glory is wonderful. His name
[5:37] shall be called counselor. That city can
[5:40] you see it?
[5:42] &gt;&gt; There's where the bride and the groom
[5:45] will settle and never again.
[5:49] Now, if you think it's wonderful when we
[5:51] drive hundreds of miles to set your and
[5:53] feet on his word, which this is only a
[5:57] shadow, what will it be when we live in
[6:00] the city with him?
[6:02] &gt;&gt; When I live next door neighbor to you.
[6:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; And when we eat of those trees and we
[6:08] will walk in those streets, when we walk
[6:10] up those streets of gold to the
[6:12] fountain,
[6:13] &gt;&gt; drink from the fountain.
[6:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Walk into the paradises of God
[6:17] with angels hovering the earth singing
[6:18] the anthems.
[6:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a day that will be.
[6:23] &gt;&gt; It's worth all.
[6:27] &gt;&gt; The road seems rugged. Sometimes it gets
[6:29] hard,
[6:31] &gt;&gt; but oh, it'll be so little when I see
[6:33] him.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; So little. What were the bad names and
[6:36] things that they've said? What will that
[6:38] be when I see him in that beautiful,
[6:41] beautiful city of God? Let's bow our
[6:44] head.
[6:51] I'm bound for that beautiful city
[6:57] my Lord has prepared for his own
[7:02] where all the redeemed of all ages
[7:06] sang glory around the white throne.
[7:11] Sometimes
[7:13] I go home sick for heaven
[7:16] and it glories I there shall behold.
[7:21] What a joy that will be when my savior I
[7:25] see
[7:27] in that beautiful city of gold
[7:33] on the island of Patmas John so
[7:46] [Music]
[7:49] Dear Jesus,
[7:52] this hope, my hope's built on nothing
[7:55] less. Lord,
[7:59] let the mother of my heart,
[8:02] that city,
[8:04] the great king,
[8:06] God, don't let one here perish, please.
[8:10] May we examine our lives again today,
[8:12] Lord, waiting for the coming of the Lord
[8:15] where all them redeemed.
[8:17] How yonder in that great coliseum in
[8:19] Rome where them Christians has eat up
[8:21] the lines. Shall the dust break forth
[8:24] someday?
[8:28] There will be no graveyards on the
[8:29] hillside of glory. No door knobs will
[8:32] hold a funeral wreath.
[8:34] No tear will spot upon it. No, no. No
[8:38] heat up sod, no storms will strike it.
[8:42] It'll all be glorious there.
[8:46] Help us, Lord.
[8:48] If there's one here that's called to
[8:50] this wedding supper of the lamb, this
[8:53] thousand years of millennium reign, and
[8:56] to then enter into the city after the
[8:59] honeymoon is over. The millennium is
[9:01] merely the honeymoon.
[9:04] Then she the bride takes his bridegroom
[9:07] takes his bride home.
[9:10] It's hers her bridegroom his bride.
[9:15] Oh, he's gone to prepare a house since
[9:18] she's become engaged.
[9:21] May we be true to him who is the word
[9:24] for he is the word.
[9:26] Regardless of how others try to sass us,
[9:29] keep us away from it. Lord, draw me
[9:31] nearer.
[9:33] For some
[9:35] times I grow home sing forever
[9:40] and it's glor
[9:43] shall behold.
[9:47] What a joy that will be when my Savior I
[9:53] see
[9:56] in that beautiful
[9:59] city
[10:01] of gold, the future home of the groom
[10:05] and bride. He's coming back
[10:09] to the wedding supper.
[10:12] It's going to be three and a half days.
[10:15] They return again in the millennium on
[10:18] her honeymoon.
[10:21] And then
[10:25] he's going to bring the city into view
[10:27] like the bridegroom taking the bride to
[10:30] her surprise. How the little bride
[10:32] stands there in awe as she looks at her
[10:34] future home.
[10:36] And by faith today, Lord, we see it
[10:38] yonder.
[10:41] It'll be right here on this earth. You
[10:43] promise it.
[10:46] Your church will be completely redeemed
[10:47] one of these days and then your world
[10:49] will be redeemed. The rest of the
[10:51] particles, but first you have redeemed
[10:53] your people, their bodies that's made up
[10:56] of the world.
[10:59] Help us, God. If there's one here who
[11:01] isn't just exactly sure of that, Lord,
[11:03] may they receive it just now. I know
[11:05] it's been long and hot, but people,
[11:09] we won't always be standing here.
[11:13] I won't always be your pastor.
[11:18] Let's make it sure. Is there a way,
[11:21] brother Brandham? Yes.
[11:23] Become a part of the word.
[11:27] A part of the word of today. Can't be a
[11:31] part of the word of Moses day. That
[11:32] part's done made up. That was the feet.
[11:35] We're at the head now.
[11:38] This is Christ. Not the arms time back
[11:40] in Luther. No, this is the head time.
[11:45] Christ the head stone comes to the body.
[11:49] If you're not, just
[11:52] feel exactly right about it. Wherever
[11:54] you can, will you raise up your hand
[11:56] just so I can see you? Let everybody
[11:58] else keep your hands down. God bless
[12:00] you. Say, remember me in prayer, Brother
[12:02] Brandham. I want to be there so bad.
[12:06] I I don't want to miss it, brother. I
[12:09] I'm checking. I'm doing everything I can
[12:10] to pray for me now, will you? God bless
[12:13] you.
[12:17] While you're thinking of it now,
[12:21] just pray. Say, "God, it's in your own
[12:23] heart." See, if you feel something tug
[12:26] tingling at your heart, that's what it
[12:28] is. It's that attribute trying to
[12:29] declare itself.
[12:32] I am bound for that beautiful city
[12:40] my Lord has prepared for his own
[12:46] where all the redeemed of all ages
[12:52] will sing glory around the white throne.
[12:58] Sometimes
[13:00] I grow homesick for heaven
[13:05] and the glories are there shall be. Oh,
[13:10] [Music]
[13:12] what a joy that will be.
[13:16] When my Savior I see
[13:21] in that beautiful
[13:25] city
[13:27] of gold,
[13:30] heavenly father,
[13:32] take us now, Lord,
[13:36] let the great shepherd, the great
[13:38] redeeming shepherd, the great shepherd
[13:42] who left glory knowing that some of the
[13:44] attributes was lost on some great
[13:47] valleys of sin
[13:50] or the wolves and the the animals would
[13:53] soon devour that little sheep. But he
[13:56] left the golden quarters came down into
[14:00] the earth and has made one of us so he
[14:02] could declare the love of God to us.
[14:05] There he found them. Some of them in
[14:08] denominations,
[14:10] some of them in the house of ill fame,
[14:13] some of them on the streets blind, some
[14:16] of them in the hedges and highways.
[14:20] But he redeemed everyone that the father
[14:23] had ordained him to redeem.
[14:27] And he commissioned us that we would
[14:29] live this part of the word for our ages.
[14:33] And we see the great reformation
[14:36] of Luther in that age and of Wesley and
[14:40] the Pentecostal.
[14:42] Now we're looking for the headstone of
[14:44] the city.
[14:48] Oh God, we know the age and the promise
[14:50] that we are given for this day.
[14:53] How that this is to be restored again.
[14:57] The evening light shall ripen the fruit
[14:59] of it.
[15:01] And it shall come to pass that there
[15:03] will be a day that cannot be day or
[15:04] night can be called, but in the evening
[15:07] time it shall be light.
[15:11] That same glorious son of God manifested
[15:14] himself in human flesh up here on the
[15:16] earth, making the promise live itself
[15:18] exactly, blinded to the eyes of the
[15:21] Pharisees and Sadducees and Herodians
[15:23] and so forth. And today it repeats
[15:26] again. The word being manifest just like
[15:30] it was. The word knowing the secret of
[15:33] the heart
[15:35] just exactly the way it was as the
[15:36] scripture said which cannot be broken.
[15:40] Help us God to realize it. Help these
[15:42] now who raise their hands. May they
[15:44] buckle up a little tighter. Shod
[15:47] themselves with the gospel of peace. Put
[15:49] on the full armor of God. Pull the
[15:51] helmet down. Take the shield of faith.
[15:53] march forward from the day on. Granted,
[15:56] Lord, just a little while we'll be
[15:57] summoned.
[15:59] Then the rapture will come. Just a
[16:02] little bitty group like Enoch will be
[16:06] taken up. Then the remnant of the
[16:08] woman's seed that keep the commandments
[16:10] of God, Jews, have the testimony of
[16:12] Jesus Christ, Gentiles will be hunted
[16:15] down like dogs and shall give their life
[16:18] for their testimony.
[16:20] Then one great morning the break of the
[16:23] millennium for the the honeymoon will
[16:26] start and then the rest of the dead live
[16:29] not for the end of the thousand years.
[16:30] Then at the end of the thousand years
[16:32] there was a judgment
[16:35] showing that Hamoth in the ark and Ham
[16:39] is still there in the remnant.
[16:42] Ones that heard it and rejected it will
[16:45] have to be judged. Now grant it, Lord,
[16:47] that we'll not be considered among them,
[16:50] but will be in the call to the wedding
[16:52] supper. For we do recognize Jesus among
[16:55] us today. We're going in with him, out
[16:58] of the world into him. Let us walk forth
[17:00] in that city. Come out with him.
[17:06] Getting old Lord,
[17:08] I ain't got many more sermons to preach.
[17:14] I'm certainly trusting you.
[17:17] I'm looking for that city like my father
[17:20] Abraham did. Is something in me tells
[17:22] it's coming.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; I'm trying everywhere, Lord, to spread
[17:29] the light. Call them. Let not one of
[17:32] these, Lord. How beautifully a while ago
[17:35] you revealed that to me from the
[17:36] circumference of about 1500 miles, just
[17:39] one here and there, are set together
[17:41] today. They're gathered into one little
[17:43] spot.
[17:46] waiting for that city to appear. We
[17:49] profess that we're pilgrims and
[17:50] strangers. We're outcasts.
[17:53] The heathen the world laughs and makes
[17:55] fun. The religious denominations
[17:57] ridicue.
[17:59] But we are not moved by such things.
[18:04] Make us part of the word, Lord.
[18:07] Unmovable.
[18:08] It shall come to pass in the last days.
[18:12] May it be us, Lord. May we be a
[18:13] considerate among them. We ask it in
[18:17] Jesus name. Amen.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[18:31] &gt;&gt; Let's raise our hands like this.
[18:33] I'm
[18:35] bound for that beautiful city.
[18:40] My Lord has prepared for his own
[18:45] where all the redeemed of all ages
[18:50] will sing glories
[19:00] [Music]
[19:03] are there shall be.
[19:07] Oh, what a joy that will be when my
[19:12] Savior I see
[19:15] [Applause]
[19:15] [Music]
[19:16] in that beautiful
[19:19] city
[19:21] of gold.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Now, if we're to dwell in that city
[19:26] together, just shake hands with
[19:27] somebody. Say, "God bless you, pilgrim.
[19:30] Where are you from? Louisiana, Georgia,
[19:32] Mississippi? I'm a pilgrim, too. I'm
[19:35] looking for that city.
[19:46] [Music]
[19:54] and his glories are there shall behold.
[20:00] What a joy that will be. Oh, and might I
[20:05] say here I see
[20:10] in that
[20:13] city
[20:15] of
[20:19] all the bear
[20:22] will be j
[20:25] and w
[20:28] will be t
[20:30] and the li
[20:33] shall lay down
[20:36] following.
[20:37] [Music]
[20:39] Oh yeah.
[20:41] And the be
[20:46] will be led
[20:49] by a child and I'll be changed.
[20:54] Changed from this creature
[20:56] that I am.
[20:59] Oh.
[21:01] Oh. There will be peace.
[21:04] in the valley
[21:07] for me.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, there will be peace
[21:14] in the valley
[21:17] for me.
[21:22] There,
[21:25] no more sad,
[21:27] no more tr
[21:30] I'll see. And there will be peace
[21:35] in the valley.
[21:37] [Music]
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Our invisible king this morning will be
[21:45] made manifest.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; I won't look up on Bill D at 90 years
[21:53] old.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; You won't look up on me at 50.
[21:59] Hallelujah.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; But I'll be changed that day.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; And by the beast from the wild will be
[22:08] led
[22:09] my child. But I'll be changed.
[22:14] Changed from this creature
[22:16] that I won't you be glad.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; Three hairs will be gone the stoop
[22:21] shoulders. But beauty immortal will
[22:24] stand in its likeness.
[22:27] The sun thou shine.
[22:30] [Music]
[22:33] Wonderful
[22:35] for me. Oh Lord, I pray
[22:39] there will be no sadness, no more
[22:42] sorrow, no more trouble.
[22:46] I see.
[22:49] And there will be peace
[22:51] in the valley.
[22:56] Amen.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; That's what we're here for.
[23:21] [Music]

[53:36] Wonderful to be in church with the
[53:38] saints this morning. Our visitors, I see
[53:40] a number of you. I think I go back the
[53:42] longest with Amos because he was around
[53:44] just before I was born and so good to
[53:46] have him. Suzanne and our son this
[53:48] morning. Each one in the back. Just a
[53:51] joy to be with you. Our precious sister
[53:54] Lori that was raised from the dead and
[53:55] still a little bit to go. We've been
[53:57] holding her up. So just love each one.
[54:00] for our Sunday school this morning. We
[54:02] have 12 children in Sunday school, 10
[54:04] Bibles, $15 in the offering.
[54:07] As we approach the Lord in prayer this
[54:09] morning, we've got some we'd like to
[54:11] mention. Brother Jonathan isn't feeling
[54:12] well, but he's well enough to be in
[54:13] church. So, so good to see you, my
[54:15] brother, here on the front row. Brother
[54:17] Jim Alexander is in the hospital, the
[54:20] deacon at Lmark, and that's kind of
[54:23] serious this morning. So, we want to
[54:24] hold up brother Jim Alexander and the
[54:27] battle he's been fighting for his health
[54:28] needs. Our sister Abigail Boyd is not
[54:32] feeling well this morning. Want to hold
[54:33] her up. And certainly the Wartz family.
[54:36] We don't have to remember brother Bobby
[54:38] anymore. He's in a much better
[54:39] condition, a better place. But we
[54:41] certainly want to hold up sister
[54:42] Jennifer, brother Michael, sister Barb,
[54:45] the family, brother Chuck and his uh
[54:47] travels headed there to Minnesota. So
[54:49] let's hold them up. If you got a desire
[54:52] on your heart, let's go to the prayer
[54:53] answering God, the awesome deliver
[54:56] powerful savior that we worship this
[54:58] morning. Dear God, so thankful to be in
[54:59] church many places we could be, but
[55:02] Lord, with the precious saints, and you
[55:04] said you'd meet with us, Lord, a most
[55:06] important guest of honor. We just lift
[55:09] up your name, Lord, and these praises
[55:12] that we have, the the language we we
[55:14] don't have the complete language of the
[55:16] words, but this from our heart, we pray
[55:18] that be a sacrifice, Lord, acceptable
[55:21] and pleasing in your sight. We'll bring
[55:22] tithes and honor tithes and offerings,
[55:25] Lord, in honor of your name, knowing
[55:27] that you own all things, Lord, but we're
[55:29] thankful to bring
[55:31] a portion, Lord, to to just help further
[55:33] the kingdom. We're so grateful for each
[55:35] one. And we know we're going to hear
[55:36] from heaven this morning, Lord. You said
[55:38] just two or three it would take to
[55:40] gather in your name and you'd walk the
[55:42] aisles, Lord. You'd speak to each heart
[55:43] and each life. And so, we claim that
[55:46] this morning through our precious
[55:47] brother Israel, Lord, anoint his lips
[55:49] and our ears to hear something from
[55:51] heaven. We know we're going to go out
[55:52] either a better or the same or a little
[55:54] bit worse. And so we choose this morning
[55:56] to go out a better person as you would
[55:58] speak to each heart and each life, each
[55:59] need. Oh God, some we're missing this
[56:02] morning. Some are needing comfort,
[56:04] encouragement, and we pray that you'd be
[56:06] there with Sister Barb, Brother Michael
[56:08] Wartz, Sister Jennifer, and the family.
[56:10] Lord, just bring them through, Lord, as
[56:12] only you can. May they know our thoughts
[56:14] and prayers and just we would do
[56:16] anything we could possibly do Lord as we
[56:18] put the shoulder to the will and this
[56:20] late hour Lord knowing your coming is
[56:22] very soon. Just thank you for all
[56:23] things. We love you appreciate you our
[56:25] mighty deliverer. the name of our Lord
[56:27] and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. All
[56:29] God's people say,
[56:30] &gt;&gt; "Amen."

[1:08:08] uh and the message. So we have um a few
[1:08:14] moments to go into the word here today

[1:08:32] Lord has something for us.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Um, every time we open up this book,
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; there's something an explosion waiting
[1:08:40] to happen.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Something's ready to jump off
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; and there's some amen moments in this

[1:09:02] of God. That's our 10th anniversary and
[1:09:05] dedicating of this building that will be
[1:09:08] right here. We were going to have to
[1:09:10] split the location with the Assemblies
[1:09:13] of God for Saturday, but that didn't
[1:09:16] work. So, we were all going to be all
[1:09:19] the services will be here. Amen.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God bless you and good to see
[1:09:24] you, Sister Lori, and each of you. So,
[1:09:27] let's stand to our feet. We'll go right
[1:09:28] to the word of the Lord this morning.
[1:09:32] St. John chapter 4,
[1:09:35] Mark chapter 4,
[1:09:39] and
[1:09:41] Revelation
[1:09:44] chapter 1.
[1:09:57] Let's bypass Mark chapter 4 for now.
[1:10:00] Let's just go to St. John chapter 4
[1:10:04] if we could.
[1:10:07] Versus number
[1:10:10] 21.
[1:10:12] And Jesus said unto her,"Woman,
[1:10:16] believe me, the hour cometh, when ye
[1:10:19] shall neither in this mountain, nor yet
[1:10:21] at Jerusalem worship the Father. Ye
[1:10:25] worship, you know not what. We know what
[1:10:27] we worship. For salvation is of the
[1:10:30] Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is,
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; when the true worshippers shall worship
[1:10:38] the Father in spirit and in truth. For
[1:10:41] the father seeketh such
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; to worship him.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll take this scripture over in
[1:10:49] Revelations chapter 2. Revelation
[1:10:52] chapter 1, sorry
[1:10:55] verse one,
[1:11:04] the revelation of Jesus Christ, which
[1:11:06] God gave unto him to show unto his
[1:11:08] servants the things which must shortly
[1:11:12] come to pass. And he sent and signified
[1:11:15] it by his angel unto his servant John,
[1:11:18] who bare record of the word of God, and
[1:11:21] of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of
[1:11:24] all things that he saw. Blessed is he
[1:11:27] that readeth, and they that hear the
[1:11:29] words of this prophecy,
[1:11:32] and keep those things which are written
[1:11:35] therein,
[1:11:37] for the time is at hand. Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we'll take
[1:11:44] um those two scriptures and the title of
[1:11:47] our message this morning is the hour has
[1:11:50] come. The hour has come. Let us pray.
[1:11:53] Lord Jesus,
[1:11:56] I ask for you to help me today and help
[1:11:58] your people to receive from you. And
[1:12:01] Lord, we do what we can to present to
[1:12:05] you our little efforts, our little time
[1:12:08] of study. But Lord, it takes you, the
[1:12:11] great uh revealer of truth. Come down
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; and minister to our hearts.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Give us what we have need of. Lord,
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; help us to see what you want us to see
[1:12:23] and to hear what you want us to hear.
[1:12:26] It's in the mighty name of Jesus Christ
[1:12:28] we pray.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You can be seated.
[1:12:33] The hour has come
[1:12:37] now.
[1:12:40] Jesus in the book of Revelation
[1:12:43] uses that term twice. In Revelations 22
[1:12:48] or three times, he says it again in
[1:12:51] Revelations 22. These sayings are
[1:12:54] faithful and true. Verse 6 and 7. And
[1:12:58] the Lord God of the holy prophet sent
[1:13:00] his angel to show unto his servants the
[1:13:02] things which which must shortly be done.
[1:13:05] Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he
[1:13:08] that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy
[1:13:11] of this book. Then in verse 10, he says,
[1:13:14] "He said unto me, seal up, seal not the
[1:13:17] sayings of the prophecy of this book,
[1:13:19] for the time is at hand. Blessed is he
[1:13:24] that readeth, and they that hear the
[1:13:26] words of this prophecy, and keep those
[1:13:28] things which are written therein, for
[1:13:30] the time is at hand."
[1:13:34] You know, he uses this term, this
[1:13:37] terminology,
[1:13:39] and the hearer or the reader that hears
[1:13:42] it for the first time believe that it's
[1:13:46] going to happen right now.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; You know, the Lord allows that
[1:13:51] understanding to remain, too.
[1:13:55] And he does this with so much truth. So
[1:13:58] much of his word he allows to be
[1:14:01] revealed in his season.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness?
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; He has seasons. He has times that are
[1:14:09] appointed.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; You can't make God rush. You can't make
[1:14:14] God do anything.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; And when when he wants to show you,
[1:14:18] he'll show you. Amen.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; I took a little message here, I think on
[1:14:23] Wednesday and the other night there in
[1:14:25] Phoenix on the the baptism of John.
[1:14:29] Jesus asked those Pharisees. He said,
[1:14:31] "The baptism of John, was it from heaven
[1:14:35] or was it from men?" And they were
[1:14:37] afraid to answer because all the people
[1:14:41] knew that John was the prophet. The
[1:14:42] scripture says the publicans came to be
[1:14:46] baptized of him. The soldiers asked him,
[1:14:49] "What what what must we do?" The people,
[1:14:52] the Bible says, "All of Judea came out
[1:14:54] to hear John." And Jesus asked the
[1:14:56] question, "The baptism of John, was it
[1:14:59] of men or was it of heaven?"
[1:15:03] Obviously, we know it was of heaven,
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; right? And many people got baptized. But
[1:15:09] knowing God knowing that that baptism
[1:15:13] would be changed,
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Acts 19
[1:15:18] Paul runs into these believers that were
[1:15:20] caught under John's ministry and he
[1:15:23] begins to talk to them about the Holy
[1:15:25] Ghost and we don't even know that there
[1:15:27] even be a Holy Ghost. And Paul asked
[1:15:29] this question, how was you baptized?
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; If baptism doesn't make a difference,
[1:15:37] then you have to take that scripture
[1:15:38] out. It does make a difference how
[1:15:41] you're baptized. And here the Lord put
[1:15:44] all this emphasis and all of this great
[1:15:48] tremendous revelation in the ministry of
[1:15:51] John the Baptist. Isaiah spoke of him.
[1:15:53] Malachi spoke of him. He lands on the
[1:15:56] banks of Jordan looking like a wild man.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Bannam says he probably didn't
[1:16:02] take a bath for a week or weeks. He
[1:16:05] described him as his hair sticking
[1:16:07] straight up.
[1:16:09] He's dressed in some camel skin, eating
[1:16:12] locust and honey.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Why the Bible give us these details?
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Show you what kind of man this was. He
[1:16:19] shows up, jumps into the water,
[1:16:23] screaming to the people to repent,
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; calling on them to to lay down their
[1:16:30] traditions and their sins and repent and
[1:16:33] get baptized.
[1:16:35] Amen.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Lord put all this industry uh uh energy
[1:16:39] into this ministry knowing that it would
[1:16:42] change nor that it would turn.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; He does that. He allows for the seasons.
[1:16:49] He's the one who instituted the seasons.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; You can't plant and reap at the same
[1:16:54] time.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; There's a planting time. There's a
[1:16:57] growing time. There's a maturing time.
[1:17:00] Then there's a reaping time. What time
[1:17:03] are we in? Amen.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; That's the question.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Where are we at?
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; And all this history, all this time for
[1:17:12] nothing.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Or is something about to take place?
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; You know, I'm so glad. I'm so glad. I'm
[1:17:18] so glad that we know the day that we
[1:17:21] live in
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; and we know that the hour that we're
[1:17:23] living in. We're not looking for no
[1:17:25] great revival to sweep all the churches
[1:17:27] and everybody get together in a happy
[1:17:30] kumbaya
[1:17:31] and then this nation turns around and
[1:17:33] repents and gets back to the old
[1:17:35] fashioned. It's not going to happen.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; We are looking for the coming of the
[1:17:40] Lord.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; We are looking for a body change.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; We are looking for
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; the maturing
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; of the sons and daughters of God.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; That's the time we're in.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so this is the language that
[1:17:57] the Lord uses. Look at this. What the
[1:18:00] prophet of God says in the revelation of
[1:18:02] Jesus Christ 1960 paragraph 113.
[1:18:07] He says, "What time is at hand? The time
[1:18:11] these things take place when this
[1:18:13] revelation of Jesus Christ is completed
[1:18:16] in each church age." Now the reason he
[1:18:18] wrote it like this if he would have said
[1:18:22] well now they was looking for him to if
[1:18:25] he had if it had been revealed if he
[1:18:28] would have if it would have been
[1:18:30] revealed to John that he was going to
[1:18:32] come as soon as those churches they
[1:18:36] there was finished that's the way John
[1:18:39] thought it but it was
[1:18:43] but if it was them churches as soon as
[1:18:46] they is finished. They come. If he knew,
[1:18:50] if it had been revealed to him there is
[1:18:53] going to be seven long church ages,
[1:18:56] several thousand years, several hundred
[1:18:59] years, then there wouldn't be no reason
[1:19:01] of waiting. They just live their church
[1:19:04] age out. Therefore, God spoke it and it
[1:19:08] wasn't revealed to them. It wasn't
[1:19:10] revealed to Martin Luther. things that
[1:19:12] John Wesley knew about the scripture. It
[1:19:15] wasn't revealed to the Baptist what the
[1:19:17] Pentecostal knows about the scripture
[1:19:19] because it's in a different age. It's a
[1:19:21] different time and God reveals his
[1:19:24] things just in the season.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; So, he's got a season to reveal these
[1:19:31] things.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible you have today is
[1:19:35] not the same Bible you had 10 years ago.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you change. The word don't
[1:19:41] change,
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; but when you read it, it changes you. It
[1:19:44] has a different effect upon you.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; A teenager reading the scripture than a
[1:19:50] man that has children reading the
[1:19:52] scripture.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Same boy, same name, but he's matured
[1:19:56] now. And you pick up that word, it's
[1:19:58] going to have a different effect upon
[1:20:00] you.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; There's a season and time for it.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; And some things you won't understand
[1:20:07] until you have children. You got all the
[1:20:10] answers before you have any.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; You know all about it before you got a
[1:20:14] wife or a husband.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; But you don't. There's some things you
[1:20:18] just don't know. And we can't tell you.
[1:20:20] And there's no book that can show you.
[1:20:22] You got to get married.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; You got to have them babies and then
[1:20:28] come talk to me
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; about family matters.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation. things are revealed
[1:20:38] in their time. God has seasons.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; He has times that he unfolds things. And
[1:20:47] here he knew John was thinking. He knew
[1:20:51] the church was believing. The time is at
[1:20:54] hand. The time is at hand. The time I'm
[1:20:56] coming quickly. I'm coming. If he would
[1:20:58] have told them there's thousands of
[1:21:01] years, six more ages. There's a dark age
[1:21:05] and there's ages yet to come. Hundreds
[1:21:08] of years need to develop. If he would
[1:21:10] have told them that,
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; it probably would have discouraged them.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; They probably wouldn't make it on a
[1:21:17] Wednesday night prayer meeting.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Come on and help me preach.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; They probably wouldn't make all the
[1:21:22] services if they knew. But we know.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; That's why we make all the services.
[1:21:27] Isn't that right?
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:31] The time is at hand.
[1:21:35] These truths have to be revealed. You
[1:21:39] know, the Lord in the Old Testament,
[1:21:43] there was a order to getting to the holy
[1:21:46] place. There's the outer court, the
[1:21:49] inner court, and the holiest of holies.
[1:21:52] Remember
[1:21:54] in first kings chapter 17 we were
[1:21:57] talking about Elijah and how the threat
[1:22:01] of Jezebel came upon him and he had to
[1:22:04] run for his life and then he called for
[1:22:07] the famine. And we know the story that
[1:22:10] the Lord told him to go to this brook
[1:22:15] and I will feed thee there.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Not here over there. It was a It was a
[1:22:24] special place. It was a place where he
[1:22:27] was supposed to eat this food. And we
[1:22:30] know that the food in our day has been
[1:22:33] hidden from the world. But for the
[1:22:36] believer, it's spiritual food in due
[1:22:38] season.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; It's hidden mana.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Whether you believe it or not, this is
[1:22:42] why you are alive today. It's because of
[1:22:46] the food that you're eating.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; It's not because we're better. It's not
[1:22:51] because we know more than the rest just
[1:22:53] out of the earthly knowledge, but it's
[1:22:55] because of the revelation that God has
[1:22:58] given to us.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; He has revealed himself to us,
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; and that's why we do the way we do.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; We go in the way that we go. So he had
[1:23:11] Elijah travel this distance
[1:23:15] to um to get the food that he had
[1:23:19] prepared for him. Are you willing to
[1:23:22] travel?
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Are you willing to wait? Are you willing
[1:23:26] to go deep in prayer
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; to get into the spirit of revelation?
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Your Bible reads differently
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; when you accompany it with a prayer
[1:23:37] life.
[1:23:39] The church service, the worship meeting
[1:23:41] is different
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; when you accompany it with prayer.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Your experience today is different if
[1:23:49] you come with your heart prayed up.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; It's the same word. Yes. It's the same
[1:23:55] message. Yes. But when you get to the
[1:23:58] place where you're supposed to be and
[1:24:02] then you hear the same word,
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; it has an effect upon you. There's a
[1:24:08] place to eat the word.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; There's an atmosphere that we're
[1:24:12] supposed to eat the word.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Y'all ain't saying amen. But it's all
[1:24:16] right.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; There's a right place to eat this.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; How many of us eat our meals on the go?
[1:24:25] Like I said,
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; in your truck eating dinner,
[1:24:30] driving through traffic. You'll enjoy
[1:24:33] that meal if you pull over with the
[1:24:34] family somewhere.
[1:24:36] and eat it properly.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; And the way we eat the food of God,
[1:24:41] there's an atmosphere. There's a place.
[1:24:43] There's a special place that he
[1:24:45] designed. The outer court, the inner
[1:24:48] court, and then the holiest of holies.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; That's where I want to be this morning.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; That's where I want to partake this
[1:24:58] morning is in the holies of holies. So,
[1:25:00] there's an order to reaching that place.
[1:25:03] It's a distance that we travel.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; There's a season that God allows for
[1:25:09] things to be revealed and to be
[1:25:12] uncovered.
[1:25:15] As we know, the messenger tells us
[1:25:17] there's this Revelation chapter 1
[1:25:21] and and verse number three says,
[1:25:23] "Blessed is he that readeth and hear the
[1:25:26] word of this prophecy and keep those
[1:25:29] things for the time is at hand."
[1:25:32] This is the language of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:34] speaking to John. This kept the
[1:25:37] expectations up, kept it very high for
[1:25:41] him, knowing not knowing what the future
[1:25:45] would hold for him. Not knowing that
[1:25:47] there would be hours and ages and lives
[1:25:50] that would have to be sacrificed and
[1:25:52] given. This is John. John and the early
[1:25:56] apostles knew if they would have known
[1:25:59] that there was these long ages to come,
[1:26:01] they wouldn't have really that
[1:26:03] anticipation
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; to wait for.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; What if he told you everything
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; all in one sitting?
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Well, you wouldn't come back for more.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; He does that for us, too. He doesn't
[1:26:18] reveal everything to you at the time you
[1:26:20] want it.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, I need a wife right now.
[1:26:24] Lord, I need a husband right now. I know
[1:26:26] some of y'all ain't saying that, but
[1:26:28] somebody does say that.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; I need a husband. I need a wife. And you
[1:26:31] think this is the time that you need
[1:26:34] that, but don't you want God's timing?
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; He knows the right time.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; He knows the right season.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; So is the seed of the word of God
[1:26:48] planted in our heart.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; The word of God has been planted in our
[1:26:53] heart. We hear it for the first time
[1:26:56] sometimes and you got to hear it again
[1:26:58] though.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; And then that word has to mature
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; and it has to begin to grow
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; and it has to become believable to you.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; It gets to where you hear it and you
[1:27:10] hear it again and then you you can
[1:27:12] almost repeat it and then you memorize
[1:27:15] it.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; What is the word? It's taking effect
[1:27:18] upon you. Let it do its job. It's not a
[1:27:22] onetime hearing
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; or a one-time event. He is trying to
[1:27:29] fulfill his word in you.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; You know, these scriptures and the
[1:27:36] unfolding of the scriptures help us to
[1:27:39] realize that there's ages, seasons, and
[1:27:43] times for things to take place.
[1:27:47] God does it that way. He allows us to
[1:27:50] continue on sometimes maybe in a little
[1:27:53] ignorance and he doesn't show us all
[1:27:57] that we need to know just yet.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; But in his time he's going to reveal it
[1:28:02] to you. Is that right?
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Every seed, every predestinated seed has
[1:28:08] a season.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; And every season has its manifestation
[1:28:12] to be expressed. And it's God's great
[1:28:16] unfolding.
[1:28:18] He's unfolding it in your life, in my
[1:28:21] life. Ecclesiastics says it. The book of
[1:28:24] Ecclesiastes says it very well. There is
[1:28:27] a time and a season for everything under
[1:28:31] the sun.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; It's a time that we gather and it's a
[1:28:35] time that we scatter. It's a time that
[1:28:38] we live, a time to die, a time to build,
[1:28:41] a time to tear down. There's a time to
[1:28:45] to refrain from speaking.
[1:28:49] Stop talking so much. And there's a time
[1:28:52] to do some listening.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; There's a season for it. There is a time
[1:28:58] that you need to speak up.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; And make it known what side you're on.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; You've got to declare that.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; You got to say, "I'm on the Lord's
[1:29:09] side."
[1:29:10] You've got to declare I am healed by his
[1:29:13] stripes. You've got to declare that he
[1:29:15] is my savior.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; That he is the one who who brought me
[1:29:20] through. He is my redeemer.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; That's what the song service is all
[1:29:26] about. Yes, sir.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; It's not the melody. It's not rhyming.
[1:29:30] It's declaring
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; the word of the Lord.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Making that word become your word.
[1:29:38] The Lord is my shepherd.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; I shall not want.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; The Lord makes me to lie down in green
[1:29:48] pastures.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; You got to declare that
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; time to speak,
[1:29:54] a time to refrain from speaking.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:30:00] the entire church is built upon
[1:30:02] spiritual revelation.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; This is why Satan hates it so much.
[1:30:07] That's right.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; It's not built on education or
[1:30:11] knowledge, which that's part of it. It's
[1:30:14] not built on your ability to read, which
[1:30:16] that's part of it, too.
[1:30:19] It's not built on just the outward
[1:30:22] portion of coming to church
[1:30:25] or looking at others that are worshiping
[1:30:27] the Lord.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; It's built upon something much deeper
[1:30:31] than that.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I can tell you how to dress
[1:30:34] and you might ask the other brothers
[1:30:36] what we do and what we don't do. And
[1:30:38] that's all on the on your on your
[1:30:40] hearing. And that's part of it. That's
[1:30:42] part of the teaching. That's the outside
[1:30:44] part of it. We could talk to you those
[1:30:47] things. But when these things become a
[1:30:49] revelation to you, when you begin to see
[1:30:52] that it's Jesus Christ speaking to you,
[1:30:56] then it goes beyond the brother in the
[1:30:58] pull pit
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; or the strong leader or it goes beyond
[1:31:02] the Sunday school teacher
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; or the visiting pastor. When it's a
[1:31:07] revelation, a relationship between you
[1:31:10] and the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:31:13] becomes very intimate, very personal.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; And the Lord allows for these times
[1:31:24] of growth and growing. What we want to
[1:31:27] see, what we like to see is some growth
[1:31:29] in our revelation.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen, somebody.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; We're deeper than what we used to be.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; This is what the word does.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; This is expressed in 1 Samuel when David
[1:31:43] went through his test and trials.
[1:31:46] I have the quote here. I won't take time
[1:31:48] to get it, but he, Brother Brandham,
[1:31:50] brings an order to David's trials. And
[1:31:53] he said the first order was the bear
[1:31:57] and then the lion.
[1:32:00] You read the scripture there, David puts
[1:32:02] them both together. He says the lion and
[1:32:04] the bear. The prophet brings it out. He
[1:32:06] said, "I wish I had time to break those
[1:32:10] animals down for you." And he said, "The
[1:32:12] bear is was a big animal and David
[1:32:16] overcame that animal. It was a trial to
[1:32:19] him and he had a victory. It's a big
[1:32:22] victory. Big grizzly bear. And then when
[1:32:25] he come to the lion, the lion was much
[1:32:27] bigger than the bear. And he overcame
[1:32:31] that lion. First he started with the
[1:32:34] bear. Then he overcame the lion. And
[1:32:36] then a greater challenge, a greater
[1:32:39] victory.
[1:32:41] And then his greatest victory and his
[1:32:43] greatest challenge as a young boy, a
[1:32:47] non-commissioned soldier. No other army
[1:32:51] recognized him. Dad and brothers didn't
[1:32:54] know who he was.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; But the Lord
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; knew who he was. when he's writing those
[1:33:01] psalms, the Lord is my shepherd. Those
[1:33:03] aren't just words, my brother. That's
[1:33:06] inspiration.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; The book of Acts calls David a prophet.
[1:33:10] He got in the spirit of prophecy out
[1:33:13] there in the wilderness looking after a
[1:33:17] few dozen sheep. The Lord looking at
[1:33:19] him, watching him.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; He's riding under inspiration. And here
[1:33:24] he was, the bear, the lion, and then
[1:33:28] Goliath. His biggest challenge yet.
[1:33:31] Amen.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; And so he allows this
[1:33:35] revelation to grow for us. So, but
[1:33:37] there's a danger. When we don't move
[1:33:41] forward in the revelation, then the
[1:33:45] light that we have received turns into
[1:33:47] darkness.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; It goes the opposite way. So what
[1:33:52] happens to a truth when you reject it or
[1:33:54] you ignore it? What happens to the truth
[1:33:57] that spoken to all the multitudes of
[1:33:59] people? When they turned away from Jesus
[1:34:02] in St. John chapter 6, remember those
[1:34:05] words he was speaking? They said, "This
[1:34:06] is a hard saying," and they walked away.
[1:34:09] Do you think they just went and lived an
[1:34:10] ordinary life? the rich young ruler.
[1:34:14] What do you think happened to him after
[1:34:17] he came in contact with the Lord Jesus
[1:34:20] and the opportunity for him to come and
[1:34:22] follow him? Sell all you have and follow
[1:34:25] me and he rejected that. What church is
[1:34:28] he going to go to after that? What
[1:34:30] priest? What kind of worship service is
[1:34:33] he going to try to be a part of?
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; So what happens to truth to a believer?
[1:34:38] When you receive truth, he gives you
[1:34:40] more truth.
[1:34:42] It doesn't stay the same. It grows.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Your revelation grows.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; And what happens to truth when it's
[1:34:50] rejected? It turns to darkness. And my
[1:34:54] friend, sad to say, I'm seeing that
[1:34:56] happen even today.
[1:34:58] Even in many of the assemblies that
[1:35:01] we've been friends with and been
[1:35:03] familiar with, ministries, pastors,
[1:35:06] 40-year, 50-year ministries are turning
[1:35:09] away from the light of this age.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; And they've boldly declared that they
[1:35:15] are now free now. The sisters, they'll
[1:35:18] leave and they're free. They've walked
[1:35:21] away from the truth. And what little
[1:35:23] bitty truth that they had now turns to
[1:35:27] darkness. You know what I'm seeing more
[1:35:30] now? They just don't walk away quietly.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; They walk away and they come back
[1:35:34] fighting against it now.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; The thing that they once upheld the
[1:35:40] thing that once delivered them,
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; they studied for years and used it in
[1:35:46] their camp meetings to help others.
[1:35:48] prayer lines, laid hands on the sick,
[1:35:51] baptized people in the name of the Lord
[1:35:53] Jesus to help bring them along. And now
[1:35:56] they've turned from the holy
[1:35:58] commandment, and now the truth that they
[1:36:00] once had is now turned to darkness.
[1:36:03] Jesus talks about this in Mark chapter
[1:36:05] 4.
[1:36:06] We'll turn there quickly.
[1:36:10] This is the part of the service where
[1:36:13] you will probably stop saying amen.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; But it will be the word though.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit, let it say amen
[1:36:25] through you. Okay?
[1:36:27] You know I'm teasing. I know all the
[1:36:29] believers, we all believers in here,
[1:36:31] right?
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Mark chapter 4 verse 22. It's a parable
[1:36:36] of our Lord Jesus. He's giving us here.
[1:36:42] And
[1:36:43] let me turn there. Mark chapter 4 verse
[1:36:48] 21. Look at what he says. And he said
[1:36:51] unto them, "Is a candle brought to be
[1:36:53] put under a bushel or under a bed and
[1:36:57] not to be set on a candlestick? For
[1:37:00] there is nothing hid which shall not be
[1:37:04] manifested." Amen.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Neither was anything kept secret, but
[1:37:09] that it should come abroad.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; If any man have ears to hear, let him
[1:37:19] hear.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Isn't that nice?
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Ears to hear,
[1:37:26] let him hear. Now let's take what the
[1:37:28] prophet says here
[1:37:30] a couple of places here in um
[1:37:36] the unveiling of God. He makes this
[1:37:39] statement here
[1:37:41] paragraph 22. my subject this morning. I
[1:37:44] trust that God will reveal this and each
[1:37:46] time if you who take the tapes and
[1:37:49] listen and I hope and trust that you
[1:37:51] have had a spiritual understanding
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; of what that God has been trying to get
[1:38:00] over to the church without saying it
[1:38:04] right out.
[1:38:07] See, it's a thing. Sometimes we have to
[1:38:09] say things in such a way that it might
[1:38:12] thin down.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; It might bring some to go out, some to
[1:38:16] leave, some to ponder over. But that's
[1:38:18] done. Say it with me.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Purposely.
[1:38:23] It must be done that way. Say, "Lord,
[1:38:27] just tell me. Lord, just tell me
[1:38:28] plainly. Just tell me plainly." No, he
[1:38:31] doesn't do it that way. That's
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; He reserved things. He saith things in a
[1:38:37] certain way.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; See, you're not gonna get in here
[1:38:39] without a prayer life.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; You're not gonna get a revelation
[1:38:43] without a struggle.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; There's some things that you hear for
[1:38:46] the first time and I tell you what, you
[1:38:48] can't say amen
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; cuz it's too hard.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; It's a ch something I never heard
[1:38:53] before. Like, whoa, whoa, whoa. I
[1:38:56] remember when I came to the message.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; His brother gave me a bag of tapes. I
[1:39:00] was working in a hospital there in
[1:39:02] Sacramento, California. Brother Fred
[1:39:04] Faso gave me a bag of tapes and I was
[1:39:07] listening to those tapes and I was just
[1:39:10] eating it up one after. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:13] Amen. Brother Glenn, I was just it was
[1:39:16] all good. And I was sitting in my car
[1:39:19] had a little cutless and I was had a
[1:39:21] tape player in there and brother
[1:39:24] Brandham started getting on women
[1:39:26] preachers and my mama's a preacher
[1:39:30] and I was saying, "Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:33] Amen. And when he said that, oh, I had
[1:39:35] to stop that.
[1:39:38] I stopped the tape and I started
[1:39:40] thinking like, Israel, what are you
[1:39:41] getting into? You're just swallowing
[1:39:44] this thing all the way up like this. You
[1:39:46] don't even know. You don't even know
[1:39:48] what these people fully believe. And so
[1:39:51] I I took the I took the tape out. I got
[1:39:53] out of my car. I I went into my little
[1:39:56] apartment. I put it t the tape back in
[1:39:59] the tape recorder. I rewinded it and I
[1:40:02] played it and guess what it said?
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; The exact same thing.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; But this time when it said it, I had
[1:40:10] pondered it a little bit. The grace of
[1:40:13] God was in my room
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; and I said, "Yes,
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; that's the truth."
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; And then the next time I said, "Yes,
[1:40:22] even louder."
[1:40:24] And then now I can preach it
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; as a conviction
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; from down in my soul.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; So you can't say amen the first time all
[1:40:34] the time. It's the first time you're
[1:40:35] hearing it.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; But if you stay with it,
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; give the light a chance to drop
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit by his love and
[1:40:44] tender love and mercy
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; will accompany you as you read the word.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. as you hear the message and he
[1:40:53] allows it to be done that way. There's a
[1:40:55] struggle some of the things we hear.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; There's some things I still have on the
[1:41:00] shelf to be honest with you. You want to
[1:41:03] know what they are? No.
[1:41:07] You put stuff on your shelf, I got stuff
[1:41:09] on mine.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; But I know that all of this message is
[1:41:12] true.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; But I'm still wrestling through some
[1:41:16] things. I'm still challenged by some
[1:41:19] things. And that's where prayer and a
[1:41:23] relationship
[1:41:24] with the author of the book comes in.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; In his love and tender mercy and in his
[1:41:32] time, in his season, he will reveal it.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; That's the God that we serve.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; He instituted seasons. He's the one who
[1:41:45] instituted seasons. Is that right? Now,
[1:41:47] he can he can speed them up. He can slow
[1:41:50] them down like with the fig tree. He's
[1:41:54] sped up. Remember that?
[1:41:57] And the and the the the olive branch in
[1:42:00] the holiest of holy. They took that
[1:42:03] branch of Moses and Aaron's rod and put
[1:42:06] it in the holiest of holies. And in 24
[1:42:08] hours, it blossomed and brought forth
[1:42:10] almonds. He sped up the process, but
[1:42:13] there's still a process. And he's the
[1:42:16] one that's in control of the season. He
[1:42:18] instituted seasons.
[1:42:21] Every service can't be a happy happy
[1:42:23] happy service.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Now, it's joyful all the way through,
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; but some services tears have to come out
[1:42:33] of your eyes.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Some services you got to be on your
[1:42:37] knees.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Some tapes will press you. Some will
[1:42:42] lift you. But it's all of God's word.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; And he's got a time and season.
[1:42:49] Families go through these times.
[1:42:52] Goes through these seasons. Is that
[1:42:54] right?
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Then it might be that some would say,
[1:42:58] "You mean God would purposely do a thing
[1:43:00] like that?" He certainly did. He does.
[1:43:04] Yet. He said,
[1:43:07] "Except you eat of the flesh of the son
[1:43:10] of God or the son of man and drink his
[1:43:13] blood, you have no life in you." What
[1:43:18] kind of statement do you think that a
[1:43:21] medical doctor or nurse or any fine
[1:43:24] intellectual person would think of a
[1:43:27] statement like that?
[1:43:30] You know how we do, don't we? We like to
[1:43:33] sanitize the gospel a little bit.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Like, you know, Lord, you know, say it,
[1:43:38] but don't say it like that, Lord. Don't
[1:43:40] say it with my I've got some friends
[1:43:41] coming to church. Don't No, no, no, no,
[1:43:44] no, no, no. Jesus said it, knew they
[1:43:47] were struggling with it, and he said it
[1:43:49] anyway
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; on purpose.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; There's places like that in the word for
[1:43:54] all of us.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Every the newcomer has to deal with it.
[1:43:58] I have to deal with it. You know, the
[1:44:00] newcomer comes to church, it's always
[1:44:02] those crazy saints that want to get a
[1:44:04] hold of them and bring them the
[1:44:06] craziness first and all the the, you
[1:44:08] know, the real crazy stuff. And you just
[1:44:11] you just want say, "No, don't let sister
[1:44:12] get a hold of her. Keep her away from
[1:44:15] brother cuz they crazy."
[1:44:18] But God allows that.
[1:44:21] God allows
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; someone to pin you up in the corner
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; and start dropping things on you.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; And then you got to go develop a prayer
[1:44:32] life.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; You got to fall down on your knees.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, what does this mean? What is
[1:44:40] going on in my life? Please reveal it to
[1:44:44] me."
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; He's got a season for it. Amen. Amen.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; I believe he's interested in us knowing
[1:44:52] exactly what we need to know when we
[1:44:57] need to know it.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness, somebody?
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Or
[1:45:04] is God
[1:45:07] running late?
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Is God not on time?
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what's going on. Yes,
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; he's got it all under control.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; I think the brother said that this
[1:45:21] morning.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Give me that reassurance.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Placed it down in my soul.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; That God's got it all under control.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; So, he allows for that to take place
[1:45:36] that way.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Here what the prophet of God says about
[1:45:40] this light turning into darkness and the
[1:45:44] power of God. 1955 he says this here the
[1:45:47] same Holy Ghost
[1:45:51] in power
[1:45:53] that resurrected Jesus Christ that's in
[1:45:56] the building tonight blinds the eyes of
[1:45:59] the modern day preacher and his church
[1:46:01] and that's the things thing that's
[1:46:04] blinded them has give light hallelujah
[1:46:09] since the resurrection of Jesus in the
[1:46:11] day of Pentecost God will do it can you
[1:46:14] expl explain it. But if you don't accept
[1:46:17] light, it'll become darkness to you.
[1:46:20] You'll criticize it, call it a holy
[1:46:23] roller, or you might as well have a
[1:46:26] millstone hanged at your neck and
[1:46:28] drowned to the depths of the sea. You
[1:46:30] blasphe the Holy Ghost, there's not
[1:46:33] forgiveness.
[1:46:36] Prophet God continues in questions and
[1:46:38] answers, 1954,
[1:46:40] and he says this here. It's talking
[1:46:42] about water water baptism.
[1:46:45] Paragraph 258. So now you say, "Brother
[1:46:47] Vandom, I was baptized in the name of
[1:46:48] the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. I got
[1:46:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I don't
[1:46:53] doubt your word. I have no reason at all
[1:46:55] to doubt your word. I believe it. I
[1:46:58] believe God gave them the Holy Ghost up
[1:47:00] there before they was baptized at all.
[1:47:03] But when Peter told them what to do,
[1:47:06] they went and done it." That's right.
[1:47:08] Now you know what to do. That's right.
[1:47:11] And if you refuse to walk in light when
[1:47:14] light is brought forth, you turn to
[1:47:18] darkness.
[1:47:19] Right. Amen. All right. Excuse me. I
[1:47:22] don't want to excuse me for hollering.
[1:47:24] So be it. To God's word. No, sir. I'll
[1:47:26] holler. Amen. Again. That's right. Yes,
[1:47:30] sir. Why baptize in the name of Jesus
[1:47:32] Christ, Brother Brandham? Why do you do
[1:47:34] that instead of the Father, Son, and
[1:47:35] Holy Ghost? Because the Bible teaches
[1:47:37] that that clear. Why do you wash feet,
[1:47:40] brother Bannon? Because the Bible
[1:47:42] teaches that. I believe in the full
[1:47:44] gospel.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; A
[1:47:47] amen.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; We see that happen with Cain, don't we?
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; He had an hour and time in his life
[1:47:54] where he actually had a relationship
[1:47:55] with the Lord.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; He was given the opportunity to worship,
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; to build his altar, to do all what he
[1:48:03] felt in his heart by his understanding
[1:48:06] how to approach God. And he did that
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; and the Lord shook his head at it and
[1:48:10] says, "No, that's not the way I'm going
[1:48:12] to receive. Do what your brother did."
[1:48:14] You know, and Cain, if he would have
[1:48:16] just humbled himself
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; and corrected his error, he would have
[1:48:21] been moving on with the Lord.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; And that's like a a lot of us today.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; If we'll just humble ourselves and go on
[1:48:29] with the word that God has given us,
[1:48:32] he'll continue to bless you. But if you
[1:48:35] ex uh uh uh make excuses for truth or
[1:48:38] deny it or try to explain it away, then
[1:48:42] what can the Lord do more for you? He's
[1:48:46] tried to open up that channel to give
[1:48:50] you more. You're at the outer court.
[1:48:53] He's trying to bring you to the holy
[1:48:55] place. You're at the inner court. He's
[1:48:58] trying to bring you to the holiest of
[1:49:00] holies. He's trying to bring you through
[1:49:02] those stages, through those phases so
[1:49:05] that he can give you more light.
[1:49:09] And the light that he's been given to us
[1:49:12] in this day, in this generation, it's a
[1:49:16] beautiful light.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful light.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; And though many may turn away from it,
[1:49:23] we are growing deeper in it.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; They thought we was crazy five years
[1:49:28] ago.
[1:49:30] They going to really know how crazy we
[1:49:32] are today.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; And in 10 more years, if I continue in
[1:49:36] this level of craziness,
[1:49:38] oh God, help me. I want to lose my mind
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; for the things of the word
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; and deny the things of the world
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; and right on in to the coming of the
[1:49:51] Lord in the rapture.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Crazy till my body is changed. crazy
[1:49:57] until I'm raptured up out of here.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; This is the trajectory that the believer
[1:50:02] is on.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; We're not holding back. We're going
[1:50:05] deeper.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; We're not refraining from it. We're
[1:50:08] going deeper into it.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; They have removed the candlestick.
[1:50:14] They've removed the light out of the
[1:50:15] assemblies.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; They don't want to mention where they
[1:50:19] got the truth from. They want to mention
[1:50:21] that Jesus did it. and they don't want
[1:50:23] to say the name of the prophet that God
[1:50:27] used in this generation.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to tell you right now, I'm
[1:50:30] not ashamed of it.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; This message saved my life.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; This message, the revelation of Jesus
[1:50:39] Christ
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; is the reason I'm alive today.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; And I know that and I recognize that to
[1:50:46] be the truth. He that has an ear, let
[1:50:49] him hear. Now the prophet continues and
[1:50:52] says this here that God he allowed it to
[1:50:58] be done that way. He makes statements
[1:51:00] and he allows those statements to be
[1:51:03] made
[1:51:04] um uh purposely.
[1:51:07] Now he continues in the inve 295 it says
[1:51:11] this. think
[1:51:14] the mysteries of God made known to us in
[1:51:16] this day by the same heavenly messenger
[1:51:21] that was made known to them in them
[1:51:24] days. Notice the same pillar of fire
[1:51:27] that sent Moses. The same pillar of fire
[1:51:30] that was on Moses that wrote the Bible.
[1:51:33] The same pillar of fire that Paul met on
[1:51:35] his road down to Damascus and Paul wrote
[1:51:38] the New Testament. Remember Matthew,
[1:51:40] Mark, Luke, and John? They only wrote
[1:51:42] what they seen. But Paul had the
[1:51:45] revelation.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; He pulled it out. He had he had met the
[1:51:48] pillar of fire himself. Think uh the
[1:51:52] same paragraph 299. And think of it, the
[1:51:56] same pillar of fire that come upon those
[1:52:00] men that wrote the Bible. It's the same
[1:52:04] pillar of fire here today
[1:52:07] interpreting the Bible. Amen. how we
[1:52:11] thank him for that.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; It's not a different pillar of fire.
[1:52:15] It's the same pillar of fire.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Same pillar of fire that wrote the Bible
[1:52:21] told Moses to take off his shoes. The
[1:52:24] same pillar of fire we have a picture of
[1:52:26] today.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Washington DC. It's there too in
[1:52:34] their hall there. You go there, you get
[1:52:37] a little tag and they'll show you right
[1:52:38] where that picture is. You go and see
[1:52:41] that this is authenticated.
[1:52:45] Now
[1:52:47] the world in its education has made it
[1:52:50] null and void.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; The world in its education has be to
[1:52:54] disprove the messenger. What do they do
[1:52:57] it by? Intellectuals.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; They do it by proof or evidence. They do
[1:53:03] it by
[1:53:05] fake news.
[1:53:07] They do it by going on the internet or
[1:53:10] going historically and finding and
[1:53:12] finding and finding finding. Well, let
[1:53:15] me tell you something, saints. The um
[1:53:19] the um the historical records of any
[1:53:23] account didn't save me.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; It was a supernatural something that
[1:53:29] took place
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; that saved me. Amen.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; In other words, when the Lord got a hold
[1:53:34] of my heart and my soul, I didn't have
[1:53:37] to go pick up and and research to make
[1:53:40] sure that it was vindicated,
[1:53:41] authenticated.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; No, God got a hold of me
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; and he revealed to me.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; So, revelation is more than just an
[1:53:53] education.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Revelation is more than just
[1:53:56] information.
[1:53:58] Revelation is um the the Greek word
[1:54:02] apocalypse. It means to be uncovered or
[1:54:07] to be revealed.
[1:54:09] Something has been revealed or
[1:54:12] uncovered.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; It is it is the um
[1:54:18] to make known through divine inspiration
[1:54:22] to make something secret or hidden
[1:54:25] publicly.
[1:54:28] It's a mystery. It's a the mystery of a
[1:54:32] religious truth that one can know by
[1:54:35] revelation and cannot fully understand.
[1:54:40] It's like I know who my mother is and my
[1:54:42] daddy is.
[1:54:44] I can't I don't have to write an essay
[1:54:46] on it. I don't need to prove it to
[1:54:48] nobody else.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; I know who my mom and dad is. It's a
[1:54:53] it's it goes beyond just education or
[1:54:55] arguing or take taking some place online
[1:54:59] to to show who is right or wrong. We're
[1:55:02] not trying to prove who's right or wrong
[1:55:04] in an argument. It's the revelation of
[1:55:06] Jesus Christ that a young person, an old
[1:55:10] person, a person that could read, a
[1:55:12] person that cannot read, God gives it to
[1:55:15] them by his grace and his mercy.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; You didn't work for you. didn't pay for
[1:55:22] it. You didn't jump loud enough. You
[1:55:24] didn't jump high enough. You can't run
[1:55:25] fast enough. There's no money that can
[1:55:28] buy it. There is nothing you can do
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; to let his but his grace comes to you.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; And when his grace comes to you, he
[1:55:38] reveals
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; himself to you.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; So
[1:55:45] this is what has taken place. Now what
[1:55:48] God does is this.
[1:55:52] He declares, "He that has an ear, let
[1:55:56] him hear."
[1:55:59] In Mark 4:22, verse 24 says, "Take heed
[1:56:03] what ye hear."
[1:56:05] Now, let's go back there just for a
[1:56:08] moment. Mark 4:22
[1:56:12] 24.
[1:56:14] Then he said unto them, "Take heed what
[1:56:16] you hear.
[1:56:18] With what measure ye meet, it shall be
[1:56:21] measured to you,
[1:56:24] and unto you that here shall what?"
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Come on. That here shall
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; more
[1:56:34] be given.
[1:56:36] For he that hath to him shall be given.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he that hath not from him
[1:56:44] shall be what?
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; This is what we see taking place today.
[1:56:49] This is what's taking place.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; I'm seeing this. I never placed it
[1:56:54] before in the scripture, but here just
[1:56:56] recently I begin to see this looking up
[1:56:59] the removing of a candlestick. And when
[1:57:02] the messenger, faithful messenger is
[1:57:04] taken off the scene, there's a lot of
[1:57:06] things come up. People personal
[1:57:07] testimonies proving this, proving that.
[1:57:10] when he was here, no man stood before
[1:57:12] him.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; But you know, but when you remove a
[1:57:15] candlestick, you remove a faithful
[1:57:17] leader, you remove an elder from a home,
[1:57:20] you remove the truth teller, you remove
[1:57:22] the standardbearer, you remove that
[1:57:24] original business owner,
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; and then it starts everybody start doing
[1:57:30] their own thing. Like the book of
[1:57:31] Judges, all of Israel served the Lord
[1:57:35] and all the elders that were with Joshua
[1:57:39] served the Lord until Joshua left.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; And when the elders left, what the
[1:57:43] people do? This pattern, we see it
[1:57:46] happen over and over again. It happens
[1:57:50] in groups. It happens in small groups.
[1:57:52] It happens in individuals.
[1:57:54] You as an individual, if you take the
[1:57:58] light of this ministry out of your
[1:58:01] personal devotion time, you will see a
[1:58:06] effect of it on you spiritually because
[1:58:08] God sent to you a voice to keep you fed
[1:58:14] up during this great time of darkness
[1:58:16] and the great time of a famine. We are
[1:58:18] in a famine. Not only a famine, we're in
[1:58:21] a time of gross darkness.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; It is darkness upon the people.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; And if you come up under that anointing
[1:58:30] of darkness, you'll get under it and
[1:58:32] you'll start questioning and you'll
[1:58:34] start, you know, reasoning and you'll
[1:58:36] start disbelieving. But when you stay in
[1:58:39] the food, you stay in the place
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; where God told you to stay,
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; he'll provide food for you.
[1:58:49] This is what's taking place.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; The time is at hand.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. When you receive truth,
[1:58:58] you get more truth. So, everybody comes
[1:59:00] with something.
[1:59:03] Every human being comes here with
[1:59:05] something.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; They start off with their conscience. Is
[1:59:09] that right?
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; They have they know the difference
[1:59:12] between right and wrong. Is that right?
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; They do. Yes. Jesus says it right here.
[1:59:19] He says, "And for he that hath to him
[1:59:22] shall be given, and he that hath not
[1:59:25] from him shall be taken even that which
[1:59:29] he hath." So,
[1:59:31] let's turn into Romans here quickly.
[1:59:35] And let me see if I can
[1:59:39] just deal with this just really quick
[1:59:41] because this is a growing
[1:59:45] uh
[1:59:46] revelation of people that call
[1:59:48] themselves atheists
[1:59:51] or agnostics.
[1:59:53] That's what they say.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; But we know the Bible tells us
[1:59:56] differently. Right.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; They really do believe because their
[2:00:01] conscience bears witness of it.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; All right. Let me see if I can get it
[2:00:08] here for you. How many has it there?
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter one.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Two people have it.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Three people, four or five.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Can everybody say amen?
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Okay, most of you said amen.
[2:00:28] We can be a little rough here in Tucson.
[2:00:32] Need the Holy Spirit. We need some more
[2:00:34] rain.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my God bless you.
[2:00:39] Romans chapter 1. I want to take this
[2:00:42] scripture for you here. And I'm going to
[2:00:48] close right with this one. All right.
[2:00:53] And it says
[2:00:58] verse 16, "For I am not ashamed of the
[2:01:01] gospel of Jesus Christ, for is the power
[2:01:04] of God unto salvation to everyone that
[2:01:07] believeth, to the Jew first, and also to
[2:01:09] the Greek. For therein is the
[2:01:12] righteousness of God."
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[2:01:16] revealed from faith to faith as it is
[2:01:20] written, the just shall live by faith.
[2:01:24] For it is written,
[2:01:27] for the wrath of God is revealed from
[2:01:29] heaven against all ungodliness
[2:01:33] and unrighteousness of men who do what?
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Hold the truth.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Who hold the truth. That word hold
[2:01:41] there, it's um I forget the Greek word.
[2:01:45] I could find it for you quickly, but it
[2:01:46] means to suppress.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; So they suppress the truth. And look
[2:01:52] what the scripture says. Hold the truth
[2:01:54] in unrighteousness.
[2:01:56] Because that which may be known of God
[2:01:59] is manifest in them.
[2:02:03] For God hath what?
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; He showed it unto them. For the
[2:02:08] invisible things of him from the
[2:02:10] creation
[2:02:12] of the world are clearly seen.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Being understood
[2:02:19] by the things that are made even as
[2:02:22] eternal power in Godhead. So that they
[2:02:26] are what are they?
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Without excuse.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; They're without excuse.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; They're without excuse. God has revealed
[2:02:32] it to them. He's made it known to them,
[2:02:36] but they suppress the truth and they try
[2:02:39] to act like they don't believe the
[2:02:41] truth. Remember when Jesus made his
[2:02:43] triumphal entry and those saints and
[2:02:46] begin to praise him and call son of
[2:02:49] David or blessed is he the most high
[2:02:52] God. They told him, why don't you make
[2:02:54] these people be quiet? What did Jesus
[2:02:55] said? If they hold their peace,
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; what'd he say?
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me please. Yes.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; If they hold their peace,
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; you don't have to say amen.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; The rocks will say amen.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; The rocks will cry out.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; If all the churches in this city stop
[2:03:20] preaching this word,
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Sabino Canyon is still preaching it.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Sunset Mountain is still
[2:03:26] preaching it.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; You go up in the trails up in there,
[2:03:29] some of them trees are still alive.
[2:03:31] They'll they'll cry out
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; that a mighty prophet came in this day.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; The rocks would immediately
[2:03:44] cry out
[2:03:46] and these people, they suppress
[2:03:50] the truth.
[2:03:52] They walk away. They turn away. You got
[2:03:55] to step over Calvary to find yourself in
[2:03:59] hell. Yes,
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; you have to step over the love of God to
[2:04:03] turn around and say that God doesn't
[2:04:04] care or love me.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; You have to step over his goodness, his
[2:04:08] mercy.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; The sunrise,
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; preaches that there is a God. The
[2:04:14] mountains are crying out that there is a
[2:04:17] God. The rainbow, all of nature, the
[2:04:21] solar system,
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; the way your body works is crying out
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; that there is a God.
[2:04:31] Hallelujah.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; The preacher don't even have to preach.
[2:04:37] You don't even have to go to church. But
[2:04:39] just take a a walk in nature. Remember
[2:04:42] the gentleman that planted that apple
[2:04:44] tree 40 years ago. Remember, he was an
[2:04:46] atheist.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; He didn't know that that apple tree was
[2:04:49] going to preach to him.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; He didn't know he was going to get
[2:04:52] saved, not even at a church. Amen.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; He didn't know that a prophet was going
[2:04:57] to bring a ministry and actually preach
[2:05:00] the gospel to him because his time had
[2:05:04] come.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; 75 years old. 40year-old apple tree
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; laying there thinking about I'm an
[2:05:12] atheist but God in his grace and his
[2:05:16] mercy
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; sent a man with squirrel blood all over
[2:05:21] him
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; driving through the neighborhood
[2:05:24] wondering go shoot somebody's squirrel
[2:05:27] on somebody's property
[2:05:31] and brother Woods brings him to this
[2:05:33] atheist quote unquote and got to talking
[2:05:36] to him a preacher
[2:05:38] You're so low down banks, you got to
[2:05:40] carry a preacher with you.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother M said, "I better get out
[2:05:44] now. Come out, start talking to him."
[2:05:48] Says, "You you guys are are barking up
[2:05:51] the wrong tree.
[2:05:53] All you guys do is go after the people's
[2:05:55] money." And brother B says, "You know,
[2:05:58] well, you have your opinion. You have
[2:06:00] your opinion."
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; He says, "Can I have one of these
[2:06:03] apples?" Says, "Sure." He says, "What do
[2:06:04] you change the subject for?" He said, "I
[2:06:06] just want you know these this apple, you
[2:06:08] know, you know who these apples that are
[2:06:11] falling, the life that's in the tree."
[2:06:15] Explain that to me how that work. Oh,
[2:06:17] that's just nature. Yes, that's nature.
[2:06:18] I agree. That's nature. It's just
[2:06:20] nature. Yes, I agree. That's nature. But
[2:06:22] who controls nature?
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; And the old man begin to think, start to
[2:06:26] think. Revelation is near him.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; It's near.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; He ain't getting it yet, but he's near.
[2:06:32] Amen.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; And he starts to talk to him in love and
[2:06:36] mercy and explain to him. He says,
[2:06:39] "Before
[2:06:42] I come back, I want you to think about
[2:06:45] what intelligence is controlling
[2:06:48] nature." Then I will tell you
[2:06:51] how I knew who that woman was
[2:06:55] that received her healing from cancer.
[2:06:57] Your neighbor right around the corner
[2:06:58] here.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Knew you. Yes. Knew me. Brother B says,
[2:07:02] "And right there, I led that man to
[2:07:05] Christ
[2:07:07] with an apple tree."
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Not chapter and voice, not quote.
[2:07:12] Another quote here, look at this. No, an
[2:07:15] apple tree.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Because all of nature will testify.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; The rocks will cry out.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; The rocks are still crying out.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:28] You know, the prophet of God lays that
[2:07:30] in there so beautifully. How much time I
[2:07:32] got? I got eight more minutes.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. So,
[2:07:37] Brother Bam is dealing with uh another
[2:07:43] atheist man.
[2:07:47] And he was dealing with this man or or
[2:07:51] his former pastor, Dr. Rory Davis was
[2:07:55] dealing with this atheist about the
[2:07:57] scripture. They shall drink any deadly
[2:08:01] thing. It won't harm them.
[2:08:05] And
[2:08:07] if I can find this here quickly, sis, I
[2:08:10] want to
[2:08:15] Oh my
[2:08:20] Who said that? Oh, that's brother
[2:08:22] interpreting. Paragraph number 34 in the
[2:08:25] message, God in his word,
[2:08:31] 1957.
[2:08:33] Here what the prophet of God says here.
[2:08:37] If we can play a part of it, that would
[2:08:39] be nice. Can we load it real quick, sis?
[2:08:43] I don't know how clear this is. It just
[2:08:45] really touched me. Let's see.
[2:08:50] Yeah. Paragraph 34. I'll tell you when
[2:08:52] to stop. 1957, God is in his word.
[2:09:01] Thank you. Just one more little thought
[2:09:04] on my mind comes this an infidel not
[2:09:07] several years 60 75 years ago passed to
[2:09:10] the nation and he was making converts to
[2:09:12] infidelism
[2:09:14] and he was so smart the preachers was
[2:09:16] afraid to attack him. But one day while
[2:09:19] he'd been taking a Europe trip, he broke
[2:09:21] down and come back. He went up into the
[2:09:23] mountains to take a rest. And one day
[2:09:26] while walking out, he looked at the
[2:09:28] rocks
[2:09:30] and he said, "Oh rocks,
[2:09:33] are you there according to the book of
[2:09:36] science? Are you there according to the
[2:09:39] word of God?"
[2:09:42] And he got so under conviction that he
[2:09:45] knelt down there in the path and gave
[2:09:48] his life to God. The Bible said if they
[2:09:52] hold their peace, the rocks will
[2:09:54] immediately cry out. Something's going
[2:09:56] to teach people about God.
[2:10:00] I've watched birds and animals and can
[2:10:03] see God in his universe. We could hold
[2:10:06] that for two hours. God in his
[2:10:30] the poison. He said he couldn't take it
[2:10:32] anymore. He wouldn't let this infidel
[2:10:34] stand against God's word.
[2:10:38] And so
[2:10:40] he shook him. He took the poison. He
[2:10:43] drank every drop of it. And it was a
[2:10:46] great miracle, a great time in this
[2:10:49] man's life. And so this infidel, as you
[2:10:52] heard the quote there, he goes out into
[2:10:53] the wilderness now. And then the rocks
[2:10:56] begin to testify to him. And the rocks
[2:11:00] begin to cry out to him. You know, God
[2:11:03] has an appointed time
[2:11:06] for your struggle,
[2:11:09] for your temptation.
[2:11:12] He's got an appointed time. There is an
[2:11:15] expiration date
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; to even this very day that we're living
[2:11:20] in.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; October will soon be over
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; and then we'll go into November.
[2:11:26] And whatever you're going through right
[2:11:28] now, whatever trouble, whatever
[2:11:31] blessing, it's got a time that it has to
[2:11:36] shift, change, get deeper, grows
[2:11:39] greater, or it comes to an end.
[2:11:44] So we don't be weary in what we are
[2:11:47] doing today.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; And we don't hold in discouragement
[2:11:52] because things are going so bad for us.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; We have our hard times. Yes. We have
[2:11:59] these hard trials. Yes. But they come to
[2:12:03] an end. And that is a revelation. The
[2:12:05] believer knows that. So we hold steady,
[2:12:10] the hour will come where God will give
[2:12:13] you the victory
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; over all of your enemies.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; If you take Psalms 27, I was reading
[2:12:21] that this morning and it's like I said,
[2:12:23] it's one of my favorite. We read it here
[2:12:25] many times. I memorized it as a young
[2:12:28] Christian. Lord is my light, my
[2:12:30] salvation. Whom shall I fear? Lord is
[2:12:33] the strength of my life. Whom shall I be
[2:12:35] afraid when the wicked? And I started
[2:12:37] quoting that this morning and I started
[2:12:39] to include
[2:12:41] my entire family.
[2:12:45] And if you'll just plurize that
[2:12:47] scripture, it is profound.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; When the wicked come against me or my
[2:12:55] family or my ministry,
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; then the Lord will take me up.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Go through there and plurize that. It'll
[2:13:04] have a nice profound
[2:13:06] um effect upon you because you and your
[2:13:11] house shall be saved. Don't you love the
[2:13:15] Lord?
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; The hour has come and even right now is
[2:13:21] revelation he's given to us is growing
[2:13:24] greater and greater. God bless you. Let
[2:13:27] us pray. Lord Jesus,
[2:13:30] thank you for your word today.
[2:13:33] Thank you for the hearts that are
[2:13:34] gathered here. May the great Holy Spirit
[2:13:38] give to each one what they have need of.
[2:13:41] Lord, I know that some
[2:13:44] are struggling with whatever test,
[2:13:48] whatever bear or lion or Goliath,
[2:13:52] whatever temptation they're going
[2:13:55] through. Father, I pray that you'll give
[2:13:58] them grace and truth to overcome,
[2:14:02] knowing that it will be a great victory
[2:14:03] for them. And as they receive the word,
[2:14:07] that you'll give them more word. And we
[2:14:11] know, Lord, that you have revealed
[2:14:13] yourself to all mankind.
[2:14:17] Even the one on the streets that say
[2:14:19] they don't believe, you have revealed
[2:14:21] yourself to them. And oh God,
[2:14:25] that time comes for us to be a witness
[2:14:28] to them. I pray let it come is our
[2:14:31] prayer. The hour has come that these
[2:14:35] things must be fulfilled.
[2:14:37] My hour has come.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we thank you for all your
[2:14:43] blessings. We ask you, Father, in Jesus
[2:14:48] name we pray.
[2:14:50] Amen.
[2:14:53] I can do all things
[2:14:57] through Christ.
[2:15:01] I can do all things
[2:15:06] through Christ.
[2:15:10] Through Christ
[2:15:12] that set me free. I can do I can do all
[2:15:20] things
[2:15:23] through Christ.
[2:15:26] I can do all things
[2:15:31] through Christ.

[2:15:35] I can do all things. All things,
[2:15:41] all things will rise through Christ.
[2:15:46] [Music]
[2:15:49] Brother John,

[2:16:09] I can do all things
[2:16:13] through Christ.
[2:16:17] Through Christ
[2:16:20] that strengthens
[2:16:22] me.
[2:16:24] Sing that again. I can do all things
[2:16:30] through Christ.
[2:16:32] [Music]
[2:16:34] I can do all things

[2:16:54] that strengthens
[2:16:56] me.
[2:16:58] [Music]
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. just a moment ago when brother
[2:17:02] Israel was talking about when you be in
[2:17:05] the valley, there's an end to the
[2:17:06] valley. There's an end when we're on the
[2:17:08] mountaintop as well. But just that
[2:17:10] thought came to my mind. He's the lily
[2:17:12] of the valley. He couldn't be the lily
[2:17:14] of the valley unless we were there to
[2:17:15] enjoy him in the valley. We don't see
[2:17:17] that lily of the valley up on the top of
[2:17:19] the mountain. And just maybe we can sing
[2:17:21] that. I found a friend in Jesus.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; He's everything to me.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; Let's stand as we just tell him that.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; I have found a friend in Jesus. He's
[2:17:31] everything to me. He's the barest of the
[2:17:35] thousand to my soul.
[2:17:39] He is the lily of the valley.
[2:17:45] I see all I need to cleanse and make me
[2:17:49] fully.
[2:17:53] In sorrow he's my comfort. In trouble
[2:17:57] he's my strength. He tells me every care
[2:18:02] on him to roll. Hallelujah. He's the li
[2:18:07] of the valley,
[2:18:09] bright and morning star. He's the
[2:18:13] fairest of 10,000 to my soul.
[2:18:19] He all my griefs has taken and all my
[2:18:23] sorrow.
[2:18:25] in temptation. He's my strong and mighty
[2:18:29] God.
[2:18:32] Oh, for him forsaken
[2:18:35] and all my idol storms from my heart.
[2:18:39] And now he keeps me by his bound.
[2:18:45] Oh all the world forsake me and Satan
[2:18:49] can't be stormed. Through Jesus, I shall
[2:18:53] safely reach the goal.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; He's the lily of the valley, the bright
[2:19:02] and morning star. He's the fairest of
[2:19:06] 10,000 to my soul.
[2:19:10] And he will never never leave me nor yet
[2:19:15] forsake me here. Shall I live by faith
[2:19:19] and to his blessed will?
[2:19:24] A wall of fire about me. I've got
[2:19:28] nothing out to fear. With this man, my
[2:19:32] hungry soul shall fear.
[2:19:36] And it's sweeping up to glory. We'll see
[2:19:41] his blessed face. Where rivers come,
[2:19:45] light shall ever roll. Hallelujah.
[2:19:50] He's the lily of the valley, the bright
[2:19:54] and morning star. He's the fair of

[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Key of F as you go.
[2:33:21] in a manger long ago.
[2:33:24] I know it's really so. A babe was born
[2:33:28] to save men from their sin.
[2:33:33] John saw him on the shore, the lamb
[2:33:37] forever more. Oh, Christ the crucified
[2:33:41] of Calvary.
[2:33:44] Oh, how I love that man from Galilee.
[2:33:51] For he's done so very much for me.
[2:33:57] Oh, he's forgiven all my sin. Place the
[2:34:01] Holy Ghost with him. Oh, I love I love
[2:34:05] that man from Galilee.
[2:34:09] Oh, the publican went to pray in the
[2:34:13] temple there one day. He cried, "Oh
[2:34:17] Lord, be merciful to me."
[2:34:21] He was forgiven of every sin and a deep
[2:34:26] peace placed within. He said, "Come and
[2:34:29] see this man from Galilee.
[2:34:34] Oh, how I love that man from Galilee.
[2:34:41] For he's done so very much for me.
[2:34:46] Oh, he's forgiven all my sin. Blaze the
[2:34:51] Holy Ghost within. How I love I love the
[2:34:55] man from Galilee.
[2:35:00] Well, the lame was made to walk and the
[2:35:04] dumb was made to talk. That power was
[2:35:07] spoken with love upon the sea.
[2:35:13] the blind who made the sea. I know it
[2:35:17] could only be the mercy of that man from
[2:35:22] Galilee. The fourth verse, Nicodemus
[2:35:25] came. Nicodemus came by night to know
[2:35:30] the way of right. He asked the son of
[2:35:34] man, "What must he do?" Through these
[2:35:39] words, he said to him, "He must be born
[2:35:43] again by the spirit of that man from
[2:35:48] Galilee."
[2:35:51] Oh, how I love that man from Galilee.
[2:35:58] for he's done so very much for me.
[2:36:04] Yes, you're forgiven all of my sins.
[2:36:08] Thanks, the Holy Ghost within. How I
[2:36:12] love I love the man from Galilee.
[2:36:17] And then a woman at 12
[2:36:21] all her sins did tell how 500 she'd had
[2:36:27] at that time
[2:36:30] she was forgiven of every sin and a deep
[2:36:35] came within. Then she cried, "Come see
[2:36:39] that man from Galilee.
[2:36:41] [Music]
[2:36:43] Oh how I love
[2:36:52] [Music]
[2:37:32] Oh my god.
