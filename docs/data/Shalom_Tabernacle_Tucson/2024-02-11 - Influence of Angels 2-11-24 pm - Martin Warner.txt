and gathered together I want to just uh appreciate our brother Po and uh we had a little Fellowship we wrote for breakfast one morning and really enjoyed our time and uh his spirit and of course it's not his spirit it's the spirit of Christ amen that's what we want to see and and that's what we we can fellowship with amen so uh I want to just bring your greetings again from Canada and overseas uh from from Europe and uh also in Down Down in Africa in the Congo and over on the east side to the mosm Beek and Malawi different places like that they you got a family over there you got brothers and sisters over there you've never met maybe and maybe I'll be able to share a little bit with you tonight and get a few visuals and some testimonies it'll be kind of like a shotgun service because I I don't have anything I really want to focus on but uh it's always the thing for a preacher is you know to try to to try to get the mind of the Lord and something that would help you amen so I think just sharing some of the mission work would help you to see uh you know what the faith the faith that is around the world that same faith we have amen so God bless you and we'll take our Bibles tonight and we'll turn to Isaiah chapter 6 you want this one brother yeah I think so I'm not used to it's on [Music] okay I just put it in my pocket there's no all right yeah a familiar scripture if uh you can hear me okay yeah yeah Isaiah we're going to turn to Isaiah chapter 6 and it's a like I say it's a familiar scripture to all of us but uh I I like to read it when I do a mission report because it just catches the essence of of being sent um we'll read uh and just before we do we want to just pray once more father before we read your word Lord anyone can open the Bible and read from it but it takes you Lord Jesus to make the word real to us and father tonight we're just humbly asking Lord that you'll come and Quicken your word to our hearts and father and forgive us of our wrongs our failures our thoughts anything we've done or said Lord that be grieving in any way forgive us Lord we we just offer that up to you Lord and ask God you just get us out of the way both the hearer and the speaker and we'll give you the glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen let's read from Isaiah chapter 6 and I want to speak uh tonight on on the report just kind of weaving in a little bit about the ATM the influence of angels amen the influence of angels and uh this is what sent Isaiah out was influence and we we all want to be under the influence of angels and as we're doing the report tonight uh being a doing Mission work and seeing God move God can heal us at any moment at any time you know I I wanted to testify I had an attack of vertigo on on last Thursday and then we ended up the whole day in bed Saturday and then Sunday morning I just thought I'm going to I'm going to fight this I'm going to get back I went to church Sunday morning and then we ended up coming here Sunday night for communion and then when our brother was doing communion one of the last things he said was and there's healing in the cup and it just I just grabbed it I just grabbed it see when when something is said just grab it grab that inspiration and we came up I took the communion and all the all the back of my head the dizziness just left amen the next morning I was fine amen and uh my Good Wife prayed for me amen and I I remember the testimony brother Braham said a a brother took a heart attack and his wife came in prayed for him and chased that devil out and and and was gone and and she told Brother branam about the dream and she was in the in the room beating this devil out of the room and he she he brother brandom said that's that's what you did when you prayed for your husband you beat him out of the room so I I always say be good to your wives brother treat your wife like a queen like a daughter of God Amen you never know God bless you Sister margerie amen so we'll read from uh verse one in the year King Uzziah died I also saw the Lord sitting on the throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple now do you know what the prophet said the train was Angels right angels He said that his train the Greek says the skirt but it was the Angels following him in the temple and above it stood the seraphim each one had six wings with TW he covered his face with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord God of the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the posts of the D doors moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke imagine what an atmosphere when we come into that Holiness amen not just blessing but that atmosphere God may it be tonight that would come into that atmosphere of angels then I said woe is me for I am undone because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand that he had taken from the tongs from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this has touched thy lips and thy iniquity is taken away thy sin is purged praise God Amen aren't you glad for that we had something that purged our sin that cleansed our lips and we can speak God's word also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and whom will go for us then said I here am I send me may the Lord bless his word you may be seated as you're seated I'll just read from Mark 16 uh chapter uh 16: 15 and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen it's still the same gospel we're believing Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen and I I just want to reinforce that so A so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen that we're we're not following after signs but signs follow us the signs of the Gospel follow us the supernatural signs follow us amen today I believe it's uh what is it Super Bowl Sunday but this is Supernatural Sunday amen for us I'd rather be here in the house of God than in any Super Bowl Amen to be here with the supernatural God Among Us all things are possible all things are possible amen and and we we we only limit god wow but if we we we just all things are possible whatever our needs are tonight the Holy Ghost can meet those needs I I wonder if the brother could just put that up quickly and we'll go through a few slides we'll see what our time is like uh this is the continent of Africa so you see how many countries are in this continent the USA is in there China India big Nations and all the rest of them France Spain Germany uh all all those countries so it's a vast continent that you know the prophet said he wanted to get in there and seow Seed in there and it just seems like that's where the SE seed today still it's the the harvest is still ripe amen the the the fields are ripe onto Harvest and we think well it's passed no it's not pass past people are still coming here in North America it's different in in our in our situation but over there it just by the thousands you know and so uh it it you can get lost here for your lifetime brother ly you could be lost for your lifetime it just a vast continent and it takes more than one you know it's not not just our little group it takes all all of us together you do a little work here you do a little work there everybody chips in amen and we find that last predestinated seed so we can get out of here we can go home amen isn't AR aren't you hungry for home I I just want to go home now oh I just come Lord Jesus I mean you know I was walking down here in your streets in Tucson and I was looking at that place where JC Penney used to be and the prophet had that vision of souls in prison and I thought what would he see today as I walked the streets what I saw I thought you know hell has surfaced and but you know there's a promise in the word the same with Jesus he wouldn't leave his soul in Hell neither would he suffer his holy one to see corruption we're living in an age when he will not leave us he will not and there'll be people that will not see corruption there'll be people that whose bodies will be changed I want to be one of them I want to be one of them that's the mark That's the high calling if he takes me he takes me but I'd want to be one of them Hallelujah we got a promise next slide that's the continent there so we were down on the east side of Africa this last time and uh it's uh more towards Mosen Beek right down there at the bottom your right hand side Mosen Beek and then Malawi is just a thin strip there it's a small country Malawi but it's landlocked and and there's a lot of Believers in there and uh you know they call that the warm heart of Africa because the people are really soft they're they're you know you get some Nations they're militant Nigeria or you know some other countries they're more militant but in in Malawi it's just a softness and it just uh uh the warm heart of friendly uh way you know so it's it's nice to go there uh next slide uh that's the road to some of the villages and into Mosen Beek and uh next slide uh you see these bikes along the way and you don't see many cars but you see a lot of bikes and you'll have a you'll have a brother and a and and his wife on the back of a bike or a man and a woman and and they tell me that if you don't have a bike over there in some of the villages you don't get a wife no bike no wife so a bike is is very important over there CU they just go for miles and and they they carry their goods and things so but it's a it's a it's a beautiful country next slide these are some of the missionaries that I work with over there in in Malawi and uh the the front one is a is an evangelist the more evangelist and their brothers the second one Harrison he's he's a missionary and he's doing a great work in in that country so we travel with them and we we'll be over there Lord willing this the end of next month so we'll be back there for meetings and into the country so next slide this this is their parents they're some of the Pioneers that are in the message in Malawi they're and they they both their sons preach and uh they uh they have quite a testimony too and just uh they've been such uh pillars in and you know I don't know but uh I I consider them like my parents in the gospel and uh the sister there she has great testimony uh she you know she's just a simple woman but I've known them for years and years and I was just sitting down last year with them fellowshipping and we were talking about how God provides and Jehovah Gyra and she said Brother Martin she said I once once one time I wanted to go to Zimbabwe for special meetings and Convention some of ministers from America were going and I didn't have the money but I sold cakes on the side and she said I when I sold these cakes I made enough money to get an airline ticket and go and she said I was so blessed but she said then I worried because it took her like I forget how long it took her like two months or three months to make enough and then she said I worried about how I was going to have meet an's meat at when I got back and she said you know the flower I used she said when I went into the kitchen to use the flower she said it never went below half of the the can I just thought what you never said anything like that before like she's just a quiet quiet sister but she she said God and she said I had all the all my sales in two weeks the money came back wow and it took her months to get it but in two weeks she had all of it she sold twice as many cakes so just a little thing you know but uh that's the type of they're Faith people they they just believe and that and that's the kind of people you like to be around you know they're they're they just rubs off on you right so next slide uh there are some of the books that we've been printing right in Blantyre which is something new because it was always shipped over and there's you know there's Port costs there's Transportation costs there and the price just doubles and triples and so we we we got together and said well why don't we print these right here right in your home right in your city and get a printer and and and see what we can do so we started a few years ago and now they're they're getting a lot of the books reprinted Church ages the seals next slide and conduct order and Doctrine some of those major books and uh it's not like the Saints didn't have them there but there's a whole new generation you know a whole new generation has come up and there's a generation that doesn't know about Malachi 4 doesn't know about the message so it's it's you know what what are we going to do we might as well be busy doing something that's right you know do something for God and and that's we just got behind it and and they're coming in the books are coming in so next slide yeah that's that's his garage brother Harrison's garage just full of uh full of books and distributes them from there next slide and these are some of the young people this is a new generation that are coming up and I just I just it just brother you got to come it'll come because it just revitalizes you you see these this fervor for the the young people how they love the Lord and they're hungry and uh you'll see you know traveling you'll see we had a a a car with a bunch of books in the back we stopped at a village and we gave them out we almost mobbed for the books they sat down and read them right there in their own language they read him they just sat down on the ground and read him I was just looking at him brother har saying you just watched this so sure enough he he he started to he started to preach to them you know he said how did how did your church how did your how did your church tell you to be baptized and then they said oh in the name of father son Holy Ghost he said they lied to you whoa I'm just like oh brother he's just he's just bold as a lion you know what he preached them about half an hour they just took all the books there was a church there that month there was a brand new church they raised up in the message and they're still they're still going on so just like that you know so it just kind of you know I got a keep in touch with it because it keeps me inspired amen because there's more there's more seed out there amen and uh yeah and the young people then you know they love to we just try to get as many books in their hands as possible in their own language next slide and even the ones that were on the ground that one guy I just thought he couldn't stand up but I said he wanted to show that he had a book too and I just thought praise God you know next slide uh the the rains uh just was uh over a year ago but they had floods in from mosm Beek coming in the coast and they get them often but it just destroys destroys the their their um their houses because it's mud between the bricks it's not cement and that's that's all they can do but you can see this River overflowed and it just was a major major flood so we took what James said you know show me your works by your faith you know show me your faith by your works and the prophet said works is Faith testimony if you see someone in need he said and you say God bless you be warmed and filled you know we'll pray for you you know like that's not it you know you got to put feet on the gospel the gospel has feet and uh so we said well we're going to do something and we didn't have much but what we had we we put it into going to help the Saints the ones that lost their homes next slide uh that river that overflowed next slide and you can see what they had to do to to get to the Village or to get to get to school you know these little girls and dresses I mean they just build the over these things and they just you know nothing stops them nothing stops them we we would be devastated you know like we can't do this but they just they just go ahead and do you know continue on and and they're resilient people just resilient and next slide yeah some of the buildings and the churches that that were lost you know they salvaged all the bricks they could so you know we just went around you know doing these things and I'm so grateful if if that's my calling in life to to help somebody I've I've got a look I got a roof up above me I've got a good place to sleep there's food on my table there's the shoes on my feet you give me your love Lord and a fine family thank you Lord for your blessings on me if I can share some of that amen you know that would be wonderful so next slide yeah that it's a vast flood flooded area there down below next slide and things were washed out next slide that that's a whole new riverbed that went after it dried up it made a whole New River so that went through farms and houses and Villages next slide some of the Believers uh homes and churches you can next slide so we just went to the grocery store we just start shopping got our got our uh shopping carts and we we got some oil and some salt and some you know some Basics just the basic things that's what they needed so we we went ahead and just loaded up the truck and headed out and just went for seven days straight all over the the southern region so it was just you know when I look back on it it wasn't easy at the time but when I look back on it I I think I'm so glad that I went I'm so glad and they were so glad that someone came someone actually came to their Village like and thought about them cuz the government s of you know forsakes them and there's political stuff over there too that the some people get preference over others and Believers see we were concentrating on Believers if a brother or sister the household of faith do good always to the household of faith you know and uh you can't feed everybody you can't help everybody but you could help some Believers and so you know it's a it's a cust so we loaded up the truck and went to these Villages next slide and some of the widows were were on the you know on the Forefront the widows indeed you know help them first as much as you can so we did that and stopped along the way uh next slide and uh this little brother here he he's I call him brother Watchman because I had a nice watch and it was a red face on it and when he saw that watch he really liked it he really liked it so I gave him the watch and so I call him brother Watchman I said brother Watchman he's he's he was a pastor in that little little group there now that's that's not many people there we're not looking for crowds we're looking for the last elected seat that's what we're looking for we're not looking at you know one of the meetings there there was over 5,000 in a meeting but you know these type of things I really enjoy I really enjoy next slide yeah and that's some of the brothers with brother Harrison at his at his home he runs a small contracting company and uh you know he he puts a lot of his own living into this he's he's not there with his hand out he's not sending emails he's not he's not that type of guy he's just God will supply and God has blessed his business so much that he's able to feed a lot of people put on special me meetings have brothers from America and Canada come next slide this is Through the Jungle from ma Malawi to Mosen Beek and they didn't want to go through the border so they said well we'll just take the shortcut to Mosen Beek and I said well that's you guys know the country but it was rough it was a rough Journey it wasn't uh yeah it was 4x4 Journey that's for sure and then you'd meet some guys on the field and they'd have a big machete out like this you know and you're think H you know it look kind of iffy but they're cutting wood in there and they make coals out of it so come to find out that uh you know if you were caught on that road you'd go to jail because you're crossing the border without going through the border control but they didn't tell me that and we we met one brother in there he he was there and he he got caught he was he slipped over from Malawi side to mosm Beek and was cutting the wood he got caught he spent two years in jail in mosm Beek a brother he paid for that one and I said two years whoa that would have been a long jail sentence and so I said I kind of reprimanded them a little bit I said don't do that to me again I don't want to end up in jail here or some Ransom you know so anyway it was a it was a nice Journey uh it was a rough Journey oh there's a video I didn't know I didn't know that I had some videos but uh so that is the road through the jungle and uh it's not yeah you just you feel sorry for the cars you just hurt for the cars because rang bang you know and okay so there that's the one that's ahead of us and we met some people on that were cutting wood there anyway uh yeah see you can see the basket they just make coals out of it they burn it make coals and then sell it commercially so they make a living off that next slide so we got to some of the remote Villages and uh you know we we talk about homeless people here you know these are homeless people these are the real homeless people because sometimes our homeless people I'm not saying all of them but some of them they don't want a home yeah it's all over North America it's in our city we we can give them a nice warm place a shower food everything they want but they don't want it they don't want it but these people they they take anything that you give them that they do anything to get a little help so next slide uh that that on the side there that's a house that was a house just a it's just a thing of mud so next slide and some of the some of the places that we you know we we we we did a big spreadsheet and we did our costs and we we we did the whole thing out what it would cost and you know it was just it was it was too huge it was too big next slide they're still suffering from it and some of the some of the families there and uh next slide that's all that's left you know of a little place next slide yeah yeah next slide and this this place we got to late at night but uh they lost a lot they lost the their whole house and everything but they came out you know when we came they came out and they were worshiping with us and singing and smiling happy and I'm thinking what's wrong with this like this would not be us but they were joyful in the Lord like they the Lord will supply Lord will do it he's the Creator you know and I just think wow that that helps me because you know it helps me to you know to realize that God is Jehovah Gyra and the joy of the Lord is our strength no matter what happens to us amen next slide now this is a family that is got to be I don't know 300 Square ft maybe that that Hut or that little Shack they had that's the whole whole family and they all fit in there they cook outside there there's no kitchen but they all sleep in there and and uh and they were just standing there on that muddy thing and I thought yeah I thought these are these are really the homeless people that we if we can help you know in any way so we we did and uh but they still haven't recovered next slide that's a church that was gone and uh from the floods that they lost it and they wanted to rebuild so they use their own labor they make their own bricks and uh you know they just need a little help here and there to get going and we went and then uh they asked me to lay the Cornerstone so I next slide I laid the Cornerstone and that church is back up now fully built I didn't have the slide with me but it's back up fully built and uh they're in it worshiping again so you know what it means I I know I heard you you're you're in a maybe building program here or look for you know what it means you you want you want a building for the people of God you know and and and charity let me say this charity begins at home you look after yourself you look after the flock and then if there's anything else you know and God puts it on your heart then do what you can but it's uh you know the the kingdom of God the prophet said was not operated by money right it's Faith it's faith God our God is a Creator he can create money he can create things I've seen him create things over there I've seen him create money like a million dollars in a moment in five minutes and and that that's what we believe that's the kind of God we believe that's what we're taught to believe amen the spoken word is the Original Seed amen and that's still happening amen these signs shall follow them that believe the dead are still raised the blind still see amen there's cripples I I I mean remember sister she was there in the prayer and we had a prayer line she was like this and she was going like this to me and going like this and I just we just prayed a simple prayer and uh I said get up she got up she started running around dancing behind me but she couldn't walk those people God help us Saints to get simple enough in our faith you know and and just just take the word oh we just get so distracted God help us Lord to be simple you know they used to call me Simple Simon when I was a kid because you know I was just a simple way you know but you know God makes makes you the way you are for a reason so you know tell sometimes God hidden and revealed in Simplicity you know we get too complicated Our Lives get too complicated but anyway this might help you tonight uncomplicate our lives right what's really important what do we really got to focus on here you know and and and to love and to to meet one another's needs amen and and there's needs right Among Us next slide yeah I could go through a lot of those but I didn't want to spend too much time uh next slide this brother on the on your left here he's a he's a real man of God and just a it's just an honor these are these are Heroes of Faith sir these are the Heroes of Faith the things they do the sacrifices they make and you know he's he's the circuit Rider preacher and he he goes on his motorbike and he's just so strong but you look at that suit you know you think well you know just the colar all ratted in the back you know but he's in his best and he's doing the work of the Lord and I just so admire them and then on the on the other side of me that's that's Dyson I call him John the Baptist because he's he's a powerful evangelist just a powerful voice you could hear him miles away when when he's interpreting for me I got to stand over here cuz he'll just blow my ear right off he's so powerful but I like I like traveling with him next slide next slide and these are some of the government schools when they you know when their properties are gone whatever the government will they'll put them in a school or whatever and a lot of the Believers were in there so you know we knew they were in there we went down there and encouraged them gave them some some rice some some some oil some something they could you know be encouraged next Slide the washrooms next slide yeah and we started singing with the Believers that were on in that camp and started you know that gives you courage music worship gives you courage and it just gave them courage and I just so enjoy my time next slide and next slide this is the church that was rebuilt and the roof is back on it and uh next slide and the floor is clean everything's back next slide that's one that broke down uh it was a it was it's a fairly large group of people and uh that was from the storm one of the storms and so we were able to uh help them with the roof and get things back on there with them and uh and then uh one of one of the things the brother wanted was a was a sound system a speaker so he could he could play music when people are walking by and maybe play The Prophet's message and uh one of the sisters here in Tucson Tabernacle donated enough to buy that so you know it it just it's just nice like you have a part in that next slide and that's what it looks like but I didn't have the the new slide but it's all back together praise God it's all the roof is up everything's there and they're worshiping in there and he's got his sound system the big speaker you know he's got his sound system and he wanted that so he you know he was just the kind of guy that you know he he was Caesar I call him Caesar Augustus but he brother Caesar he he just said you know said you know that's what I need I need that to attract the people so for the gospel we were able to do that next slide yeah we're having a ministers meeting these are all ministers inside and you know that day we prayed that day and now it's all back together you know God God God will meet our needs you know no matter if you're you have a financial need here tonight and and I'm sure you do we have bills we have mortgages you know we're they think sometimes we're rich but we're not you know we've got to struggle and we got to work and one and two jobs and things like that but God can meet our needs supernaturally if we put him first put the Lord first amen and he'll he'll Supply amen I I needed I let me testify I I needed $2,000 to come down here I didn't I didn't want to come down but I needed $2,000 I figured for my trip and I thought you know I I couldn't get it I I had a hip operation this this year I was four months before that and four months recovering so I was out of work and I thought well I can't do that and and I had a I don't know what what it was but I saw a hand write $2,000 and the next day there was $2,000 in my bank account from someone that doesn't believe the message there was $2,000 this this what I saw and I thought you know because I wanted to do it for the Lord I want to share what's going on for the Lord so the Lord said I'm going to do it and I'll use someone that doesn't believe to do it God is able to these stones to raise children under Abraham he's able to you know and I don't believe in pulling for money I don't believe in it God I believe he's a Creator God is a Creator and he can he can create the right atmosphere he can he can influence people and uh so from that day I mean that's when it happened right there with that prayer let next slide this is one of my precious pictures here it's a a small village in mosm Beek we got to and you can see the sister the look on her eye in her eyes and she's just looking like like she just received a million dollars they don't have cooking oil like to get cooking oil from the from the city like that and salt and butter and things like that it was just like they were holding it just like gold and they were just like looking at you like you know you're some important person but you just feel so small you feel so small you think wish I could do more but they were just so grateful and when we drove into that Village never forget they sing you in they sing you in and when you're going and you're driving away they're running behind singing praising God running behind you singing you home I thought wow just beautiful beautiful character Beautiful People next slide and and uh lots of of lots of Miracles God God does Miracles these signs shall follow them that believe that healing healings and it's not only just natural food it's spiritual food and God H God has to back up his word these signs will follow that's God's word that's not mine and I'm not going to I'm not going to try to muster something up I just let it follow let it follow just be simple amen next slide yeah some of the some of the villages next slide and there's my offering it's a chicken see the brother on this side that's Dyson that's the Evangelist me and him has his little pack because when I see a chicken in in Africa I I just I see drumsticks like floating up in the air like I like chicken and that's real good chicken and so they they said you know everybody we heard it this morning brother the Daniel was Ministry everybody has something to give you have something to give and I tell him that you know said El Elijah asked the woman you you give me first and she said well I got this and I'm going to die said give it to me first and and I said you know and that's what they did and God blessed them for it so next slide yeah yeah that's the other chicken there's another Village another chicken so by the time we put them in the trunk and by the time we get home they're still alive by the time we get home bump bumpity bumpity bump right they're dead but I mean that's you got to eat right something has to die so you can eat so I mean I'm I was happy I mean we we enjoyed those chicken we ate those chickens and me and me and Harrison or not Harrison Dyson we have a thing we he likes chicken too so we sneak off sometimes from the meeting and we go to Kentucky Fried Chicken I know that's unhealthy but we got this thing together and he says Brother Martin Brother Martin let's go to Kentucky let's go to Kentucky I said we're going so we got this thing about chickens there but you know I I'm just grateful you know to to get any to to see them give what they can right they they got something to give you know and that's the circuit Rider preacher there on the motorbike I mean if he gets a little food and stuff like that he's happy you know he gets enough money for his gas and that's him and his wife there in their in their area and we had service in their area under a tree there was a great crowd of people because the the church was was washed away so we were there and we had some testimony meeting there man it was just just a wonderful time and uh a couple of the deacons got up and they were testifying they said Brother Martin when you were here 5 years ago or or 10 years ago he's at this meeting certain meeting then I gave my heart to the Lord and I started serving the lord from that time and I just thought oh man I didn't know I did that he said that was that was you that was you were preaching and that's when I give my heart to the Lord so see and then someone someone here sent me so we're all connected so we all have a part and it's a chain amen and it's and we'll see it by and by we'll see it on the other side amen next slide that's the circuit ride preacher amen that's his motorbike and uh I think that's it next slide maybe oh that was the that was the that was the the chief of that Village we got there late at night excuse me and uh we made a mistake there because you can't do that kind of work at night and we were just too many places to go too far distances we're trying to get to everybody but it got dark and next slide we were in this it was just getting dark and so uh brother Harrison was speaking to the people and you know uh establishing in them on the message preaching the message establishing them on that and uh so as it grew darker we had the food all in the center as it grew darker other people from other Villages you know word gets around and they came around and they were watching and looking and as it got dark they they just uh mobbed us you know we got we got enough we got the majority of food out to the to the Saints there at the needy church but by the time it was you know just about over they just they just come in from every side and they just pushed everybody out of the way because you know what I wasn't mad I you know we made a mistake it wasn't them they got children too they're hungry too and what would you do if you had five children and there was food in the village that nobody else knew you're going to go down there you're going to go down there and see what you can get you know I'm not saying it's right but I don't I didn't feel any animosity I might do the same thing so anyway when those big guys when the big deacons and stuff they couldn't hold them off we just Run for the car he said Martin go run get in the car let's get out of here cuz they were big guys next next slide this is a church we helped uh it's by the the ocean and uh it it had a real testimony uh the Pentecostals in that area were persecuting them because they believed in a prophet and in the message and they were persecuting them and tried to get them in jail and different things so um we were able to help them a little bit they didn't want to see this church built and so I mean look at the roof look at the that's what they had for water like when it rains you just can't I remember being in the back room there with a lantern at night one of those lanterns you know the oldfashioned lanterns studying with a lantern and I just thought no electric and uh so came home I think maybe some of you have seen this before I'm not sure but there was a sister in our a little sister in our church she worked in a coffee shop and uh she was saving for a car and she gave what she had she this just touched her heart and she she gave all what she had and she put a roof on that building by herself and she left the car you know that's testimonies testimony of faith and God blessed her God really blessed her for it too you can't you can't out give God Amen you can't do it so anyway that next slide this is the same church that's the same church wow look at that a little bit little bit here from a CH little bit there this sister that brother you know and that's what happened he's so proud of his church oh man he's just there's his bicycle and real testimony in the village next slide and that's me and my wife because you know God calls a man he calls his wife and I wouldn't be able to go so it's uh what time did we start 20 oh don't say that brother I'll be here all night testifying but uh you know we read in uh we read in Isaiah I think that's yeah that's brother Harrison and and Dyson again uh just some offerings we gave them and next slide is that it that's it that's it thank you so we were talking about what influences us to do these things where where is our influence coming from amen is it is it to build a kingdom to you know uh say what we did right I did this I did that we printed so many books we did this it's not that way you know it's it's it we didn't publicize it and uh we don't have a magazine or you know not really supported much but you know what God that's when you see go you see God in your need that's when you see God and we're just not needy enough sometimes when we're needy that's when we're going to see him that's when he's going to come on the scene amen so uh maybe God will speak to someone here tonight who shall I send you know there's a few gray hairs up here brother Po and and you know I've got a few battle scars from the from the journey and uh different things that happened and you know when you're sick in Africa or you're you're just about to die you know it's a long ways from home but you know if God sent you he'll take care of you amen and he'll bring you home amen but I did say you know one time there I said if I die here I don't want to go in no hospital but if I die here I said you can bury me right here and and don't don't my wife just doesn't agree with that but uh you know don't don't do the expense because I'm going to come up right from that African dirt I'm going to come up we're going to come up Saints we go that way we're going to come up doesn't matter where we are we're going to come up so yeah so uh on that in that order uh what is influencing us where's our influence where's our greatest influence coming coming from you know I was thinking about Isaiah and the temple there and the the influence of angels and uh you know there in the order of angels I'm not a teacher but I've read the message a long time I've studied the message there's different orders of angels there's Ezekiel so it's the four living creatures and the prophet said he said they're Angels but they're not Angels but then he said but they are angels so I'll figure that one out see you got to know the language just what he's saying so you know the the four anointings the four living creatures they were anointings for all those ages and they were influencing that age the lion the the ox The Lion The Man The Eagle right they were in influences and they were they were anointings or living creatures and uh you know you you you can break that down and get into the into the order of angels living creatures there's archangels there's Michael there's Gabriel there's W wormwood you know there's the throne guards there's cherubims there's seraphim there's healing Angels there's protecting Angels there's Guardian Angels there's there's uh messenger Prophet messenger Angels you know you know you know like it says in Hebrew 2 Hebrews 2 how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation you know for the word spoken by angels and the prophet said there that's not Heavenly Angels that's Prophet Messengers the word spoken by Elijah was steadfast would never change it would come to pass amen so he said how will we escape how could we escape Saints amen you know the problem is the problem is we're predestinated we're elected that's the problem because we're not getting out of this see that's the problem you know I tried to run from the ministry I didn't want to get in the ministry and then I tried to run from it and I paid dearly but you don't have a say we don't have a say we don't have a thought coming God's elected predestinated us to sit here in this time in this age under this anointing under this Eagle anointing under this message and we can't do nothing about it so we might as well go with it we might as well run with it amen and and I'm a firm believer don't don't try to go to Ecuador until you go next door right right go next door I was on the bus Saturday and met these two Street Preachers and man I was getting it from both ends just they were preaching and preaching to the bus and brother Arie knows he talked to the brother today and uh you know we just come on out come on out to service they showed up this morning you know that's all your respon come and see don't have to explain the message don't have to explain anything come and see get him in front of the preacher get him in this atmosphere amen that's all we have to do invite someone do some missionary work right here amen and and we used to do that more but you know we've kind of cooled off and we we think well we're just waiting for the Rapture we're just waiting for the Rapture but there's something for us to do Amen brother and you know he the prophet said one time he was praying for a child that was really crippled bad and and he felt so sorry for the child and he said Lord what are you going to do about this and the Holy Spirit spoke back said what are you going to do about it wow what are you doing about it it's up to us it's in our hands amen uh so in in that order of angels we want to be influenced by another realm and I I really believe we're under the administration of Angels in this age the administration and influence of angels we're under a we're under an angel Messenger to the age it's it's all it's all about that God's sending Messengers and we're under that so uh on these uh you know the scripture says be not be not uh now have to read it but don't be afraid to entertain strangers uh Hebrews 13 unaware for some have under entertain angels unaware don't don't be afraid to entertain strangers me because sometimes you know you are an angel we are angels we don't realize it but we are an angel to someone the prophet said you're you're an angel to someone you're a messenger we're all Messengers so you know we we don't uh think of that sometimes and you know as I as I just you know see uh the condition of our our churches we need to be more LED of the spirit individually it's not a church Revelation it's not a group Revelation you need to be led do what God leads you to do you don't have to go to Africa you don't have to go on the street and you don't have to do this that but you might be the hand you you might be your prayer I remember a woman in a hospital in in Canada we I was waiting for my brother-in-law to pray pray with him he had epilepsy and uh this older lady kept looking at me and I'm in the hallway and I'm just you know how that is sometimes you're just shy you're just you know she kept looking at me and just kept looking at me and and she waved and I I waved back and then something was just saying go talk to her go talk to her I didn't want to talk to her I didn't know she's a stranger and and I just felt you know I've learned you better obey right you better obey that still Small Voice now I'm just giving you some testimonies but you know I went in there how you doing and what are you in here for and and uh oh they got they getting me ready for the Boneyard she said you know I said well really I said it's yeah it's terminal she said older lady I said well you know there's a God that heals there's a God that heals I said and do you believe that yeah well yeah so I started talking to about healing and and uh so we talked and uh I said would you mind if I pray with you no not at all so we I prayed for her and and just a simple old lady now there's a Ministry there that's a mission field hospitals prisons any there's there's a Ministry there not for all of us don't feel guilty but if God puts it on your heart and you got you want to do something for God there's lot you can do so anyway we we had prayer and I I thought it was Christmas time and I thought well she was all alone there there wasn't a card there wasn't a flower there wasn't nothing so I thought well I'll just bring her something and went back up to see my brother in-law the next day and talked to her she said you know what yesterday when you prayed she said I said yeah I thought maybe God touched her she said I said did did you did you do you feel better she said no feel the same I said well what happened she said something changed here she said something in my heart changed she might have been bitter she might have been angry she might have had family issues she might we don't know but you know you're the only Christ that some people will ever see right so I just I just rejoiced in that and I said well you know I got some literature on a a man that was sent sent to pray for the sick would you like would you like a book and I had a I had a book with me that it was how the angel came to meise God and I just picked it up and I just said would you well are you are you are you a Mormon are you Jehovah Witness I don't I don't want any of that I said no no this is just a man that was sent to pray for pray for PE pray for God's people said okay I'll take it so she took okay next day I come back or two days no it was the very next day cuz she said I'll read it tonight and I got back and the and the nurse on the ward said I said U did you move so and so and she said no she she she passed last night and I thought the last book that she read was how the angel came to me you know I don't I'm not the judge she could went right into the presence of the Saints because she believed right there the thief on the cross it just takes a minute just to accept it and so I thought praise God you know I'm so glad I listened to that angel that was there speaking to me you know the prophet said the Holy Ghost is an angel and he said you have an angel we all have an angel right from birth everyone has an angel from birth but the elect have an Angel that's a word body you have a word body Genesis 1:26 God created you in the beginning Spirit man he created you a theophany but you bypass that and you came right to the flesh to be tempted amen and tried oh my when it's over Saints that's all this testing and trying all these trials amen all all these all these things that fall upon us it'll be worth it all it it's nothing to compare amen when we get there it's just a breath away and so we were uh you know I was thinking of that the you know the seraphim the cherubims the the the archangels and what what uh Isaiah experienced there you know and I and I and I just started looking at the message and reading about that and and just things started to come out you know I want to finish with this quick here if I can take another 10 minutes can I take another 10 minutes and I'll try to shut it down uh I talked to you know uh a few Brothers about this because I you know I don't you know there's there's things that we don't understand uh but you know there's glimpses if we read the message we feed on the message there's glimpses in there that puts it all together and uh you know Paul spoke about it uh about our our Celestial body bodies terrestrial bodies in 1 Corinthians 15 and the difference because Paul was caught up to the third heaven but we've had a messenger in this day that went under the altar the sixth Dimension and told us what was there you know we are so privileged Saints and it's laying in the message it's laying there and uh so just when we have need of it and I believe we have need of this now because you know we're expecting a resurrection that therefore that that theophan he has to come and pick up this body amen right and and become a glorified body so we're at that time now and uh we should be feeling the pull from our home on high amen Paul said if this Earthly Tabernacle beat usol we have one waiting prepare it in the heavens Amen in 2 Corinthians 5:1 I can take take time to go through the scripture like I said in Matthew 18 and10 take heed that you despise none of these little ones for there I say unto you that in heaven their Angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven and the prophet quoted that many times and he said we have and then he said if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved all refers to what Paul said we have one waiting in the heavens prepared and so you know everyone has an angel so we got to be careful how we treat each other and speak to each other and we've all made those mistakes but uh referring to Acts chapter 8 in the Hebrew series The Prophet uh and I won't put it up but just read it to you chapter 3 he's talking about when Peter was in jail we heard it this morning and uh in them days he said there was a little draw bar draw bar and you raised it up to look out in the prison for you for you let your guest to come in no this was in the house said you had a draw bar in your house and you looked to see who was coming in and uh Peter had been put in jail and the angel of the Lord came and leted him out of jail amen amen that's that brings testimony to my mind but God can get you out of jail too devil put you in jail but God can get you out of jail so he he said he's talking about Peter and when he the angel Lord takes him out he goes to John Mark's house and and they're they're there and Roa goes to the door and you know it's it's Peter and she says you know she just shuts the door and leaves him standing outside you just look to oh it's Peter and then she runs in talks to them well they thought she she's mad no she affirmed it's Peter they said well no it must be his Angel his angel now Prophet picks it up he said they said oh no no that's his Angel standing there he done got into a glorified B you know that that theophany part you remember how that we took that that big diamond out there and then he says if this Earthly Tabernacle beol be dissolved we have one waiting and they thought Peter had done died and this old body had dropped and they buried it in a few and they'll Buri it in a few days he entered into his Angel the prophet he entered into his Angel we all have an angel a theophany and he and he and they say angel and the prophet says Angel here he said he entered into his angel or his and then he says glorified not glorified he said his theophany my you got it up there God bless you guys's are quick yeah he he he but in his theophany the body that's already prepared it couldn't shake hands see it had to be they thought it was theophany but it was Peter but uh Saints it's time for these things to be made more real to us amen and we we ought to be expecting yes sir we ought to be expecting that body that new body uh and and that influence and listen listen to that influence um I'm going to skip a few scriptures here um in Hebrews the Hebrew series is full of this there's a lot in there about our other body and angels and uh see uh Jesus the prophet said was A Spoken Word by the prophets a virgin shall conceive right he was a spoken word Gabriel said to Mary you will have a son right so he was a spoken word so he he he he was not born by sex desire so he bypassed that theophany we all know that I'm not trying to teach you now just kind of sharing with you a little influence here right amen uh so he by we bypassed that he came straight from the the attribute the thought the logos and became flesh he was a spoken word where we came by sex desire we came by the flesh to be tempted and tried so that's why the prophet said Jesus went to hell and preached to the souls in prison in that in that theophany form so he was barred from the resurrection until for 3 days until all the word was fulfilled and so are we barred from the resurrection till all the word is fulfilled amen and the prophet said I see nothing I see no scripture that needs to be fulfilled all I see is the Readiness of the Bride it's all been fulfilled I'm not looking for something to happen it's happened it's already happened happened we just need to catch it we need to catch up and catch it amen and if you catch it amen just and and just be simple just don't try to strain don't try to make anything big about it just be simple God you'll reveal it but be sensitive amen see uh that's that's where we're at see and the prophet said in the in this message who is this mzc he said you're not a hybrid at all he said you're an eagle he's an eagle then after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food then you left the other thing and you've been formed into the image of the Living God how were you made in the beginning you were made Spirit man so that's coming together now in this Dimension and he said when you heard that eagle scream he said then you heard from your theophany amen how many have heard from their the amen you heard if you believe this message I mean if you really believe this message is a revelation in your heart you heard from your theophany that's the only thing that could reveal it to you amen so and you don't just hear once amen I'm I'm listening for a different sound I'm listening every day so if and then the proph that you heard from your theophany if this Earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting he quotes Paul again there was the prophet named Moses one time he said over in the land he died on the Rock the Angels took and buried him there was another man an eagle he was he didn't have to die he just walked across Jordan and God sent a chariot down the robe of Flesh dropped and he rise and caught the Everlasting prize 800 years later 800 years later on the mount Transfiguration there he stood the two of them moses' body had been rotten for hundreds of years but here he was in such a form till even James and Peter and John recognized him wow amen if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting there he was there they were standing there on Mount transfigure in their theophany yeah that's theophanies it wasn't flesh not like melzak you know the prophet said mzc was was was a glorified body he could eat right he could it was a it was it was a a an example of the Resurrection cuz they and those bodies can't eat they can't sleep but we will have a body that we can eat right so you know you might think that well this is simple Brother Martin but it is real it is more real than we realize amen and and it's just coming more and more real I'm not going to be long just stay with me a few more minutes see uh but I have good news for you and you here tonight we have now when we've heard the message and we heard from Earth theophany we have a spoken word birth you were birthed by the word you were not birthed by some sensation or some miracle or some sign follow the sign no follow the voice behind the sign right you weren't birthed by some sign or wonder I didn't see any of the signs or wonder I heard the word of my salvation repent and be baptized the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen and then then the understanding comes that's just the new birth that's you're you're just a babe in Christ but when you start hearing from your theophany that matures you amen that's the maturity that's the adoption oh it's not too high for a Saints it's right here and and we just we just need to let God reveal it to us see but see when we repented and confessed and then we heard from that you know your word body your theophany that image that you were made Genesis 126 has never sinned this flesh has sinned and and and the prophet said a righteous man A righteous woman is not a sinless man or a sinless woman Elijah was a man of like passions but he got angry his temper got up he you know he he he said send me a Minstrel I need a menstrual because I'm in a bad mood you know I didn't want to see this guy's face today you know but then it just it just that just brought him into that that Spirit like that's why the the song service is so important amen it just you know songs singing can deliver singing Take Spirits right off you you come in here with an attitude you've been feeding on the wrong thing doing the wrong thing and then you know you you sit there and you repent and you pray and then you get into that song service and just it just lifts right off I've seen suicide Spirits lift right off wow in a song service you don't know what you're doing we don't know what we're doing sometimes it's just just taking our place our position amen so um you know Satan likes to overwhelm us and uh with grief and sorrow and disappointments and we all have those things but we need to hear from our theophanies amen because that's the only thing that's going to give us strength amen and courage to go on you know uh we've all made mistakes we've all you know but like I said a righteous man is not a sinless man uh you know we've all made mistakes and um fell on our faces I know I have that's why I wanted to run away from the ministry wanted to call it quits God wouldn't let me he wouldn't let me and he won't let you either he won't let you fall away either no you're elect he's going to he's going to bring you the the easy way or the hard way he's going to bring you isn't that isn't he wonderful ain't he loving isn't he gracious make the stupid mistakes amen but you know it's like that uh that example one of the brothers showed me you know he had a little boy and uh he took the little boy up and the little boy said what's your father's name and he told me his name and and he said okay you sure of that and he yeah that's my father's name what's your mother's name yeah that's my mother's name yeah yeah okay uh you're sure about that and he said yeah yeah I'm sure about that and so then he said well just fall down on the ground so he fall falls down on the ground and then he and then he picks him up again and he says what's your father's name he says same name he said what's your mother's name same name he said you when you fell it didn't make any difference your parents are still the same wow your father's still the same yes sir your mother's still the same see the prophet came to a place where he said I'm not the son of Charles and El brown right we we we got another father he's our father our mother our sister and our brother amen and because you fall it doesn't mean that any his love changes his love is unconditional amen it's pre predestinated unmar Grace unconditional unconditional it doesn't change you can mess up terribly and I'm not saying you should you'll pay for it am but you know what his love does not change and I'm so glad I serve a God Like That amen I think I heard the brother testifying of that last time I was here I'm I'm so glad I serve a god like that that you know he's not an Angry God he's a loving God and you know I I uh I was riding a horse up here in the Prescott one time and these young guys were really riding ahead of me fast and uh they they had me on the horse that followed the other ones and this horse fell in a canyon and he and he went up against the rocks and there was ice in it you know I just bounced off of that that horse and I thought if I let go of these rains he'll trample me to death cuz he was kicking trying to get up off the ice so i l on his I laid on my belly on his rump and he bounced a few times and I said I got to hold on to these RS I got to hold on and I I I got to get back in that saddle and God taught me a lesson right there you better get back you got to get better get back to what I called you to so I just bounced a few times and I pulled on those rains I jumped back up in the saddle and the and the young boys your relatives sister Grace and uh they said hey how did you do that can you do that again I thought my leg would have been crushed I would have been trampled by this horse and I'm thinking this is not a rodeo show this is not this is not games this is like that was my life flashed before me like you got to hold on hold on Saints hold on to those rains you know don't let the rains go anyway uh no matter what we've done there's an angel you have an angel you know and let me let me just try to close here uh in Phoenix uh life story in Phoenix the prophet said when um he had got overwhelmed any anyone ever been overwhelmed I see some Expressions there amen and and that's what the the devil likes to do overwhelm us but we've got a mightier Angel we've got a strong Angel you've got a powerful powerful theophany your your theophany is all powerful if we just get in touch just stay in touch not talking about something real you know spiritual just just in a simple way just you know get before the Lord and what do you want me to do what what what what should I focus on help me to get more serious you know you know I I want to see God moving in my life how many want to see God moving in their lives amen I I I want something and it that's all it is Saints it's just that prayer and and that desire and uh you know he he says in life story here he got overwhelmed because he he wanted to commit suicide now that's some of the some of the things in the message we we're not proud of right but it's a fact right and others other prophets did too right other prophets did too but it it's just you know people like to like to make a God out of everyone right and and they're perfect we're human we go through things and the prophet was going through things that overwhelmed him and and he felt like taking his life and he and he even tried now I want to ask you a question did the prophet have the Holy Ghost yes sir yes sir you did have the Holy Ghost you can get so overwhelmed even with the Holy Ghost wow you get to a place Satan get you in a place you're so overwhelmed it takes the God's intervention the Holy Spirit to come down and intervene I know it did in my life and you know when he got so overwhelmed he he threw that gun it went off his own testimony he fell asleep and had a dream and he says he went there and he saw his Sharon Rose and and Sharon Rose says to him uh daddy and he said you call me daddy said dad you just don't know where you're at see this is heaven down on Earth you I was your little Sharon Rose said don't you remember what you're teaching on immortality is I I teach that there won't you taught that there won't be any little babies in heaven we're all one age one size Immortal amen this is not fair Tales this is the reality and he said we'll just be there no real old people and no real little babies we'll just be one age the youth forever said do you remember your teaching on immortality see you're you're not Sharon Rose said yes Daddy I said well Sharon honey I don't understand she said and then she asked him a question about Billy Paul and his home see so my question is how did she know what brother Brandon preached because she died at what six months or right how did she know about who is this mzc and the theophany she never heard those messages but she was in a body she was in a body that knew all things there was no time there there was no yesterday there was no tomorrow and so he's here she's preaching to the prophet is't that wonderful so your theophany knows a lot more than you do so Lord speak to me speak my Lord and I'll be quick to answer thee amen and and and so I thought the same thing about Jesus 12 years old how did he know he was the word he had a spoken word birth but so have we now had a spoken word birth and we're back in contact with Earth theophany and we're hearing from it amen and and that's what Jesus did at 12 years old I uh maybe the musicians can come amen maybe the musicians can come I just wanted to share few things like that about angels and I have a message on it but I I just wanted to put that in with the mission report amen I was I was preaching in Germany and I can't explain it but uh I was uh just preaching away and a few minutes I thought I was going to pass out and I thought I got lightheaded or something and I was just preaching away and all of a sudden brother I I was up here and I was watching myself preach just for a second I was aware I thought how can I be there and here at the same time I thought well I'm going to faint or I just got lightheaded or but it was my theophany preaching if you yield it'll be your theophany speaking don't take a thought what you're going to say I'll I'll give you what to say your theophany already knows that amen and and uh so I I just thought I I left it for years I didn't know what what that was but I know what it is now I know what it is now by this word you know uh I I I mentioned that in Germany when I was there you can play something sister if you want uh in Germany and U this sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer and they didn't give her much time six weeks or so she wanted to go to church the week before she passed and she's standing at the altar and the pastor told me they were praying you know and the young children congregation had young children and it was just a heartbreak you know and she said pastor she came up said pastor I she said I am I have such peace she saidit scares me I know where I'm going I I I know he's going to take me and I know where I'm going and he she said the peace just scares me why should we be afraid of death man the pro said he's afraid of death all his life until he went to the other side he said I saw some of you there my brother maybe he saw us he not see us tonight my oh I could testify now now I can testify now amen you know and I just thought there's a sister this sister that was that was dying she she said pastor I have this I don't feel any fear at all I'm just going to walk through a door amen hallelujah you're just going to walk through a door it's only a door it's only a buggy amen it's it's going to bring us right into that Fellowship in that in that place and you know uh the Pastor said said Brother Martin you don't know might not believe this but her theophany was standing right beside her young woman standing right beside hero I said I believe that it's not four feet it's not 3 feet it's not 4 feet now this is you can't teach this to everybody you can't preach this to everybody but I believe it I believe it and and I'm seeing it and you know this other sister came up to me after the one of the services and she said you know the mar I'm just you know I just serve the Lord as I serve my husband I don't have dreams or visions or anything like that but she said I was in the baby room and she said I was changing the baby the diaper on the baby and she said all of a sudden I was up there on the ceiling watching myself change to baby she said said could that be my theophany I said it it sounds like it it sounds like it and this this sister's not she didn't claim to be spiritual or have dreams or visions or anything but she said that happened once but it showed me she was going through a hard time and it showed me that that I have a body I have an angel looking after me and it just straightened her when I when I spoke on that so many many testimonies amen a girl from Wanda dying terminal cancer small children again and we prayed with everything that was in us we believed and we and it wasn't our lack of faith but it was God's time she had gotten away from the Lord come back to the Lord was on fire for God witnessing testifying everywhere and then God takes her home like God owes us an explanation he doesn't owe us nothing and and we tried and we prayed and you know and a sister was sitting with her and she said she was at she saw that the the door had a glass in it saw a white man there what's a white man doing here and uh he walks in walks right through the door walks right up to the bed and she said it was brother Brandon and she knew immediately she said she'll go home today brother brandham came is that too much for us I'm going to meet brother brandham I'm expecting to meet brother brandom I'm expecting him to walk in the church tour some night amen Saints it's not a dream it's not a it's reality amen I could tell you story after story about angels amen and they're here they're here to energize the prophet said your faith and they're not you know with the wings and everything they're they're they're a man and they're a woman and the prophet said I saw an angel he was a man
