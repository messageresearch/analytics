[22:50] good to be in the house of the Lord with
[22:51] you tonight we'd like to greet each of
[22:54] you precious name of our Lord and savior
[22:58] Lord Jesus Christ we' like to go right
[22:59] into the scripture in 1 Corinthians
[23:02] chapter
[23:04] 14 and excuse me we're going to be
[23:08] playing the tape um the tape is the
[23:11] church order but I'm I got a few notes I
[23:13] wanted to read just to maybe set it up
[23:17] before we go to that but in 1
[23:19] Corinthians chapter 14 I move to I move
[23:24] to this
[23:26] handheld
[23:34] verse number
[23:37] 26 and
[23:39] 27 speaking of the speaking in tongues
[23:42] and the
[23:44] gifts here is what the Apostle Paul is
[23:47] setting things in order in verse 26 how
[23:50] is it then Brethren when you come
[23:53] together every one of you have a Psalm
[23:56] half a Doctrine hath the tongue ha the
[24:00] Revelation ha an interpretation let all
[24:03] things be done unto edifying yes and if
[24:09] any man speak in an unknown tongue Let
[24:11] It Be by two or at the most by three and
[24:16] that by course and let one interpret
[24:20] amen so we'll pray Lord Jesus we ask
[24:23] your blessings on your word tonight
[24:26] bless your people that are gathered here
[24:28] Lord we come gathered in your name we
[24:31] pray your blessings to come and touch
[24:33] every heart every light every life Lord
[24:37] we don't come here uh for a form or just
[24:41] a ritual but Lord we come to to to feed
[24:44] on your word to come into your presence
[24:47] to draw strength from you we know
[24:50] there's a great battle Zone and a great
[24:52] journey that's in front of us and we
[24:54] want to be ready Lord to meet the
[24:56] challenge of the day we believe in your
[24:58] word you've given to us what we have
[25:01] need of for that great Challenge and
[25:04] Lord may you speak to our hearts and
[25:06] equipped us with a portion of that word
[25:08] tonight in Jesus name we pray amen God
[25:12] bless you you may be
[25:13] seated setting the church in order would
[25:17] be the title for my part and then we're
[25:19] going to listen to church order here in
[25:21] just a moment you know um in
[25:25] 1958 brother random preaches a message
[25:28] Church order we're going to listen to
[25:30] that tonight and as I listened to it I
[25:33] think brother art sent a quote from it
[25:35] to the to the brothers on the board and
[25:38] I listened to that today and it just
[25:40] really spoke to my heart and it it
[25:42] touched me a very special way some of
[25:45] the things what the prophet had said in
[25:47] that message that we all know that he
[25:50] said he preached Church order twice it's
[25:52] in
[25:54] 1958 and then or 1959 sorry
[25:58] 1958 of October and then he um also
[26:03] brought it again I think in' 62 or 63
[26:07] Church order that one's a little bit
[26:09] longer but in this one he goes and he's
[26:13] dealing with the gifts and he's setting
[26:14] the church in order and he's talking
[26:16] about how that those gifts did people
[26:20] need to meet 45 minutes before the
[26:22] service and I thought you know he's
[26:25] really speaking to a church church or a
[26:28] group of people that this would be a
[26:31] pattern or what we should look to as an
[26:35] example even though many of us have
[26:38] never saw a church in the message
[26:40] operate the way we're going to hear on
[26:42] the tape here tonight uh many of us have
[26:45] not maybe some of us have but it still
[26:48] was set in order and brother bandam put
[26:51] it in order in 1958 and then there were
[26:55] repercussions of of him putting that
[26:57] that in order there's a group of people
[26:59] that left the Tabernacle because they
[27:02] wanted the gifts to run rampid on the
[27:04] floor and I believe the Tabernacle ran
[27:06] that way for some time but brother
[27:09] brandham watched those gifts come into
[27:11] fruition and then he brought you say the
[27:14] correction he put it in order and here
[27:17] the Apostle Paul I thought this was
[27:19] interesting that a Gifts of speaking in
[27:22] tongues he said let it be two at the
[27:26] most of three that's per service there
[27:29] shouldn't be more than three of these
[27:31] messages in one of these meetings
[27:34] brother random later tells us that this
[27:36] wasn't just a regular service this was a
[27:39] service specific for the gifts to go in
[27:43] operation and so those gifted people
[27:45] should come together and um pray and
[27:49] wait on their Ministry and then once
[27:52] those gifts uh were manifested prophecy
[27:56] shouldn't just be the the Lord is coming
[27:58] or some praise or some it should be
[28:00] something specific to the people in the
[28:02] church and and uh brother randam sets it
[28:06] very very clear so this isn't a baby
[28:08] Church you know uh this this what we're
[28:11] looking to tonight is an example of a
[28:14] mature church this is an example of what
[28:17] we should be looking to and so hiding
[28:21] behind the corners hiding behind you
[28:23] know you know we have to take our own
[28:25] responsibility and I believe the word of
[28:27] God will will will bless us if we do
[28:30] that so we start with the word we might
[28:32] not ever see it take place in our life's
[28:36] journey but we're still called to preach
[28:38] it and this is the example amen so in
[28:42] 1961 questions and answers brother
[28:45] brandom says this this is in paragraph
[28:47] 140 question number
[28:49] 112 in what order is tongues and
[28:52] prophecies to be used during the service
[28:55] it is not to be used at all during in
[28:57] the service to glorify God not at all
[29:01] and the edifying the church I know that
[29:03] people say the spirit of the Prophet is
[29:05] I know the I guess I beg your pardon
[29:10] Spirit of the Prophet is subject to the
[29:12] prophet exactly spiritual speaking in
[29:15] tongues and prophesying is to edify the
[29:19] church but it has its service of its own
[29:23] see it isn't to bother as long as the
[29:27] prophet of the church is the meetings in
[29:30] order see it's never to interrupt the
[29:32] meeting now see the spirits of the
[29:35] prophets we got another question now
[29:38] let's let that go just for a minute see
[29:40] the real correct way of these operate
[29:44] operate these gifts this is answering
[29:47] many gifts you see when we get to them
[29:51] we'll say we answered it in this first
[29:54] one this person on this one here see
[29:56] that's number five the tongues and
[29:59] prophecy to be used during the service
[30:01] to glorify God you see now the minister
[30:05] if the minister is Anointed of God and
[30:07] the church is set in order now the
[30:09] correct way many of you know how I've
[30:12] talked to you about
[30:14] how you about have to set it in order
[30:17] these gifts are supposed now here's what
[30:21] we do in the Tabernacle the Lord willing
[30:24] now I'm watching I'm seeing something
[30:27] leaving brother Neville and these other
[30:29] Brethren here in order now many of these
[30:32] brothers are young Brothers now I'm an
[30:35] old veteran to all of you in this way
[30:38] I've been 31 years in this it was about
[30:41] 30 years ago I laid the stone there I've
[30:44] had to face everything there was to be
[30:46] faced and you better know what you're
[30:48] talking about too when you come to it
[30:51] you better not only know that better be
[30:54] God there to back it up when you get
[30:57] when you get through with it now the
[30:59] most successful way of doing this now
[31:03] you could have a special meeting I
[31:05] believe that's what they done in 1
[31:08] Corinthians 14 there something be
[31:11] revealed to one setting by let the other
[31:14] one hold his peace then I believe it was
[31:17] a special meeting for gifts which would
[31:20] be all right if they wanted to have a
[31:22] special meeting where all the gifted
[31:24] people met once a week then with gifts
[31:28] come into the church that be fine let
[31:31] them have that meeting there's no be no
[31:34] preaching it's for the gifts of the
[31:38] Spirit it ain't for The Outsiders and
[31:41] the
[31:42] unbelievers they'd come in and sit down
[31:44] say one raise up and go a speak in
[31:47] tongues the other one say wow what in
[31:50] the world they come and say where's the
[31:52] sinking where's the rest of it see but
[31:55] now these that speaking in tongues many
[31:59] of them and interpreting and so forth
[32:02] are babies in the gospel see don't don't
[32:06] offend them let them grow to that gift
[32:10] some of it you can see how Satan tries
[32:12] to weave into some of course veterans we
[32:15] see that we can catch that and you'll
[32:19] watch it how many can say praise the
[32:21] Lord so 1 Corinthians 14 we'd say was a
[32:26] special meeting for for gifts so we see
[32:28] brother randam placing that for us how
[32:31] many can see that just ready for you
[32:34] amen so here in
[32:38] 1964 so that was in
[32:42] 60 oh excuse me 1961 that was three
[32:46] years after he preached this 58 Church
[32:50] order you had these gifts he put them in
[32:52] order and then people left now here's
[32:55] another message here 19 1964 6 years
[32:58] later questions and answers number two
[33:02] all right brother brandom can Satan use
[33:05] the gift of tongues or prophecy in a
[33:07] person who has the Holy Ghost that's a
[33:11] good one isn't it yes sir it must be
[33:14] watched very very close if you'll notice
[33:18] in 1 Corinthians
[33:20] 14:29 you who wants to put it down the
[33:22] person the person who wrote this never
[33:24] signed their name that just said God
[33:27] bless you see 1 Corinthians
[33:29] 14:29 we find out that any gift in the
[33:32] church has got to be judged first see
[33:36] you have to watch cuz evil spirits slip
[33:39] in cuz remember the rain falls on the
[33:42] just and the unjust the same rain that
[33:45] was sent to ripen the wheat also ripens
[33:48] the weeds the same water how many knows
[33:51] that now that ought to clear the serpent
[33:53] seed to you then how that this sun come
[33:56] I'm trying to pick out of here to get it
[33:59] before my time runs out but I can't find
[34:01] it so how that son was about the serpent
[34:04] seed see God has a law now on this in
[34:08] this law of the spirit of life you have
[34:10] to watch because Satan slips in and Paul
[34:14] when he when something was revealed to
[34:16] somebody it had to have at least two or
[34:19] three judges before it could be told
[34:22] before the church now also here I might
[34:25] bring this out see I don't think my
[34:27] brother's here tonight but somebody made
[34:29] fun of somebody leaving the Tabernacle
[34:32] and went down to brother Junior
[34:34] Jackson's for a church so they went down
[34:37] among the dead birds aren't you ashamed
[34:40] to make a remark like that ever who you
[34:43] are if you're my kid here in Christ I'm
[34:46] ashamed of you don't do a thing like
[34:49] that Junior Jackson is my brother Don
[34:52] rutle is my brother well the reason of
[34:55] it because when I set the church
[34:57] here in a certain order when I come back
[35:00] to see if I could get the manifestation
[35:02] of the gifts half of them pulled away
[35:06] from it because when you start to speak
[35:08] or preach or something it was getting in
[35:11] such a place that you could hardly
[35:13] preach unless there was somebody spoke
[35:15] in tongues somebody interpreting
[35:17] somebody give the interpretation and
[35:19] half of it never even come to pass now I
[35:22] believe in speaking in tongues I believe
[35:23] in interpretation but it must be some
[35:26] something directly to the church not the
[35:30] Lord is coming soon or something which
[35:33] is all right but don't use vain
[35:36] repetitions Jesus said as the heathens
[35:39] do it must be something go tell brother
[35:42] so and so a certain thing he done and to
[35:45] get why go tell brother sister so and so
[35:48] when she did a certain thing down there
[35:50] the other day she transgressed the laws
[35:52] of her husband the vow to her husband
[35:55] unless she makes this right
[35:57] right the holy spirit will cut her off
[36:00] there you've got thus sayith the Lord
[36:03] then bring that sin in then when we get
[36:05] a church like it was when ananas and
[36:09] Safar come in then we got a church that
[36:11] stands solid oh you say brother brandom
[36:14] one guy I told him that he said well you
[36:17] put us too much on the spot I said ain't
[36:20] I on the spot up there to strangers I
[36:23] never seen in my life but I've got faith
[36:26] and conf confidence in my God who sent
[36:28] me to do this and never one time has it
[36:31] been wrong or never will it be as long
[36:34] as God is God that's right now speaking
[36:37] in tongues and things like that I
[36:39] believe those tongues and people that's
[36:42] got them gifts if they're real genuine
[36:45] Christians and interested in it they'll
[36:48] meet themselves together because and
[36:51] give their tongues an interpretation and
[36:54] see what they can do to further the
[36:56] kingdom of God God they got a Ministry
[36:58] of their own but they don't belong here
[37:01] in the middle of the audience where the
[37:04] Sinners are being dealt with and so
[37:06] forth the Bible said they'll say you're
[37:09] unlearned sometimes they get so
[37:12] irreverent with it and so forth not our
[37:14] gang hadn't but I like let them go ahead
[37:17] a while and I said watch it now I told
[37:21] the Brethren there were Witnesses here
[37:24] in know this I said let it alone after a
[37:27] while I'll we'll find out whether it's
[37:29] of God or not if it cannot stand
[37:32] chastisement then it's a bastard child
[37:35] that's exactly what the Bible said and
[37:37] when the chastisement come what happen
[37:41] did I tell you that long ago see asked
[37:43] the pastor here he said what about this
[37:46] and that I said just let it alone
[37:48] they're babies we can't judge it but
[37:51] watch when it really comes to pin down
[37:53] to the word now brother Junior Jackson
[37:56] had had a right to disagree with that he
[37:58] wants his church the people all want to
[38:01] speak with tongues and things in the
[38:02] audience that's brother Junior's
[38:04] troubles that's up to him brother Junior
[38:08] Jackson believes the message the same as
[38:11] any of the rest of us does he's one of
[38:13] us it's not a dead bird to go there
[38:16] Junior Jackson is a man of God that I
[38:19] love with all my heart and it's not and
[38:22] and and it's not here tonight so I can
[38:24] really pour it on the way I want to and
[38:26] Don rutle I don't think Don's here
[38:29] tonight cuz they got a church of their
[38:31] own but if I seen every person come to
[38:33] this Tabernacle walk out and go to Don
[38:35] rle or brother JT Parnell or these
[38:39] brothers here that's our brothers here
[38:41] and fellow citizens of the Kingdom I'd
[38:44] be so happy I wouldn't know what to do I
[38:46] say Lord fill this one back up again
[38:50] let's pour it out and fill up another
[38:52] one I love it I love to see those boys
[38:55] they're my my children how many love
[38:59] that what a tremendous attitude Trend a
[39:02] couple of things in here brother Junior
[39:05] Jackson decided not to do the church
[39:08] order the way he wanted to and what
[39:10] brother bam said he believes the same
[39:12] message so it just shows the sovereignty
[39:15] of the local church and those you know
[39:18] brother banam put that in order and then
[39:21] you'll see in 1958 when he talks about
[39:24] the pre-service and he talks about how
[39:26] they gifts should be operated and he
[39:28] talks about you know he's dealing with
[39:31] that in his own church and there's some
[39:33] things that we could you know every
[39:35] local church is growing on its own we're
[39:38] mature or not mature in this area you're
[39:41] growing over here or going over there
[39:43] but I just believe that we have to have
[39:45] a pattern to look to and if these quotes
[39:49] don't mean what they say then then why
[39:52] did he say them and because we've never
[39:55] seen a church in operation ation like
[39:57] that doesn't mean we're not supposed to
[39:58] preach it I believe that that is what a
[40:00] mature church is supposed to be when we
[40:03] talk about the gifts and speaking in
[40:05] tongues is the least of the gifts as he
[40:08] told us and so I thought that would be a
[40:11] blessing for us to hear that it's about
[40:13] 30 minutes or so 34 minutes but um he he
[40:19] he separated that and made that its own
[40:21] special meeting the people with these
[40:24] gifts met 45 minutes before
[40:27] um Pastor wasn't involved in that he
[40:30] said um he talks about every officer God
[40:33] will hold you responsible for that gift
[40:37] and um there should only be two or three
[40:40] of these messages in one of these
[40:43] services and brother bandam says then
[40:45] when you get a church that then we got a
[40:48] church that stands solid and that's what
[40:52] we want to stand solid amen so God bless
[40:55] you let's stand as we sing only believe
[40:58] and go to the message here
[41:00] tonight all things are possible thank
[41:02] you
[41:11] sorry
[41:13] only
[41:17] be
[41:19] only
[41:22] be all things are
[41:28] Possible
[41:29] only
[41:33] reallying
[41:35] only
[41:38] be
[41:40] only
[41:44] be all things are
[41:49] possible
[41:51] only
[41:53] believe God bless you you may be seated
[41:58] we have just closed a big meeting of
[42:03] Five Nights at the
[42:05] Tabernacle where by God's grace and by
[42:09] his help I have tried hard by the
[42:13] scriptures to set in order the Church of
[42:17] the Lord Jesus
[42:19] Christ as we believe at the brandom
[42:25] Tabernacle the first thing I wish to say
[42:30] is that the pastor is always in full
[42:35] charge of the Tabernacle in my
[42:39] absence and I only look to the pastor
[42:42] when I return so he is in full charge to
[42:47] change or to do whatsoever he thinks
[42:50] it's best under the leadership of the
[42:52] Holy Spirit while I am awaiting
[42:57] we
[42:58] believe in an Apostolic Church teaching
[43:03] Apostolic
[43:04] blessings for our peoples of this day we
[43:09] believe in the Full
[43:11] Gospel and believe that all of the signs
[43:15] and the Wonders that was spoken of by
[43:19] our Lord Jesus Christ would accompany
[43:22] his church until he returns we believe
[43:25] in those things
[43:26] things and believe that they are to be
[43:29] set in
[43:30] order that the church has its
[43:34] order and each church has its doctrines
[43:38] and Order and
[43:40] discipline our church has no members as
[43:46] Jers we believe that the whole Universal
[43:49] Church of the Living God is our brothers
[43:52] and
[43:53] sisters and all people are all always
[43:56] welcome regardless of what denomination
[43:59] they belong to at the ram Tabernacle at
[44:02] eth and Penn Street in Jeffersonville
[44:06] Indiana we believe in justification by
[44:10] faith
[44:12] Romans
[44:14] 51 we believe that after a person being
[44:18] justified by faith he has peace with the
[44:21] Lord Jesus Christ but it's possible that
[44:25] this same person could have
[44:28] habits such as drinking smoking doing
[44:32] things that he should not do filthy
[44:35] habits of the flesh then we believe that
[44:38] the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies
[44:41] this person for the service of the Lord
[44:45] and that's we believe in sanctification
[44:47] according to Hebrews
[44:50] 13 12 and
[44:52] 13 for
[44:54] Jesus also that that he might sanctify
[44:57] the people with his own blood suffered
[44:59] without the
[45:00] gates and we believe that sanctification
[45:03] is taught in the New Testament and meant
[45:07] for the Believers through the New
[45:10] Testament age which we're now
[45:13] living and we also believe that after
[45:16] the the person has been Sanctified the
[45:21] unclean habits has gone from the person
[45:23] he's the believer on the Lord Jesus
[45:25] Christ and his habits are gone we
[45:28] believe that then he is a candidate for
[45:30] the baptism of the Holy Spirit which
[45:34] comes as a filling of the
[45:37] believer and then when the believer it's
[45:40] just as many times as I have taught it
[45:43] like picking up a glass out in the
[45:45] chicken yard justification is picking it
[45:49] up ready for to use it with a purpose in
[45:52] heart that's what God does to The Sinner
[45:54] he's still filthy
[45:56] then he's cleansed by the blood of Jesus
[45:58] Christ and the word sanctify is a
[46:01] compound word which means cleaned and
[46:05] set aside for
[46:07] service in the Old Testament the altar
[46:10] Sanctified The Vessel and it was set
[46:13] aside for service we believe that the
[46:16] holy spirit is putting the same vessel
[46:18] in service that the holy spirit is uh
[46:23] not another step of Grace but or of the
[46:26] same Grace that fills the believer to
[46:30] the extent where that signs and wonders
[46:34] such as the apostolic gifts spoken of in
[46:37] 1 Corinthians 12 manifest themselves
[46:41] through this believer when the Holy
[46:43] Spirit comes in to take up the gift I
[46:46] believe at the scripture teaches that
[46:50] gifts and callings are without
[46:51] repentance that when we're born in this
[46:54] world we are sent here by one purpose
[46:57] that is of god and that before we're
[47:02] even become adults while we're yet
[47:04] children the gifts that we have of God
[47:06] is inoc understand and only the filling
[47:10] of the Holy Spirit puts these gifts into
[47:13] operation but we have them in the
[47:15] beginning such as teachers and apostles
[47:18] and and Prophets and Gifts of tongues
[47:21] and the nine spiritual gifts according
[47:24] to 1 Corinthians 12
[47:26] now we believe that these gifts are in
[47:29] operation today and they should be in
[47:31] ever local church although in such we
[47:34] have found throughout the world that
[47:37] there's much fanaticism hooked along
[47:41] with people who profess to be uh
[47:44] Apostolic Believers just as they are and
[47:47] other orders and so forth we have
[47:50] Fanatics that's been all along we've had
[47:53] those Through the Ages they had it in
[47:55] the AP Apostolic day and as Paul said
[47:59] there that how that some had come and
[48:01] persuade them away after other doctrines
[48:03] and so forth but in his own teaching he
[48:07] said if an angel from heaven would teach
[48:09] anything else and what he had taught let
[48:11] him be a curse so we as the brandom
[48:15] Tabernacle at ath and Pinn Street year
[48:18] try to follow the teachings of the New
[48:20] Testament for we believe that Jesus
[48:23] Christ being the Son of God and Paul the
[48:26] Apostle was a called and chosen vessel
[48:29] by election of God to be sent to the
[48:33] Gentile Church to set it in
[48:36] order now we believe in water baptism in
[48:40] the brandham Tabernacle by
[48:42] Mercy In The Name Of The Lord Jesus
[48:44] Christ which is the apostolic uh
[48:48] teaching of the
[48:49] Bible and may all members of the or
[48:53] comers to the Bram Tabernacle who desire
[48:56] such May at any time requesting to be
[49:00] immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus
[49:02] May consult the pastor if they have
[49:05] repented and believed on the Lord Jesus
[49:07] Christ the pastor will as soon as
[49:10] possible even then if he can baptize
[49:13] them immediately this does bring them
[49:15] into the Fellowship of the Believers we
[49:19] believe that by water baptism we are
[49:21] brought into a fellowship but by the
[49:23] baptism of the Holy Spirit we're brought
[49:26] into the members being members of the
[49:29] body of Jesus Christ which is all over
[49:31] the
[49:32] world
[49:34] now another thing that we believe that
[49:37] the manifestation of the spirit is
[49:40] giving to every man to profit with all
[49:43] now we believe that when these gifts and
[49:47] so forth are operating in the church
[49:49] which we covet and desire that the
[49:53] people who are gifted by the spirit come
[49:55] and worship with us now in most places
[49:59] we find that when these gifts in the
[50:01] people the people does not understand
[50:04] how and when to use these gifts and in
[50:09] doing so they only bring a reproach
[50:11] which we believe would be just what
[50:14] Satan could do to make The Outsiders the
[50:17] unbelievers and so forth afraid of this
[50:20] wonderful blessing that God has given to
[50:22] the church in these days
[50:26] Paul said when there come a stranger
[50:29] Among Us and we've all speak with
[50:32] tongues won't the man go away and say we
[50:35] were mad but if one would prophesy and
[50:38] make known the secret of the heart then
[50:41] they would fall down and say truly God
[50:42] is with you now we believe that the
[50:46] spiritual gifts among the
[50:48] Believers is the order of the
[50:52] day we cannot believe that a man can
[50:55] preach under
[50:57] inspiration and then or be an inspired
[51:01] teacher and then Deni the gift of
[51:04] healing or the gift of Prophecy or
[51:06] speaking with tongues or interpretation
[51:08] of tongues or any of these other gifts
[51:11] so therefore here is
[51:15] my belief in God's word the way the
[51:19] brandom Tabernacle at ath and Penn
[51:22] Street here in Jeffersonville should be
[51:24] operated
[51:27] I think the first thing and believe that
[51:30] these things which I say is
[51:32] essential and must be carried out in
[51:35] this manner in the brandom Tabernacle
[51:38] for it to prosper in the
[51:40] Lord and if at any time these this would
[51:43] be
[51:44] questioned the person who is in question
[51:47] about it may consult me if they cannot
[51:51] get to the pastor or they could consult
[51:53] the pastor of if I'm home off of some of
[51:57] the trips I'll be glad to to help either
[52:02] the Ley or the pastor at any time and
[52:04] these things are scripturally and I
[52:07] believe it's the order of the church I
[52:09] think first that every member or every
[52:13] worshipper of the brandham Tabernacle
[52:16] should be so much in Divine love with
[52:20] each other until it would their hearts
[52:25] would
[52:26] long for each other when they have to go
[52:28] away to leave each other at the service
[52:29] at night I am a True Believer in Divine
[52:34] love the Apostle Paul said that was the
[52:38] evidence of the Holy Spirit by this man
[52:40] all man will know you're my disciples
[52:43] said
[52:44] Jesus when you have love one for the
[52:48] other and we believe that it's the love
[52:51] of God that sent Jesus Christ to the
[52:53] Earth to die for for us all God so loved
[52:57] the world he gave his only begotten son
[52:59] that whosoever believeth in him should
[53:01] not perish but would have everlasting
[53:07] life and the everlasting life here is
[53:11] God's own life because we become Sons
[53:13] and Daughters of God by the baptism of
[53:17] the Holy Spirit which is the Seed of
[53:20] Abraham and gives us the faith that
[53:22] Abraham had when he believed God before
[53:25] he was even
[53:27] circumcised
[53:28] now the next thing we believe that these
[53:34] worshippers should meet together these
[53:36] gifted people such as tongues and people
[53:39] who gets Revelations and
[53:42] interpretations and so forth these
[53:44] members or these Believers rather should
[53:48] come together at least 45 minutes or an
[53:53] hour before the services ever began the
[53:56] church should be open early and the
[53:59] Believers come together on these nights
[54:02] and for at least 45 minutes to an hour
[54:06] before the services began I believe the
[54:09] brandham Tabernacle at all time should
[54:11] have a spirit filled
[54:15] pianist who would come early filled with
[54:18] the Holy Spirit and would play
[54:23] softly very
[54:26] softly Spiritual music such as down at
[54:29] the cross where the Savior died down
[54:32] there for cleansing from sin I cried
[54:35] there to my heart was the blood applied
[54:38] glory to his name something on that
[54:41] order near my God to thee Rock of Ages
[54:44] cleff or me or near The Cross or
[54:47] something on that order softly
[54:51] slowly as he is meditating constantly on
[54:55] on the Holy Spirit he or she whichever
[54:57] it may
[54:59] be then I believe that the worshippers
[55:02] coming in should be met and their hang
[55:06] their coats and hats shto their seats
[55:10] with
[55:11] hospitality that only ushers are deacons
[55:15] filled with the Holy Spirit can do and
[55:18] in love to see the Church of the Living
[55:20] God go
[55:22] on these worshippers should not talk one
[55:25] with another and be talking across and
[55:29] making noise in the church they should
[55:32] come together first slip up in silent
[55:35] prayer perhaps at the altar for a few
[55:38] moments no loud praying interrupt
[55:41] someone else silent prayer you're in
[55:46] worship that that soak in
[55:50] worshiping in your
[55:53] spirit then return to your seat or you
[55:58] do not have to go to the altar just go
[56:00] in and get your seat sit down Listen To
[56:04] The Music close your eyes bow your head
[56:09] and be in silent worshiping God all
[56:14] along then if the spirit should reveal
[56:18] something to
[56:21] another or or some one be filled with
[56:25] the spirit to a place where he would
[56:27] speak with tongues then this person
[56:30] should rise and give the
[56:32] message and everyone must hold their
[56:35] peace until the interpretation comes
[56:39] when the interpretation comes it must
[56:42] not be just quoting of scripture or
[56:46] something that has no meaning it must be
[56:49] a message directed to the church or we
[56:52] think that it would be in the flesh M we
[56:56] see so much of that and now I believe
[56:59] the the spirit was to speak only for the
[57:02] edifying of the
[57:04] church and now it would be a message
[57:07] something on this order Perhaps Perhaps
[57:10] the people are gathering by this time
[57:12] some sick people has come in perhaps
[57:14] there's a man laying paralyzed or
[57:16] something you've never seen him before
[57:19] but when the interpretation would come
[57:21] would be something in this order when
[57:23] the interpretation of the one who just
[57:25] spoke would say uh well thus saith the
[57:29] Lord the man who is in our midst has
[57:31] come from a certain certain place and
[57:33] describe the place and would say that he
[57:37] is paralyzed because three or four years
[57:39] ago or whatever it may the case may be
[57:42] he did something evil like left his wife
[57:44] and children and run off from them and
[57:46] he's fell from a trussle or something
[57:48] like that order and got hurt and
[57:51] paralyzing thus saith the Lord if he
[57:53] will repent of that
[57:55] and will promise to go to his wife and
[57:57] reconcile himself to her then he shall
[58:01] be healed now and return to his family
[58:04] and then before anyone says anything
[58:08] there must be at least two or
[58:11] more man or peoples in the building who
[58:15] are spiritually solid in gospel Doctrine
[58:20] who has a good discernment of spirit
[58:23] shall rise up and say that it is of the
[58:27] Lord and if this thing doesn't take
[58:29] place then tongues should not be
[58:32] mentioned in the church if the person
[58:34] speaks with tongues Paul said there be
[58:37] no interpreter and so forth let them
[58:40] speak at home or wherever they may be
[58:43] for they're only blessing themselves and
[58:45] it's not for edification of the church
[58:48] then this person after speaking in the
[58:51] interpretation and then two or three
[58:53] judges according to St Paul's doctrine
[58:56] of the
[58:56] Bible that it must be judged by two or
[58:59] three judges then let the person whom it
[59:03] calls upon to go it maybe it might
[59:06] designate a certain person or the pastor
[59:08] or someone to go lay hands on this
[59:10] person and it it's sick or Afflicted and
[59:15] they will be healed then let the pastor
[59:17] or the other person whoever it may be
[59:21] that was designated by the Holy Spirit
[59:23] to go pray the prayer of faith let them
[59:27] go and minister to the person according
[59:29] to what the spirit has
[59:31] said then at that time the
[59:34] person and whatever the Holy Spirit has
[59:36] said it shall take place immediately
[59:39] then just as the Holy Spirit has given
[59:43] then the people could rejoice and be
[59:46] thankful and praise and worship God
[59:48] because God wants to be worshiped then
[59:51] they must then they must bow their heads
[59:53] and be in prayer again to see if there
[59:55] be another message that the holy spirit
[59:57] will want these gifts to manifest before
[1:00:00] and then if any time that a person would
[1:00:03] speak in tongues and interpret and the
[1:00:06] the judges would send the person to take
[1:00:09] to do whatever it was said to be done
[1:00:11] and it doesn't come to pass then the
[1:00:14] whole group of them shall go to the
[1:00:17] Altar and there pray God to take that
[1:00:19] spirit away from them because there's no
[1:00:22] one would want a spirit like that we
[1:00:24] would know it would be false and would
[1:00:26] be of the enemy and not of God because
[1:00:29] God can only tell
[1:00:33] truth let that be clearly understood by
[1:00:36] the church before you start this this
[1:00:39] new
[1:00:40] order then perhaps maybe it would be
[1:00:44] something like this the message would
[1:00:45] say to a certain brother maybe it say
[1:00:48] would live by a railroad track or
[1:00:49] something to have him to move out
[1:00:52] because there is going to be a wreck on
[1:00:53] the road or something something or
[1:00:55] anything in that order and let the
[1:00:58] judges after they give the church
[1:00:59] permission to
[1:01:00] speak or to exercise this uh message
[1:01:04] that just went forth if their judgment
[1:01:06] is it's of God then watch and see if it
[1:01:09] comes to pass and if it comes to pass
[1:01:12] thank God and be very graceful graceful
[1:01:16] in your heart towards him and give him
[1:01:18] praise and worship and be humble Above
[1:01:22] All Things
[1:01:25] be
[1:01:27] humble don't never get yourself puffed
[1:01:30] up to a place where you know more about
[1:01:33] it in your pastor or the church that
[1:01:35] you're worshiping in if you get to that
[1:01:37] place then ID advise each one of you to
[1:01:40] get another place to worship with
[1:01:43] because I am asking the pastor never to
[1:01:46] permit anything outside of the Bible
[1:01:49] order a way we have seen it here in the
[1:01:52] church and then we want these gifts to
[1:01:55] be operated in place and the worshippers
[1:01:58] if it's carried on correctly according
[1:01:59] to the word you'll see a mighty
[1:02:02] wonderful church and operation for our
[1:02:05] Lord Jesus Christ now then the next
[1:02:09] thing shall take place will be that if
[1:02:12] these people who have that gets out of
[1:02:17] order uh during these times that a
[1:02:20] deacon or some uh Usher that's filled
[1:02:23] with the Holy H ghost and got lots of
[1:02:25] Grace in their heart shall go to the
[1:02:28] person reverently fatherly like and
[1:02:31] shall correct them in this manner or the
[1:02:34] pastor whoever it may be which would be
[1:02:36] more essential for the deacons to do so
[1:02:39] for the pastor at this time while these
[1:02:42] spiritual services are going on should
[1:02:44] be in the prayer room or somewhere a
[1:02:47] Praying these messages then if there's
[1:02:50] no messages going on no Revelations then
[1:02:54] the people would be privileged if they
[1:02:56] desired to raise and give a testimony a
[1:02:59] testimony only for the glory of God
[1:03:03] they're not bound to do this but
[1:03:05] testimony should be given before the
[1:03:07] message or any song service starts or
[1:03:09] anything testimonies in these worship
[1:03:12] services do you understand church that
[1:03:15] in doing this you have the whole church
[1:03:18] in the spirit of worship before the word
[1:03:23] comes in to be taught then the Holy
[1:03:26] Spirit gets in the word and manifests
[1:03:29] God through the word to be a
[1:03:32] confirmation of your worship
[1:03:35] now then after this uh time for the
[1:03:39] pastor to come on if messages are going
[1:03:42] on say the pastor should come out
[1:03:44] exactly say
[1:03:46] 7:30 and or quarter of eight and if
[1:03:49] these messages are still going on before
[1:03:51] the pastor comes to his out of the study
[1:03:54] or wherever he may to take his place at
[1:03:57] the platform some brother should
[1:03:59] instruct him because the Saints knows
[1:04:02] that when the pastor comes on the
[1:04:04] platform it's his time then for the
[1:04:07] service and that gives plenty ample time
[1:04:10] for all the manifestations of the gifts
[1:04:13] to bring the spirit of God into the the
[1:04:17] congregation and if any unbeliever would
[1:04:20] happen to be there be disorderly a
[1:04:22] kindhearted person would go to them such
[1:04:25] as an oer or a deacon and would tell
[1:04:29] them if they would they would ask to be
[1:04:31] kept reverent or be reverent while the
[1:04:34] service is in order because the spirit
[1:04:37] is in the building and the gifts of God
[1:04:40] are being made manifest for the edifying
[1:04:44] of the church and this person must be
[1:04:47] told in love and not harshly unless it
[1:04:51] would come to a place where they were
[1:04:53] drinking or some disobedient or
[1:04:56] something other that would be
[1:04:57] interfering with the worship of of the
[1:04:59] Lord uh which the gifts are then are
[1:05:02] being manifest then the person should
[1:05:06] will should be led out to one side to
[1:05:09] one of the back rooms or somewhere and
[1:05:12] be talked to and dealt with
[1:05:15] kindly
[1:05:18] now while the pastor comes to the
[1:05:22] platform as the pastor comes to platform
[1:05:24] I would
[1:05:26] suggest as the brandom Tabernacle here
[1:05:29] that the pastor lead the
[1:05:32] congregation and at least one or
[1:05:36] two good
[1:05:39] songs for we have found it so that when
[1:05:43] too many are trying to operate the in
[1:05:46] the church it brings on only
[1:05:49] trouble I would suggest as I did while I
[1:05:52] was pastoring at the church Church i l
[1:05:56] the songs
[1:05:57] myself and I feel that it would be a
[1:06:00] good thing at the pastor did so himself
[1:06:04] and in all prayer meetings where they're
[1:06:06] gathered together groups of prayer
[1:06:09] meetings the pastor must be at each
[1:06:12] one it should never be left to any
[1:06:16] individual to go lead such meetings for
[1:06:19] we have found it so that they get also
[1:06:21] the track on Doctrine and then called
[1:06:24] bring it right back into the church and
[1:06:26] many time bring heresies and so forth
[1:06:28] which doesn't belong in the Church of
[1:06:30] the Living God and the pastor should be
[1:06:33] at all prayer meetings and so forth
[1:06:36] where congreg Gatherings are and the
[1:06:40] pastors should never take s in the
[1:06:43] meeting the saying that one group is
[1:06:46] this way and one that way the pastor
[1:06:48] should stand between both of them and go
[1:06:50] to them and get them reconciled
[1:06:53] immediately
[1:06:54] and if he can't get them reconciled let
[1:06:56] him take a deacon with him and then if
[1:06:59] the they want your neither Pastor nor
[1:07:01] Deacon then it should be told to the
[1:07:03] church and as Jesus said let them be
[1:07:06] unto you as a heathen and a Publican and
[1:07:09] whatever you bind on Earth said Jesus I
[1:07:12] bind in heaven and what you loose on
[1:07:15] Earth I will loose in
[1:07:18] heaven
[1:07:19] now when the pastor comes to the
[1:07:22] platform let the pastor then lead at
[1:07:26] least one or two songs and go straight
[1:07:29] to the word not no time for these long
[1:07:34] testimony meetings and everybody get up
[1:07:36] and a word to say that does not prosper
[1:07:39] in the brandom Tabernacle if any peoples
[1:07:42] who are listening to this tape and you
[1:07:45] it has prospered in your church well
[1:07:48] that's perfectly all right and we are
[1:07:50] very glad of that that it does prosper
[1:07:53] in your church but in our CH it does not
[1:07:56] it only causes
[1:07:58] confusion I've been pastoring here for
[1:08:00] 20 some odd years and I have found that
[1:08:03] it only causes confusion if you've got a
[1:08:05] testimony give it before the in the
[1:08:07] congregation of the people while the
[1:08:10] spirits are blessing and so forth or the
[1:08:13] real way to testify is not in the church
[1:08:16] is out in Dark Places let your light
[1:08:18] shine where it's dark go to Road houses
[1:08:22] and different places and where sining
[1:08:23] and thing is heaping then let your light
[1:08:25] shine there is the place to do it but
[1:08:28] however if the Lord has blessed you and
[1:08:30] give you some great special blessing or
[1:08:32] something that you have to tell the
[1:08:33] people do it in time of the other
[1:08:37] service the pre-service the preliminary
[1:08:40] or when the spirit is blessing and
[1:08:43] giving testimonies and Revelations and
[1:08:45] tongues and interpretations and so forth
[1:08:48] in the worship of the Saints before the
[1:08:51] word of God is being brought forth than
[1:08:54] the pastor after leading this himym
[1:08:56] shall immediately lead the church in
[1:08:59] prayer and a congregational prayer
[1:09:02] himself as he stands at the platform
[1:09:04] asking the rest of them to Bow their
[1:09:06] heads in
[1:09:08] prayer this we have found to be a
[1:09:11] greater blessing and a more ruing and
[1:09:14] operating in the church and then the
[1:09:16] next thing the pastor should do then if
[1:09:20] they had a real spiritual meeting with
[1:09:22] the gifts making man EST many secrets of
[1:09:25] the people's hearts and things which
[1:09:28] should be done by the gifts in the
[1:09:29] meeting then the spirit of God is in the
[1:09:32] meeting and it's very easy then for the
[1:09:35] pastor to find the spirit of God which
[1:09:37] is already in the meeting on the word of
[1:09:40] God as he reads and starts preaching the
[1:09:43] pastor then preach anything that the
[1:09:45] Holy Spirit would put on his heart
[1:09:47] whatever he wishes to do standing there
[1:09:50] but the congregation is the only they
[1:09:53] can rejoice as he is preaching of course
[1:09:55] or say Amen when the word comes forth
[1:09:59] but as far as getting up and giving uh
[1:10:01] uh messages and tongues and and
[1:10:03] interpretation while the Holy Spirit is
[1:10:06] working through the pasture the
[1:10:08] scripture condemns that and said the
[1:10:11] spirit of the prophets is subject to the
[1:10:13] prophet the pastor then must call this
[1:10:16] individual down and ask them to be
[1:10:19] reverent and to keep their place the
[1:10:22] pastor must be a man
[1:10:24] that has got a very humble way about him
[1:10:29] but not too humble but what he could be
[1:10:32] like the Lord Jesus Christ when he seen
[1:10:34] wrong going on in the church he platted
[1:10:36] ropes and ran them out of the church and
[1:10:39] now the Church of God is the house of
[1:10:44] judgment and the pastor is the highest
[1:10:47] order in the church the Elder is the
[1:10:49] highest thing in the apostolic church
[1:10:52] outside of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:54] the Holy Spirit brings his message
[1:10:55] straight to the Elder and the Elder
[1:10:57] gives it to the people the Saints in
[1:11:00] their gifts shall have their place first
[1:11:02] to worship and come together which
[1:11:05] brings as I have said before the spirit
[1:11:08] of the Lord in the building for the
[1:11:10] pastor and it makes it much easier for
[1:11:12] the Holy Spirit to work through him then
[1:11:14] when a good spiritual meeting has just
[1:11:17] proceded his teaching and then the Holy
[1:11:20] Spirit gets into the word and teaches
[1:11:22] the word at just been manifested by the
[1:11:25] gifts and then the older call is being
[1:11:28] made then afterwards and many then will
[1:11:31] see and know according to the working of
[1:11:34] the Holy Spirit and the word of God
[1:11:36] which a pastor places it on that you are
[1:11:39] the Church of the Living God and if Paul
[1:11:42] said of old he'll fall down and say
[1:11:45] truly God is with you
[1:11:48] now in these things let it be done with
[1:11:52] reverence and now to the pastor to our
[1:11:57] brother Neville at this time remember he
[1:12:01] is the full head of the
[1:12:04] church brother
[1:12:07] nebble has a
[1:12:09] right
[1:12:10] to exercise any Authority that the Holy
[1:12:16] Spirit would anything the Holy Spirit
[1:12:18] would tell him to say in other words in
[1:12:21] the church he has a right to anything
[1:12:23] that God would lead him to do he also
[1:12:26] has a right over his Deacon board he can
[1:12:30] change the Deacon board the trustees or
[1:12:34] or pianist or any other office in the
[1:12:38] church that he desires to change feeling
[1:12:41] led by the Holy
[1:12:42] Spirit uh to do so and whatever he does
[1:12:46] I'll recognize it as he I believe to be
[1:12:50] a godly man I'll recognize it that be of
[1:12:54] the Lord and will sanction the
[1:12:57] same therefore it gives him the
[1:13:01] authority then to operate the church the
[1:13:03] way he feels led to do it
[1:13:07] now are any office in the church if he
[1:13:10] desires to to to uh switch uh positions
[1:13:15] with people or he has the authority to
[1:13:19] do that which I trust that this will
[1:13:23] always be lovely and never have to be
[1:13:26] used now may the Lord bless you all and
[1:13:31] I trust that this will
[1:13:33] be uh carried out to the very best of
[1:13:38] your knowledge and may the Holy Spirit
[1:13:41] watch over each one of you and may every
[1:13:45] officer of the church F his post of Duty
[1:13:50] knowing this that God is going to hold
[1:13:52] you
[1:13:54] responsible for how you help your office
[1:13:58] in the
[1:13:59] church each one will have to give an
[1:14:02] account and to the leoty and the dear
[1:14:06] gifted Saints that's in our church those
[1:14:09] who who prophesy or speak with tongues
[1:14:13] or interpret or have
[1:14:15] Revelations we are just so happy to have
[1:14:19] you in the church and we will give you
[1:14:22] full
[1:14:23] operation and everything that the Holy
[1:14:27] Spirit shall prove that he has said to
[1:14:30] you and we love you and we believe that
[1:14:33] these gifts are in you and that if you
[1:14:37] have the right opportunity and a
[1:14:39] scripturally presentation of it that you
[1:14:43] will make great workers in our midst and
[1:14:49] may the Lord bless you all is my sincere
[1:14:53] prayer
[1:14:57] Christians since listening to this tape
[1:15:01] I have a one thing that I seen I left
[1:15:05] out and that is this that while people
[1:15:09] are speaking with tongues it must be in
[1:15:12] the courses of two or three according to
[1:15:15] the scriptures that is there's only two
[1:15:18] or three messages to be given in each
[1:15:22] single service
[1:15:23] after that according to the scriptures
[1:15:26] at these course this must be only two or
[1:15:30] three so may you carry these things out
[1:15:33] accordingly a way the Holy Spirit has D
[1:15:37] directed it in his Bible and this is the
[1:15:39] best of my knowledge the way to do it
[1:15:42] Paul said let them be by courses two or
[1:15:44] three when they're speaking the Lord
[1:15:47] bless
[1:15:52] you
[1:15:58] how many thank the Lord for his Worden
[1:16:01] amen what the prophet said and that's
[1:16:04] what we look to we thank God for it
